FOREWORD
For a long time, there has been a problem with technology. The progress of this phenomenon
has been alienating. People have lost control of their work, and their employment has been
threatened. Workplaces and diverse global organizations have been altered. Current reports
about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) provide a testimonial to this problem. The
changes initiated by AI at Amazon, for example, relate to the manipulation of workers and
customers, attended by a widespread message that AI will improve the lives of everyone.
In view of these conflicting trends, some critics call for the decolonization of AI. In this vein,
priority has been given to the development of a human-centric AI. The key issue, according to
these writers, is that technology in general, and AI in particular, has gained autonomy and
dominates everyday life. So, the question becomes: How can a more humanely embedded
technology be produced?
Cathy O'Neil, in her book Weapons of Math Destruction, argues that algorithms are simply
opinions written in code. Her point is that algorithms are not mystical, but rather, they are
nothing more than human expressions. Mickunas and Pilotta contribute to this outlook with
their claim that AI is a human language implanted in complex products, which are extensions
of our practical abilities. It is not the AI that is in charge but the human creative autonomy
that has the final say.
Mickunas and Pilotta correct this misunderstanding through their reliance on phenomenology
and their grounding of AI in the life-world. With the illusion of autonomy undermined, AI
should  no  longer  be  able  to  colonize  other  modes  of  knowledge.  A  full  range  of  human
expression is now available, with AI representing only one modality. In this regard, Mickunas
and Pilotta, consistent with Husserl’s aim in the Crisis, go a long way to resurrecting the
human agency at the core of this and other technologies, showing that their alienating effects
are unwarranted.

PREFACE
The modern Western world is founded on an uncritical acceptance of Western ontology in the
very  effort  to  find  something  common  or  stable  across  common  histories.  It  might  be
misleading,  in  that  it  presumes  the  traditional  ontology  of  permanence,  which  is  tacitly
accepted by the sciences, including the sciences we call “human.” Understanding artificial
intelligence means coming to understand the issues of productivity, freedom, and temporality.
These  are  basic  phenomena  that  cannot  be  designed  to  offer  the  traditional  ontological
conceptions of permanence or essence. They are the taken-for-granted and the covered-over
dimensions  with  respect  to  the  interpretations  of  humans  as  permanent.  We  have  been
immersed in our social institutions, our environment, and our mythologies, and once in a
while, they incur revolutions in which we participate, through which we express our choice
for a new form of political life, productive relationships, and our social institutions. We will
ride the crest of freedom. Yet, after the revolutions, the leaders become either tyrants or
professional revolutionaries who invoke the revolutionary laws, the ecstatic wave subsides,
and we sink into daily necessities.
All  too  often,  the  dream  of  AI  is  for  a  totally  rational  society  which  is  basically  an  old
Platonic ideal transformed into a future utopia where AI mimics the human, but also expands
his powers beyond all reach. AI, as we shall see throughout this manuscript, is, in fact, hinged
on productivity, which is a common central theme of politics, labor, and freedom. The human
as  the  maker,  the  maker  society,  if  you  will,  is  fundamentally,  at  heart,  a  magical
interpretation of the human. AI is prosthetic magic. Magical “interpretations” does not mean
magic in the sense of witchcraft or some mystical framework. We mean it as a mode of self-
understanding  and  self-interpretation  of  our  world  and  the  world  in  which  we  are
predominantly  immersed,  which  we  call  technological.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction
 to
 the
 Problem
 of
 Artificial
Intelligence
Abstract: Chapter 1 introduces the problem of artificial intelligence (AI) as a human
doppelgänger. The logic of artificial intelligence is the control algorithm, dominated by
the tradition of two-value logic. We sketch out the consequences of such algorithmic
performance, which have had deleterious effects on the ecological landscape in the
broad sense of the term. We also report the findings of an interdisciplinary report from
Stanford  University  on  the  successes  and  failures  of  AI.  The  chapter  ends  with  a
discussion of the key findings of an interdisciplinary conference, sketching out the
correlates of understanding. These can best be summarized by answering the questions:
How do we determine if a system understands? Does a lack of understanding make AI
systems susceptible to adversarial examples, and to what degree do systems need to
understand in order to be able to explain their decisions and predictions? By what
mechanisms do humans extract meaning from data or experience?
Keywords:  Algorithm,  Artificial  Intelligence,  Autopoiesis,  Common  Sense,
Logic,  Phenomenology,  Understanding.
INTRODUCTION
The histories of the Greek and Chinese civilizations are replete with the history of
automata.  The  “automata”  is  the  law  of  moving  parts  in  something  we  make
called a “machine.” There is a relationship between machine and magic. In the
hermetic sciences, mere matter could be transformed into gold, but life also could
be distilled from the alchemist's retorts. Another means of creating life out of
inanimate matter was through cabalistic conjurations. Small wonder that an air of
mystery and magic hung over the Renaissance magus who repeatedly also gained
the taint of charlatanism. John Dee, the Elizabethan scientist, is a prime example
of the confusion of magic, chemistry, and mechanics.
In the hermetic tradition of the Renaissance, the ancient fascination with automata
took on a new life as magic and mechanics were intertwined, and an air of fear
and wonder hovered over the statues of angels conjured out of earth and air. Are
they alive and real or not? Are humans indeed mechanicians who can breathe life
into  what  they  have  created,  thereby  imitating  their  own creator,  or are  they

Mickunas and Pilotta
merely  machines  themselves,  working  on  mechanical  principles?  In  the
Renaissance, these questions were close to the surface, although enveloped in
mythical and magical shapes. They were bathed at the time of the Enlightenment
in the pure light of reason, and discussion of them took place in unambiguous
scientific  terms.  Underlying  the  discussion,  however,  were  the  fears  of  the
automata  as  posing  an  irrational  threat  to  humans,  calling  into  question  their
identity, their sexuality as the basis of creation and the powers of domination.
Automata provoked fears, but also the promise of a creative Promethean force.
The tension between these two aspects of automata is at play in various examples
of  the  literary  genre,  which  is  quite  interesting  if  one  takes  into  account  the
“Nightingale” of Hans Christian Anderson’s fairy tales, Mary Shelly’s creature of
Frankenstein, Tick Tock of the Oz stories, the works of Karel Čapek, and the
assorted robots of Isaac Asimov. One of the greatest connections of all was when
we entertained the question of life along with the question of machines, and the
relationship brought into question animals: Are animals nothing but machines?
Are machines endowed with animality? At this particular point, we need to look
at the derivative form of automata, the agency of the computer. It has been said
that the logic of the computer is the algorithm, and the algorithm equals logic and
control, which animates the computer. The algorithm is comprised of definitions
for abstract procedures related to knowledge about the problem domain, and of
data  structures  on  which  these  procedures  operate,  while  the  control  part  is
concerned  with  strategies  for  turning  the  logic  component  into  an  efficient
machine strategy to be used for unwinding knowledge in time and space. Two
things  are  apparent:  Algorithms  are  thought  to  be  separate  from  their
environment; they can be taken and applied elsewhere without further ado. Also,
algorithms—although they may process temporal data and although they need
time to process that data—appear as static structures that neither have a history of
coming  into  existence  nor  any  providence  of  future  transformation.  In  other
words, in the tightness of language and cybernetics, there is no space left for a
performative  that  goes  deeper  than  an  abstract  analysis  of  space-time
requirements.  Every  piece  of  software  is  an  algorithm;  software  is  developed,
involves a book with a declarative specification, and quickly becomes obsolete if
that specification is not executable. You cannot experiment with it. Deleuze and
Guattari (1983) formulate machines as being generally understood as systems of
interrupting  flows  in  which  the  interrupters  (or  cuts)  paradoxically  ensure  the
continuity, the flow, that is associated with one and another machine, such that a
machine is always connected to yet another machine, ad infinitum. In relation to
algorithms, Parisi’s analysis points to a similar direction: Instead of generative
aesthetics  based  on  prediction  and  probabilities,  she  argues  that  there  is  a
speculative  tendency  intrinsic  to  computation,  producing  genuine  novelty  that
cannot be explained by external forces or initial conditions.

Introduction
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   3
ALGORITHMIC DOMINATION
1. Algorithmic oppression extends the unjust subordination of one social group
and  the  privileging  of  another—maintained  by  a  “complex  network  of  social
restrictions” ranging from social norms, laws, institutional rules, implicit biases,
and stereotypes—through automated, data-driven and predictive systems.
2. Predictive systems leveraging AI have led to the formation of new types of
policing  and  surveillance,  access  to  government  services,  and  reshaped
conceptions  of  identity  and  speech  in  the  digital  age.  Such  systems  were
developed with the ostensible aim of providing decision-support tools that are
evidence-driven, unbiased and consistent. Yet, evidence of how these tools are
deployed shows a reality that is often the opposite (Benjamin, 2019).
3.  Beyond  the  domain  of  criminal  justice,  there  are  numerous  instances  of
predictive  algorithms  perpetuating  social  harms  in  everyday  interactions,
including examples of facial recognition systems failing to detect black faces and
perpetuating  gender  stereotypes,  hate  speech  detection  algorithms  identifying
black and queer vernacular as toxic, new recruitment tools discriminating against
women, automated airport screening-systems systematically flagging trans bodies
for security checks, (Costanza-Chock, 2018), and predictive algorithms used to
purport that queerness can be identified from facial images alone.
4. Many of the recent successes in AI are possible only when the large volumes of
data  needed  are  annotated  by  human  experts  to  expose  the  common-sense
elements that make the data useful for a chosen task. The people who do this
labelling  for  a  living,  the  so-called  “ghost  workers,”  do  this  work  in  remote
settings, distributed across the world using online annotation platforms or within
dedicated  annotation  companies  (Gray  &  Suri,  2019).  In  extreme  cases,  the
labelling is done by prisoners and the economically vulnerable in geographies
with limited labor laws.
5. A review of the global landscape of AI ethics guidelines (Jobin et al., 2019)
pointed out the under-representation of geographic areas such as Africa, South
and  Central  America,  and  Central  Asia  in  the  AI  ethics  debate.  The  review
observes a power imbalance wherein “more economically developed countries are
shaping this debate more than others, which raises concerns about neglecting local
knowledge,  cultural  pluralism  and  the  demands  of  global  fairness.”  A  similar
dynamic is found when we examine the proliferation of national policies on AI in
countries across the world (Dutton, 2018): “Unless they (developing countries)
wish to plunge their people into poverty, they will be forced to negotiate with
whichever  country  supplies  most  of  their  AI  software—China  or  the  United
States—to  essentially  become  that  country’s  economic  dependent”.  It  can  be

Mickunas and Pilotta
argued  that  the  agency  of  developing  countries  is  in  these  ways  undermined,
where  they  cannot  act  unilaterally  to  forge  their  own  rules  and  cannot  expect
prompt protection of their interests.
6. Much of the current policy discourse surrounding AI in developing countries is
in  economic  and  social  development,  where  advanced  technologies  are
propounded as solutions for complex developmental scenarios, represented by the
growing  areas  of  AI  for  Good  and  AI  for  Sustainable  Development  Goals
(AI4SDGs).  In  this  discourse,  Green  (2019)  proposes  that  “good  isn’t  good
enough”,  and  that  there  is  a  need  to  expand  the  currently  limited  and  vague
definitions  within  the  computer  sciences  of  what  ‘social  good’  means.
ADVANCES IN AI
As Littman et al. (2021) note at length, there have been many advances made by
AI:
“People are using AI more today to dictate to their phone, get recommendations,
enhance their backgrounds on conference calls, and much more. Machine learning
technologies  have  moved  from  the  academic  realm  into  the  real  world  in  a
multitude of ways. Neural network language models learn about how words are
used by identifying patterns in naturally occurring text, supporting applications
such as machine translation, text classification, speech recognition, writing aids,
and chatbots. Image-processing technology is now widespread, but applications
such  as  creating  photo-realistic  pictures  of  people  and  recognizing  faces  are
seeing a backlash worldwide. During 2020, robotics development was driven in
part by the need to support social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Predicted rapid progress in fully autonomous driving failed to materialize, but
autonomous vehicles have begun operating in selected locales. AI tools now exist
for  identifying  a  variety  of  eye  and  skin  disorders,  detecting  cancers,  and
supporting measurements needed for clinical diagnosis. For financial institutions,
uses  of  AI  are  going  beyond  detecting  fraud  and  enhancing  cybersecurity  to
automating legal and compliance documentation and detecting money laundering.
Recommender systems now have a dramatic influence on people’s consumption
of  products,  services,  and  content,  but  they  raise  significant  ethical  concerns”
(Littman, et al., 2021, p. 7).
Health
Littman, et al. (2021) also note the implications of AI on health:
“AI  is  increasingly  being  used  in  biomedical  applications,  particularly  in
diagnosis,  drug  discovery,  and  basic  life  science  research”.

Introduction
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   5
“Recent years have seen AI-based imaging technologies move from an academic
pursuit to commercial projects. Tools now exist for identifying a variety of eye
and skin disorders, detecting cancers, and supporting measurements needed for
clinical diagnosis. Some of these systems rival the diagnostic abilities of expert
pathologists and radiologists, and can help alleviate tedious tasks (for example,
counting  the  number  of  cells  dividing  in  cancer  tissue).  In  other  domains,
however, the use of automated systems raises significant ethical concerns. AI-
based risk scoring in healthcare is also becoming more common. Predictors of
health  deterioration  are  now  integrated  into  major  health  record  platforms”
(Littman,  et  al.,  2021,  p.  6).
Finance
Littman and colleagues (2021) also discuss the implications of AI for finance:
“AI  has  been  increasingly  adopted  into  finance.  New  systems  often  take
advantage of consumer data that are not traditionally used in credit scoring. In
some cases, this approach can open up credit to new groups of people; in others, it
can be used to force people to adopt specific social behaviors. High-frequency
trading  relies  on  a  combination  of  models  as  well  as  the  ability  to  make  fast
decisions. In the space of personal finance, so-called robo-advising— automated
financial  advice—is  quickly  becoming  mainstream  for  investment  and  overall
financial planning” (Littman, et al., 2021, p. 17).
THE MOST PRESSING DANGERS OF AI
According to Littman, et al. (2021):
“As  AI  systems  prove  to  increasingly  have  real-world  applications,  they  have
broadened  their  reach,  causing  risks  of  misuse,  overuse,  and  explicit  abuse  to
proliferate. One of the most pressing dangers of AI is techno-solutionism, the
view that AI can be seen as a panacea when it is merely a tool. There is an aura of
neutrality and impartiality associated with AI decision-making in some corners of
the public consciousness, resulting in systems being accepted as objective even
though  they  may  be  the  result  of  biased  historical  decisions  or  even  blatant
discrimination.  AI  systems  are  being  used  in  service  of  disinformation  on  the
internet, giving them the potential to become a threat to democracy and a tool for
fascism. Insufficient thought given to the human factors of AI integration has led
to the oscillation between mistrust of the system and over-reliance on the system.
AI algorithms play a role in decisions concerning distributing organs, vaccines,
and other elements of healthcare, meaning these approaches have literal life-and-
death stakes” (Littman, et al., 2021, p. 9).

Causality
As Littman, et al. (2021) point out:
“Current machine learning techniques are capable of discovering hidden patterns
in data, and these discoveries allow the systems to solve ever-increasing varieties
of  problems.  Neural  network  language  models,  for  example,  are  built  on  the
capacity to predict words in sequence, display a tremendous capacity to correct
grammar,  answer  natural  language  questions,  write  computer  code,  translate
languages,  and  summarize  complex  or  extended  specialized  texts.  Today’s
machine-learning  models,  however,  have  only  a  limited  capacity  to  discover
causal knowledge of the world. They have very limited ability to predict how
novel interventions might change the world they are interacting with, or how an
environment might have evolved differently under different conditions. They do
not know what is possible in the world”.
“Aligning with human normative systems is a massive challenge in part because
what  is  ‘good’  and  what  is  ‘bad’  varies  tremendously  across  human  cultures,
settings,  and  time.  Even  apparently  universal  norms  such  as  ‘do  not  kill’  are
highly variable and nuanced. Most killing does not occur in deliberate, intentional
contexts. Highways and automobiles are designed to trade off speed and traffic
flow with a known risk that a non-zero number of people will be killed by design.
AI researchers can choose not to participate in the building of systems that violate
the  researcher’s  own  values,  by  refusing  to  work  on  AI  that  supports  state
surveillance or military applications, say. But a lesson from the social sciences
and humanities is that it is naive to think that there is a definable and core set of
universal values that can directly be built into AI systems. AI systems built for
Western values, with Western tradeoffs, violate other values. Even within a given
shared  normative  framework,  the  capacity  to  function  appropriately  and  with
foresight in an environment. Like a competent human, advanced AI systems will
need to be able to both read and interact with the progress being made on making
AI more explainable—and avoiding opaque models in high-stakes settings when
possible—systems of accountability require more than causal accounts of how a
decision was reached” (Littman, et al., 2021, p. 23).
HOW HAS PUBLIC SENTIMENT TOWARD AI EVOLVED?
“Media coverage of AI may distort AI’s potential at both the positive and negative
extremes, but it has helped to raise public awareness of legitimate concerns about
AI bias, lack of transparency and accountability, and the potential of AI-driven
automation  to  contribute  to  rising  inequality.  More  public  outreach  from  AI
scientists  would  be  beneficial  as  society  grapples  with  the  impacts  of  these
technologies. It is important that the AI research community move beyond the

Introduction
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   7
goal  of  educating  or  talking  to  the  public  and  toward  more  participatory
engagement  and  conversation  with  the  public”  (Littman,  et  al.,  2021,  p.  8).
Common Sense
Finally, Littman, et al. (2021) address the issue of common sense:
“These recent approaches attempt to make AI systems more general by enabling
them to learn from a small number of examples, learn multiple tasks in a continual
way without inter-task interference, and learn in a self-supervised or intrinsically
motivated way. While these approaches have shown promise on several restricted
domains, such as learning to play a variety of video games, they are still only
early steps in the pursuit of general AI”.
“An important missing ingredient, long sought in the AI community, is common
sense. The informal notion of common sense includes several key components of
general intelligence that humans mostly take for granted, including a vast amount
of mostly unconscious knowledge about the world, an understanding of causality
(what factors cause events to happen or entities to have certain properties), and an
ability  to  perceive  abstract  similarities  between  situations—that  is,  to  make
analogies”  (Littman,  et  al.,  2021,  p.  32).
Co-development
Co-operation—if  not  AI  co-development—is  one  potential  strategy  within  a
varied  toolkit  supporting  the  socio-political,  economic,  linguistic,  and  cultural
relevance  of  AI  systems  to  different  communities,  as  well  as  shifting  power
asymmetries. A decolonial view offers us tools with which to engage a reflexive
evaluation and continuous examination of issues of cultural encounter, and a drive
to question the philosophical basis of development (Kiros, 1992). With a self-
reflexive practice, initiatives that seek to use AI technologies for social impact can
develop the appropriate safeguards and regulations that avoid further entrenching
exploitation and harm and can conceptualize the long-term impacts of algorithmic
interventions with historical continuities in mind.
As Littman et al. (2021) note:
“AI  systems  still  remain  very  far  from  human  abilities  in  all  these  areas,  and
perhaps will never gain common sense or general intelligence without being more
tightly coupled to the physical world. But grappling with these issues helps us not
only make progress in AI, but better understand our own often invisible human
mechanisms of general intelligence” (Littman, et al., 2021, p. 33).

THE MEANING OF AI
Melanie Mitchell’s (2020) discussion of a symposium of interdisciplinary scholars
names a number of important thematics, which AI professionals must address in
order  to  understand  the  critical  limits  of  AI.  By  addressing  these  themes,  the
ethical  considerations  which  science  and  policymakers  cannot  eschew  will
become evident. The following themes are cited/paraphrased from her article, “On
Crashing the Barrier of Meaning in AI”.
Questions and Themes
Mitchell (2020) addresses the most important questions and themes pertaining to
AI:
“• By what mechanisms do humans and other natural information-driven systems
extract meaning from data or experience? Can insights from such systems be used
to improve AI?
• To what extent do current-day AI systems need to understand the situations they
deal  with  in  order  to  perform  reliably,  particularly  in  situations  outside  their
training  regimes?
• To what extent do systems need to understand in order to be able to explain their
decisions and predictions?
• Does a lack of understanding make data-driven AI systems (e.g., deep networks)
susceptible to adversarial examples? Is there a way to defend against such attacks
without imbuing such systems with human-like understanding?
• How do we determine if a system is actually understanding?”
“In contrast, humans and most other animals are able to extrapolate—that is, to
adapt what they have learned to diverse situations. This is accomplished via the
ability to build abstract representations, and to make analogies mapping these
representations to new situations. Abstract representations and analogy, combined
with the core knowledge, allow organisms to learn concepts from a small number
of examples, to imitate and generate behavior at a conceptual level, to transfer
knowledge  between  modalities,  to  perform  flexible  planning,  and  to  generate
possible futures and counterfactuals, among other abilities central to our notion of
understanding”.
“Active  perception,  learning,  and  inference.  Several  workshop  participants
contrasted the ‘passive’ feedforward, and supervised nature of current machine
learning and inference in neural networks with the importance of active mental

Introduction
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   9
processes in natural intelligent systems. Perception, learning, and inference are
active processes that unfold dynamically over time, involve continual feedback
from context and prior knowledge, and are largely unsupervised”.
“Object-based,  causal  models.  In  contrast  with  models  that  solely  perform
classification or action selection, understanding involves building causal models
of objects, relationships, actions, and entire situations, and flexibly using these
models  to  predict  and  act  in  the  world.  Here,  the  term  ‘object’  refers  to  any
discrete  conceptual  entity,  and  ‘causal’  implies  that  a  model  captures  spatio-
temporal relationships of causality among parts of a situation. Such models are
built on top of the core knowledge described above” (Mitchell, 2020, pp. 88-89).
“Autonomous  cars  and  vacuum  cleaners  have  not  yet  achieved  human-like
understanding. Shared brain morphology and organization give humans, and to
some  extent  other  animals,  a  common  structure  to  translate  signals  perceived
about  the  external  environment  into  an  internal  representation  that  appears
essential to understanding. As one example, there is evidence that an evolved set
of  neural  circuits  underlie  a  human  and  animal  intuitive  understanding  of
numbers. The way the brain encodes numbers may explain why the number line is
such an easily grasped metaphor (Dehaene, 2011)” (Mitchell, 2020, p. 89).
THE
 INFLUENCE
 OF
 PHENOMENOLOGY
 ON
 ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE
Hubert Dreyfus
Hubert Dreyfus argued that, even when we use explicit symbols, we are using
them against an unconscious background of common-sense knowledge and that,
without this background, our symbols cease to mean anything. This background,
in Dreyfus’ (1972) view, was not implemented in individual brains as explicit
individual symbols with explicit individual meanings.
Dreyfus  argued  that  human  problem-solving  and  expertise  depend  on  our
background sense of the context, of what is important and interesting given the
situation,  rather  than  on  the  process  of  searching  through  combinations  of
possibilities  to  find  what  we  need.  Dreyfus  would  describe  it  in  1986  as  the
difference between “knowing-that” and “knowing-how,” based on Heidegger’s
(1962) distinction between present-at-hand and ready-to-hand (Dreyfus, 1986).
Knowing that is our conscious, step-by-step problem-solving abilities. We use
these skills when we encounter a difficult problem that requires us to stop, step
back, and search through ideas one at a time. At moments like this, the ideas
become very precise and simple: they become context-free symbols, which we

10   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
manipulate using logic and language. These are the skills that Newell and Simon
had demonstrated with both psychological experiments and computer programs.
Dreyfus  agreed  that  their  programs  adequately  imitated  the  skills  he  calls
“knowing-that”.
The human sense of the situation, according to Dreyfus, is based on our goals, our
bodies,  and  our  culture—all  of  our  unconscious  intuitions,  attitudes,  and
knowledge  about  the  world.  This  “context”  or  “background”  (related  to
Heidegger’s  Dasein)  is  a  form  of  knowledge  that  is  not  stored  in  our  brains
symbolically, but intuitively in some way. It affects what we notice and what we
don’t  notice,  what  we  expect  and  what  possibilities  we  don’t  consider:  we
discriminate  between  what  is  essential  and  inessential.  The  things  that  are
inessential are relegated ki, to our “fringe consciousness” (borrowing a phrase
from William James): the millions of things we’re aware of, but we’re not really
thinking about right now.
Dreyfus  does  not  believe  that  AI  programs,  as  they  were  implemented  in  the
1970s and 1980s, could capture this “background” or do the kind of fast problem-
solving  that  it  allows.  He  argued  that  unconscious  knowledge  could  never  be
captured symbolically. If AI could not find a way to address these issues, then it
was  doomed  to  failure,  an  exercise  in  “tree  climbing  with  one’s  eyes  on  the
moon”.
NEURAL NETWORKS
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
used in computer visualization, virtual reality, and natural language processing.
Both are developments in neural networks. Both process time series and data that
come in sequences, such as sentences. However, convolutional neural networks
and  recurrent  neural  networks  are  used  for  different  purposes.  CNNs  employ
filters within layers to transform data. RNNs reuse activation functions from other
data points in the sequence to generate that which is to be next in the series.
A  CNN  filter  is  a  matrix  of  randomized  number  values  in  rows  and  columns
depending  on  the  use  within  a  convolutional  layer.  A  number  of  layers  move
through an image. The filter convolutes the pixels of the image, changing the
values before passing the data on to the next layer. CNNs function technically
well in “interpreting” visual data that does not come in a sequence, but they do
not  function  technically  well  in  “interpreting”  temporal  information,  such  as
videos,  static  images,  or  texts.
For example, words that come before and after an entity in a sequence have a
direct effect on how it is classified. In order to deal with the sentences, algorithms

A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   11
are  designed  to  learn  from  past  and  future  data  in  the  sequence,  which  is  an
RNN’s function. This is accomplished by activating previous and or later nodes in
the sequence in order to influence the output.
None of this is certain. However, the phenomenology of place and space is key to
this operation, which will be taken up in Chapter 8 of this text. It would behoove
us to acknowledge the fundamental critique of CNN and RNN by Dreyfus (1996).
All  this  puts  disembodied  neural-networks  at  a  serious  disadvantage  when  it
comes to learning to cope in the human world. Nothing is more alien to our life-
form than a network with no up/down, front/back orientation, no interior/exterior
distinction, no preferred way of moving, such as moving forward more easily than
backwards, and no tendency towards acquiring a maximum grip on its world. The
moral  is  that  the  way  brains  acquire  skills  from  input-output  pairings  can  be
simulated by neural-networks, but such nets will not be able to acquire our skills
until they have been put into robots with a body structure like ours. (Dreyfus,
1996).
Francisco Varela
The following section includes direct quotations from Humberto Maturana and
Francisco  Varela’s  (1980)  work,  which  has  been  pivotal  to  the  concept  of
autopoiesis in biology, social science, computer logic, and the cognitive sciences.
The development of AI presupposes the autopoietic concept of communication.
“The  use  to  which  a  machine  can  be  put  by  man  is  not  a  feature  of  the
organization of the machine, but of the domain in which the machine operates,
and belongs to our description of the machine in a context wider than the machine
itself. This is a significant notion. Man-made machines are all made with some
purpose, practical or not—some aim (even if it is only to amuse) that is specified.
This aim usually appears expressed in the product of the operation of the machine,
but not necessarily so. However, we use the notion of purpose when talking of
machines because it calls into play the imagination of the listener and reduces the
explanatory  task  in  the  effort  of  conveying  the  organization  of  a  particular
machine”.
“This is a very essential instance of the distinction, made before, between notions
that are involved in the explanatory paradigm for a system’s phenomenology, and
notions  that  enter  because  of  the  needs  of  the  observer’s  domain  of
communication. To maintain a clear record of what pertains to each domain is an
important  methodological  tool,  which  we  use  extensively.  It  seems  an  almost
trivial  kind  of  logical  bookkeeping,  yet  it  is  too  often  violated  by  usage”
(Maturana  &  Varela,  1980,  p.  12).

12   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
“There are systems that maintain some of their variables constant, or within a
limited range of values. This is, in fact, the basic notion of stability or coherence
which stands at the very foundation of our understanding of systems (e.g.,Wiener,
1950)” (Maturana & Varela, 1980, p. 12).
“The idea of autopoiesis capitalizes on the idea of homeostasis, and extends it in
two  significant  directions:  first,  by  making  every  reference  for  homeostasis
internal to the system itself through the mutual interconnection of processes; and
secondly,  by  positing  this  interdependence  as  the  very  source  of  the  system’s
identity as a concrete unity which we can distinguish. These are systems that, in a
loose sense, produce their own identity: they distinguish themselves from their
background.  Hence  the  name  autopoietic,  from  the  Greek  εαυτός  =  self,  and
παράγω  =  to  produce”  (Maturana  &  Varela,  1980,  p.  13).
“An autopoietic system is organized (defined as a unity) as a network of processes
of production (transformation and destruction) of components which: (1) through
their  interactions  and  transformations  continuously  regenerate  and  realize  the
network of processes (relations) that produced them; and (2) constitute it (the
machine) as a concrete unity in the space in which they exist by specifying the
topological domain of its realization as such a network” (Maturana & Varela,
1980, p. 13).
AUTOPOIETIC DYNAMICS
Maturana and Varela (1980) explain at length:
“1. Production of Constitutive Relations. Constitutive relations are relations that
determine the topology of the autopoietic organization, and hence its physical
boundaries. The production of constitutive relations through the production of the
components  that  hold  these  relations  is  one  of  the  defining  dimensions  of  an
autopoietic  system.  The  cell  defines  its  physical  boundaries  through  the
production  of  constitutive  relations  that  specify  its  topology.  There  is  no
specification within the cell of what it is not” (Maturana & Varela, 1980, p. 24).
“2.  Production  of  Relations  of  Specifications.  Relations  of  specifications  are
relations  that  determine  the  identity  (properties)  of  the  component  of  the
autopoietic  organization,  and  hence,  in  the  case  of  the  cells,  its  physical
feasibility”.
“3. Production of Relation of Order. Relations of order are those that determine
the dynamics of the autopoietic organization by determining the concatenation of
the production of relations of constitution, specification, and order, and hence its
actual realization” (Maturana & Varela, 1980, p. 24).

Introduction
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   13
“Our approach will be mechanistic: No forces or principles will be adduced which
are not found in the physical universe. Yet our problem is the living organization,
and  therefore  our  interest  will  not  be  in  the  properties  of  components,  but  in
processes  and  relations  between  processes  realized  through  components”
(Maturana  &  Varela,  1980,  p.  6).
“This is to be clearly understood. An explanation is always a reformulation of a
phenomenon in such a way that its elements appear operationally connected in its
generation. Furthermore, an explanation is always given by us as observers, and it
is central to distinguish in it what pertains to the system as constitutive of its
phenomenology from what pertains to the needs of our domain of description, and
hence to our interactions with it, its components, and the context in which it is
observed. Since our descriptive domain arises because we simultaneously behold
the unity and its interactions in the domain of observation, notions arising from
cognitive and expositional needs in the domain of description do not pertain to the
explanatory notions for a constitutive organization of the unity (phenomenon). We
shall return to this important issue very often in this book” (Maturana & Varela,
1980, p. 6).
“Furthermore, an explanation may take different forms according to the nature of
the phenomenon explained. Thus, to explain the movement of a falling body, one
resorts to properties of matter, and to laws that describe the conduct of material
bodies  according  to  these  properties  (kinetic  and  gravitational  laws),  while  to
explain the organization of a control plant, one resort to relations and laws that
describe the conduct of relations. In the first case, the materials of the causal
paradigm are bodies and their properties; in the second case, they are relations and
their relations, independently of the nature of the bodies that satisfy them. In this
latter case, in our explanations of the organization of living systems, we shall be
dealing  with  the  relations  that  the  actual  physical  components  must  satisfy  to
constitute such a system, not with the identification of these components. It is our
assumption that there is an organization that is common to all living systems,
whichever the nature of their components. Since our subject is this organization,
not the particular ways in which it may be realized, we shall not make distinctions
between classes or types of a living system. Finally, we are pointing out from the
start the dynamism apparent in living systems and which the word ‘machine’ or
‘system’ connotes” (Maturana & Varela, 1980, pp. 6-7).
“We are asking, then, a fundamental question: Which is the organization of living
systems,  what  kind  of  machines  are  they,  and  how  is  their  phenomenology,
including reproduction and evolution, determined by their unitary organization?...
Machines and systems point to the characterization of a class of unities in terms of
their organization” (Maturana & Varela, 1980, p. 7).

14   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
According to Varela (1979), phenomenology is thus not a convenient stop on the
route to real explanation, but rather it is an active participant in its own right (p.
344) as disciplined accounts should be an integral element of the validation of a
neurobiological proposal and not merely coincidental or heuristic information.
The proposition that living is cognition comes from Maturana and Varela's (1980)
theory that some have taken to be the IS in this proposition as the IS of identity.
“The concept of cognition is the operation of any living system in the domain of
interactions  specified  by  the  circularity  itself.  Organized  cognition  effectively
conducts  itself  in  its  own  domain  of  interactions,  not  the  representation  of  an
independent environment. Living systems, or cognitive systems, are processes of
cognition. Life equals autopoiesis. By this, it is meant that there are three criteria
of autopoiesis:
1. Boundary-containing;
2. Molecular reaction network; and
3. Produces or regenerates itself, and the boundaries are necessary” (Maturana &
Varela, 1980).
It’s efficient for the organization of minimal life as well as the emergence of a self
and the emergence of world. As Thompson (2009) explains, the emergence of the
self in the world equals sense-making and perception action since:
“Sense-making  is  tantamount  to  cognition  in  a  minimal  sense  of  viable
sensorimotor conduct. Such conduct is oriented toward a subject of signification
and valence. Signification and valence do not preexist ‘out there,’ but are actions
constituted by the living being. Sense-making, which equals cognition, but from
an autopoietic perspective, evolution involves simply the conservation of death
and adaptation as long as a living being does not disintegrate but maintains its
autopoietic integrity. It is adaptive because the mode of sense-making contains it
as  viable  from  the  point  of  view  of  adaption.  It  is  an  invariant  background
condition  of  all  life”  (Thompson,  2009,  pp.  83-84).
“Cognition, on the other hand, is the present context, meaning the sense-making
activity  of  the  living  which  underlies  the  conservation  of  adaption.  No  sense-
making, no living, nor conservation of adaption, knows it is this way of thinking
about cognition. The hypothesis about the natural roots of intentionality arises
from the operational closure of an autonomous system, the paradigm of which,
and  minimal  case,  is  in  the  autopoietic  system.  This  extends  the
phenomenological  notion  of  intentionality  to  biology  and  complex  systems
theory”  (Thompson,  2009,  p.  84).

Introduction
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   15
“Maturana and Varela (1980) explicitly identified a living system with machines
and denied that the living systems or teleological living systems are physical. Idle,
autopoietic machines are purposeless systems. By ‘machine,’ they clearly did not
mean an artifact. They meant any system whose operation is determined by its
relation  or  organization  and  the  way  that  organization  is  structurally  realized.
Autopoietic systems maintain their own organization constantly through material
change, thus being homeostatic or dynamic systems of a special sort. In Varela’s
(1979) work, sense-making is not a feature of the autopoietic organization, but
rather the coupling of a concrete autopoietic system with its environment. In other
words, teleology is not an intrinsic organizational property, but rather an emergent
relation” (Thompson, 2009, p. 86).
The proposition is that life is a transcendental one and is about the conditions for
the possibility of knowing life—given that we do not have biological knowledge.
Consider the question of how it is that we are able to recognize or comprehend the
form  of  a  dynamic  pattern.  In  the  first  place,  an  adequate  account  of  certain
observable phenomena requires the concept of an organism in the sense of a self-
organizing whole and autopoiesis. Second, the source of the meaning of these
concepts is the lived body and the lived experience of our own animate body’s
existence. Third, these concepts of the biological accounts are not derivable, even
in principle, from some observer, independent, non-indexical, objective, psycho-
functional

 (Merleau-Ponty,

The everyday lives of competent adults are accomplished by skilled and non-
reflective comportment. As Protevi (2009) notes,
“Disruptive  social  encounters,  however,  lead  to  breakdowns  in  such  everyday
coping and could lead to reflective decision-making or to the adoption of another
skilled  component.  The  neurological,  correlated  breakdowns  fall  into  the
background  of  chaotic  firing,  out  of  which  emerges  a  new  repertoire;  the
resolution of the differential field of widely distributed, chaotic firing forms the
basis for creativity when those arising within the organism are trying for fully
emergent comportment. There is no choice here as the process of arising is too
fast for conscious reflection, which occurs in temporal chunks, so the formation
occurs behind the back of reflective consciousness” (Protevi, 2009, p. 104).
“Perhaps  Varela  (1979)  also  talks  of  a  ‘virtual  self’  or  ‘meshwork  of  selfless
selves" (Protevi, 2009, p. 104). “It is the correlate of their virtual self with its
multiplicity of micro-identities, the enactive world. Here, we see echoes of sense-
making at the heart of autopoiesis. The notion of structural coupling, but with

more ability to flush out the neurological processes at work. We see the contours
in the problematic ethical know-how published in The Embodied Mind” (Varela,
Thompson, & Rosch, 1991). The constitution of the cognitive agent is a matter of
common sense. Golden merchants of an appropriate stance from an entire history
of ancient life, the key to our living system, which is always in “the next moment

hedges that articulates microworlds that are the source of the autonomous and
creative side of living. Cognition: once again, we have to distinguish between the
two temporal scales of diachronic emergence—the moment of negotiation. The
emergence with one of many potential roles takes the lead. The very moment of
being, there when something concrete and specific shows up while the gap turns a
breakdown.  There  is  a  rich  dynamic,  involving  concurrent  sub-identities,  and
agents envelop it in ethical know-how. The world we know is not pregiven. It is,
rather, enacted through our history of structural coupling, and the temporal hinges
that articulate an action are rooted in the number of alternative micro-rules that
are activated in each situation” (Protevi, 2009, pp. 105-106).
“Persons are resolutions of differentiating social fields, concretions of the social
fields that formed the effective typology of the persons, the patterns, thresholds,
and triggers of basic emotions or affective modules of fear, rage, joy, and so on as
they interact with the cognitive typology of the person: the cognitive module or
the basic coping mechanisms that make up the everyday repertoire of a person”
(Protevi, 2009, p. 107).
It  is  important  to  note  that  in  Varela  (1979)  there  is  a  notion  of  radical
embodiment.  There  are  three  dimensions:
“1.  Organismic  regulation  in  which  affect  appears  at  the  dimension  of
organization  is  regulation”;
“2.  Sensorimotor  coupling,”  of  the  “transient  neural  assemblies”  mediate  the
coordination  of  sensory-motor  forces  and  sensory-motor  coupling  with  the
environmental  constraints  and  modules,  this  neural  dynamics;  and
“3.  Intersubjective  interaction,  whereby  the  signal  of  the  affective  state  and
sensorimotor coupling acute play a huge part in social cognition” (Protevi, 2009,
p. 108).
The  relations  that  define  a  machine  as  a  unity  determine  the  dynamics  of
interactions and transformations. It may undergo, as such, a unity that we call the
“organization”  of  the  machine.  The  actual  relations  that  hold  between  the
components  that  integrate  a  concrete  machine  in  a  given  space  constitute  its
structure.

A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   17
Niklas Luhmann
Autopoiesis  is  a  viable  communication  concept,  and  it  is  applied  now  to  the
thinking  of  Elena  Esposito  in  her  articles  and  her  understanding  of  artificial
intelligence.  The  following  section  includes  direct  quotations  from  Esposito’s
(2017) work, which has been pivotal to the application of Luhmann’s theorizing
to AI. Esposito (2017) notes:
“Algorithms are SOCIAL agents. Their presence and role are now central and
indispensable  in  many  sectors  of  society,  both  as  tools  to  do  things  (such  as
machines)  and  as  communicative  partners.  Algorithms  are  involved  in
communication not only on the web, where the active role of bots is now taken for
granted,  but  also  (explicitly  or  not)  in  more  traditional  forms,  such  as  print
communication and even voice communication” (Esposito, 2017, pp. 249-250).
“The  participatory  web  invites  users  to  generate  their  own  video,  audio,  and
textual contents, which they share with other users in blogs, social media, wikis,
and on countless media sites. This multiplicity of spontaneous and uncontrolled
contents,  with  their  metadata,  adds  to  institutional  content  and  to  the  data
provided by pervasive sensors (the Internet of Things) to generate the increasing
mass (or cloud) of data available in digital format” (Esposito, 2017, p. 251).
“The protagonists in this alleged revolution are algorithms (Cardon, 2015), whose
advantage has always been that they do not require ‘creative’ thought in their
execution (Davis, 1958, p. xv). In algorithms and in the digital management of
data that rely on them, the processing and mapping of data have nothing to do
with understanding—indeed, in many cases, the claim that algorithms understand
would be quite an obstacle. The machine has other ways to test the correctness of
procedures” (Esposito, 2017, p. 252).
“In principle, the conclusion cannot be excluded that interaction with algorithms
is communication, but this must be specified. As we saw above, in the definition,
according to systems theory, communication does not consist of the thoughts of
the  participants,  so  theoretically,  it  can  also  include  participants  who  do  not
communicate  under  the  condition  that  the  recipient  thinks  they  do.  It  is  only
required that the unit information-utterance-understanding is accomplished, i.e.,
that the recipient understands specific information related to the communicative
intention of the counterparty in that event. Not only does the recipient understand
the information, he or she also knows (or thinks) that it was uttered by the partner,
and that it could be different (contingent). What is artificial is the perspective of
the partner that is produced by the algorithm starting from the perspectives of web
users. The algorithm uses them to create a different perspective” (Esposito, 2017,
p. 256).

18   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
The  communication  system  is  a  completely  closed  system  that  creates  the
components,  which  arise  through  communication  itself.  In  this  sense,  a
communication  system  is  an  autopoietic  system  that  produces  and  reproduces
everything that functions as a unity for the system through the system itself. Of
course, this can occur only in an environment and depending on environmental
restrictions. Only communication can control and repair communication, and it
can readily be seen in the practice of carrying out such reflexive operations. It is
extraordinarily demanding and is restricted by characteristics of the autopoiesis of
communication which has no goal nor end, no imminent entelechy. It occurs or
doesn’t  occur.  Communication  can  be  used  to  indicate  dissent;  strife  can  be
sought, and this depends entirely on the themes of communication of our partner.
Of course, communication is impossible without some consensus, but it is equally
impossible for it to be devoid of all dissent. What it necessarily presupposes is
that the question of consensus or dissent can be left aside concerning those themes
which  are,  momentarily,  not  topical.  Systems  theory  replaces  the  consensus-
directed entelechy. Another argument is that communication leads to a decision
where the uttered and understood communication is to be accepted or rejected,
and a message is to be believed or not. This is the first alternative created by
communication and with the risk of rejection. In this respect, all communication
involves a risk. The risk is a very important morphogenic factor because it leads
to the establishment of institutions to guarantee acceptability, even in the case of
improbable communication.
It  should  be  understood  that  all  communication  has  a  Gemini  component:
accessibility and understanding. Understanding is a critical process of the fabric
of communication. Communication is itself a selectivity process. Understanding is
a component of that selectivity. The selectivity of communication and the ongoing
Luhmannesque notion of sense-making in terms of passive and active synthesis
links  itself  to  temporality.  It  must  be  understood  that  such  communication
processes  are  deeply  phenomenological.  It  is  not  post-phenomenological.
Autopoiesis, according to Luhmann (1996), has modified Varela’s (1979) social
systems, which address these issues of autopoiesis. It must be further understood
that  Varela  (1979)  moves  to  the  notion  of  enactment  while  he  puts  aside  the
notion of autopoiesis, limiting it to cellular boundaries. He did indicate that he
was involved in something called “enaction”, a process of enacting the sense-
making process—the active/passive sides in phenomenology. Varela (1979) was
also cognizant, as was Luhmann (1996), in his understanding that there are issues
of  permanence  and  flux  that  have  to  be  taken  into  consideration.  These  are
important if one wants to understand the full process of a communication system
via phenomenology (Mickunas & Pilotta, 2014).

Introduction
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   19
Our text will bring forth the issues that we have outlined in this first chapter. The
following chapters may be understood as essays on the transcendental—or the
conditions for the possibility of artificial intelligence. Is there a resolution to the
problem  with  artificial  intelligence?  I  think  the  issue  must  be  more  broadly
understood. There is a pharmakon relationship that sort of moderates or, if you
will, balances AI. AI is an extension of our instrumental rationality, as we will
make clear. It is a part of the magical structure of communication. The pharmakon
is the pivot of dispensing poison and as well as creating self-remediation.
ETHICS
The evaluation of the framework of AI conditions does not exclude a dialogue on
risk. On the contrary, it makes it clear that rather improbable conditions have to
be met, but they are capable of being met if successful co-operation comes about.
These include acknowledging that risk is the basis of a dialogue about artificial
intelligence. On the one hand, the notion of practicality and security, although
buzzwords, have to be abandoned, and on the other hand, one has to be able to
consider living with the risk of AI. In other words, both sides have to give up
perceiving the problem as the risk/security schema. If they do not do so, there will
be an inevitable divergence on the question of whether they agree. Security or not,
one  cannot  renounce  the  notion.  Not  even  hypothetical  assumptions  of  the
opposite—that it is possible to correctly step in at any point in time. Instead, there
would have to be a continuous revisional position in relationship to risk and the
circumstances. One is assuming the risk becomes the most important source of
information, instead of naively trusting in the strength of arguments, are a really
apparent evidential force of facts themselves. Decision-makers can be trusted only
to be the self-constraint of one’s partner and discourse.
Whenever  a  weak  spot  in  society  is  suspected,  ethics  are  called  for,  be  it  in
research, economics, medicine, or political science. Whoever supports that fix can
count on the goodwill of others. Whoever invests in ethical funds can get good
money with a good conscience. Why not occupy a position that can be attacked
only at the cost of losing either one’s stake or faces, such as we might find in the
Gates  Fund,  and  other  kinds  of  goodwill  ethical  funds?  Even  a  superficial
overview must reveal that contact with the subject matter, that is, in the academic
tradition,  has  dealt  with  under  the  heading  of  “ethics”  has  been  lost  by  the
sickening  fact.  The  opposition  of  egoism  and  altruism  had  already  been
abandoned  in  the  eighteenth  century.  Ethics,  in  general,  serves  as  a  form  of
reaction in problem situations, backed by undeniably good intentions. However,
the professionals show remarkable restraint. Responsible conduct is recommended
(Murphy & Largacha-Martínez, 2021), but how to go about it when the problem
consists precisely in the fact that consequences cannot be anticipated. Or, one

20   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
adopts a maxim that one may behave in a risky manner as long as others are not
affected, but this only refers to a case that does not exist, or that, at any rate, does
not exist to the extent the one sees the problem is lying in the social costs. We
must  remember  politics  as  a  fundamental  sense-making  process  of
communication,  and  that  is  to  say,  continuous  synthesis  of  information
transmission comprehension reproduces a system from moment to moment. A
political system in modern society is more to be compared to a nervous system,
rather than an executive hierarchy, but we have no need to turn to extremes of this
sort.
CONCLUSION
AI  has  both  benefits  and  problems  in  its  applications  and  within  its  own
community of scientists, both in regard to its purpose and in regard to whether it
should mimic the human brain or some other dynamic. Hence, the way that the
truths of AI can be founded in the life-world of experience is a challenge. The
barriers to meaning, the confusion of how to understand the meaning, the meaning
of understanding, and the understanding of understanding become critical for AI
professionals and phenomenologists. The binary problem of the good and evil of
implementing  AI  needs  to  be  understood  on  a  non-binary  schema,  which
articulates the invariants and variants for the conditions of AI. We propose the
adventure  of  understanding  AI,  and  its  conditions  through  the  deployment  of
phenomenology,  which  is  best  suited  for  the  task.

CHAPTER 2
Phenomenology and Empirical Research
Abstract:  This  chapter  provides  the  reader  with  the  background  necessary  to
understanding  the  phenomenological  perspective  as  it  will  be  applied  to  artificial
intelligence  in  the  chapters  that  follow.  In  doing  so,  we  explain  phenomenology’s
approach to empirical facts and logical reasoning, among other topics. We explain the
key importance of awareness as a starting point for phenomenological understanding,
as well as the key role that the “thing” plays in this philosophy. The importance of
language to awareness is described, and the concept of signification is addressed in
relation to the creation of meaning. This brings the discussion around the importance of
applying a concept of embodiment as well as that of the linguistic field. The chapter
concludes with a brief discussion of how these concepts relate to the theme of artificial
intelligence and its relationship to the lived world.
Keywords: Awareness, Empiricism, Linguistic Fields, Meaning, Phenomenology,
Signification, Thing.
INTRODUCTION
The  value  of  AI—artificial  intelligence—cannot  be  overstated.  Some  have
claimed  that  it  has  created  a  world,  not  of  billions  of  people  or  millions  of
factories,  but  of  algorithms,  silent  computers,  and  smartphones,  forming  a
prognosis that AI will add 16 trillion dollars to the global economy in 10 years.
“Machine  learning”  seems  to  have  surpassed  human  capacities.  It  has  entered
every facet of contemporary global life. While it is regarded as a neutral, technical
means  for  communication,  production,  education,  commerce,  monitoring  of
public  behavior,  selling  propaganda,  entertainment,  global  positioning,  and
driverless cars, and thus empirically available, our discussion of this technology
will show its phenomenological requirements of “awareness”, which is hardly
“empirical”  or  “value  free”.  In  this  sense,  to  understand  AI,  this  volume  will
explore the complex levels of awareness on the side of humans and the ways that
such awareness is embodied in AI and taken for granted by any of its users—and
that means just about everybody. To disclose such, the phenomenon of awareness
requires close attendance to the arguments which are required to avoid confusion
between the various  levels  of  awareness,  among  which  only  one is  empirical,

and that is not even the most significant of them. For an introduction, a brief
explication of the way phenomenology works must be provided.
Although the term “phenomenology” has become a blanket for a multitude of
views,  subsuming  everything  that  is  not  science  in  the  strict  Anglo-American
usage of the term, it must be delimited strictly from the various views, inclusive
of  psychology,  humanism,  personalism,  dialectics,  sociology,  interpretation
theories and even ontology. Phenomenology does not oppose empirical studies
and  their  results.  What  it  opposes  is  the  “reductionism”  of  all  experience  to
empirical  experience.  It  shows,  for  example,  that  logic,  mathematics,  and  the
structures  of  meaning,  are  not  reducible  to  empirical  components  without  a
contradiction. It points out that scientists, engaged in their work, are excellent
phenomenologists, insofar as they deal with logic, mathematics, definitions of the
meaning of terms, and how all these factors relate to empirical experience. Yet, it
objects  when  the  same  scientists  proclaim  that  the  only  valid  experience  is
empirical,  i.e.,  direct  sense  perception.  After  all,  they  deal  with  logical  and
mathematical relationships, which, while not being empirical, are essential for
scientific  work.  In  many  cases,  scientists  trust  numbers  more  than  some
contingent, empirical facts. This is not to say that such relationships and structures
are subjective. No descriptive analysis of subjective psychological states, or their
explanation by chemical or genetic factors, can yield the logic and mathematics of
sciences. While the subjective states change and are not repeatable precisely, the
scientist is nonetheless capable of repeating the same logical and mathematical
judgments about the logical and mathematical relationships, irrespective of the
subjective states and empirical facts. This is most relevant for understanding AI,
since the latter is built on mathematical constructs, and algorithms, and not on
empirical  tinkering  with  gears  and  pulleys.  This  indicates  that  any  kind  of
humanism, personalism, and such, has no bearing on phenomenology. This is not
to say that phenomenology cannot deal with humanism or any other kind of “ism”
as its object of investigation. It is simply to say that they cannot be confused with
phenomenology.
THE DRAMATIC STRUCTURE OF AWARENESS
The first step in phenomenology consists of the exclusion of the metaphysical and
ontological  assumptions  of  existence.  This  is  not  to  say  that  phenomenology
doubts  whether  something  exists  or  not;  rather,  it  abstains  from  the  thematic
question  of  existence.  The  reason  for  this  abstention  consists  of  the
phenomenological aim to decipher awareness without prejudices in the following
way: In the most general sense, all awareness is prepositional. To have awareness
is to have an awareness of something or other. To see, is to see something, e.g., a
house.  To  make  a  logical  judgment  is  to  make  a  judgment  about  a  logical

24   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
structure. What phenomenology traces out is the “absolute correlation” between
the process of awareness and its object, and it does so in order to show what kind
of object requires what kind of awareness to access it. Both the awareness and the
object  of  awareness  must  be  analyzable  objectively.  This  implies  that  the
described  process  of  awareness  must  be  valid  for  anyone,  anytime,  and
everywhere.  For  example,  the  structure  of  awareness  of  a  material  object  is
possible only if the individual can perform certain functions, such as an ability to
move and thus constitute perspectives to the material object revealing the different
aspects and sides of the object. Whether one is a god, a human or a demon, in
order to deal with a material object, s/he will have to be able to perform certain
functions, describable objectively. If someone cannot perform those functions,
then, for humans, it is a subjective problem, and they will not be able to be aware
of a material object, and for a robot, it is a mechanical failure. Yet, this does not
abolish the objective requirements. Thus, the formation of perspectives, moving
around the material object, and seeing it from different sides, is not subjective or
personal; it is objectively general for anyone. We send satellites, equipped with
AI “awareness” to circle planets to see them from the other side and report what
they have “seen”. Whether it is human kinesthetic movement, or the movement of
a  satellite,  both  are  understood  in  terms  of  a  “generality”  of  what  movement
is—before “generalization”. This “before” can be understood by anyone: When a
child learns how to walk around a chair, she already learns how to walk around
the bed, the table, and does not have to learn how to move anew when faced with
a  tree,  a  house,  or  a  puppy.  Two  important  features  of  this  initial  kinesthetic
awareness  are:  One,  it  does  not  comprise  an  image  of  the  thing  as  its
representation, and two, it maintains any material thing as an invariant—identical.
The identity does not look like any feature, such as this “side”, or brown, or flat,
but  as  a  “vision”,  which  is  maintained  across  all  the  features  disclosed  by
movement around the thing. Any material thing we encounter and investigate will
be maintained as an invariant as long as we are interested in it. The identity is a
“generality” before empirical generalization.
Another  example  would  be  logic.  Logic  has  its  own  objective  structures  and
relationships, which are in no wise present empirically. In order to do logic, the
logician must be able to perform logical judgments, draw conclusions, and grasp
connections and procedures in terms of rules which must be adhered to. Whether
a  particular  person  can  perform  these  functions  is  a  subjective  problem.  Yet,
anytime and anywhere that anyone does logic, s/he must be able to perform the
functions required by logic. Such functions are objective, i.e., they do not imply
any subjective psychological or physiological introspection. Once again, the task
of phenomenology is to investigate the correlation between specific objectivities
and the required structures of awareness, which would allow objectivity to be pre-

sent to us. The concept of awareness must be understood in terms of structures
accessible to all.
To  speak  epistemologically,  human  awareness  is  a  necessary  function  for  the
understanding of the world, but in such a way that awareness is not subjective.
Even reflective self-awareness is something that is given as an awareness of some
event. Thus, when someone claims to be thinking, the immediate question would
be “thinking about what?” Moreover, while awareness belongs to many fields, it
is not derived from any of them. In turn, each field requires a proper activity of
awareness,  without  which  a  given  field  would  not  be  available  or  disclosed.
Whether it is physical, psychological, logical, or physiological, such fields require
specific access, and specific awareness, and the latter must be adequate for the
disclosure of each field. There is no doubt that various domains are present in any
given society or civilization, and philosophy has the task of investigating them all
prior  to  asking  a  question  as  to  their  “reality”  status,  since  to  determine  such
status, the access to awareness to such reality must be secured. For example, what
are the essential features of material things, and what sort of awareness is required
to disclose a material thing? The same holds for other domains, such as logic or
mathematics. The latter two require a very different awareness for their disclosure
than  a  material  thing;  after  all,  to  see  a  material  thing,  one  has  to  form
perspectives, move around the thing, see it from different sides and maintain it as
the same thing. Meanwhile, to focus on numbers, one cannot and need not form
perspectives, move around them and see them from different sides. One must
learn how to count, add, subtract, and so forth, irrespective of what kinds of things
one  may  count.  Thus,  we  can  use  a  variety  of  “objects”  as  examples  of
mathematical relationships: “two apples, three stars, one bird and four angels”
equal ten. This illustrates that mathematical awareness is not derived from things
and their causes, although a variety of things can be used as examples of numbers.
Moreover,  it  is  irrelevant  to  introduce  psychology  as  an  explanation  of
mathematics. Students are afraid of mathematical examinations but removing the
fear  will  not  help;  they  must  learn  the  required  activities  to  disclose  and
understand  mathematics.  Fears,  associations,  and  courage  may  be  various
hindrances or even encouragements, but by themselves, they will not change the
requirements  for  understanding  mathematics.  Thus,  when  counting  various
objects, we do not attend to their features, but see “through” them to mathematical
relationships.
THE ROLE OF EMPIRICAL FACTS
As suggested above, the structures of awareness and their objects are accessible
objectively  irrespective  of  time  and  place  and  of  any  subjective  states.  These
structures are, nonetheless, always correlated to empirical facts. In turn, every fact

26   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
can be correlated to a structure of awareness. For example, when we say that “All
facts are contingent”, the statement reveals a modality of awareness of all facts,
and  hence  it  is  correlated  to  any  empirical  fact.  This  does  not  mean  that  the
statement is derived from a cumulative addition of a series of facts; rather, it is a
structure of awareness within which any fact is understood, despite the variations
among  facts.  “Contingency”  is  not  a  generalization  from  particular  facts  to
universal  ideas,  since  various  generically  distinct  facts  can  be  seen  to  be
contingent. Moreover, the statement is in excess of any fact, since we have not yet
encountered all the facts in the universe. This is to say, empirical generalization is
limited by the notion that certain objects have certain characteristics defining such
objects. Yet, “contingency” is not a characteristic of a specific type of object with
specific characteristics; rather, it is a structure of “awareness of... any empirical
object”. This is the poetic and even dramatic side of awareness. We not only see
empirical facts, but we also see them “as…a general something”. Take another
example. To say that “I see a group of objects” does not involve generalization,
although any set of objects can be seen as a group. The “group” in this sense, is an
object of awareness which can be correlated to various empirical phenomena. We
would not know what is meant by a “group” if we did not have an empirical
awareness of a set of individual objects, yet the individuals would remain serially
disconnected if we did not have a correlative awareness of a “group”. There is a
“poetic vision” of a variety of objects as a group.
While “seeing” a “group” of individual objects, one must be able to correlate
actively various individuals into a collective unity and, at the same time to make a
judgment concerning the “essence” and properties of a “group”. This requirement
is definable objectively, and anyone who wishes to deal with a group of individual
objects  will  have  to  perform  such  activities.  Those  activities  are  always  and
necessarily related prepositionally to objects toward which they are oriented. The
objects and the activities are comprehensible only in such a correlation.
The  correlation  between  the  objective  sense  of  a  “group”  and  the  individual,
empirical factors is not causal, since the changes among the empirical factors do
not change the mode of awareness of them as a “group”. We can deal with a
group of soldiers, a group of birds, and a group of random objects inclusive of
imaginary and generically distinct objects. The facts and ideas do not cause our
awareness of them as a group. Rather, our activity is a correlate which arranges
the empirical factors in terms of a group. This is to say, since diverse kinds of
empirical entities can form a group, the latter is not a generalization from such
entities;  it  has  its  own  generality,  but  also  a  “vision”.  Yet,  this  activity  is
unnoticed for the most part, since it is always directed toward something objec-
tive. It  becomes noticed  only  upon reflection,  which  can  decipher  objectively

Phenomenology and Empirical Research
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   27
such an activity, and hence shows why a particular object or a set of objects is
seen as belonging to a particular structure.
The analysis of the empirical components requires the analysis of the objective
structure  under  which  such  components  are  regarded  and  reflectively,  what
activities  were  required  of  anyone  for  such  a  structure  to  be  correlated  to
empirical  components.  Such  structures—whether  we  are  cognizant  or  not,  are
incorporated  in  any  AI,  and  only  phenomenology  is  a  philosophy  which  can
decipher  such  structures  “objectively”  or,  more  generally,  as  accessible  to
anyone—globally. No doubt, there are numerous other general formations, such
as  constellations,  the  “Dipper”  (in  other  cultures  called  the  “Wagon”),  and
lines—including lines of trees, soldiers, or people waiting in a line for bread. An
important question might be whether AI “knows” a “group” or the numbers which
count the objects which human awareness gathers into a group. After all, a group
need  not  have  a  pattern,  such  as  a  line  or  a  wagon.  Indeed,  when  we  gather
various galaxies from diverse zones of the universe and group them under some
common feature, we do not offer their distribution in space as having a pattern,
although we assign “how many” of such galaxies belong to the group. The same
can be said of such notions as a “flock”, a “swarm”, or a “bunch”.
LANGUAGE AND AWARENESS
With any awareness, language has two fundamental axes, which are analyzable
into various components. The first axis is termed the “vertical”. It means that
language is always about something: when we speak, we speak about something,
regardless of the level of activity and objectivity that may be required for the
process of speaking (or writing). It involves a speaker who orients himself/herself
toward  something  and  selects  an  appropriate  vocabulary  from  the  treasury  of
language,  to  delimit  or  define  a  domain,  be  it  a  topic  such  as  “justice”  or  a
discussion of “systems theory” or the Big Bang Theory. Yet, principally, language
embodies  the  process  and  structure  of  awareness,  and  not  only  the  empirical
domain  to  which  such  awareness  and  its  structure  and  process  are  correlated.
What  this  means  is  that  terms,  while  oriented  to  the  empirical  phenomena,
embody the activity of the speaker and his/her orientation, and the experiential
object at the invariant level, e.g., “group”, “justice”, a “hypothesis”, and so on.
Although the linguistic process is partially empirical, e.g., noises, and marks on
paper,  the  empirical  components  express  the  objective  sense  of  the  eidetic
structures and the correlative activities of the speaker. One does not look at the
empirical  characteristics  of  the  noises  or  the  marks,  but  rather  sees  “through”
them directly to the objective sense and the speaker’s “level” of engagement with
objectivity. For example, while making a statement, the speaker’s terms carry the
objective sense of an eidetic structure, the empirical components to which this

28   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
structure is correlated, and the activity of the speaker, such as judgmental, logical,
and empirical.
What this means is that the term “group” does not point to or signify an eidetic
structure in terms of which the empirical components are experienced, but rather
embodies this structure. Thus, when dealing with the empirical objects as a group,
we  do  not  use  two  linguistic  terms,  one  referring  to  the  eidetic  structure  and
another  to  the  empirical  correlates;  rather,  the  term  “group”  signifies  the
collection of the individuals and at the same time embodies the eidetic structure.
This is why, in direct speaking, we have both the referred-to individuals and the
experiential  structure  at  the  same  time.  Language,  similar  to  the  experiential
process, is not noticed in speaking; it seems to efface itself before the signified.
Yet, in that effacement, it carries the experiential eidetic structures in terms of
which the individual, empirical factors are understood. This is one of the reasons
why  numerous  scholars  in  anthropology,  linguistics,  and  semiotics  claim  that
language  structures  “reality”.  Phenomenology,  of  course,  does  not  claim  that
language structures reality; rather, it claims that language embodies experiential
structures in terms of which reality is understood. For example, it is possible to
refer to the same empirical state of affairs as a “group of objects” or a “sum of
individuals”. The empirical phenomena remain the same, yet their objective sense
has  changed,  and  this  precisely  because  the  eidetic,  experiential  structures,
embodied  in  the  terms  “group”  and  “sum”  constitute  distinct  modalities  of
perceiving the empirical state of affairs. To extend this creative spontaneity of
awareness,  we  can  listen  to  scientists:  Let  us  look  at  all  phenomena
mathematically. Mathematics becomes a mode of awareness in terms of which all
phenomena  are  perceived—despite  their  radical,  qualitatively  categorized
differences.  Just  as  a  group,  a  constellation,  and  a  sum,  comprise  modes  of
awareness, so does mathematics, even if the latter is regarded as precise. All of
them are “constituted” to “mean” things of the world in their specific modalities.
The “meaning” is the way things are “intended” and is thus given to us in their
generality, independent of empirical causation. They signify—they are signitive.
Another  factor  of  the  vertical  axis  of  language  is  the  activity  required  of  the
speaker.  We  recall  that  the  activity  is  always  related  to  something  other  than
itself: It is prepositional. This activity is precisely what constitutes the orientation
to  the  objective  sense  of  the  eidetic  structures,  such  as  mathematics,  of  the
empirical phenomena. This is to say that the meaning of the empirical phenomena
is attained through the way in which the eidetic structures are “meant” by the
speaker. This is the reason for the question: “What do you mean by this term?”
Without losing its empirical correlation, the term, embodying the eidetic structure,
may  have  various  meanings  “intended”  by  the  speaker.  These  meanings  are
objective and accessible to anyone. They are not arbitrary, since they are ruled by

Phenomenology and Empirical Research
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   29
the objective sense of the eidetic structure. Let us look at the “objective sense”
called  material  thing.  It  requires,  as  mentioned  above,  forming  perspectives,
moving  around  the  thing  to  see  other  sides,  and  despite  these  variations,
maintaining the identity of the thing: I am walking around the “same” thing, given
from different perspectives and as a material thing, divisible into smaller parts,
equally accessible from different perspectives (even under a microscope). The
language of “perspectivity”, such that each perspective “means” the “same thing”
as material, is quite appropriate. But it cannot be extended into such irrational
claims  as  “from  my  perspective,  mathematics  is…”.  One  cannot  form  a
perspective toward mathematics, as if one could say that 2 + 2 = 4, seen from this
side, looks one way, and then, if one walks around this mathematical structure, it
will  look  different.  Mathematics  is  accessible  through  counting,  adding,
subtracting,  and  so  forth,  but  not  through  perspectives.  Phenomenologically
speaking,  the  entire  postmodern  swarm  of  “multi-perspectivists”,  dealing  with
everything as a perspective, is nonsense. The countless cultural figures, be they
divinities or goblins, cannot be seen from any perspective, precisely because we
cannot walk around images. Thus, awareness of them requires a very different
process.
The other axis, the diacritical or lateral, stems from “horizon” of the invariant
topic. This term means that any awareness is not closed upon itself, but always
implies more. The awareness of a thing, such as a table, implies a table in a room,
the  room  in  a  house,  the  house  on  the  street,  and  so  on.  Besides  this  spatial
horizon, there is the temporal horizon. While we see the table here and now, we
shall see the street after we leave the house. Our awareness of the present implies
the  horizons  of  the  past  and  future.  The  process  of  awareness  is,  therefore  a
spatial-temporal field which can be articulated laterally. The lateral articulation,
seen linguistically, means that every linguistic term is in a field of other terms.
The  term  not  only  signifies  the  empirical  states  of  affairs,  and  reveals  the
embodied  eidetic  structures,  but  also  assumes  that  each  linguistic  term  is
understandable only in relationship to other linguistic terms in the field. The terms
thus delimit the range of their signification only in relationship to other terms. The
meaning, in this sense, is not only the way terms signify the empirical domain, but
also the way terms relate to each other. Yet, the relationship between terms is not
arbitrary; it is ruled by the invariant topic, which determines which terms are
relevant and which are not. To use terms of lyric poetry to form a field for a
mathematically formed hypothesis would be just as nonsensical as to use such a
hypothesis to “explain” lyric poetry.
Terms  articulate  the  field  of  awareness  in  various  ways,  i.e.,  they  express
awareness as invariant structures and, correlatively, the modalities in terms of
which  the  empirical  factors  are  perceived.  Things  are  perceived  in  “groups”,

30   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
“sums”,  “hierarchies”,  spatial-temporal  “proximities”,  “logical  consistencies”,
“successions”, “higher and lower”, and so forth. If we were to take the terms
“higher” and “lower”, we would discover that the meaning of the term “high” (or
higher) does not make sense without the presence in the field of the term “low”
(or lower). The meaning of each is defined mutually; hence, the meaning of each
emerges “between” the terms. While this is an obvious case, the less obvious
cases follow the same principle. For example, in Anglo-Saxon the term “worm”
articulated a field which was delimited by terms such as “Vieh”, and included
everything from a worm to a dragon. This suggests that the study of awareness
imbedded  in  language,  and  the  empirical  phenomena  signified  by  such  terms,
must respect the diacritical articulation of a linguistic field and the interconnection
of invariant structures embodied in the linguistic terms. We can extend this notion
of embodiment to include the creation of modern technical systems: they, too, are
“languages”  imbedded  with  the  created  modes  of  awareness,  such  as
mathematical systems. When using a computer, we “read” through its empirical
features—the mode of awareness imbedded in this computer.
What phenomenology suggests is:
1.  The  so-called  empirical  reality  is  given  in  terms  of  awareness  structures
accessible  objectively,
2.  The  awareness  structures  are  embedded  in  the  linguistic  process,  which  is
articulated  diacritically,  and
3. We can no longer maintain the innocence, i.e., that linguistic terms are directly
significative of facts. Facts, empirical states of affairs, are articulated as a field of
awareness through language.
This implies that any empirical research must respect:
1. The structures of awareness,
2. The way that these structures are meant,
3. The manner in which the linguistic field articulates and embodies the awareness
structures, and
4. What kind of empirical phenomena can be used to exemplify the awareness and
linguistic structures.
This  is  to  say  that,  whenever  we  are  dealing  with  empirical  phenomena,  it  is
essential to raise the question concerning the modalities of awareness and the
linguistic fields in terms of which the phenomena make sense. No researcher can

Phenomenology and Empirical Research
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   31
maintain her innocence and claim that she is observing “pure empirical data”. The
data  are  highly  selected  along  the  eidetic  structures  of  awareness  and  their
linguistic articulations. Hence the researcher must be cognizant of his/her own
eidetic structures of awareness and linguistic process. This is not to say that the
researcher’s  awareness  structures  are  subjective.  As  already  discussed,  the
awareness  structures  are  accessible  to  all;  they  can  be  accepted,  contested,
rejected, and corrected. Yet, it is to be noted that the contestation does not occur
simply because the awareness structures do not correlate properly to empirical
phenomena.  Since  all  awareness  structures  are  related  to  empirical
exemplification, then they are at least partially covered by empirical factors. The
contestation occurs on the basis of other possible eidetic structures of experience,
which,  while  accessible  to  everyone,  yield  a  different  modality  of  seeing  the
phenomena  and,  indeed,  a  different  way  of  articulating  the  phenomena
linguistically.  Phenomenology  maintains  that  this  is  precisely  what  leads  to
scientific  progress.
LEVELS OF LINGUISTIC FIELDS
The diacritical conception of language, based on Husserl’s (1964) conceptions of
fields of awareness, elaborated by French phenomenologists such as Merleau-
Ponty (1968) and others, may be articulated along three axes:
1. The linguistic articulation of what is called natural phenomena, from rocks to
various living species, is quite instructive. The manner in which the linguistic
fields  articulate  the  natural  phenomena  is,  at  this  level,  directly  accessible  to
empirical observation. This means that, although the linguistic terms demarcate
the  differences  among  themselves  and  yield  different  meanings  by  which  the
natural phenomena are signified, such phenomena are directly observable, and the
different  articulations  are  noticeable  empirically.  For  example,  the  term
“elephant” is in Lithuanian “dramblys” and in Sanskrit “dubja”. While the two
latter terms articulate the fields differently, the first means “over-sagging dough”
while the latter means “two-mouthed”, there is an empirical-natural experience of
something  over-sagging  and  something  two-mouthed.  At  this  level,  the  field
differentiations take the same natural object and locate it differently in terms of
some of the natural characteristics of the object.
2. The field of technical implements: In this field, the linguistic terms signify most
directly and univocally, since the invented implements have specific purposes and
can be designated by agreed terms. One can write a technical manual and have
precise referents to linguistic terms. Although we can use various objects to pound
a  stick  into  the  ground,  the  invention  of  a  hammer  can  be  associated  with  a
specific term. The term then means primarily the specific implement and only

32   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
metaphorically  something  else.  Thus,  in  the  field  of  AI,  there  is  a  precise
construction  of  terms  to  designate  specific  technical  implements—and  each
becomes  a  part  of  the  global  vocabulary.  In  most  cases,  technical  products,
acquiring  a  specific  designation  in  any  part  of  the  world,  will  carry  such  a
designation to all parts—despite the efforts of local language purists to protect
their culture from infestation by “foreign” terms. Even the producers of a specific
technology  will  borrow  some  ancient  term,  which  would  be  univocal  and  not
mixed into the given linguistic field.
3.  The  field  of  the  cultural-spiritual  terms:  The  analysis  of  this  field  is  most
difficult, since there are no natural or implemental empirical correlates. When we
speak of “minds”, “scientific theories”, and “mathematical systems”, we find that
they are not only not derivable from empirical phenomena, but that they are given
in  no  other  way  except  through  and  with  the  linguistic  arrangement  of  terms.
Here, the only empirical component is the manner in which the signs are arranged.
Yet, the signs can be chosen at will. The most telling example would be non-
Euclidean  geometry.  In  Euclidean  geometry,  we  still  can  have  empirical
approximations of a line, circle, square, or triangle. We can draw them on the
board  or  at  least  imagine  them  empirically.  This,  of  course,  assumes  an
analytically constructed algebraic system of signs. This system does not allow any
imaginary or empirical correlates; it deals with algebraic coordination of signs
which  are  viewed  in  terms  of  pure  algebraic  attributes  (degrees,  equations,
number of parts, and such). The signs are taken here purely in themselves and the
manner of their arrangement. To the extent that the sign does not point to any
pregiven structure of awareness and its empirical correlates, the sign becomes
purely operational. The meaning of the signs is understandable purely from the
relationship among signs. This is obvious in the process of proof, where we do not
refer to any empirical domain, but rather deal purely with the ways that the signs
can be arranged serially. The structure of signs, as empirical, is here as irrelevant
as the color of a chalk we use to write the algebraic formulations. We can use
letters such as a + a + a + a . . ., or we can use numbers or any other invented set
of marks. What is important is that the structure of awareness emerges on the
basis of:
i. The arrangement of the signs, i.e., there is neither an eidetic structure which we
have prior to the arrangement of signs, nor an empirical set of factors to which
such signs correlate.
ii. The attribution of meaning to the signs.
4. This is to say that a Euclidean, imaginable stretch is given a different meaning
in non-Euclidean geometry, where the stretch is no longer imaginable but meant

Phenomenology and Empirical Research
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   33
algorithmically.  The  “meant”  is  a  poetically  constituted  vision  given  purely
through the signs, which means the vision as non-Euclidean geometry, and only
as a meant vision, since we shall never take a walk in the space of this geometry.
This could be called “the poetics of space”.
The empirical research at this level of awareness is reduced to the understanding
of how the signs are arranged. The very domain of objectivity emerges with the
arrangement of signs. If we abolish the sign-system, we abolish the domain of
objectivity.  What  is  important,  phenomenologically  speaking,  is  the  logico-
mathematical objective activities of the subject which attribute various meanings
to the signs; yet, the meaning attribution is not pregiven; rather, it also appears in
and through the creative-poetic arrangement of signs, including the possibility of
their variation.
Since a great deal of AI construction takes place at this cultural level, then the AI
researcher  must  engage  in  the  study  of  the  sign  systems  and  the  meaning
structures embodied in such systems. The signs are not distinct from the meaning
structures, and the meaning structures appear only in the arrangement of the signs.
Here, the user of a computer sees a set of marks, just as does the computer, except
the latter operates with the rules of sign arrangement, while the subject tacitly
introduces the meaning, i.e., the direction of signs as signifying something. The
only way that the empirical phenomena can function at this level of awareness is
metaphorical. This means that the meaning structures in the sign-systems do not
have  representatives  or  counterparts  in  the  empirical  domain,  although  this
domain  can  be  used  to  construct  metaphorical  examples  for  auxiliary
visualization.  This  is  to  say,  the  sequence  of  empirical  marks  shifts  to  a
background and the meaning of the user of the AI technology, which the marks
allow to appear, adds a world of orientations.
After discussing the ontological and metaphysical conditions of modern Western
philosophies, comprising the conditions for the appearance of AI, we shall offer
an analysis of the limitations of AI across various levels of awareness.
CONCLUSION
This introductory section has hardly hinted at the complexity of the relationship
between structures of awareness and the ways that the empirical domain enters
into  consideration;  for  example,  to  claim  that  there  are  general  empirical
propositions, which stem from the generalization of some empirical phenomena,
fails to account, on an empirical basis, for how such empirical marks, composing
a proposition, become “general”, without adding another domain of awareness
which is already “general”. Thus, even the propositions, written down or stated
orally, assume a given correlation between:

34   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
1. The invariant structures of awareness, and;
2.  The  empirical  domain  providing  examples.  The  correlations  are  extremely
complex. Even the singular empirical phenomenon has to be delimited in terms of
awareness structures, which are correlated to it. For example, the simple empirical
fact  as  a  color  is  given  within  the  structuration  of  duration,  perspectival
articulation, and linguistic fields within which such color is present. This is to say
that the empirical color is not just referred to by one term, e.g., blue. Blue is
different in different chromatic fields. Among light greens, it is dull, among bright
reds, it is sharp, and so forth.
An understanding of AI must respect the structures of awareness as parameters
within  which  the  empirical  data  are  present.  At  the  same  time,  it  must
contextualize the empirical factors within linguistic fields. Moreover, at the level
of  cultural  objectivity,  the  compositions  of  AI  must  forego  the  search  for
empirical correlates to the sign systems and deal with the relationships among the
signs and the meaning which emerges between the signs. And this includes the
“meaning  giving”  activities  of  the  researcher,  both  current  and  past,  for  the
understanding of the signs systems. And all this at the objective level excludes
such  psychological  notions  as  empathy,  internalization,  objectification,  and
projection of subjective states on empirical phenomena and their various levels.
Simply  stated,  our  explication  of  AI  is  a  venture  into  the  domain  of
“transcendental,  universal  awareness”.

CHAPTER 3
Communicative Competence: The Transcendental
And Understanding
Abstract: This chapter follows up on the central role of understanding in terms of the
need to understand methodologically and in practical life in order to achieve AI with
concrete limits. We cast this within the framework of communicative competence,
which  requires  both  understanding  as  well  as  the  reciprocal  relationship  of  the
part–whole. Communicative competence sets out a criterion for our investigation and
identifies a key human experience—“How did we get into this situation?” —which
requires  understanding,  distancing  from  the  situation,  surveying  the  situation
historically, and trying to anticipate where we go next. This critical understanding
and/or critical reflexivity is needed, which is thoroughly phenomenological.

INTRODUCTION
The term “understanding” has many essentially different meanings; it is beset
with ambiguities, equivocations, puzzles, and even paradoxes. A preview of the
difficulties and the different dimensions of the meaning of “understanding” can be
given in these preliminary remarks.
The many different meanings of the English term “understanding”, as well as the
term “Verstehen” in German, surface immediately with some reflections on what
can  be  understood,  I  can  understand—or  misunderstand  or  not  understand—a
mathematical  proof,  a  theory  in  one  of  the  natural  sciences,  a  myth,  a
philosophical system, a poem, a painting, a building, a law, the workings of a bus
system,  or  other  persons  and  their  motives,  intentions,  and  feelings—but  also
those of a non-human animal. Furthermore, we understand discourse, a foreign
language, but also the use of certain practical skills. The term “understanding”
seems  to  be  coextensive  with  the  whole  realm  of  cognitive  activities—in
phenomenological terms, with all sorts of intentional acts and active syntheses.
Since many such types can be distinguished, a typology is  necessary to sort out
the different  meanings of “understanding”, as well  as the  types  that  can be
 meaningfully  connected  with  hermeneutics  in the  sense of  tradition. But  still,

more distinctions are required to get at the roots of the puzzles and paradoxes
connected with understanding.
Genetic and generative foundations share some properties on the level of formal
universality, but there are some material distinctions that must be kept in mind.
Genetic  foundations  presuppose  the  basic  structures  of  subjective  inner  time-
consciousness. These structures are the basic formal presuppositions for the very
possibility of genetic foundations. Genetic foundations belong to the realm of
genetic phenomenology, better called the phenomenology of the genesis of habits
in the broadest sense and of the abilities to do something again, abilities that are
connected with habits. The genesis can be passive genesis, i.e., habit formation
without  any  participation  of  the  subject,  the  ego.  Passive  genesis  is  habit
formation  in  the  realm  of  the  unconscious.  Genesis  is  active  if  the  habits  are
acquired in the beginning with the aid of some subjective activity, e.g., attempts to
learn how to ride a bicycle. Finally, a genesis can be generative. It is generative if
it is grounded in an intersubjective activity creating forms of lived experience, life
expressions in general, and fixed life expressions in culture, e.g., creating tools,
buildings, poems, philosophies, social institutions, and so on.
Generative foundations presuppose the structures of intersubjective time in the
life-world. This time of lived experience is not the intersubjective time of natural
science, but it is of significance for the reconstruction of past lived experience.
There are types of basically pre-linguistic understanding occurring both on the
level  of  what  will  be  called  “rudimentary  understanding”  and  in  practical
activities of the life-world belonging to elementary understanding. The analysis of
such  foundations  of  higher  understanding  is  necessary  if  the  paradoxes  and
puzzles  connected  with  understanding  are  to  be  avoided  (Seebohm,  2015).
DISCOURSE
Interaction in elementary understanding is a determining factor for the genesis of
grammatical  structures  in  languages,  but  its  own  structures  are  by  no  means
determined by the grammatical structures of language qua language. This point is
of  significance  because  neglecting  it  or  denying  it  in  the  framework  of  some
speculative lingualism immediately leads to the denial of the presuppositions of
the  possibility  of  understanding,  especially  understanding  in  methodical
hermeneutics.
The  messages  of  understanding  and  information  are  bodily  life  expressions.
Bodily life expressions are signs. But they are indexes, not symbols, i.e., they are
actions  followed  by  reactions  of  the  other  living  body.  There  are  no  strict
universal  causal  laws  in  this  realm.  The  pattern  of  animal  interaction  is

Communicative Competence
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   37
nevertheless a pattern of action and reaction, cause and effect. Information-using
language in elementary understanding is different. The information refers to a
context that is already in-itself meaningful, because artifacts have the character of
symbols, of interpretants. Interpretants are connected with other interpretants, and
the web of meaning generated by interpretants points beyond the living present of
actual encounters. Language in elementary understanding is necessary to represent
contents that are not present yet are implied in the meaning context of a presently
given artifact. Discourse represents future interactions in commands and requests
and other types of linguistic information mentioned above.
It  is  pre-given  by  tradition,  experienced  and  learned  by  the  members  of  the
community. But the tradition as such is not known in elementary understanding; it
can be known and interpreted only in higher understanding. The creative potential
of individuals or subgroups of individuals in a community given in elementary
understanding  first  shows  up  in  disruptions  of  the  context  of  elementary
understanding.  The  necessary  repair  work  requires  the  invention  of  tools,  but
connected with it, new rules of behavior and changes in customs. The invention,
in  turn,  requires  a  transition  to  an  intermediated  use  of  higher  understanding,
thematizing  a  whole  context  of  elementary  understanding.  Human  invention
relevant for elementary understanding—creating new artifacts, and along with
this,  words  for  them  in  language—presupposes  tradition,  but  also  reveals  the
freedom  to  change  it.
Objective reality given in intersubjective rudimentary understanding is given as
an objective reality restricted to the boundaries of a shared living present with a
shared  space  of  places.  The  past  is  present  only  to  the  degree  in  which  it
determines the protentional horizon via second-order associations. The objective
reality of elementary understanding stretches beyond the living present in explicit
expectations and memories. This is possible because the system of artifacts is
already given as a system of interpretants that reaches beyond the immediately
presently given. In this way, humans have the ability to distance themselves from
the living present by living in expectation and memory. The realm of the absent is
present in the living present in expectation and memory.
HIGHER UNDERSTANDING AND CULTURAL TRADITION
Everyday  life  in  a  life-world  happens  within  the  framework  of  elementary
understanding.  Humans  act  in  this  realm  following  predetermined  patterns  of
interactions and “understanding how to do x” without understanding either the
pattern whole, or aspects of the whole transcending the immediate shared living
present, requirements, and its immediate expectations. This description is static
and stands as an abstractive methodical reduction. It disregards the circumstance

38   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
that  elementary  understanding  is  itself  a  creation  of  human  beings  and  is
continuously present in a tradition. Neither the pre-given pattern, the tradition
represented in it, nor the nature of generative creativity steadily modifying, and a
pattern is an intentional object of elementary understanding. The changes made in
the  pattern  are  generated  in  an  interplay  of  elementary  and/or  turning  to  the
transcending of the immediate understanding—interpretations providing higher
understanding  are  always  times  and  locations  for  such  possibilities  and  are
provided within the life-world. The use of language in discourse in elementary
understanding already presupposes a semiotic system of interpretations. But the
discourse creating the interpretations of higher understanding on interpretants is
of  a  higher  order.  It  not  only  presupposes  the  system  of  interpretants  of
elementary understanding but generates an additional web of further interpretants.
It is not involved in the process of elementary understanding; instead, it is a self-
contained interpretation of certain contexts of elementary understanding.
Thus, communication theory as a social science must, in order to justify itself, be
comprised  of  more  than  a  community  of  scientists.  A  hypothesis  cannot  be
corroborated  or  falsified  with  recourse  to  “pure”  observation  of  scientists
(subjects) upon objects. But, the objects of social science are co-subjects of the
social scientist who are of interest. The co-subject is not merely of interest as an
entity whose behavior is to be observed and explained, but primarily as a partner
in communication with each other. Therefore, social science fundamentally entails
the understanding of the intended meaning.
If the justification of science, in general, is recourse to a speech community, and
this means that rules (norms) can be followed and reflected upon among students,
then social science, given that their objects are co-subjects, must incorporate their
objects into their speech community. Therefore, the social scientist operates in a
participatory or a mutual interaction community. The social scientific community
criterion  in  order  to  reach  consensus,  must  incorporate  society  as  the  subject-
object  of  its  science.  Social  Science  and  the  field  of  communication  needs  to
justify itself on the basis of a speech community logic in which: (a) the scientist is
a  participant  as  well  as  observer,  and  (b)  the  object  of  communication
investigation  is  also  a  co-subject.  To  accomplish  this  task,  we  will  discuss:
1. The communication competence model as the condition for mutual interaction;
2.  The  structure  of  complementarity  or  synchronization  as  a  requirement  of
interpersonal  competence;
3. The reflection process upon the structure of interpersonal competence reveals
an  atemporal  or  invariant  structure  of  meaning  and  a  temporal  dimension  of
historical  mediation;

Communicative Competence

4.  The  structure  of  the  transcendental  (the  conditions  for  any  awareness)  and
tradition-mediation  (hermeneutics)  are  requirements  for  communicative
competence  as  a  three-valued  social  research  logic.
COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE AND SYNCHRONY
Communicative competence has been defined by Wiemann (1977) as:
Researchers  have  identified  consistently  three  dimensions  of  communicative
competence:
(1)  Empathy,  (2)  behavioral  flexibility,  that  is,  the  ability  to  choose  the  most
appropriate  role  for  oneself  to  play  from  among  all  available  roles  in  one’s
repertory;  and  (3)  interaction  management—the  skill  needed  to  carry  off  the
procedural aspects of a conversation in a satisfying way, e.g., not interrupting a
conversation partner.
The argument advanced by the advocates of communicative competence research
in our field is summarized aptly by Brandt (1979):
“Proponents of the communicative competence position maintain that in order for
persons to achieve social goals through communication, they must learn to enact
behavioral routines which are deemed appropriate to the particular individuals and
social situations where they are interacting” (p. 224).
If we look across these elements of competence, we find theoretical significance
qua philosophy of science. The key terms appropriate and interaction emphasize
an other-orientation based on social acceptability. This means that rules are not
formed in isolation but are to be based on the condition of commonality, which
can be followed and reflected upon. Communicative competence also emphasizes
the  flexibility  to  choose  a  role  appropriately.  This  emphasizes  a  self-reflexive
capacity as well as a quality that we term empathic. Empathy qua philosophy of
science is the attempt to “fill in” the subject-object gap. Empathy is a “filler”
because it is a part of the neo-positivist tradition, which still treats the co-subject
as  an  object.  Communicative  competence  focuses  upon  the  anthropological
capacities of being able to learn the appropriate conduct of a community. This
means that anthropologically, communicative competence as a strategy has as its
goal “survival of the species”: mutual (cooperative) interaction. Therefore, social
“The ability of an interactant to choose among available communicative behaviors
in order that he may successfully accomplish his own interpersonal goals during
an encounter while maintaining the face and line of his fellow interactants, within
the constraints of the situation” (p. 198).

40   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence

appropriateness reveals an intimate involvement and a synchrony that establishes
intersubjectivity but belongs to neither subject.
Merleau-Ponty  (1962)  summarizes  communicative  competence  as  a  form  of
intersubjective behavior by pointing out that speaking subjects project through
words a meaning which we apprehend bodily as an intention which our lived
bodies assume: “Taking up another’s intention is not thinking on my own part, but
a synchronizing of my existence, a transformation of my own being” (p. 184).
Thinking, and also speech, are already intersubjective in the sense that it is bodily
intentionality operative in a structure of behavior:
“The phonetic gesture brings about for both the speaking subject and his hearers,
a certain structural coordination of experience, a certain modulation of existence;
exactly  as  a  pattern  of  my  bodily  behavior  endows  objects  around  me  with  a
certain significance, for me and for others” (Merleau-Ponty, 1962, p. 193).
The social psychologist Ragnar Rommetveit (1974) characterized the structure of
synchrony in terms of a complementarity of encoding and decoding:
“The full-fledged act of verbal communication is thus under normal conditions
based  upon  a  reciprocally  endorsed  spontaneously  fulfilled  contract  of
complementarity: encoding is tacitly assumed to involve anticipatory decoding,
i.e.,  it  is  taken  for  granted  that  speech  is  continuously  listener  oriented  and
monitored in accordance with assumptions concerning a shared social world and
convergent  strategies  of  categorization.  Conversely—and  on  precisely  those
premises—decoding is tacitly assumed to be speaker-oriented and aiming at a
reconstruction of what the speaker intends to make known” (p. 55).
Rommetveit  points  out  that  anticipation  is  a  shared  temporality,  and  the
distinction between encoding and decoding are not mutually exclusive acts but are
simultaneous processes.
The importance of the encoding-decoding complementarity is that it disrupts the
dualism of self and other as an object of purpose, aims and affectivities. It also
disallows the rubric of objectivity and subjectivity constituted by the traditional
subject-object  dichotomy.  The  structure  of  complementarity  reveals  a
“commonness”  or  shared  temporality  as  well  as  a  monitoring  process.  The
monitoring process is constituted by a common meaning. The common meaning
constitutes  the  reiterable  and  atemporality  of  meaning  which  endures  across
temporally  variant  dimensions.  This  invariant  structure  of  meaning  is
characterized as accessible to all inasmuch as it is constituted through mutual inte-

raction.  The  relationship  between  meaning  (invariant)  and  synchrony  has
relevance  for  cultural  linguistics.
We realize that the project of communicative competence has developed in the
tradition of cultural linguistics and generally has been based on the pragmatic-
behavioral paradigm. Hence, the interaction of linguistics and meaning within the
communicative competence paradigm assumes that every utterance demands an
appropriate integration into a context.
Thus,  any  particular  element  of  a  culture  inevitably  refers  to  a  whole  that
establishes the meaning of those elements. There is a reciprocal relationship of
understanding obtained between a particular feature and the whole of which it is a
feature. The expression, while transparent with the meaning, must, at the same
time,  co-imply  other  expressions,  thus  composing  a  matrix  of  inter-connected
meanings  revealing  at  their  fundamental  level  the  manner  in  which  the
significance comprises a unitary world. Each expression, while manifesting the
basic cultural outline, implicates as well other expressions revealing the same
cultural  matrix.  One  significance  reveals  all  significances  and  cannot  be
completely understood without them, while all significances are implicitly present
in one significance. This is the basis for the understanding of cultural linguistics
as well as communicative competence. A word spoken in a sentence does not gain
its sense only from the relationships of the words within a sentence, rather the
sense also arises within a system of a total linguistic field carried by “tradition”
and  present  to  the  speaker  and  hearer.  Each  sentence  implicates  the  entire
language,  and  the  entire  language  is  manifest  in  each  sentence.  The  entire
linguistic field and all that it signifies must be present if the specific words and
sentences are to be understood, and they will be understood to the extent that the
linguistic  field  is  present.  This  is  the  cultural  basis  for  “communicative
competence”.
Benjamin Whorf has offered the thesis that a “grammar” of culture is reflected in
and shaped by the linguistic structures of a particular group. The “power” of the
word cannot be contested. In various cultures, it was invested with the divine
power  of  creation  itself.  Any  investigation  of  a  particular  cultural  world
necessitates the investigation of the “grammar” of a language used in that culture.
Yet,  while  the  logical  and  grammatico-structural  approaches  give  us  coherent
relationships among terms and their usages and their designations, they assume
that language expresses solely such relationships and designations. Indeed, such
designations include not only things but also ideas, images, beliefs, values and
other intangible aspects of the particular cultural world. Yet, language is more
than that.

42   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
While indicating things and topics, language also manifests the structuration of
experiences and perceptions which have a “life of their own”. Language reveals
that while states-of-affairs can remain the same, their experience may change.
Conversely,  although  empirical  conditions  may  change,  their  experience,
articulated  in  language,  may  remain  constant.  This  noncoincidence  between
language and the empirical, between experience and the empirical, suggests that
there is a complementarity between language and experience.
Language plays a crucial role in experience; its grammar does not always coincide
with  the  experiential  process.  There  is  a  variation  between  experience  and
linguistic  habits.  This  means  that  language  may  remain  constant  while  the
experience has changed, or conversely, experience may remain constant while
language  shifts.  This  also  can  be  said  with  respect  to  things,  as  noted  above.
Hence  what  a  propositional  language  cannot  express,  poetic  language  may
convey, dance may reveal, or artworks make visible. All these factors must be
accepted under the notion of “linguistic understanding”.
Language  has  a  “dialogical  medium”.  This  means  that  the  individual  in  this
medium is shaped and shapes others. The individual’s perceptions and those of
others  are  mutually  shaped  by  linguistic  interaction.  At  the  level  of  linguistic
interaction,  the  dialogical  medium  is  equivalent  to  the  structure  of
complementarity, which occurs at many levels. Non-verbal gestures and eye gazes
are instances of mutual interaction. Moreover, interaction dimensions include the
linguistic  significations  of  past  generations  embodied  in  styles  of  writing,
monument inscriptions, sayings and stories. Hence, language is to be understood
in its broadest sense to include any expression. Language, therefore, presupposes
the whole of a socio-history (temporality) and reveals itself as competent through
an atemporality given to itself.
The  model  of  mutual  interaction  based  on  common  meaning  (invariance)  and
mediated by the tradition of a particular speech community provides a model of
communicative competence as a criterion for social research. The model proposed
incorporates the complementarity of the transcendental region of phenomenology
and the hermeneutical orientation.
It is appropriate at this point to offer a definitional clarification of fundamental
terms employed in this book:
• Hermeneutics is human self-understanding based upon the embedded tradition
of a speech community.
•  Phenomenology  is  the  science  of  meaning-structures  (eidos)  which  are
accessible  to  anyone,  at  any  time.

Communicative Competence
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   43
•  Transcendental  is  the  region  of  meaning,  which  is  an  invariant,  atemporal
structure (The atemporal is used in the Greek sense of alpha-privativum, which is
an  intensification  of  time  rather  than  a  negative-prefix  which  signifies  a
deprivation  of  temporality).
THE LAW OF CONTRADICTION AND ITS LIMIT
Phenomenology emerged in the late nineteenth century within the controversy
concerning the foundations of science and logic. The explanatory power of the
method of the physical sciences had assumed such a dominance that the physical
sciences found themselves in the position to make claims of being the basis of all
objective knowledge. Any endeavor, desiring to assume the name of science, was
compelled to assume that the basis of all knowledge must lie in the empirical-
naturalistic  or  physicalistic  approach.  Following  this  lead,  sciences  such  as
psychology advanced the notion that since logic is fundamental to scientific work,
it too, should be based on empirically observable and describable facts.
The claim was human beings use logic in their scientific theories, therefore logic
should  be  based  on  the  empirically  observable  functions  of  human  beings.
Psychology,  being  the  empirical  study  of  human  mind  and  its  scientifically
decipherable laws, should assume the burden of being the foundational science of
logic. By implication, this also meant that psychology should be the basis of all
sciences, inasmuch as all sciences employ logical procedures in their theoretical
work.
This  proposed  foundation  means  that  the  laws  of  logic  and  even  mathematics
consist of generalizations of empirically observable psychological phenomena or
facts. We know that people can count, therefore numbers can be derived from the
fact of counting. We know that people see empirically one color at one time and
not two. Therefore, we can derive the notion that one thing cannot be blue and red
at the same time. If we generalize this notion from the various observations of our
empirical experience, we can derive the principle of non-contradiction: it is false
to say that the same thing can have two opposing characteristics at the same time
and in the same respect. This view can be completed by adding the concepts of
association and causality. The present blue color of a thing reminds me of, or is
associated  with,  the  previous  experiences  of  blue  and  not  red,  leading  to  the
notion that past experience is a corrective for the present and the present for the
past. This view is guaranteed by the notion of causality. The things and their
properties leave or cause impressions in the human experience. Hence, the blue
color causes one to see blue and not red, which allows one to correct experiences
by rechecking the source of the impression. I thought I saw  red, but  actually,  the

44   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
thing is blue. Therefore, the principle of contradiction is derived from empirical
observation.
This relationship of logical process to empirical phenomena seems to be tenuous.
For instance, when a mathematician deals with negative numbers, there are no
empirical  phenomena  to  correlate  with  or  even  a  memory  of  an  empirical
phenomenon,  which  correlates  to  a  negative  number.  Hence,  the  logic  of
mathematics  does  not  rest  on  empirical-psychological  observation.
It appears as well that the logic of meaning in the communicative event is not
based on the empirical-psychological either. The reasons are:
1. When we make the statement, “The storm is furious”, we may vary the sounds
empirically, we may say it in German, Chinese or French without changing the
meaning of the statement. We may say it slowly, rapidly, or we may stutter, but
across these variations, the meaning remains constant. The meaning is distinct
from the empirical modalities of its expression.
2.  In  the  process  of  making  the  statement,  we  may  have  various  changing
psychological attitudes: we may be elated, afraid, and indifferent, and we may
perform psychological associations with previously experienced storms in which
we were terrified; yet these psychological variations do not change the meaning of
the statement. It remains constant.
3. Even if in our vocal expressions, the psychological attitudes are manifest, such
as when one voices the statement indifferently, exuberantly, etc., one does not
change  the  meaning  of  the  statement.  We  merely  reveal  our  psychological
relationship to the storm. What is primarily communicated is meaning, whose
understanding  is  required  for  the  understanding  of  the  psychological  states
expressed  through  empirical  sounds  or  gestures.
Therefore, the logic of meaning is not derivable from the empirical, but it is a
logic that is invariant. This meaning logic testifies to the expression “we can say
the same thing in different ways”. Therefore, expression based on meaning logic
is never contradictory, even if the expression is empirically varied.
THE CANONS OF SCIENTIFIC LOGIC IN QUESTION
Most recently, within the sciences, the fundamental canons of science, the law of
non-contradiction and the law of the excluded middle have been put into question.
In the field of physics, mutual recognition of particles and waves, as delineated
through  the  Bohr-Heisenberg  formulation,  demands  a  logic  outside  of  the
traditional two-valued logic. This means that the logic of science has a rational

Communicative Competence
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   45
exclusivity, i.e., light either appears as a wave or as a particle is not an admissible
scientific  statement.  When  the  subject-object  dichotomy  is  maintained  in
communication  research,  it  leads  to  inherent  difficulties.
The attempt to account for conversational sequences as persons switch partners is
really nothing more than the question of how to get dyads from individuals. I take
this question to be a fundamental question in any theory of two-person interaction.
It is a simple matter to characterize the individual or dyadic interaction alone, but
it is no small matter to describe how dyadic interaction processes derive from the
styles of the individuals who make up the dyad (Cappella, 1980, pp. 130-145).
Eradication of this dualistic logic means that the dichotomy of subject-object is
philosophically untenable. The manifestation of light as a particle/wave means
that the particle/wave continuously and mutually explicates the phenomena. The
mutual  explication  of  phenomena  is  a  complementarity.  Complementarity
introduces  the  principle  of  “indeterminacy”  into  our  scientific  logic.
Indeterminacy methodologically means the world is inseparable from the view of
the subject.
Two-valued logic as the governing principle of cross-cultural studies has been
cited as a logic which occludes our investigations. In the article “Mass Media and
Politics”, Ithiel De Sola Pool (1963) comes to this conclusion:
“To evaluate assertions primarily by a criterion of objective truth is not a natural
way  of  doing  things;  it  is  one  of  the  peculiar  features  of  the  Graeco-Roman-
Western  tradition.  This  one  cultural  heritage  among  the  many  in  human
experience  has  tended  to  make  truth-value  the  main  test  of  the  validity  of
statements. And truth-value is a curious criterion. It is ruthlessly two-valued and
dominated by the excluded middle, something which classical Indian logic, for
example, never accepted; statement in the latter system could be simultaneously
both true and false. Western criteria of truth assume further that validity can be
tested independently of those doing the testing, provided that certain rituals of
procedures are followed” (p. 242).
Briefly, two-valued logic assumes (a) a definite point of view, and (b) a direct and
unambiguous  premise  which  proceeds  to  the  object  of  contemplation.  In  this
logic, two opposite statements cannot be true at the same time, thus there belongs
no  third  possibility  (tertium  non  datur).  This  is  the  famous  principle  of  non-
contradiction.  The  two  values  are:
1. Being: the existence of the object, and
2. Non-being

46   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
But as previously pointed out, two-valued logic is suspect, limited and culturally
bound. Some have pointed out that another logic is required, as in the case of the
Bohr-Heisenberg thesis. Today, in communication research, we have accepted the
metaphors  of  “openness”,  “indeterminacy”,  “possibility”,  and  “wholeness”  as
differentiated from potentiality and “qualitative” as desirable characteristics for
the  accomplishment  of  communication  science.  All  of  these  terms  suggest  a
power that has been hidden within the dominion of the two-valued system. These
metaphors  have  become  part  of  our  communication/community.  The
aforementioned twentieth-century accomplishments in the field of human studies
and in the queen of the sciences, physics, have placed new demands upon us to
develop a competent logic of inquiry appropriate to our field.
The  recognition  and  formulation  of  the  inadequacy  of  two-valued  logic  are
described  by  Leonard  Hawes  (1978):
“Communication  is  both  the  topic  of  research  as  well  as  the  resource  for
conducting  the  research.  The  implications  are  fascinating.  Communication
research is simultaneously referential and reflexive; our work refers to entities
outside of the work itself, and at the same time, the work is the embodiment of
much of what is being studied” (pp. 15-16).
The key terms are “as well as” and “simultaneously”. This formulation is not only
a positive description of communication research practices, but this recognition
demands  communicatively  competent  research  criteria,  which  delineates  the
condition  for  Hawes’  formulation.
The significance of the preceding developments has a consequence for the science
of communication. A logic of methodology is demanded in which objectivity and
the researcher are inextricable. This posits society as a totality, and the scientist
reflects within this totality. The whole is therefore presupposed before the analytic
parts are known. What are the consequences of communication theory?
Within  the  framework  of  strict  empirical  science,  theory  designates  the
interdependent  functions  of  relationships  which  are  formally  interpreted  as
variables  of  social  behavior.  “System”  and  “structural”  theories,  in  general,
attempt  to  cover  the  whole  social  fabric.  In  the  socio-scientific  models,  the
deduced relationships between the co-variable quanta are seen as elements of an
interdependent  system.  Yet  these  constructed  systems  are  not  identical  to  the
developing whole and its unfolding process. The concept of the system is totally
external to the analyzed as are the theoretical statements used to explicate the
area.  In  addition,  the  introduction  of  hypothetical  statements  guarantees  the
regularity of the area investigated. Therefore, theory must be “isomorphic” to the
area of application. On the basis of isomorphism, the correspondence between

Communicative Competence
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   47
theoretical statements and ontological reality is not known. Theories are at best a
schema of ordering which can be constructed at will and appear as valid for some
area when the theory successfully organizes the area.
Since theoretical constructions are not connected in any necessary way with the
ontological  region,  then  the  connection  needs  a  connector.  The  connection,
according to Jurgen Habermas (1971), is one of interest (to someone). Therefore,
the indifference of an objective system turns out not to be indifferent, and its
application does not give us empirical objectivity. This objectivity is determined
from the viewpoint of epistemological interest.
For scientific researchers to become aware that they do not deal with unqualified
data introduces the process of mediation. The scientific apparatus is social, and
therefore, we must already understand the objects we are about to investigate in
order  for  the  categories  to  remain  internal  to  the  object  investigated.  (This  is
meaning of an interpretive or communication community). Therefore, a logic is
needed which incorporates the recognition of the sociality of science as well as
scientists’ self-reflexive awareness of this situation. This logic we may call three-
valued,  which  is  formulated  by  “as  well  as”  or  “both  and”  (being-as-well-as-
non-being or both-being-and-non-being). To gain access to this logic, we will
employ the language of hermeneutics and phenomenology.
THE HERMENEUTICAL IMPERATIVE
If the human person is social and historical, is it possible to propose a social
theory  which  is  not  one  of  the  socio-historical  events?  The  appearance  of
hermeneutics  proposes  that  human  is  mediated  by  tradition,  and  the  idea  of  a
detached  science  is  in  question.  The  researcher  would  be  living  in  the  socio-
historical  process  immersed  in  the  environment  without  any  possibility  of
explicating the environment. The hermeneutical notion of society as historical
would  have  to  see  itself  quite  paradoxically  as  ahistorical.  This  means  that  it
would no longer be a historical understanding but a transcendental condition for
all understanding. The paradox can be represented by the following equation:
This means that for socio-historical understanding to become a condition for self-
understanding,  it  must  be  mediated  by  its  precondition  for  its  awareness;  the
precondition  is  transcendental.
hermeneutical   
= 
 socio-historical  
=

 asocial, ahistorical 
 
 atemporal 

48   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
We  find  ourselves  in  a  precarious  situation;  while  seeking  a  hermeneutical,
historical  explication  of  society,  we  assume  an  ahistorical  (transcendental)
vantage  point.  In  turn,  were  we  to  explicate  the  conditions  of  the  meaningful
propositions  concerning  social  life,  we  would  find  ourselves  in  a  position  of
extra-sociality in the transcendental attitude. Paradoxically, we would be engaged
in using means for our exposition, which are socio-historical. Regardless of the
attempts to constitute theoretical and even meta-theoretical structures of social
explication,  there  is  an  involvement  in  a  wider  socio-historical  region
inexhaustible  by  the  theoretical  stance.  The  understanding  of  society  is  not
completely  obtainable  through  a  socio-theoretical  logic,  nor  is  it  possible  to
conceive of it purely in hermeneutical-historical terms. Therefore, to ascertain
meaningful propositions concerning social communication, an understanding of
the  transcendental  as  well  as  its  incorporation  into  scientific  communication
research,  is  necessary.  The  scientific-theoretical  process,  in  my  opinion,  is  a
transcendental approach, which essentially accepts the name of “meta-theory” to
carry out its project.
WHAT IS THE TRANSCENDENTAL POSITION?
The immediacy of experience and the mediation of this experience stands in a
relationship of complementarity. In immediate experience, I am not aware that I
experience, but I deal comprehensively with things and their relationships. If I
reflect on my dealings, I distance myself from the immediacy of things but with
the possibility of the experience of things. Every theory of epistemology must
include a distancing and account for it if it is going to be an inclusive theory.
Experience  is  anonymous.  The  transcendental  position  brings  to  relief  the
conditions; the process of meaning which enables experience to take place. Our
thinking and knowledge in its “natural” orientation are at home with the things we
attempt to investigate and understand. The transcendental demands a distancing
from the natural immediacy; in this turn, we encounter the problem of how we
reflect  upon  this  immediacy.  This  is  the  problem  we  have  called  mediation.
Transcendental  understanding  simply  attempts  to  discover  the  meaning  of
experience. Therefore, as soon as we ask a question concerning the conditions of
meaning, we are in the transcendental region.
An  articulation  of  how  the  transcendental  functions  within  the  scientific
community will aid us in developing a vocabulary for scientific communication
theory.

AN EXPLICATION OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL: THE AHISTORICAL
AND ATEMPORAL
Phenomenology develops out of a critique of psychologism and is a part of the
heritage of transcendental philosophy. Transcendental philosophy is a reflection
on the possibility of objective knowledge and experience in an attempt to base all
sciences  on  the  insights  of  the  governing  principles  which  rule  each  possible
science. Specifically, in terms of Husserlian phenomenology, the transcendental
functions in the determination of meaning (or sense-making, as it is popularly
conceived). The transcendental articulation is mediated (handed down) through a
community  of  linguisticality  for  each  possible  science.  We  find  that  the
transcendental region is mediated by the “sense” or meaning of the speaker, the
things in question and a historical residue. This is not convention. Conventions
are already based on understanding. Therefore, a relativist position runs counter to
the facts of research and to the communication of such facts to members of the
scientific community and the public in general.
The  transcendental  functions  in  the  established  maxim  of  cultural  and  cross-
cultural studies: all methods of cultural investigations are based on comparison,
which includes such phrases as “it is different from ...” or “it can be understood as
...”.  Comparison  involves  sameness  and  difference.  This  means  that  the
determination  of  differences  by  which  a  culture  is  distinguished  from  other
cultures assumes a common aspect on the basis of which the differences are seen
as  differences.  Were  this  not  the  case,  what  one  would  have  are  differences
without any possibility to recognize them as differences from.... To recognize
differences, it is necessary either to assume one of the cultures as a base and
interpret  others  in  terms  of  it,  or  to  assume  common  features  across  various
cultures on the basis of which the variations are comprehensible. The first case
cannot be used in cross-cultural studies, since everything would be reduced to the
interpretation  of  the  components  of  one  culture  missing  the  structure  of  other
cultures.  The  only  solution  to  this  problem  is  to  show  that  while  cultures  are
different, they also have commonalities or a possible common dimension from
which they may be understood as different. This means that absoluteness and
relativity must be correlative.
The transcendental functions in the identification of data. For example, only on
the basis of the transcendental position can a datum be a possible explanation of
laws made through repeated experimentation and subsumed under categories. The
transcendental provides the limit for laws and the basis for inductive corrections
or falsifications. A datum which moves in an irreversible historical flow, as in the
case of field observation studies, is mediated through reflection. Here reflection is
not reflection on the “previous” sense data, but on the “reiterated” data, which are

50   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
eidetic in the language of phenomenology (We can repeat the data of yesterday
only with an identification of the data in terms of a comparative). Comparing two
data on the basis of a datum which is not on the same level as the ones being
compared demands a community of communication with a linguistic habit. If this
logic of identity is social, can we have an empirical social science as an objective
science? Positivism, by subsuming this question under the logic of science, cannot
be a language in either region. Both mediate each other and, in turn, are mediated.
Therefore, the possibility of social science objectivity is only secured through the
understanding  of  transcendental  logic  (It  is  impossible  to  transcend  socio-
historical events, but signification at the transcendental level is not correlative to
events, point for point).
The pragmatic-behavioral model of social science, which is the dominant model
in the field of communication, presupposes that meaning is identical (point for
point)  with  behavior,  or  the  sign  =  signified.  If  behavior  is  identical  to  its
meaning, then for the pragmatic-behavioral model to be inclusive, it would be
necessary to (a) reduce the observed social habits to a statistical average where
truth would be the way that the majority behaves (at least for the time being); and
(b) the investigators’ procedures would have to be reduced to a habitual pattern,
and the investigator would have to demonstrate whether he/she fits the pattern of
the  majority.  When  signification  is  identical  to  behavior,  as  in  the  pragmatic
behavioral  model  of  competence,  the  consequences  are:
1. It would be impossible to grasp any significance of behavior;
2. The behavior would be closed upon itself;
3. Socio-history is incomprehensible; and
4. Theory would be a behavior which is closed upon itself.
THE
 TRANSCENDENTAL
 FUNCTION
 IN
 SCIENTIFIC
PRESENTATION
Without the transcendental, the theory would correspond to the behavior of the
writer and to the “predictable social behavior” of one’s times. The significance of
socio-historical  events  cannot  be  explicated  in  terms  of  the  behavior  of  such
events  since  it  cannot  be  reduced  to,  or  become  identical  with,  the  historical
Anthropos  nor  to  his/her  historical  praxis.  This  means  that  the  hermeneutical
dimension is mediation. It delimits the significations appearing historically and
socially.  Since  the  significance  is  the  dimension  of  socio-historical  processes
constituting the condition for sense-making the understanding of historical events,
then the hermeneutical process mediates the transcendental region. Hence, the

Communicative Competence
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   51
transcendental is a condition for theory and praxis. Therefore, the transcendental
is ahistorical and atemporal (Privativum means “to attain a liberation from the
temporal or historical”).
COMPLEMENTARITY
 OF
 UNDERSTANDING
 AND
 THE
TRANSCENDENTAL
The transcendental signification would be impossible without the hermeneutical
aspect and would be reduced to the notion of conditions or categories without
change or influence. There would be a failure to appreciate the articulation of the
human event, which, in the process of temporal self-interpretation, is also:
1. The interpretation of significance (at the transcendental level);
2. The constitution of the socio-historical;
3. The constitution of reflexivity as a ground for the emergence of inter-subjective
relationships (Pilotta, 1979); and
4. The institution of a social region called “theoretical.”
We  must  keep  in  mind  that  the  self-interpretation  of  the  human  event  is  not
identical to the behavior of a specific human being. The specific human being
understands oneself within the historically mediated transcendental significance
constituting the temporality and the atemporality both of permanence and flux of
the individual. This means that reflection and social reflexivity are grounded in
the complementarity of hermeneutics and transcendental signification.
We must not fall into a naive historicism regarding the socio-historical process.
Only when we gain distance are we able to see our presuppositions which carry an
historical aspect of the tradition. To see our presuppositions as historical means
that we do not live in the same presuppositions we formally did. To gain such a
distance  and  to  be  able  to  relate  to  our  former  presuppositions  assumes  a
transcendental  posture.
Social science research based on communicative competence takes account of its
own historical processes and relates it to the transcendental region of signification
which in turn displays:
1. A “vertical distance” from the historicity of events; and
2. The reflexivity for the recognition of historical events (Gadamer, 1975).

52   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
The term “vertical” is employed to convey that the atemporal is perpendicular and
sweeps the horizontal stream of the community events.
When the transcendental signification is disregarded, the hermeneutical process
assumes an a priori stance without being aware of itself. It assumes a particular
historical period and its given events and treats it as if it were the transcendental
signification of all historical periods. We must be clear that the transcendental and
the hermeneutical aspects are given together. Theoretical reflections reveal one
possible hermeneutic of the transcendental signification and specify, at the same
time, a distance from the socio-historical processes and events. Any theory, seen
in  terms  of  its  transcendental  signification,  is  absolute.  Seen  in  terms  of  its
hermeneutics, it is relative to other theories. Therefore, the complementarity of
the transcendental and the hermeneutical are both absolute as well as relative.
Relative is a correlative to something which is absolute, and absolute makes sense
only in correlation to the relative.
We cannot take the mediating relationship between transcendental signification
and  hermeneutics  as  a  relationship  between  two  things.  The  transcendental  is
always  something  that  has  been  or  is  to  be  accomplished  through  the
hermeneutical  means.  What  is  accomplished  is  always  reflected  in  the
implications of the future or from the past, therefore, the mediation occurs outside
real  relationships.  If  this  were  not  the  case,  theoretical  thought  would  be
impossible since all theoretical relationships would be immersed in affectivity,
nor would we gain the necessary distance to theoretically make sense of socio-
historical events.
Hermeneutical criteria are based on the human condition. Whenever we ask a
question regarding the sense of social events, powers affecting our lives, or the
interpersonal  relations  among  groups,  the  question  points  to  transcendental
significance. This is a reflection on the question, “what is happening?” which is
the genesis of the theory.
The search for meaning at the transcendental level, to make sense of our socio-
cultural environment, constitutes tension between the interpretation of the factual
and  the  significant.  Humans  dwell  in  this  tension.  Concretely,  a  person  is
simultaneously  involved  yet  distanced  from  the  factual.  This  is  a  movement
toward  the  sense  region  revealing  a  particular  meaning:
1. Is not experienced in its totality;
2. It has a situational character; and

Communicative Competence
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   53
3.  It  is  oriented  which  establishes  the  here-to-there  relationship  (communi-
cability).
The structure of communicability that we presume suggests that if signification
were  purely  “interpretation”,  or  based  purely  on  the  school  of  pragmatic
communication,  then  interpersonal  communication  would  be  impossible.  Each
person situated in an empirical “here and now” would always be in a different
situation and would have to assume the task of repeating the behavior of the other
in order to grasp the meaning of the behavior. In fact, the situation of the other has
already shifted in its spatio-temporal structure.
CONCLUSION
Communicative competence is the condition for social science research. It is the
condition  which  enables  reflective  distance  and  the  ability  to  monitor  the
relationship  between  the  researcher  and  his/her  objects  (co-subjects)  of
investigations.  Every  investigation  presumes  a  complementarity  between  the
researcher and the researched, which is mediated by their respective traditions and
their  movement  toward  the  extrication  of  their  socio-historical  milieu.  The
movement  of  extrication  toward  the  transcendental  region  from  meaning  is
invariant  and  mediated  by  the  socio-historical.  The  relationship  between  the
transcendental and hermeneutics reveals a three-valued logic, which expands the
theory of “Scientia”. The expanded theory of science is based on acceptability
and appropriateness, which introduces to the communication community a social
science that is oriented to the determination of meaningful relationships in social
life. Therefore, the structure of the social science community is based on mutual
social interaction, which demands itself to be a science of thematic determination
(reflexive) and responsibility (socio-historical).

CHAPTER 4
Transcendental Self-Awareness and Time
Abstract: Chapter 4 further investigates the importance of time, and human awareness
of it, as that relates to artificial intelligence, apprehending time from a perspective that
emphasizes its similarities to any other “thing”. The chapter begins with a discussion of
the importance of a paradigm that prioritizes rational thought structures. Thus, the
discussion turns to questions of the "now" point, field awareness, and the nature of
causality, based on the philosophizing of Edmund Husserl. The issues of intentionality
and representationalism are addressed in relation to artificial intelligence as well as to
the self, the other, and social understanding in general.
Keywords: Being, Field, Thing, Instrumental Reason, Intentionality.
INTRODUCTION
For scientific-technical awareness, the Western metaphor of time and space is
most convenient. For our AI purposes, the discussion can be narrowed to time,
since  reflection  upon  any  topic  involves  such  questions  as  memory  and
expectation.  Indeed,  any  Western  discussion  of  awareness  always  involves
questions of time. Most likely, instrumental reason itself is premised on a specific
time interpretation which, as Kant (1958) noted, is a condition of any rational
judgment.  Even  contemporary  “deconstructionists”  of  reason  immediately  use
Western time interpretation as a basis for their claims. In turn, there are various
sciences attempting to devise means to measure the vastness of the universe, and
even the possibility of peering into the “beginning of time” and thus opening the
door to speculative mysticism. We do not challenge scientific claims—the latter
may  be  true  in  the  context  of  Western  time  awareness—rather,  the  task  of
articulating such awareness is required for the understanding of the ways that a
Self  becomes  a  reflective  medium  between  “ontological  reality”  and  the
metaphysics of science. There is no denying that the arguments presented in this
writing  are  also  based  on  reason  and,  ultimately,  on-time  awareness  or,  more
precisely, awareness of time. The latter suggests that time, as any other thing, has
some features which can be disclosed, pointed to, and discussed as any other thing
or event. One speaks quite freely about the passage, the flowing of time, and even
the  measuring of time. Astronomers are overjoyed by the  inventions of the  latest

instruments,  which  can  “measure”  fractions  of  a  second,  approaching  Zeno’s
quest to reach an indivisible point, the now at “infinity” (Diogenes Laertius, in
White, 2021).
METAPHYSICS OF REASON
Many philosophers have suggested that consciousness structures are coextensive
with specific space-time morphologies, not as variations of, or deviations from, an
identical  and  forever  valid  space-time  structure,  but  as  diverse  modes  of
awareness.  It  seems  that  the  only  space-time  structure  that  is  available  to  a
specific culture is its space-time awareness. The latter is the basic context within
whose  parameters  all  events—including  the  humans—are  interpreted.  In  this
sense, one specific space-time structure, designated as objective, is available, and
completely tied to the specific mode of thinking—the rational. The parameters of
this space-time awareness have framed Western metaphysics and ontology, i.e.,
the symbolic designs of ultimate reality and of the composition of nature, and
indeed set a stage for various theologies of teleological and eschatological types.
This is not to say that other types of awareness are irrational; they are equally
valid and are lived by members of other life-worlds. In this sense, what is known
as  reason  must  be  restricted  to  the  Western  life-world.  Others  have  different
modes  of  awareness  which  are  correlated  to  an  appropriate  “rationality”.
Due to such parameters, metaphysical and ontological thinking became tied to
specific prejudgments, above all, of thing and Being-In-The-World. This is not to
say that rational awareness could avoid other modes; to the contrary, all efforts in
the construction of metaphysics and ontology were and continue to be founded on
the tacit and continuous presence of dimensional awareness. Yet, this presence, in
its rational interpretation, led to the reification and finally to the flattening of the
cosmos.  Again,  this  is  not  to  imply  that  this  process  was  initiated  by  some
malignant  genius;  rather,  given  the  specific  interpretation  of  time  and  space,
regarded as rational awareness, the reduction of all events, including the human to
positioned things, could hardly be avoided. This also suggests that this space-time
awareness lends priority to discrete positions in which things can be regarded as
stable  and  can  be  located  at  any  position  without  losing  their  identity.  The
founding,  permanent  position  is  the  eternal  indivisible  now,  resulting  in  the
ontological awareness that a thing is always now and identical with itself. Once
this thing is granted permanence, then it can be at any point in time and any point
in space, ending with classical proclamations that space and time dimensions play
no essential role in the understanding of a thing—they are accidental for rational
understanding of nature. Lending preeminence to the permanence of substantial
things  and  their  relationships,  traditional  reason  reflects  the  flattening  of  the
universe  into  a  three-dimensional  box  in  which  identifiable  things  can  move.

Transcendental Self-Awareness and Time
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   57
Attributing preeminence to things—and by extension to Being—and in modernity
to reified reality and the metaphysics of formal instrumental reason, allows the
presumption that as things and material objects, so can the worldly dimensions of
space-time be regarded as "objects", although inessential among other objects. If
things are constantly in time, in space, then this very in-herence does not make an
essential difference to the things that are in. It is a world not unlike a beehive in
which identifiable bees can be at any location, yet such a location does not change
a bee. While modern reification of nature led to the positing of atomic and sub-
atomic building blocks, the latter is equally in space-time-movement. This form of
reification  was  and  continues  to  be  a  major  catalyst  for  the  appearance  of
instrumental reason as a counterpart to quantifiable matter. This will be explained
shortly in this chapter.
The priority of the now and the thing that allows the appearance of the world as
spacial and temporal might even preclude the existence of time. The future is not
yet, and the past is no longer; the present is a point between them, and hence the
dimensions of the world do not exist. Yet even the now embodies a paradox:
Since it is not a stretch but a point between past and future, it cannot exist; it is
nothing.  We  are  facing  a  curiosity:  The  past,  the  present,  and  the  future  are
nothing. Hence, what are we talking about when we speak of time? How can one
measure and have stretches and continuities of nothing? It is the case that when
we speak of such stretches, we use a spatial metaphor in such a way that, given
spatial distances, we can measure them; but how can one measure what is either
no longer or not yet? We may be able to measure spatial distances to the extent
that  we  may  presume  returning  to  the  same  place—even  if  this  returning  is
problematic—but how can we return to the no longer? This paradox is the catalyst
for  the  search  for  a  locus  where  time  can  be  given  and  measured.  After  all,
measuring assumes that what we measure must be. Even if the no longer and not
yet were to be regarded as not something that is not, but as something that is
empty, i.e., empty time and empty space, we would be in a quandary to speak of
directions in such an empty container. Emptiness discards the very understanding
of world and returns us back to the nothingness of this world. All this leads to the
efforts, as already mentioned, to locate time.
In one instance, there are various metaphysical efforts to locate and guarantee the
continuity of the world by some ultimate Being. Since things and their continuity
are  deployed  in  a  temporal  sequence  of  movements  and  locations,  this  very
continuity must be guaranteed by some metaphysical powers that are deemed to
be the glue of the succession. This is to say, since the now point has no extension,
then  there  appears  an  abyss  between  the  now  and  the  next  moment.  If  the
continuity  is  threatened  by  fragmentation,  then  one  introduces  something  tran-

58   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
scendent  to  fill  the  gap  left  by  the  metaphysical  timeless  formalisms  and
ontological,  i.e.,  rational,  covering-over  of  the  cosmos.
Although  such  metaphysics  avoids  the  pure  linearity  of  temporal  points  by
locating  them  in  an  eternal  being,  the  latter,  as  eternal,  does  not  allow  us  to
understand the various modalities of experiencing time. Eternity excludes such
questions. To say that it is eternal, is to say that it is opposed to temporal and thus
to return to the rational mode of awareness. Such an awareness reestablishes a
metaphysical way of reflecting all phenomena from the background of eternity.
Thus, for the modern West, mathematical and formal definitions are eternal, and
are  in  no  position  to  deal  with  a  cosmos  that  involves  the  continuity  of  time.
While scientists and others may say that numbers do not lie, they do not have
anything to say about time, unless one accepts the fragmentation discussed above.
It is clear that, regardless of how many mathematical points one may add, one will
not derive extension or duration from them. Thus, the mathematical measure of
time is completely impossible.
FIELD AWARENESS
Having encountered the origins of the modern subject as the source of Western
AI, the subject itself being the metaphysical source of AI, which does not belong
in the scheme of natural Logos, we must raise the question concerning its ultimate
constitution.  We  must  remember  that  for  the  modern  West  and  its  atomistic
ontology, the subject does not exist; if it is not physical, then it is deemed to be
metaphysical. At this metaphysical level, whatever the subject constructs, it is not
in the ontological, “physical” time, which is also the condition for the modern
notion of causality as a sequence of events “one after the other”. Neither AI nor its
progress  would  be  conceivable  without  the  presumption  of  such  time.  But  AI
requires “time awareness” which must transgress the physical time in order to be
able to construct “projects” which dominate all scientific theories, methods, and
hypotheses. In short, if the metaphysical modern subject is autonomous, then its
time  awareness  cannot  be  a  part  of  the  physical  time.  In  principle,  AI  is  a
conjunction  of  physical  time  and  transcendental  time,  allowing  AI  to  be  an
embodiment of atemporal discourses which “speak” to the subject who cannot be
limited by any discourse manifest in any AI. Autonomy is premised on awareness
which  transgresses  the  positional,  physical  time.  Husserl’s  phenomenological
method is by now well-known, even if controversial, and need not be repeated one
more time. His ultimate concern is to offer an account for it as a transcendental
condition of time, including the ways that the modern “subject” is the source of
“scientific”, hypothetical, and many other “projects”—and the latter requires an
implicit time awareness. At the outset of his lectures on time, Husserl (1964)
delimits the appropriate sphere of temporal phenomena by the complete exclusion

Transcendental Self-Awareness and Time
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   59
of every assumption, stipulation, and conviction with respect to objective time
(the total exclusion of all transcending—internal and external—presuppositions
concerning what exists). For Husserl, a rigorous phenomenological analysis of
time begins not with the “awareness of time,” but with the description of time
awareness.  His  phenomenology  of  internal  time-consciousness  is  thus  the
exhibition of the immanent time as the flow of consciousness, not the progressive
time of the modern, scientific world. Given this methodological decision, that
distinguishes his investigations of time awareness, Husserl insists that time, as it
is  immediately  given,  is  “lived”  or  a  “living”  present.  The  latter  cannot  be
bracketed without a contradiction and thus must comprise a point of departure for
disclosing  “time  awareness”.  The  directly  living  present  manifests  two
fundamental moments—the flowing and the static. While enacting the flow, the
self  is  confronted  with  the  missing  aspect—the  permanent.  The  permanent  is
excluded from, and yet referred to, by the flow. While flowing, the self is engaged
in countering a stasis. On the other hand, while the self assumes a position of
permanence,  it  is  referred  to  as  a  flow.  The  standing  forever  battles  the  flux.
While being exclusive, neither can be given without the other. They are mutually
referent. What is at issue in the quest for Self and its identity with respect to time
awareness is the access to these two moments of the living present and their most
diverse relationships. It is to be noted that the relationship between permanence
and flux is never given in its purity; it is always mediated by symbolic designs of
a  given  culture,  such  as  Augustine’s  notion  of  soul  (2002).  Thus,  with  the
questions  concerning  self  and  ego,  those  two  terms  will  comprise  symbolic
tandems  of  the  two  basic  facets  of  the  living  present.
First,  there  is  the  problem  of  the  primordial,  passive  stream,  the  “Heraclitean
flow” as a fundamental domain of awareness, for whose constitutive moments we
lack names; there is nothing found in the flow that would be an objective identity.
Names,  after  all,  apply  only  to  the  constituted  and  available  identities,  to
objectified sense units. Such units, such identities, rudimentary components of
reference, are discovered only in reflection that traces something constituted in
the flux, such as an identity of a color, a sound, a trace of smell, a number, or an
ego. All may find themselves and be seen as identical or constant in the flow.
They are apparent as stasis moments. An ego, at this level of awareness, also
appears in the flow as self-same or identical. A note of caution must be added:
The  self  that  symbolizes  the  enactment  of  the  flow  does  not  encounter  the
permanent ego due to reflection, but due to the very composition of the flow that
immediately calls up its mutual and yet exclusive referent—the stasis. At this
level, the moment of stasis can only be constituted as a recognizable act of the self
that is flowing away and is given a symbolic designation—ego. The ego marks a
distance between the acting self and its own enactments. In their static identifiabi-

Mickunas and Pilotta
lity,  the  latter  refers  to  the  flux  enacted  by  the  self,  and  they  exhibit  a
characteristic  that  is  different  and  exclusive  of  the  self.
This context suggests that the self cannot be exhausted by the identifiable act that
is symbolized as an act of ego. And yet, the ego is present as a reflected self prior
to an act of reflection. The self recognizes, in the ego, one of its accomplished
acts.  The  identity  of  the  self  that  enacts  the  flow  is  not  that  of  the  ego  as  a
stasis—a stasis that can be discovered in the flow. In this sense, the self is not
reducible to a nameable ego or even to a recognizable act of the self. The self that
constitutes the flow is anonymous, and its anonymity cannot be eradicated by
reference to an ego found in the flux. The problem, thus, emerges concerning the
access, if any, to the primordially acting self. It was noted that the presence of the
experienced ego in the flow to the experiencing self reveals a distance between
them, a distance that is the very condition of such an experience. This distance
must  be  understood  within  the  limits  of  the  living  present  and  its  two  self-
referring  features.  This  present  cannot  be  understood  in  an  ordinary,  i.e.,
ontological or psychological sense; the present of the self is not given on the basis
of  a  presupposed  temporal  position.  A  radical  reflection  also  excludes  the
preconception of temporal succession. The present of the self, its presence, could
be called ur-modal, atemporal, or self-originating. Any temporal regard requires
an identifiable point of a reference appearing in the flow of awareness. If the ego
marks the first identifiable act in the flow, then the distance between the self and
the ego is equally atemporal. At this level of awareness, there are no traces of any
memory that would hint at temporal locations. One might wonder, what does such
disclosure of self and others have to do with AI? Two points: At the outset, all the
explanations  by  various  disciplines  of  human  in  terms  of  causes,  physical,
economic, psychological, physiological... would fail to encompass the subject.
Additionally, communication by anyone, including the scientist, with others as
equivalent  to  the  subject,  is  only  possible  on  the  basis  of  transcendental  time
awareness. One talks with Newton about the laws of gravity, not because Newton
is present across the table, but as an extension of the scientist’s awareness through
the way Newton sees the world: mathematically, and hence prior to physical time,
which has already abolished physical Newton. At this level of awareness, we are
already  “intersubjective,”  prior  to  the  question  when  and  where  the  other  is.
Temporal locations arise on the basis of this intersubjectivity. Having discussed
gravity with Newton’s mathematical view of it, we can raise the question: When
did Newton formulate his mathematical awareness?
Having  addressed  the  question  of  intersubjectivity,  where  the  Other  is  never
absent from the understanding of the Self, we must notice immediately that the
Self, in the encounter of the Other, is engaged in primal “intentionality”: it is an
orientation  toward  someone  with  respect  to  something,  some  objectivity,  or  a

Transcendental Self-Awareness and Time
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   61
topic of interest. The very orientation is not just a “looking at” the other as some
object, but also as an “intentional” agent—Another Self who is oriented toward
something. If one wants to grasp what the Other is, one must attend to what the
Other  is  doing,  what  she  is  thinking  about,  how  she  is  comporting  toward
something, some task, or solving some problem. The encounter of the Other is
equivalent to an encounter of an oriented subject such that the orientation points
to, means, something as an intentional concern. Even in cases of Self, interpreting
itself as an Ego, the Self will find this orientation toward the Ego unavoidable.
“How could I have done this yesterday to James at the meeting?” To understand
even myself in the sense of the Other, I must understand this world orientation,
this intentional correlation to something. It is necessary, then, to engage in a brief
delimitation of “intentionality”. While it was discussed in the second chapter,
some views about it must be clarified. It has been a part of a long history of
debate about intentionality, maintaining a common claim that intentionality is a
fundamental signifying function of awareness; it means something or other. The
qualification of intentionality, in the context of intersubjectivity, is sense-making.
A close survey of this phrase offers an added picture. The term intentionality does
not designate a pregiven state of affairs, but rather stakes out a field. Thus, it is
necessary  to  point  out  that  the  common  definition  of  intentionality  as
“consciousness of” is more than the notion of “intentional action,” or “deliberate
engagement”. Such designations are still burdened by traditions of metaphysical
clashes  between  proponents  of  determinism  and  freedoms.  Even  if  it  were
possible  to  regard  intentionality  as  a  function  of  wanting  or  willing,  analyses
would show that these terms presume a more “neutral” delimitation and another
level of intentionality that can analyze “will” or “wants”.
Such  a  delimitation  is  shaped  by  the  discovery  and  analyses  of  a  correlation
between  universal  requirements  on  anyone’s  part  and  the  structure  of  a  given
object,  irrespective  of  its  ontological  status.  The  use  of  the  term  correlation
instead of relationship suggests a difference between a one-to-one, i.e., act-to-
object structure and a one-to-process composition. In this sense, the object must
be regarded as a constant, while the correlation to it may be variable. In turn, the
correlation may be constant, while the “object” may be variable. To see is to see
something, to judge the same thing, to use it as a support for a hypothesis, to
employ it for practical purposes, or even as a basis of theoretical interrogation.
The  object  need  not  be  a  “natural”  entity.  It  can  be  a  numerical  system,  an
emotion,  a  complex  state  of  affairs,  or  a  problem  to  be  resolved.  All  such
“objects” can be maintained as identical, while our correlations to them can vary.
The numerical system can be judged concerning its value for some task, or it can
lead to speculative metaphysics with respect to the “whereabouts” of the existence
of  numbers.  Such  correlational  variations  can  be  subsumed  under  the  term
“intentionality”.

There is a methodological requirement to deflect any opposition from culturally
committed explanations with claims that awareness is either shaped by a cultural
sign  system  or  by  some  psychological  states  inherent  in  the  human  natural
constitution. After all, some would argue that “intentional analyses” belong to the
mind or internal states, which, while not regarded causally, are at the base of
human understanding. We want to show that such reductionisms miss the point of
their  own  positions  to  the  extent  that  they  assume  a  diversity  of  types  of
intentionalities  and  their  correlation  to  distinct  kinds  of  objects,  including  the
object called to mind and its meant internal composition. This is to say, we can
show  that  transcendental  polycentric  awareness  is  more  objective  than  the
positions  offered  by  its  cultural  opponents.  The  sense  of  a  specific  type  of
objectivity sets the parameters for the structure of intentionalities, and both can be
regarded  purely  objectively.  In  short,  the  structure  of  the  object  is  decisive
concerning the objectivity of the intentional functions correlating to it. No doubt,
this correlation can be highly complex, requiring careful analyses, yet in principle,
such  correlation  is  objective.  It  could  be  said  that  this  mode  of  analysis  of
intentionality  is  a  non-speculative  and  non-reductionist  positivism.
An objective analysis initially extricates two levels of intentional correlation: the
matter  of  fact  and  the  various  ways  of  accessing  the  essence  of  the  factual.
Essence,  here,  is  not  ontological,  but  a  structural  feature  of  a  sense-making
process focused on the factual, comprising, at the cultural level, selected means of
expressing  the  factual.  The  cultural  meanings  must  not  be  confused  with
generalized  matters  of  fact—without  denying  them—since  such  meanings
disregard the boundaries of typological designations of matters of fact. Thus, “I
see a group of objects” disregards the general features of matters of fact, since the
group can consist of generically diverse objects. Yet, it is not an a priori concept
in  a  posited  entity  called  mind.  Not  to  speak  of  the  irresolvable  dilemmas
concerning the “application” of the a priori concepts to singular cases, there is
equally a sticky problem of reintroducing the question of “meaning” as inherent in
the culture. How could one presume that a variety of individual objects could, in a
flash, assume a “meaning”? These difficulties could be avoided with a turn to an
intentionality  capable  of  accessing  cultural  aspects  as  intentional  meanings  of
transcendental constitution of awareness. For example, a particular arrangement
of objects, without regard to their generic characteristics, may be seen as a group,
as a sum of individuals, or as discrete entities. Neither is a generalized category
but a transcendental mode of signifying. It is neither a particular nor a universal,
and yet, it has its own generality accessible to any communication researcher.
It  should  be  obvious  that  intentionality,  regarded  in  this  manner,  is  not
representational,  imagistic,  or  conceptual.  This  is  to  say,  it  does  not  copy  the
object, does not look like the object, and is in no particular state of substantively

Transcendental Self-Awareness and Time
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   63
conceived awareness. This avoids a type of psychological assumption—modern
representationalism that, as a part of modern Western cultural language, is a block
to understanding intersubjective awareness. Such a thesis requires that you and I
guarantee  that  both  of  us  have  the  same  internal  states  expressed  in  different
languages and causally related to the “same thing”. In brief, my image in me and
your image in you must be accessed as alike before we can claim mutual access to
one  another  or  to  the  topics  and  objects  to  which  we  refer.  Hence,  there  are
inventions  to  fill  this  intersubjective  and  even  personal  gap:  one  speaks  of
empathy, of similar physiological, biological, and such constructions, of being
part of the evolution of the same species. Activities of awareness, correlated to
given objects of intersubjective awareness, as ways of addressing matters of fact,
are neither inner nor outer, neither similar to the objects under consideration nor
their  inner  counterparts  or  images.  They  are  correlational.  Such  a  correlation
extends all the way to theories as modes of anyone’s awareness accessible to all.
One  can  say,  “Let  us  regard  the  world  as  a  sum  of  material  parts”  or  “as  a
projection of ideas” without raising the question of which of these regards is true.
Both can be deemed to be ways of making sense and accessible for debate, so
well manifested in the debates across various historical periods among numerous
figures—debates  in  which  we  still  participate  with  regard  to  the  “emergent”
qualities  of  living  forms  in  evolution  or  in  social  settings.
This kind of understanding of correlation excludes presumed distinctions between
mentalism,  such  as  a  conscious  activity  in  contrast  to  motoric  and  even
unconscious activities, and received materialism. Intentionalities understood in
this way can be seen metaphorically as vertical: They are directed, in complex
shifts, toward the subject matters, starting with matters of facts, and ending with
cultural  modes  of  signifying  such  facts:  Let  us  look  at  things  “ethically,”
“theologically” or “aesthetically” or even as constructions of “stories”. Verticality
has neither temporal nor spatial topoi; we can look toward future events, predicted
by  science,  expected  in  daily  engagements,  or  attend  to  galaxies  “above”  us.
Whether  such  intentionalities  were  enacted  by  ancient  Chinese  or  Mayan
astronomers,  or  contemporary  scientists,  the  enactments  can  be  reiterated  by
anyone  and  at  any  time.  Thus,  vertical  intentionalities  are  not  correlations  to
something from a position of above toward the below, from left to right, and from
forward to backward, but toward given states of affairs. Vertical intentionalities
are, in principle, appositional and thus accessible to anyone. No scholarly work
could be done if our awareness was temporally stuck or localized. When a scholar
of  civilizations  claims  that  all  are  determined  by  the  discourses  of  a  given
civilization, then she too is either determined or is aware of diverse civilizations
without being stuck in her own civilization. She is already claiming that anyone
can  investigate  and  compare  civilizations  in  terms  of  their  discourses  without
imposing the discourse of her own civilization on all others. In turn, she is already

64   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
intersubjective with simple awareness, such as the difference between Confucian
and Zen awareness of the things of the world. We find ourselves at the level of
time awareness which allows us to debate with Confucius’ views present in texts
in a different language and the way he is aware of the world. Even if we disagree
with him, as we might disagree with Ptolemaic epicycles, we are aware of the way
both saw the world—one in ethical, the other in astronomical terms. No doubt,
there are numerous cases in which a particular mode of awareness is rejected as
inadequate,  even  false;  the  fact  remains  that  we  understand  such  a  mode  as
mistaken or even non-sense. Yet, in all cases, the intersubjective field is given,
both as a horizon and a depth.
Temporal locations emerge not with the passive constitution of the flux, but with
an active engagement of the self that, in the first instance, attempts to identify
itself with the ego. Thus, the very effort positions the ego in relation to, either
something that has been done as an act of the self, or something that is to be done.
Here  emerge  the  overlapping  distancing  phases  which  provide  a  ground  for
subsequent locations of the ego, and the distinction between acts of memory and
expectation. If the flow is structured temporally, then the active engagement of
the self already takes for granted the distance between itself and the ego. This is
such  that  the  enactment  of  temporal  phases  intimates  tacitly  a  rule  of  self-
awareness. This rule can be called permanence maintenance. By constituting the
temporal phases, the self maintains the distance from, and the identity of the ego.
In turn, this suggests that the enactment of the flow, as having temporal phases
and ego locations, may be seen as sense making. The latter is the first mode of
awareness that is premised on temporalization, since sense is a basic expression of
directionality.  Experience  without  directionality  lacks  sense.  In  other  words,
temporalization is coextensive with sense-making. Regardless of the linguistic
designation, the original activity of the self is the source of sense. Thus, the self is
traceable  as  the  endlessly  repeatable  “this  makes  sense”,  and  is  granted  in
correlation  to  temporalization  that  establishes  locations  in  the  stream  of  lived
awareness. Yet, any reflection on the sense-making, on the primal function of the
self, reveals it as a located ego in the context of temporal phases. In the very
enactment  of  the  flow,  the  self  is  traceable  as  the  source  of  the  sense  of  this
enactment in an atemporal mode. The ego is different and distant from the self.
The tracing of the present of the self reveals it to be an atemporal presence of
sense-making in transformation—a transformation that is a permanent enactment
of  sense-making  flow—a  transformation  which  nonetheless  appears  as  an
identifiable  ego,  in  a  context  of  already  structured  atemporal  phases.
This analysis yields evidence of the life of the self as constant stasis in flux. The
best that can be attained is its constant self-reference from another—from a stream
that contains the traces of the original enactment of sense. Thus, the insight into

Transcendental Self-Awareness and Time
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   65
the sense of temporal phases (prior to temporal loci) and simultaneous reflectivity
that reveals the self as an ego, leads phenomenology to experience its ultimate,
critical, and apodictic foundation. According to this experience, the temporalizing
self is grasped as already temporalized ego. This is adequate to the extent that we
regard the ego in the flux of temporal phases as a trace of the self, as enacting the
permanent sense making that is present in all the differentiations of, and locations
in the flux. At this juncture we encounter the first layer of self that is involved
with the distancing ego, not as a mere sinking away, but as a mark of identifiable
permanence that must be maintained and enhanced. Thus, the first rule relating
the self and the ego is permanence maintenance. Yet, this rule also opens the
possibility of marking a temporal locus for the memory of any object and for the
sense  of  otherness.  Marking  a  “temporal”  distance  from  the  self,  the  ego  is  a
condition  for  reflection.  At  the  same  time,  and  despite  the  gap  and  hence  a
division, a mutual reference between them ought not to be lost. In order to reflect,
the self must refer to the ego in the flow of temporal phases, not by becoming one
with it, but by maintaining its permanence. While reflective reference is adequate
to establish the identity of the ego, it is inadequate to provide self-identity of the
flux-enacting self. In what sense can the functioning, the acting self, obtain its
identity from the encountered ego as a distancing in the flux? Is the just enacted
given as an ego or merely as an act? If it is given as an ego of a particular act, then
the currently reflecting and acting self is more than the just enacted ego. The
former  contains  all  the  possibilities  of  enactment  of  sense,  while  the  latter  is
exhausted in the act that is attributed to it. But if the just enacted is an act, then it
cannot be fully identifiable with the currently acting and reflecting self, since the
self is reflecting from the just performed act. Here appears an asymmetry between
them. Such asymmetry is a condition both for distancing and even disassociating
the self from the ego.
While this is a condition for dissociation of the self from an ego, and indeed from
a variety of egos, it is equally a structural condition for the possibility of the self
to  collapse  into  an  ego  and  to  become  dissociated  from  the  self.  The  latter
possibility can occur when the currently sense-making self is no more than the
sense-making act which is flowing away, and in this flow, it can be attached either
to the self or the ego. In this sense, there appears to be an equivalence between the
self  and  the  flowing  ego.  Even  if  there  is  no  guarantee  of  their  identity,  this
equivalence comprises the basic condition for surrendering any priority of the self
over any specific ego. This condition results in the self that is identical to a set of
dissociated egos. Such an array of egos appears as a normal state of affairs in our
social understanding. We play different roles in different settings and become the
sum of our social roles: Who we are, thus, depends on our role models. This
intimates that the self has become ineffective in integrating the various activities
and the various egos attached to such activities. This is a place where Augustine

66   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
(2002) would recognize the way that the self gets “scattered” and lost, holding on
to one, then another, and many other identities, which are “other” than the self or
soul. This mode of self-scattering could be called permanence disruption.
How can such a scattering be overcome? It appears that the self that is reflected
from the ego grasps itself as acting. For the reflecting self, the distance between
the  act  being  performed  and  the  just  enacted  is  seen  as  bridged.  Reflection
experiences unity in separation, identity in difference. The reflecting unification
with itself, constituting the experience of bridging the distance and keeping an
identity of itself at the present, is given since the self enacts a constant streaming.
The  possibility  of  self-reflection  emerges  on  the  basis  of  the  constancy  of
streaming, as well as on the basis of the streaming constancy of the self as it is
traced by the ego. In inner reflection, the self has unified itself with the ego, and
bridged  this  distance  in  its  streaming.  This  is  the  original  passive  and  active
constitution where the transitory synthetic presencing of the self to its egological
traces  occurs.  Thus,  all  inner  reflection  is  self-presencing  of  the  originally
functioning self before temporalization. In the transitional, synthetic unification of
the  living  present,  the  self  connects  with  itself  before  this  unity  is  grasped  in
reflection. The pre-accomplished presencing of the self in its traces is the self-
actualizable reflectivity of the self with respect to its own egological traces: It is
the functioning of “reflection in inception”.
The  dynamic  of  the  living  present  is  experienced  as  atemporal  pre-
accomplishment of passive and active transitional syntheses are equivalent to self-
presencing. Thus, in each recouping refection, the self of the pre-temporal living
present encounters itself as the streaming, self-temporalizing stasis traced in the
ego. There is no self-presence which is not presencing and thus self-presencing. In
this sense, the self is never a pure self, never a pole without distancing objectivity.
The self has itself as an object and as a sense of first transcendence, otherness,
such that a pure self requires self-transcendence and a self-tracing in the ego. The
notion of a self that constantly establishes a stream of conscious life is relativized
to the extent that all direct awareness requires a sense of the other. This sense is
the first experiential moment that allows us to grasp the world as transcendence,
as different from the experiencing self. The latter is recognized with a sense of
otherness within the very composition of the self. The very distancing of the ego
from the self and their partial unification opens the sense of the ego as temporal
and worldly and yet as an index to the enactment of the flow of the self.
This state of awareness is explicated as the always and already pregiven ground of
the history of self. The history of the self is located at the level of first distancing
and breaking out of the immediate self and establishment of self as other. In other
words, the pre-reflective synthesis as traced with the primordial flow of the ego

Transcendental Self-Awareness and Time
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   67
and  its  constitution  of  the  ground  for  differentiation,  is  at  the  same  time  a
constitution of the history of the self. One must note that this history is not yet in
time; rather, it is the basic condition that allows subsequent locations of activities
and other egos. All this is prior to any objectified mediation: The self is present to
itself in a reflective form without becoming objective, without mediation. But still
one can point out that this already shows a presence of objectifying distance; the
very  naming  of  reflection  distorts  immediacy  and  assumes  a  differential  field
which is, in principle, intersubjective prior to physical time, but a ground of our
“historical” time as a field and depth.
The  difficulties  in  the  delimitation  of  the  anonymous  and  atemporal  life  of
awareness come to the fore with respect to time. Since all temporal designations
originate  with  traditional  metaphysics  and  ontology,  they  not  only  fail  to
enlighten,  but  are  most  misleading.  Hence,  it  is  necessary  to  exclude  various
temporal preconceptions. Both, the theoretical-linear and the psychological-polar
cyclical constructs of time ought to be avoided, as well as their opposites, eternity
and duration. Also, the various spatial and linear metaphors and mythical regions
are to be bracketed. What is left consists of such possibilities as “everywhere and
nowhere”,  fixed  once  and  for  all  as  “all  time”  or  “all  temporality,”  and  “all
temporality  of  the  identical  being  as  the  universality  of  its  past,  present,  and
future”. Since the term atemporal seems to be most neutral and yet encompassing,
it has been used to designate the living present in this writing. It states a position
between  eternity  and  time.  Atemporality  avoids  diverse  metaphysical
prejudgments concerning fixity and the ontological assumptions concerning time.
Thus,  the  relationship  between  the  experience  of  permanence  and  flux,  or  the
passive and the active, can best be designated as a transition between them. It
could best be seen as permanence in transition.
Permanence in transition is indeed more appropriate for the constitution of the
ground  of  the  self  and  ego  relationship.  It  offers  an  access  to  the  sense  of
otherness.  All  the  theoretical  constructs  of  apperception,  associative  pairing,
appresentation, and empathy, assume a priori sense of the other. Thus, the origin
of  the  experience  of  the  sense  of  the  other  is  already  given  in  the  atemporal
activity of the self. This can be maintained not only on phenomenological, but
also on logical, grounds. Since the self is anonymous to itself and its apodictic
evidence of itself, then it cannot claim to be more certain of itself than of the
sense of another. If the self is an anonymous life, then it cannot have the slightest
power of disposal over itself. In this context, it is difficult to say which activities
are of the self and which belong to an ego as distancing from the self, as the sense
of  otherness.  Thus,  even  at  the  anonymous  level,  there  emerges  the  first
connection between a self and an alter-ego. This emergence is necessitated by the
slippage,  the  stance  in  transition.  The  reflective  recouping  of  the  self  in  that

68   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
transition  is  a  direct  recognition  of  itself  as  other  and  self.  Original  self-
constitution of a streaming awareness of the anonymous self is coequal with other
constitutions. Thus, the “other functioning” is, at this level of anonymity, not yet
distinguishable from self-functioning. The only difference is the sense of self and
other,  and  the  first-  and  second-person  designation.  These  are,  of  course,
dependent  on  linguistic  traditions.
Once again, then, if all temporal attributes are inappropriate in any attempt to
describe the absolute flow, then it cannot be said of it, as can of an enduring tone,
for example, that its phases proceed in succession. Nor can it be said that, if they
are not consecutive, then these phases must be simultaneous; the absolute flow is
the ground of both simultaneity and succession. It would not even be accurate to
say that a certain phase of the flow is actually present and other phases past,
because  this  would  be  to  regard  time-constituting  phenomena  as  objectivities
constituted in time. The only option for Husserl (1964) is to claim that the flow is
in principle, absolute transcendental subjectivity that either scatters itself among
the  numerous  acts,  named  as  egos,  or  maintains  its  permanence  in  transition.
Having reached this position, we must be aware that the original “acting” self is
still “more” than any enactment, and thus, the latter is one moment of reflection
suggesting that while the “ego” might be regarded as a reflection of the self, the
latter does not look like the ego or any socially or culturally designated function.
The close analysis of the transcendental self is required to ensure that, no matter
how scientific constructions of AI discourses and their embodiment in various
technologies, the self is always in excess of such inventions.
CONCLUSION
Having suggested that sense-making as a mode of awareness is “objective” does
not imply that such sense is a thing “out there” for everyone to see—a sort of
characteristic or a feature of someone or something; rather, it is any composition
of awareness which anyone can “inhabit” or “enact” and thus assume a mode of
awareness coextensive with the other. To access metaphysics in mathematical
form  does  not  mean  to  look  for  features  of  some  mind,  psyche,  or  brain
physiology, but primarily to learn how to count, add, multiply…and thus “see as
the other does”. One, of course, could ask which mathematics—they are various
and might depend on some postulate; in short, two plus two is four need not be
absolute. Granted, but we are invited to “look at” the different axioms and then
learn what conscious activities we must enact in order to “see” such mathematical
formations. In turn, having seen such formations, we can turn around and say that
some domain, seen in terms of this specific mathematical formation, can be given
to anyone. The same holds for other domains, whether they are languages, fairy
tales—after all, some historians, such as Heidegger (1971), claim that the world is

Transcendental Self-Awareness and Time
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   69
not made of atoms but of stories—we can access them by enacting the mode of
awareness composed in a story—just as objectively as we enact the requirements
of  any  mode.  No  doubt,  brain  physiologists,  psychologists,  geneticists,  and
numerous other scientific disciplines are looking for where such activities reside;
but to look for them, we must already know what mode of awareness was and is
required  to  “see”  such  acts  in  correlation  to  what  field—all  such  research  is
somewhat too late. In the final analysis, what has been shown is that the self
cannot be subsumed or surpassed by any AI product. Thus, the crucial question:
Can  AI  be  intersubjective  and  an  equivalent  to  other,  which  involves  the  AI
recognizing  itself  as  different  from  another  subject?

CHAPTER 5
The Magic of Reason: Wild Metaphysics
Abstract: No doubt, instrumental reason seems to be well-suited to creating progress
in all areas, and it is regarded as beneficial to various peoples globally. But a question
of its attractiveness, despite all the negative consequences for the environment, rapid
transportation that can spread any virus, or displace people due to lost jobs, is not
answered.  Resultantly,  we  must  open  another  dimension  of  awareness  which  is  as
ancient  as  human  understanding  of  the  world  and  the  way  we  relate  to  it.  In  this
chapter, we address the ways in which magical structures (in the Gebserian sense)
pervade modern rational thought and serve as a basis for artificial intelligence. The
contemporary  importance  of  the  concept  of  identity  is  addressed,  and  its  logic  is
disclosed as it plays a fundamental role in forming the background of the magic of
reason, which we suggest is a needed correction to the idea of “instrumental reason”.
The magical aspects of modern society and metaphysics are explained with examples
taken from Christianity, the imagery popular among the Nazi movement, and even
modern  sporting  events.  These  concepts  are  then  applied  to  the  current  movement
towards globalization.

INTRODUCTION
A few decades ago, Alvin Toffler’s book Future Shock (1970) was made into a
documentary showing interviews with scientists from different disciplines posing
a background question: What do you want? Do you want babies whose eye color
would  be  green,  while  the  skin  would  be  a  deep  tan;  do  you  want  enhanced
memory—a micro-chip in your brain; do you want to change your mood for the
day—a chemical pill will do the trick. The promise: science can fulfill all your
wishes.  At  present,  such  promises  include  “biological  liberation”  or  even
“biotopia”  (biological  utopia).  The  presentation  is  designed  to  explicate  the
“logic”  pervading  such  promises,  and  it  includes  a  very  specific  kind  of
“creativity” and its resultant “economy”. In philosophical terms, this “reason” can
be called “metaphysics gone wild” (Volkmann-Schluck, 1965), and in cultural
terms,  it  is  a  dimension  of  awareness  that  is  magical  (Gebser,  1986).  Such
metaphysics and its promises are poetic in the sense of a shift from “discovery” to

“construction”  such  as  constructing  new  algorithms  as  if  by  magic,  out  of
“nothing”.
The  poetic  visions  of  “biotopia”  or  “tech  utopia”  are  premised  on  created
processes which defy any social or psychological awareness. After all, we have
designed  non-Euclidean  spaces—purely  “signitively”—which  are  completely
inaccessible  to  our  awareness  as  Euclidean  beings.  To  speak  with  the  poetic
language,  we  create  combinations  and  sequences  of  marks  or  sounds  which
“signify” a poetic “vision” which, as any other poetic vision, has no place in our
Euclidean world, although it is embedded in visual and daily phenomena, e.g., the
computer  used  to  put  marks  on  the  screen  which  “signify”  the  vision  of  the
designers  of  this  computer.
But  this  utopian  promise  must  be  constantly  delayed,  unfulfilled,  and  for  two
fundamental reasons:
1. The more control we gain over nature and ourselves, the more promises we
fulfill, such as longevity and easement from drudgery, and the more we open
possibilities and expectations: If we can live to be 90 years old, why not 120? If
120, why not 200?
2. The more AI technologies we establish, the more we require new technologies
to master the previous technologies; this makes matters more complex. We can no
longer  be  interested  in  mastering  nature  through  our  technologies,  but  in
mastering  each  other,  mastering  our  own  technical  products  through  novel
technologies, and the latter through still more novel ones. A mechanical heart, a
marvel of technology, needs other technologies to make it function, calling for
constantly improved mechanisms and their controlling systems.
3. Some researchers are claiming that the modern-global society is moving away
from the production of commodities, i.e., transformation of the reified nature into
products, but we are increasingly moving to “service” processes, and information
markets, requiring very little raw material, but a vast system of data processing, of
possibilizing, of the complex management of time. We shall address this time
issue which is at the base of the poetics of magical reason.
Reason,  and  above  all,  scientific  reason—the  pride  of  the  modern  West—is
viewed as a solution to all human problems. This philosophical claim calls into
question  various  contentions  concerning  the  overcoming  of  metaphysics  by
modern rational thought and scientific practice. The appearance of being ignorant
of metaphysics might be a way that metaphysical thought not only dominates
human actions arbitrarily, but is also mediated by consciousness structures that
modern reason was thought to have abolished. One of these structures belongs to

72   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
the magical world, which also composes modern multi-disciplinary sciences. This
chapter will correlate the modern scientific reason to this hidden metaphysics and
the  modern  constitution  of  will—the  latter  being  a  most  primordial  mode  of
magical  construction  and  mastery  of  the  world.  The  correlations  will  provide
access to a specific ontology, metaphysics, and magical awareness. Moreover,
modern reason bears within itself post-modern functions appearing in the guise of
discursive magic. After all, there is a constant appeal to “discursive power” and
the notion that the world is composed of discourses or, as the assumption goes,
“the  world  is  not  made  of  atoms  but  of  stories”.  Of  course,  we  shall  have  to
correct  this  statement  due  to  the  fact  that  the  modern  ontological  “story”
maintains that the world is made of atoms. No claim is made that the rationale is
discarded.  Rather,  its  basic  composition  becomes  transparent  as  “metaphysics
gone wild as creative poetics”. But then, who is the creative poet?
ENS REALISIMUS
In  our  daily  life,  we  follow  a  classical  understanding  that  all  things  and
events—all reality—is present to perception in terms of their limits, and the limits
demarcate an essence of a given thing, marking a difference between one type of
thing from another. In this sense, an entity, such as a human, appears in the world
limited by its essence, and any transgression of it is “unnatural”. One variant of
this  understanding  became  a  theology,  such  that  the  things  of  this  world  are
dependent on the will of the “creator” and thus could be otherwise if they were
willed  differently.  The  will  is  absolute,  while  the  things  are  contingent.
Subsequently,  we  shall  see  the  creative  magic  of  this  understanding,  which
allowed theologians to speak of the world as imago Dei: all beings are imbued
with  specific  essences—divine  standards;  All  natural  beings  reflect  the  limits
imposed  by  the  transcendent  creator—an  ultimate  “subject”.  Current  “cultural
wars”  include  this  “creative  subject”  under  the  guise  of  various  divinities,
confronting  Western  immoral  secularism.
It is important to note that while the medieval theologies claim that the natural
world and its divinely imposed laws cannot be transgressed, this claim includes an
ambiguity between the creator as a lawgiver and a will. First, the creative act is an
act of will, and second, the creator can change the course of nature by all sorts of
willful miracles. This lends priority to the will. Such a view will be accepted by
modernity at the human level, giving priority to the metaphysics of will over the
ontology of reason. It is a unique conception in human history, leading, according
to  Mickunas  (2012),  to  a  self-evaluation  of  the  human  as  omniscient  and
omnipotent. We shall analyze the ontological and metaphysical grounds for this
claim shortly. Meanwhile, it is obvious with writers such as Bacon (1900) and his
conception of knowledge, not as something that is interested in the understanding

The Magic of Reason
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   73
of nature, but in the effort to change it, to control it, to submit it to human power,
and  to  remake  it  in  accordance  with  human  rules.  This  is  a  hint  that  the
theological  and  human  primacy  of  will  might  coincide.  Bacon’s  Physical  and
Metaphysical Works (1904) promises human domination over nature. His moral
dictum becomes: Happiness is either the stupidity or death of others. He is even
fond of an old saying: No serpent can become a dragon until it devours other
serpents. This is, of course, already the Hobbesian (1967) notion of a struggle of
all  against  all,  and  the  emergent  social  morality  bolstered,  subsequently,  by
scientific  technology.  This  morality  holds  a  view  that  what  is  unpleasant  or
unacceptable in the environment can be changed or abolished. Here comes the
“pleasure principle” of utilitarian morality.
To understand the demands of Bacon, Hobbes, and many others, we must first
disclose the appearance of the modern preoccupation of a human “mind” with its
own reflection upon itself as a challenge to the classical notion of human essence
as a limit. Such a challenge is possible with the transformation of ontology—what
are the basic features of reality—and of the metaphysical rules which structure
such reality? Given the modern turn toward a reflecting “subject” as the decisive
factor with respect to modern ontology, there is also a reflective question: Who is,
in  the  final  analysis,  this  subject?  Although  there  is  a  continuity  between  the
classical and modern traditions with respect to freedom, modern understanding
discards the classical concept of limit, and, thus, an inherent essence that would
determine  the  human  to  be  a  specific  kind  of  being.  The  modern  ontology  of
nature rejects the essential limits of natural beings, and thus rejects a specific
ultimate being which creates the world as an imago Dei: all beings are imbued
with  specific  essences—divine  standards;  all  natural  beings  reflect  the  limits
imposed  by  the  transcendent  creator.
The process of transformation from the “old-classical” to the “modern” stretches
from the late medieval period through the Renaissance. Yet, the issue is basically
one: the emancipation from all traditions, from the environment, and building the
future  without  hindrances,  either  from  the  past  or  from  previous  philosophies
turned into theologies. Each generation should be free to repeat the break with the
past  and  to  create  its  own  world  and  itself  in  accordance  with  its  own  willed
designs.  While  initially,  there  were  still  debates  concerning  man’s  fragility,
contingency, and even classical fallibility, subsequently, such views were pushed
aside. Thus, Pico della Mirandola, in his work Oration on the Dignity of Man
(1956), proclaims that man is magnum miraculum, and he extends this notion to
Theos  Anthropos.  Pico  develops  the  divinization  of  man  from  three  basic
assumptions:

74   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
1. There is no specific human nature,
2. The human can make of himself what he wills, and
3. The wonder in this world is the human who, in his reflective self-determination,
can become divine.
As an unconditional source of reason and will, he is identical to the common
definition of the divine.
The way Pico depicts the creation of humans reveals the modern assumption of
complete  human  freedom  and  his  destiny  to  control  the  world.  According  to
Pico’s  depiction,  the  creator  told  his  “new  son”:
“I have not assigned to you any fixed place, nor have I given you a specific form.
I have not given you any talent that would be appropriate to you alone. You will
have to determine your place, your form and your talents in accordance with your
wishes and your measure. I have created you neither as heavenly nor as earthly,
neither mortal nor immortal, so that you could freely create yourself from your
own power, shaping and transforming yourself to a form you wish to acquire. You
can reduce yourself to an animal or elevate yourself to a divinity” (p. 63).
In principle, the human has no natural form—once seen as the mainstay of human
natural limit—and resultantly, he can be a maker of himself and, indeed, of his
world.  This  undefinable  human  is  a  modern  self-reflection,  allowing  the
constitution of numerous views of the human about himself and his world. It is no
wonder
 that
 the
 “post-modern”
 story
 tellers—even
 unbeknownst
 to
themselves—are  followers  of  this  modern  transformation—a  rejection  of
“essentialisms”  and  thus  categorical  limits.  No  male-female,  no  high-low,  no
subject, no author, but every possible self-invention, and as many divinities as
one’s discursive stories can produce.
Pico’s view places the human in a light that favors the human—even over gods.
The  latter  is  fixed  by  their  nature,  while  human  can  become  anything.  Pico
stresses  persistently  that  the  human  can  become  what  he  wills.  This  is  the
“wonder man/woman” of modernity, forming philosophical anthropology to fit
the modern age. Without this anthropology, it would be difficult to understand the
development of the autonomous, free being who is a maker of himself and his
world.  This  is  the  modern  revolution.  By  the  eighteenth  century,  one  had  an
enlightened view and an enlightened man. Condillac (1974) no longer has any
questions but that the human creates and exists from himself. One of the initial
interpretations of this self-elevation was “naturalistic” in the sense that the human
follows  his  rational  self-interest.  The  world  was  reinterpreted  as  a  geometric

The Magic of Reason
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   75
machine  to  be  arbitrarily  manipulated  by  human  interests.  Condorcet  (1955)
regards  the  Modern  Mind  as  true,  rational  and  scientific  and  the  classical  as
mistaken, non-sensical, and illusory. The rejection of the old is not a loss but a
gain over errors and illusions.
The previous humanity was a youthful stage, while the modern man has reached
maturity and needs no longer be in error. It is not even a question of whether
current human activities are good or bad, have good or bad consequences, or have
value or disvalue; rather, each activity is justifiable if it replaces something old
with something new, something “progressive”. This is one of the sources not only
of progress, but of the view of truth as historical. Whoever lives today is superior
to those in the past because he is more modern and novel, has acquired a greater
mastery over the environment and, resultantly, more truth. Not only is the novel
truer,  but  also  better—an  improvement  of  humanity  through  science  and
technology.  As  Schabert  (1978)  points  out,  the  literature  of  the  Scientific
Enlightenment is replete with this narcissistic view of the human. According to
him, not only Galileo, but Bacon, and even Newton, repeatedly emphasize their
conviction  that  the  new  filosofia  naturale  will  place  man  in  such  a  superior
position  over  nature,  that  the  human  will  have  power  even  over  himself—an
affirmation of human as self-created, resulting in biotopia. It should be obvious
that  the  human,  as  the  source  of  rules  and  power  over  the  environment,  has
replaced  the  traditional  divinity  as  Ens  Realisimus—the  ultimate  being  as
creator—and  took  its  place:  Now  the  human  is  Ens  Realisimus.
Of course, the omnipotence to control the world requires that humans acquire a
complete knowledge of the mechanisms of reality. Without such knowledge of the
“hidden  secrets”  human  dominance  could  not  be  complete;  without  the
equivalence of his power with nature’s, the human could not dominate the world
effectively. As long as something escapes human control, man is still “inferior” to
nature; hence, the task is to uncover all the secrets in order to subsume them under
human, technical designs. The new cosmic center, the modern subject, is the sole
source of value and beauty. As Buffon (1791) proclaims, the human is capable of
transforming the nature brute into nature novelle. As he ponders the world, he
suggests that, if we look at the world where no human has yet settled, we find the
brute nature to be ugly and dead. It is I, solely I, who makes nature attractive and
living. Everything changes only through me, and a new nature comes from the
hand of man. Man, the master of all regions, has changed and renewed everything
in  this  world,  and  his  right  is  founded  on  nothing  other  than  his  right  as  a
conqueror. Nature is the “raw material stuff” and humans can shape it according
to their wishes. This ego inflation is a self that has assumed a specific position,
requiring more fundamental arguments for its appearance. This will be presented
shortly.

76   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
Given this direction, there is an admixture of scientism and freedom. One is free
to use science in order to master and control nature; yet, in turn, the human, too,
can become part of the natural environment and hence must submit to the controls
of sciences. And this is one of the major attitudes emerging with the view of
mastering everything through science. Hence, Bacon has no question but that even
politics could be reduced to physics. It is instructive that Bacon, one of the fathers
of  modern  scientism,  had  persistently  opposed  the  then-emerging  Political
Enlightenment and its rejection of all political absolutisms. In the well-known
case of Bacon and Coke, Bacon (2000) supported the absolutism of monarchy and
its power against Coke and the “superstitious population”. It is up to the new
science to control all human affairs without any need to respect the views of the
population. While human is now in charge of the scientific reconstruction of the
world, only some of the humans, the ones in the “know” i.e., the scientists, should
be the rulers over the masses—of course, for the “benefit” of the masses. All sorts
of variants follow from this thesis of elitism where only the self-selected group
can  run  the  affairs  of  the  unenlightened  “masses”—Marxism,  Capitalism,  and
other ideologies fall into line. Man is no longer in essence “fallible”. This modern
elitist subject is best expressed by Heidegger (1962). After all, he rejected the
classical  concept  of  categorical  “essentialism”  in  favor  of  “authenticity”  and
followed the metaphysics of Ens Realisimus in the form of a self-created German
leader:  In  his  inaugural  address  as  the  new  rector  of  Freiburg  University,  his
general tone was that it is Hitler and Hitler alone and his laws which are the sole
reality  of  Germany.  Within  a  couple  of  years,  there  was  a  modern,  technical
marvel of a film, Triumph of the Will, with Hitler as the source of this triumph.
The concentration of power in the hands of the human calls for a specific attitude:
distance from nature, i.e., making nature into an “object”. One cannot rule over
something  if  one  remains  a  part  of  what  is  being  ruled.  One  must  be  a  non-
participating observer. This reflective distance allows the human to survey all
nature indifferently, from no particular vantage point, and thus from no particular
place.  In  this  sense,  the  human  has  no  specific  place  in  the  world  and  must
establish a place in accordance with his methods. Pascal (1995), in fact, suggests
that the modern man has lost his appropriate place in the order of the cosmos. He
becomes  the  Archimedean  point  from  which  the  world  can  be  mastered.
According to Descartes (1983), Archimedes still conceived of a point from which
he could move the earth, yet the only certain point we have is the reflecting and
acting ego. Only from the ego can one develop a philosophie practique as a means
of domination and power over nature. The reflecting ego is the Archimedean point
outside of nature which, as self-certain, can think, will, and remake the world. In
principle, this is the birth of a modern, self-creating, divine poet, identical with
any traditional self-creating divinity.

The Magic of Reason
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   77
The shift from the power of nature to the power of the human is almost complete.
From this external point, nature is determined as a copy of a primordial archetype
designed  by  the  human.  By  the  nineteenth  century,  there  was  no  longer  any
question concerning the superiority of the human, specifically the human will. As
Fichte  (1982)  announced,  nature  is  the  servant  of  the  ego.  Everything  must
correspond to my thought and will, and I will work in accordance with a freely
projected aim. This will is ultimate and is not determined by anything higher; it
rules the body, by virtue of which the ego constructs the surrounding world. I will
to influence the world in accordance with my powers, while the surroundings
cannot have any influence over me. I am the Archimedean point from which the
world  is  moved—I  am  the  sole  power—omnipotent.  As  Schelling  (1988)
announces, if you are a being in itself, then no opposing power can change your
condition and limit your freedom. Thus, you must strive to become a being in
itself,  absolutely  free  to  subordinate  every  power  under  your  autonomy,  and
through  your  freedom,  strive  to  extend  your  freedom  to  absolute,  unlimited
power. The human is Ens Realisimus, while nature becomes an appearance, an
actualization process of man.
This  is  the  principle  of  the  human  as  totally  self-determining.  To  be  self-
determining is to be autonomous. This is the result of the conception that the
human has no pregiven nature, no essence, and that by establishing an appropriate
method, he can be a master over nature. As Marxism would have it, the material
nature, and the material man, must be humanized. In the background appears an
awareness of time as a future possibility, i.e., as human projects to be fulfilled by
human  action.  All  philosophies  of  the  twentieth  century  are  grounded  in  the
reflection from the temporal horizon of projected possibilities. There is no escape
from modern philosophy without overcoming this self-projection, comprising a
horizon from which we understand our current position and even the way that
being is disclosed in its temporality.
IDENTITY
Euripides (1996) once suggested that the world was once together and that his
mother  told  him  that  it  was  rent  asunder  and  brought  forth  all  things.  This
suggests something more fundamental: the being together, the identity of things
prior to their separation. Numerous stories, stemming from all cultures, point to an
awareness of such an initial identity of events, including human artistic creations.
This is to say, each event can be identical with every other event; every saying,
sketch, or dance can be the said, sketched, or danced event. Understanding this
process requires a depiction of space, time, and movement that comprises one
way of having a world.

78   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
Let us begin with the meaning of poetic sayings that are designed to be identical
to what they say, with the very appearance of all things and events. What we call
“poetic” is, at one level, associated with the architectonic production of the ways
peoples have a world. The poet’s words set up the structure of the world and all
events in it; it prescribes the ways that peoples live and die, love and worship.
Indeed, they establish the places of all that are sacred and profane, human and
divine. It is by now known that initial language was—and continues to be—the
power to be identical with, and thus to make, the very events which the language
speaks. When the shaman performs a rain dance, the dance is identical to the
power of rain. When a tribe performs a ritual of killing a sketch of an animal, the
sketch is the very power that is identical to the powers of the animal. And, when
the members of the tribe consume the animal, they become the powers of that
animal. All creation stories are the same: When a supreme authority pronounces,
“Let  there  be…”  things  appear.  “Let  there  be  stars,  lions,  humans”  and  they
appear. That is why theologians call the world imago Dei. Everything is an image
of the pronouncements of a divinity. And we find such pronouncements in poetic
texts  which,  in  most  cases,  are  regarded  as  “eminent”  and  to  be  lived  and
embodied.
While our modern age is enlightened, our ritualistic practices still presume the
world  of  magic  identity.  The  sayings  and  ritualistic  practices  have  remained
intact. Again, numerous examples can be offered. If there is a dry season, our
shamans—the priests, ministers, presidents, governors, call the public to pray for
rain. The prayer consists of sayings that are identical to the power of rain, or the
power of some maker of rain. When a modern shaman, such as a priest, minister,
rabbi, or an herbal dispenser, say “Eat of this—this is my body; drink of this—this
is my blood” they offer a ritual which says that you will be identical with the body
and power of the founder of a cult. For some major personality cults, such as
Christianity,  not  only  the  sayings  but  the  statues  and  the  paintings  are  not
representations of some entities but are identical to them. People kneel before
them, kiss their feet and implore favors; the paintings and the statues are carried in
processions  and,  at  times,  accused  of  not  making  events  happen  that  the
population wants and, resultantly, are beaten. Here, the identity of words, whether
poetic sayings, such as prayers, or statues and paintings, are identical with the
very events. Clearly, this identity is not one of representation, but of the very
presence of the thing or event. The statues are the divinities, the saints, and the
chanted words are the health, the curse, all the way to the stories of creation:
Some “highest” entity spoke, and the things appeared. Word here is the power to
make everything happen, and thus to deploy everything in terms of verbal magic.
The first being spoke, and the world appeared—let there be a lion, a rabbit, a tree,
and stars—and they appeared with their identities of the pronounced word. In all
civilizations, this basic notion of verbal power to make is ever-present, and the

The Magic of Reason
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   79
making is “the will” of the one who possesses this making power, all the way to
language as the house of being.
The identity extends to human individuality. Note how people claim to have an
identity on the basis of verbal designations: I am a president, or I am a Christian, I
am a socialist, or I am a priest, and so forth. Identity is gained from the very
function, event, or entity one enacts, speaks, and literally embodies. Unless we are
accused of using too many poetic and aesthetic imageries, this identity is at times
enacted in more mundane events, from television advertisements to sports events.
Every advertised product is surrounded by pictorial and musical imagery in order
to make the product identical to that imagery. If you buy these shoes, you will be
a  sports  star;  if  you  use  this  cream,  you  will  be  Lady  Gaga.  Nonetheless,  the
imagery and sound comprise the poetic ritual that gives the simple shoes and the
overpriced cream the power to make you identical with such imagery.
One has only to consult the literatures of revolutionaries and the storyline such
literatures disclose. For example, the Marxian story line of an initial “paradisical”
society, without social divisions, that failed and “fell” from its perfection into
corruption and evil ways, and history, with its “dialectical laws” is progressing to
overcome  the  evil  ways  and  to  return  to  a  “higher”  level  of  society  where
everything will be mastered by the “scientific discourses” to provide all human
needs and to allow humans to be one with the paradisical/utopian, poetic visions
of the Marxian story. Entire societies were subjected to this story, full of minor
discourses of “making a new man” by the power of scientific socialism. Just look
at the literatures and arts emanating from the Marxian storyline: romantic and
erotic collective farm poster proclamations, such as Olga Meets Her First Tractor,
where  a  milkmaid  on  a  collective  farm  is  promoted  to  be  a  driver  of  a  new
socialist  tractor—she  and  the  tractor  are  totally  impassioned,  and  the  passion
spreads throughout the collective farm and the entire region. Again, look at the
statues of the heroes—faces turned toward the glorious future, aglow with joy,
revealing the presence of the poetic vision of a “utopian tomorrow”. The same is
present in news media, radio programs, theaters and movie houses.
On the political left, there is an accepted norm that an entire tradition of labeling
and/or even classifying persons, makes them what they are; therefore, we must
disallow the use of certain words or labels to designate some groups since such a
designation  has  been  detrimental  to  them.  Traditional  racial  terms  are  to  be
abolished; ethnic labeling is to be avoided; gender terms should be changed; thus,
there cannot be negroes, Gypsies, midgets, gays, women, men, boys, girls, or even
the  disabled—all  are  politically  incorrect.  If  we  are  to  believe  post-modern
rhetoric, the magic of language is the entire world. “Discursive power” is a phrase
to announce that words make things for us the way things are perceived, and the

80   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence

clash  of  civilizations  is  a  clash  between  different  discourses,  extending  into
“cultural  wars”.  Words  are  equivalent  to  divine  magic,  wherein  it  is  said  that
things appeared with the speaking of their names—“let it be” as if by magic. We
shall  see  that  even  practical  rationality  has  not  left  the  alluring  magic  that
promises to make the world over through our poetic, magical formulations and
their technical embodiment. Nineteenth century rhetoric promised to transform
not only the world, but the human subject into a totally new “future man” present
in poetic vision.
METAPHYSICS AND ONTOLOGY
Although frequently confused, the terms metaphysics and ontology cover different
domains. Metaphysics is concerned with the formal, invisible, meaningful, and
repeatable, while ontology focuses upon the nature of things of this world. No
doubt, at times, the latter is interpreted equally as invisible and is presumed to be
metaphysical in character. This character depends on the ways that metaphysics
assumes preeminence over ontology, and thus is placed in a position of defining
what nature is. There is a protracted Western history of the relationship between
them, manifested usually in various dualisms: the formal and the material, the
mental and the physical, the subjective and the objective. What is important are
the  ontological  and  metaphysical  modes  of  awareness  and  the  relationship
between such modes: in short, how we look at “nature” and how we access such
nature. To grasp this relationship requires a multi-directional and multi-layered
exposition of culturally developed logics. The latter need not be identified with
formal systems, but with ways of opening various problems and options which
relocate functions and activities in specific combinations and relationships.
Classical  thought  understood  things  from  their  limit,  and  the  latter  could  be
deciphered by an awareness of the “essential”—qualitative characteristics of a
given  thing—e.g.,  a  human.  Is  the  latter  a  sum  of  material  parts  and  their
properties, or does he possess essential properties as a whole, as a human being?
In modern terms, the question appears in a variety of proposals to explain human
life  and,  above  all,  awareness,  in  terms  of  genetics,  biology,  chemistry,
physiology,  economy,  and  even  social  causality.  What  then  is  the  most  basic
issue? The problem of the whole and its parts are concerned with the question of
the ontological priority of the whole over the parts, or of the parts over the whole.
This question includes the issue of the attributes of the parts and the whole: Does
the whole possess attributes of its own as a whole, or do its attributes equal the
sum of the attributes of the parts? The modern resolution of this issue comprises
the ground of instrumental reason and, indeed, of the technological conception of
the  environment  and—finally—of  the  human.  The  classical,  basically
Aristotelian, notion of a substance as a thing requires that a whole must possess its

The Magic of Reason
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   81
own attributes, beyond those of the attributes of the parts of which the whole is
composed.  This  can  be  regarded  as  the  natural  awareness  of  things  in  our
environment, each with its own essential characteristics that define the limits of
what  something  is.  If  this  understanding  is  rejected  and  the  ontology  of  the
primacy of parts is accepted, then we are led to the position that what we see,
hear, and touch, including such traditional qualities as being human in distinction
to being a tree, is placed into question.
Simply stated, if parts in the whole retain their characteristics, then, inevitably, the
whole is an aggregate, leading to the conclusion that the perceived qualities of the
whole  do  not  belong  to  the  “things  themselves”  but  must  be  illusions  or
appearances—mere phenomena. The world is a sum of smallest parts, called by
Greeks atomos. Everything is an aggregate of atomic or smallest parts which, in
contemporary  jargon,  are  called  “the  building  blocks  of  the  universe”.  The
perceived characteristics of the whole have no objective basis. They belong to the
senses. This means that the ontological constituents of the world are not available
to  perceptual  awareness,  and  no  experienced  qualities  offer  any  access  to  the
fundamental  reality;  the  thing  in  itself  is  perceptually  unknowable.  What  is
perceived  directly  must  have  a  “place”  and  this  place  is  called  the  subject,
containing the secondary qualities, while the real objective world was composed
of  primary  particles  having  quantifiable  magnitudes—atoms.  At  this  juncture,
there is the birth of the modern subject, a container, so to speak, of appearances
that have neither status nor place in “physical reality”. As discussed above, this
subject, being outside the newly interpreted reality, is the Ens Realisimus. It has
assumed  a  metaphysical  status  whose  denial,  in  the  modern  West,  is  its
affirmation.
ATTENTIONAL MODIFICATION
In  a  previous  chapter,  it  was  noted  that  awareness  can  be  modified  quite
spontaneously: Let us look at mathematics, at language, and then shift to look at
the world mathematically or linguistically, and thus change the ways the world
appears as if by magic. The appearance excludes other modes of awareness as
irrelevant or inadequate. Thus, all the perceptually given things in terms of their
essential  and  qualitatively  differentiated  categories  become  redundant.  The
argument for the latter is premised on the various ambiguities; creatures might
appear different, but their essential structure is the same, just as cats and dogs
have  the  same  organs,  body  composition,  and  so  on.  Hence,  the  categorical
discourse and its theologically interpreted creator are no longer trustworthy, and
the experienced things cannot be its adequate images. We enter a new world.
While  the  resolution  of  the  part-whole  controversy  led  to  atomism  and  the
subjectivation of perceptual experience, the question that must be answered is

82   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
concerned with access to the “imperceptible” reality of the atomic parts. There is
no other avenue except through the subject, who must posit a method and do so
self-consciously  and  reflectively.  Descartes  (1961),  in  his  ultimate  doubt,
expresses this search for a method which is not derivable from the vagaries of
perception, but which must be certified by a mind reflecting upon itself. Such a
method must exclude perceptual-qualitative imprecisions. These ideas and this
methodology are quantitative, i.e., metaphysical in the form of mathematics and,
in accordance with modern ontology, must be mental and inevitably subjective: 2
+ 2 = 4 are not atomic phenomena to be found under a microscope.
Despite  its  objective  “nonexistence”  the  subjective  mind  is  the  site  of
metaphysical discourse such as mathematics and as a source of all explanations.
The method for achieving truth is mathematics. There is nothing in the world,
including divinities, that are not submitted to the laws of quantification. With the
latter, the motive for mastery and the conquest of nature reaches an almost lyrical
stage that allows the human to equate himself with divinity. The world is material,
atomistic, and mechanical; it functions in accordance with mathematical laws;
hence,  if  humans  can  decipher  such  laws,  their  knowledge  becomes  equal  to
divine knowledge. This must be emphasized: Galileo (1974) and others already
make a claim that the world is created mathematically. The ultimate being created
the world mathematically, and thus, according to Galileo, there is no qualitative
difference between human and divine knowledge. If we know a mathematical rule
by which the world is constructed, then our knowledge is equivalent to divine
knowledge. As Galileo exclaimed, we are so great, we should envy ourselves.
With this equivalence, we acquire another elevation of the human over nature
subtended by an intention to master and have power over all. If human knowledge
is absolute, then man is in the position of a creator of the world. Here, the divine
and human discourse coincide: There is an identity between the modern human as
Ens Realisimus and the creator. Meanwhile, the old divinity and its categorical
world of essences, including man with his essence, are dead. The result is that
whatever is deemed to be real must be established, synthesized, worked over, and
shaped by the various activities of the subject. Some aspects of this trend are
obvious in Kantian (1958) synthetic thinking, in the Lockean (1948) and even
Marxian notion of the labor theory of value, and even in the Hegelian conception
of  the  absolute  idea  as  working  itself  through  history  to  self-realization
(Mickunas,  2012).
What,  then,  is  the  object  of  science?  An  understanding  of  an  answer  to  this
question rests on a specific constitution of the given seen as transcendence and
inaccessible to direct intuition. The configuration of the given requires a precise
deformation of qualitative awareness, its exclusion, and, resultantly its reduction
to the immanence of the subject. This immanence is subsequently designated in

The Magic of Reason
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   83
terms of psychology and physiology. This form of exclusion can be called the
Cartesian skepsis. As has been shown in numerous works, the modern revolution
designates  reality  to  be  a  reflection  of  the  metaphysical  constructs  of
quantification. It must be measurable and thus a composite of material or atomic
parts, not accessible to perceptual experience. Following this, the mental structure
of  awareness  is  borne  by  a  prejudgment  that  what  is  beyond  doubt  is  a
constitution of a precise reflective metaphysics capable of universal, impartial,
and objective access to a specifically constituted reality. It is presumed that the
latter  consists  equally  of  a  universal,  impartial,  and  homogeneous  materiality
correlative  to  the  precise  structure  of  quantitative  metaphysics.
For  modernity,  according  to  Husserl  (1970),  mathematical  or  quantitative
procedures  are  not  only  methodological,  but  they  are  foundational  for  all
theoretical thought. The specific composition of such procedures suggests that no
intuitive, that is perceptual, content is correlated to them. They contain structures
and rules which can be formulated without any relation to perceptual qualities.
Moreover, any concrete function that such structures acquire is not dictated by
these structures. In other words, the function is a matter of will, but in such a way
that the will is not compelled by such structures; they have no causal force. The
implications of such non-necessary connections will be analyzed subsequently.
In order for these procedures and structures to acquire any validity, the objective
world  must  be  constituted  in  accordance  with  these  procedures.  First,  the
procedures are indifferent with respect to perceptual intuition; they treat all events
as  if  they  were  essentially  homogeneous.  Second,  the  perceptual  domain  of
intuition,  directly  present  to  live  awareness,  is  transcended  in  favor  of
metaphysical propositions and the posited homogeneous materiality. We ought
not to be misled by the concept of homogeneity. The latter might seem to have
geometric  associations,  and  hence  be  capable  of  being  given  in  perceptual
intuition;  the  problem  revolves  around  the  practice  of  substituting  geometric
formations, the translation of the forms into a mathematical set of signs which do
not offer any semblance or intuitive comparison to the geometric domain.
The geometric understanding would still offer a field posited as matter yet with
the mathematization of geometry, and if one were to take the next step toward the
formalization  of  mathematics,  one  would  be  able  to  regard  the  geometric  as
quanta, as numerical points, sums, and divisions, arranged in accordance with
formal structures. Irrespective of the levels of the quantitative-formal constitution,
there is posited only one fundamental-transcendent reality. The problem of the
constitutive processes, both of metaphysical and the transcendent domains, leads
to  a  particular  contradiction  which  cannot  be  solved  within  the  limits  of  the
metaphysical postulations. Quantitative metaphysics is deemed to be universal,

84   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
all-inclusive, and in a position to explicate all phenomena “objectively”. Thus, the
subject  who  calculates,  and  formalizes,  must  be  either  subsumed  under  this
metaphysic,  or  be  the  condition  for  the  constitution  of  this  metaphysic.  If  the
former assumption is accepted, then metaphysics must be granted a position of
supremacy over the subject, i.e., be objective; this metaphysic permits only one
kind of “reality”: homogeneous matter. Yet, this metaphysic is not matter but
ideality and indeed a necessary ideality. If the latter is taken for granted, then the
ideality of metaphysics has no “place” in the subject—if the subject is interpreted
as  part  of  the  contingent  physical  world  and  thus  cannot  be  a  basis  for  the
metaphysical, mathematical, and formal necessities. All kinds of disciplines, from
physiology to genetics, attempt to make the subject contingent.
In either case, the metaphysical-quantitative composition is something other than
the  posited  transcendent  reality,  and  the  latter  is  not  something  given  to
perception. The morphologically constituted and directly given world, a world of
shapes, pathways, axes for practical activity, multi-leveled interconnections, is
regarded as a complex phenomenon that is not identical to the strict homogeneous
reality. This non-identity precludes the possibility of deriving the metaphysical
formalisms  from  the  phenomenal  morphological  composition  of  what  Husserl
(1970) called “the lived world”. As a result, the former is neither correlative to the
intuited world of morphologically composed things and their interconnections,
inclusive  of  the  “real”  subject,  nor  are  they  derivable  from  the  posited
homogeneous  world.  On  these  terms,  the  transcendent  world,  the  world  of
theoretical  objectivity,  is  not  given  and  cannot  be  a  source  of  mathematically
constructed  theoretical-methodological  compositions.  The  world  of  various
shapes and forms is given to perception, and yet, neither is it a source for the
understanding of the transcendent homogeneous world, and neither can it account
for  the  metaphysics  and  method  of  the  modern  sciences.  And  yet,  the
metaphysical composition is regarded as given, and indeed with full evidential
necessity. What kind of necessity? Purely quantitative and formal constructs have
their own rules and procedures, whereas the morphological and material sides are
completely  contingent  and  arbitrary.  With  respect  to  the  rules  of  the  formal
domain, the morphological and intuitive side of shapes, sizes, and relationships, is
arbitrarily selectable and changeable. This is one of the more fundamental and
initial designations of the formal as necessary and the perceptual and material as
arbitrary.  This  suggests  that  the  connection  between  them  is  not  direct,  not
immediate nor given, but must be intended by an entirely different act. While it is
possible  to  posit  perceptual  acts,  and  even  motives,  that  can  constitute  this
connection, such as interest, they are excluded a priori. There must be, therefore,
a specific act that has to be deciphered in its own right. This act is concerned with
the conjunction of two radically distinct domains: the theoretical-methodological
and the transcendent. To repeat, the former is regarded as necessary and given,

The Magic of Reason
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   85
while the latter is regarded as transcendent, material, and contingent, although not
given.
FORMAL REGION
As  already  noted,  the  theoretical-methodological,  or  termed  otherwise,  the
quantitative-formal, is not within the domains of the contingent world, posited as
transcendent.  It  is  not  found  even  in  the  directly  intuited  morphological
composition of the lived world. It is regarded as different from these domains.
They  belong  to  the  immanence  of  the  subject.  The  immanence  assumes  an
ambiguous  status:  It  is  the  container  of  the  theoretical-methodological  formal
necessities,  and  yet  it  is  a  factually  contingent  substance.  This  contingency  is
expressed in two ways: First, the formal composition must be found in the subject
without absolute necessity; there might be different formal systems. Second, if
there  can  be  other  systems,  they  are  most  likely  constructs.  In  this  sense,  the
mathematical, formal domain swings in the ambiguity between necessity and will,
rules and choice. The importance of this “indecision” consists precisely in the
option to either regard the formal as a priori given or as a construct of the subject.
Various expressions are offered at the dawn of the modern age to indicate the shift
toward  the  latter  option.  The  notion  of  nature  as  created  in  accordance  with
mathematical laws comprises one such expression. When this notion is coupled
with the view that even the mathematical-formal domain is subject to a will, then
the result is obvious: The emphasis is on the primacy of the creative construction
of the formal systems. They, too, are chosen, although they cannot be regarded as
contingent in the sense of the contingency of the material world. Their emergence
requires unique intentions that must be regarded as capable of formal construction
and  of  arbitrary  signification.  Moreover,  such  intentionality  must  include  the
possibility of extending and proliferating formal compositions and divisions at
will, and of disregarding the perceptual, intuitive content. While there are many
complexities in the constitution of the quantitative-formal modes of theoretical-
methodological “thought” in principle, this thought does not offer any possibility
of  correspondence  between  theoretical-methodological  compositions  and  the
perceptual world of shapes and structures. The formal can still be regarded as
“necessary” and the selected expressive material as contingent (although with the
previously mentioned ambiguity), yet what leads the process is the possibility of
increased formalization of propositions, resulting in the concept of formal systems
which can be differentiated into formal sub-systems and/or splitting up of systems
into distinct formal systems.
To emphasize again: what is at issue at this level is the choice of formal and
quantitative  rules  over  qualitative  categorical  distinctions.  Since  both  are  by
modern definition subjective, then there is no inherent criterion as to why one

86   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
would be more objective than the other. We must look for an account within the
very  composition  of  those  invented  rules.  First,  it  can  be  argued  that  it  is
impossible  to  gain  any  advantage  over  the  environment  on  the  grounds  of
categorical, qualitative distinctions. Second, it is also the case that formal and
quantitative rules comprise their own structures and techniques for transforming
the  material  environment.  This  way,  the  choice  of  formal  quantitative  rules
already implies the choice of instrumentality and the possibility for application.
Thus, modern science, whose theories and methods are framed within formal and
quantitative  structures,  is,  in  principle,  technical.  This  is  the  reason  why  any
scientific discipline that cannot be technically tested or practical is not regarded to
be scientific. In principle, if one knows how to define a circle mathematically, one
knows how to make it.
We have reached the point where the construction of methods that have no other
criteria  apart  from  being  technical  requires  the  process  of  the  application  of
quantifiable methods. While we have such methods, they must be connected to
the material homogenous world. This connection is provided by various theories,
yet  all  theories  assume  body  activity  as  a  mediation  through  which  scientific
methods are applied. At this level is born a modern human as a tool maker, as
homo laborans, as practical man, including the primacy of pragmatism. Since the
homogeneous world has no value, and values are subjective, then any entity in the
environment  assumes  value  because  we  do  something  with  it—an  activity
accepted both by capitalists and communists under the common rubric: “labor
theory of value”. This is to say, body becomes a site which must be constituted in
accordance with the abilities required of scientific application. Such bodies must
slowly  become  technical,  productive,  efficient,  rule-bound,  and  perhaps
fragmented into diverse functions. At the outset, we may note that the medium as
body activity takes precedence over body as a simple physiological object. The
latter will be judged on the basis of his abilities or inabilities to perform technical
functions.
The  next  step  is  a  question  which  is  concerned  with  the  “realization”  of  the
reflectively calculated possibilities. How do these quantitative, ideal manifolds
become thing-like, real—metaphysical visions made into visible reality? Precisely
when the transcendent, mathematical rules can be used for the possibility of the
production of the calculated entity. As mentioned, mathematical procedures are at
base technical in so far as they contain within themselves the rules of their own
construction and, when applied, of the “production” of quantitatively conceived
reality. The real objects lend themselves to human calculations and manipulations;
by calculating and arranging material processes, the human is in a position to
calculate  and  predict  the  results  of  such  processes.  Obviously,  this  procedure
requires  human  physical  intervention  in  a  reified  nature.  The  quantified

The Magic of Reason
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   87
arrangements  of  “matter”  allow  for  the  quantitative  calculation  of  “material”
results. We should be reminded of the fact that by the eighteenth century, reality
was no longer defined in terms of its being, but in accordance with “the conditions
for the possibility of being”. What possible, calculated material conditions do we
establish,  and  what  calculated  results  we  achieve.  Reality  is  not  what  one
experiences, but a calculative possibility of material conditions and predictable
results. In turn, if we project possible results, calculate their material aggregation,
then  we  can  calculate  and  set  up  the  material  conditions  and  achieve  the
calculated results. What leads the process is the possibility of increased inventions
of  novel,  mathematical-formal  systems,  new  algorithms,  which  can  be
differentiated into formal sub-systems, and of splitting up of systems into distinct
“scientific  disciplines”.  Thus,  we  have  physics,  macro-  and  micro-physics,
physical chemistry, biology, evolutionary biology, biochemistry, genetic biology,
psychology,  psycho-genetics,  mechanical  genetics,  social  genetics,  psycho-
chemistry,  behavioral  chemistry,  micro-chemistry,  and  on,  and  on,  each  in  a
position  to  define  its  mathematical  domain  and  to  make  events  happen  by
producing the required conditions. In other words, in modern understanding, there
is inevitable multi-discursivity wherein all events are defined in numerous ways
and  realized  as  visible  technological  reality—be  they  cars,  computers,
smartphones  or  spaceships.  We  even  speak  of  “possible  worlds”.
POSSIBILITY
There is hardly any need to mention the irrelevant proclamations that science is
value-free.  This  claim  might  look  good  as  an  adornment  to  give  science  an
innocent look and therefore allow the modern and, above all, the contemporary
“philosophers”  to  defer  all  truth  claims  to  science,  i.e.,  to  be  handmaidens  to
scientific  truths.  At  a  more  fundamental  level,  the  constructed  theories  and
methods point to a different ground: The construction of formulas in terms of
metaphysical methods is a valuation for projected possibilities; one can construct
a  variety  of  mathematical  theories  and  methods,  neither  of  which  point  to
anything. Hence, the criterion for choosing one over others is its value for what it
can make. There is no escape from the value language, ranging from the value of
science to the value of the everyday environment. The glittering shopping malls
have nothing else to sell but values: old and new values for sale, reduced values
and  improved  values,  family  values  and  cultural  values,  religious  values  and
secular values, moral and political values—one cannot find any restful region in
the environment without it becoming designated as a value. And everything can
be made into anything. All parts of the world can replace any other part. Liquid
can become as hard as steel, plastic can become a heart, metal can become a
replacement  for  bone,  a  computer  chip  implanted  in  the  brain  can  become
intelligence,  a  chemical  pill  can  become  love.

88   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
On  the  assumption  that  we  can  reflectively  establish  discourses  that  define
“reality”  and  realize  these  discourses  through  human  physical  activity,  the
selection  of  which  discourses  we  shall  “apply”  to  intervene  into  the  material
world,  requires  the  function  of  will.  Will  is  the  projective  intentionality  that
swings  between  the  metaphysical  quantitative  and  ontological  atomism.  In
technological thought, a will is required, not as a function, which accounts for
choices among “realities” but more fundamentally for:
1. Projection of future empty purposes as possible results;
2. Selection or invention of required calculations, which can yield the projected
result;
3. Selection of the materials and their combinations to yield the result and the
selection of human physical activities as part of the material conditions to fulfill
the results.
By now, it is obvious that the will’s intentions are creations of possibilities that
nature, left to itself, could never “invent”. It must be equally obvious that the
variety  of  philosophies,  including  the  notion  of  awareness  as  a  temporal
horizon—or  we  are  always  projected  ahead  of  ourselves,  and  even  a  future
possibility of our “non-being”—are minor wrinkles in the grand sweep of modern
Western  reflection  from  its  future  horizon  and  its  metaphysics  of  the  will  to
become a creator of the world. The various great thinkers of the twentieth century
had  one  thing  in  common:  “future  possibilities”.  With  Sartre  (1956),  every
judgment  we  make  depends  on  “projected  possibilities”  while  for  Heidegger
(1962), the human is the place where the future possibilities of the being of things
are  manifested,  or  for  Husserl  and  Fink,  (see  Bruzina,  2004)  possibility  as  a
cosmic  horizon  of  horizons—and  all  of  them  are  founded  on  the  modern  Ens
Realisimus as the will who projects such future possibilities. There is not a single
human public and scientific activity which is not founded on possible “projects”.
Even artists “project” their concepts and feelings on canvas, or in their music, or
theatrics on an otherwise bleak material environment.
Any project presupposes, as its condition, the distinction between the real and the
temporally  possible  or,  as  Luhmann  (1982)  terms  it,  the  modalized.  Thus,  a
particular social history does not vary only in terms of the presently given and
selected facts, but also in terms of constitutive conditions of selectivity based on
possibilities which are temporal. The insight into the selectivity of facts in any
social process is a key to the constitution of the relationship between social facts,
their structures, and the temporal horizons or possibilities. Thus, the fundamental
condition for possibility and for the selectivity of facts within a social process is
temporality. This means that the condition for the possibility of a social system as

The Magic of Reason
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   89
a process is a modal generalization constituting the temporal horizons—in both
temporal directions—of such a system.
The consequence of such a modalized conception is that all selectivity and all
delimitation of facts are based on a system’s structure, conditioning, in its turn,
the horizon of possibilities out of which events are selected. This selectivity is a
process  of  reflexivity  in  that  it  allows  a  distance  from  the  present  and  its
evaluation in terms of the various possibilities of the future. As a condition for the
possibility  of  reflexivity,  the  temporal  horizon  offers  a  distance  from  the
immersion into facts and opens the various options in terms of which the present
state of affairs could be evaluated. Yet, it must be stressed that the options are not
absolutely open. The social system itself may be used to reflect upon the horizon
of possibilities and indicate the limitation of such a horizon: Here emerge the
socially possible and the socially impossible.
It  could  be  maintained,  according  to  Luhmann  (1982),  that  more  complicated
social systems require more extensive, abstract, and more differentiated temporal
horizons  for  reflexivity  than  the  simpler  systems.  They  reach  a  higher  world-
complexity, richer with options of norms and valuations, which in their stead,
constitute  a  basis  for  a  more  refined  selectivity  of  living  and  acting.  Such
reflexivity from a horizon enables the synchronization of inner-social histories of
systems  which  are  divergent  (e.g.,  moral  systems)  with  systems  of  economic
production, education, and others. Yet, it must be said that complexity is a multi-
dimensional  quality  of  a  system  which,  too,  is  constantly  systematized  with
shifting  temporal  possibilities.  At  the  outset,  it  must  be  obvious  that  it  is  too
simplistic  to  assume  a  one-dimensional,  linear  advancement  of  relationships
between the complexity of social system and temporal horizon. The growth of
more complex social systems does not have a more complex history; rather, on
the basis of the complexity, they neutralize history, illuminate it by differentiated
selectivity, and in many cases, reject its lessons. When history becomes relevant
in more complex societies, it becomes, at the same time, contingent; it becomes
memory and forgetfulness, detailed interest and indifferent neglect of a conquered
past; all these coexisting possibilities comprise the situation which correlates to
the complexity of the changing system.
The temporal conditions for reflexivity are quite complex, although they can be
managed by higher levels of reflexive inclusion. By this, Luhmann (1982) means
that modalized aspects can be again modalized under more inclusive possibilities
and wider horizons. One can discuss the possibilities of reality, and the reality of
possibilities, or even the possibility of possibilities, necessities, contingencies, and
so  on.  The  complexity  of  the  temporal  condition  of  reflexivity  can  be
characterized in the following way: There can be a present future which must be

90   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
distinguished from the future present even if only on the grounds that the present
future contains more possibilities than is possible for future presents to become
reality. One must also distinguish between future presents, present presents, and
past presents, between the present of the past as history and the past present. If
one begins with the two temporal horizons of the present, namely past and future,
which in each point can be seen as presents with their own pasts and futures with
further possibilities of reiteration, then one begins to constitute the conditions for
the  possibility  of  all  possible  processes  of  reflexivity.  This  suggests  that  the
indefinite modalizations of time horizons can be seen as temporal reflexivities in
time. The immediate future can be reflected by a more remote future, and both, in
turn,  by  a  still  more  remote  and  perhaps  encompassing  future,  yielding  the
structure  for  the  reflexivity  of  possibilities  in  possibilities.  The  judgment  of
current events, environment, or facts is a judgment from a horizon of time and its
possibilities, requiring no hierarchal arrayment either of values or of norms. This
free-ranging reflection of the time in time and possibilities in possibilities is the
condition upon which all reflexive processes are based. For our purposes, it is not
necessary to deal with further complexities of Luhmann’s (1982) theory of time
reflexivity as a condition for social reflexivity, which may be institutionalized to
allow  the  complexity  and  management  of  an  indefinite  multiplicity  of  events.
Suffice it to say that such reflexivity allows for the possibility of projects within
projects of various metaphysical constructs and their realization.
Central  to  this  reflective  logic  of  temporal  possibilities  are  the  constantly
constructed formal means, embodied in various technologies. The latter allows for
an increased ability to offer more possibilities in possibilities, but above all, to
calculate what conditions are required for achieving the latest projects such that
the latter will also become means for more complex projects as possibilities and
their  embodiment,  ending  up  where  AI  can  become  the  calculating  means  of
possibilities. Any huge project, such as a space telescope (equally an AI) will
require  five  years  to  complete,  but  the  possibility  of  this  telescope  requires  a
realization  of  various  projects,  whether  production  of  computing  power,  or
“seeing” and “scanning” instruments, and these will reflect the possibilities of a
novel means of production of energy conductivity, and so forth. This temporal
process of reflection of temporal possibilities in temporal possibilities overlaps
with  countless  projects,  from  electronic  means  in  every  area,  from  medical
technology to video games, and also to research means in other areas, such as
chemistry,  biology,  economy,  education,  and  the  military.  In  this  sense,  the
above-mentioned  “biotopia”  is  a  construct  of  algorithms  which  can  calculate
indefinite varieties of materials, from physical through chemical, and genetic, to
micro-viruses, to construct living humans in a way that any natural combination
could not achieve.

The Magic of Reason
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   91
It would be redundant to explain the above process in terms of “needs” since the
latter is part and parcel of the possibilizing procedures and become at the same
time needs and fulfillment. We can make it, therefore we want it, and since we
wanted it, therefore, we made it. We can make clones, and therefore we want
them, and we want them, therefore, we make them. This suggests that the process
of increased contingency and arbitrariness as sources of power comprises a self-
referential domain. There are no restrictions for the “search for truth”. After all,
such  a  search  has  lost  any  boundary  and  any  distinction  between  physical
knowledge  and  its  metaphysical  construct.  Even  in  social  understanding,  the
relationship  between  the  formal  and  material  processes  are  determined  by
“science” i.e., the very self-articulation of methods and the production of material
truths. One, thus, cannot find any trans-scientific criteria to check this process.
And, no domain has a built-in reason to stop the proliferation of its own form of
knowledge  and  praxis.  There  are  no  physical  reasons  to  cease  making  more
physical experiments and refinements, no economic reasons to stop the economic
“growth” no biological reasons to stop remolding the living processes along new
combinations, no genetic reasons not to produce “improved” cucumbers, and so
forth. Any limitation would be regarded as an infringement on the autonomy of
research. Any science which would proclaim that it has become complete would
cease to be a science in the context depicted above.
The increased submission of events under human controls to yield more technical
means to increase power for increasing controls comprises the modern notion of
progress.  Progress  does  not  mean  an  acquisition  of  greater  wisdom,  but  an
incrementation  of  technological-material  means  to  yield  projected  material
results; the latter can also become a technological means or a quantity of material
force  to  yield  further  results,  and  so  on.  The  shaping  of  matter  into  new
technologies  opens  a  demand  for  other  technologies  and  discoveries.  If  a
technological means makes material discoveries possible, the new discoveries will
call for their technological implementation to suit their needs ad infinitum. No
achieved  technical  stage  is  adequate;  every  stage  calls  for  new  and  improved
technologies to yield new intrusions into the material domain to yield new results.
What is peculiar about progress is that it has no “subject” which would progress.
Its aim and its subject are itself, and thus it is self-referential. Progress is its own
destiny. When we build something, such as a house, we have a purpose which
tells us when the progress of building is achieved. In brief, if we live in terms of
purposes, we can understand progress in its limitation by reaching the purpose.
But  if  we  raise  the  question  concerning  the  purpose  of  the  modern  notion  of
progress, we shall find a quandary. As we have discussed above, we set possible
future results as an empty purpose to be fulfilled by material constructs. Once this
purpose is achieved, it becomes a means for other possible purposes, and once
they are achieved, they, too, become means for other purposes—without any end.

All that is left is progress for the sake of progress—the purpose of progress is
progress. Modern Western metaphysics and ontology establish the well-known
conception of reason: instrumental. It is not designed to present the world, but to
form metaphysical visions as representations which become reality. Progress for
the sake of progress includes us; we can live longer and better lives, which will be
constantly improved and extended, led by the poetic vision that, given an infinite
temporal horizon of possible constructs for improvement of improvements, we
shall live forever.
CONCLUSION
No  doubt,  numerous  thinkers  of  this  century,  specifically  in  hermeneutics,
semiotics, and linguistic analysis, have rightly argued in favor of the priority of
language and its power to designate. The task of this chapter was to explicate the
conditions for the possibility of such views. The conditions are neither epistemic
nor ontological, but more fundamentally based on a metaphysical subject and its
ability to create magical means—discourses—which make the world, whether in
categorical,  or,  above  all,  mathematical  ways.  Here,  we  encountered  the
production of our environment on the basis of metaphysical projects, forming a
poetic vision of what the world ought to be, and what it ought to be is also a value
embodied  in  the  empirical  products  of  our  environment.  All  the  modern
implements  we  use,  from  trains  and  planes  to  AI  automobiles,  running  on
embodied algorithms, are metaphysical visions constructed by the modern subject,
the Ens Realisimus, which has become global. Thus, all other civilizations take for
granted that their discourses are constructs, which “make” their worlds as if by
magic into what they are.

CHAPTER 6
Machine  Logic  and  Values  as  a  Self-Generating
System
Abstract:  Scientific  practice,  both  in  the  broad  sense  and  in  the  specific  case  of
computer science, cannot demonstrate how the constituted logic of a given consistent
system translates into an empirically constructed system without the assumption of
other conditions which may also be logically constituted through modes of praxis that
are already technically available. Computer science is premised on a technically laden
life-world and, indeed, on an interpretation of the entire environment as accessible to
technical management. In this sense, there is a pre-understanding that allows a given
population  to  regard  both  science  and  computer  science  as  “value  free”.  Yet,  it  is
precisely the technologically interpreted environment that is imbedded in valuations. In
this chapter, we explicate: (a) the principles that establish scientific objectivity on the
basis of the objectivity of logics; (b) how those logics are connected to the resources of
the environment; (c) how the environment itself is technical and valuative; and (d) how
a  particular  modern  value  context  pervades  the  technical,  logical,  and  scientific
enterprises.
Keywords:  Information,  Life-world,  Learning,  Machine  Logic,  Network,
Perception,  Space,  Time,  Understanding.
INTRODUCTION
Several questions emerge in the modern/post-modern world. For instance, within
the contexts of codes and network society, do questions of identity and history
make  any  sense?  What  effects  does  a  network  society  have  on  the  culture  of
democracy? How dramatically will communication be affected in light of this
information? What is the effect and function of the globalized transparency of
communication (that is, e-commerce)? In order to address these questions, we
must address the scientific thought of modernity. Our approach is decidedly based
on  contemporary  phenomenological  thinking,  which  is  interested  in  the
“necessary condition” of the formulation of computer science and the condition
for the possibility of its efficacy.
Here  our  argument  becomes  quite  obvious:  Computer  systems  are  embodied
metaphysics of signification and hence have the power to increase the complexity

and  the  efficiency  of  both  signitive  creations  and  of  their  applications  for  the
transformation  of  the  so-called  physical  environment.  Thus,  talk  of  the  new
generation of “more powerful computers” is not idle speculation, but it must be
taken  literally.  As  signitive  constructs,  these  computers  are  in  a  position  to
rearticulate and, through application, to transform events in a given life-world,
and, in many cases, to rearticulate the life-world itself. Indeed, they are part of the
events that they transform—to the extent that they are interconnected laterally
with all other events, from economic, through political, to cultural. They are the
very fabric of the current “culture of information” and information, in principle, is
signification.
Throughout  the  course  of  the  twentieth  century,  scientific  thought  was  in  a
quandary  concerning  its  own  basis:  Science,  with  its  theories  and  methods,
wanted to be logical, precise and rational; on the other hand, it also wanted to
make ontological claims concerning the structure of the world. The latter has been
deemed  to  be  physical-empirical.  Indeed,  the  latter  is  regarded  as  the  sole
possessor of the name “reality” and it is the “objectivity” on which everything
rests, by which everything must be explained, and from which all other modes of
presence are derived. All else is subjective and must be excluded from scientific
consideration. Moreover, science is value-free, and any valuation belongs to the
subjective realm. It is our contention in this chapter that the case is more complex,
to the extent that science—above all computer science—assumes the objectivity
of something that is not derivable from any empirical facts. The first condition of
science—being logical—is not accessible from any empirical position; second,
the  notion  that  science—and  indeed  logic—is  value-free  is  equally  mistaken,
given that there are various logical and self-consistent systems. The selectivity of
one system over another is a matter of valuation—and above all, social valuation.
Social  valuation  belongs  to  a  life-world  that  consists  of  intersections  and
overlappings of events; each points one to the other in complex ways, and each
bears various social meanings (Greimas, 1987). In this context, science is one
such set of meanings that must be located in its function in terms of its social,
practical, cultural, and technical significance. This suggests that even technical
inventions are not just entities, but that they comprise a complex system of life-
world  interconnections,  such  as  values,  economy,  productivity,  education,
politics, and even ideologies (Mickunas & Pilotta, 1998). This, of course, will
have to be shown in a detailed and precise manner.
It is also the case that the current life-world is interlaced by multiple scientific and
technical discourses and practices. One cannot buy a cereal box without being
exposed  to  multiple  languages  and  quantities  of  biochemical,  nutritional,  and
caloric  codes,  implicating  productive,  normative,  and  even  legalistic
interconnections as aspects of a life-world. The scientific and technical discourses

96   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
and practices do not overlay some primordial life-world, but rather they constitute
our understanding of the way our world and we are, live, and relate. Mass media
are equally filled with reports of scientific studies and reports of inventions and
progress, and even of protests against some scientific inventions and technical
innovations—all understood as aspects of our life-world.
LOGIC AND FACT
In this section, we will address the question of scientific objectivity in terms of the
understanding  of  facts  as  contingent.  “Contingency”  means  that  every  given
factual state of affairs could be other than it is. States of affairs have no necessity,
yet science is designed to connect empirical facts by necessary rules. In principle,
even if those rules are distributive, facts are read as statistically probable; the very
logic of probability is necessary. This implies that there is an essential difference
between  the  scientific  rules  of  probabilities  as  necessary  and  the  calculated
empirical  facts  as  contingent.  The  former  cannot  be  derived  from  the  latter.
Moreover, any scientist, despite the claim that empirical objectivity is the only
source of truth, will also demand respect for the objectivity of scientific formal
rules and logic as necessary and objective. This means that science accepts logic
to be another domain of objectivity—without being able to account for it on the
grounds of the presumed empirical reality (Husserl, 1973).
First Thesis
To avoid other confusion, we add other variations of the difference between logic
and  fact.  According  to  methodological  logicians,  such  as  Thomas  Seebohm
(1962), a Kantian scholar, there are several theses regarding the explanation of
logic. Psychologists argued that, since empirical (that is, physical) facts are the
only  reliable  source  of  knowledge,  everything  else  is  subjective  and
psychological. In this sense, the theory proposed is still maintained. Since logic is
not an empirical objective fact, then it must be a subjective fact. In turn, since
psychology claims to be the science of subjective facts, it also claims that logic
can  be  understood  psychologically.  Logical  formulations  of  science  can  be
derived from psychological facts. Obviously, this is a contradiction since every
psychological  fact,  as  empirical,  is  radically  contingent  and  cannot  imply  any
necessary rules or laws. Moreover, if psychology were the basis of logic, it would
then  be  the  basis  of  all  sciences.  In  this  sense,  even  logically  framed  laws  of
physics would be derivable from psychological facts (Seebohm, 1962). We are
certain that no physicist will grant such an absurd theory.
Other sciences, such as sociology, have made claims that all theories, including
logically framed theories, are social constructs. They can be explained by social
interests  (Habermas,  1971),  whether  such  interests  are  economic  or  power-

Machine Logic and Values
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   97
oriented, and therefore, the analysis of social conditions would imply scientific
theories and their logic. This is a variant of the psychological theory to the extent
that, instead of deriving science from individual psychological facts, we presume
to derive science from collective social facts. As such, we are simply postponing
the issue without resolving it. Moreover, a description of social facts as collective
activities and interests would not imply the logic of social sciences. The latter, as
a science, will already presume to be able to arrange social facts in the framework
of scientific rules. The rules will not respect the differences between social facts,
psychological facts, or physical facts. All would be regarded as universal and
necessary.
Second Thesis
Another  thesis  that  is  currently  in  vogue  is  one  of  evolutionism.  This  thesis
assumes various forms, such as historicism, pedagogy, and cumulative effect, all
claiming  that,  while  our  current  scientific  knowledge  is  vast,  it  was  slowly
accumulated through historical learning transmission, and ultimately through the
pressures and needs of life. In one sense, what we know now is what we have
learned from our predecessors, adding, in turn, our own empirical experience, thus
providing a continuous process and evolution of knowledge. We do not doubt that
cumulative  empirical  experience  is  transmitted  from  generation  to  generation,
providing  subsequent  generations  with  a  more  complex  understanding  of
themselves and their environments. However, such an accumulation is equally
contingent and does not imply the logic of science. The point is that empirical
experiences, no matter how vast, can go on in their accumulation without ever
leading to the formulation of logical rules. We would even argue that the notion of
cumulative  empirical  experience  is  contingent,  threatening  the  very  notion  of
accumulation. After all, contingent experiences of contingent facts cannot lead to
necessary accumulation. The environment changes, and we change. That which
was relevant yesterday may no longer be relevant or true today. In this sense, the
constitution of scientific logic plays its role at another level and requires another
mode  of  access  besides  the  empirical.  This  means  that  the  constitution  of  the
logical  domain  does  not  in  any  way  suggest  a  connection  to  the  presumed
empirical facts. There is no resemblance between these two domains. Contingent
empirical facts cannot be an imitation of necessary logical rules (Mickunas &
Pilotta, 1998).
Given the problematics of the current explanations of logic—from psychology
through  the  accumulation  of  factual  experience,  we  can  argue  that  there  is  a
difference  between  the  two  main  domains  of  objectivity,  such  that  every
explanation  will  presuppose  these  two  domains.  In  this  sense,  the  scientific
domain becomes translated into technology and finally into computers as one of

98   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
pure signification—with its own rules and implications that, in many cases, defy
our own abilities to master such rules. At least for the modern age, this means that
sciences of all types are subject to this signitive domain. If one were simply to
consider the constitution of various formalized geometries, one would become
convinced that the psycho-physiological beings that we are could not possibly
access  such  geometries.  This  requires  another  epistemic  layer,  one  that  is
correlated to formalized systems whose parameters are vectors of signification
(Husserl, 1973).
FORMALIZATION
There  are  theoretical  notions  that  something  is  either  given  as  a  fact  or  as  a
proposition  that  is  derived  from  a  number  of  facts—a  general  proposition.
Assuming that the move from facts to general propositions is even possible, such
a move will not account for our disregard of the meaning of general propositions
and their use in the context of formal demonstrations. The general propositions
would turn out to be inadequate to demonstrate formal conditions. Hence, our
argument is that there is no connection between generalization and formalization.
Formal operations employ rules that need not respect the truth or falsity of general
propositions. In this sense, formalization is a signitive process that correlates to
rules, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in arithmetic, or
the rules of implication, inference, and deduction in logic. These rules do not
reflect anything that is available in generalized propositions. Thus, we can operate
by excluding both empirical facts and the general propositions derived from them,
constructing, in turn, empirical facts based on formal requirements. In brief, we
can formulate mathematical rules and use any empirical fact to instantiate such
rules.  Moreover,  using  rules,  we  can  transform  empirical  facts  through  our
practical activities in a way that the facts will be directly constructed on the basis
of the formal rules.
This is one level of the rise of material technology. In principle, technology is, at
this level, a transformation of the environmental givens in terms of formal rules.
Factual  objectivity,  transformed  in  this  way,  is  a  system  of  formal  signitive
relationships. The modern conception of the environment is that it is the sum of
material parts that are qualitatively and essentially indifferent. Such materiality
can then be used as a condition for any possible reconstruction on the grounds of
formal  systems.  It  is  no  wonder  that  there  were  various  modern  metaphysical
systems,  including  Hegel’s  idealism  and  the  Marxian  telos,  which  constantly
promised to change the material world in terms of ideal requirements. Our point is
simpler than such grand metaphysical projects because we take for granted what
modern  science  and  logic  have  taken  as  a  given:  Formal  systems  and  the
homogenous material world, when applied, will construct the material world in

Machine Logic and Values
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   99
accordance with the formal requirements (Mickunas, 1983). But in principle, the
formal systems already have a subtext: They themselves are technologies for the
reconstruction of the material environment. Therefore, if one knows the formal
rules of the circle, one knows how to make a circle. If one knows, in principle, the
formal rules of how to make a new human being, one should be able to construct
the various genetic, psychological, and social conditions to yield this new human
being. What we are pointing to is that, despite scientific claims of a basis on
empirical facts, the practice of science, which assumes the objectivity of formal
systems as a condition for doing science, is a process of application that treats the
formal sciences as techniques that require the reconstruction of the environment in
the very manner that the formal techniques imply (Schabert, 1978).
While we grant the technical side of formal systems, which has also been granted
by modern sciences, we have not yet shown the connections between these formal
systems and the material facts. Science takes this connection for granted—without
explicating the connection between the formal systems which science uses and the
facts from which the formal systems cannot be derived. Yet, one constantly talks
about  applying  sciences  to  reality  in  order  to  test  whether  the  application  is
warranted or not. In a superficial way, this is known as testing the hypothesis.
Obviously, testing the hypothesis does not simply mean opening one’s eyes and
looking,  but  rather  using  highly  sophisticated  technical  means.  The  latter  is
already constructed on the basis of formal requirements as a mediation between
the so-called physical material world and the logic of science. In this sense, the
very testing of a hypothesis presupposes the background of formal systems that
are embedded in material techniques. Regardless of how far we extend the notion
of scientific testing, we should have to include the technological background as a
condition both for the testing of hypotheses and as one for a scientific praxis that
must translate every formal requirement into material conditions.
Perhaps to our surprise—although it may not be surprising at all—there emerge
phenomena that are self-generating and which are beyond anyone’s control:
1.  Formal  systems  which  have  no  cause  and  no  empirical  base,  and  which
disregard  any  empirical  generalization,  and,  therefore,  can  be  used  at  will;
2. The empirical environment is reduced to an indifferent material substance that
does not imply any qualitative differences (Nietzsche, 1968);
3. Any qualitative generalizations do not imply the formal systems; and
4. The view of the formal systems as hypotheses to be tested in the factual world
implies that the factual world will have to be drawn into the  signitive  process  of

100   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
the formal systems. Yet, as we said before, this is technology—the formal systems
are reified into instrumentalities.
This logic of “self-generating” formal systems that are directly translated into
material implements implies that even the material facts are co-extensive with the
signitive domain of formal constructions (Jonas, 1981). Formal constructions that
have  no  empirical  ground  and  therefore  are  not  being  caused  by  any
psychological,  social,  evolutionary,  or  metaphysical  components,  may  be
regarded  as  a  self-constituted,  and,  therefore,  as  autonomous  processes.  In
signitive  processes,  a  specific  formal  condition  will  imply  its  consequences
irrespective  of  any  causal  requirements.  Very  low  causal  conditions  will  not
correspond to the variation of formal conditions, and conversely, formal-signitive
implications are not of the same order as causal connections.
The transformation of materiality into signitive conditions implies that the social
environment  is  a  life-world  structure,  consisting  of  a  system  of  multiple
implications.  In  a  limited  sense,  all  social  factual  phenomena  are  not  merely
factual,  but  already  signitive.  In  this  sense,  we  live  in  a  social,  historical,
scientific, and technical world of multiple signitive vectors, constituting a life-
world. At this juncture, we no longer have to be worried about the mind-body
problem, where signification is somehow subjective, and what is not signitive is
objective.  The  very  practice  of  science  has  abolished  this  dichotomy,  despite
scientific  metaphysics.  Thus  far,  our  argument  grants  that  signification  as
meaning and/or sense-making is already available at the formal level, which is
understood by anyone engaged in scientific venture and in applying this venture
to environmental material conditions. Once those conditions are “realized” and
science is verified, we acquire a construct that purports to be not only explanatory
but self-explanatory.
The reason for this self-explanation is the valuation which is in the background,
and grants formal systems the practical value to transform the environment in
favor of “human needs”. Once again, what is theoretically at issue is that human
needs,  as  empirical,  be  they  psychological,  sociological,  or  economic,  do  not
imply formal-signitive systems. Therefore, the latter will have to be constructed
and  selected  as  values  to  correspond  to  those  needs.  We  must  note  that  the
selection of the formal systems as valuable for fulfilling the needs has no direct
connection with such needs. The latter are psychological, biological, social, and
economic,  while  the  former  are  signitive.  In  other  words,  one  is  premised  on
empirical generalizations of various needs, while the others are formal systems
that must be connected to such needs by way of technical implementation.

Machine Logic and Values
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   101
Therefore, the selection of the formal systems that would be relevant will have a
criterion  that  has  to  be  translated  into  formal  systems.  This  means  that  the
criterion will be some evaluative principle that will facilitate the decision as to
which formal system will be adequate to apply for the fulfillment of which needs.
This is another way of saying that formal systems have to become techniques to
fulfill the criteria of empirical needs. However, the process is still more complex:
The needs themselves are also selected in terms of their significance in a given
life-world, and hence are not mere observations and generalizations of empirical
phenomena.  Our  point  is  that  formal  systems  as  signitive  are  valuative  to  the
extent  that  they  can  fulfil  the  desires  that  are  equally  articulated  in  terms  of
socially, psychologically, and economically signified needs. The very needs are
significant by social—and not by empirical—definition. Not every psychological
wish or biological drive will be regarded as socially significant. In this sense, only
the significant needs will be granted value. What emerges here is a question of
multiple valuations. The types of valuations there are—and the kinds of formal
systems—must be constituted to translate the material environment in order to
fulfill the valuation of needs, depending on the complex intersignification of a
given life-world. Our life-world is pervasively technological, technocratic, and
bureaucratic, as well as political-economic, and hence it requires a simplification
of complexities.
The signitive logics which pervade the life-world with its valuative selectivities
are  also  in  the  background  of  the  cybernetic  revolution.  While  the  cybernetic
revolution  brought  in  computer  science,  it  is  at  the  same  time  included  as  a
background of the self-generating process of formal systems that are translated
and reified into the technical environment. The computerized logic, as formal, has
no regard for anything that is environmentally or qualitatively differentiated. Its
own  logic  does  not  need  to  respect  the  so-called  “natural-qualitative”
differentiations. Any living, working, suffering being in this logic of indifference,
which  transcends  such  a  being,  can  regard  all  events  in  terms  of  mutually
replaceable variants. Social, economic, pedagogical, cultic, and cultural givens
are, in this logic, equivalences in normative exchanges. Whether something is
labor, power, artwork, or mysticism, it must subject itself to the requirements of
the formal rules of quantification.
Quantification  must  become  information  in  order  to  be  transmitted  globally.
While  previously  televisual  globalization  was  available  and  this  globalization
depended  on  the  valuative  selectivity  of  large  media  organizations,  the
computerized  globalization  offers  any  arbitrary  access  to  any  selectivity.  This
means  that  rhetorical  propositions,  as  translatable  into  practices,  will  be
equivalent to other propositions. No external judgment is possible apart from an
appeal  to  other  computerized  information,  whose  credibility  is  simply  the

102   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
appearance in the global network. Computerization opens up a domain of any
space and any time accessed without history—without places and without times.
It is a synchronic instrument that is premised on signification that is everywhere
and yet not localizable. The age of the computer opens up a world of signification
where there is no place and time and, conversely, where all places and all times
are equivalently accessible. Therefore, our task is to explore the domain of all
places at all times.
SIGNITIVE SPACE AND TIME
Regardless of the arguments given by positivist historians and anthropologists, the
simple  access  to  the  past  is  not  read  as  empirical,  but  conversely,  every
empirically discovered datum is read as a text that means. That is, what we call
the  past  is  not  accessed  empirically  since,  in  principle,  we  cannot  be  there
empirically, but we can access those events by reading texts and monuments, not
as  empirical  data,  but  as  various  systems.  Time  and  space,  wherein  we  locate
empirical events, is accessible only as a signitive framework of sense-making to
which everyone, in principle, has access. Given that we have no time machines to
go from now into the future or the past, the only access we have to both of those
temporal components is the immediacy of meaning and sense-making awareness
(Mickunas & Pilotta, 1998).
The  globalizing  process  of  cybernetic  revolution  is  based  on  our  ability  to
communicate irrespective of place and time on the globe, because we know or
understand what the others mean. This suggests that, in dealing with computer
technology,  we  are  presented  with  immediate  access  to  the  entire  world,  not
because of our capacity to be empirically everywhere, but because of the technical
capacity to make present signitively constituted events, no matter how far or near
in so-called real space and time.
We are not suggesting that signification is something eternal, given beyond space
and  time;  rather,  it  is  contingent  to  the  extent  that  sense-making  systems  are
embodied in, and maintained through, the various technical means as carriers of
such systems. When we speak of systems, we are in the same domain as logical or
mathematical systems, assumed as given by any modern science. In this sense,
when one reads computer messages, one does not question the presence of such
messages, despite the empirical fact that those messages originated ten thousand
miles away (Pilotta & Mickunas, 1990). One reads signification as temporally and
spatially  indifferent.  Prior  to  the  question  of  where  and  when,  there  is  an
awareness  of  what  the  message  means  and  the  sense  that  it  makes.
In our argument, we note that the reading of a message is prior to and pervades
the empirical means that transmit the message. The computer, as a technological

means, is a spacio-temporal entity, but it is designed to carry the presence of
significations that have no specific space-time positions. This would be analogous
to the construction of non-Euclidean space. The latter has no empirically given
intuitive component. It is a pure system of formal constructs that do not point to
any material, mental, or other “realistic factors”. Yet, non-Euclidean geometry is
regarded as an important way of articulating (if not actually constructing) other
dimensions capable of transforming a life-world environment (Stroeker, 1987).
This  kind  of  non-positional  objectivity  is  a  condition  for  computerized
communication  to  the  extent  that  it  does  not  require  either  the  senders  or  the
receivers  of  messages  to  have  the  same  mental-physical  experience.  As  we
suggested above, there is a variation between the empirical and the signitive such
that it is possible to have different empirical factors making the same sense, as
well  as  one  empirical  factor  with  diverse  senses.  Since  the  major  level  of
computer signification is logic, then there is a constructive connection between
this logic and various life-world facts, and in turn, such facts can be articulated
and reconstructed by different computer logics.
Our  analysis  focuses  on  two  intentionalities  that  have  comprised  modern
conditions, allowing for the appearance of one level of linguistic power, namely
modifications both in deconstruction and in politically correct discourses. By the
term  intentionality,  we  do  not  mean  a  subjective  state,  but  rather  a  mode  of
relation to the world. A metaphor of vertical and horizontal relationships to the
world is used to explain how modern scientific rationality assumes principles that
exclude vertical or direct access to the perceptual qualities of objects and events.
This exclusion leads to the acceptance of the priority of the formal, linguistic, and
logical as the bases of scientific thought. The result is a conception of a theory
and a method subtended by a process of the transformation of signs, leading to the
empowerment necessary to master the material world. If not deliberate, there is a
specific “bracketing” that was performed by the philosophies and sciences of the
modern  age  that  allowed  the  attribution  of  power  primarily  to  linguistic
articulations. The result of this development is manifested in the current claims of
the  semioticians  and  the  deconstructionists  that  language  or  discourse  is  the
primary power in all domains of human experience and praxis (Barthes, 1977).
Although  at  first  sight  outlandish,  this  claim  is  more  than  justified  by  the
subsequent analyses of modern ontology and its metaphysically laden scientific
method.
Our  approach  is  to  trace  this  “bracketing”  and  show  what  phenomena  have
become  discarded  and  what  phenomena  remain  in  order  to  be  constitutive  of
power. The appearance of the irrevocable transition of signs and their power rests
on a specific constitution of the given: It is regarded as “transcendent”, beyond
experience, and inaccessible to sense perception. The composition of the given

104   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
requires an exclusion of qualitative awareness and its reduction to the immanence
of the subject. This immanence is subsequently designated in terms of psychology
and physiology. This form of exclusion can be called Cartesian skepticism. As has
been  shown  in  numerous  works,  the  modern  revolution  deems  reality  to  be  a
material  extension  of  atomic  parts  that  are  inaccessible  to  sense  experience,
although manageable by a method of quantitative manipulation (Mickunas, 1983).
Following this, the entire modern view is borne by a prejudgment that what is
beyond  doubt  is  the  constitution  of  a  precise,  reflective  method  capable  of
“univocal, universal, impartial, and objective” access to a specifically constituted
“reality”. It is presumed that the latter consists equally of a univocal, universal,
and impartial rationality correlative to the precise structure of methodology.
There is a need to show the ways in which both the methodology and the “reality”
are  constituted,  correlated,  and  assumed  to  be  isomorphic.  For  modernity,
according to Husserl (1970), mathematical or quantitative procedures are not only
methodological, but are also foundational to all theoretical thought. The specific
composition  of  such  procedures  suggests  that  no  intuitive—that  is
perceptual—content is correlated to them. They contain structures and rules that
can be formulated without any relation to perceptual qualities, requiring vertical
intentionalities oriented essentially to the domain of direct awareness. Moreover,
any  concrete  function  that  such  structures  acquire  is  not  dictated  by  these
structures. In other words, the function is a matter of will, but in such a way that
the will is not compelled by these structures, which have no causal force. The
implications of such “non-necessary” connections hint at the instability of signs,
at their transitional composition.
In  order  for  these  procedures  and  structures  to  acquire  any  validity,  the
“objective” world must be constituted in accordance with these procedures. First,
the procedures are indifferent with respect to perceptual intuition; they treat all
events as if they were essentially homogeneous. Second, the perceptual domain of
intuition,  directly  present  to  live  awareness,  is  transcended  in  favor  of
theoretically  or  methodologically  posited  homogeneity—that  is,  posited  in
accordance with methodological requirements. The transcendence in this context
is minimally twofold. First, it is required that one disregards the awareness of the
qualitative  sphere,  deemed  to  be  subjective.  Second,  one  must  regard  the
homogeneous domain as transcendence, as a reality in itself and independent of
the perceiver. Thus, awareness has no access to this transcendence. Its “reality”
can be secured by a theoretical and methodological postulation. The latter is the
source of the conception of a mathematically idealized nature as a homogeneous
mathematical manifold. We should not be misled by the concept of homogeneity.
The  latter  seems  to  have  geometric  associations  and  hence  be  accessible  to
perception.  The  problem  revolves  around  the  substitution  of  geometric

Machine Logic and Values
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   105
formations—the translation of the forms into a mathematical set of signs that do
not offer any semblance or intuitive comparison to the geometric domain.
Geometric understanding would still offer a field posited as “matter”, yet with the
mathematization  of  geometry.  If  one  were  to  take  a  next  step,  toward  the
formalization  of  mathematics,  one  would  be  able  to  regard  the  geometric  as
quanta—as numerical points, sums, and divisions—arranged in accordance with
formal  structure.  Irrespective  of  the  levels  of  quantitative-formal  constitution,
there is posited only one fundamental—transcendent reality. The problematics of
the constitutive processes, both of the theoretical-methodological domain and the
transcendent  domain,  lead  to  a  particular  contradiction  that  cannot  be  solved
within  the  limits  of  the  theoretical-methodological  framework.  The  method  is
proclaimed to be universal, all-inclusive, and thus able to subsume all phenomena
“objectively”.  But  the  subject  who  calculates  or  formalizes  must  either  be
subsumed under the method or be the condition for the constitution of the method.
If the former assumption is accepted, then the method must assume a position of
supremacy over the subject—that is, it must be objective. Yet, this very method
permits only one kind of “reality”: that of homogeneous matter. The method does
not matter, but it is an ideality and a necessary ideality. And yet, if the latter is
taken for granted, that is, if the subject is also to be submitted under the method,
then the ideality of the method has no “place” in the subject because the subject
must be contingent, contradicting the notion that there are logical and/or formal
necessities.
Although  the  conception  of  the  homogeneity  of  transcendent  reality  can  be
described  by  geometrical  structures,  corresponding  to  the  morphological  and
perceptually intuited world, the shift from the geometrical signification to the
mathematical and formal abandons any kind of intuitive correspondence between
the shapes of geometry and the morphological compositions of the lived world.
Hence, any theory of representative correspondence—that is, that there is a copy
of  the  world  in  the  “mind”  substance—has  to  be  abandoned.  The  signitive
symbolisms of quantitative and formal compositions do not offer any intuitive
counterpart  in  the  perceptual  world  apart  from  the  sounds  or  marks  that  are
selected arbitrarily. But these marks, although part of the morphological world, in
no  way  reflect  or  resemble  the  theoretical-methodological  composition;  they
simply provide the arbitrary means for perceptual expression. Although there are
many  complexities  in  the  constitution  of  the  quantitative-formal  modes  of
theoretical-methodological “thought” in principle, this thought does not offer any
possibility of correspondence between theoretical-methodological compositions
and the perceptual world of shapes and structures. Yet, anyone dealing with the
scientific  issues  of  observation  assumes  a  transition  from  the  signitive  to  the
morphological modes of signification. This transitional domain is an unannounced

106   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
background that provides a silent nexus between otherwise disconnected domains.
This, however, is beyond the scope of the present chapter.
Given the computer’s non-positional logics, and given that they can be carried by
appropriate technologies, then, in principle, it is possible to select and to transmit
the sense of any event as if it were immediately present to anyone. What is at
issue is the process of selectivity that is not implied by the constructed logics and
by the empirical events that such logics frame. Here, we encounter the question of
selectivity as valuation. Among the numerous events signified in a life-world,
some are regarded as important and valuable. At this level, valuation does not
have any rules that could be derived from either domain, the formal-logical, or the
events of the life-world. What is required by our analysis are the value conditions
that  connect  signification  and  such  events.  The  point  we  have  reached  is  the
previously  mentioned  requirement  of  connecting  logic  with  fact,  mathematics
with data, and sense-making with events. Since the systems of signification are
constitutable at will, they themselves do not imply which of them are relevant to
the social, economic, pedagogical, or cultural aspects of a life-world. Resultantly,
the very constitution of signitive systems requires a value criterion which would
say:
1.  Which  formal  systems  among  all  possibilities  should  be  applied  to  which
aspects  and  events;  and,
2. The criteria for the constitution of specific formal systems must be part of a
society—a  political  society,  a  political  economy,  and  a  political  economic
ideology—which  can  provide  a  clue  concerning  that  which  is  relevant  among
possible formal systems.
In fact, we would argue that the very construction of computer technology which
is based on logical signification is a technology that embodies valuation. That is,
we elect to build this technology instead of another. This is simply to remind us
that  technology  embodies  valuative  conditions,  and  it  therefore  cannot  be
regarded  as  a  mere  empirical  fact.
What is appropriate to the theme of space and time is that the technical means that
embody the formal logic and its valuative subtext can be produced and set up
anywhere at any time around the world. Yet, it is to be noted that such a set-up
carries with it the social-cultural, economic, and technical life-worlds. Thus, the
“First World” transfers the latest technologies to the “Third World” in order to
help "develop" the local populations, to make them aware of the rest of the world,
which means making them signitively accessible, as well as enabling access to
events  no  matter  where  and  when.  Therefore,  this  globalizing  transference  of
technology  brings  with  it  non-positional  space-time  to  all  who  can  afford  the

Machine Logic and Values
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   107
technological means. We must remind ourselves that those very global means are
not  mere  empirical  data  or  facts,  but  that  they  carry  with  them  valuative
conditions.  For  modern  Western  understanding,  values  are  deemed  to  be
subjective, in contrast to the objectivity of the empirical, and as we have argued,
to the logical-signitive domain. Yet, the very selectivity of certain logics over
others, and of their connection to the events is valuative. Exporting computer (and
other) technologies also includes the export of values embedded in technologies
(Pilotta & Widman, 1984).
VALUATIVE NEXUS
All along, the ideology of science has been that there is a difference between
value and fact, and that science is value-free. We have argued that the required
connection between logic and fact introduces a third component, which at the base
is  valuative.  The  very  application  of  logically  framed  theories  or  hypotheses
introduces a selectivity among various hypotheses and a selectivity between the
domains  in  the  environment  which  are  relevant  for  application  and  hence
technological reconstruction. The reconstruction is activity premised on human
purposes and on various levels of valuation which can be interpreted in several
ways,  such  as  sociological,  psychological,  economic,  ideological,  and  even
mythological. Since, scientifically speaking, values do not belong to objectivity,
they are then part of the world as intersubjective proposals. We are not contending
that such proposals are totally arbitrary, based on individualistic desires, but we
are contending that even when they are interpreted socially, they still are primarily
values. Even if we quantify values and claim to have gained objective data, we
have not, therefore, abolished their value function (Luhmann, 1981).
This leads us to the understanding of computer rationality as purposive, value-
laden, and, therefore, premised on individual or social purposes. We shall argue
that  computer  rationality  consists  of  layers  of  value  systems,  and  in  the  final
analysis, valuations that both promote autonomous selectivity and invention, and
in turn, place demands on individuals and groups. Engaging in the continuous
proliferation of increasing efficiency and circular creativity requires that any logic
that is translated into material implements becomes, in turn, the means to create
more novel, encompassing, and efficient computer logics. This is the subjecting
process wherein one is compelled to constantly engage in research that is not only
designed to discover new facts, but also to invent new ways to establish logics
that would become factually efficient. What we are pointing to is a magic circle.
The more we constitute new logics that are translated into material implements,
such as computers, the more we are capable of using the same computers to open
up new logics for their own material implementation. But the point of this magic
circle is an increase in possibilities of valuative selectivity. The latest computer

108   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
machines  can  perform  calculations  that  previous  logics  were  incapable  of
performing.  In  this  sense,  the  latest  machines  can  instruct  us  about  the
possibilities  of  new  logics  (Jonas,  1981).
There is an available dogma that computer science is objective and has no need
for any values; after all, anyone can learn the latest computer programs and the
required use of the technology. No doubt. Whether in China or Guatemala, the
computer will be regarded as a means to process and transmit information. Thus,
the view is that computers are purely technical and indifferent means, usable by
anyone,  and  therefore  their  only  value  is  that  which  particular  groups  or
individuals  want  to  give  them.  This  is  like  saying  that  there  are  trees,  and
whatever people want to make of them will give those trees their value. But this is
a false analogy because the computer systems are themselves information, and
indeed, selected information:
• The imbedded information is a particular logic of the computer (that is, the
software).
• It has a specific material design (that is, the hardware).
• It has an economic system of values and modes of production.
• It creates suggested options and supplants other options.
In  this  sense,  the  objectivity  of  the  computer  embodies  various  levels  of
valuations. Those who acquire the latest machinery do not only acquire means of
processing  and  transmitting  messages,  but  they  also  acquire  the  messages  of
computer logic, embodiment, economy, and perhaps an entire life-world and its
social  systems.  Moreover,  the  logic  of  the  programs  is  designed  to  process
information in specific ways. While the user is told that he or she is free to access
information,  the  information  is  mediated  by  the  logic  of  the  program,  the
economy of affordability by a specific group in a specific part of the world, and
its purposive rationality that would dictate the programs and the messages that the
given  population  will  access.  In  brief,  the  objective  claim  that  computer
rationality is merely a means for anyone dealing with messages is restrictive to
what computer logic is all about.
The points of our concern are:
• The objectivity of computer logic is selective.
• The selectivity is imbedded in the production of the software.

Machine Logic and Values
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   109
•  The  software  is  restrictive  to  the  extent  that  it  prescribes  and,  we  suggest,
interprets  the  messages  to  be  received.
• It constructs socioeconomic parameters for the usability and affordability of this
so-called value-free instrument.
• The logic of the latest software demands the reproduction of hardware, leading
to a constant rush for the latest technology (Otherwise, the latest software will be
in the hands only of those who can afford the latest hardware).
In this sense, vast populations of the world may be able to afford the outdated
hardware, and those so-called objective systems are split into the populations that
can match the latest hardware with the latest software, and those who depend on
the  outdated  hardware,  or  have  none  at  all,  and  therefore  cannot  engage  in
receiving, producing, or processing the messages provided by the latest software.
This  is  the  paradox:  As  we  have  mentioned  before,  one  requires  a  constant
subjection  to  the  efficiency  and  reconstruction  both  of  the  logic  and  of  the
hardware that implies socio-economic valuation and the capacity to acquire what
would become, or for some has become, the “newest”.
The implication is obvious: Vast populations of the world would be called upon
equally to engage in valuation. Do we want the latest hardware to match the latest
software?  Or,  do  we  want  to  protect  the  environment,  to  educate  future
generations, to provide decent housing and medical care? It is the case that all
things cannot be accomplished at once, and buying the “newest” hardware may
have to be postponed in favor of other human purposes and, therefore, to forego
the  receiving  of  messages  that  are  deemed  to  be  objectively  accessible  for
everyone. We are suggesting that the introduction of the computerized systems
around the globe is not an innocent presence of means to acquire information, but
rather the valuational requirement of peoples and their governments to deal with
questions as to what is of greater value in a given society. We are not rejecting
computer logic and its objectivity; we wish to show that it belongs in various
value  contexts.  At  the  center  of  this  valuative  complexity,  there  is  also  the
understanding  that  currently  the  valuations  are  computer-mediated.  They  are
systems of signification that are accessible to anyone and anywhere. Valuation
here  is  part  of  the  global  selectivity,  and  the  question  is:  What  type  of  value
significations are currently prevailing? (While there are counter-arguments to this,
those counter-arguments do not deny the basic principle).
CODES OF NETWORK SOCIETY
The advent of multimedia ends the distinctions between audio/visual media and
print media, popular culture and high culture, entertainment and information, and

110   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
education  and  business.  Every  cultural  expression,  from  the  least  to  the  best,
comes together in a digital universe, creating a type of hyper/super-text library,
blurring  the  distinctions  of  past/present/future—a  new  symbolic  or  coded
environment,  making  virtuality  our  reality.
As  Barthes  (1977)  and  Baudrillard  (1981)  have  indicated,  our  forms  of
communication  are  based  on  the  production  and  consumption  of  signs.  What
seems to be present in our communication system is the organization around the
electronic  integration  of  all  modes  of  communication  into  a  synthetic  sensory
modality  integration.  It  is  not  merely  a  virtuality  but  rather  a  real  virtuality.
Critics of electronic media often argue that the new “coded” environment does not
represent reality, often referring to primitive, “uncoded” experiences as the really
real.
“Real virtuality”, according to Manuel Castells (1996) in the first volume of his
acclaimed three-volume work, Rise of the Network Society:
“…is  a  system  in  which  reality  itself  (that  is,  people’s  material/Symbolic
existence) is entirely captured, fully immersed in a virtual image setting, in the
world of make-believe, in which appearances are not just on the screen through
which experience is communicated, but they become the experience” (p. 373).
What  characterizes  the  new  communication  system  based  on  the  networked
integration of all cultural expression? “All kinds of messages in the new type of
society  work  in  a  binary  mode:  presence/absence  in  the  multimedia
communication”  (Castells,  1996,  p.  374).
The effects of the new multimedia network communication system are a radical
transformation of space and time:
“Localities become disembodied from their cultural, historical, and geographic
meaning and reintegrated in function and networks, or image collages, including a
space  of  flows  that  substitutes  for  the  space  of  places.  Time  is  erased  in  the
communication  system  when  past,  present  and  future  can  be  programmed  to
intersect with each other in the same message. The “space of flows” and “timeless
times” are the material foundation of a new culture that transcends and includes
the diversity of historically transmitted systems of representation; the culture of
real virtuality where make-believe is belief in the making” (Castells, 1996, p.
375).
Castells hypothesizes that space organizes time in the network society (p. 376),
which is a reversal, he claims, of classical social theory in which time dominates
space.
.

Machine Logic and Values
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   111
Time/space issues are not new to modern theorizing, as Anthony Giddens (1990)
has also called attention to this issue in The Consequence of Modernity. He sees
characteristics of modernity in a time/space distortion, becoming contingent. This
change does have a global effect on the entire range of human action by means of
“reflexive monitoring of action”, by way of the recursive networking of action
determinants  in  other  actions  or  possible  action,  and  the  consequences.  Local
environments determine life less. Giddens attributes this distancing primarily to
expanding  communication  technologies.  (Hence,  modernity  would  begin  with
print…  not  a  satisfying  explanation).  However,  we  may  be  getting  ahead  of
ourselves  here—in  regard  to  action/network  society  codes.
In Castells (1996), the codes of transformation, “making the make-believe” and
“the  becoming  of  present/absent”  are  significant  clues  to  what  he  affirms,
however devastating in what it denies. For Castells, space is crystallized time (p.
411), invoking David Harvey’s work, The condition of postmodernity (1989), as a
clear formulation of his position:
“From a materialist perspective, we can argue that an objective conception of time
and space is necessary created through material practices and processes which
serve to reproduce social life—It is a fundamental axiom of my inquiry that time
and space cannot be understood independently of social action” (p. 294).
Castells concludes, therefore, that “space is the material support of time-sharing
social  practice”;  space  brings  together  practices  that  are  simultaneous  in  time
(1996, p. 411). Therefore, our society is organized around flows: flows of capital,
flows of information, flows of technology, and flows of organization interaction:
“Through the new space of the network, society is the space of flows: The space
of flow is the material organization of time-sharing social practices that work
through  flows.  Flows  are  purposeful,  repetitive,  programmable  sequences  of
exchange and interaction physically disjointed positions held by social actors in
the economic, political and symbolic structure of society” (Castells, 1996, p. 412).
The  content  is  constructed  by  electronic  impulses;  nodes  (or  hubs)  are  the
dominant managerial elites. A network is defined as a set of interconnected nodes,
nodes being points at which curves intersect themselves. Networks are thus open
structures, able to expand without limits, and integrate new nodes—as long as
they are able to communicate, and share the same values or performance goals
(codes).
Codes viable for capitalistic society are: ownership/non-ownership,  legal/non-
legal,   decentralization/centralization,  flexibility/inflexibility,   adaptability/non-

112   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
adaptability,  good/bad.  Switching  is  the  connecting  of  the  networks  and  the
privileged implementers of power codes: switch/non-switch (on/off, open/closed).
Castells’ analysis indicates that recovery is organized around networks of capital,
management, and information, with access to know-how. A new division of labor
is  formed  on  the  attributed  properties  of  each  worker,  rather  than  on  the
organization. It is still capitalism, with two new features—it is global, and it is
centered  on  a  network  of  financial  flows  organized  around  a  zero-sum  game,
where losers pay for the winners in a global casino.
The new dominant form of space and time develops a meta-network that switches
on and off non-essential functions, subordinate groups, and devalued territories.
The meta-network is distributed for the social, where value is produced, cultural
codes are created, and power is decided. It is perceived as a disorder. Culture now
is self-referenced and supersedes nature, where nature is revived as a cultural
form: by environmental movement.
As we have indicated, the problematic of timeless time and the placeless place is a
signitive power which is accessible and translated via a non-positional logic of
anytime/anyplace.  If  we  follow  Castells’  logic,  then  the  following  obtain
regarding  the  new  communication  technology:  The  “network  society”
presupposes the disappearance of the local in favor of the spatial. Delocalization
means the insertion of the logic of the new communication technologies within
universal history, understood as rationalization. This logic is not new. Reason’s
claim  to  universal  validity  implies  homogenization.  Anti-Oedipus  locates
universal history in this “deterritorialization” and finds its “universal truth” within
capitalism, which comes into being at its own inception (Deleuze & Guattari,
1983).  The  technical  utopia  of  a  society  decentralized  by  telecommunications
signifies  a  spatialization  of  communication  so  that  all  localization  becomes
impossible.  This  means  the  final  dissolution  of  all  ties  and  places  that
symbolically  structured  our  modern  society.
Within the networks of the new communications, all places are equivalent. They
become  interchangeable  to  the  extent  that  they  are  all,  in  principle,  equally
accessible. Delocalization takes the form of a circulation supposedly expressing
ideal  or  transparent  communication  and  glorifying  generalized  exchange,
unlimited  communicability,  and  commutation.  Yet,  even  the  previously
mentioned optimistic interpretations, still cling to the hope of a “good social use”
of allegedly neutral technology.
Delocalization concerns position not only in space but also in time. Thus, in the
case of numerical images, there is no longer a before or an after. The different
image-moments (the instantaneous ones) of this time are interchangeable; they do

Machine Logic and Values
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   113
not  follow  a  temporal  hierarchy.  That  is  why  delocalization  coincides  with
derealization:  “Reality”  is  never  an  empty  homogeneous  space,  but  a  set  of
singular  places.  Like  delocalization,  derealization  is  a  function  of  computer
logic’s  claim  to  universality  and  takes  on  a  new  character  with  the  twist  that
capitalism gives to rationalization. With the “invention” of the general equivalent,
the condition of exchange, all things become interchangeable, deprived of their
particular qualities, and therefore de-realized.
The  move  to  digitization  is  the  decisive  step  in  derealization.  Any  message,
whatever its nature (voice, fixed, or animated images), may be treated, stored, and
transmitted according to the same procedures. But, above all, digitization paves
the way for the manufacture of synthetic voices, music, and images. Thus, fiction
and reality become interchangeable, even when one takes the data from a real
object, since the computer can produce an infinity of Leibnitzian images from
them.
The numerical image exemplifies “transparency” in that it is predicated on the
abolition of the object’s opacity. This generates an ambiguous phenomenon: the
disappearance  of  form,  but  it  also  generates  the  constant  invention  of  new
forms—morphisms. In the dimension of time, the image is no longer the metaphor
of a model or the symbol of an ideal model to which it refers or with which it
could ideally be related. Morphisms refer one to the other without entailing any
unique, original, or final referent.
The  significance  of  simulation  is  missed  if  it  is  seen  as  an  imitation.  The
simulation does not imitate; it transforms. The instantaneization of operations by
high-speed  computers  simulating  real-time  does  not  make  information  more
“concrete”. On the contrary, it abolishes the distance between reality and non-
reality:  We  have  entered  the  “era  of  simulacra”.  Knowledge  is  no  longer  a
reproduction, nor is it analogical or equivalent: It is rather a model manufactured
from all sorts of pieces and with no origin other than its own operational matrix. It
precedes the real and engenders it. Accordingly, it is a representation without
referent,  and  that  is  why  the  era  of  the  simulacrum  truly  means  a  loss  of  all
referentials.
The  new  communication  technologies  deal  with  written  language  solely  as  a
technical procedure of coding and decoding that conveys a transparent world. In
spite  of  this,  it  is  important  to  remember  the  distinction:  Interaction  is  not
reducible  to  spoken  language.
Within  such  a  model,  the  message  is  entirely  dependent  on  the  code,  and  its
reception  is  also  reduced  with  respect  to  it.  The  very  principle  of  the  code  is
performativity,  which  substitutes  control  by  pure  operationality  for  rule-based

114   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence

social control. The man-machine hybridization in expert systems is an attempt to
introduce another concept of “dialogue” and “communication”. In other words,
“expert systems” reformulate the famous “positivism debate” and in the process,
attempt to avoid the question of the social determinants of “protocol sentences”. If
this question is not asked, the “information” that circulates in the medium of the
new  technologies  is  seen  as  totally  desocialized:  undifferentiated,  ordinary
information, emptied of all social significance, grasped just on the level of its
potential reduction to a sequence of binary signals. In the extreme, “information”
is everything that can be made into an object of numerical processing.
In the final analysis, interactive use turns out to always be strategic. A game of
strategy  begins  between  the  generating  program  and  the  subject.  This  is  an
extreme example, but it is crucial in helping reveal the displacement of the social
by the cognitive and the strategic.
The claim of interactive experience to reconstitute the social bond, or at least to
build  a  bridge  between  the  realms  of  social  exchange  and  of  the  rapid  and
autonomous  development  of  communication  technologies,  seems  to  rest  on  a
truncated definition of “communication” which differs from information by the
fact  that  it  involves  reciprocity.  Understood  as  activity  constitutive  of  an
intersubjective  community,  communication  presupposes  meaning.
The uncodable meaning results from an irreplaceable localization and of a socio-
historical context that, simply put, the new technologies bracket or even destroy.
In traditional societies, or in their local relics, this meaning is not the object of any
objectification. Customary usage is tacit respect for rules that seal the pact of
membership in a community in which one is “always already” a part. It is this
dimension  that  is  threatened  by  the  privilege  of  the  cognitive  and  the
performative.
What is important is to keep this distance which still characterizes meaning. It
generates  an  opacity  whose  disappearance  signifies  the  reduction  of
communication to information. “The transparency and the obscenity of space in
the promiscuity of the networks”, to quote Baudrillard (1981, p. 93), dissipates the
opacity in which there is no communication.
CONCLUSION
While current literatures are still talking about economic and material interests,
psychological securities and insecurities, and desires of populations to become
part  of  modern  history,  we  contend  that  these  designations  are  surface
appearances  of  Western  modernization,  with  metaphysical  and  ontological
grounds that have been unrecognized. While we are not the first ones to suggest

Machine Logic and Values
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   115
that formal and mathematical processes are involved in articulating the world, our
claim  is  that  there  has  not  been  a  recognition  that  the  formal-quantitative
procedures are, at the base, metaphysical and, therefore, free from the constraints
of space and time, and that they have assumed priority over the material. We
contend that the conditions for the possibility of globalization are not economic,
psychological, or even ideological, but rather they are signitive. The reason for
this claim is that, before a particular person in a global economy will acquire the
economic  conditions  to  better  their  lives,  they  have  already  been  informed
signitively  of  what  is  the  better  life.  And  the  better  life  is  the  possession  of
modern technology—specifically information technology, such as computers and
their logic, and above all, the value preferences imbedded in this logic. This logic,
in turn, is the end of temporality, the end of history; it is an all-encompassing
logic that can transmit its values to any village with promises of the production of
anything that the logic signifies in a global (or a local) economy. Of course, the
villages  would  be  able  to  access  the  information  once  they  have  accepted  the
latest computer—to access this information. The latter is laden with value offers,
specifically with images of the “good life” that will require the materialization of
this signitive power. We see the images, and then we buy into the global economy
to materialize those images in the forms of beauty, sunglasses, jeans, Kellogg’s
cereal,  and  sundry  overproduced  and  overpriced  cheap  commodities.  The
computer is the metaphysical logic that has the power to accomplish this task. On
this, we shall not make a judgment as to whether this accomplishment destroys or
saves the multiple ways people have lived or want to continue to live. Will they
be absorbed into the metaphysics of transformation of their environments in order
to join the global nexus? Or, will they be able to maintain their own difference by
virtue  of  the  mass  means  provided  by  the  acquisition  of  computers  and  their
logic?  These  questions  subtend  the  entire  discussion  of  multiculturism,
environmental  protection,  and  even  the  rights  of  peoples  to  self-determination.

CHAPTER 7
The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
Abstract:  Uncovering  the  temporal  reflex  of  the  Internet  of  Things  within  the
organizational environment affirms the transformational mode of our technological
life-world. We live in an atemporal reflex, which involves more than the combination
of past, present, and future, and more than the mere interconnectivity of a series of
nodes, but it is a self-pacing system, creating some possibilities which are unintended
consequences.  The  unintended  consequences  can  be  anticipated  in  what  may  be
foreseen as a type of foresight of what can be next. Such fore-knowledge allows risk
mitigation at all levels of society: organizational, interpersonal, cultural, and, of course,
civilizational. Temporal reflexivity is the link or hinge of human-machine co-operation
and complementarity.
Keywords:  Emergence,  Perception,  Relevance,  Re-presentation,  Selectivity,

INTRODUCTION: FIRST THINGS, FIRST
Social progress cannot be arbitrary but rather is dependent on the implications of
the world of things. The embodiment of a symbolized sensibility contains more
than the intention of the subject or a group of subjects because it is an objective
perspective  on  things.  Sense  implies  more  than  the  particular  intention  of  the
subject  because  it  does  not  depend  upon  the  subject’s  projection.  The  subject
correlates  him/herself  to  it  and  expresses  it  through  activity.  Only  if  the
symbolized sensibilities are stored perceptual sensibilities of things with their own
implications can social productions direct the subject to future development.
Based  on  intersubjective  foundations,  the  subjects  in  each  society  create  their
world and determine the kind of reality each social order has. But there is no
criterion  provided  between  advanced  or  culturally  richer  times  and  culturally
inferior times. Hence, each social order and its age are equally absolute. This is
not a satisfactory perspective. History has shown that social orders differ. How is
this  possible  for  us—embedded  in  a  particular  culture—to  understand  other
cultures? In terms of our discussion of the consciousness of perceptual sense,
limited perspective and totality, we can present a criterion of the advancement,
differentiations, and development of societies.

Mickunas and Pilotta
Every society, by developing certain perspectives of the world of things, is open
to the implications of future development, or the more. In our view, the same
world  of  things  can  be  expressed  in  many  ways,  dependent  upon  an  adopted
perspective. This allows us to understand different societies from the perspectives
of the subjects of other social orders. We can enter their perspective and interpret
ourselves in terms of it.
We have determined that the possibility of our understanding of other societies
indicates  something  common  between  them:  the  commonness  in  the  world  of
things,  with  its  different  perspectives  and  characteristics.  A  methodological
problem which phenomenological social science must face is this: If one theorizes
that the subject is a product of his/her society, then the theory one holds about
societies  cannot  be  generalized  as  applicable  to  all  societies.  If,  as  we  claim,
societies depend on the perspectives of the world of things in terms of which the
subjects within a given society interpret themselves, then it is evident that subjects
from  one  society  are  capable  of  understanding  those  of  other  societies.  The
possibility of viewing the world of things from that other perspective opens our
own  horizons  and  presents  new  possibilities  for  self-understanding.  Hence,  a
multitude  of  societies—or  realities,  or  “world  views”—does  not  deny  the
necessity of ontological things. In short, based on the sensuous universal thesis,
multiple  world-views  or  multiple  realities  are  nevertheless  views  of  the  same
world. Based on this criterion of one-world, we can indicate that the changes in
humanity  throughout  history  have  depended  upon  the  different  relationships
humans have had toward the world of things which, correlatively, reveal different
human possibilities.
The  ontological  thing  is  a  necessary  prerequisite  for  the  explanation  of  the
coherence of cooperative experience, which is fundamental to species-being. The
thing  can  be  grasped  from  an  unlimited  number  of  perspectives.  Hence,  the
subject can act in terms of a perspective, which correlates to the affective qualities
of things. The subject relates to things as a total being.
The total subject is a conscious being with an indefinite set of capacities that
manifest the subject from a particular perspective. While manifesting the subject,
the  capacities  are  correlates  of  the  perspective  of  things  and  thus  present  the
different characteristics of things to the conscious subjects. Thus, the total subject
is a process of:
1. The manifestation of the subject in and through his/her actualized capacities
which are expressions of the subject; and
2. The actualization of the subject’s capacities, which correlate to the particular
perspective of things, expressing the things to the subject. The process of the

The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   119
subject’s self-manifestation in and through an increasing number of capacities
“totalizes” the subject’s self-expression of things to the subject.
Totality is a process toward the maximum self-expression of the subject in terms
of the maximum expression of the world of things to the subject. The subject,
acting in terms of a thing from a particular perspective, expresses oneself as a
whole  in  a  limited  manner.  The  idea  of  totality  is  not  merely  a  direction  for
cognition. It is inherent in subjective activity, which is a mediation between the
conscious subject and the things with their total implications. It drives human
action from its limited character, as perspectival and partial self-expression, to the
more. These more (or indeterminate) possibilities loom, so to speak, on every
horizon of the subject’s life and indicate one’s present limits while continuously
implying other possibilities.
We have claimed that the thing manifests itself in and through its perspectives.
Perspectives  are  the  temporal  manifestations  of  the  unified  thing.  The  thing
becomes in and through its perspectives. The thing is a synthetic unity that is in
the  process  of  self-manifestation  in  correlation  to  its  context.  The  present
perspectives of the unified thing stand on a horizon of consequences. The sensible
is not one perspectival meaning of the thing, but also the implications to the past,
the  future,  and  to  the  thing’s  context.  In  short,  we  have  a  field  of  sensible
perspectives  or  expressions  of  the  thing  which  are  implied  in  the  present
perspective.  These  are  not  formal  implications,  but  content  implications.  The
principle of relevance indicates the relevance of the context in which things exist.
Whatever action we may attribute to the thing through its perspective, we cannot
conceive of it outside its context.
From this viewpoint, we observe a horizon-like fusion between the thing and the
action which the thing undergoes from other things. We can say that the thing
undergoes actions and transmits them. For things, the distinction from every other
thing is never perfectly realized. They possess relative unity and independence.
The thing supports itself on the multitude of things surrounding it. The individual
thing  is  a  relative  subsistence.  The  thing  exists  within  a  context,  and  the
implication of its context is identical to the relevance of the context for the thing’s
existence. It must be clear that not everything within the context is relevant to the
thing.  Relevance  indicates  what  is  needed  for  the  thing’s  continuation  in
existence. For example, equality is symbolic “of the need for more” of something
in the situation.
Relevance  in  phenomenology  is  relevance  to  the  subject.  From  the  social
phenomenological  viewpoint,  relevance  denotes  a  relationship  in  which  the
concrete objects are relevant to the subject’s plans and designs (Schutz, 1962-

120   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
1966, pp. 227-228). A particular thing is relevant not to other things within a
context, but to the subject and his/her projects. Such a view is not acceptable. If
relevance were not basically a contextual relationship among things, then it would
be  impossible  to  determine  how  things  could  be  integrated  into  a  system  of
relevance for the subject. We must remember that on the basis of the sensuous
universal, sense inheres in things.
The principle of relevance can be explicated further through meaning. It must not
be assumed that the context makes the thing ultimately meaningful as though the
thing were a conjunction point of a system of sensible relations. As we recall, the
thing as a whole is a synthetic unity, and the qualities express the sense of the
thing  in  a  particular  way  or  from  a  particular  perspective.  This  particular
perspective is expressive of the thing and is grasped by perceptual activity as
“perceptual sense”. It is the unity of the thing which gives unity and synthesis to
its  manifested  perspectives  and  correlatively  gives  unity  and  synthesis  to  the
perceptual  meanings.  The  context  actualizes  the  thing’s  specific  sense  from  a
perspective through which the relevance of the context is indicated. It can be said
that the specification of the sense of the thing, within its context, depends upon
the perspective of the thing which is revealed by the context. This means that the
complete  knowledge  of  the  unified  thing  requires  the  knowledge  of  the
manifestation  of  the  sense  of  the  thing  in  differentiated  and  relevant  contexts.
Although the particular manifestations of the thing within a context do not totally
determine what the thing is, they present a perspective of the thing correlative to
the particular context. For example, a building is not seen only as a building, but
also as a courthouse, implying a total context relevant to it: it relates itself to
trials, police enforcement, judges, lawyers, and such. The relevant context is thus
correlated to the particular perspectives of the thing. The manifestations of the
thing, within a particular context, yield a perspective of the thing.
With the principle of relevance, we determine that each thing in context implies
its context, and things of the context imply their own context; therefore, there is a
continuity toward totality, which means that sensibility is self-referencing. Things
imply their relevant context and other things, which in turn imply their contexts.
The continuous implication of things and their contexts means that a particular
thing  implies  a  totality,  and  correlatively  a  thing  leads  the  subject  in  his/her
cognition toward the cognition of the totality implied by the thing and its context.
Hence, relevance is not merely a centripetal movement but a centrifugal one as
well.

The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   121
INTERCONNECTING
The framework of electronically connecting just about any person and anything to
one another, thereby improving interaction with and within diverse industries and
households,  is  called  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT).  The  trend  makes  us  think
differently about time and space as we experience them, for instance, on the shop
floor of a manufacturing enterprise like General Motors or Proctor & Gamble.
Some of the factors that are and/or will be transformed relating to time and space
include:
a. Near and far will “feel” the same. Nothing will be “remote”.
b.  There  will  be  no  top  or  bottom  viewpoint  of  what  is  happening  inside  the
facility.
c. Who is to be let into the network (and who and where to leave out) will be a
tough decision. Suppliers to the company can help; will customers’ access be
helpful? The meaning of trust will arise.
d. Managing closeness. Human interaction with connected “things” will be a part
of the data stream in the workflow. No one will be able to hide; personal space
and privacy will have to be defined to keep the climate from becoming invasive.
Also, people connected with their collaborators on cloud-based platforms will
have to assert their identity and personality in these interactions.
e.  Data  will  flow  quickly  across  the  network,  which  will  wash  away  many
beginnings and endings which determine a product’s lifecycle. Instead, a cycle of
redesign, re-engineering, updating, and revisioning will keep many products “like
new” for as long as the end user wishes. A swirl of relentless innovation and
evolution is possible.
INNOVATION AND TIME
In any innovation, the present includes a future horizon of expectations of relevant
possibilities providing an orientation for experience and research activity. The
relevant possibilities, belonging to the present project, are part of the project in the
mode of the future horizon. The past horizon does not vanish into oblivion since it
is required and retained for the comprehension of the future horizon. The present
is thus a temporal field consisting of active past and future horizons constituting a
field of orientations of action and experience. Hence, each activity occurs within a
temporal field where the coming future and retained past are co-present and are
manifested in the activity within a given project. What has been accomplished by
others and what is being done with the project continues to be present for the

122   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
understanding of what is being done and what is about to be done. Moreover,
what is about to be done is a condition for the understanding of what is being
done and was done. For innovation, such temporal awareness is relevant to the
extent that students and teachers will learn from the innovations of the past. How
innovations were accomplished, what transformations in thinking and application
were  relevant  to  surpass  the  achievements  of  the  predecessors,  and  what
possibilities  were  signified  by  such  achievements.  In  this  sense,  this  time  of
learning and experience is a field. If human actions are based on a temporal field,
then humans are not only temporal, but also historical beings. This means that,
through  actions,  humans  make  their  history,  and  since  history  arises  through
human  action,  then  the  very  being  of  a  human  is  the  history  she  makes.
This  means,  furthermore,  that  although  we  may  analyze  “natural  facts”,  their
properties, and their temporal orientations, we shall discover that facts function
and assume orientations within a context of significations, and this is more so
with respect to the “facts” invented by humans through education. In principle,
such  “facts”  are  the  results  of  innovations  from  which  one  can  learn  how
subsequent  innovations  can  be  achieved.
Not all events play a role in human activity; they are selected and interpreted
according  to  their  significance  in  the  context  of  a  particular  project  and  its
horizons.  Conversely,  the  horizons  are  also  present  selectively:  significant
possibilities are selected, and insignificant ones are rejected. In biotechnologies,
Americans  have  been  innovating  in  the  area  of  genetically  engineered  food
products, but learning about such innovations by European young people requires
the  placing  of  this  technology  in  a  European  life-world  where  genetically
engineered  vegetables  are  contested,  and  thus  the  horizon  of  possibilities  of
innovation in this area will have to be postponed. In addition, arguments must be
presented, on the basis of values that would have to change, if genetic engineering
is to be a domain selected for education. Thus, past values play a role in the future
selectivity  of  what  innovations  will  be  possible.  Although  our  process  of
selectivity  may  leap  over  events,  their  historical  continuity  consists  of  their
significance within the temporal field. Even if the events are past and causally no
longer efficient, their significance is still present. This does not mean that the
significance of events follows a linear succession; rather, the significance of the
past event belongs to the present temporal field and its horizons of possibilities. It
either expands or contracts the horizons by permitting the selectivity of more or
less remote events as relevant within the present temporal field of learning. It is
also clear that the present field is multilayered and thus replete with options such
that certain options are taken up while others remain present in a tacit mode—to
be activated if the horizon discloses their relevance and value.

The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   123
The expansion of a past horizon does not imply that the entire significance of
history may be captured. There may be events whose significance and the truth
will manifest themselves only in the future. Truth itself is historical and reveals
itself in historical times. The teacher of science is also a historian who knows how
to read events—not as facts, but significatively; the teacher may see the relevance
of some past events reflected on the future horizon. In brief, the significance of an
event  transcends  its  present  toward  the  past  and  future  and  the  mere  factual
description  of  the  event.  The  same  holds  true  for  past  and  future  events.
Moreover, the future horizon may reveal a hitherto unnoticed significance of past
or present events and add to the constitution of continuity and unity of social
events and their historical development.
SELECTIVITY
An in-depth investigation of the temporal field of activity is by itself inadequate
without an extensive study of life-world structures as limitations to the selectivity
of  significant  and  relevant  events  and  possibilities.  In  the  context  delineated
above, Luhmann (1982) has contributed extensively to the understanding of the
relationship between the temporal field and social structures. His suggestions are
crucial for any progress in this area. Luhmann accepts the differentiation between
the temporal field and the theoretical-linear time, and he adds a qualification with
respect  to  the  selectivity  of  events.  Past,  present,  and  future  events  assume
significance and orientation, not only within the temporal field of learning but
also within the horizons, views, concepts, and prescribed selectivity by a life-
world. Consequently, the structure of the temporal field of learning is limited by
the  life-world  and  its  selected-selectable  possibilities.  Moreover,  the  open
horizons  constitute  the  region  of  possibilities  outside  the  ken  of  the  social
structure: In terms of the social structure, they are impossible. Yet, precisely such
“impossible-possibilities” define the limit of a life-world and its horizons and
predelineates the orientation for fundamental innovations. An awareness of the
limits  of  a  life-world  and  its  possibilities  is  required  for  any  fundamental
innovative activity. And yet, the awareness of such a limit assumes a presence of
a  possibility  by  which  to  judge  the  limit  and  toward  which  to  orient  the
fundamental learning of innovations. Precisely at this point, the dialogical process
in  education  becomes  the  sharpest—debating  such  limits,  discovering  what
meaning factors are at play, and how those can be challenged and transformed.
It follows then that, within a life-world context, not all possibilities are equal;
some are more remote than others, and thus not all are equally significant. It could
be  said  that  the  socially  impossible  is  socially  unrealizable;  socially,  it  is  an
impossible  possibility  and  reveals  the  limits  of  a  life-world.  Of  course,  the
interrelationships between the possible and impossible are quite complex. What

124   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
may be possible politically may be only remotely possible or even impossible
economically; what is possible economically may not be possible technologically.
Thus, certain events may be excluded for the time being and become past for the
social  system.  (Religions  have  become  a  private  matter  and  no  longer  mix  in
political-public affairs). Yet, they may be reinstated as significant for the social
future  provided  a  shift  in  the  life-world  signification  of  events  and  temporal
horizons have occurred. (Thus, more recently, the same religions have assumed
political meanings and have shifted the interpretation of events, thus transforming
what is significant for today and for the future). Of course, such a shift requires an
understanding  of  “time  reflex”  as  a  means  of  relating  the  social  system  to  its
possibilities  and  these,  in  turn,  to  the  temporal  field  of  action.  The  required
complexities of time reflexes cannot be developed here, but they will be reserved
for the next section. Fig. (1) shows the modalization of the internet experience,
whereas  Table  1  lists  the  combinations  of  temporal  moments  which  can  be
experienced.

TIME REFLEX
Although there are two major aspects constituting the time reflex, their structures
are similar. Hence, we shall deal with one and refer to the other when necessary.
The limits of the socially possible constitute a temporal horizon for a particular
society which reflects the process of current events. Such events are temporal, and
their orientation, selectivity and significance are reflected from both the future
and past horizons. This is the first “time reflex”. Since events are temporal, then
the time reflex is also temporal, with constantly shifting possibilities at the limits
of the socially possible. The limits of the socially possible are manifest only with
respect to socially impossible possibilities. These constitute the open horizon of
the temporal field of learning, which is the basis for the historical development
and orientation of a social process. This is the second time reflex. It reflects the
limits  of  the  socially  possible.  Since  the  social  selectivity  process  of  events
requires  temporal  horizons  of  the  socially  possible,  then  the  temporal  field
constitutes a prerequisite for the understanding of the social processes, their limits
and  historical  transformations,  showing,  at  this  point,  the  innovative
achievements.  Were  we  limited  to  the  current  social  conditions  and  socially

predelineated  possibilities,  as  sociologists  conceive  that  we  are,  then  no
fundamental  scientific  transformation  could  occur.  This  is  not  to  deny  the
limitations constantly imposed by a life-world and its possibilities; nevertheless,
such limitations are not absolute. We remain open within the temporal field of
education which manifests the limits of the social structure and the possibilities of
its  transformation.  Hence,  the  temporal  field  is  fundamental  both  for  social
transformation and for the relationship between social structure and its temporal
development and orientation. This relationship can now be described as “time
reflex”.

Any  innovative  learning  functions  within  a  life-world  and  time,  consequently
assuming the temporal field. In fact, as already noted, such learning is totally
correlated to the temporal field and its horizons. Hence, let us take as an example
the activity of inquiring into society and its temporal process. The investigation is
correlated to the selected events and possibilities of a given social structure; yet,
the investigation requires a limit from which a life-world may be seen. We know
that  a  life-world  as  a  system  reproduces  its  own  memory  of  the  history  of
selectivity, of experience of the environment. A life-world, in its complexity of
meanings,  limits  which  experiences  will  count  as  relevant  and  valid  and  also
which factors of the environment will be relevant for learning and innovation.
Yet, beyond this, it reconstructs a world-history of unaccomplished selectivity
required to grasp the limit of its selectivity and introduce fundamental innovations
that would change not only technologies, but also signify all other factors in a
life-world.
Europe  is  facing  a  quandary  of  legal  issues  with  respect  to  the  speed  of
technological innovations. The laws that are available cannot handle the meaning
and value of all the novelties implying a horizon of possibilities of novel laws,
either as restrictions of technical innovations, or their delegation to specific areas

126   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
of a European life-world. Thus, the “impossible possibilities” in a life-world must
be considered with respect to what they imply integrally across all other meaning
levels of a life-world. This complexity is part of the curriculum for innovation,
and the benefits for society are vast since the innovators will learn not only the
ways to advance their field, but also what the advancement means for all other
domains:  economic,  legal,  valuative,  moral,  health,  educational,  and  political
decisions. In brief, the temporal field horizon has an indefinite depth of temporal
possibilities which reflect the temporal horizons of life-world possibilities, their
limits, and innovative transgressions. Hence, time reflex, while relating a life-
world structure to the temporal field of learning, provides a fundamental context
for the activity of innovative learning.
During  the  learning  activity,  the  present  shifts  from  one  event  to  another  that
include shifts not only in the horizons of the present, but also in those of the
present of the past and the present of the future. Shifts in the present of the present
include shifts in its horizons and correlatively call for shifts in the horizons of the
presents of past and future. Yet, such a call is possible on the basis of the time
reflex. The present temporal field, due to its time reflex, extends and overlaps
with past and future temporal fields. What were still future possibilities and even
impossibilities for the present of the past, may be realized in the present and even
establish  our  future  horizon  of  not-yet-realized  possibilities  and  limiting
impossibilities. This appears in various ways. For example, in a legal domain of a
life-world, a constitution written in the past may be articulated at present for its
possible reinterpretation as to what it might have meant in the past and what such
reinterpretation  might  mean  for  future  cases  involving  previously  unimagined
innovations.
TIME REFLEX AND WORLD
The concept of world is critical to the enterprise of founding a communication-
based theory of the social and cultural. The relationship between meaning and the
world can be described as the concept of decentering. As a meaning, the world is
accessible everywhere: in every situation, in any detail, at each point of the scale
from concrete to abstract.
At  the  same  time,  the  world  is  more  than  a  mere  sum  comprehending  all
possibilities, and all meaning references. It is not just the sum, but the unity of
these  possibilities  above  all;  this  means  that  the  world  horizon  for  every
difference guarantees its own unity as difference. It sublates the difference in all
perspectives from individual systems, in that for every system, the world is the
unity  of  its  own  difference  between  system  and  environment.  Efforts  to  view
technology,  politics,  and  culture  set  in  motion  a  quest  to  reconsider  the

The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   127
cultural/political  categories  of  history,  individuation,  praxis,  and  power  in
concrete phenomena. Such reconsiderations of these categories have been cast in a
pure  communication  structure  of  dialogic  undermining  cherished  glosses  of
communication  praxis,  dialectical  historicism,  culture,  and  text  as  interpretive
explanations of concrete political life. However, the concept of world needs to be
explored as a universal presumption. Therefore, world as the concrete fundament
of life appears through presentation and de-presentation and concrete possibilities.
The  way  of  world  cannot  be  encountered  in  the  context  of  human-world
relationships.  Only  in  a  non-thinking  moment  can  we  think  of  human-world
relationships as an encounter between two things. The dominant in the model is
inner-worldly relationships. Each inner-worldly thing has an identity of self and
other-relatedness, where the sense of identity demands the sense of difference:
Identity and difference belong together. It is one of the basic ontological aspects
in  the  Western  tradition  ending  in  Hegel’s  dialectic  (1966)  of  identity  and
difference.  And  the  human,  seen  as  inner-worldly,  is  destined  by  “self”  and
“other” relationships. The question is whether such a destiny, a de-termination,
makes sense without a much deeper and accessible way pervading the human.
World is not the most extreme limit and boundary of inner-worldly things; it is
not a framework or a container. Humans do not take residence in the world as
worms in an apple or money in a bank. All the trusted modalities of “being-in” of
things are not applicable—not even metaphorically. World is not an object or a
region, a time of all times, regardless of our evocations of finitude and infinity.
Neither is world the sum of all humanly known objects and subjects. The sum of
such  knowledge  is  no  less  remote  from  the  world  than  the  knowledge  of  an
individual. We, while in the world, encounter things and others, yet nowhere do
we encounter the world as a thing, an object, or an other. Rather, the world is an
openness  to  things  and  of  things.  After  all,  the  various  regions  of  things,  the
living,  the  dying,  the  tactile  and  the  remote,  have  not  been  exhausted—and
perhaps  are  not  exhaustible—and  only  our  meager  knowledge  is  limited.
World  understanding  must  encompass  the  notions  of  being,  context,
consciousness, and the self-understanding of the human. Thus, we must consider
how it is that the inner-worldly ways transmute into objects for consciousness.
Husserl points to the main sail of cosmological thought: the differences between
the  world-lending  of  and  the  inner-worldly  objectivity-subjectivity  (and  their
relationship) of events (see Bruzina, 2004). Events appear either in themselves or
for  us.  But  is  this  all  that  there  is:  the  appearing  things,  the  things  and  their
appearance  to  us?  What  of  timing,  spacing,  lighting  changing,  and  so  forth?
Intentionality falls short. Timing seems closer to world. This may be the joining
of human openness for world and world’s self-constitution—the joining where
timing and world-time are not yet distinct. If this is the case, then reflection is a

128   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
temporalization of a temporalization with pre-given distances and nearnesses of
time and space, of significative dimensions assumed both in pre-reflective moves
and reflection upon such moves. Reflection is, therefore, basically a world reflex,
allowing a movement of temporalization within time, and time as such must here
be understood a-temporally (alpha privative).
It is possible to glimpse now, although in a sketchy manner, world-time, or at
least to suggest a way more akin to world-time. Let us think along the world-
expansive present, the way it may lend motion, and the presence of all things and
events. We must think of the world-expansive dimensions and how they lend the
motion of emergence into presence and demise into absence.
EMERGENCE
Our discussion points out that the unified thing contains more potential than is
manifested by it at any given moment; the manifestations depend upon a given
context. Within a specific context, potentialities actualize and manifest the thing
from a particular perspective. Scientists experiment with things by introducing
them into different contexts in order to discover the characteristics that are not
manifest. In fact, without the “more” as potency, we would be unable to account
for the phenomena of coherent change. Because there is more in movement than
in successive positions attributed to the moving objects, more in becoming than in
the forms passed through, the latter can be derived from the former. In short, there
is more to the thing than in the manifestation of the present perspective. It is the
aspect  of  “more”  which  requires  potentiality  to  be  one  of  the  fundamental
ontological  categories.
Modern  science,  philosophy  and  social  science  have  the  tendency  to  view
“reality” as wholly actual. That precludes becoming; so, we would be precluded
from saying a child “becomes a woman”. If everything is actual, then “becoming”
means “becoming that which already is actual”. To say the actual child is already
an  actual  woman  is  totally  unintelligible.  Potentiality  is  part  of  the  a  priori
correlation of intelligibility. It is “the something more” which is constantly being
revealed—only, it is never exhausted. The “something more” is potentiality in the
sense of “that which is not yet actual, but which—given certain conditions—will
become actual”. The thing could have had a different history if the circumstances
of its existence had been different. It could have displayed other characteristics,
and could have affected environing entities in different ways. The unified thing
acts in terms of its context and contains the capacity to readjust itself to varying
contexts.
From this discussion, we can move to the ontological principle that is required for
an explanation of the world of things.

The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   129
Required:
1. An intrinsically unified thing, which manifests itself in and through its temporal
perspectives. It is more potentially than the combination of its characteristics or
perspectives at any given time.
2.  The  unified  thing  is  dependent  on  its  context  for  the  manifestation  of  its
specific perspectives. The thing, while interacting with its context, tends toward
the  preservation  of  its  being  as  an  actualization  of  its  potentialities.  The
actualization of the potentialities indicates that the end toward which the thing
tends is intrinsic to it: self-actualization in the process of interaction with the
relevant things of its context.
We shall briefly discuss the above two points in terms of evolution because of the
predominant  influence  of  the  theory  of  “emergent  evolution”  in  complexity
theory, chaos theory, and Deleuzian evolutionary theory. Emergent evolution’s
basic position is that it is a fact that the emergence of novelties cannot be reduced
to  pre-existing  events.  This  is  the  foundation  of  emergent  evolution.  We  can
agree. Yet, the emergent theory claims that novelty emerges from that which was
not there. With that claim, we cannot agree.
If new characteristics emerge, then there must be a unified thing which contains
within  itself  the  potentiality  for  the  new  or  novel  characteristics  because  they
relate  themselves  actively  to  other  things  in  terms  of  which  they  reveal  or
manifest  the  novel  characteristics.  Emergent  theory  cannot  answer  how
emergence is possible because it does not account for a unified thing which is
more than the present characteristics. It attempts to derive the “more” from the
“less”, and at the same time, it wishes to claim that the more is not reducible to
the  less.  If  there  is  nothing  more  in  the  unified  things  than  the  presently
manifested  characteristics,  then  there  is  no  emergence,  but  a  change  or  a
succession of different phenomena. An intelligible theory of emergence requires
an assumption of a unified thing that evolves, which is more “potentiality” than
any  given  evolutionary  process  or  emergence  state.  We  do  not  have  a  set  of
phenomena derivable from or reducible to previous phenomena, but a succession
of manifestations of the potential of the unified thing. Furthermore, the relevant
context which evokes the actualization and hence the manifestation of the thing’s
potentialities must consist of things that have their own intrinsic unities. Without
these unities, the context would not retain the required stability, and hence there
would  be  no  orientation  to  distinguish  between  “relevant”  and  “irrelevant”
contexts. In short, we require an intrinsic unity of both the given thing and the
things constituting its relevant context. The relationship to a particular context

130   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
actualizes  the  potentialities  and  gives  rise  to  the  emergence  of  novel
characteristics  of  the  thing.
There  cannot  be  an  emergence  of  novelty  unless  the  novelty  is  an  actualized
potency  of  the  thing;  otherwise,  we  would  get  more  from  less  without  an
explanation of how it is possible to transfer the less into the more. It is preferable
to call “emergence” the unfolding of potentiality contained within the a-temporal
level  of  the  unified  thing.  Novelty,  if  not  based  on  the  principle  of  unity  and
potentiality, loses its meaning and becomes mere change. If novelty is not based
on these principles, then human striving for knowledge is doomed to failure from
the very beginning. In fact, it would not even be possible to distinguish between
failure and success.
Signification  is  already  sedimented,  already  given  in  corporeal,  linguistic
gestures, in institutions as a surging-forth of a “pre-history”, a temporally non-
localizable event, yet an event which is manifest in the corporeal “here and now”
(Mead, 1932, pp. 212-213). This event is, of course, one of signification, and
significance  without  temporality  is  always  given  in  a  modality  of  corporeal,
institutional, sedimented rooting, lending the significance a localized modality,
which  is  immediately  transcended  because  the  signification  leads  facticities
“vertically” into the future and the past. The historical, social, and individuated
significations crisscross intercorporeity in its inner dialectical process.
If  corporeity  is  the  sedimentation  of  modes  of  signification,  both  novel  and
institutionalized, then it is also historically intercorporeal. It is everything that is
acquired  through  our  collective  history,  everything  that  the  factually  manifest
significations of historical events communicate in and through our speaking, our
gestures, and our silence. This means that corporeity is more than can be grasped
empirically and intellectually. If the body is the background by virtue of which the
world  is  there  for  us—the  signification  and  openness  toward  the  world,  the
medium  of  world  possession—then  its  traces  can  be  found  inscribed  in  all
institutions and human achievements and can be identical with such institutions.
The  corporeal,  the  built  institutions,  comprise  just  as  much  a  locus  of  the
sedimented depth of historical and institutionalized meaning, sweeping across our
very  gestures,  and  prolonging  themselves  in  our  corporeal  movements.  They
propagate  themselves  in  our  speaking  and  are,  in  turn,  supported  by  the  very
gestures which signify such institutionally sedimented significances, giving them
a new shape, a novel configuration to be sedimented and manifest in gestures of
generations to come. This is the historical process in a concrete intercorporeal
sense.

The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   131
The inner dialectical region consists of the traces left by the other in everything
we encounter: in the books we read, the presence of the other is given; in the food
we buy, the other is implicated; in the implements we employ, the labor of the
other is communicated. At the same time, the implementalities have their own
anonymity. They communicate with one another and draw the very subject into
their system of interconnections. Recall that a house implies a family, the family a
socio-economic  system,  its  history  and  all  the  configurations  of  experience,
perception,  and  modes  of  being.
Our  paradigm  of  the  limited-transcendent  has  shown  how  the  world  became
visible.  On  the  basis  of  concrete  corporeality,  implementalities  “communicate
their  sense”  one  to  the  other,  and  the  participants  with  the  implementalities
communicate with one another along the system of significative interconnections
inscribed in such implementalities. This is also valid for all institutions—inclusive
of  our  own  modes  of  comportment,  moving  along  the  historically  interpreted
notion of the world. Thus, the inner dialectical region is all-inclusive. Humans
need not seek to demonstrate the existence of “other minds” but find the presence
of  the  other  in  institutions,  implementalities,  and  their  “inner  dialectical”
interconnections, which reveal the shape and the work of the other. The “depth”
of significance is visible when transcendence becomes a dimension of the human
world.
The  species-nature  of  human  experiences  is  transmitted  through  successive
generations, but it is mediated through present experience. Yet, universal history
requires an act of simultaneity, an all-at-once, or an a-temporal experience of
history. Therefore, a universal or trans-historical sense of history is required to
realize the Marxian project. Human sensibilities have a history, and it is through
this history that we may become aware of it. Therefore, the introduction of the
history of sense also demands that humans must have a sense of history. This
double awareness must be clarified.
Let us recall the phenomenological understanding of experience. Experience is
always an experience of sense, of signification, of the meaning of things and of an
implicit generality, typology, or style, and thus of something relatively permanent
in the flux of facticities. The sense, the style of the real encountered in experience
correlates  to  specific  experiential  processes  such  as  judgment,  wondering,
predicating, and distinguishing, wherein the real appears as this kind, this nature,
this style, and this orientation. The question is thus: “What kind of experiences is
required per se in order for a particular kind of being or a particular type of event
to be present?” This means that the question concerning the types and kinds of
beings, their sense, becomes a question of experience and the mode of experience
wherein  such  kinds,  types  and  senses  are  constituted.  Experience  is  thus

132   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
conceived as an activity of sense-constitution wherein being of a particular kind
or type is signified. Sense designates universal structures comprising a matrix for
the experience of entities of various kinds, types, and styles. Yet, this matrix is not
abstract from the events and facticities embedded in the matrix. Everything that is
perceived has a background of the past (no-longer) and the future (not-yet). This
is present as co-continuous with what is being perceived in terms of significative
implications in a continuous process of experience. This constitutes a horizon
which is not only background, but is also such that each experienced thing has a
horizon to be pursued indefinitely, a continuity of significative implications and
clues which are constantly sedimented in experience and manifest in our gestures,
language,  and  institutions.  These  continuous  significations  are  given  in
accordance  with  generalities  and  typologies  indicating  the  kinds  of  further
experiential  acts  and  orientations  one  must  perform.  The  social  world  is  thus
encountered inner-dialectically as a collective concept of these indices of possible
orientations  of  experience  and  the  senses  of  things  and  events.  It  is  an  all-
encompassing horizon of the possibility of experiencing, containing sedimented
modalities in our institutions and pointing to novel typological possibilities yet to
come (Pilotta & McCaughan, 2012, pp. 131-133).
This worldly motion of lending emergence and demise should not be identified
with the world-expansive everyday world transition. The everyday world and the
world-time must be distinguished in terms of cosmological differences. It must
also be noted that, as things and events have an expanse from not-yet, present, and
no-longer, the inner-temporal phenomena must also be thought of temporally. It
has been an old habit to think that the things and events must be given—or better,
show themselves—only now. The past is no more, and the future is not yet. But, if
things and events are not essential but temporal, then we cannot think of an event
without the everyday horizons and the transition from one to the other. Thus, the
appearance  of  something  or  an  event  is  basically  an  appearing,  and  also  a
disappearing. (An appearance here must be understood as a temporal formation of
something or an event whereby phenomena are lent their configurations along the
transition of the world-expansive, everyday dimensions of not-yet, present, and
no-longer).
There is not only a tension, but also a forming/deforming. This means that one
cannot validly proclaim that the thing or event has a form, or had a form which it
lost, since the loss is a losing and, at the same time, a formation along the traces
of deformation. The deformation is a formation tracing the deformation in itself;
this is one aspect of depth-time since the formation is not after the deformation
but is the depth of the no-longer tracing itself in the deformation. The formation
and deformation and the deformation-formation have a transparent depth. The
depth is possible if we understand the notion of events, but as a self-formation of

The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   133
temporal  configurations;  temporal  depth  is  the  very  transparent  visibility  of
things.
If we were to think along the three temporal dimensions, we could have a way
where there is a formation-deformation-formation identical with those temporal
dimensions  whereby  the  present  formation  is  an  inscription  of  temporal
configuration  and  is  at  the  same  time  a  deformation  transparent  through  the
formation as its temporal depth “toward the past” and a formation transparent
with  its  “temporal  future”.  In  brief,  every  phenomenon  is  not  merely  an
appearance  of  a  thing  or  an  event  as  a  property,  but  more  fundamentally,
transparency of the dimensional depth of time, not “one after the other”. Hence,
the world-expansive transition lends things and events their face, but the face is
also  a  worldly  face  and  not  merely  a  thing-appearance—beyond  things  in  the
world.  The  inner-worldly  appearance  is  the  “transition”  across  the  time
dimensions. The problem of world-time lies in the way that it “lets phenomena
be”, that is, the phenomenality of the appearance. What lends appearance to their
phenomenality is the dimensional shift, the formation-deformation-formation as
dimensional time-depth inscribing the appearance of things, which is not identical
with  the  new  characteristics  of  things.  Yet,  the  phenomena  here  are  not
appearances unto the subject; at best, the subject is identical to the shift of the
temporal dimensions. Nevertheless, we can have an initial glimpse, even if it is
still  in  terms  of  the  everyday  world  dimensions,  into  the  world-time  as  not
successive but as all-pervasive. It must be noted that here the ontological status of
the traditional notion of appearance is lost. The appearance was a topological
study—line, plane, mapping—but missing depth as a critical dimension. In this
case, it is neither; phenomenon, although attributable to a thing or an event, is
ultimately a dimension, lending things their “while” and apparition.
The worldly appearance is time-lent. It is temporal and spatial: space-lent. All
everyday  spaces,  such  as  place-space,  thing’s  expansive  space,  everyday
distances, distantiations and kinships, are only in a world-space, which is neither a
big space nor a place of all places, nor can it have a stretch since all stretches,
distantiations,  and  places  are  pervaded  by  world-space.  The  world-space  is  a
spacing  of  the  everyday  world  of  things  in  distances,  places,  and  expansive
spaces,  and  hence  their  casting  of  shadows  across  each  other,  which  gives
coloration, resonance, and touch to all temporal phenomena. Space, in spacing,
lends  things  their  size,  weight,  expanse,  and  location,  but  in  such  a  way  that
spacing vibrates across all things and events without being identical to them.
Thus, both world-dimensional time, as lending phenomena their phenomenality,
and space, as spacing the everyday things and events in their locations, affinities,
and  remoteness,  have  a  “movement”  which  is  not  one  of  the  inner-worldly

134   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
movements,  and  which  cannot  be  understood  in  the  categories  of  traditional
philosophies. It is a cosmological motion. If we are to think of this motion as a
transition from the future to the present and from the present to the past, we would
be using the notion of transition and time in an inner-worldly, everyday way—a
way of succession and a successive movement. How, then, are we to think about
this worldly movement? We must think of the world-dimensional present, past,
and future, back to the timing of the world where the transition occurs—not from
the future to the present and the past, but the way of world-timing where such
differentiations  falter  without  being  lost.  We  must  think  of  transition
intransitively.
The non-ontological presence of past and future is not simply an absence of things
or even nothing but rather has a temporal sense, a sense that is quite difficult to
capture.  It  cannot  be  thought  of  in  terms  of  absence  since  absence  is  pre-
positional. With Aristotle (1936) and Augustine, (1953), there emerges a further
question:  How  is  it  that,  in  explicating  time,  they  employ  a  spatial  model,
specifically when Augustine established a total disjunction between space and
time? Space is external; time is in the soul. When Augustine points out that “a
while” can either be long or short and since only entities can be long or short, then
he operates with a model of spatial stretches, such as a path. Whatever is extended
in space may not change its extension although it has changed time. The “road
stretch” is still there, although yesterday is no longer. Hence, we must reconsider
whether  time  is  a  stretch.  We  must  ask  whether  there  is  a  present  time  and
whether it can be long or short. We, of course, speak of the time stretch in terms
of the present century, present year, and may call them a long stretch of time. But
how  is  the  past  hundred  years  the  present?  Obviously,  it  is  not  given
contemporaneously as a stretch in space, i.e., as a stretch of the road. We speak of
the present century as “ours”. Only the present year is present, but obviously,
even this year is not “present” since most of it is gone and some of it is yet to be
finished. If we push this kind of notion of the present, we shall end up with the
Zenonian and Aristotelian division of time into an infinite point (see Diogenes
Laertius, 2021). But such an indivisible point is never encountered. All attempts
to consider time as present slip away into past and future. Therefore, we cannot
think of the present as an extension.
When we attempt to think the world-movement, then we have to trace back from
the transition of world expansive dimensions of not-yet, present, and no longer to
the world-space-time movement. To add a different turn, to think the world means
to  show  how  the  world-movement  manifests  itself  in,  and  makes  possible  the
appearance  of,  the  dimensional  future,  present,  and  past,  namely  so  that  the
emergence of the future, present, and past are possible—a possibility constituting
the  appearance  of  phenomena.  It  could  be  said  that  all  everyday  “whiles”  are

The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   135
contained within the world-expansive dimensions, although this metaphor must be
de-spatialized. However, we cannot say that the world-expansive dimensions are
“in” the world, nor can we say that the world-expansive time is an infinite “while”
since the infinite stretch smacks of a line from “now” in both directions. From my
“now”  I  stretch  the  “whiles”  or  even  array  them  endlessly  in  both  directions.
Neither can world-time-space nor movement be infinite since we would revert
back to an inner-worldly every day. In the timing of the world across the world-
expansive dimensions, the world-time is neither a “while” nor a duration since all
“whiles” and durations are in the world; hence, the world-time would not endure.
How does the world “time” cross all world-expansive dimensions? How does the
world-space “space” all inner-worldly events and things? How does the world
institute the movement of spatio-temporal dimensions? How are we to think of the
world-depth? For phenomenology, the experienced elements such as chromatic
qualities or audial durations are no longer the qualities of things or qualifications
of the subject-soul. They belong to experiences, which can be said to be worldly
in the sense that they are more akin to the traditionally neglected world than to
subjects and objects. The same can be said of time and space. Time and space are
certainly not “in” the subject, neither are objects described phenomenologically
“in” time and space.
The fleshly present things of our surrounding world constitute the region of our
perceptual field. In diverse ways, we are tuned to the surroundings in terms of use,
misuse, valuation, interrogation, wonder, and habit. In all this, we are related to
the surroundings perceptually; thus, the perceptual field and we are co-present.
Yet, in the perceptual field, we find that things—our surroundings—are not closed
from moment to moment. We find an aura, a horizon; our perceptual island is
neither objective nor subjective, nor is the aura that spreads “beyond” the island.
Yet, the aura is given differently than the present perceptual field. It is given as
re-presented, as absent in the presence. But we must note that the re-presentation
must be interpreted in the worldly sense. This means that we cannot speak here of
re-presentation as an act of consciousness, but as a temporal event of time-in-
time.  This  means  that  we  are  not  concerned  with  the  protentional  act  or  the
retentional capacity, but with a time arc, a time curve upon itself. Although we
may be re-presenting things of the past, what makes the re-presentation possible is
the past’s presence and the future’s presence exactly in the perceptual field, which
has an aura, not spreading toward the past and future only, but coming from the
past and the future toward the perceptual present. In the phenomenal field, the
field of perception and its aural significations, we are related in presentational and
re-presentational  modalities.  We  relate  presentationally  to  the  things  in  our
surroundings  and  re-presentationally  to  the  aural  significations  in  terms  of
remembered and expected surroundings. Thus, we have an immediate stance on
our  surroundings  as  presented  and  re-presented.  Both  belong  to  our  world.  In

136   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence

terms of the notion of presentation and re-presentation, we must ask: What is the
relationship between presentation and re-presentation to world-time? (Pilotta &
Mickunas, 1990).
Before  we  can  answer  such  a  question  in  any  manner,  we  must  gain  a  closer
understanding  of  the  notions  of  presentation  and  re-presentation  within  the
transcendental region. The essential aspect of “presenting acts” consists in their
being  oriented  to  the  “intentional  objectivity”.  The  thing  shows  itself  in  its
corporeity. Their presence is related to the living present and is to be understood
as “presenting”. In contrast, the “re-presenting acts” do not show the object as
bodily present but as re-presented. The relationship of the re-presentational act to
the  presentational  act  is  understood  by  transcendental  phenomenology  as  a
“modification”  of  the  act  and  the  object  of  the  act.  When  we  re-present  a
perceived something, the perceiving is co-re-presented without thematization. A
re-presentational act, relating to a presenting perceptual act, has the character of
“simultaneous occurrence” (Gleichsam Vollzug). In the re-presentational act, there
is  constituted  the  re-presented  perceptual  object  and  the  co-re-presented
perceptual act. Yet, as an act it too has its own temporality. The essential moment
of a re-presentational act—regardless of what sort of re-presentation—must be
seen in the “inner-penetration”. The inter-penetration of a dual lived presence: the
presence of re-presenting and the imagined presence of the imagined perceiving;
the presently re-presented something and the imagined presence of the imagined
perceived something (See Pilotta, 1979).
The basic kinds of re-presenting acts are determined in terms of temporal horizon:
• Re-presentation in the time horizon of the past is recollection.
• Re-presentation in the time horizon of the future is pre-recollection or expecta-
tion.
• Re-presentation in the time-horizon of the present is present-recollection.
The manner in which the co-re-presentation, i.e., a-presentation, corresponds to a
time-horizon  is  to  be  explicated  shortly.  While  the  presenting  perception  is
oriented  to  the  bodily-perceptually  present,  the  recollection  relates  to  the  no-
longer  present  and  expectation  to  the  not-yet  present;  the  present  recollection
relates to the present not given in perceptual corporeity. Recollection points to the
“having been at the present” as in presentational perception, which “has been” for
the  person.  It  intrudes  into  one’s  conscious  past;  it  actualizes  the  in-actual
memory constituted from retentional consciousness phases. In recollection, we
must differentiate  between an actualizing re-presentation  from  not-yet-actualized

The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   137
memory awareness and the recalling of something forgotten. The forgotten is such
that it itself was once in actual memory knowledge.
Before we turn to a phenomenological analysis of the temporal constitution of the
perceptual  objects  and  their  temporality,  in  order  to  lead  them  toward
cosmological reinterpretation, let us briefly depict perception and the perception
field  by  employing  some  of  the  important  insights  of  Husserl  (1964).  In
perception, we are related to something that is corporeally present and is already
displaying itself. The perceptual field is correlated to perceptual sense. The sense
which lends an obvious perceptual fullness is the facing-sense with vision as one
of  its  aspects.  There  is  a  distinction  between  distant-sense  and  near-sense.
Distant-sense consists of facing-sense with vision and hearing as its aspects; the
near-sense consists of tactility, taste, and smell. The notion of distant-sense means
that the experienced must be spatially separated from the perceiver. Near-sense
means that the experienced must be without spatial mediation. Each perceptual
sense has a specific sense-field, and an analysis of perception must describe the
various sense-fields. We shall not, at present, describe the various sense-fields.
Hence, by the perception, we shall mean “a limited notion of perception in terms
of face-perception and its temporality”. We shall nevertheless note that Husserl’s
analyses of time are grounded in the hearing-field, since, for him, audiality, such
as  tone  or  melody,  constitutes  temporal  events  par-excellence.  The  perceptual
field  of  face-sense  not  only  includes  the  immediately  present  things,  the  near
things  and  events,  but  also  the  distant  things  and  events.  The  institution  of
nearness is grounded in the un-thematized null-point of the body; but the body, as
an inner-penetration of full perceptual fields is a constant kinesthetic formation-
deformation of various fields and nearnesses-distances. Hence, body has a most
significant play in the constitution of the perceptual fields. However when we are
speaking  of  perceptual  fields  at  this  stage  of  our  considerations,  we  are  not
speaking about subjective processes, nevertheless, one of the references in the
field is the null-point, which we may call “body”. It must be noted that the null-
point need not assume a privileged position; any point may be called “here” and
the point need not be spatial; it could be dimensional, e.g., when we say “right
here  in  this  town…”  or  “here  on  Earth…”  Any  point  may  be  taken  as  an
orientation point in the perceptual field. In attempting to avoid something, we are
riveted  on  that  something  as  a  point  from  which  our  body  orients  itself,  i.e.,
inscribes various configurations of avoidance, such as going around it, going out
of the way to avoiding it, crawling, tiptoeing, and so forth. The perceptual field
can  be  “attached”  to  anything  as  its  “center”  although  such  an  attachment  is
eventually  unnecessary  and,  in  fact,  impossible  if  the  substantive  attitude  and
spatial  points  are  secondary  phenomena,  i.e.,  if  we  cannot  discover  any  point
which is not itself dimensional and things which themselves are not figurative.

138   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
But  in  order  to  understand  the  perceptual  field,  we  return  to  the  body  as  it
functioned in early phenomenology. We find here two descriptive orientations: on
the one hand, the way we experience our bodily movements in the perceptual
processes, and on the other, the dependence of the perceptual field and the way
that things show themselves on the positionality of the body. The first orientation
is called kinesthetic, and the other has to do with the shadings (Abschattungen) of
the  spatio-temporal  things.  The  objects  toward  which  our  perceptual  ray  is
oriented show themselves in their corporeal presence. The significance of this
Husserlian  notion  suggesting  the  original  givenness—the  original  presence  of
entities—shows that the corporeity of the given is related to the perceiving body.
Within the process of bodily perception, there is the “corporeal present”. We can
have  the  corporeal  presence  of  things  only  insofar  as  we  are  corporeal.  This
situation can be shown in terms of both of the descriptive orientations suggested
above. Husserl (1973) calls material things Aistheta insofar as they are related to
the body and its Aisthesis. He calls the body “the means of all perception” which
“is present necessarily in all perception”. The perceptual processes of experience,
such as the seeing or touching of things, involve the body not only perceptually
but also with respect to the “accompanying series of kinesthetic”. The kinesthetic
“impressions” may be localized in the bodily member, such as hand, eye, and so
forth. The kinesthetic series constitute the manner—the field—in which our body
is “by the things”. The perceptual thing is present in accordance with our bodily
position, the position of the eye, the movement of the head, the movement of
tactility across the hand. At the same time, the body assumes a null point as a
point  of  orientation  within  the  perceptual  field.  From  this,  there  emerge  the
orientations of the surrounding world toward the body. They are on the right or
left,  behind  or  to  the  side,  low  or  in  front,  high  or  parallel  to  me.  Thus,  the
orientation  of  things  to  the  body  and  its  fields  of  perception  are  ruled  by
perspectives and partial views, i.e., shadings. One sees the thing’s surface, runs
across it with a hand, and thus constitutes various perspectives; one does not, at
present, see the other side, the bottom or the three back legs; yet, one means the
entire  table.  The  unperceived  aspects  are,  to  speak  with  Husserl,  given  a-
presentatively. One can bring them to presence by varying one’s position; yet, one
is  always  present  to  one  or  the  other  side,  while  the  non-present  sides  are  a-
present. In each perceptual accomplishment, there is continually a partial section
of something. All the aspects not given presentatively constitute the horizon of the
a-presentatively given. If one goes around the things, one continuously penetrates
the horizon of the a-presentation, and the just-perceived aspects of the same thing
sink into a-presentation.
The  world-time  does  not  possess  an  attribute  of  being  an  all-encompassing
something to which we relate from a particular “point”. Now, we can bracket the
protentional-retentional and notice that there is distancing and nearing (we have

The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   139
not yet said that it is distancing and nearing) into a particular temporal orientation,
such as past or future. It has been assumed for too long that, if it is distancing,
then it must be sinking into the past, and if it is nearing, it must be coming from
the future. But something could be distancing into the future, such as a goal that
yesterday was near, and which today is much more remote. The same thing is true
with  the  past.  Some  unholy  deed  “in  the  past”  is  finally  catching  up  to
someone—it is nearing. Prior to temporal localization, there is the depth. Thus,
the present does not emerge from a primal impression; rather, all impressions
emerge, approach, and distance without any assumed temporal orientation. Thus,
if  there  is  a  “time-understanding”  it  is  not  derivable  from  the  Anthropos.
Terminologies, such as “experienced time”, “lived time”, “projected time” and
such, add nothing to the way “we are” temporal. The present is a way that all
events are, including “us” by instituting all the gestures we subscribe to the depth
of the present and a field of presence. In this respect, when we speak of the no-
longer and the not-yet, we are not necessarily speaking about the past and future,
but rather about the present depth; were we to say that something is coming to me
from the future, we would be merely saying that it is traveling on a line from Paris
to me, traversing space, and it has not yet traversed sufficient space to reach me.
Yet, that traveling is present and is not coming from the future; as I sit awaiting,
the traveling is already occurring, and the traveler will simply emerge from the
horizon which is neither the future nor the past. The present is not an impressional
moment but a depth that can be best articulated, at least for now, in the Husserlian
terms of determinable indeterminacy, rather than in the Heideggerian notions of
nearness and distance, which smack too much of spatiality.
The above notion of indeterminate-determinable depth contains not only depth
articulations but also horizon articulations with determinable indeterminacy. Of
note here is the loss of a temporal event from the future to the present to the past.
Take sound, which always played a role in the Husserlian analysis of a temporal
event, and we shall hear that the temporal continuation of sound is not given, nor
is it given as a rhythm, although sound can be articulated as a rhythm. It is more
akin to a dimension with depth and indeterminate indeterminable limits within
which both continuation and rhythm constitute specific articulations. The same
can be said of visual area. Although we still use the term horizon, it also carries a
notion of a spatial expanse, so to speak—where the sky meets the earth. This
implies  a  sphere  with  more  spatial  fullness  and  Parmenidean  being  than  the
temporal  horizon.  But  if  this  is  spatial,  then  what  is  the  temporal  horizon?  A
horizon toward which these spatial horizons move? But that would simply suggest
a sphere within a sphere. This would lead us nowhere. The time depth mentioned
above still contains the notion of depth, which may hint at spatiality; yet, let us
live with it for a while and connect with our earlier descriptions.

140   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
Coming from the depth is not coming from the future; hence, when something
shows up on the horizon, it has its presence in the depth. If I say that Joe Biden is
coming  from  Washington,  D.C.,  but  he  is  not  yet  here,  he  does  not  sit  there
perched on a future horizon; he is present in the expansive world presence, and
the “future horizon” is merely a modulation of the present. What is suggested is
that the horizons are articulations of the present depth by anything, perception or
consciousness being only one modality among others, such as sway of a sapling in
the wind, which corresponds with the protentional-retentional consciousness. It
must also be noted that, with each sway, the “previous” are not in the “past” but
rather constitute the continuously self-configuring depth. The horizons also move
in depth with the continuous sway by constituting the indeterminate determinable
limits of the sway, of protention/retention, of memory and expectation. Hence, Joe
Biden’s  coming  from  Washington,  D.C.  is  a  movement  of  the  present  with
horizons, such as farther and nearer, and so forth. Of note is that the horizons may
be  “parallel”  with  the  depth,  yet  they,  too,  have  horizons  of  determinate
indeterminacy,  each  of  those  having  its  own  depth.
How are we then to announce this depth? Let us listen to the irrupting presence
echoed by sound welling into a dimension without any successive localities or
continuations,  since  continuation  is  traceable  within  it  only  as  one  of  its
modalities. The analysis of the linear continuation of sound or time shaded by
sound lacks a dimensional depth given cosmologically.
Let us look at the irrupting time shaded by a flicker of light: it inscribes constantly
waning  protrusions  which  are  immediately  pervaded  by  others,  dominated  by
intersections, thus building a constantly spreading depth which is not complete
but is intersected, pervaded, and re-dimensioned by other irruptions; it is not light
that pervades light, but time dimensions which pervade time dimensions, which
are  temporalizations  of  time.  We  are  apt  to  think  that  the  light  pervades  and
dominates  or  manages  space  and  time  in  some  dimensional  way,  but  this  is
somewhat short since it assumes that darkness is space to be shaped by light; but
the contrast is just as valid; darkness protrudes and pervades the light, and this
simply means a play of temporal dimensions which cannot be oriented. Rather, it
is a play of building of depths, not from me toward the depth, but from a depth
that wells with light and darkness, sound and silence, as colorations and echoes of
time. The “edge” of this upwelling of a particular time dimension constitutes a
horizon which may be called a-consciousness-horizon; it is to be noted that this
horizon is no longer future or past, but a dimension of depth which is pervading
another dimension that includes me; I am in darkness, and the dawning light,
inscribing a depth of sky, begins to well and intrude into the darkness wherein I
had my residence. These metaphors are mere colorations of a more fundamental
sway.

The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   141
The present is a dimension with depths, horizons, pervading configurations, and
defigurations,  but  it  is  also  world-wide;  all  spatio-temporal  intrusions,
upsurgences, and diffusions are present. It must be noted that what once were
called “things” are now, perhaps, slower spatio-temporal configurations than are
flashes of light or audial explosions. Nevertheless, every “expression” of the thing
is a spatio-temporal configuration in motion, spreading a depth and a horizon.
Hence, we can no longer speak of the place of a thing as its outer limit or of its
space  in  terms  of  other  spatial  things—since  every  aspect  of  the  thing  is
intentional  with  incessant  configurations  and  defigurations.  The  question  that
emerges is whether the sum of the self-configuring depth with its intertwining
auras and intrusions is identical with the all-pervasive present.
If we were to understand the sound as “flowing”, we would be thinking in terms
of  horizons  of  time  within  which  the  flow  takes  place.  Moreover,  we  would
understand  this  temporal  event  as  an  inner-timely—and  not  a  timely  or
worldly—event. Even if we were to assume that the sound is continuous, as if on
a  line,  we  would  also  be  present  to  a  silence  which  is  not  identical  with  the
continuation of the sound but present “before and after and during” the sound, and
in such a way that it is not only the sound that breaks the silence but also that the
silence resounds in various ways in the sound. The sound thus ceases to be a
continuous  flow  of  the  future  into  the  present  and  into  the  past,  but  already
implicates a silent dimension of the present, which is not continuous but irrupting
in the very sound.
Whatever we now would call the conscious-flow of audiality would be a complex
trace of the world-depth: the protentional-retentional is now identical with the
continuous layering into depth of the sway of the tree in the wind. Consciousness
thus begins to vanish in favor of identity with the world traces. The vanishing of
the  subject  is  a  gain  of  the  world,  but  no  longer  in  the  sense  that  the  subject
somehow mirrors or reflects the world and thus becomes anonymous, whereby the
anonymity could be discovered by reflection; reflection would not find a subject,
but  rather  the  world  traces  with  the  added  attraction  of  reflection  which  may
simply  be  a  delayed  continuation  of  the  traces.  Let  us  take  the  protentional-
retentional (past-future) consciousness in its ultimate a-temporal sense and note
that it names a constant, changeless shift, and in such a way that the shift does not
pass, but builds an expansion with continuous deepening, and this expansion and
deepening are not articulations of a pre-given temporality or a field, but are rather
identical with an emergence of the field. That is why the a-temporal protention-
retention are nowhere to be found, and the instituted protending acts and retending
acts are at best secondary; it is nowhere and at no time because it is the very
presence  of  emergent  and  self-articulating  temporality  manifested,  or  given  a
presentational value, by what we call consciousness. In terms of the present, it

142   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
could be said that “by the time” the sound emerges for consciousness—comes
within  the  consciousness  horizon—it  has  been  welling  up  in  its  silence,  and
consciousness  constitutes  its  continuous  articulation.  It  could  be  said  that
consciousness is one modality in which sound becomes audible. Here again, we
encounter a clue comprised of consciousness, which points to the horizons, but in
such a way that these consciousness horizons are a way that the upwelling sound
sifts through, pervades, and encompasses the consciousness and indeed constitutes
it;  with  its  depth,  it  institutes  a  limit  called  consciousness-horizons,  and  by
emerging with depth-articulations, it constantly transfigures the horizons and thus
constitutes
 consciousness
 articulation,
 called
 “temporalization”
 which
fundamentally  is  the  sound’s  articulation  of  time.  Consciousness,  as  constant
retending-protending, sinking and drawing, is identical to the emergence of time
echoed  by  sound,  or  shaded  by  color.  This  is  what  allows  transcendental
phenomenology to talk of the empty form of time; it is the silent upsurge that
wells into horizons of sound; strip away the sound, and what remains is “pure
time”, except that its conscious horizons are an articulated limit; a trace across the
depth, and a constant waver from horizon to horizon is identical with the tracing
of that depth. The present then has a world-wide depth, which does not come
toward  consciousness,  but  which  is  always  through  consciousness,  and  when
consciousness  covers  its  self-temporalization,  it  also  discovers  itself  in  an
“incessant streaming”. This streaming is one articulation of the presence shaded
either in the chromatic endurance or echoed in some tonicity; but it is to be noted
that  such  a  chromatic  endurance  and  echoed  tonicity  may  “temporalize”
everything. The temporalizing of cosmological difference gives the “world depth”
and allows us to abandon the unconscious as the repository of desires, myths, and
magic in/of world dimensions. And it is within some degree of possibility that we
are de-essentialized through temporalization. Thus, we may be able to state with
methodological and conceptual clarity that every “body”, to the extent that it is
conceived spatially, is nothing but a solidified, crystallized, and materialized time,
which requires the formation and solidification of space to unfold. Space here
may be construed as a field of tension of principles: the latency of space and the
acuteness of the intensification of time.
SPECULATION
• Instead of three horizons of time, we suggest there are four:
1. Present;
2. Past;
3. Future—as the time of actuality; and

The Internet of Things and Temporal Reflex
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   143
4. Possibility.
• Time is a fourfold unity of the severing of past, future, possibility, and field
intentionality (present).
• Possibility, as the fourth horizon, means world constitution, as the unity of the
saving of time and the filling of time.
The four temporalities allow for the following:
a. Networks select different nodes (persons, organizations) relating to structural
couplings with systems and environments. With respect to information, it seems
to  be  the  image  of  a  “new”  world  which  is  most  intense  to  meet  on  the  net,
anytime, anywhere, anyone and with anonymity and without ever meeting others.
b. Consumers have engaged for a while now in “time shifting” —in delaying,
postponing, and recording media in a non-sequential order, anytime, anywhere.
The world of the net embodies a fascinating characteristic which is almost a free-
floating communication that is only loosely coupled to “actors” who are trying on
multiple identities. The time horizon of sound tech/media is quite malleable. This
is starting to be demonstrated in the analysis of networks.
c. Network analysis started gaining force as the “Net” became available in about
1990. Currently, globalization and mobile telephony have perforated the interest
and research into “Net”/network.
Time  stretching  and  time-space  compression  have  been  descriptions  of  the
globalization  process  and  communications/information/entertainment  and  so
forth.  A  new  ecosystem  has  arrived  with  the  smart  phone,  decentering  the
centrality of the siloed industries mentioned above. Visualize the industries above
as pieces of fruit in a still-life painting. The fruit is not lined up horizontally, side
by side, but they are overlapping each other horizontally, or they can be vertically
overlapping each other, in a mobile phasing in and out in every direction. Each
piece of fruit is a node and edges are the relating to the other pieces of fruit which
align as neighbors, with differing neighbors and clusterings of neighbors.
Until recently, network analysis was based on a static network perspective, in
which links and nodes are assumed to exist at any “point” in time. Recently it has
been found that high-complexity networks are not active continuously but occur
in specific temporal patterns. In recent investigations, the fact is in many real-
world systems the next interaction of a node is not independent of the node it has
interacted with shortly before.

144   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
Also,  it  has  not  been  recognized  that  complex  systems,  particularly  social
technical systems, are a layering of networks in which the interactions within each
network and across each of the layers pass through each other. The dynamism of
layered  systems  demonstrates  the  non-linearity  of  temporal  relationships  and
needs to be measured in between the relational preference of nodes. Intra-network
and extra-network are compressed neighbors.
CONCLUSION
The IoT (Internet of Things) works to demonstrate the temporal reflex, which is
one of the keys of AI beyond the simple combination of past—present—future.
Understanding the temporal reflex is more than an interconnecting of a series of
nodes, rather, it is a self-process/autopoietic system creating various possibilities
which  can  have  unintended  consequences.  However,  the  unintended  may  be
anticipated. Such foreknowledge allows for the mitigation of risk and deleterious
consequences at all levels of the social, the organizational, and the cultural.

CHAPTER 8
Can I—Can You—Can We?
Abstract: Chapter 8 aims to fully address the question: What is the mode of awareness
which  frames  the  building  of  the  pragmatic  world,  and  what  are  its  “passive”
transcendental conditions? As such, the discussion turns to the issues of the signitive
cosmos  of  space-time-movement,  the  practical  domain,  and  the  abstract  versus  the
concrete. The concepts of significance and understanding are brought to bear on a
discussion that relates perception and praxis to kinesthesis and embodiment, requiring
an exposition of the logic of analogy. This leads to an explanation of the importance of
the  vital-kinesthetic,  which  has,  up  until  now,  been  obscured  by  the  primacy  of
Cartesian dualism in Western thinking. The dualism appears between the postulation of
a “mind” as a thinking subject, and a body as a material mechanism, which functions as
a  reaction  to  specific  stimuli.  There  is  no  self-initiating  movement,  which  would
explore the environment, have orientations or even any sense of what is forward or
backward, up or down, left or right. Yet, our kinesthetic body understands all these
orientations, and in fact, they become the coordinates of our practical world.

INTRODUCTION
In the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, there is a scene of a gathering of scientists at a
station on the moon, where a renowned scientist cautions others not to reveal the
discovery of an obelisk because such a revelation will cause global disorientation.
In an earlier scene, a group of anthropoids also discover this obelisk, and, having
touched it, become “wiser”, giving birth to “tool users” and extending their power
over all other species. Modern philosophers and even evolution proponents are in
agreement: The human species emerged as tool users and makers—resulting in 
homo  laborans  and  pragmatism.  The  scene  in  the  film  shows  an  anthropoid
learning  how  to  use  a  bone  to  smash  things  and  beat  another  “tribe”  of
anthropoids, and finally, the bone is flung upward and turns into a sophisticated
“tool”—a  spaceship  on  the  way  to  the  moon  with  the  help  of  AI  and  robots.
Indeed, the spaceship is an AI discourse. Phenomenological research does accept
the technological world, but rather, as discussed in previous sections, it wants to
decipher the modes of awareness in correlation to the ontological status of the
world. The question: what is the mode of bodily awareness which frames the buil-

ding of the pragmatic world; Without such a body, no mathematical calculations
of material events could ever be arranged and oriented toward production of a
hammer – not to speak of AI.
As  discussed  so  far,  the  practical  domain  is  designated  as  multi-discursive,
including the scientific discourses in their technical efficiency. We also disclosed
transcendental  time  awareness  as  a  field  of  intersubjective  time  horizons  and
depths, with their scientific discourses forming projects and their “realization”.
This seems to suggest that such discourses are the most immediate and concrete
features of the lived world. Upon closer analysis, the explanations are completely
abstract from daily discourse and awareness although a specific and most basic
mode of awareness is required to use and understand them. This is one of the
unique claims of scientific thought: It purports to deal with the concrete, and yet it
offers radically abstract and formalized systems. The answer, of course, is in the
demonstration that such systems are applicable to concrete activities and practical
purposes.  This  claim  lends  credence  to  the  views  that  an  understanding  of
situations  and  contexts  is  a  socio-historically  learned  adaptation  of  rules,  of
interpretations of normative and theoretical structures, resulting in a conjunction
of  theory  and  concrete  actions.  Such  claims  are  possible  on  two  traditional
assumptions:  First,  an  application  spells  dualism  between  form  and  content,
thought and reality, structure and manifestation; and second, the conjunction is
possible in an instrumental sense, i.e., science is not a theoretical explanation, but
an instrumental system for the mastery of nature in favor of human purposes. In
both  cases,  the  outcome  of  this  conjunction  is  metaphysical  virulence,  i.e.,
metaphysics,  as  a  normative  construct,  embodied  in  a  mathematical  mode  of
awareness, is used to change the world to fit the metaphysical constructs. In this
sense,  the  abstract,  formal  mathematical  systems  assume  an  inordinate
preeminence against the concrete experience since they become technical reality.
As  most  serious  researchers  have  seen,  science  no  longer  explains  but  rather
makes  events  happen.
UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULAR
There is, in fact, a current tendency, resting, perhaps, on the modern conception of
the instrumentality of science, toward a practical basis and explanation of human
activities.  Most  diverse  theories,  from  neo-Marxism,  through  communicative
competence, to postmodern conceptions of the production of truth, assure us that
their theories are praxis-laden. These theories equally claim that human activities
are  imbedded  in  a  human  world  with  its  historical  horizons.  One  specific
characteristic shared by such trends is the claim that their conceptions of praxis
are based on concrete historical contexts, allowing for an interpretive discourse of
scientific  thinking  and  formal  rules,  and  that  such  discourses  offer  a  concrete

domain that can avoid the pitfalls of some of the transcendental phenomenological
trends. The latter is deemed to be idealistic and solipsistic. If communication is
possible,  then  its  basis  stems  from  historical  situations,  particular  forms  of
language, interpretation, and understanding, extended to scientific explanations by
the latest mathematical models—once more, a mathematical mode of awareness.
It is argued that phenomenology’s focus on the “objective” given disconnects the
given from its context, its social and historical interpretations, and assumes that
such a focus offers universally acceptable claims. Moreover, the presumption of
objectivity leads to the view that the individual is in a position to observe the
given  without  any  relationship  to  others  and  without  any  introduction  of
interpretations  by  historically  acquired  languages.  The  charge  against
phenomenology states that one cannot be a pure observer of the given without any
admixtures  of  others  and  various  intermediaries,  such  as  language.  Only  the
historically  and  socially  acquired  common  usages  and  practices  frame  the
understanding of given phenomena. The actions and practices of the individual
are  examples  of  the  common  practices,  customs,  and  usages,  i.e.,  he  is  a
representative  of  something  intersubjective  and  common.  In  terms  of  our
discussion  of  the  AI  mode  of  awareness,  dealing  with  social  research,  the
individual  would  be  a  concrete  case  in  a  statistical  distribution—and  even
statistically  given  by  his  individual  DNA.
Despite  the  phenomenological  arguments  for  the  primacy  of  signification,  of
meaning as phenomena of awareness, the attacks on phenomenology insist that
meaning is linguistic, and the latter not only transcends the individual, but allows
him  to  make  sense  of  himself.  Moreover,  the  phenomenologically  perceived
object, with its space-time horizons, is deemed an inadequate point of departure,
requiring  a  historically  effective  consciousness,  and  an  objective  spirit,
encompassing institutions and individual activities. The individual lives and acts,
thinks  and  feels  in  the  sphere  of  commonality  of  rules,  plans,  and  customs,
reaching  into  individual  motivations.  Thus,  every  plan,  every  explanation,  is
group-specific. This supposedly comprises a more encompassing and concrete
domain,  specifically  in  light  of  the  “empirical”  presence  of  products  and
implements. The individual activity is a situational application of the modes of
prescribed activity. The sense interconnections of a tradition appear in a common
praxis,  constituting  a  form  of  life  and  a  life-world,  and  they  precede  the
individual. It follows, then, that the genesis of awareness inheres in the common
forms  of  historical  life,  institutions  and  traditions  that  have  far  surpassed  the
individual. Without them, human activity would be blind, and with them, it is
directed by an authority of a tradition. The intentional activities of the individual
are  situational  specifications  and  individuations  of  a  historically  and  socially
pregiven  intersubjectivity  and  life-world.  The  latter  is  the  subject,  while  the

A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   149
individual is their determinate object. In the previous chapter, we mentioned the
circularity of the claims to the universality of a tradition and the specificity of the
individual.  Yet,  we  did  not  articulate  the  presence  of  a  more  basic  issue  of
individuality in the context of general intersubjective awareness. This awareness
is also required to explicate dimensions which AI assumes but cannot account for.
After  all,  intersubjective  awareness  is  not  transmitted  from  subject  to  subject
telepathically—so to speak, a Cartesian mind sending direct signals to another
mind that two plus two is four.
CONCRETE GENERALITY
The  presumption  of  the  primacy  of  the  intersubjective,  the  social,  and  the
historical over the individual fails to account for a number of important issues.
First, the practical engagements and the concrete contexts cannot be understood
by reading the meaning of terms in texts, or by giving calculations of the size of
stones or building blocks; second, the singular, the individual, becomes absorbed
into a domain which he can neither survey nor manage; and third, the awareness
of the other is taken to be self-evident, without providing an account of what
makes  one  different  from  the  other.  Yet,  this  awareness  is  most  complex  and
difficult to decipher. In previous sections, we have argued for a practical domain
wherein the self and others acquire their mutuality and differentiation, comprising
individuation  within  a  unity.  This  domain  was  suggested  to  be  corporeal  and
coextensive with the systems of meaningful activities and abilities. Yet, the latter
are not facts but systems of kinesthesia, possessing a generality that is neither a
universal  abstraction  nor  a  singular  datum.  The  generality,  moreover,  is  an
orientational  schema.  While  the  physiological  body  might  be  located  in  a
homogeneous space and consist of a symmetrical structure, such a body and space
cannot  deal  with  orientations.  In  the  mathematical  mode  of  awareness,  space
consists of indifferent points which cannot be assigned such meanings as “here-
there”,  “up-down”,  and  so  forth,  unless  one  borrows  such  meanings  from  a
functional body. The latter is the condition for the possibility of structuring and
communicating  a  world  of  places  and  locations,  of  ups  and  downs,  lefts  and
rights, forwards and backward. The asymmetry of the functional body disrupts the
homogeneity  by  communicating  directions,  orientations,  and  thus  instituting  a
practical world. The functional directions are not exchangeable. What is upfront,
reachable by a forward movement, is distinct from what is in the back, and the
latter can be reached best by a reversal of directions. The same can be said of left-
right, up-down compositions. Yet, anything we encounter and anything we make
includes such orientational conditions. We rotate the Hubble telescope to “face” a
specific  galaxy  which  is  “there”  and  which,  measured  from  the  “here”  of  the
telescope, is 1.3 billion light years “away”.

150   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
We contend this is the more basic conception of “history in the practical making”
than  the  history  that  is  continuous  only  at  the  theoretical  level.  The  former
contains all sorts of discontinuities, intersections, resumptions, and multiple depth
horizons, while the latter is regarded as a linear purposive teleology. Indeed, the
notion  of  discontinuous  history,  offered  by  Foucault  (1970)  and  by  various
postmodernists, is based on the history of active engagements that need not have
continuity;  certain  actions  are  abandoned,  and  others,  at  times  seen  as
revolutionary  are  initiated.  Neither  Foucault  (1972)  nor  Deleuze  and  Guattari
(1983), and indeed not even Sloterdijk (1987) has offered any grounding of their
claims about body parts and their various surface circulations and interactions.
They merely postulated a body as a thing without accounting for all the ways that
bodies with other bodies work, build, make implements, build pyramids, and find
their way in the world of things, locations, and themselves. At one level, our task
is to outline those prevalent theses and to show that they, too, have assumed, as
their basis, an active intercorporate, and the life-world whose current constitution
in the West is technical. While being writers, they have sedimented their bodily
activities to accommodate the current “practical implements” for their writing.
Thus, the phenomenological conditions for their possibility of offering their theses
are  equally  the  acquired  corporeal  abilities  in  correlation  to  what  the  current
practical implements require of their bodies. In this sense, we shall introduce a
life-world of praxis that not only includes intercorporate, but also the scientific-
technical, practical world that calls for certain corporeal activities.
The  world  “out  there”  is  not  an  objectivity  “in  itself”,  but  an  instrumental
structuration that requires a “pedagogy” of action in correlation to these complex
structurations. While our analyses of the concrete conditions of “awareness” have
been offered in different contexts, our points are designed, not to deny or negate
the current breakthroughs by the theoretical trends we shall articulate, but to open
the  passively  assumed  activities  which  are  inter-corporeal  and  “inter-
instrumental”, comprising awareness that subtend and/or pervade the discursive
analyses of strategies, and the constitution of surface flow of vagabond nomads.
Interesting as such nomadic bricolage may be, the actors, who interact with each
other at this level of surface contact, must first “move” i.e., constitute kinesthetic
awareness. As we shall see, the latter is one of the conditions that is granted, even
in its cultural variations, as a “tacit” dimension of awareness in all life-world
instances. Westerners, Easterners, and Africans tend to cross a street by moving.
Only  metaphysicians  have  posited  either  mind  or  language  as  possessors  of
signification and meaning, while reducing corporeity to a body mechanism in a
space-time  continuum.  Phenomenology,  in  contrast,  has  opened  the  active
corporeity as being “prior” to any speculative metaphysics and historicisms. What
we propose, then, is the primacy of the “I can” over the “I think”. The “I” does not

Can I—Can You—Can We?
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   151
stand  for  a  continuous  identity  but  is  an  indication  of  the  abilities  that  are
correlated to concrete tasks with others. By now, it ought to be obvious that the
analyses at this level will require a concretization of the primacy of dialogue. The
bodily interaction with the environment and others in the face of tasks is also a
mutual understanding of the corporeal gestures concerned with what we are doing
and how it is to be done.
No doubt, there are cultural phenomena that are unquestioned and structure all
other  levels,  yet  our  contention  is  that  even  these  cultural  phenomena  are
grounded in the directly engaged awareness of corporeity and inter-corporeity.
These  engaged  modes  of  awareness  are  the  transcendental  conditions  for  the
awareness of the functioning of powers and discursive practices. In order to make
sense of discourses, specifically under the assumption that they are implicit power
imperatives, there is a more basic awareness that consists of a system(s) of life-
world orientations, vectors, composed by particular corporeity. The latter, as a
structure of concrete awareness, makes sense of the abstract, discursive power
logics. The basic discursive terminology that involves a prescription for action is a
terminology that is not derived from discourses. Rather, the discourses themselves
must  follow  the  corporeal  practical  conditions  as  ways  of  making  sense  of
discursive strategies. What we suggest is that one cannot understand terms such as
“history has no continuity or direction” as Foucault (1970) would have it, unless
one has a corporeal understanding of directions, orientations, and constitutions of
practical spaces and times in order to understand the discourses. Discourses, as
power strategies, would not be able to articulate what someone must do, where
someone must go, or when someone must be somewhere, unless one is already an
oriented body. More concretely speaking, even the language of economy cannot
be understood as a discursive practice of a capitalist or communist power unless
the worker and the ruling elites understand the body orientations in the workplace
in correlation to the specific implements requiring concrete corporeal actions in
the face of tasks.
The problematic could be restated in other terms. The basis for which Husserl (see
Bruzina, 2004) seeks is to be absolute, and yet the question of the individual is not
answered purely on the transcendental arguments for an ego. Individuality is to be
sought elsewhere. It is precisely such a search that leads to the absoluteness of the
corporeally  engaged  factual  individual  and  inter-corporeal  relationships:
contingent  absoluteness.  How  is  this  contingency  to  be  understood?  Earlier
discussion would have suggested that it is a fact correlated to an essence, but such
a correlation turns out to be impossible since every fact is already a constituted
system in a field. In addition, reflective thinking cannot determine the limits of the
facticity  of  passive  activities  and  hence  correlate  them  to  essential  insights.
Neither facticity nor essentiality will do, specifically if an experienced facticity of

152   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
self  in  an  activity  does  not  yield  any  substantial  identity  and  predicative
characterizations. The factual process is not experienced as a brute and dumb fact
with characteristics to be subsumed as an exemplar of an eidos, but as a system of
dynamic abilities, deployed from a here and a now, not in the sense of being
inserted  in  a  geometrical  space-time,  but  from  which  the  world  is  opened  in
action. The null-point is the corporeity from which all actions unfold, but in such
a  way  that  the  null-point  itself  is  apperceptive  and  located  in  the  process  of
shifting  and  intersecting  activities  comprising  a  field  and  not  a  position.
Our contention is that this field and its field nature is open in its factual life as a
constant  activity  and  a  structuration  of  the  perceptual  world.  The  ego  is  an
achievement of factual abilities that are not factual data. In this sense, the ego is
absolute fact. Its necessity is neither essential nor contingent. Both are subtended
by the acting corporeity and its systematic engagements with practical affairs.
What  follows  from  such  an  absolute  fact  is  that  any  essential  and  contingent
determinations of it are inadequate. In this sense, it is without ground. One could
claim that the activities are both constitutive of and constituted by the phenomenal
field. Given this, it is now possible to take the last step toward tracing the question
of individuality and inter-subjectivity.
Bodily  activities  constitute  an  ineradicable  facticity  that  is  not  dumb  but  an
articulated process that does not emerge into the foreground—specifically since it
is not entitative but constitutive of spatial and temporal patterns. The latter are
neither interior nor exterior; hence, reflective awareness is inadequate to grasp it.
Rather, it is a taken-for-granted point of departure for any investigation of the
lived world and a field of history. Each gesture and movement are accomplished
spontaneously and recognized in correlation to and distinction from others. From
childhood  on,  there  is  a  vital-kinesthetic  exploration  of  the  world  and  the
constitution of corporeal abilities. The latter is neither inner nor outer, but they are
primarily effective. One can reach something, move something, pull, push, lift,
and throw. This effectivity comprises its own domain of cognition.
Before  “conscious”  reflection,  corporeal  movements  constitute  their  own  self-
reflexivity and self-reference. In a missed attempt to reach something, the attempt
is immediately repeated. The missing comprises an instance of movement which
reflects back upon itself and calls for a variation of itself in a second attempt.
There is a direct kinesthetic question: “Can I do this?”—revealing at the outset an
already articulated field of abilities and tasks with possible variations that never
offer a final, factual limitation. Here, one builds recognition of oneself in terms of
what one can do. This self-recognition is coextensive with the recognition of the
abilities  as  mine,  not  because  the  abilities  are  mirrored  in  a  psychological
interiority or in a mirror, but because they are kinesthetically reflexive and at the

Can I—Can You—Can We?
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   153
same time coextensive with and differentiated from those of others. “I cannot do
this” means that not only have I tried and failed, but I have seen others perform it.
The correlation of abilities and inabilities is an inter-corporeal experience present
in  the  handling  of  tasks  and  undertakings.  Corporeal  abilities  comprise  an
understanding  of  commonalities  and  individuating  differences.
The commonality has two components: First, the common task in which we are
engaged, and second, the continuity of activities that differentiate themselves into
variations. We lift something, but you do it from that side, and I do it from this.
While the end you are lifting is heavier, you can, and I cannot, lift that end, yet I
can  lift  this  end,  and  thus  discover  a  common  activity  and  its  corporeal
differentiation. This constitutes a polycentric field of activities and includes others
who are not present at the task. “If only Joe were here to lend us a hand” includes
the abilities of Joe as coextensive with, and differentiated from, our capacities. Or,
“Lucky that Mike is not here; he certainly likes to lend a hand, but he tends to be
more of a hindrance than help”. At the active level, the term empathy can be
modified by “filling in”. It is quite a common notion; we do fill in for someone at
the job, by taking over a function, or by putting our shoulder to the task from
another side. All these functions suggest a commonality and a variation. This is
corporeal individuation and inter-corporeal field that is neither a simple fact, nor
an essence; it subtends both. Concurrently, there is a level of reflexivity, of direct
apperception of the self and the other on the basis of activities that both undertake.
Her ability to reach something, and my lack of such an ability despite my efforts,
reflects  directly  our  corporeal  commonality  of  reaching,  and  our  differences.
Thus,  the  “I  can”  is  prior  to  the  pure  I,  since  the  former  is  individuated  and
differentiated from others, and yet is directly aware of them as well as of itself.
It should be, by now, somewhat more obvious that the ground of history is neither
historical nor constituted by a logic of continuity of time, but is the very process
of inter-corporeal making, comprising an interconnected field of bodily activities
such  that  the  activities,  constituting  a  systematic  engagement  in  tasks,  are
individuating and coextensive with others. Yet, this leads to the reinvestigation of
the “factual” tasks and objects to which such tasks are related. The factual states
of affairs, correlated to our activities, are equally prior to essentiality and brute
factuality.  Rather,  they  have  an  open  explorability  and  generality,  specifically
with respect to their practical functions. It is to be noted that history is not thought
but built, and made, in practical engagements. Such engagements reveal another
aspect  of  activities  that  could  be  called  dimensional,  leading  to  corporeal
analogization  of  the  field  of  praxis.  The  active  handling  of  objects  does  not
exhibit a one-to-one correlation between activities and the objects. Each activity
can range over various and typologically distinct objects and tasks. The hand can
pick up a stone, a hammer, or a stick and use any of them to pound a stick into the

154   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
ground. And this constitutes a primal analogization in two senses. First, one can
perform  similar  activities  and  recognize  them  directly  anywhere  and  anyplace
prior to sequential temporalization, and second, the activities perform a passive
analogization of objects by using them interchangeably in the face of a task. The
hammer, the stone and the stick are analogates by virtue of the generality of our
abilities. In this sense, the “I can” is a factual generality that cannot be reduced
either to a closed essence or a brute fact. One can then claim that the historical
field is recognized by the interchanging functions as analogous to one another,
capable  of  filling  in  one  another,  and  equally  by  the  facts  as  systems,  not
revealing  essentialities,  as  was  shown  at  the  outset,  but  analogical
interconnections among categorically diverse objects, recognizable corporeally. It
is  this  that  allows  an  archeologist,  a  historian,  a  scientist,  an  archeologist,  a
builder of technical means, and an anthropologist to reconstruct the so-called past
on the basis of some handy find. This is to say, these scholars and researchers do
not have to date the find in a preconceived temporal sequence—this comes as an
occupational tandem subsequently—but to encounter it as an analogate of what
they could do with this object and imply that we too already recognize that we
could equally do similar things.
This means that there is no necessary interconnection among all activities; some
are continued, others discontinued, and still others postponed, thus constituting
varied  time  structures  and  task  compositions  that  prohibit  any  teleological
direction to history. With such a prohibition, any quest for history as something
that is unidirectional and above the activities and tasks that build it, ceases to
make  sense.  The  activities  are,  of  course,  interconnected  in  various  ways,
inclusive  of  the  above-delimited  commonalities  and  differentiations,  yet  they
comprise  a  field  without  a  telos,  without  a  direction  and  hence  a  continuous
building, but not in any sense a temporal building. It is rather an intersection of a
field of activities wherein the convenient theoretical constructs called past and
future, come too late. In brief, the lived world of praxis does not admit either
essentiality or facticity; rather, both are coextensive with what Stroeker (1987)
describes as “primordial techne”. Any given society, in its practical tasks, also
composes  specific  sedimented  bodily  activities  that  comprise  a  background
concrete consciousness. This sedimented inter-corporeity allows for foreground
activities  to  be  focused  on  specific  tasks.  When  Deleuze  and  Guattari  (1983)
speak of the modern production, such as capitalist production, where the owner of
a production line only buys the worker's hands as an attachment to a mechanical
productive  process,  they  fail  to  note  that  even  kinesthetic  composition  of  the
hands not only correlates to the tasks to be performed, but also assumes a field of
kinesthetic  sedimented  corporeity  as  a  background.  This  is  to  say,  body  must
stand or sit in a particular posture in order to make the hands a foreground to be
able to perform, such that the worker would say, “I can do this job”. Assuming

Can I—Can You—Can We?
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   155
that Foucault and Deleuze and Guattari (1983) have argued that transcendental
subjectivity as some sort of universal consciousness is not attainable, they have
forgotten  or  neglected  the  more  fundamental  transcendental  condition  of
kinesthetic inter-corporeity as practical awareness prior to being elevated to some
sort of consciousness of reality or of objectivities. Society, then, is a field of tasks
requiring inter-corporeal awareness of how we do things in this place, and that
means  already  a  tacit  or  passive  awareness  of  whose  background  various
functions  are  comprehensible.
Excellent  phenomenological  and  critical  analyses  of  the  functional  body  are
available in the just-mentioned work by Stroeker and need not be repeated. It is a
fact that such a body is a setting for practical understanding, and its functions are
involved in numerous linguistic conceptions. A brief indication of such functions
ought to suffice. We note, for example, that many linguistic expressions in politics
and  mythologies,  in  sciences  and  daily  activities,  are  structured  by  left-right
orientations. Leanings to the left or right, to the radical right, to the extreme left,
are common in daily discourse, and yet, without a functional body, such terms
would have no sense. One can easily trace an entire history of this bodily function
in numerous expressions and, indeed, in the most important locations of human
figures. The same could be said of the vertical orientation, up-down, or high-low.
When we speak of social status, degrees of significance of theoretical functions,
designate offices and their hierarchical ranks, and deploy cultural figures on the
vertical axis, we are constantly using the language of an uprightly functioning
body. There are persons of “high rank” and “lower status”; there are theologically
designed  places  with  “heaven  above”  and  “hell  below”;  the  “ideal  world”  is
above, while “the material world” is below. In short, without the “upright” posture
and its movement of standing up or sinking down, the just-mentioned linguistic
designations would make no sense.
Perhaps the most preeminent corporeal function, appearing in linguistic form, is
one of the differentiation between the forward and backward movements. The
forward movement is most favored in practical activities. Indeed, the practical
activity  is  most  preeminently  a  forward  activity,  even  if  minimal  backward
movements  are  called  upon  as  compensatory  requirements,  and  it  does  not
contend  with  objects  behind  as  with  those  found  in  the  lateral  and  forward
regions.  The  language  of  means,  aims,  and  goals  is  dominated  by  concrete
forward  activity.  It  must  be  understood  that  it  enters  not  only  into  space
terminology but also into temporal conceptions. We are leaving the past behind us
and  are  moving  forward  toward  the  future;  we  look  ahead  to  better  days,
participate in the forward march of history and progress, and face the tests and
goals of tomorrow. Our hypotheses are ahead of their time—and are higher than
the current ones. The language of overcoming, transcending, and surpassing is a

156   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
forward-oriented language. This suggests that the very conceptions of history, the
rules of language, the interpretations of significances, hierarchies and ranks, and
even the contexts, assume the concrete meaning of an asymmetrically functioning
and active corporeity. Such a corporeity is the concrete context and thus escapes
being a singular fact subsumable under a universal rule, and it possesses its own
generality. In language, this generality appears in all space-time contextualization,
and  hence  it  is  even  the  ground  of  concrete  understanding  from  history  to
astronomy. The application of discursive rules, images, and customs makes sense
in a situation because the situation itself is a meaningful corporeal context with a
functional  body  and  general,  oriented  differentiations.  Even  “perspectivity”  is
premised on “seeing” from the “here” toward the “there”, from our planet toward
the distant galaxy of Andromeda.
These  concrete  discursive  modes  of  perception  require  a  practical  domain  of
oriented places. Useful objects and functions, inclusive of bodily activities, have
oriented  places.  The  places  depend  on  customary  conveniences  for  activity.
Something useful is found “where it belongs” and is easily accessible. Useful
objects are not found in a point of a homogeneous space, but in a place with a
slack that allows changes without the object leaving its place. It is on the desk, in
front, and a little to the right, and is accessible to correlations with other objects in
the  vicinity.  They  are  interconnected  significatively  and  function  under  the
practical taking over of one function by another. Places with their slack include
dimensional corporeal activities that lend and open the accessibility of objects.
The latter cannot be too far, out of reach, or too close, crowded, and obtrusive,
and thus a hindrance to activities.
The  practical  world  of  oriented  places  is  much  broader  than  the  situation
structured by the direct activities of the body. Every place of practical objects can
be  available  as  an  oriented  and  flexible  structure  in  correlation  to  other  such
places,
 comprising
 an
 oriented
 system
 of
 flexible
 and
 functional
interrelationships. Things have a place on the desk, the desk is in the house, the
house is in Chicago, and so on. The movement in this flexible system of places is
communicated  on  the  generality  of  bodily  functions.  One  leaves  someplace
“behind” and goes “ahead” to another place, and if one is in a hurry, one avoids
excursions to the “sides”. Regardless of how vast the places become, they never
lose the corporeal system of functional orientation: We are leaving the coast of the
United States behind, and we are heading toward Europe. Obviously, we should
not  confuse  functional  orientations  with  some  inner  bodily-subjective
psychological characteristics. Orientations are completely intertwined with the
practical  world  and  correlate  to  the  places  and  systems  of  interconnected  and
oriented objects. The corporeal orientations constitute an “in-between” domain
wherein even the physiological body is located and articulated.

Can I—Can You—Can We?
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   157
No  doubt,  awareness  means,  signifies  and  provides  an  interconnected,  sense-
making process. Thus, the awareness of a physical object, appearing from various
sides, requires a practically orienting body. Objects “in themselves” do not have
sides,  tops,  bottoms,  and  ends;  they  appear  as  such  on  the  basis  of  bodily
orientations. The desk has a top because we are upright and sides because we
assume a corporeal position and action from a particular vantage point. While the
theoretical  modes  of  awareness  are  available  and  can  be  transmitted  by  an
intersubjective, historical tradition in texts, they assume a concrete, yet general
system of practical activities that already makes sense and allows the “reading” of
the  transmitted  conceptions.  Thus,  one  may  learn  the  formal  rules  of  playing
chess,  but  such  rules  are  understandable  only  in  the  context  of  functional
orientations: Forward movements, diagonal movements, retreats, and advances
are bodily orientations. The theory of the lived world as a “language game” with
learned rules and grammatical sequences would be completely incomprehensible
to a being who did not structure its practical world along our functional systems
of action. A sequence of grammatical composition, whether from left to right,
right to left, or top to bottom, can be communicated and applied because of the
tacit awareness of the practical body. In fact, our unquestioned experience and
discourse  concerning  the  social  architectonic,  inclusive  of  routes  of
communication and commerce, are modeled after the functional body. Houses
have fronts, sides, and backs; we sit in the front or back seats of vehicles; the
latter  has  forward  and  backward  movements  and  locations;  our  numbering  of
houses on streets is “up”. Phenomenology contends that our practical awareness
as  bodily  orientations  is  one  of  the  most  fundamental  domains  in  the
comprehension  even  of  the  “higher”  theoretical  constructions.
Given the level of practical activity and its oriented and flexible system of places,
there is equally a flexible and oriented system of time which is also fundamental
to  understanding  discursive  systems.  In  our  critique  of  the  preeminence  of
traditional and historical conceptions, we have suggested that historical time need
not be based on an abstract and theoretical concept of continuity; rather, if we
build history, then historical time must also be built on the basis of activities. The
dialogical interaction, even at the linguistic level, is not composed of a sequence
of  words  or  statements,  but  rather  is  made  possible  by  a  structuration  of  a
common theme across passive-active-passive phases that unite and differentiate
the dialogical partners. Such phases constitute a flexible temporal field that offers
options  and  possibilities.  The  possibilities  appear  within  contexts  of  relevant
events, and the latter signify options for possible changes. This is to say; the field
has horizons wherein events signify possibilities of activity and handling of such
events.

158   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
As with places, times are equally structured in accordance with practical activities
and corporeal orientations and are divisible into various articulations of what is
near and remote within the contexts of tasks. Something will take a day to do,
something  will  require  a  month,  and  functions  and  events  are  assigned  their
locations within the allotted temporal field. Some options are excluded as too
time-consuming,  some  are  modified,  and  others  may  be  combined.  Such
structuration is a highly complex awareness, and language is inadequate to follow
its complexities. Our activities reflect one upon the other in practical terms of
what we can and cannot do, what can be repeated, and what is not worth the
effort. Such reflexivity takes for granted temporal horizons. While undertaking a
task,  we  set  a  temporal  field  for  its  achievement,  such  that  the  “future”
possibilities of completion reflect upon the selection of activities at present. One
cannot take up another task today, or one cannot take three days off, because such
options,  reflected  from  the  possible  completion  of  the  accepted  task,  must  be
excluded. In turn, within the temporal field of action for the completion of the
task, there arises an “inner-reflexivity” of possibilities of selection of actions and
of numerous objects and instrumentalities for the task. If one must finish the task
in one month, then one must accomplish the requisite actions in two weeks to get
to the end of the task, but this means that by next week, certain things will have to
be  in  place  if  the  second  week's  work  is  to  be  attained;  all  this  leads  to  the
reflexivity  of  time-in-time,  of  complex  possibilities  within  possibilities,
comprising a depth of temporal field of action. One does not perform an action at
present  and  then  another  action  at  the  next  moment;  each  action,  and  every
implement,  object,  and  event,  have  complex  temporal  interconnections  that
structure  those  actions,  objects,  and  events  significatively.  In  short,  practical
activities  are  composed  of  a  practical  system  of  flexible  places  and  temporal
horizons,  and  they  belong  to  this  system  of  corporeal  interaction.
Obviously, any sort of location of an event “in history” presupposes the event’s
concrete location in the oriented world of places and times, of options taken and
options rejected, and not in a world of homogeneous space and unilinear time.
While we might assume that trees in a forest have locations in a homogeneous
space, such locations are, as a matter of fact, unavailable. If we face a forest, some
trees are to the left, others to the right, and some are behind one another—because
we also stand in a specific location. Once we move, what was to the left will be
behind, and what was behind will be to the right. In short, with our movements,
things get “relocated” just as much as we. I am here because I am standing to the
left of a tree and if I move, some trees will change locations and will relocate my
position. And yet again, we encounter particular phenomena, previously described
as concrete yet general, given, yet not given as a brute fact or a datum. These
phenomena were called “eidetic” because of their concreteness, and at the same
time, because of their generality. The flexible and interrelated systems of places

Can I—Can You—Can We?
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   159
and  times  are  concrete  and  completely  coextensive  with  and  intertwined  in
corporeal  activities  and  tasks,  and  yet  they  have  an  eidetic  generality  that  is
accessible to everyone. Whether one points to something and thus establishes a
direction from here to there, or whether one says that a certain activity should be
postponed  until  tomorrow  because  other  things  have  to  be  done  today,  one  is
communicating concretely and in a sufficient generality that can be loosened up,
made more flexible, complex, tightened up, without reaching any geometric or
digital precision. Indeed, in the world of action and practical communication, such
precision  is  comprehensible  in  a  context  of  places  and  times,  tasks  and
possibilities, and hence constantly situated and transgressed toward the field in
which  it  makes  sense.  Surface  dimensions  shift  to  depth  dimensions,  and
conversely.  Three-dimensionality  and  temporal  linearity  are  only  abstractive
constructs.
The inexactitude and the flexibility are the initial awareness composing the factual
systems, i.e., even every empirical fact is a system of explorations, implications,
and  interconnections.  And  such  explorations  are  given  in  the  context  of  the
general fields of oriented body. There is an entire open forward field, left, right,
and  upward  fields  which  can  explore  any  empirical  fact  by  narrowing,
concentrating or expanding its features. While engaged in his mathematical mode
of  awareness,  the  astronomer  will  face  the  entire  region,  will  focus  his  AI
telescope on this “quadrant” of galaxies to be explored, combined into clusters,
given one next to the other, slightly to the left and almost behind another, and all
assuming the oriented, kinesthetic body, also built into the orientations of his AI
telescopes. Such systems exhibit characteristics of things that are “loose”. While
focusing on this galaxy, at this location and distance “from here”, the astronomer
will explore this galaxy also in its temporal depth “from now” and find that he
will never reach the mathematical point of a homogeneous space and time without
introducing corporeal field awareness and its kinesthetic, tacit background. The
ideal, geometric and mathematical worlds do not picture or represent anything in
the  practical  world.  Although  they  can  deal  with  enumerable  facts,  the
understanding  of  such  facts  is  contextualized  in  practical  systems  and  thus
assumes an awareness which is a play, both from looseness toward exactness, and
from  ideality  toward  pure  datum.  If  the  ideal  systems  are  to  be  situated,  they
assume the awareness of field features of sizes, shapes, comparative differences,
sketches, outlines, and contours that have singular and factual generalities. We
speak of oblong, rectangular, egg-shaped, flat or wavy, straight or curvy, smooth
or rough, spiral and scattered characteristics; they are accessible to corporeal and
active  processes,  and  have  fitting,  unfitting,  appropriate,  or  inappropriate
relationships. We can say that the table is too big for the room, that the pot is too
heavy for the stand, without going into precise measures. Their being “between”
ideality and pure datum allows for flexibility that can range from broad generality

160   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
to  increased  specificity  without  a  loss  of  their  “morphological  functions”.
Obviously, such flexibility is important in the practical domain where things have
to be adjusted in their places and relationships, from kitchens to galaxies.
We should avoid confusion by stressing the distinction between facts, idealities,
and morphological characteristics. Facts are located in homogeneous space and
time  and  have  two  levels  of  characteristics:  the  immediate-qualitative,  given
through the so-called five senses, and the quantitative, given by the system of
measurements. Idealities, as measures, can be understood without any specific
relationship to things; we can deal with numbers, geometries, and logic without
referring to anything in the world of direct perceptual processes. Morphological
features are completely intertwined with corporeal fields of exploration that do
not coincide with impressions or with ideal structures. One cannot speak of an
ideal egg-shape, or a perfectly rough surface, or an absolutely crooked street. The
looseness  of  such  features  is  what  allows  for  communication  in  the  practical
domain. Indeed, one’s awareness of something egg-shaped, spiral, or clustered is
very specific, and yet its generality is sufficient to warrant a commonality that
accommodates  unique  differences  without  a  loss  of  a  given  morphological
composition.
Finally, the practically-oriented world is peculiarly relative, yet its relativity has
its necessity—eidetic inevitability. The practical, oriented awareness seems to be
the locus that provides the intermediary, the in-between domain that does not
demand  an  abstract  “lingua  universalis”  or  its  reverse,  a  sum  of  facts  for  a
successful  understanding,  but  rather  a  flexible,  yet  comprehensible,  process,
involving functional corporeity and its structuration of contexts. When we speak
of relativity, we must also speak of these corporeal functions in relationship to the
morphological features of practical things and surroundings. If we ask about the
experienced size of a thing, we must understand that the size is not a property of
the thing alone, but is a functional relationship between the body, the thing, and
the surrounding context. The object looks big because we are next to it; if we
move away from it, the object looks smaller, and if we climb a hill, the object
looks “insignificant”. This suggests that phenomenology does not give absolute
credence to objects and their “inherent” qualities, but rather it is very keen on the
practical and hence the relational and morphological characteristics that belong in
concrete  settings  and  engagements.  Such  settings  are  sensible,  and  corporeal
awareness in practical action provides the already-assumed meanings of factually
interconnected  events  and  actions  within  whose  contextual  generalities  the
historically, scientifically, and intersubjectively transmitted conceptions assume
their concrete places and times.

Can I—Can You—Can We?
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   161
The claims that there are institutionalized discourses which require individuals to
subject  themselves  to  those  discourses  must  assume  a  corporeal  and  inter-
corporeal awareness of movement, space-time awareness of places and times and,
therefore,  a  system  of  corporeal  orientations  as  a  condition  for  using  the
discursive  strategies.  The  discursive  logic  is  two-dimensional;  without  a
multidimensional, multi-field body which, as a dynamic mode of awareness, is
coextensive with the signitive movements of vectors of spatiality and temporality
of  a  life-world,  discursive  awareness  could  not  be  implemented;  it  would  not
make sense. When we are talking about corporeity and inter-corporeity, we are
not  suggesting  something  psychological,  individualistic,  or  physiological-
scientific.  These  notions  are  metaphysical,  since  they  try  to  reduce  inter-
corporeity to an entity in a pregiven space and time. Anyone who is engaged in
any strategic discourse in any culture will also accept passively the awareness of
kinesthetic corporeity and inter-corporeity as actions in correlation to tasks to be
performed in a cultural, socio-economic, productive setting.
Given the assumption of the discursive practices, there is no way to understand
why there should be a discontinuity in history. After all, discourses of any type,
including scientific and mathematical, are significations that imply a continuity.
Even modern AI technical metaphysics—quantification—are without time and
can be continuously repeated any time. But, that the breakdown of continuous
history, including the building of AI technologies, can be discarded, obsolete, and
junked is possible on the basis of what we do and what we stop doing, of what we
build, and what we destroy. Architecturally speaking, one mode of building is
discarded and becomes a relic for tourists, while other modes of building become
the  current  style.  The  previous  one  does  not  imply,  nor  does  it  necessarily
continue, the current one; they can be different and discontinuous. This is to say,
the  previous  acquired  corporeal  activities  of  building  or  even  producing  are
discarded,  and  new  ones  are  constituted  in  the  face  of  new  tasks.  Thus,  the
previous “I can” is no longer required, and a new “I can” is constituted. In this
sense, there is no necessity for a continuous historical subject. Those who cannot
acquire the abilities required by the new tasks to be performed are designated as
incapable  and  maybe  inferior.  In  short,  their  sedimented  activities,  which
constituted their self-identity as “I can” are no longer required for the current
tasks. Hence, they lose their position, status, pride, dignity, and so forth, because
they “cannot do” the required activities. It is obvious that the “menial” activities
are taken over by a great variety of AI performers.
If we regard Western modern globalization, which extends technologies of mass
production,  we  shall  see  that  this  globalization  requires  very  different  inter-
corporeal activities than those that were acquired by indigenous peoples. In the
period of postcolonialism, it is not sufficient to understand modern discursive

162   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
strategies  in  opposition  to  indigenous  discursive  strategies  as  cultural
confrontations. Rather, more primordially, there is a required reconstitution of the
inter-corporeal transcendental conditions that would be necessary for functioning
in the Western modern setting. This is the ground for “cultural discontinuity”.
Given  the  reconstitution  of  the  life-world  of  a  given  people  by  globalizing
modernity,  there  is  also  a  reconstitution  of  what  people  do  concretely  and
corporeally in this new life-world. If a life-world is a system of concrete inter-
corporeal signitive structures and implications, these significative implications
appear only in the background of inter-corporeal awareness. I know what I can do,
and I know what we can do, in the face of given tasks, but now I must learn how
to do in the face of very different tasks, laden with technologies. No doubt, the
constitution  of  corporeity  is  social  and  cultural;  nonetheless,  the  prescriptions
assume that a corporeity can take on a structuration process as an acquisition of
abilities of “I-we can”.
Bodily activities constitute an ineradicable field which is not dumb, but rather an
articulated process that does not emerge into the foreground—specifically since it
is not entitative but constitutive of space and time patterns as fields. The latter are
neither interior nor exterior; hence, reflective awareness is inadequate to grasp it.
Rather, it is a taken-for-granted region of departure for any investigation of the
lived  world  and  a  field  of  history.  Each  gesture  and  movement  is  formed
spontaneously  and  recognized  in  correlation  to,  and  distinction  from,  others.
Those  social  requirements  comprise  a  field  of  inter-corporeal  activities  where
what I can do is read directly what the others are doing. Let us take a soccer game
where each player reads the body directions and movements in correlation to the
entire field of the game. This is to say, where my teammates are and in what
directions  they  are  moving,  and  where  the  opponents  are  and  how  they  are
positioning themselves, will also constitute my kinesthetic requirements as to how
I  must  move  toward  my  teammates  and  opponents,  comprising  the  entire
formation of space and time and kinesthetic field. In this sense, what discursive
proponents claim about discursive practices as a clash of powers, requires the
most basic awareness of where, when, and how one must act in order to practice
the  discursive  strategies.  The  passive  constitution  of  space-time  signitive
corporeal engagements is lived prior to any understanding of what the discursive
strategy means. While the above illustration we offer seems to apply to the field
of  sports,  all  social  activities  engage  in  the  performance  of  tasks  which  also
constitute  a  body  that  is  an  inter-corporeal  field  body.
What is at issue for the now-accepted globalizing Western modernization is the
compelled  reconstitution  of  corporeal  and  inter-corporeal  practices.  The  latter
must be constituted in terms of the technical modes of production that require an

Can I—Can You—Can We?
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   163
increasing fragmentation and militarization of activities. This is the condition for
the modern conception of the division of labor and Foucault’s (1970) conception
of modern militarization, not to speak of the behaviorist conception of the one-to-
one correlation of atomistic stimuli to localizable responses, or what Merleau-
Ponty (1962) called the “constancy hypothesis”. This is to say, even the science of
human  behavior,  being  globalized  by  psychology,  consists  of  a  radically
fragmented corporeal set of activities, such that none know what the others are
doing. But as is well known, even this psychology is a technique of behavioral
modification, whether industrial, clinical, educational, social, or criminal. And all
of them are “floating” on an understanding of what I—You—We can or cannot
do.
CONCLUSION
The  background  awareness  as  a  body  in  action  requires  the  rejection  of  the
modern Western metaphysical dualism of “mind/body”. The mind thinks and is
identical  to  metaphysical  consciousness,  while  this  consciousness  directs  the
mechanical  body  in  a  mysterious  way—debated  by  an  entire  materialist  and
idealist tradition. There is the subject “inside” of which there is a mind, “inside”
of which there are feelings and concepts, and all “insides” are “inside” the body.
Up until now, debates ranged on how this “inside” the body subject, with all of its
“insides” connects to the body to get “outside” of it. Thus, all the resolutions of
this dualism have resulted either in making everything “mental” or reducible to
the mechanical body. The way the latter relates to the world is mechanical—some
sort  of  stimulus-response,  or  causes  which  propel  it  into  action.  As
phenomenological  arguments  would  point  out,  such  a  body  could  not  find  a
kitchen from a dining room; after all, there are no stimuli from the kitchen to
cause such a body to go and look for something “there”. And yet, we do go and
look for something before stimuli in an open field of space-time horizon. The very
kinesthetic activity of going there to find something is “consciousness”, despite
the fact that it is not located inside the body. After all, a movement around a table
is  neither  “inside”  nor  “outside”  and  yet  it  is  the  “awareness”  of  the  table
appearing through perspectives formed by the movement. None of these features
are  either  objective  or  subjective,  and  yet  they  are  the  very  composition  of
“consciousness”  of  the  table.  And  this  consciousness  as  a  dynamic  system  of
corporeal activities is “written” in every AI construct accessible to all, including a
Soviet collective farm maiden who meets her first tractor, advertising the progress
made by the party leadership.

CHAPTER 9
The Multi-Discursive Subject
Abstract: Starting from the premise that formal-mathematical modes of awareness are
“discourses”, this chapter traces the connections between postmodernism, the rise of
the  instrumentalist  mode  of  thinking  that  has  enabled  the  creation  of  artificial
intelligence, and the attack on the notion of identity, the combination of which tends to
strip away the humanity from the modern “subject”, which is apprehended as “self-
creating” from this perspective. It then describes how nations and cultures are sucked
into the all-encompassing technologization trap through the promise of better living
through  technology,  reinforced  by  the  trends  of  globalization,  even  if  that  means
accepting the poison pill of dehumanization on an individual level. What follows is a
discussion of “traditional” cultures which reject this ideology of self-creating subjects
in  favor  of  their  traditional  religious  beliefs.  We  then  discuss  the  value  of
transcendental subjectivity in opposition to both of the afore-mentioned ideologies,
pointing to the ways that this mode of awareness embraces multiplicities and rejects the
totalizing or encompassing mathematization of experience. The chapter concludes with
an exposition of the importance of meaning-making—that is, the signitive—to all these
modes of perception, and its actual foundation in transcendental subjectivity.
Keywords:  Communication,  Discourse,  Globalization,  Instrumentality,  Logic,
Meaning,  World.
INTRODUCTION
The  quantitative  mode  of  awareness  has  become  global  and  fragmented  into
multiple  disciplines.  By  now,  such  disciplines  have  their  own  formal-
mathematical modes of awareness, and such modes are regarded as “discourses”,
resulting  in  multi-discursivity.  Thus,  modernity  is,  at  the  outset,  multi-
discursive—at  least  within  its  accepted  metaphysical  parameters  expressed
mathematically. We suspect, and even accept objections to, the designation of the
modern mode of awareness as “metaphysical”. After all, the scientific method is
regarded as empirical and objective. Let us recall what the modern structure of
“reality” is. It is an atomistic, materialist, homogeneous aggregate of “building
blocks” or the “ultimate particles”—and everything outside of this reality has no
claim to existence. If such a claim is made, then it is metaphysical—i.e., beyond
the physical. And it is precisely the modern subject which occupies this physically
non-existent region. Since  mathematics is  discovered in  this  region,  it  has  no

claim to be a feature of “objective” reality. Thus, it belongs to the subjective
metaphysics.  Given  that  the  latter  has  no  real,  “objective”  characteristics,
whatever comes from it is an Artificial Construct, a poetic creation, and, when
applied to construct the ontological reality in the form of technologies, the latter
also  becomes  AI.  Thus,  the  feature  of  this  globalized  AI  phenomenon  is
“discursive  power”.  If  we  can  define  something  mathematically,  then  we  can
make it, and what we make embodies our discourse. The empirical—technical
product—is an “imago hominis”. The magical discourses embodied in high-tech
seem to be our own creations, but, like all creations, they have escaped us and any
implement we use; the AI creates more such discourses and demands of us that
we learn how to speak or become discarded as outdated. There are programs and
lessons  for  “older”  persons  to  learn  “computer  language”  in  order  to  have  a
minimal capacity to live in this AI world. This discursive power was appropriated
by  many  other  Western  trends,  including  postmodern  proponents  of  multi-
discursivity. Since there are no external criteria to determine which discourse is
correct, then all of them must be given an equal right to speak.
THE MULTI-DISCURSIVE WORLD
The claims by postmodernists to multiple discursivities, and therefore multiple
discursive powers, is a continuation and maintenance of the modern metaphysical
mathematical  universalization  of  multi-discursive  AI  disciplines.  First,
postmodernity is a continuation of modernity and has in fact, globalized itself
under  the  claim  that  it  can  save  other  cultures  from  Western  metaphysical
modernization.  It  is  no  wonder  that  various  regions  of  the  world  that  want  to
acquire identity in the pretended context of modern globalization are constantly
appealing  to  being  postmodern.  Second,  the  various  claims  to  cultural  self-
identity, in contrast to modern universal atomistic individualism, is a variant of
individualism at the cultural level. The notion of individuality, at whatever level,
and its identity remain intact. Third, modern universalization and the postmodern
challenge to it follow the same logic and therefore impose individuality and its
extension to cultural individuality and rights.
Postmodern texts, inclusive of deconstructive rhetoric, have proclaimed the death
of identity and, specifically the identity of the subject. The latter is regarded as
one  modern  discourse  having  no  universal  validity.  Add  to  this  the  prevalent
reduction  of  all  phenomena  to  material  explanations—chemical,  biological,
physiological, evolutionary—and the subject becomes a cross-section of multiple
discursive constructs. Morality is genetics, love is chemistry, and knowledge is
brain cells. The problem is that the abolition of the modern subject fails to account
for  the  background  subject  which  has  no  pregiven  definitions.  The  modern
subject, which has been universalized in various pronouncements, including the

The Multi-Discursive Subject
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   167
United  Nations’  proclamation  of  universal  human  rights,  both  individual  and
cultural, and postmodern claims that demand respect for different cultural styles
of self-determination, and the invention of novel formal discourses, are premised
on a “subject” as self-generating. At the dawn of Western modernity, Pico della
Mirandolla (1956) announced that humans have no nature, no essence, no rules by
which to live, and therefore whatever nature humans will possess, whatever rules
will be followed, whether scientific or political, will have to be invented as if “out
of nothing”. This is an initial suggestion that the modern ultimate subject intends
to be self-created without any other conditions, including theological, scientific,
and ontological, to the extent that the very distinctions between those terms are
equally invented without precedence. This is the intentionality that comprises the
background for the articulation of what humans are as self-created. Therefore,
there is no pregiven subject that can be used as a criterion to determine the human
subject. The subject is posited as totally self-constituting without any conditions:
an unconditional subject. This self-creative subject is totally autonomous, and in
its autonomy, it creates unconditional methods and theories that then, through an
autonomous will, can create its own environment.
One aspect of this creation is a scientific mode of awareness that is in a position to
create AI, with abilities that, seemingly, surpass its creator, envisaged in Sci-Fi,
where robots rebel against humans as inefficient, emotional, and redundant. The
efforts to deconstruct and abolish this kind of self-generating subject fail on two
counts: First, the modern subject at the outset does not have any identity, and
second,  the  claims  to  its  deconstruction,  abolition  or  reduction  are  the
performances  of  such  a  subject.  The  multi-discursivity,  multiple  technical
disciplines,  are  premised  on  the  modern  autonomous  subject.  This  is  equally
obvious from the claims that discourses, including mathematics, have no causal,
natural,  or  supernatural  necessitation,  but  are  pure  constructs.  Even  Foucault
(1972), with all his social histories to rely upon, could not escape his invention of
all sorts of monuments, “meaningless” functions, as an anonymous subject. This
means that all such claims still accept the self-creation of the modern subject as a
creator of its own logic for mastery of its own world and for self-definition. It is
impossible for any culture to claim that it has an identity without having accepted
the logic of choice between the right of every individual to make his/her own
identity, or the right of a particular group to respect its own identity. What is at
issue  here  is  that  the  globalizing  universality  of  the  modern  subject  is  being
proliferated by postmodernity and, in a narrower sense, by multi-disciplines and
their fragmentation into other disciplines. The autonomous self-creating modern
metaphysical subject has become universal.
Before entering the question concerning the “tension” between AI in its various
forms  and  the  subject,  some  attention  must  be  given  to  the  reasons  why  the

modern Western metaphysical mode of awareness, in its mathematical form, is so
attractive.  After  all,  it  seems  to  be  a  danger  as  it  sweeps  across  the  globe,
homogenizes the environment, and runs over indigenous cultures and traditions.
Despite their varieties, they are, in accordance with Western “objective” ontology,
subjective.  Why  would  “the  others”  accept  their  own  demise  and  join  “world
history” which is a pure appendage to progress for its own sake? The problem is
that it is no longer possible to back out of globalization; its technical efficiency
and promise of a “better” life is part of the awareness of every culture. Their
members see themselves in relation to this efficiency, productivity, and liberation
from natural calamities and necessities, as part of their lives. This creates internal
tension within various cultures and a dual self-recognition. One still maintains his
own cultural discourses, yet also judges those discourses in light of the global
imagery of the “good life”. Hence, one sees himself, his position, and life-world
from another—global—life-world. Just as important, global technical media make
available a great variety of cultural life-worlds, placing one’s own as one among
many, and no longer the most significant, leaving the modern global world as the
only shared world. In this sense, the creation of experts for global tasks allows
them  to  be  “at  home”  in  any  culture  without  commitment  to  any.  Such  dual
consciousness  frames  the  struggles  within  various  cultures,  forming  the
background for nomadic civilization. The modernizers, who claim to be part of
their  own  culture,  want  to  transform  that  culture  into  one  that  is  “civilized”,
practically efficient, objective, and beneficial to individuals, liberating them from
their own ignorance, superficially clinging to the uniqueness of their own culture.
In  one  sense,  there  is  a  demand  to  use  the  environment  in  a  “desacralized”
homogenized manner, purely for the purpose of the benefit of social members:
health, employment, and increased wages as signs of the good life. In another
sense, there is a wish to claim that we in our culture have spiritual values which
do  not  allow  one  to  reduce  the  environment,  including  the  human,  to  mere
resources. Within this tension, the adjudication cannot be had on the basis of some
criteria,  stemming  either  from  one  or  another  culture  or  from  the  process  of
globalization,  which  is  more  true.  Thus,  the  only  criterion  is:  which  is  more
beneficial  materially?
The  contemporary  solution  to  this  tension  is  power.  We  witness  many
confrontations between groups within given cultures that promote modernization,
and  at  the  same  time,  fundamentalists,  nationalists,  and  traditionalists  resist
modernization. This means that a given culture is split into those who propagate
the need to become globalized and modern and, at the same time, those who,
recognizing the necessity of this modernization, propose a battle against it as an
imposition  of  an  alien  culture.  In  principle,  they  claim  that  we  may  use  the
efficiency of modern technology to resist the very system that this technology
imposes on us. In this sense, globalization constitutes a power confrontation, all

the  way  from  holy  wars  to  so-called  passive  resistance.  The  dual  awareness
discloses a temporal horizon of possibilities in such a way that one possibility is
regarded to be the recuperation of the past, while the other is offered as the future.
Politically speaking, the rhetoric states that the one from the past is conservative
and  traditional,  while  the  other  is  liberal,  individualistic,  open,  and  even
humanistic. Whether this designation is true or false is not our concern. At this
point, a specific conception of the world is divided into a closed past and open
future. Yet, the basic issue is: The “past” seems to demand a human, qualitative
awareness pitted against AI, designed to completely discard such qualities and
even  design  algorithms  which  can  circumvent  any  biological,  chemical,  and
physiological traits and create a “new man” who would be an embodiment of AI
discourses. The idea is that the future should be controlled by the combined will
of the people of this planet; after all, it is the future that we want. The extolling of
AI does not mean that the latter will get smarter than its creators, but that we shall
voluntarily  surrender  the  very  transcendental  awareness  that  we  are—our
curiosity,  creativity,  autonomy,  all  qualities  such  as  compassion,  eros—to  a
narrow, algorithmically driven vision of what is “essential”. The question: Is the
autonomous, self-created subject abolished? Will it remain in the background of
the discarded cultures and their qualitative awareness and remind us of who we
are and what we have lost?
While  this  option  might  seem  plausible,  there  is  an  issue,  mentioned  above,
concerning the “death” of the subject in the context of multi-culturalism. Different
cultural  discourses  define  humans  in  their  own  ways,  and  hence  there  is  no
universal anything which would point to a subject acceptable by all. Quite the
opposite: Members of other cultures not only do not have a “subject” but reject it
as an imposition of Western globalization. One can readily see this in various
cultures where the self-creation of a subject, and its creation of the environment,
including  human  life,  is  an  insult  to  some  symbolic  designs  where  “man  is
created” by a supreme authority. Indeed, such self-creation is relegated to man’s
demonic pride and his modern life-world as the Great Satan. This context seems
to deny any possibility of finding an essential counterweight to AI. In principle,
AI either subjects all under its mode of awareness, or it fragments and discards
other cultures as subjective and thus non-existent. While initial AI seemed to be
simply mechanical and under our control—machines could lift more, move faster,
dig deeper—discarding our shovels—now they will put us in the back seat and
drive the cars in order to prevent “human mistakes” until finally they will take
over our “thinking” functions with greater speed than us, the deficient carbon-
based units, and calculate what materials to use and invent for our increasing
diverse projects. The AI, of course, have our modern mode of awareness: They
see everything mathematically. Even a forklift “sees” how many pounds it can lift
at  what  angle  and  how  high.  Who  needs  us,  inefficient,  slow,  carbon-based,

fallible weaklings? If we are to escape this sort of conclusion, we must return to
philosophy—even  if  it  is  a  politically  incorrect,  perhaps  Western  Socratic
philosophy,  daring  to  challenge  its  own  established,  modern  “reality”  and  the
abolition  of  the  human  subject—by  the  subject  and  its  embodied  magical
discourses.
To accept this challenge, we must expand the parameters of our discussions which
so far have left us with a principle, pervading modern Western understanding: It
tacitly assumes that we do not experience things or events directly: Our awareness
is mediated by a specific mode of representation: mathematical and, by extension,
technical. The latter allows for both, testing new projects, including hypotheses,
and  constructing  or  using  available  technical  means  to  establish  whatever  we
value as “the latest”. The mediation also extends to the claim by all theorists: We
live in an environment of a linguistic tradition, which shapes our interpretation of
all things; and linguistic structures are identical with a given life-world. The latter
is identical to the magic of words. Despite their differences, the common claim is
that all meaning and making sense, all understanding, inhere in language, even if
one of them, mathematics, might be proclaimed as the universal language. After
all,  it  appears  on  every  food  product,  stating  the  numbers  of  calories,  grams,
ounces,  and  percentages  of  chemicals.  The  issue  of  awareness  seems  to  be
surpassed since there is no need for a subject who can claim to be a source of
making sense of events. We find the sense of events in our modern historical
tradition. This is to say, there is no longer any requirement for the last vestiges of
modem metaphysics located within the sphere of what Kant, and later Husserl,
called  transcendental  subjectivity.  We  have  accepted  a  tradition  where  the
mathematical  mode  of  awareness,  and  its  technically  interpreted  environment,
constructs  and  “explains”  all  events,  including  ourselves—without  residua,  in
such a way that, if there are some not yet accounted for problems, they will be
resolved in the future. Of course, Socrates will raise a question as to whether such
a promise is possible with a mathematical mode of awareness.
Whether the claim that the subject is redundant by virtue of being defined by a
specific tradition is a solution or a mere postponement and a relocating of the
question of sense will be seen in the development of the problematic of theories
and methods. Counter to the claims that all sense inheres in a tradition and its
prevalent discourse as a mode of awareness, the transcendental argument purports
to show that all awareness, even the modern positions, are premised on a final
moment of reflection whose presence cannot be denied without the denying thesis
becoming nonsensical. If this holds, then it could be said that any thesis, any
position  is,  in  the  final  analysis,  transcendental.  This  appears  in  a  tacit
introduction of reflective awareness into every position, theory, or method. Such
tacit  introduction  appears  with  a  spontaneous  activity  of  awareness  called

The Multi-Discursive Subject
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   171
“attentional modification”. Without any question as to the “reality” status, any
teacher, any scientist, can say “let us look at mathematics” as at any other subject
matter; but one will also recognize that “looking at...” as intentionality does not
look like the subject matter that is being intended—in this case, numbers. Yet,
how easily the sense of “looking at…” or an “awareness of…” can be modified
spontaneously  in  cases  when  anyone  can  say:  “Let  us  look  at  things
mathematically”. This suggests that mathematics becomes a mode of awareness
which is very distinct from the things or subject matters that this mode intends.
Other modes are just as available: We can look at things theoretically, practically,
theologically,  and  aesthetically  and  realize  that  such  modes  are  not  at  all
“subjective” in the sense of mental or psychological states. In this way, we can
also say, “Let us look at language”, whereby the awareness of language is not part
of language, or we can say, “Let us look at the world linguistically” and hence
make a transcendental claim that all awareness is linguistic. But the claim that all
awareness is linguistic is not linguistic—it is an awareness accessible to anyone,
anytime, and anywhere. Such awareness is not subjective in any psychological,
mental, physiological senses, since all such subjective states can be objects of
awareness, such that the latter does not possess any of those subjective features.
After all, cultural scholars have no qualms in claiming that in their research, they
are looking at different languages while comparing their structures, looking for
common  etymological  compositions,  without  imposing  their  own  current
language  as  some  sort  of  universal  criterion.  In  fact,  they  include  their  own
language  as  one  among  others  for  comparison.  If  this  general  awareness  of
“looking  at  languages”  did  not  hold,  then  we  would  end  up  in  an  indefinite
regress,  constantly  requiring  one  more  language  to  interpret  all  others.
A closer consideration of this issue might add to the understanding of the presence
of the just-mentioned general or transcendental awareness. It was shown that there
is  no  direct  and  demonstrable  connection  between  theoretical  thought  and  the
domain of the life-world experience of things, cultural objects, and even language.
The  experienced  phenomena  are  “external”  to  theories,  and  the  conjunction
between  them  has  no  necessity.  The  conjunction  requires  a  conjoiner  whose
understanding  must  be  broader  than  the  theory  and  its  selected  perceptual
domains.  The  conjoiner  is  a  reflecting  process  that  performs  the  task  from  a
vantage point of interest, whether the latter is culturally prejudged, linguistically
prescribed, or part of a historical tradition. In this sense, an application of a theory
does not yield pure objective perceptual phenomena, but one that is interpreted by
the theoretical requirements and, finally, by some contextual interest. The latter is
usually  understood  in  cultural,  historical,  or  linguistic  terms.  Of  course,  the
“interest”  can  be  simple  curiosity  concerning  the  ways  that  a  theory  can  be
applied  to  a  given  domain  in  the  world.  Let  us  look  closer  at  this  practice.

172   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
One position, discussed above, proposed that the “subject” is one component in a
broader context of an interpretation of the world—such as modern. Assuming this
position, it must be the case that the scientist, or the theorizing subject, as cultural
and historical, is also a factor in the domain of investigation. The philosopher, if
he/she  is  a  part  of  his/her  own  history,  cannot  claim  to  obtain  the  given
phenomena  without  changing  them.  The  very  theoretical  explanation,  which
assumes a position toward the phenomena of its world, will transform the subject
matter  of,  and  by,  such  explanation.  While  researching  a  subject  matter,  the
researcher’s explanations will also change such subject matter. In turn, if a theory
is  part  of  a  culture  and  history  and  is  shaped  by  them,  then  no  theory  is
sufficiently broad to encompass even its own tradition, not to speak of others, and
offer a universal interpretation. It is only one aspect of its tradition, a culture, or
language.  If  positivism  were  to  offer  two  contesting  meta-languages,  each
claiming  to  account  for  all  the  usages  of  a  given  language,  then  the  debate
between them would involve a language that is broader than either meta-language.
Indeed,  this  can  also  be  said  of  any  explanation  which  posits  unsurpassable
ground of all understanding of things; it too is a contingent position belonging to a
specific tradition and hence cannot offer a universal claim, in our case, the use of
one  theoretical  awareness—mathematics.  The  claim  that  such  an  awareness  is
universal,  in  contrast  to  other  discursive  modes  of  awareness,  includes  a
comparative awareness which does not belong to either quantitative or qualitative
modes—a flash of another mode.
Perhaps the most pronounced way of this manner of theorizing, i.e., proposing a
universal explanation which intends to overcome the problems of inherence in a
linguistic culture, was offered by positivism and is still paraded by the mainstream
analytic mode of theorizing. In the first case, there is an a priori position which
posits a reality in itself, untainted by any tradition, and can be accessed by an
appropriate mode of awareness, constituting a language, which composes both
theory and method. But this means that all other modes of awareness in and of the
world have to be discarded or reduced to the posited mono-logical discourse and
homogeneous world. Yet, these positions do not escape the issue of the awareness
of the world to the extent that the discourse of the method and theory does not in
any  way  imply  direct  access  to  the  posited  reality.  Such  reality  is  always
transformed in terms of modern methods and theory and thus becomes valuatively
and technically mediated. The method must be applied from a valuative position
which is pragmatic: What works for human benefit, at the price that humans must
also be reduced to the same reality. In brief, such reality does not offer itself in its
purity but in terms of what we can make of it, and thus transform it, through our
methodological and technical intervention.

The Multi-Discursive Subject
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   173
All that we have attained so far is that a given theory or a selected method cannot
be by itself the last moment of interpretation, since they are either one aspect of a
given  historical  tradition,  or  they  are  interpreted  by  some  valuative  point  of
interest which might be seen as the last point of interpretation. Moreover, the very
objectivity that is being sought is not attainable, since every effort to reach it leads
to an understanding that it is compelled to change in accordance with the point of
interest that may be laden with numerous interpretations or with the very process
of the application of theory to the reality that is radically selective of what will
count as objective among the various ontological options and thus posits an a
priori decision as to what will be the data of its theory. This is to say, all other
data will not be tolerated as objective and dismissed as theoretically redundant,
perhaps subjective. But such a position will not include a justification for the
principle  of  selectivity  of  the  required  ontology  or  its  own  position.  If  an
explanation is universal, then it must be explained by the selected ontology and
the  prescriptive  discourse.  If  not,  then  neither  the  theory  nor  a  methodology,
posing  in  their  formal  and  quantitative  language,  can  claim  to  be  an  all-
encompassing  and  final  interpreter.
From what has been said so far, it can be concluded in one regard that the subject,
or  the  last  interpreter,  who  constructs  theories,  correlates  them  to  selected
phenomena, and evaluates such correlation, cannot be, in principle, investigated
by any of the empirical sciences. If this were the case, then the very subject of
selectivity,  correlation,  and  interpretation  would  be  selected  as  an  object  of
another subject of selectivity and interpretation, leading to an infinite regress. In
brief, the last interpreter as the selecting and correlating awareness cannot be a
subject matter of any specific objective science and theory, and resultantly, it is
inaccessible to theories and methodologies of any philosophy or science. After all,
if one looks at scientific language, one notes that its logic and structure are not
derived  from  experienced  phenomena.  In  brief,  it  is  different  from  such
phenomena; thus, when applied, it becomes an interpretation. Moreover, if one
claims that a given language is distinct from the experienced phenomena, one
must  also  admit  that  she  has  an  awareness  of  things  that  are  not  bound  by
language;  after  all,  the  distinction  between  language  and  things  could  not  be
made. Let us consider the most prevalent modern claim that language is the all-
encompassing and inescapable understanding of the world and ourselves.
If  language  is  the  medium  in  which  all  events,  theories,  and  methods  are
understood, in which selectivity and designation of what is real, unreal, objective,
and  subjective  appears,  then  language  cannot  be  a  subject  matter  of  any
philosophy or theory, since the latter would be one aspect within the vastness of a
linguistic tradition. If a tradition and its horizons comprise the dimension in which
we  dwell,  then  such  a  tradition  could  not  be  grasped  by  any  theory  about  a

174   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
tradition, since such a theory, again would be a minor aspect of it. It could be said
that even the very notion that everything is an interpretation, comprising horizons
of past and future awareness, would be another partial interpretation which would
converge into the horizons of this all-encompassing horizon, inaccessible to any
interpretation—except  for  the  constant  appearance  of  awareness  of  the
convergence of the horizons into horizons. All these claims, by virtue of their
self-destruction,  become  necessarily  contingent.  And  yet,  left  to  their  own
devices, they seem to be the ultimate account. Indeed, it is ultimate because there
is a transcendental subject, who is aware of the tradition, its horizons, and the way
that  understanding  converges  into  such  horizons.  Such  a  subject  is  in  the
background of awareness of what AI can do, what technologies it can project, and
what  projected  possibilities  can  be  fulfilled  with  what  speed,  efficiency,  and
complexity.
As  was  already  noted,  the  transcendental  subjectivity  is  not  a  subject  in  any
psychological  or  mental—immanent—sense.  It  is  a  mode  of  awareness  that
anyone  may  assume  anywhere  and  anytime  without  any  metaphysical  or
ontological underpinnings. “Let us look at the world linguistically” or as present
in a “context of a historical tradition”, or as “culturally constituted”, or “let us
look at things mathematically”, “theologically”, or biblically through the “word of
God”, fully understanding that such, and other such modes of awareness, are not
“perspectives” toward the world, but the way the world as a whole appears. Given
the variety of modes of awareness, it is possible to perform them in their own
parameters,  not  as  objects  of  analysis,  but  as  “transcendental”  invariants  or
“eidetic” generalities, prior to generalization. While we marvel at AI, discussing it
as a result of algorithms, precise chips, materials, we already use it as a mode of
awareness: It “looks at the world of things mathematically” and it does so with
phenomenological method: It excludes all other modes of awareness—performs
bracketing  of  every  other  mode  and  assumes  an  invariant,  essential  mode:
quantification.  Thus,  it  is  indifferent  to  what  it  counts—votes,  investments,
productivity,  artworks,  social  trends,  surveys  of  religious  beliefs—with  total
disregard as to whether its accumulated data has any claim to reality, existence,
history—of course, it can deal with the latter if we provide it with texts from
which it can count wars, calculate strategies, mentions of prayers by emperors for
divine  support.  In  all  these  cases,  its  mode  of  awareness  “intends”  the  entire
universe in terms of an eidetic generality. Obviously, such generality does not
come from empirical generalization, but is prior to it and is assumed by anyone
performing any generalization. “Let us look at the world mathematically” does
not stem from counting apples, and then oranges, and angels or sheep, and then
concluding that we can count everything. Learning how to count sheep is learning
how to count stars, money, and economic “futures”. The transcendental  subject is

The Multi-Discursive Subject
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   175
not abolished; rather, one of its modes of awareness is extended by AI as it also
“intends” or “means” the world in such a mode within its eidetic limits. While our
discussions should have suggested more discourses of our tradition, it is necessary
to demonstrate various levels of concrete awareness which are accepted even by
general concepts found in available discourses. First, let us check the mentioned
thesis. More recently, the practical domain has been designated to function as
communication, specifically emphasizing language and interpretation to be the
basis  of  communicative  understanding.  In  addition,  some  of  the  linguistically
based theories appeal to scientific explanations of human interaction and thus use
formal  systems  as  the  universal  means  of  transmitting  information  and  of
explaining  phenomena.  Upon  closer  analysis,  the  explanations  are  completely
abstract from daily discourse and experience. This is one of the unique claims of
scientific thought: It purports to deal with the concrete, and yet it offers radically
abstract and formalized systems. The answer, of course, is in the demonstration
that such systems are applicable to concrete activities and practical purposes. This
claim lends credence to the views that an understanding of situations and contexts
is a socio-historically learned adaptation of rules, of interpretations of normative
and  theoretical  structures,  resulting  in  a  conjunction  of  theory  and  concrete
actions.  Such  claims  are  possible  on  two  traditional  assumptions:  First,  an
application  spells  dualism  between  form  and  content,  thought  and  reality,
structure  and  manifestation;  and  second,  the  conjunction  is  possible  in  an
instrumental  sense,  i.e.,  science  is  not  a  theoretical  explanation,  but  an
instrumental system for the mastery of nature in favor of human purposes. In both
cases,  the  outcome  of  this  conjunction  is  metaphysical  virulence;  i.e.,
metaphysics,  as  a  normative  construct,  is  used  to  change  the  world  to  fit  the
metaphysical constructs. In this sense, the abstract, formal systems, inaccessible
to  any  perception,  assume  an  inordinate  preeminence  against  the  concrete
experience, since the formal systems become reality by being instrumental. As
most serious researchers have seen, science no longer explains, but makes events
happen.
There is, in fact, a current tendency, resting, perhaps, on the modern conception of
the instrumentality of science, toward a practical basis and explanation of human
activities.  Most  diverse  theories,  from  neo-Marxism  through  communicative
competence, to postmodern conceptions of the production of truth, assure us that
their theories are praxis-laden. These theories equally claim that human activities
are  imbedded  in  a  human  world  with  its  historical  horizons.  One  specific
characteristic shared by such trends is the claim that their conceptions of praxis
are based on concrete historical contexts, allowing for the interpretive discourse
of scientific thinking and formal rules, and that such discourses offer a concrete
domain that can avoid the pitfalls of some of the transcendental phenomenological
trends. The latter is deemed to be idealistic and solipsistic. If communication is

176   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
possible,  then  its  basis  stems  from  historical  situations,  particular  forms  of
language,  interpretation,  and  understanding.
It is argued that phenomenology’s focus on the “objective” disconnects the given
from its context and social and historical interpretations, and assumes that such a
focus  offers  universally  acceptable  claims.  Moreover,  the  presumption  of
objectivity leads to the view that the individual is in a position to observe the
given  without  any  relationship  to  others  and  without  any  introduction  of
interpretations by a historically acquired language. In communicative terms, the
charge against phenomenology states that one cannot be a pure observer of the
given  without  any  admixtures  of  others  and  various  intermediaries  such  as
language.  Only  the  historically  and  socially  acquired  common  usages  and
practices  allow  for  the  understanding  and  communication  of  the  given.  The
actions and practices of the individual are examples of the common practices,
customs, and usages which are general and transgress the individual, i.e., he is a
representative of something intersubjective and common.
Despite  the  phenomenological  arguments  for  the  primacy  of  signification,  of
meaning as phenomena of experience, the attacks on phenomenology insist that
meaning is linguistic, and the latter not only transcends the individual, but allows
him  to  make  sense  of  himself.  Moreover,  the  phenomenologically  conceived
perceptual  object,  with  its  spatio-temporal  horizons,  is  deemed  an  inadequate
point of departure, requiring a historically effective consciousness, an objective
spirit,  encompassing  institutions  and  individual  activities.  One  is  born  into  a
communicative  system.  The  individual  lives  and  acts,  thinks  and  feels  in  the
sphere  of  commonality,  of  rules,  plans,  and  customs,  reaching  into  individual
motivations.  Thus,  every  plan,  every  explanation,  is  group-specific.  This
supposedly comprises a more encompassing and concrete domain. The individual
activity is a situational application of the modes of prescribed activity. In essence,
the sense interconnections of a tradition appear in a common praxis, constituting a
form of life and a life-world, and precede the individual. It follows, then, that the
genesis of awareness inheres in the common forms of historical life, institutions
and traditions that have far surpassed the individual. In common terminology,
without them, human activity would be blind, and with them, it is directed by an
authority of a tradition. The intentional activities of the individual are situated
signs or specifications and individuations of a historically and socially pregiven
intersubjectivity and life-world. The latter are the subject, while the individual is
their determinate object.
We encounter, here, a peculiar circularity. The common meanings must be already
in place and understood:

The Multi-Discursive Subject
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   177
1. if the individual is to make any sense of events, and
2. if the sense of practical activities is to be grasped.
But this suggests that meaning can be derived only from the already pregiven
common meanings. For phenomenology, the issue is with the “derived” and the
“only”. If it is presumed that an activity is understandable because it is a logical
derivation from pregiven meanings and socio-historically established rules, then
one would have to account for various interpretations of the “same” meanings and
rules. The variations would have to be attributed either to the incompetence of the
individual,  or  to  another  level  of  language,  i.e.,  the  interpretive  level,  or  to  a
silently experienced domain that makes sense of the meanings and rules simply by
being their unacknowledged source. The latter would have to make sense on its
own  if  it  becomes  an  interpretant  of  the  socio-historically-found  common
conceptions. The making of sense that can specify and concretize the conceptions
apparently must be a process that is not blind, and that is in a position to “know”
how to communicate with the world, and how to “apply” the socio-historically
acquired common meanings, concepts, and rules. This circularity is also at the
base of all AI constructs. We can take any technical construct and use it as means
to open possibilities for projecting “novel” constructs and thus embodying the
“previous” constructs as a discursive condition for the “novel” construct, such that
the latter circles back to the discourse or discourses embodied in the technology
which is deemed to be the “condition” for the projected possible technology. AI
meets  AI,  mediated  by  the  metaphysical  subject  with  an  AI  vision  which  has
constructed the “earlier” AI technology as a condition for the “future” AI. The
individual,  mediating  subject  is  not  a  located  representation  of  a  broader
“scientific”  tradition;  she  views  such  a  tradition  in  and  with  the  same
metaphysical constructs as the tradition “sees” her. She is as much an embodiment
of AI as all the AIs she correlates. She is a repetition of the modern, metaphysical
subject who views the world in terms of an artificial intelligence constructed by
her and imposed on the environment as a discursive power.
The issues are by now quite complex, and their resolution by those who argue
against  phenomenology  takes  recourse  to  a  pedagogical  thesis.  This  thesis
purports to explain the conditions for the possibility of the individual’s awareness
of proper, concrete activities. It is said that an activity makes sense, is meaningful
and proper, because of the teaching of customs, concepts, orientations to the next
generation. Granted. But pedagogy is what here becomes problematic, since it too
must  presume  the  priority  of  history  that  far  surpasses  the  abilities  of  any
pedagogical undertaking, and indeed the pedagogical practice would have to make
sense only under the dictates of the historically transmitted meanings and rules.
Hence, the very practice of pedagogy is one mode of individuating the common

178   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
meanings, one variety of interpretation that cannot claim to be in a position of
transmitting history per se. Moreover, even if we were to grant that the historical
meanings,  customs  and  institutions  contain  learned  generalizations  from
individual  cases,  we  would  have  a  reversed  problem:  Now,  we  would  have
general rules or concepts and meanings of individual cases abstracted from their
contexts. Yet, it is precisely the context-boundedness that is being advocated by
the historical, anti-phenomenological thesis. The only way that such a thesis could
escape  this  dilemma  is  by  assuming  the  generality  of  contexts  and  thus  by
abolishing  any  claim  to  concreteness.  This  is  to  say,  if  one  is  compelled  to
generalize the contexts, then one is simply postponing the issue of concreteness
and specification. It is precisely the efforts to avoid the transcendental, consisting
of awareness accessible to anyone—even if never completely—that lead to such
dilemmas.
Yet, even if we assume that communication is possible on the basis of historically
achieved intersubjectivity, with its mutual and universal understanding, we would
not be closer to answering the question of such a universality in understanding. In
what ways could history contain some type of commonality and universality when
the proponents consistently claim that all abstract and universal conceptions must
be  derived  from,  and  reinterpreted  back  in  terms  of  the  concrete  historical
contexts?  This  seems  to  be  an  admission  that  a  historical  process  consists  of
contingent events, unless, of course, one has granted tacitly the transcendental
generality of experience accessible to everyone, in the case of AI, a metaphysical
mode  of  awareness.  The  sly  move  of  the  historical  theses  appears  obvious:
Assume  the  generality  of  the  transcendental  awareness,  as  depicted  above  at
various  levels,  the  primary  of  which  became  mathematics,  reduce  it  to  the
property of a particular, factual being, and then argue that individuals cannot yield
commonalities of meaning accessible to others without the props of historically
effective consciousness.
The  dilemma  of  historically  effective  consciousness,  with  its  claims  of
intersubjective access, is that it is particular, perhaps having no two situations
alike, and thus it must import generalities from an experiential domain in order
then to discover them in such a historical consciousness. If it is claimed that the
historical  subjects  are  contingent,  and  particular,  then  the  question  as  to  the
possibility of comprehending the historically transmitted generalities cannot be
answered. Neither such a factual subject, nor even an intersubjectivity of such
subjects, could presume to grasp more than they are, unless, in fact, they are more,
i.e., experiencing subjects that are related to, and engaged in, a transcendental
generality prior to any factual singularity or generalized universality. No doubt,
there  is  a  historically  transmitted  knowledge  and,  as  we  noted  above,  a  poly-
centric, corporeal subject, but the conditions of the possibility of awareness of this

The Multi-Discursive Subject
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   179
transmitted  knowledge  are  not  necessarily  historical.  Historical  experience
presumes the transcendental in order to make sense of its ability to locate and
transmit the universal. Indeed, the very arguments for the priority of historical
traditions and intersubjectivity are transcendental.
Our arguments against the priority of intersubjectivity are not designed to reject it,
but  to  show  that  the  historical  base  for  intersubjectivity  leads  to  blind  alleys.
There appears to be a tacit assumption that the individual is contingent and totally
incapacitated without the intersubjective, i.e., the individual is contingent, while
the intersubjective is a necessary condition for the former. But the necessity of
intersubjectivity, as something above the individual, implies that the former is not
historical, but transcendental and thus requires transcendental subjectivity for its
access.  In  turn,  if  intersubjectivity  is  seen  as  a  historical  accumulation  and
transmission of accumulated practical and epistemic views, then such a history
could  not  offer  any  general  conceptions  under  which  the  individual  could  be
subsumed.  Communication  is  an  accepted  occurrence;  this  implies  that
intersubjectivity cannot be an aggregate of either contingent, totally time-bound,
factual individuals, with their specific psychosomatic functions. On this basis,
intersubjectivity  is  precluded  at  the  outset.  Indeed,  the  contingency  of  history
would  be  exposed  to  the  same  charge.  Resultantly,  the  possibility  of
intersubjectivity can be maintained if it is taken at the outset to be transcendental,
offering  access  to  eidetic  generality  that  subtends  both  the  factual  and  the
universalities and is accessible to any subjectivity. This conclusion is revealed
even  by  those  who  argue  against  phenomenology.  When  one  claims  that  all
subjectivity is within the horizon of historical intersubjectivity, the claim has an
eidetic generality as a basis for communicative understanding. This is to say; such
claims are transcendental and thus accessible intersubjectively by all.
There is still another dilemma for scientific communication. Assume that there are
traditionally pregiven and learned rules of language, in our case mathematics,
present  in  their  intersubjective  universality,  and  then  applied  interpretively  to
situations. The communicating individuals, using such language, do not somehow
discard it and its rules, meanings, and concepts during application. Even if one
had a dual language—and there is no indication of this being the case—one with
traditionally acquired intersubjective rules, and one that is spoken situationally,
the latter would turn out to be equally historical, traditional, with its general rules
and usages, calling for specific interpretation during application. Hence, the issue
of concrete, situational specification is not resolved but merely postponed. Any
linguistic usage, its rules, prejudgments, takes for granted a general understanding
of  the  meaning  of  situation,  context,  and  concrete  action  in  order  to  speak  of
concrete  specification  of  communicative  practice.  But  this  implies  that  if  the
historical and intersubjectively understood language does not have within itself

180   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
the requisite concreteness and specificity, then the latter is presupposed and must
originate from another source. After all, the transmitted language can be specified
concretely, not in any arbitrary way, but selectively. The selection presupposes
that we already understand the concrete situation, the context wherein to order the
specifications  of  a  language  properly.  The  proper  ordering  depends  on  the
experience of concrete domains that are not simply cases of traditional categories
and rules, but systems of factual experience founded on situated and significantly
interconnected corporeal functions. We shall discuss the latter in the next section.
Historical intersubjectivity is not something which imposes itself on an individual
awareness but, as mentioned in the case of AI, a dialogical extension and variation
of  any  awareness,  comprising  a  transcendental,  poly-logical  field  in  depth.  In
principle, each text we read contains eidetic generalities which “mean” the things
and events in a specific framework. We speak of numerous social structures, from
monarchy  through  plutocracy  to  democracy,  and  regard  them  in  the  mode  of
awareness as “justice”. The latter is a general “eidetic” invariant which limits the
investigation of all societies to this mode. And it invites anyone to look at any
society in our own times with respect to justice and indeed, invites us to challenge
this explication of such societies by introducing variants which might contest this
mode of awareness. Our awareness of this “position”, our dialogue with this mode
of awareness, is not an imposition on us of a historical intersubjectivity, but a
mutual extension of awareness at the transcendental level. This mode signifies
societies, means them in a specific way, inviting us to look at them in that way
irrespective of the question of whether Plato was a Greek, just like it would be
irrespective  of  whether  Pythagoras  was  Greek  as  an  explanation  for  the
Pythagorean  Theorem.
AI extends our mode of looking at the world mathematically, and, as mentioned,
more  efficiently,  faster,  more  precisely.  This  is  not  a  “replacement”  for  our
awareness, just as Plato’s awareness of justice was a replacement instead of a
polycentric  extension  of  our  awareness.  On  the  contrary,  AI  requires  our
transcendental  awareness,  since  it  cannot  “mean”  or  “signify”  the  things  it
calculates—it  gives  us  numbers,  and  numbers  are  not  found  anywhere  and
anytime; they do not have a signifying direction, such as “the message on the
screen is from a friend in Tokyo”. It simply puts up a number of letters on the
screen, just as it puts up a number of letters in the message. The AI does not say
what  those  letters  mean,  speak  about;  they  do  not  mean  anything  beyond
themselves. When AI gives numbers of stocks, shares, quantities of production
hours, even quantities of products, it does not know that such quantities mean
anything beyond themselves. When an astronomer gets numbers of light years
from Andromeda, numbers of seconds “after” the Big Bang, those numbers, by
themselves, are numbers on the screen, calculated with dramatic efficiency and

A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   181
speed, but without understanding their meaning “after”. The numbers have no
temporal direction. It is the transcendental awareness that reads those numbers as
signifying “past” and “future” signifying directions such as an “expansion” of the
galaxies from “then until now” and from “there to here”. The AI will print the
letters by the numbers, but numbers do not signify positions and directions; they
are  spaceless  and  timeless,  and  it  takes  “time-space”  awareness  to  allow  the
numbers to “mean” or signify something. And such signifying leads to the lived
world. Meaning is “directional”—where something points to something else. Like
language points to things, mathematics points to quantified objects, religious texts
point  to  the  world  of  images,  and  all  comprise  a  world  of  “meaning
interconnections”  which  we  shall  call  signitive.
The  signitive  logic  that  pervades  the  life-world,  with  the  latter’s  valuative
selectivities, is also in the background of the cybernetic revolution. This is to say,
while the cybernetic revolution brought in computer science, it has at the same
time included as a background the self-generating process of formal systems that
are translated and reified into the technical environment. The computerized logic
as  formal  has  no  regard  to  anything  that  is  environmentally,  qualitatively
differentiated.  Its  own  logic  does  not  need  to  respect  the  so-called  “natural-
qualitative” differentiations. Any living, working, suffering being in this logic of
indifference  that  transcends  such  a  being  can  regard  all  events  in  terms  of
mutually replaceable variants. Social, economic, pedagogical, cultic, and cultural
givens  are,  in  this  logic,  equivalences  in  normative  exchanges.  Whether
something  is  labor  power,  artwork,  or  mysticism,  it  must  subject  itself  to  the
requirements of the formal rules of quantification. The latter, the quantification,
must  become  the  information  to  be  transmitted  globally.  While  previously,
televisual  globalization  was  available,  and  this  globalization  depended  on
valuative  selectivity  of  large  media  organizations,  computerized  globalization
offers arbitrary access to any selectivity. This means that rhetorical propositions,
as translatable into practices, will be equivalent to other propositions. No external
judgment  is  possible  apart  from  an  appeal  to  other  computerized  information,
whose credibility is simply the appearance in the global network. Computerization
opens up a domain of any space and any time accessed without history, without
places, and without times. It is a synchronic instrument premised on signification
that is everywhere and yet not localizable. The age of the computer is a world of
signification where there is no place and time and, conversely, where all places
and all times are equivalently accessible. Our task is to explore the domain of all
places and times.

SIGNITIVE SPACE-TIME
Any scientist, for example, an astronomer, gets images from the Hubble telescope
which “tell” the scientist that the visible galaxies, in a specific “region of the sky”,
are six billion light years “from here to there” signifying how they looked “in the
past”. In addition, the scientist will announce that “this cluster” (recall a “group”
as a mode of awareness) is “closer” than the “cluster to the right”. Let us call it
the Hubble telescope AI. What it gives the scientist are numbers and empirical
images, which the AI can count and deploy on the screen, but the space-time, and
distance in-depth, require transcendental awareness, which makes sense of the
“data”  supplied  by  the  AI  in  numbers  and  images.  Obviously,  the  Hubble
telescope as AI is a complex thing, as are our retinas, and “extends our vision”,
becoming a “dialogical partner” yet the signitive deployment of its vision consists
of our intersubjective transcendental awareness. Why intersubjective? Because the
scientist is aware of the awareness of Newton, extended by Einstein, Hubble, and
various astronomers, and all of them are accessible to anyone at the transcendental
level. One need not know Newton’s personal life to acquire an awareness of the
mathematics of gravity. The same goes for Einstein and others.
When someone reads the computer messages, that someone does not question the
presence  of  such  messages,  despite  the  empirical  fact  that  those  messages
originated ten thousand miles away, and that all we have empirically are marks on
the screen. The empirical components become transparent and assume a meaning
which  signifies,  “intends”  something,  and  it  does  so  with  the  transcendental
awareness of space-time directions. This must be emphasized: One gets a message
with a date and time and distance of origin. All one has are numbers, but the
numbers for the receiver turn to signifiers for an awareness which reads them as a
message from “then and there”—as a specific signitive space-time awareness.
This should be made clear: The space-time-movement mode of awareness is the
way that things, events, and even our own place are deployed. We could say that
such awareness is “cosmic” to the extent to which we speak of the “Big Bang”,
which happened some 13 billion years ago, and we expect in the next ten years to
gather data closest to the time of the Big Bang. We are not empirically present to
this Bang, but we are already in the signitive space-time-movement awareness
necessary for the location of events, emergent matter, forming galaxies, and stars
with proto-planets.
The reading of the AI message is prior to and pervades the empirical means that
transmit the message. Any AI, from computer to robotics to space telescope such
as the Hubble, as technological means, is overlooked in favor of what it says
about something, “intending” something, what mode of awareness it incorporates,
and  what  transcendental  space-time-movement  awareness  deploys  what  the

The Multi-Discursive Subject
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   183
message states. This would be analogous to the construction of non-Euclidean
space. The latter has no empirically given intuitive component. It is a pure system
of formal constructs that do not point to any material, mental, or other “realistic
factors”.
Given  the  non-positional  mode  of  awareness  incorporated  in  any  “smart
technology” including AI, then, in principle, it is possible to select and transmit
the sense of any event as if it were immediately present to anyone. What is at
issue is the process of selectivity that is not implied by the mode of awareness and
by the empirical events such awareness “intends”. Here we encounter the question
of  selectivity  as  valuation.  Among  numerous  events  signified  in  a  life-world,
some are regarded as important and valuable. At this level, valuation does not
have  any  rules  which  could  be  derived  from  either  domain,  the  formal  and
quantitative, or the technically constructed events of the life-world. The point we
have reached is the previously mentioned requirement of connecting logic with
fact, mathematics with data, and sense-making with events. Since the systems of
signification are constituted at will, they themselves do not imply which of them
are relevant to the social, economic, pedagogical, and cultural aspects of a life-
world.
Resultantly,  the  very  constitution  of  signitive  systems  requires  a  valuative
criterion  which  would  say:
1. What formal-mathematical systems among all possibilities should be applied to
what aspects and events; and,
2. The criteria for the constitution of specific formal-mathematical systems must
be part of a society, a political society, political economy, or political economical
ideology, which would provide a clue concerning what is relevant among possible
systems.
In fact, the very construction of AI technology based on mathematical awareness,
is a technology that embodies valuation. This is to say, we elect to build this
instead  of  another  technology.  This  is  simply  to  remind  us  that  technology
embodies  valuative  conditions,  and  therefore  it  cannot  be  regarded  as  a  mere
neutral empirical implement.
CONCLUSION
What  is  appropriate  to  the  theme  of  the  technical  means  which  embody  the
mathematical  mode  of  awareness  and  its  valuative  subtext  is  that  it  can  be
produced and set up anywhere and anytime around the world. This globalizing
transference of technology brings with it non-positional access to global events as

184   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence

if  they  were  present.  This  can  be  noted  in  the  change  of  language  from
“representation” to “presence”. A normal daily discussion seems obvious: “Have
you  seen  the  hurricane  in  Bermuda?”  As  if  the  medium—television—and  its
images have vanished, and the “thing in itself” has become present. From this, we
can only suggest how mass media obtains a rhetorical power; every image is “the
thing” and carries the presence of “the ways things are”. We have the origin for
“Media is the message” invented by a modern, metaphysical subject—an AI.

CHAPTER 10
The Limits of Artificial Intelligence and the Public
Abstract:  Contrasting  the  phenomenological  perspective  with  that  presented  by
Enlightenment thinking and its particular valuative structure, Chapter 10 delineates
some of the often-overlooked, negative effects of artificial intelligence on the general
populace.  We  review  a  variety  of  philosophical  perspectives  that  treat  the
underpinnings of Enlightenment thinking, leading to a discussion of the legitimation
crisis and its negative effects on democracy. The discussion then turns to a detailed
discussion of the practical and theoretical implications of apprehending time from a
phenomenological perspective as related to artificial intelligence. The final section of
the  chapter  is  devoted  to  a  critique  of  artificial  intelligence,  highlighting  the
significance of instrumental reason and the notion of “progress”, and focusing on the
discursive power inherent in inventions that leverage AI.
Keywords:  Contingency,  Enlightenment,  Horizon,  Instrumentality,  Logic,
Legitimation  Crisis,  Public,  Things,  Understanding.
INTRODUCTION
In  previous  chapters,  we  have  disclosed  the  multiple  features  of  the  modern
Western world: ontology—the fundamental nature of all things; metaphysics, the
principal mode of explaining the world; the appearance of the modern subject; the
technological—instrumental essence of progress; and the oriented world of praxis
based on bodily activities. We also touched upon the modern conception of a
temporal horizon of possibilities and their complex relationships. We can even
point out that modern time, at the basic level, is an attempt to solve the question
of  transcendence  of  the  traditional  “now  point”  as  a  constant  presence  of  the
universe, such that the past is no longer, and the future is not yet. With the notion
of  “projection”  of  possibilities,  we  have  a  future  horizon  from  which  we  can
select a variety of “possible futures”. Such projections are regarded as the basic
mode of awareness which allows many twentieth-century thinkers, such as Sartre,
to speak of absolute freedom. We are always transcending the present toward the
possibilities in terms of which we judge the present state of affairs: economic,
psychological, and social. Future as “not yet” has no reality and thus is nothing,
although it is this nothing that judges what is missing at present. What we know
of the universe is the way humans, as the place between things and the  possibility

of their temporal horizon, select and interpret what such things can be. Of course,
such awareness is premised on the modern dualism of subject and object; the
former is mind, and the latter is matter. First, the subject is the unconditional
source of all theories and values, while the material world is an irrational and
valueless sum of homogeneous matter to be constructed in terms of the subject’s
theories,  methods,  and  values.  Second,  the  subject  is  the  unconditionally
autonomous source of all laws in both the social and material realms. Since there
is no other criterion concerning the material and social worlds, then all subjects
are  equal  concerning  the  way  that  the  material  and  social  worlds  are  to  be
constructed. Third, construction is unconditional to the extent that no causes can
be assigned to the structures and procedures by which the subject interprets and
shapes itself, social relationships, and the material environment. In the language
of Enlightenment, all are projections of human autonomy. Various terms have
been used for projection: objectification, alienation, humanization, and even self-
realization. It is important to note that the term “projection” is basic to political
and scientific enlightenments.
ENLIGHTENMENTS
Political and scientific enlightenments posit the subject as an autonomous center
of the public domain and all public rules and appointments of governing entities.
The  public  domain  of  autonomous  subjects  is  strictly  distinguished  from  the
private-social domain of needs, wants, desires, and their fulfillment. If the latter
entered the public domain, it would abolish autonomy and equality. Scientific
Enlightenment  posits  the  subject  as  a  rational  bearer  of  theoretical  and
methodological constructs by which to manage the material environment in terms
of projected human “needs”. The latter is to be understood either biologically or
psychologically  and  thus  can  be  satisfied  by  the  scientific  invention  of
“techniques” of fulfillment leading to what is known as the reduction of scientific
reason to instrumentality. Next is the invention of history and its progress toward
a utopian society; the latter assumed various interpretations, yet common to all is
the notion that humans can construct material and psychological settings wherein
all previous ills would be abolished. It is obvious that this utopian notion, as “the
aim and end of history”, is a mixture of political and scientific enlightenments. In
addition, the reason that this mixture had to be posited as a future aim is that
political  and  scientific  enlightenments  became  incompatible;  the  scientific
Enlightenment, and its promise to fulfill material and psychological wants, had to
abolish the interpretation of human life as autonomous, unconditional, and self-
creative.  At  this  juncture,  the  significance  of  AI  becomes  obvious:  While  it
subjects humans to function more technically and narrowly, it also “liberates”
humanity  from  many  burdens,  such  as  manual  assembly  labor  or  the  slow
calculations at numerous enterprises—cash registers for one. In turn, humans, at

Limits of Artificial Intelligence
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   187
these levels, need not be educated since all they need to know are the simple
functions—which icon to press—and the rest of the “intelligence” is performed by
AI.
Meanwhile,  the  first  requirement  and  interpretation  of  human  life  became  the
material and psychological sum of wants and their immediate gratification. As we
know, the current reading of life and experience is regarded as a multiplicity of
intensive pleasure nodes, each clamoring to be tickled, and gratified, in order that
new  pleasure  nodes  could  pop  up  for  more  gratification.  Utilitarianism  is  the
general ethical position wherein all things and humans have value to the extent
that they produce pleasure. The second requirement is the massive technology and
its progress, designed for the constant fulfillment and constant invention of needs.
The conjunction of these factors results in the abolition of a historical aim and its
replacement by progress for the sake of progress. This is obvious from the essence
of instrumental rationality. Third, the notion of autonomy, the view of the subject
as self-creative, had to be postponed and forever deferred, and also regarded as
scientifically irrelevant and contradictory. It is impossible to claim that, once the
material and psychological conditions are fully established, they will cause the
human subject to be autonomous. As we know at the outset, autonomy cannot be
caused. As just noted, this is equally problematic due to progress that can never
reach any end and hence establish all the necessary conditions for the emergence
of autonomy. Every new condition, as a result of instrumental reason, becomes a
means for new conditions and new needs, and the latter split up into more novel
needs. In this sense, it is impossible to fulfill all human needs and then establish
autonomy.  Fourth,  we  are  left  with  a  democracy  whose  principle  of  human
autonomy  and  the  public  domain,  wherein  such  autonomy  is  maintained  and
exercised, is no longer available. It has been completely pervaded by instrumental
rationality  and  the  proliferation  of  needs  and  their  fulfillment.  Hence,  the
members of a political and democratic community are reduced to material life,
psychological titillations, and the chemical prolongation of boredom. Most likely,
we are in ancient Rome, where the public will worship any emperor who provides
bread and circuses.
It is now possible to turn to the essence of the life-world of Enlightenment: It is a
process of valuation. Everything in the universe assumes a value to the extent that
it serves our interests, i.e., fulfills our needs and, in the fulfillment, creates new
needs, requiring the selection of material events which become valuable for the
fulfillment of such needs. Contrary to claims that the world has no value, the
world constructed by Enlightenment is full of values: the labor theory of value
(accepted and expounded by capitalists and communists), values for sale, values
produced and to be produced, values of stocks and bonds, values of education,
family values, religious values, ideologically constructed values, the changing and

188   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
the new values, the value of life and even calculated death, social values, and
persons are judged as to their value in all of these settings. Indeed, the basic mode
of awareness is valuative selectivity. It should be clear also that awareness and
perception are no longer given in some innocent, pure empirical sense, but are
selected on the grounds of valuation. What is given as a plethora of empirical
environments is, for the most part, ignored. What is perceived depends on its
specific value. Indeed, there are social mechanisms that not only consist of values,
but also the evaluation of values that select specific ones deemed relevant in terms
of future value projects. It has been argued that all these values are human, and
hence the primacy is placed on the modern subject as the source of values. This
claim would hold if human were a distinct and decisive category, wherein all
other categories and processes were subservient to humans. But this is no longer
the case since other values, such as technologies of various sorts, from electronic
media  to  genetic  biochemistry,  compel  the  understanding  of  the  human  to  be
equivalent to the rest of the values. This means that genetic biochemistry will not
treat human as a special category, but it will have to reduce all human functions to
biochemistry. Thus, the environment, which is constructed on the basis of the
process of technical valuation and is deemed to be objective, requires that the
human  be  treated  equally  objectively  in  terms  of  what  such  an  environment
demands, i.e., an interpretation of the human as material, chemical, biological,
physical entity in order that such constructed technical values could be applied
and  thus  be  useful  and  valuable.  The  recent  theologian,  Emmanuel  Levinas
(1991),  is  a  fine  example  of  this  modern  trend,  lending  values  an  ontological
priority over being-reality.
We  are  now  in  a  position  to  extricate  the  fundamental  intentionality  that
constitutes  this  life-world.  To  have  some  sense  of  this  intentionality,  it  is
necessary to explicate the directly lived awareness that could not be posited as an
object by the thinkers of Enlightenment. It ought to be understood that such a
lived awareness is transcendental and hence accessible only reflectively from the
meant objects that such a lived awareness intends. What, then, are these objects?
While the process of valuation of events in favor of human “needs” was briefly
indicated, i.e., various reductionisms of the human to biochemistry, genetics, and
mechanics,  the  lived  awareness  subtending  this  process  intends  an  objectivity
which is unique to Enlightenment. One level of this objectivity is designed to be
accessible  to  quantification,  and  hence  it  has  to  be  measurable  homogeneous
matter.  This  design,  of  course,  is  meant  by  a  specific  exclusion  of  the  entire
perceived world and hence in no wise accessible to experience. Yet covered by
this  homogeneous  materiality  as  an  intentional  object  is  another  intended
objectivity:  temporal  possibility.

A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   189
The lived awareness that intends such an objectivity is an empty will, prior to the
question of its being free or determined. Phenomenologically speaking, there can
be  eternal  possibilities,  but  such  possibilities  have  already  been  enacted
theologically  and  in  part  metaphysically.  Enlightenment  rejects  eternal
possibilities and is left with temporal, although being projected, they are empty
temporal possibilities. It is to be noted that the term “temporal” does not suggest
“being  in  time”,  but  an  open  horizon  without  any  specific  ontological  locus.
Hence, any temporal location would have to be established within such a horizon.
If  we  attend  to  the  language  of  Enlightenment  up  to  date,  we  shall  note  that,
subtending  the  question  of  “reality”,  there  is  a  prior  discourse  concerning  the
“conditions for the possibility of reality”. Such discourses are premised on the
first  lived  intentionality  of  empty  temporal  possibility.  It  opens  a  horizon  of
possible  intentions  and  their  fulfillment,  requiring  a  second  constitution  of
objectivities: possible valuations of what the will intends as valuable for us, but
recalling that at this level, all value possibilities are open as temporal. In principle,
it  is  possible  for  us  to  be  all  that  we  will  as  valuable  in  time.  This  is
Enlightenment’s alpha and omega: empty temporal possibility and its temporal
fulfillment by all that we value as our mode of final being. Both Marxism and
capitalism offer the same intentionality. The intentionality of the fulfillment of
possible valuations as temporal does not lead to perceptual awareness, since the
latter,  in  its  immediate  mode,  is  quite  limited  and  merely  qualitative.  Hence,
fulfillment  requires  constructive  intentionality  that  can  establish  possible
conditions for possible reality. One minor aspect for this establishment is the shift
of  reason  to  instrumental  rationality  whose  task  is  to  calculate  what  reality  is
valuable  for  us  and  then  calculate  the  conditions  how  such  reality  shall  be
achieved. Values, in this sense, are calculations of possible results realized solely
as material. To achieve any value, the human has to be reduced to a system of
interests, needs, desires, power, and all must act aggressively against others to
fulfill  such  wants.  Indeed,  language  itself  is  split  into  numerous  technical
discourses.
The issue of temporal value possibilities is the driving force of Enlightenment at
this level. A transcendent or eternal possibility is abolished; hence, temporality is
the pressure that demands a prolongation of our temporal existence. There is no
other option; being temporal, we want to live as long as possible and hence the
frantic rush for the latest technologies that promise to protract our lives. Such
technologies have become equivalent to the value of life and death. The public
domain is an arena for the struggle for life itself, and any means can be used,
whether lying, killing, or wars; all will do as well, as long as they promise to keep
us  safe,  and  ensure  our  continuity  at  any  price.  All  the  changing  technical
inventions  promote  other  inventions  as  values  of  life:  We  want  to  go  on.  The
transcendental  rule  of  Enlightenment  at  this  level  is  changed  as  permanence

enhancement. Thus, the political shift to dramatic conservativism. The latter is a
promise, by whatever means, to guarantee our security, safety, protection and
continuity,  as  long  as  we  surrender  our  freedoms  to  participate  in  the  public
domain and to engage in public dialogue. In other words, the public domain, as
the condition for other democratic institutions, is no longer maintained, despite
all  the  rhetoric  about  democracy  and  its  “values”.  The  intentionality  of
Enlightenment has worked itself out to reveal its truth two centuries later. Indeed,
we are living this intentionality as an awareness of our life-world in such a way
that, while speaking of democracy, rights, equality and freedoms, we intend such
a world as a struggle for temporal and technical continuity. Thus, all is valuable
that enhances this continuity—and purely materially. What subtends this model is
a radical transformation of time awareness: field-horizon.
The various major critiques of Enlightenment, from Adorno through Heidegger,
Habermas,  Derrida,  and  Levinas,  to  Deleuze  and  Guattari,  fall  within  the
parameters  of  some  variant  of  Enlightenment,  whether  it  is  rationalism,
psychologism, sociologism, economism, or even biologism, and above all, plain
pragmatism. It is no accident that such notables as Heidegger (1962) and Sartre
(1956) have a pervasive notion of humans as always being ahead of themselves.
In the just-mentioned work, Heidegger claims that we are a projection of future
possibilities as a horizon where Being itself is disclosed in its temporality. All the
mystifications and obfuscations by Heideggerians skip over the modern ground of
his quest for Being: The very world we live in is interpreted technically. The
environment for Heidegger is a priori a value function, expressed in his concept
of  “in  order  to”.  Priority  is  given  to  things  which  are  “in  hand”  such  that  a
hammer is not a thing but an extension of our activity in order to pound a nail into
a board, and the latter is a board for a wall, a wall is for a house …. and the entire
region opens up. In the world of “circumspection”, everything is a value as a
function “in order to…”. If we listen to Sartre, we get the same story: awareness
always transcends the present, and by the time I tell someone who I am, I am no
longer  who  I  am;  I  have  transcended  the  present  moment.  This  constant
transcendence toward the future possibilities is also a feature of selectivity of the
past  as  to  its  relevance  for  the  future.  Thus,  any  critique  of  a  social  system
concerning its inadequacies, includes the possibilities of what the society lacks.
The possibility is not yet real, and the lack it reveals is also not real, i.e., precisely
because  something  is  missing.  This  is  precisely  one  main  aspect  of  Western
modernity—past is gone, and we constantly “will” new projects as our future to
be fulfilled with technically produced commodities or new technologies. The very
shape of ceaseless progress is premised on the will projecting what we want, and
then establishing the conditions to achieve what we want—a lack, and once the
want is achieved, it becomes the means or conditions to fulfill more projected
wants. While Heidegger was shouting against technology, his romance with Being

survives in the modern technological time and the modern metaphysics of the
will. But what does such metaphysics have to do with AI? The very short answer:
It involves what is known as “modal” logic, which is a formal attempt to account
for “possibilities”. Progress is a given, and even instrumental reason is constantly
improving, but with the preeminence in all areas of AI, progress and its upward-
inclined  time  arrow  is  much  too  crude  a  metaphor.  After  all,  various  AI
technologies calculate not only the future, but possibilities in possibilities, which
in their mathematical forms are not images or signs of temporal directions, even if
scientists invoke time and even space, such as “from here to there”, and “from
there to there”, and, of course, from “now until then” and from “then until then”.
Any  quantifiable  measure  could  fit  within  these  dimensions  of  awareness,  no
matter how fragmented or extended.
The  modal  logic  involves  not  only  technical  valuations,  but  the  public  arena
which, by now, is not interested in such questions as human rights, autonomy, and
activities  of  public  officials,  but  what  such  officials  promise  to  deliver  in  the
sphere of material values. This context results in the question of “legitimation”.
The  point  is  that  the  organizational  principle  of  socio-political  life  has  been
drastically altered. The distinction between the private and the public has been
obliterated. The non-political relationships, in the economic sphere, for example,
have  become  political,  where  private  economic  achievements  are  distributed
socially vis-à-vis the political or public functions. This is the reason, or at least
one of the reasons, for the confidence crisis. The population no longer votes for a
public platform, but for a private platform that promises to fulfill private needs by
way of distributing privately acquired social wealth and benefits. If the platform
tends to favor one private segment over the other, then the vote is split along the
lines of who falls within the favored and who falls outside the favored private
interests. The crisis reaches a culminating point when the political functionaries
cannot carry out the promises to fulfill the private demands of a particular group.
There are created expectations in this fulfillment by the public, and when the
fulfillment cannot be attained, the public sees that its vote is “irrelevant”, and that
its participation in the public affairs “makes no difference”. This is indeed ironic,
because the public has accepted the notion that the public sphere must somehow
participate in the private sphere. The main demand and the promise by yet-to-be
or already-elected officials is “jobs”. “Vote for me, and I will bring jobs”. By
requesting  the  fulfillment  of  private  welfare,  the  public  invites  the  political
domain to intervene in the private domain and thus obliterates the differentiation
between the public and the private spheres.
This is laden with the questions of legitimation and its crises. This is obvious
when governmental planning cannot steer the private segment to fulfill all private
interests and accommodate all the conflicting private demands. In this case, some

192   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
segments of population will be opposed to the governmental functions and will
see them as illegitimate. What is suggested here is that the governmental intrusion
into the private domain and the obliteration of the distinction between the private
and the public leads to the legitimation crisis. In turn, the public’s demand for
governmental  solutions  to  private  problems  leads  to  the  same  crisis  of  the
privatization of the public sphere and hence to dissatisfaction when the public
sphere cannot solve all private problems.
Another factor in the legitimation crisis, as would be perceived by the population,
is the loss of confidence in the conception of fair exchange. There is an awareness
that the distribution of wealth and welfare depends on governmental policies and
the political negotiations which mediate among various private interest groups. It
is known that in the private sphere, the basic motive is profit and hence setting
goals in terms of maximizing profit. Since governmental interference distributes
public  wealth  and  welfare  in  accordance  with  interest  groups,  the  productive
interests,  such  as  corporations,  while  receiving  public  funds,  are  perceived  as
receiving an illegitimate dole for maximizing private profit from the public funds.
Hence, they maximize profit not only on the basis of market, but also on the basis
of governmental favors. Since the public perceives these favors as stemming from
the public domain, it views the governmental action as illegitimate; after all, such
an action “makes the rich richer”. Since the public does not wish to legitimate the
private  appropriation  of  the  public’s  wealth,  and  since  the  political  party  is
nonetheless involved in the distribution of the public’s wealth to private interest
groups,  then  the  population  concludes  that  its  input  in  public  affairs  is
meaningless,  powerless,  and  ultimately  irrelevant.
After all, formal democracy is designed to ensure the independence of the public
sphere from private interests, and yet the governmental functions, by politicizing
private  interests,  changing  the  substance  of  formal  democracies.  In  turn,  as
paradoxical as this may seem, the formal democracy is depoliticized, insofar as
the voter is concerned. The elected functionaries in the public sphere use their
political functions to favor and sanction private economic processes and either the
accumulation of profits by one group or the use of public funds for the undeserved
welfare of another group. And in turn, paradoxically, while the public demands of
the officials that they engage only in the public-political sphere, it depoliticizes
the public sphere by demanding that it fulfill the needs of private welfare. In both
cases, the public sphere is obliterated, and the meetings dealing with public affairs
are attended only by those whose immediate private interests are affected. The
public’s  participation  in  the  public’s  affairs  is  no  longer  public.  The  result  is
political “privatism”.

The increased activity of the state produces an expanded need for legitimation, for
justification of governmental intrusion in the private sphere. At the same time, the
process of administrative planning produces the unintended effect of undermining
the traditional procedures of legitimation. What this means is that, by planning
“public  programs”  such  as  family  and  health,  the  government  publicizes  the
private domain by offering technological solutions to questions that were once
settled by traditional ethics and norms functioning in the private sphere. Thus, the
state tends to politicize domains that were once private and depended on private
norms. Yet, this politicization is merely an appearance. The public, having been
offered the “programs” for health, housing, family planning, technical training,
and above all, jobs, depoliticizes the public sphere and makes it into “private”
rights to have “public” health, housing, education, jobs, security, and so on. The
end effect is the disruption of private norms of social action and their replacement
by bureaucratic procedures which depend on political parties and their ideologies.
The only demands that the public tends to place on governmental officials is the
fulfillment of private or even personal demands. This is where we meet the power
of AI. It can be used to calculate the possibilities for value selectivity, equivalent
to which values can or must be fulfilled. It is obvious that, with the distinction
between private and public abolished, the value selectivity will be in favor of the
material interests of those who can afford to have their interests prevail.
Given the absorption of the public-political domain into the private-social, there is
a  constant  struggle  among  groups  whose  interests  take  priority.  Here,  the  AI
becomes a “judge” since it can and does monitor people’s “wants” or “views” and
their  statistical  distribution,  telling  the  ruling  members  of  any  society  how  to
“please” its members. Remember, the modern ethics of pleasure rules the day, and
if a majority is pleased, then the ruling members are applauded and cheered. Most
Chinese  people  are  very  happy  and  proud  of  the  success  of  their  leaders  in
providing jobs and the psychological euphoria of the greatness of China, and they
are in no wise concerned with the mass mistreatment of minorities. Meanwhile,
AI has become an instrument to enter and read every citizen’s AI systems, from
computers  to  smartphones,  and  thus  monitor  for  unacceptable  views.  Such
monitoring blocks any critical voices and free speech—not only blocks, but also
cancels programs from “decadent” media from abroad “for the maintenance of
public order”. While China is preeminent as the “model society”, others are not
far behind. Iran has imported China’s “great firewall” to monitor its citizens and
block foreign systems. But even the “free enterprise societies” have abandoned
the  public  domain  and  are  pervaded  by  AI  systems  which  “see”  what  people
watch, buy, use, and where they travel, thus providing information for those in
charge of such systems so as to provide “bread and circuses” to please the masses.
In fact, the gathering of information is also a big business; the information is a
commodity  to  be  sold  and  thus  proliferated  and  enhanced  exponentially.  Of

194   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
course, such information is also available for the private rulers of societies—the
autocrats or theocrats, whose management of all social affairs has nothing to do
with “political societies”. As mentioned, the latter is abandoned for the sake of the
pleasure-creating values of the majority.
It is advisable to check the modal logic of how such value selectivity functions.
As noted, modern Western thought is more concerned with the conditions for the
possibility of... than with the immediate world of awareness or the facts within it.
The  latter  is  already  established  or  technically  realized,  embodied  and
materialized possibilities, and even calculated conditions for the achievement of
other  possibilities.  Such  conditions  for  the  possibility  have  abolished  any
semblance of one future aim—the utopian society, since there are as many futures
as the field horizon can bear—indeed, there are futures in futures, overlapping
with  other  futures,  leading  to  a  process  of  temporal  reflexivity,  where  any
possibility can be regarded as a positive presence. Everything must be understood
temporally as a process of socio-historical variations and even radical breaks. As
will  be  seen  subsequently,  such  a  temporalization  of  all  social  factors  toward
history introduces a concept of theory, which is no longer merely explanatory but,
above  all,  critical.  Any  reflexivity  presupposes  as  its  condition  the  distinction
between the real and the temporally possible, with the full awareness that the real
is also produced and contains vectors to become various means for constructing
various futures. Thus, a particular social history does not vary only in terms of the
presently given and selected facts, but also in terms of the constitutive conditions
of  selectivity  based  on  possibilities,  which  are  temporal.  The  insight  into  the
selectivity  of  facts  in  any  social  process  is  a  key  to  the  constitution  of  the
relationship  between  social  facts,  their  vectorial  structures,  and  the  temporal
horizons  or  possibilities.
The fundamental condition for possibility and the selectivity of facts within a
social process is temporality. This means that the condition for the possibility of
modern  social  system  as  a  process  is  a  modal  generalization  constituting  the
temporal  horizons—in  both  temporal  directions.  Given  the  brief  discussion  of
legitimation, we shall no longer speak of political society, since the latter has
become  a  society  with  clashing  interests  whose  adjudication  is  premised  on
power.  We  are  in  the  age  of  autocracies  and  group  antagonisms.  Such
antagonisms  can  be  in  a  constant  clash,  each  group  conniving  for  a  more
favorable future and thus constructing or acquiring AI with a greater vectorial
range of value selectivity in the field-horizon of possibilities. Thus, at the outset,
it must be obvious that it is too simplistic to assume a one-dimensional, linear
advancement of relationships between the complex interests of a social system
and its temporal horizons. The growth of more complex social systems does not
have  a  more  complex  history;  rather  on  the  basis  of  the  complexity,  they

Limits of Artificial Intelligence
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   195
neutralize history, illuminate it by differentiated selectivity and in many cases,
reject its lessons. When history becomes relevant in more complex societies, it
becomes at the same time more contingent; it becomes memory and forgetfulness,
detailed interest and indifferent neglect of a conquered past; all these coexisting
vectorial facts suggest future possibilities, and the latter, offering more diverse
selection  among  the  facts,  is  the  situation  which  leads  to  the  complexity  of
contemporary  society.
The temporal conditions for factual vectors to open possibilities and the way the
latter can transform the transformation of such facts, are quite complex, although
they can be managed by higher levels and broader rules which can encompass
various temporal levels. Modalized aspects can be again modalized under more
inclusive possibilities and wider horizons. One can discuss the possibilities of
reality  and  the  reality  of  possibilities  or  even  the  possibility  of  possibilities,
necessities, contingencies, and so on. The complexity of the temporal condition of
factual vectors and horizons of possibilities can be characterized in the following
way. There can be a present future which must be distinguished from the future
present,  even  if  only  on  the  grounds  that  the  present  future  contains  more
possibilities than is possible for future presents to become a reality. Such interplay
of  temporal  complexities,  specifically  when  different  disciplines  and  their
horizons of possibilities are also part of the complexities, cannot be managed by
the  clumsy  and  slow  functioning  “carbon-based  units”  AI  fills  the  gap.  The
banking and investment domain requires decisions to be made at fractions of a
second—otherwise, vast fortunes may be lost.
One  must  also  distinguish  between  future  presents,  present  presents,  and  past
presents, between the present of the past as history and the past present. If one
begins  with  the  two  temporal  horizons  of  the  present,  namely  past  and  future
which in each point can be seen as presents with their own pasts and futures with
further possibilities of reiteration, then one begins to constitute the conditions for
the possibility of all possible processes of temporal inclusion. This suggests that
the indefinite modalization of time horizons can be seen as temporal possibilities
of possibilities at indefinite times. The immediate future can be reflected by a
more  remote  future  and  both,  in  turn,  by  a  still  more  remote  and  perhaps
encompassing future, yielding the structure for the reflexivity of possibilities in
possibilities. This process is the condition for any distancing from the present
facts  and  their  vectors  and  environment.  It  allows  the  disclosure  of  the  total
environment, be the environment “material”, “ideological”, “juridical” or even
“ethical”. The judgment of current events, environment, or facts is a judgment
from  a  horizon  of  time  and  its  possibilities  requiring  no  hierarchal  arrayment
either of values or of norms. This free-ranging reflection of the time-in-time and
possibilities-in-possibilities  is  the  condition  upon  which  all  AI  processes  are

196   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
coded. For our purposes, it is not necessary to deal with further complexities of
time reflexivity as a condition for social reflexivity, which is institutionalized to
allow  the  complexity  and  management  of  an  indefinite  multiplicity  of  social
events  and  factual  factors.  Suffice  it  to  say  that  such  reflexivity  opens  the
possibility  for  decision-making  without  being  one  of  the  interest-laden  social
factors, ideologies, or juridical norms. In a unique sense, such norms disclose the
question of “overlapping time”. The norms, such as constitutional, are designed in
the past, but also belong in the future horizon as relevant to what other future
norms  can  or  cannot  be  established  and  thus  can  reflect  across  other  future
possibilities. For example, we can perform biological and chemical experiments
on  humans  only  within  designated  limits.  This  also  reflects  on  biological  and
chemical investments in pharmaceutical research, production, and advertisement.
This  might  also  reflect  on  the  possibility  of  political  and  public  debates
concerning the changing of rules. Resultantly, all AI programs will require human
input concerning value selectivities and their place in a temporal horizon of what
and for whom something is possible and what is not.
Our most limited discussion of the conditions of field horizon empowers us to
consider further the shift of the concept of theory to a concept of critical theory.
First of all, it must be noted that theory no longer has a privileged status to be an
extra-social,  extra-historical,  or  extra-temporal  process,  surveying  events
indifferently from a non-participating observer’s stance. Theory, too, functions in
society and history and thus changes the very “objects” of its explanation. This is
more so the case when every theory is constructed technically, and thus, its only
acceptance is “what we can make of it”. Hence, a critical theory must:
1. Show how its very explanations of events will influence such events, since such
an explanation can be subsumed under one possible process and its predictions
either enhanced or thwarted; and
2. Evaluate social events from a temporal horizon of possibilities showing what is
possible  and  what  is  impossible  within  a  given  set  of  facts,  norms,  and  their
vectors and their possible futures and relationships.
This means that a critical theory must correlate all factors and show how, in this
correlation, some possibilities are realizable, others are probable, and still others
are made impossible. For example, it must show how an economic capacity may
be  thwarted  by  a  political  incapacity,  a  moral  stance  or  an  economic
misapplication,  or  how  an  economic  capacity,  yielding  certain  options,  may
become  impossible  due  to  a  technological  incapacity.  At  the  same  time,  the
critical theory must show the limits of the possibilities of a social system and
delimit what changes must be instituted within certain social facts—technologies

Limits of Artificial Intelligence
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   197
and rules to surpass the limitations. The critical theory thus constitutes the most
encompassing  process  of  social  field  horizon  in  history  and  ultimately  in  the
complexity  of  world  time.
As  with  any  invention,  AI  has  become  a  public  issue  concerning  its  impact,
influences, and effects on various areas of society. It must be understood at the
outset that inventions do not have a linear effect; rather, they spread vectorially
and  through  diverse  levels  of  social  life,  including  economy,  education,
employment,  health,  safety,  public  norms,  crime,  family  composition,
international  relations,  and  global  ecology.  Current  writers  call  this  impact
“exponential”  since  every  step  in  chip  enhancement  is  doubled—such  that  in
traveling  25  linear  meters  exponentially,  one  would  almost  cover  the
circumference of the Earth. This metaphor is to be supplemented by vectorial
logic  insofar  as  the  growth  of  AI  spreads  in  all  directions  and  across  diverse
fields.  Simple  images  of  a  group  of  young  people  sitting  together  are  quite
revealing. Each has an iPhone used to “text their friends”, including those sitting
at the same table. The vectors merge into a field-horizon of possibilities such that
any judgment of the need and utility of any AI must include a variety of “futures”,
a conjunction of values and their evaluation, and thus political questions, to be
adjudicated locally and globally. The vectorial logic of AI is constitutive of a
spread of space-time possibilities and their shifting relationships. Every vector
“touches” different space-time “locations” and creates field-locations which also
radiate vectors, reaching and transforming the “initial” field. The task is to discuss
the way AI functions in various fields, such as finance, driverless cars, industrial
production, all kinds of “services” such as waiters, home appliances, attendants,
teachers, medical “workers” in precision surgery, and even scientific researchers.
Second, the admitted limits and constant, technical issues admitted by researchers
in the fields of AI, and the constant role required of fallible humans who correct
and are corrected by AI. Third, the constantly shifting field-horizon logic, both
encompassing  the  AI  and  being  rearticulated  by  its  vectorial  presence.  This
shifting logic requires the reevaluation of the functioning of “time-space” insofar
as the question of what is present, future, and past, near and far, becomes radically
rearticulated: Various possibilities to be realized will be regarded as a feature of
the  judgments  regarding  what  to  do  first,  where  it  is  to  be  done,  and  what
resources are available— such as lithium, and what places must be built to store
global information, called “clouds”, which are not in the sky but which occupy
vast areas, such as the one in Langfang, China, which covers an area equivalent to
110 football fields. Meanwhile, various calculations of selected social possible
impact areas will, reflectively, form an evaluation of the features to be built into
an AI; various selected production of AI will select past records of persons who
can accomplish future tasks in such a production, and such a selection will offer a
technical  education  for  future  employment.  This  means  the  following:  The

198   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
algorithms forming a specific set of AI functions are mathematical. The latter has
neither
 time
 nor
 temporal
 continuity,
 neither
 present,
 past,
 nor
future—mathematics is “Platonic” or timeless, and it does not have a location in
space—neither here nor there. Thus, human time awareness will have to come
into play to make judgments “when” and from “when to when”, and from where
to where; the horizon possibilities will come into play. The play and inter-play
within the field-horizon of possibilities may be calculated mathematically, but
such calculations, as numbers by themselves, have no today or tomorrow, and
above all, no “memory of the past”: Enter the fallible humans. The fallibility is
based  on  the  inevitable  fact  that  any  AI,  calculating  the  field  horizon  of  any
produced fact with its vectors, has no sense of time, such as future, now, or past.
AI sees things mathematically and hence atemporally. While it can offer all sorts
of  complex  possibilities,  the  final  decision  of  when  to  implement  the  future
depends on fallible humans whose horizon is less sophisticated than the complex
numbers posted on the AI screen.
The entrance of this modern man is unique: While being fallible, he decided to
look at the world only mathematically and regarded such a vision to be precise
and infallible. The result is a scientific methodology and theoretical construct,
leading to the production of modern technical reality. Being material, the latter is
“contingent”,  and  thus,  when  managed  and  constructed  by  fallible  humans,  is
never perfect. While using mathematical techniques for its construction, the best
that one can hope for is “statistical” distribution of probabilities. In this sense, any
AI, as a technical invention, cannot function with mathematical precision, since
what  mathematics,  in  its  technical  precision,  can  produce  is  statistically
contingent. Even if we allow that statistics, as mathematical, is infallible, what it
calculates is always exposed to the possibilities of “unpredictable”, contingent
facts. Of course, as every scientist will proclaim, “numbers do not lie”, but the
problem is that facts can be different. It is like pharmaceutical advertisements:
“This  drug  is  the  best  for  your  heart—60%  satisfaction.  But  check  with  your
doctor if you have the following conditions…. In case of loss of consciousness,
call your doctor, or 911, or go to the emergency room”. In brief, chances are, and
the numbers of the chances are statistically precise, but every case is “chancy”. As
noted above, the increasing complexity of the field horizon of any AI fact opens
an  increasing  horizon  of  possibilities  and  combinations  of  diverse  fields  of
research, production, and invention, increasing the contingency of results. In brief,
such incrementation outruns every judicial, public, and normative institution to
decide  the  value  selectivity  of  numerous  futures  and  the  intersections  of  their
temporal  possibilities.  The  latter,  as  we  shall  see  shortly,  is  also  based  on
technical time and space calculus with its precise imprecisions in the context of
the world as field-horizon as an open and undetermined, although determinable by
value  selectivity  as  the  modern  mode  of  perception.  Such  perception  is

Limits of Artificial Intelligence

modal—the  temporal  logic  of  possibility,  accessible  only  to  transcendental
awareness  which,  as  we  saw  earlier,  is  basically  time  awareness  and,  with  its
vectorial logic, also space awareness.
CONTINGENCY
While  seeing  things  mathematically  is  absolute,  its  instrumental  realization  is
contingent. Every novel invention will be an advancement but will also create a
greater  variety  of  technical  “facts”,  each  belonging  to  a  field-horizon  and
possessing  vectors  of  value  selectivity  that  fragment  and  recombine  the
environment into new forms; the latter has an impact in numerous areas, from
medicine  to  production,  employment,  training,  and  even  family  relationships.
After all, AI technologies are transportable, and employees take their work home
or,  by  now,  simply  work  from  home.  The  contingency  is  obvious  in
pharmaceutical advertisements of health products. Every product is introduced to
treat some specific area—atomistically—and then come the warnings concerning
“side effects”, which immediately reveal that a specific ailment cannot be located
and thus, the product will spread negative effects on the rest of the organism. To
obfuscate  this  contingency,  scientific  research  is  presented  in  statistical-
mathematical form, which guarantees that the product is effective in 73.7% cases.
Such cases have 48.2% fewer negative side effects. One can just imagine how
great it is to take a product for “improved” sleep. Research has shown that, by
taking  this  product,  your  restfulness,  morning  satisfaction,  and  relaxation  will
improve by at least 72.64%. While facts are contingent, the numbers do not lie.
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: CRITIQUE
The  world  of  AI  is  an  invention  of  previously  discussed  modern  Western
atomistic  ontology  and  mathematical  metaphysics.  These  two  features  are
embodied  in  all  AI  systems,  from  initial  calculators,  to  computers,  to  the
digitalization of all sciences—including the so-called “humanities” and industrial
robotics—soon  to  enter  all  homes  as  cleaners  and  servants.  What  is  usually
missed is the discursive power of all AI “products”. They are languages, and to
read the “instructions” on how to operate them, one learns the language that a
specific AI speaks. The technical systems we invent are not mere technologies for
our  use;  they  are  languages  and  indeed,  each  computer,  each  phone,  is  an
intersection  of  various  discourses,  run  by  diverse  algorithms.  The  disciplines,
being basically technical, have become a “material-language” capable of direct
inscription in concrete activities. Since technologies function under the law of
power, i.e., increasing growth whose only aim is self-proliferation, and since their
continuous refinement calls for greater efficiency on the human side, then the
human must be increasingly subjected to a system of controls appropriate for a

Mickunas and Pilotta
technical  set  of  operations.  A  person  must  learn  the  increasingly  complex
languages of the contemporary environment in order to communicate with it and
adapt  himself  to  the  commands  of  its  discourses.  Moreover,  the  growing
articulation of technological processes—correlative to the articulation of formal
languages—leads to a horizontal division of functions, capable of greater controls
and, at the same time, of increasing arbitrariness. By now, there is no longer any
debate concerning the metaphysical status of formal-mathematical systems: They
are  constructs  “at  will”  and  their  technical  use  can  change  the  “material
production”  of  new  implements  which  embody  the  constructed  languages,
becoming  new  disciplines.  At  this  level,  we  discover  once  again  the  growing
contingency  of  the  environment,  including  human  actions  as  part  of  the
environment, and the enhancement of the power of technical arbitrariness. In this
sense, the public fabric, as the arena of human daily activities, is shifted toward
the management of the “scientific” discourses embodied in every feature of the
environment. One cannot buy a box of cereal without having to read a list of
scientific data: 120 calories per cup, 11% sugar, 17% fat, and so on.
Our modern vision—“Let us look at things mathematically”—has invented our
environment with vast power of instruments, which see us and demand that we
become their images, and follow their “intentions”, which see us faster and more
efficiently than we see them or ourselves. Thus, AI tells us how to build cars,
invest our finances, train for jobs, see the universe, and calculate our future. This
vision  of  seeing  us  as  a  sum  of  quantifiable  and  interchangeable  functions  is
extended to discard everything personal. One is simply an ego in a specific space-
time location and can become another ego by learning a different discourse and
assuming a different function in another location. One becomes dispersed in time
and space, attached to fleeting phenomena for momentary happiness. In modern
terms, this is the utilitarian, pleasure “ethics”. The price for such ethics is being
watched at all times and in all places, whether it is on one’s telephone, computer,
cruise  vacation,  or  by  public  cameras.  The  advertisers,  the  autocratic
governments,  the  statisticians—and  all  equally  watched  by  the  vast
technologies—spies  spying  on  spies—are  recorded.  All  social  members  are
available  on  the  bases  of  assessments,  records,  rumors,  and  intersecting
hierarchies of power centers that mutually share informational records: Police
records go to banks, bank records go to workplaces, workplace records couple
with  family  records,  confirming  or  contradicting  police  records,  vacation,
education, travel, medical records, crisscrossing from one disciplinary center to
another, as centers of competing powers exert greater control over the person. One
does not meet a person first in order to ascertain who she is; the records, present
on the most varied programs “see” and evaluate the person by reducing one to a
positional, ego function. This is to say, it is not the eyes that watch the human as
if  he  were  a  natural  being;  it  is  the  records,  the  technologies,  the  reports,  the

Limits of Artificial Intelligence
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   201
filled-out papers, and the rhetoric of the enveloping “invisible vision”. Person is
irrelevant since, by now, there are no persons but sums of functions obedient to
numerous discourses and rules of technical systems. The broader self, the more
disclosed by classical education, is abolished.
Everywhere, such “Western education” is discarded as disruptive; persons with
such education might ask uncomfortable questions, might challenge authorities
and even demand respect. Such features of persons are a hindrance to “progress”.
We  have  arrived  at  what  de  Cervantes  (1957)  called  the  “iron  age”.  Expert
discourses of every discipline communicate with other discourses, contesting, and
extending the fragmentation of disciplines which fragment the human into a more
“visible” sum of discursive functions. It would seem that the AI has far surpassed
its creator—on the verge of making him obsolete. If not obsolete, then at best
equivalent in discursive talents as those embedded in AI as another competitor in
the social-economic field of tasks. But this competitor is anonymous and does not
“think”  of  social  responsibility  or  accountability  to  anyone.  It  treats  its
“competitors”  as  another  set  of  discourses,  imbued  with  different  algorithms.
When a person accepts a position in an organization, she must accept anonymous
instructions  from  her  AI  partner  and,  if  she  fails  to  communicate,  the  partner
disqualifies her—nothing personal. The AI seems to be victorious, although it
does not know what victory or defeat is.
The victory might be premature and the race not yet over. There are expert voices
that are raising questions concerning the limits of AI, regardless of how far its
“intelligence”  and  abilities  are  stretched.  The  AI  is  called  upon  to  perform
“infinite  tasks”  of  increasing  complexity.  One  such  well-discussed  task  is  the
management of vast commodity outlets, such as Amazon or Walmart, and others.
While not completely implemented, some outlets, such as Amazon, are run by AI;
customers  with  proper  cards  can  pick  items  from  shelves  and  the  price  is
recorded; the customer can walk out the door without the lines at cash registers.
The trouble comes with the “unruly” customers; they pick items, get recorded, but
then decide to put the item back, their children might drop things in the cart,
leading to the issue of recognition of who belongs to one family or another. It will
not do to add one more algorithm to manage all the others since its organizing
power in no wise can eliminate the accidental or even deliberate actions which
would  confuse  the  AI  system(s).  This  is  a  minor  issue  in  comparison  to  the
requirements of the global distribution of floods of commodities. But of course,
there is progress and someday, we shall be able to invent a divine AI which will
see everything in detail and track everything from moment to moment—a total
digital  world,  reached  only  at  infinity.  After  all,  such  an  AI  interconnects
everything, and thus, one fault is equivalent to a cascade across this AI universe.

202   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
A more fundamental issue is social-political; the ideologues of AI will contend
that if mistakes occur, they are due to “human error”—after all “numbers do not
lie”. Indeed, but people will go around numbers without lying to maintain their
various  interests.  The  idea  of  scientific  management  originates  with  Galileo
(1974). Here, the state had to be drawn in as a wise manager of all social affairs,
so well-promoted by Thatcherism in conjunction with AI—a conservative dream.
Following this dream, Britain is a good example of its “outcomes”. Setting targets
leads to perverse results. The hospitals were required to give time measures as to
how  long  it  took  patients  to  be  treated  when  they  were  dropped  off  by
ambulances.  Statistical  figures  “decided”  that  the  waiting  time  was  too  long.
Hospitals  solved  the  “problem”:  instead  of  depositing  patients  in  emergency
rooms,  they  were  kept  in  the  ambulances.  Getting  the  right  “outcomes”  leads
managers to “achieve” the required results. For example, policemen will receive
raises and promotions if they achieve measurable crime reduction goals. The real
result:  reporting  less  crime  by  the  police.  A  similar  “outcome”  appears  in
academia. Tenure and promotion are awarded on the production of articles rather
than teaching—at the expense of students. The experiment in the United States, to
reward teachers for outcomes—measured by exam scores—is another example:
Teachers began to teach for exams and not the subject matter. It is a context where
a  teacher  will  be  tempted  to  discover  what  the  exam  questions  are  and  then
provide  the  answers.  Science  is  flawless—too  bad  that  the  infestation  by  the
conniving,  fallible,  and  contingent  carbon-based  units  keep  interfering.
The  ideologues  of  instrumental  reason  must  constantly  appeal  to  the  modern
temporal horizon of possibilities as the calculus by which contemporary problems
will be solved: We have progress, and the latter is the flux maintaining its own
permanence. And it is humans who decide and must maintain progress by the
inevitable requirement to keep progressing: the newest, latest IT software, the
fastest  machines  (after  all,  time  is  money),  and  the  latest  and  most  qualified
programmers. All these features matter because, in terms of software companies,
“software is eating the world”, i.e., most firms are, to a great degree, software
companies. So, what is at issue? Computer code: Programmers are required to
make  progress—to  be  literate  and  creative.  According  to  their  own  statistical
rules, programmers make up to 50 errors in every 1000 lines of code they write
(e.g.,  a  misplaced  punctuation  mark);  since  cars  and  airplanes  contain  tens  of
millions of lines, the chance of an error-free system is zero. Thus, an average
developer spends approximately 20 hours per week fixing old or bad code. This is
compounded by “the transcendental rule of progress: flux enhancing flux”. Every
new program must be faster and more encompassing than the ones available at
present, and the new one will be a faster condition for the next one, which will be
still faster. Critical features show up. From “field linguistics”, we know that a
change of one term in a system of language will change the rest of terms, and

Limits of Artificial Intelligence
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   203
even terms in the associated fields. A dramatic example is available in the simple
pronouncement  in  various  literatures,  whether  it  is  Nietzsche,  Kafka,  or
Dostoyevsky, that “god is dead”. This means that if the word “god” no longer
appears  in  a  linguistic  field,  all  other  terms  associated  with  it  will  change:
morality, the essence of nature, expectations, the “eternal soul”, the meaning of
existence, and so on. The human expression concerning this “death” was, “If god
is dead, everything is permitted”. The impact of the deletion of one term vibrated
(and  still  does)  in  the  academic  world  and  in  the  economy.  Countless  texts,
dissertations, theological gatherings, shouts of “nihilism” proliferated across the
West and beyond, enriching publishing houses and rattling the sanctity of life
itself—in many debates, it is seen as the cause of two world wars.
The field understanding is completely correlated to the presence and development
of the software which is running the AI world. The flux in programming means
that, even if a system works, it is already on the brink of becoming obsolete. The
departing systems, with not-yet resolved “bugs” are in part incorporated in the
new system, where the new terms and algorithms will change the function of the
old language, including the errors which will reappear as incomprehensible in the
new  language.  The  great  new  systems  rapidly  devolve  into  half-understood
mixtures of terms; thus, the solution must come from a new system—and this is
also an incrementation of danger. The newest system must do everything that the
half-understood old one does and more—of course with guaranteed chances of its
own mistakes. There are bugs in one field which must incorporate bugs from
another field, each changing itself and the others—calling for a creation of one
more program-field, compounding the reshuffling of the function of terms across
the old and the latest—bugs bugging bugs.
The  issues  can  be  extended  to  include  “methodical  hermeneutics”  or
interpretation. It has been said that hermeneutical thinking, in general, constitutes
a circle. Each text in a context implies the context, and the latter implies the text.
Regardless of how far we stretch the hermeneutical understanding, we shall have
to admit this rule. Parts imply the whole, and the whole is given through the parts.
If  a  text  is  inserted  into  a  different  hermeneutical  circle—a  different
context—then  its  terms  will  be  drastically  changed  or  even  meaningless.  The
novel  text,  or  set  of  texts,  will  suppress  a  previous  text,  a  culture,  or  even  a
tradition. Speaking more concretely, some of the traditional texts tend to fade out,
and  cease  to  function  as  “significant”  in  a  given  context,  and  thus  the  only
preservation that is accorded to them is done by the philological method. The
latter can be a catalyst for various renaissances of texts—a sort of archaization
movement—that  proclaims  the  genuine  truths  that  have  been  forgotten  and
neglected. Searches for “ancient wisdom” have this tendency, yet such tendencies
are always destructive to the extent that the “dead languages”, although preserved

204   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
by philological method in archival depositories, are framed in the current living
languages, and hence are taken out of their own contexts. They are a species that
have vanished, reappearing only in a dramatically reconstructed genetic pool.
For example, after the Renaissance, the Scientific and Political Enlightenments,
and the Reformation, medieval literature virtually vanished. What sealed its fate
in the past, and the libraries of the monasteries, was that the art of printing became
the means of communication. The literature of the Renaissance was correlated to
and  had  direct  access  to  this  new  technology.  The  rest  were  consigned  to
manuscripts  which,  apart  from  being  written  in  peculiar  Latin,  also  contained
numerous  abbreviations  and  other  peculiarities,  and  it  was  nigh  impossible  to
decipher. What we have as “Neo-scholastic” is a concoction of parts into a whole
that belongs to our reading. Thus, in the case of all Middle Eastern personality
cults, such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, there are efforts to insert their texts
into  modern  Western  tradition  and  indeed  create  organizations  such  as  the
Christian Democrats, whose meaning is that of the Enlightenment and not of the
original context. Such organizations are parts of a drastically different circle and
their reading of the texts of the “ancient wisdom” of prophets, and they do not
refer to their own whole, but to a whole which interprets such wisdom in modern
terms as historical literatures, equivalent to other such literatures. Indeed, such
wisdom  texts,  interpreted  in  their  own  “original  context”  lead  their  readers  to
reject  modern  political  and  scientific  enlightenment  as  the  true  enemy  to  be
destroyed  by  any  means—thus  holy  wars,  terrorism  and  “conversion”.
And then comes the battle for data—who owns, who manipulates, what is private,
what  can  be  advertised,  what  are  the  targeted  audiences,  what  data  must  be
forbidden, by what social system, and who can decide what is allowed and what is
forbidden? Yet, as the saying goes, data are the lifeblood of AI. The mere amount
of  data  is  staggering.  For  example,  “data”  available  for  2018  generated  33
zettabytes of data—enough to fill seven trillion DVDs. Despite this grand amount,
data issues are the most contested in any AI project. Different organizations do
their  best  to  “lock  up”  data  to  prevent  competitors  from  accessing  it.  Data
controversies take up to 80% of the time in any AI project, and training a machine
to  “recognize”  a  great  variety  of  features  is  a  task  performed  by  an  army  of
humans  who  must  label  a  particular  feature,  whether  it  is  a  street  scene  or  a
human face, or a fractured bone, or even a tumor. While collecting and labeling
such data might shift to trained AI, the use of such data has to contend with social
and political rules—privacy, ownership—leading to international tensions over
“stealing” both the AI and the data.

Limits of Artificial Intelligence

CONCLUSION
In  conclusion,  the  big  issue  is  this:  Once  something  is  posted  on  the  global
network, it is up for grabs by anyone. A miniature example is that of a girl who
posts her “compromising image” on the internet “only” for her boyfriend, only to
discover that “others” have accessed the image and are selling it. If she takes the
seller to court, the common judgment is: Once you posted the image, you made it
available to anyone. Add to this the issue of hackers who can crack codes and
access data which they might sell to the highest bidder, leading to a proliferation
of programs to hack the hackers and hiring hackers to devise programs to protect
against other hackers. In brief, thieves steal from thieves, each accusing the others
of  thievery.  Again,  we  encounter  the  same  transcendental  rule:  flux,  both
enhancing and maintaining flux—a variant of modern instrumental reason and
progress.

CHAPTER 11
Conditions For Public Decisions
Abstract:  Chapter  11  entertains  the  tensions  between  the  development  of  future
artificial intelligence structures and the priorities of universal human rights, which
necessitate the founding of a public domain. We return to our discussion of the effects
of  Enlightenment  theorizing  on  the  current  situation,  contrasting  that  with  the
possibilities afforded by taking a phenomenological approach to the concept of human
rights. The limits of personal autonomy are discussed, and phenomenological concepts
that were explicated earlier in work are applied to this question of human rights, which
are  discussed  in  conjunction  with,  as  well  as  in  opposition  to,  the  effects  of  the
globalizing logic that advocates for the unfettered application of computer logic to all
aspects of life.

INTRODUCTION
The proclamation of Universal Human Rights, and the numerous celebrations,
organizations,  and  debates  promoting  and  defending  such  rights  can  only  be
plausible if the conditions for the possibility of such rights are articulated. The
latter  task  requires  an  understanding  that  disregards  many  theoretical  and
explanatory accounts for the appearance of such rights and their ontological, and
even metaphysical, grounds. What shall be argued in this chapter is the notion that
Human Rights are not a fact, derivable from all sorts of social, psychological,
naturalistic, theological and even current genetic claims that “humanity is 98%
homogeneous”. The fact is that, despite this homogeneity, the varieties of cultural
practices, social systems, and even mutual antagonisms point to another set of
requirements  to  discuss  human  rights.  Moreover,  it  will  be  argued  that  the
obtainment of rights is inseparable from responsibilities and duties. In the process
of explicating the conditions for the possibility of rights and responsibilities, it
will be noted that even the common understanding of freedom of choice will have
to  be  discarded  as  inadequate—specifically  with  respect  to  the  question  of
responsibility. While socio-historical views might offer analyses of various social,
economic, and historical events that “caused” democratic movements, the philoso-

phical task is to show the fundamental presuppositions that sustain a democratic
polity  and  human  rights.  The  argument  has  been  made  that  naturally  and
empirically speaking, humans are radically unequal in talents, dispositions, and
aims. Such a view precludes an understanding of freedom and equality, and could
easily lead, if not to an aristocracy of the best at least to a meritocracy of the most
talented,  or  a  theocracy  who  would  make  public  policy  for  the  good  of  the
remainder of the population without any input from such a population. This was
the case in the Soviet system, wherein an enlightened party and its technocrats
could claim that widespread participation in making policy is unnecessary since
the common weal can best be served, not by ignorant masses, but by enlightened
elites  armed  with  the  knowledge  of  history,  society,  and  what  is,  in  the  final
analysis, ultimately good. No progress could be achieved if decisions were left to
the  multitude  of  individual  whims.  Individual  freedoms  cannot  exist  until  the
elites  and  technocrats  have  established  the  appropriate  economic  and  social
conditions. This is to say, social rules must be derived from interests and causes
and not from rational considerations. Thus, there cannot be a public domain for
the populations and freedom has to be reserved for the elites, while postponed
until remote and future material-technical conditions are erected for the rest of the
population.  In  effect,  and  in  a  contradictory  fashion,  freedom,  as  one  of  the
grounds  for  universal  human  rights,  is  deemed  to  be  a  result  of  all  sorts  of
conditions.
UNIVERSAL CONDITIONS
The principles of human rights, wherein free and equal persons are involved in the
final arbitration, rest on different conditions. Thus, a question arises concerning
the difference between the relationships that comprise a political community and
other types of relationships. The answer demands careful scrutiny of the founding
of  a  political  community  wherein  human  rights  are  located.  What  should  be
emphasized is that the term “founding” does not necessarily imply some historical
set of conditions or some specific interests. Rather, this idea refers to a necessary
institution  on  which  other  political  institutions  can  be  built.  Thus,  this  is  a
grounding and not a historical relationship. Most human relationships rest on a
variety of similar and conflicting interests, whose resolution too often depends on
power. Although such interests may become a part of such an institution, there is
a difference between interests and the creation of an institution that we shall call
the public domain. This is to say, the founding and the existence of such a domain
are tied inextricably together. While diverse purposes depend on interests and
require  appropriate  means,  the  public  domain  is  its  own  means,  purpose,  and
requires each citizen for its maintenance. The rationale for human relationships in
the public domain is this very relationship, which is identical to its own purpose.

208   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
The activity of founding a public domain as its own purpose, is not an activity of
the  past,  done  once  and  for  all  by  the  so-called  “founders”,  but  must  be
responsibly and constantly maintained by every citizen. One cannot speak of the
public domain as if it were some system that perpetuates itself without individual
participation and support or merely with the periodic participation of voters. The
public domain, as the first institution of a democratic community, is a perpetual
process of self-founding, not a structure imposed on a community or derived from
some  abstract  needs  and  interests.  In  the  public  domain,  the  equality  and
autonomy  of  humans  are  maintained  for  their  own  sake.  This  means  that  the
source of human equality and autonomy is co-extensive with and sustained only
in the public domain. In principle, any other form of the community may be based
on heterogeneous interests and purposes, resulting in the domination of one social
group by another, but such a situation would disallow the equality and autonomy
of every individual. The notion that humans act socially on the basis of their own
interests leads to a structure of society whereby individual or group interests are
pitted  against  the  interests  of  others,  thus  leading  to  the  exercise  of  power,
inequality, and the abolition of autonomy. Yet, what is meant by autonomy and
equality needs to be delimited.
Critical scholarship has shown that the basic principles of modern Enlightenment,
explicated by Pico through Kant (Mickunas, 2012), have rejected the Naturalistic
and  Essentialist  views  of  the  human  person.  Such  principles  also  imply  the
absence  of  causes  in  human  affairs.  But  what  does  this  mean  with  respect  to
equality and autonomy? First, as already mentioned, for modern philosophical
Western thinking, there is no specific human nature to serve as a source of human
equality. Second, equality results from a specific concept of freedom, such as
autonomy. The freedom of autonomy is analogous to logic, wherein the rules that
are established logically and rationally do not result from imperatives, but from
respect for rational and free debate. Accordingly, the equality of all persons stems
from autonomy. If rules, logics, and rational discourses are not derivable from
natural  states  of  affairs,  then  there  are  no  inherent  criteria  for  elevating  one
possible  proposal  for  rules  over  another.  In  this  sense,  all  proposals  are  equal.
Autonomous  freedom,  as  rational  in  the  above  sense,  leads  to  the  equality  of
persons who are in a position to posit rules by which they will govern their lives
and deal with the environment. Each individual is an equal “lawgiver”. If there are
to be common rules, they will not be discovered but posited and decided on in
public,  i.e.,  in  political  debate.  Third,  the  establishment  of  rules  based  on
autonomy also means that such rules are free, and individuals are duty-bound and
responsible  for  living  under  such  rules.  Only  autonomously  established  rules
demand a person to be responsible for his adherence to them. If rules were derived
from any other source, such as the nature of whatever description, then one would

A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   209
be compelled by natural forces and could not be held responsible. This is counter
to  a  traditional  conception  of  freedom:  not  the  freedom  of  autonomy,  but  a
freedom of choice. While at one level, this freedom presupposes autonomy as a
foundation  for  constituting  rules,  at  another  level,  the  choice  of  rules  is
determined by interests and power. This means that one may have a choice to
steal money or food in the face of hunger, but one’s choice is subtended by a
natural compulsion, and in this sense, such a person could not be held responsible.
The  latter  requires  an  autonomous  freedom  wherein  the  very  rules,  stemming
from such autonomy, are our duty to maintain. But it is to be emphasized that
such autonomy and its resultant equality of persons is founded by, and is co-
extensive with, the public domain, where everyone is equal and free to establish
rules of common action.
One  misunderstanding  must  be  avoided:  The  autonomy  and  equality  of  each
individual,  as  the  unconditional  source  of  law,  does  not  imply  unrestricted
activities. This means the freely posited rules are not causes that restrict human
life but are rationally analyzable structures that can be modified and even rejected.
Autonomous freedom implies a life under freely posited, debated, and rationally
examined rules. This achievement is a matter of public debate and consensus.
This  is  another  way  of  saying  that  the  political  is  identical  to  the  continuous
activity  of  maintaining  or  founding;  the  public  domain  as  its  own  purpose  is
equally the maintaining and founding of autonomy, responsibility, and equality of
persons. This domain is the basic public institution on which all other political
institutions—including specific constitutions and human rights—rest. Unless each
member of society is able to enter the public domain as an autonomous, equal,
and hence responsible source of rules, the meaning of political disappears.
No  doubt,  one  could  contend  that  by  living  with  others,  the  autonomous
individual is limited, specifically where one group’s interests are given primacy
over another’s. This is a thesis advocated by both capitalists and communists.
Nonetheless,  this  arrangement  may  split  society  into  classes,  thus  resulting  in
class conflicts. In this case, the public, autonomy, responsibility, and equality
framed as political society vanish and the public domain is reduced to a clash of
irrational motives and causes, while publicly appointed servants operate on the
basis of their own interests and support those who can best satisfy these interests.
Here, autonomous freedom as a source of public rules also disappears.
How can this abolition of the political and the public be avoided? In the face of
numerous  relationships,  the  autonomy  of  every  member  of  society  must  be
structured by the following conditions. First, everyone is an autonomous source of
law; second, all laws are proposed and discussed by citizens in order to reach a
reasonable consensus; third, all laws must be applied equally to everyone, i.e.,

210   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
they must be designated as universal; four, as autonomous and equal, all members
in the public domain have universal rights and duties to be the sources and the
subjects  of  laws.  These  conditions  outline  the  rights  of  every  member  of  the
public, and thus rights are secured by mutually obtained laws. The latter regulates
the freedom of everyone in relation to others.
One of the most important assertions is the universality of every law. Along with
the  absence  of  contradictions  in  a  given  law,  universality  is  a  guarantee  of
rationality and equality. This is to say, every proposed and publicly approved law
must be accepted by all, including the instigator of the law. If one proposes a law
against stealing, then she, too, must be subjected to the law. If any exceptions are
made, then the law ceases to be universal. But any public claim to the universality
of  law  excludes  such  contradictions.  Therefore,  the  freedom  and  equality  of
persons are assumed to be the grounds of law. The universality of laws implies
another basic principle: The claim that one is an autonomous source of laws must
include all members of a political community. That is, everyone is an equal source
of law. Without this procedure, one would face a reverse contradiction: No one is
the source of laws, but I am a source of this rule.
It is important to note that such a ground has very little in common with any kind
of  naturalistic  ontology  or  metaphysical  and  moral  explanation  for  a  political
community. Clearly, there is a wide variety of individuals. Persons differ with
respect to interests, abilities, and aims, and left to function in such a context,
society  would  be  a  sum  of  confrontations  and  antagonisms  that  produce
inequalities. Given such a situation, laws would depend on the power of interest
groups. In this sense, not all societies are political, despite the actions of persons
such  as  Hitler,  Stalin,  Reagan,  Mao  Dze  Dong,  and  Trump,  who  claim  to  be
engaged  in  political  affairs.  If  such  persons  were  engaged  in  the  support,
protection, or enhancement of specific interests, or if they abolished the public
domain  and  universal  participation  in  the  formation  of  laws,  then  one  should
speak of power confrontations and not politics. Strictly speaking, politics has one
major aim: an open public domain in which every member of the community is
involved in raising and resolving issues. Of course, implied in this is that political
community members are equally duty-bound to participate in all public affairs,
even at the expense of their private or social agendas. The latter does not require a
continuous founding, while the public affairs that comprise the domain where
autonomy is maintained must be constantly affirmed. The term “duty” should not
be read morally. The concern at this juncture is with an ethos—a way of being
political  by  a  participation  in  the  public  arena  when  public  interests  are  at
issue—and thus with maintaining one’s own autonomy. Indeed, the Athenians of
ancient  Greece  regarded  those  who  failed  to  take  part  in  public  affairs  not  as
“non-political”, but as “incapable of being”. If freedom and equality are features

A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   211
of human life, then any introduction of causal explanations or justifications denies
what makes us human.
The  distinction  between  the  political  and  the  social-private  shows  that  human
autonomy requires a political community, where the individual’s autonomy and
humanity  can  be  guaranteed  by  the  free  establishment  of,  and  responsible
adherence to, laws. Conversely, public and free enactment of laws is, equally,
essential to a political community. This framework allows the discussion of all
purposes.  Depending  on  temporary  requirements,  one  may  establish  other
institutions, such as legislative, administrative, and judicial, yet they, too, have the
clear task of assuring that, in the final analysis, the autonomous being remains the
undisputed arbiter of all rules. There is a hidden condition of this guarantee: In the
public arena, all social and economic differences are disregarded, as everyone
enters  the  public  domain  with  equal  rights  and  duties.  Universalism  ranges
through  various  layers  of  awareness  without  any  having  supremacy.
Let us begin with care since hasty pronouncements might lead to confusion. In
accordance  with  Classical  Western  thinking,  universality  is  premised  on  open
public  domain,  requiring  every  citizen  to  participate  in  public  affairs  without
introducing private wants, desires, and prejudices—since only such participation
guarantees  a  free  discussion,  not  determined  by  causes.  In  this  sense,  public
decisions  are  autonomous,  and  autonomy  means  that  every  citizen  is  equal,
regardless  of  social  position:  Equality  results  from  autonomy.  All  rules  are
derived  from  rational  dialogue  among  autonomous,  responsible,  and  equal
persons. It is also important to note that such rules might be partially mistaken,
and hence it is the duty of responsible citizens to correct them—equally through
public dialogue. This state of affairs can be stated as an unconditional human
responsibility for decisions, their enactment, and a duty to correct mistakes.
SUBJECTED SUBJECT
Without going into the protracted repetition concerning the very nature of the
world, the modern West accepted the view that nature is composed of physical
particles,  called  atoms,  known  as  the  “building  blocks”  of  the  universe.
Meanwhile, all the awareness which we usually call qualitative and valuative was
assigned to the subject. Hence, even such factors as autonomy and equality belong
to subjective awareness, while the world of particles is the objective reality. The
latter is not accessible to qualitative perception. It was obvious that the way to
treat the objective world was to look at it mathematically. The question that has to
be answered has to do with the access to the “imperceptible” reality of the atomic
parts. As mentioned above, there is no other avenue except through the subject,
who has to posit a method, and to do so self-consciously and critically. Descartes

212   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
(1983), in his ultimate doubt, expresses this search for a method which is not
derivable  from  the  vagaries  of  perception,  but  must  be  certified  by  a  mind
reflecting  upon  itself.  Since  phenomena,  judged  on  the  basis  of  perceptual
awareness, offer no objective certitude, objectivity must be guaranteed by the
mind  in  terms  of  clear  and  distinct  ideas,  a  methodology  which,  in  its  ideal
structure,  excludes  perceptual-qualitative  awareness.  These  ideas  and  this
methodology are quantitative, i.e., metaphysical in the form of mathematics and,
in accordance with modern ontology, must be mental and inevitably subjective.
The result is obvious: Objectivity is relative to the powers of the subject; the
world must be interpreted as accessible to the methods which are guaranteed by
reflective  thought  and  human  controls.  Too  many  texts  have  overlooked  a
background move or intention that had to play a decisive role in resolving an issue
arising  within  the  confines  of  the  new  subject.  The  latter  has  two  modes  of
subjective
 awareness:
 the
 perceptual—qualitative,
 and
 the
thinkable—quantitative.  Both  are  given  equally  to  the  reflecting  subject,  and
neither has any inherent criterion to indicate which is more appropriate to disclose
reality. It is obvious that the qualitative awareness is more direct and objective,
more  accessible  to  everyone  than  the  quantitative-mathematical.  For  most
persons, the latter has to be learned through great effort and torture, while the
former is present without any doubt. In brief, the choice of one over the other has
to be decided on other grounds, has to have another intention in its background.
The latter suggests that the selection of a quantitative-mathematical metaphysics
as a method is done on the basis of valuation: We want to control and master the
environment. After all, it is quite clear that, if we know how to define something
mathematically,  we  also  know  how  to  make  it.  In  principle,  this  method  is
technical.  It  contains  rules  of  construction  and  resultantly,  such  rules  can  be
applied  to  anything  in  a  way  that  the  very  application  will  regard  anything
mathematically. But this metaphysical method, and this ontological base, take for
granted  that  there  are  no  essential  distinctions,  no  qualitative  differentiations
among  the  objects  composed  of  the  “atomic”  parts.  The  difference  among
composed objects is one of quantity. The quantitative, a priori calculations of the
material aggregates require that such aggregates be arranged in a causal sequence
through  physical  activity,  such  that  the  calculated  arrangement  can  yield
predictable results. This process regards only the “underlying”, reified aggregates,
which are arranged, and experimented with in accordance with the reflectively
instituted  calculations.  The  quantified  arrangements  of  “matter”  allow,
correlatively,  the  quantitative  calculation  of  possible  “material”  results.  We
should  be  reminded  of  the  fact  that  by  the  eighteenth  century,  reality  was  no
longer defined in terms of its being, but in accordance with “the conditions for the
possibility of being”.

A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   213
Given that the modern conception of the environment is regarded to be the sum of
material  parts  that  are  qualitatively  and  essentially  indifferent,  then  such
materiality  can  be  used  as  a  condition  for  any  possible  reconstruction  on  the
grounds of formal systems. In principle, the formal systems are also technologies
for  reconstructing  the  material  environment.  This  logic  of  “self-generating”
formal systems that get directly translated into material implements implies that
even  the  material  facts  are  co-extensive  with  the  signitive  domain  of  formal
constructions.  The  term  “signitive”  designates  a  system(s)  of  interconnected
meanings, pervading the empirical domain. Thus, a flashing blue-red light means
a police car, signaling for a driver to stop, means speed limits, means fines, courts,
laws: means social values. Thus, the simple empirical “blue-red” in the human
world,  is  co-extensive  with  a  system(s)  of  meanings.  The  transformation  of
materiality into signitive conditions implies that the social environment is a life-
world structure, consisting of a system of multiple implications. To speak in a
limited traditional sense, all social factual phenomena are not merely factual, but
already signitive. In this sense, the world we live is an interconnection of social,
historical, scientific, valuative, and technical vectors. Signification as meaning
and/or sense-making is already available at the formal level that is understood by
anyone in applying calculations to environmental material conditions. Once those
conditions  are  “realized”  and,  therefore,  science  is  “embodied”  we  acquire  a
technical  environment  that  is  produced  in  terms  of  valuation,  which  is  in  a
background that grants certain formal systems practical value to transform the
environment  in  favor  of  the  so-called  “human  needs”.  This  means  that  the
criterion will be some valuative principle that will facilitate the decision as to
which formal system will be adequate to apply for the fulfillment of which needs.
Yet, the process is still more complex: The needs themselves are also selected in
terms  of  their  significance  in  a  given  life-world,  and  hence  are  not  a  mere
observation  and  generalization  of  empirical  phenomena.  In  principle,  formal
systems as signitive are valuative to the extent that they can fulfill the equally
articulated  desires  in  terms  of  socially,  psychologically,  and  economically
signified needs, mediated by technology as a constant, self-proliferating need. In
other  words,  the  very  needs  are  significant  by  social  and  not  by  empirical
definition. Not every psychological wish, or biological drive will be regarded as
socially significant. In this sense, only the significant needs will be granted value.
What emerges here is a question of multiple valuations. The kind of valuations
there are—and the kind of formal systems—must be constituted to translate the
material environment to fulfill the valuation of needs, depending on the complex
intersignification of a given life-world.
Technology,  at  this  level,  can  be  primitive,  ranging  from  implements  through
heavy-duty  mechanical  means,  all  the  way  to  industrial  mass  production.

214   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
Transferring such technology to various regions around the globe might, at first,
be  regarded  as  “neutral”:  road-building,  architecture,  hospitals,  and  schools,
including  technical  training.  But  it  is  significant  that  the  very  introduction  of
technologies does not leave a place and a society the same. The structure of space
and  time  gets  transformed,  tasks  get  reassigned,  family  life  is  changed—the
introduction of technology is equivalent to an introduction of a very different life-
world.
It is also the case that the current life-world of the West is interlaced by multiple
scientific and technical discourses and practices. One cannot buy a cereal box
without  being  exposed  to  multiple  languages  and  quantities  of  bio-chemical,
nutritional, caloric, and such codes. All this also implicates productive, normative,
and even legalistic interconnections as aspects of a life-world. This is to say, the
scientific and technical discourses and practices do not overlay some primordial
life-world, but rather comprise our understanding of the way our world and we
are, live, and relate. Our mass media are equally replete with reports of scientific
“studies”  and  reports  of  inventions  and  progress,  and  even  of  protests  against
some  scientific  inventions  and  technical  innovations—all  being  understood  as
aspects of our life-world. In this sense, technology embodies the entire life-world
of  the  West,  with  its  values,  ontology,  metaphysics,  education,  production,
research,  political  laws,  and  even  theological  controversies.  And  in  the  same
sense, any transfer of technology to various regions means an introduction of a
different life-world.
The  signitive  logics  that  pervade  the  life-world,  with  the  latter’s  valuative
selectivities, are also at the background of the cybernetic revolution. While the
cybernetic  revolution  brought  in  computer  science,  it  has  included  as  a
background the self-generating process of formal systems that are translated and
reified into the technical environment. The computerized logic as formal has no
regard for anything that is environmentally, qualitatively differentiated. Its own
logic does not need to respect the so-called “natural-qualitative” differentiations.
Any living, working, or suffering being in this logic of indifference can regard all
events in terms of mutually replaceable variants. Social, economic, pedagogical,
cultic, and cultural givens are, in this logic, equivalences in normative exchanges.
Whether something is labor power, artwork, or mysticism, it must subject itself to
the requirements of formal rules of quantification. The latter must become the
information to be transmitted globally. While previously, televisual globalization
was available, and this globalization depended on the valuative selectivity of large
media organizations, the computerized globalization offers any arbitrary access to
any selectivity. This means that rhetorical pronouncements as translatable into
practices  will  be  equivalent  to  other  propositions.  No  external  judgment  is
possible apart from an appeal to other computerized information whose credibility

is  simply  its  appearance  in  the  global  network.  Computerization  opens  up  a
domain of any space and any time accessed without history, without places and
without  times.  It  is  a  synchronic  instrument  premised  on  signification  that  is
everywhere  and  yet  localizable  on  any  computer,  smartphone,  or  in  large
areas—such as a cloud—comprising systems of vectorial space and time sites,
equally  vectorial  with  possibilities  of  such  space-time  sites.  The  age  of  the
computer  is  a  world  of  signification  where  there  is  no  place  and  time  and,
conversely,  where  all  places  and  all  times  are  equivalently  possible  and
accessible. Our task is, therefore, to explore the domain of all places and at all
times.
While it is possible to contend that sciences are value-free, it is not possible to
claim that formal systems, applied to transform the environment, are value-free.
The required connection between logic and fact introduces the third component at
base: valuative. This is to say that the very understanding of the application of
logically  framed  theories  or  hypotheses  introduces  selectivity  among  various
logics  and  selectivity  as  to  what  domains  in  the  environment  are  relevant  for
application  and  hence  techno-logical  reconstruction.  The  reconstruction  is  an
activity  premised  on  human  purposes  and  resultantly  on  various  levels  of
valuation  interpreted  in  various  ways,  such  as  sociological,  psychological,
economic,  ideological,  and  even  mythological.
Whether  biotechnology  or  computer  rationality,  each  is  value-laden,  and,
therefore,  premised  on  individual  or  social  purposes.  For  example,  computer
rationality consists of layers of value systems. In the final analysis, valuations
promote autonomous selectivity and invention, and in turn, place demands on
individuals and groups. Engaging in the continuous proliferation of increasing
efficiency  and  creativity  requires  that  any  logic  translated  into  material
implements becomes, in turn, the means to create more novel, encompassing, and
efficient computer and other technical logic. In this process, one is compelled to
constantly engage in research that is designed not only to discover new facts, but
to invent new ways to establish logics that would become factually efficient. This
is  a  magic  circle.  The  more  we  constitute  new  logics  translated  into  material
implements, such as computers, smart phones, or digitalized systems, the more we
can  use  the  same  computers  to  open  up  new  logics  for  their  own  material
implementation. But the point of this magic circle is an increase in possibilities of
valuative selectivity. The latest computer machines can perform calculations that
previous  logics  were  incapable  of  performing.  In  this  sense,  the  very  latest
machines  can  instruct  us  about  the  possibilities  of  new  logics.
This means that the computer systems are themselves information, and indeed
selected information. First, the imbedded information is a particular logic of the

216   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
computer (the software); second, its specific material design (the hardware); third,
its  economic  system  of  values  and  the  modes  of  production;  and  finally,  the
options that it suggests. In this sense, the objectivity of the computer embodies
various levels of valuation. Those who acquire the latest machinery do not acquire
neutral means of processing and transmitting messages but also the messages of
computer logic, embodiment, economy, and basically an entire life-world and its
social  systems.  Moreover,  the  logic  of  the  programs  is  designed  to  process
information in specific ways. While the user is told that he or she is free to access
information,  the  information  is  mediated  by  the  logic  of  the  program,  the
economy of affordability by a specific group, in a specific part of the world, and
its purposive rationality that would dictate the programs and the messages that the
given  population  will  access.  In  brief,  the  objective  claim  that  computer
rationality is merely a means for anyone dealing with messages is inadequate to
what computer logic is all about. The logic of the latest software demands the
reproduction of hardware, leading to a constant rush for the latest technology. The
implication  is  obvious:  Vast  populations  of  the  world  would  be  called  upon
equally to engage in valuation. Do we want the latest hardware to match the latest
software? Or, do we want to protect the environment, to educate next generations,
to afford decent housing or medical care? It is the case that all things cannot be
accomplished at once, and to buy the latest hardware may have to be postponed in
favor of other human purposes and, therefore, to forego the receiving of messages
that are deemed to be objectively accessible for everyone. The introduction of the
computerized systems around the globe is not an innocent presence of a means to
acquire  information,  but  valuational  requirements  of  people  and  their
governments to deal with what is of greater value in a given society. In short,
there  is  nothing  wrong  with  the  logic  of  technologies  of  all  kinds,  with  their
objectivity;  yet,  we  must  also  recognize  that  they  are  value-siginitve  systems
whose transference to other parts of the world assume different value contexts.
It must be noted that the conditions for the possibility of globalization are not only
economic, psychological, and even ideological, but signitive. The reason for this
claim  is  that,  before  a  particular  people  in  a  global  economy  will  acquire  the
economic  conditions  to  better  their  lives,  they  have  already  been  informed
signitively of what a better life means. And the better life is the possession of
modern technology, specifically information technology, such as computers and
their logic, and above all, the value preferences imbedded in this logic. This logic,
in turn, is the end of temporality, the end of history; it is an all-encompassing
logic that can transmit its values to any village with promises of the production of
anything  that  the  logic  signifies  in  a  global  economy.  Of  course,  the  villages
would  be  able  to  access  the  information  once  various  technologies  become
available. The images open a life-world that is achievable through participation in
the  global  economy,  socialization,  forming  relationships,  and  building

Conditions For Public Decisions
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   217
education—in  short,  accepting  the  West.  Computerized  technology  is  the
metaphysical logic that has the power to accomplish this task. Of course, we shall
not make a judgment as to whether this accomplishment destroys or saves the
multiple ways people have lived or want to continue to live. This is to say, will
they be absorbed into the metaphysics of transformation of their environments in
order to join the global nexus, or will they be able to use the technical mass means
to maintain and defend their own cultural difference? This subtends the entire
discussion of multiculturism, environmental protection, and even the rights of
people to self-determination.
This means that the globalizing logic, with its technical efficiency and promises of
a better life, has become an aspect of the life-worlds of other civilizations. They
see themselves in relationship to this efficiency and liberation from want, poverty,
ignorance,  and  oppression,  and  reflectively  as  culturally  different  from  this
globalizing  logic.  This  creates  an  internal  tension  within  various  cultures  that
constitutes dual self-recognition. One still maintains his own cultural discourses
yet also judges those discourses in light of global images. This is the source of
alienation and the destruction of cultural self-identity. We still want to maintain
cultural identity, but we also like to be like the other, to judge ourselves from the
vantage point of the other, the West. This is an invention of a dual consciousness
that frames the power struggles within various cultures. The modernizers, who at
the same time claim to be part of their own culture, want to transform that culture
to be Westernized, practically efficient, objective, and beneficial to individuals,
liberating  the  individuals  from  their  own  ignorance,  and  yet  against  the
globalizing process, wanting to cling to the uniqueness of their own culture. In
one sense, there is a demand to use the environment purely as material for the
purpose  of  the  benefit  of  social  members,  whether  the  benefit  is  health,
employment, education, or increased wages as signs of the good life. In another
sense, there is a wish to claim that we in our culture have spiritual values that do
not allow us to reduce the environment, including the human, to mere resources.
Above, we saw two major compositions of incompatible civilizations; now, such
compositions form a context for the global tension between those who wish to
maintain their tradition—indeed, wish to reclaim some remote past—and those
who wish to look toward an open future and its possibilities. This tension is well
exhibited in the images of the Arab Spring, where huge crowds, forming a so-
called  “streetocracy”,  demonstrate  for  one  or  another  civilization,  for  one  or
another set of laws and constitutions—the secular or the autocratic. Europe is
equally  ambiguous—and  rightly  so—concerning  the  need  to  support  freely
elected  governments  in  the  Middle  East.  After  all,  some  are  purely  autocratic
(theocracies) and will not allow any introduction of Western aid, whether health
clinics, education or professional infidels. How does one abolish poverty—which

218   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
stands  at  40%  of  the  population—in  Iran  when  autocracy  will  do  anything  to
spend national wealth to acquire “the sword of Allah” to defeat the infidels and
hardly care for the impoverished? How does one deal with Turkey, where the
elected  government  wavers  between  autocracy  and  democracy,  and  provokes
mass demonstrations against efforts to establish autocracy by the very government
which was elected by those who are now demonstrating—as is the case in Egypt?
How does one address the issue of poverty in Myanmar, where “fundamentalist”
Buddhists are killing Muslims and pushing them into camps, thus creating new
regions  of  poverty?  But  the  same  principle  applies  in  all  variants:  Emerging
autocracies  (even  under  the  guise  of  fundamentalisms,  ethnic  or  sectarian
movements, or nationalist frenzy) tend to dismiss poverty in favor of their more
significant aims.
Within this tension, the adjudication cannot be had on the basis of some criteria
that would be able to decide which is more true. The only solution to this tension
is  power.  Hence,  we  witness  the  many  confrontations  between  groups  within
specific civilizations that promote Western modernizations and at the same time
fundamentalists that resist modernizations. This means that a specific civilization
is split into those who propagate the need to become globalized and modern and,
at  the  same  time,  those  who,  while  recognizing  the  necessity  of  this
modernization, wage a battle against it as an imposition of alien, modern Western
civilization. In principle, they claim that we may use the efficiency of modern
technology to resist the very logic that this technology imposes on us. In this
sense, the very globalizing logic constitutes a power confrontation, all the way
from  holy  wars  to  so-called  passive  resistances.  What  we  have  is  a  temporal
horizon  of  possibilities  in  such  a  way  that  one  possibility  is  regarded  to  be  a
recuperation  of  the  past,  while  the  other  is  offered  as  the  future.  Politically
speaking,  the  rhetoric  states  that  the  one  from  the  past  is  conservative  and
traditional, while the other is liberal, individualistic, open, and even humanistic.
In many cases, a partial division is between generations; the younger generations
opt for the open future, while the older want to hold onto the firmness of the past.
Perhaps  the  most  pronounced  tension  showed  up  with  the  appearance  of  the
global pandemic. On the one side is a science with its chemical inventions of
vaccines and preventions or cures, and on the other side are the believers who
look  toward  some  ancient  text  with  magic  words,  which,  when  spoken,  will
prevent the virus from being a danger. Any scientific cure is “the mark of the
Beast” or an invention to control humanity by the elite, and such. All one needs
are prayers to deflect the inventions of the secular devils, all the while using AI to
transmit  their  messages  to  the  faithful.  Of  course,  they  also  use  the
Enlightenment’s language of “freedom”, despite being humble slaves of the Lord.
In brief, there is a use of futuristic AI media to reclaim the “truths” of the past.

A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   219
Whether the views of the believers are true or false is not our concern. Yet, it is
generally claimed that those, in their dual consciousness, will play out their roles
as  both  maintaining  their  tradition  and,  at  the  same  time  proposing  future
transformations. At this point, a specific conception of the world is divided into a
closed  past  and  an  open  future.  It  is  important  to  note  that  this  conception
subtends or underlies Western modern globalization. Anything in the past can no
longer  be  changed,  and  therefore,  to  return  to  it  would  mean  to  return  to
something  changeless  and  thus  conservative,  while  the  escape  from  it  would
require an open and undetermined future. This is the confrontation between any
given tradition as a determined history and its rejection in favor of a constructed
and  undetermined  future.  It  is  of  note  that  modern  Western  globalization  is
characterized  by  the  shift  of  temporal  awareness  from  the  rejection  of  the
“irrelevant”  past  to  possibilizing  future.
SIGNITIVE SPACE AND TIME
Time  and  space,  wherein  we  locate  empirical  events,  is  accessible  only  as  a
signitive framework of sense-making to which everyone has access. Given that
we have no time machines to go from now into the future or the past, the only
access  we  have  to  both  of  those  temporal  components  is  the  immediacy  of
meaning and sense-making awareness. In this sense, the globalizing process of the
cybernetic revolution is based on our ability to communicate irrespective of place
and time on the globe because we know or understand what others mean. This
suggests  that,  dealing  with  computer  technology,  we  are  presented  with
immediate  access  to  the  entire  world,  not  because  of  our  capacity  to  be
empirically everywhere, but because of the technical capacity to make present the
meaning of events no matter how far or near.
Let us note that the reading of a message is prior to and pervades the empirical
means that transmit the message. Computer, as technological means, is an entity
in space and time, but it is designed to carry the presence of significations that
have  no  specific  space-time  positions.  This  would  be  analogous  to  the
construction of non-Euclidean space. The latter has no empirically given intuitive
component.  It  is  a  pure  system  of  formal  constructs  that  do  not  point  to  any
material,  mental,  or  other  “realistic  factors”.
What is appropriate to the theme of space and time is that the technical means that
embody the formal logic and its valuative subtext can be produced and set up
anywhere and anytime around the world. Yet, it is to be noted that such a setup
carries with it the social-cultural, economic, and technical life-world. Thus, the
First World imports and transfers the latest technologies to the developing world
in order to help “develop” the local populations, to make them aware of the rest of

220   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
the  world,  in  brief,  in  order  for  them  to  be  signitively  accessible  and  access
events, no matter where and when. This globalizing transference of technology
brings with it non-positional space-time to all who can afford the technological
means.  We  must  remind  ourselves  that  those  very  global  means  are  not  mere
empirical data or facts, but rather, they carry with them valuative conditions. For
modern Western understanding, values are deemed to be subjective, in contrast to
the objectivity of the empirical, and, as we have argued, to the logical-signitive
domain. Yet, the very selectivity of certain logics over others and their connection
to  the  events  is  valuative.  Exporting  computer  (and  other)  technologies  also
includes  the  export  of  values  imbedded  in  technologies.
METHOD
Having gone through modern Western civilization and the issues that will have an
impact on European engagement with other civilizations, it is important to start
“winding down” to a more concrete level and explicate a method that is equally
European but also with a universal appeal. It is well known, that for Europe, since
the  eighteenth  century,  reality  was  no  longer  something  present  but  the
“conditions  for  the  possibility  of  being”.  This  is  precisely  what  is  needed
methodologically to assist others in establishing conditions for their being—and
not necessarily only economic.
As is well known, some are economically self-sufficient, and yet they have vast
numbers of their population at the level of poverty. This means that other kinds of
“conditions” must be addressed—including the structure of closed civilizations
and  the  levels  at  which  dialogue  is  possible.  To  decipher  such  possibilities
requires a common methodology which would also access common awareness. It
is best to begin with the latter as an inevitable ground of diverse human actions
irrespective of civilizational interpretations.
There is a given in all civilizations that life—and in most cases—all events are
temporal, including the notion of permanent eternity wherein there is a promise of
all sorts of activities in “an eternal place”. It is noticeable that the “eternal place”
is present to awareness in the mode of “expectation”, and thus as one aspect of
numerous  other  expectations.  Expectations  of  what  is  possible  are  an  open
temporal horizon that can be narrowed to what is relevant and what is at present
irrelevant. In turn, awareness is extended as a “past horizon” which is equally
relevant  since,  in  some  civilizations,  the  past  horizon  might  be  restricted  to
specific stories or eminent texts that become equally relevant as to what shall be
selected as significant from the future horizon. Indeed, various tribal (African)
peoples are fearful of modernizations because younger generations are leaving for
better  living  standards  and  thus  leave  gaps,  and  disconnections,  in  family

Conditions For Public Decisions
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   221
continuity; in this setting, the older members will cease to have a place and thus
will vanish. Their continuous existence is their being co-present in all events as
members of complex, family-tribal relationships. Here, is a clear example of the
way temporal awareness overlaps, i.e., a past system of relationships is also a
determination of future relationships, and the latter depends on past relationships.
In  this  sense,  it  could  be  said  that  past-present-future  comprise  a  field
phenomenon of human active orientations. This is a way of saying that there is a
selectivity of activities that are deemed to be proper and exclusion of those that
are forbidden or irrelevant. As we shall see shortly, this kind of time does not
mean that humans make history—they are their history directly manifest in what
they  do  and  build.  The  field  of  active  time  is  not  connected  causally,  but
“meaningfully”, such that present events point to past and future events, i.e., they
“signify” them, forming what most European thinkers call a “life-world”. This
suggests that to understand a people, one must understand their life-world. Even
in the most beautiful and uncluttered life, events and people interconnect through
meaning:  This  plant  is  medicine,  and  that  animal  is  domestic,  while  the  one
growling at a distance is wild. One event signifies an entire field of other events,
equally with overlapping temporal awareness. The horizon of memory does not
reveal an entire past but makes leaps, connecting only the events, personalities,
and mythical figures as they are required in the temporal field.
Meaningful  connections  of  events,  coupled  with  the  difference  between
theoretical and field—vectorial—time, account for the fact that there is no one-to-
one correlation between the changes in the natural environment and its evaluation
in field time. Indeed, while natural events may change, their entering a life-world
as meaningful interconnections may remain the same, and conversely. This is one
part  of  the  methodology  being  unfolded  here—a  variation  of  natural  and
meaningful aspects. Thus, the so-called material conditions may be similar, yet
the temporal field of a life-world might signify such conditions very differently
from life-world to life-world within their horizons of possibilities. Such a horizon
is also open selectively where significant possibilities are selected and form a
context for the interpretation of events across future, present, and past, forming a
historical continuity that skips over the theoretical time of causal succession. Even
if events are past and causally no longer efficient, their significance is present, not
only as past but also as a factor in the horizon of what is possible.
Our  brief  delimitation  of  temporal—by  now,  vectorial—field  awareness,
pervading  a  given  life-world,  also  disclosed  the  presence  of  civilizations  as
traditions, that while devised in the past, are equally dominant in regulating the
future horizon and what is possible in it. It is the next task to articulate the field
time of action with its open horizons in terms of civilizational compositions and
the ways they may limit such horizons—what was already selected and what can

222   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
be selectable. It is equally important that the field time of action retains open
horizons and options that a given civilization has not considered, even if it were
not against its requirements.
Moreover,  an  open  horizon  must  remain  even  if  what  is  selected  from  it  as
possible comprises its limits; the comprehension of the latter is premised on the
presence of the horizon, and all that is possible but, for a given tradition, it is
impossible. Contemporary (and of course, many other) clashes and revolutions are
premised on the tensions of what there is as a life-world of a given tradition, and
what there is not—the open possibilities of a horizon that one tradition has closed.
One  can  think  of  the  “Arab  Spring”  that  is  still  “springing”  and  shifting  the
selectivities  of  what  is  possible—both  showing  the  limits  of  what  has  been  a
tradition and its horizons and what limitations are no longer acceptable. One can
also think of current autocracies in China, Russia, and the Middle East, where the
presence of AI possibilities in technologies are extolled, but they are used for the
total monitoring of the behavior of entire populations, and even for restricting
economic activities.
It ought to be obvious that within a context of a civilization and its traditional life-
world, not all possibilities are equally significant—some are more remote than
others,  and  some  are  not  even  available.  In  turn,  it  is  the  case  that  some
possibilities  in  a  given  life-world  are  not  realizable,  even  if  possible.  The
relationships between socially possible and impossible are quite complex. What
may  be  possible  politically  may  be  remotely  possible  or  even  impossible
economically,  and  what  is  possible  economically  might  not  be  possible
technically,  morally,  ontologically,  or  mythologically.  This  means  that  some
options might be excluded for the time being and “sink” into the horizon of the
past, and yet they might be reinstated as a future possibility given its shift in
significance  or  the  changes  in  moral  values  or  economic  distributions.  Such
changes  require  an  introduction  of  awareness  as  “time  reflex”.
As noted above, the limits of what a civilization, or in some of its remote corners
a tribe or society, can project, appear in terms of what is possible as reflected from
what is impossible. But the latter is what reveals options for a civilization from
another civilization, leading either to transformation or to a clash of civilizations.
It  is  the  case  that  in  contemporary  global  interaction,  such  time  reflexivity  is
unavoidable, despite the claims of positivistic sociologists that analyses of facts
do not indicate any transformations. Indeed, such sociology, without addition of
the  notion  of  the  life-world  and  its  horizontal  composition,  cannot  disclose
anything as a daily awareness, and the way it plays a role in constituting demands
for  change,  demands  for  “return”  to  some  eminent  text  and  its  prescribed
narrowing of the horizons and indeed precluding a dialogue. During one session at

Conditions For Public Decisions
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   223
the UNESCO conference in Vilnius (2001), a question of tolerance was raised;
there were Muslim scholars from Egypt and Iran, and they stated that, as long as
the West tolerates homosexuality, no dialogue will be possible between Islam and
the West. Within their horizon of what is possible, homosexuality is not possible,
and thus any question of its tolerance is to be rejected and, with it, a civilization
that allows this possibility to be part of its life-world.
It is now possible to sketch briefly the way time reflex is a primary method in
understanding various research ventures and what the researcher can offer as an
aid  without  too  much  disturbance  of  others’  life-worlds.  First,  the  dialogue
concerning the options and possibilities of a given life-world is in flux, and the
changing, expanding, or narrowing of temporal horizons also shifts the selectivity
and significance of events. This means, second, that the temporal horizon of the
future is a way to locate what is more significant from the past and how such
significance can be modified in terms of the needs that must be fulfilled. Third,
the past, as a tradition of a life-world with its own future horizon, may be opened
in terms of current events and yield new possibilities for the past—such as the
rereading of some eminent texts or making some previously insignificant sections
of  such  texts  become  significant,  or  even  in  case  of  a  group  that  depends  on
family or tribal stories. The latter may be enlisted as a way to interpret the novel
possibilities and thus become part of the fabric of the future. Hence, while moving
toward the future, research also establishes an orientation and selectivity of past-
present-future  events.  Fourth,  the  time  reflex  accounts  for  the  distinction  and
relationship between the presence of the past, the present of the present, and the
present of the future. Each present is available with its temporal horizons, which
intersect  and  are  continuous  with  those  of  other  presents.  This  accounts  for
historical presents as overlapping temporal fields that continue a specific tradition
of selectivities of the possible, the transformative, and how the latter comprises a
confrontation, intersection, and mutual transformation with other traditions. Any
reflexivity presupposes as its condition the distinction between what is currently
real and the temporally possible, the modalized. Thus, a particular social history
does not vary only in terms of the presently given and selected facts, but also in
constitutive conditions of selectivity based on temporal possibilities. The insight
into the selectivity of facts in any social process is a key to the constitution of the
relationship between social facts, their structures and the temporal horizons or
possibilities.
Our  most  limited  discussion  of  the  conditions  of  reflexivity  has  opened  the
possibility to consider further the shift of the concept of theory to a concept of
critical theory. The latter must:

224   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
1. Show how its very explanations of events will influence such events, since such
an explanation can be subsumed under reflexive process and its predictions either
enhanced or thwarted; and
2. Evaluate social events from a temporal horizon of possibilities showing what is
possible and what is impossible within a given social system and its sub-systems.
This means that a critical theory must correlate all factors and show how, in this
correlation,  some  possibilities  are  realizable,  others  probable,  and  still  others
made impossible. For example, it must show how an economic capacity may be
thwarted by a political incapacity, a moral stance or an economic misapplication;
or how an economic capacity, yielding certain options, may become impossible
due to a technological incapacity. At the same time, the critical theory must show
the limits of the possibilities of a social system and delimit what changes must be
instituted within certain social sub-systems to surpass the limitations. Thus, the
critical theory constitutes the most encompassing process of social reflexivity in
history and, ultimately, in the complexity of world time.
The  methodological  outline  as  time  reflexivity  can  now  be  regarded  in
relationship to any specific life-world and the way an intervention by another
civilization—the  Western—can  become  relevant  and  beneficial.  In  too  many
cases, efforts to assist in the transformation or partial reconstruction of a given
life-world  were  “external”  to  such  a  life-world.  Armed  with  all  the  good
intentions, with “advanced” knowledge of the latest instruments and expertise, we
tend to “build” for the indigenous population what it needs, and even if what it
needs might well be external to that life-world. They need a school, we shall build
one for them; they need a clinic, we shall establish one for them—most laudable
actions. But we cannot forget the basic principle discussed above: peoples in their
life-worlds are not external to them, and their very being is the reflexive time in
which field they understand themselves, the field in which they are co-extensive
with all that they do. What does that mean? It means that to build something, we
cannot build it for them, but we must do it with them—from the ground up, with
their full involvement, participation, and full cognizance of what the things we
bring will mean in their world.
Without  their  participation  in  building  their  world  and  temporal  horizons,  the
“development” will be an introduction to another life-world. We may offer access
to the internet, open all sorts of commodities that they can see but not reach, and
yet inspire expectations that show the radical discrepancy between what they are
and have and what they will not be able to have for the foreseeable future. The
disappointment is a sign that we have offered  expectations and yet  cannot  offer

Conditions For Public Decisions
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   225
their immediate gratification—thus we failed. In turn, going back to what this
population has and has been doing becomes equally dissatisfying.
Given these concerns, the needs of a given people in a given life-world must be
assessed in the following ways. Cultural context, including stories, myths, past
and  future,  their  values  and  expectations,  their  education,  skills,  and  local
hierarchy, are the framework for what the population can accomplish if some aid
is introduced and at what level such aid is most significant—for the time being.
This is where time reflexivity begins to appear: If, for example, a new health
clinic is to be established within a certain period—one year, then what sort of
education must some members of the society achieve within that span of time to
be able to manage and staff the clinic? If a school is to be established, can the
economic level maintain both the clinic and the school? Hence, there is a question
of  value  and  which  value  is  temporally  most  feasible  and  which  must  be
postponed, reflecting from the future possibility of economic improvement and/or
expected  aid.  The  latter  can  be  involved  from  a  broader  horizon,  such  as  a
regional government, as a reflexive agent, analyzing the options of present and
future investments and thus selecting which is of greater significance: schools or
local clinics. Yet, two things must be maintained: First, the local community must
be involved in making decisions and in building, since both activities comprise a
local  democratic  practice  and  direct  education  of  what  the  members  of  the
community  can  do,  such  that  their  very  doing  is  part  of  their  own  historical
continuity and responsibility. While this might seem simple, yet as a process of
decision-making and building also constitutes a ground of selectivity as to who
can do specific tasks, whose voice emerges as relevant and significant, and who
can speak to the foreign providers and advisors, and even to the regional officials.
This is “praxis” democracy. It is important to point out that all the grand efforts to
export  democracy  were  and  continue  to  be  failures.  Democracy  is  established
through concrete participation in building a history within a life-world that opens
horizons, unfolds possibilities, some of which might remain unfulfilled for the
time being but will be available with changing variables.
CONCLUSION
In all cases, education should take precedence since it is the site where horizons
open, where an understanding of complex issues get disclosed, where broader
intersubjectivity  is  constituted,  and  where  an  awareness  of  limits  becomes
available.  Education  is,  in  principle,  dialogical,  and  given  the  contemporary
means,  intercultural.  The  latter  is,  by  all  accounts,  a  most  significant  way  of
building  participatory,  global  democracy.  What  must  be  carefully  avoided  is
narrow,  technical  instruction  that  creates  “experts”  who  can  function  in  any
modern life-world. Their skills are homogenized and thus global. This means that

226   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
apart from technical sophistication, two aspects have to play a significant role:
integrating the new skills into the local life-world, its culture and values, and
opening the culture to intercultural dialogue. If technical education provides the
ability to advance economic well-being, cultural education is a way of eliminating
prejudices,  oppression,  and  violence.  Moreover,  technical  skills  alone  tend  to
create a segment of a population that becomes “nomadic” and even self-serving. It
is a constant reminder that, while technical education advances the possibilities of
well-being for those with globally needed skills, such abilities also lead to an
increasing gap between the well-off and the rest of the population. This means
that a broad and integral education, both cultural and intercultural, is a direction
that  might  prevent  the  so-called  “brain  drain”  from  emerging  economies  and
societies. We are certain that the European agencies, engaged in the field work of
foreign aid and education, can find a way of preventing such a drain.

CHAPTER 12
Radical Embodied Truths for Artificial Intelligence
Abstract: Embodiment distinguishes between two bodies, which are the body regarded
as a physiological entity, and the phenomenal body, which is not just somebody, some
particular  physiological  entity,  but  my  or  your  body  as  it  is  experienced.  It  is
understood as a phenomenal body. Nobody is an entity. Typically, one experiences
one’s body and potential capacity for doing this and that. Moreover, the sense that I
have my own body capacities is expressed in bodily confidence. It does not depend on
understanding the physiological process involved in performing the action in question.
The  distinction  between  the  objective  and  the  phenomenal  body  is  central  to
understanding the logical treatment of embodiment. Embodiment is not a concept that
pertains  to  the  body  grasped  as  a  physiological  entity,  but  rather  it  pertains  to  the
phenomenal  body  in  the  role  played  in  oriented  experience.  Fundamental  to
embodiment is space/time/motion and its manifestation of circularity of AI research/AI
researched.

INTRODUCTION
The notion of embodiment or “bodied minds” is meant to replace the ordinary
notion of mind and body, both as derivatives and abstractions. The lived body
relates to the space it lives in. It is already incorporated into the world, understood
as  the  horizon,  presupposing  a  form  of  understanding,  and  the  body  is  of  the
world in which it carries out its operation, and operant intentionality is established
with the world. That is, the corporal subject is inserted into a world that provokes
certain questions or problems that must be resolved. Therefore, one can speak of
motivation as part of the world—although not of necessity because the response is
not mechanical or determined between the movement of the body and the world.
No form of representation is established, but rather the body adapts to/adopts the
invitation of that world. The environment calls forth a specific body style, so the
body works with the environment, and included in it is the posture that the body
adopts in a situation.

TRUTHS
Truth 1
The  social  order  is  comprised  of  social  acts  which  have  fields  of  implication
which  extend  a-temporally  beyond  the  location  occupied  by  any  individual.
Individual  acts  then  become  relative  to  each  other—in  their  own  movement.
Every social act, therefore, outlines its own inherent limits. No social act can go
unmediated. This idea of integration is formed through a fundamental negativity
of mediated social relations. Every human act dimensionalizes itself through a
time-space movement. Therefore, every human act is related to an entire field or
network of human actions. The range of human acts dimensionalizes itself. Each
act is relative to the other, yet it is also correlative to a universal. Each act may be
relative  to  something,  which  is  absolute.  Each  absolute  is  such  because  of  its
correlation to the relative. Therefore, every act is relative to its time and space. It
is also integrative at the level of the difference between the relative acts. All social
acts have a temporal character, yet all are integrated at the a-temporal level. The
integration  is  accomplished  at  the  level  of  verticality.  The  notion  of  temporal
social  acts  extending  beyond  themselves  and  integrated  at  the  level  of  a-
temporality is based on the following ontological principles, which have been
derived from the concept of the sensuous universal:
1. The enduring inherence of a thing manifests itself temporally from different
perspectives.
2. The “more”, or the potentiality of a thing, is required for the explanation of new
qualities and non-reductionism.
3.  The  thing,  by  manifesting  itself  from  a  particular  perspective,  implies  its
context  and  its  specific  qualities.
These principles have led us to a general conclusion regarding the nature of social
order.
Truth 2
Each unified thing, displaying itself from a perspective, implies totality. Things
display  from  a  particular  perspective  and  correlatively  evoke  the  perspectival
manifestations  of  other  things  as  parts  of  their  context.  If  every  perspective
implies  a  whole,  ordered  through  the  inherent  unity  of  the  things,  then  every
human activity as ekstatic correlates to the world of things. The social order based
on the sensuous universal  is inseparable from its human existence (ekstasis). Soc-

Radical Embodied Truths
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   229
ial order does not exist other than in the historical totality of human products,
which reveal retroactively and pro-actively the character of the human (society).
Truth 3
The mode of overcoming a purely transitory human history is the organization of
knowledge. It is a historical enabling and a historical structure in excess of the
evolution of historical sensorial humans. The historical enabling is equivalent to
the I-can structure, which draws past things into the “living now” (present) and
surpasses the momentary. The past enters into the “living now” and constitutes the
present in a self-formative human nature. Historical epochs are not merely empty
discards in which human life has evaporated just because humans have reached a
“higher” plateau of development. The forms of development are incorporated into
the present through sensuous praxis—the creative universal activity of humanity.
The process of incorporation is an aspect of the apprehension of the past as it is
manifested in the future. It is also a limitation or critique. The past is intensified in
the “living now”, which is a form of sublation in dialectical thought. The social
order  is  shaped  in  terms  of  objectivity  and  subjectivity,  sensory  relations,
reification, and the ability of humans to “view” the world in its different modes.
Interestingly enough, within the Marxian legacy, the law of flux underwrites the
entire  enterprise;  yet,  Marx’s  work—as  well  as  that  of  Hegel  and
Heraclitus—continues to live in the concrete moments of the “living now” in the
form of permanence.
Truth 4
History  as  a  human  production  is  an  enduring  totalization,  in  which  human
activity incorporates, brings to life, and integrates the past in a social order which
is  not  only  the  production  of  the  “new”  but  also  a  reproduction  of  the  old.
Therefore,  totalization  is  an  intensified  retention,  a  process  of  production  and
reproduction—a renewal. The process of totalization is at all times a prerequisite
and a historical production; it is a differentiated and universalized capacity of
human  perception.  Therefore,  history  is  not  embodied  in  one  common  set  of
phenomena itself, but additionally, it is thought to be reflected in the relationship
that is implied to exist between that set and another.
Truth 5
The sensuous universal is the ground of all social life which is humanity itself.
The apprehension of a human by a human is a grasp of oneself invariantly through
one’s historicality. In short, the human can grasp himself/herself concretely and
sensuously  and  universally.  The  radical  human  is  the  apprehension  of  the
complementarity  of  historicality  and  universality—which  is  tantamount  to  the

230   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
reflexive ground of the social order. In terms of our thesis, we are fleshing out the
sensuous character of sensitivity—which is a continuation of the Marxian project
through the argumentation and description of the sensuous universal as the locus
where an “overlapping” or “folding over” of the human upon oneself occurs. The
sensitivity  and  the  sensibility  of  “the  human  for  oneself”  is  a  locus  where  all
typification and movement of things can be grasped because the human contains
all that the visible and tangible are capable of—which is precisely that: being
visible and tangible. The sensuous-human is a field where the sensible radiates
and dimensionalizes itself.
Truth 6
Radical sensibility has implications for social communication theory. The specific
character of any communication theory is that it must analyze and describe the
social relations of which it is itself a part. At the same time, it must be involved in
and aim at changing those very conditions. To make this claim, a view of history
is presupposed: history is a history of human practice and human limits. By being
a history of human practice, we avoid the trap of becoming a theory of vacuous
pragmatics. At the same time, such a view of history makes a specification of
history and a concrete insertion into it. All theory becomes a part of history, and it
is able to decipher ideologies, theories, and critiques, learning from other ongoing
forms of human action and their ensuing limits. Corporeal materiality is a process
of  continual  transformation  through  self-critique,  and  learning  from  human
practice is part and parcel of theory. This continual transformation is necessary in
order to come to grips with social-political situations which do change as the
result of theory as well as any other social intervention. If the theory is historical,
then  it  must  transform  itself  in  terms  of  the  situation  that  it  is  attempting  to
change.  Yet,  for  theorists  and  the  communication  enterprise  to  identify  itself
through its historical changes and to learn from its own practices, it must liberate
itself from the immediacy of its own historical insertion. If this is not possible,
then communication cannot engage in self-critique and thus judge its own limits.
Truth 7
Theory is always a theory of human practice. Theory must surrender to and place
in relief the lived situation—as opposed to simply being contemplative. Theory
which effaces itself in favor of its content is essential to a critical orientation and
its institutionalization. The motivation for the institutionalization of critique is
that,  within  our  human  life,  over-quantification  has  served  to  suppress  the
qualitative aspects in our lived world, which is correlative to the suppression of
the historical-temporal dimension. (This notion is a shared point of agreement
between phenomenology and Marx). The quantitative approach is a formalism

that  cannot  encompass  the  whole,  but  which  is  one-sided  rationalism  at  best.
Given that human social life does not live strictly by “numbers” but by socio-
economic, familial, aesthetic, ethical, and evaluative orientations, the rationalism
of  quantification  cannot  encompass  these  relationships  and  therefore  must  be
separated from the sphere of human concerns. The correction of this problem is
the reinstitution of teleology.
Truth 8
Reason without direction is abstract, and it lacks the telos of humanity, which is
guided by the unlimited development of the senses—or the achievement of the
sensuous universal. The aim of the achievement of the sensuous universal—or the
change toward a “new” humanity—is not possible without a reason for social
change.  Therefore,  theoretical  universality  is  a  critical  universal  praxis.  The
theoretical  attitude  is  unified  with  praxis  in  concrete  ways.  When  we  ask  a
question regarding the sense of social events or powers in society which affect our
lives,  the  question  aims  at  a  significance  that  extricates  us  from  our  total
immersion in everyday life. The reflection upon the question, “What’s happening
in my life?” is theoretical. The search for significance aims at the transcendental
level, which is required for every critique within history. Critique is a questioning
and  a  self-interrogation  of  the  state  of  affairs—a  search  for  the  sense  of  the
situation.  Critique  requires  a  transcendental  aim.  Habermas’  Knowledge  and
human interests (1971) was an attempt to abandon the transcendental significance
due  to  its  quasi-static  nature.  But  a  problem  arises  regarding  the  historical
dimension of praxis and the unification of theory with praxis. The unification of
theory  and  praxis  is  a  form  of  universality  which  is  neither  a  metaphysical
naturalism nor a logistic-theoretical formalism, but rather a universality which is a
transition from the theoretical to the practical, thus comprising a synthesis. In this
sense, theory can be of service and significance to the lived world—the sensuous
world in which we live.
Truth 9
Theory is a critical evaluation of the human practice concerned with the truth of
the situation in which we discover ourselves. Theory is directly related to the
changing of the human toward a new humanity, which is the transformation of
human practice in terms of the “new” humanity. In terms of our thesis, the very
possibility  of  theory  requires  this  universality.  The  transcendental  is  always
something that has been or remains to be accomplished. What is accomplished as
a social reality is always reflected by the implications of the future (the not-yet).
Thus, mediation occurs outside of a real relationship. If this were not the case,
theoretical thought would not be possible since all theoretical relationships would

232   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
be  immersed  in  the  environment  and  would  never  gain  the  required  distance
(verticality)  necessary  to  articulate  the  social  situation  and  make  sense  of  it.
Truth 10
Every orientation is a temporal one. This means that socially or intersubjectively,
the  experienced  field,  which  we  assume  from  a  particular  point  of  view,  is
polycentric;  others  participate  in  structuring  my  field,  as  I  do  in  theirs.  The
polycentric field is temporally oriented. The sense of experience in its encounters
with things of the world is temporal. Through social institutions, sensibilities are
extended; hence, we borrow experience from others—our predecessors, and our
experience will extend into the future to be incorporated by others into their fields
of polycentricity. From the beginning of our lives, we are placed into a world, and
that world is one that bears concrete historical praxis. We are born into a world of
chairs, cradles, houses, hammers, and language, all of which are taken up into the
historical process. Our contemporaries and those of previous times appear in the
form of the hammers which they made, in the cost of the tools, and so forth.
Before we have any questions concerning the abstract meaning of history, we are
in a field of historical entities and styles of comportment. Institutions, too, are
human products and hence change mutually with the human experience within the
lived world. We are stressing that the sensuous-praxis, which is embodied in the
world of implements, is “materialistic” but in a materialism of praxis, and in these
relations  lies  the  source  of  theoretical  thought.  It  is  at  the  level  of  social
relationships  that  the  task  or  aim  is  established—to  open  the  horizons  of
transformations  for  change—within  and  based  on  the  implications  of  the
relationships  of  the  lived  world.
Truth 11
The other points out new perspectives on the world of things and correlatively
exposes new possibilities in us. We can say that there have been persons whom it
has been beneficial to know. In other words, they have revealed themselves to us,
and correlatively they have opened new fields of sensibility for us. The world has
been enriched through a new perspective. Intersubjectivity has its value in the
mutual contribution to the discovery of the world of things through our various
activities.
Our activity is directed by symbolized sensibilities, yet we express an original or
“creative” relationship to things by following the lines of implication, which point
to  new  perspectives  and  our  self-understanding.  In  our  view,  the  sensuous
universal  is  an  evaluative  criterion  for  social  progress.

Radical Embodied Truths
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   233
Truth 12
Social progress cannot be arbitrary but rather is dependent on the implications of
the world of things. The embodiment of a symbolized sensibility contains more
than the intention of the subject or a group of subjects because it is an objective
perspective  on  things.  Sense  implies  more  than  the  particular  intention  of  the
subject  because  it  does  not  depend  upon  the  subject’s  projection.  The  subject
correlates  him/herself  to  it  and  expresses  it  through  activity.  Only  if  the
symbolized sensibilities are stored perceptual sensibilities of things with their own
implications can social productions direct the subject to future development.
Based  on  intersubjective  foundations,  the  subjects  in  each  society  create  their
world and determine the kind of reality each social order has. But there is no
criterion  provided  between  advanced  or  culturally  richer  times  and  culturally
inferior times. Hence, each social order and its age are equally absolute. This is
not a satisfactory perspective. History has shown that social orders differ. How is
this  possible  for  us—embedded  in  a  particular  culture—to  understand  other
cultures? In terms of our discussion of the consciousness of perceptual sense,
limited perspective and totality, we can present a criterion for the advancement,
differentiation, and development of societies.
Every society, by developing certain perspectives of the world of things, is open
to the implications of future development, or the more. In our view, the same
world  of  things  can  be  expressed  in  many  ways,  dependent  upon  an  adopted
perspective. This allows us to understand different societies from the perspectives
of the subjects of other social orders. We can enter their perspective and interpret
ourselves in terms of it.
We have determined that the possibility of our understanding of other societies
indicates  something  common  between  them:  the  commonness  in  the  world  of
things,  with  its  different  perspectives  and  characteristics.  A  methodological
problem that phenomenological social science must face is this: If one theorizes
that the subject is a product of his/her society, then the theory one holds about
societies  cannot  be  generalized  as  applicable  to  all  societies.  If,  as  we  claim,
societies depend on the perspectives of the world of things in terms of which the
subjects within a given society interpret themselves, then it is evident that subjects
from  one  society  are  capable  of  understanding  those  of  other  societies.  The
possibility of viewing the world of things from that other perspective opens our
own  horizons  and  presents  new  possibilities  for  self-understanding.  Hence,  a
multitude  of  societies—or  realities,  or  “world  views"—does  not  deny  the
necessity of ontological things. In short, based on the sensuous universal thesis,
multiple  worldviews  or  multiple  realities  are  nevertheless  views  of  the  same

234   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
world. Based on this criterion of one-world, we can indicate that the changes in
humanity throughout history have depended upon the different relationships that
humans have had toward the world of things which, correlatively, reveal different
human possibilities.
Truth 13
Social  research  requires  a  criterion  to  determine  whether  certain  research  is
adequate, if the model is partial in its selectivity of phenomena, and if the aim of
the research will have any value for understanding social action. The criterion
must include assumptions about the norms, the sense of social action, and what is
to be realized by such social action. This means that a methodologist must reflect
on his/her model to check its presuppositions. For example, a social scientist may
base his/her model on the economic activities of social members. This researcher
may evaluate the sense and aims of a family, but only in economic terms. Yet, a
family—which has socially required rules of behavior, views, and a sense of its
activity—defines itself in terms of cohesion. This means that the researcher must
value that particular sense of family and not truncate the familial interpretation. In
other words, the sensuous universal demands that self-expression is valid and that
it reveals different possibilities.
Indeed,  we  are  products  of  our  socio-cultural  milieu,  but  we  are  not  merely
products.  Since  we  have  stored  socio-cultural  sensibilities  which  have
implications, we can follow them and gain a greater knowledge of the world of
things. Furthermore, being in primordial contact with the world, we can reveal
new perspectives and allow the vectors of implication to direct our social actions
toward new horizons.
Our thesis of the sensuous universal indicates that, although we do not have a total
knowledge,  we  can  increase  our  knowledge  of  humans  while  engaged  in  the
process  of  opening  their  capacities—widening  their  relationship  to  the
perspectives of the world of things. The opening of new perspectives gives rise to
new  sensibilities  in  terms  of  which  those  persons  can  then  act  and  express
themselves.
Truth 14
There is an inherent problem that confronts any theory that posits “the human” as
a totally historical being, determined by his/her time and culture. The problem is
that, if a human is historically determined, then the theory which claims to be a
product of a given culture is applicable only to that culture. But the problem goes
much deeper. In our discussion of the sensuous universal, we have proposed that,
in order to know a perspective, we need to transcend it. To know a given society

Radical Embodied Truths
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   235
or culture, we must transcend the society or culture. In order for us to grasp the
subject as a historical being, we must be capable of transcending this position. To
make the claim that we are “historical beings”, we need a non-historical view of a
subject—who possesses all the possibilities revealed in history and who implies
other  possibilities  to  be  realized  in  the  future  in  terms  of  humanity’s  future
relationship  to  the  differing  perspectives  of  the  world  of  things.  Different
historical periods are expressions of the different possibilities of what a human
being is from a particular perspective. To grasp the distinct periods of human
history, we must, at the same time, understand the nature of humanity expressing
itself throughout history.
Truth 15 (a)
Theory  based  on  the  argument  that  every  part  is  connected  to  the  whole  is
interested in establishing the conditions for the possibility of something. In this
sense, theory in terms of the sensuous universal is not “explanatory” but rather
expository of the necessary requirements without which something could not be.
Thus, theory ranges beyond what is commonly understood to be in the present.
Rather, “theory as expository” can investigate “the conditions for the possibility
of theories themselves”. These conditions are not empirical/factual but structural.
For instance, while one may know all the empirical facts about Karl Marx, these
facts will yield neither Marxism nor the structural conditions for Marx’s theory of
species-being.
Truth 15 (b)
Theory, once it has been located in history and has achieved an awareness of its
own history, loses the privileged status as extra-social or extra-historical, which
surveys events indifferently. Rather, theory functions in society as history and
changes its very “objects” of explanation. This means that, if we can assume that
events  influence  history,  then  social  science  as  an  event  influences  history,
thereby admitting that all theoretical determinations participate in the influence of
its  objects  of  investigation.  Hence,  the  sensuous  universal  posits  society  as  a
whole of which it is one part; in turn, they reciprocally imply each other. Thus,
the  sensuous  universal  demands  that  theory  has  a  critical  or  evaluative
component. Therefore, theories based on the sensuous universal must adhere to
Truth 16 (a and b).
Truth 16 (a)
The theory must show how its very explanations of events will influence those
events.  This  can  be  done  because  an  explanation  can  be  subsumed  under  the
reflexive process, and its prediction can be enhanced or truncated.

236   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
Truth 16 (b)
The  theory  must  also  evaluate  social  events  from  a  horizon  of  possibilities
showing what is possible and what is impossible within a given social situation.
This means that social theory must correlate social factors and show how, in these
correlations, some possibilities are enhanced, truncated, and others emerge. These
possibilities are determined by the sensuous universal paradigm of the limited and
the more. For example, theory can show how economic capacity may be curtailed
by political incapacity, a moral stance, or even the misapplication of economic
theory. In addition, theory based on the sensuous universal is critical; it must
show the limits of the possibilities of a social situation and delimit the changes
that  must  be  instituted  within  particular  situations  in  order  to  surpass  those
limitations. Therefore, social theory (and all social scientific theory) based on the
sensuous universal encompasses the social-historical process. This encompassing
process is more than the social-historical inasmuch as it is of the social-historical
and yet aware of its own specificity. This awareness is a transcendental condition
that  allows  us  to  reflect  upon  a  concrete  situation  and  correlate  it  to  diverse
factors.
Truth 17
The theory of the sensuous universal can be understood as a phenomenology of
materiality—not in a merely physical sense, but in the sense of praxis, which
deals  with  work,  implements,  humanly  established  directions,  and  ethical
relationships, e.g., helping someone to move from one’s home or walking a child
across  the  street.  For  example,  as  a  materialism  of  praxis,  what  is  written  on
government banners becomes irrelevant. Rather, we must look at the concrete-
sensual relationship and institutions in which we live. The sensuous-relationships
are  sources  of  theoretical  and  categorical  distinctions.  The  concrete  task  of
sensuous universal theory opens the limits for the transformation and expansion of
sensuous-relationships as they are determined in the lived world.
The evaluative character of theory is foreign to traditional social theory, as is the
methodological  posture  of  positing  society  as  a  sensuous  universal.  The
methodological posture of positing society as universal and theory as sensitivity
reveals  an  inner  dialectical  or  dialogical  structure  in  the  methodology.  This
methodological posture is based on corporeal intentionality which demands that a
sociological principle be founded. The principle is that social research must be
capable of being used by its “subjects” for their own self-understanding. This
principle assumes that the “objects” of social research are co-subjects who are of
interest. The co-subjects are not merely of interest as entities, where behavior is to
be observed and explained, but they are of interest as partners in communication

Radical Embodied Truths
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   237
with each other and with the researchers. Therefore, communication research’s
objects are co-subjects who must incorporate their objects and their concerns into
the communication community. A social theory based on the (dialogical) principle
cannot help but evaluate the aims of human action.
Truth 18
Human speech has a socio-historical embodied sense that all speaking is trying to
communicate  about  something.  We  must  eschew  the  psychological  notion  of
language, which claims that “what can be meant can also be said”. This contains
the notion, borrowed from ordinary language philosophy, that speaking is also “a
making”. This means that language presupposes an ideal meaning to be expressed,
and as soon as we devise the appropriate terms, there can be a full articulation and
“doing” of the world. This notion of language is non-historical and presupposes a
world which is pre-given and things that are reified. We are not contesting that we
need meaning, that we need speech acts, and that our speaking influences our
doing.  However,  notions  regarding  idealized  speaking,  the  pre-givenness  of
meaning,  and  the  pre-givenness  of  a  fixed  world  lead  one  to  the  “class”
characteristics of language. For example, in interviewing an ethnic population,
such  as  African  Americans,  or  workers,  an  interviewee’s  inability  to  use  “the
appropriate language” is not a distortion of the social world, nor does it mean that
the individual is incompetent. Rather, it means that the person’s speech is bound
to his/her corporeal situation in which he/she is expressing the qualitative sense of
that world. The very language employed effaces itself, revealing and expressing
the world to which that person belongs. A theoretical implication of the sensuous
universal is that one’s language is not merely a speech act; it also depends upon
the class into which one has been born and upon the way that social class has
produced  language  through  historical  experience.  Various  speech  acts  are
implied or required by the language which one finds as a part of one’s concrete
relationships.  The  development  and  understanding  of  class,  ethnic,  and  other
relationships in an intersubjective world must rest on their corporeal relations to
the world of things.
Truth 19
Any critique of social relationships or the language employed must be based on
the speaker’s specific linguistic modes—which is precisely what is meant by “the
corporeal situation”—and any ideality must be established in terms of the lived
context. It is impossible to translate a linguistic term into “the” meaning. It is
possible only to translate it into another concrete situation within the historical
and institutionalized language. As communication theorists, when we understand
another in terms of a class or a social role, we are dissecting the social field and

238   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
affirming a series of social traits, roles, or classes. These make up a social field of
synchrony in which a sensibility spreads. The experience of an individual of a
particular class is not strictly the experience of this particular individual alone; the
sensuous vectors implicate all other possible individuals who operate in a certain
way.
In addition, the experience of individuals of a class is only possible within the
field of other possible social classes through which a particular social class is put
into relief. At the same time, this social class has a depth, which implicates a
horizon belonging to the total sensibility of ourselves and our species: emotional
people,  warm  or  cold,  stingy  or  greedy,  dull  or  brilliant,  and  so  on.  The
segregation of a particular social role or class universalizes itself, thus inviting the
operation of all sensibilities and the spread toward generality, which is accessible
by  anyone,  anytime,  anywhere.  At  the  transcendental  level,  categories  are
accessible  as  sensuous  and  spread  through  a  field  of  free  association.
Methodologically,  we  must  be  mindful  of  the  sensuous  generality  of  the
individual.
Truth 20
The  social  person  may  be  distinguished  from  the  individual  person,  who  is
composed of individual acts, aims, and directions. The individual founds his/her
social behavior in an activity of a “higher” order. This social personality may be
characterized in various ways. One’s personality is founded on a higher order than
that  of  the  individual  because  one’s  personality  is  not  limited  to  one’s  own
activities, but also contains the historically sensuous-incorporation of activities
provided  by  others.  When  two  individuals  communicate,  they  mediate  each
other’s views and experiences and together comprise a basis for communication to
an  indefinite  number  of  individuals.  The  social  personality  is  of  a  concrete,
“higher order” because it incorporates not just the activity of an individual, but
also  the  activities  of  various  individuals  whereby  the  interrelationship  of  the
activities  constitute  something  “more”  than  the  sense  of  individual  acts;  they
influence and change one another. In the process of corporeal interaction, the
individual persons in their relationship influence and change one another, which
in turn yields a more encompassing awareness that belongs to both—or even to
more—individuals.
The relationship between the individual and the social (or higher-order individual)
can  be  depicted  through  an  analogy  with  musical  notes  and  melody.  Without
musical  notes  (individual  sounds),  there  is  no  melody.  The  sounds  are  the
foundation of melody; but, in forming the melody, the sounds create a higher
order which is not identical to the sum of sounds. This is not to imply that the

Radical Embodied Truths
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   239
sounds lose their individuality. The contribution of each sound is recognizable,
yet their internal communication, which forms a melody, also creates an order
which can be perpetuated even if the individual notes are changed. Analogously,
this constitutes continuity of the social order, yet in such a way that the individual
and his/her contributions are always presupposed.
Truth 21
The social-communal comprises the phenomenological category of “we”, which
consists  of  the  accumulated  sensual  relationships  and  mutual  influences  of
activities sedimented through history where the very names of the actors have
been  forgotten.  Yet,  the  bearers  of  the  names  are  the  founders  of  the  social
dimension; in turn, their contemporaries are also founders—and at the same time
carriers—of  that  dimension.  Here,  the  function  of  a  carrier  is  not  a  mere
transmission of a tradition; rather, it adds an experiential perspective or a shift of
meaning to the whole fabric of society. The experiential aspect allows us to move
beyond the phenomenological sociology of Alfred Schutz, in that experientially,
while “being in society”, we are also capable of “facing society”. While being
influenced by society, we in turn influence society as well. We not only accept and
follow what is socially common; we also question and interrogate the “communal
spirit”,  accepting  it  or  rejecting  it.  There  is  an  interaction  not  only  among
individuals which form the foundations for society, but there is also one between
the individual and society.
The solution to the problem of social order is also offered on another level. While
being  engaged  in  the  world  as  individuals,  aware  of  our  individuality  and  its
various  attitudes,  habits,  and  conceptions  about  the  world,  we  simultaneously
confront the world which is “humanized”. Every institution, every implement,
street sign, utterance, and book has a presence pervaded by human experience
which, while not our own, is still accessible to us. As we have already shown,
experience is universal. The constitution of society and the accessibility of any
experience to everyone comprise the foundation of the human communication of
sensibility, and the communication of sensibility enhances the development of the
individual as a social (sensuous universal) being.
Truth 22
The  ontological  thing  is  a  necessary  prerequisite  for  the  explanation  of  the
coherence of cooperative experience, which is fundamental to species-being. The
thing  can  be  grasped  from  an  unlimited  number  of  perspectives.  Hence,  the
subject can act in terms of a perspective which correlates to the affective qualities
of things. The subject relates to things as a total being.

240   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
The  total  subject  is  a  conscious  being  who  has  an  indefinite  set  of  capacities
which manifest the subject from a particular perspective. While manifesting the
subject, the capacities are correlates of the perspective of things and thus present
the different characteristics of things to the conscious subjects. Thus, the total
subject is a process of:
1. The manifestation of the subject in and through his/her actualized capacities
which are expressions of the subject; and
2. The actualization of the subject’s capacities, which correlate to the particular
perspective of things, expressing the things to the subject. The process of the
subject’s self-manifestation in and through an increasing number of capacities
“totalizes” the subject’s self-expression of things to the subject.
Totality is a process toward the maximum self-expression of the subject in terms
of the maximum expression of the world of things to the subject. The subject,
acting in terms of a thing from a particular perspective, expresses oneself as a
whole  in  a  limited  manner.  The  idea  of  totality  is  not  merely  a  direction  for
cognition. It is inherent in subjective activity, which is a mediation between the
conscious subject and the things with their total implications. It drives human
action from its limited character, as perspectival and partial self-expression, to the
more. These more (or indeterminate) possibilities loom, so to speak, on every
horizon of the subject’s life and indicate one’s present limits while continuously
implying other possibilities.
Truth 23
The subject is a synthesis of one’s particular character, humanity, and one’s total
possibility of what one can be. It is the telos of the individual and cannot be
reduced to anything else. The particular perspective that the individual assumes
toward oneself is the presence of the subject to this humanity. Human activity is a
particular self-interpretation in terms of the world of things, which is a perspective
of the total possibility of one’s humanity.
Human action renews itself and is driven forward by an indeterminate quest for
totality. It is a striving for totality which is a process of the continuous expression
of the subject’s capacities in terms of the world of things and, correlatively, an
expression of the world of things to the subject.
If the sensuous level of society is co-extensive with the world of things, and social
order is developed through the communication of sensibility, then the individual
is developed as a sensuous universal being.

Radical Embodied Truths
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   241
Truth 24
We have claimed that the thing manifests itself in and through its perspectives.
Perspectives  are  the  temporal  manifestations  of  the  unified  thing.  The  thing
becomes in and through its perspectives. The thing is a synthetic unity which is in
the  process  of  self-manifestation  in  correlation  to  its  context.  The  present
perspectives of the unified thing stand in a horizon of consequences. The sensible
is not one perspectival meaning of the thing, but also the implications to the past,
the  future,  and  to  the  thing’s  context.  In  short,  we  have  a  field  of  sensible
perspectives  or  expressions  of  the  thing  which  are  implied  in  the  present
perspective.  These  are  not  formal  implications,  but  content  implications.  The
principle of relevance indicates the relevance of the context in which things exist.
Whatever action we may attribute to the thing through its perspective, we cannot
conceive of it outside its context.
From this viewpoint, we observe a horizon-like fusion between the thing and the
action which the thing undergoes from other things. We can say that the thing
undergoes actions and transmits them. For things, the distinction from every other
thing is never perfectly realized. They possess a relative unity and independence.
The thing supports itself on the multitude of things surrounding it. The individual
thing  is  a  relative  subsistence.  The  thing  exists  within  a  context,  and  the
implication of its context is identical to the relevance of the context for the thing’s
existence. It must be clear that not everything within the context is relevant to the
thing.  Relevance  indicates  what  is  needed  for  the  thing’s  continuation  in
existence. For example, equality is symbolic “of the need for more” of something
in the situation.
Truth 25
Relevance  in  phenomenology  is  relevance  for  the  subject.  From  the  social
phenomenological  viewpoint,  relevance  denotes  a  relationship  in  which  the
concrete objects are relevant to the subject’s plans and designs (Schutz, 1962-
1966). A particular thing is relevant not to other things within a context, but to the
subject and his/her projects. Such a view is not acceptable. If relevance were not
basically a contextual relationship among things, then it would be impossible to
determine  how  things  could  be  integrated  into  a  system  of  relevance  for  the
subject. We must remember that on the basis of the sensuous universal, sense
inheres in things.
The principle of relevance can be explicated further through meaning. It must not
be assumed that the context makes the thing ultimately meaningful as though the
thing were a conjunction point of a system of sensible relations. As we recall, the

242   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
thing as a whole is a synthetic unity, and the qualities express the sense of the
thing  in  a  particular  way  or  from  a  particular  perspective.  This  particular
perspective is expressive of the thing and is grasped by perceptual activity as
“perceptual sense”. It is the unity of the thing which gives unity and synthesis to
its  manifested  perspectives  and  correlatively  gives  unity  and  synthesis  to  the
perceptual  meanings.  The  context  actualizes  the  thing’s  specific  sense  from  a
perspective through which the relevance of the context is indicated. It can be said
that the specification of the sense of the thing, within its context, depends upon
the perspective of the thing which is revealed by the context. This means that the
complete  knowledge  of  the  unified  thing  requires  the  knowledge  of  the
manifestation  of  the  sense  of  the  thing  in  differentiated  and  relevant  contexts.
Although the particular manifestations of the thing within a context do not totally
determine what the thing is, they present a perspective of the thing correlative to
the particular context. For example, a building is not seen only as a building, but
also as a courthouse, implying a total context which is relevant to it: it relates
itself to trials, police enforcement, judges, lawyers, and such. The relevant context
is thus correlated to the particular perspectives of the thing. The manifestations of
the thing, within a particular context, yield a perspective of the thing.
Truth 26
By employing the sensuous universal’s principle of relevance, we determine that
each thing in context implies its context, and things of the context imply their own
context;  therefore,  there  is  a  continuity  toward  totality,  which  means  that
sensibility  is  self-referencing.  Things  imply  their  relevant  context  and  other
things, which in turn imply their contexts. The continuous implication of things
and their contexts means that a particular thing implies a totality, and correlatively
a thing leads the subject in his/her cognition toward the cognition of the totality
implied by the thing and its context. Hence, relevance is not merely a centripetal
movement but a centrifugal one as well. Only by adding the centrifugal aspect are
we able to understand Schutz’s notion of the pursuit of happiness as a relationship
to a social world of things and not merely as a relative definition. Rather, all
relative definitions are relative to something which is not relative. In turn, the
notions of equality and inequality are symbolic of something which unifies the
relative definitions. Equality is relative to a situation which, in experience, is an
absolute  or  unequivocal  experience.  Therefore,  the  experience  of  equality  is
symbolically  relevant  to  the  things  of  situational  concern  and  their  sensible
implications  (which  are  universal).

Truth 27
Tying the transcendental to the mundane is necessary for any critical theory or
critical  evaluation.  The  priority  of  the  transcendental  is  the  first  priority  of
methodological critique. Without the transcendental, critical theory is impossible;
the  natural  attitude  could  not  be  revealed;  method  could  not  be  evaluated;  no
progress could be made, nor could the sensuous be transmitted. We must not fall
into  the  trap  of  a  form  of  reflection  which  neglects  the  transcendental.  The
concept of reflection that is often used by cultural studies overlooks the fact that
the “inner turn” of intentionality cannot elevate the co-given reflecting process to
a thematic object at the time of reflection. This “turning back” occurs effectively
in language as it is spoken. One cannot step behind it; at best one can incorporate
it. The sensuous as a mediation on the world does not have a natural necessity in
itself. It remains contingent and constitutes a tradition which is not ruled by any
laws of being.
The sensuous universal demands transcendental truths according to which it can
describe,  analyze,  and  compare  empirical  investigation.  By  means  of  this
procedure,  we  are  able  to  see  that  the  concrete  life-world  is  all.  Its  relative
structure has a general structure. The general structure or transcendental structure
is that to which everything that exists relatively is bound yet is not relative. We
can attend to it with sufficient care, and it is equally accessible to all.
The sensuous universal is that which is formal and general, and which remains
invariant in the lived world throughout all alterations of the relative. The sensuous
universal is the invariant form of all world-lives and worldviews and reveals the
essence of all communication theory and all social science—the comparative. The
sensuous universal is the condition which allows the exchange of information
between specialists and the lay public, European cultures and American cultures.
In other words, there is a common structure between them. In every particular
world in which one plays a role, one has the world as the horizon of totality which
encompasses all particular horizons which are determined by specific interests. In
relation to this unity, everyone has his/her own world.
On the other hand, what allows comparison is specifically the fact that everyone
who  has  a  world  is  limited.  Limits  are  a  transcendental  condition  for  people
having different cultures, and they are the condition for different cultures to have
something in common. The invariant in all conceivable worlds must be present as
something  which  is  shared  before  all  differences  of  particular  worlds.  This
invariant must be that which is the beginning of all communication. This invariant
structure  is  the  transcendental  structure  of  the  sensuous-bodily-movement,  the
sensuous universal. The comparative transition rests upon this structure. Any life-

world is in itself a sensuous universal, inasmuch as a life-world is a way of saying
that one has the world and the possibility of all comparative worlds. To the extent
that  social  science  does  not  thematize  the  most  general  conditions  for  their
activity,  they  are  immersed  in  the  “natural  attitude”.  The  sensuous  universal
invites comparisons and is the condition for social science to be comparative. The
sensuous universal is the fundamental principle for all truths or “new truths”.
Truth 28
Praxis  is  the  embodiment  of  self-consciousness  and  affirms  a  science  of
experience.  A  science  based  on  concrete  praxis  or  experience  is  a  corporeal
science.  A  corporeal  science  exhibits  the  virtues  of  articulating  experience
(immediacy) and pure movement—human motility, shaping nature in accordance
with  human  requirements.  Marx  (1967)  supplies  us  with  a  paradigm  for  the
realization  of  the  sensuous  universal  through  the  dialectical  relationship  of
concrete universal and particular-abstract. Concrete and abstract are relational in
the manner of wholeness (totality) and partiality. The fully-developed is concrete,
and something that is partially developed is abstract. The dialectical relationship
of abstract-concrete is a paradigm of universal sensibility. Hence, the task of a
corporeal science is to assume the ideal of the universally concrete. This means
that science, or philosophy in Marx’s sense, would become experience-based—or
world-based—requiring sensuous-bodily motility.
This  project  is  exactly  what  Merleau-Ponty  had  in  mind,  as  evidenced  in  his
works,  especially  The  visible  and  the  invisible  (1968).  The  epistemological
foundation employed by Merleau-Ponty is corporeal intentionality. Fundamental
to the project is the articulation of the concrete experience of things. Conscious
activity is explicable in terms of things and their relationship to the body-subject.
The conscious subject manifests himself/herself in terms of the world of things.
There is a correlation between the thing and its perspectives and the activity of the
body-subject. The conscious body-subject, while grasping the thing as a whole,
expresses  the  thing  only  from  a  limited  perspective.  The  thing  and  the  body-
subject are both expressed in a limited manner. The importance of understanding
limitedness in a corporeal way is that humans are capable of transcending the
limits and opening up more perspectives. Hence, while looking at a thing from
one  side,  sensing  it  through  perspective,  the  other  sides  are  “sensed”  by  the
sensible things surrounding the particular thing of my concern. I sense the thing
“globally” by virtue of the sensibility embodied in the sensed things. Perspectival
sensibility is chiasmed with the perspectival sensibility of everything. A thing
manifesting  from  a  particular  perspective  implies  totality.  This  sensibility
universalizes  itself:

Radical Embodied Truths
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   245
1. The experience of a sensed thing is not an experience of mere particularity, but
it implicates all possible things of the same order. This is a corporeal or sensible
style of operating.
2. The experience of a particular is only possible within a field of implication. The
particular implicates the universal field. At the same time, the universal field has a
“depth”, which implicates a horizon belonging to the total sensibility of ourselves
and  our  species.  A  sensibility  invites  tactile  and  psychological  sensibilities,
thereby  indicating  total  corporeality.
Truth 29
Thus, sensibilities communicate with each other and provide limitations toward
generality  and  a  depth  (or  fundamental  negativity)  which  further  invites
exploration by anyone, anytime, anywhere. The movement of sensibility to its
generality is the condition for the possibility of the species and of all social life.
The  sensual  universal  is  transcendental.  It  is  transcendental  because  it  is  the
condition for the possibility of experience accessible to all, anytime, anywhere.
The transcendental is a species condition. In its movement toward generalization,
it  presumes  that  any  experience  (color,  emotion,  history)  assumes  the
transcendental, therefore demanding a transcendental theory of communication
which is grounded in the concrete experience of corporeality.
CONCLUSION
What is decisive is not the body itself but its relationship. The body possesses
limbs and organs, but nothing is subjective. Subjectivity requires a relationship to
an  ego  that  is  distinguished  from  its  lived  body  even  by  a  non-reflective
consciousness. That this relationship of the body essentially signifies subjectivity
means only that the ego grasps itself as an ego of a lived body. It is not that it is a
lived body as such, but that it is a lived body of an ego, of a self, that makes it
capable of distinguishing what is one’s own from what is alien (in an ordinary
sense). The sense of the relationship “in me” and “outside of me” is based on the
rationality of a lived body to an ego. In this sense, they belong to me; they are
“my own”. The correlation is “what is alien to ego is alien to me”. Things and
their relationships do not belong to me; in this sense, even alien persons are not
subjective.
The manipulation of an apparatus suggests a state of affairs where significance
can  be  understood  only  after  the  investigation  of  geometry  (the  so-called
application of lived space). The expressive world dissipates in the space of action.
The expressive  characteristics  vanish into those  required for  utility. They  lose

246   A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Mickunas and Pilotta
their  effectiveness  and  communicative  physiognomy,  and  they  reveal  their
suitability  or  resistance  in  view  of  a  goal.
A  thing  of  intuition  means  a  complete  thing  in  the  totality  of  real  qualitative
fullness, as well as all of its sensibilities which are perceivable, inclusive of what
is perceived and what is grasped, along with the grounds of the conception of the
thing  as  an  identity,  in  the  flux  of  perceptual  change.  Each  sensory  intuition
contains categorical moments—straightforward presence “in person” and “in the
flesh”. The order of things among themselves is not a pure relation of position,
not a mere constellation, but a situation—an ordering of them which is relative to
the  here  and  now  of  a  corporeal  subject  who  apprehends  what  is  sensually
intuited.  Each  relationship  in  an  order  obtains  its  meaning  from  associative
relationships.  It  is  not  a  factual  order  but  a  place  of  accomplishments  of  the
subject  at  present—in  the  here  and  now.
The lived body means a corporeity, like me, and thus is a center of its space of
intuition, which is distinct from mine, and which is insurmountably closed to me
in my own here (and now).
The lived body is the foundation of having possessions. The certitude of the lived
body, mediated by its feeling, is a typical certitude “from within”. But this is no
“outside” of the “inside”. The boundary between inner and outer runs visibly at
the surface of the lived body. Yet, this expression is senseless—a functional unity
cannot possess a surface. The lived body, in its strictly phenomenal sense, is on
the near side of all separation, physical and psychic. That there is a distinction is
founded on corporeity itself, the constituted separation through touch. In touch,
there  occurs  the  original  communication  of  the  corporeal  subject  and  a  world
outside.
The essence of corporeity is nothing less than a system of functions, not merely a
physical body. One must be cognizant of the presupposition of the general sign of
life as self-movement. Functionalities are generalities, which lay the foundation
for  the  comprehension  of  the  meaning  of  a  situation—intersubjectivity  and
individuality  as  inseparable  correlates.
The functional body is a “passive domain” and is different from the physiological
body. The difference is:
1. The priority of the function of practical experience; and
2. The possibility of understanding the physiological rests on the change derived
from practical experience.

Radical Embodied Truths
A Critical Understanding of Artificial Intelligence   247
Without the practical domain—constituted by the acquisition of abilities within
the parameters of the functional body—the historically transmitted understanding
would  be  un-situated,  two-dimensional—in  short,  bodiless.  The  practical-
functional  comprises  the  domain  of  the  practognostic.
