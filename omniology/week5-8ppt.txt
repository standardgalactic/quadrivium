1. Instantaneous increased ventilation with exercise onset = feed forward. 
 
2. Deep breathing after exercise removes the oxygen debt - restoring myoglobin and creatine 
phosphate, and removes lactic acid and H+.

Types of Hypoxia 
(deficiency of O2 in tissues) 
•
Hypoxic hypoxia – low PaO2 
 
•
Anemic hypoxia – low O2 content b/c few RBCs
  
 
 
 
•
Ischemic hypoxia – low O2 delivery 
 
•
Histotoxic hypoxia – decreased O2 metabolism  

Causes of Decreased PaO2  
(Hypoxic Hypoxia)  
•
Hypoventilation  
 
•
Diffusion impairment: (expl. Pulmonary edema) 
 
  
•
Ventilation-perfusion inequality (or V-Q mismatch): 
 
 - Normally, V/Q = (4L/min) / (5L/min) = 0.8  
 
 
 - In normal lungs, gravity (upright posture) causes greater 
perfusion and greater ventilation of the lower 1/3 than 
upper 1/3 of the lung. This lowers the PaO2 relative to PAO2 
(called A-a gradient). 

Sleep Apnea 
During sleep, breathing frequency, inspiratory flow rate, and 
minute ventilation (VE) decrease. 
 
Skeletal muscle tone relaxes permitting partial obstruction of 
upper airways (pharynx, larynx and tongue). This causes 
snoring. If occlusion of airway is complete then sleep apnea 
occurs (i.e., breathing stops for 30-60 sec followed by gasps 
of air and awakening).  
 
What stimulates the apnea center in the medulla? Ans: 
increase in PaCO2 (which crosses the blood brain barrier and 
converts to increased H+ levels in the interstitial tissue).  
CPAP – continuous positive airway pressure 

 
•
Exercise is the most common cause of increased 
ventilation in the healthy normal individuals. At 
maximal exercise, PaCO2 falls and arterial pH 
rises due to metabolic acidosis. 
 
•
Sleep depresses breathing and leads to a 
relaxation of the airway muscles. This can result 
in a partial or complete collapse of the airways 
leading to snoring or sleep apnea, respectively.
