Why would people purchase a
diesel vehicle and pay more for 
its fuel than can be offset by 
improved mileage?
ChARLES D. hENDRICkSON
Forest Lake, MN
EDITOR’S RESPONSE:
We agree that diesel fuel is
overpriced in the U.S. See 
“America’s To-Do List,” page 42.
Signal Boost
January’s “Improving In-Home
Wi-Fi” hit on good ways to 
boost a wireless router’s signal 
strength, but what about wire-
less devices like laptops and 
game systems? once you’ve 
boosted your router signal, you 
can do the same for other wire-
less devices. Laptop adapters 
may have a power-save feature 
that you can disable to maxi-
mize wireless performance. 
and some adapters even have 
an external antenna.

Digital Snoops
Your January story “Who’s
tracking You,” on privacy con-
cerns, could have included more 
on GPs tracking devices. There 
should be a federal law restrict-
ing their use [in autos] without 
the registered vehicle owner’s 
written consent. GPs equip-
ment that [tracks] the owner’s 
location is being sold across the 
country. George orwell would 
say, “I warned you!”
MALCOLM JOhNSON
seMINoLe, FL
Your story about the latest
digital threats to privacy was 
enlightening. It’s too bad so 
many efforts are required to 
fight back. our last Congress 
let us down by passing a law 
granting retroactive immu-
nity to [telecom companies] 
that had illegally spied on us. 
Hopefully the next administra-
tion will demonstrate a higher 
appreciation for our rights.

Diesel Dilemma
I always find your auto reviews
informative. but I must take 
issue with the idea (New Cars, 
Jan. ’09) that more diesel 
autos should be in our future to 
reduce our dependence on oil 
through their improved mileage. 
I have a diesel pickup purchased 
in 2002, primarily for its tow-
ing capabilities, but at that 
time diesel was also the least 
expensive fuel. That changed in 
about 2003, and since then it 
has been the highest priced fuel. 
Readers  
responded to 
our technology 
privacy report, 
hybrid vs. diesel 
comparison and 
tips to boost 
wireless range.

n e w s  +  t r e n d s  +  b r e a k t h r o u g h s
+  A quartet of the 
world’s largest 
digital cameras will 
catalog up to a 
billion galaxies 
outside the Milky 
Way. The images 
will be 38,000 by 
38,000 pixels in 
size—roughly 150 
times larger than 
resolutions of 
point-and-shoot 
digital cameras. 
Each camera will 
have 1.4 billion 
pixels. Using  
one camera,  
a prototype 
telescope took its 
first usable image 
in late 2008. 
Interstellar 
Photography
Astronomers in Hawaii have
built a working prototype of a
system that uses the world’s biggest
digital camera to keep an eye on the
universe. The university of hawaii’s
mountaintop Panoramic Survey
Telescope and rapid response
System uses a small mirror to reflect
images to the gigapixel camera.
The prototype only has one mirror–
camera pair; the proposed finished
version will have four pairs. Pan-
STarrS’ main task is detecting
dangerous asteroids: every night
the telescope takes a thousand
photos of the sky; an automated
system scans the resultant black-
and-white images for any movement
that could indicate a planet killer.
The telescope will also produce
ultra-high-resolution color images to
create the most-comprehensive-ever
survey of the universe.

Compiled by Alex Hutchinson
Flipper’s 
secret power
+ Scientists have
long wondered how 
dolphins can swim 
as fast as 25 mph, 
given the thickness 
of their tail  
muscles and the 
density of water. 
But researchers  
in Troy, N.Y., were 
shocked to see  
the animal’s power 
when they tracked 
the movement  
of tiny air bubbles 
in the water 
around swimming 
dolphins. Each tail 
flip generates 
about 200 pounds 
of thrust— 
triple Michael 
Phelps’s best. 
Big Motors For 
Mini tools
+ Engineers in
Switzerland are 
producing a 
miniature electric 
motor that they 
say is the first to 
achieve a speed of 
one million 
revolutions per 
minute, four times 
faster than the 
previous spin 
master. The 
matchbox-size, 
100-watt motor 
integrates mini ball 
bearings and 
electrical 
components in a 
special titanium 
shell that can 
withstand the 
extreme centrifu-
gal forces created 
by the record-
breaking speed. 
The system may be 
used in drills and 
milling machines 
designed for small 
electronics.
e-Mail FroM 
Major toM 
+  This summer, 
astronauts on  
the International 
Space Station  
will test a new 
“Interplanetary 
Internet” scheme 
that last year 
swapped 
information with a 
spacecraft more 
than 20 million 
miles from Earth. 
The system relies 
on relays, with 
each node storing 
information until it 
can be forwarded 
safely. This 
safeguards data 
despite interrup-
tions by solar wind 
or planets. 
Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner is revolutionary because it uses carbon
composite materials in more structural parts than any previous
commercial jetliner. But how tough is this new material? To find out,
company engineers shattered a 50-ft.-long, 55,000-pound structure
called the wing box, which connects the wings to the fuselage. The test
showed that the box could withstand more than 1.5 times the highest
aerodynamic load the jet could ever experience. After delays, the first
Dreamliners are currently scheduled for delivery in early 2010.
perfect recipe for antimatter
+ Physicists at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory have developed a
cheap way to produce copious amounts
of elusive antimatter. by shooting short,
powerful laser bursts at a small gold
target, they are able to generate
positrons, the antimatter version of
electrons. similar methods have been
explored before, but by using a thicker
piece of gold, the physicists created an
estimated 100 billion short-lived
positrons. The researchers will use the
method to study black holes and
other natural antimatter creators.
time tweak saves energy
+ since 2007, daylight saving time has
started three weeks earlier (in March) and
ended one week later (in November) each
year, in a governmental bid to save
energy. The first-year results are now
in—and it worked. According to the
Department of energy, the measure
reduced U.s. energy consumption by 17
trillion btu, enough to power 175,000
households for a year. Most savings
resulted from slightly lower electricity use
in the early evening. southern states saw
lesser savings, possibly because they
were offset by more air-conditioner use.

It takes some planning to prepare a small space for new roommates, especially 
if the apartment is 220 miles above the planet. NaSa engineers have been 
developing space-ready versions of familiar fixtures to prepare for an expansion of 
the International Space Station’s crew, which this year will double to six. Engineers 
must build household items that balance space, power consumption, weight and 
repairability. “Those tradeoffs were made at the very beginning [of the gear’s 
design],” says Marybeth Edeen, who heads vehicle hardware development for 
NaSa’s ISS program. The systems that rely on chemistry and fluid dynamics, such as 
plumbing, are tougher to develop than a new bedroom. “In microgravity, solids don‘t 
go down and gas bubbles don’t go up,” she says. “Everything just goes where it 
wants.” These pieces of orbital home design, most delivered in a single space shuttle  
trip late last year, provide a realistic glimpse of what it‘s like to live in space.

Our bodies manufacture lots of 
blood—about 1.5 ounces of red 
blood cells daily—but the nation’s 
hospitals remain in desperately short 
supply. The need for blood for soldiers 
in war zones is even more dire, as 
donated blood airlifted from the U.S. 
can take more than three weeks to get 
to the front lines. to address this 
shortfall, the Defense Department’s 
advanced project agency, DarPa, has 
commissioned a medical company to 
build a fully automated machine able to 
make new blood on-site—which would 
also be a welcome develop-
ment for civilian hospitals. 
Cleveland-based arteriocyte 
received nearly $2 million to 
perfect a “blood pharming” 
system that grows red blood 
cells in a three-dimensional 
matrix of nanofibers that 
replicates bone marrow. 
Company researchers trying to grow 
stem cells noticed that, by tweaking 
the temperature and concentration of 
oxygen and carbon dioxide that is 
pumped through the culture, they 
could also create early versions of red 
blood cells. The proposed system, the 
size of a few household refrigerators, 
would weekly churn out about 100 
units (7.5 ounces each) of universal-
donor type o-negative blood.

today’s special operations boats owe their legacy to small gunboats of the past.  
In 1967, PM illuminated the experiences of Vietnam Swift boat skippers with a 
first-person account from Lt. j.g. jim Stephens. For days at a time, his crew spent 
hours “patrolling down the coastline, checking out 30-ft Vietnamese fishing boats” and 
engaging in firefights with enemies on shore. today’s black-op boats (see “Smoke on the 
Water,” page 78) do not patrol but instead deliver and extract Special Forces. com-
manders say the crews in Iraq have been involved in the largest riverine gunfights since 
Vietnam, and some tactics and weapons are holdovers from that war. Every year, 
special ops boat crews host a reunion for their Vietnam-era trailblazers.  — Allie Haake

➜  An American home uses three times as much water to 
generate electricity as it sends down its drains, said William 
Horak, who leads Brookhaven National Laboratory’s energy–
water research initiative. Water-cooled power plants withdraw 
up to 50,000 gal for each megawatt-hour produced. Air-cooled 
power plants are far more water-efficient, using only around 
600 gal per megawatt-hour.
➜  Climate models predict more intense storms, said panelist 
Joan Rose, the co-director of the Center for Water Sciences at 
Michigan State University. Heavy precipitation can overload 
drainage and sewage systems. Researchers estimate that up 
to 20 percent more untreated sewage will enter the Great 
Lakes as the climate warms. Steps such as porous concrete, 
green roofs and improved sewer design can help.
 
➜  Desalination takes a huge amount of energy, but so does 
transporting fresh water, said Mark Shannon, the director of 
the Center of Advanced Materials for Purification of Water  
with Systems. Desalination is usually for coastal regions. But 
El Paso, Texas, now runs the world’s biggest inland desalina-
tion plant to treat brackish supplies. In Florida, rising sea levels 
could contaminate groundwater, also requiring desalination. 
Within a decade, windows may provide more than just a 
view­—they could generate electricity. A group of MIT researchers 
has formed a company to market color-coated glass or plastic 
plates with solar cells around the edges that they say could 
increase the efficiency of existing solar panels by as much as 50 
percent. The Organic Solar Concentrator prevents light from 
being wasted by guiding photons with organic-dye-tinted plates, 
layered so that each subsequent plate absorbs a longer 
wavelength. The dyes direct some photons to solar cells at the 
edges, while light at longer wavelengths continues to the next 
pane. The company, Covalent Solar, hopes to sell the panels 
within three years, but has to perfect dyes that remain stable for 
more than a few months. If it succeeds, stand-alone panels could 
be passé—and your living room skylight might pay for itself.

gamers who want turbocharged machines are used to making  
tradeoffs—power typically comes at the expense of price and portability. 
The HP Firebird with VoodooDNA, which starts at $1799, is small  
enough to tote to LaN parties (its chassis is about a quarter the size of its

MP3 players aren’t cheap, but if you’re 
downloading from online music stores, 
well, that’s when the bills really add up. 
The SanDisk Sansa slotRadio Player 
($100) comes bundled with a micro SD 
card filled with 1000 songs (additional 
genre-specific 1000-song cards go for 
$40 a pop). Sadly, there’s a catch:  
The songs are saddled with DRM 
software that keeps you from copying 
them to your other devices. 
Because in-ear headphones block external sound, users don’t need to 
crank up the volume to hear their music over noisy surroundings. But a 
decent pair can be costly, typically running $100 or more. The  Acoustibuds 
Earphone Adaptors ($13)  are a cheaper means to the same end. These 
silicone adaptors snap onto the end of almost any ear bud, frankensteining 
it into an in-ear headphone. In tests they were surprisingly comfortable, 
did a fine job of blocking outside noise and kept our slip-prone buds 
situated firmly in our ears. 
Most voltage detectors speak in binary language—they let
users know if there’s a current or not but don’t divulge how
much juice there is. The noncontact Greenlee Adjustable
Voltage Detector ($17) features an adjustable dial that
allows users to tune its sensitivity from as low as 5 volts to
as high as 1000 volts (a range that far exceeds the single
setting on most voltage detectors).

WINNER of all three tests
 Bottom Line:  Although duct tape proved capable, the clear 
winner was Gorilla Tape, which handily won all our tests. 
 How We Tested  Sturdiness: Stacked dumbbells on a tape 
sling until it snapped. Stickiness: Stuck a bundle of four 
12-gauge wires against drywall for a week. Water resistance: 
Submerged a bundle of tape-wrapped pipes for a week.
Duct tape’s versatility is almost a cliché—
we’ve seen it used for everything from wallet 
construction to hull repair to, well, patching 
ducts. But can it beat newfangled multiuse 
tapes? We pit the standby against three chal-
lengers, testing each tape’s tensile strength, 
the tenacity of its adhesive and how it worked 
after a week underwater.  — Harry SaWyErS

Yes, the new  Intel 
Core i7  is the fast-
est PC processor 
around (Intel 
claims it’s 40 per-
cent faster than its 
predecessors)—but 
no chip ever holds 
that title for long. 
What’s really  
interesting is that 
the speed boost 
was accomplished 
without increasing 
energy consump-
tion. Similar tech-
nology could yield 
benefits for all 
kinds of gadget-
powering chips 
down the line.
The Psyclone TouchCharge Kit ($50 to $70) purports to charge 
gaming controllers (Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii versions are 
available) without bothersome wires—lay a controller on a 
conductive metal pad (included) and it receives juice via a 
clamp-on battery adaptor. In practice, it worked as promised. 
And even though the adaptor added a bit of bulk, game 
controllers are not mobile devices that frequently fill 
pockets—so the bulge didn’t bother us. Still, the best may  
be yet to come: The company behind the tech told us that  
it plans on building wire-free charging directly into  
gadgets and tabletops. We can’t wait.
The Yamaha FZR WaveRunner ($12,600) is designed for one thing: extreme
speed. It’s the quickest, most powerful personal watercraft on the market (it pulls
0 to 30 in 1.5 seconds, thanks to the industry’s only 1812 cc four-stroke engine),
and it’s the first with telescoping handlebars, allowing riders to stand comfortably
for high-speed bursts, then hunch down for sharp turns.

have a smaller

the Hitachi

The Duracell Powerpack 450 ($120) generator is best thought of as an insurance 
 policy: Insurance against a dead car battery (it provides audio directions on jumpstarting 
your car), insurance against flat tires (it includes a 150-psi air compressor) and insurance 
against emergencies and even boredom (its AC, DC and USB outlets can charge laptops, 
GPS units and cellphones).
Most portable rechargeable batteries allow  
you to refill the juice on only one gadget at a time. 
The Callpod Fueltank ($70) doesn’t force the  
user to pick favorites—it has two jacks for simulta-
neous charging (and the manufacturer sells  
plug attachments for virtually every gadget). 
Though our tests found its battery life to fall slightly 
short of the promised seven full phone charges,  
we were still able to pull several cycles before  
it needed a fill-up.

The multimedia interface system in  
the new Lexus RX is intuitive and 
cunningly equipped with a computer-
mouse-like haptic feedback device that 
greatly improves user accuracy. You 
can now talk to the voice recognition 
system in plain language, too. For 
example, a phrase like “it’s too hot in

The Toyota iQ is clever. No, scratch

That’s the only way to describe a car 
that’s so small (9 ft 9.5 in. long), so 
inexpensive (around $13,000) and so 
positively packed with innovation. An 
ultraskinny 4.7-in.-thick fuel tank sits 
under the floor to save room. And the 
tiny climate control unit uses a thinner fan to reduce noise. 
This allows the dashboard to be asymmetric, which in turn  
yields more interior space. Glove box? Who needs it? The 
Euro- and Japan-only iQ has an optional canvas bag that 
pops onto the dash. The 91-hp 1.0-liter three-cylinder is 
tipped forward, away from the driver, to maximize cabin 
space—and it roars mightily as you pull away into Milan’s 
notoriously heavy traffic. The car’s diminutive size means 
the 1973-pound iQ feels quicker than it is. Even the 
so-hip-it-hurts fashionistas gave the iQ a double take 
through their sunglasses. On the autostrada, the iQ showed 
that it’s stable, refined and comfortable even at 90 mph. But

A tinkle of rain dapples the windshield of the new $60,000 
Cayman S as I mash the throttle entering the motorway in 
Cádiz, Spain. The 3.4-liter Six is now armed with direct fuel 
injection so it’s up 25 hp over last year. Plus there are bigger 
brake discs and wider wheels too. Armed with these tools, we 
press on. Construction mud, slimed by the light rain, keeps the 
tires on the edge of wheelspin through the first three gears. 
Despite this greasy pavement, the stability control keeps her 
tracking straight, and the brilliant seven-speed

Pontiac G8 GXP | Harley-Davidson XR 1200 | Honda Insight | Mustang GT | Mazda3  
Let’s see how
these hybrid rivals 
stack up. The 
Prius has a longer 
wheelbase, which 
provides more rear 
legroom.  
But both hit  
60 mph in about 
10.5 seconds and 
stop from that 
speed in roughly 
127 ft. At 48 mpg 
city and 45 mpg 
highway, the Prius 
has the edge in 
EPA fuel-economy 
figures, but after 
200 miles around 
Phoenix, the 
Insight deliv-
ered 42.4 mpg 
compared to 41.1 
for the Prius. The 
Insight feels sport-
ier and it’ll be a 
few grand cheaper 
too. The Insight 
wins—this time. 
An all-new Prius 
is just around the 
corner.  — l.W.

2009 Harley-Davidson
XR 1200
Flat Tracker
Few motorsports are more
definitively American than 
flat-track racing—and 
Harley’s 580-pound XR1200 
is an homage to the sport. It 
packs a 90-hp version of the 
Sportster’s 1200 cc V-twin 
and a more aggressive 
suspension. Climb aboard 
and you just might feel a bit 
nostalgic. Firing up this bike 
produces a familiar Harley 
snarl, and the engine’s 
vibrations remind you this 
isn’t an over-engineered 
superbike. Slowly let out the 
clutch, twist the throttle and 
the $10,799 XR1200 
accelerates with authority. 
It’s a surprisingly comfort-
able place to spend several 
hours. This Hog may not be 
the nimblest bike on the 
road, but it’s certainly fun to 
ride on twisty tarmac.

2009 Honda Insight
Smart Moves
The original Insight wasn’t a sales success. 
The reason? Too few doors. But it’s back, 
wearing more practical, five-door duds. This is 
one hybrid that’s actually fun to drive. Electric 
power comes from a 13-hp motor sand-
wiched between the engine and CVT. That 
motor assists the 88-hp 1.3-liter gas engine. 
A 0.6-kilowatt-hour nickel-metal-hydride 
battery pack resides in a well between the 
rear wheels—saving valuable trunk space. 
The steering feels natural and the low-rolling-
resistance tires offer reasonable grip and 
response. We also dig the Insight’s EcoGuide, which can score 
drivers on their frugal right foot. Honda expects the Insight to 
return 40 mpg city and 43 highway. Some of the interior 
surfaces, like the rock-hard optional center armrest, feel a little 
low-rent. But most of the car outperforms its $20,000 price. The 
cabin is roomy and quiet; the folding rear seats combine with the 
hatchback to offer 31.5 cu ft of space. This 
Insight is poised to give the Prius some 
serious competition.  — larry WeBSTer

2010 Mustang GT    Rebirth of the Cool
The new Mustang may look a bit like the old one, but from the driver’s seat you 
can feel the difference. The V6 model remains largely unchanged under the hood. 
But the 4.6-liter V8 in the $27,995 GT benefits from a ram-air intake system that 
boosts hp to 315 and is paired to a five-speed manual or automatic. Hop in and 
you notice the tighter interior panel fit, especially the soft, molded instrument 
panel. It’s quieter too. So quiet, that signature V8 rumble is actually piped into the 
cabin via a tube from the new cold-air intake. Engineers tuned out the jittery 
rear-end motions caused by rough pavement, and the steering has a heftier, more 
direct feel. Even on 19-in. wheels, the ride is compliant. Tackling the tight, twisty 
roller-coaster Streets of Willow race circuit in Rosamond, Calif., demonstrated the 
benefits of the 3.73 rear axle and the Track Pack over the standard setup. The 
extra mechanical advantage from the higher gear ratio adds up to more fun. And 
in a Mustang, fun is what matters most.  — paTrick c. paTernie
The body may 
be new, but as 
before, the  
mustang is avail-
able as a coupe,  
a glass-roof 
coupe or our 
springtime 
favorite—a full 
convertible.  
2010 Mazda3    Head of the Class
The Mazda3 is simply the most entertaining car in its class and has the refinement  
to match. Engineers doubled the percentage by weight of high-strength steel.  
That lowered the structure’s weight by 24 pounds and increased bending rigidity.  
The interior of any car is as much a part of the driving experience as the chassis.  
And the soft-touch plastic here feels expensive. Even the base 148-hp model 
equipped with a five-speed manual is eager, with a delightfully accurate shifter.  
The 2900-pound Mazda attacked the curves of L.A.’s Topanga Canyon with surpris-
ing tenacity, hanging on long past the point where we expected it to drift. The 167-hp 
2.5-liter version is much the same—except everything happens 
quicker. It is remarkably smooth, and the steering provides plenty of 
feedback without heavy effort. Not bad for around $20,000.  — l.W.

endurance 
 racing pioneer 
aB Jenkins 
raced for love 
of the sport. 
J A Y  L E N O ’ S  G A r A G E
avid Abbott “Ab” Jenkins was one of america’s
least known motorsports heroes. he spent years
setting long-distance speed records on the Bonne-
ville Salt flats, beginning back in 1932. that was
decades before the Southern California timing
association, which runs today’s Bonneville Speed
Week, sanctioned racing there. ab was a motor-
sports pioneer.
in the early years, Bonneville had a 10-mile cir-
cular track, so racers could run 12, 24 or even 48
hours—stopping only to refuel. there wasn’t
much sponsorship in those days. if you got a case
of motor oil it was like, “hey, i got some free oil!”
Years ago, an average guy could build a land-speed
car in his garage and go set a record.
like other racers of his era, ab raced for the love
of the sport—he did it all himself. Not only was he
the driver, but he had to be the engineer, the r&D
guy—and he had to build the car too. he knew when
it broke, knew when it was running perfectly, and
he could drive it for 24 hours straight at 160 mph.
ab had that great all-american-boy stuff of the 
1930s. today we have kids who are almost inher-
ently computer whizzes. in ab’s day, there was a 
generation of boys who were mechanically adept. 
almost from birth, they could pick
up something and go, “this is off by
a few thousandths of an inch here.”
ab wanted to be a good role model
for those kids. So he always drank
milk. he didn’t touch liquor, caf-
feine or drugs. ab Jenkins was a Mor-
mon, and his car was aptly named
the Mormon Meteor.
ab’s Mormon Meteor ties together
two great elements of american
automotive history: Bonneville and
the Duesenberg brothers. ab’s
Meteor, a 1935 Duesenberg Special,
had a streamlined body and a super-
charged 420-cu-in. straight eight
that developed around 400 hp. on
his third attempt in the Mormon
Meteor, ab beat British racer John
Cobb’s record, averaging 135.58
mph for 24 hours.
of course, ab wanted to go even 
faster, so he got a Curtiss Con- 
querer aircraft engine—a 1570-cu- 
in. V12 that put out 750 hp. augie

amazingly, some of ab’s records are
still standing. in 1943 he sold the
Meteor to the state of Utah for $1. he
could have sold it to make money, but
he donated it because he loved his
state. periodically he’d borrow it to
set more records.today it’s the star of
the forthcoming John price Museum
of Speed in Salt lake City.
recently, i had a chance to start
up the Meteor. it fires up like an old
car—if you were born after 1980 you
may not understand. You turn the
key of a car today, and there’s no
sense of warmup or waiting for
things to settle in; you just go. But
there’s a mechanical sensitivity to
old cars. You start ’em and, as the
cylinders kick in one by one, they go,
PUHPUHPUHPUHooommmmpuhpuh-
puh! You give it a little gas and ease
the choke back in to keep it from
stalling and maintain that mixture
exactly where it should be. there’s a
great sense of mechanicalness to it.
although i only drove the Meteor
a few hundred yards, it went GUH-
GUHGUHGUH, and i could feel the
tremendous thrust. engines now are
more efficient, and they make more
power, but there’s nothing like those
big displacement engines for torque.
You let the gas out, the car leaps for-
ward and you say, “Geez, i didn’t do
anything.” You’re moving a lot of
metal here. Just to turn this thing, i’d 
think your arms would ache—but 
you’re mechanically involved.
it’s not unlike my watch. at the 
end of an evening, i like to pick it up 
and turn the mainspring. it just goes 
clickclickclickclick—it’s a very satisfy-
ing click. and i feel like i’ve done 
something. You either get a kick out 
of that or you don’t. ab Jenkins 
would like my watch. 
PM
Duesenberg designed a new bell-
housing and flywheel to replace the
old propeller drive. Working with
ab’s son, Marvin, augie oversaw the
V12’s installation. they changed the
car’s name to the Mormon Meteor
ii. and in the summer of 1936, ab
averaged 164.47 mph for 500 kilo-
meters (about 310 miles), breaking
the record of British driver George
eyston. With Babe Stapp as his relief
driver, ab averaged 153.82 mph for
24 hours, and stayed in the car to do
148.64 mph for an amazing 48
hours. in 1937, with indy winner
louis Meyer co-driving, ab averaged
157.27 mph over 3700 miles in the
Meteor to break his own record.
But the Curtiss V12 was too heavy
for the Duesenberg chassis and the
car understeered at high speeds, so
ab had augie design a new chassis.
this car became the more stream-
lined Mormon Meteor iii. in those
days, streamlining was whatever you
thought it was. Nobody was testing in
wind tunnels. it was all just common-
sense engineering. the Meteor iii’s
body was offset 6 in. on its chassis,
because the records were run in huge
circles for hours and hours. imagine
driving in a circle for 24 hours straight
at over 170 mph.people get exhausted
today driving from los angeles to San
francisco with the air conditioner
and all the other stuff on.
in July 1939 ab had been running
the Meteor iii with a huge tail fin for
added stability for 3 hours at over 171
mph. Suddenly, a fire caused by an
overfilled fuel tank engulfed the car.
locked in the cockpit, ab was res-
cued by Marvin, who pried off the
canopy. Just a few weeks later, still
recovering from his burns, ab
climbed back in the Meteor iii and
broke all the 12-hour
endurance
records.

plan should equalize those tax rates 
and stop punishing diesel owners.
 Reform flood  
 Policies 
It’s a double-barreled problem: 
Some 37 million Americans have 
moved to the nation’s shorelines 
since 1980, just as hurricanes have 
become more destructive. Unfortu-
nately, our current policies make 
matters worse. The Stafford Act 
empowers the president to declare 
an emergency and open a floodgate 
of money to rebuild the roads, sew-
ers and bridges of storm-damaged 
he Obama team enters office with perhaps the thorn-
iest agenda of any administration in memory: manag-
ing two wars, rebuilding tattered infrastructure—and 
coping with a world-class economic crisis. 
However, just like a homeowner moving into a new 
house, the administration needs to do some work 
immediately, while other jobs can be postponed. And 
then there are a few tasks so obvious—and affordable—
that tackling them immediately is a no-brainer. To help 
the administration get started, here are five relatively 
simple policy changes to implement right away.
 Support  
 Clean Diesel 
What alternative fuel could cut total consumption by the U.S. passenger vehicle 
fleet by up to 35 percent and slash CO2 emissions while requiring no techno-
logical breakthroughs and few changes in infrastructure? It’s not plug-in 
hybrids or biofuels. It certainly isn’t hydrogen. The answer is regular old diesel. 
Well, actually, it’s the ultra-low-sulfur diesel that has made a fresh generation 
of clean, ultraefficient engines possible. In a recent PM test, VW’s Jetta TDI die-
sel delivered more than 45 mpg on the highway. That’s better than a Prius. 
For decades, diesel generally cost a bit less than gasoline. But since 2004, it 
has been more expensive—at times, a lot more. That’s hardly an incentive for 
people to go out and buy diesel cars. Some of the disparity is due to the cost of 
converting refineries to make the cleaner fuel. But federal excise taxes also hurt; 
they run 6 cents per gallon higher for diesel than for gasoline. Any new energy 
fast fixes for U.S. 
problems with 
diesel fuel, flood 
policy, military 
procurement, the 
grid and nasa.

coastal communities. Resi-
dents who are frequently 
hit by hurricanes deserve 
the nation’s sympathy, and 
perhaps even help in relo-
cating. But there’s no rea-
son for taxpayers to keep 
rebuilding infrastructure—
at enormous cost—that 
only encourages people to 
remain in harm’s way. 
An egregious example is 
Dauphin Island, Ala.—a 
small island in the Gulf of 
Mexico jammed with vaca-
tion homes—which the 
United States has repeatedly 
restored, at a total cost of 
about $80 million. (The ﬁg-
ure doesn’t include outlays 
to residents from the simi-
larly misguided National 
Flood Insurance Program.) 
“If we weren’t rebuilding 
road access to places like 
Dauphin Island every few 
years, the land wouldn’t be 
so desirable,” says Robert 
Young, director of the Pro-
gram for the Study of Devel-
oped Shorelines at Western 
Carolina University. Given 
our shared economic dis-
tress today, it’s simply not 
fair to make taxpayers foot 
the bill every time a hurri-
cane wipes out some luxury 
vacation enclave. By phas-
ing out the program, we 
could slow the overdevelop-
ment of fragile coastlines 
and reduce our vulnerabil-
ity to future disasters. 
 TRIM FUTURE  
 COMBAT 
 SYSTEMS 
When it comes to finding 
places to cut waste, the Pen-
tagon is a target-rich envi-
ronment. Here’s a good 
place to start: the high-tech, 
$160 billion Future Combat 
Systems program that was a 
darling of former defense 
secretary Donald Rumsfeld. 
FCS incorporates some 
great technology, like the

robots and  surveillance drones that 
American forces have embraced in 
the ﬁeld. But many FCS items should 
be cut—in particular, the manned 
ground vehicles program. Today’s 
Abrams tanks and Strykers are get-
ting the job done, and the FCS’s 
advanced mobile artillery is not our 
troops’ most urgent need. In fact, the 
program fails a simple standard for 
judging any weapons system: Does it 
enhance the intelligence, capability 
and safety of our forces? These vehi-
cles don’t, and they should go.
 SUPPORT DISTRIBUTED    
 P O W E R  G E N E R AT I O N 
Who says power has to come from 
power plants? Almost everyone likes 
the idea of homes using their own 
solar panels or wind turbines to gen-
erate electricity. And state “net meter-
ing” rules encourage home owners to 
get involved by crediting their electric 
bills for the power they supply to the 
grid. In the long run, net metering 
can help reduce our reliance on dirty 
coal-power plants, and make the grid 
more resistant to blackouts. 
But the rules need work. They vary 
by state, confusing homeowners and 
discouraging them from investing in 
equipment. Also, the plans usually 
compel power companies to buy elec-
tricity from homeowners at the full 
retail price—so the utilities don’t 
proﬁt when they pass that power on 
to  other consumers. That’s okay 
today, when the amounts of electric-
ity involved are tiny, but it’s not sus-
tainable. Imagine a day when much 
of the power in the grid did come 
from households. Under current 
rules, utility revenues would drop just 
when the system needed expensive 
upgrades to manage 
a more complex ﬂow 
of  energy. What 
incentive would utili-
ties have to improve 
the grid if the work 
only served to drive 
down proﬁts?
In the short term, 
President Barack Obama can help by 
proposing a single national standard 
for net metering. Then, we need to 
set realistic rates for the electricity 
that homes and businesses feed 
back into the grid—a wholesale 
price, in effect. Electric companies 
could then evolve into grid managers, 
not only producing power but also 
adeptly juggling contributions from 
thousands of clean sources.  
 REBOOT  
 NASA 
With taxpayers struggling, it’s going 
to be hard to justify pouring billions 
into returning to a lump of rock we’ve 
already visited. But right now, NASA’s 
main goal seems to be replaying the 
greatest hit of the Apollo era, a moon 
landing. We can do better. Manned 
spaceﬂight is widely supported by the 
public and is fueled by a basic Ameri-
can optimism and drive toward explo-
ration. But let’s make sure we spend 
our travel budget wisely. 
President Obama should convene 
a task force to hammer out alterna-
tive visions for our future in space. 
Like all big bureaucracies, NASA is 
good at protecting 
its budgets. We need 
a few outsiders to 
come in and break 
some crockery. The 
panel must include 
non-NASA experts: 
space scientists like 
University of Arizo-
na’s Peter Smith and private-space-
ﬂight visionaries like Burt Rutan. 
Here are some items for the panel 
to consider. First, we should keep 
moving forward on the new Ares 
launch vehicles. With the space shut-
tle scheduled for long-overdue retire-
ment in 2010, we need the Ares’ 
heavy-lift capability. Then, let’s stop 
adding to the International Space 
Station—it was a bad investment and 
we should move on. Next, outsource 
cargo- hauling missions in low Earth 
orbit to private contractors. Finally, 
leave the moon to China, India and 
private space ventures. While others 
literally follow in our footsteps, we 
should aim higher, building a long-
term base on an asteroid—and laying 
the groundwork for travel to Mars. FC

visits in the u.S., but a sensor developed at the univer-
sity of pittsburgh may finally cause that number to 
plummet. Inside the handheld device, a polymer-coated 
carbon nanotube—100,000 times thinner than a human 
hair—analyzes breath for minute amounts of nitric 
oxide, a gas that lungs produce prior to asthma attacks.
Bacteria living on 
teeth convert 
sugar into lactic 
acid, which erodes 
enamel and 
causes tooth 
decay. Florida-

new bacterial 
strain, called 
SMaRT, that 
cannot produce 
lactic acid—plus, it 
releases an 
antibiotic that kills 
the natural 
decay-causing 
strain. Dentists

swab SMaRT, now 
in clinical trials, 
onto teeth once to 
keep them healthy

Speech Restorer
For people who have lost the 
ability to talk, a new “phonetic 
speech engine” from 
Illinois-based Ambient 
Corporation provides an 
audible voice. Developed in 
conjunction with Texas 
Instruments, the Audeo uses 
electrodes to detect neuronal 
signals traveling from the 
brain to the vocal cords. 
Patients imagine slowly 
sounding out words; then the 
quarter-size device (located in 
a neck brace) wirelessly 
transmits those impulses to a 
computer or cellphone, which 
produces speech.

Absorbable  
Heart Stent
Stents open arteries 
that have become 
narrowed or blocked 
because of coronary 
artery disease. Drug-
eluting stents release 
medication that keeps 
the artery from narrow-
ing again. The bio-
absorbable version 
made by abbott labora-
tories in Illinois goes 
one step further: unlike 
metal stents, it does its 
job and disappears. 
after six months the 
stent begins to dissolve, 
and after two years it’s 
completely gone, 
leaving behind a  
healthy artery.

Smart Contact Lens
Glaucoma, the second-leading cause of blindness, develops 
when pressure builds inside the eye and damages retinal 
cells. Contact lenses developed at the University of 
California–Davis contain conductive wires that continu-
ously monitor pressure and fluid flow within the eyes of 
at-risk people. The lenses then relay information to a small 
device worn by the patient; the device wirelessly transmits 
it to a computer. This constant data flow will help doctors 
better understand the causes of the disease. Future lenses 
may also automatically dispense drugs in response to 
pressure changes.

Prosthetic  
Feedback
one challenge of 
prosthetic limbs is 
that they’re difficult 
to monitor. “you 
and I sense where 
our limbs are 
spatially without 
having to look at 
them, whereas 
amputees don’t,” 
says Stanford 
university graduate 
student Karlin bark. 
Skin is sensitive to 
being stretched—it 
can detect even 
small changes in 
direction and 
intensity—so bark 
is developing a 
device that 
stretches an 
amputee’s skin  
near the  
prosthesis in  
ways that  
provide  
feedback  
about  
the limb’s  
position and 
movement.

Nerve  
Regenerator
Nerve fibers can’t grow along injured 
spinal cords because scar tissue gets in 
the way. A nanogel developed at 
Northwestern University eliminates that 
impediment. Injected as a liquid, the 
nanogel self-assembles into a scaffold of 
nanofibers. Peptides expressed in the 
fibers instruct stem cells that would 
normally form scar tissue to produce cells 
that encourage nerve development. The 
scaffold, meanwhile, supports the growth 
of new axons up and down the spinal cord.

Muscle Stimulator
In the time it takes for broken 
bones to heal, nearby muscles 
often atrophy from lack of use. 
Israeli company StimuHeal 
solves that problem with the 
myoSpare, a battery-operated 
device that uses electrical 
stimulators—small enough to 
be worn underneath casts—to 
exercise muscles and keep 
them strong during recovery.

Smart Pill
california-based proteus biomedical has engineered sensors that 
track medication use by recording the exact time drugs are 
ingested. Sand-grain-size microchips emit high-frequency electrical 
currents that are logged by band-aid–like receivers on the skin. The 
receivers also monitor heart rate and respiration and wirelessly 
transmit the data to a computer. “To really improve pharmaceuti-
cals, we need to do what is now common in every other industry—
embed digital technology into existing products and network them,” 
says David o’Reilly, senior vice president of corporate development.
Stabilizing Insoles
When Erez Lieberman’s grandmother suffered a 
dangerous fall, he wanted to ensure it never happened 
again. “But it wasn’t till a few years later at NASA that I 
found a way to channel that into something tangible,” 
says the MIT graduate student. Using technology 
developed to monitor the balance of astronauts who 
have just returned from space, Lieberman’s iShoe 
analyzes the pressure distribution of the feet. Doctors 
can use the insole to diagnose balance problems in 
elderly patients before falls occur.

Gastrointestinal Liner
Obesity is associated with type II diabetes, which over time wears out the pancreas. 
A gastrointestinal liner developed by Massachusetts-based GI Dynamics may restore 
the obese to a healthy weight by preventing food from contacting the intestinal wall. 
The Endobarrier is routed endoscopically through the mouth—unlike a gastric bypass, 
no surgery is necessary—and lines the first 2 ft of the small intestine, where the most 
calories are absorbed (nutrients are still absorbed farther down the intestine).
Liver Scanner
How healthy is your 
liver? Until recently, 
answering that 
question often 
required a painful 
biopsy. French 
company EchoSens 
has developed a 
machine that scans 
the organ for damage 
in just 5 minutes. 
Studies have shown 
that damaged livers 
become stiffer and 
less elastic, so the 
scanner, called the 
Fibroscan, measures 
the organ’s elasticity 
using ultrasound.

Portable Dialysis
More than 15 million adult Americans suffer from diseases of 
the kidneys, which often impair the ability of the organs to 
remove toxins from the blood. Standard dialysis involves three 
long sessions at a hospital per week. But an artificial kidney 
developed by Los Angeles–based Xcorporeal can clean blood 
around the clock. The machine is fully automated, battery-
operated, waterproof and, at less than 5 pounds, portable. 
MIT researchers 
have developed an 
autonomous 
wheelchair that 
can take people 
where they ask to 
go. The chair 
learns about its 
environment by 
listening as a 
patient identifies 
locations—such as 
“this is my room” 
or “we’re in the 
kitchen”—and 
builds maps using 
Wi-Fi, which works 
well indoors (unlike 
GPS). The current 
model, which is 
now being tested, 
may one day be 
equipped with 
cameras, laser 
rangefinders  
and a collision- 
avoidance system.

Stephenville residents re-enact responses to bizarre lights seen above their central-Texas 
town in January 2008 and again in October and November.

"It was the most beautIful sunset I'd ever seen," says steve allen,
who has seen 50 years of sunsets in central Texas. “That’s what I first thought.” 
It was Jan. 8, 2008, and the trucking entrepreneur was sitting around a fire out-
side the Selden, Texas, home of Mike Odom, his friend since first grade. Then he 
saw the lights—orbs that glowed at first, then began to flash. “There was no regular 
pattern to the flashing,” he says. “They lined up horizontally, seven of them, then 
changed into an arch. They lined up vertically, and I saw two rectangles of bright 
flame.That’s when I knew it was a life-changing experience.” He watched the lights

drift north toward Stephenville, the seat
of Erath County. “They came back a few 
minutes later,” Allen says, “this time 
followed by two jets—F-16s, I think.” 
Allen, who owns and flies a Cessna, has 
seen plenty of military planes over the 
years. “The jets looked like they were 
chasing the lights, and the lights 
seemed to be toying with them. It was 
like a 100-hp car trying to keep up with 
a 1000-hp one.” 
Odom also saw the lights and called 
to his wife, Claudette, who came out-
side in time to see the second display.
When Allen returned home, he phoned 
friends at the local airport who checked 
with the Fort Worth airport tower. “Both 
said nothing was flying,” Allen says. 
That night, James Huse, a former Air 
Force navigation specialist, was in 
downtown Stephenville saying good-
night to a couple of friends. “Out of the 
corner of my eye I saw two red orbs mov-
ing overhead,” he says, “the reddest 
things I’d ever seen in the sky. They 
came right in front of me at 2000 ft 
about half a mile away. They weren’t 
going that fast, maybe 60 mph. They 
didn’t make any noise.”
Outside Dublin, about 15 miles 
southwest of Stephenville, Constable 
Lee Roy Gaitan finished eating a slice of 
his wife’s birthday cake, then headed 
out to his patrol car to get his wallet so 
his family could watch Mr. Bean on pay 
per view. That’s when he saw the lights. 
“First, I saw a yellow-red orb the color of 
lava in a volcano,” he says. “Then, 
instead of the red orbs, there were nine 
or 10 flashing lights maybe 3000 ft in 
the air, bouncing and very bright. They 
hovered there, strobing for 2 or 3 min-
utes, bright like German auto head-
lights. Then they shot off at blazing 
speed like a school of fish, you know, 
when it’s frightened.” Later, Gaitan 
says, two jets flew over.
The next day Allen called Angelia 
Joiner, a reporter at the Stephenville 
Empire-Tribune, and told his story. The

UFOs Invading Texas?” asked  Texas 
Monthly. “UFOs Put Stephenville in 
World Spotlight,” said the Fort Worth 
Star-Telegram. CNN showed up, along 
with ABC, the BBC and other TV crews 
from as far away as Japan. So did Bill 
O’Reilly and Larry King. A longtime UFO 
fan, King devoted a segment to Stephen-
ville and interviewed Gaitan and Joiner. 
Jake and Dorothy’s Café, near the court-
house square, became a favored jour-
nalist hangout. “One day I went into 
Jake and Dorothy’s for coffee, the way I 
always do,” Huse says, “and there was a 
TV crew on one side of me and report-
ers on the other.” 
The Stephenville sightings had all the 
elements of a classic UFO incident—first 
reports, official denials, independent 
witnesses stepping forward. The Texas 
dairy town of 17,000 with the statue of a 
cow in the main square had joined 
Roswell, Area 51 and  other small places 
as an iconic name in the annals of UFOs.

Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort

said the base had nothing flying the

bases issued similar denials. 
It all added up to the most dramatic 
UFO incident in more than a decade.

The two planets and crescent suggest a
flag’s heraldic pattern. By the end of the 
evening, the sinking moon is huge and 
orange, like a Ferris-wheel-size slice of 
cantaloupe hung in the trees.
The illusion that the moon is bigger 
near the horizon is just one of the tricks 
our eyes play on us when we observe 
objects in the heavens. Humanity has 
long infused these mysterious shapes 
and lights with portents and meanings 
interpreted according to the cultural 
notions of the day. The star-related dei-
ties of the Egyptians, the godlike comets 
of the Greeks, the mysterious shapes in 
the skies of Renaissance frescoes—all 
were forerunners of flying saucers. “The 
tendency to believe in the paranormal 
appears to be there from the beginning,” 
Christopher Bader, a Baylor University 
sociologist, told LiveScience. “What 
changes is the content. Few people 
believe in fairies and elves these days. 
But as belief in fairies faded, other 
beliefs, such as belief in UFOs, emerged 
to take its place.”   
There is no dispute that UFOs exist—
that is, objects flying through the sky 
that are unidentified. (In fact, one in 
seven Americans say they have seen 
UFOs.) But that, of course, does not 
mean they are ships from a distant gal-
axy. We humans tend to leap to conclu-
sions, imagining alien spacecraft while 
discounting more  likely explanations. 
Over the centuries, the technology to 
record UFOs has evolved from marks on 
clay to video clips, and the causes of 
sightings may have changed from 
comets to secret aircraft, but the psy-
chological pattern endures: It is the 
story of people projecting hopes and 
fears onto objects in the sky.

t was the biggest 
UfO sighting in 
years, witnessed by 
thousands of 
Phoenix residents—
a string of bright 
lights that appeared 
around 10 pm on 
Mar. 13, 1997, 
before disappearing 
over the Estrella 
mountain range. The 
air force initially 
claimed that no 
warplanes were in 
the area. Two 
months later, 
officials from 
Davis-Monthan air

Tucson cited a 
logbook error and 
confirmed that

Why are people who see isolated lights so 
sure they are observing a solid UfO? The 
same reason the ancients saw figures in the 
stars: a need to make sense of what’s 
around us, says Stanford ophthalmology 
professor Michael Marmor. “If you see lights 
that seem to form a circle, you try to fill it 
in,” he says. viewing the illusion developed 
by psychologist gaetano Kanizsa in 1955

lights; their reporter Joiner had not. She
left the paper to run a Web site about the 
sightings, funded by Allen. The Dublin 
Citizen, however, continued to pursue 
the story. Publisher and editor Mac 
McKinnon, a former Air Force historian 
whose office is hung with model war-
planes from his days in the service, saw 
some curious lights in January. “I believe 
the military has all sorts of exotic pro-
pulsion systems and other technologies 
we don’t even know about,” he says. He 
assigned the story to reporter Jon 
Awbrey, who also saw lights—“a  triangle 
with squares at the corners.” 
Awbrey put me in touch with Dublin 
police chief Lannie Lee. In January two 
of his men had taped one of the lights 
using the dashboard video in their 
patrol car. He had not made the tape 
public. “I didn’t want any notoriety to 
be attached to the department,” the 
mild-mannered chief says. 
He pulls out a VHS tape and leads 
me to the back of the station and puts it 
in the machine. On the screen, a dot 
appears against a black sky and begins 
to dance. The camera zooms in on a 
shimmering, bouncing but otherwise 
featureless circle of light. “It goes on 
like that for about an hour,” Lee says. 
The reports from January reminded 
another Dublin resident, machinist 
Ricky Sorrells, of a huge object he says 
he saw in December when he was deer 
hunting. “I looked at it through the 
scope on my deer rifle,” Sorrells tells me 
over burgers at the Dublin Dairy Queen. 
He is a big man who has just come in 
from hunting, dressed in full camou-
flage. He describes what he saw as a 
“huge gray object,” the color of galva-
nized metal, with no rivets, bolts or 
seams. “It was about 100 ft tall and 
about 300 ft up in the air,” he says, com-
paring the height of the object to the 
grain elevator where he once worked. 
It was the first of several sightings for 
Sorrells. He captured one of them on 
video. In the Dairy Queen, he  unfolded

Stephenville lights that the Colorado-
based group set up an open hearing in 
nearby Dublin, Texas, birthplace of  
Dr Pepper and golfer Ben Hogan. On 
Sat., Jan. 19, some 500 people streamed 
into the 1909 brick building that is 
home to the local Rotary Club. “Every-
where I turned there were TV tripods,” 
says Steve Hudgeons, a Fort Worth con-
struction project manager and chief of 
MUFON’s investigations in Texas. 
Many people in attendance were 
simply curious. A few wore tinfoil caps. 
But more than 200 people came forward 
to tell their stories, with some sightings 
going back 30 years. Hutcheons and 
other MUFON investigators considered 
about 20 reports to be substantive and 
relevant to the Jan. 8 incident and prom-
ised to publish a report.
On Jan. 23, 12 days after denying it 
had planes in the air, the military 
reversed itself. According to a carefully 
worded press release issued by Air Force 
Reserve Command Public Affairs, “Ten 
F-16s from the 457th Fighter Squadron 
were performing training operations 
from 6 to 8 pm on Jan. 8 in the Brown-
wood Military Operations Area [MOA], 
which includes the airspace above 
Erath County.” 
Why the flip-flop? “It was an internal 
communications problem that has now 
been fixed,” says 301st Fighter Wing 
spokesman Lewis. Inconsistent disclo-
sures by the military have often fueled 
UFO speculation. The military changed 
its story about Roswell numerous times 
after 1947, when Air Force officials first 
claimed to have “captured” a flying sau-
cer, then denied it. 
Adding to the atmosphere of mis-
trust is the military’s refusal to release 
details of operations, including train-
ing flights. Lewis declines to give specif-
ics on hardware or tactics used over 
Erath County. During training, he says, 
“we fly like we fight.” 
By mid-February the Empire- Tribune

kinematic decoys are 
designed to fly as fast 
as the warplane that 
ejects them, at least 
briefly. “Some even 
come with thrusters,” 
says Dennis clark, a 
countermeasures 
engineer at BaE 
Systems. These flares 
extinguish quickly, 
which from the ground 
could appear to be 
unearthly acceleration.
New missiles have 
sensors that use color 
to distinguish target 
airplanes, so a new 
type of multispectral 
flare changes hues to 
defeat them.

MUFON filed Freedom of Information
Act requests with the military branches 
and other governmental agencies. Only

acknowledged they had relevant infor-

In July, the group released its report, 
which suggests that several fighters as

well as an Airborne Warning and Con-
trol System (AWACS) plane were in the 
area. But so, they claim, was a mysteri-
ous large object, without the required 
transponder that identifies and locates 
aircraft. The report concludes that a 
very large unidentified craft or object 
“was tracked on radar for over an hour. 
Most of the time, the object was either 
stationary or moving at speeds of less 
than 60 mph. At 7:32 pm, the object was 
tracked accelerating to 532 mph in 30 
seconds and then slowing to 49 mph 
only 10 seconds later.”
Radar blips would seem to present a 
positive, nonsubjective way to observe 
UFOs. Studies from the Condon Report, 
published in 1968 by the University of 
Colorado, to the Air Force’s Blue Book 
project to a 1997 evaluation by the Soci-
ety for Scientific Exploration, however, 
have found that radar can be “fooled” in 
simple ways. Anomalous propagation, 
or false echoes, is most often caused by 
ground clutter, often a result of low- 
level temperature inversions that muf-
fle ground radar’s electronic pulse and 
lead to a circular scatter of returns 
based on hits from buildings and trees.

“They had a huge amount of data,” 
McGaha says, “and they just pulled a 
few bits of information out of it and 
drew a line.”
In the fall, just when it seemed as 
though Stephenville might be forgot-
ten, the sightings began again. People 
were no longer hesitant to come 
forward. Their descriptions often com-
pared the lights to arc welding or burn-
ing magnesium—lights bright enough 
to interrupt a little league football game 
in Stephenville. The descriptions fol-
lowed a pattern similar to the one 
the temperature inversion can bend the 
beam all the way back to the Earth’s sur-
face, so a surprising radar blip turns out 
to be a hill or a building. With the intro-
duction of more advanced filtering soft-
ware over the past decade, the number 
of UFOs attributed to false returns has 
decreased significantly.
Former Air Force pilot, astronomer 
and longtime UFO skeptic James 
McGaha believes that some such form 
of radar scatter was responsible for the 
returns that MUFON interpreted as a 
solid object. The FAA did not describe 
any such object, nor was it clear 
 experienced by Peggy Delavergne. On 
the night of Nov. 18 she saw lights while 
driving her children home to Stephen-
ville after a basketball game in Dublin. 
“At first there were two very bright gold 
lights,” she says. “Then there were more 
lights, like a string of pearls—not quite 
a circle and not quite egg-shaped. My 
husband was in another vehicle, and he 
saw them too. He called me on his cell-
phone and asked me, ‘Do you see that?’ 
I don’t know whether it was from some-
where else or from the military, but 
something is going on out there.”

UfOs evolve from sleek saucers 
to clusters of lights in Steven 
Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the 
Third Kind. The film brings religious 
overtones to the topic, implying that 
belief in aliens is a matter of faith, 
not science. E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial

UfO sightings 
evolve with the 
culture. By the ‘60s, 
classic saucer 
images had started 
to fade. Instead, 
people began 
reporting more 
direct contact with 
aliens (who often 
resembled the 
big-eyed creatures 
seen in the Tv movie 
The UFO Incident). 
But a darker strain 
emerged, when  
tales of gray  
aliens performing 
experiments on 
human abductees 
flourished. UfO 
stories sometimes 
took on spiritual 
dimensions: aliens 
were godlike 
creatures coming to 
save our planet— 
or transport us to  
a better one. 
In recent years, 
most UfO reports 
have grown far less 
sensational; many 
sightings these days 
simply describe 
lights in the sky. 
arnold regretted 
not having a camera 
at hand during his

camera phones and 
video cameras are 
ubiquitous. and yet 
clear, detailed 
images have all but 
disappeared from 
the photographic 
record. Even the 
clearest recent 
images are little 
more than glowing 
dots and squiggles.

what's in the sky? Some skeptics, 
like McGaha, believe that the Stephen-
ville, Phoenix and many other sightings 
can be attributed to military aircraft 
and evasion or illumination flares. 
Flares have a long association with 
UFO sightings. One night in late Febru-
ary 1942, the sky over Southern Califor-
nia lit up with strange blinking lights 
near various defense plants. In what has 
become known as the Battle of Los Ange-
les, the Navy unloaded four batteries of 
antiaircraft artillery at what turned out to 
be a balloon carrying a red flare. A decade 
ago, mysterious lights seen by thousands 
of Phoenix residents were actually left-
over flares dumped by A-10 pilots with 
the Maryland Air National Guard.
Some Erath County residents dis-
miss the flare theory.  “I’ve seen military 
flares,” Allen says. “They are not even 
the same color as the ones I saw.” But 
evasion-flare technology evolves ­rapidly, 
as the military tries to keep one step 
ahead of the increasingly sophisticated 
tracking capabilities of antiaircraft mis-
siles. At one time evasive maneuvers 
consisted of sharp turns against the 
sun. When missiles got smarter, pilots 
began dropping bright flares; infrared 
seekers homed in on the decoys while 
warplanes fled from the field of view. 
But today’s missiles can track far 
more than the heat signatures of 
engines. They can pick out targets 
among decoys by discerning a war-
plane’s movement and shape. Spectral 
sensors on missiles can even detect the 
color differences between a jet engine 
and a flare. In response, the military has 
deployed a variety of flares that can 
move under their own power and 
change color. 
People in Erath County are certainly 
familiar with warplanes. During my

S
py and stealth 
planes—some 
with bizarre, 
bat-shaped wings, 
others with 
triangular silhou-
ettes that imply 
otherworldly 
designs—have long 
generated UFO 
sightings and lore. 
And official denials 
feed rumors that the 
government isn’t 
telling us about alien 
ships. The CIA 
estimates that over 
half of the UFOs 
reported from the 
’50s through the 
’60s were U-2 and 
SR-71 spy planes. At 
the time, the Air 
Force misled the 
public and the media 
to protect these 
Cold War programs; 
it’s possible the 
government’s 
responses to current 
sightings of 
classified craft—
whether manned or 
remotely operated—
are equally evasive. 
The result is an 
ongoing source of 
UFO reports and 
conspiracy theories. 
Here are the 
Earth-built craft that 
likely have lit up 911 
switchboards over 
the years. 
• First Test Flight: 1996  • Deployment: None (it was canceled in 
1999) • Declassified: 1995 • Size: 15 ft long; 69-ft wingspan  
• Performance: 288 mph (cruising speed); 45,000+ ft (max. alt.)  
• UFO Link: The official life span of this unmanned spy plane was 
brief and disappointing, with a crash and a program cancellation 
after just three years. But in 2003, Aviation Week reported that a 
similar stealth UAV was being used in Iraq—fueling speculation that 
the government scrapped the craft publicly only to secretly 
resurrect it for clandestine missions.

spy plane has an even 
more unusual cross 
section than the u-2. 
This area 51 alum was 
briefly reactivated in 
the 1990s, and rumors 
of a followup—the 
now-legendary aurora 
project—have supplied 
both ufo believers and 
skeptics with a possible 
source of unexplained 
sightings.

• Deployment: unknown   
• UFO Link: plane spotters’ photos 
and videos blew the top-secret cover 
off a 5-minute inaugural flight in 
palmdale, calif. The hybrid airship—it 
uses gas and a wing shape for 
lift—fuels speculation that classified 
airships quietly roam the night skies.
• First Test Flight: 1981  
• Deployment: 1983 to 2008  
• Declassified: 1988 
• UFO Link: This long-range stealth 
fighter, which could stay aloft 
indefinitely thanks to midair 
refueling, remained classified 
through much of the 1980s during 
test flights at tonopah test field 
range in nevada, 80 miles from the 
legendary area 51 groom lake facility. along with the b-2 spirit, the 
batlike f-117a was a perfect candidate for triangular ufo sightings.
• First Test Flight: 1989  • Deployment: 1997 to present  
• Declassified: 1988 • Size: 69 ft long; 172-ft wingspan   
• UFO Link: although the long-range bomber was never a true “black aircraft,” since it was 
displayed to the public approximately eight months before its first flight, an airborne b-2 is a 
ufo report waiting to happen. it looks like an alien craft from nearly any angle and specifi-
cally like a flying saucer when viewed head-on or in profile.

concluded that the 
resulting aurora 
generates a number 
of the country’s 
annual sightings.

daily—some 
resulting in showy 
midair displays that 
have been mistaken 
for UfOs since  
as early as 1965, 
when residents of 
Kecksburg, Pa., 
were bewildered  
by a meteor.

cloudS: 
Stratified and 
saucer-shaped, they 
tend to form near 
mountains. In July 
2008, the North 
Wales Pioneer ran a 
resident’s “strange 
images”—of a 
lenticular cloud.
T
he most provocative imagery to emerge from the Stephenville 
sightings came from resident David caron, who videotaped 
squiggling, multicolored lights on Jan. 19, 2008, that he says must 
have been a UfO (below, left). “you could see it much better 
through the camera than just with the naked eye,” he told the 
Stephenville Empire-Tribune. That might have been the problem. 
“video cameras record at about 30 frames per second,” says 
george reis of Imaging forensics. “This recording refreshes twice 
per second, so very long exposures are being used.” caron was 
likely filming a distant, stationary light. “a handheld exposure of a 
bright light results in light streaks from camera movement that 
would look like these images,” reis says. The color shifts, he adds, 
may be from color mosaic filtration on the camera’s ccD chip. The 
history channel’s UFO Hunters reproduced a similar effect with a 
video camera set to night mode zoomed in on a cluster of colored 
lights across the lab (below, right). UfOlogists on Internet forums 
did the same by shooting the star Sirius, which is known for its 
luminescence and vivid coloring.

copters and jets fly day and night. One 
afternoon, while I’m driving to Dublin 
on Highway 377, a T-38 Talon super-
sonic jet trainer rips past only a few 
thousand feet above the road. 
The MOA is well-known to the lead-
ing civilian authority on Texas airspace, 
Steve Douglass. The author of Military 
Monitoring and an expert consulted by 
Aviation Week, Douglass has been track-
ing operations from his base in Amarillo 
for a quarter century. He is part of the 
so-called interceptors network, the 
plane spotters caricatured in the film 
Broken Arrow as “those guys in lawn 
until June 2008, the only—F-35 test 
plane, the AA-1, was in Fort Worth, but it 
was not in the air that night. “It’s 
restricted to daytime flight,” Kent says, 
so that chase planes can monitor it. 
stephenvIlle Is only the latest In
a long list of UFO incidents that are
likely based on military operations, 
starting with the Battle of Los Angeles. 
Whether the recent Texas sightings 
were flight exercises involving evasion 
flares or tests of an existing plane, a new 
plane or a UAV, any military activity in 
the area is likely to remain unexplained 
for awhile. We now know about the 
secret programs behind the UFO sight-
ings of decades ago. But what of pro-
grams that are still secret?
In the past, many projects sponsored 
by DARPA, which was behind the origi-
nal Stealth and UAV research, have 
begun as secret black programs before 
showing up as public white ones. One 
example: stratospheric sensors devel-
oped for high-altitude airships under the 
ISIS program, which may have existed 
for years before it was made public in 
2004. (Its funding for 2007 was $24.7 
million.) These sensors could be used  
on huge wing- or boomerang-shaped 
blimps that can fly at altitudes of more 
than 60,000 ft and hover unmanned for 
months. “There have been many sight-
ings of large, slow-moving triangle-
shaped airships,” says Steve Douglass, 
“starting with a sighting near Antelope 
Valley, Calif., in 1990.” For many years 
airliners and ground observers have 
reported boomerang-shaped craft near 
Groom Lake.
The tethered “aerostat” lighter-than-
air craft, which appeals to many agencies 
as a so-called poor man’s satellite, also 
may trigger sightings. The Air Force uses 
these surveillance systems along the 
U.S.-Mexico border to support antidrug 
operations. The departments of Defense 
and Homeland Security are evaluating 
chairs” staking out runways and bases. 
“Brownwood is used by Navy, Air Force 
and Army units,” Douglass says, “includ-
ing Apache helicopters, B-1s, C-130s and 
F-16s. There are AWACS from Tinker 
AFB in Oklahoma City and KR-135 tank-
ers from Altus in southwest Oklahoma. 
The airspace is especially active these 
days, with the new F-35 tactical fighter 
being assembled at a factory in Fort 
Worth and tested in the MOA.” Lock-
heed Martin spokesman John Kent con-
firms that on Jan. 8, 2008, the first—and

The military’s secrecy exasperates 
some Stephenville locals, even veter-
ans. “It’s been 30 years since I was in 
the Air Force,” James Huse says, “but 
I don’t understand why they wouldn’t 
come out and tell the truth. If they 
have the capability of putting on a 
show like that all they have to do is 
tell us. We’d get out our lawn chairs 
and watch.”  
But the Air Force’s legitimate need 
for secrecy extends beyond its black 
programs. It releases information 
about all domestic flights on a case-
by-case basis, says Capt. Rose 
Richeson, of the USAF Air Education 
and Training Command. “Usually we 
don’t mind talking about training,” 
she says. “But we would not talk about 
specifics if it were a matter of national 
security, or give details about training 
methods or mission scenarios that 
could be used by enemies of the 
United States.” 
Meantime, Stephenville has set-
tled uneasily into its newfound noto-
riety as a UFO site. Some locals have 
become skeptical about the motives 
of MUFON. “Who funds it?” asks 
Steve Allen. And a certain amount of 
backbiting has set in among  some of 
the eyewitnesses. Lee Roy Gaitan wor-
ries that some locals who have report-
ed sightings are “just not credible” 
and cast doubt on his genuine 
account. “Some people stretch a  
story,” Huse says. Others resent the 
way they have been depicted. “I made 
the mistake of saying it was as big as a 
Wal-Mart,” Allen says. “People have 
been teasing me about it ever since.”
“I didn’t call them flying saucers 
or extraterrestrials,” Huse says. “All  
I said was that it was unidentified fly-
ing objects, and I’m sticking to that.  
I couldn’t identify them.” People in 
Erath County, Huse says, aren’t nuts 
or hicks. “We are just ordinary people 
who happened to look up.”

It’s hard to pinpoint the worst part of Danny Tracewski and Courtney 
Jansen’s pre-renovation basement (1) in Brookhaven, Pa. The rickety bar comes 
to mind, with its sticky, matte black counter surrounded by mustard-colored brick and sooty 
gray grout. Or there’s the foam drop ceiling with knobby plastic fluorescent fixtures and, beneath 
it, an industrial brown carpet best suited for indoor soccer. The couple wanted a space where 
they could work and entertain guests. Instead, says Jansen, “We’re afraid to go down there.“
When HGTV’s James Lunday and his Rip & Renew team first looked at the basement, they 
saw unrealized potential. The lifelong carpenter and his renovation crew typically tear a place 
apart and start from scratch (2), rebuilding with inexpensive materials that they customize to 
overcome a room’s limitations. In this case, Lunday explains, “We used light and dark to create 
depth and give the illusion of a high, wide space.“ Says Jansen, “Now, we spend pretty much all 
our time down there.”   PoPular Mechanics tagged along to see how they pulled it off.

If you want to work with metal, there’s one
thing you have to confront: You need heat. With
it, you can make the toughest metal submit to
your will. Without it, you’ll never gain full mas-
tery over this stubborn material.
Over the years, I have been frustrated by my
inability to work hot steel. I’ve bolted metal
together, welded it and soldered it. But I
couldn’t shape it, and so large swaths of the
mechanical realm were off-limits to me.
But blacksmithing never felt alien. My father
is a metallurgist, descended from generations

and handed me the welding gun: “You take it from here.” I slid on a mask
and picked up where he’d left off. As I worked, Mike crouched over my
shoulder and fired off bits of advice. “Get more weld metal on the vertical
surfaces,”  he said. “You’re getting too much spatter; reduce your travel
speed and your electrode stick-out.” When I found it difficult to see through
the welding glare and
smoke, he said, “Deal
with it. Look at the
weld puddle, not the
arc.” I learned more
about welding in that
half hour than I had
in years of fooling
around on my own.
After
we
com-
pleted the stand, we
riveted sheetmetal
into a hood and fash-
ioned a chimney from a 5-ft piece of stovepipe. Then, we troweled refractory
cement (the kind used in furnaces and kilns) into the sink. We ran steel and
PVC pipe from the drain to the output port on a shop vacuum. The same
line would supply air both to the sink (to feed the fire) and, through a Y joint,
to another pipe leading into the chimney (to help pull the smoke up and
away). We installed a valve to let us direct the air where we wanted it. We also
cut pressure-treated 4 x 4 lumber to make a block for the anvil, then hoisted
the anvil onto the block using a tow strap hooked to a ceiling-mounted elec-
tric winch. Finally, we hammered 1⁄8-in.-thick steel flat stock into straps to
attach the anvil to its block. Believe me, 15 minutes spent pounding cold
steel can convince anybody of the need for a forge.
Now we just had to let the furnace cement cure overnight.
Firing
the Coal 
I arrived at Mike’s shop early next morning to find him puttering around, a
cup of coffee in hand and another, recently poured, waiting for me on the
workbench. “Ready for fire?” he asked.
(July 1941)
of 19th-century blacksmiths and born in Ger-
many to shipbuilders whose forges scattered
sparks over the shores of the Elbe River and the
North Sea. I grew up in rural Connecticut
among Yankee mechanics who could forge any-
thing, machine anything, build anything, fix
anything—and I’ve been trying to live up to
those old-timers’ standards all my life. It wasn’t
hard to finally decide to take another step, and
teach myself some blacksmithing skills.
Building
the Forge
Maybe it’s because our smokestack industries
are in decline that a rising number of Americans
feel the need to get their metalworking fix in
home workshops. The Artist-Blacksmith’s Asso-
ciation of North America counts a membership
of 4000 hobbyists and professionals. Some peo-
ple estimate there are more blacksmiths in this
country today than there were during the 1800s.
And you don’t have to poke around long to find
dozens of Web sites offering friendly—even pas-
sionate—advice from artisans, along with equip-
ment ranging from anvils and tongs to air-driven
power hammers.
First, I needed a forge. I considered buying a
gas-powered model, but the fact was that I
wanted to build my own. So I settled on a design
that can be executed in an afternoon using parts
purchased at a home center, a masonry supply
yard and an auto parts store. The forge would
burn coal, rather than gas, to make things sim-
pler. And the design had another virtue, at least
as far as I was concerned. It was based on plans
published in Popular Mechanics in July 1941.
I enlisted the help of Mike Allen, our senior
auto editor and a crack metalworker. He glanced
at the old plans and said, “Sure, we can build
this.” Within days, Mike’s house and the shop
behind it swirled with activity as the UPS guy
delivered in rapid succession a 275-pound anvil,
tools, materials and four 50-pound boxes of
blacksmith’s coal shipped from Pennsylvania.
Once the supplies were in, we set to work
building the forge, beginning with its stand. I
cut steel parts and handed them off to Mike,
who laid them out on the shop floor, clamped
them together and temporarily tack-welded
them with small globs of steel.
With the stand tacked, he flipped up his mask

the metal over the anvil’s edge and picked up our
48-ounce blacksmith hammer. A few whacks
were all it took to put a neat bend in the bar.
After decades spent struggling with hacksaws
and rivet guns, I can’t tell you how gratifying it
was to put a hammer to glowing steel and bend it
like putty. Mechanical justice was done.
A long day followed as Mike and I practiced
the basics of the blacksmith’s age-old craft:
bending, flattening, twisting, tapering and
upsetting—striking a bar to thicken and enlarge
its hot end. We used angle iron to form the best
coal-handling tool I’ve seen—a curved fire pok-
er worthy of a shipyard’s smithing shop. And we
felt sufficiently emboldened to try our hand at
forging a demolition chisel from a 3⁄4-in.-dia bar
of tool steel, a high-
carbon material far
tougher
than
the
stuff found at hard-
ware stores. We had
to let the steel soak in
the forge fire three
times and swing the
hammer for several
minutes before it
began to yield.
At sundown, we
called it quits and let
the fuel bed cool into
ash. We swept the
shop floor and put
away our tools for the night, already planning
future projects. Teaching ourselves forge con-
struction and basic blacksmithing in two days
was a good piece of work. But Mike had plans for
a serpentine iron rack to store motorcycle hel-
mets, while I wanted another go at shaping my
own tools, designed uniquely for my needs.
That’s how I imagine the Iron Age was launched
in prehistory, in a forge like the ones archaeolo-
gists have found scattered throughout Africa and
the Middle East. Some guy needed a better tool,
and figured out a way to make one.
It was dark by the time I dropped into the
seat of my car and headed home. As I merged
onto the highway and into a traffic jam, I saw
the taillights of the cars ahead in a new way.
Just for tonight, they didn’t represent a hassle.
They looked like a gigantic bed of glowing
coals, waiting for its steel.

We watched  
in awe as a  
yellow-white  
glow took shape  
in the center of  
the coal, and the 
steel was lost  
in the glare.  
The light was  
too intense to  
look at without  
eye protection.
We carried the forge outside and in a light autumn wind
used a propane torch to ignite crumbled shipping paper
and kindling split from the pallet the anvil was shipped
on. When the fire was bright and hot, we coaxed some
coal onto it, and watched anxiously as it gave off a faint,
yellow-green, sulfurous smoke.
We added more fuel. The fire
smoldered stubbornly, but when
we turned on our high-powered
vacuum, the blast of air knocked
our little coal pile out of position.
We pushed the smoldering pieces
back with a steel bar and tried
again, without success.
Mike grabbed an air hose and
nozzle from his shop compressor
and applied a gentle draft. Now
the coal started to glow. We added
more fuel, and the smoke nearly
disappeared. We turned on the
shop vacuum again. With that, an
impressive rushing sound came
up from the forge, and the center
of the coal mound reddened like a
stoplight. A few moments later, a
bright yellow flame jumped from
the fuel, and then a ghostly blue
glow took shape above it. As it hov-
ered, the blue light looked like a
living thing.
Once the coal was burning well
on its own, I took a piece of scrap
metal from the shop floor and wiggled the steel
into the volcanic fuel bed. A couple of minutes
later, we slid the metal out to find that it had
merely turned a light shade of blue—still not
enough heat. Mike rotated the valve to make the
vacuum’s entire air output rush into the fire,
feeding the flames. (This is where the old black-
smithing term “full blast” comes from.) We
watched in awe as a yellow-white glow took
shape in the center of the coal, and the steel was
lost in the glare. The light was too intense to
look at without shaded eye protection.
Working
the Steel 
A couple of minutes later, I picked up my tongs
and withdrew the steel. The end was now glow-
ing bright yellow and spitting sparks—the tem-
perature must have been up around 1900 F. I laid

The first gun to shoot doesn’t sound like a gun at all. The noise
is high and buzzing, like a chain saw or a leaf blower. It stops, then starts up
again. From my perch on the engine cover of a special operations gunboat, I
can see the source of this weird racket—someone on one of the other boats
gliding down Kentucky’s Salt River is firing a minigun into the woods. Every
second, hundreds of 7.62 mm bullets pour out of the spinning machine-gun

a live-fire exercise on Kentucky’s Salt

secretive, dangerous world of the 
Pentagon’s black-ops boat crews.

barrels. I’m pushing up my helmet, trying to spot the gun-
ners’ targets, when someone close by yells “Contact,” and
the boat I’m sitting in erupts in gunfire. Now the shell cas-
ings are landing in my lap as twin M240B machine guns rat-
tle a couple of feet away. When the aft-mounted .50 caliber
starts thumping, the pressure from each shot feels like a
punch in the gut.
The volume of fire builds as two other Special Operations
Craft-Riverine (SOC-R) boats join in, but no one is shooting
back. This is a live-fire exercise at Fort Knox—and the thou-
sands of rounds tearing through the air on this day are all
outbound. The torrent of gunfire does not seem to rattle the
members of Special Boat Team 22.
Many of these Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen,
or SWCCs, have survived firefights along the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers in Iraq. Fast, heavily armed SOC-R boats are
used mainly to insert or extract Navy SEALs, Army Rangers
and other special forces personnel. If the enemy interferes,
the SWCC response is, in military speak, “violence of action.”
The SOC-R’s five weapon mounts provide a 360-degree field
of fire. “Anyone who decides to shoot at us will immediately
regret that decision once we start shooting back,” says Mike,
my designated SWCC spokesman, his face patterned with
green and black grease paint. “We have an overwhelming
amount of firepower at our disposal. It’s pretty insane.”
A fog of gun smoke builds over the river as the boat crew
fires, and when I inhale, the smoke burns the back of my
throat. It’s no longer possible to make out the demolished
targets or even the foliage on the riverbank.
This one-sided engagement has already covered the floor
of the 33-ft-long boat with hundreds of spent casings. But the
simulated fight isn’t over yet, even as the diesel engines
throttle up and the boat speeds off. The aft gunner continues
to rattle away on the .50-caliber, and clouds of dirt are still
blooming on the offending bank.
Shadow FighTerS
There’s a good reason SOC-R boats
bristle with machine guns: Riverine
craft fight in extremely close quar-
ters. The enemy could be 20 yards
away, crawling along the river’s edge.
Other than the boat captain, who sits
in a shielded compartment while
driving, the crew is almost entirely
exposed. A well-coordinated ambush
could wipe them all out within sec-
onds. Although SOC-R boats are
highly maneuverable, avoiding a
fight while on a narrow river isn’t
always an option. “Your best defense
is to shoot,” Mike says.

Special operations gunboat crews prefer to stay out of the fight but are equipped to win it if need be. Each craft can apply an array of 
withering fire in any direction. They have a variety of interchangeable mounted weapons to choose from, and carry personal arms in

press. SWCCs are in the same multibranch military family as
Green Berets, Rangers and SEALs, and all are considered by
the Pentagon to be “high-value targets,” meaning they could
be personally targeted by the nation’s enemies. (Officials
won’t say whether any SOF has ever been stalked in such a
fashion.) During our live-fire ride-along, the restrictions on
what we can describe extend to communications gear, the
armor on the SOC-R hulls, tactical maneuvers and details of
the boat-mounted sensors.
Special operations boat crews trace their heritage through
Vietnam-era Swift boats back to the regular-Navy PT boats of
World War II. Unlike those predecessors, SWCC units do not
patrol, but instead train allied troops and participate in tar-
geted raids. (The older units also didn’t parachute from trans-
port airplanes with their boats, the way SWCCs do.) Training
is intense: Aspiring crewmen are expected to be able to per-
form 79 sit-ups in 2 minutes and swim 500 yards in 10 min-
utes. Their physical strength is needed to handle heavy gear—
each crewman wears at least 70 pounds of ballistic protection,
weapons, radios and medical gear—and also prevents injury.
But physical conditioning doesn’t totally prevent back dam-
age caused by the repeated impact of fast-moving boats slam-
ming across waves. Many veteran SWCCs have scars from back
surgeries made necessary by these shocks to their vertebrae.
 The military won’t discuss specific SWCC missions, but it
will say that SOC-R teams have faced heavy, regular action
along the river systems of Iraq. “They’re out there, and they’re
engaging,” says Rich Evans, Naval Special Warfare Group 4
command master chief. “There’s been a couple of missions
that ended up in the largest firefights that guys on the water
have been in since Vietnam.”
 Since Sept. 11, 2001, the Special Forces have received an
increasing share of personnel and funding—the SOF budget
rose by more than 80 percent between 2001 and 2006. Evans
says that the number of SWCCs is growing at a fast pace
because of bureaucratic changes within the Defense Depart-
ment. In 2006 the Pentagon changed the “source rating” of
the SWCC’s units—the military equivalent of making a short-
term civilian job into a permanent position. Now, “most guys
who get into naval special warfare stay in,” Evans says. “They
don’t go back to the fleet.”
The majority of the 650 total SWCC members, split into
East and West Coast teams, conduct operations on coastal
vessels (see page 82). Members of Team 22, based in Stennis,
Miss., who make up a tiny fraction of the total SWCCs, are the
only ones who operate the SOC-R. These river crews conduct
mainly clandestine combat missions, often operating at night
with little or no air support. Coastal teams, in contrast, spend
more of their time these days training friendly international
forces. “In the schoolhouse at SWCC school, you can choose
which team you want to be on,” Mike says. “I specifically
picked [Special Boat Team] 22, because it’s the most up-close-
and-personal, aggressive team that the SWCCs have. I mean,
you’re on a river, you’re a lot closer to any enemy; whereas, you
know, it’s a huge ocean.”

The SOC-R wasn’t made to be versatile. Instead, it is a special-
ized tool built to help the SWCCs engage the enemy in tight
surroundings—and prevail. The SWCCs told its builder,
United States Marine, of Gulfport, Miss., that the craft could
have a draft no deeper than 2 ft when fully loaded with arma-
ments, ammunition, crew and passengers. It had to be com-
pact enough to fit inside a C-130 military aircraft, narrow
enough to slide through tight river passages and light enough

sling these gunboats to lift them over dams, making possible
an extra element of surprise.
Although the boat’s twin waterjets and 440-hp Yanmar
diesel engines give it a hefty power-to-weight ratio, its speed
and tight turn radius are facilitated by the hull design. The
slope of the SOC-R’s V-shape belly essentially allows the boat
to skate along the surface, with relatively little drag on the
hull. There is no hanging rudder or propeller blades to snag
on submerged roots and rocks.
The guns, however, are the SOC-R’s central attraction.
Although tanks and light armored vehicles might have a
more powerful cannon, there’s arguably more firepower per
square inch here than on any other military vehicle.
The two forward weapon mounts of the boat I’m in are fit-
ted with GAU-17/A miniguns. The electrically powered rotat-
ing barrels allow for bursts of up to 6000 rounds per minute.
(Shooting at that rate through a single barrel could melt the
weapon.) M240B light machine guns are fitted into the mid-
mounts. Finally, the boat has an aft-mounted .50 cal that has
the slowest output but the biggest punch—enough to pene-
trate light vehicle armor and most building materials. This
weapon’s position is vital: It can cover the boat crews as they
escape from an overwhelming threat.
heavy Fire oN Muddy waTer
We’ve just simulated a “hot extract,” with the boat pushed up
against a bank long enough for nonexistent passengers to
scramble onboard. Other SOC-R teams provide covering
fire—again, their targets disintegrate before I even have a
chance to notice them. Chewing up entire swaths of riverfront
property is a prelude to the getaway—our minifleet of SOC-Rs
is on the run from the exfiltration site, .50 cals thumping
away. “Sometimes on our special op missions, we just run
away and come back and fight another day,” says Commodore
Evin Thompson, former head of Naval Special Warfare Group
4, which runs the SWCCs.
With a series of bangs, a wall of smoke suddenly fills the
river behind us. This is another trick the SOC-R crews can
employ as they exit a fight—firing smoke canisters from four
rear-facing launchers. “What’s interesting about the riverine
environment is that if you get in trouble, you can either go up
the river or down the river, not left or right,” Thompson says.
On the way back, the flotilla pauses for an all-out exhibi-
tion—all four boats decimate a broad stretch of riverbank.
Red tracer rounds streak through the dust kicked up by pre-
ceding shots, some of which chop lines along the water’s sur-
face. With all boats firing, there are at least 12,000 rounds a
minute coming at that bank.
With this part of the exercise over, most of the SWCCs
head back to their trailer house for a break, but one boat gets
the job of helping us with a photo op. The SOC-R speeds past
a few times as we watch from the river bank, showing off  how
quickly it can come to a full stop. The crew’s last trick is a
high-speed reverse: Everyone on board is cheering as the
nimble craft whips its aft around 180 degrees, throwing one
SWCC off balance. He manages to hold on before hitting the
water, and his crewmates quickly pull him back. When we
make it back to land, Mike is eager—and amused—to see the
footage; he was the one who almost went overboard.
After ditching me and our photographer, the troop is get-
ting ready to go out again. The sun has already slipped 
behind the tree line, but the crews still face a long session of 
overwhelming-firepower training ahead. Once it’s dark, they 
will run maneuvers, firing thousands more live rounds while 
wearing night-vision goggles. 
After nearly 4 hours of daylight operations, the plan is to 
spend 8 to 12 more hours on the river. This is part of the

When i first set up my basement
workshop nearly 15 years ago, I
didn’t have much time or money to
invest, so I just banged together a
2 x 4–and-plywood workbench and
mounted a sheet of perforated peg-
board to the wall.
this rudimentary layout served
me well over the years. the work-
bench provided a large surface on
which to build projects and fix furni-
ture, and the pegboard kept dozens
of hand tools neatly organized and
readily accessible.
Eventually, though, the system
became overloaded. The workbench
got buried under an impenetrable
pile of old tools, half-done projects
and stacks of lumber. The pegboard
ran out of space for any more hooks,
and it strained under the weight of
my ever-growing tool collection. It
was clear that my shop needed a
facelift. but rather than just tidying
up the tools and clearing off the
workbench, I decided to strip the
entire space down to the bare floor

How to 
Build It
With pilot holes 
bored and spacers 
installed, drive 
attachment screws 
into the substrate. 
Use masonry 
screws such as Tap-
cons to install the 
panels to concrete 
block or solid con-
crete. Use drywall 
screws for drywall 
and wood framing.
The pegboard forms its own guide for boring into the 
substrate. Simply drill through peg holes to fasten the 
board. Use a carbide-tip masonry bit and hammer drill to 
bore into concrete block or solid concrete. Use an ordinary 
wood-boring bit and drywall screws to attach to drywall 
and wood framing.
Cut the pegboard around any surface-mounted electri-
cal boxes. If you’re installing the pegboard over existing 
surface-mounted electrical boxes, switches or plastic- 
covered cable, replace them with metal conduit and 
boxes. Conduit and metal boxes provide maximum protec-
tion to electrical wiring and devices located in work areas.
and walls and start from scratch.
my primary goal was to create a
better-organized work space, but I
also wanted it to look great. so I built
it out of materials not ordinarily found
in a home shop, including fat black
iron pipe, rock-hard maple butcher
block and polished aluminum dia-
mond-plate pegboard. I couldn’t be
happier with the results.
Installing the Pegboard
at first glance, it may seem that
commercial-quality diamond-plate
pegboard is just too extravagant for
residential use. maybe. but my old peg-
board sagged, and hooks came loose
as the holes elongated. The diamond
plate will easily stand up to the rigors
of an active workshop. besides, it’s just
plain cool—an important performance
characteristic in my book.
true, this stuff is several times
more expensive than the pegboard I
replaced, but it’s about in line with
other top-quality building materials.
I paid $135, plus shipping, for two
panels that measure 45½ in. on each
side (diamondlifegear.com).
I was able to install the pegboard in
minutes. In my case, the panels needed
to be fastened to a concrete-block
wall, but studs would work just as well.
I used a hammer drill and a
-in.
carbide-tip masonry drill to bore the
required holes through the panel and
into the masonry (1). The panels come
with small peel-and-stick plastic spac-
ers that maintain the proper distance
from the wall in order for the home-
owner to insert hooks (2).
with mounting holes bored and
spacers applied, all that remained
was to drive the fasteners home. I
used
 x 2¼–in. tapcon masonry
screws and turned them in with an
ordinary cordless drill driver (3)—no
heavy equipment necessary. If you’ve
never used these unique fasteners,
you owe it to yourself to try them
(tapcon.com). they can even be
removed and repositioned easily.
about the only tricky thing that
you may have to do is cut the peg-
board to fit around outlet boxes (4). I
used a jigsaw and a high-speed steel
blade with teeth shaped to cut alumi-
num. The simplest way to make these

panel is tray-
shaped. It has a 
cavity behind it to 
allow space for the 
hooked tool holders 
that fit through 
the peg holes. To 
ensure a consistent 
cavity behind each 
panel, it comes 
with a package 
of peel-and-stick 
spacers that should 
be attached to the 
panel’s back before 
it’s installed.

Use floor flanges on the threaded vertical sections of the

vertical sections, stopping only once the threaded portion 
of pipe is fully engaged in the flange and is snug.
After pipe and fit-
tings are painted, 
spin the parts 
together by hand, 
and then tighten 
them up with a pair 
of pipe wrenches 
turned in opposite 
directions.
A fir plywood backsplash/tool shelf improves the useful-
ness of the bench. This is nothing more than an L-shaped

assembled, bore

openings is to saw a u shape and
then cut out the corners.
building the workbench
I like the old-fashioned, robust look of
1½-in. threaded steel pipe. years ago,
you had to cut and thread such pipe
yourself, but these days, local home
centers will do the work for you. That
made it an easy material for building
the legs of my workbench—one that
gave me both a solid frame and a dis-
tinctive look.
working with precut threaded pipe
is very simple and convenient. I put
together two assemblies, each one
shaped like an h and made of five
straight lengths joined by a pair of t fit-
tings. Four floor flanges are threaded
onto the top and bottom of the verti-
cal legs of each h. Each flange is noth-
ing more than a disc of metal with a
large threaded hole in its center and
smaller unthreaded holes drilled
through its circumference.
to dress up the pipe, I individually
spray-painted each part with a glossy
black paint that has a hammered tex-
ture. before applying the paint, I wiped
down the steel with a clean rag moist-
ened with mineral spirits and covered
the threads with masking tape. keep-
ing the threads bare of paint enabled
me to turn the vertical parts of the h in
and out during the assembly, so I could
fine-tune the components and make
sure everything was the same height—
an especially important consideration
on a wavy concrete basement floor.
From there, I simply had to remove
the tape, turn the pieces together by
hand and snug them up with a pair of
pipe wrenches (5). Then I spun on each
floor flange (6). to install the leg assem-
bly, I flipped the top over and used a  
drill driver to bore pilot holes and drive 
hefty wood screws through the flange 
holes and into the top (7). a word of 
advice if you do this project: don’t 
undersize the pilot holes. The laminated 
maple top is very tough, and it doesn’t 
take screws easily. once the top  
was installed, I built the tool-hanging 
backsplash/shelf and screwed it to the 
top’s back edge (8). when everything 
was done, I rolled two craftsman tool 
cabinets into place (9) and put my tools 
away—in their sleek new home. 
PM
The crowning touch 
of the new work 
area is serious 
tool storage. Two 
rolling Craftsman 
tool chests (model 
59299) are sta-
tioned beneath the 
bench; each has a 
600-pound capacity.

If these simple steps don’t substan-
tially reduce the problem, it may be time
to upgrade how you produce hot water.
Yes, that may include installing an elec-
tric or gas instantaneous water heater,
but that’s a mechanically complex solu-
tion, since it requires additional plumbing
and fuel connections. And if you opt for
the electric water heater, it may also
require a dedicated electrical circuit.
It would probably make more sense
to go with a larger conventional water
heater, since the gas, plumbing and vent
connections for the existing heater are
already in place. Look for an appliance
with a large tank (50 gal) that’s insu-
lated with as high an R-value as possible
(ideally, R-25).
Additionally, the heater’s recovery
rate should also be as high as possible.
This is the rate at which the water heater
can raise the temperature of the inlet
water by 90 F. It’s expressed in gallons
per hour (gph). Typical 50-gal water heat-
ers have recovery rates in the range of
40 gph, but there are heavy-duty models
that go as high as 50 to 60 gph. A few
companies, such as Bock Water Heat-
ers, even offer residential products with
powerful burners that enable recovery
rates as high as 109 to 170 gph. That’s
typically what you would expect from a
small commercial water heater.
Cleaning Concrete
My 5-year-old concrete driveway has
black stains. What are they and how 
do I remove them? I’ve tried bleach 
and concrete cleaners, to no avail.
The stains probably come from tan-
nins, which are present in oak leaves,
acorns and the nuts of other trees, such
as hickory. These are some of the most
common stains on exterior concrete—
and some of the hardest to remove.
First, make a mild solution of wood
bleach (oxalic acid crystals) dissolved in
water. Try an inconspicuous area first.
Apply it to the stains, scrub and rinse.
That might do the trick. If not, either pres-
sure wash the concrete using a nozzle
that produces a broad fan-shaped spray
pattern or use a rental rotary floor scrub-
ber and a brush designed for concrete
and uneven surfaces. No matter what
method you use, go easy. Overly aggres-
sive cleaning can remove the protective
top layer of concrete. This exposes a
Q
We never seem to have
enough hot water. It’s 
not a very big house, so it’s 
not like the water is cooling 
off on its way to the faucets. 
Also, we have a reasonably 
new gas-fired water heater in 
the basement. I don’t under-
stand it, really. I’m consider-
ing installing an instanta-
neous water heater or other 
equipment to improve this. 
What are my options?
 Getting
 More 
 Hot 
 Water 
A
You have lots of options, but
before you call a plumber, take a
few energy-conserving steps. First, flush
the water heater. That will remove any
sediment that’s interfering with heat
transfer from the flame to the water
above. Next, insulate pipes carrying the
heated water to fixtures. Finally, insulate
the hot-water tank itself—just be sure
not to install insulation over the vent or
thermostat. Finally, remove the burner-
chamber access cover and, with the light
out, inspect the flame while the heater is
firing. The flame should be compact and
blue. If it’s yellow or oddly shaped, the
burner may need to be cleaned.

comparatively weak lower layer that
is far more prone to damage from rain,
sun and freeze–thaw cycles.
Roof Framing
I’m building a free-standing garage,
and I’m wondering if it needs a 
ridgeboard. I’ve looked at some old 
garages, sheds and outbuildings, and 
I’ve noticed that many did not have 
ridgeboards, while others used just a 
piece of tongue-and-groove siding or 
sheathing. Is a ridge needed?
Most stick-framed roofs (those not
framed with trusses, in other words)
have a ridge, a horizontal piece of lumber
at the apex of the roof where the rafter
peaks are fastened. There are excep-
tions, especially among sheds and other
small structures. The carpenters who
threw up many of those old buildings
were reluctant to use any more lum-
ber than was absolutely necessary. In
fact, despite their reputation for solid
construction, many older houses are so
scantily built it’s a wonder they’ve stood
as long as they have.
So, let me put it this way: A little
more lumber is always better than a
little less lumber. While a ridgeboard
can be omitted or minimized in down-
and-dirty construction, you can’t go
wrong by installing one. It will keep the
ridgeline from sagging in the future. And
it will simplify construction by providing
a sturdy connection point at the peak of
the roof. Besides, unless you frame the
garage with roof trusses, the town will
almost certainly require a ridgeboard to
grant the building permit.
For a truly sturdy roof, use a ridge
that is at least as wide as (and preferably
wider than) the end cut of the rafter that
meets it. A simple way to ensure this in
most cases is to use a ridge that’s one
lumber size wider than the rafter that
meets it. If you’re using 2 x 6 rafters, for
example, use a 2 x 8 ridge.
Not-So-Royal Flush
My toilet flushes poorly. How do I
correct that?
There are several things you can do. First,
see whether the tank is filling with water
adequately. Lift the tank lid and check
that the water is up to the fill line. If it’s
not, a new fill-valve assembly or adjust-
ments to the old one are in order.
Next, be sure that the waterjet
holes on the bottom of the bowl’s rim
are clear. Use a small mirror to check
this. Clear the holes with a stub of wire

although it’s an 
expensive fix, one 
way to increase 
hot-water comfort is 
to install a hot-water 
circulator—it will 
ensure water com-
ing from the faucet 
is hot as soon as you 
open the tap.
The $240  laing 
autocirc,  for 
example, mounts 
to the wall under a 
sink. The hot-water 
and cold-water sup-
ply lines enter the 
device and lead up 
from it to the faucet. 
When the device’s 
thermostat activates 
the pump, it moves 
the cooled water in 
the hot-water supply 
into the cold-water 
supply and back to 
the water heater. 
The autocirc is 
installed at the sink 
farthest from the 
water heater. The 
only tricky thing is 
that you have to 
install an outlet 
receptacle under  
the sink.
Stick with the filler 
you’re using, but don’t 
wait until it’s fully cured 
to start work on it. First, 
dig out rotted wood with 
a beat-up chisel. Next, 
goop the filler generously 
onto the repair area. The 
filler hardens quickly, so 
without waiting very long, 
take a razor-sharp chisel 
(not the one you used to 
dig out the rot) and pare 
away excess filler before 
it hardens. 
you’ll be amazed. The 
stuff will come off the 
surface in nice big curls 
that have the consistency 
of hard chocolate. repeat 
with another layer if nec-
essary. after two or three 
applications, you should 
have a surface that’s 
pretty close to what you 
need. Sand the remaining 
filler smooth, prime the 
entire surface and paint 
with a semigloss or gloss 
exterior paint.
I’m preparing to do some 
exterior fix-up work this 
spring and plan to touch up 
some rotted exterior wood 
with two-part epoxy wood 
filler. I like the way the 
product looks after it’s 
smoothed, but I hate using 
it because it’s so much 
harder than wood. It takes 
forever to sand down. Is 
there a filler that’s easier 
to use but still stands up to 
outdoor use?

traveling to tomorrow afternoon’s car
show. one savvy counterman, an old-
school guy, has a suggestion: he knows
that the cylinder bore on your caliper is
common to several other cars. and he
does have generic brake piston seals
in your size. you rush over to his store
and pick up a set of seals and a couple
of pints of fresh brake fluid. Price: less
than your lunch at the fast-food drive-
through window.
one caveat: if your frozen caliper is
a rear caliper, with attendant parking-
brake cables and internal antipush-
back hardware, you’ll need to consult
the service manual for rebuild advice.
also, take note that we’re talking
about calipers here. if your rotors are
out of true, worn too thin or scored
by the dragging pads, you’ll need to
remove and machine or replace them
as well. your brake system is not a
good place to cut corners. okay, i’m
off my safety soapbox. you may now
return to your regularly scheduled
saturday mechanic.
brake it down
first loosen the lug nuts, block
the rear wheels and get the car up
on jackstands. here’s your chance
to break all of the caliper bolts loose
while that caliper is still mounted to
something solid. Judicious tapping and
some penetrating oil should help break
the bleeder bolt loose. use a flare-nut
wrench on the bleeder—it’s less likely
to round off the small, hollow bolt.
odds are, if the rubber flex line
screws directly into the caliper casting,
front wheels is too hot to touch. you
limp the few blocks home at low speed.
now your saturday morning drive has
just mutated from a fun-filled jaunt into
an afternoon’s worth of work chasing
down a replacement caliper. a quick
trip to the auto parts store, followed by
a round of phone calls to dealerships
and stores within an increasingly large
radius turns up nothing. you’ll have to
rebuild the caliper yourself.
most brake calipers that fail get
replaced with either a new part or a
rebuilt one. indeed, we picked up a
rebuilt caliper for this story at the local
naPa store. industry-wide, it’s com-
mon practice to return used calipers
to a central rebuilding station where
the caliper assembly is rebuilt. it will be
stripped to the basic casting, cleaned
of all vestiges of road grime by auto-
mated equipment, and glass-bead-
blasted or shot-peened to remove
any and all corrosion and rust. after a
quick inspection, it’s reassembled with
a new piston, seal and bleeder bolt.
inside the box with the like-new caliper
assembly, you’ll find fresh sliding pins
and any other hardware that should be
replaced—and sometimes, new pads
as well. all you need to do is install the
caliper, bleed it, and you’re back on
the road in a few minutes. often, the
modest price of this rebuilt assembly is
less than the over-the-counter price of
the aggregate parts you’d have to buy
separately to rebuild the unit yourself.
no wonder pro mechanics rarely bother
to rebuild calipers anymore.
but you’ve gotten the bad news
from at least a half-dozen countermen
in the last hour—no rebuilt, or even
new, calipers until the middle of next
week. and that scotches your plan for

way with moderate finger pressure. if
not, find out why. remove the piston

brake Pad tech
not all brake pads are created equal.
There’s a choice today of various friction
materials used in pads to do the work
of actually stopping your car. asbes-
tos used to be a major component of
brake pads, but osha regulations now
make this carcinogen scarce. organic
materials such as kevlar, often found
in oem brake applications, represent a
compromise of pad life, braking aggres-
siveness, dusty wheels and noise. if
you’re interested in a longer-lasting pad
material, look into a premium metallic
or ceramic lining. These materials can
sometimes squeal or hiss, wear out the
discs faster and cover the front wheels
with ugly dust. Performance cars, like
that Corvette of yours, might stop bet-
ter with metallic pads. The downside is
that those polished rims—aside from
the cost—will be covered in gray dust
after a day’s drive. 
PM
We sawed this 
GM caliper in 
half so you could 
see inside—this 
shows evidence 
of serious corro-
sion pitting  
in the base of  
the bore. We 
cleaned it with 
600-grit paper.
Once everything 
is clean, put it all 
back together. 
Be sure to tidy 
up or replace any 
sliding pins or 
raceways so the 
caliper can move 
back and forth as 
the pads wear.
you may need to remove
the rubber brake line at
the far end first. ditto
when using a flare-nut
wrench on the brake
line. Consider replacing
the steel or rubber brake
lines if they are older than
your dog.
on the bench
strip the caliper of the
pads, shims, springs and
sliders or pins. remove
the outer dust seal, too.
now you need to remove
the piston—but you’ll
quickly realize there’s no
way to grab it. get a
piece of wood slightly thicker than
both brake pads stacked together. Put
that wood in the caliper aft of the pis-
ton, and add low-pressure compressed
air to the inlet port. Pop! your piston is
out. and so is your little finger if you’re
not paying attention. The same goes
for your corneas if you don’t cover the
whole deal with a shop towel to con-
tain the flying brake fluid. if the piston
is stuck—which is how we got into this
mess—the process may take a little
more time and pressure. if your caliper
has more than one piston, use more
wood, clamps or whatever to release
one at a time.
inspect the piston. rebuild kits usu-
ally include a new piston, but if you’re
gleaning from generic parts, you may
be stuck, literally. minor surface
blemishes can be polished out with wet
2000-grit sandpaper, but any pits in
the metal means replacement will be
necessary. i’ve had replacement pis-
tons machined out of stainless-steel
bar stock for oddball cars.
to get the o-ring free, use something
that won’t damage the caliper bore.
odds are, corrosion built up between
the piston and bore is what made things
stick. unlike surface damage to the
piston, minor pitting of the bore is no
big deal—the square-cut o-ring seals
between its recessed groove and the
piston, not to the outer bore. Clean up
the bore surface with wet 600-grit wet-
or-dry paper, then thoroughly clean the
entire caliper of all dirt, rust, abrasives
and old brake fluid with hot, soapy
water. some two-piston calipers may
have internal rubber seals—so no hydro-
carbon solvents, please.

It could just be that the cylinder
walls are rusty and the rings aren’t
sealing well—but in that case I’d expect
more cylinder-to-cylinder variation.
odds are, all four aren’t rusting equally,
because the pistons couldn’t have all
stopped the same distance up the cyl-

rust where a piston has held oil next to
Q 
I’m trying to resurrect a 
classic Datsun sedan 
that’s been sitting in my 
garage for years. hey, it gets 
better mileage than my 
pickup. The compression on 
all cylinders is only around 
110 pounds. Why is it so low? 
Patience, Grasshopper.
i’ve been warning people 
recently that leaving 
new-style precious-metal 
spark plugs in place for 
their normal 100K service 
life will marry them to the 
soft aluminum cylinder 
head, resulting in stripped 
threads when it’s time to 
replace them. technical  
service bulletin (tsb)  
no. 08-7-6 requires a spe-
cial procedure to get the 
job done. soak the plug 
with carb cleaner for a few 
minutes after cracking the 
threads loose. This will 
allow some of the carbon 
that has built up between 
the plug’s ground shield 
and the cylinder head to 
dissolve. next, work the 
plug out with a back-and-
forth rotation to clear  
the carbon. The tsb 
then details an elaborate 
procedure to remove the 
parts of the plug that are 
left behind. options are: 
Find a Ford mechanic who 
will either attempt this  
pro cedure or remove the 
cylinder head. The tsb 
ends by suggesting a 
smear of antiseize com-
pound on the area to pre-
vent this from recurring.
a Low blow
the iron liner, but plenty of rust above or
below. a pitted, rusty surface doesn’t
seal as well as one in good condition,
although some rusty surfaces will
clean up a little if you run the engine
for a while.
I think you need to redo that com-
pression test in a few days, because I
suspect it wasn’t done properly. Start
by warming up the engine, but not
so hot that you burn yourself while
removing the plugs—all of them. The
compression numbers are heavily influ-
enced by how fast the engine spins
during testing, and removing the plugs
will reduce drag. be sure the battery
is fully charged and in good enough
a compression 
test can be very 
diagnostic, but 
only if done 
properly.

Corrosive Question
I have a 2002 Chevy Impala whose
fuel gauge failed after 50,000 miles.
I used an additive to the gas to 
clean the corroded contact points 
on the gauge. This may have helped 
clean the fuel pump, but it did 
nothing for the gauge. The only fix 
someone suggested to me was to 
install a new fuel pump and gauge 
unit. And that costs more than 
$400. What is the cause of this 
problem—and do ethanol additives 
in gas contribute to it?
alcohol, in concentrations as high as 10
percent, is used to reduce carbon mon-
oxide emissions because the alcohol
molecule contains oxygen, something
missing in the petrochemical soup we
call gasoline. alcohol is corrosive, and
I’m seeing a lot of complaints about
failing fuel-gauge senders. Don’t blame
the petroleum companies—alcohol
percentages are mandated by the EPa.
biodegradable ethanol is used instead
of MtbE and EtbE, since these harmful
chemicals were found in groundwater,
almost certainly from leaking under-
ground storage tanks. Flex-fuel cars,
rated to run on mixtures of ethanol as
high as 85 percent, have more alcohol-
tolerant parts in the fuel system.
Now, about your problem: the
fuel-gauge sender is a simple rheostat
with metal contacts that slide along a
resistor as the float goes up and down.
gauges fail when these contacts start
to get dirty and corroded. It’s a simple
procedure to clean or replace this unit—
which is indeed available without buy-
ing a new pump. Problem is, the whole
business is located inside the fuel tank,
which has to be drained and removed.
It’s not a simple task if you don’t have
a lift or a floor jack and stands. It’s
potentially dangerous too. That makes
the labor to have this done a significant
issue. but $400 to replace the pump–
sender assembly is a decent price. you
could yank the tank yourself if you feel
up to it and try cleaning the contacts
with some 400-grit wet-or-dry sandpa-
per and electrical contact cleaner.
The cheapest solution is a 30-cent
grease pencil to write the mileage of
the last fill-up on the windshield.
Sign of the times
I recently purchased crossbars for
my 2008 Toyota Highlander’s roof 
rack. The instructions on removing 
the rear caps were very ambiguous. 
I attempted to remove these end 
caps, but it appeared that I was 
going to destroy these flimsy plastic 
pieces. Any assistance would be 
greatly appreciated.
I read the instructions too: you’re right—
not very helpful. Maybe the instructions
in the box with the rack parts was dif-
shape to deliver a full current to the
starter motor. If the battery is low, the
engine won’t spin fast enough to get a
good reading.
The most common mistake people
make when doing a compression test
is not opening the throttle fully while
cranking the engine. a closed throttle
will leave a vacuum in the intake, low-
ering the reading. In fact, even low
barometric pressure will affect it. I
prefer the screw-in-style compression
gauge to the type that just seals with a
rubber stopper. Crank the engine over
for six full pulses to be sure you’re get-
ting the highest reading.
Still low? try spraying a teaspoon-

REACH DOWN and lift up 
the brake pedal with your 
fingers. There should be 
approximately ¼ to ½ 
in. of free play before it 
hits the upper stop. Is 
there more or less move-
ment than that? Several 
things can go wrong 
here: If the pedal pivot 
gets sticky and doesn’t 
allow the pedal itself to 
return freely, or if you’ve 
replaced the master 
cylinder and the amount 
of pedal free-play is too 
small, the master-cylinder 
piston will never return 
to its fully extended 
position. That, in turn, 
will trap brake fluid in the 
master cylinder—which 
will prevent the pistons 
in the brake calipers or 
drums from returning, 
and your brakes will drag. 
Too much play will give 
you a low, spongy pedal. 
Fortunately, the pushrod 
between the brake pedal 
and the master cylinder 
is adjustable. First, make 
sure the brake pedal 
pivot is moving freely—
I’ve seen rust and disin-
tegrated bushings freeze 
this joint. Same for the

you need to do now is to 
loosen the jam nut and 
shorten or lengthen the 
pushrod by turning it

ance. A small amount of

should translate to  
about a quarter-inch at

More Lenerically, interior and ex terior

and more fraLile, and they are more 
and more often snap-in parts rather 
than those attached with a screw or 
bolt. It makes life simple on the produc-

may need to remove these pieces sev-

Solved Simply
I have a 1993 Chrysler 
FiBh Avenue with around 
120,000 miles on the 
 ticker. Every time I ?art 
the car and press the 
brake to put it into drive 
or reverse, the ABS 
liCht comes on for a few 
seconds and I can hear the 
ABS pump. Also, the ABS 
liCht comes on occasion-
ally when I press hard on 
the brakes. When that 
happens, I ?ill hear the 
pump. @e brakes are ﬁne 
otherwise.
Every time any car with 
ABS is started, the ABS 
com puter Loes throuLh 
a power-on self-test: The 
first time the brake pedal 
is depressed, the hydraulic 
pump and solenoid valves 
in the ABS control unit cycle 
brieﬂy. So yours sounds like 
it’s workinL as desiLned. 
And if you press the brake 
pedal firmly enough, the 
ABS syNem will kick in and 
prevent the wheels from 
lockinL up. When that hap-
pens, the ABS liLht on the 
dash comes on and the 
pump motor runs briefly. 
So this also sounds like it’s 
workinL as desiLned. 
Unless these symptoms 
have juN cropped up, there’s 
no problem.

if your tires are underinﬂated 
without a tire- pressure CauCe.” 
I don’t believe this ?atement is 
entirely accurate. I ju? purchased 
a 2008 Subaru Tribeca with a 
tire-pressure monitorinC sy?em 
(TPMS). In cooler temperatures, 
the pressure in the tires has Cone 
down, and the monitorinC sy?em 
alerted me to this faA (the tire 
was about 5 or 6 pounds below 
its required pressure). I admit the 
sy?em doesn’t provide aAual 
pressure readouts, but it’s a Cood 
safety check. Don’t you aCree? 
All cars and liLht trucks sold in the 
U.S. since 2007 have a TPMS, as 
man dated by the Department of 
Transportation (DOT).  And I prediM 
that these syNems will have little 
eﬀeM on how poorly the American 
drivinL public maintains its tire pres-
sures. JuN the opposite: consum-
ers, beinL the lazy dolts they are, 
will assume their tire pressures are 
ﬁne because the TIRE PRESSURE 
warninL liLht on the dash isn’t lit. 
Pere are two types of syNems. 
The best—and more expensive—
uses a radio transponder mounted 
inside the tire. With this type, you 
can usually call up the individual tire 
pressures on a dashboard display. 
Pe second uses data from the 
ABS/traction-control system. An 
underinﬂated tire will have a rollinL 
radius smaller than the other three, 
and consequently will rotate faNer 
than the others. When the differ-
ence in rotation becomes extreme 
enouLh, the low-pressure alarm 
Loes oﬀ. Pere are several problems 
with this. If the outside air temp 
Loes from very hot to very cold, all 
four tires will lose pressure equally, 
and the alarm won’t sound. 
Pere’s an even biLLer issue, as 
far as I’m concerned: Neither type of 
monitorinL syNem sets oﬀ the warn-
inL indicator until, as you’ve discov-
ered, the pressure is 5 or 6 pounds 
too low—the spec required by law is 
25 percent below the recommended 
pressure.
And that’s juN plain too low. It’s 
low enouLh to accelerate tire wear 
and raise rolling resistance to the 
point where it aﬀeMs fuel economy. 
More important, it’s low enouLh to 
affect handling and braking, espe-
cially in rainy or snowy conditions.
Any driver who relies on the TPMS 
to tell him he needs air is LoinL to 
spend a lot of miles drivinL on dan-
Lerously underinﬂated tires. Pe DOT 
dropped the ball when they set the 
permissible amount of underinfla-
tion. Pere’s Nill no subNitute for a 
$10 tire LauLe in your Llove box.
False Positive
I have a 1994 Jeep Cherokee 
Sport. @e brakes have been 
bled multiple times and I ?ill Cet 
sponCiness in the pedal. @e front 
disc brakes work, but the rear 
brakes never seem to Cet up to 
pressure. When the vehicle is up 
on blocks, the front wheels ?op 
if the brakes are applied, but the 
rears keep turninC. I have replaced 
the rear cylinders and the ma?er 
cylinder. What’s CoinC on here?
Pe sponLiness is probably air in the 
syNem—if you have ABS, the manual 
calls for a conventional bleed, fol-
lowed by a bleed with the Chrysler 
scan tool to cycle the pump and sole-
noids in the ABS controller, followed 
by a second conventional bleed.
Sound like a lot of work? I’ve Lot-
ten Lood at workinL on brake sys-
tems without ever introducinL any 
air into the syNem—it’s Nill possible 
to successfully ﬂush the syNem with 
fresh ﬂuid without hookinL it up to 
the tricorder.
As far as the ineffectiveness of 
the rear brakes: If you have the rear 
suspension at full droop with the 
frame up on stands, the load com-
pensation valve will interpret that as 
a liLhtly loaded rear suspension and 
reduce the brake pressure to the 
rears to nearly nothinL. I bet the situ-
ation will be diﬀerent if you put the 
Nands underneath the axle inNead 
of the frame rail. Give that a try and

Why can’t a computer be more
like a television? When you push the
power button on a tV, it just turns
on. Computers, on the other hand,
boot—as in, they take so long to get
started that you want to stick your
boot into them.
you would think that the march
of technological progress would have
reduced boot times over the years,
but newer operating systems can
take longer—Microsoft Vista actually
tends to boot more slowly than its
predecessor, Windows XP. (Microsoft
claims its next-generation operating
system, Windows 7, should provide
drastic improvements in boot time.)
additionally, boot times increase
with a computer’s age. as you use
your PC and more programs and
devices are installed, the startup pro-
cess gets even longer. and these
slow boot times can lead to bad
behavior. Many users become so
frustrated that they leave their com-
puters on constantly, wasting elec-
tricity and delaying valuable os
security updates.
but take heart: There are steps
you can take to speed things along.
Make your PC boot Faster

check programs that load at startup
and disable anything unnecessary.
you can also access the list of
startup applications in either Vista or
XP through the Msconfig utility (type
“msconfig” into the run box in the
start menu). select the startup tab,
then uncheck any applications you
think might be slowing your startup.
both options allow you to disable a
program’s startup component without
completely removing it. so if you dis-
able something and then discover that
it was vital to the operation of your
PC, you can always turn it back on.
inevitably, you’ll find programs in
your startup configuration that you’ve
never heard of before. to sort it all
out, consult an online reference such
as sysinfo. This site categorizes start-
up entries according to how neces-
sary they are. on one of our test PCs
we found avgtray.exe configured as a
startup operation. this miniprogram
was a part of the aVg antivirus soft-
ware suite and was designed to
launch aVg from an icon in the sys-
tem tray at the bottom right of the
Windows home screen. sysinfo cate-
gorized avgtray.exe as “user’s Choice,”
meaning that it’s not imperative to
the PC’s operation but could be use-
ful, so we decided to keep it. Many of
the items we found in the startup
menus of our test PCs were software
that could be started on an as-needed
basis, but didn’t need to be launched
at startup, so we disabled them.
Cut the splash screen
if you’re serious about shaving every
last second of startup time, dip into
depending on the configuration of
your computer, many of the various
system checks and processes that
take place during boot-up may be
unnecessary or irrelevant to you. a
variety of tricks of varying sophistica-
tion can reclaim valuable minutes or
seconds of get-up-and-go time. We
tested expert tactics on three well-
used computers in PM’s tech lab.
ditch dusty Programs
as a general rule, an uncluttered com-
puter is a fast computer. The easiest
step to speed startup is to remove
software that you no longer use. Many
of these seemingly fallow programs
are running active background pro-
cesses that launch every time you
push the power button. This doesn’t
just slow down your startup, it chews
up raM and drags down the overall
performance of your PC.
to get a full list of installed soft-
ware, check Control Panel in Vista and
select remove Programs (in XP go to
add/remove Programs). if you find
programs that you’re not using or that
support equipment you no longer own,
eliminate them.
one of our test computers, a
3-year-old XP machine, had more
than two dozen programs that hadn’t
been used in years. after we removed
them, the machine’s boot time was
reduced from 2 minutes 45 seconds
to 2 minutes 21 seconds. across all
three of our computers, the biggest
offender was aiM instant-messaging
software. removing it shaved an aver-
age of 8 seconds off boot time.
even brand-new PCs can be junked
up with useless applications, known as
trialware, that load processes at start-
up. since these programs aren’t for-
mally installed on your system, they
may not show up in your remove Pro-
grams list. that shouldn’t stop you 
from getting rid of them if you have no 
intention of using the software.
The easiest way to purge unwanted 
trialware is by using a program called, 
believe it or not, PC decrapifier. This 
free, downloadable tool specifically 
targets trial software and puts it on a
chopping block for you to eliminate.
on a dell laptop we analyzed,
decrapifier found several programs
imploring users to “get high speed
internet!” from service providers
angling for new business. delete!
reconfigure
Pushy software 
some startup slowdowns come from
software that you do use, but don’t
necessarily need running in your sys-
tem’s background. Many programs
have components that load at startup,
then monitor your os constantly. That
makes perfect sense for antivirus soft-
ware that must continually watch for
suspicious activity on your PC, but it’s
probably not necessary to have the
software that came with your digital
camera always running so that it can
instantly offload pictures.
there are a few ways to check
which programs are muscling into
your startup sequence. in Vista, you
can manage startup applications
through Windows defender, Micro-
soft’s built-in program that monitors
for spyware, pop-ups and performance
drags. defender has an integrated tool
called software explorer that lets you

Macs
Need  
Speed,  
Too
In our tests, mac oS X natively booted faster than microsoft Vista, but Macs
are susceptible to slow boot times too. And often, it’s because of the same 
problems. “If your Mac is taking a long time to boot, the main culprit is probably 
startup software,” says Ben Casey, a Mac technician at TekServe in New York. 
“Check for erroneous applications and delete what you don’t need launching every 
time.” If you have multiple accounts on one Mac, edit the list of startup programs 
for individual users by going to the Accounts panel of System Preferences and 
selecting Login Items. Also, look in the universal startup folder, which controls what 
loads for all users. (It is called Startup Items, in the Library folder on your hard 
drive). The shorter these lists, the quicker your machine will start up.
If your computer is still taking too long to boot, try clearing your caches using a 
free piece of software called Onyx (titanium.free.fr/pgs/english.html). The first boot 
after purging your caches will take longer than usual, because the computer needs 
to reconstruct those caches from scratch, but the resulting up-to-date caches will 
allow for a faster boot time. — E.S.

the boot tab in the Msconfig utility,
which controls the settings for the
boot initialization/configuration file.
generally, users should tread carefully
when tinkering with boot.ini, but one
easy edit is to check the “/noguiboot”
option. This saves time by skipping the
Windows startup animation.
edit your bios
before the operating system loads up
on your computer, software on the
motherboard known as the bios
(basic input output system) governs
the configuration of the PC’s hard-
ware. as with the boot.ini file, it’s advis-
able to tread carefully in the bios to
avoid disabling something important,
but a few well-placed tweaks can save
valuable seconds when you boot.
The bios sets the boot sequence
for your PC and makes sure all the
components—like the video card,
memory and hard drive—function
together. to get to the bios on most
computers, you hit one of the function
keys (usually F2, F10 or F12; your com-
puter should prompt you on the screen
during startup). The bios checks each
drive attached to your computer for an
operating system to boot from, but it
doesn’t always check in the most logi-
cal order. on one of our test laptops,
the bios was looking at the usb drive
and optical drive before checking the
hard drive where the os is installed. i
rearranged the boot order to check the
hard drive first.
Most bioss scan the computer
memory for errors at startup, but if you
haven’t made any modifications to
your raM or noticed any errors, this
probably can be skipped. if your bios
has a Quick boot or skip Memory
Check function, you can save a few
extra seconds.
Clean up the registry
The registry is a database in both Win-
dows Vista and XP that stores informa-
tion about your hardware, software
preferences and user profiles. When-
ever you change something in Win-
dows, it is logged in the registry. but
when software is deleted or hardware
is upgraded, the registry isn’t always
updated properly, so it can end up full
of outdated, useless entries. unlike the
Msconfig utility and bios, casual dele-
tions from the registry can cause irre-
versible damage, so it is no place for an
inexperienced computer user to go tin-
kering on his own. but a good software
solution can help clean it out for you.
Free programs such as CCleaner and
glary utilities, as well as more fully fea-
tured pay software such as system
Mechanic ($50), are available for down-
load online and will scrub the registry
for “keys” left over from old applica-
tions no longer resident on your
machine. These may be delaying boot
time by causing the computer to scan
for nonexistent programs during
startup. a clean registry makes the
whole process more efficient.
how much time you’ll gain overall
depends entirely on how messed up
your computer was in the first place.
Cleaning out all of the digital clutter
still won’t make your computer
instant-on, but it should make the
wait more bearable.

Q
My car doesn’t have a built-in iPod dock. What’s the
best way to play my MP3s while I drive around?
iPod Auto
Control?  
To use one, simply plug one end
into the MP3 player’s headphone jack
and the other into the tape deck.
If your automobile has a cassette
player, there is no easier way to get
interference-free listening.
Option 3: Wired FM Modulator
InStallatIon: Moderate
SounD qualIty: Good
 With wireless FM transmitters, the
signal has to travel through high-traffic
airwaves on its way to your car
antenna. Wired FM modulators, which
usually come as small boxes with a
few cords running out from them,
intercept the connection between the
car’s antenna and radio, allowing you
to inject your iPod’s signal directly into
this wired pathway. The result is dra-
matically improved sound quality—
although the final result is still ham-
pered by the limitations of FM radio,
which is far from audiophile-friendly.
These modulators are inexpensive
(they can be found online for as little as

owners of dockless vehicles can patch together a method for streaming

setups will sound much better than others.
well. And while this problem is particu-
larly pronounced in cities with crowded
airwaves, the issue exists nearly every-
where in the country. There’s another
downside to FM transmitters: Even
under ideal conditions, FM radio just
can’t deliver excellent sound quality.
That being said, FM transmitters
are extremely convenient and, with
many models selling for as little as
$15, affordable. If you decide to use
one, choose a model that lets you pick
any FM frequency (some restrict you to
a few stations on the top or bottom of
the spectrum). This will increase your
odds of finding an open channel.
Option 2: Cassette Adapter
InStallatIon: Easy
SounD qualIty: Good
 Audio cassette adapters take advan-
tage of an increasingly rare feature: a
car’s tape player. These adapters are
shaped exactly like a cassette tape.
They are cheap (around $15), common-
place and deliver decent sound quality.
Option 1: Wireless FM Transmitter
InStallatIon: Easy
SounD qualIty: Poor
 FM transmitters are the most popu-
lar and convenient way of playing an
MP3 device through a car stereo. They
typically plug into an iPod’s dock or
headphone jack to create what is
essentially a low-wattage pirate radio
station—powerful enough to be picked
up by your car radio inches away, but
not strong enough to interfere with
neighboring car radios.
Unfortunately, these transmitters
need to compete with real (and far
more powerful) radio stations and are
easily swamped by 6000 watts of clas-
sic rock. When this happens, the sound
that comes out of the speakers can be
a cacophonous mix of static, local
radio stations and whatever your iPod
is playing. This problem is exacerbated
by FCC regulations, which prohibit FM 
transmitters from broadcasting at 
greater than 18.75 nanowatts, essen-
tially ensuring that they won’t work

Frozen Screens
I’m an avid tail/ater. Is there  
any dan/er in brin/in/ my LCD TV

cry.als freeze? 
TailOate with conﬁdence. LCD manu-
facturers regularly test their sets to 
make sure they can hold up to freezinO 
temperatures. Sony, for example, chills 
its TVs for a full day at both 14 F and 
minus 4 F. Le ﬁndinOs: While the sets 
can survive a Green Bay winter with-
out suﬀerinO any permanent damaOe, 
the cold can cause piMure quality to

lonO as you are comfortable ﬁddlinO 
with your car Nereo’s wires.  
To install one, position yourself 
underneath the dash. Reach up and 
unpluO the antenna from the back of 
the Nereo and pluO it into the modula-
tor’s antenna input. Take the modula-
tor’s output cord and conneM it to the 
Nereo’s antenna input. You can then 
set the modulator to run at any FM fre-
quency. Pick one with weak competinO 
siOnals (usually at the very top or bot-
tom of the spectrum), and plug the 
modulator’s audio output cord into your 
iPod’s headphone jack. 
Option 4: Stereo  
With Line-In Port
INSTALLATION: Moderate 
SOUND QUALITY: Very Good
 If you’re lucky, your car Nereo has a 
headphone-size line-in port riOht on 
the front. If so, all you have to do is jack 
your MP3 player into this hole, tune 
your Nereo source to “Auxiliary,” and 
crank some tunes. Unfortunately, moN 
car Nereos lack this port. InNallinO a 
new car stereo that has one is one 
method for OettinO excellent sound 
usinO your iPod. New Nereos with the 
port can be purchased for under $100 
and inNalled either by you or a profes-
sional. (Some shops oﬀer free inNalla-
tion with purchase.)
 
Option 5: RCA Port
INSTALLATION: Moderate 
SOUND QUALITY: Very Good
 Some car stereos—primarily ones 
with CD players —include an RCA jack 
in the back. HijackinO this audio connec-
tion from the CD player will provide 
excellent sound quality for music com-
inO oﬀ an iPod. FirN Nep: Remove the 
Nereo. If there is an RCA port, you will 
see dual jacks—one with a red and one 
with a white input (similar to the RCA 
jacks on home Nereos). RCA-to-head-
phone cords can be bouOht for a few

Button Lint
I’ve had my iPhone for nearly two 
years. Recently, I’ve had to press  
the Home button harder for it to 
respond, and sometimes have had to 
try several presses. What’s up?
In all likelihood, the culprit is nothinO 
more than simple pocket lint. PM 
senior technoloOy editor Glenn 
Derene had a similar problem with his 
ﬁrN-Oeneration iPhone. Because his 
phone was no lonOer under warranty, 
havinO Apple ﬁx or replace it would 
have coN him about as much as buy-
inO a new iPhone 3G. So, once his

open the case and perform diaOnosis 
through dissection. His findings:

reversible surOery that tech-savvy 
iPhone owners have pioneered over 
the paN year. He aMually had to break

Glenn’s, your phone is no lonOer under

your only option. 
Free Books
I have an E Ink e-book reader, but  
the co. of buyin/ books is addin/ 
up. Is there any le/al way of usin/ my 
reader to view e-books for free? 
Because their static screens don’t 
ﬂicker like an LCD, E Ink e-book read-
ers such as the Amazon Kindle and 
Sony Reader are easy on your eyes 
and easy on their own batteries. (Ley 
draw power only to load new paOes, 
not to display the content, allowinO a 
single charge to last through thou-
sands of paOes.) While the manufac-
turers miOht love it if every e-book you 
read was purchased from 
their online Nores at about 
$10 a pop, you have other 
options. The Internet is 
ﬁlled with Web sites eaOer 
to dispense virtual versions 
of books that have lapsed 
into the public domain. And 
some of these sites, such 
as ManyBooks, have even 
beOun oﬀerinO up versions 
that are specially formatted 
for the Kindle (.azw files) 
and Reader (.lrf). You won’t 
ﬁnd any recent beN sellers 
in the public domain, but 
it’s filled with time-tested 
classics—more Huckleberry 
Finn than Harry Potter. 
BrinOinO a Web-found 
e-book to your reader is 
easy—download it onto an 
SD card and insert it.

Chris Higgins has destroyed more bridges than any flood or 
earthquake. a structural engineer at oregon State University’s 
Kiewit Center, he casts concrete bridge parts and exposes them to stresses that cause 
real-world bridges to fail, such as repeated freeze-and-thaw cycles and the weight and 
pressure of traffic loads. higgins also examines bridges in the field—but he doesn’t dam-
age them. honest. “People ask, ‘are bridges safe?’” he says. “That’s like saying, ‘are people 
disease-free?’ Every one is unique. Every one is different.”  — Michael Milstein
1. Strong Floor 
Before higgins can crush 
bridge components, he needs a 
good foundation. This 5-ft-thick 
concrete pad is reinforced with 
four layers of steel bars; it can 
withstand up to 5000 psi. 
2. Load Frame
This structure—built of 
hot-rolled steel columns and 
girders—is anchored to the 
strong floor. It holds bridge 
parts while researchers 
squeeze and stress them.
3. Hydraulic Actuators
hydraulic arms each apply up 
to 500,000 pounds of force 
to parts in the load frame; a 
spreader beam disperses force 
across the parts. “We’re trying 
to mimic 50 years of service life 
in a short time,” higgins says.
4. Sensors
higgins and his crew embed 
or attach as many as 200 
sensors to bridge pieces. Each 
sensor is hard-wired and feeds 
data into computers as forces 
on the bridge parts increase, 
offering valuable information 
on how and when bridges fail. 
5. Cameras
When concrete fractures, 
“your first reaction is to duck,” 
higgins says. “We’re usually 
not looking when it goes.”  
he records tests with digital 
still and video cameras,  
then examines the footage 
frame by frame to find hidden 
weaknesses.
6. Safety Shields
Destroying bridges is danger-
ous work; to avoid concrete 
shrapnel, higgins stands 
behind a panel of 
-in.-thick 
polycarbonate safety glass.
