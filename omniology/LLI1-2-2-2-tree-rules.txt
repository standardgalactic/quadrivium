Tree Concepts
closure: A branch of a tree is closed when it contains a formula and
its negation. It is open otherwise.

closure: A branch of a tree is closed when it contains a formula and

partially developed trees: A partially developed tree for a set Σ of
formulas is a proof tree starting with the formulas in Σ, in which
each formula in the tree is either in Σ, or follows from formulas
higher up in the tree, by way of the tree rules.

notation: We write “Σ ⊢” to say that a tree for Σ closes. We write
“Σ ⊢A” for “Σ, ∼A ⊢”; in words “there is a proof from Σ to A”.
