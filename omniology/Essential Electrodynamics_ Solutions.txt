Preface
Preface
This book gives the solutions to the exercises at the end of each chapter of my book “Essential
Electrodynamics” (also published by Ventus Publishing ApS). I recommend that you attempt
a particular exercise after reading the relevant chapter, and before looking at the solutions
published here.
Often there is more than one way to solve a problem, and obviously one should use any valid
method that gets the result with the least eﬀort. Usually this means looking for symmetry in the
problem – for example from the information given can we say that from symmetry arguments
the ﬁeld we need to derive can only be pointing in a certain direction. If so, we only need to
calculate the component of the ﬁeld in that direction, or we may be able to use Gauss’ law or
Ampère’s law to enable us to write down the result. In some of these exercise solutions the
simplest route to the solution is deliberately not taken in order to illustrate other methods of
solving a problem, but in these cases the simpler method is pointed out.
The solutions to the exercise problems for each chapter of “Essential Electrodynamics” are
presented here in the corresponding chapters of “Essential Electrodynamics - Solutions”.
I hope you ﬁnd these exercises useful.
If you ﬁnd typos or errors I would appreciate you
letting me know. Suggestions for improvement are also welcome – please email them to me at

1–1 A magnetic dipole of moment m = mz is located at the origin. A thin circular conducting
ring of radius a vibrates such that the position of its centre is r = [z0 + b cos(ωt)]z with
b ≪a ≪z0. The plane of the ring remains parallel to the x—y plane during the vibration.
Find the emf around the ring in the ϕ direction.

(a) Using cylindrical coordinates but with R being the cylindrical radius to avoid confusion
with the charge density ρ(r), specify the current density J(R, ϕ, z) as a function of position.
In the limit h ≪a ﬁnd the magnetic dipole moment.
(b) Consider a circular loop of radius R0 around the z-axis at height z0 above the disc for
the case R0 ≪a ≪z0. Find the magnetic ﬂux through the loop, and hence ﬁnd the vector
potential at the loop.
(c) If, due to friction in the axle, the disc’s angular velocity is decreasing exponentially
with time t as ω(t) = ω0e−t/t0, where t0 is the decay time scale, ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld at
the loop at time t = 0.

1–3 A light rigid rectangular circuit with resistance R has mass m attached to the middle
of the lower side (width s), and the top side is suspended horizontally using frictionless
bearings to form a simple pendulum of length h as shown in the diagram below. In the
absence of a magnetic ﬁeld the position of the pendulum mass would be described by
rm(t) ≈h θ0 cos(ωt) x where ω =

(a) Assuming the position of the pendulum mass is still described by rm(t) ≈h θ0 cos(ωt) x,
what is the magnetic ﬂux ΦB(t) through the circuit, and hence the emf as a function of
time? Take the direction around the circuit indicated by the arrow to correspond to positive
emfs and currents.
(b) What is the force on the lower side of the circuit due to the magnetic ﬁeld? What
is the instantaneous work done by the pendulum against this force? Compare this with
instantaneous power dissipated in the circuit? What are the consequences of the presence
of the magnetic ﬁeld for the motion of the pendulum?
Solution
(a) The magnetic ﬂux through the circuit is

(1.26)
and since v(t) = dr/dt = −ωhθ0 sin(ωt) x, we note that F(t) is in the opposite direction to
v(t). The instantaneous work done by the pendulum against this force is

(c) The pendulum’s amplitude θ0 will decay over time. To determine the rate of decay, we
can consider ﬁrst consider the average rate of energy loss of the pendulum which is equal
to the time-average of the power dissipated as heat

If we had not been asked explicitly to use the Maxwell stress tensor we could have arrived
at the same result in a simpler way by noting that the momentum density is g = S/c2,
and that for an EM wave S = u c k. Pressure will be the magnitude of the momentum ﬂux

Electromagnetic waves in empty space and linear dielectrics
2–1 Prove that the spherical waves given by
f(r, t) = f0 r−1 exp[i(±kr −ωt)]
(2.1)
are solutions of the 3D wave equation.
Solution
We need to show that this is a solution of the three-dimensional wave equation
∇2f =
1
v2p
∂2f
∂t2 .
(2.2)
Using the Laplacian in spherical coordinates and noting that f has no dependence on θ or
ϕ then the left hand side of Eq. 2.2 is
∇2f = 1

(2.7)
Now since vp = ω/k the right hand side of Eq. 2.2 is
1
v2p
∂2f
∂t2
= −1
v2p
ω2f = −k2f
(2.8)
and so the 3D wave equation is satisﬁed.

(a) Find the angular frequency, phase velocity, wavenumber, wave vector, and wavelength.

Solution
(a) The angular frequency is ω = 2πν = 2π × 109 = 6.24 × 109 rad/s.
The phase velocity is

The wavenumber is
k =

vp
=

1.5 × 108
= 41.9 rad/m.
(2.10)
The wave vector has magnitude k and is in the direction of wave propagation, i.e. k =
41.89z rad/m.
The wavelength is λ = 2π/k = vp/ν = 1.5 × 108/109 = 0.15 m.
(b) Taking the real part of the monochromatic plane wave, and noting that the wave is
travelling in the +z direction, has maximum E0 = 10−3 V m−1 and is polarised in the x
direction,
E(r, t) = 10−3 cos

41.89z −6.238 × 109t + δ
] x
V m−1.
(2.11)
To ﬁnd the phase constant δ we use the information that E is maximum when t = 5 ns
and z = 1 m, and this occurs when the phase is 2nπ (n is any integer), so
41.89 × 1 −6.238 × 109 × 5 × 10−9 + δ = 2nπ
(2.12)
giving δ = (2nπ −10.70) rad. The ﬁelds are unaﬀected by our choice of integer n. So, for
convenience, setting n = 0 we ﬁnd
E(r, t) = 10−3 cos

Because the time-averaged value of cos2(ωt) is 1/2, we have
⟨S⟩= 2.65 × 10−9 z W/m2.
(2.20)
(e) We need to ﬁnd where Ex is maximum at t = 0. This occurs where the phase is 2nπ
with n being an integer, i.e. Ex is maximum where
2nπ = 41.89 × z −(6.238 × 109) × 0 −10.70.

Include a suitable diagram in your answer.
Solution
In transmission/reﬂection of light at an interface between two dielectrics, the incident ray,
transmitted ray and reﬂected ray are in the plane of incidence, which is deﬁned as the plane
containing the incident ray and the normal to the interface. If the plane in which the elec-
tric ﬁeld oscillates is perpendicular to the plane of incidence, the wave has perpendicular
(σ, s) polarisation, and if the the plane in which the electric ﬁeld oscillates is parallel to
the plane of incidence, the wave has parallel (π, p) polarisation.

Electromagnetic waves in empty space and linear dielectrics
2–5 Deﬁne what is meant by the amplitude reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients, and by the
reﬂectance and transmittance.
Solution
The amplitude reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients relate the complex amplitudes of
the electric ﬁelds of the reﬂected and transmitted waves to the complex amplitude of the
electric ﬁeld of the incident wave. For example for perpendicular polarisation,
E⊥
r = r⊥E⊥
i ,
E⊥
t = t⊥E⊥
i .
Reﬂectance is deﬁned by the ratio of the the energy ﬂux reﬂected by unit area of the
interface to the energy ﬂux incident on unit area of the interface.
Transmittance is deﬁned by the ratio of the the energy ﬂux transmitted through unit area
of the interface to the energy ﬂux incident on unit area of the interface.

Solution
(a) Brewster’s angle is the angle of incidence such that r∥(θB) = 0, so that
(nt/ni)2 cos θB =
√
(nt/ni)2 −sin2 θB,
(2.38)
(nt/ni)4 cos2 θB = (nt/ni)2 −(1 −cos2 θB),
(2.39)
cos2 θB
[
(nt/ni)4 −1

= (nt/ni)2 −1,
(2.40)
cos2 θB
[
(nt/ni)2 −1
] [
(nt/ni)2 + 1
]
= (nt/ni)2 −1,
(2.41)
cos2 θB
[
(nt/ni)2 + 1
]
= 1,
(2.42)
∴
cos θB =
1
√
1 + (nt/ni)2 .
(2.43)
The alternative formula we get from Eq. 2.42 above, from which
cos2 θB (nt/ni)2 = 1 −cos2 θB,
(2.44)
cos2 θB (nt/ni)2 = sin2 θB,
(2.45)
∴
tan θB = nt

.
(2.46)
(b) Eq. 2.46 can be derived from Snell’s law and requiring the angle between the reﬂected
and transmitted rays to be π/2. For this case θt = (π/2 −θi), and so from Snell’s law we
ﬁnd
ni sin θi = nt sin θt,
(2.47)
ni sin θB = nt sin
(π
2 −θB
)
,
(2.48)
ni sin θB = nt cos θB,

∴

2–7 Give a formula with explanations for the reﬂectance and transmittance in terms of the
magnitude of the Poynting vectors of the various waves, and their angles with respect to
the normal to the interface.
How is the reﬂectance related to the amplitude reﬂection
coeﬃcient? How is the transmittance related to the reﬂectance? Why?
Solution
In terms of the Poynting vectors of the three waves,
R = Sr cos θr
Si cos θi
,
T = St cos θt
Si cos θi
.
Note that the area of the interface as seen by each of the three waves is the projected area,
and the hence the relevant cos θ factor is needed.
The reﬂectance is related to the amplitude reﬂection coeﬃcient by R = |r|2.
The transmittance is related to the reﬂectance by R + T = 1 as required by energy conser-
vation.

3–1 The resistivity of silver is ρ = 1.6 × 10−8 Ωm, and its permeability is µ = 0.9998µ0, ﬁnd
the reﬂectance for light of wavelength 500 nm at normal incidence from air.
Solution
For perpendicular and parallel polarisations the amplitude reﬂection coeﬃcients for normal
incidence are
r⊥(0◦) = 1 −nt/ni
1 + nt/ni
,
r∥(0◦) = nt/ni −1
nt/ni + 1,
(3.1)
and we see that |r⊥(0◦)| = |r∥(0◦)|. Hence, we can use either amplitude reﬂection coeﬃ-
cient in calculating the reﬂectance, as we must be able to do since parallel and perpendicular
polarisations are undeﬁned for θi = 0◦. Then, for external reﬂection from air we have
r⊥(0◦) = 1 −n(ω)
1 + n(ω) = 1 −Re{n} −i Im{n}
1 + Re{n} + i Im{n}.
(3.2)
Using the rule that the complex conjugate of a quotient of two complex numbers is the
quotient of the complex conjugates of the two complex numbers, the reﬂectance is
R(0◦) = |r(0◦)|2 = (1 −Re{n})2 + (Im{n})2
(1 + Re{n})2 + (Im{n})2 .
(3.3)
From the wave number of a good conductor
k(ω) ≈(1 + i)2−1/2(µσω)1/2
(3.4)
we are able to estimate the refractive index,
n(ω) ≈(1 + i)c
√µσ

(3.5)
A wavelength of 500 nm corresponds to an angular frequency of ω = 2π × 3 × 108/500 × 10−9 =
3.77 × 1015 rad s−1. We see that for silver
Re{n} ≈Im{n} = 3 × 108
√
0.9998 × (4π × 10−7) × (1/1.6 × 10−8)

Hence, using Eq. 3.3 the reﬂectance is

The conductivity of a dilute plasma is purely imaginary,

Consequently, the
time-averaged power will be zero, as shown below

midnight the TEC is 1.66 × 1017 electrons m−2.
(e) Using the result for a given dispersion measure, which is deﬁned in a similar way to the

= 2.46 × 10−26 × TEC.

Hence, the pulse is spread out in time by 3.13 × 10−8 s (noon) or 4.09 × 10−9 s (midnight).

Solution
The ﬁrst step is to determine the rotation measure for this pulsar using the data given in
the plot. Even though we expect a ν−2 dependence of position angle, the range of frequency
is suﬃciently small that we can make a linear ﬁt (shown below).

3–5 We are receiving radio signals from an interplanetary space probe which is far from the
Sun. It is currently on a trajectory such that it has been eclipsed by the Sun, but it is now
emerging from behind the Sun. The space probe regularly broadcasts instantaneous broad-
band pulses of radio-frequency emission every second, and it also broadcasts spacecraft
experiment instrument data over a narrow frequency band of width 100 kHz extending from
10,000.0 MHz to 10,000.1 MHz. It transmits using a dipole antenna aligned perpendicular
to the plane of the ecliptic (the plane containing the Earth’s orbit). We are just renewing
radio contact as the space probe is emerging from behind the solar limb.
The Sun’s corona is an extremely hot (> 106 K) plasma which is highly variable, and
has dynamic coronal loops of magnetised plasma. The corona is located above the Sun’s
photosphere. At the time we are observing, the base of the corona in front of the space probe
as it emerges from behind the Sun has an electron number density of ne(R⊙) ∼3×1015 m−3.
The corona’s a scale height is about H ∼108 m, such that the electron number density
decreases with height as ne(r) = ne(R⊙) exp[−(r −R⊙)/H]. Imagine that, at the time we
are observing, the Sun’s magnetic dipole moment is m = 2 × 1029 A m2 and it happens to
be pointing directly towards Earth.
(a) What is the minimum radio frequency that we are able to receive from the space probe?
(b) What is the additional delay of the pulses due to propagation through the corona?
(c) By how much has the plane of polarisation of the EM wave carrying the data signal
rotated due to propagation through the corona?
[Make what you think are reasonable approximations – do not attempt a rigorous calcula-
tion. The radius of the solar photosphere is R⊙= 6.955 × 108 m.]

⊙= 3.9 × 108 m.
(3.25)
Hence, the dispersion measure is DM ∼2 L ne(R⊙) ∼2.3 × 1024 m−2.
Using the standard result for the time delay for a given dispersion measure, we have the
arrival time of the pulse at diﬀerent frequencies
t(ν)
=
e2
8π2ε0mec × DM × ν−2
=
(1.34 × 10−7) × DM ν−2
(3.26)
Over the bandwidth of the detector the delays are
t(10, 000.0 MHz) = (1.34×10−7)×(2.3×1024)×(1.0000×1010)−2 = 3.0820×10−3 s,
t(10, 000.1 MHz) = (1.34×10−7)×(2.3×1024)×(1.0001×1010)−2 = 3.0814×10−3 s.
Hence, the start of the observed pulse is delayed by ∼3 ms and the duration of the pulse
is ∼600 µs.
(c) To ﬁnd the angle of rotation of the plane of polarisation, we need to estimate the parallel
component of magnetic ﬁeld by, say, the surface magnetic ﬁeld at the magnetic equator
r = (R⊙, 90◦, ϕ), where the pole of these spherical coordinates corresponds to the magnetic
axis of the Sun. Then, we can obtain the surface ﬁeld from the magnetic dipole moment

3.6 × 107 rad m−2.
(3.31)
The rotation measure is deﬁned through
RM
=
∆PA
∆λ2 .
(3.32)
Hence, the plane of polarisation will have rotated by
PA(10, 000.0 MHz) = (3.6 × 107) ×
(3 × 108)
1010
)2
= 32351.522 rad,
(3.33)
PA(10, 000.1 MHz) = (3.6 × 107) ×
(
3 × 108)
1.0001 × 1010
)2
= 32345.053 rad.
(3.34)
So the plane of polarisation will have rotated by an enormous angle of the order of 30,000
radians, and we see that over the 100 kHz receiver bandwidth the position angle changes
by ∼5 radians.
These numbers are of course only order of magnitude estimates, but
they show that trying to align the a dipole antenna with the plane of polarisation makes
no sense, and that to obtain all the signal it would be necessary to have two orthogonal
polarisations and appropriately combine the two signals.

4–1 A standard waveguide for the “X-band” (8.2–12.4 GHz) has internal cross section 2.286 cm
by 1.143 cm. Find the the ﬁrst two cut-oﬀfrequencies, as these will give the frequency
range for which only the TE10 mode will propagate.
Solution
Since a = 2b, these will correspond to ω10 = cπ/a and ω01 = ω20 = 2cπ/a = 2ω10. To get
the frequency in Hz,
ν10 = c/(2a)

4–3 Consider a hollow standard WR-159 F-band waveguide which has an internal cross section
of 40.386 mm × 20.193 mm.
(a) A 2 GHz signal is fed into the waveguide. Will this cause a wave to propagate along
the waveguide?
(b) Assuming the wave would be in the TE10 mode, what is the wavenumber? Discuss the
implications of your answer.
Solution
(a) The lowest cutoﬀfrequency is for the TE10 with ω10 = cπ/a = 2.33 × 1010 Hz, hence
ν10 = c/2a = 3.71 GHz. 2 GHz is below the cut-oﬀfrequency for the TE10 mode, and so
the wave will decay exponentially with distance.
(b) The wavenumber is obtained from the dispersion relation with ω = 2π × 2 rad s−1

(4.15)
Because this is purely imaginary the wave will not propagate, and the electromagnetic ﬁeld
will decay exponentially as e−Im{k}z if the wave was launched in the +z direction. The
ﬁeld attenuation length is 1/Im{k} = 15.3 mm.

(a) Derive all the components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld for the case where k is purely
imaginary.
(b) Obtain the Poynting vector and discuss the energy ﬂow.

Radiation and scattering
5–1 A walkie-talkie has a short centre-fed dipole antenna 12 cm long and radiates 3 W at
450 MHz.
(a) What is the radiation resistance of the antenna? Assume the antenna has been balanced
by a suitable inductor such that its impedance is purely resistive, and that the transmission
line from the transceiver is matched to the impedance of the antenna.
(b) What is the value of the peak current in the antenna?
(c) What is the peak electric ﬁeld at the location of a receiving antenna at distance r?
(d) With the transmitting walkie-talkie held vertically, an identical receiving walkie-talkie
also held vertically at a distance of 2 km away can barely receive the transmission, i.e.
the range is 2 km. What would be the range if: (i) the transmitting antenna were tilted
at 60◦towards the receiving antenna, (ii) the transmitting antenna was vertical but the
receiving antenna was tilted at 60◦towards the transmitting antenna, (iii) the transmitting
antenna was vertical but the receiving antenna was tilted at 60◦to the vertical in a plane
perpendicular to the line of sight to the transmitting walkie-talkie?
Solution
(a) The wavelength is λ = 3 × 108/4.5 × 108 = 0.667 m, giving d/λ = 0.18 and so we
shall use formulae relevant to a short (d ≪λ) centre-fed dipole antenna. The radiation
resistance of this short centre-fed dipole antenna is then approximately
Rrad = 197
(d
λ
)2
= 197 × 0.182 = 6.38 Ω.
(5.1)

to obtain the peak current I0 as follows

∴

(i) For the transmitting antenna tilted by 60◦towards the receiving antenna we have
θ = 60◦in Eq. 5.7, and θ is pointing vertically down (parallel to the receiving dipole
antenna). Hence, at the detection threshold we must have

∴
r = 1.73 km.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Because the dipole radiation pattern is proportional to sin2 θ where θ is the angle to the
acceleration direction, the radiation will be zero in the direction of acceleration, i.e. in the

The time-averaged Poynting vector for the EM wave is

5–5 In bremsstrahlung an energetic electron is accelerated in the electric ﬁeld of an atomic
nucleus and emits electromagnetic radiation. Consider the case of an electron of kinetic
energy 10 keV travelling on a trajectory parallel to the z-axis, and that there is a lead
(Pb) nucleus located at impact parameter b = 10−10 m (distance of closest approach to
the initial trajectory). Assume that for this impact parameter the electron’s deﬂection is
small, and that a calculation of the energy lost to electromagnetic radiation can be done
classically.
(a) By comparing b with the de Broglie wavelength h/mv, reassure yourself that a classical
calculation is valid for this impact parameter and velocity.
(b) By checking whether or not the deﬂection angle is small, reassure yourself that approx-
imating the trajectory by a straight-line is valid.
(c) Estimate the total energy radiated by the electron. [Neglect atomic electrons.]
Solution
(a) From the kinetic energy, EK = (1/2)mv2, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the electron’s velocity, and then
the de Broglie wavelength

wavelength, and so use of classical physics is (marginally) justiﬁed.

5–6 A pulsar is a rapidly-spinning magnetised neutron star observed at radio and sometimes
higher (optical, X-ray and gamma-ray) frequencies. Neutron stars have masses of typically
M ∼1.4 M⊙(solar mass 1 M⊙≈2 × 1030 kg), radius R ≈10 km, moment of inertia
IMoI = 2
5MR2 ≈1038 kg m2 and a wide range of surface magnetic ﬁelds. Outside the
neutron star the magnetic ﬁeld may be approximated by that of a magnetic dipole at its
centre making angle α to the spin axis. Pulsars typically emit one or more narrow pulses
at the same time into each spin period P, and measurements at diﬀerent epochs generally
show that the spin is slowing down as characterised by the time-derivative of the period ˙P.
(a) Derive formulae in terms of P and ˙P for the rotational kinetic energy Erot, the rate
of loss of rotational kinetic energy ˙Erot, the pulsar’s characteristic age τ = Erot/ ˙Erot and,
assuming the slow-down is due to conversion of rotational kinetic energy to magnetic dipole
radiation, the pulsar’s minimum equatorial surface magnetic ﬁeld Bmin.
(b) The radio pulsar PSR J0157+6212 has P = 2.355 s and ˙P = 1.89 × 10−13 (“The
Australia Telescope National Facility Pulsar Catalogue”, Manchester, R.N., et al., 2005,

For the pulsar, we have a rotating magnetic dipole of eﬀective moment m0 sin α, where α is
the angle between the pulsar’s magnetic moment and its spin axis as it is only the moment’s
component perpendicular to the spin axis which is relevant for radiation. Furthermore, a
rotating magnetic dipole moment is equivalent to two orthogonal oscillating magnetic dipole
moments out of phase by 90◦.
We need to write the magnetic moment in terms of the surface magnetic ﬁeld, and for a
magnetic dipole of moment m0
B(r) = µ0
