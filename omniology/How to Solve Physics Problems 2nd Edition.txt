PREFACE
The purpose of this book is to help you to develop a highly effective set of problem-
solving skills that will allow you to excel in your physics class. Here are some of the 
elements of this book that we believe will make it highly valuable:
1.	 This book is more than just a collection of problems. It introduces theory along the 
way but places the theory immediately in the context of problems. This approach 
teaches you how to apply concepts to solving problems. 
2.	 We take the time to explain the solutions to the problems thoroughly. We point out 
important problem-solving strategies that are useful for solving large groups of similar 
problems.
3.	 This book has gone through extensive development over the years to present the 
problem-solving techniques in the clearest manner. The book was started in 1980 by 
Robert Oman and presented to his physics students to help them understand concepts 
and give them practice and confidence in working problems. After publication of the 
first edition in 1997, the book was used over a period of 10 years by many students in 
more of Robert’s university physics classes as a supplement to the text. Daniel Oman 
tutored university students from 2011 to 2015 and integrated new types of questions 
that he was seeing into the existing book, creating a second edition.
The second edition of this book includes three new chapters—Quantum Physics; 
Atoms, Molecules, and Solids; and Nuclear Physics. This edition also includes some 
edits and additional problems based on feedback from students over the years.
It is the sincere desire of the authors that this book help you to better understand 
physics concepts and work the associated problems. We thank the many students who 
have contributed to this work by using the material and offering suggestions. Also, we 
thank the fine staff at McGraw-Hill Education that has contributed greatly to the clarity 
of the presentation.

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
1
This book will teach you how to do physics problems. The explanation of not only how 
to do a problem but also why we do it a certain way teaches you not just a collection of 
solved problems, but a collection of methods that can be used, modified, and built upon to 
do other physics problems. As researchers and teachers, we know that the key to solving 
new and challenging problems is contained within the collection of techniques already 
learned for solving simpler problems. Seeing a problem solved and knowing why it was 
done in a certain manner is the best way to learn how to solve related, more difficult 
problems.
This book is not a presentation of every problem you are going to encounter on a test. It is 
a presentation of the methods that we have found to work for large groups of problems. If 
you develop the techniques we describe for solving problems then you will know how to 
successfully approach the problems you will encounter on the tests. This is the book you 
should have as a reference when you are doing your homework problems. It will show 
you how to work the problems and explain why they are being done the way they are.
The topics in this book are in the order of most physics texts. Each chapter begins with 
a theoretical discussion. Problems are mixed in with the discussion as soon as possible. 
These problems follow the development of the theory. In this way you do not have to 
assimilate a large amount of conceptual material before beginning to work problems.
A “standard” route is followed for problems wherever possible. In this way you will learn 
that broad categories of problems worked in a standard “logical” way always produce 
correct solutions. Our emphasis is on logic and order in solving problems. We avoid 
methods that may be quick and have limited application to problem solving in favor 
of possibly longer solutions that have broad applications and always work. We believe 
that a lot of good physics can be taught in problems so we use problems to illustrate and 
expand a topic and sometimes introduce new concepts. For this reason problems and text 
are integrated with a minimum of artificial barriers between them.
The book is intended as a complement to either the calculus-based or the non-calculus-
based elementary physics course. It has been our experience that calculus concepts can 
be introduced into the traditional non-calculus course and used in the development of 
concepts. Conceptually, calculus is not difficult, and when it is introduced in the context 
of a physics problem it is even easier. We use calculus concepts to explain theory, but 
calculus is rarely used in problems. Even those students who are taking calculus concur­
rent with their physics course usually learn calculus concepts in physics before they see 
them in their calculus course.
C   In those instances where calculus is needed, the problems and paragraphs are 
marked with a calculus icon. Even the student without formal calculus training should 
read these sections. They are often explained in a simple manner so that the calculus does 
not present a problem.

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
The chapters on electricity and magnetism are also excellent background chapters for 
someone taking an undergraduate course in electricity and magnetism.
We have used two significant figures for the physical constants and most of the numbers 
in the problems. Results are given to two, and occasionally three, significant figures. 
Using two significant figures cuts down on the clutter in the problems, allowing the 
technique to receive greater exposure. Do not be concerned in working through the 
problems if your answers do not agree exactly with ours. This is no doubt due to when, 
or if, intermediate calculations were rounded off. SI units are used nearly universally 
throughout the book.

HOW TO EXCEL IN YOUR 
PHYSICS COURSE 
Most students realize that putting off studying until the day before the exam and then 
cramming at the last minute is not efficient. Some students do this anyway, because so 
far they have gotten away with it. Perhaps most of the other students you previously 
competed with had poor study skills. This may have allowed you to adopt poor or non-
existent study habits and still keep up, or even get good grades if you are naturally a better 
student. Now that you are in college, the courses will be more difficult, and it is to your 
advantage to develop a more organized approach to handling your course work.
Successful people generally have three things in common. They make effective use of 
their time, they set goals for themselves, and they have a positive attitude. Physics is a 
challenging course for most students. It will take a well-organized consistent effort to do 
well in this course, but success in a challenging area is a worthwhile goal.
General Approach for Studying Physics
Many people believe the following: more work and more study results in higher 
grades. This is not necessarily so. You certainly must be willing to make a certain 
commitment of time and energy to this course, but the key to academic success 
is concentrating your efforts on the right things at the right times. You may have 
noticed that those students who receive the highest grades are not necessarily the 
ones who work the greatest number of hours. Some students may boast that they have 
studied all night for an exam, but don’t be impressed by this habit. “Allnighters” and 
the like are almost always the result of procrastination and bad study habits. Getting 
no sleep before an exam is foolish, and it usually takes several days to recover from 
this kind of activity. By taking advantage of the study techniques that follow you can 
achieve higher grades with less effort.
The most efficient way of learning physics by attending lectures, problem solving sessions, 
and performing supplementary readings is to:
1.	 Do a quick reading on the topics to be covered in the lecture before attending class. 
Ten or fifteen minutes may be sufficient for a one hour lecture. The purpose here is 
to generally familiarize yourself with the topics to be discussed. Perhaps you can 
identify one or two questions or key points to listen for during the lecture.
2.	 Attend class and take notes. Attend all of the classes. Someone is paying for these 
classes so BE THERE! Be on the alert for any indication by the instructor of possible 
test questions. If the professor says something like “This is very important, you may 
be seeing this again,” make a special note of this in your notebook.
3.	 Review your lecture notes. Don’t save this step until a few days before the exam. It 
is far more efficient to review your notes a little bit at a time during the semester than 
to try and do it all at once. At this point you should also do a more detailed reading 
of the text to fill in any gaps in your class notes.
4.	 This may be the most important step. Do the homework problems regularly. In other 
courses it may be sufficient to read the text and review your notes, but in physics you 

4	
How to Excel in Your Physics Course
must be able to work the problems. You don’t learn problem solving skills by just 
reading examples of solved problems, you must do the problems yourself. By doing 
the homework problems on a regular basis you will be able to identify areas that you 
need more work on well in advance of the test. Physics problems can be difficult. 
Therefore, when you set out to work problems do not set yourself the task of working 
a certain number of problems, but rather set out a certain amount of time to work on 
problems.
5.	 Compile a formal set of notes and prepare a detailed outline. The general strategy 
here is that a number of short exposures to manageable pieces of the course is 
more efficient than one long exposure to a large amount of material. As you 
progress through the course, you first get your information in an initial reading 
of the material, then again in the lecture, then again in a second reading, and yet 
again in an organizing session where you prepare a detailed outline. The detailed 
outline is essential to success on the exams. It contains the examination questions. 
Your main preparation for the exam will be to extract the questions and prepare 
to answer them. Notice we did not say “study for the exam”; the studying for 
the exam has been going on all along. That is what you have been doing as you 
make up your formal notes, outline, etc. What you have done with this systematic 
approach is to reproduce the notes and outline that the instructor is using. If you 
are reasonably good at it, you will have as good a source of exam questions as the 
instructor.
How to Prepare for a Physics Test
Examine the shelves of any bookstore catering to career oriented students and you will 
find books with titles such as: How to Pass the Real Estate Licensing Exam, or How to 
Succeed on the S.A.T. Examining these books will help you develop your personal exam-
taking program. One common thread in all books on how to pass particular exams is to 
know the types of questions in advance. Most writers of these types of books are in the 
business of training people in their particular areas, so they are close to the people who 
make up the exams. This gives them a ready source of test question possibilities, and 
knowing the types of questions is half way to knowing the answers. Therefore we make 
the following suggestions:
1.	 Almost all instructors in physics will include some problems on the test that are very 
similar to examples that they have done in class. Many times you may encounter the 
same problem with different numbers. This makes it very important to attend every 
class so as not to miss the opportunity to see possible test questions. If you do miss 
class, always get the notes from a friend.
2.	 Another frequent occurrence is for slight modifications of homework problems to 
appear on the test. Join a study group that does homework problems together. This 
can be more efficient than grinding away on your own. Don’t waste too much time 
with a study group unless it is productive. Your final preparations for a test should be 
done privately so that you can concentrate on developing a plan for taking the test.
3.	 Try to find physics tests given by your instructor in the pas few years. It is a good bet 
that most of the questions for the exams in the near future will be very much like those 
of the immediate past.
4.	 Some physics problems involve mathematics that can be deceptively easy. For exam­
ple, if you expect problems involving the manipulation of logarithms or exponents 
be sure you practice the mathematical operations and entering the numbers into your 
calculator so you don’t have to stop and figure out how to take exponents during the 
test. Practice any unfamiliar mathematical operations before the test.

Timing and the Use of the Subconscious
Have you ever experienced the frustration of having a conversation with someone and 
forgetting momentarily a name or fact that is very familiar to you? Usually, shortly after 
such an experience, the name or fact will come to you when you are not consciously 
trying to recall it. Another variation of this same phenomenon is when a person doesn’t 
feel right about making a decision immediately upon receiving or defining a problem. 
They like to “sleep on it.” Both of these situations have a common characteristic—the 
use of the subconscious. The fact that solutions are often presented to us in the absence of 
active work on the problem at the moment we receive the solution indicates that another 
part of the brain was analyzing the pertinent information and providing a solution. We 
call this part of the brain the subconscious; it is very effective at solving problems.
Here are some tips for effectively using the subconscious:
1.	 Your subconscious will not work without information. You must consciously sort out 
all of the facts or information for a particular problem. If you are having difficulty 
with a problem, try to get straight in your mind what you do know about the problem. 
Then also define in your mind what specifically you don’t know or don’t understand 
about the problem.
2.	 Put conscious effort into the problem up to the point of confusion. Many people grind 
and grind on a problem after this point and accomplish very little. It is more efficient 
for you to plan your study time so that you do not put yourself in a situation where 
your only choice is to grind on a problem.
3.	 After you have done all you can consciously on the problem, put it in the back of your 
mind. Don’t keep worrying about it. It is important that you clear your mind so that 
you can accept the solution when it comes.
4.	 Be sure you have a deadline for the solution.
5.	 When a solution comes, be sure to act on it quickly, so you can go on to something 
else. Sometimes instead of a solution to the problem you will receive a request 
for more information. The problem may still be unanswered, but will be clearer 
to you. What could be happening here is that your subconscious has analyzed the 
problem and found an essential piece of information missing and is asking you 
for it.
The study program that we have outlined, consisting of regular review of lecture notes, 
frequent working of homework problems, and periodic updates of your formal notes and 
outline, makes maximum use of your subconscious. The periodic intake of new mate­
rial and the required conscious review serves to keep you subconsciously analyzing and 
fitting new information into the body of knowledge you are accumulating.
Here would be a good approach to practicing for a physics exam:
ED - 4:  (Exam day minus four) Prepare a sample exam from your outline. This may 
consist of questions from previous exams given by the instructor and varia­
tions of homework problems or examples done in class. Keep in mind that 
this is probably the same way that the professor is making up your exam.
ED - 3:  Study for your first sample exam. Go over your notes, text, and homework 
problems.
ED - 2:  Take your first sample exam. As soon as possible after the exam, do a detailed 
review concentrating on the weaker areas. Make up your final sample exam.

6	
How to Excel in Your Physics Course
ED - 1:  Take your final sample exam. Again review the difficult points of this sample 
exam. Get a good night’s sleep tonight.
ED:     Do as little as possible on the day of the exam. You may want to quickly 
review your outline or a couple of difficult points.
You will notice that the bulk of the work in preparing for a test this way consists of 
writing and taking sample tests. It is planned that way. One of the common fallacies in 
preparing for exams is to prepare for the wrong thing. Many students will prepare for a 
physics exam by reading the text or by reading solutions to problems. A physics exam, 
however, is not a reading exam but a writing and problem-solving exam. If you have not 
practiced writing solutions to typical problems, you have not prepared as well as you 
might for the exam.
The second advantage to taking sample tests is that it increases your speed in writing 
solutions to types of problems that are likely to be on the test. This will allow you more 
time during the test to spend on unexpected or more troublesome problems.
Strategies to Use During a Physics Test
You are now entering the test room. You are well prepared to take the test. You have 
taken practice tests and know what to expect on the exam. You have gotten a good night’s 
sleep the night before and eaten a healthy breakfast that will provide you with the energy 
needed for good concentration. You have a positive attitude. At this point worrying about 
how you will do on the exam is useless. Study time is over. You now need to concentrate 
on the strategies that will get you the highest possible score on the test. Here are some 
suggestions:
  1.	It is usually a good idea to take a minute or two at the beginning of the exam to look 
over all the questions. Look for the type of questions that you expected and have 
practiced and do these first. Save the hardest questions for last. It can be very frus­
trating to run out of time working on question # 4 only to realize that you didn’t even 
get a chance to start question #5 that was much easier.
  2.	Have a rough idea of how much time you should be spending on each question. 
Sometimes certain questions will count for more points than others and the instructor 
should provide that information on the test.
  3.	If you are required to memorize a lot of formulas you may want to take the time at 
the beginning of the test to write down a few of the more complicated ones next to 
problems that involve those formulas as you are glancing over the test. Later during 
the test, your mind may be cluttered with formulas and it may be harder to correctly 
recall one of the more complicated ones.
  4.	Always include the units of your answer (miles per hour if the answer is a velocity, 
for example). Don’t make the mistake of not including units. This is very important 
to almost all physics teachers.
  5.	Write your work clearly when you are solving a problem. It is easier for the professor 
to give you partial credit if he or she can clearly see that your approach to solving the 
problem was correct and just made a minor computational error.
  6.	Think about your answer to a problem. Does the answer make sense? For example, 
if you are solving for the length of one side of a right triangle and you are given the 
hypotenuse, your answer better not be a length greater than the hypotenuse. It is 
very important to be able to think like this on a test. This will help you catch a lot of 
mistakes like missing a minus sign.

  7.	Unfortunately some instructors give tests that are much too long for a given period 
of time. It seems as if they are more interested in measuring how fast you can do 
physics than how well you can do physics. Try to find out in advance of the test if 
your professor’s tests are like this. If the cutoff for an A is usually 75% instead of 
90% then you need to be aware of this. This may prevent you from panicking as you 
run out of time on the test. Remember that you may be able to work for partial credit 
on that last answer. On these kinds of tests it is very important to keep your cool and 
try to get as many points as you possibly can. Stay positive all the way through and 
give it your best shot!
  8.	Make sure you know the difference between radian mode and degree mode on your 
calculator when taking a test that includes trigonometry (see the Mathematical Back­
ground section).
  9.	Avoid prolonged contact with other students immediately before the exam. Many 
times the nervous tension, frustration, defeatism, and perhaps wrong information 
expressed by fellow students can be harmful to your performance.
10.	 Multiple choice tests: Find out if there is any penalty for a wrong answer. If not, don’t 
leave any question unanswered. Find out if there is any partial credit for showing 
your work on a separate sheet of paper. One thing to think about for multiple choice 
tests is how the professor is generating the choices other than the correct answer. 
Here are some typical wrong choices on a multiple choice physics test:
(a)  A formula requires the input of length in meters. In the problem the length is 
specified in centimeters. The wrong answer is off by a factor of 100.
(b)  A formula requires the input of a radius. Diameter is given in the problem. The 
wrong answer is off by a factor of two.
(c)  A question asks for a velocity. Choice A is 10 lb. This is the correct number, but 
the wrong units. Choice D is 10 miles per hour, the correct answer. The lesson 
here is to look carefully at all the choices.
Your Self Image as a Student
To a large extent, many people perform at the level of their own self image. One thing to 
get straight in your mind at the beginning of the course is that you are capable of master­
ing the material in your physics course. Some students get stuck in the mode of saying 
something like, “I have always been a C student.” There is a simple logical argument 
that will show you that C students in physics or mathematics or any subject where skill 
is built from course to course are not getting C’s because of their understanding of the 
material, but because that is how they view themselves, consciously or unconsciously. 
In a series of three to five sequential mathematics courses, for example, it is virtually 
impossible to go from one course to the next, let alone a sequence of several, without 
eventually mastering the material in each previous course. Think back to your first math 
course where you were taught how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. At some point 
in that course you may have thought that you couldn’t understand certain concepts. By 
now you have mastered those skills. College physics is the same way. You are mentally 
capable of understanding and even mastering basic physics. Now it is true that different 
people learn at different speeds. You may need to spend a little extra time on physics or, 
more likely, make more effective use of your time.
At this point you need to set a goal for yourself in your physics course. The first question 
is how important is physics in your academic program. If you are a biology major and 
you are taking physics only because it is a general requirement, then your primary goals 
should be to get the best grades in your biology courses, since that is your major. If one 

8	
How to Excel in Your Physics Course
of your goals is to have a high G.P.A., then you should strive for an A or at least a B. If 
your major is physics or engineering then you should definitely go for an A in this course. 
Write down your goals and check them off as they are accomplished. Your goals for the 
first part of a physics course may look something like this:
Main Goal: An A in Physics I
Week 1:  Establish a schedule for reading text, reviewing notes, and doing home­
work problems.
Week 2:  Investigate the possibility of joining a study group.
Week 3:  Find out if past exams from this professor are available; find out how many 
points it will take to make an A on the first test.
Week 4:  Prepare and take sample exams for the first test.
The purpose of writing down your goals is not to create more work, but to keep you 
focused on the most important things that you need to accomplish as the semester pro­
gresses. Please remember that all of the study techniques outlined in this chapter are 
designed to make achieving higher grades easier for you. The sooner you become more 
organized and focused on your goals, the sooner you will begin to realize that you are 
capable of impressive accomplishments with a reasonable amount of effort.
Perhaps physics is a favorite area of study that you may wish to pursue in the future or 
perhaps you are primarily interested in the most efficient way to make it through this 
course. Whatever you choose for your major area of study, find something you enjoy and 
pursue excellence. Give it your best today, and better tomorrow. We wish you success.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide you with a review of and reference for the math­
ematical techniques you will need in working the physics problems in this book. Some 
topics may be familiar to you while others may not. Depending on the mathematical level 
of your physics course, some topics may not be of interest to you. Each topic is covered 
in sufficient depth to allow you to perform the mathematical manipulations necessary 
for a particular problem without getting bogged down in lengthy derivations. It is not 
our intention to teach mathematics, but to show you how to apply specific mathematical 
procedures to physics problems. 
The most efficient use of this chapter is for you to do a brief review of the chapter, spend­
ing time on those sections that are unfamiliar to you and that you know you will need in 
your course, then refer to specific topics as they are encountered in the solution to prob­
lems. With this reference you should be able to perform all the mathematical operations 
necessary to complete the problems in your physics course. If you need or desire more 
depth in a particular topic go to an algebra or calculus text.
Solving Equations
The simplest equations to solve are the linear equations of the form 
0

as solution

 You should be very familiar with these.
The next most complicated equations are the quadratics. The simplest quadratic is the 
type that can be solved by taking square roots directly, without any other manipulations.
An example is 4

x =

to produce

x = ±  Both plus and minus values are legitimate solutions. The reality of 
the physical problem producing the equation may dictate that one of the solutions be 
discarded.

MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
The physics problems you are doing should not produce square roots of negative numbers. 
If your solution to a quadratic produces any square roots of negative numbers, you are 
probably doing something wrong in the problem.
Certain cubic equations such as x3 = 8 can be solved directly producing the single answer 
x = 2. Cubic equations with quadratic (x2) and linear (x) terms can be solved by factor­
ing (if possible) or approximated using graphical techniques. You most likely will not 
encounter cubic equations in your early physics courses.
Another category of equations you will encounter is simultaneous equations: two inde­
pendent equations in two unknowns and later three equations in three unknowns. We’ll 
start with two equations in two unknowns. Take two equations

The most direct way of solving these equations is by substitution, solving one equation 
for one unknown and substituting in the other equation. Looking at these two equations 
the easiest variable to solve for is x in the second equation

These answers can be checked by substituting into both the original equations.
Another method, often involving less manipulation, is addition and subtraction where 
the equations are multiplied in such a way that upon addition or subtraction one of the 
variables adds away leaving one equation in one unknown. Start with the equations used 
previously and write equation (1) and –2 times equation (2), and add

This is the same value obtained above and by substitution in either original equation will

The use of determinants in solving simultaneous equations is discussed in the next section.

MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND

Determinants
A determinant is a square array of numbers. Determinants are very convenient for solv­
ing two equations in two unknowns and three equations in three unknowns. The deter­
minant technique for solving equations, called Cramer’s Rule, can be derived from the 
addition and subtraction method of solving simultaneous equations. Use as an example 
the equations of the previous section.

The numeric equivalent of the determinant is found by multiplying 2 times -4 and sub­
tracting the multiplication of 3 times 1. The numeric equivalence of a 2 by 2 determinant 
is this first diagonal multiplication minus the second diagonal multiplication. With a little 
practice this goes very quickly.
Now form the x associated determinant by replacing the x coefficients with the constants.

If you need practice with determinants write down some sets of equations and solve them 
by substitution and determinants. After a few manipulations with determinants you will 
be able to solve simultaneous equations very quickly. Some calculators that solve systems 
of equations with Cramer’s rule ask you to enter the numbers in a determinant format.
Three by three determinants require a little more manipulation. Consider three equations 
with the master determinant

MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
There are several ways to find the values of this determinant. We’ll look at one simple 
method called expanding the determinant, using the first row and the associated deter­
minants obtained by crossing off the rows and columns associated with each number in 
the top row. This is easier to show than explain.

Look at the top row of (the 3 by 3) D and write each term times the determinant obtained 
by blocking off the row and column associated with that term. Also, alternate the signs 
of the three 2 by 2 determinants so the second number, 1, is changed to -1. The 2 by 
2 determinants are evaluated as before.

As an exercise find the z associated determinant and calculate z. The value of z = 3 can 
be verified from any of the original equations. 
With a little practice determinants can be a very quick way of solving multiple equations 
in multiple unknowns.
Determinants as applied to vector products are discussed in the chapter on vectors.

Binomial Expansions
Squaring (a + b) is done so often that most would immediately write a2 + 2ab + b2.
Cubing (a + b) is not so familiar but easily accomplished by multiplying (a2 + 2ab + b2) 
by (a + b) to obtain a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3.
There is a simple procedure for finding the nth power of (a + b). Envision a string of 
(a + b)’s multiplied together, (a +b)n. Notice that the first term has coefficient 1 with 
a raised to the nth power, and the last term has coefficient 1 with b raised to the nth 
power. The terms in between contain a to progressively decreasing powers, n, n -1, 
n – 2, … , and b to progressively increasing powers. The coefficients can be obtained 
from an array of numbers or more conveniently from the binomial expansion or 
binomial theorem

The factorial notation may be new to you. The definitions are
0! = 1, 1! = 1, 2! = 2 · 1, 3! = 3 · 2 · 1, etc.
As an exercise use the binomial expansion formula to verify (a + b)3.
The real utility of the binomial expansion in physics problems is in finding approxima­
tions to expressions where a is equal to 1 and b is less than 1. For this case the expansion 
looks like

The terms of the series decrease depending on the value of b. Two or three terms is usu­
ally a good approximation. Also the “next” term in the expansion is a good measure of 
the error in using a fixed number of terms of the binomial expansion.
The classic use of this expansion is in special relativity where the expression (1

In special relativity v/c is always less than one so this approximation, whether used alge­
braically or with numbers, is very convenient.
Coordinate Systems
The standard two dimensional coordinate system works well for most physics 
problems. In working problems in two dimensions do not hesitate to arrange the coor­
dinate system for your convenience in doing a problem. If a motion is constrained to 
move up an incline, it may be more convenient to place one axis in the direction of 
the motion rather than in the traditional horizontal direction. If a projectile is dropped 
from an airplane, it may be more convenient to place the origin of the coordinate 

14	
MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
system at the place where the projectile was dropped and have the positive directions 
down, since the projectile and possibly the distances in the problem are given in refer­
ence to the airplane.
Fig. I-1
Positions in the standard right angle coordinate system are given with two numbers. In 
a polar coordinate system positions are given by a number and an angle. In the accom­
panying diagram it is clear that any point (x, y) can also be specified by (r, q). Rather 
than moving distances in mutually perpendicular directions, the r and q locate points by 
moving a distance r from the origin along what would be the +x direction, then rotating 
through an angle q. The relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates is also 
shown in Fig. I-1. 
Three dimensional coordinate systems are usually right handed. In Fig. I-2 imagine 
your right hand positioned with fingers extended in the +x direction closing naturally so 
that your fingers rotate into the direction of the +y axis while your thumb points in the 
direction of the +z axis. It is this rotation of x into y to produce z with the right hand that 
specifies a right handed coordinate system. Points in the three dimensional system are 
specified with three numbers (x, y, z).
Fig. I-2
For certain types of problems, locating a point in space is more convenient with a cylin­
drical coordinate system. Construct a cylinder with the central axis on the z-axis of a 
right handed coordinate system.
A point is located by specifying a radius measured out from the origin in the +x direction, 
an angle in the x-y plane measured from the x-axis, and a height above the x-y plane. Thus 
the coordinates in the cylindrical system are (r, q, z). The relation of these coordinates to 
x, y, z is given in Fig. I-3.

MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND 	
15
Fig. I-3
Spherical coordinates are also convenient in some problems. As the name suggests, 
points are located on a sphere centered on the origin of an (x, y, z) system. The radius of 
the sphere is the distance from the origin (to the sphere). The angle between this radius 
and the z-axis is one angle, and the angle between the x-axis and the projection of r on 
the x-y plane is the other angle. Thus, the coordinates in the spherical system are (r, q, f). 
The relation of these coordinates to x, y, z is given in Fig. I-4.
Fig. I-4
Trigonometry
The trigonometric relations can be defined in terms of right angle trigonometry or through 
their functions. The basic trigonometric relations, as they relate to right triangles, are 
shown in the box.

16	
MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
Graphs of the trigonometric relations are shown in Fig. I-5.
Fig. I-5
Angles are measured in radians. Radian measure is a pure number, the ratio of arc length 
to radius to produce the desired angle. Figure I-6 shows the relationship of arc length to 
radius to define the angle.
Fig. I-6
The s = rq is the basic relation in rotational motion.
The relation between radians and degrees is 2p rad = 360°.
The sine of small angles can be approximated with the radian measurement of angles. 
Figure I-7 shows the sine of a very small angle and the radian measure of the angle. Take 
the two sides of the triangle as equal to r. For small angles this is nearly an isosceles 
triangle. The sine of the angle is
Fig. I-7
For small angles s is approximately h and the sine of the angle is nearly equal to the angle 
(measured in radians). Take a small angle, p/30, which is equal to 6° and as an exercise 
find the sin 6° and p/30 and verify that the error in using the radian rather than the sine 
is 2 parts in 1000 or 0.2%.
A large number of trigonometric identities can be derived using geometry and algebra. 
Several of the more common are in the box below.

Functions
It is helpful in visualizing problems to know what certain functions look like. The linear 
algebraic function (see Fig. I-8 ) is y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the straight line 
and b is the intercept, the point where the line crosses the x-axis.
Fig. I-8
The next most complicated function is the quadratic (see Fig. I-9), and the simplest qua­
dratic is y = x2, a curve of increasing slope symmetric about the y-axis. Quadratics are also 
called parabolas. Adding a constant a in front of the x2 either sharpens (a > 1) or flattens 
(a < 1) the graph. Adding a constant to obtain y = ax2 + c serves to move the curve up or 
down the y-axis. Adding a linear term, producing the most complicated quadratic, moves 
the curve up and down and sideways. If a quadratic is factorable then the places where it 
crosses the x-axis are obtained directly in factorable form. This discussion of parabolas 
is continued in the chapter on projectile motion.
Fig. I-9

18	
MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
With a little experience you should be able to look at a function y = x2 + 2x - 8 (see 
Fig. I-9) and say that the x2 means it is a parabola, the coefficient of 1 means it has stan­
dard shape, and the other two terms mean that it is moved up and down and sideways. 
Factor to y = (x + 4)(x - 2) , and the curve crosses the x-axis at x = 2 and x = -4. Because 
it is a parabola the curve is symmetric about x = -1.
Cubic curves have the general shape shown in Fig. I-10. Adding a constant term moves 
the curve up or down the y-axis. A negative in front of the x3 term produces a mirror 
image about the x-axis. Quadratic and linear terms in a cubic produce peaks and troughs 
in the curve.

Logarithms and Exponents
Logarithms and exponents are used to describe several physical phenomena. The expo­
nential function y = ax is a unique one with the general shape shown in Fig. I-11.
Fig. I-11
This exponential equation y = ax cannot be solved for x using normal algebraic techniques. 
The solution to y = ax is one of the definitions of the logarithmic function: x = loga y.
The language of exponents and logarithms is much the same. In exponential functions 
we say “a is the base raised to the power x.” In logarithm functions we say “x is the loga­
rithm to the base a of y.” The laws for the manipulation of exponents and logarithms are 
similar. The manipulative rules for exponents and logarithms are summarized in the box.
The term “log” is usually used to mean logarithms to the base 10, while “ln” is used to mean 
logarithms to the base e. The terms “natural” (for base e ) and “common” (for base 10) are 
frequently used.

Derivatives
There are numerous definitions of the derivative, but the one that fits most physics prob­
lems best is that the derivative of a function is another function that gives the slope of 
the original function at any point. Consider a function f(x), often written as y = f(x), over 
an interval Dx. The notation y = f(x) is mathematical symbolism that says “a variable y is 
going to be described by certain operations on another variable x.”
Using the D notation the general expression for slope is

This equation says that the slope of a function is the value of the function at a point x + Δx 
minus the value of the function at x all divided by Δx. This assumes the function is linear 
between x and x + Δx; an approximation that gets better as Δx gets smaller. The slope 
defined this way is an average slope between x and x + Δx. The derivative is the 
general expression for the slope at any point, thus, it is a function that gives the slope of 
another function at every point. The derivative, df/dx or f ′ is the limiting case of the 
slope where Δx → 0:

The slope of the curve y = x2 - 5 is 2x. Just pick a value of x, and the slope is two times 
this value.
As an exercise verify that the derivative of y = x3 is 3x2.
The derivative of power law functions is very easy with the procedure described 
above. After performing a few of these, we can come to the conclusion that for any 
power law y = cvn, the general expression for the slope (derivative) is y′ = cnvn-1. 
Listed below are the derivatives for power laws as well as some trigonometric, expo­
nential, and logarithmic functions. All of these can be derived using the procedures 
employed above.

Integrals
Integrals can be viewed two ways, as the area under a curve or as the inverse operation 
to the derivative. Look upon the derivative as an operation performed on a function. 
If y = 3x2 + 2x - 1 is the function, then the derivative is d by dx of y or

The inverse of this operation is called integration. The actual operation of integration is

MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND

As an exercise approximate the area under the curve. The area between x = 3 and x = 4 can 
be approximated with a rectangle and triangle. Find the value of y at x = 3 and the area of 
the rectangle. Find the value of y at x = 4 and find the approximate area of the triangle. 
These two areas are very close to the area found from the integral.
The integrals of these three curves are what is known as definite integrals, ones that have 
specific limits. As such they do not need constants. The indefinite integrals, those with­
out limits, need the constant. Listed below are the integrals of some common functions.

Average Value of a Function
In Fig. I-18 the shaded area is the value of the integral. This area could be represented 
by a rectangle with one side of the rectangle equal to 1, the length of the integral, from 
3 to 4, and the other side, the average height of the function between 3 and 4. This aver­
age height is the average value of the function over the interval from 3 to 4. From the 
geometry then we can say that the average value of the function times the length of the 
integral equals the area or value of the integral. Rearranging then, the average value of a 
function over a particular range is the value of the integral over the range divided by the 
range. Applying this to the function y = x2 – 5 the average value of the function between 
3 and 4 is

CHAPTER 1	
VECTORS
25
This chapter serves a dual purpose. First, it will help you to do the addition and subtraction 
of vectors in the chapter in your text on vectors and the vector problems in the chapters 
on motion and forces. Second, it will serve as a reference for those topics involving vector 
products, especially the definitions of work and torque encountered in mechanics. 
Certain physical quantities, such as mass or temperature, are described with a number 
called a scalar. Other quantities, such as displacement, velocity, or force, have a direc­
tion associated with them and are called vectors. Operationally, a vector is an arrow 
oriented in space with the length (of the arrow) representing the number and the orienta­
tion, the direction. Vectors can be placed anywhere on a coordinate system so long as they 
maintain their required length and orientation.
Number Plus Angle and Components
A vector can be described with a number and an angle as A = 23∠37°. In performing the 
basic mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, it is 
more convenient to write vectors in component form. If A were placed with the tail 
(of the vector) at the origin of a coordinate system, then the x and y components could 
be written as shown in Fig. 1-1.
Fig. 1-1
It is very important in the use of vectors to be able to go from the number plus angle for­
mat to component format quickly and accurately. Before going any further in this chapter, 
review the basic trigonometric relations and the formulas for going from number plus 
angle to components and vice versa (Fig. 1-2). And if you are at all unsure of yourself, 
make up a 3 × 5 card with figure and formulas and review it several times a day until you 
can perform the operations without hesitation.
A vector A = A ∠q has components as shown in Fig. 1-2. (The bold type represents the 
vector, and the normal type represents the number associated with that vector.) If the 
components, ax and ay, are given, then the number plus angle form can be obtained with 
the trigonometric relations on the left side of Fig. 1-2.

The components are cx = 47 cos 193° = -45.8 and cy = 47 sin 193° = -10.6.
Fig. 1-3
Taking the sine or cosine of the 193° angle will produce the appropriate negative num­
bers, but drawing a figure and using the principal angle is a better procedure. Fewer 
mistakes are made from figures than from the readout of calculators. When the vector 
and its components are drawn on the coordinate system, there can be no mistake that 45.8 
and 10.6 are both negative.
Unit Vectors in Two Dimensions
The use of unit vectors simplifies the mathematical operations on vectors. In two dimensions, 
unit vectors are vectors of unit value directed in the +x and +y directions.
Fig. 1-4
The vector A (Fig. 1-1) would be written as A = 18.4i + 13.8j, and vector C (Problem 1-1) 
would be written as C = –45.8i – 10.6j.

The key to getting vector addition problems correct is to use multiple diagrams. Most 
mistakes in vector problems are sign mistakes. And the way to avoid sign mistakes is to 
use diagrams extensively.

Solution: Place the force vectors with components on the same diagram (Fig. 1-8).
Fig. 1-8
The components of the resultant can be diagrammed directly. If the diagrams are done 
in this manner, it is not necessary to use large angles and misread calculator readouts. 
Note that component forces in the y direction are both positive, while F1x and F2x are 
in opposite directions. Taking forces acting in the +x and +y directions as positive and 
forces acting in the –x and –y directions as negative, the result of the addition of these 
two forces is 86 in the +x direction and 971 in the +y direction. Using the diagram, it is 
not necessary to keep track of the plus and minus signs. The diagram makes clear how 
the components should be added to produce the correct resultant. The resultant written 
in magnitude and angle form is F = 975N ∠85°.
Fig. 1-9

Vectors	
29
There are two different types of products of vectors. One results in a scalar, and the other 
results in a vector. The next two sections discuss these products. Depending on the order 
of topics in your course, you may want to put off reading these sections until they come 
up in mechanics.
Scalar or Dot Product
The dot product (A · B) produces a scalar. There are two definitions of the dot product. 
The most easily visualized is
	
A · B = AB cosq	
(1-1)
where q is the angle between A and B. This definition can be viewed as the projection of 
A on B or the component of A in the direction of B times the magnitude of B.

CHAPTER 1
More dot product problems will be done in the chapters where dot products are used in 
the calculation of work. Work, as defined in mechanics, is the product of the component 
of an applied force in the direction of a displacement and that displacement: W = F · s.
Vector or Cross Product
The cross product (A × B) produces a vector. As with the dot product, there are two 
definitions of the cross product. The simplest definition to understand is that the cross 
product of A and B produces a vector of magnitude AB sin f in a direction normal 
(perpendicular) to the plane of A and B with f the angle between A and B. The specific 
direction is obtained by rotating A into B (crossing A into B or A cross B) again using the 
fingers of the right hand naturally curling (closing) from A to B with the thumb pointing 
in the direction of the new (product) vector. This is the same procedure as for finding the 
z direction in an x-y-z right handed coordinate system. A right handed coordinate system 
with the three unit vectors is shown in Fig. 1-12. 
Practice visualizing i × j to produce k and j × k to produce i. The angle between the unit 
vectors is 90°, and their magnitude is 1; so the resultant vector has magnitude 1 and is in 
the direction given by this “vector crossed into another vector” procedure. Practice point­
ing your fingers in the direction of the first vector, curling them into the second vector 
with your thumb pointing in the direction of the result of this “cross” product until you 
can quickly see that i × k = –j and k × i = + j.
Fig. 1-12
The definition of torque in mechanics is lever arm times force times the sine of the angle 
between them. Another way of saying this is that torque is lever arm times the component 
of the force at right angles to the lever arm. In mathematical terms,
ττ =
×
r
F  
Fig. 1-13
with the magnitude of the torque given by T = rF sin q and the direction of the vector 
given by the r × F rule. The F sin q term can be viewed as the component of F perpen­
dicular to r.

Vectors	
31
In Fig. 1-13, the vectors are arranged as the sides of a parallelogram with F sin q the 
height of the parallelogram. The product rF sin q is the magnitude of r × F and is also 
the area of the parallelogram (a base times the height) formed by r and F.
The second definition of the cross product is mathematically easier but harder to relate 
to physical problems. This definition is expressed as a determinant.

The numeric difference, 440 versus 437, is due to rounding the components to three 
significant figures.
In simple problems it is easier to find the cross product from the geometric definition. 
In more complicated problems, or where it is difficult to be sure of the direction of the 
vector product, the determinant form is more convenient.

CHAPTER 2	
KINEMATICS IN ONE 
DIMENSION
33
The motion of a particle (ballistic missiles, golf balls, and gas molecules are all examples of 
particles) is described by giving position, velocity, and acceleration, usually as a function 
of time. For convenience in getting started, we confine the discussion to one dimension. 
We also need to differentiate between distance and displacement and speed and velocity.
If a dog fetching a stick runs in a straight line (the +x direction) 30 m to pick up the 
stick and returns (the -x direction) 26 m, then the total distance traveled is 56 m, but the 
displacement is + 4 m. Distance generally means total distance traveled, while displace­
ment is the actual difference between end point and beginning.
If the dog were to execute the fetching in 8 s, then the speed of the dog would be the 
total distance traveled divided by the time, or 7 m/s, while the velocity, defined as the 
displacement divided by the time, would be 0.5 m/s.
In a word equation form, this is

The “Δ” notation is read as “a change in” or “a small change in.”
Let’s look at some simple relationships between position and velocity. Remember, 
we are confined to one dimension. The simplest relation is x = constant. As shown in 
Fig. 2-1, the particle doesn’t move. There is no velocity or acceleration because x does 
not change with time. 
The first complication is x = t (Fig. 2-2). The particle moves equal increments in x in 
equal increments of time. That is, the change in x from t = 1 to t = 2 is the same (same 
change) as when t goes from t = 2 to t = 3. The velocity then is a constant. And by defini­
tion the acceleration is zero.

CHAPTER 2
The next complication is x = t2. This graph is shown in Fig. 2-3. In this quadratic relation­
ship, the simple definition of velocity begins to break down. Between t = 0 and t = 1 the 
velocity is (1 - 0)/(1 - 0) = 1. Between t = 1 and t = 2 the velocity is (4 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 3 and 
on and on with the velocity changing depending on the time interval chosen. Clearly, the 
acceleration is not a constant. This velocity calculation fits our present definition and is 
equivalent to drawing a straight line between points on the smooth curve of x versus t.
       
          Fig. 2-3                              Fig. 2-4
Calculating velocity this way presents a problem because, depending on the interval, we 
will get different answers for the velocity. To find the velocity at t = 1, we found x at t = 1 
and x at t = 2 and performed the velocity calculation. This is not a good approximation to 
the velocity at t = 1 because the average is between t = 1 and t = 2. A better approximation 
would be to take values of x between t = 1 and t = 1.1. Even better would be to take values 
between t = 0.99 and t = 1.01. And for even better approximations, just shorten the time 
interval centered about t =1. As the interval gets smaller, we will get a better and better 
measure of velocity. In Fig. 2-4 the slope of the straight line from x = 1 to x = 4 represents 
the average velocity between x = 1 and x = 4. The slope of the straight line tangent to the 
curve at x = 1 represents the velocity at x = 1.
Instantaneous Velocity and Acceleration
A more versatile definition of velocity is Δx/Δt, where the interval Δt is very small and 
centered about the time where the velocity is desired. This approach leads to a general 
method for obtaining an expression for velocity that can be evaluated at any point rather 
than going through the numeric calculation whenever we want a velocity. 
C   In words, this definition is stated as the instantaneous velocity, which is the value 
of Δx/Δt as Δt approaches zero. In equation form, this is written as
	
lim
0
v
x
t
dx
dt
t
=
∆
∆=

This definition of the derivative as the limit of Δx/Δt as Δt approaches zero is the slope of the 
tangent to the curve evaluated at the point in question. Thus, if we want to find the velocity 
of any particle traveling according to a polynomial relation between x and t, all we need is a 
general technique for finding the slope of the tangent to the polynomial at any point.

The instantaneous acceleration is the slope of the tangent to the curve of v versus t.
C   The general expression for the slope of any polynomial is discussed in the Math­
ematical Background. For a polynomial of the form x = ctn, the expression for the slope at 
any point is cntn-1. Stating this in calculus terms, for any function x = ctn, the derivative of 
the function is cntn-1. This can be verified in the case of the parabola by taking successively 
smaller intervals of Δt and Δx at any point t to verify that the slope at any point is 2t.
Kinematic Equations of Motion
The kinematic equations of motion are derived under the assumption of constant 
acceleration. While this may seem at first to be a restriction, there are a large number of 
problems where the acceleration is a constant. The simplest and most obvious are falling 
body problems, that is, problems involving bodies falling on (or near) the surface of the 
earth where the acceleration due to gravity is a constant. Falling body problems are taken 
up in Chapter 3. In the derivation of the kinematic equations of motion, a good image to 
keep in mind is that of falling bodies.
Starting with the assumption of constant acceleration, we can write

The first three equations relate displacement, velocity, and acceleration in terms of time, 
while the fourth equation does not contain the time.
Now let’s apply these four equations to some typical problems. Remember that the kine­
matic equations of motion allow us to describe the position, velocity, and acceleration 
of a mass point. 
2-1  A train starts from rest (at position zero) and moves with constant acceleration. On 
first observation, the velocity is 20 m/s, and 80 s later the velocity is 60 m/s. At 80 s, 
calculate the position, average velocity, and constant acceleration over the interval.
Solution: Diagram the problem.

If the acceleration is constant, then the average velocity is the average of 20 m/s and 
60 m/s, or 40 m/s, and at an average velocity of 40 m/s and 80 s, the distance traveled is 
3,200 m.

2-5  Two vehicles are at position x = 0 at t = 0. Vehicle 1 is moving at constant velocity 
of 30 m/s. Vehicle 2, starting from rest, has acceleration of 10 m/s2. A typical question 
of this situation is, “Where do they pass?”
Solution: First, diagram the situation.
Fig. 2-6
The question, “Where do they pass?” translated into algebra means, “What is the 
value of x when they pass?” This can be determined by writing equations for the posi­
tion of each vehicle and equating xl = v1ot = (30 m/s)t and x2 = (1/2) a2t2 = (5 m/s2)t2. 
Setting xl = x2 gives the time when they pass as 30t = 5t2 or 5t(t - 6) = 0, so the 
vehicles pass at t = 0 and t = 6. Putting t = 6 s in either equation for x (xl or x2) gives 
180 m as the distance.

38	
CHAPTER 2
2-6  For the situation in Problem 2-5, when do the vehicles have the same velocity?
Solution: In algebra, this means to set the equations for velocity equal (v1 = v2) and 
solve for the time. Remember that three of the four equations of motion are functions 
of time, so most questions are answered by first calculating the time for a certain con­
dition to occur.

Now that we know when, we can calculate where they have the same velocity. Use either

2-7  For the situation of Problem 2-5, what are the position, velocity, and acceleration of 
each vehicle when vehicle 2 has traveled twice the distance of vehicle 1?
Solution: The time when this occurs is when x2 = 2x1 : 5t2 = 60t or 5t(t - 12) = 0. This 
gives times of t = 0 and t = 12. The time t = 0 is correct, though uninteresting. The time 
t = 12 is the physically interesting answer. At t = 12,

2-8  Two trains are traveling along a straight track, one behind the other. The first train 
is traveling at 12 m/s. The second train, approaching from the rear, is traveling at 20 m/s. 
When the second train is 200 m behind the first, the operator applies the brakes, producing 
a constant deceleration of 0.20 m/s2. Will the trains collide, and if so, where and when?
Solution: First, diagram the situation. Our strategy will be to write down the equations for 
each train using Equations (2-1) through (2-6) and the information provided in the problem. 
Fig. 2-7

Kinematics in One Dimension 	
39
Take t = 0 when the brakes are applied and the first train is 200 m ahead of the second. This 
makes the position of the first train 200 m at t = 0 (x1o in Equation 2-2).
The question as to whether the trains collide means, “Is there a real (time) solution to the 
equation resulting from setting x1 = x2?”
	
200 m + (12 m/s)t = (20 m/s)t - (0.10 m/s2)t2	
If there are no real solutions to this equation, then the trains do not collide. Drop the units, 
and write 0.10t2 – 8t + 200 = 0, which is solved by the quadratic formula:

Since there are no real solutions to this equation, there are no times when the trains 
collide.
2-9  Change Problem 2-8 by giving the second train an initial velocity of 25 m/s. This 
will give a real time for the collision. Find the collision time. 
Solution: The situation is now as shown in Fig. 2-8. Again, setting the expressions for 
x1 and x2 equal and dropping the units produces 200 + 12t = 25t - 0.10t2 or 0.10t2 - 13t + 
200 = 0 with solutions

The two times correspond to when x1 = x2. The earliest time is the first coincidence and

CHAPTER 2
The equation for x1 = 200 + 12t is a straight line of slope 12 starting at 200. The equa­
tion for x2 = 25t - 0.10t2 is a parabola that opens down. Figure 2-9 (not to scale) shows 
the two curves. While the “mathematics” produces two times, the reality of the prob­
lem dictates the earlier time as the one for the “collision.”

FALLING-BODY PROBLEMS
41
The kinematic equations of motion for constant acceleration, Equation (2-1) and 
Equations (2-3) through (2-6), can be applied to a large collection of problems known as 
falling-body problems, problems where the constant acceleration is the acceleration due 
to gravity on the surface of the Earth. These equations from Chapter 2 are rewritten here

3-1  Consider a ball dropped from the top of a 40 m tall building. Calculate everything 
possible. 
Solution: “Calculate everything possible” is an unusual request. Usually, early in your 
study of falling-body problems, there is a problem that asks for something that does not 
at all seem like it has anything to do with the information given. It’s almost like asking, 
“What color is the building?” When this happens, and it probably will, the way to do 
the problem is to calculate what you can, and let the information you generate lead you 
through the problem. Let’s apply this approach to this problem. First, diagram the prob­
lem as shown in Fig. 3-1. Place the origin at the top of the building, with displacement, 
velocity, and acceleration (g) all positive down.
Fig. 3-1
Since most of the kinematic equations contain the time, this is usually one of the first 
things to calculate. Use Equation (3-4) to find the time for the ball to strike the ground

NOTE:  This last equation is a better one to use because it relies on original data rather 
than calculated data. If there had been an error in the time calculation, it would have been 
repeated in the v = vo + gt equation. Also, round off errors are eliminated by using equa­
tions that rely on original data.
3-2  Now add a complication to Problem 3-1 by throwing the ball down with an initial 
velocity of 8.0 m/s. Find the time for the ball to reach the ground and the velocity on impact.
Solution: Again, diagram the problem as in Fig. 3-2. Note that in this problem the 
displacement and velocity are positive down.
Fig. 3-2
The time of flight is from 40 m = (8.0 m/s)t + (1/2)(9.8 m/s2)t2, which rearranged and 
without units is 4.9t2 + 8.0t – 40 = 0, with solution by formula:

3-3  Add a different complication to Problem 3-1. Throw the ball up from the top of the 
building with a velocity of 8.0 m/s. Find the time for the ball to reach the ground and 
the velocity on impact.
Solution: Diagram the problem as in Fig. 3-3. Take x the displacement as positive down 
and the velocity as negative up. It is important to remember that the sign of the velocity 
is opposite that of the displacement. It doesn’t matter whether the velocity is negative and 
the distance down positive or vice versa. It does matter that the signs be opposite! Getting 
a sign wrong is the source of many, possibly most, errors in falling-body problems.

Notice that whether the v term is a positive or negative number, the result is the same. If 
the ball is thrown up with a certain velocity or down with the same velocity, the velocity 
at impact is the same. This is to be expected from the symmetry of the equations. If the 
ball is thrown up with a certain velocity, then on the way down it passes the same level 
(from which it was thrown) with (numerically) that same velocity.
3-4  For the situation of Problem 3-3, calculate the maximum height above the top of the 
building and the time for the ball to reach maximum height.
Solution: The time for the ball to reach maximum height is from Equation (3-2). Note 
that at maximum height, the velocity must be zero. Again, watch the signs closely. It 
doesn’t matter how you choose the signs, but the acceleration has to be opposite the 
velocity. The equations

yield the same result, t = 0.82 s. Because of symmetry, it takes the ball the same amount

3-5  A bottle of champagne is dropped by a balloonist. The balloon is rising at a constant 
velocity of 3.0 m/s. It takes 8.0 s for the bottle of champagne to reach the ground. Find 
the height of the balloon when the bottle was dropped, the height of the balloon when 
the bottle reached the ground, and the velocity with which the bottle strikes the ground. 
Solution: Diagram the situation as shown in Fig. 3-4, being especially careful about the 
relative orientation (algebraic signs) of displacement, velocity, and acceleration. There 
are several possibilities as regards the origin and direction of the coordinate system. 
Take the origin at the height of the balloon when the bottle is dropped; the position of the 
balloon at t = 0. Take the displacement as positive down. The main reason for taking the 
displacement as positive down is that the acceleration is down and the initial velocity is 
up, making two positives and one negative. As time goes on, however, displacement, 
velocity, and acceleration will be positive. This choice seems to make for fewer minus 
signs and less chance for error with an algebraic sign.

3-7  A coconut is dropped from a height of 60 m. One second later, a second coconut is 
thrown down with an initial velocity. Both coconuts reach the ground at the same time. 
What was the initial velocity of the second coconut?
Solution: In problems where there is a time delay, it is usually best to calculate the 
position, velocity, and acceleration of the first particle at the time when the second 
particle starts to move. In the train problem in Chapter 2 there was a position differ­
ence between the two trains at t = 0 that was easily translated into the equations. It is 
possible to do time delay problems with a time differential in one set of equations. The 
difficulty with this approach is that it is easy to get an algebraic sign wrong. If you say 
that the time for the second particle is the time for the first plus the difference between 
them, then it is essential that the algebraic sign of the difference be correct. It is much 
easier, especially when you are learning how to do problems with a time delay, to do 
them in this slower but inherently more accurate way. First, calculate the state of the 
first particle when the second one begins moving. Then write the two sets of equations 
describing the motion with this instant as t = 0.
Calculate the position and velocity of the first coconut at the end of 1 s, the time when 
the second one starts.

Since everything (position, velocity, and acceleration) is positive down, orient the coor­

Fig. 3-6. At the instant the second coconut is thrown down, the first coconut has position 
4.9 m, velocity 9.8 m/s, and acceleration 9.8 m/s2.

The time for the second coconut to reach the ground is the same as the time for the first

This comes from v = vo + at, where vo is v1o, the velocity of the first coconut when the 
second one is thrown down, and v is the velocity of the first coconut at the ground.

3-11  A ball is observed to pass a 1.4 m tall window going up and later going down. The 
total observation time is 0.40 s (0. 20 s going up and 0.20 s going down). How high does 
the ball rise above the window?
Solution: Diagram the problem as in Fig. 3-9. This is another example of a question that 
seems totally unrelated to the information in the problem. When you don’t know where 
to start and you do not see a clear path to the desired answer, simply start where you can, 
calculating what you can and hopefully learning enough to answer the specific question.

CHAPTER 4	
PROJECTILE MOTION
51
In order to understand projectile motion, you have to look at the motion in two direc­
tions with one direction oriented in the direction of constant acceleration and the other 
direction at a right angle to it so as to form an x-y coordinate system. In most problems 
where an initial velocity and angle with the horizontal is given, the velocity is written in 
component form (Fig. 4-1).
Fig. 4-1
Note that the motion is effectively separated into horizontal and vertical components (one 
in the direction of the constant acceleration and one at a right angle to the acceleration).
The motion is a parabola in this coordinate system. The symmetry of parabolas (in this 
case, parabolic motion) is helpful in understanding the motion. (See the Mathematical 
Background for a discussion of the properties of parabolas.) In order to better understand 
how the motion is separated and how the parabolic property helps us to understand pro­
jectile problems, we will do a simple problem without numbers just to get a feel for the 
features of the motion. If you are familiar with the properties of parabolas, you may want 
to skip this discussion and go directly to the worked problems.
In Fig. 4-1, the velocity of the projectile is written in component form. The acceleration 
in the horizontal direction is zero and in the vertical direction is due to gravity. With the 
velocity components and the acceleration in the direction of an axis, we can write the six 
equations describing acceleration, velocity, and position in the x and y directions.
These equations are based on the kinematic equations of motion for constant acceleration: 
a = constant, v = vo + at, and s = so + vot + (1/2)at2.
The six equations are
	
ax = 0	
ay = -g
	
vx = vo cosq	
vy = vo sinq - gt
	
x = vo(cosq)t	
y = vo(sinq)t - (1/2)gt2
The equations for x and y can be considered parametric equations in time. Parametric 
equations such as x = f(t) and y = f(t) are equations that can be combined to produce 
y = f(x) or x = f(y). To find the position of the particle in x-y, or y as a function of x, solve

, which is a parabola that opens down and

The maximum range occurs for an angle of 45°, corresponding to sin 2q = 1.
The main point of this discussion is that the motion is a parabola, and the properties of 
parabolas can be used in solving problems in projectile motion. That the maximum range 
occurs at 45° is not surprising and is generally not of interest in problems. The expres­
sion for maximum range is only of passing interest because the range is one of the easier 
things to calculate in any problem.
Do not consume precious memory space memorizing formulas for the range or time of 
flight. If you work the problems by first writing down the six equations describing the 
motion, then the time of flight, range, and many other things are easily calculated.
In order to set up a problem in projectile motion, first orient one axis of a right angle 
(x-y) coordinate system in the direction of constant acceleration. Remember to place 
the origin of the coordinate system and the positive direction for x and y for (your) 
convenience in solving the problems. Then write equations for acceleration, velocity, 
and position for each direction. Along with the symmetry of the motion, these equa­
tions can be used to find the characteristics (position, velocity, and acceleration) of 
the projectile at any point in space or time. The procedure is illustrated with a simple 
problem.
4-1  A soccer player kicks a ball at an initial velocity of 18 m/s at an angle of 36° to the 
horizontal. Find the time of flight, range, maximum height, and velocity components at 
t = 0, midrange, and impact.

PROJECTILE MOTION	
53
Solution: The acceleration is down, so set up the coordinate system with x horizontal 
(along the ground) and y vertical, and place vo on the graph. Write the velocity in com­
ponent form, and calculate vxo and vyo (Fig. 4-2).
Fig. 4-2
Now, and this is the key to getting the problem right, write down the six equations 
governing the motion starting with the accelerations (the accelerations are the easiest to 
write).

Now look at the motion, which is parabolic in x-y, keeping in mind the properties of

The ball is on the ground at t = 0 and t = t, the time of flight. To find these times, set y = 0 
and obtain (without units)
	
10.6t - 4.9t2 = 0  or  t(10.6 - 4.9t) = 0	
which gives t = 0 and t = 10.6/4.9 = 2.16 s, the time of flight. The range is the value of 
x at 2.16 s.

at t = 1.08 s:	
vx = 14.6 m/s,	
vy = 0
	
at t = 2.16 s:	
vx = 14.6 m/s,	
vy = –10.6 m/s
The procedure for doing the problem is to write the initial velocity in component form; 
write the six equations for acceleration, velocity, and position; and then perform the 
mathematical operations answering questions about the problem.
4-2  For the situation of Problem 4-1, suppose that the field is covered with fog down to 
3.0 m above the ground. What are the times for the ball’s entry into and exit out of the 
fog?
Solution: The times for the ball’s entry into and exit out of the fog, are found from the 
equation for y as a function of time with y set equal to 3.0 m.
	
3.0 m = (10.6 m/s)t - (4.9 m/s2)t2	
This is a quadratic equation, and after removing the units, it reads 4.9t2 - 10.6t + 3.0 = 0 
and is solved with the quadratic formula:

4-3  An airplane traveling at 100 m/s drops a bomb from a height of l,500 m. Find the 
time of flight, distance traveled, and velocity components as the bomb strikes the ground.
Solution: Start by placing the origin of the coordinate system at the point where the bomb 
is released. Take the direction in which the bomb falls due to gravity as positive x and 
the horizontal position as y. This is different from the conventional orientation, but it is 
convenient in this problem because the six equations all come out positive!

With these six equations we can answer all the questions in the problem. We need only 
to “translate” the word questions into algebra questions.
a.	 The time for the bomb to reach the Earth means “Find the time when x = 1,500 m.” 
Thus
	
l,500 m = (4.9 m/s2)t2  yields  t = 17 s

4-4  A baseball is hit at a 45° angle and a height of 0.90 m. The ball travels a total distance 
of 120 m. What is the initial velocity of the ball? What is the height of the ball above a 
3.0 m fence 100 m from where the ball was hit?
Solution: This problem is unique in that it requests the initial velocity, a number usually 
given in the problem. Also note that the angle is 45°, the angle for maximum range. The 
other interesting feature of this problem is the question concerning the height at some 
specific point down range. 
Set up the problem in the conventional way assigning vo to the initial velocity.
Fig. 4-5
The next question is how to handle the ball being hit at 0.90 m above the ground. Since 
vo is specified at the point where the ball is hit, and this is where we start counting time, 
the origin for the coordinate system should be put here. We just need to keep in mind that 
this origin is 0.90 m above the ground level.

The first question reduces to finding vo for the 120 m hit. Algebraically, this means that 
when y = -0.9 m, x = 120 m, so write the two equations (for x and y) with these conditions:
	
120 m = vo cos45°t    -0.9 m = vo(sin45°)t - (4.9 m/s2)t2	
Note that vo (cos45°)t = vo (sin45°)t = 120 m, so write

The next part of the problem asks for the height above the fence at 100 m. Again, we 
need to find the time for x to be 100 m down range and substitute this value of t into the 
y equation.
	
100 m = (34.1 m/s) (cos45°)t  or 
t =

Remember that this is 15.6 m above the zero of the coordinate system, which is 0.90 m

The minimum vo is dictated by the condition that the rider be at x = 20 m and y = -3.0 m. 
So put these conditions into the equations for x and y.

This is the minimum velocity to make the jump.
As a follow on to this problem, calculate the velocity to just hit the end of the ramp. This 
velocity gives an upper limit to the jump velocity.
Go back through the problems and notice the common approach:
	
1.  Orient a coordinate system,
	
2.  Write the six equations of motion, and
	
3.  Translate the word questions into algebra.
In these problems we have not always used each of the six equations to answer the ques­
tion. Few problems require the detailed description of the motion available in the six 
equations. If, however, each problem is described by these six equations, you will always 
have all the information to answer any possible question about the motion.

CHAPTER 5	
FORCES (INCLUDING 
CENTRIPETAL FORCE)
59
In the development of mechanics, the first thing to learn is the interrelations of position, 
velocity, and acceleration (for constant acceleration). These interrelations are described 
with the four kinematic equations of motion and discussed in Chapters 2, 3 and 4.
In this chapter we relate constant force to constant acceleration and then to all of kine­
matics. Operationally, force can be defined as what makes masses accelerate. Actually, 
it is the unbalanced force on a mass that makes it accelerate. Simply, unbalanced forces 
make masses accelerate.
Force, acceleration, and mass are related by Newton’s second law as F = ma.
5-1  A 40 N force is applied to a 20 kg block resting on a horizontal frictionless table. 
Find the acceleration.
Solution: The acceleration is 
/
40N/20kg
2.0m/s .

Fig. 5-1
Once the acceleration is known, the kinematic equations of motion can be applied to find 
position, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time.
5-2  Now place the 20 kg mass (with no external force applied) on a frictionless 50° 
inclined plane. What is the acceleration of the mass?
Solution: The force acting on the mass is due to gravity, so set up a vector diagram (some 
authors call this a force diagram or free body diagram) starting with this 196 N force 
acting down. The mass is constrained to move down the plane, so the force we want is the 
component of this gravitational force acting down the plane. In Fig. 5-2 the gravitational 
force is shown with components down the plane Fp and normal to the plane Fn. Notice 
the geometry of the situation, where the 50° angle of the plane is the same as the angle 
between the gravitational force and the normal (force).
Fig. 5-2

CHAPTER 5
The 150 N force acting down the plane causes the 20 kg mass to accelerate at
	
a =
=
150N
20kg
7.5m/s2 	
5-3  Place a 10 kg mass on a frictionless 35° inclined plane, and attach a second 20 kg mass 
via a cord to hang vertically, as shown in Fig. 5-3. Calculate the acceleration of the system.
Solution:
Fig. 5-3
This problem introduces the concept of the tension in the connecting cord. The most con­
venient way to visualize this tension is that if the cord were cut and a force meter inserted, 
it would read a certain tension (force). This tension acts, as shown, on each mass. Notice 
the 35° angle of the plane and the 35° angle between the normal and the direction of mg.
We’ll do the problem first with the tension and later without the tension.
To write equations relating the unbalanced force to the acceleration, we need to make 
an assumption as to which way the masses move. Assume that the system (of masses) 
moves to the right, or clockwise.
Start by writing equations relating the unbalanced force on each mass. On m1, the unbal­
anced force is T - 56 N, and this force makes the 10 kg accelerate.
	
T - 56 N = 10 kg ⋅ a1	
Likewise on m2, the unbalanced force to make the mass accelerate is
	
196 N - T = 20 kg ⋅ a2	
The assumption that the system accelerates clockwise dictates the directions of the forces 
in these two equations. Look again at these equations, and notice that if we had assumed the 
acceleration were counterclockwise, then the signs would be different. In frictionless prob­
lems it is all right to have a negative acceleration. The negative sign means that you guessed 
wrong in assuming the acceleration direction. This is not true with friction problems.
Add the two equations, and take the accelerations as the same. The accelerations are the 
same because the masses are linked together with the cord.
	
140 N = 30 kg · a  or  a = 4.7 m/s2	

FORCES (INCLUDING CENTRIPETAL FORCE)	
61
Now the tension in the cord is easily calculated from the equation for m1:
	
T = 56 N + 10 kg · 4.7 m/s2 = 103 N	
Another way to view this problem is to say that the unbalanced force on m1 and m2 is 
(196 - 56) N = 140 N. This force makes the total mass of 30 kg accelerate, so
	
140 N = 30 kg · a  or  a = 4.7 m/s2	
This is a very quick way to find the acceleration of the system, but it is inconvenient to 
find the tension in the cord.
5-4  The next complication in force problems with inclined planes is a double inclined 
plane, as shown in Fig. 5-4.
Fig. 5-4
Solution: The vector diagram for these masses is shown in Fig. 5-5. Assume that the 
system moves clockwise.
Fig. 5-5
The equation for m1 is
	
T – 76 N = 12 kg · a	
The equation for m2 is
	
83 N - T = 20 kg · a	
Adding the two equations,
	
7.0 N = 32 kg · a  or  a = 0.22 m/s2	
The tension in the cord is
	
T = 76 N + 12 kg · 0.22 m/s2 = 79 N	

62	
CHAPTER 5
5-5  Another popular problem is the Atwood machine. A simple example is shown in 
Fig. 5-6. Find the acceleration of the system.
Solution: Assume that the system moves counterclockwise. The equation for m1 is
	
98 N - T = 10 kg · a	
The equation for m2 is
	
T - 147 N = 15 kg · a	
Add the equations:
	
-49 N = 25 kg · a  or  a = -2.0 m/s2	
Fig. 5-6
The system accelerates clockwise! The tension in the cord is from the equation for m1:
	
T = 98 N + (10 kg)2.0 m/s2 = 118 N	
Friction
A good first problem in friction is the arrangement shown in Fig. 5-7, where the problem 
is first done without friction and then with friction.
For the purposes of doing problems, there are two important properties of frictional 
forces:
• They oppose the motion, and
• They are less than or equal to a constant (the coefficient of friction) times the 
normal force, the force at the frictioning surface ( f ≤ lN).
5-6  Two masses are arranged with one, of 50 kg, on a frictionless table and the other, of 
30 kg, attached by a cord and hanging, over a frictionless pulley, off the edge of a table. 
Find the acceleration of the system.
Solution: Assume that the system moves clockwise. The equation for m1 is
	
T = 50 kg · a	
The equation for m2 is
	
294 N - T = 30 kg · a	

FORCES (INCLUDING CENTRIPETAL FORCE)	
63
Adding the two equations,
	
294 N = 80 kg · a  or  a = 3.7 m/s2	
Fig. 5-7
5-7  For the situation of Problem 5-6, add a coefficient of friction m = 0.20 between the 
block and table.
Solution: This makes the vector diagram look like Fig. 5-8. Notice that the only addition 
is the frictional retarding force mN = 98 N.
Fig. 5-8
The equation for m1 is
	
T – 98 N = 50 kg · a	
The equation for m2 is
	
294 N – T = 30 kg · a	
Add the equations to obtain
	
196 N = 80 kg · a  or  a = 2.4 m/s2	
5-8  For the situation of Problem 5-7, increase the coefficient of friction to 0.80. What is 
the acceleration of the system?

64	
CHAPTER 5
Solution: This makes the vector diagram look like Fig. 5-9.
Fig. 5-9
The equation for m1 is
	
T - 392 N = 50 kg · a	
The equation for m2 is
	
294 - T = 30 kg · a	
Adding the two equations,
	
–98 N = 80 kg · a  or  a = -1.2 m/s2	
Clearly, the system does not accelerate counterclockwise! This is an illustration of the 
second property of frictional forces: the frictional force is less than or equal to mN. In 
this case the frictional force just balances the tension in the cord. The frictional force, as 
calculated, can be up to 392 N. In order for m2 not to move, the tension in the cord must 
be 294 N. (If m2 is not moving, the forces must be in balance.) Therefore, the forces on 
m1 must be 294 N due to the tension in the cord and 294 N due to friction.
Another important point with frictional forces is the normal force, as illustrated by this 
next problem.
5-9  A 50 kg sled is pulled along a level surface at constant velocity by a constant force 
of 200 N at an angle of 30°. What is the coefficient of friction between the sled and the 
surface?
Solution: The first step in this problem is to find the components of the applied force and 
the mg of the sled. These are shown on the vector diagram in Fig 5-10. Notice that the 
normal force, the actual force between the sled and the friction surface, is mg minus the 
component of the applied force lifting up on the sled. Sometimes it is easy to miss this 
vertical component of the applied force. This is a major mistake in this type of problem. 
To help visualize this vertical component of force, try placing the origin for the vectors 
in the middle of the sled rather than at one end, where a rope would be attached.
Fig. 5-10

FORCES (INCLUDING CENTRIPETAL FORCE)	
65
The normal force is mg (= 490 N) minus the vertical component of the applied force, 
100 N, or 390 N. Since the sled is moving at constant velocity, the forces must be in 
equilibrium. The horizontal component of the applied force must equal the frictional 
retarding force, the coefficient of friction times the normal force:
	
µ · 390 N = 173 N  so  µ = 0.44	
5-10  A 65° inclined plane has a mass of 20 kg on the plane where the coefficient of fric­
tion is 0.40 and a mass of 50 kg hanging free. Calculate the acceleration of the system.
Solution: Set up the vector diagram assuming that the motion is counterclockwise. In the 
diagram in Fig. 5-11, the frictional force is calculated as a maximum of 33 N.
The equation for m2 is
	
490 N - T = 50 kg · a 	
The equation for m1 is
	
T - 178 N - 33 N = 20 kg · a	
Adding the equations,
	
279 N = 70 kg · a  or  a = 4.0 m/s2	
Fig. 5-11
In doing friction problems like this, you have to be careful with the frictional force. If 
the forces up and down the plane are nearly balanced, it is important to remember that 
the frictional force is not 33 N but that it can be up to 33 N. In a problem similar to this, 
it could easily happen that the blocks would not move.
5-11  Consider a double inclined plane with angles, masses, and coefficients of friction 
as shown in Fig. 5-12. Calculate the acceleration of the system.
Fig. 5-12

66	
CHAPTER 5
Solution: Assume that the system moves counterclockwise, and set up the vector dia­
gram as in Fig. 5-13.
The equation for m1 is
	
(30 - 15 -T) N = 6.0 kg · a	
The equation for m2 is
	
(T - 62 - 10) N = 9.0 kg · a	
Adding the equations,
	
-57 N = 15 kg · a	
Fig. 5-13
This is a negative acceleration. We cannot simply reverse the sign of a to find the correct 
answer because if the system were moving the other way, the frictional forces would 
have to be reversed. Further analysis requires us to consider another vector diagram 
assuming that the system moves in a clockwise direction.
The numbers have all been calculated, so the vector diagram can be written down easily 
and is as shown in Fig. 5-14.
Fig. 5-14
The new equations are:
	
(T – 30 – 15) N = 6.0 kg · a	
	
(62 – T – 10) N = 9.0 kg · a	
Adding the equations yields
	
7.0 N = 15 kg · a  or  a = 0.54 m/s2	

FORCES (INCLUDING CENTRIPETAL FORCE)	
67
The tension in the cord is from the first equation:
	
T = 45 N + 6.0 kg(0.54 m/s2) = 48 N	
If the acceleration of the system were negative for both the clockwise and counterclock­
wise calculations, then we would conclude that the system would not move.
The final complication in these inclined plane problems is the introduction of three masses 
and two connecting cords.
5-12  Consider a flat surface with a coefficient of friction of 0.20 with a 2.0 kg mass and 
a 3 kg mass connected together with a 6 kg mass along a slant as shown in Fig. 5-15. 
The coefficient of friction on the slant is zero. Calculate the acceleration of the system.
Fig. 5-15
Solution: In this problem, note that the tensions are different, leading to three unknowns, 
T1, T2, and a. The solution will require three equations from three vector diagrams, as 
shown in Fig. 5-16. Assume that the acceleration of the system is clockwise.
The frictional retarding force on the 2 kg block is
	
f = mN = 0.20(19.6 N) = 3.92 N	
The frictional retarding force on the 3 kg block is
	
f = mN = 0.20(29.4 N) = 5.88 N	
Fig. 5-16
The equations for the masses are
	
T2 - 3.92 N = 2.0 kg · a	
	
T1 - T2 - 5.88 N = 3.0 kg · a	
	
24.8 N - T1 = 6.0 kg · a	

68	
CHAPTER 5
The last two equations added together are
	
18.9 N - T2 = 9.0 kg · a	
and adding this to the first equation yields
	
15.0 N = 11 kg · a  or  a = 1.36 m/s2	
The tensions come from the first and third equations for the masses:
	
T2 = 3.92 N + 2.0 kg(1.36 m/s2) = 6.64 N	
	
T1 = 24.8 N – 6.0 kg(1.36 m/s2) = 16.6 N	
Circular Motion
A particle moving at constant speed in a circle is moving in uniform circular motion. 
There is an acceleration and a force associated with such a particle. Figure 5-17 shows 
the velocity vectors associated with a particle in uniform circular motion.
Fig. 5-17
While the length of the velocity vector remains the same, the direction changes continu­
ally. The diagram on the left of Fig. 5-17 shows vi and vf, with the tail of the vectors at 
the same point, and Δv. Looking at the limiting case where Δq → 0, the ratio
	
v

The “rad” subscript is a reminder that the acceleration points radially inward. The direc­
tion of arad is also clear from the limiting situation. As Δt → 0, the angle between v and 
Δv → 90°, so the acceleration is directed radially inward.
5-13  A certain car driven in a circle can exert a maximum side force of 0.95g. What is 
the maximum speed for this car driven in a circle of 160 m radius?

FORCES (INCLUDING CENTRIPETAL FORCE)	
69
Solution: A side force of 0.95g means a side force or acceleration directed at right angles 
to the direction of travel of 0.95(9.8 m/s2) = 9.3 m/s2. Using arad = v2/r,

At a speed greater than 38.6 m/s, the car will “slide out of the circle.”
The acceleration directed toward the center of the circle for a mass in uniform circular 
motion is called the centripetal acceleration. The force associated with moving a mass 
in a circle is marad and is called the centripetal force.
5-14  What is the (centripetal) force produced by the tires acting on the pavement for the 
car of Problem 5-13 if the car is 1,200 kg of mass?
Solution: F = marad = 1,200 kg(9.3 m/s2) = 11,200 N.
5-15  A 0.60 kg rubber stopper is whirled in a horizontal circle of 0.80 m radius at a rate

mum radius, before the coin slips, is 0.14 m?
Solution: The frictional force between the coin and turntable provides the center directed 
force to keep the coin on the turntable (Fig. 5-18). This center directed force must equal 
mv2/r.

stant speed in a circle with the cord tracing out a cone. A conical pendulum of length 
l.2 m moves in a circle of radius 0.20 m. What is the period of the pendulum?
Solution: Note that the mass is not given. Start with a vector diagram of the forces on the 
mass, as shown in Fig. 5-19.
Fig. 5-19
The mg must equal the vertical component of the tension in the string T cosq = mg. The 
horizontal component is due to the centripetal force, so T sin q = mv2/r. Dividing the

Go back over Problems 5-13 through 5-18 and notice how each problem could be writ­
ten asking for a different variable. For example, in Problem 5-13, give the side force and 
the velocity, and ask for the radius. In Problem 5-16, give the speed and the coefficient 
of friction, and ask for the radius. Changing the problems like this is an excellent way to 
generate practice (for the test) problems.
5-19  A 2 kg ball is whirled in a vertical circle of radius 1 m at a constant velocity of 
6.28 m/s. Calculate (a) the tension in the cord at the top of the motion, (b) the tension in 
the cord at the bottom of the motion, and (c) the minimum velocity to keep the mass from 
“falling out” at the top of the circle.

We are considering this problem from the reference frame of the ball, not from the point of 
view of the person whirling the ball.  From the person’s point of view, the tension is pull­
ing radially outward. From the ball’s reference frame, the tension is radially inward. If the 
ball is to move in a circle, this must be the case. There must be a net center directed force.

For part c, the minimum velocity required can be found by considering the condition

At this point, you might be thinking that from the point of view of the person on the dirt

wheels leave the ground. This is correct—from the reference frame of the person inside 
the circular motion. Astronauts in the space station orbiting the Earth are weightless. To 
them, there is no net force, and the effect of the mv2/r force is radially outward to coun­
terbalance gravity. If you go around a corner in a car, you seem to feel a force outward 
from the circle, not inward.  But from the reference frame of a stationary observer, there 
must be a net center directed force on both the astronaut (gravity) and the person in the 
car (friction with the seat or door). There must be a net force pointing toward the center 
of the circle; otherwise, the person could not be moving in a circle. Is one force correct 
and the other incorrect? Is either of these forces an illusion? No. They are all real forces. 
Take a “thought trip” in an airplane flying in a horizontal circle with its wings vertical. The 
force acting on you is toward the center of the circle, but you exert an equal and opposite 
force on the seat that is radially out of the circle (this is analogous to the normal force 
concept). In some airplanes, if the banking is done too hard, this radially outward force can 
be so great as to cause the blood in the pilot to remain in the lower part of the body, result­
ing in a loss of oxygen (carried by the blood) to the brain and what is called a blackout. 
So the blackout is the result of a radially outward or centrifugal force. It is a real force! 
Is one reference frame correct and the other incorrect? When you study Einstein’s theory 
of relativity in physics, you will come across the idea that there is no one absolute refer­
ence frame. You may think that a reference frame at rest relative to the ground is correct, 
but the Earth spins on its axis and rotates around the sun. The sun moves around the galac­
tic center. In relativity, we always have to specify the reference frame we are considering. 
And the observed effects of many things change depending on the chosen reference frame. 
So, when doing circular motion problems, always think about what reference frame you are 
considering.  For the method in the preceding problem, our reference frame is outside the 
motion, and in this perspective, we take the net center directed force and set it equal to mv2/r. 
This is the default reference frame that is commonly used to solve circular motion problems.

CHAPTER 6	
APPARENT WEIGHT
75
Apparent weight problems usually are encountered in the discussion of force. Though 
relatively easy, they cause problems for some people. This short chapter should give you 
enough background and examples to show you how to do apparent weight problems.
One of the first points to get straight is the difference between mass and weight. Mass is the 
property that makes different objects accelerate differently when equal forces are applied. 
Operationally, mass is the m in the equation F = ma. Mass is measured in kilograms or 
slugs. Weight in equation form is
	
W = mg	
(6-1)
and is the force something exerts. Weight is measured in newtons or pounds. Popu­
lar usage scrambles weight and mass. Gold and silver are usually sold by the gram or 
kilogram, while nails and chicken feed are sold by the pound.
The first step in keeping all this straight is to remember that weight is force. A scale that 
measures weight in pounds or newtons is just a force meter. Tension in a rope is a force.
A person of 80 kg mass standing on the surface of the Earth is subject to the force of grav­
ity that acts between the 80 kg person and the mass of the Earth. This force is expressed 
as an acceleration due to gravity. On the Earth, this acceleration is 9.8 m/s2. The force on 
the person, also called weight, is
F or W = 80 kg · 9.8 m/s2 = 784 N
A force meter placed between the person and the Earth would read 784 N.
To understand apparent weight, take a “thought trip” (based on experience) on an eleva­
tor. Imagine a force meter between you and the floor of the elevator. As you step on the 
elevator, the force meter reads the same as when you are standing on the ground. As the 
elevator accelerates upward, the force meter registers higher, reading maximum at maxi­
mum acceleration. As the acceleration decreases and the elevator assumes a constant 
velocity (upward), the force meter reads the same as when the elevator was not moving. 
This constant velocity condition is equivalent to forces in equilibrium, so the only thing 
contributing to the reading of your force meter is the mg due to the Earth. As the elevator 
slows, by decelerating, the force meter reads less than the force for constant velocity. As 
the elevator comes to rest at a higher level, the force meter again reads the same as when 
you were at ground level.
Let’s go back over this elevator ride and put in some numbers. At zero or constant veloc­
ity, the force meter reads 784 N. If the elevator were accelerating upward at 2.0 m/s2, 
then the force meter would read
F or W = 784 N + 2.0 m/s2(80 kg) = 944 N
If the elevator were accelerating downward (or decelerating near the top of its trip up) at 
3.0 m/s2, then the force meter would read
F or W = 784 N - 3.0 m/s2(80 kg) = 544 N

76	
CHAPTER 6
If the elevator were in free fall, then the force meter would read zero. The acceleration 
acting on the elevator is the same as on the person.
6-1  A 12 kg flower pot is hanging by a cord from the roof of an elevator. What is the 
tension in the cord when the elevator is stationary and when it is accelerating upward at 
3.0 m/ s2?
Solution: When the elevator is stationary, the tension in the cord is
T = 12 kg(9.8 m/s2) = 118 N
When the elevator is accelerating upward, the tension in the cord is increased by an 
amount equal to ma,
T = 118 N + 12 kg · 3.0 m/s2 = 154 N
Second Solution: Now take another, more analytical look at the problem. When the ele­
vator is at rest, the tension in the cord equals mg, so writing a force statement T – mg = ma, 
where a is zero, produces T = mg.
Fig. 6-1
When the elevator is accelerating upward at 3.0 m/s2, the T - mg = ma equation has an 
acceleration. The hard part of doing the problem this way is keeping the algebraic sign of 
the acceleration correct. Looking at Fig. 6-1, T and a have the same sign, so write
T - 12 kg(9.8 m/s2) = 12 kg(3.0 m/s2)  or  T = 154 N
If you use this vector approach to do apparent weight problems, be especially careful of 
the signs. However you do the problems, go through a little thought experiment to make 
sure that you have the signs right.
Another difficulty with the vector approach to apparent weight has to do with the inter­
pretation of the vector diagram (on the right in Fig. 6-1). If you are an observer outside 
the elevator, you observe an acceleration of the flower pot, as the analysis indicates. If, 
however, you are riding in the elevator, you observe no acceleration of the flower pot 
because you are riding in the accelerating reference frame.
6-2  A rope (fastened at the top) is hanging over a cliff. What is the tension in the rope with 
a 70 kg mountain climber sliding down the rope at a constant acceleration of 6.0 m/s2?
Solution: Performing a little “thought experiment,” the tension in the rope is less than 
if the climber were at zero velocity or sliding at constant velocity. In this instance, the 
6.0 m/s2 must be subtracted from the 9.8 m/s2.
T = (9.8 – 6.0) m/s2(70 kg) = 266 N

APPARENT WEIGHT	
77
When in doubt as to whether to add or subtract the acceleration from g, look to the 
extreme situation. In this problem, the climber sliding down the rope at constant velocity 
would produce (9.8 m/s2)70 kg = 686 N of tension in the rope. If the climber were in free 
fall, that is, accelerating at 9.8 m/s2, he or she would produce no tension in the rope. Thus 
any acceleration down the rope should be subtracted from the 9.8 m/s2.
6-3  What is the tension in a rope with the 70 kg mountain climber of Problem 6-3 accel­
erating (climbing) up the rope at a constant acceleration of 1.0 m/s2?
Solution: In this case, the tension in the rope is increased by ma,
T = (9 .8 +1.0) m/s2 (70 kg) = 756 N
6-4  A 100 kg astronaut produces a force (weight) on the surface of the Earth of 980 N. 
What force (weight) would the astronaut produce on the surface of the moon, where the 
g is about one-sixth the g on Earth?
Solution: The force or weight would be

6-5  A 16 kg monkey wishes to raise a 20 kg mass by climbing (accelerating) up a rope 
that passes over a pulley attached to the mass. How much must the monkey accelerate 
up the rope to raise the mass?
Fig. 6-2
Solution: The mass produces a force or tension in the rope of
Tmass = 20 kg(9.8 m/s2) =196 N
The mass of the monkey hanging on the rope produces a force of
Tmonkey = l6 kg(9.8 m/s2) = 157 N
To just balance the mass, the monkey must accelerate up the rope to produce a force of 
(196 - 157) N = 39 N. Thus
	
39 N = (16 kg)a  or  a = 2.4 m/s2	
At this acceleration, the tension in the rope is 196 N. To raise the mass, the monkey 
must accelerate at a rate greater than 2.4 m/s2. Any acceleration greater than 2.4 m/s2 
will increase the tension in the rope by an amount equal to the “additional” acceleration 
times the mass of the monkey.

WORK AND THE DEFINITE 
INTEGRAL
79
Work is defined as the force, in the direction of a displacement, times that displacement. 
Consider the application of a constant force F applied over a distance x, as depicted in 
Fig. 7-1.
Fig. 7-1
According to the definition, the work is
	
W
F x
o
o
=
	
(7-1)
which is seen as the shaded rectangular area in Fig. 7-1. In calculus terminology, the 
work is the area under the curve. The area under this curve is the area of the rectangle, 
Foxo. The unit of work is the joule (J = N ⋅ m).
7-1  Calculate the work performed by a constant force of 60 N acting in the direction of 
a displacement of 3.0 m.
Solution:
Fig. 7-2
The force is acting in the direction of the displacement, so the work is the product of 
force times displacement.
	
W = F ⋅ x = 60 N ⋅ 3.0 m = 180 J	
In Problem 7-1, the force is in the direction of the displacement, and the work is simply 
the product of force and displacement. In this next problem, the force is not in the direc­
tion of the displacement. The simplest way to obtain the component of the force in the 
direction of the displacement is to form the dot product of force and displacement. Using 
s as a general symbol for displacement, work is defined as the dot product of the force 
vector times the displacement vector.
	
W = F ⋅ s	
(7-2)

80	
CHAPTER 7
Work is a scalar, the dot product of force and displacement. See the Mathematical Back­
ground for a discussion of the dot product.
7-2  Calculate the work performed by a constant force of 40 N pushing a block a distance 
of 3.0 m along a horizontal surface at an angle of 20° with the horizontal as shown in 
Fig. 7-3.
Fig. 7-3
Solution: The work performed is calculated with Equation (7-2). Thus
	
W = F ⋅ s = 40 N cos20° ⋅ 3.0 m = 113 J	
7-3  Calculate the work done by the force of gravity acting on a 70 kg student sliding 
down a 30° inclined slide with a slant distance of 10 m.
Solution: The first thing to calculate is the force due to gravity mg, which is 
70 kg ⋅ 9.8 m/s2 = 686 N. Place this vector on Fig. 7-4 pointing down.
Fig. 7-4
Calculate the force in the direction of the incline.
	
F = 686 N cos60° = 343 N	
The work performed by the gravitational force is:
	
W = F ⋅ s = 343 N ⋅ 10 m = 3430 J	
Now consider variable forces and look first at a force that is proportional to x, the dis­
placement, or F = kx, where k is a constant. This form of force is encountered in springs 
where one unit of force compresses (or elongates) the spring a certain distance and the 
next unit of force doubles the compression, and so on. The graph of force versus displace­
ment is shown in Fig. 7-5.

WORK AND THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL	
81
Fig. 7-5
The area under any curve of force versus distance can be approximated by taking a sum 
of forces times increments of distances over the curve. In this instance, take each incre­
ment as Δx and the associated forces as F1, F2, F3, … up to N forces and increments, as in 
Fig. 7-6. In mathematical language, this sum of the forces would be written as
	
∑

(7-3)
where F represents the N discrete forces measured at intervals of Δx from 0 to xo. This 
sum is a collection of rectangles of height F1, F2, …, FN and width Δx.
Fig. 7-6
Better approximations are obtained by increasing the number of intervals (decreasing the 
width of each one). In the limiting case, the area would be written as

which is a statement that says as Δx → 0, the rectangles become progressively narrower.
Geometrically, this limit of the sum represents the “area under the curve” between x = 
0 and x = xo and physically represents the work performed by this linear force over x. 
For a linear spring, then, the work performed is the shaded triangular area in Fig. 7-5

sary to compress it 3.0 cm.

small increments and calculating the associated force and multiplying to find the area of 
each little approximating rectangle. See the section on integrals in the Mathematical 
Background for more on this technique. This process also can be done for higher power 
curves to come to the conclusion shown in the last entry in the table, the one for the 
general power law curve.

Most of the situations encountered in an elementary course are for constant or linear

the constant k. The k in the equation F = kx has the units N/m. The work performed in 
compressing a “kx” spring is kx2/2. As a final problem, consider the work performed in 
compressing a “quadratic” spring.
C   7-6  What is the work performed in compressing a quadratic spring F = kx2 with

Go back through this chapter and notice the development of the definition of work. 
The first definition was the product of the force in the direction of displacement times 
displacement [Equation (7-1)]. In order to handle forces not in the direction of the dis­
placement, the dot product was introduced [Equation (7-2)]. Finally, for nonconstant 
forces, the integral was introduced, giving the last definition [Equation (7-8)].

CHAPTER 8	
WORK-ENERGY PROBLEMS
85
Work-energy analysis is a very powerful tool for solving problems. Force analysis works 
well in problems where there is a constant force or where there is a balance of forces. 
But when the force acts over a distance, especially when that force is not constant, then 
work-energy analysis is the appropriate analytic tool. To handle the transformation of 
force over a distance (or work performed) to energy, we first need to define the concepts 
of kinetic and potential energy.
Kinetic Energy
A constant force applied to a mass over a distance produces an acceleration according 
to F = ma. This acceleration over a distance changes the velocity of the mass in accord 
with the kinematic equation

This simple derivation suggests a more formal look at the work performed on a mass by

When a force is applied to a mass over a distance and that mass accelerates, then there is 
a difference in velocity of the mass between before and after the application of the force. 
The work performed is manifest in this velocity, and the mv2/2 form is called kinetic 
energy. Work is transformed into kinetic energy.

CHAPTER 8
Gravitational Potential Energy
Gravitational potential energy comes from the acceleration due to gravity and the accom­
panying force on a mass on the surface of the Earth. If a mass is raised from a height y1 
to a height y2, directly opposite the acceleration due to gravity, then the work performed 
appears as gravitational potential energy.

This mgy term is the gravitational potential. In mechanical systems, the total energy of 
the system is the sum of the kinetic plus potential energies.
In a mechanical system on the surface of the Earth, work performed on the system (mass) 
can appear as kinetic or potential energy.
	
Work performed = change in kinetic energy + change in potential energy	
A convenient way of understanding this is to say that work “goes into” kinetic or poten­
tial energy. “Goes into” may be shortened to the one very descriptive word “Goesinto.” 
As the problems get more complicated, you will find this “Goesinto” concept more and 
more useful.
Look first at a block sliding down a frictionless inclined plane, as shown in Fig. 8-2. The 
velocity at the bottom of the plane is related to the height h from which the block “fell.”
Fig. 8-2
The kinetic energy at the bottom of the plane is mv2/2, and this must equal mgh, the 
potential energy at the top of the plane. The gravitational potential energy Goesinto 
kinetic energy.

v =

8.2 m/s

If the block were to continue to slide horizontally along a frictionless surface, it would 
maintain this 8.2 m/s velocity.
Frictional Forces
Frictional forces are proportional to the normal force (the force between the two surfaces) 
and a constant characteristic of the interface (the surfaces involved). They also act to 
oppose the motion. Frictional forces acting over a distance result in energy lost due to 
friction. In the example shown in Fig. 8-2, a coefficient of friction between the block 
and a flat surface at the bottom of the plane would result in energy lost to friction and the 
block eventually coming to rest. In this problem, potential energy at the top of the incline 
plane Goesinto kinetic energy at the bottom of the plane, and this energy Goesinto work 
to overcome friction.
Give the flat surface (Fig. 8-2) a coefficient of 0.20, and the frictional retarding force is

To find the distance the block slides, we can go back to the kinetic energy at the bottom 
of the plane or the potential energy at the top of the plane. Since there are no losses, these 
numbers must be the same. Take the potential energy at the top of the plane because it is 
easier to calculate and is original data in the problem. This energy must equal the work 
due to friction fL or
	
mgh = fL = mmgL	
or

8-1  Place a 3 kg block at the top of a 3.4 m high frictionless incline. At the bottom of the 
incline, the block encounters a spring with a constant of 400 N/m on a horizontal surface. 
No energy is lost to friction. How far is the spring compressed?
Solution: The energy at the top of the plane, which is the same as the energy at the bottom 
of the plane, Goesinto compressing the spring. The energy at the top of the plane is, from 
the example problem, 100 J, so

horizontal surface. How far does the block slide while compressing the spring?
Solution: Now the potential energy Goesinto compressing the spring and overcoming 
friction. This statement is very helpful in writing the equation. In words, the potential 
energy mgh equals the energy to compress the spring kx2/2 plus the work to overcome

The negative root is inappropriate for this problem. The block compresses the spring

It is instructive to do a problem first with force analysis and then with work-energy 
analysis. Consider the case of a block sliding down an inclined plane with a coefficient 
of friction. As will become evident, it is possible to do this problem with force analysis 
techniques. Work-energy analysis is, however, conceptually and computationally easier. 
The force analysis follows the procedures in Chapter 5.
8-3  Consider the inclined plane with friction shown in Fig. 8-4, and calculate the veloc­
ity of the block at the bottom of the plane using force analysis and then work-energy 
analysis.
Solution: The vector diagram is also shown in Fig. 8-4. The unbalanced force of 20 N 
acts on the 5 kg block, causing it to accelerate at 4 m/s2 down the plane. The slant height 
of the plane is 6 m/sin35° = 10.5 m.

89
Second Solution: Now do the same problem using work-energy analysis. When the 
block is at the top of the plane, the energy is:
	
mgh = 5 kg(9.8 m/s2)6 m = 294 J	
At the bottom of the plane, all this (potential) energy has gone into kinetic energy (veloc­
ity of the block) except for the amount used to do work against the frictional force. The 
work (against the frictional force) is:
	
mNL = 0.20(40 N)10.5 m = 84 J	
The energy “left” after the block has slid down the plane is the 294 J at the top of the 
plane minus the 84 J lost due to friction, and this energy (= 210 J) is manifest in the veloc­
ity of the block (kinetic energy). This “energy” is equal to the mv2/2, the kinetic energy 
of the block at the bottom of the plane.

8-4  A 3 kg block sliding at 12 m/s along a frictionless surface encounters a spring with 
a force constant of 500 N/m resting on a surface with a coefficient of friction of 0.25. 
The friction surface is only under the spring. What is the maximum compression of the 
spring?
Solution: Before looking at Fig. 8-5, try drawing the diagram yourself. On exams, you 
sometimes have to work a problem from only a word description. As you are working 
through these problems, practice drawing the diagrams, and do not hesitate to use several 
diagrams. Notice the previous problem, where the system was depicted with the vector 
diagram beside it. Sketching the system and all the vectors on a single diagram is unnec­
essary confusion. Use multiple diagrams and reduce the clutter.
Fig. 8-5
When the block encounters the spring and the friction surface, all the energy is kinetic, 
mv2/2. This energy Goesinto compressing the spring and sliding along the friction 
surface. In equation form,

Be careful in writing this statement. Many people write the kinetic energy correctly, 
the energy to compress the spring correctly, and then write the force to slide along the 
friction surface. Be aware of this mistake, and check the units to be sure that the units 
on one side of the equation are the same as the units on the other side of the equation. 
You may have noticed that in all problems the first equation is written with units just 
as a reminder that checking units will reduce the number of errors. It is very frustrating 
to make a simple mistake that could have been avoided had units been checked in the 
problem before proceeding with the numerical calculations.

This is the amount the spring is compressed as the block comes to a stop.
8-5  For the situation described in Problem 8-4, find the velocity with which the block 
leaves the spring.
Solution: Start this problem with the spring compressed the 0.91 m. At this point the 
potential energy stored in the spring is used to push the block 0.91 m back across the 
friction surface. The energy remaining as the block leaves the spring is the original 
kinetic energy less the energy expended in two 0.91 m trips across this friction surface.

of a spring with a force constant of 300 N/m placed at the bottom of the incline, as shown 
in Fig. 8-6. Calculate the compression of the spring when the block slides down the plane.
Solution: An approximate answer can be obtained by setting mgh, where h is the vertical

This value is somewhat larger than calculated earlier, as expected, due to the “additional

The procedure of finding an approximate solution and then refining it to the exact solu­
tion is very helpful in attacking problems. First, you get an approximate solution that is 
close to the exact one, and second, you educate yourself as to how to proceed to the exact 
solution. This procedure is used in the last problem in this chapter.
8-7  Place a mass on a track made up of a flat section L with coefficient of friction m and 
two frictionless semicircular surfaces of radius R. Let the mass start from the top of one 
of the semicircles, and calculate where it comes to rest.
Solution:
Fig. 8-7

92	
CHAPTER 8
The initial potential energy is mgR. When the mass encounters the friction surface, this 
(potential) energy is dissipated in doing work to overcome friction. Assuming that the 
energy lost due to friction in one traverse is less than the initial potential energy, the mass 
will rise to a height (on the opposite semicircle) R′ dictated by the energy statement
	
mgR′ = mgR - mmgL	
After another traverse of the flat portion of the track, the height will be dictated by
	
mgR″ = mgR - 2mmgL	
and so on until all the original potential energy is dissipated.
8-8  For the track shown in Problem 8-7, take µ = 0.10, R = 1 m, and L = 2 m, and find 
where the mass stops.
Solution: The only way the mass loses energy is by sliding along the flat “friction” part 
of the track. The initial potential energy Goesinto frictional work.
	
(mg)1.0 m = 0.10(mgx)  or  x = 10 m	
The mass crosses the friction area five times and ends up at the edge of the friction sur­
face opposite from where it started.
8-9  Consider a 10 g bullet passing through a 3 kg block resting on a table. The velocity 
of the bullet is 400 m/s on entering the block and 250 m/s on exit. Calculate the energy

8-10  If 30 percent of the energy lost in Problem 8-9 is available to move the block along 
a surface with a coefficient of friction of 0.80, how far will it move?
Solution: Equate the energy available to the work performed.
	
0.30ΔKE = µmgL  so  0.30(488 J) = 0.80(3 kg)(9.8 m/s2) L  or  L = 6.2 m	
8-11  Consider an elevator weighing 4,000 N held 5 m above a spring with a force con­
stant of 8,000 N/m. The elevator falls onto the spring while subject to a frictional retard­
ing force (brake) of 1,000 N. Describe the motion of the elevator.

WORK-ENERGY PROBLEMS	
93
Solution:
Fig. 8-8
The potential energy of the elevator with respect to the top of the spring is
	
mgh = 4,000 N(5 m) = 20,000 J	
When the elevator falls, this energy, less the energy lost due to the frictional brake, is 
available to compress the spring.
	
20,000 J - 1,000 N(5 m) = 15,000 J = energy to compress spring	
The friction brake stays on while the elevator is in contact with the spring, so this energy 
Goesinto kx2/2 + fx. In equation form, this is
	
15,000 J = k(x2/2) + fx	
This expression is only approximately correct because if the spring is compressed a 
distance x, then this mgx provides an additional amount of potential energy. The correct 
equation that determines the compression of the spring is

This amount of energy will raise the elevator and do work against friction according to 
the equation
	
22,040 J = mgx′ + fx′  or  22,040 J = (5,000 N)x′  or  x′ = 4.4 m	
This places the elevator 2.1 m above the spring.
This analysis can be repeated until the elevator comes to a stop. As an exercise, perform 
one more “bounce” of the elevator starting at 2.1 m above the spring.
The elevator will continue to bounce up and down off the spring until the weight of the 
elevator is equal to the force of the spring plus the frictional force
	
4,000 N = 1,000 N + (8,000 N/m)s  or  s = 0.38 m	
so the elevator comes to rest with the spring compressed 0.38 m.

CENTER OF MASS AND

These mass points act as if all their mass (50 kg) were at the point (0.72, 0.24). If these 
three masses were placed on a plate of negligible mass, the balance point would be at 
(0.72, 0.24).

96	
CHAPTER 9
The law of conservation of momentum can be viewed as a consequence of the state­
ment: the total mass of a collection of particles times the acceleration of the center of 
mass equals the applied, or external, force, that is, the sum of the forces on all the indi­
vidual component masses. This is, of course, a vector equation.
	
Macm = Fext

9-2  For the same collection of masses at the same points, as in Problem 9-1, add forces as 
shown in Fig. 9-2 to each mass, and find the resulting acceleration of the center of mass.

vector sum of all these forces. Applying Equation 9-3,

, then if 
Fext = 0, mvcm must be a constant. (The derivative of a constant is zero; or viewed graphi­
cally, if the curve of mv versus time is a constant, then the slope is zero.)
Stated another way, for a system with no external forces, the sum of the momentum 
vectors m1v1 + m2v2 + . . . , which add to mvcm, must all add to zero.
9-3  A 5.0 g pellet is compressed against a spring in a gun of mass 300 g. The spring is 
released and the gun allowed to recoil with no friction as the pellet leaves the gun. If the 
speed of the recoiling gun is 8.0 m/s, what is the speed of the pellet?
Solution: This problem is solved by application of the law of conservation of momen­
tum. This law can be applied because there is no external force. Since there is no external 
force, all the mv’s must add to zero.

Center of mass and MOMENTUM	
97
	
mgvg = mpvp  or  mgvg – mpvp = 0	
Fig. 9-3
The conservation of momentum statement on the left is based on the simple observation 
“bullet goes one way; gun goes the other,” while the formal statement that the mv’s add 
to zero is on the right. With a well labeled diagram of the situation, the statement on the 
left is probably easier to visualize; that is, the momenta are equal and opposite. Putting 
in the numbers,
	
300 g(8.0 m/s) = 5.0 g · vp  or  vp = 480 m/s	
As a check, note that the momentum of the gun Pg = mgvg = 2.4 kg · m/s and the momen­
tum of the pellet Pp = mpvp = 2.4 kg · m/s are numerically equal and, because they are in 
opposite directions, add to zero.
The energy of each is mv2/2 or p2/ 2m. So, for the gun,

 at an angle of 56° to the

Second Solution: A more formal approach is to write a conservation of momentum 
statement equating the total (vector) momentum before the collision to the total (vector) 
momentum after the collision. Take the plus i direction as the initial direction of the first 
player and the plus j direction as the original direction of the second player. Using the 
numbers already calculated,
	
(900i + 1,350j ) kg · m/s = (165 kg) vf  or  vf = (5.45i + 8.18j ) m/s	
As an exercise, verify the final velocity of 9.83 m/s at the 56° angle.
9-6  James Bond is skiing along being pursued by Goldfinger, also on skis. Assume no 
friction. Mr. Bond, at 100 kg, fires backward a 40 g bullet at 800 m/s. Goldfinger, at 120 kg, 
fires forward at Bond with a similar weapon. What is the relative velocity change after the 
exchange of six shots each? No bullets hit Bond or Goldfinger.
Solution: The problem is analyzed with conservation of momentum. The mbvb of the bul­
let fired by Bond increases his momentum by mBΔvB. Remember that each bullet Bond 
fires increase his velocity. Set mbvb = mBΔvB, and solve for ΔvB .
	
40 × 10–3 kg (800 m/s) = (100 kg)ΔvB  or  ΔvB = 0.32 m/s	
The 40 × 10–3 kg bullet is small compared to the 100 kg of Bond, and it would not affect 
the calculation. The ΔvB notation is used to indicate that each bullet fired by Bond causes 
a change in his velocity.

for each pair of shots fired. For six shots, this amounts to a difference of 3.48 m/s. If 
Bond and Goldfinger had been traveling at the same speed, then after this exchange Bond 
would have a relative speed advantage of 3.48 m/s.
9-7  A 3,000 kg closed boxcar traveling at 3.0 m/s is overtaken by a 1,000 kg open boxcar 
traveling at 5.0 m/s. The cars couple together. Find the resulting speed of the combination.
Solution: The momentum before coupling is the same as the momentum after coupling 
(no external forces).
	
3,000 kg(3.0 m/s) + 1,000 kg(5.0 m/s) = (4,000 kg) v  or  v = 3.5 m/s	
9-8  Continuing Problem 9-7, rain falls into the open boxcar so that the mass increases at 
1.0 kg/s. What is the velocity of the boxcars at 500 s?
Solution: The total momentum of the boxcars is 4,000 kg(3.5 m/s) =14,000 kg · m/s. 
Assume that there is no horizontal component of the rain to change the momentum in the 
direction of motion of the boxcars. The mass increases by (1.0 kg/s)3.5 m/s = 500 kg. 
The momentum is a constant, so the new velocity is
	
l4,000 kg · m/s = (4,500 kg)vR  or  vR = 3.11 m/s	
C   9-9  For the situation described in Problems 9-7 and 9-8, what is the rate of change 
in velocity for the boxcars?
Solution: This is a very interesting calculus problem that involves taking the total deriva­
tive. Since there are no external forces, the total change in mv must equal zero, so
	
d(mv) = mdv + vdm = 0  or  mdv = –vdm	
Now write m as a function of time.
	
m = mo + rt = 4,000 kg + (1.0 kg/s)t	
The derivative of m is dm = rdt.

9-10  A 3.0 kg cat is in a 24 kg boat. The cat is 10 m from the shore. The cat walks 
3.0 m toward the shore. How far is the cat from the shore? Assume no friction between 
boat and water.
Solution: There are no external forces, so the center of mass of the cat-boat system is con­
stant. Knowing that the center of mass doesn’t move is all that is necessary to do this problem.

per second. Each pellet has a mass of 20 g and falls a distance of 2.0 m. Assuming that 
the pellets do not bounce, calculate the scale reading at 7.0 s.
Solution: There are two components of the force. Momentum is transferred to the scale 
pan, giving a constant force. The pellets are accumulating in the scale pan, giving a time 
dependent part of the force.
First, calculate the velocity of the pellets as they hit the scale pan.

CHAPTER 9
9-12  You stand at the end of a long board of length L. The board rests on a frictionless 
frozen surface of a pond. You want to jump to the opposite end of the board. What is 
the minimum takeoff speed v measured with respect to the pond that would allow you to 
accomplish this? The board and you have the same mass m. Use g for the acceleration 
due to gravity.
Solution: Some physics teachers like to give problems that require you to work out 
algebraic solutions rather than finding a numerical answer. This problem has no spe­
cific numbers given, so the answer will be in terms of the length L and the gravitational 
constant g. 
The first big realization that you have to make is that by conservation of momentum, if 
the person jumps one way, the board goes the opposite way. There is no friction, and the 
person and the board both have the same mass, so this means that the person only has to 
jump a length of L/2 to end up landing on the opposite end.
Are you thinking about what angle the person jumps? Remember from kinematics that 
the maximum range comes at a 45° angle. The question is asking about minimum takeoff 
speed. This will occur at 45°. Now we need to start with the maximum range formula 
from kinematics and solve as follows:

Momentum provides a new analysis technique. With force analysis and work-energy 
analysis, application of the appropriate analysis technique to “the problems at the end 
of the chapter” was reasonably straightforward. At the end of the chapter on forces, use 
force analysis. At the end of the chapter on work energy, use work-energy analysis. 
However, at the end of the chapter on momentum, we need to use momentum and work-
energy analysis. Knowing when to use work-energy analysis and when to use momentum 
analysis adds a whole new dimension to problem solving.
As will become evident in this chapter, there are certain types of collision problems where 
conservation of momentum and conservation of energy can be applied and certain problems 
where only conservation of momentum can be applied. This is nowhere better illustrated 
than in the Ballistic Pendulum Problem (presented later), where conservation of momen­
tum is applied in one part of the problem and conservation of energy in another part of the 
problem. Learning where to apply these two conservation laws is difficult. As the problems 
in this chapter are presented, be aware of which law is being applied and why.
Before doing specific problems, take a general look at collisions in one dimension. 
Throughout the discussion, A and B will designate the two particles, and 1 and 2 will 
designate before and after the collision.
There are two types of collisions:
•	 In elastic collisions, both momentum and energy are conserved. Examples of elastic 
collisions are billiard balls or any collision where the participants bounce.
•	 In inelastic collisions, only momentum is conserved. Examples of inelastic collisions 
are railroad cars coupling or a steel ball thrown into a piece of clay or any collision 
where the participants stick together.
It is this sticking or nonsticking that determines if energy is conserved or not. When we 
say that energy is not conserved in a collision where the participants stick together, we 
mean only that mechanical energy (1/2)
2
mv  is not conserved.
Inelastic Collisions
Consider first inelastic collisions, where the particles stick together. Using the notation

10-1  A ballistic pendulum, a device for measuring the speed of a bullet, consists of a 
block of wood suspended by cords. When the bullet is fired into the block, the block is 
free to rise. How high does a 5.0 kg block rise when a 12 g bullet traveling at 350 m/s 
is fired into it?
Fig. 10-3

COLLISION AND IMPULSE	
105
Solution: This is a most interesting and instructive problem. The collision between the 
bullet and the block is clearly inelastic (the bullet comes to rest in the block). Part of the 
kinetic energy of the bullet Goesinto friction as the bullet burrows its way into the block. 
Therefore, mechanical energy is not conserved.
Because the collision is inelastic, apply conservation of momentum to the collision. Before 
the collision, all the momentum is in the mv of the bullet. After the collision, the momentum 
is in the (m + M)V of the block and bullet. We assume that the bullet comes to rest (transfers 
all its momentum) before there is appreciable motion of the bullet-block combination.
	
mv = (m + M )V	
After the collision, the rise of the block is determined by energy analysis. The kinetic 
energy of the block Goesinto potential energy.
	
(1/2)(m + M)V 2 = (m + M)gh    or    V 2/2 = gh

10-2  A 6.0-g bullet is fired horizontally into a 2.8-kg block resting on a horizontal sur­
face with a coefficient of friction of 0.30. The bullet comes to rest in the block, and the 
block slides 0.65 m before coming to a stop. What is the velocity of the bullet?
Solution:
Fig. 10-4
Assume that the bullet comes to rest in the block before the block moves appreciably and 
that all the momentum in the bullet is transferred to the bullet-block combination.
	
mv = (m + M)V	
Once the bullet-block combination is moving at V, the kinetic energy (1/2)(m + M)V 2 
Goesinto work to overcome friction µ(m + M)gx.
	
(1/2)(m + M)V 2 = µ(m + M)gx    or    V 2/2 = µgx

Elastic Collisions
Now look at elastic collisions, where the particles bounce. In elastic collisions no energy

Now divide the (rewritten) conservation of energy statement by the conservation of 
momentum statement to find
	
vA1 + vA2 = vB2 + vB1    or    vA1 – vB1 = –(vA2 – vB2)	
The term vA1 – vB1 is the speed of approach, the speed of A relative to B measured by an 
observer on B. The term vA2 – vB2 is the speed of departure. So, in an elastic collision, the 
speed of approach is equal to the speed of departure.
Now find expressions for the velocities after the collision in terms of the masses and the 
velocities before the collision. From the velocity statement (earlier),
	
vB2 = vA1 + vA2 – vB1	
From the conservation of momentum statement (earlier), substitute the equation for vB2,

Look at some special cases: If mA = mB, the masses are equal, and then
	
vA2 = vB1    and    vB2 = vA1

end. The ball is released at the horizontal and strikes a 3.0 kg steel block resting on a 
surface with a coefficient of friction of 0.25. How far does the block travel?
Solution: This problem is similar to the ballistic pendulum problem in that conservation 
of energy and conservation of momentum and then work energy have to be applied 
correctly. From the description of the collision, assume that it is elastic.
Fig. 10-6
First, calculate the velocity of the ball as it hits the block. Potential energy Goesinto

Go back over this problem and see where energy analysis is applied, conservation of

where in the problems is the hard part of collision problems.
Impulse
Impulse is the name given to a force that acts for a very short period of time. A struck 
baseball, golf ball, and tennis ball are examples of impulses or impulse forces. In most 
impulses, it is impossible to graph force versus time, though we can often estimate how 
the force varies with time.
Force is defined in terms of change in momentum as
	
 
(
)
F
mv
t
= ∆

If the force is time dependent, F(t), then rewriting,
	
Δ(mv) = F(t)Δt	
With calculus notation this statement would be written as

The left side is the change in momentum, and the right side is the area under the F(t) 
versus t curve. This integral is called the impulse or impulse integral. If the curve of F(t) 
versus t were a parabola (reasonable for an impulse), then the right side of the equation 
would be the area under the curve in Fig. 10-7.

CHAPTER 11	
ROTATIONAL MOTION
111
The study of rotational motion begins with the kinematics of the motion, that is, the relation 
between angle q  angular velocity w  and angular acceleration a. Start with a point rotating 
about the origin of a coordinate system, usually an x-y system, with r-q  superimposed.
Begin with the definition of radian measure as angle equals arc length over radius. This 
gives the angle as a pure number, or radians. Radian is a phantom unit; sometimes it is 
used and sometimes not. For example, for an arc length of 4 m on a circle of radius 2 m, 
the angle in radians is 4 m/2 m = 2. This is usually written as 2 rad. In a problem involv­
ing canceling units, this can add confusion because rad is length over length or unity and 
does not cancel with anything. So rad may appear in a problem and then disappear in the 
answer, or vice versa, thus fitting the description “phantom.” When radian is used in a 
problem, the unit is for clarity and will not necessarily be in the final answer.
Fig. 11-1

Another set of relationships in rotational motion is the one between linear motion and 
angular motion. These relate the motion of a particle, or point, along a circular path 
to the angular motion. Position along the circular path is called the linear position. 
These relationships come out of the definition of radian measure, q  = s/r or s = rq. 
For the constant r, a small change in s is related to a small change in q  by Δs = rΔq; 
and if the change is over time, then Δs/Δt = r(Δq/Δt) or v = rw, relating the linear 
velocity, the velocity of a point on the rim, to the angular velocity. For a small change 
in linear velocity, Δv = rΔw, and if this occurs over time, Δv/Δt = r(Δw/Δt) or a = ra, 
relating the linear acceleration, the acceleration of a point on the rim, to the angu­
lar acceleration. Formal definitions of angular velocity and angular acceleration are 
found in Chapter 12.

112	
CHAPTER 11
There is one more relationship in angular motion. If a point is rotating on a circle with 
constant angular velocity w, the linear velocity is numerically constant. But velocity is 
a vector; and while the number associated with the linear velocity is not changing, the 
direction is changing. Refer to Fig. 11-2.
Fig. 11-2
The vectors v and v ′ are separated by an angle q. The acceleration is the difference 
between the vectors. Remember, the vectors v and v ′ are at right angles to the radius, so 
the angle between v and v ′ is the same as the angle between the r’s. Drawing the figure 
for the r’s and another figure for the v’s, with the v’s placed tail to tail, we have similar 
triangles (isosceles triangles with the same angles). For small angles, Δs approaches a 
straight line, so comparing the similar triangles, write
	
 
v

and from this relation, write

The acceleration vector points inward along r. Refer to Fig. 11-2 and note that in the limit 
as Δt → 0, Δs → 0, and Δv → 0, Δv and a point toward the center of the circle. These are 
all the relations necessary to do problems in rotational motion.
Use this sample problem to become familiar with manipulating revolutions, revolutions 
per minute, and radians. A wheel is rotating on its axis at 100 revolutions per minute. 
This is usually written as 100 rpm. The angle turned through in each minute is 100 times 
2p (radians). This little calculation is often missed in rotation problems. Each revolution 
represents an angle of 2p measured in radians.
The angular speed is w  = 2p  ⋅ 100 rad/min. Converting to seconds, w   = (2p  ⋅ 100 rad/min)
(1 min/60 s) = (10p/3) rad/s. Assume that the wheel slows, under constant acceleration, 
to zero in 3.0 minutes.

as (rad/s2) or (1/s2), which is why radian is called a phantom unit. Radians and revolutions

are usually introduced as units for convenience in understanding a problem and not as 
units to be carried and manipulated, as is the case with kg, m, s, and so on. Be very careful

Applications
From kinematics, we can go to some more complicated rotational problems.
11-5  Consider a space station in the form of a donut with a rectangular cross section con­
nected by spokes to a central axis. The “floor” is the inside of the outer wall. How fast 
would a 300 m radius station have to rotate to duplicate the “acceleration due to gravity” 
on the surface of the Earth?
Fig. 11-3
Solution: The required acceleration is the v2/r acceleration associated with rotational 
motion. Since v is related to w  by v = rw, then the required acceleration a = v 2/r = rw 2. 
Set this acceleration equal to 9.8 m/s2 and solve for w

11-6  If someone of weight 800 N (on Earth) living in the space station described in 
Problem 11-5 were to move one-half the radius in toward the axis of rotation, what would 
be his or her weight at this radius?
Solution: The person’s weight, what a force meter placed between the person and the 
“floor” would read, in this environment would be

If the person in the space station were placed in a “black box” where he or she were 
unaware of his or her surroundings, there is no experiment the person could perform to 
determine whether his or her weight were produced by the mv2/r of the space station or 
mg of the Earth or any other planet.
Consider astronauts in Earth orbit. From the reference frame of the astronauts, the mv2/r force 
is balanced by the gravitational force of the Earth. This lack of force, or weightlessness, has a 
dramatic effect on the bodies of Earth orbiters, who typically “grow” 2 to 3 cm in Earth orbit.
Many physics textbooks treat all problems involving centripetal force from an external 
reference point. This sometimes may be confusing. Keep this clear in your mind; from 
the reference point of the external observer, there is no “centrifugal” force, or force 
that acts radially out. However, in many instances the most practical way of solving 
uniform circular motion problems is from the point of view of the object being rotated. 
Operationally, this means to treat them as force balance problems in which mv2/r acts 
radially out. Look back at Problem 5-16, where the coin is rotating on the turntable. If 
you were riding on the coin at constant angular velocity, you would say that there is 
no unbalanced force in the radial direction; the mv2/r force acting out is balanced by 
the mN force acting in.
11-7  Consider a mass of 2.0 kg being whirled in a sling in a horizontal circle. The period 
of rotation is 1.0 s and the radius is 1.0 m. What is the tension in the cord?
Solution: The force that makes the mass travel in a circle must be equal to mv2/r. The 
velocity of the mass is the distance traveled (one circumference) divided by the time to 
travel one circumference (the period).

CHAPTER 11
Be aware of how tension in the cord is interpreted. If you are whirling the cord, the ten­
sion, from your point of view, is radially out. From the point of view of the mass in the 
sling, however, the tension is pointing in. This is similar to force problems with blocks, 
where the tension in the connecting string acts one way on one block and the other way 
on another block. See, for example, Problem 5-7.
In linear motion, something moving at constant velocity is not acted on by an unbalanced 
force. In circular motion, something moving in uniform circular motion is subject to a 
force, the mv2/r force to produce the acceleration necessary to make it move in a circle.
To help keep this straight in your mind, take a “thought trip” in an airplane flying in a 
vertical bank (wings vertical) in a horizontal circle. A force meter between you and the 
seat of the airplane would read a number equal to your m times v2/r. The force acting 
on you is toward the center of the circle, but you exert an equal (in magnitude) force on 
the seat that is radially out of the circle. In some airplanes, the force can be so great as 
to cause the blood in the pilot to remain in the lower part of his or her body, resulting in 
loss of oxygen (carried by the blood) to the brain and “blackout.”
Make a slight variation in this “thought trip” by having the airplane move in a vertical 
circle. Now the force meter between you and the seat reads mg more or less than mv2/r 
depending on whether you are on the top or the bottom of the loop.
11-8  Take the same mass, radius, and period as in Problem 11-7 but with the rotation in 
a vertical circle. What is the force between the mass and the sling?
Solution: In this case, gravity has to be taken into account. The mass exerts a force on the 
sling radially out and equal to mv2/r. Gravity exerts a force mg down. Figure 11-4 shows 
the relative direction of these forces at four points on the circle.
The gravitational force is mg = (2.0 kg)9.8 m/s2 = 19.6 N. The force between the mass 
and the sling, as shown in Fig. 11-4, is 79.0 + 19.6 = 98.6 N at the bottom of the circle 
and 79.0 - 19.6 = 59.4 N at the top of the circle.

This result can be checked by whirling a mass in a vertical circle and observing that 
the mass “falls out” of the circle at a period of over 2.0 s. (The length from shoulder to 
ground is a little over 1.0 m for most people, so this is an easy experiment to perform. 
For a little adventure, try it with a container of liquid!)
11-10  A glider pilot wishing to fly in a vertical loop dives to attain a speed sufficient 
to keep the glider from “falling out” of the top of the loop. What is the minimum entry 
speed for a 200 m radius loop?
Solution: This problem is solved with energy analysis. At the bottom of the loop, the 
glider must have sufficient kinetic energy to climb the diameter of the loop and have 
enough left to satisfy the mv2/r = mg condition. Refer to Fig. 11-5 to write the energy 
balance statement and the criteria for the glider not “falling out” of the loop.
Fig. 11-5
The energy statement is in word form: kinetic energy at entry equals the potential energy 
to reach the top of the loop plus the kinetic energy at the top of the loop.

11-11  A grinding wheel of 30 cm diameter is rotating with angular velocity of 3.0 rad/s 
and slowing under constant acceleration of -3.0 rad/s2. Calculate everything possible 
about the motion at several different times.
Solution: Circular motion problems even more than linear motion problems often present 
a challenge as to how to proceed from the data to the specific question. When confused 
about the specific route to follow in a problem, the best thing to do is calculate something 
simple and let this first calculation lead you to others and ultimately the answer. After 
doing the problem once the “hard way,” you will learn more direct routes through the 
problem. Given the data in this problem, start calculating some simple things.

CHAPTER 12
ROTATIONAL DYNAMICS
119
Because we take another view of rotational motion in the beginning of this chapter, you 
may find it helpful to first review the discussion of rotational motion in Chapter 11.
Consider the rotation of a solid about some point in a plane. The rotation is counter­
clockwise in conformity with trigonometry. The angle is again defined as arc length over 
radius, the standard definition appropriate to radian measure q = s/r.

A force has to be associated with the angular acceleration. Force, however, does not lend 
itself well to motion of a particle constrained to move in a circle because most forces are

CHAPTER 12
not tangent to a circle. Torque works much better. Torque is defined in a rather unusual 
manner. Unusual, that is, until its utility is seen through experience in rotational dynamics.
Torque is the vector product of r, the vector from the axis of rotation to the rotating 
point, and F, the force applied at that point.

τ =

(12-1)
You may want to review the definitions of the cross product in the Mathematical 
Background before continuing. Most problems in torque can be done with the geometric 
interpretation of the cross product. Torque r × F is the product of r and the component 
of F perpendicular to r, or 
θ
r F sin , as shown on the left in Fig. 12-2.
Fig. 12-2
The torque vector is perpendicular to the plane of r and F and follows the right-hand rule 
of rotating r into F. In this case, the torque is out of the page.
12-1  Calculate the torque on a 2.5 kg mass constrained to rotate in a 1.6 m radius circle 
with a 250 N force applied at a (constant) angle of 35° between r and F.
Solution: The problem is depicted in Fig. 12-2. The definition of r × F gives the direc­
tion of the torque as out of the pages. Application of the crossing of r into F is similar to 
generating a right-handed coordinate system by rotating x into y with the right hand, with 
the thumb giving the direction of z. The magnitude of the torque is

Torque is r cross force, and similarly, angular momentum is r cross momentum, or
	
L = r × p	
(12-2)
Angular momentum is a vector in a direction perpendicular to the plane of r and p and 
magnitude equal to the product of r and the component of p perpendicular to r.
12-2  For the situation of Problem 12-1, add that the linear velocity is 2.8 m/s, and find 
the angular momentum.
Solution: The linear momentum is mv = 2.5 kg(2.8 m/s) = 7.0 kg ⋅ m/s. The linear veloc­
ity is the tangential velocity, which is always at right angles to the radius, so the direction 

ROTATIONAL DYNAMICS	
121
of the angular momentum vector is out of the pages, and the magnitude of the cross 
product is simplified because the sine of 90° is 1.
	
L = rp = 1.6 m(7.0 kg ⋅ m/s) = 11.2 kg ⋅ m2/s2	
C   With these definitions for torque and momentum, several relationships can be 
derived. Start with

Torque is the time derivative of angular momentum as force is the time derivative of 
linear momentum. Now, by analogue, several things follow.
The total angular momentum of a system is the sum of the angular momenta of the indi­
vidual pieces. Internal torques are equal and opposite, so only external torques change 
the angular momentum of the system. The statement
	
L

P
F

If the derivative of the total angular momentum is zero, the condition for no external 
torques, then the angular momentum is a constant.
Now look to the kinetic energy associated with rotating particles. Each particle, or piece, 
of a rotating mass has a linear speed v = rw, and the kinetic energy for each piece is a sum.

The rotational inertia I is easy to calculate for individual particles and has been calculated 
for many shapes. Tabulations are found in most physics books and some mathematical 
tables.
12-3  Calculate the rotational inertia for one 2.0 kg mass at the end of a 3.0 m rod of 
negligible mass and then the rotational inertia of a dumbbell consisting of two 2.0 kg 
masses on the ends of a 6.0 m long rod of negligible mass pivoted about the center of 
the rod.

122	
CHAPTER 12
Solution: For the one mass, the sum of the mr2’s is just 2.0 kg(9.0 m2) = 18 kg ⋅ m2.
For the dumbbell, there are two masses, and the rotational inertia would be 36 kg ⋅ m2. 
Notice that if the dumbbell were rotated about one mass, then the rotational inertia would 
be 2.0 kg(36 m2) = 72 kg ⋅ m2. This is, of course, neglecting the extent of the mass close 
around the rotating axis.
The total momentum of a rotating mass (point) is mvr. If the mass is rotating, then v is 
perpendicular to r, leading to a simple statement of angular momentum.
Angular momentum is

Conservation of Angular Momentum
Angular momentum, as a property of the motion, is conserved and is a powerful tool 
in solving certain problems in rotational motion. First, calculate a torque using the 
vector form for position and force and the determinant for the cross product. See the 
Mathematical Background for a review of this definition of cross products.

Most problems do not require as extensive a calculation as this equation would indi­

component.

between r and p is negative. The fact that the angle is negative can be easily missed. 
Rather than rely on the sign of the angle, the better way to determine the direction of the

Applications
Now to a few problems with rotating hoops and cylinders using rotational dynamics, 
conservation of energy, and conservation of angular momentum.
12-5  A hoop of mass 1.0 kg and radius 0.25 m is rotating in a horizontal plane with an 
angular momentum of 4.0 kg ⋅ m2/s. A lump of clay of mass 0.20 kg is placed (gently) on 
the hoop. What happens to the angular velocity of the hoop?
Solution: The moment of inertia for a hoop (from the table in your text) is I = mr2.
	
I = 1.0 kg(0.25 m)2 = 0.0625 kg ⋅ m2	
The angular momentum L is Iw, so the initial angular velocity can be calculated from 
L = Iw i
	
4.0 kg ⋅ m2/s = (0.0625 kg ⋅ m2) w i  or  w i = 64 rad/s	

124	
CHAPTER 12
Since the lump of clay is placed (gently) on the hoop (the hoop is rotating in the horizon­
tal plane, and the clay is placed on the hoop vertically), placing the clay only adds mass to 
the hoop. This additional mass adds “another” moment of inertia mr2, so with the angular 
momentum the same (no external torque has acted to change it),

12-6  An amusement park game consists of a paddle wheel arrangement where you shoot 
at the paddles with a pellet gun, thereby turning the wheel. The paddle wheel is set in 
motion with an initial angular momentum of 200 kg ⋅ m2/s and angular frequency of 
4.0 rad/s. You shoot eight 40 g pellets at a speed of 200 m/s at the paddles. The pellets 
hit the paddles at 0.80 m radius, stick, and impart all their momentum to the wheel. Find 
the new angular momentum and the new angular frequency.
Solution: First, calculate the initial moment of inertia of the paddle wheel from L = Iw .
	
200 kg ⋅ m2/s = I(4.0 rad/s)  or  I = 50 kg ⋅ m2	
Fig. 12-4
Now calculate the w after the wheel has absorbed the (momentum in the) eight pellets. 
The angular momentum of each pellet is the linear momentum times the 0.80 m radius.
	
Leach pellet = mvr = 0.040 kg(200 m/s)0.80 m = 6.4 kg ⋅ m2/s	
For eight pellets, the “absorbed” angular momentum is
	
Lall pellets = 51.2 kg ⋅ m2/s	
The new angular momentum is the original plus this, or 251.2 kg ⋅ m2/s.
The I also has increased because of the additional mass at the 0.80 m radius. This “addi­
tional” I is
	
Ipellets = 8 ⋅ 0.040 kg(0.80 m)2 = 0.205 kg ⋅ m2	
The equation for calculating the new angular velocity (L = Iw) is
	
251.2 kg ⋅ m2/s = (50.2 kg ⋅ m2) w f  or  w f  = 5.00 rad/s

cylindrical axis under the influence of a force produced by a 30 kg mass attached to 
a cord wound around the drum. Calculate the torque, moment of inertia, and angular 
acceleration?

The torque on the drum is the tension in the cable times the radius of the drum. This 
tension is much like the tension encountered in the problems of multiple blocks sliding 
on tables, as found in Chapter 5. The system accelerates clockwise, so the unbalanced 
force on M makes it accelerate according to
	
Mg – F = Ma  or  F = M (g – a)	
The torque on the drum makes it angularly accelerate according to rF = 1a.

12-8  When the 30 kg mass in Problem 12-7 has fallen (starting from rest) through 4.0 m, 
what are the linear velocity, angular velocity of the drum, and the time for this to occur?
Solution: This part of the problem is approached from an energy point of view. The 
30 kg mass falls through a distance of 4.0 m . The work performed by gravity Goesinto 
translational kinetic energy of the 30 kg mass and rotational kinetic energy of the 
cylinder. The main difficulty in problems like this is remembering that some of the 
work performed results in rotational kinetic energy and some in translational kinetic 
energy. Thus,

pulley of negligible mass, and is attached to a mass that is allowed to fall under the influ­
ence of gravity. Write a conservation of energy statement for the system.

CHAPTER 13	
EQUILIBRIUM
129
The only difficulty you will encounter in doing equilibrium problems is lack of familiar­
ity with the mechanics of doing the problems. This is overcome by doing problems. The 
theory is simple. If something is not moving—that is, it is in equilibrium—then the sum 
of the forces on it must be zero. Likewise, if it is not rotating, then the sum of the torques 
must be zero.
For problems in two dimensions, these laws are stated very simply:

problems involving torques.
13-1  Hang a 50 kg mass with ropes making angles of 30° and 45°, as shown in Fig. 13-1. 
Calculate the tension in the ropes.
Fig. 13-1
Solution: Note that all the forces come together at the knot in the rope, so draw a force dia­
gram about this point. The only laws to apply are for equilibrium in the x and y directions.

and
	
T2 cos 45° = (215 N)cos 30°  or  T2 = 263 N	
As an exercise, work through this problem with different angles.

the diving board?
Solution: There are no forces in the x direction, but in the y direction the pedestal at 
A and the diver are acting down while the force at pedestal B is acting up. Pedestal B

13-4  Place a 7.0 m uniform 150 N ladder against a frictionless wall at an angle of 75°. 
What are the reaction forces at the ground and wall and the minimum coefficient of fric­
tion of the ground?
Solution: Figure 13-4 shows the ladder with the 150 N acting down at the center of the 
ladder and the sides of the triangle formed by the ladder, wall, and ground. The vector 
portion of the figure shows the two components of the reaction force at the ground. 
The reaction force at the ground is not necessarily in the direction of the ladder. This 
(vector) force can be written in terms of a force (magnitude) at an angle (with horizon­
tal and vertical components) or directly in component form, as done here. Writing the 
force in component form helps to avoid the temptation to place the force at the same 

132	
CHAPTER 13
angle as the ladder. Either way requires two variables. Since the wall is frictionless, the 
reaction at the wall is entirely horizontal. Refer to Fig. 13-4, and write the equilibrium 
conditions.

∑τ = : The torque on the ladder is taken about the point where the ladder contacts 
the ground. Note that this choice eliminates two variables from the torque statement. 
Torque is the (component of the) force at right angles to the lever arm times that lever 
arm. The 150 N weight has a component 150 N(cos75°) times 3.5 m. The reaction at 
the wall has a component RH (cos15°) times 7.0 m, so the sum of the torques equals 
zero statement is 
	 [150 N(cos 75°)] 3.5 m = [RH(cos 15°)] 7.0 m  or  150(0.90) N · m = RH(6.8) N · m	
so
	
RH = (75 N)(cos 75°/cos 15°) = 20 N  and  FH = 20 N	
FV and FH are related via the coefficient of friction FH = mFV, so m = 20/150 = 0.13.
Second Solution: There is another way to calculate the torques. Notice that the 150 N 
force is horizontally 0.90 m away from the pivot point. If the 150 N force vector is moved 
vertically so that its tail is on a horizontal line from the pivot point, then the torque is 
easily written as (150 N)(0.90 m). A similar operation can be performed on RH, yielding 
a torque RH(6.8 m). Vectors maintain their length (magnitude) and orientation (angle) 
but can be moved about a vector diagram for (our) convenience. If the torque statement 
is written in this way, it is identical to the torque statement in the first solution.
	
150 N · 0.90 m = RH(6.8 m)	
As an exercise, redo the problem with a person of known weight positioned a specific 
distance up the ladder.
13-5  Place an 80 N ladder that is 8.0 m long on a floor and against a frictionless roller 
on a 5.0 m high wall. The minimum angle for equilibrium is 70°. Find the coefficient of 
friction between the ladder and the floor.

EQUILIBRIUM	
133
Solution: The roller is free to rotate, so the reaction force is normal to the ladder. This 
reaction force can be viewed as having vertical and horizontal components. The reac­
tion force at the floor is written as vertical and horizontal components. The geometry 
and vector diagram are shown in Fig. 13-5. The length to the roller is obtained from 
the geometry:

13-6  A 20 kg beam 4.0 m long is pivoted at a wall and supported by a cable as shown in 
Fig. 13-6. What is the force at the wall and the tension in the cable?
Solution:  There are two points of possible confusion in this problem. First, the mass of 
the beam is taken as down at the center of the beam. Second, the reaction of the wall, at 
the pivot, has two components, one up the wall (holding the end of the beam up) and one 
out of the wall (keeping the beam from sinking into the wall).

134	
CHAPTER 13
Fig. 13-6
Set up the vector diagram at the pivot and the point where the cable is attached. The 
reaction at the wall is shown with components up the wall and normal to the wall. The 
weight of the beam is shown as down and from the center of the beam with a compo­
nent at a right angle to the beam. The tension in the cable is broken up into vertical and 
horizontal components (for the sum of the forces laws) and a component at right angles 
to the beam (for the sum of the torques laws). Applying the sum of the forces laws 
means looking at the vector diagram and adding up all the vectors in the horizontal or 
vertical directions.

The main points in this problem are the detailed vector diagram and the choice of the wall 
as the pivot point in calculating the torques.
In the early problems, construction of the vector diagram was confined to one point 
where the forces all “came together.” In problems where there is a strut or ladder or 
some other extended object, the common mistake is to miss a force or torque and have 
an incomplete vector diagram.
13-7  Set up a 300 N strut 14 m long with a cable as shown in Fig. 13-7. Find the tension 
in the cable and the reaction force at the pivot.
Solution:  The reaction force at the pivot is set up with vertical and horizontal compo­
nents. The weight of the strut is taken at the center of the strut with the 2,000 N weight 
at the end. The tension is written along with all the components needed to write the force 
and torque equations.

Another feature of equilibrium problems is that an object hung by two cords has its center 
of mass along a vertical line determined by the (extension of) intersection of those cords. 
The argument is based on the fact that a body hung by a cord has its center of mass along 
the extension of that cord. If the center of mass were not on this line, a torque would exist, 
and the body would move. Likewise, if the center of mass were not on the intersection of 
the two cords, a torque would exist and the body would move.

where G is a constant that depends on the units of the m’s, the masses, and r, the distance 
between centers. In SI units, the gravitational constant is G = 6.7 × 10–11 N · m2/kg2. 
The gravitational force acts along the line of centers and is an action-reaction pair. (The 
force on both masses is the same.) Gravitational forces are vectors and superpose (add) 
as vectors.
The gravitational force of attraction for a mass of small (compared to the Earth) radius on

Look at the signs in this expression. If r1 is taken at the surface of the Earth and r2 above

the Earth.
Notice that the general expression for gravitational potential is

(14-3)
The zero of gravitational potential is at r = •. The gravitational potential is negative at 
the surface of the Earth and becomes more negative as we go in toward the center of the 
Earth.
With the gravitational potential energy and the conservation of energy, we can calculate 
the escape velocity. This is the velocity with which we would have to shoot something 
vertically up to completely remove it from the Earth’s gravitational pull.
14-2  Calculate the escape velocity on the surface of the Earth.
Solution: The escape velocity is the minimum velocity for a mass to escape the gravita­
tional attraction of the Earth. Envision a mass being shot vertically up from the surface 
of the Earth, and write the energy statement for it at two levels, the surface of the Earth

CHAPTER 14
Kepler’s Laws
There are three Kepler’s laws that govern planetary motion. Kepler based these laws on 
observations made before the invention of the telescope! They are:
   I.  All planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.
  II.  A line from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal lengths of time 
(Fig. 14-1).
III.  The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of the 
ellipse.
C   Kepler’s second law is consistent with the angular momentum of the motion being 
a constant. Refer to Fig. 14-1. For small angles, the area swept out by the arc is equal to 
the area of a triangle with the side rΔq nearly perpendicular to the sides r. The area of the 
triangle is (1/2)(rΔq)r. In calculus notation, the differential area is dA = (1/2)r2dq, and 
the change in area with time is

The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors is proportional to the area of the trap­
ezoid defined by the vectors (see the Mathematical Background). Here the two vectors 
defining the area swept out are r and v. Rewriting rv as the magnitude of the cross product 
of r and v, or, more conveniently, mv, we get

but r × mv is L, the angular momentum, which is a constant of the motion. Kepler’s 
second law is equivalent to conservation of angular momentum.

Going back to rotational dynamics, dL/dt = r × F, and in planetary motion, the force is 
gravitational and acts along r, so r × F must equal zero, and if the derivative of the angu­
lar momentum is zero, then the angular momentum is a constant.
Equation (14-6) is based on conservation of energy and shows T as proportional to the 
3/2 power of r. This is verification of Kepler’s third law for the case of circular orbits.
14-5  The orbit radius of the satellite of problem 14-4 is 6.8 × 106 m, and the period is 
93 min. The orbit radius of the moon is 3.8 × 108 m, and the period is 27.3 days. Is this 
consistent with Kepler’s third law?

CHAPTER 15	
SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION
145
Simple harmonic motion is the phrase used to describe a repetitive harmonic motion 
such as the motion of a mass oscillating up and down on the end of a spring, the 
rotation of a point moving at constant speed along a circle, or a pendulum in small 
(amplitude) oscillation. The most convenient visualization of an oscillating system is 
the mass-spring system. This is also the one most analyzed. Simple harmonic motion 
is often characterized by the period, the time for one oscillation, and the amplitude, 
the maximum excursion from equilibrium. (Period is the time for one repetition and is 
measured in seconds. while the frequency is the reciprocal of the period and is mea­
sured in hertz or l/s.) More complete analysis usually involves writing statements about 
the total energy of the system.
Fig. 15-1
For a first look at simple harmonic motion, consider the analysis of a mass-spring 
system. The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv2, the energy associated with the moving mass, 
and the potential energy of the system is (1/2)kx2, the energy associated with the elon­
gation and compression of the spring. Here we assume that the spring is a Hook’s law 
spring obeying F = –kx. You may want to review the discussion of the energy stored in a 
Hooke’s law spring in Chapters 7 and 8.
C   To describe the motion of the mass from a force point of view, take the force as –kx 
and equate that to ma, with a written as the second derivative of position.

(15-1)
If you don’t have much experience in calculus, this may look like a formidable equation. 
It is not. It has a very simple and obvious (once you’ve seen it) solution. Acceleration is 
the time derivative of velocity (a = dv/dt), and velocity is the time derivative of displace­
ment (v = dx/dt), as defined in Chapter 1. Acceleration, then, can be written as the second 
derivative of the displacement.

146	
CHAPTER 15
The solution to this equation requires that the second derivative of a function of x with 
respect to time be proportional to the negative of the function. This reduces to the 
question: what function differentiated twice yields the negative of itself? The answer is a 
sine or cosine function or a linear combination of both. If you have not encountered this 
yet, see the table of derivatives in the Mathematical Background.
The derivative of the sine function is the cosine function, and the derivative of the cosine 
function is the negative of the sine function. Two derivatives of the sine function yield 
the negative of itself. This is also true of the cosine function. The solution also can be 
written as the sine or cosine of a constant times t plus a phase angle. A cosw t + B sin w t 
and C(cos or sin)(w t + J ) are equivalent solutions.
Take as a general solution
	
x = A cos w t + B sin w t	
If the starting position (t = 0) is taken as an extreme of the motion, corresponding to 
maximum compression of the spring, then B = 0, and A is the amplitude of the motion. 
If the starting position were taken at the midpoint of the motion, then at t = 0 the ampli­
tude would have to be zero; therefore, A = 0 and B would be the amplitude. (Remember, 
sin 0 = 0 and cos 0 = 1.) The choice of initial condition determines whether the motion is 
described by a sine or cosine function.
Use as a solution x = Bsinw t. Take two time derivatives to obtain

(15-2)
In the statement x = Bsinw t, w is 2p/T. The 2p effectively scales the sine function, and the 
ratio t/T determines the fraction of 2p required for determining the value of the function. 
For example, at t = T (one period), the sine function has gone through one cycle. At t = T/2 
(one-half period), the sine function has gone through one-half cycle. Because of the 2p 
factor, w is called the angular frequency. The term frequency applies to f in the relation
	
w = 2p(1/T ) = 2pf	
(15-3)
In solving problems, be careful to differentiate between frequency f and angular 
frequency w.
15-1  A mass-spring system has a mass of 2.0 kg, a spring with a constant of 3.0 N/m, 
and an amplitude of vibration of 0.10 m. Calculate the angular frequency and frequency. 
Write expressions for the position, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time. Take 
t = 0 at the equilibrium position. Graph position, velocity, and acceleration as a function 
of time.

If t = 0 at the equilibrium position, then the displacement must be given by x = B sin w t.
At t = 0, the sine function is zero, so this is the appropriate function to describe the 
motion. For an amplitude of 0.10 m, this expression should read

At t = 0, the acceleration is zero; the spring is neither elongated nor compressed (at the

Fig. 15-2
These three curves graphed one under the other in Fig. 15-2 give a good picture of the 
motion from the position, velocity, and acceleration point of view.
Look at these graphs, and visualize the motion. At the equilibrium position, displace­
ment is zero, the velocity is a maximum, and acceleration is zero. As the mass moves to 

148	
CHAPTER 15
the positive maximum displacement, the velocity decreases to zero, and the acceleration 
(down) increases to a maximum. At the maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, 
and the acceleration is a maximum. As the mass starts down, the velocity is negative, 
reaching maximum again as the mass passes through equilibrium. Go over this picture 
of the motion until the relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration is clear 
in your mind.
15-2  A piece of metal rests on top of a piston executing simple harmonic motion in the 
vertical plane with an amplitude of 0.20 m. At what frequency will the piece of metal 
“float” at the top of the cycle?
Solution: Take the motion to be described by y = (0.20 m)cosw t.
Two derivatives produce the acceleration a = –(0.20 m)w 2 cosw t. The maximum accel­
eration, which is the constant (0.20 m) w 2, is at the extreme of the motion, where the 
cosine term is 1. At the bottom of the cycle, the piece of metal will experience an accel­
eration greater than g, and at the top, an acceleration less than g. The piece will “float” 
when that acceleration is greater than g.

velocity is 0.20 m/s. Find the frequency, angular frequency, constant of the spring, and 
displacement for this velocity and period.
Solution: The frequency is the reciprocal of the period, or f = 1.0(1/s), and the angular 
frequency is 2pf, or 2p(1/s). The spring constant comes from the relation

15-5  An oscillating mass-spring system has a displacement of 10 cm, a velocity of 
–12 m/s, and an acceleration of –20 m/s2. What is the period of the system?
Solution: Since the displacement is not zero at t = 0, the motion cannot be described with 
a sin w  t function. Since the velocity is not zero at t = 0, the motion in not at an extreme and 
cannot be described with a cos w  t function. Because of the initial conditions, a sine or a 
cosine function of w  t plus a phase angle must be used. It makes no difference whether 
a sine or a cosine function is used because the phase angle can absorb the 90° difference 
between a sine and a cosine function. Look at Fig. 15-4, and go over the logic in this 
paragraph until it is clear in your mind.
Take x = A cos(w  t + J) and then v = – Aw  sin(w  t + J) and a = – Aw 2 cos(w  t + J). Using

CHAPTER 15
Fig. 15-4
Look at these relations and relate them to what the system is doing at t = 0. The amplitude 
is past its maximum positive excursion and on the way down, corresponding to the cosine 
function at 83°. The velocity is negative and heading toward its most negative value, as is 
the negative sine function at 83°. The acceleration is negative and tending toward zero, 
just as is the negative cosine function at 83°.
Energy Analysis
Simple harmonic motion can be analyzed from an energy point of view. The energy 
stored in a spring is kx 2/2, and the energy stored in the mass by virtue of its velocity is 
mv 2/2. A total energy statement for the system then is

which shows that the total energy does not vary over time. The energy does not vary over 
one cycle; it goes back and forth from kinetic to potential in a manner such that the total 
(energy) remains a constant.
15-7  Find the amplitude, angular frequency, and frequency for a mass-spring system 
with a mass of 2.0 kg that is oscillating according to x = (2.0 m)cos(6pt/s). Write and 
graph the expressions for position, velocity, and acceleration. Finally, calculate the total 
energy of the system.
Solution: The amplitude, angular frequency, and frequency are determined by comparing 
x = (2.0 m)cos (6p t/s) to the standard form x = A cos w t = A cos 2pft.
The amplitude is 2.0 m. The angular frequency is 6p(1/s). The frequency is 3(1/s). The 
expressions for position, velocity (first derivative), and acceleration (second derivative) 
are shown in Fig. 15-5 associated with the graphs.
In Fig. 15-5, the units are dropped in the argument of trigonometric functions, and the

15-9  A 0.20 kg block traveling at 20 m/s slides into and sticks to an 0.80 kg block rest­
ing on a frictionless surface and connected to a spring with force constant 80 N/m. What 
is the angular frequency, frequency, and displacement as a function of time? Also, what 
fraction of the original energy in the moving block appears in the system?
Solution: The collision is inelastic; the blocks stick together, so applying conservation 
of momentum, 0.20 kg(20 m/s) = (1.0 kg)V. The velocity of the 1.0 kg combination is 
V = 4.0 m/s. This is the velocity of the system at zero displacement. The analysis of this 
collision is similar to the ballistic pendulum problem in Chapter 10.

Applications
The oscillating simple pendulum can be analyzed in terms of force. For small oscilla­
tions, the tension in the cable can be written in components, one vertical and the other 
the “restoring force,” the force that returns the mass to equilibrium. For small q, cos q ≈1 
and sin q ≈ x/, with x being the displacement, approximately equal to the arc length.
Fig. 15-7

CHAPTER 15
For small angle oscillations F cos q ≈ F and F sin q ≈ –mgx/ = –(mg/)x. Notice that in 
this equation mg/ plays the same role as k in the mass-spring systems.

C   The torsional pendulum, a disk suspended by a thin rod, can be analyzed using 
torque. The disk is rotated by applying a torque. Torque is proportional to the angle in 
the same manner as force is proportional to compression (or elongation) in a spring. 
The torque is written in terms of the moment of inertia and the angular acceleration 
[T = Ia = I(d2q/dt2)], which is set equal to the total torque, – kq the torsional constant

Damped Mass-Spring System
C   The system is usually depicted as a mass-spring with a dashpot, a piston in a thick 
liquid. In the case of the spring, the restoring force is proportional to displacement, com­
pression, or elongation of the spring. With the piston in the fluid, however, the retard­
ing force is proportional to velocity, not position. Move your hand through water and 
notice that the retarding force (the force on your hand) is proportional to velocity! The 
velocity-dependent force component of a typical automobile suspension is called a shock 
absorber. It is usually a piston in a cylinder of oil. Since the retardation force is velocity 
dependent, the differential equation governing the motion is

Notice that the velocity-dependent term has the same sign as the displacement-dependent 
term. It too opposes the motion.

This differential equation is solved with sophisticated techniques. Here we give an intui­
tive solution. 
This second order differential equation is solved as a product of solutions, the position-
dependent part and the velocity-dependent part. The position-dependent part is a sine or 
a cosine function with a phase angle. The velocity-dependent part is from the velocity-

FLUIDS
157
There are several definitions and concepts that are unique to the study of fluids. Let’s 
review these basic definitions and concepts, working some problems along the way.
Density is simply mass per unit volume or, symbolically, r = m/V. The density that is 
most useful in problems is the density of water, which is 1 g/cm3 or 1,000 kg/m3.
The ratio called specific gravity is better called the specific density because it is the ratio 
of the density of another substance to the density of water. Aluminum has a specific 
gravity of 2.7, which means that for the same volumes, aluminum has 2.7 times the mass 
of water. Relative density or specific gravity is used to measure the relative amount of 
sulfuric acid (compared to water) in a storage battery or the relative amount of ethylene 
glycol (compared to water) in an automotive cooling system.
Pressure
The pressure in a fluid is defined as the force per unit area, p = F/A. And the units of 
pressure are N/m2, also called a pascal (or Pa). Atmospheric pressure, the force per unit 
area exerted by the air, is 1.0 × 105 Pa = 15 1b/in2 = 1 atm.
To determine the pressure at any depth in a liquid, consider the differential change in 
force due to a column of liquid of cross section A. The increase in force between the top 
and bottom of this differential piece is equal to the weight of the piece.
It is convenient to write the mass of this little piece as rΔV so that the force 
(difference) is
	
ΔF = rgΔV	
(16-1)
Now ΔV for this piece is AΔy, so ΔF = rgAΔy. The pressure is the force per unit area, so 
rewriting,
	
Δp = ΔF/A = rgΔy	
(16-2)
Dropping the differential notation,
	
pbot – ptop = rg(ybot – ytop)	
(16-3)

158	
CHAPTER 16
Fig. 16-1
If y is measured from the bottom of the liquid, then insert a negative sign on the right side 
of the equation. This discussion of pressure leading up to equation (16-3) is equally valid 
whether the delta or differential notation is used. This is true of most of the discussion 
of fluids. We start with delta notation and switch to differential notation in some later 
development.
16-1  Calculate the pressure at the bottom of a 3.0 m deep pool.
Solution: Δp = rgh = 1,000 kg/m3(9.8 m/s2)3.0 m = 2.9 × 104 Pa
Notice that this pressure is the difference between the top and the bottom. This difference 
is known as the gauge pressure. Adding the atmospheric pressure at the top surface of 
the pool gives the absolute pressure at the bottom of the pool.
The typical automobile tire pressure is the gauge pressure. With the tire inflated, the pres­
sure might read 30 lb/in2. If the tire were “flat,” the pressure would read zero. The gauge 
pressure for the “flat” tire would be zero, but the absolute pressure would be 15 1b/in2. 
Likewise, a tire with a gauge pressure of 30 lb/in2 would have an absolute pressure of 
(30 + 15) lb/in2. The gauge that measures the tire pressure is measuring the difference in 
pressure between inside and outside of the tire.
Pressure exerted on a liquid in a closed container is transmitted throughout the liquid. 
The pressure is the same in every direction, varying only with height, as described by 
equation (16-3). In most devices using fluids to transfer forces, the fluid is nearly incom­
pressible, and height variations are insignificant.
16-2  Consider the classic problem of a hydraulic lift. In a typical service station, l2 atm 
is applied to the small area with the lifting column 9.0 cm in radius. Find the force trans­
ferred to the large area and the mass of vehicle that can be lifted.

A force F1 applied at A1 is multiplied by the ratio of the areas, so

And the equivalent mass (from F = mg) is 3.1 × 103 kg. This number is somewhat larger 
than the mass of typical cars.
Barometer and Manometer
A simple atmospheric air pressure gauge is the mercury barometer. A closed tube is filled 
with mercury and then inverted in a beaker of mercury. The pressure at the top of the 
mercury column is zero. And the column is held up by the (atmospheric) pressure on the 
surface of the mercury. Looking to Fig. 16-3, the pressure at the bottom of the column is 
rgh. This experiment was first done by Torricelli, and the pressure was given as the pres­
sure associated with the column of mercury. Pressures are often measured in millimeters 
of mercury (mmHg) or torr and refer back to this experiment.
Fig. 16-3
An open tube manometer, as depicted in Fig. 16-3, can be used to measure pressure. The 
force exerted by the gas is pA, and this force raises the column of (usually) mercury by 
exerting a force equal to rgV, the weight of the column. The volume of the column V is 
Ah, so equating forces,
	
pA = rgAh  or  p = rgh	
(16-4)
The manometer measures the difference in pressure between two points and, as 
such, measures gauge pressure. The open tube manometer is equally valuable as a 

160	
CHAPTER 16
vacuum gauge. The difference in column height (the height of the mercury in the open 
tube is now lower than in the tube connected to the vacuum chamber) is a measure of 
the vacuum.
Buoyancy
Material objects appear to weigh less when partially or completely submerged in liquids. 
This apparent loss in weight is due to the buoyant force of the liquid. This buoyant force 
is expressed by Archimedes’ principle: a body partially or completely immersed in a 
liquid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the liquid displaced.
16-3  The classic problem in buoyancy is to determine if a “gold” statue is really gold by 
measuring its weight in and out of water. A certain “gold” statue weighs 70 N when out 
of water and 64 N when immersed in water.
Solution: With the statue suspended from a scale, the weight is mg, or density times g, 
times the volume of the statue. In equation form, mg = r?gV = 70 N.
In water the statue weighs less because of the buoyant force: r?gV – rWgV = 64 N. 
Subtracting one equation from the other, we can determine the volume from
	
rWgV = 6 N    1,000 kg/m3(9.8 m/s2)V = 6 N    V = 6.1 × 10–4 m3
With this value for V, calculate the unknown density from the first equation.

This density is much less than the density of gold (rgold = 19 × 103 kg/m3) and closer to 
the density of lead (rlead = 11 × 103 kg/m3), suggesting that the statue is lead with a thin 
covering of gold.
This same experiment can be conducted by lowering the statue into a beaker of water on 
a scale. The volume is determined by the increase in the level of water in the beaker. The 
drop in tension in the cord is offset by the increase in the scale reading when the statue 
is lowered into the beaker, and the calculations proceed as before.
16-4  A U-tube originally containing mercury has water added to one arm to a depth of 
20 cm. What is the pressure at the water-mercury interface? What is the height of the 
mercury column as measured from the water-mercury level?
Solution: Assume that the difference in air pressure can be neglected. The pressure at the 
water-mercury interface is due to the column of water plus the atmospheric pressure po, 
or p = po + rWg · 20 cm. Neglecting po gives the gauge pressure as
	
p = 1,000 kg/m3 (9.8 m/s2)20 × 10–2 m = 1,960 Pa	

fluids	
161
Fig. 16-4
At this level (the level of the interface), the pressure on the mercury arm must be the 
same. (If it were not, the liquids would move!) The height of the mercury level is
1,960 Pa = rM ghM  or

As we expect, the same pressure is produced by a much shorter column of mercury.
Second Solution: Analytically, the problem can be approached by writing expressions 
for the pressure at the level of the water-mercury interface.
In the left arm, pW = po + rWghW, where the subscript W refers to the water column. In the 
right arm, the pressure is pM = po + rMghM, where the subscript M refers to the mercury 
column.
Since these pressures must be equal at the water-mercury interface,
	
rWghW + po = rMghM + po  or  rWhW = rMhM

16-5  A rectangular-shaped open-top steel barge is 10 m by 3.0 m and has sides 1.0 m 
high. The mass of the barge is 8.0 × 103 kg. How much mass can the barge hold if it can 
safely sink 0.75 m?
Solution: The volume of water displaced is length times width times allowed depth; thus 
10 m × 3.0 m × 0.75 m = 22.5 m3. The buoyant force is the weight of the water displaced 
(Archimedes’ principle)
	
FB = rgV = 1,000 kg/m3(9.8 m/s2)22.5 m3 = 2.2 × 105 N	

162	
CHAPTER 16
Fig. 16-5
This buoyant force must support the barge (mB) plus the load (mL).
	
2.2 × 105 N = g(mB + mL),  mB + mL = 22 × 103 kg,  and  mL = 14 × 103 kg	
As an additional exercise, calculate how deep the unloaded barge will sink in the water.
16-6  An iceberg floats in seawater. What percentage of the iceberg is submerged 
(rice = 0.92 × 10–3 kg/m3; rSW = 1.0 × 103 kg/m3)?
Solution: Assume a cubical iceberg of side s. You can assume any shape you wish. 
Cubical, however, seems convenient. The mass of the cubical iceberg is rices3, and the 
weight is rices3g. Since the density of the iceberg is less than the density of the seawater, 
the iceberg will float. The buoyant force of the seawater is rSWg times the volume sub­
merged. Since the iceberg is cubical, the submerged volume must be s2, the area of the 
bottom of the iceberg, times a fraction of the side K times s.
This buoyant force must equal the weight of the iceberg
	
rices3g = rSWgs2(Ks)	
So K, the fraction of the iceberg submerged, is

Fluid Flow
The last, and possibly most important, of the fluid laws is associated with the flow of 
liquids through tubes of varying cross sections. The best place to start on this is with a 
simple statement of mass flow in a pipe of variable thickness.
Fig. 16-6

fluids	
163
Mass flow repuires
 
r1 A1v1dt = r2 A2v2dt	
Density is mass per unit volume, and Avdt = Adx is a differential volume, so the preceding 
equation is a statement that there is the same mass of fluid in the two differential volumes 
shown. Since in most fluids r1 = r2, the mass flow (also called the continuity equation) 
statement reduces to
	
A1v1 = A2v2	
(16-5)
Now look to the Bernoulli equation, which takes account of changes in the gravitational 
potential and pressure. The law is understood from a work-energy point of view. If liquid 
is flowing through a tube as shown in Fig. 16-7, then the work done on the fluid in push­
ing it through the tube must be manifest as increased potential and kinetic energy.
	
dW = dK + dU	
Fig. 16-7
Consider a mass of fluid moving through this tube. The volume of this mass of fluid is
	
dV = A1ds1 = A2ds2	
where the ds’s are the respective distances along the tube necessary to make up the same 
mass of fluid. The work performed on this mass of fluid is (note that the work is force 
pA times distance ds).
	
dW = p1A1ds1 – p2A2ds2 = (p1 – p2)dV	
The change in kinetic energy, basically (1/2)mv2, is dK = (l/2) rdV

CHAPTER 16
This is all the information necessary to do fluid problems as found in most physics texts. 
Buoyancy and pressure problems do not usually present a problem. Calculating pressures 
is sometimes encountered in the context of a flow problem. In flow problems, the usual 
procedure is to first apply the mass flow statement, equation (16-5). Then apply the Bernoulli 
equation. In the application of this equation, it is often necessary to take some of the 
terms as zero. The ability to know when to take a term as zero comes from experience.
Venturi Tube
The venturi tube is used as a siphon or speed indicator. The tube is constructed as shown

that v1 can be taken as zero, you will be stuck. You can move no further on the problem 
because there is not enough data to calculate v1.

To analyze the motion, look at a differential piece of the stream. Set up a right-handed 
coordinate system with origin at the exit hole. This coordinate system is similar to ones 
used in some projectile problems. The differential piece of liquid has initial velocity in 
the +y direction of 6.3 m/s and is acted on by gravity in the +x direction.
The six equations of motion for acceleration, velocity, and position in the x and y 
directions are
	
ax = 9.8 m/s2         ay = 0	
	
vx = (9.8 m/s2)t    vy = 6.3 m/s	
	
x = (4.9 m/s2)t2    y = (6.3 m/s)t	
These are the equations of a parabola or half of a parabola in this case.
The differential piece of water falls 1.0 m, so set x = 1.0 m in the equation for x.
	
1.0 m = (4.9 m/s2)t2  or  t = 0.45 s	
This is the time for the differential piece of the stream to reach the ground.
Then y at t = 0.45 s is

As a side exercise, solve the equation y = 6.3t for t, and substitute into the equation for

TEMPERATURE AND 
CALORIMETRY
167
Temperature and variations in temperature are measured by a variety of physical proper­
ties: volume of a liquid, length of a rod, resistance of a metal, pressure of a gas at constant 
volume, or volume of a gas at constant pressure. Thermometric devices (thermometers) 
are not all linear, though some are linear over a fairly wide range, and it is necessary in 
selecting a thermometer to fit the linearity of the thermometer to the range of tempera­
tures to be measured.
The standard in temperature measurement is the constant volume gas thermometer. An 
ideal gas at low density, usually helium, confined to a constant volume has a linear rela­
tion between temperature and pressure as shown in Fig. 17-1. The dotted portion of the 
line is an extension of the linear relationship. Gas thermometers stop being linear at low 
temperatures because the gas stops being a gas and becomes liquid or solid. Extrapo­
lating the straight line relationship gives an intercept of –273.15°C corresponding to 
zero pressure. Figure 17-1 shows graphs of pressure versus temperature for several 
different gases. These several gases show this linear relationship between pressure and 
temperature, and while the slopes of the lines are different, they all extrapolate to the 
same temperature.
Fig. 17-1
The important point is that while the slopes are different, the relation between pressure 
and temperature is a straight line over a wide range of temperatures, and the lines all 
extrapolate to one specific temperature, which is taken as the absolute zero of tempera­
ture. This temperature is 0 K (Kelvin) or –273.15°C. (The international standard is not 
to use the degree symbol with the Kelvin scale. Popular practice is either way.) The 
reason for this rather odd number (–273.15) is that when the zero on the Celsius scale is 
calibrated with the freezing point of water at standard atmospheric pressure, the absolute 
zero is 273.15 degree units below (this zero). The most accurate calibration point for a 
thermometer is the triple point of water, where the conditions of pressure and tempera­
ture are such that water, ice, and vapor all coexist at the same time.
The Kelvin and Celsius scales have the same size degree. The Fahrenheit scale uses the 
same endpoints for calibration (freezing and vapor points of water), but the scale starts 

168	
CHAPTER 17
at 32 and ends at 212, giving a much smaller degree. Temperature is written as 20°C or 
50°C, while temperature difference is written as 30C°.
17-1  Consider a linear temperature device such as the resistance of a piece of metal. 
If the resistance of the device is 800 W at 20°C and 900 W at 60°C, what is the temperature 
when the device reads 835 W ?
Fig. 17-2
Solution: Figure 17-2 shows the linear relationship of the device. Since the slope is a 
constant, the slope of the graph on the right is equal to the slope of the graph on the left 
(similar triangles), so

In words, this differential equation states that the change over time of the difference in 
temperature is proportional to the difference in temperature. The rate at which something 
cools is directly proportional to the difference in temperature with its surroundings. The 
negative sign is a reminder that the change in ΔT is such as to reduce ΔT. The equation 
is solved by separating

This equation states that the difference in temperature between a hot body and a cold 
body in contact is proportional to the initial difference and a decaying exponential. This 
is very much what we expect from experience. Note that this equation is in the same 
form as other decay equations that describe, for example, the rate of radioactive decay as 
proportional to the amount of decaying product remaining.
17-2  Two objects have an initial temperature difference of 20C°. In two minutes, the 
temperature difference is 18C°. Calculate the time for the temperature difference to be

Solution: This is a classic type of problem where the physical law is known, data are 
given to calculate the specific relationship, and this relationship is used to predict some­
thing. Keep this process in mind as you go through this problem. It is used in the solution

Calorimetry
Heat is a form of energy. The unit of heat is the calorie, the heat to raise 1.0 g of water 
from 14.5°C to 15.5°C. The kilocalorie (or kcal) is also popular. Food calories are actu­
ally kilocalories. The British heat unit is the British Thermal Unit (BTU), the heat to 
raise 1.0 pound of water from 63°F to 64°F. The joule equivalence is 1 cal = 4.2 J.
The quantity of heat necessary to raise the temperature of a mass of material is
	
Q = mcΔT	
(17-5)
where c, the specific heat, is the amount of heat per g ⋅ C° for the material. The specific 
heat for water is 1.0 cal/g ⋅ C°. Tables of specific heats are in most physics texts.
17-6  How much heat is required to raise a 1.8 kg copper tea kettle containing 2.0 kg of 
water from 20°C to 100°C? The specific heat of copper is 0.092 cal/g ⋅ C°.

The specific heat is sometimes expressed in J/kg ⋅ K rather than cal/g ⋅ C°. For the preceding 
problem, the calculations would read
	
Q = [1.8 kg(390 J/kg ⋅ K) + 2.0 kg(4,200 J/kg ⋅ K)]80 K =728,000 J	
Use the calorie to joule equivalence to verify the numbers in this problem.
The quantity of material is sometimes given in moles n. The total mass is related to the 
number of moles via m = nM, where M is the mass per mole of the material. Measuring 
the mass in number of moles, heat capacity would be calculated with the molar heat 
capacity, the heat in joules per mole ⋅ C° or mole . K. (Remember, the Celsius and Kelvin 
degrees are the same size.)
The equilibrium temperature of a mixture can be determined by knowing the quantity of 
heat necessary to affect a change in temperature.
17-7  A 150 g cup of coffee (water) at 80°C has added to it 20 g of sugar (carbon) at 25°C. 
What is the final temperature of the insulated mixture (cc = 0.12 cal/g ⋅ C°)?
Solution: In this problem, heat from the water raises the temperature of the carbon 
until they are both at the same temperature. Saying it simply, this is a Goesinto problem. 

172	
CHAPTER 17
The heat in the water Goesinto heating the carbon until they both reach an equilibrium 
temperature T.
The heat leaving the water is 150 g (1.0 cal/g ⋅ C°)(80 – T)°C. The final temperature is 
between 80 and 25, so writing the temperature difference as 80 – T produces a positive 
number (of calories).
This heat goes to raise the temperature of the carbon.
	
20 g(0.12 cal/g ⋅ C°)(T – 25)°C	
Notice that the temperature difference in parentheses is written so as to produce a posi­
tive number.

or
12,000 – 150T = 2.4T – 60  or  T = 79.1°C
These problems can be complicated with three or more components at different tem­
peratures. If you guess wrong as to where the equilibrium temperature lies, the calcula­
tions will produce a temperature higher or lower than the original temperatures. If this 
occurs, you know that the initial assumption was wrong, so go back with another (better) 
assumption of the equilibrium temperature, and do the problem over again. The main 
problem with calorimetry problems is keeping the algebraic signs correct. These prob­
lems can be done with a positive heat minus negative heat approach, but the Goesinto 
approach cuts down on the number of negative signs and reduces the possible number of 
places where you can get a sign wrong.
Phase Change
If water is heated from room temperature to the vapor point, it takes 1 calorie of heat 
(energy) to raise each gram 1 K degree. When the vapor point is reached, a discrete 
amount of energy is required to convert each gram (or kilogram) of water at 100°C to 
vapor without raising its temperature. This amount of energy is called the heat of vaporiza­
tion and for water is 2.3 × 106 J/kg.
A similar phenomenon is observed when a solid is taken to the liquid phase. The heat of 
fusion, the heat to change 1.0 kg of solid (water) to liquid at 0°C, is 3.3 × 105 J/kg. Tables 
of heats of fusion and vaporization are in most physics texts. Problems involving heat of 
fusion or heat of vaporization must be done carefully because the energy requirements 
for these changes of state are very large. Converting a small amount of ice to water con­
sumes a large amount of energy compared with raising the temperature of the water. 
It takes 4.2 × 103 J/kg for each degree of temperature, while it takes 3.3 × 105 J/kg to 
convert ice to water with no temperature rise!
17-8  An insulated container holds 3.0 kg of water at 25°C. One kilogram of ice at 0°C 
is added to the mixture. What is the final temperature and composition (ice and water) 
of the mixture?

TEMPERATURE AND CALORIMETRY	
173
Solution: First, calculate the energy to bring all the water to 0°C.
Q = 3.0 kg(4,200 J/kg ⋅ K)25 K = 315,000 J
Now ask how much ice could be melted with this amount of energy.
315,000 J = (3.3 × 105 J/kg)m  or  m = 0.95 kg
All the ice will not be melted, so the final mixture will be 3.95 kg of water and 0.05 kg 
of ice all at 0°C. There will be no further heat transfer because both the water and the ice 
are at the same temperature.
17-9  If in the preceding problem the amount of ice is reduced to 0.50 kg, what is the final 
temperature of the composition?
Solution: Based on the preceding calculation, there is not enough ice to lower the 
temperature of the water to 0°C. One way of doing the problem is to calculate the drop 
in temperature of the 3.0 kg of water at 25°C due to the melting ice and then treat the 
problem as a mixture of two amounts of water at different temperatures.
However, since we already know that all the ice melts and the final mixture is between 
0°C and 25°C, the equation for the final temperature can be set up with the statement 
“The energy in the 3.0 kg of water at 25°C Goesinto melting the ice and raising the tem­
perature of the 0°C water,” that is,
        3.0 kg(4,200 J/kg ⋅ C°)(25 – T)°C = 0.50 kg(3.3 × 105 J/kg) 
                               + 0.50 kg(4,200 J/kg ⋅ C°)(T – 0)°C
so
	
315,000 – 12,600T = 165,000 + 2,100T  or  T = 10°C

0°C as shown in Fig. 17-3. What is the heat flow and the temperature of the junction at 
equilibrium (kcu = 380 W/m ⋅ C° and kst = 50 W/m ⋅ C°)?
Solution: The key to this problem is that the heat flow in the two rods must be the same. 
If the heat flow in the copper is greater than the heat flow in the steel, then the joint will 
get hot. This does not happen, so the heat flow must be the same.

the bullet. The block and bullet are initially at 25°C. What is the temperature and speed 
of the block and the speed of the bullet (ccu = 390 J/kg ⋅ C°)?
Solution: First, find the initial kinetic energy of the bullet.
	
KE = (1/2)mv2 = (1/2)5.0 × 10–3  kg(800 m/s)2 = 1,600 J	
Twenty percent of this, or 320 J, goes to heating the copper block.

Thirty percent, or 480 J, goes to kinetic energy of the block.

Fifty percent, or 800 J, stays with the bullet.

CHAPTER 18
KINETICS AND THE IDEAL 
GAS LAWS
A complete description of a gas is given by the pressure, volume, temperature, and 
amount (total mass or number of moles) of the gas. What is called the equation of state 
[Equation (18-1)] describes the relation between p, V, T, and m or n. These four proper­
ties completely describe a gas, just as position, velocity, and acceleration completely 
describe the motion of a particle.
	
pV = nRT	
(18-1)
Early experiments on gases produced Boyle’s law, pV = constant (at constant tempera­
ture); Charles’ law, p = constant · T (at constant volume); and finally, the ideal gas equa­
tion of state, pV = nRT, with n the number of moles and R the gas constant equal to 
2.0 cal/mol · K or 8.3 J/mol · K. A mole of a gas contains a specific number of molecules. 
The number of molecules per mole is Avogadro’s number, NA = 6.0 × 1023 molecules/mole. 
The mass of a mole of gas depends on the atomic weight of the gas. The mole and 
Avogadro’s number are defined as the number of carbon 12 atoms in 12 g of carbon 12. For 
helium (atomic weight 4.0), one mole of the gas contains Avogadro’s number of helium 
atoms and has mass of 4.0 g.

Variation of Pressure with Elevation
C   Consider a slab of air in a column of air, and note that the increase in force between 
the top and bottom of the slab is due to the weight of the slab. Envision this as holding 
your hand horizontally at two different heights. Higher up in the column of air there is 
less air above your hand and thus a lower pressure.

Writing this difference with differentials,

Since p = F/A and dW = rgAdy = rgdV, this statement can be written as
	
p2A = p1A + rgAdy    or    dp = –rgdy	
(18-3)
where dp is the difference, top to bottom, of the slab. The minus sign serves to remind 
us that as we go up in the atmosphere (column), the pressure goes down (there is less air 
in the column).

18-4  What is the pressure at 3,000 m of elevation above the Earth?
Solution: Assume that T = 0°C = 273 K. T decreases with height because the air is 
heated, primarily by radiation from the Earth, so consider this an average temperature 
over the 3,000 m. Air is mostly oxygen and nitrogen and has an average molecular 
weight of 28.8 g/mole or 28.8 × 10–3 kg/mole. The gravitational constant varies only 
slightly over this distance.

CHAPTER 18
pV Diagrams
The pV/T = constant relationship for an ideal gas is depicted in Fig. 18-3 as a collection 
of pV = constant curves for different temperatures. Each line of this family of hyperbolas 
is called an isotherm, a curve of constant temperature. A gas at constant temperature 
has its pV relation defined by these curves. For example, if a gas is expanded at constant 
temperature, the pressure follows the pV isotherm for that temperature.
Fig. 18-3
Kinetic Theory
Thermodynamics is a very neat and compact subject in that the equation of state pV = nRT 
relation can be derived with some simple assumptions and the application of basic force, 
momentum, and energy concepts. The kinetic theory of gases leads directly to the equation 
of state for a gas.
Start with N identical molecules in a cube of volume V and sides d, and make the follow­
ing assumptions and restrictions on their behavior:
1.	 The molecules are small compared with the dimensions of the container and the dis­
tance between molecules.
2.	 Only collisions with the walls are considered; collisions between molecules are 
ignored.
3.	 Collisions with the walls are elastic, and the momentum transferred is manifest as 
pressure on the walls.
4.	 The molecules and the walls are in thermal equilibrium. There is no energy transfer 
between the molecules and the walls.
Fig. 18-4

KINETICS AND THE Ideal GAS LAWS

A molecule with velocity v and components vx, vy, vz makes an elastic collision (momen­
tum conserved) with the x wall. The change in momentum of the molecule is numerically 
equal to the momentum imparted to the wall (Δp)mom = 2mvx.
This is the same expression you would write for a tennis ball bouncing off a wall. The 
subscript identifies this as momentum and not pressure. The time between collisions 
with the same wall is the time for the molecule to go to the opposite wall and return, or 
2d v

Equation (18-7) can be compared to pV = nRT, the equation of state for the gas. 
However, it is more instructive to rework the equation of state. The expression nR 
is the product of the number of moles of the gas and the gas constant, in joules per 
mole-kelvin. The number of moles times the gas constant per mole is the same as the 

182	
CHAPTER 18
number of molecules times a gas constant per molecule. Specifically, nR = Nk, where 
k is the gas constant per molecule as opposed to R, which is the gas constant per mole. 
For one mole, N is NA in nR = Nk, and k is easily calculated. The k is the Boltzmann 
constant of value 1.4 × 10–23 J/K. Writing the equation of state with Nk rather than 
nR produces

A gas molecule acting as a mass point confined to a box is viewed as being able to move

Look back to Equation (18-6) and note that for the specific conditions that the gas and the

Again, looking to Equation (18-6), the pressure for constant volume is proportional to 
(v2)avg, and in Equation (18-9), (v2)avg is proportional to temperature. Pressure being pro­
portional to temperature at constant volume is Charles’ law.

In the preceding section we took the energy in the gas as the translational motion, with

where CV is the molar heat capacity, the heat to raise one mole of the gas one kelvin, The 
units of CV are J/mol · K. It is important to differentiate between the heat capacity for con­
stant volume and for constant pressure. More heat is required to raise the temperature of a 
gas one kelvin at constant pressure than at constant volume because the change in volume 
requires (additional) work to be performed in the expansion. Associating ΔKEtr with ΔQ, 
CV should equal 3R/2. Measurements on monatomic gases verify this relation.
The diatomic gases have additional degrees of freedom. Figure 18-5 illustrates a diatomic 
molecule in translation, then in rotation, first in the x-y plane and then in the x-z plane, 
and finally with the molecule in vibration. The rotation adds two new degrees of freedom, 
and the vibration adds another two degrees of freedom.
Fig. 18-5
Experimental measurements on diatomic molecules show that for low temperatures 
(three translational degrees of freedom only), Cv = 3R/2. As the temperature of the 
gas is increased, the diatomic molecule begins to rotate (adding two more degrees of 

184	
CHAPTER 18
freedom), and the CV climbs to 5R/2. At even higher temperatures, the molecule begins 
to vibrate (adding another two degrees of freedom), and the CV reaches 7R/2. This is 
shown in Fig. 18-6.
Fig. 18-6
At sufficiently high temperatures, diatomic molecules require more heat to raise their 
temperatures one kelvin than do monatomic molecules because diatomic molecules are 
not only translators but also rotators and possibly vibrators. Most diatomic molecules are 
rotators at room temperature.

CHAPTER 19
FIRST LAW OF 
THERMODYNAMICS
The first law of thermodynamics is a conservation of energy statement for thermody­
namic systems that exchange energy with their surroundings. It states that energy cannot 
be created or destroyed but may only be changed from one form to another. The discus­
sion is restricted to ideal gases and systems with constant mass. The quantity of heat Q 
added to the system and the work performed by the system W are taken as positive.
Work during Volume Change
Place a gas in a cylinder with a moveable piston. If the gas is allowed to expand at 
constant temperature, there is a force on the piston F = pA, and this force acting over a 
distance Δx is the work performed by the system.
	
ΔW = FΔx = p(AΔx) = pΔV	
(19-1)
Fig. 19-1
Figure 19-1 shows the cylinder with movable piston and a p-V diagram. The single (p-V) 
curve is an isotherm, a constant temperature curve.
C   In differential notation,
dW = pdV
The total work in expanding from V1 to V2 is the area under the p-V curve from V1 to V2. 
This is analogous to a spring where the work to compress the spring is the area under the 
curve of F versus x (see Chapter 7).

Internal Energy and the First Law
In going from state ( p, V, T ) to state (another p, V, T ), a gas goes through a set of inter­
mediary states. These states are called the path the system takes. On the p-V diagram in 
Fig. 19-2, the point p1V1 represents the initial point and p2V2 the final point.
Fig. 19-2

FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS 	
187
If the gas were taken along the isothermal line, then the work performed would be the 
area under the p-V curve, as shown earlier. Consider, however, two different paths. First, 
the path from 1–3–2 could be accomplished by expanding the gas at constant pressure 
(1–3) and then reducing the pressure to reach p2. In this case, the work performed would 
be the area under the 1–3 line.
A second path from 1–4–2 is accomplished by reducing the pressure to p2 and then expand­
ing the gas to V2. In this case, the work performed would be the area under the 4–2 line.
The work performed by the system in going from state 1 to state 2 via the 1–3–2 route is 
different from the work performed via the 1–4–2 route. Since there are an infinite number 
of possible routes from state 1 to state 2, the amount of work performed in going from 
state 1 to state 2 depends on the path.
Now consider an ideal gas in a container with a movable piston and heat source 
(Fig. 19-3). The gas at p1V1T1 is heated to a state p2V2T1. Heat is added from the reser­
voir to change p and V but not T.
The same amount of gas is placed in another container of volume V2, but the gas is con­
fined to V1 with a breakable partition, and the space above V1 is evacuated. If the partition 
is broken, the gas expands to V2 without a change in temperature and sufficiently rapidly 
that no heat is transferred in the process. This rapid expansion of a gas into a vacuum is 
called free expansion. These two extreme routes are illustrative of the infinite number of 
possible routes, each requiring a different amount of heat, from p1V1T1 to p2V2T1. Therefore, 
the amount of heat necessary to go from one state to another depends on the path.
Fig. 19-3
While the amount of heat to go from one state to another depends on the path and the 
amount of work to go between these two states depends on the path, the difference, heat 
minus work, is independent of the path and always appears as a change in internal energy 
of the gas. In equation form, this is
	
ΔU = Q - W    or    Q = ΔU + W	
(19-5)
This last statement is the first law of thermodynamics and in words states that heat 
into a system appears either as an addition to the total internal energy or work performed 
by the system. Going from one state to another where the temperature of the state is the 
same, the heat in equals the work performed. Going from one state to another where the 
temperature of the state is not the same, the heat equals the increase in internal energy 
plus the work performed.

There are several different thermodynamic processes that occur often enough to warrant 
definition:
• An isothermal process occurs at constant temperature.
• An adiabatic process is one where no heat is transferred in or out of the system (ΔQ = 0).
• An isobaric process occurs at constant pressure (W = pΔV).
• An isochoric process occurs at constant volume (W = 0).
Heat Capacities of Ideal Gases
The heat capacity of an ideal gas depends on whether the measurement is made at con­
stant volume CV or at constant pressure Cp. At constant volume (ΔV = 0), no work is 
performed by the system, so according to the first law, ΔQ = ΔU. For n moles requiring 
CV amount of heat per mole,
ΔQ = ΔU = nCVΔT

FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS 	
189
At constant pressure, work is performed. Defining the heat capacity at constant pressure 
as the heat to raise one mole of a gas one degree,
ΔQ = nCpΔT
Since the gas expands in this process, work ΔW = pΔV is performed. From the ideal 
gas law, pΔV = nRΔT, so ΔW = nRΔT. Substituting in the first law in the form ΔQ = 
ΔU + ΔW, nCpΔT = ΔU + nRΔT. Since the internal energy depends only on temperature,

19-6  What is the total internal energy of 10 moles of an ideal monatomic gas at 20°C?
Solution: A monatomic gas is composed of single atoms that behave as mass points, and 
as such, they can only translate. They cannot rotate or vibrate. See Problem 18-5 and the 
associated discussion to confirm that the internal energy is (3/2)nRT. Thus
U = nRT = (3/2) 10 mol(8.3 J/mol · K)293 K = 3.6 × 104 J
19-7  The heat necessary to raise the temperature of 10 moles of an ideal gas at a constant 
pressure of 1.0 × 105 Pa 10 degrees is 2,100 J. What is the volume change and the heat 
capacity at constant pressure and constant volume?
Solution: The work performed in the volume change is ΔW = pΔV = nRΔT, so

The gas constant R is 8.3 J/mol · K, so

expanding from a volume of 4.7 × 10-3 m3 to 7.0 × 10-3 m3. What is the change in internal 
energy and temperature? What are the specific heats?
Solution: The work performed is 
W = pΔV = 1.0 × 105 N/m2 (2.3 × 10-3 m3) = 230 J
The change in internal energy is from the first law 
ΔU = ΔQ - W = 400 J - 230 J = 170 J

Adiabatic Processes
Adiabatic processes are ones where there is no heat transfer between the system and its 
surroundings. Rapid volume changes where there is no time for heat transfer are charac­
teristic of adiabatic processes.
Fig. 19-4
A model adiabatic process is shown in Fig. 19-4. An ideal gas in an insulated container 
with a movable weighted piston expands rapidly when the weight is removed. The volume 
increases, and the pressure and temperature drop with no heat in or out.
From the first law, ΔU = -W, ΔU = nCVΔT, and W = pΔV. Writing the first law with p

CHAPTER 20
SECOND LAW OF 
THERMODYNAMICS
The first law of thermodynamics deals with heat, work, and internal energy. The second 
law deals with the direction and efficiencies of thermodynamic processes. Many ther­
modynamic processes proceed in one direction but not the reverse. Applying the brakes 
to stop a car is an excellent example of a thermodynamic process (the conversion of 
mechanical energy to heat) that is not reversible.
It is possible to convert mechanical energy into heat with 100 percent efficiency. It is not 
possible to convert heat into mechanical energy with 100 percent efficiency.
Heat Engines
A heat engine is a device that converts thermal energy to other forms (usually mechanical 
or electrical) of energy. The engine takes a working substance through a cycle where heat 
is absorbed from a hot source and expelled to a cold source. The cycle may involve taking 
on or expelling heat, expansion, compression, or a phase change. Figure 20-1 depicts a heat 
engine extracting heat from a hot source, performing work, and expelling heat to the cold 
source. In this engine, the working substance goes through a cycle so that over one cycle 
ΔU = 0. In real engines, such as the typical automobile engine, the working substance is the 
air-fuel mixture continuously supplied to the engine. In this case, the working substance is 
not physically the same but has the same characteristics. According to the first law,
	
W = QH - QC	
(20-1)
The thermal efficiency of an engine is defined as the ratio of the work performed to the 
heat taken in, or

To avoid the confusion of determining the algebraic sign of heat entry or exit of the system, 
the thermal efficiency e is defined with absolute value signs. According to this definition, 
an engine that converted all the heat taken in to work would be 100 percent efficient.

196	
CHAPTER 20
One way of stating the second law of thermodynamics is to say that a heat engine can­
not have an efficiency of 100 percent. In terms of the engine, all the heat taken in cannot 
be converted to work. The first law of thermodynamics says that we cannot get more 
energy out of a thermodynamic system than we put in, and the second law says we cannot 
hope to break even in extracting energy (mechanical or electrical) from heat.

cycle?

20-2  If an automobile engine (gasoline) performs 10 kW of work and is 28 percent effi­
cient, what is the rate at which heat is taken in and expelled?
Solution: It doesn’t matter whether we take the heat in and the work performed for one 
cycle or the rates for heat in and work performed. The efficiency is e = W/QH, so the rate 
of heat in is

Carnot Cycle
The Carnot cycle or engine operates in an ideal reversible cycle between two tempera­
tures. Figure 20-2 shows the two isothermal and two adiabatic paths for the working 
substance. For the cycle to be reversible, the paths have to be reversible. A reversible path 
or process is one that can be made to go backward or forward. The working substance 
following these isotherms and adiabats can be taken in either direction by changing the 
conditions. For example, along the isotherm from A to B, changing the volume slowly 
(in either direction) will make the system move up or down the isotherm.
A similar argument holds for the adiabats.

Eighty percent of this is 43 percent efficiency. This means that 43 percent of the input

Refrigerators and Heat Pumps
Refrigerators and heat pumps perform the same function; they supply mechanical energy 
(work) to an engine that moves heat from a cold place to a hot place. A heat pump has 
as its purpose to heat. The measure of efficiency is called the coefficient of performance 
and is the ratio of heat transferred to mechanical work input. Heat engines take in heat 
in order to perform mechanical work. Refrigerators and heat pumps take in mechanical 
energy in order to move heat from a cold to a hot place (opposite to the normal direction 
of the process). Thus

The theoretical minimum power to move the 20 kW (from cold to hot) is 0.54 kW. Real 
heat pumps require about twice this theoretical minimum power. Notice, however, that 
it takes much less power to “move” heat than it does to heat directly. In this case, about 
1 kW moves 20 kW. Heat pumps are most efficient in mild climates. As the temperature 
difference increases, the coefficient of performance decreases.

CHAPTER 20
Entropy
Entropy is a measure of disorder. Since perfect order or perfect disorder is hard to 
define, the definition of entropy is given in terms of the change in entropy. If a system 
can be taken over a reversible path at constant temperature, then the change in entropy 
is the heat necessary to traverse this path divided by the temperature, regardless of the 
path actually taken. Thus

path, even though the system may have been taken over an irreversible path.

100°C?
Solution: The conversion of water from liquid to vapor is reversible, and the heat required

MECHANICAL WAVES
201
Mechanical waves travel in a medium. The medium and the mechanism for producing 
the wave determine its properties. There are two types of mechanical waves:
• Transverse waves are those where the mechanical motion is perpendicular to the 
direction of the wave. A wave snapped on a rope in tension is a transverse wave: 
pieces of the rope go up and down, and the wave travels along the rope. Waves on 
water are transverse: the water goes up and down, and the wave travels along the

• Longitudinal waves are waves in the direction of the motion. An audio loudspeaker 
creates a varying pressure wave by physically moving the (column of ) air between 
the speaker and your ear.
Waves move with a speed determined primarily by the medium. Waves also transport 
energy.
Transverse Waves on a String
First consider the periodic sinusoidal waves that propagate on a stretched string. If we 
took a “snapshot” (Fig. 21-1) of the wave, we would see a sine wave with amplitude, the 
maximum displacement from equilibrium, and wavelength, the length for one complete 
cycle, or from crest to crest or trough to trough. The velocity of the wave is the wave­
length divided by the time for the wave to pass a point on the string.

This time for the wave to pass a point on the string, or for a piece of the string to execute 
one sine wave, is called the period. The reciprocal of the period is called the frequency.
21-1  The end of a stretched rope is being vibrated up and down at 120 Hz. A “snapshot” 
of the wave indicates a wavelength of 0.50 m. What is the speed of the wave?
Solution: The wave has velocity given by v = l f = 0.50 m(120 Hz) = 60 m/s.

CHAPTER 21
Take a stretched string being vibrated with an amplitude A at a frequency of 10 Hz, or 
period 0.10 s. In this discussion, do not be concerned with how the stretched string is 
terminated. The displacement of the end of the string is
	
y = A sin (2p t/T) = A sin (2p ft) = A sin (wt)	
The displacement is a sine function, and sine functions are periodic in 2p, so when t has 
gone from zero to 0.10 s, the time for one period, the oscillation has gone through one 
(2p ) cycle. One 2p cycle is shown in Fig. 21-1. Writing the argument of the sine function 
as 2p ft is more compact, and replacing 2p f  by w is even more convenient.
From the basic definition of v = x/t, the time for a wave to move a distance is x/v.
The displacement of a piece of the rope at any distance along the rope and at any time is

In many problems, the wave number k = 2p/l is often used, and combining with w = 2pf,
	
y = A sin (wt - kx)	
(21-3)
This equation describes the wave on the string at any particular time. It also describes 
the motion of a piece of the string at any position on the string. The minus sign is for a 
wave moving in the positive direction. A plus sign would be for a wave moving in the 
negative direction.
21-2  A sinusoidal wave is propagated on a string with amplitude 0.050 m, wavelength 
0.20 m, and frequency of 40 Hz. Write an expression for the displacement of the string 
as a function of the time and position on the string.
Solution: The period of the wave is 1/40 s = 0.025 s. The displacement, according to 
Equation (21-2), is

MECHANICAL WAVES	
203
After this 0.0125 s time interval, the point x = 0.010 m oscillates in a sinusoidal manner. 
Look back at the numbers for wavelength and period in Problem 21-2, and notice that it 
takes 1/2 of a period for the wave to travel 1/2 of a wavelength.
21-4  For the situation of Problem 21-2, what is the expression for the space variation of

There are two speeds associated with this description of a wave on a string. The speed 
that the wave moves along the string is called the phase velocity. This is the velocity of 
a crest of the wave as it moves in the positive direction.
C   For a wave traveling at constant speed, the displacement must be a constant as a 
function of space and time, so sin(wt - kx) must equal a constant, and therefore, wt - kx 
must equal a constant. Taking the total derivative of wt - kx yields the phase velocity 
dx/dt. Thus

The speed of the wave along the string is the length of the wave divided by the time for 
one oscillation.
C   The transverse velocity is the up and down velocity of a piece of the string. This 
is ∂y/∂t. We use the ∂ notation rather than the d because it is possible to take derivatives 
of y with respect to both x and t. For a sinusoidal wave described by Equation (21-3),

This derivative shows that the up and down motion of a piece of the string is sinusoidal. 
The maximum velocity (of a piece of the string) occurs at its equilibrium position, where 
cos(wt - kx) = 1, and is equal to Aw.
Wave Equation
C   If the equation for the wave y = A sin(wt - kx) is differentiated twice with respect 
to t and twice with respect to x, a very interesting result is obtained.

which is called the wave equation, a most important equation in physics. Any function 
of x and t that satisfies this relation propagates in the positive x direction with velocity 
v. This analysis is equally valid with longitudinal waves (sound) with the added com­
plication that y describes the displacement of the particle from its equilibrium but in the 
direction of the wave.
Transverse Wave Speed
The speed of a transverse wave on a string depends on the tension and the mass per unit 
length. Common experience is that a wave “snapped” on a string moves faster when the 
string is under greater tension and slower when a heavier (mass per unit length) string 
is used.
Look at the crest of the wave as forming part of a circle, and follow this crest as it 
propagates along the string. Take the arc of the circle as length Δℓ and the string 
of mass per unit length m. Thus the mass of the length Δℓ is mΔℓ. Next, look at the 
forces on this piece of string. The tension in the string F has the components shown 
in Fig. 21-2.
Fig. 21-2
The force on the piece of string Δℓ, directed toward the center of the circle, is 2F sin q.

C   When a stretched string is displaced (plucked), a pulse travels along the string. 
There is a force associated with this displacement. This force acting on an element of the 
string to produce the displacement and return to equilibrium is the work performed on 
the element of string or the energy associated with the pulse. This energy per time is the 
power transported along the string.
Fig. 21-3
In a stretched string, the tension, or force, has longitudinal and transverse components. 
The components of the force are proportional to the slope, as shown in Fig. 21-3. The 
slope is written in the partial derivative notation. (Remember that y is a function of both 
x and t.) Thus

For small displacements the longitudinal component of the tension is the static tension in 
the string (Flong = F, for small displacements). While the pulse is moving along the string 
the transverse force is always opposite the slope of the pulse. The transverse force that 
moves the pulse is opposite (in sign) to the displacement.

CHAPTER 22	
STANDING WAVES (STRINGS 
AND PIPES)
207
A string stretched between two fixed endpoints appears to vibrate in a sinusoidal man­
ner when plucked. Blowing across the top of a partially filled bottle of liquid produces a 
specific frequency sound, with the frequency depending on the length of the air column 
above the liquid. The wave on the string is transverse: the elements of the string move up 
and down while the wave moves back and forth along the string. The wave in the partially 
filled bottle is longitudinal: pulses move up and down the column of air in the same direc­
tion as the wave. These two very different waves can be analyzed in a similar fashion.
Waves on Strings
When a stretched string is plucked, the pattern appears as a sinusoidal standing wave. The 
wave pattern is sinusoidal because the only solution to the wave equation (Chapter 21) is 
a sinusoidal function. The wavelength of the waves is determined by the length between 
the fixed endpoints of the string. A sine wave on a string reflected at a fixed boundary 
produces a standing wave where the fixed length of the string is an integral number 
of half wavelengths. Figure 22-1 depicts the sinusoidal standing waves on strings as 
observed in laboratory experiments with vibrating strings.
Fig. 22-1
Positions on the string where there is no motion are called nodes, and positions where 
there is maximum motion are called antinodes or loops. The standing wave on the string 
is produced by two waves, one moving to the right,

The cos 2pt/T term gives the time dependent motion of a piece of the string at a specific 
value of x. The (2A) sin 2px/l term is the amplitude of the up and down motion of the 
piece of the string at the specific value of x.

208	
CHAPTER 22
Where x is equal to 0 and l / 2, the sin 2px/l term is zero, and the string doesn’t move. 
The allowed wavelengths are determined by requiring x/l to equal 1/2, 1, 3/2, . . . , that is, 
where the sine function is equal to zero. This corresponds to x = l /2, l, 3l / 2, . . . .
For a string fixed at endpoints L distance apart, the allowed wavelengths are then L = 
nl / 2(n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ). Indexing l for the allowed wavelengths,

Remember that for the stretched string, v is a constant equal to

F µ. The first frequency 
(longest wavelength) is called the fundamental and the next frequency the second harmonic 
or first overtone, with subsequent frequencies labeled in a similar manner.
When a stringed musical instrument is plucked, all these allowed frequencies are preva­
lent, though the overtones are of successively lower amplitude. The difference in sound 
of stringed instruments plucked at the same fundamental frequency is due to the design 
of the instrument to enhance or suppress certain of these overtones.
22-1  The third harmonic is excited on a 2.4 m length of stretched string. What are the 
positions of the loops and nodes?
Solution:  To produce the third harmonic, there are two nodes at 0.80 m and 1.6 m so 
as to divide the string into three segments. The loops are halfway between the nodes at 
0.40 m, 1.2 m, and 2.0 m.
Fig. 22-2
22-2  A 0.040-kg string 0.80 m long is stretched and vibrated in a fundamental mode with 
a frequency of 40 Hz. What is the speed (of propagation) of the wave and the tension in 
the string?
Solution:  The relationship v = lf is used to calculate the speed of the wave. Since the 
string is vibrating in fundamental mode, the wavelength is 1.6 m (see Fig. 22-1), so
	
v = lf   = (1.6 m)(40 Hz) = 64 m/s	
Having determined the velocity from this basic relation, the tension can be determined 
from 
/

. The linear density of the string is m = 0.040 kg/0.80 m = 0.050 kg/m, so
T = v2m = (64 m/s)2 0.050 kg/m = 205 N

22-3  For the situation described in Problem 22-2, add that the amplitude (maximum 
displacement from the centerline of the string) is 2.0 mm. What is the displacement at 
0.20 mm, 0.40 mm, and 0.60 mm and the time for one of these oscillations?
Solution:  The oscillation is described in both space and time by Equation (22-1) at x = 
0.20 m. The equation is

The sin p/4 = 0.71 term specifies the fraction of the 2.0 mm (amplitude) of the oscillation 
at x = 0.20 m. This maximum displacement is 1.4 mm. This is the displacement measured 
from the centerline of the string. The height of the envelope or total (up and down) excur­
sion of the piece of string is 2.8 mm.
At x = 0.40 mm, the sine term becomes sin p/2 = 1, and the total excursion is 4.0 mm. 
Because of symmetry, the maximum excursion at 0.60 m is the same as at 0.20 m.
The stretched string goes up and down together, that is, all points on the string are vibrat­
ing with the same frequency of 40 Hz. Thus the time for one oscillation is 1/40 s = 0.025 s.
22-4  One string on a cello is tightened to produce concert A (440 Hz) when the string is not 
touched (shortened by placing a finger on it). The length of the vibrating string is 60 cm and 
mass is 2.0 g. How much must the player shorten the string to play a 660 Hz note ?
Solution:  The tension (velocity) is adjusted so that the frequency is 440 Hz for a wave­
length of 1.2 m. The velocity is
	
v = lf = (1.2 m)(440 Hz) = 528 m/s	
If the tension is not changed, the velocity is not changed so the wavelength to produce 
660 Hz is
	
528 m/s = l · 660 Hz  or  l = 0.80 m	
The length of the string to produce this frequency is one-half a wavelength, or 40 cm. 
The player needs to shorten the string by 20 cm (from 60 cm to 40 cm). This is done by 
pressing the string onto the fingerboard.
Waves in Pipes
If a longitudinal wave is propagated down a gas-filled tube, the wave will be reflected 
at a closed end in much the same manner as the wave on a string is reflected at a rigid 
boundary, thereby setting up standing waves in the tube. Reflection at this end implies no 
motion and a displacement node. If the end of the pipe is open, then this end is a displace­
ment antinode. The air is free to move at an open end. Similarly, a string with an end free 
to vibrate has an antinode at the free end.

210	
CHAPTER 22
The simplest example of a standing wave in a tube is an organ pipe. Air is blown across 
the open end of the organ pipe. The opposite end can be closed or open.
Fig. 22-3
Look first at a closed (at one end) pipe. The open end is a loop (displacement antinode) 
and the closed end a displacement node, so the first fundamental frequency has wave­
length 4 L (see Fig. 22-3). The next allowed wave, the second harmonic, as shown in 
Fig. 22-3, is 4 L/3. The general expression for the wavelengths is

Solution:  The wavelength is determined by the geometry, so look to Fig. 22-3, where

Solution:  The lowest frequency corresponds to the longest wavelength, and the longest

this situation, the wavelength is 20 m, corresponding to a frequency of

Solution:  For an open at both ends pipe, the wavelengths are given by Equation (22-6). 
For successive harmonics (n and n + 1), two equations can be written in the form v = l f

CHAPTER 23	
SOUND
213
Longitudinal waves in air are called sound. The simplest physical picture of sound is a 
thin membrane vibrating (being driven) sinusoidally, with the vibrations being transmit­
ted through the air to another membrane that is set into sinusoidal motion.
Fig. 23-1
Picture the source as an electrically driven speaker and the detector as your ear, which 
detects the vibrations and transmits their frequency and intensity to your brain.
If the sending membrane executes one sinusoidal oscillation, a region of high pressure 
followed by a region of low pressure is propagated through the air to the detector, which 
executes a similar sinusoidal oscillation as the variations in pressure pass by. (Regions 
of low pressure are called rarefactions.) Remember that the individual air molecules or 
slices of air between source and detector move only about an equilibrium position, while 
the pressure-rarefaction pulse moves from source to detector.
Take the source as vibrating according to
	
y = A sin(wt - kx)	
(23-1)
Remember that y is in the same direction as x, and y represents the displacement of a 
narrow slice of air, while x represents the motion of the pulse from source to detector. 
Go over the picture of sound in your mind as a pressure-rarefaction pulse traveling from 
source to detector (see Fig. 23-1) until this last sentence becomes clear to you. When you 
understand this statement you have a good physical image of sound.
The pressure maximum is coincident with the maximum rate of change of y with respect 
to x. The pressure variation, which is proportional to

The ear is very sensitive to pressure variations, capable of detecting pressures of 10–5 Pa, 
which is 10–10 of an atmosphere!
23-1  At some arbitrary position x, graph displacement and pressure as a function of time 
on the same axis, and explain the relationship.

214	
CHAPTER 23
Solution:
Fig. 23-2
Pick a point x where the displacement versus time is a sine curve [Equation (23-1)]. The 
pressure curve [Equation (23-2)] is a cosine curve. Maximum pressure occurs when y is 
moving to the right with maximum speed. This corresponds to maximum positive slope 
or the point t = 0 on the graph. Minimum pressure (a rarefaction) occurs 180° later, where 
the slope of y versus t has its largest negative value.
Intensity and the Inverse Square Law
Sound waves transport energy. Most sound sources radiate spherically symmetric 
patterns, while most detectors intercept only a certain portion (solid angle) of the radi­
ated energy. Therefore, in sound measurements it is convenient to specify intensity, the 
power per unit area, rather than total power.
The power transmitted by a wave on a string is proportional to the square of the ampli­
tude. With techniques similar to those used to determine the power transmitted by a wave 
on a string, the intensity of a sound wave is

intensity is measured.

The Decibel
The human ear is responsive to sound intensities over a wide dynamic range, 1010 or more 
in intensity levels. A person’s perception of “loudness” is that increasing intensity by a 
factor of 10 approximately doubles the perceived loudness. This property of the human 

216	
CHAPTER 23
ear suggests that sound intensity, or level, should be measured with a logarithmic scale. 
The logarithmic decibel scale for measuring loudness is defined as
	
b = (10 dB)log (I/Io)	
(23-7)
where Io = 1.0 × 10-12 W/m2 is the approximate threshold for human hearing.
23-6  Most people experience pain at sound levels above 100 dB. What is the intensity 
associated with 100 dB?
Solution: Equation (23-6) needs to be solved for I, and this requires switching from a 
logarithmic to an exponential equation. See the Mathematical Background for a review 
of logarithmic and exponential equations.
First write b/10 = log(I/Io), and remember that x = log y has the solution y = 10 x. The use 
of “log” implies base 10.
Switch from a logarithmic equation to an exponential one, and write I/Io = 10b/10. For

217
The Doppler Effect
The Doppler effect is the apparent increase or decrease in frequency of a sound source 
when the source and observer are moving toward or away from each other.
Fig. 23-4
First consider a stationary source and a moving observer. In Fig. 23-4, pressure pulses are 
depicted as equally spaced and moving radially out from the source. An observer at rest 
would observe vt/l waves passing in time t (vt is the length of the collection of waves or 
wave train traveling from source to observer, and l is the wavelength, so the quotient is 
the number of waves). The number of waves divided by the time is the frequency f = vt/lt 
resulting in v = l f.
If the observer is moving toward the source with a velocity vo, he will intercept vot/l  more 
waves, and the apparent frequency is

If the observer is moving away from the source, the sign of vot/l is negative. The apparent 
frequency then corresponds to the negative sign in Equation (23-8).
	
f ′= f (1 ± v/vo)	
(23-8)
23-8  What is the apparent frequency of a siren emitting a 300 Hz sinusoidal signal that 
you are approaching at 30 m/s?
Solution: Use Equation (23-8) with the plus sign because you are approaching the source 
and intercepting more waves than if you were stationary.
	
f ′ = 300 Hz(1 + 30/340) = 326 Hz	
23-9  What is the apparent frequency of the siren in Problem 23-8 after you have passed 
it and are moving away?
Solution: When you are moving away, the frequency is lower because you are intercepting 
fewer wave fronts than if you were stationary, so use the minus sign in Equation (23-7).
	
f ′ = 300 Hz(1 - 30/340) = 274 Hz	
Now consider a moving source and a stationary observer. Figure 23-5 depicts the pressure 
pulses as packed closer together in the direction the source is moving. This effectively 
shortens the wavelength to a stationary observer.

heard by an observer (a) on the train, (b) standing beside the track, and (c) on another

Solution:

other submarine? The velocity of sound in water is 1,500 m/s.
Solution: This is a Doppler effect problem with both source and observer moving. The 
hard part of the problem is getting the signs correct. First note that the frequency is higher

charges. Thus

This is the force each charge experiences due to the other. The fact that q1 is positive and 
q2 is negative means that the force is directed from one to the other along the line joining 
their centers.

q3 = 10 mC at 4.0 cm, as shown in Fig. 24-2. What is the force on q3 due to the other two

and find the force on q3 due to the other two.
Fig. 24-3
Solution: This is a more complicated vector problem. First, calculate the force on q3 due 
to q1 and then due to q2. Adding these vector forces is called superposition. The forces 
can be added as vectors as long as the force due to one charge does not affect the force 
due to another charge. In this case, the force on q3 due to q1 does not influence the force 
on q3 due to q2.

and is directed as shown. Referring to Fig. 24-3, the x and y components of the resultant 
force can be written. The x component of these two forces is
	
Fx = F31 cos 60° + F32 cos 60° = (0.0112 + 0.0169) N = 0.0281 N	
The y component of these two forces is
	
Fy = F31 sin60° - F32 sin 60° = (0.0195 - 0.0292) N = 0.0097 N	
Second Solution: Using unit vector notation the forces are written as
	
F31 = F31 cos 60°i + F31 sin 60° j = (0.0112i + 0.0195 j ) N	
	
F32 = F32 cos 60°i – F32 sin 60° j = (0.0169i - 0.0292 j ) N	
and combine to give
	
F3 = (0.0281i - 0.0097 j ) N	
Rather than worry about the algebraic signs of angles other than 0° to 90°, draw the 
picture and keep the angles under 90°. This way it is easy to “see” the sign of the various 
components. Most mistakes in problems like this are algebraic sign mistakes. The way to 
avoid these mistakes is to draw and label a vector diagram, more than one if necessary.
As an exercise, find the magnitude and direction of the resultant.
A classic charge problem is one where charged balls are hung by strings from a common 
point with the question being how far apart the balls separate for a given equal charge.
24-4  Consider two conducting balls both of mass m and equal charge q suspended by 
nonconducting cords of equal length ℓ, as shown in Fig 24-4. How does the separation of 
the balls depend on charge, mass, and length?
Fig. 24-4
Solution: The arrangement is shown in the figure along with the vector diagram. This 
is a force balance problem. The mechanical force is due to gravity and is directed down. 
The electrical force is the coulomb force and is directed along the line of centers of the 
conducting balls, which for this geometry is horizontal.

CHAPTER 24
On the vector diagram, the mg force is balanced by the vertical component of the ten­

THE ELECTRIC FIELD
225
The electric field is defined as the force per unit charge E = F/qo and as such is a vector. 
Electric fields can be superposed—added as vectors. The units of the electric field are 
newtons per coulomb or volts per meter. In terms of charges, an electric field has magnitude

Discrete Charges
A classic problem that illustrates the vector nature of electric fields is calculation of the 
E field on the axis of a dipole.
25-1  An electric dipole is depicted as equal and opposite charges separated by a distance 
2a, as shown in Fig. 25-1. Find the electric field at a distance r along the bisector of the 
centerline of the charges.
Fig. 25-1
Solution: First, draw the diagram and note the direction of the electric field vectors. The 
horizontal components of E1 and E2 add to zero. The vertical component is made up of 
two vectors of equal magnitude E1 cosq. The magnitude of the vertical vector is 2E1 cosq.

and for large distances, the field falls off as 1/r 3. The product 2aq is called the dipole 
moment p = 2aq. It is interesting to note that for a point charge the E field is radial (in 
or out) and falls off as 1/r  2, while for the dipole E it is tangential to the radius and falls 
off as 1/r  3.
25-2  Calculate the electric field due to two charges q1 = 4.0 × 10-6 C and q2 = -3.0 × 10–6 C

E2 = (0i + –3.0 × 103 j ) N/C

As an exercise, verify that in number plus angle form this vector is ER = 2.1 × 103 ∠-49° N/C.
25-3  Find an expression for the electric field due to a collection of charges of equal 
magnitude all placed in a line and separated by a distance d. The charges have alternate 
signs, and the field to be calculated is the field on a line normal to the line of charges and 
opposite the central positive charge. Additionally, look for approximate expressions for 
long distances away from the line of charges.

Look at the geometry associated with E2, and notice that this vector can be written in 
terms of a horizontal and a vertical component. The vector E4 also has vertical and 
horizontal components. The vertical components of E2 and E4 add to zero, while the 
horizontal components add along r. The same is true of vectors E3 and E5. The horizontal 
component of E2 is E2 times the cosine of the angle q ; thus the contribution of E2 and E4 
is two times the magnitude of E2 times the cosine of the angle q.

CHAPTER 25
Linear Charge
So far we have looked at the electric fields that result from discrete charges. If the charges 
are spread out, such as over a surface, then the definition of electric field has to be modi­
fied to a calculus definition where the contribution of each element of charge to the total 
field is summed.

C   25-4  A problem that illustrates this is calculation of the electric field on the axis 
of a ring of positive charge. Set up the problem as shown in Fig. 25-4.
Solution: Each element of charge dq produces an element of electric field dE at a point 
on the bisector of a diameter of the ring. This dE has components dE cosq along the direc­
tion of the bisector and dE sin q perpendicular to the bisector. An element of dq at one 
spot on the ring produces dE sin q and across the diameter of the ring a similar element 
(of dq) produces a dE sin q component that cancels this one. Because of this symmetry, 
the dE sin q components add to zero.

THE ELECTRIC FIELD	
229
Surface Charge
C   25-5  Calculate the electric field vertically out from a uniformly charged disk of 
radius R and charge density (charge/area) s.
Solution: The calculus definition of the electric field is that each element of charge pro­
duces an element of electric field according to Equation (25-4), where r is the distance 
from the element to the point where dE is calculated. Because of the symmetry of the 
problem, the dE is produced by a dq in the form of a ring of charge of radius r and width 
dr. Refer to Fig. 25-5, and note that the dE produced by this ring of charge is a cone with 
horizontal components adding to zero. A piece of the ring producing a piece of dE has a 
corresponding piece across a diameter. The horizontal components of these correspond­
ing pieces add to zero. The vertical component is dE cos q, with cos q determined from 
the geometry as

CHAPTER 25
Applications
25-6  Consider an electron ballistics problem where an electron is projected between two 
plates (as shown in Fig. 25-6) at an initial velocity of 6.0 × 106 m/s and angle of 45°. The 
electric field is 2.0 × 103 N/C and directed up. The length of the plates is 10 cm with a 
separation of 2.0 cm. Will the electron strike the plates? And if so, where?
Fig. 25-6
Solution: This is a projectile problem. Look through Chapter 4, and refresh your memory 
on the general approach to projectile motion problems before continuing with this problem. 
The electronic charge and mass are given on the constants page at the back of this book.
First, calculate the acceleration. The force on the electron comes from the electric field, 
F = eE, and this force makes the electron accelerate, leading to a = eE/m. Using the values 
for e and m for the electron,

The electric field is directed up, which would be the direction of acceleration of a positive 
charge. For the negatively charged electron, the acceleration is down. Using this logic 
argument to determine the direction of the acceleration is easier than carrying minus 
signs throughout the problem.
The most convenient origin for the coordinate system is the edge of the plate where the 
initial velocity and direction are known with x positive to the right and y positive up. Now 
write the six equations describing the motion.

The smallest time is taken because this corresponds to the electron striking the top plate. 
If the solution for t had contained an imaginary number, this would have indicated that 
the electron would never reach the top plate.
Now, with this time, calculate the position in x where the electron strikes the plate.

Dipoles
A dipole placed in an electric field experiences a torque. The dipole moment, defined 
earlier as p = 2aq, can be expanded to define the dipole moment vector of magnitude 
2aq pointing from -q to +q. The force on each charge is qE, and they add to zero, so the 
dipole does not translate.
Fig. 25-7
It does, however, rotate due to the torque of magnitude 2aF sin q. When q = 0 and the 
dipole is lined up with the field, the torque is zero. But when q = 90°, the torque is 2aF. 
Multiply the torque by q/q to obtain

CHAPTER 26	
GAUSS’ LAW
233
Gauss’ law can be tricky. The concepts expressed in mathematical terms often imply 
considerable mathematical sophistication to work the problems. This is almost always 
not the case. In general, if you are involved in excessive mathematical manipulations, 
you are doing the problem wrong or do not see an easy way to apply Gauss’ law. Remem­
ber that Gauss’ law represents the density of f lux lines through an area. Remember also 
that most of the difficult looking integrals never occur.
Start with a definition of f lux as
	
d
E
E
s
∫
Φ =
⋅
	
(26-1)
This states that the flux is the sum of the vector (dot) product of electric field over a sur­
face times the area. E represents the electric field, and ds is a vector normal to the surface 
representing a differential element of the surface. The dot product is the component of 
E parallel to ds, that is, normal to the surface, times ds. If E is a constant (most often the 
case), then the sum of (integral of) E · ds over the surface is the component of E normal 
to the surface area times the total surface area.
C   26-1  Calculate the flux through a square plate 1.0 m on a side inclined at 120° 
with respect to a constant electric field of 100 N/C. You may at this point want to 
review the definition of dot product in Chapter 1 and the concept of the integral in the 
Mathematical Background.
Fig. 26-1
Solution: The surface area ds is represented by a vector normal to the surface. The vector 
product E · ds is Eds(cos 30°). Integrating this product,

This represents the flux through the surface.
The construct (concept) “flux” can be thought of as a collection of lines intercepting this 
square plate. If the electric field is increased, then there are more “flux lines” per square 
meter, and if the angle is changed, more or fewer flux lines are intercepted as the angle 
is changed.
This integral of a vector product, which sounds like a very difficult problem, is performed 
rather easily with an understanding of dot products and integrals.

234	
CHAPTER 26
Electric field lines are a convenient concept or construct to help us visualize 
the electric field. The electric field lines are envisioned as vectors going from posi­
tive charges to negative charges, the direction a unit positive charge would move. The 
electric field lines between two oppositely charged plates are just lines going from 
one plate to another. Higher fields would be envisioned as more lines or more lines 
per cross-sectional area.
In the case of a sphere surrounding a unit positive charge, the field lines would be pointing 
radially out, the direction a unit positive charge would move. On spheres with different 
radii, the electric field would be different; the field line density (number per square 
meter) would be different. However, if we could sum all the electric field lines over the 
different spheres, we would find the same number of lines. Their number density would 
decrease as the radii were increased, but the total number over a sphere would remain 
the same.

corresponding to the point where the field is required, so in this region E points inward 
and has value E = q/2peor.

238	
CHAPTER 26
Note that the electric field at a point between the cylinders is only due to the charge 
enclosed by the Gaussian surface. Because of the symmetry of the problem, the charge 
on the outer cylinder produces no net electric field at any point inside the outer cylinder.
Fig. 26-7
Outside the outer cylinder, the E field points inward because the net charge contained is 
negative, and at any point r (outside the outer cylinder) measured from the centerline of 
the two cylinders, E = q/2peorℓ.
With this particular arrangement of charge, the field has the same algebraic form between 
the cylinders and outside the outer cylinder but points outward between the cylinders and 
inward outside the outer cylinder.

	
CHAPTER 27	
ELECTRIC POTENTIAL
239
In mechanics, the use of force to analyze problems works well when the force is a con­
stant. When the force depends on position, then the concepts of work and energy are 
introduced, with work defined as the summation, or integral, of force over distance.
In electricity, potential is introduced for similar reasons. While the electric field is a con­
stant in many problems, it is not a constant, say, in the vicinity of a point charge except 
on a sphere surrounding that (central) charge. Any motion of charges due to electric force 
that is not on the surface of the sphere surrounding a central charge has to take account 
of this nonconstancy of the field or force (field is force per charge).
The electric potential or potential difference between two points A and B is defined as 
the work per unit charge necessary to move the unit charge from A to B.

The units of potential are joules per coulomb or volt. Usually one point (A) is taken at 
infinity, where VA = 0. This is convenient and correct because the force on the unit charge 
at infinity (see Coulomb’s law) is zero.

lating WAB for a charge qo being brought from infinity to the vicinity of q. This integral is

Be careful of the signs here; if q and qo are positive, the force is repulsive, and if qo is 
coming from infinity to rB, then F · dr is negative. With this definition, the potential, or 
work per unit charge, at any point r radially out from q is

a most convenient definition.
For a constant electric field, such as between two parallel plates, WAB = Fd = qoEd and 
VB - VA = WAB /qo = Ed, where d is the distance moved (in the direction of the field).

CHAPTER 27
27-1  In a certain experiment, an electric field of 2.0 × 105 N/C is required for parallel 
plates separated by 0.0020 m. What voltage will produce this field?
Solution: For a constant field, V = Ed, so
	
V = 2.0 × 105 N/C · 2.0 × 10–3 m = 4.0 × 102 J/C = 400 V

a charge of 5.0 × 10–6 C were moved from a radius of 0.50 m to a radius of 0.20 m, how 
much work would be performed?
Solution: The work performed is the potential difference in joules per coulomb (or volt) 
times the charge in coulombs (observe the units carefully).
	
W = 2.9 × 104 J/C · 5.0 × 10–6 C = 0.15 J	
The work is independent of the path between these radii. This is the great value of potential 
calculations.

A long way away from the collection of charges, the collection looks like one positive 
charge. A classic problem is calculation of the potential at a point a distance r and at an 
angle q from the center of a dipole. The potential is written by summing the potential from 
the two charges and using the approximate trigonometric relation between r, r1, and r2 .

Solution: The positron will approach the proton until the energy of the positron is

then exit the vicinity of the proton having a velocity profile on exit the same as but in the

This is a very close approach, being two orders of magnitude smaller than the distance 
from the nucleus to the first electron orbit radius in the hydrogen atom.
Second Solution: This problem can be done using the concept of the electronvolt (eV) 
unit of energy. An electron accelerated through one volt has an amount of work per­
formed on it equal to one volt (the work per unit charge) times the charge on the electron.
	
1 eV = (1 J/C) 1.6 × 10-19 C = 1.6 × 10-19 J	
This equation defines the joule-electronvolt equivalence. An electron accelerated through 
a potential difference of one volt is said to gain one electronvolt in energy. An electron 
accelerated through 1,000 volts would gain 1,000 eV in energy. An alpha particle (two 
positive electronic charges) accelerated through 1,000 volts would gain 2,000 eV in energy.

energy of

Another application of the concept of potential is to calculate the amount of work required 
to place charges in an array.
27-13  Calculate the work required to arrange the charges as shown in Fig. 27-7. In this 
problem, the subscripts on the q’s represent the position of the charges.

a coordinate system), and calculate the work necessary to place q1 in position. This is

A long way away a disk of charge “looks like” a point charge. The use of the binomial 
expansion is helpful in two ways. First, it allows a convenient calculation for the situation 
where b/a << 1, and second, the limiting case reduces to the simple expression for the 
potential due to a point charge, in effect verifying the calculation.

CHAPTER 28	
CAPACITANCE
249
A capacitor is a geometric arrangement of conducting plates where charge can be stored. 
The capacitance is a measure of the charge that can be stored per volt. The unit of capaci­
tance, the farad, is defined as a coulomb per volt. The defining equation for capacitance 
is C = q/V.
The simplest capacitor is two parallel plates of area A and separation d (Fig. 28-1).
Fig. 28-1
The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor determines the amount of charge that can be 
stored on the plates. A battery connected to the plates will place charge on the plates. For 
this discussion, the battery can be viewed as a source of charge (or charge pump), with 
the amount of charge delivered to the plates determined by the voltage of the battery. 
Remember that the voltage of the battery is a measure of the amount of work that can be 
performed on a unit of charge.
When the battery is connected to the plates, we say that positive charge begins to flow 
onto the positive plate and negative charge onto the negative plate. The first “piece of 
charge” distributes uniformly over the plate. The positive and negative charges arrange 
themselves on the plates opposite one another. As more charge is pumped onto the plates, 
the work necessary to place each new “piece of charge” on the plate increases because of the 
mutual repulsion of the charges already on the plate. Thus the capacity of the device to 
store charge is directly proportional to the plate area.
The limitation on capacity imposed by the mutual repulsion of like charges on one plate 
is offset by opposite charges on the other plate. As the distance between the plates is 
reduced, the attraction between unlike charges makes it easier, in terms of work per­
formed by the battery, to place charge on the plates, and the capacity of the device is 
increased. Thus capacitance is inversely proportional to the separation of the plates.
The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is directly proportional to the plate area and 
inversely proportional to the separation, with a constant added to make the units work 
out correctly.

For the parallel plate capacitor, charge the plates with a battery so that one plate con­
tains positive charge and the other negative charge. The charges will arrange themselves 
so that they are on the insides of the plates opposite one other (unlike charges attract). 
Construct a Gaussian surface surrounding one plate. The E field exists only between the 
plates and is constant over the Gaussian surface. Applying Gauss’ law

E is a constant over the Gaussian surface, so the integral of E over this surface is just 
E times A, the surface area. This is another case of an integral that can be evaluated by 
looking at it and writing down the answer. In this geometry, the relationship between

Capacitors as Lumped Circuit Elements
Capacitors are used in electric circuits, so it is necessary to know how capacitors add 
when used in series and parallel. First, look at three capacitors placed in series.
Fig. 28-4
The applied voltage is distributed between the three capacitors, so V = VI + V2 + V3. Since 
there is no way to add charge except to the end plates, those connected directly to the 
battery, the charge contained within the Gaussian surface must total zero. The right plate 
of C1 has equal but opposite charge to the left plate of C2. Another Gaussian surface sur­
rounding C1 also must have total charge zero, so the charges on the plates of C1 are equal 
and opposite. Proceeding in this manner, the magnitude of the charge on all the plates 
is the same. Rewriting the equation for the voltage using the definition of capacitance,

Capacitors placed in parallel add linearly. Look at the expression for C for a parallel

capacitor. Therefore, capacitors placed in parallel add linearly.
	
C = C1 + C2 + C3 + …    C’s in parallel	
(28-5)
28-4  A 6.0 mF capacitor and an 8.0 mF capacitor are connected in series. A potential of 
200 V is placed across them. Find the charge and potential on each.

CAPACITANCE

Fig. 28-5
Solution: The circuit is as shown in Fig. 28-5. Since the capacitors are in series, the 
charge on each capacitor is the same. The equivalent capacitance is found from

28-5  A 12 mF capacitor and a 10 mF capacitor are connected in parallel across a 100 V 
battery. Find the charge and potential on each capacitor.

same, 100 V. The charge, however, depends on the capacitance.

equivalent circuits. Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 28-7 that has parallel and series

Now combine C3 and C4 to C5 = C3 + C4 = 4.4 mF + 6.0 mF = 10.4 mF, allowing construc­
tion of the final (simplest) equivalent circuit (Fig. 28-8).
Fig. 28-8
Now calculate the total charge qt = C5V = 10.4 mF · 300 V = 3.1 × 10-3 C. The charge on 
C3 is q3 = C3V = 6.0 mF · 300 V = 1.8 × 10-3 C.
The remaining charge is 1.3 × 10-3 C, and this is the charge on each of the other capaci­
tors, C1 and C2. Remember that the charge on capacitors in series is the same. The voltage 
on each of these capacitors is

28-7  Charge a 12 mF capacitor with a 200 V source, then place this capacitor in parallel 
with an uncharged 7.0 mF capacitor, and calculate the “new” voltage.
Fig. 28-9

CAPACITANCE	
255
Solution: The 12 mF capacitor initially placed on the 200 V source has a charge of
	
q = CV = 12mF · 200 V = 2.4 × 10-3 C	
When connected to the 7.0 mF capacitor, the charge distributes so that the total charge 
remains the same and the “new” voltages are equal, as they must be for capacitors 
in parallel. Take Q as the amount of charge that moves from the 12 mF capacitor to the 
7.0 mF capacitor. The voltages as expressed by the ratio of q to C must be equal, so write

connected to the 7.0 mF capacitor, and look at the question of energy.
Solution: The 12 mF capacitor at 200 V has a stored energy of
	
U = (1/2)CV2 = (1/2)12mF · 40,000 V2 = 0.24 J	
NOTE:  The units of energy are FV2 = [(C/V)(J/C)2] = J.

the two capacitors is

CHAPTER 28
Capacitors and Dielectrics
Dielectrics are most conveniently thought of as materials containing dipoles that are 
“loose” and can line up with an applied electric field. The easiest way to understand 
dielectrics is to approach them experimentally. Using a parallel plate capacitor as a 
model, observe experimentally that the amount of charge per unit voltage increases with 
the insertion of various dielectric materials. The easiest way to explain this is to say that 
C = eoA/d is changed by a factor k, so C = keoA/d, with this k called the dielectric con­
stant, a measure of the amount by which the capacity of a capacitor is increased due to 
a particular dielectric.
The mechanism of increasing the capacitance can be thought of as the dipoles lining up 
across the separation d with the positive end of the string effectively neutralizing some 
of the negative charge on the plate and the negative end of the string doing the same to 
the other plate. The effect of these positive charges in the vicinity of the negative plate 
allows the negative plate to be negatively charged more easily (with less work), leading 
to a greater capacity of the device in the presence of the dielectric.
Fig. 28-10
Consider another experiment with dielectrics. Connect a battery in parallel with identi­
cally sized parallel plate capacitors except that one has a dielectric and the other does 
not. For the one without the dielectric, C = eo A/d, and for the one with the dielectric, 
C = keo A/d. Since q = CV, to carry the same charge, the capacitor with the dielectric 
would have to have V reduced to Vo /k and likewise E to Eo /k. Finally, looking at the 
energy density for capacitors with dielectrics,

CHAPTER 29	
CURRENT AND RESISTANCE
259
Electric conductivity is most conveniently thought of as motion by essentially “free” 
electrons, electrons not bound to atoms. The actual mechanism is more complicated, but 
this simple view is sufficient to understand conductivity in metals. In the absence of an 
electric field, these free electrons are moving in random patterns with a mean free speed v. 
They regularly crash into ion cores (metal ions with the conduction electron(s) missing) 
then move off again with this same mean free speed.
Electric conduction comes about because an electric field is impressed on the metal, 
which slightly modifies this random motion of the electrons, giving them a drift veloc­
ity in the direction opposite to the field. Figure 29-1 shows the effect of an electric field 
(dashed lines) on the random motion of a conduction electron in a metal subject to an 
electric field.
Fig. 29-1
The mean free speed is the speed of the electrons, as determined by the temperature of 
the metal, and the drift velocity is due to the electric field. This drift velocity is small 
compared to the mean free speed. The motion of the electron charge carriers is character­
ized by the drift velocity, the mean free path (the distance between collisions), and the 
relaxation time (the time between collisions). The drift velocity depends on the applied 
field. The mean free path and the relaxation time are characteristics of the metal and the 
physical condition of the metal (temperature, pressure, etc.).
Current
Consider a wire, containing charge, under the influence of an electric field. On a plane 
through the wire (perpendicular to the charge motion), an amount of charge will pass per 
unit of time. This is called the current

CHAPTER 29
The current direction is the direction a unit positive charge would move in the field. 
Despite the charge being carried by electrons, current is viewed as the motion of positive

The “free” charge carriers in a conductor experience an electric field when a voltage is 
applied and this field produces an acceleration a = eE/m, the electric force divided by the 
mass. The charge carriers accelerate until they crash into an ion core; then the process 
of accelerate and crash begins again. The characteristic time between collisions, which 
is dictated by the mean free speed, is called the relaxation time. The acceleration times 
the relaxation time produces the drift velocity.

This expression for resistivity is consistent with Ohm’s law. Resistance (and resistivity) 
is a constant provided the applied field does not change the time between collisions. 
Remember, the time between collisions is a property of the material and is not apprecia­
bly affected by the applied electric field.

with a relaxation time of 3.0 × 10–14  s. Apply 4.0 V for a current of 3.0 A. Calculate 
resistivity, electrons per second passing a cross section, current density, the acceleration

Power
C   In electric circuits, energy is transferred when charge moves under the influence 
of voltage. Since voltage is work/charge, the energy involved in moving an amount of 
charge under the influence of voltage is the voltage times the charge. In differential form,
	
dU = Vdq = Vidt	
(29-6)
Power (work/time) dU/dt is P = Vi.
In a circuit where V, i, and R are related by V = iR, this power can be written

VA = (J/C) (C/s) = J/s = W.

C   29-9  For the situation of Problem 29-8, if the voltage is reduced to 110 V (assume 
no change in resistance), how does the heat output change?
Solution: This is best handled with a variational equation. In this case, start with P = V2/R, 
and ask how does P change with V while R remains constant. The left side becomes ΔP, 
and the right side becomes (1/R) times the differential of V2. Writing in delta format,

where a is the temperature coefficient of resistance. This increase in resistance is consis­
tent with our view of electric conductivity as charge carriers moving under the influence 
of an electric field until they crash into much larger ion cores.
As a metal is heated, energy goes into vibration of the ion cores. Charge carriers moving 
through the metal have a greater chance of intercepting an ion core as the amplitude of 
the oscillations increases. More collisions means greater resistance.
As an analogue, consider the problem of walking blindfolded across a room with all the 
same size people standing in a random pattern in the room. The number of times you 
collide with another person depends on the relative cross sections (areas) of you and the 
people standing in the room. If the people are put into oscillation perpendicular to your 
direction of motion, the probability of collision becomes greater. In the time it takes for 
you to move past each person, he or she moves, increasing the probability of collision. 
The people have a greater effective cross section with respect to your walking across the 
room because of their motion.
29-10  Calculate the resistance of an iron bar when the temperature is raised from 0°C 
to 100°C. The initial resistance is 1.43 W, and the temperature coefficient of resistivity 
is 0.00501/C°.
Solution:
	
R = Ro [1 + a (T - To)] = 1.43 Ω [1 + 0.00501/C°(100C°)] = 2.16 Ω	
Batteries and emf
Batteries can be viewed (loosely) as charge pumps. Work is performed on charge as 
it moves through the battery, effectively raising its potential (energy). This potential 
energy is expended when a path (circuit) is provided for the charge to travel outside the 
battery. The ability of the battery to do work on the charge passing through it is called 
the electromotive force (emf ). The electromotive force is measured in volts. A 10 volt 
battery can perform 10 joules of work on each coulomb of charge passing through it and 
is said to have an emf of 10 V.
A battery connected to a load with resistance R causes current to flow in the load accord­
ing to the relation V = iR. For an amount of charge flowing through the load, the drop in 
potential (voltage) is the same as the gain in potential (voltage) in the battery. This is a 

Current and Resistance	
265
conservation of energy statement: the charge does not go faster and faster as it moves 
around the circuit; neither does it go slower and slower; it moves at a rate dictated by V = iR.
Real batteries have internal resistance. Batteries viewed as charge pumps have resistance 
associated with moving the charge through the battery. The no load (no current) voltage 
at the terminals of the battery is the emf of the battery. As current is supplied by the bat­
tery, the internal resistance lowers the voltage at the terminals. In circuits, batteries are 
usually depicted as a voltage source in series with a resistor.
29-11  A battery with an emf of 10 V has internal resistance of 0.70 Ω. What is the volt­
age at the terminals of the battery when 1.0 A is being drawn by an external load?
Fig. 29-3
Solution: The voltage drop inside the battery is iri = 1.0 A · 0.70 Ω = 0.70 V, so the output 
voltage is reduced to 9.30 V.
When batteries with internal resistance are connected to external loads, the battery plus 
internal resistance is usually shown enclosed either by a dashed line or shading, and the 
emf is specified by the symbol (emf ).
29-12  A battery of 12 V emf has internal resistance of 0.50 Ω and is connected to a 
6.0 W load. What is the terminal voltage of the battery under these conditions and the 
power dissipated in the external resistor?
Solution: The total current comes from
	
emf = i(ri + R)  or 
i
12 V
6.50
1.85 A
=
Ω=
	
At this current, the voltage drop due to the internal resistor is 1.85 A · 0.50 Ω = 0.92 V, 
so the output voltage or voltage applied to the 6.0 Ω resistor is 11.08 V.
Fig. 29-4
The power dissipated in the external resistor is P = Vi = 1l.08 V · 1.85 A = 20.5 W.

CHAPTER 30	
RESISTORS IN DC CIRCUITS
267
In this chapter we will look first at series and parallel resistors and then at how series and 
parallel combinations are analyzed by writing successively simpler equivalent circuits.
Series Resistors
Take three resistors in series, as shown in Fig. 30-1.
Fig. 30-1
If a voltage V is applied to this combination, the current through each resistor is the 
same. The voltage statement for each of the resistors is V1 = IR1, V2 = IR2, V3 = IR3. 
The individual voltages across each resistor must add to the total, so V = V1 + V2 + V3 = 
I(R1 + R2 + R3). The equivalent resistor for this combination is R = R1 + R2 + R3. Resistors 
in series add linearly.
30-1  What is the equivalent resistance of 3.0-Ω and 4.0-Ω resistors placed in series? 
What is the current in each resistor if 10 V is applied to the combination?
Solution: The equivalent resistance is Req = 3.0 Ω + 4.0 Ω = 7.0 Ω. The current is the 
same in each resistor and has value I = V/Req = 10 V/7.0 Ω = 1.4 A.
Parallel Resistors
Place three resistors in parallel, as shown in Fig. 30-2. If a voltage is applied to this 
combination, the voltage across each resistor is this applied voltage, and the currents are 
determined by V = I1R1, V = I2R2, and V = I3R3. These currents must add up to the total 
current delivered to the combination.

Fig. 30-4.

NOTE:  The equivalent resistance of any two resistors is lower than either of the two 
alone.
Fig. 30-5
30-4  Apply 20 V across this network, and find the voltage across and current through 
each resistor.
Solution: In order to find the current in a resistor in the original network. It is necessary 
to work back through the equivalent circuits. Start with the last circuit. Apply 20 V to 
a 14.5-Ω resistor for a current of I = V/R = 20 V/14.5 Ω = 1.4 A. Working backward, 
this current through R1 produces a voltage across this resistor of V1 = (1.4 A)R1 =(1.4 A)
(8.0 Ω) = 11V. This current passes through the equivalent resistor R4 producing a volt­
age across it of V4 = (1.4 A)R4 = (1.4 A)(6.5 Ω) = 9.1V. V1 and V4 add to 20 V, the total 
applied, to within round-off error range. The 1.4 A divides between R2 and R3. The volt­
age across R2 and R3 is V4 = 9.1 V, so
	
I2 = 9.1 V/12 Ω = 0.76 A    I3 = 9.1 V/14 Ω = 0.65 A	
Again, this total adds to I.4 A, within round-off error. This analysis produces the voltage 
across and current through each resistor in the network. The numbers are internally con­
sistent (the currents through R2 and R3 add up to the current through their equivalence), 
giving confidence in the calculation.
30-5  In the circuit of Fig. 30-6, calculate the voltage across, current through, and power 
requirements of the 8.0-Ω resistor when 15 V is applied to the network.
Fig. 30-6
Solution: The first step in the analysis is to find the equivalent of R2 and R3.

The total current is I = V/R9 = 15 V/6.1 Ω = 2.46 A.
This current through the 2.1-Ω resistor produces V8 = (2.46 A) R8 = (2.46 A)(2.1 Ω) = 
5.16 V. Look back through the equivalent circuits and notice that this voltage is across 
R8, R6, and R2. The current through R2 then is I2 = V8/R2 = V2/R2 = 5.16 V/8.0 Ω = 0.64 A. 
The power dissipated in this resistor is I 2R = (0.64 A)2(8.0 Ω) = 3.3 W.
The general procedure for circuit analysis is to look at the circuit and find parts of it that 
can be replaced with simpler equivalents and just keep applying the process until the 
circuit is reduced to one resistor, perform V = IR on that resistor, and move back through 
the equivalents to obtain the desired information.

	
CHAPTER 31	
KIRCHHOFF’S LAWS
271
Kirchhoff’s laws applied to circuits containing multiple branches, voltage sources, and 
resistors allow calculation of currents in each branch of the circuit. Start with a very sim­
ple circuit consisting of a battery and resistor. The battery polarity is taken as indicated 
with positive charge leaving the positive plate. The current is as indicated by the arrow. 
An amount of charge or current over time starting at the negative plate of the battery is 
viewed as gaining energy in passing through the battery and losing this same amount of 
energy in the resistor. The equation for this circuit is shown in Fig. 31-1.
Fig. 31-1
Kirchhoff Voltage Loop Equations
The V - IR equation for this simple circuit illustrates the first Kirchhoff law: the alge­
braic sum of the changes in potential (energy) encountered in a complete traverse of a 
path is zero. This is analogous to a conservation of energy statement.
The only difficulty in applying Kirchhoff’s laws is keeping the algebraic signs correct. 
When confused, go back to this simple diagram of a battery and resistor and the current 
flowing (in the external circuit) from the positive side of the battery through the resistor 
to the negative side of the battery. Write the V - IR = 0 statement establishing that when a 
battery is traversed in a positive direction, there is a gain in energy giving V a plus sign, and 
when a resistor is traversed in the direction of the current arrow, there is a loss in energy 
giving IR a negative sign. Every Kirchhoff law problem you do should have this little circuit 
drawn in a corner of the paper to remind you of the algebraic signs and their importance.
Think of a “piece of charge” traversing the circuit gaining energy as it passes through 
the battery and losing energy as it passes through the resistor. In this simple circuit, the 
direction of the current is clear. In multiple branch circuits it is not possible to “guess” 
the correct directions for the currents. Make the best educated guess that you can, and let 
the mathematics tell you whether the currents are positive or negative.
Fig. 31-2

272	
CHAPTER 31
Consider the three branch circuit of Fig. 31-2. Make your best estimate of the current 
direction for each resistor, and draw and label the current arrows. It is not necessary to 
have the direction correct; it is only necessary to be consistent in applying the sign con­
vention. Now make two loops around this circuit, one around the left and one around 
the right, as indicated by the closed loops. Remember, when traversing a battery from 
minus to positive, write +V, and when traversing the resistor in the direction of the current 
arrow, write -IR. Around the first loop,
	
6 - 4I1 + 3I2 - 7 = 0	
In traversing this loop, start at the low, or negative, side of the 6 V battery, and proceed 
around the loop:
6 is positive.
4I1 is negative because the resistor is traversed in the direction of the current arrow.
3I2 is positive because the resistor is traversed in the direction opposite to the current 
arrow.
7 is negative because the battery is traversed from plus to minus.
Around the second loop,
	
7 - 3I2 - 6I3 - 4 = 0	
Rewrite these two equations.
	
-4I1 + 3I2 = 1	
	
3I2 + 6I3 = 3	
Writing the equations this way illustrates very clearly that they cannot be solved. In 
mathematical language, they are two equations with three unknowns. The third equation 
necessary to solve for the three currents comes from the next Kirchhoff law.
Kirchhoff Current Junction Equations
The second Kirchhoff law deals with the currents: the sum of the currents to any junc­
tion must add to zero. This law is often forgotten. It is, however, easily remembered via 
a whimsical law called the “fat wire law.” The fat wire law is very simple. The sum of 
the currents to any junction must equal zero; otherwise, the wire will get fat. Applying 
this second Kirchhoff law to the junction just above the 3 Ω resistor,
	
I1 + I2 - I3 = 0	
Now we have three independent equations in three unknowns.
NOTE:  For convenience in the discussion, individual equations in a set of equations 
will be designated by letter symbols. The number of significant figures used in the cal­
culations will be kept to a minimum so as not to obscure the mathematical procedure 
with numbers. Likewise, units will not be used. Several techniques for solving multiple 
equations in multiple unknowns will be presented. It is not necessary to know all these 
techniques. Pick a technique that you feel comfortable with, and learn it well.
	
(a)    I1 + I2 – I3 = 0	
	
(b)  -4 I1 + 3 I2 = 1	
	
(c)     3 I2 + 6 I3 = 3	

KIRCHHOFF’S LAWS	
273
At this point you may be asking why we did not take another loop to obtain a third equa­
tion. Taking another loop in the circuit will only serve to generate another equation that 
is a linear combination of the first two loop equations. Take a loop around the outside of 
the circuit and write
	
6 - 4 I1 - 6 I3 - 4 = 0  or  4 I1 + 6 I3 = 2	
This equation is just the difference of the first two loop equations and is not a linearly 
independent third equation. Therefore, it cannot be used to solve for the three currents. 
As an exercise, take a figure eight path around the circuit and prove that this statement is 
also a linear combination of the first two loop equations.
Solving by Adding and Subtracting
Now to the solution of these three equations. The most popular and direct approach is to 
add and subtract equations to produce two equations with two unknowns and then further 
add and subtract to solve for one current and work backward to find all the currents.
	
Multiply  4 × (a)  4I1 + 4I2 - 4 I3 = 0	
	
Add       (b)       –4 I1 + 3 I2 = 1	
	
To obtain      (a)         7 I2 - 4 I3 = 1	
Combine Equation (a) with 2/3 of Equation (c), and write (a) and (b ).
	
(a)  7I2 – 4I3 = 1	
	
(b)  2I2 + 4I3 = 2	
	
9I2 = 3  or  I2 = 1/3	
Place I2 = 1/3 into (c).
	
3(1/3) + 6I3 = 3  or  I3 = 1/3	
Now place I2 = 1/3 and I3 = 1/3 into (a).
	
I1 + (1/3) - (1/3) = 0  or  I1 = 0	
Check these current values in each of the original equations to verify that they are correct.
Solving by Determinants
Another method of solving these equations is with determinants. Using determinants to 
solve three equations in three unknowns is explained in the Mathematical Background. 
Your calculator may have an algorithm for solving simultaneous equations using determi­
nants (sometimes called Cramer’s rule), so this may be your method of choice.
Going back to the equations marked (a), (b), (c), set up the master determinant and 
expand along the first column. Equation (c) is divided by 3 to reduce the numbers.

Solving by Augmented Matrix
A third method of solving three equations in three unknowns is with an augmented 
matrix. Many calculators that have internal programs for solving simultaneous equations 
require data to be input in a manner similar to the augmented matrix form. The manipula­
tions of the augmented matrix are similar to adding and subtracting equations to find a 
solution. Before applying this method to the equations for this problem, look at a general 
set of three equations in three unknowns.
	
ax + by + cz = d	
	
ex + fy + gz = h	
	
kx + my + nz = p	
If the first equation were multiplied by -(k/a) and added to the third equation, these three 
equations would read
	
ax + by + cz = d	
	
ex + fy + gz = h	
	
(m - kb/a)y + [n - kc/a)z = p - kd/a	
What this accomplishes is to make the coefficient of x zero in the third equation. Now 
multiply the first equation by -k/e and add to the second equation, making the coefficient 
of x zero in the second equation. After this, the second equation can be multiplied by 
a constant and added to the third equation, with the constant chosen so as to make the 
coefficient of y in the third equation zero. Once this is accomplished, the solutions are 

KIRCHHOFF’S LAWS	
275
easily written down. The procedure is better illustrated with a specific case, the preced­
ing problem. These equations already have some coefficients equal to zero, making the 
process easier. This is usually the case with Kirchhoff law analysis.
	
I1 + I2 - I3 = 0	
	
-4I1 + 3I2 = 1	
	
I2 + 2I3 = 1	
Multiply the first equation by 4 and add to the second equation, generating a new second 
equation.
	
I1 + I2 - I3 = 0	
	
7I2 - 4I3 = 1	
	
I2 + 2I3 = 1	
This makes the coefficient of I1 equal to zero in the second and third equations, producing 
two equations in two unknowns. Now multiply the second equation by -1/7 and add to 
the third equation, generating a new third equation.
	
I1 + I2 - I3 = 0	
	
7I2 - 4I3 = 1	
	
(18/7) I3 = 6/7	
Now solve directly with I3 =1/3. Substituting this into the second equation, I2 = 1/3. Put­
ting these two values into the first equation gives I1 = 0.
The augmented matrix method uses the coefficients from the equations. The adding and 
subtracting of equations to generate other equations is done by multiplying and adding 
different rows of the matrix just as if they were equations. As we go through the pro­
cess, imagine that the operations are being performed on equations. Working with the 
coefficients arranged in an orderly array is easier. Working the matrix so as to produce 
zeros starting in the lower left hand corner and then moving diagonally across the matrix 
is easier than working the equations. Start with

There is already a zero in the lower left corner, so we need to create a zero in the –4 posi­
tion. Multiply the first row by 4 and add to the second row, generating a new second row. 
This is equivalent to multiplying the first equation by 4 and adding it to the second equa­
tion, generating a new second equation, which is a linear combination of the first two. 
This is exactly what is done in solving simultaneous equations by adding and subtracting.

Now go back to the equations where 18I3 = 6 or I3 = 1/3.
Put I3 = 1/3 into 7I2 -4I3 = 1  to obtain  I2 = 1/3.
Put I2 = 1/3 and I3 = 1/3  to obtain  I1 = 0.
These methods of solving multiple equations in multiple unknowns require considerable 
number manipulation with the attendant chance for error. The augmented matrix method 
has the least number manipulation while adding and subtracting may be more familiar to 
you. All of the techniques work. Pick the one that best fits you and the set of equations 
you are solving, and proceed carefully.
Applications 
The procedure for solving Kirchhoff’s laws problems is the following: 
1.	 Draw the battery and resistor circuit in the corner of your paper to remind you of the 
sign convention. 
2.	 Place current arrows next to each resistor and label them. 
3.	 Pick a junction and write the current statement. 
4.	 Draw loops and write the loop equations. 
5.	 Solve for the currents and check them in the original equations. 
31-1  Solve for the current in each of the resistors in the circuit shown in Fig. 31-3.
Fig. 31-3
Solution: Follow the procedure for Kirchhoff problems. This is a subject that is concep­
tually easy but because of the large number of manipulations, it is often hard to actually 
do. Work this problem as you are following along in the book. Draw the circuit and begin.
• Draw the single battery and single resistor with current arrow and V – IR = 0 equation.
• Place and label the current arrows.
• Write the statement of the “fat wire law” for the top center of the circuit.
I1 + I3 = I2

KIRCHHOFF’S LAWS	
277
• Write a loop statement for the left side of the circuit.
6 - 8 I1 - 10 I2 + 2 = 0
• Write a loop statement for the right side of the circuit.
–2 + 10 I2 + 6 I3 – 4 = 0
• Now write these three equations in a convenient form for solution.
	
I1 - I2 + I3 = 0	
	
8I1 + 10 I2 = 8	
	
10I2 + 6I3 = 6	
As an exercise, solve these equations and verify that the solutions are I1 = 17/47 = 0.36, 
I2 = 24/47 = 0.51, and I3 = 7/47 = 0.15. Check these answers in the original equations.
31-2  Consider a more complicated problem, as shown in Fig. 31-4, and calculate the 
currents in the resistors.
Fig. 31-4
Solution: Draw the battery and resistor circuit and V - IR equation to remind you of the 
algebraic sign convention. Note the current arrows. Remember that if one of the currents 
comes out negative, it means only that the current is opposite to the direction of your 
arrow. Apply the “fat wire law” to the line across the top of the three resistors.
	
I1 + I2 + I4 = I3	
The loop around the top branch of the circuit is 6 – 8I1 = 0. A loop around the lower 
left branch is 10 – 10I4 – 5I3 – 3 = 0. A loop around the lower right branch is 3 + 5I3 + 
6I2 – 6 = 0. Rewrite the equations in convenient form for solving
	
I1 + I2 - I3 + I4 = 0	
	
8I1 = 6	
	
6I2 + 5I3 = 3	
	
5I3 + 10I4 = 7

Immediately, I1 = 3/4 = 0.75. Work the problem and verity that the other currents are 
I2 = - 0.20, I3 = 0.84, and I4 = 0.28.
31-3  Calculate the currents in the resistors of the circuit shown in Fig. 31-5.
Fig. 31-5
Solution: Draw the battery and resistor circuit and V - IR equation to remind you of the 
algebraic sign convention. Apply the “fat wire law” to the line across the top of the circuit.
	
I1 - I2 - I3 + I4 = 0	
The loop around the left branch is 4 - 6I1 - 3I2 + 2 - 4I2 = 0. The middle loop is 4I2 - 2 + 
3I2 - 8I3 = 0. The loop around the right branch is - 3 + 5I4 + 8I3 = 0. Rewrite the equations 
in convenient form for solving
	
I1 - I2 - I3 + I4 = 0	
	
6I1 + 7I2 = 6	
	
7I2 - 8I3 = 2	
	
8I3 + 5I4 = 3	
Work the problem and verify that the currents are I1 = 0.41, I2 = 0.51, I3 = 0.19, and I4 = 0.29.
Hint: First solve for I3 using determinants, then the rest of the currents by algebra.

	
CHAPTER 32	
RC CIRCUITS
279
Our first look at RC circuits is with a simple word description of the charging phenomenon. 
The circuit shown in Fig. 32-1 is appropriate for the study of charging and discharging. 
After giving a general description of how the circuit works, we will take a closer look at 
the mathematical description. Throughout the discussion, unless the context and notation 
indicate otherwise, lowercase letters mean time varying quantities and uppercase letters 
constants. For example, q is the symbol for time varying charge on the capacitor, while 
Q is the total charge.
Fig. 32-1
Charging
Assume that the capacitor has zero charge and voltage, and place the switch S in the 
charging position (up). When the battery voltage is applied to the R and C in series, 
current begins to flow. Current through the resistor causes a voltage drop across the 
resistor. Because of this voltage drop, less than the battery voltage is applied to the 
capacitor. As current flows, the capacitor charges, and less and less current flows until 
there is no current, no voltage across the resistor, and the capacitor is charged to the bat­
tery voltage (Q = CV ).
The charge on the capacitor increases with time starting with zero charge and eventually 
reaching maximum charge of CV following an exponential function.

This function fits our understanding of how the circuit operates because when t = 0, q is

CHAPTER 32
C   When the battery voltage is applied to R and C, voltages across these components 
vary with time. We can, however, write a Kirchhoff-type voltage statement that is correct 
for the entire time the circuit is charging. This is called an instantaneous voltage state­
ment; it is true at any instant of time. Following Kirchhoff’s law,

Fig. 32-2
Notice in the curve of q versus t that at t = 0, q = 0, and as t → ∞, q → CV. In the curve 
of i versus t, at t = 0, i = V/R, and as t → ∞, i → 0.
At t = 0, the charge on the capacitor is zero, and the current is maximum, and as t goes to 
infinity, the current goes to zero, and the charge reaches its maximum of CV.
The Time Constant
In biological systems that grow exponentially, the systems are often characterized by 
giving the doubling time, the time for the system to double in number, size, or mass. In 
electrical systems that grow exponentially, the systems are characterized by a time con­
stant, the time to make the exponent of e equal to 1. The time constant for this circuit is 
RC [see Equation (32-1)]. As an exercise, verify that the units of RC are seconds.
Look at Equation (32-1) and the q versus t graph. When t = RC, 1 - e–1 = 0.63, and the 
charge on the capacitor has risen to 0.63 of its final value. A similar statement can be 
made about the voltage on the capacitor. After one time constant, the voltage on the 
capacitor is 0.63 of the battery voltage.
The current, meanwhile, has in one time constant dropped to e–1 = 0.37 of its initial value.
32-1  A 10 kΩ resistor and a 20 mF capacitor are placed in series with a 12 V battery. Find 
the charge on the capacitor, the current, and the voltages on the capacitor and resistor at 
the instant the switch is closed t = 0.
Solution: At t = 0, the charge on the capacitor is zero. At t = 0, the current is i = V/R = 
12 V/10 × 103 Ω = 1.2 × 10–3 A. At t = 0, the voltage on the capacitor is zero (it has no 
charge), and the entire battery voltage of 12 V is across the resistor.
32-2  For the circuit of Problem 32-1, find the time constant and the charge, current, and 
VR and VC at a time equal to one time constant.
Solution: The time constant is RC = 10 × 103 Ω · 20 × 10–6 F = 0.20 s. The charge on the 
capacitor at t = 0.20 s is

These problems can be deceptively easy. Be sure you know how to manipulate the expo­
nents on your calculator. Don’t get a test problem wrong because you did not practice 
all the steps in the problem and were unfamiliar with manipulating exponents on your 
calculator.
32-3  For the circuit of Problem 32-1, how long does it take for the capacitor to reach 
80 percent of its final charge?
Solution: This problem is similar to radioactive decay problems where we want to know 
the time for half the material to decay. There is a fair amount of algebraic manipulation 
that is easier to follow without numbers, so the problem will be worked as far as possible 
with symbols.
Start with

, and note that the final (fully charged) q is equal to CV. 
Mathematically, when t → ∞, e–t/RC → 0 and 1 - e-t/RC → 1, so q → CV.
To find the time for 80 percent charge, set q equal to 80 percent of the final charge, or 
q = 0.80 CV, and solve for t.

To solve for t, switch the exponential equation to a logarithmic equation. One of the func­
tions of logarithms is to solve for variables in exponents. Thus
	
t/RC = ln 5  or  t = RC ln 5	
Now put in the values for R and C.
	
t = RC ln 5 = 1.0 × 104 Ω · 20 × 10–6 F · ln 5 = 0.32 s	
As a check, note that 1 - e–t/RC = 1 - e–0.32/0.20 = 0.80.
Discharging
After the capacitor is left to charge for a long time (many time constants), the charge is 
CV. Move the switch to the discharge position (down in Fig. 32-1), where R and C are in 
series. When the charged capacitor and resistor are placed in series, the charged capacitor 
acts as a battery. The voltage on the capacitor is q/C, and this voltage appears across the 
resistor as iR. As time goes on, the charge on the capacitor is depleted, and the current 
drops (eventually) to zero. The charge decays according to

32-4  For the circuit described in Problem 32-1 placed in the discharge mode, how long 
does it take for the circuit to discharge to 50 percent of its original (total) charge?
Solution: Solve Equation (32-5) for t when q = 0.50 CV. Thus
	
0.50 CV = CVe-t/RC  or  0.50 = e-t/RC	
It is more convenient to write 0.50 as 1/2, so when the statement is converted to logarithms,

t = RC ln 2 = 1.0 × 104 Ω · 20 × 10–6 F · ln 2 = (0.20)(0.69 s) = 0.14 s	
In terms of time constants, this would be ln 2 time constants, or 0.69 of a time constant.
It makes sense that our answer is less than one time constant because it takes less time 
for the charge to decline to 50 percent of its initial value than to 37 percent (1/e) of its 
initial value.
32-5  An RC circuit is observed during discharge to have an initial capacitor potential of 
100 V and after 3.0 s to have a potential of 20 V. How long will it take for the capacitor 
to discharge to 1.0 V?
Solution: The voltage across the capacitor at any time is determined by Equation (32-5) 
rewritten as q/C or VC = Vo e-t/RC, where Vo is the voltage at t = 0.
Take Vo = 100, VC = 20 V, and t = 3.0 s, and write
	
20 V = 100 Ve–3.0/RC  or  2/10 = e–3.0/RC  or  e3.0/RC = 5

Knowing this number, the specific decay law for this circuit can be written as V = 100 V e-t/1.9. 
Now calculate the time for the voltage to drop to 1.0 V.
	
1.0 V = 100 V e-t/1.9  or  (1/100) = e–t/1.9	
Switching to logarithms,
	
-ln 100 = -(t/1.9)  or  t = l.9 · ln 100 = 8.6 s	
Go back over this problem and note the procedure.
1.	 After reading the problem, the general law (equation) was written down, VC = Voe-t/RC.
2.	 Next, the data from the problem (100 V going to 20 V in 3.0 s) is used to find RC.
3.	 With RC, the specific law for this problem was written, V = 100 Ve-t/1.9.
4.	 Finally, with this specific law, the predictive calculation was performed to find the 
time for the 100 V to decay to 1.0 V.
This analysis procedure is typical of growth and decay problems in general. Be familiar 
with the steps in this procedure. It will keep you from getting lost and not knowing how 
to proceed in problems like this.

	
CHAPTER 33	
MAGNETIC FIELDS
285
The magnetic field or B field is a field that produces a force on a moving charge. This 
is not the only definition, but it is a good operational definition to start with. The force is 
given by the vector relation
	
q v
o
F
B
=
×
	
(33-1)
Cross products are discussed in detail in the Mathematical Background. In a coordinate 
system, the relation is shown in Fig. 33-1.
Fig. 33-1
To fix the direction of the force on a positive charge, place the right hand with fingers 
pointing in the direction of v and a line normal to the palm of the hand pointing in the 
direction of B. Curl the fingers naturally into B. The thumb points in the direction of F. 
For a negative charge, the force is in the opposite direction. The force is a right angle to 
the plane of v and B.
Since this is a vector, it can be expressed as a cross product in determinant form

or in magnitude and direction form F = vB sin f, where f is the angle between v and B, 
and F points in a direction normal to the plane of v and B, as determined by the right-
hand rule.
Most problems involve v and B at right angles, so the magnitude of the force reduces 
to the product of q, v, and B, with the direction of F determined by the right-hand rule. 
The units of B are [from the force Equation (33-1)] N ⋅ s/C ⋅ m or N/A ⋅ m, which is called 
a tesla (T). The tesla is related to the smaller and widely used unit the gauss (1 tesla = 
104 gauss).

Now for the direction. Place the right hand in the direction of v (out of the paper), and 
curl the fingers into B (down) so that the thumb points to the right (looking at the paper). 
Because this is a negative charge, the force is to the left.
The electron is deflected in a horizontal plane. B in the vertical direction always pro­
duces a force in the horizontal plane and at right angles to the velocity, causing the 
electron to move along a circular path. A mass whirled on the end of a string moves in 
a circle because the (center-directed) force is at right angles to the velocity throughout 
the motion.
This problem is typical of many problems with charged particle trajectories in magnetic 
fields, where the B field is always at right angles to the motion, so the vector problem 
reduces to one of finding the magnitude of the force and then determining the direction 
via the right-hand rule. The next problem is illustrative of a more difficult problem where 
the velocity vector has two components. Be sure you have mastered the calculation 
in Problem 33-1, and above all, the direction, before moving on to this more difficult 
problem.
33-2  Take an electron with velocity (components) v = 2.0 × 106 i - 3.0 × 106 j m/s, and 
a B field of B = 4.0 × 10-3 k T.

It is a bit hard to envision, but a velocity vector in the x-y plane curled into a B-field 
vector in the z direction produces a force vector in the x-y plane. Figure 33-3 shows the 
orientations.
Fig. 33-3
There are several classic phenomena, experiments, and equipment associated with mov­
ing charges in B fields. These are both interesting and instructive. You will probably use 
one or more of these instruments in your work.
The Cyclotron
If a particle with negative charge, mass, and velocity is injected into a B field in a plane 
normal to the field, the force is at right angles to the velocity and remains at right angles 
to the velocity throughout the motion, causing the charged particle to go in a circle, as 
shown in Fig. 33-4. A positively charged particle would move in a circle in the opposite 
direction.
Fig. 33-4

CHAPTER 33
The force is at right angles to the velocity. Apply the v × B law for a negative charge. 
The magnitude of this force is qvB, and it is always at right angles to the velocity. From 
mechanics, a motion produced by a force at right angles to the velocity is circular; thus 
the charged particles move in circular orbits. This qvB force provides the (mechanical 
force) mv2/r, so equating these forces,
	
qv B = mv2/r	
(33-3)
There are several relations that follow from this statement, but for the cyclotron, the most 
important is the one for the orbit radius

A cyclotron is a device for accelerating charged particles while they are being forced 
to travel in a circular path by a magnetic field. A source of, say, deuterons is placed 
at the center of the device. A deuteron is a proton and neutron combination with 
one electronic charge and 2 amu. An amu (atomic mass unit) is the average mass 
of a nuclear resident (neutron or proton). The deuterons exit the source with a small 
velocity to the right. The radius of the circular orbit is given by r = mv/qB and is 
quite small. The particle enters a semicircular open area between D shaped plates and 
travels in a circular orbit until it exits the D area. The voltage between the “Dees,” as 
they are called, is alternated sinusoidally so that on leaving the right Dee the particle 
is accelerated and assumes a new (larger) orbit in the left Dee. When the particle 
leaves the left Dee, the voltage is again switched so that acceleration is accomplished 
across the Dees. Remember that the angular frequency is q B/m and is not dependent 
on velocity!

The deuteron gained this large amount of energy by making many traverses of the 
distance between the Dees as the voltage was alternating at the cyclotron frequency.

CHAPTER 33
The Mass Spectrometer
Another application of the circular orbits in a magnetic field is in the mass spectrometer. 
Ionized atoms are injected into a magnetic field at a known energy (velocity). They take up 
circular orbits with radii determined by their mass. The ions are detected with a photographic 
plate or traveling collector.
The ions are accelerated (by a voltage) to a particular energy before they enter the mag­
netic field region. Their energy is their charge times this accelerating voltage. This is the 
energy the ions have while orbiting in the magnetic field (see the preceding problem)

The J. J. Thomson Experiment
The J. J. Thomson experiment uses crossed electric and magnetic fields to measure the 
charge to mass ratio for the electron. This classic experiment dates from 1897.
Fig. 33-7
The force equation for moving electrons subject to both electric and magnetic fields is
	
F = qoE + qov × B	
(33-6)
The electric and magnetic fields are arranged as shown in Fig. 33-7. Verify that a nega­
tively charged particle will experience a “down” force due to the magnetic field and an 
“up” force due to the electric field. In the tube, the voltage V accelerates the electrons 
from the hot filament, and the electrons enter a field-free region between the accelerating 
grid, shown as the dotted line, and the video screen.
In the experiment, a deflecting electric field is applied, and the spot on the screen is 
observed to move up on the screen. The B field is added to bring the spot back to zero 
deflection. In this situation, the net force is zero, and because of the directions of E, v, 
and B, E = vB.

The velocity of the electrons is determined by the accelerating voltage in the tube. The 
electrons are accelerated before they enter the region of crossed E and B fields and travel 
through this region and to the screen without further acceleration axially down the tube.

voltage. For zero deflection, an energy statement can be made replacing v with E/B

The Hall Effect
The Hall effect is used to determine the algebraic sign and number density n of charge 
carriers in a conductor. Set up a slab of unknown material in a magnetic field, as shown 
in Fig. 33-8. In one sample (left side of figure), assume that the current is due to charge 
carriers that are positive and in the other negative. Apply the v × B force on each, with 
the B field directed into the page, and notice that despite the sign of the carriers, they 
will be deflected to the right. This accumulation of carriers will create a “transverse” or 
Hall voltage, which has a different direction depending on the sign of the charge carriers. 
In the sample on the left (positive charge carriers), point b is at a higher potential than 
point a. In the sample on the right (negative charge carriers), point b is at a lower potential 
than point a. The sign of the voltage produced in the Hall experiment gives the sign of the 
charge carriers. Charges build up to produce an electric field (the transverse Hall field) 
that just balances the magnetic force on the charge carriers.
Fig. 33-8

MAGNETIC FIELDS	
293
This Hall field is EH = VH/d. The Hall field is also the E in the statement for zero force, 
that is, 0 = qE + qv × B. This produces a Hall field of EH = vdB. The current density in the 
sample is j = nevd. Combining,

2.0 T produces a Hall voltage of 2.0 × 10-4 V. Find the sign of the charge carriers, their 
number density, and the resistivity of the material.

CHAPTER 34	
MAGNETIC FORCES
295
Magnetic fields exert forces on moving charges. If these charges are confined to wires 
then the fields can be thought of as exerting forces on current-carrying wires. The vector 
equation for the force is
	
F = il × B	
(34-1)
where l is the length of the wire taken in the direction of the current. In most instances, it 
is not necessary to do a formal vector cross product because the directions of the current 
and the magnetic field are perpendicular. The one instance where this becomes important 
is in considering the torque on a current-carrying wire. This problem is central to several 
topics and is taken up as a separate exercise.
34-1  A typical problem illustrating the force on a current-carrying wire is the problem of 
a wire of 0.010 kg and 1.0 m in length suspended by springs in a B field of strength 30 T 
directed out of the page. What current will cause zero tension in the springs?
Fig. 34-1
Solution: First, consider the direction of the current. The force due to the magnetic field 
has to be up, so the current has to be from right to left. With the right hand, form l × B 
with i in both directions to verify this conclusion. The value of the current that makes 
for zero tension in the springs occurs when the force due to the magnetic field balances 
gravity. This is a force-balance problem. Thus

34-2  Another problem illustrating this force is a rod or bar resting on current-carrying 
rails with a perpendicular magnetic field. Take the field as 0.50 gauss (approximately 
the Earth’s field) and the separation as 3.0 m, and calculate the current needed through 
the bar of mass 0.20 kg with coefficient of friction 0.070 to make it slide along the rails.

296	
CHAPTER 34
Fig. 34-2
Solution: The orientation of current (either direction in the bar) and magnetic field is such 
that the force produced by the il × B will slide the bar along the rails. Verify this with the 
right-hand rule. The force opposing this sliding is mmg, so this is a force-balance problem.

A Current-Carrying Loop in a B Field
The study of torque on a current-carrying loop leads to the definition of the magnetic 
moment of a circulating current, the understanding of the meter movement (voltmeter 
and current meter), and electric motors and generators. A loop of wire placed in a mag­
netic field and oriented as shown in Fig. 34-3 will have no torque or maximum torque 
depending on the orientation (rotation) of the loop with respect to the magnetic field.
Fig. 34-3
As shown in the middle diagram, the piece of wire on the right carrying a current i, repre­
sented by the tail of the current arrow, has a force to the right (l × B) producing no torque. 
The piece of wire on the left produces a force to the left, also producing no torque. In the 
diagram on the right, the forces are in the same direction, but for this orientation of the 
coil, the torque is a maximum.
Figure 34-4 shows the torque for angles other than for zero or maximum torque. The 
torque is the component of this force at right angles to the line connecting the two sides 
of the coil times b/2 (the lever arm) times 2 (two wires).

MAGNETIC FORCES	
297
Fig. 34-4
The appropriate component of the force is F sin a. The vector m, the magnetic moment, 
is normal to the plane of the coil and points in the direction of the thumb when the fingers 
are curled naturally in the direction of the current in the coil. The angle between m and 
B is the same as the angle between force and lever arm
	
t = 2(b/2)iaB sin a = iAB sin a	
The product ab is the area A of the loop. The sin a term implies a cross product, and if 
iA is taken as the magnitude of m, the magnetic moment, with the direction as defined 
in Fig. 34-4, then the vector equation for the torque is
 
t = m × B  or  t = mB sin a  with direction defined by m × B	
(34-2)
34-3  Find an expression for the torque on a circular coil of radius a carrying current I 
placed at an angle to a magnetic field.
Fig. 34-5
Solution: The definition of the magnetic moment and the expression for the torque based 
on the magnetic moment are most convenient. The magnetic moment is m = IA = pa2I. The 
magnitude of the torque is T = mB sin a = pa 2 IB sin a,  and the direction is the direction 
determined by m × B.
34-4  Find the maximum torque on a circular coil of 0.050 m radius with current of

CHAPTER 34
34-5  The plane of a 10 turn rectangular loop of wire 3.0 cm by 4.0 cm carrying 2.0 A 
is at an angle of 60° with respect to a magnetic field of 20 T. What is the torque on the 
loop in this position?
Solution: First, calculate the magnetic moment, noting that the current is not due to one 
loop but 10 loops. Thus m = IA = 10 · 2.0 A · 12 × 10-4 m2 = 2.4 × 10-2 A · m2. Refer to 
Fig. 34-5, and note that if the angle between the plane of the coil and the magnetic field 
is 60°, then the angle between m and B is 30°, so the torque is
	
t = mB sin a = 2.4 × 10-2 A · m2 · 20 T · sin 30° = 0.24 N · m	
C   34-6  An interesting problem is to ask the question, “What dimensions of a rect­
angle will produce maximum torque for the same length of wire?”
Solution: Take a rectangle with length , width w, and perimeter equal to p = 2 + 2w. 
The perimeter relating  to w is the constraint in the problem. The torque is T = mB = 
IAB = I w B. Before looking for a maximum, we need to write  or w in terms of the 
constraint p.

this requirement in for p in the constraint equation (2 + 2w = 4w) requires that  = w. The 
rectangle must be a square. The second derivative is always negative, indicating that the 
curve is everywhere concave down and that this point is a maximum.
d’Arsonval Meter Movement
A schematic of a d’Arsonval galvanometer is shown in Fig. 34-6. The torque on a loop 
in a magnetic field offset by the torque of a spiral spring as shown here is the basis for 
mechanical meter movements. Galvanometers are midreading meters. Current meters 
use parallel (with the coil) resistors to change the scale of the meter. Voltmeters use 
large series resistors to take the small currents necessary to activate the meter to measure 
voltage.
Fig. 34-6

MAGNETIC FORCES

The plane of the coil is parallel to the magnetic field so that a small current in the coil 
produces a torque on the coil that is offset by the torque of the spiral spring. With this 
arrangement, the rotation of the coil is proportional to the current. The external magnetic 
field (supplied by the permanent magnet) is curved (shaped), so the field is parallel to 
the plane of the coil through an angle of typically 60°. Meter movements are rated as to 
how much current causes full scale deflection. A movement with a full scale deflection 
corresponding to 1.0 mA is typical.
Energy Storage in Magnetic Materials
Magnetic dipoles placed in a magnetic field experience a torque. A simple model of 
a magnetic dipole is a molecule with a circulating current. These dipoles are rotated 
depending on the restoring torque of the material (structure). Picture a collection of 
magnetic dipolar molecules in a crystalline structure rotated by an external magnetic 
field, thus stressing the structure. Consider the work done on a magnetic dipole by the 
application of an external magnetic field. This work is equivalent to the energy stored in 
the dipole-field combination.
C   The energy of the system is taken as zero when m and B are at right angles (a = 90°).

AMPERE’S LAW

where mo = 4p × 10-7 Wb/A ⋅ m is the (magnetic) permeability (Wb = weber). The 
direction of the field is (a vector) tangent to a circle about the current-carrying wire 
normal to the plane of the current. With the thumb of the right hand in the direction of 
the current, the fingers naturally curl in the direction of the B fields tangent to concentric 
circles. The drawing on the left side of Fig. 35-1 is a view of a current coming out of the 
paper showing the field as a vector tangent to the circle and the drop off of the magnetic 
field with radius. The diagram on the right side is a three dimensional view of the mag­
netic field around a current-carrying wire.

where i is the current contained within the path of the integral. This integral sign with a 
small circle means that the integral is to be performed over a closed path. In this case, 
the path is a circle in a plane normal to the current (see Fig. 35-1). The circular path is 
centered about the wire, where the magnetic field is a constant. Over this circular path the 
magnetic field vector and dl, the vector representing an element of length of the circle, 
are parallel, so the sum of (integral of) their dot product B ⋅ dl, is the constant B times the 
circumference of the circle, or B(2pr). Remember that the dot product is the product of 
the projection of one vector onto another.

This is comparable to the Earth’s magnetic field. Assuming that the power line is parallel

The Force on Current Carrying Wires
Parallel wires carrying currents I1 and I2 produce a force on each other. Take the currents 
as parallel, as shown in Fig. 35-3. The current in wire 1 produces a magnetic field at 
wire 2 of magnitude

. This field is directed down, as shown, and produces 
a force on wire 2 of magnitude F2 = B1I2. These forces are usually written in terms of 
force per unit length, and this is most convenient in this problem. The force per unit 
length on wire 2 produced by the magnetic field associated with I1 is

The force on wire 2 due to the magnetic field produced by wire 1 is toward wire 1. 
Go through the v × B operation until this is clear in your mind. If you encounter a test 
problem concerning forces on wires, inevitably one part of the question will concern the

direction, and you don’t want to get something this simple wrong because you didn’t 
practice the v ×  B operation.
Fig. 35-3
This is the experimental setup that is used to define the ampere. A current produces a 
magnetic field that produces a force on another current. Using Ampere’s law and this 
setup current can be related directly to mechanical force.
35-3  Consider two wires coming out of the page carrying equal and oppositely directed 
currents, as shown in Fig. 35-4. The wires are suspended from a common point with 
0.40 m long cords. The wires have a mass per unit length of 30 × 10-3 kg/m. Calculate 
the current to produce an angle of 6°.
Solution: This is a force-balance problem. The horizontal component of the tension 
(force) in the cord must equal the force due to the currents. Look at 1.0 m of the wire. 
The mass of 1.0 m of wire is 30 × 10-3 kg, and the force due to gravity mg = 0.29 N. This 
must equal the vertical component of the tension in the cord. From the geometry,
	
tan 6° = Fh/Fv  or  Fh = 0.29 N(tan 6°) = 0.031 N	
Fig. 35-4
In Fig. 35-4, the separation of the wires is 2 s, where s is defined in the figure through 
sin 6° = s/0.40 m or s = 0.40 m ⋅ sin 6°. The electric force produced by the current in one 
wire producing a magnetic field that acts on the current in the other wire is

Another variation of this problem is concentric conductors with equal and opposite

(Ampere’s law) is related to the net current within the path.
The inner conductor is solid and has radius a. The outer conductor is hollow, having an 
inner radius b and an outer radius c. The currents are numerically equal but in opposite 
directions. Look at the magnetic field over several regions.

Average Field Outside a Wire
Another application of Ampere’s law involves the calculus concept of average value of 
a function.
C   35-5  Calculate the average value of the magnetic field from 0.05 m to 0.10 m 
radially out from a long wire carrying 100 A.
Solution: The magnetic field falls off radially according to B = moI/2pr. The average 
value of the function over this interval is the integral of the function (the area under the 

306

curve of B versus r) divided by the radial distance. See the Mathematical Background for 
the definition of the average value of a function.

The Solenoid
A popular device that is based on the application of Ampere’s law is the solenoid, a 
tightly wound coil producing a nearly uniform magnetic field along the axis of the coil. 
The coil is shown in Fig. 35-9.
Fig. 35-9
For tightly wound coils, the windings take on the form of a sheet of current, and a cross 
section looks as shown in the middle drawing of the figure. The magnetic field around 
each coil of wire is such that the magnetic field is concentrated and nearly uniform inside 
the coil.

The drawing on the right of Fig. 35-9 shows the magnetic fields of adjacent wires. 
Between the wires, the fields add to zero, so the integrals along the paths b → c and 
d → a are zero. The path from c → d can be moved sufficiently far away that the integral 
along this path approaches zero. The only nonzero integral is along the centerline of the 

AMPERE’S LAW

solenoid, the a → b path. Therefore, if the path length is taken as L, then Ampere’s law 
becomes
	
BL = moIoNL  or  B = moIoN	
(35-3)
where N is the number of turns per length, so IoNL is the total current within the path.

BIOT-SAVART LAW
309
Ampere’s law allows convenient calculation of the magnetic field surrounding a straight 
current-carrying wire. While the law is written in calculus terms, the application is quite 
easy and involves little formal calculus for most problems. The Biot-Savart law is more 
general than Ampere’s law and allows calculation of the magnetic field in the vicinity 
of curved wires. Application of the Biot-Savart law involves considerable calculus. If 
you are interested only in application of the formula for the magnetic field on the axis 
of a current carrying coil, you may want to skip directly to the problems involved with 
these calculations. For the physics student with a reasonable background in calculus, the 
Biot-Savart law is very good for learning how to interpret a differential law written in 
vector format.
The magnetic field due to a moving charge or a current is given by the Biot-Savart 
law.

CHAPTER 37
FARADAY’S LAW
313
There are two basic experiments demonstrating Faraday’s law. The first experiment 
involves passing a magnet through a loop of wire. If a magnet is passed through a loop of 
wire connected to a galvanometer, as shown in Fig. 37-1, then three things are observed:
1.	 A current is observed in the loop when the magnet is moving.
2.	 The direction of the current depends on the direction of the magnet.
3.	 The magnitude of the deflection (current) is proportional to the strength of the magnet 
and its velocity.
Fig. 37-1
The second Faraday experiment involves two loops of wire. If the current in the primary 
loop (the one with the battery) is changed, then there is a current in the secondary loop 
(the one with the galvanometer).
Fig. 37-2
If the switch connecting the battery to the loop is opened and closed, three things are 
observed:
1.	 A current in the galvanometer loop is observed when the switch is closed.
2.	 A current in the opposite direction is observed when the switch is opened.
3.	 No current in the galvanometer loop is observed when there is steady or zero current 
in the battery loop.
These two experiments are the basis for a statement of Faraday’s law. An electromotive 
force emf and current are induced in a loop when there is a change in magnetic field in the 
loop. The magnitude of the induced emf is proportional to the rate of change in magnetism.
The amount of magnetism is conveniently envisioned as lines of flux F. For a constant 
magnetic field and area normal to the field, flux is related to magnetic field through
	
F = BA	
(37-1)

314	
CHAPTER 37
The magnetic field can be envisioned as a collection of (magnetic) lines (of flux), with 
a higher magnetic field being associated with a higher density of flux lines (more lines 
of flux per square meter). Picture a square frame 1 m on a side oriented normal to the 
direction of a magnetic field. A stronger (higher tesla) field is viewed as one with more 
lines passing through this frame. There are no physical lines of flux. This is a convenient 
construct that allows us to visualize magnetic fields.
C   The formal definition of flux involves an integral that looks difficult, but in con­
cept it is relatively easy to understand and in practice is often done by inspection.
	
 
B

d
∫
Φ =

(37-2)
The vector ds is a vector normal to a surface. B is the vector representing the field passing 
through this surface. If B and ds are pointing in the same direction, the integral reduces 
to equation (37-1). Even when an integral is required most of the time B is at a fixed 
angle with respect to ds, so the integral involves the area and an angle without any formal 
integration.
The unit of flux is the tesla-meter squared, which has a special name, weber (wb).  One 
weber’s worth of flux passing through a square meter produces a field strength of one 
tesla.
Faraday’s law specifically states that the emf induced in a closed loop is the change in 
flux per time.

(37-3)
The delta form of this statement implies that the emf is the average emf over the time 
interval. The minus sign is a reminder of the convention for determining the direction 
of the emf. For multiple turns of a coil, the emf is just the number of turns times this 
change in flux over time. The direction of the induced emf is such as to produce a 
magnetic field in opposition to the field that created the emf. This will be discussed 
in detail in the context of a problem. Now look at several means for generating emf’s 
in wires.
This induced emf is different from the emf produced by a battery. In the case of a battery, 
a terminal voltage can be measured, and the emf of the battery can be associated with the 
battery raising the potential of charges passing through it. In the case of a loop of wire, 
there are no terminals, yet there is a current, so we say that this current must be due to an 
electromotive force, a force that makes electric charges move. While there are no termi­
nals to measure voltage in the loop, the current in the loop due to magnetic induction is 
just as real as the current produced by a battery.
37-1  Place a 20 turn coil of radius 0.050 m inside a solenoid, where the magnetic field 
is changed from 40 × 10–3 T in one direction to 40 × 10–3 T in the other direction in 60 × 
10–3 s. Find the induced emf.

FARADAY’S LAW

Solution:  Inside the coil, the flux is F = BA = 40 × 10–3 Tp(0.05 m)2 = 3.1 × 10–4 Wb.
The change in flux is ΔF = 6.2 × 10–4 Wb, and this occurs over 60 × 10–3 s in the coil of 
20 turns, so the induced emf is

Lenz’s Law
To determine the direction of the induced current, look at the coil and the direction of the 
initial and final magnetic fields through the coil. The field originally pointing to the right 
collapses to zero and then grows to the left to its final value. The current is physically 
constrained by the wire to go only in one of two directions. If the current in the coil were 
such that the field produced by this current grew in the same direction as the field that 
initiated the current, then the current would continue to grow (because the field would 
continue to change in the same direction). This would mean that any time a field changed 
in a loop of wire, the current in the loop would grow without limit. This is clearly con­
trary to nature. Lenz’s law, applied to this situation, states that an induced current is in a 
direction so as to produce a field that opposes the changing field that initiated the current. 
This will be shown in subsequent problems.
37-2  A circular loop 0.040 m in radius is perpendicular to a magnetic field of 0.50 T. 
The loop is stretched across a diameter, so that its area goes to zero in 0.20 s. What is the 
induced voltage and direction of the current through the resistor?
Solution: The flux through the loop is F = BA = 0.50 T ⋅ p (0.04 m)2 = 2.5 × 10–3 Wb.

The current is such as to produce a magnetic field out of the page (or in opposition to the

on the resistor.
37-3  Take a 50 turn rectangular coil of dimensions 0.10 m by 0.20 m and rotate it from 
a position perpendicular to a field of 0.50 T to parallel to the field in 0.10 s, and calculate 
the induced emf.

CHAPTER 37
Fig. 37-5
Solution: The flux F = BA. In addition, ΔF = BA because the flux goes from maximum 
to zero.
ΔF = BA = 0.50 T ⋅ 2.0 × 10–2 m2 = 1.0 × 10–2 T ⋅ m2

The units in this calculation are helpful in understanding the emf generated in a loop. A 
T ⋅ m2 is a weber, a measure of the number of lines of flux. Weber’s per second is the 
number of flux lines per second that are changed within a loop. One weber’s worth of 
flux lines per second generates an emf of 1 V in the loop.
C   37-5  Now find the average emf induced over this time. This is the average value 
of the instantaneous emf function over this one-quarter cycle.
Solution: This requires the concept of the average value of a function from integral 
calculus. Review this procedure in the Mathematical Background, if necessary. This

The integral is done over q for convenience rather than over wt and a time interval. The 
average value of the first quarter cycle of the sine function is the same as the average 
value for the first half cycle of the sine function and the same as the absolute value of 
the average value of the entire sine function. This is an excellent example of a problem 
where the average emf can be calculated using either Δf/Δt (Problem 37-3) or the average 
value of the function for emf.

As the loop is being pulled through the field, there is a decrease in the number of lines

CHAPTER 37
direction so as to create more flux out of the page. This requires a counterclockwise cur­
rent around the loop. Interestingly, this current produces forces on the sides of the loop. 
Apply the right-hand rule to the forces, and note that the force on the bottom section of 
the wire is down, while the force on the top section of the wire is up. These two forces are 
equal and opposite and so add to zero. The force on the vertical section of the wire is to 
the left in opposition to the force producing the velocity. The force on the wire due to the 
induced current is BiL. The work performed by this force is (in analogue with mechanics) 
force times distance, or F ⋅ x = Bi Lx. The power (again in analogue with mechanics) is 
force times velocity, or P = F ⋅ v = Bi Lv.
37-7  Pull a loop of width 0.20 m, length 0.80 m, and resistance 200 W through a mag­
netic field of 0.40 T at 0.20 m/s. First find the induced emf and current. Then find the 
force necessary to pull the loop, the work performed, and the power, the rate of doing 
the work.
Solution: The induced emf is
	
emf = – BLv = –0.40 T ⋅ 0.20 m ⋅ 0.20 m/s = –1.6 × 10–2 V

The force necessary to pull the wire out of the field is

The work performed in completely removing the loop is this force times the length of 
the loop.
	
W = F ⋅ x = 6.4 × 10–6 N ⋅ 0.80 m = 5.1 × 10–6 J	
The power delivered to the loop is
	
P = F ⋅ v = 6.4 × 10–6 N ⋅ 0.20 m/s = 1.3 × 10–6 W	
37-8  A variation of the preceding problem is one where the loop is replaced by a 
U-shaped piece of wire with a sliding piece along the arms of the U. Take a 0.60 T field 
and a U-shaped piece with width 0.30 m. The entire circuit has resistance of 20 W, and 
the sliding bar is moving to the right at 6.0 m/s.
Solution: The emf generated in the wire and moving rod is
emf = –B Lv = –0.60 T⋅ 0.30 m ⋅ 6.0 m/s = –1.1 V
The current in the loop is
	
i = emf/R = 1.1 V/20 W = 0.054 A	

FARADAY’S LAW	
319
Fig. 37-8
When the bar is moving to the right, the number of lines of flux (amount) is increasing 
out of the page, so the current is clockwise so as to produce a field pointing into the page, 
that is, a field opposing the increasing field, within the “loop” causing the current.
The power required in moving the bar is
	
P = Fv = Bi Lv = 0.60 T ⋅ 0.054 A ⋅ 0.30 m ⋅ 6.0 m/s = 0.058 Watts	
Compare this with the joule heat production H = i2R = (0.054 A)2(20 W) = 0.058 J.
C   Calculation of the total flux through a rectangular frame placed with its long side 
parallel to a current-carrying wire is very helpful in understanding how to apply calculus 
to a physics problem. The geometry is shown in Fig. 37-9. What is desired is the total 
flux in the rectangle of width b – a and height L. The magnetic field at any point x a radial 
distance away from the current is
	
B = moI/2px

Time Varying Magnetic Fields
There is another aspect of Faraday’s law associated with time varying magnetic fields. 
Place a conducting loop of wire in a magnetic field that varies with time, and make the 
field increase out of the page so that the flux contained within the loop increases, as 
shown in Fig. 37-10.
The emf generated in the loop is dFB /dt. In the wire, there must be an electric field. 
In equations involving time varying magnetic fields the magnetic flux is often indi­
cated with FB to avoid possible confusion with electric flux. Because of the symmetry,

CHAPTER 38	
INDUCTANCE
321
If two coils are placed nearby, the current in one sets up a magnetic field or flux through 
the other. If the current in the one is changing, then there is a changing magnetic field 
and flux in the other producing an induced electromotive force (emf) and current. In 
equation-like statements,
Current in one produces flux in the other.
Changing current in one produces an emf in the other.
Self Inductance
Further, a changing current in an isolated coil produces an emf in itself. This is called a 
self-induced emf. The direction of the self-induced emf is so as to produce a current that 
opposes the current that set it up.
Calculation of the self-induced emf follows from a consideration of the geometry of the 
coil. Consider a closely packed coil with a flux F passing through each of N turns of the 
coil. The number of turns times the flux is called the flux linkages NF. The self-induced 
emf is proportional to the time rate of change of these flux linkages. In the language of 
calculus, the self-induced emf is proportional to d/dt of NF, so

Equation (38-1) with the defined constant L,

(38-2)
The unit of inductance is the henry, which, from Equation (38-2), must have units of 
V· s/A. The self inductance, or inductance as it is often called, can be calculated for a 
solenoid. Consider a solenoid of length ℓ having N turns or n turns per unit length. Inside 
the solenoid, the flux is BA, so the number of flux linkages is NF = (nℓ)BA. For a sole­
noid, the magnetic field is moni, so
	
NF = (nℓ)BA = mon2ℓiA	
The quantity NF is equal to the constant L times i, so
	
L = mon2ℓA	
(38-3)
The inductance of a solenoid is entirely geometry dependent. Adding a magnetic 
material to enhance the flux linkages only makes the inductance also dependent on 
material.

322	
CHAPTER 38
38-1  Calculate the inductance of a solenoid of radius 0.0040 m, length 0.015 m, and 
1.0 × 104 turns per meter.
Solution:
L = mon2ℓA = (4p × 10–7 T · m/A)(1.0 × 108 1/m2)(0.015 m)p(0.0040 m)2 = 9.5 × 10–5 H
The geometric factors n, ℓ, and A [Equation (38-3)] are difficult to calculate in a closely 
wound coil, so the measurement of inductance is often done operationally using emf = 
L(di/dt). Most inductors, or choke coils as they are sometimes called, are not solenoids 
but short (in length), tightly wound coils. In this geometry, it is very difficult to calculate 
the inductance based on geometry, so this operational method is employed.
38-2  For a coil of 300 turns and inductance 12 × 10–3 H, find the flux through the coil 
when the current is 5.0 × 10–3 A.

Mutual Inductance
If there are coils within, or adjacent to, other coils, then we can define mutual inductance, 
the linking of one coil with another via the flux. If the flux is changing, then the current 
in the one coil is linked to the current in the other coil.
C   The simplest case to consider is one solenoid-like coil inside another solenoid-like 
coil. The voltage induced in the second coil is proportional, via the flux linkage, to the 
changing current in the first coil. The mathematical statement is

The constants are the same. The geometry is the same. These “geometric coupling con­

with 1,200 turns. The smaller coil is 2.0 cm in radius, 4.0 cm in length with 50 turns. 
Calculate the inductance.

Solution: The current in the large solenoid sets up a magnetic field within the coil of 
B = moNi/ℓ. Assume that the flux is uniform across the inside of the large coil so that 
the flux through the small coil is this B times the area of the small coil F2 = BA2. The 1 
subscript refers to the large coil and 2 refers to the smaller coil. The mutual inductance, 
in accord with the definition of self inductance, is the number of flux linkages divided 
by the current.

age times current, then the general expression for the power in an inductor is

The energy stored in an inductor is the integral over time of the power (remember power 
is work over time) or, in differential form, dU = Lidi, so the total energy stored in a coil 
(the energy is actually stored in the magnetic field) when the current goes from zero to 
some value i is the integral of this expression:

RL CIRCUITS
325
Our first look at RL circuits is with a simple word description of the behavior of the cur­
rent in the circuit of Fig. 39-1. After this general description of how the circuit behaves, 
we will take a closer look at the mathematical description. The important point to keep 
in mind in this discussion is that the voltage across an inductor is proportional to the rate 
of change in current.
Fig. 39-1
When the switch is closed to place the resistor and inductor in series with the bat­
tery, current begins to flow in the circuit. Because of the self-induced electromotive 
force (emf) in the inductor, which is proportional to the rate of change of current, all 
the battery voltage does not instantaneously appear across the resistor. The current 
in the circuit rises in an exponential manner to (its final value of) V/R according to 
Equation (39-1):

(39-1)
This function is consistent with our understanding of inductors: as time goes on, the cur­
rent rises to V/R.
C   When the battery voltage is applied to R and L in series, voltages across these 
components vary with time. We can, however, write a Kirchhoff-type voltage statement 
that is valid for all time

There are three graphs (Fig. 39-2) that describe how the voltage and current vary in the 
circuit. The graph of i = (V/R)(1- e-Rt/L) versus t shows how the current in the circuit 
varies with time. The graph of vR = iR = V(1 - e-Rt/L) versus t shows the exponential rise 
of voltage across R. The graph of vL = L(di/dt) = Ve-Rt/L) versus t shows the exponential 
decay of voltage across L.
Fig. 39-2
As an exercise, show that the Kirchhoff equation V = iR + L(di/dt) is satisfied by sub­
stituting the expressions for i and di/dt. The analysis is also verified by the graphs: the 
voltage across the resistor is growing in a 1 minus exponential manner, while the voltage 
across the inductor is decaying in an exponential manner.

Decreasing Current
Referring back to Fig. 39-1, suppose that the current has reached the steady state condition, 
the R and L are placed in series, and the battery is removed. At the instant the battery is 
removed, there is no voltage across the inductor. The circuit has reached steady state, 
and (di/dt) = 0, so L(di/dt) = vL is zero. There is, however, full battery voltage across the 
resistor. This voltage drops as the current in the circuit drops in an exponential manner 
according to Equation (39-3):

39-6  For the circuit described in Problem 39-5 operating in decreasing current mode, 
calculate the time for the voltage to decay to one-half the steady state value. Then find 
the voltages across R and L at this time.
Solution: The time constant, calculated earlier, is 0.83 s. The time for the current to drop 
to one-half the steady state value is found by replacing i in Equation (39-3) with 0.50io. 
Thus
0.50io = ioe -t/0.83 s
A more convenient form for logarithms is
1/2 = e -t/0.83 s
Taking logarithms and remembering that ln(1/2) = ln 1 - ln 2 = 0 - ln 2 = -ln 2,

CHAPTER 40
OSCILLATING LC CIRCUITS
331
In Chapter 41 and 42, we will look at LC and RLC circuits from two different points of 
view. Our view in this chapter is concerned with the transient response of the circuit, that 
is, how the circuit responds to an initially charged capacitor. In Chapter 41 we will look 
at how the circuit behaves when it is driven by a sinusoidal voltage source.
LC Circuits
Charge a capacitor, and place it in series with an inductor, as shown in Fig. 40-1.
Fig. 40-1
When the charged capacitor is connected to the inductor, the maximum possible voltage 
is applied across the inductor. This maximum voltage results in the maximum rate of 
increase in current in the circuit vL = L(di/dt). As time goes on, the voltage drops, the rate 
of change in current drops, but the current increases. Maximum current and zero volt­
age across the capacitor are coincident. The current continues in the same direction until 
the capacitor is fully charged in the opposite (from original) direction. In the absence 
of energy-consuming resistance, the voltage (across the capacitor) and current (in the 
circuit) continue to vary sinusoidally 90° out of phase.
This circuit behaves analogous to the mechanical mass-spring system, with the capacitor 
playing the role of the spring and the inductor playing the role of the mass. Voltage is 
analogous to the compression of the spring. Energy stored in the spring is equal to kx2/2, 
and energy stored in the capacitor is equal to CV2/2. Current is analogous to the velocity 
of the mass. Energy stored in the velocity of the mass is equal to mv2/2, and energy stored 
in the inductor is equal to Li2/2. Zero spring displacement is coincident with maximum 
velocity of the mass as zero voltage is coincident with maximum current.

The introduction of series resistance produces the circuit of Fig. 40-2. If the capacitor is 
initially charged (before it is placed in the circuit), oscillation will occur. The total energy 
in the circuit, however, will not remain constant but decrease at the rate of i2R, the power 
dissipated in the resistor as heat.

into Equation (40-6).

CHAPTER 41
SERIES RLC CIRCUITS 
AND PHASORS
335
Chapter 40 was concerned with the natural oscillations of LC circuits. This chapter is 
devoted to the study of R, L, and C circuits individually and in combination in response 
to sinusoidal voltages.
Alternating Currents
Problems 37-3 through 37-6 in Chapter 37 describe how a loop rotated in a magnetic 
field produces a sinusoidal voltage and current. This is the basis of alternating current 
generators. An external agent, such as falling water or steam, is used to rotate the 
loop of wire in a magnetic field thus generating a sinusoidal, or alternating, voltage 
and current. This alternating current, AC for short, has two basic advantages over direct 
current. First, it is easy to increase the voltage for transmission over long distances and 
later decrease the voltage for distribution to individual users or for specific applications 
(see the “Transformers” section in this chapter). Second, an alternating current in a loop 
placed in a magnetic field rotates, providing rotational power for all sorts of machines. 
See the “A Current-Carrying Loop in a B Field” section in Chapter 34. The basic circuit 
for the study of alternating current in RLC circuits is shown in Fig. 41-1.
Fig. 41-1
The circuit is driven by the AC source. This is in contrast to the circuit of Fig. 40-2, where 
the capacitor is charged, placed in the circuit, and the transient response studied. The 
Kirchhoff voltage differential equation for this circuit is like Equation (40-5) except 
that the right-hand side contains a driving voltage Vo coswt. This dramatically complicates 
the mathematics beyond the level for most people taking their first physics course. 
For this reason, we take another, less mathematical view of this circuit but one that is very 
helpful in understanding how the circuit operates.
The Resistive Circuit
The simplest way to start the study of AC circuits is with a resistor and AC source, as 
shown in Fig. 41-2. The time varying voltage is v = VR cos wt.

336	
CHAPTER 41
Fig. 41-2
The current tracks (is in phase with) the voltage and is i = (VR/R) cos wt = IR cos wt. 
Figure 41-3 shows the voltage and current as a function of time and (on the right) what 
is known as a phasor diagram, an important analysis tool in the study of RLC circuits.
Fig. 41-3
The individual vector-like arrows are called phasors. The diagram is started by drawing 
a phasor IR at some arbitrary angle wt. The phasor rotates counterclockwise, with the 
length proportional to IR and the projection on the horizontal axis proportional to the 
instantaneous current. An increase in wt toward the right on the graph corresponds to 
an increase in wt in the counterclockwise direction on the phasor diagram. When an 
entire cycle of a sine wave is completed, the phasor will have rotated through 360°. 
Next, the phasor representing the voltage is drawn at the same arbitrary angle wt. In a 
resistor, the instantaneous voltage and current are in phase. The length is proportional 
to VR, and the projection along the horizontal axis is proportional to the instantaneous 
voltage across R.
The Capacitive Circuit
Figure 41-4 shows a capacitive circuit driven by an AC source. The time varying voltage 
is v = VC cos wt. The phase relation between this v and iC is different from that for a 
resistor. When an alternating voltage is applied to a capacitor, the current alternates 
(flows in one direction and then in the opposite direction) but does not track with (is not 
in phase with) the voltage across the capacitor. When the voltage reaches a maximum, the 
capacitor is fully charged, and the current is zero! When the voltage reaches a maximum 
in the other direction, the capacitor is again fully, but oppositely, charged and the current 
is again zero. The current then must be a maximum when the (alternating) voltage is 
passing through zero.

The charge is in phase with the voltage q = Cv = CVC cos wt. The current is
	
iC = (dq/dt) = –wCVC sin wt	
The voltage and current are plotted as a function of time in Fig. 41-5 along with the 
phasor diagram.
Fig. 41-5
The phasor diagram is drawn starting with VC at an arbitrary angle wt. (Starting with IC 
produces the same result.) The hard part in drawing the IC phasor is to figure out how to 
orient it with respect to VC. The easiest way to do this is to look at the graph of v and i 
versus time and ask the question, “Which quantity leads the other, and by how much?” 
By looking at adjacent peaks, note that i reaches its maximum 90° before v. Therefore 
we say “i leads v by 90° in a capacitive circuit.” The IC phasor is 90° ahead (rotated 90° 
further counterclockwise) of VC.
The maximum current is IC = wCVC or VC = IC (1/wC) = ICXC. The 1/wC term plays the 
role of resistance and is called capacitive reactance XC.

The Inductive Circuit
Figure 41-6 shows an inductor driven by an AC source. The time varying voltage is v = 
VL cos wt. Again, the phase relationship between v and iL is different from that of either 
the resistor or the capacitor. The maximum voltage across an inductor is proportional 
to the rate of change of current. Therefore, the maximum voltage corresponds not to 
maximum current but to maximum rate of change of current. A quick look at a sine curve 
indicates that the maximum rate of change (slope) occurs when the curve crosses the axis, 
so we expect the current to be 90° out of phase with the voltage.

The phasor diagram is drawn by starting with VL. Now look at the adjacent peaks in 
the graph of v and i versus wt and note that v reaches its peak earlier in time than iL. 
Therefore, we say “v leads i by 90° in an inductive circuit.” Notice how, as the phasors 
rotate at this fixed 90° difference, the voltage phasor traces out the cosine function on the 
horizontal axis, and the current phasor traces out the sine function.

age is 12 V and increasing?
Solution: Look at the graphs of voltage and current and voltage versus time, as shown 
in Fig. 41-8, and note where on the graph the voltage is 12 V and increasing. This point 
(12 V and increasing) is between 270° and 360°.
The curve between 270° and 360° is a sine curve, so the angle b = sin–1(l2/20) = 37°.
Therefore, the point where the voltage is 12 V and increasing is 270° + 37° = 307°.

This solution using the graphs may appear a bit cumbersome to you. The visual aspect 
of using the graphs, however, is a considerable help in keeping track of where you are as 
you proceed through the problem. It is easy to make the mistake of finding the arcsin of 
12/20 and putting 37° into the current equation, completely missing that this is the point 
where i is decreasing, not increasing. After you have done a few problems like this you 
may be able to shorten the procedure.

CHAPTER 41
The RLC Circuit
The phasor diagrams are most helpful in understanding RLC circuits as shown in 
Fig. 41-1. There are two important points to keep in mind in the analysis of these circuits. 
First, the sum of the instantaneous voltages must equal the source voltage V cos wt = vR + 
vL + vC. Second, since there is only one current path, the current is everywhere the same. 
Voltages on the various components have different phase relationships, but the current 
is the same everywhere in the circuit. The phasor diagram for a typical RLC circuit is 
shown in Fig. 41-9. Do not try to take this in all at once. Follow along the steps in the 
construction of the diagram.
Fig. 41-9
Place the I phasor at the arbitrary angle wt. Place the VR phasor over I. The voltage and 
current in the resistor are in phase. Add VL = IXL leading VR by 90°. Add VC = IXC lagging 
VR by 90°. On an axis perpendicular to VR and I, VL and VC, add in a vector manner to 
produce VL – VC. In this example, VL > VC.
If the load is resistive, voltage is in phase with current. If the load is entirely inductive or 
entirely capacitive, the voltage is 90° out of phase with current. In this situation, with all 
elements present, the voltage is the vector-like sum of VR and VL – VC.

To obtain a better picture of what is going on here, imagine measuring the AC voltages 
of the source, resistor, capacitor, and inductor and the current in the circuit. The voltages 
across the resistor, capacitor, and inductor do not add up to the source voltage! They are 
not in phase! These voltages will satisfy Equation (41-2). The source voltage divided by 
the impedance [Equation (41-3)] will equal the current. Finally, the phase angle between 
the source voltage and current comes from Equation (41-4).
41-6  An RLC circuit with R = 200 W, L = 0.40 H, and C = 3.0 mF is driven by an AC 
source of 20 V maximum and frequency 100 Hz. Find the reactances, impedance, and 
maximum current and voltages across each of the components.
Solution: RLC circuit problems can be confusing. The key to successfully solving them 
is to follow a logical path through the problem. The current is everywhere the same and 
is determined by the source voltage and the impedance. The impedance is determined by 
the resistance and the reactances, and the reactances are frequency dependent. As you 
proceed through this problem, be aware of the logic in the calculations. The schematic 
of the circuit is shown in Fig. 41-1.

41-7  For the circuit described in Problem 41-6, construct the phasor diagram and find 
the angle of the source voltage with respect to the current.
Solution: The phasor diagram is shown in Fig. 41-10. Again, follow the logic in the 
construction of the diagram. Draw the phasor representing I = 0.058 A at an arbitrary 
angle wt. Draw the phasor representing VR = 11. 6 V in the same direction as I. Draw VL = 
14.6 V leading VR by 90°. Add VC = 30.7 V lagging VR by 90°. Complete the rectangle 
with side VL – VC and VR. Since VC > VL, this vector points in the same direction as VC. 
The source voltage V is the diagonal of this rectangle. The phase angle is determined

The load is resistive and capacitive, and (from the diagram) the source voltage lags the 
current by 54°.
After you are clear on the calculations, go back over these last two problems and 
concentrate on the logic. The biggest pitfall in RLC circuit problems is losing your way!
41-8  An RLC circuit consists of a 300 W resistor, 0.15 H inductor, and 4.5 mF capacitor 
driven by an AC source of 800 rad/s. Find the phase angle of the source voltage with 
respect to the current.
Solution: Notice that the maximum voltage is not given in the problem, yet a phase diagram 
is to be drawn. The problem is written this way to emphasize that it is not necessary to 
know the maximum source voltage to find the phase angle. The phase diagrams so far 
have used voltage. The voltage across each component is the resistance or reactance times 
a constant, the current. Thus the diagram could be drawn with resistance and reactances 
as well as voltage.
Calculate the reactances:

Power in AC Circuits
The instantaneous power in the resistive circuit of Fig. 41-2 is
	
P = vi = V cos wt I cos wt = V I cos2 wt
The average power is the average value of the cos2 over one cycle. The sin2 function and 
cos2 functions have the same shape (area under the curve), and sin2 q + cos2 q = 1. The 
only way for sin2 q to equal cos2 q and their sum to equal 1 is for cos2 q to equal 1/2. 
Therefore, the average value of the cosine squared function over one cycle is 1/2, and 
the average power is

Solution: There is no energy loss in an inductor. Energy goes in to build up the magnetic 
field and is released in the collapse of the magnetic field. Look at the curves of Fig. 41-7. 
The product vi averaged over one cycle adds to zero. A similar argument can be made for 
a capacitor.

For the resistor, the voltage is v = (11.6 V) cos wt and the current is i = (0.058 A) cos wt,

MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS
345
The discussion of Maxwell’s equations starts with four basic laws of electromagnetism. 
These laws can be described in words, but a full appreciation of them requires a 
good calculus background. Whether you have sufficient calculus background to fully 
appreciate the scope of these equations or not, our discussion, which will use both words 
and equations, should be helpful to you.
Four Basic Laws of Electromagnetism
The first basic law is Gauss’ law for electricity.
	
 ∫
ε
⋅

d

E
s
 	
(42-1)
This law states that the summation of the electric vector over a closed surface times the 
vector representing that surface must add up to the total charge contained. Visualize a 
sphere, or irregular volume if you like, containing charge. On each element of this 
surface there is an electric field vector and a vector ds normal to the surface representing 
the element of surface. The dot product of these two vectors summed over the surface 
must equal the charge contained.
The second basic law is Gauss’ law for magnetism
	
 ∫
⋅

(42-2)
The integral in this law is the same form as Gauss’ law for electricity. Again, visualize a 
surface, but with B representing the magnetic field on the surface, with the dot product of 
B and ds being summed over the surface. In this case, however, the summation (integral) 
is equal to zero!
The third basic law is Faraday’s law of induction.
	
 ∫
⋅

E
l
 	
(42-3)
This law states that magnetic flux, this construct visualized as magnetic field lines, 
changing with time through a closed area equals the sum of the dot product of the 
electric field and the vector representing the loop (around the area). Visualize a loop of 
wire normal to a changing magnetic field. An electromotive force (emf) and current are 
induced in the wire when the flux (of magnetic field) through the loop changes.
The fourth basic law is Ampere’s law.
	
 ∫
µ
⋅
=
d
i
o
B
l
 	
(42-4)
The sum of the dot product of the magnetic field and a vector representing an element of 
a loop around the current is equal to the current contained. A simple visual picture is a 
wire carrying a current with a circle symmetric about the wire and in a plane normal to 
the current. The field is constant on the circle, so this integral reduces to the constant field 
times the length of the circle. This integral is proportional to the current.

346	
CHAPTER 42
These four equations are the basic laws of electromagnetism. They are unique among 
electric laws in that they are valid for both stationary and rapidly moving charges. Now 
let’s take a look at these equations from a symmetry point of view, remembering that eo 
and µo operationally serve only to define a system of units.
Notice that Equations (42-1) and (42-2) are symmetric in that they are surface integrals, 
but the first is equal to charge and the second to zero. This difference implies that there 
are discrete charges but no discrete magnetic poles. Equation (42-4) describes a current 
of charges, but there is no corresponding current of magnetic monopoles evident in 
Equation (42-3). This is as we would expect because based on Equation (42-2), there 
are no magnetic monopoles.
Looking at Equations (42-3) and (42-4), another asymmetry is the lack of a time-varying 
electric field term in Equation (42-4). If there are no magnetic monopoles, then we expect 
no term corresponding to a flow of monopoles in Equation (42-3), but the question 
of a time varying electric field term in Equation (42-4) is not so easily dismissed. 
Time varying electric fields do exist.
Look at the consequence of a dFE/dt term in Equation (42-4). To be dimensionally 
correct, dFE/dt would have to be multiplied by a constant with the same units as µoeo. 
Note that eo(dFE/dt) has the units of current. Adding the term µoeo(dFE/dt) produces 
Ampere’s law, as modified by Maxwell.

The Displacement Current
The most convenient way to study the time varying electric field term is with a parallel plate 
capacitor. Figure 42-1 shows a parallel plate capacitor with current to the plate and a 
growing electric field producing a magnetic field. Note that the direction of the magnetic 
field for the displacement current is the same as for the physical (or real) current.

CHAPTER 43
ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
349
This chapter, especially in the middle part, is very calculus intensive. Depending on your 
course, you may want to be selective of the sections you read. If your course does not 
deal with the derivations of the speed and energy transport in an electromagnetic wave, 
you may want to pass over or skim the sections “The Speed of the Wave” and “Energy 
Transport in Electromagnetic Waves”. While the understanding of how electromagnetic 
waves are propagated is fairly complicated, many of the problems are quite simple. 
Because the understanding of how waves propagate is so important and fairly difficult to 
understand, we will develop the ideas underpinning electromagnetic wave propagation 
in some detail.
Generating Waves
There is a broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves generated in a variety of ways. 
For convenience in discussion, we will, however, concentrate on waves generated from 
an oscillating LC circuit. The circuit shown in Fig. 43-1 is an LC circuit with some 
additions.
Fig. 43-1
The LC circuit has components that produce resonance with a frequency suitable for 
a radio transmitter (a typical radio frequency of 300 kHz corresponds to a wavelength 
of 1.0 m). The energy source keeps the circuit oscillating. The inductor consists of 
a primary and secondary, with the secondary connected to a resistor. At the natural 
resonance frequency of the LC circuit, the voltage across the resistor is sinusoidal. If a 
wire (antenna) is substituted for this resistor, then a sinusoidal voltage appears across the 
antenna. This is not a complete description of a radio transmitter; it is intended only to 
illustrate that it is possible to generate a sinusoidal voltage and current in a wire (antenna) 
of finite resistance.
“Can the oscillating electric field and current be detected a distance away from the 
antenna?” Of course they can. A current in a wire produces a magnetic field, and a 
changing current produces a changing magnetic field (Ampere’s law). A changing 
magnetic field means that flux is changing in space, and according to Faraday’s law, 
changing magnetic flux produces an electric field.
“Do these oscillating fields proceed out as waves?” Yes, they do. If you were floating on 
an inflatable raft in a pool and you sensed a sinusoidal up and down motion of the raft, 

350	
CHAPTER 43
you would say a (water) wave passed by. If you were viewing a small length of stretched 
rope and the small segment you were viewing executed a sinusoidal up and down motion, 
you would say a sine wave traveled down the rope.
Likewise, if you observed a sinusoidally varying electric field accompanied at right 
angles by a sinusoidally varying magnetic field, you would say an electromagnetic wave 
passed by.
Electromagnetic waves are on firm theoretical ground. The preceding discussion presents 
only a plausible argument for the existence of electromagnetic waves.
The Speed of the Waves
Start with an antenna with oscillating current. Any wave that propagates out from the 
antenna has velocity c.
Fig. 43-2
Consider some point along x, an axis oriented radially out from y, the direction of the 
oscillating current. The oscillating current produces a sinusoidally varying magnetic 
field at right angles to x and in the plane (x-z) normal to y. Construct the rectangle 
e-f-g-h with height a and width cdt. This is a “snapshot in space” of the wave passing 
by the fixed point on x. When the current oscillations start, the oscillating magnetic 
field progresses in the positive x direction, taking a finite amount of time to reach the 
place where the rectangle is constructed. At the instant of this “snapshot,” the leading 
edge of the wave, as manifested by the B vector, has progressed nearly all the way 
through the rectangle.
Now apply Faraday’s law

, requires E · dl be integrated around a region where FB is changing.

ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES	
351
In the “Time Varying Magnetic Fields” section of Chapter 37, the area was bounded by 
a circle. In this situation, a rectangle is more convenient. Along e-f and g-h, E is perpen­
dicular to dl, and along f-g, E is zero (remember that the wave front is passing through the 
rectangular region), so the only contribution is from h-e. If, as is shown, B is in the posi­
tive z direction, E must be in the positive y direction. Positive E along h-e will produce 
a clockwise current around the rectangle and a magnetic field in the negative z direction 
within the rectangle, satisfying Lenz’s law. This verifies the relationship of E and B, as 
shown in Fig. 43-2. Integrating counterclockwise around the rectangle, the only contribu­
tion to the integral is -Ea. Faraday’s law applied to this rectangle yields
	
-Ea = -Bac  or  E = cB	
(43-1)
The speed of the wave is the ratio of the oscillating electric and magnetic fields.

Energy Transport in Electromagnetic Waves
When electric and magnetic fields are absorbed in material objects, energy is transferred 
from the wave to the material. This is true for radio waves impinging on antennas, infrared 
waves absorbed in water molecules, and microwaves transmitted into your lunch.
The discussion of energy transport starts with the energy density expressions from static 
electric and magnetic fields. (See the “Energy Storage” section in Chapter 28 and the 
“Power and Energy Storage” section in Chapter 38.) The total energy density for a region 
of space where E and B fields are present is

This last expression shows that while the B field is numerically smaller than the E field, 
the energy density associated with both fields is the same.
Referring to Fig. 43-4, the differential amount of energy in the volume with cross-
sectional area A and length cdt is
dU = udV = eoE2 Acdt
Fig. 43-4
The expression dU/dt is the energy transported per time over the area A. The more useful 
expression is the energy flowing across an area per unit of time.

Radiation Pressure
When an electromagnetic wave is absorbed by a material, charges are accelerated by 
the electric field transverse to the direction of the wave. The electric and magnetic 
field vectors are shown in Fig. 43-4. The electric field vector is pointing in the +y 
direction, and this is the direction a positive charge would accelerate. A charge moving 
in the +y direction acted on by a magnetic field in the +z direction has a (v × B) force 
in the +x direction, the direction of the wave. The Poynting vector always points in 
the direction the wave is traveling, so the net force on any charges in the material is 
in the direction of the wave.
This force can be associated with a momentum. This momentum is
 p
U
c
=
 
This is the momentum absorbed by a nonreflecting surface. For a completely reflecting 
surface, the momentum transfer is twice this value. Think of a tennis ball striking a 
surface and sticking or striking a surface and rebounding with the incident velocity.

CHAPTER 44	
REFLECTION, REFRACTION, 
AND POLARIZATION
357
In the study of reflection and refraction, it is very convenient to depict light as rays. A 
light ray represents the path of a thin beam (ray) of light. This ray construct is very con­
venient in understanding reflection and refraction, as well as images formed by mirrors 
and lenses.
Reflection and Refraction
When light strikes a surface such as an air-glass or air-water interface, part of the inci­
dent light is reflected and part is refracted. Reflection of light at any interface follows a 
very simple law. The angle of incidence equals the angel of reflection with these angles 
measured from the normal to the surface

Fig. 44-1
44-1  A ray of light is incident on a reflecting surface at 70° with respect to the surface. 
What is the angle of the reflected ray?
Solution: The 70° with respect to the surface is 20° with respect to the normal, so the 
reflected beam is 20° from the normal.
The refracted (or bent) ray is the one that enters the new medium. The angular relation­
ship between the incident and refracted ray is given by Snell’s law

where n1 and n2 are the indexes of refraction of the two media. The index of refraction is 
a property of the material. Figure 44-1 contains some index of refraction values.
In addition to describing refraction, the index of refraction is also the ratio of the velocity 
of light in vacuum to the velocity of light in the indexed medium.

CHAPTER 44
44-2  What are the angles of reflection and refraction for a light ray in air incident on 
glass at an angle of 35°?
Solution: The angle of incidence is measured from the normal, so the angle of reflection 
is 35°. The angle of refraction is from Snell’s law n

1.00 sin 35° = 1.62 sin q2  or  q2 = 21°	
In passing from a medium of lower index of refraction to one with higher index of 
refraction the light bends toward the normal, and vice versa. This is best illustrated 
in Problem 44-3.
44-3  A light ray in water is incident on the water-air interface at an angle of 45°. What 
is the angle of reflection in the water and refraction into the air?
Fig. 44-2
Solution: The problem is diagrammed in Fig. 44-2. The incident angle equals the 
reflected angle, so 
45
1
θ′ =
°. The refracted angle is from Snell’s law,
	
1.33 sin 45° = 1.00 sin qr  or  qr = 70°	
This last problem suggests that there is an angle of incidence where there is no refracted 
ray; the refracted ray follows the surface. Beyond this critical angle, as it is called, all 
light will be reflected back into the water. Fiber optic cable is made of light transmitting 
material with an index greater than 1, so light injected at the end of the cable will be 
internally reflected many times over its entire length.
44-4  Find the critical angle for a fiber optic material with index 1.50.
Fig. 44-3
Solution: The critical angle is the one where the angle of refraction is 90°. Applying 
Snell’s law,
	
1.50 sin qc = 1.00 sin 90°  or  qc = 42°	

REFLECTION, REFRACTION, AND POLARIZATION	
359
Any beam that strikes the fiber-air interface at an angle greater than 42° will be internally 
reflected down the fiber.
Figure 44-4 shows a ray of light incident on a equilateral triangular glass prism at an angle of 
54°. Applying Snell’s law to find the refracted ray angle yields 1.00 sin 54° = 1.62 sin qr, or 
qr = 30°. This means that the ray travels parallel to the base inside the prism and is 
refracted at 54° on exit.
Fig. 44-4
Now change the problem slightly by having the ray incident parallel to the base of a prism 
with the base angles 70°.
Fig. 44-5
From the geometry, the angle of incidence for the ray entering the prism is 20°, and 
applying Snell’s law, 1.00 sin 20° = 1.62 sin qr, qr = 12°. Again, from the geometry, 
the angle of incidence for the ray leaving the prism is 28°, and applying Snell’s law, 
1.62 sin 28° = 1.00 sin qr, qr = 50°. A prism bends light incident parallel to its base 
toward the base.
If a collection of parallel rays were incident on the face of this prism, they would all be 
refracted toward a line extending from the base. Further, if the incident and exit faces 
were curved, all parallel rays could be focused at one point. Two curved-face prisms 
placed base to base are a lens of sorts focusing parallel rays to a single point.
The index of refraction, or wave speed, depends slightly on the wavelength of the light. 
A ray of sunlight passing through a prism exhibits the dispersion effect, whereby differ­
ent wavelength components of the sunlight are refracted at different angles, producing a 
rainbow of colors from red to violet.
44-5  Light is incident at an angle of 35° on a slab of glass 2.0 cm thick. Part of the light 
travels through the glass and part along its original direction beside the glass. Find the 
path of the two rays, the velocity of the ray in the glass, and the time difference between 

360	
CHAPTER 44
the two when they emerge from the opposite side of the glass. The geometry is shown 
in Fig. 44-6.
Fig. 44-6
Solution: Apply Snell’s law to find the path through the slab: 1.00 sin 35° = 1.62 sin qr, 
or qr = 21°. Because of symmetry, the ray through the slab exits parallel to the origi­
nal ray. The velocity of the ray in the glass is from n = c/v, or v = c/n = 3.0 × 108 m/s/
1.62 = 1.85 × 108 m/s. Now that the velocities are known, the time difference requires 
finding the distance the rays travel. The distance a (the path through the slab) comes 
from cos 21° = 2.0 cm/a, or a = 2.14 cm. Construct a line perpendicular to the two rays 
at the point where the refracted one leaves the slab. The distance b in the original ray 
direction comes from  cos 14° = b/2.l4 cm, or b = 2.08 cm. The time for the refracted 
beam is r

Polarization
Light from a light bulb or the sun is circularly polarized. This means that if you could 
look at the electric vectors, there would be no preferred direction. The electric vectors 
would be randomly oriented in space. Polarization is described in terms of electric vec­
tors rather than magnetic vectors. A radio transmitting antenna that is vertical produces 
waves with vertical electric vectors, and the radiation from this antenna is vertically 
polarized.
Polarization is usually studied in the context of light. There are two ways to polarize 
light. It can be polarized by passing through a material that contains molecules all ori­
ented in the same direction that absorb the electric vector (in this one direction) in the 
light. These materials are called polaroids. Polaroid sun glasses are made of a polaroid 
that absorbs the electric vector in one direction.
Light and other electromagnetic waves are more or less polarized by reflection, depend­
ing on the angle of incidence and the index of refraction. When unpolarized or circularly 
polarized light is incident from air onto water, the reflected beam is of lowered intensity 
and polarized with the electric vector parallel to the reflecting surface. The refracted 
beam is transmitted with a diminished intensity and is partially polarized by the reduc­
tion of the electric vector in the plane of the reflecting surface. The angle of incidence for 
complete polarization occurs when the angle between the reflected and refracted beams 
is 90°. The geometry of the situation is shown in Fig. 44-7.

REFLECTION, REFRACTION, AND POLARIZATION	
361
The criterion for complete polarization is that qr + qp = 90°. Snell’s law requires 
that ninc sinqp = nrefr sinqr, but qr = 90° – qp and sinqr = sin(90° – qp) = cosqp, so 
ninc sin qp = nrefr cos qp, or

CHAPTER 45
MIRRORS AND LENSES
363
The subject of mirrors and lenses is difficult to treat briefly, first, because for a thor­
ough discussion there needs to be considerable attention to sign convention and, second, 
because different instructors and authors approach the subject with slight but very sig­
nificant differences that affect the working of problems.
The only way to become proficient in working with lenses and mirrors is to place the sign 
conventions appropriate to your course on a card in front of you and do problems drawing 
the rays and working the calculations. Be sure that you know the sign conventions and 
practice doing sample problems before taking any tests on mirrors or lenses. Signs will 
be your major (perhaps only) source of error. Sample sign conventions for mirrors and 
lenses are given next.
Sign Conventions for Mirrors
o is positive if the object is in front of the mirror.
o is negative if the object is in back of the mirror.
i is positive if the image is in front of the mirror.
i is negative if the image is in back of the mirror.
f is positive if the center of curvature is in front of the mirror.
f is negative if the center of curvature is in back of the mirror.
Sign Conventions for Lenses
o is positive if the object is in front of the lens.
o is negative if the object is in back of the lens.
i is positive if the image is in back of the lens.
i is negative if the image is in front of the lens.
f is positive for a converging lens.
f is negative for a diverging lens.
Mirrors
An object placed in front of a plane mirror appears to an observer to be behind the mirror. 
Because of the law of reflection, divergent rays intercepted by the observer on reflection 
from the mirror appear to come from behind the mirror. The object distance p is numeri­
cally equal to the image distance q. The image is called a virtual image because the light 
does not physically come from the image. A real image is one where the light comes 
from or passes through the image.

45-1  A light source is 4.0 cm in front of a plane mirror. Where does an observer looking 
into the mirror see the image, and is it real or virtual?
Solution: The image is 4.0 cm behind the mirror. It is a virtual image because light does 
not pass through this image point.
A concave (converging) spherical mirror as shown in Fig. 45-2 can be analyzed by rays. 
An object of height h placed at o, the object distance from the concave mirror, will produce 
a smaller image, h′ at i, the image distance, according to the formula

The minus sign in the definition indicates that the image is inverted.
Draw a ray from the top of the object through the center of curvature (C in Fig. 45-2). 
Next, draw a ray to the point where the principal axis (the horizontal line through C) 
intersects the mirror, reflecting this ray back to intersect the one drawn previously. The 
intersection of these rays defines the top of the object. Drawing these rays requires expe­
rience. Set up several situations, and draw the ray diagrams to become familiar with the 
procedure.

45-2  For a spherical concave mirror of 12 cm radius of curvature, describe the image of 
a 2.0 cm high object placed 20 cm on the centerline of the mirror according to Fig. 45-2.

curvature and the object distance, find the image distance from

  or  h′ = –0.86 cm	
The image is 8.6 cm from the mirror, inverted (minus sign), and real (rays pass through 
image).
When the object is at infinity (very far away), the mirror equation reduces to 1/i = 2/R, 
and we can say that the rays from infinity are focused at R/2. This defines the focal length 
as f = R/2.
A convex (diverging) spherical mirror is illustrated in Fig. 45-3. Objects placed in front 
of a convex mirror appear to come from behind the mirror, and they are smaller. First, 
draw a ray from the top of the object parallel to the principal axis, and reflect it from the 
mirror. This ray appears to come from the focus (behind the mirror). Next, draw a ray so 
as to produce a reflected ray parallel to the principal axis of the mirror. The extension of 
this ray intersects the extension of the first one locating the top of the image.
Fig. 45-3
The equations for concave mirrors also work for convex mirrors if a sign convention 
is adopted. Lengths where the light moves (to the left of the mirrors in Figs. 45-2 and 
45-3) are positive, and lengths on the other side of the mirror (to the right of the mirror in 
Fig. 45-3) are negative. Lengths are measured (positive and negative) from the intersec­
tion of the principal axis and the mirror. These positive and negative regions are often 
referred to as the front and the back sides of the mirrors.
45-3  For a spherical convex mirror of 14 cm radius of curvature, describe the image of 
a 2.5 cm object placed 30 cm out on the principal axis of the mirror.

366	
CHAPTER 45
Solution: Here is where we get into the signs. The focus and the image are on one 
side of the mirror, and the object is on the other side. Therefore, we take the focus as 
negative and expect the image distance to be negative. The image distance comes from 
Equation (45-1).

The minus sign for the image distance indicates that the image is behind the mirror, or on 
the same side as all the other minus signs. The plus sign for the magnification indicates 
that the image is erect (not inverted). The image is virtual.
Lenses
There are two types of thin lenses, converging and diverging, as shown in Fig. 45-4.
Fig. 45-4
The converging lens converges parallel rays to a point called the focus, while a diverging 
lens refracts rays to make them appear as to come from a focus. The sign conventions 
become more involved for lenses than for mirrors. Rather than set out a sign convention, 
we will handle the signs in the context of each problem. The relationship between image 
distance, object distance, and focal length is the same as for mirrors [Equation (45-1)].
45-4  A converging lens of focal length 8.0 cm forms an image of an object placed 20 cm 
in front of the lens. Describe the image.

MIRRORS AND LENSES

Solution: Draw a ray from the top of the object parallel to the axis and then through 
the focus. Next, draw a ray from the top of the object through the center of the lens to 
intersect the first ray. This locates the top of the object. Use Equation (45-1) to find the 
image distance. Thus

The image is located 13 cm on the side of the lens opposite the object with magnification

45-5  A diverging lens has a 14 cm focal length. Describe the image of a 4.0 cm object 
placed 40 cm from the lens.
Fig. 45-6
Solution: Draw a ray from the top of the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis, 
and refract it back to the focus. Next, draw a line from the top of the object through the 
center of the lens. The intersection of these rays locates the top of the object.
The image distance is from Equation (45-1). Thus
	
i

40 cm

   or  i = –10 cm	
The negative sign for the focal length is because this is a diverging lens. The image dis­
tance is negative because it is on the same side of the lens as the object (opposite to the 
converging lens). The magnification is 10/40 = 0.25.
The image is 0.25 × 4.0 cm = 1.0 cm high, erect, virtual, and appears to come from a point 
10 cm from the lens on the same side as the object.
Go back over the problems in this chapter paying particular attention to the signs. As an 
exercise, change the numbers in these problems and work them through until the sign 
conventions are clear in your mind. As you do more problems, the logic of the sign con­
vention listed on the first page of this chapter will become clear.

CHAPTER 46
DIFFRACTION 
AND INTERFERENCE
369
The wave nature of light is used to explain the several diffraction and interference 
phenomena discussed in this chapter.
Double Slit Diffraction
Figure 46-1 shows the setup for the classic Young’s double slit experiment first 
performed around 1800. Monochromatic light passes through a sufficiently narrow slit 
to produce a coherent source for the double slits. The coherent (in phase) light spreads 
out from each of the slits, creating an interference pattern on the screen. The geometry 
for the interference is shown in Fig. 46-1. Destructive interference occurs when the path 
length differs by one-half wavelength, and constructive interference occurs when the 
path length is an integral number of wavelengths. From the figure we can write the 
criterion for constructive interference as
	
d sin q = ml    (m is an integer)	
(46-1)
Fig. 46-1
The distance from the central maxima (opposite the center of the two slits) to the first 
bright fringe on the screen is related to the angle via tan q = ym /R. For small angles, 
which is the case with Young’s experiment, sin q ≈ tan q = q, so Equation (46-1) can 
be rewritten as

Historically, this experiment was used to measure the wavelength of light.
46-1  A Young’s experiment is set up with slit separation of 2.0 × 10-4 m, screen distance 
of 0.80 m, and distance from central maxima to second bright fringe of 3.9 × 10-3 m. 
What is the wavelength of the source?

CHAPTER 46
46-2  In a different Young’s experiment with 488 nm light, the second dark fringe is 
1.2 × 10–3 m away from the center of the central bright fringe. The screen is 1.2 m from 
the slits. What is the separation of the slits?
Solution: This second dark fringe corresponds to 3/2 of a wavelength in path difference. 
One wavelength path difference is 2/3 of the 1.2 × 10–3 m, or 8.0 × 10–4 m. This number 
now fits with Equation (46-2) (one wavelength path difference), and solving for d, we get

Single Slit Diffraction
The intensity distribution pattern for single slit diffraction is similar to the pattern for 
double slit diffraction. The geometry and analysis, however, are quite different. Coherent 
light incident on a narrow slit (100 to 1,000 wavelengths wide) produces a fringe pattern, 
as shown in Fig. 46-2.
Fig. 46-2
In the analysis of single slit, or Fraunhofer, diffraction, we will use the dark fringes. The 
slit of width a is viewed as a region where interference occurs between light at the top of 
the slit and the middle of the slit. The particular situation for the first dark fringe obtains 
for corresponding pairs of source points separated by a/2 across the width of the slit. The 
criterion for dark fringes is

diffraction pattern on a screen 1.5 m away. The distance from the central maxima to the 
second dark fringe is 3.4 × 10 -3 m. What is the wavelength of the light?

The width of the central maxima is two times this value, or 1.3 × 10 –2 m.
The Diffraction Grating
A diffraction grating consists of multiple slits, as shown in Fig. 46-3. When light is incident 
on this arrangement, constructive interference occurs when the path difference between 
adjacent slits is ml. Increasing the number of slits produces two effects: the intensity of each 
interference maximum increases, and the width of each interference maximum decreases. 
This makes the grating a very convenient tool for the study of the various component 
wavelengths (spectra) of gases.

discharge tube. Two of the hydrogen lines are at 410 and 434 nm. What is the first order

is shown in Fig. 46-4.

CHAPTER 47
SPECIAL RELATIVITY
373
The special theory of relativity is based on two postulates.
The Laws of Physics Are the Same in All Inertial Reference Frames
Inertial frames are reference (coordinate) frames moving at constant velocity with respect 
to one another; that is, they are not accelerating.
The Speed of Light Is the Same in All Inertial Frames
These two postulates lead to very interesting and highly significant conclusions concern­
ing simultaneity and how we measure the fundamental quantities of length, mass, and 
time. These discussions, though very interesting, are inappropriate for a problems book, 
so we will go directly to the consequences of special relativity as it affects our under­
standing of physics.
The concepts and calculations of special relativity require a change in how we view the 
world. Many of the things we study in special relativity may go against our intuition, but 
remember, intuition is often wrong, and even if it were correct, we have no experience to 
base our intuition on when dealing with particles approaching the speed of light, where 
relativistic effects are observable. How many of Galileo’s colleagues intuitively “knew” 
that when he dropped those two different sized balls from the Tower at Pisa, the heavier 
one would reach the ground first? Success in understanding special relativity requires 
first that you rid your mind of intuitive knowledge based on what could be called “low-
velocity experience.” As you study special relativity, you will encounter situations where 
you will be challenged to look at the postulates and change your view of the world.
Time Dilation
Time intervals are different in different (moving) inertial frames. Place a light source, 
mirror, and detector in a moving vehicle, as shown in Fig. 47-1. An observer in the mov­
ing vehicle measures the time for a light pulse to move from the source to the mirror and 
back to the detector as the distance traveled divided by the velocity of light, so Δto = 2d/c. 
The zero subscript indicates that this time is measured by an observer in the same frame 
where the event is taking place. This is also called the proper time.
Fig. 47-1
An observer in another inertial frame observes the vehicle moving at a velocity v 
(Fig. 47-2) and over the time interval of the event observes that the detector has traveled 
a distance vΔt.

(47-1)
The external observer of an event taking place in a moving reference frame, the one who 
measures Δt, always sees an event as taking longer than the stationary observer, the one 
who measures Δto, in the frame moving with the event.
47-1  You are in a railroad car moving at constant velocity of zero with respect to the 
surface of the Earth. What do you measure as the time it takes for a coin to drop 1.0 m to 
the floor of the railroad car? What does an observer in another railroad car traveling at a 
constant 25 m/s measure for this time?

This means that the correction is Δt = Δto(1 + 3.5 × 10–15) s. Time measurement this pre­

47-2  For the situation of the preceding problem, take the moving observer from the train 
to a 2,500 m/s jet plane and then to a rocket ship traveling at 0.90c. (It is common, and very 
convenient, in relativistic calculations to express velocity as a fraction or decimal times c.)

Length Contraction
The time dilation leads to a length contraction with velocity. Consider a vehicle moving 
at velocity v between two stars with one observer in the vehicle and another at a fixed 
point (with respect to the stars). The external observer measures the (proper) distance 
between the stars as Lo, observes the velocity of the vehicle as v, and writes the time 
interval as Δt = Lo /v. The time interval Δt is not a proper time because measurement of 
Δt would require synchronized clocks at both stars. The observer in the vehicle sees the 
stars moving at v and measures a (proper) time interval Δto. This observer determines 
the distance between the stars as L = v Δto. Write these two equations as a fraction. Thus

Relativistic Momentum
At “low velocities,” a force applied to a particle produces an acceleration according to 
the familiar F = d/dt(mv) = m(dv/dt). As the velocity of the particle approaches c, the 
momentum becomes velocity dependent, with the force statement taking on the form

What is your relative velocity? You also observe the other ship’s rest mass printed as

As an exercise, find the effective mass of an electron at 0.999c and at 0.99999c. As the 
velocity approaches c, the effective mass approaches infinity, implying the necessity of 
an infinite force to reach c. This shows the theoretical impossibility of material objects

CHAPTER 48
QUANTUM PHYSICS
379
In the model of the atom by Danish physicist Niels Bohr, electrons can only exist at 
certain energy levels. Another way of saying this is that the energy levels are quantized.
The Photoelectric Effect
The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a metal sur­
face as a result of the incidence of electromagnetic radiation above a certain frequency. 
The electrons absorb the energy from incident light and get ejected from the metal. The 
minimum frequency of incident electromagnetic radiation that will release an electron 
from the metal surface is called the threshold frequency.
The work function f of the metal surface is the minimum energy required to release an 
electron from that metal surface. It is related to threshold frequency by the equation
	
hfo
φ =
	
where h is Planck’s constant with a value of 6.63 × 10-34 J ∙ s.
When an electron in a metal surface receives energy from an incident photon (of energy 
E = hf), it needs to spend a minimum energy (the work function f) to leave the metal 
surface with a maximum kinetic energy given by Einstein’s photoelectric equation as
	
mv
hf

φ

Think of the difference between removing an electron from an atom right at the surface 
of a metal versus removing an electron, say, five atomic layers deep. The one from the 
surface comes out more easily and has a maximum value of kinetic energy left over 
after the work function energy has been supplied. The maximum kinetic energy of the 
electrons is independent of the intensity of the incident radiation, but it does depend on 
the work function of the particular metal and, of course, the amount of energy supplied 
by the photon.
Take the metal silver as an example. Suppose that we shine red (low-frequency) light on 
silver, and the energy in each individual photon is not enough to eject any electrons. It 
does not matter if you have 1 W of red light or 1,000 W. This is weird if you think about 
it. Light is supposed to be a wave. A greater-intensity wave should have more energy, 
but somehow this doesn’t work.
Now shine green and then blue light on silver. Still no electrons are emitted. If you go 
into the ultraviolet, finally you hit a certain frequency where electrons start coming out 
of the metal. 
48-1  Radiation with a wavelength of 200 nm strikes a metal surface in a vacuum. Ejected 
electrons have a maximum speed of 7.22 × 105 m/s. What is the work function of the 
metal in electronvolts? 

380	
CHAPTER 48
Solution: First, recall from the wave equation that the speed of a wave is equal to the 
product of wavelength and frequency. The speed of light is 3.0 × 108 m/s and is denoted 
by c. Thus
	
c = lf	
	
3.0 × 108 m/s = (200 × 10–9 m)f	
	
f = 1.5 × 1015 Hz	
We can now use this frequency in the photoelectric equation

48-2  When ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 400.0 nm falls on a certain metal 
surface, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons is measured to be 
1.10 eV. What is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons when light of wave­
length 300.0 nm falls on the same surface?
Solution: The kinetic energy of the photoelectron is the difference between the initial 
energy of the photon and the work function of the metal. It can be solved using the fol­
lowing formula.

Stopping Potential
Suppose that we direct an electron that has been ejected from metal at a negatively charged 
plate. We find the precise amount of voltage to just stop the electron from hitting the plate. 
The reason for doing something like this is to measure the energy that the electron has. 
48-3  If the work function for a certain metal is 1.8 eV, what is the stopping potential for 
electrons ejected from the metal when light of wavelength 400 nm shines on the metal?
Solution: We start with the photoelectric equation

The kinetic energy of the electron goes into the potential energy in the electric field cre­
ated by the charged plate. The potential energy in an electric field is the charge times the 
voltage, expressed in this case as eV, where e is the charge of the electron and V is the 
voltage in volts. The photoelectric equation thus becomes

Photoelectric current (or photocurrent) is the rate of flow of charge when electrons 
are released from a metal surface (emitter) and arrive at another metal surface (collector). 
Figure 48-1 shows the experimental setup and the photocurrent for two different intensi­
ties of light I1 and I2. If the collector is charged more negatively, we eventually reach the 
stopping potential where no electrons strike the collector. If it is charged positively, we 
eventually reach a steady current where all emitted electrons are collected. The greater 
the intensity of the incident light, the more photons, and therefore the more electrons, 
are ejected from the metal.

So if we have a smaller work function, then we have the same slope because h and e are 
constants. We also would have less negative value for the y intercept. The new graph

de Broglie Relation
The photoelectric effect provides the evidence that a traditional light wave in the form of 
electromagnetic radiation may be considered a particle-like photon. The diffraction of a 
beam of electrons through a thin crystal provides the evidence that traditional particles 
such as electrons exhibit wave behavior (diffraction). This leads to the concept of wave-
particle duality known as the de Broglie relation with the following formulas.
The wavelength of a particle of momentum p is given by

For a given wavelength, a photon has much more energy than an electron, which, in turn, 
has more energy than a proton.
Compton Scattering
If a photon strikes an electron, thinking of them both as particles, there is an elastic collision, 
and the photon loses some of its energy to the electron. The wavelength of the scattered 
light is different from the incident radiation. The Compton scattering equation is

where l is the initial wavelength, l′ is the wavelength after scattering, h is Planck’s 
constant, me is the electron rest mass, c is the speed of light, and q is the scattering angle. 
The quantity h/mec is known as the Compton wavelength of the electron; it is equal to 
2.43 × 10−12 m.
48-9  Suppose that we try to “observe” an electron orbiting the nucleus of an atom by using 
a light microscope to measure the electron’s presumed orbital position with a precision of 
10 pm (a typical atom has a radius of about 100 pm). The wavelength of the light used in 
the microscope then must be about 10 pm. What would be the photon energy of this light, 
and how much energy would such a photon impart to an electron in a head-on collision?

CHAPTER 48
Solution: Another neat little value you might want to remember is hc =1,240 nm ⋅ eV.

It is impossible to “view” an atomic electron with such a high-energy photon because 
with the energy imparted to the electron, the photon would have knocked the electron 
out of its orbit.
Schrodinger Equation
Because of the uncertainty principle, we cannot specify the exact location of a particle 
to infinite accuracy. The Schrodinger equation is an equation for finding the wave 
function of a system. The wave function squared gives us the probability distribution of 
where to find a particle. There are two basic forms of the equation. The first is called the 
time-dependent form, and it shows how properties of the system change with position 
and time. The solution to this wave equation takes the form
	
Ψ(x, t) = Aeikxe-iwt	
where  = h/2p = 1.055 × 10-24 J · s, k = p/, and w = k2/2m.
The second form is called the time-independent form, and it shows how properties of the 
system depend on position but not how they change over time. The solution takes the 
form

ATOMS, MOLECULES, 
AND SOLIDS

When an isolated atom absorbs a certain discrete amount of energy, its orbital electrons 
move up to higher orbits. The atom is said to be excited. The energy absorbed by the 
excited atom is then released in the form of photons, when its electrons transit back to 
their original orbits.

The energies are measured so that the electron would have zero energy if it were com­
pletely free of the atom and at rest. It is a convention that energy levels in atoms have 
negative values. The more negative the number, the lower is the orbit of the electron, and 
the more energy is needed to remove it from the atom.

Solution: We are accelerating an external electron and then having it collide with the 
electron in the hydrogen atom, transferring all its kinetic energy into the orbiting elec­
tron. For ionization to occur in this case, the transition is from the ground state (E1) to

Note that we don’t say 13.6 eV (or electronvolts) in answer to this question. That is a unit 
of energy. Potential difference means voltage. If you accelerate one electron through a 
potential difference of 13.6 V, then you give it 13.6 eV of energy. If you accelerate an a 
particle, with a +2 charge, through a potential difference of 13.6 V, then you would get 
27.2 eV of energy because the charge is double.

Solution: Figure 49-2 shows all the possible transitions. The total number is 6. You 
can go from any higher level to any lower level. Any one of these transitions gives rise 
to a spectral line. The frequency of the emitted radiation will depend on the energy 
difference.

Lasers
To make a laser, we first need to pump electrons into higher orbitals in an atom. We can 
do this with electrical energy, for example. Once the electrons go up to a higher level, we 
want them to stay there for a while and not come back down immediately. The reason for 
this is so they can undergo a process called stimulated emission, which happens when a 
photon of the same energy as the transition interacts with the excited electron. The excited 
electron comes down and emits another photon in phase with the first. These two photons 
repeat the stimulated emission to produce two more identical photons. The process con­
tinues, increasing the number of identical photons. All the photons produced are coherent 
(meaning of the same phase and frequency) and are in the same direction, and they form 
a laser beam that is monochromatic (meaning of one frequency) and highly directional.
Population inversion is a situation in which there are more atoms in a higher excited state 
than in a lower state. Normally, an atom stays in its excited state for a short time (typically 
~10-8 s). For population inversion to occur, the atoms must stay in the excited state for 
a relatively long time (~10-3 s), known as a metastable state. Thus, not every atom can 
provide laser action. Researchers searched for the ones that had the appropriate metastable 
states in addition to other factors. A summary of laser transitions is shown in Fig. 49-3.

Solution: We need to know two things to answer this question. First, we need to know 
generally how the helium-neon laser works. Second, it is good to know off the top of your 
head what approximate wavelengths make up the visible spectrum.
The helium neon laser is activated with electricity. Electrons from the external electric 
current hit the helium atom and move the electrons orbiting it to an excited state. Then 
the helium collides with the neon. We just mean that one molecule of helium gas bumps 
into one molecule of the neon gas. During the collision, the helium electron loses energy 
and the neon gains an excited electron. Energy is transferred during the collision. Now 
we have an exited electron in the neon, and the electron moves to a lower level in the 
neon, producing the red light. So we are looking for a transition within the neon that 
corresponds to the energy of red light. Remember that the visible spectrum goes from 
approximately 700 nm (red) to 400 nm (violet). Thus
	
Red light ≈ 700 nm = 700 × 10–9 m

to excite the chromium (Cr) atoms in the ruby from ground state E1 to state E3, as shown

Solution: E2 is the metastable state. The transition from state E2 to state E1 produces the 
laser light. E1 is the ground state. 
Recall that 1.79 eV is close to the value of red light that we saw in an earlier problem. 
If you don’t know this off the top of your head, you could calculate the wavelength (see 
Chapter 48 for examples). The E3-to-E2 transition is only 0.46 eV, and this would be in 
the infrared, although the transition also can be nonradiative. By nonradiative, we mean 
that the energy is not lost in the form of light, but it can be lost to heat in the form of a 
vibration, for example.

CHAPTER 49
The top of the laser level is the level that is metastable. Excited electrons need to stay 
in that upper level. If too many electrons are in the ground state E1, then photons have 
a higher probability of being absorbed rather than causing stimulated emission, and the 
laser pulse dies out.

Solution: In a solid, the atoms are closely packed. Their energy levels are so modified 
by their mutual influence that they are spread out into bands. Material A is the insulator 
because it has the largest band gap. At room temperature, electrons do not have enough 
energy to get up to the conduction band, where they are free to move around. Valence-
band electrons can be thought of as bound to the nucleus. Material C is the metal that 
has lots of free electrons and high conductivity at room temperature. Material B is the 
semiconductor. 
49-9  Is the element phosphorous an n-type or a  p-type donor if it is introduced as an impurity 
in silicon? Draw a diagram showing the lattice electron configuration with the impurity.
Solution: Phosphorous is an n-type donor in silicon. Look at your periodic table of the 
elements. Silicon has four valence electrons and phosphorous has five. The extra electron 
is free to move throughout the lattice, increasing the conductivity by providing extra 
electrons. A drawing is provided in Fig. 49-7.

(a)  On Fig. 49.9, draw an arrow to show the direction of movement of electrons as the 
two materials are brought into contact.
(b)  Describe the origin of the depletion region at the junction.
Solution:
(a)  Electrons, the majority charge carriers in the n-type material, move into the p-type 
material by diffusion.
(b)  When the p-type and n-type materials come into contact, electrons in the conduc­
tion band diffuse from the n-type material to the p-type material. At the same time, 
holes in the valence band diffuse from the p-type material to the n-type material. The 
recombination of electrons with holes on both sides gives rise to a region depleted of 
electrons and holes, resulting in a depletion region. The absence of charge carriers in 
the depletion region exposes fixed positively charged donor ions on the n side of the 
depletion region and fixed negatively charged acceptor ions on the p side. The situa­
tion is shown in Fig. 49-10. The holes and electrons diffusing across the junction set up 
an electric field directed from the n-type side to the p-type side of this depletion region. 
This junction field (or junction potential) acts against the diffusion, eventually stop­
ping it. The electric field in the depletion region is shown at the bottom of the figure.

49-12  On Fig. 49-10, draw the symbol for a battery connected so as to increase the width 
of the depletion region.
Solution: The positive side of the battery should be connected to the n-type material. 
Think of this as adding positive potential to the already existing positive potential inside 
the depletion region on the n side. This will make the depletion region bigger, with more 
charge. This is the reverse-bias condition for the diode, where only a very small amount 
of current will flow. If the positive side of the battery is connected to the p side, then the 
depletion region gets smaller, and the diode is in forward bias. 
49-13  By reference to the band theory of conduction, explain why electrical resistance 
of intrinsic semiconductor material decreases as its temperature rises.
Solution: Based on band theory, a semiconductor has a completely filled valence band and 
an empty conduction band with a small energy gap in between. Hence, there are no charge 
carriers, and the electrical resistance is high. When temperature is low, electrons in the 
valence band do not have sufficient energy to jump across the energy gap to get into the con­
duction band. When temperature rises, electrons in the valence band receive thermal energy 
to enter into the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band. Electrons in the conduc­
tion band and holes in the valence band are mobile charge carriers that lower the resistance. 
49-14  Compare and contrast the number of electrons in the conduction band and holes in 
the valence band for three types of semiconductor materials: intrinsic, n-type, and p-type.
Solution: The term intrinsic semiconductor means that there are no impurities and noth­
ing to change the balance of electrons and holes. So the same number of electrons is 
located in the conduction band as there are holes in the valence band. If an electron has 
enough thermal energy to move into the conduction band, it leaves behind a hole. The 
electron doesn’t come from an impurity atom, so every electron in the conduction band 
has a corresponding hole. For n-type materials, there are more electrons in the conduc­
tion band than there are holes in the valence band. We are saying it this way because the 
impurity atom contributes an extra electron, but there is no corresponding hole. This is so 
because the impurity atom has an extra electron in its outermost shell. For p-type materi­
als, there are additional holes. We say that holes are the majority carrier type.

When working through this chapter, you may find it useful to refer to the periodic table 
in Appendix C.
Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Radiation
Alpha particles are made up of two protons and two neutrons, which constitute a helium 
nucleus. Alpha decay is limited to very heavy nuclei. Beta radiation comes in two types. 
Beta– decay converts a neutron into a proton. The beta- particle is an electron. Beta+ 
decay converts a proton into a neutron. The beta+ particle is a positron, which has the 
same mass as an electron but has a positive charge. Gamma radiation is part of the 
electromagnetic spectrum. It has no mass and is made up of photons.

which has a half-life of approximately 5,000 years.

The total number of nucleons always remains constant in nuclear reactions. Protons can 
be replaced by neutrons and vice versa, but neither is completely destroyed. So far we 

398	
CHAPTER 50
have been using integers to represent the total atomic mass. More detailed considerations 
of exactly what happens to mass in nuclear reactions is the subject of the next section.
Einstein’s Mass-Energy Relationship
Mass is a form of energy, so it may be interchanged with energy by the relation
	
E
mc2
=
	
The binding energy of a nucleus is the minimum energy required to break the nucleus 
into its individual nucleons. Just think about a helium nucleus, with its two protons and 
two neutrons. In order to pull these protons and neutrons apart so that they exist inde­
pendently and isolated from one another, we would need energy to overcome the nuclear 
force holding the nucleons together. By supplying this energy, we would find out that the 
mass of the isolated nucleons would be a little bit greater than when they were all together 
in the nucleus. So we define a quantity called the mass defect of a nucleus, which is the 
difference in mass between the total mass of all its isolated individual nucleons and the 
mass of the nucleus when they are all together. Thus
	
Mass defect = total mass of all nucleons – mass of nucleus	
And therefore, the binding energy may be expressed as
	
Binding energy = mass defect × c2	
The binding energy per nucleon of a nucleus is its binding energy divided by the num­
ber of nucleons in the nucleus. We also must keep in mind that during nuclear reactions, 
energy can escape the nucleus in the form of the kinetic energy of ejected particles as 
well as gamma radiation.
In nuclear physics, we define the mass of a nucleon as atomic mass unit (amu) = 1.7 × 
10–27 kg, and this represents the mass of a neutron or proton.
50-4  The nuclear reaction between a deuteron (hydrogen with an extra neutron) and a

Fission and Fusion
The binding energy per nucleon changes as a function of atomic number. The curve 
representing the changes is shown in Fig. 50-1.
Binding energy per nucleon / MeV
Nucleon number, A
Fig. 50-1
Nuclear fission is the breaking up of a large nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei, 
with the emission of a few neutrons and/or other radiations. It is usually instigated by a 
neutron. The process releases energy as kinetic energy of the product particles. Notice 
from Fig. 50-1 that if we move from the far right of the graph toward the middle, we have 
a higher binding energy. This means that the smaller nuclei formed are more stable than 
the original larger nucleus. 
Nuclear fusion is the formation of a larger nucleus from two smaller nuclei, with the 
possible emission of other radiations. The fusion process releases energy. The larger 
nucleus formed is more stable than the two smaller nuclei because we move to a region 
where the binding energy per nucleon increases. The element iron is at the highest peak 
of the curve.

Radioactive Decay
A radioactive nucleus decays spontaneously (without any instigation or stimulation) 
and randomly (unpredictably), independent of external conditions such as pressure, 
temperature, or its chemical combination with other nuclei. The activity A of a radio­
active sample is the number of radiations emitted per unit time. It is also known as the 
rate of decay. The number of radioactive nuclei in a sample N is usually very large. 

402	
CHAPTER 50
Since radioactive decay is a random process, its activity is directly proportional to the 
number of radioactive nuclei present in the sample. Thus

One becquerel (Bq) is defined as the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in 
which one nucleus decays per second. The becquerel unit is therefore equivalent to an 
inverse second, s−1. The curie is defined as 3.7 × 1010 s−1, or 37 GBq.

50-12  The half-life of an unknown radioactive material is 2.8 days. How many days 
would it take for the activity from the source in a tightly closed building to decrease to 
2.8 percent of its original value?
Solution: t1/2 = 2.8 days. Activity decreases to 2.8 percent of its original value, so 
A = 0.028A0. Substitute this into the formula for activity, and solve for t. Thus
	
A = A0e - lt	
	
ln A = A0(-lt)	
	
ln 0.028 A0 = A0(-lt)	
	
ln 0.028 = -lt  and  l = ln 2/t1/2

t = –(t1/2)ln 0.028/ln 2

50-14  A g -emitting nuclide in a small source has a half-life of 60 min. Its initial g  count 
rate, recorded by a counter placed 1.0 m from the source, is 320 s-1. The distance between 
the counter and the source is changed. After 2.0 h, the count rate recorded is 125 s-1. What 
is the new distance between the counter and the source?

404

the decay contribution, the expected count rate R after 2.0 h can be found starting with
