Introduction
T
 
he world around us is full of tiny invisible living things that affect us every 
day. Diving into the study of that world is what this book is all about, and 
we’re happy that you’d like to come along. Microbiology as a whole can feel 
overwhelming, but when you break it down into parts it can be straightfor-
ward and even interesting.
Whether you’re taking a microbiology course for credit or studying microbi-
ology on your own time, we’ve written this book with you, the beginner, in 
mind. This book walks you through the tricky concepts in microbiology while 
covering the forms, functions, and impacts of microbes in nature and on 
our lives.
About This Book
Microbiology For Dummies is an overview of the material covered in a typical 
first-year microbiology course. Some courses cover more medical, molecular, 
or environmental microbiology than others, so we’ve included them all here.
In this book, you find clear explanations of
	
✓	The characteristics that microorganisms share
	
✓	The things that make microbes different from one another and the rest 
of life on earth
	
✓	The processes important to microbial life
	
✓	The diversity of microbial life
	
✓	How microbes affect us
If you’re a visual learner, you’ll appreciate the many illustrations. And if you 
like to organize material into categories, you’ll find the lists and tables useful. 
With this book, you’ll be able to explain what makes microorganisms unique 
and identify where and how they live. You’ll also have the skills to delve into 
specialized areas of microbiology that this book covers in an introductory way.

2
Microbiology For Dummies 
This book is a reference, which means you don’t have to memorize it — unlike 
your microbiology course, there is no test at the end. Use it as a reference, 
dipping into whichever chapter or section has the information you need. 
Finally, sidebars and sections marked with the Technical Stuff icons are skip-
pable. They offer a more in-depth discussion of a topic, extra detail, or inter-
esting cases that are related to the main material of the chapter.
Foolish Assumptions
We don’t assume that you have any background knowledge in microbiology 
except what may be covered in an introductory biology course. In fact, many 
of the concepts learned in a biology course are also presented here, so we 
don’t expect you to know much of that, either. We assume that you are new to 
microbiology or other science courses where an introduction to microbiology 
is beneficial, and we’ve written this will book in a way that will provide you 
with the background you need.
The science of microbiology involves knowing a bit of biochemistry, cell 
biology, molecular biology, and environmental science, so we explain those 
concepts as needed, but you may like to peruse guides on those topics for a 
fuller understanding.
Other than that we only assume that you transcend the idea of microorgan-
isms as “bad” and consider them as important members of our world, espe-
cially because they outnumber us about 200 million trillion to one!
Icons Used in This Book
Icons appear in the left margin to draw your attention to things that occur on 
a regular basis. Here’s what each icon means:
	
The Tip icon marks material that’s useful for thinking about a concept in 
another way or helping you to remember something.
	
The Remember icon highlights concepts that are important to keep in mind. 
Often these concepts come up more than once in the book.

3
 Introduction 
	
The Warning icon points out places where it can be easy to get confused. We 
usually know this because there is confusion in the general public about the 
concept or, worse, in the scientific community. Sometimes the Warning icon 
points to areas of debate in microbiology so that you don’t have to feel con-
fused if other sources disagree with our explanation.
	
Nonessential but helpful and interesting information is marked by the Technical 
Stuff icon. You can skip these bits of text if you don’t want to get into the details 
just yet.
Beyond the Book
In addition to the material in the print or e-book that you’re reading right 
now, this book also has some useful digital content, available on the web.
Some facts in microbiology are handy to have at your fingertips, either to 
study for an exam or to refresh your memory on the spot. Check out the free 
Cheat Sheet at www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/microbiology for tips on 
identifying microbes, remembering the basic differences between them, and 
figuring out the naming system used in microbiology.
Ever wonder what all the fuss is about fecal transplants or if the anti-vaccine 
campaigns are telling you the truth? You can find articles on these topics and 
more at www.dummies.com/extras/microbiology.
Where to Go from Here
We’d like to think that you won’t skip anything, but if you’re taking a microbi-
ology course right now, then you probably don’t need an introduction to the 
topic and can skip Part I. Even though each chapter can be read on its own, 
the material in Part II is essential to any student of microbiology and will 
likely be very useful when covering more advanced topics.
There are many kinds of microbiology, perspectives from which will shape how 
introductory microbiology is taught. For a human health perspective, focus

hen considering the imperceptibly small, it’s sometimes easy to lose 
sight of the big picture. In this chapter, we put the science of microbi-
ology into perspective for you as it relates to human lives, as well as how it fits 
in with the other sciences. The goal is to give you an idea of the kinds of think-
ing you’ll use throughout the rest of the book. Don’t worry, we explain all that 
pesky biochemistry and molecular biology as it comes up in each chapter.
Why Microbiology?
The question of why to study microbiology is a good one — the impacts of 
microorganisms on your life may not be immediately obvious. But the truth 
is, microorganisms not only have a huge impact but are literally everywhere, 
covering all the surfaces of your body and in every natural and urban habitat. 
In nature, microorganisms contribute to biogeochemical cycling, as well as 
turnover of material in soil and aquatic habitats. Some are important plant 
symbionts (organisms that live in intimate contact with their host, with mutual 
benefit for both organisms) whereas others are important pathogens (organ-
isms that cause disease) of both plants and animals.
Although not all microorganisms are bad, the treatment and prevention of the 
diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi have only been pos-
sible because of microbiology. Antibiotics were discovered through microbi-
ology, as were vaccines and other therapeutics.
Other applications of microorganisms include industries like mining, pharma-
ceuticals, food and beverages, and genetics. Microorganisms are important 
model organisms for studying principles of genetics and biochemistry.

Introducing the Microorganisms
So, what are microorganisms exactly? Microorganisms are actually a 
diverse group of organisms. The fact that they’re micro isn’t even true of all 
microorganisms — some of them form multicellular structures that are easily 
seen with the naked eye.
There are three main kinds of microorganisms, based on evolutionary lines 
(see Figure 1-1):
	
✓	Bacteria are a large group of unicellular organisms that scientists loosely 
group as Gram-negative and Gram-positive, but in reality there are many 
different kinds.
	
✓	Archaea are another group of unicellular organisms that evolved along 
with bacteria several billion years ago. Many are extremophiles, meaning 
that they thrive in very hot or very acidic conditions. Archaea are more 
closely related to eukaryotes than to bacteria.
	
✓	Eukaryotic microorganisms are a structurally diverse group that includes 
protists, algae, and fungi. They all have a nucleus and membrane-bound 
organelles, as well as other key differences from bacteria and archaea. All 
the rest of the multicellular organisms on earth, including humans, have 
eukaryotic cells as well.
	
	Along with the many eukaryotic microorganisms, the Eukaryotes include 
all multicellular life on earth, like plants, animals, and humans.
	
✓	Viruses are smaller than bacteria and are not technically alive on their 
own — they must infect a host cell to survive. Viruses are made up of 
some genetic material surrounded by a viral coat, but they lack all the 
machinery necessary to make proteins and catalyze reactions. This 
group also includes subviral particles and prions, which are the simplest 
of life forms, made of naked ribonucleic acid (RNA) or simply protein.

The bacteria and archaea are often talked about together under the heading 
of “prokaryotes” because they lack a nucleus. They do share a few character-
istics and aren’t easily distinguished from one another at first, but they are 
distinct groups.
Deconstructing Microbiology
Microbiology involves studying microorganisms from many different angles. 
Each perspective uses a different set of tools, from an ever-improving and 
changing toolbox. These include
	
✓	Morphology: The study of the shape of cells. It is analyzed using stains 
and microscopy.
	
✓	Metabolism: How an organism gets energy from its environment and 
the waste it produces as a result. Metabolism is studied using principles 
from biochemistry.

10
Part I: Getting Started with Microbiology 
	
✓	Growth: How an organism, well, grows. The growth of a microbe is used 
to see how quickly the population can divide and help to distinguish 
between one microbe and another. Growth is measured using principles 
of physics, as well as good old-fashioned counting. Qualitative measures 
of how growth looks are also important.
	
✓	Genotype: The genetic makeup of a microbial strain. Genes are studied 
using genetics, which has recently begun to involve a lot of molecular 
biology.
	
✓	Phenotype: The name of the observable traits of a microbe. A pheno-
type is due to the interaction between the constellation of genes and 
environmental factors. It’s used to describe a microorganism and to 
study the function of genes. To measure a phenotype, you have to use 
some microbiology know-how to see changes in growth and metabolism, 
as well as other biochemical processes for communication and defense.
	
✓	Phylogeny: The history of the evolution of microorganisms. Phylogeny 
is important not only because it helps us identify newly discovered 
microbes but also because it allows us to see how closely related dif-
ferent microbes are to one another. The study of a group’s phylogeny 
involves genetics and molecular biology, as well as evolutionary biology.
When you put all the pieces back together again, you have the science of 
microbiology. Microbiologists are some of the most creative scientists out 
there — they have many tools at their disposal that they can use in a variety 
of ways. The trick is to think up sneaky ways to study microbes, which is why 
the field is always evolving.
	
The term microbiology is often used to mean the study of mainly bacteria and 
archaea because the study of other microbes are specialties of their own. For 
example, the study of viruses is virology, the study of fungi is mycology, and 
the study of algae is phycology.

ompared with other more ancient fields of science, microbiology is a 
relative baby. Physics began in ancient times, mathematics even earlier, 
but the knowledge of tiny living things, their biology, and their impact on 
human lives has only been around since the late 19th century. Until about the 
1880s, people still believed that life could form out of thin air and that sick-
ness was caused by sins or bad odors.
As with other fields in science, there are two aspects to microbiology 
research: basic and applied. Basic microbiology is about discovering the fun-
damental rules governing the microbial world and studying all the variety 
of microbial life and microbial systems. Applied microbiology is more about 
­solving a problem and involves using microbes and their genes or proteins 
for practical purposes such as in industry and medicine.
In this chapter, we introduce the key concepts and experiments that gave rise 
to the discovery of microbes and their importance in disease. This chapter 
also highlights the many different areas of study within microbiology and some 
advances and challenges in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.
Before Microbiology: Misconceptions 
and Superstitions
Medical practices in ancient times were all heavily tinged with supernatural 
beliefs. Ancient Egypt was ahead of its time in terms of medicine, with physi-
cians performing surgery and treating a wide variety of conditions. Medicine 

12
Part I: Getting Started with Microbiology 
in India was also quite advanced. Ancient Greek physicians were concerned 
with balancing the body’s humors (the four distinct body fluids that they 
believed were responsible for health when in balance, or disease when out 
of balance), and medicine in medieval Europe was based on this tradition. 
None, however, had knowledge of the microbial causes of disease.
Opinions about why diseases afflicted people differed between cultures and 
parts of society, and the treatments differed as well. Diseases were thought to 
be caused by
	
✓	Bad smells, treated by removing or masking the offending odor
	
✓	An imbalance in the humors of the body, treated with bleeding, sweating, 
and vomiting
	
✓	Sins of the soul, treated with prayer and rituals
Although the concept of contagion was known, it wasn’t attributed to tiny 
living creatures but to bad odors or spirits, such as the devil. So, simple mea-
sures, such as removing sources of infection or washing hands or surgical 
equipment, were simply not done.
Discovering Microorganisms
Before microorganisms were discovered, life was not known to arise uniquely 
from living cells; instead, it was thought to spring spontaneously from mud 
and lakes or anywhere with sufficient nutrients in a process called spontaneous 
generation. This concept was so compelling that it persisted until late into the 
19th century.
Robert Hooke, a 17th-century English scientist, was the first to use a lens to 
observe the smallest unit of tissues he called “cells.” Soon after, the Dutch 
amateur biologist Anton van Leeuwenhoek observed what he called “animal-
cules” with the use of his homemade microscopes.
When microorganisms were known to exist, most scientists believed that 
such simple life forms could surely arise through spontaneous generation. So, 
when they heated a container, placed a nutrient broth (a mixture of nutrients 
that supported growth of microorganisms in these early experiments) in the 
container and then sealed it, and no microorganisms appeared, they believed 
it had to be due to the absence of either air or the vital force (whatever that 
was!) necessary to make life.

13
 Chapter 2: Microbiology: The Young Science
Debunking the myth of spontaneous 
generation
The concept of spontaneous generation was finally put to rest by the French 
chemist Louis Pasteur in an inspired set of experiments involving a goose-
necked flask (see Figure 2-1). When he boiled broth in a flask with a straight 
neck and left it exposed to air, organisms grew. When he did this with his 
­goose-necked flask, nothing grew. The S-shape of this second flask trapped dust 
particles from the air, preventing them from reaching the broth. By ­showing 
that he could allow air to get into the flask but not the particles in the air, 
Pasteur proved that it was the organisms in the dust that were growing in the 
broth. This is the principle behind the Petri dish used to grow bacteria on solid 
growth medium (made by adding a gelling material to the broth), which allows 
air but not small particles to reach the surface of the growth medium.

ments that

taneous 
generation.
	

14

The idea that invisible microorganisms are the cause of disease is called germ 
theory. This was another of the important contributions of Pasteur to micro-
biology. It emerged not only from his experiments disproving spontaneous 
generation but also from his search for the infectious organism (typhoid) that 
caused the deaths of three of his daughters.
Around the same time that Pasteur was doing his experiments, a doctor 
named Robert Koch was working on finding the causes of some very nasty 
animal diseases (first anthrax, and then tuberculosis). He devised a strict set 
of guidelines — named Koch’s postulates — that are still used to this day to 
definitively prove that a microorganism causes a particular disease. Koch’s 
four postulates are
	
✓	The organism causing the disease can be found in sick individuals but 
not in healthy ones.
	
✓	The organism can be isolated and grown in pure culture.
	
✓	The organism must cause the disease when it is introduced into a 
healthy animal.
	
✓	The organism must be recovered from the infected animal and shown to 
be the same as the organism that was introduced.
Improving medicine, from surgery 
to antibiotics and more
Once scientists knew that microbes caused disease, it was only a matter of 
time before medical practices improved dramatically. Surgery used to be as 
dangerous as not doing anything at all, but once aseptic (sterile) technique 
was introduced, recovery rates improved dramatically. Hand washing and 
quarantine of infected patients reduced the spread of disease and made hos-
pitals into a place to get treatment instead of a place to die.
Vaccination was discovered before germ theory, but it wasn’t fully under-
stood until the time of Pasteur. In the late 18th century, milkmaids who con-
tracted the nonlethal cowpox sickness from the cows they were milking were 
spared in deadly smallpox outbreaks that ravaged England periodically. The 
physician Edward Jenner used pus from cowpox scabs to vaccinate people 
against smallpox. Years later, Pasteur realized that the reason this worked 
was that the cowpox virus was similar enough to the smallpox virus to kick-
start an immune response that would provide a person with long-term pro-
tection, or immunity.

15
 Chapter 2: Microbiology: The Young Science
Antibiotics were discovered completely by accident in the 1920s, when a solid 
culture in a Petri dish (called a plate) of bacteria was left to sit around longer 
than usual. As will happen with any food source left sitting around, it became 
moldy, growing a patch of fuzzy fungus. The colonies in the area around the 
fungal colony were smaller in size and seemed to be growing poorly com-
pared to the bacteria on the rest of the plate, as shown in Figure 2-2.
	
Figure 2-2: 
Anti­
bacterial 
property of

Penicillium.
	
The compound found to be responsible for this antibacterial action was 
named penicillin. The first antibiotic, penicillin was later used to treat people 
suffering from a variety of bacterial infections and to prevent bacterial infec-
tion in burn victims, among many other applications.
After bacteria were discovered, the field of molecular biology made great 
strides in understanding the genetic code, how DNA is regulated, and how 
RNA is translated into proteins. Until this point, research was focused mainly 
on plant and animal cells, which are much more complex than bacterial cells. 
When researchers switched to studying these processes in bacteria, many of 
the secrets of genes and enzymes started to reveal themselves.

16
Part I: Getting Started with Microbiology 
Looking at microbiology outside 
the human body
Two important microbiologists helped shape our understanding of the micro-
bial world outside the human body and gave rise to modern-day environmen-
tal microbiology:
	
✓	Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck was the first to use enrich-
ment culture (specialized chemical mixtures that allow specific organ-
isms to grow) to capture environmental bacteria that weren’t easy to 
grow under normal laboratory conditions. An important example is 
Azotobacter, which is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium grown in conditions 
until then thought to be insufficient for life because they contained only 
nitrogen gas (N2) as the sole nitrogen source.
	
✓	Russian microbiologist Sergei Winogradsky described sulfur-oxidizing 
bacteria called Beggiatoa from a hot spring. It was this discovery that 
convinced the field of microbiology that some microbes get energy from 
inorganic compounds like hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a microbial lifestyle 
called chemolithotrophy.
The Future of Microbiology
Today is perhaps the best time in history to be a microbiologist! The devel-
opment of new experimental techniques and ability to sequence organisms 
without actually culturing them in the laboratory first has revealed diversity 
How microorganisms are named
Microorganisms are named using the Linnaeus 
system developed in the 18th century. It uses 
two-part Latin names for all living things. The 
first part, which is capitalized, is a genus name 
given to closely related organisms; the second 
part is a species name, which is not capitalized, 
given to define a specific organism. This is more 
challenging than you may think, even for plants 
and animals, and the concept of a species of 
microorganism is a slippery one (see Chapter 8 
for more information). When the complete 
genus and species name for an organism has 
been introduced, it can be referred to by only 
the first letter of the genus with the complete 
species name after it (for example, Escherichia 
coli is abbreviated as E. coli), but both are 
always italicized.

17
 Chapter 2: Microbiology: The Young Science
and complexity in the microbial world not previously known. Most microor-
ganisms can’t be grown in the lab, so they were previously unknown before 
the development of DNA sequencing techniques. Exploiting this microbial 
biodiversity for drug discovery and biotechnology applications is an exciting 
area of research. With the widespread availability of antibiotics and vaccines 
in the last half of the 20th century, infectious diseases were thought to be 
under control. The emergence of antibiotic resistance and the rapid evolution 
of bacterial and viral pathogens have made medical microbiology an urgent 
and exciting field of science.
Exciting frontiers
It’s an exciting time for microbiology because the tools available to study 
microbes have improved a lot recently. Molecular biology (the study of 
nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA) has improved so much that microbiolo-
gists are now using molecular tools in many branches of the field (see the 
nearby sidebar). These tools include DNA and RNA sequencing and manipu-
lation, which have allowed microbiologists to understand the function of 
enzymes and the evolution of microorganisms, and have allowed them to 
manipulate microbial genomes (the genetic material of organisms).
Complete sequencing of microbial genomes is an exciting frontier because 
it opens the door to knowledge about the varied metabolic diversity in the 
microbial world. Only a fraction of the many microorganisms on earth have 
had their entire genomes sequenced, but from those that have, science has 
learned a lot about microbial genes and evolution.
One interesting example of this is the recent sequencing of the complete 
genome of the strain of Yersinia pestis responsible for the Black Death plague 
in England that decimated the human population in the 1300s. DNA collected 
from excavated remains was carefully sequenced to reassemble all the bacte-
rium’s genes and showed how this strain is related to the strains of Y. pestis 
still around today.
A rapidly increasing field in microbiology is the study of all the microor-
ganisms and their genes and products from a specific environment, called 
microbiome research. This exciting new frontier of microbiology is possible 
because of advances in sequencing technology and has opened our eyes to 
the unseen diversity of microbial life on earth. Recent surveys of oceans, for 
instance, have revealed many times more species of bacteria and archaea 
than we expected, with untold new metabolic pathways.

18
Part I: Getting Started with Microbiology 
A popular focus of microbiome research is on the microbes that inhabit the 
human body. The collection of microbes that naturally live in and on the body 
are present in everyone and potentially play a huge role in human health and 
disease. Microbiologists think this is the case because these microbes are pres-
ent in numbers greater than ten times those of the cells of the human body. 
They account for up to 2½ pounds of the adult body weight and express around 
100 times more genes than we do. Research into the microbes of the human 
body and all their genes is called human microbiome research and has found 
links between it and everything from weight gain to cancer to depression.
Remaining challenges
Microbiology is still a young science, so there are many frontiers yet to explore. 
For instance, it appears that scientists have described only the tip of the ­iceberg 
for the variety of microbial life on earth. In particular, the variety of viruses that 
infect humans are not all known. Plus, the many varieties of viruses on earth are 
hard to even estimate.
The study of cures for viral diseases is still a major challenge, with viruses 
like HIV and influenza remaining a significant challenge. Viruses like polio and 
measles that have been essentially eradicated in developed countries still kill 
and disfigure children around the world in developing countries. As recently 
as 2014, India was declared polio free, only after more than $2 billion was 
spent mounting a massive vaccination campaign. However, infectious diseases 
like pneumonia are still the number-one cause of childhood death around the 
world because vaccines are hard to deliver in developing countries.
Research is ongoing into protection from diseases like malaria and ­tuberculosis. 
Vaccination has not proven effective for these diseases that hide from the 
immune system. Other strategies against malaria include infecting mosquitos 
(the insects that infect humans with the disease) with bacteria that kill the 
malaria parasite, but research is ongoing.
Vaccines are effective for prevention of infectious disease, but it’s ­antibiotics 
that are used to effectively treat active infections. After the golden age of 
antibiotic discovery came a long period of reliance on antibiotics by modern 
medicine. They were so effective in treating most infections that we became 
complacent about their use. We’re now entering the antibiotic resistance 
phase where most, if not all, of the antibiotics we now use are becoming use-
less against the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This has become such 
a serious problem that in the spring of 2014, the World Health Organization 
declared antibiotic resistance a global health crisis.

19
 Chapter 2: Microbiology: The Young Science
The fields of microbiology
Since the 19th century, there has been an explo-
sion of great microbiological research, leading 
to many different branches of microbiology, all 
of which are both basic and applied in nature. 
Here’s a list of the different fields of microbiol-
ogy that have developed since the discovery of 
microorganisms:
	✓	Aquatic, soil, and agricultural microbiol-
ogy study the microorganisms associated 
with aquatic (including wastewater treat-
ment systems), soil, and agricultural envi-
ronments, respectively.
	✓	Bacteriology is the identification and char-
acterization of bacterial species.
	✓	Immunology is the study of the body’s 
response to infection by microorganisms. 
Included within this field is the area of vac-
cine research, which aims to develop more 
and better ways of immunizing people from 
microorganisms that cause life-threatening 
infections.
	✓	Industrial microbiology applies the large-
scale use of microorganisms to make 
things like antibiotics or alcohol.
	✓	Medical microbiology is the study of patho-
genic microorganisms that cause infec-
tious disease in humans and animals and 
ways to prevent and treat infections.
	✓	Microbial biochemistry aims to understand 
the enzymes and chemical reactions inside 
microbial cells.
	✓	Microbial biotechnology is genetically 
engineering microorganisms to produce 
a foreign gene or pathway so that it may 
either make a product for human use (for 
example, human insulin) or perform a func-
tion that we need (for example, degradation 
of environmental contaminants).
	✓	Microbial ecology is the study of microbial 
diversity in nature, as well as microbial 
populations and microbial communities 
and their effects on their environments. 
This includes nutrient cycling and biogeo­
chemistry (biological, chemical, and physi-
cal processes that control the composition 
of the natural environment).
	✓	Microbial genetics is the study of the 
genomes of microorganisms, including how 
the genetic code varies between microbes 
and how genes are passed on.
	✓	Microbial systematics is the study of how 
microorganisms diversified through time. 
It includes the naming and organizing 
of microbial groups with respect to one 
another.
	✓	Mycology is the study of fungi, both in 
terms of their natural habitats and genetics, 
and in terms of their ability to cause disease 
in humans, other animals, and plants.
	✓	Parasitology is the study of parasites of ani-
mals and humans. These are all eukaryotic 
(not bacterial or archaeal) and include pro-
tists and worms.
	✓	Virology is the study of viruses and simple 
nonviral entities, such as viroids (RNA mol-
ecules that behave like infectious agents) 
and prions (proteins that behave like infec-
tious agents).

e tend to think of microorganisms as the causes of diseases (like polio, 
the plague, and pneumonia) or inconveniences (food spoilage, the 
common cold, and garden plant diseases), but the truth is that they play a 
much larger role in our lives. A balanced microbial community is important for 
the health of an ecosystem, our health, and the health of our pets and gardens. 
It’s convenient to think of the microbial world only as it pertains to our daily 
lives, but in reality microorganisms far outweigh all other life on earth in terms 
of genetic variety and the sheer number of cells (some 2.5 × 1030 by recent 
calculations).
Based on the best estimates of biologists, life appeared on earth almost 4 billion 
years ago. Multicellular life appeared 2.5 billion years later, but in the mean-
time, single-celled organisms ruled the earth. Early prokaryotes (bacteria and 
archaea) lived without oxygen — the earth’s atmosphere was anoxic (without 
oxygen) and then slowly changed to one where oxygen levels were sufficient 
to support life dependent on oxygen. The early earth also had a much harsher 
climate than the planet does today; evidence of microbes that can tolerate 
extreme conditions are still with us.
Evidence of the existence of these different organisms can be observed if 
you look at the evolutionary tree of life on earth today (shown in Figure 3-1). 
You can see that many distant branches of microbes exist. The more distant 
branches represent the amount of difference in the genetic material between 
organisms. Looking at the distant branches for microbes shows that the genetic 
diversity of microbial life is vast compared with that of animals, where the 
branches are closer together.

A microbial population is a group of cells that are genetically similar to each 
other (sometimes called a species). These populations live together in groups 
with other microorganism in microbial communities. These communities 
­interact extensively with each other and their direct environment, called a 
habitat, consuming nutrients and excreting waste. The environment is the 
conditions outside the cell and is often discussed in contrast to the condi-
tions inside the bacterial cell. Microbial communities live within the wider 
context of an ecosystem, which can include things like lakes, oceans, or for-
ests. Microorganisms have a profound effect on ecosystems, acting to cycle 
many of the important elements within it.
In this chapter, we cover two types of diversity among organisms — habitat 
diversity and metabolic diversity — and then discuss how the presence of 
microorganisms affects higher life forms like plants and humans.
	
The term diversity describes the variety of possible genes, metabolites, habi-
tats, and so on. Biodiversity refers to the variety of live organisms.
Habitat Diversity
The habitat is an important concept in biology and microbiology in particular 
because microorganisms are greatly affected by where they live. Microbial 
habitats — including soils, rivers, lakes, oceans, on the surface of living and 
dead things, inside other organisms, on man-made structures, and everything 
in between — provide nutrients and protect cells from harsh conditions. The 
more places we look for microbes, the more microbes we find.

23
 Chapter 3: Microbes: They’re Everywhere and They Can Do Everything
Every environment is stratified (arranged in layers) in terms of the degree 
of temperature, oxygen, nutrients, and sunlight present. These stratifica-
tions make up different niches to which a specific microorganism, or group 
of microorganisms, is uniquely suited. Over the billions of years that micro-
organisms have been on earth, they’ve evolved to fit perfectly almost every 
niche. They really are everywhere.
Many habitats on earth have extreme temperatures, pH, salinity, and/or acidity 
and, because of this, they’re inhospitable to most animals and plants. Instead of 
being devoid of life, these environments are rich in microbial life. Microbes live 
at the depths of the ocean and in the highest clouds. They thrive at extremely 
high temperatures, near hydrothermal vents, and at extremely low tempera-
tures inside polar sea ice. Microorganisms can be found at extremes of pH, salt, 
and dryness, but they’re also very abundant and ubiquitous at all conditions in 
between. In addition, some microorganisms are resistant to substances toxic to 
most life — the microorganisms often use these substances for energy and, in 
the process, detoxify them.
Everywhere you look, you find microbes, even in places that you may not 
expect: surgical suites, NASA clean rooms (specially designed rooms with 
special air handling and disinfection so that they’re free of any microbes), 
the human brain, and subterranean caves. For every system that has been 
designed to keep out microbes, there is a microbe that has circumvented it. 
This is because microorganisms are the masters of adaptation and because 
there are so many different microbes adapted to so many different condi-
tions. What this means is that despite our best efforts, microbes can some-
time be very difficult to get rid of.
The number of microbial cells is not the same in each habitat. Some locations 
host a large number of bacterial cells, called a biomass, whereas others have a 
large number of different bacterial species or groups. For instance, the colons 
of animals are home to maybe the largest biomass of bacterial cells anywhere, 
with estimates of 1010 cells per gram. However, the number of different bacterial 
groups are thought to be in the range of 100 or 200. In contrast the most diverse 
habitat, containing the largest number of bacterial species, is probably soil, 
with somewhere around half a million species in a gram of soil. Environments 
with mixed nutrient sources often have high microbial diversity because many 
different microbes can grow without one taking over completely. So, the total 
number of microbes is lower, but the number of different species is higher.
In some cases, microorganisms have made their own habitats and grow 
in large multispecies communities that are obvious to the naked eye. An 
­obvious example of this are microbial mats, which can include many different 
species of bacteria and archaea. Microbial mats contain a wealth of lifestyle 

24
Part I: Getting Started with Microbiology 
and metabolic diversity and are discussed in detail in Chapter 11. Another, 
slightly different type of microbial community, called a consortium, involves 
a more intimate relationship between a small number of different microbial 
species. Two examples of this are lichen and the green sulfur bacterial con-
sortium of marine and freshwater environments (see Figure 3-2).

Metabolic Diversity
Not only are microorganisms extremely widespread, but within the microbial 
world there is also an impressive number of different metabolic pathways. 
We know this because of the compounds that they consume and produce, as 
well as from the study of microbial genes found in nature. Recently, scientists 
have been able to sequence the full genomes of many microorganisms, giving 
us access to the sequences of all the genes present. This offers a glimpse into 
the metabolic potential of a microbe because knowing the genes present can 
suggest which enzymes the microbe can make and use for its metabolism.
Four broad categories of metabolic diversity include: the main energy-gathering 
strategy used, strategies for obtaining carbon, essential enzymes for growth, 
and products not essential for survival called secondary metabolites.

 Chapter 3: Microbes: They’re Everywhere and They Can Do Everything
Getting energy
There are three sources of energy in nature:
	
✓	Organic chemicals (those containing carbon–carbon bonds)
	
✓	Inorganic chemicals (those without carbon–carbon bonds)
	
✓	Light
Chemoorganotrophy is the type of metabolism where energy comes from 
organic chemicals, whereas chemolithotrophy is the type of metabolism where 
energy comes from inorganic chemicals. Phototrophy involves turning light 
energy into metabolic energy in a process called photosynthesis, and it comes 
in two main forms:
	
✓	Oxygenic photosynthesis generates oxygen and is used by the cyano-
bacteria (a type of bacteria; see Chapter 12) and algae (a eukaryote), as 
well as all living plants.
	
✓	Anoxygenic photosynthesis does not make oxygen and is used by 
the purple and green bacteria (types of bacteria that live in anaerobic 
aquatic environments; see Chapter 12).
Capturing carbon
All living cells need a lot of carbon, which is part of all proteins, nucleic acids, 
and cellular structures. Organisms that use organic carbon are called hetero-
trophs; chemorganotrophs fall into this category. Organisms that use carbon 
dioxide (CO2) for their carbon needs are called autotrophs; most chemoli-
thotrophs and phototrophs are also autotrophs, which makes them primary 
producers in nature because they make organic carbon out of inorganic CO2 
that is then available for themselves, chemoorganotrophs, and eventually 
all higher life forms. Some organisms can switch between heterotophy when 
organic carbon is available and autotrophy when food sources run out; these 
organisms are called mixotrophs.
Making enzymes
Few compounds in nature are not degraded by microorganisms. The variety 
of compounds produced by them is great and not completely known. Their 
metabolic processes are essential for environmental nutrient cycling, and 
they are the primary producers that support all other life on earth.

26
Part I: Getting Started with Microbiology 
Microbes are specialists at degrading compounds, from the simplest to the 
most complex and everything in between. They’re the only ones able to 
degrade resistant plant material (fiber) made from cellulose (building blocks 
used by plants to make their tough cell walls) and lignin (building blocks 
used by plants for rigid structure, as in wood and straw). The microbes in 
the rumen (part of a cow’s or related animal’s stomach) of herbivores and 
the guts of termites are responsible for digesting these tough plant fibers. 
Fungi and bacteria are the masters of producing special enzymes to degrade 
complex food sources (hydrolytic enzymes) including all forms of plant and 
animal tissues, some plastics, and even metals.
Secondary metabolism
Microbial products that are not produced as part of central metabolism 
and are not essential for everyday activities are called secondary products. 
Many of these products are bioactive compounds useful in interacting with 
other organisms. Antibiotics are an example of a secondary product used 
to interact with other microbes. Some plant pathogens produce substances 
that mimic plant hormones so that they can manipulate plant growth. Other 
microbes make molecules that are useful in communicating with other micro-
organisms, insects, and plants.
Knowledge of the metabolism of microorganisms can be used in a variety of 
ways. One way is to try to isolate them in culture. This isn’t always easy — there 
are many gaps in our knowledge of the metabolic diversity of most microorgan-
isms. It’s relatively easy to re-create the temperature and oxygen conditions, 
but in order to select for the organism you want and select against all the other 
organisms, you have to know one specific condition that is needed just for your 
organism of choice. Here are some other ways that the knowledge of microbial 
metabolism has been useful in the advancements of science:
	
✓	Microbial enzymes are used in molecular biology research. Bacterial 
enzymes such as Taq DNA polymerase (used for reproducing sequences 
of DNA) and restriction enzymes (used to manipulate pieces of DNA in a 
cut-and-paste fashion) have become invaluable research tools.
	
✓	Microbes are used to express animal proteins or enzymes such as 
insulin. When scientists discover that a disease can be cured or treated 
with a certain protein or enzyme, it becomes very useful and efficient for 
them to be able to mass-produce the molecule in microbes.
	
✓	Microbial systems are used as part of microscopic machines in syn-
thetic biology. To conduct further research, scientists make use of what 
we know to push the envelope of engineering and genetics. Scientists 
use microbial processes to their fullest potential to create new things 
within organisms.

27
 Chapter 3: Microbes: They’re Everywhere and They Can Do Everything
	
✓	Industrial processes have taken advantage of the diversity of microbes 
in the food, pulp and paper, mining, and pharmaceutical industries (to 
name but a few). Because some microorganisms are tolerant of extreme 
conditions, the enzymes they produce are useful in industrial settings 
where conditions can be harsh.
Because scientists don’t know all the metabolic diversity in the microbial 
world, they haven’t been able to isolate in culture a vast number of environ-
mental microbes. This has resulted in huge gaps in knowledge about all the 
microbial groups that exist. The term microbial dark matter has been coined 
to describe the vast number of microbial lineages for which scientists know 
very little (and in most cases, almost nothing). Like the dark matter of the 
universe that makes up the majority of matter, microbial dark matter is enor-
mous and likely outweighs the known biodiversity of the earth by several 
orders of magnitude.
The Intersection of Microbes 
and Everyone Else
Microorganisms that live on and inside other organisms have often adapted 
to interact with their host organism. There are different kinds of relationships 
between the host organism and microorganisms that live on or in the host 
(see Figure 3-3):
	
✓	Benign: Organisms that live in or on us and are neither harmful nor rec-
ognized by our bodies. They’re present, living happily, and our bodies 
essentially ignore them most of the time.
	
✓	Friendly: Organisms that live in or on us and are not harmful. Our 
bodies recognize that the organisms are present and also recognize that 
these bacteria are not harmful, so our bodies don’t react to them.
	
✓	Mutually beneficial: Organisms that live in or on us and provide us with 
a benefit, like making vitamins that we can’t make ourselves. We, in turn, 
provide the organisms with benefits, such as nutrients and a home.
	
✓	Antagonistic: Organisms that cause us harm, as in the case of viruses 
where our cells are taken over to produce more virus and are eventually 
killed.
Research is still being done to determine to what extent the human body’s 
immune system recognizes and reacts to the friendly, nonharmful bacteria 
that live in and on us.

Figure 3-3: 
Four types 
of host–
microbe 
relationships.
	
For every living organism on the planet, there is a microbial pathogen (a 
disease-causing organism) perfectly suited to plague it. Some microbes are 
nasty pathogens that infect their host, subvert their defenses, and wreak 
havoc in the form of severe illness and sometimes death. Other microbes pro-
duce toxins that cause nasty effects on their target. These include microbes 
that infect animals, plants, insects, invertebrates, and so on. There are even 
microbes that infect other microbes.
On the other hand, there are accidental infections that result when a person 
with a compromised immune system comes into contact with a microorgan-
ism that is common in the environment but can survive in the warm, moist 
habitat of the human body. These include yeasts, fungi, and bacteria such as 
species of Bacillus, the pseudomonads, Acinetobacter, and Clostridium.
Pathogenic microorganisms have even been found to have shaped their hosts’ 
evolution. A chilling example of this was recently discovered by looking for the 
effects of the plague of the Middle Ages on the evolution of people in Western 
Europe. Researchers found that genes for immunity were different in people 
whose ancestors had been exposed to the bacterial pathogen than in those 
whose ancestors weren’t. They also found that genes related to autoimmune 
disorders were affected, suggesting that a pathogen can have a profound 
impact on its host’s evolution.

icrobiologists know a lot about microbial cells, considering that 
they’re too tiny to see with the naked eye. Research on bacterial, 
archaeal, and eukaryotic cells (see Chapter 1) has given us a glimpse into 
how these cells are put together and how they differ from one another.
In this chapter, we give a bird’s-eye view of the structure of microbial cells. 
Then we go into some of the most important structures in detail. We discuss 
major differences between microbes — for instance, what differs between 
eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, as well as things that all cells 
have in common.
Seeing the Shapes of Cells
We know that prokaryotic cells come in many different shapes and sizes 
because we can look at them under a microscope. A description of the shape 
of a cell is called the cell morphology. The most common cell morphologies 
are cocci (spherical) and bacilli (rods). Coccibacillus are a mix of both, while 
vibrio are shaped like a comma, spirilla are shaped like a helix (a spiral, 
sort of like a stretched-out Slinky), and spirochetes are twisted like a screw. 
Figure 4-1 shows these common cell morphologies.

32
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Although prokaryotes are unicellular organisms, their cells can be arranged in 
a few different ways, like chains or clusters, depending on how the cells divide:
	
✓	Cocci bacteria that divide along a single plane form small chains of two 
cells called diplococci or long chains of multiple cells called streptococci.
	
✓	Cocci bacteria can also divide along multiple planes to form tetrads (two 
planes), cubelike sarcinae (three planes), or grapelike clusters called 
staphylococci (multiple planes).
	
✓	Similarly to the cocci, rod-shaped bacteria can divide to form double-
celled diplobacilli or longer chains called streptobacilli.
The shape of a cell is encoded in its genes. Although we generally know how 
cell shape is controlled, the reason behind the many different shapes remains 
a mystery.
	
Figure 4-1: 
Cell 
morphologies.
	
	
You may notice that some of the morphologies are also the names of bacteria — 
for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus anthracis, 
and Vibrio cholerae. That’s because morphologies are sometimes characteristic 
of bacterial genera.
	
Morphology is a descriptive characteristic — it doesn’t give you enough 
information to know exactly what type of bacteria you’re looking at or its 
function.

 Chapter 4: Understanding Cell Structure and Function
Life on a Minute Scale: Considering 
the Size of Prokaryotes
One distinguishing feature of prokaryotic cells is their microscopic size. 
The average size of a prokaryotic cell ranges from 1 µm to 10 µm (see 
Figure 4-2). Eukaryotic cells, such as those in the human body, are much 
larger in comparison and range from 10 µm to 200 µm. Viruses are smaller 
than prokaryotic cells at 10 nm (0.01 µm) to 100 nm followed by subcellular 
molecules like proteins or chromosomes that are less than 10 nm in size. 
The smallest size that is visible to the naked eye is 100 µm, so scientists rely 
on microscopes to see prokaryotic cells.
	
Figure 4-2: 
Comparison 
of cell sizes.
	
The size of a cell is actually quite important for its function. Being small 
comes with its perks! Cells take up nutrients across their surface, and those 
nutrients then have to diffuse through the cell in order to help the cell grow. 
Maximizing the surface area and minimizing the total cell volume reduce the 
distance that nutrients have to travel, decreasing the time it takes to get the 
nutrients to where they need to go in the cell.

34
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
	
The higher the surface-to-volume ratio is, the better off the cell is. Prokaryotic 
cells have found the Goldilocks size, where they maximize the surface-to-volume 
ratio without running the risk of being so small that they crowd their contents 
and impair biological processes.
The Cell: An Overview
Before going into detail on what differentiates bacteria from one another, we 
want to first look at how all bacteria and archaea, which are prokaryotes, differ 
from eukaryotes. There are distinct differences between these two domains 
when it comes to structure and cellular components. See Table 4-1 for an 
overview. The details of these differences are addressed later in the chapter.

Odds and ends of shapes and sizes
Here are some interesting facts about shapes 
and sizes of cells:
	✓	The smallest bacteria recorded are nano­
bacteria. They range in size from 0.05 µm 
to 0.2 µm. This size exceeds the lower limit 
at which scientists had once thought cells 
could exist!
	✓	The largest bacterium found, Thiomargarita 
namibiensis, measures 750 µm, which is 
almost 1 millimeter.
	✓	Unusual shapes of bacteria include star 
shaped, flat square shaped, and pear shaped.
	✓	Pleomorphic prokaryotic cells are shape 
shifters that lack a single cell shape.

 Chapter 4: Understanding Cell Structure and Function
Scaling the Outer Membrane  
and Cell Walls
The barrier between the inside of a cell and its surroundings is the cell wall 
or the membrane. Because they act as the barrier between the outside world 
and the cell, these structures need to be strong and function reliably. Cell 
walls also have to be versatile enough and distinct enough from those in 
other bacteria to give each bacterium its own identity. Several components 
make up this unique barrier for the different types of bacteria, and many of 
these differences are used to help scientists tell bacterial groups apart from 
one another. By looking at the outer membrane, cell wall, and Gram-stain 
characteristic (Gram-positive vs. Gram-negative) of bacterial cells, we can 
tease apart the many bacterial groups. Later in this section, we explain what 
makes archaea so unique.
Examining the outer membrane
The plasma membrane borders the cell and acts as a barrier between the 
inside of the cell and the outside environment. The membrane serves many 
important functions in prokaryotic cells, including the following:
	
✓	Providing sites for respiration and/or photosynthesis
	
✓	Transporting nutrients
	
✓	Maintaining energy gradients (the difference in the amount of energy 
between the inside of the cell and the outside of the cell)
	
✓	Keeping large molecules out
The plasma membrane is made of a phospholipid bilayer. Individual 
phospholipids are composed of a charged phosphate “head” group and an 
uncharged lipid “tail” group. Because phospholipids contain charged and 
uncharged components, they’re amphipathic (they can interact with both 
lipid and aqueous solutions).
	
Think of lipid and aqueous solutions as oil and water — they can’t really mix 
and tend to separate. The tails of phospholipids are hydrophobic (repellant 
of water), so they repel water such that in a solution of water they arrange 
tail-to-tail to limit their contact with it. This tail forms the inner portion of 
the membrane. In contrast, the head groups are hydrophilic (attracted to 
water). They face the outer portion of the membrane and directly contact the 
environment or the cytoplasm, both of which are aqueous (see Figure 4-3). 

36
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
The layer nearest to the extracellular environment is referred to as the outer 
leaflet, and the layer nearest to the cytoplasm is referred to as the inner leaflet. 
The hydrophobic nature of the lipids is what makes the phospholipid bilayer 
impermeable to large, water-soluble molecules.
	
Figure 4-3: 
The struc-
ture of the 
phospholipid 
bilayer.
	
Individual phospholipids contain a phosphate group attached to a glycerol 
molecule that is attached to two fatty acid tails. Sometimes additional mol-
ecules are attached to the phosphate group of phospholipids.
Not all membranes are the same
The phospholipid bilayer is common to eukaryota, archaea, and bacteria, but 
there are several differences that set their membranes apart:
	
✓	Eukaryotic membranes contain sterols (steroid-containing lipids), such 
as cholesterol, that strengthen the membrane.
	
✓	Bacterial membranes contain sterol-like molecules called hopanoids, 
which help strengthen the membrane.
	
✓	The chemical composition of archaeal phospholipids differs from 
bacterial and eukaryotic phospholipids in four main ways, as shown 
in Table 4-2. These differences are a major distinction between the 
domains.

The fat facts
The plasma membrane isn’t all just fat. It’s almost equally composed of 
protein. Membrane proteins serve many important biological functions, 
including motility, adhering to surfaces, sensing and secreting signals, and 
transporting nutrients.
A membrane protein must contain a hydrophobic region that interacts with 
the hydrophobic region of phospholipids. There are two classes of mem-
brane proteins:
	
✓	Integral proteins are insoluble in aqueous environments and are tucked 
right in the membrane.
	
✓	Peripheral proteins are soluble in aqueous environments and sit close 
to the membrane. They contact the membrane itself temporarily or 
interact with integral proteins.
Integral proteins float within the phospholipid bilayer and are able to move 
laterally, like a buoy in a lake that moves back and forth with the movement 
of the water. Proteins are mobile in the membrane because the membrane’s 
consistency is similar to that of cooking oil. The membrane is studded with 
many proteins that freely move throughout it.
Exploring the cell wall
Cells build up stores of molecules required for growth inside the cell in higher 
amounts than are found outside the cell. Water naturally wants to flow into 
the cell to balance the number of molecules inside and outside, but if the 
cell were to allow this, it would burst like an overfilled balloon. The cell wall 
allows the cell to withstand this osmotic pressure.

38
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
In bacteria, the cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, a structure not found in 
either eukaryotes or archaea. This structure forms a meshlike sac around the 
cell and provides it with rigidity. Peptidoglycan is made up of polysaccharides 
linked by peptide bridges. Polysaccharides are long sugar chains of alternating 
N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) units, which are 
firmly attached together by chemical bonds.
As shown in Figure 4-4, polysaccharides arrange like cables that encircle 
the cell and are connected by peptide bridges made of the four amino acids 
L-alanine, D-alanine, D-glutamic acid, and either lysine or diaminopimelic acid 
(DAP). Peptide bridges are covalently linked to NAM sugars. Each individual 
unit of peptidoglycan is, therefore, a NAG-NAM-tetrapeptide.
The peptide bridge can be made up of different amino acids and creates 
diversity in the peptidoglycan structure between bacteria.
	
Figure 4-4: 
The struc-
ture of pep-
tidoglycan.
	
A chink in the armor
The necessity of the cell wall for cell survival 
is a weakness our bodies take advantage of 
to fight infectious bacteria. Our bodies pro-
duce lysozyme, an enzyme that is able to split 
the bond between the NAG-NAM sugars. This 
weakens the cell wall and allows water to flow 
in, causing the cell to burst. The antibiotic peni-
cillin also targets several steps in peptidogly-
can synthesis that ultimately blocks formation 
of the cell wall and causes cell death.

39
 Chapter 4: Understanding Cell Structure and Function
Differences at the surface
Bacteria are classified as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative based 
on the results of the Gram-stain (see Chapter 7). Structural differences in 
peptidoglycan are the basis for this differentiation. Gram-positive bacteria 
retain the crystal violet stain in the Gram-stain procedure because they have 
a thick, multilayer sheet of peptidoglycan. Gram-negative bacteria, on the 
other hand, do not retain the crystal violet stain in the Gram-stain procedure 
because they have a single, thin layer of peptidoglycan.
In Figure 4-5, you can see the image of the two types of cells as imaged by a 
transmission electron microscope (A) and a schematic representation of the 
differences in cell wall structure (B).
	
Figure 4-5: 
Structure 
of Gram-
positive 
and Gram-
negative cell 
walls.
	
	
Some bacteria, like Mycoplasma, lack cell walls and are only enclosed in a 
membrane. Mycoplasma species normally live inside other cells where they 
don’t face as much osmotic pressure. Their membranes are often tougher than 
other bacterial membranes because they contain cholesterol. Most bacterial 
groups that we know of, however, have a cell wall.
The differences between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, however, 
don’t stop there. Gram-positive cells have several key features that set them 
apart from Gram-negative bacteria (see Figure 4-6):
	
✓	Teichoic acid is a molecule unique to Gram-positive peptidoglycan and 
runs perpendicular to the layers of polysaccharide. Teichoic acid is 
directly attached to the peptidoglycan and is occasionally attached to 
the phospholipids to form lipoteichoic acid.

40
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
	
✓	The space between the plasma membrane and the peptidoglycan layer 
is called the perisplasmic space and is very thin, almost unnoticeable, in 
Gram-positive bacteria.
	
✓	The peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria is often decorated with 
sugars and proteins that help the bacteria attach to surfaces and interact 
with the environment.

lipopolysac-
charide.
	
Gram-negative cells have an additional membrane on the outer surface of the 
peptidoglycan called the outer membrane, but it’s not your typical membrane. 
The inner leaflet contains proteins that anchor it to the cell wall. These 
tethers are called lipoproteins. The outer leaflet is made up of a different kind 
of phospholipid, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is a large molecule with three 
main building blocks (see Figure 4-6):

41
 Chapter 4: Understanding Cell Structure and Function
	
✓	Lipid A: The fatty acid chains in lipid A are attached to a pair of 
glucosamine molecules (a glucose molecule with an amine group) and 
not a glycerol molecule, as in a typical phospholipid. Each glucosamine 
is attached to a phosphate head group. Lipid A is an endotoxin that 
activates the immune system, causing many of the severe symptoms of 
Gram-negative bacterial infections.
	
✓	Core oligosaccharide: A chain of about five sugars makes up the core 
oligosaccharide that is attached to one of the glucosamine molecules in 
lipid A.
	
✓	O polysaccharides: Chains of sugars that extend further than the core 
region are called O polysaccharides (or O antigen). They’re made up of 
as many as 200 sugars. The type of sugars in the O polysaccharide vary 
across different bacteria.
Encasing archaea
Archaea, like other single-cell organisms, have tough cell walls that protect 
them from the environment, but they differ in that they lack peptidoglycan. 
The cell wall of archaea is most commonly made of surface-layer proteins, 
called the S-layer. The S-layer assembles from proteins or glycoproteins that 
form the outermost layer of the cell.
Some archaeal cell walls, like those of certain methanogens (methane pro-
ducers), contain pseudomeurin (pseudo = false, meurin = wall). The chemical 
composition of pseudomeurin and peptidoglycan differ in the sugars and the 
amino acids they contain. Other archaeal cell walls have a layer of polysac-
charides and provide protection either alone or with an S-layer as well.
Other Important Cell Structures
Many cellular structures are important for cellular function, and these differ 
between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Here is a list of structures impor-
tant to prokaryotic cells.
	
✓	Nucleoid: The nucleoid is the region in the cell where the tangled mass 
of genetic material, called the chromosome, is found. Unlike the nucleus 
of eukaryotic cells, the nucleoid does not have a membrane. The chro-
mosome of prokaryotes is often circular but can be linear.
	
✓	Plasmids: Plasmids also contain genetic material but in smaller circu-
lar forms that are independent from the chromosome and replicate on 
their own.

42
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
	
✓	Cytoplasm: The cytoplasm is the sea in which the rest of the structures 
swim. It’s not just water, though — it’s gelatinous and contains filaments 
that span from one end to the other, providing structure to the cell.
	
✓	Ribosomes: Ribosomes are involved in making protein and are plenti-
ful in growing cells. They’re smaller and less dense in prokaryotes than 
they are in eukaryotes. Ribosomes are made of subunits — 30S and 
50S — that are named for their size and shape. (Well, actually they’re 
named for how far they move through a solution when you spin them 
very fast, but that’s a function of size and shape.) Many antibiotics 
target bacterial ribosomes as a way of slowing down their growth.
	
✓	Glycocalyx: The glycocalyx, an extracellular polymer that surrounds 
the outside of the cell, is called the capsule when firmly attached; when 
loosely attached, it’s called a slime layer. The capsule protects bacteria 
from being phagocytosed (taken up) by immune cells. A biofilm is formed 
when one or several bacterial populations use a glycocalyx called an 
extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) to attach to a surface. Biofilm for-
mation not only helps microbes to form a niche for themselves but also 
helps them survive environmental conditions such as drought or stress 
from antibiotics.
	
✓	Inclusion: An inclusion is the concentration of a substance inside of the 
prokaryote cell. Many types of inclusions exist, such as those for nutri-
ent storage (such as polysaccharides, lipids, or sulfur granules) or those 
that have a function such as carboxysomes (for carbon dioxide fixation), 
vacuoles (filled with gas for buoyancy), or magnetosomes (which con-
tain magnetic compounds for direction).
	
✓	Endospores: Endospores are formed as a survival mechanism by some 
bacteria. When nutrients are depleted or conditions start to become 
unfavorable, an endospore can begin forming inside the growing cell 
(called the vegetative cell). Endospores have a tough spore coat, contain 
very little water, and take with them only the bare essentials to start 
growing again when conditions improve. After it’s released from the veg-
etative cell, the endospore doesn’t actively metabolize or grow; instead, 
it lies waiting, sometimes for thousands (or millions!) of years until it 
can germinate near a suitable food source.
Eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells in several ways. Although 
they contain some of the same structures as prokaryotic cells, for the most 
part eukaryotic cells are larger and more complex. One major difference is 
that eukaryotic cells contain compartmented structures called organelles, 
membrane-bound structures that usually have a special function. Here are 
some important organelles:
	
✓	Nucleus: The nucleus is the largest organelle in the cell and contains 
the chromosomes. DNA in eukaryotes is associated with DNA-binding 
proteins called histones.

43
 Chapter 4: Understanding Cell Structure and Function
	
✓	Mitochondria: Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell and produce 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through respiration. They have their own 
DNA and bear an evolutionary relationship to bacteria.
	
✓	Chloroplasts: Chloroplasts are organelles within some eukaryotic cells 
(such as algae and plants) that are responsible for the photosynthetic 
reaction.
Other important organelles include the endoplasmic reticulum (where pro-
tein is made), the Golgi body (where proteins are processed), and lysosomes 
(containing digestive enzymes).
Divining Cell Division
Cell division is a process that is necessary for microbial growth. It starts with 
a single cell that stretches in size until it separates into two separate cells, 
in a process called binary fission. Each new cell is equipped with the right 
amount of proteins, nutrients, and importantly, the chromosome, to function 
as an independent cell.
Several important events take place leading up to cell division (see Figure 4-7):
	
1.	 In preparation for cell division, a cell makes more peptidoglycan and 
membranes to support cell lengthening. In general, the cell increases in 
volume.
	
2.	 The genetic material of prokaryotic cells is typically stored in a single 
circular chromosome. The cell makes a copy of this chromosome, one 
for each cell after division.
	
3.	 A structure called the Z ring is made from the protein FtsZ and assem-
bles around the center of the cell.
	
4.	 The chromosomes and other cellular contents are distributed to oppo-
site sides of the cell.
	
5.	 The Z ring constricts inward in the middle of the cell, and the septum 
(dividing wall) between the two new cells is formed.
	
6.	 The cell wall is pinched off to complete division and gives rise to two 
new daughter cells.

The time it takes for one cell to divide into two is called the generation time. 
If E. coli is given a rich supply of nutrients, its generation time is 20 minutes. 
This means that if a single cell of E. coli is grown for an hour, it will become 
eight cells (three generations). This increase is called exponential growth and 
is one of the phases of growth discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
Tackling Transport Systems
The plasma membrane separates the contents of a cell from its external sur-
roundings. It’s impermeable to large, water-soluble molecules because it’s 
made of tightly packed lipids that are hydrophobic. Although this physical 
barrier ensures that important molecules, like those needed for energy, stay 
inside the cell it also creates a challenge to cells when they want to bring 
things into the cell (such as sugars, amino acids, or ions). To make things 
more difficult, nutrients are often present in very low concentrations and 
hard to scavenge.

45
 Chapter 4: Understanding Cell Structure and Function
Cells are able to take up nutrients from the environment thanks to membrane-
spanning transporter proteins. Different types of transporters are required 
to transport the wide range of nutrients that cells need, but this often comes 
at an energy cost because the cell must build up internal stores at higher 
concentrations than those found in the environment. Nevertheless, it’s worth 
the price because these nutrients are vital for survival.
Coasting with the current: Passive 
transport
Passive transport is the movement of molecules from an area of a high concen-
tration to an area of a lower concentration until equilibrium is reached (see 
Figure 4-8). Imagine that you’re kayaking in a river and you stop paddling. 
Your kayak will travel in the direction of the current and slow to a stop once 
you reach a calm area. You don’t have to use your paddle. Similarly, passive 
transport doesn’t require energy from the cell.
	
Figure 4-8: 
Mechanisms 
of transport 
across the 
membrane.
	

46
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Passive transport is called diffusion and there are two kinds:
	
✓	Passive diffusion is passage of some small, uncharged molecules, like 
CO2, O2, and H2O, through the membrane.
	
✓	Facilitated diffusion involves a carrier protein that allows passive trans-
port of larger molecules, such as glycerol, across the membrane.
Upstream paddle: Active transport
Active transport is the movement of molecules against a concentration gradient 
and requires energy from the cell (refer to Figure 4-8). In this case, you need 
to do a lot of paddling in your kayak if you want to go upstream! These types 
of transporters are usually specific for the molecule or ion they need to trans-
port. This specificity helps the cell to maintain optimal levels of each molecule 
or ion. Here are some active transport systems:
	
✓	Antiports and symports: Antiports and symports use energy from the 
proton motive force of the cell to drive transport molecules into the cell. 
As the names suggest, antiports transport a molecule and a proton in the 
opposite direction, whereas symports transport a molecule and a proton 
in the same direction.
	
✓	Group transport: Group transport involves enzymes that chemically 
modify a substrate as it is transported into the cell. Energy in the form of 
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) provides a phosphate group that is trans-
ferred to incoming sugars, such as glucose.
	
✓	ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters: ABC transporters have high 
specificity for the substrate they transport. Transport begins when 
a substrate-binding protein found either in the periplasm (the area 
between the inner and outer membranes) of Gram-negative bacteria or 
attached to the outside membrane of Gram-positive bacteria, binds with 
high affinity to its substrate. With the substrate in hand, it docks on a 
transporter that spans the membrane. Inside the cell, the transporter 
recruits two molecules of ATP for energy as the solute is transported 
across the membrane.
Keeping things clean with efflux pumps
Sometimes cells accumulate substances that interfere with their regular func-
tion. To get rid of these unwanted substances, protein transporters work as 
efflux pumps to send molecules outside the cell. Some efflux pumps are selec-
tive to the molecule they export, while others are able to export a variety of 

47
 Chapter 4: Understanding Cell Structure and Function
unrelated molecules. In both cases, efflux pumps must use energy (ATP). The 
types of toxins that a cell may export include dyes, detergents, host-derived 
antimicrobials, and antibiotics.
	
Transport proteins allow flow between contents within a cell and the environ-
ment, but it’s important that the exchange of molecules is regulated — it’s a 
waste of energy to transport nutrients if they’re not needed. The cell makes 
transporters when it senses that it’s low in supply of a specific nutrient. 
Because transporters are selective for the substrate they transport, they help 
build that supply back up, and when their work is done, they’re no longer 
made.
Getting Around with Locomotion
Some microbial cells are stationary, but most of them have a means of getting 
around, called locomotion. Flagella are important for movement. They propel 
the cell forward or backward. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have them, 
but they’re more complex in eukaryotes. In prokaryotic cells, flagella spin 
around and propel the cells very quickly; in eukaryotic cells, they move in a 
wave motion and propel the cells more slowly. The different kinds of flagellar 
arrangement on bacterial cells are shown in Figure 4-9.
	
Figure 4-9: 
Flagellum

and place-
ment on

cells.
	

48
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Bacteria without flagella can also move around by a type of motion called 
gliding. In some bacteria, gliding is done by secreting slime that sticks to a 
surface and on which the cell can slide. Another method used is pili, which 
are thin, hairlike projections on the surface of bacterial cells, to twitch across 
a surface. Still others glide by some unknown method.
Microbes often move toward or away from something based on the chemical 
gradient nearby in a process called taxes. Both chemical gradients (oxygen or 
sugar) and photogradients (light) can induce taxes, which is also considered 
a type of microbial communication.
Bailing themselves out
Efflux pumps of human pathogens are of major 
concern in a clinical setting because they’re 
able to pump antibiotics out of the cell, making 
the pathogen resistant to the drug. These pumps 
are referred to as multi-drug resistance (MDR) 
efflux pumps because they’re typically able to 
export more than one type of antibiotic. This 
leaves the doctor with few options for ­treating 
an infection. Normally, MDR efflux pumps are 
expressed at low levels and can’t pump out 
antibiotics fast enough to prevent them from 
doing damage. However, many pathogens 
that are antibiotic resistant contain genetic 
mutations in and around the genes encoding 
MDR efflux pumps so that they’re expressed in 
high levels all the time. Examples of antibiotic-
resistant pathogens that have these muta-
tions include Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
Staphylococcus aureus.

etabolism, in essence, is all the steps involved in consuming something 
and using the energy from it to make the building blocks you need to 
survive and thrive. For some microbes, this means living on things we might 
expect, like sugars; for other microbes, it means living on things we wouldn’t 
normally consider food, like petroleum.
Microorganisms are great at breaking things down. In fact, the vastness 
of metabolic diversity in the microbial world isn’t even completely known. 
Microbes are very frugal and, in the end, nothing is ever wasted. One 
microbe’s trash is another microbe’s treasure!
In this chapter, we cover the common thread of all life — energy! We explain 
how tiny microbes turn the wheels of metabolism by extracting energy from 
fuel sources and making the things they need to survive.
Converting with Enzymes
If you imagine the microbial cell as a small factory, then the enzymes are the 
robots doing all the work. Enzymes are special proteins that are very good 
at converting things from one form to another. They do this by kicking off 
the chemical reactions needed for the conversion. The kinds of enzymes a 
microbe makes determine what type of metabolism the microbe will use to 
harness energy and grow.
Chemical reactions are at the heart of all cellular processes. Although you 
can’t see them happening, chemical reactions power all living things and 
many forces of nature. In science, these chemical reactions are written as 

50
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
equations with substances going into the reaction (the substrates) on one side 
of an arrow and the results coming out of the reaction (the products) on the 
other side of the arrow, like this:
Substrate 1 + Substrate 2 → Product
Not all chemical reactions have the same number of substrates and products 
as the example above, but they always have substrates going in and products 
coming out.
	
Chemical reactions are always accompanied by a change in energy. The 
substrates and products contain different amounts of energy. The difference 
between the amount of energy contained within the substrates and the 
amount of energy contained within the products determines whether energy 
needs to be put in or is released during the reaction. Reactions that consume 
energy are called endergonic; reactions that release energy are called 
exergonic. The energy released from an exergonic reaction can either be 
stored for later use or be used right away to power an endergonic reaction.
Biologically important chemical reactions are needed for every process in the 
cell, but by themselves, the substrates in the cell would react so slowly that life 
would grind to a halt. Catalysts keep chemical reactions moving along quickly.
	
A catalyst is a protein (or sometimes an RNA) molecule that speeds up the rate 
of a chemical reaction without interfering in the reaction in any other way.
In the cell, these catalysts are called enzymes and they work by bringing sub-
strates into close proximity with one another and by bending them into the 
right shape so they can react with one another and form products. Enzymes 
are usually much bigger than the substrates and the products of the reaction 
they catalyze. Enzymes have a pocket specifically for the substrates and the 
products to fit inside of, called an active site. Lysozyme (shown in Figure 5-1) 
is much bigger than its substrate, peptidoglycan, which fits into its active site 
and is cleaved (split) into two sugars.
Enzymes are usually specific to one reaction or one group of similar reactions. 
Another interesting thing about enzymes and the reactions they catalyze is 
that most are reversible. That means that the products made in a reaction can 
recombine to re-form the substrates with the help of the same enzyme, as long 
as the energy change is reversed as well. If the reaction produces or requires 
a lot of energy, there is usually a different enzyme for each direction of the 
reaction.
Coenzymes are small molecules that associate with an enzyme and help in 
its function but aren’t a substrate. NAD+/NADH is an example of a coenzyme 
that can associate with many different enzymes and helps with electron 

51

transfer (see the “Donating and accepting electrons” section, later in this 
chapter). Prosthetic groups, on the other hand, are small molecules that bind 
permanently and are essential to the enzyme’s activity.

In Charge of Energy: Oxidation 
and Reduction
Energy can’t be created or destroyed, so it has to be passed around. Within 
the cell, energy is reused and recycled very efficiently. The same is true out-
side the cell, where energy is stored in everything, including leaves and rocks 
on the ground. The trick is getting energy out from where it’s stored.
Another way of thinking about energy is to think about electrons, which are 
the negatively charged part of atoms. Electrons are essentially carriers of 
energy that are able to be conveniently passed from one molecule to another. 
So, for microbes, passing electrons around between molecules — called 
oxidation and reduction — is important for gathering energy.
Most of the energy generated for living comes from oxidation and reduction 
reactions. Oxidation used to be thought of as a molecule combining with 
oxygen (hence, its name), and reduction was the return of that molecule 

52
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
to its original state. We now know that it’s actually all about the transfer of 
electrons from one substance to another. When electrons are given from sub-
stance A to substance B, A is the electron donor, which is oxidized, and B is 
the electron acceptor, which is reduced.
	
An easy way to remember this process is with the mnemonic OIL RIG, which 
stands for “Oxidation Is the Loss of electrons, and Reduction Is the Gain of 
electrons.”
	
When it comes to oxidation and reduction, keep in mind the following:
	
✓	It’s not only about electrons. When a substance is oxidized, it loses 
electrons, but it can also lose a proton (H+). When a compound loses an 
electron and a proton, it’s actually losing a hydrogen atom (H). Likewise, 
when a substance is reduced, it can gain a proton.
	
✓	There’s some give and take. Most substances are flexible and can act as 
an electron donor in one situation and an electron acceptor in another 
situation. But often each substance has a preference for one or the other.
	
✓	Donors and acceptors come in pairs. If a substance is oxidized, the 
electrons lost don’t just hang around in solution but are transferred 
to an electron acceptor. This is called a redox reaction, because all 
instances of oxidation or reduction happen in pairs.
Redox reactions happen continuously, as long as electron donors and electron 
acceptors are available, and the energy obtained can power other reactions 
in the microbial cell. Whether the energy is to be stored for the short term or 
the long term determines what kind of molecule will be used to transfer this 
energy.
Donating and accepting electrons
Substances have different tendencies to donate or accept electrons. When 
a really good donor meets a great acceptor, the chemical reaction releases 
a lot of energy. Oxygen (O2) is the best electron acceptor and is used in 
many aerobic reactions (reactions with oxygen). Hydrogen gas (H2) is a good 
electron donor. When O2 and H2 are combined, along with a catalyst, water 
(H2O) is formed. This example of a redox reaction can be written like this:
H2 + ½ O2 → H2O
	
A redox reaction is one in which all instances of oxidation and reduction 
happen in pairs.

53
 Chapter 5: Making Sense of Metabolism
Notice that the reaction has to balance — the total number of atoms of hydrogen 
and oxygen on one side of the reaction are the same as the number in water on 
the other side. Balancing the redox reaction is crucial to all biochemical reac-
tions in the cell and can create interesting challenges for microorganisms that 
live in anaerobic environments (environments without oxygen).
Oxygen and hydrogen are at either end of the spectrum of electron acceptors 
and donors, but there are many substances in between than can readily 
accept electrons in one situation and donate them in another.
Cells need a lot of primary electron donors and final electron acceptors on hand 
for the number of chemical reactions going on all the time. In reality, there aren’t 
always unlimited amounts of electron donors and electron acceptors around. 
And this is where electron carriers come in. These convenient little molecules 
go about accepting electrons and protons (H+), which they then donate to 
another reaction. Figure 5-2 shows NAD+/NADH, which is an electron carrier 
that is reduced (to NADH) in one reaction after which it is oxidized (to NAD+) in 
another reaction. Electron carriers like this one help increase the productivity 
of the cell by linking incompatible redox donors and acceptors; because they’re 
recycled over and over, the cell only needs a small amount of each one.

Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Bargaining with energy-rich compounds
Energy can be stored in the chemical bonds within molecules in the cell, but 
not all chemical bonds are equally energetic. When broken, some bonds will 
release more energy than others. A phosphate is a phosphorus atom bonded 
to three oxygen atoms (PO3). When it’s bonded to another molecule, the 
bond between them is called a phosphate bond. Breaking the phosphate bond 
releases a lot of energy.
	
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has two high-energy phosphate bonds and is 
the main form of energy currency in the cell. ATP is essential for transferring 
energy from highly exergonic (energy-releasing) reactions to endergonic 
(energy-consuming) ones.
	
For example, when one molecule of glucose is broken down by the cell for fuel, 
it releases way too much energy to be used all at once (around 2,800 kilojoules 
[kJ]), so the formation of many ATP molecules (carrying about 32 kJ each) can 
be used as a way to transfer this energy to be used to do work elsewhere.
Molecules containing high-energy bonds are themselves energy-rich com-
pounds. These energy-rich compounds are the cell’s currency — they can be 
used to power energy-consuming biochemical reactions.
Another important group of energy-rich molecules are those derived from 
coenzyme A. One example of these is acetyl-CoA, which has an energy-rich 
sulfur-containing thioester bond instead of phosphate bonds. The energy 
released from the breakdown of acetyl-CoA is just enough to make a phosphate 
bond in ATP. Although used for all types of metabolism, these molecules are 
Metabolic diversity: The example of syntrophs
When it comes to the different kinds of redox 
reactions, the possibilities seem endless — and 
this enables a great amount of metabolic diver-
sity in the microbial world. One example of 
an ingenious microbial lifestyle is syntrophy, 
where two species of bacteria cooperate to 
break down a substance. The key to syntrophy 
is the transfer of hydrogen gas (H2) between 
the two species, where one member makes 
H2 and the other consumes it. Because H2 is 
such a good electron donor, it’s always in huge 
demand, especially in anaerobic environments. 
The syntrophic bacteria Syntrophomonas 
takes advantage of this fact by partnering up 
with an H2-consuming bacteria (of which there 
are many). Syntrophomonas lives by fatty-acid 
oxidation, which releases H2, but the reaction 
is energetically unfavorable. It’s only when an 
H2-consuming bacteria creates a demand for 
H2 that fatty-acid oxidation can go ahead. And 
because of this mutually beneficial arrange-
ment, Syntrophomonas is able to survive.

55
 Chapter 5: Making Sense of Metabolism
essential for microbes that rely on a type of anaerobic metabolism called 
fermentation, where food is broken down in the absence of oxygen.
Both ATP and acetyl-CoA are short-term storage molecules — they’re usually 
used to power other reactions relatively quickly. For longer-term energy 
storage, microbes put their energy reserves elsewhere.
Storing energy for later
Long-term storage of energy within the cell is done by producing insoluble 
molecules called polymers. Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) make things 
like glycogen, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate, or polyhydroxyalkanoates, whereas 
eukaryotes make starch and fats (see Figure 5-3). The goal is to produce 
energy reserves that the cell can store; then, during leaner times, these poly-
mers can be broken down to yield ATP.

Storage 
molecules.
	

56
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Breaking Down Catabolism
Catabolism (the breakdown of compounds for energy conservation) can 
happen in different ways for different types of microorganisms. In chemoor-
ganotrophs (organisms that derive their energy from organic compounds), 
there are two forms of catabolic metabolism: fermentation and respiration.
Fermentation is a form of anaerobic catabolism (in the absence of O2) where 
the organic substrate acts as both the electron donor and the electron accep-
tor. Here, ATP is made from energy-rich reaction intermediates through a pro-
cess called substrate-level phosphorylation.
Respiration can occur in the presence or absence of oxygen. During aerobic 
respiration, O2 acts as the terminal electron acceptor and ATP is formed at 
the expense of the proton motive force by a process called oxidative phosphor-
ylation. In the absence of oxygen, respiration can also happen if an O2 alterna-
tive is present to act as the terminal electron acceptor. In that case, it’s called 
anaerobic respiration.
Although fermentation produces less ATP than respiration does, in anoxic 
(oxygen-free) conditions, microbes that can use fermentation have a lot of 
flexibility in terms of which foods they can break down. Because of this, 
they’re very important to the anaerobic food chain, not to mention a great 
help when we want to make cheese, beer, spirits, or bread.
Digesting glycolysis
Glucose is a simple sugar that is used as an energy source by many living 
cells. Glycolysis (the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate) is the same under 
fermentation and respiration, but the fate of pyruvate, the product of gly-
colysis, is different. Whether glucose is respired or fermented depends on 
whether there is oxygen (O2) present.
Under fermentation, the breakdown of glucose for energy yields two ATP mol-
ecules and pyruvate, which is then reduced to end products such as lactate 
and ethanol. In the presence of O2, glucose is respired to make 38 ATP mol-
ecules and CO2. Respiration results in more ATP than fermentation because 
the energy remaining in lactate and ethanol can only be extracted by reduc-
ing them to CO2 in the presence of O2.
Regardless of whether by respiration or fermentation, glycolysis requires 
three stages:
	
✓	Stage 1: Preparatory enzymatic reactions lead to a key intermediate. 
This stage does not involve redox reactions and no energy is released.

57
 Chapter 5: Making Sense of Metabolism
	
✓	Stage 2: This is when the redox reactions occur, producing ATP and 
pyruvate. At this point, the breakdown of glucose is done, but because 
the redox reactions aren’t balanced, another stage is required.
	
✓	Stage 3: The redox reactions needed to balance the reactions in Stage 2 
happen in Stage 3. In fermentation, this is the reduction of pyruvate to its 
fermentation products that are then excreted as waste and in respiration 
this is the reduction of pyruvate to CO2.
Stepping along with respiration 
and electron carriers
The breakdown of compounds by respiration releases much more energy 
than does the breakdown of the same compounds by fermentation. This 
is because the complete reduction of the products of fermentation isn’t 
possible without oxygen or oxygen substitutes to act as terminal electron 
acceptors.
The star of this phenomenon is the electron transport chain, which involves 
several electron acceptors positioned within a membrane in order of reduc-
ing power so that the weakest electron acceptors are at one end of the chain 
and the strongest electron acceptors are at the other end. It’s the specific ori-
entation of electron carriers in the membrane that creates the proton motive 
force and links ATP synthesis with it.
	
The electron transport chain reduces organic compounds to CO2 and 
conserves some of the energy as electrons are transferred from the carbon 
substrate (glucose), through several redox reactions to the terminal electron 
acceptor (O2).
Some membrane-bound carriers, like the quinones, are nonprotein molecules, 
but most are oxidation-reduction enzymes and some of these have prosthetic 
groups that participate in redox reactions. Prosthetic groups are small 
molecules that are permanently bound to an enzyme and are important to 
its activity. Before we can talk about the proton motive force and how ATP is 
made during respiration, we want to list some of the many different electron 
carriers that take part in the electron transport chain:
	
✓	NADH dehydrogenases: These are proteins that accept an electron (e–) 
and a proton (H+) from NADH, oxidizing it to NAD+ and passing them 
onto a flavoprotein.
	
✓	Flavoproteins: These are made up of a protein bound to a prosthetic 
group called flavin, which comes from the vitamin riboflavin. The 
flavin group accepts two e– and two H+ but only donates two e– when 
oxidized.

58
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
	
✓	Cytochromes: These proteins contain a heme prosthetic group with an 
iron atom in its center that gains or loses a single e–. There are different 
classes of cytochromes based on the type of heme they contain and 
labeled with a different letter (for example, cytochrome a). When the 
same class of cytochrome is slightly different in two organisms, each gets 
a number attached to the name (for example, cytochromes a1 and a2).
	
✓	Iron-sulfur proteins: These bind iron but without a heme group. Instead, 
they have clusters of sulfur and iron atoms arranged in the center of 
the protein. They only accept e– and have a range of reducing power 
depending on the number of iron and sulfur atoms present.
	
✓	Quinones: These hydrophobic molecules (not proteins) are free to move 
around the membrane. They accept two e– and two H+ and usually act as 
a link between iron-sulfur proteins and cytochromes.
In Figure 5-4, you can see examples of some of these compounds and how 
they’re physically sitting within the membrane in the right order for electrons 
to flow from the most electronegative to the most electropositive.

 Chapter 5: Making Sense of Metabolism
Moving with the proton motive force
The proton motive force occurs when the cell membrane becomes energized 
due to electron transport reactions by the electron carriers embedded in it. 
Basically, this causes the cell to act like a tiny battery. Its energy can either 
be used right away to do work, like power flagella, or be stored for later in 
ATP. ATP synthesis is linked to the proton motive force through oxidative 
phosphorylation, where a phosphate group is added to ADP.
Although several steps are involved in creating an energized cell membrane, 
there’s one simple concept behind this phenomenon: the separation of posi-
tive protons (H+) on the outside of the membrane and negative hydroxide 
ions (OH–) on the inside of the membrane. The fact that they’re charged 
makes it impossible for these ions to cross the membrane on their own. 
Trapping the ions on either side of the membrane creates two things, which 
together make the proton motive force: a pH and a charge difference. A differ-
ence in charge on the inside and the outside of a cell is called an electrochemi-
cal potential and is a huge source of energy.
	
Imagine you’re standing on the roof of a tall building, holding an orange. If 
you let the orange drop over the side of the building, by the time it reaches 
the ground it will have gained so much speed that it will hit the ground with 
great force and smash. Because of the large difference in height from where it 
was dropped and where it landed, there’s a great amount of energy. It’s sort of 
the same thing with electrochemical potential, where the great difference in 
charge creates a lot of potential energy.
How this happens is that during electron transport, H+ are pushed to the 
outside of the membrane. The H+ come from both NADH and the dissociation 
of H2O into H+ and OH–. As you’ll see in a minute, it’s a bit more complicated, 
but the overall result is accumulation of a positive charge outside the cell and 
a negative charge within.
In the example in Figure 5-4, the proton motive force is created by a series of 
complexes within the cell membrane. These complexes are made up of the e– 
carriers mentioned earlier, the exact combination and number of which differ 
between organisms. The proton motive force has two possible beginnings:
	
✓	Complex I: One way the proton motive force begins is with the donation 
of H+ from NADH to flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to make FMNH2. 4H+ 
move to the outside of the cell when FMNH2 donates 2e– to the Fe/S pro-
teins in complex I.
	
✓	Complex II: The other way the proton motive force begins is through 
complex II, where FADH feeds e– and H+ from the oxidation of succinate, 
a product of the citric acid cycle, to the quinones. Complex II is less 
efficient than complex I.

60
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Once electrons enter the cycle through Complex I or II they move on to 
Complex III and eventually IV:
	
✓	Complex III: Quinones are reduced in the Q-cycle (a series of oxidation 
and reduction reactions of the coenzyme Q that result in the release of 
additional H+ to the outside of the membrane). Then electrons are passed 
one at a time from the Q-cycle to complex III, which contains the heme-
containing proteins (specifically, cytochrome bc1) and an FeS protein.
	
✓	Complex IV: Cytochrome bc1 transfers e– to cytochrome c, which then 
passes them to cytochromes a and a3 in complex IV. This is the end of 
the line where O2 is reduced to H2O.
At almost every step, H+ are pumped to the outer surface of the membrane, 
increasing the strength of the proton motive force.
	
Electron transport chains differ among organisms, but they always have three 
things in common:
	
✓	Electron carriers arranged in order of increasing reducing power
	
✓	Alternating H+ + e– and e–-only carriers
	
✓	Generation of a proton motive force
The production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from aerobic respiration is 
called oxidative phosphorylation, and it’s carried out by a complex of proteins 
called ATP synthase. This complex is made up of two subunits, F1 and F0, each 
of which is actually a rotary motor. Protons (H+), driven back through the 
membrane from the outside by the proton motive force, go through F0 and 
place pressure (or torque) on F1. A molecule of adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 
with only two phosphate groups) along with a free phosphate group (Pi) bind 
to F1, and when the torque is released, energy is free to power the formation 
of ATP through the bonding of ADP and Pi. Like many enzymes, ATP synthase 
is reversible so that it can contribute to the proton motive force instead of 
weakening it. So, even organisms that don’t use oxidative phosphorylation, 
like anaerobic fermenters, have ATP synthases so that they can still create a 
proton motive force to drive things like flagellar movement or ion transport.
Turning the citric acid cycle
The citric acid cycle is a key pathway in catabolism in all cells. As mentioned 
earlier, all the steps in the respiration of glucose up to the formation of 
pyruvate are the same as in fermentation. After this, the citric acid cycle is 
responsible for the oxidation of pyruvate to CO2. For each pyruvate used, three 
molecules of CO2 are made (see Figure 5-5).

61
 Chapter 5: Making Sense of Metabolism
	
Figure 5-5: 
The citric 
acid cycle.
	
	
In respiration, glucose is completely oxidized to CO2 and much more energy is 
made than in glucose fermentation. Glucose is fermented to alcohol or lactic 
acid products and two ATP are made. On the other hand, glucose is respired 
to CO2 and H2O and 38 ATP are made.
Stacking Up with Anabolism
We’ve covered the many ways that a cell can use to generate energy by break-
ing down food, like glucose, and obtaining reducing power to make ATP. Now 
let’s look at what the cell does with this energy.
The cell needs many compounds for life, including enzymes to perform its 
many functions, structural molecules to give it shape, as well as nucleic acids 
to store its genetic material. If it can, the cell will obtain some of these things 
from its environment, but when it has to make them itself, it uses anabolism. 

62
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Anabolism is essentially making the complex things needed from smaller 
building blocks. These complex compounds are called macromolecules, and 
there are four main classes of them:
	
✓	Proteins are made from amino acids.
	
✓	Nucleic acids are made from nucleotides.
	
✓	Polysaccharides, which are the subunits of complex carbohydrates like 
starch and glycogen, are made from sugars.
	
✓	Lipids are made from fatty acids.
Many of these macromolecules combine not only with members of their own 
class, but also with those from other classes to form things like glycopro-
teins or lipoproteins that have important roles in microbial cell function and 
structure.
The building blocks themselves can sometimes be taken directly from the 
environment, but other times they have to be made. In many cases, complex 
pathways are needed to make the smallest subunits of each macromolecule, 
but, as you’ll see in this section, microbes have figured out ways to use the 
least number of complex pathways possible.
Creating amino acids and nucleic acids
Amino acids have an amino group bonded to a carbon skeleton, the central 
structure of all amino acids is shown in Figure 5-6. Each amino acid has one 
or more special side groups or chains (R) that give it a specific structure 
or function. Making amino acids from scratch is very expensive in terms 
of energy, so microbes try their best to get them from their environment. 
When they can’t get them from outside, however, they use a kind of template 
method to reduce the amount of energy spent on different biosynthesis 
pathways.
	
Figure 5-6: 
The 
common 
structure 
of all amino 
acids.
	

63
 Chapter 5: Making Sense of Metabolism
Amino acid biosynthesis starts with a carbon skeleton, made from intermediates 
of the citric acid cycle or glycolysis. A few different skeletons can be used in 
the production of several different amino acids, and what you get are classes 
of amino acids where the members of each class have a similar structure.
The next step is attachment of an amino group to the carbon structure. The 
amino group can be taken from ammonia (NH3) in the environment and used 
to make glutamate or glutamine. Depending on the availability of ammonia, 
the enzymes used are either
	
✓	Glutamate dehydrogenase: Used when NH3 is plentiful. It’s the less 
energy expensive of the two.
	
✓	Glutamate synthase: Used in NH3-poor conditions. It requires more 
energy than glutamate dehydrogenase.
Here’s the second frugal thing that microbes do: After glutamine and glutamate 
are made, the amino group can be used in all the other 20 amino acids.
Nucleotides are the subunits of nucleic acids like ribonucleic acid (RNA) and 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and like amino acids they’re expensive and 
time consuming to make. In fact, nucleotides are even more cumbersome to 
make because atoms of carbon and nitrogen have to be added one at a time! 
When it can’t be avoided, microbes make two different nucleotide templates 
(one for purines and one for pyrimidines) that they modify to make other 
variants. This saves the expense of having a bunch of complex pathways for 
nucleotide biosynthesis at work in the cell.
The two classes of nucleotides that arise are the purines and the pyrimidines. 
The first key purine made is inosinic acid, from all kinds of carbon and nitro-
gen sources. Once made, it’s modified to produce the main purines adenine 
and guanine. The first key pyrimidine made is uridylate, which is then modi-
fied into thyamine, cytosine, and uracil.
The structure of complete nucleotides is shown in Figure 5-7. They have a 
purine or pyrimidine ring attached to three phosphates (PO3
–) and a ribose 
sugar backbone. After they’re formed, they can either be used directly in RNA or 
the ribose can be modified, by reduction to deoxyribose, and be used in DNA.
Making sugars and polysaccharides
In the previous section, we talk a lot about the breakdown of sugars like 
glucose for energy, but cells can also use sugars for all sorts of other things. 
For example, the backbone of peptidoglycan, a major component of the 
bacterial cell wall, is made of sugars. Hexoses are six-carbon sugars like 

64
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
glucose, and pentoses are five-carbon sugars like ribose (see Figure 5-8). 
When hexoses need to be made, they’re synthesized with gluconeogenesis 
using intermediates from glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Pentoses can be 
made by removal of one carbon from a hexose.

Nucleotides.
	

65
 Chapter 5: Making Sense of Metabolism
	
Figure 5-8: 
An example 
of a hexose 
and a pen-
tose sugar.
	
Polysaccharides are molecules made up of many sugar subunits. In prokary-
otes, they’re synthesized from activated glucose. There are two forms of acti-
vated glucose; each is used to make different types of polysaccharides:
	
✓	Uridine diphosphoglucose (UDPG) is the precursor for the backbone 
of the cell wall component peptidoglycan, a precursor in parts of the 
Gram-negative outer membrane and a precursor of the storage molecule 
glycogen.
	
✓	Adenosine diphosphoglucose (ADPG) is the precursor of the storage 
molecule glycogen.
The process of making a polysaccharide involves adding an activated glucose 
to the growing chain of a polysaccharide.
Putting together fatty acids and lipids
Bacterial cells make a wide variety of lipids from subunits of fatty acids 
that have some important functions in the cell. Lipids are the main part of 
membranes and can be used as stores for longer-term storage of energy. Fatty 
acids are built by adding two carbons at a time to a growing fatty acid chain. 
The enzyme acyl carrier protein (ACP) is essential to this process because it 
holds onto the growing chain until all the carbons have been added.
Fatty acids can either be straight-chained or branched; in addition, they can 
either be saturated or unsaturated. Straight-chained saturated fatty acids are 
very straight, while unsaturated sites add kinks and bends in the chain (see 
Figure 5-9). Straight chains of lipids can be packed more densely next to one 
another (as in a membrane, for instance). These differences determine how a 
membrane will function (for example, under different temperatures).
Membrane lipids in particular need to have a polar side and a nonpolar side, 
meaning one side with a charge and one side without. This allows them to 
interact with other charged molecules (like water) on one side and to interact 

66
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
with other uncharged molecules (like fats) on the other. This is done by 
attaching the nonpolar fatty acid chains to a polar group like a carbohydrate 
or a phosphate. Glycerol is an example of a polar group with three carbons 
that can either all be bonded to fatty acids (making simple triglycerides) 
or to fatty acids and other side groups (making complex lipids). In archaea, 
the polar groups are the same but the nonpolar groups are made of longer 
branched chained molecules called phytanyls and biphytanyls.

An example 
of bending 
in a fatty 
acid chain.
	
Polysaccharides give bacteria an edge
In addition to all the other great uses for poly-
saccharides, some bacteria use sugars to make 
compounds that they use to compete and sur-
vive. Two examples, in particular, are important 
because pathogenic bacteria use them to get 
an edge on us:
	✓	Streptococcus pneumoniae uses a thick 
polysaccharide capsule, that surrounds the 
entire bacterial cell to hide from the human 
immune system.
	✓	Pseudomonas aeruginosa excretes a sticky 
substance made of sugars around itself, 
forming what is called a biofilm, so that 
it can attach to the lungs of immunocom-
promized people. Once inside the biofilm, 
Pseudomonas is very hard to treat with 
antibiotics that can’t get through the dense 
polysaccharide matrix.

he genetic material of the cell includes all its DNA, which acts as a copy 
of the instructions needed to make proteins. Because proteins are the 
machinery that perform all the functions in the cell — including metaboliz-
ing and providing structure — DNA is the central blueprint for how a cell is 
shaped and behaves.
	
In most other chapters of this book, we consider bacteria and archaea (often 
called prokaryotes) together, mostly because they share many aspects of cell 
structure, metabolism, and overall lifestyle. In those cases, it makes sense to 
talk about the differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. As discussed 
in Chapter 8, however, archaea and eukaryotes are more closely related than 
archaea and bacteria. It’s no wonder then that the organization of their genetic 
material, as well as the mechanisms used to make protein, are less similar to 
those in bacteria than they are to those in eukaryotes. Viruses, on the other 
hand, are so different from other microbes that we save a discussion of viral 
genetics for Chapter 14.
Organizing Genetic Material
In all cells, the instructions within the DNA are first copied into RNA, which 
is then used to make protein. The central dogma of biology is then a flow of 
information from DNA to protein, through RNA, like this:
DNA → RNA → Protein

68
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Instructions for individual proteins exist as a string of DNA called a gene, 
and all the genes in an organism are collectively called its genome. Within its 
genome, each organism has many more genes that it will use at any one time, 
because it will carry genes for proteins that it will need if or when conditions 
change. The genome is the genetic potential of an organism. All the proteins 
and products that the organism has made at the moment, which allow it to 
interact with its environment in a specific way, is called its phenotype.
In this section, we fill you in on the processes of microbial genetics mainly 
for bacteria, with notes on how things differ in archaea and eukaryotic 
microorganisms.
DNA: The recipe for life
The way that DNA encodes the instructions for proteins is through a set of 
four molecules called bases, each of which represents a letter of the genetic 
code (A = adenine, C = cytosine, G = guanine, and T = thymine). The bases are 
made of carbon and nitrogen rings and are bound to a sugar and a phosphate 
to form a nucleotide. The nucleotides are connected together to form a long 
chain with the bases pointing out. Because the nitrogenous bases can inter-
act with each other — A binding with T and C binding with G — two such 
chains placed opposite to each other form the ladderlike structure of DNA, 
with paired bases making the rungs of the ladder (see Figure 6-1).
	
Nucleotide bases will always pair in the same way, so each strand of DNA has 
the same sequence when read in the opposite direction to one another. The 
fact that each of the two DNA strands has the same sequence is called comple-
mentarity; it’s essential to making sure that all cells get the same instructions 
during DNA replication and cell division.
Covalent bonds attach the subunits of the backbone together, whereas hydro-
gen bonds hold the paired bases together. Because these hydrogen bonds are 
much weaker than the rest of the bonds, the bases can be pulled apart, allowing 
things like DNA replication or RNA synthesis to occur.
The genomes of bacteria and archaea are, for the most part, arranged as a 
single circular chromosome and some extra-chromosomal genetic material, 
called plasmids. The chromosome contains all the essential genes required 
for life, whereas plasmids contain useful but not strictly essential genes. 
Eukaryotic genomes are usually contained in multiple linear chromosomes, 
although they can also have plasmids.

69
 Chapter 6: Getting the Gist of Microbial Genetics
	
Figure 6-1: 
The 
­structure of 
DNA.
	
In both cases, the types of genes in the genome include
	
✓	Biosynthesis and metabolism genes
	
✓	Ribosomal RNA genes and transfer RNA genes
	
✓	DNA replication and repair genes
A bacterial genome is twisted up on itself to compactly fit inside a bacte-
rial cell. The DNA for the genome of a eukaryote is wound around proteins 
called histones that help compact it without the DNA strand getting tangled. 
Archaea have a single circular chromosomelike bacteria that is wound with 
histones like eukaryotes.
	
The genomes of viruses are much shorter and made up of RNA, double-stranded 
DNA, or single-stranded DNA (see Chapter 14).

70
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Perfect plasmids
Genetic information not contained in the chromosome of bacteria or archaea 
is kept as circular double-stranded DNA molecules called plasmids (although 
some linear plasmids do exist). Plasmids contain only nonessential genes 
and replicate independent of the chromosome. Some plasmids exist in many 
copies inside one cell and are called high-copy-number plasmids, whereas 
others are less numerous and are called low-copy-number plasmids. And of 
course, a cell can have many different plasmids at one time.
	
Although the enzymes involved in DNA replication of plasmids are the same as 
those used for the chromosome, some plasmids are copied in a different way 
than the chromosome. Circular chromosomes and some plasmids are copied 
in two directions at the same time starting at one point, called bidirectional 
replication. Other plasmids, however, are copied only in one direction, in a 
method called rolling circle replication.
One important feature of plasmids is that they can be transferred between 
bacteria. For the most part, this happens in two ways:
	
✓	Bacteria die releasing their plasmids and other bacteria take them 
up. In order for this to happen, the second bacterium must naturally 
be able to take up DNA from its environment; it’s said to be naturally 
competent.
	
✓	Plasmids, or other genetic material, are actively transferred from one 
bacterium to another by a process called conjugation. Only some plas-
mids have the genes necessary to induce the transfer of genetic mate-
rial between bacterial cells via conjugation; they’re called conjugative 
plasmids. Conjugative plasmids can facilitate the transfer of themselves, 
other plasmids, and even chromosomal DNA between bacteria.
Aside from conjugative plasmids, the other main types of plasmids are
	
✓	Resistance plasmids: Carry genes for resistance to antibiotics, heavy 
metals, and other cellular defenses.
	
✓	Virulence plasmids: Carry virulence factors.
	
✓	Colicin plasmids: Carry bacteriocins used to inhibit or kill other bacte-
ria. Bacteriocins have a narrower range than antibiotics, so they’re spe-
cifically targeted to particular bacteria.
Plasmids are a useful tool for biotechnology, as explained in Chapter 16.

71
 Chapter 6: Getting the Gist of Microbial Genetics
Doubling down with DNA replication
Before genes can be passed from parent cells to their progeny, a copy of 
the genome has to be made in a process called replication. For circular 
chromosomes, like those in bacteria and archaea, replication begins at the 
origin of replication and proceeds in two directions away from that point, 
simultaneously.
The steps involved in DNA replication, shown in Figure 6-2, must happen in a 
precise order:
	
Figure 6-2: 
DNA 
replication.
	
	
1.	 Supercoiled double-stranded DNA is relaxed by an enzyme called topoi-
somerase (or gyrase) and then unwound by an enzyme called helicase, 
which opens up the two strands in one area at a time.
	
2.	 Nucleotides matching the bases exposed by the unwinding base pair 
with their match. The enzyme DNA polymerase then joins these bases 
together by catalyzing the formation of a bond between the phosphate 
of one nucleotide and the sugar (deoxyribose) of an adjacent nucleotide. 
This enzyme has a proofreading function, correcting any mistakenly 
added nucleotides.
	
3.	 The enzymes move farther along, unwinding the next section of DNA so 
that more nucleotides can join the growing chain of the new DNA strand.

72
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
The site where all this is happening is called the replication fork. Because 
each strand of a double-stranded DNA molecule gets incorporated into one 
of the two final copies of new DNA molecules, the process is called semi-
conservative replication.
DNA polymerase can only add bases in the 5’ to 3’ direction, so replication 
proceeds differently on the two strands of DNA in the replication fork, as 
shown in Figure 6-3.
	
Figure 6-3: 
Different 
methods of 
replication 
on each 
strand in the 
replication 
fork.
	
One strand is called the leading strand. Bases are added smoothly in the 5’ 
to 3’ direction. The other strand is called the lagging strand. There, short 
pieces of DNA (called Okazaki fragments) are made by DNA polymerase with 
the help of a short RNA primer and then joined together by another enzyme 
called DNA ligase.
	
The 5’ and 3’ ends of DNA (pronounced five prime and three prime) are the 
two ends of single strand of DNA. Because double-stranded DNA is made up 
of two such strands in opposite directions, one strand goes in the 5’ to 3’ 
direction and the other goes in the 3’ to 5’ direction. They’re named this way 
for the carbon atoms in the pentose sugars in their backbones.
After DNA replication is complete the cell has generated two circular chro-
mosomes from one. Each of these then becomes part of a new cell during cell 
division (see Figure 6-4).
The nucleus in eukaryotes makes things more complicated. Replication of a 
linear chromosome happens a bit differently than it does for a circular chro-
mosome because DNA polymerase can start replication from each end of the 
DNA instead of from a point of origin in the middle. The steps are the same 
as for bacteria with a few extra proteins involved. One protein in particular, 
telomerase, makes sure that the ends of the chromosome don’t get shorter 
every time it’s copied. Telomerase extends the ends of the chromosome by 
adding repeated sequences; these repeated sequences are called telomeres.

73
 Chapter 6: Getting the Gist of Microbial Genetics
Figure 6-4: 
Replication 
of a circular 
chromosome.
After replication but before cell division, the chromosomes become very con-
densed into a form called heterochromatin, which can be seen with a microscope. 
Next, the nucleus disassembles so that copies of the chromosomes can be 
separated in two directions. Another important feature of eukaryotic chromo-
somes are the centromeres, areas of the chromosome where spindle fibers attach 
during cell division. Neither telomeres nor centromeres contain genes; they’re 
structural parts of the chromosome only (see Figure 6-5). After cell division has 
occurred, two nuclei form around the chromosomes in each daughter cell.
	
Figure 6-5: 
Eukaryotic 
chromo-
somes.
	
Eukaryotic organisms can have one or two copies of their chromosomes 
within the cell. When carrying two copies, the organism is said to be diploid; 
when carrying one copy, the organism is said to be haploid. When eukaryotic 
cells replicate their DNA prior to cell division it’s called mitosis. Both haploid 

74
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
and diploid organisms undergo mitosis and cell division, during which they 
make sure to have the same number of chromosomes in each resulting cell 
that they started with.
Another type of replication, called meiosis, is used to go from a diploid stage 
to a haploid stage. Meiosis first involves separation of the two copies of 
chromosomes from the diploid cell, making two haploid cells during cell divi-
sion. Next, DNA replication and cell division happen again on these two hap-
loid cells to give four final haploid cells. In complex eukaryotic organisms, 
these are the cells used for reproduction (egg and sperm), but in eukaryotic 
microorganisms these are the spores.
Figure 6-6 illustrates both meiosis and mitosis.

Meiosis and 
mitosis.

 Chapter 6: Getting the Gist of Microbial Genetics
Assembling the Cellular Machinery
In order for the information carried within a cell’s DNA to be useful, it must 
be turned first into ribonucleic acid (RNA) through transcription and then 
into protein through translation. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is used to ferry 
the message for a gene to the ribosome where it is made into protein. Because 
mRNA doesn’t last forever in the cell, these short messages are a way of only 
making the protein that is needed at that time.
Making messenger RNA
RNA is made through transcription, where an enzyme called RNA polymerase 
transcribes the DNA sequence into a complementary version with the use 
of free RNA nucleotides. Three of the bases (adenine, guanine, and cytosine) 
are the same as in DNA, but the fourth (thymine) is replaced by uracil in 
RNA. Also, the backbone is slightly different, containing a ribose instead of a 
deoxyribose sugar.
Transcription begins at the promoter, which is a location in the DNA that 
signals the beginning of a gene. In bacteria, RNA polymerase binds to the 
promoter and transcription proceeds in the 5’ to 3’ direction until it encounters 
the terminator sequence, where it stops. The newly made mRNA molecule is 
then bound by the ribosome to begin translation.
	
In fact, protein synthesis can begin immediately in bacteria once part of the 
mRNA is available for binding. This is because in bacteria transcription and 
translation, both happen in the cytoplasm and also because the mRNA doesn’t 
have to be processed prior to translation. Ribosomes bind to and start transla-
tion of mRNA before it’s even finished being transcribed.
	
In bacteria and archaea, many genes are organized into groups that are tran-
scribed together, called operons. The operon has one promoter, which signals 
the start of transcription, followed by several genes next to one another 
and ending with a transcriptional termination sequence. Transcription of an 
operon results in an mRNA, called polycistronic mRNA, which codes for sev-
eral proteins, each of which are translated in sequence. Grouping genes into 
operons is a way for the cell to coordinate the expression of genes that will be 
needed at the same time.
Transcription in eukaryotes is similar to transcription in bacteria except that 
after the mRNA is made, it has to be processed and then transported out of 
the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation (see Figure 6-7).

Transcrip­
tion in 
bacteria and 
eukaryotes.

77
 Chapter 6: Getting the Gist of Microbial Genetics
Here are the mRNA processing steps:
	
1.	 A cap is attached to the mRNA so that it can be recognized for transla-
tion by the ribosome.
	
2.	 The protein coding sequence of eukaryotic genes is interrupted by non-
coding regions called introns that are transcribed by RNA polymerase 
but are later removed, or spliced, during RNA processing.
	
3.	 The mRNA is trimmed and a string of A’s is added at the end, called a 
poly A tail. The poly A tail makes the mRNA stable and helps identify it 
to the ribosome as a sequence to be translated.
	
4.	 Mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to be made 
into protein by ribosomes.
Archaea have promoters and RNA polymerase that are similar to those in 
eukaryotes, but transcription is regulated as in bacteria. Many archaeal genes 
are found in operons; some, but not all, have introns.
Remembering other types of RNA
The cell has a few other types of RNA, two of which are essential to protein 
synthesis: ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA). These are called 
non-translated RNAs because they’re never made into protein but perform 
their function as RNA. For rRNA and tRNA, this means first being folded into 
a three-dimensional structure that is held together by bonding between com-
plementary bases in the sequence (see Figure 6-8). Folded rRNAs and tRNAs 
can then interact with proteins and with DNA.

The three-
dimensional 
structure of 
tRNA.
	

78
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Synthesizing protein
The message contained within an mRNA is converted to protein through 
translation, where the genetic code is deciphered into amino acids. The 
bases in mRNA are decoded in threes into codons, each of which encodes 
an amino acid (see Figure 6-9); there are 20 amino acids. Several different 
codons encode the same amino acid.
	
Figure 6-9: 
The codons.
	
Making a protein involves stringing together many amino acids into a long 
chain, which then folds into the shape it needs to be in to perform its func-
tion. Amino acids have different properties. Some are hydrophobic and don’t 
mix with water; some are hydrophilic and mix well with water; some are 
acidic and others are basic; some are more subtle and don’t interact strongly 
with any other molecules. The different combinations of these properties 
create the many kinds of proteins.

79
 Chapter 6: Getting the Gist of Microbial Genetics
There are many important players in protein synthesis, but two in particular 
have crucial jobs:
	
✓	Ribosome: The ribosome’s job is to hold everything in place, as well 
as form the bonds between amino acids. All cells have ribosomes. 
Ribosomes are made of RNA and associated proteins, with a small 
subunit and a large subunit coming together during translation to 
catalyze protein synthesis.
	
✓	Transfer RNAs (tRNAs): Transfer RNAs are small RNA molecules that are 
folded into a specific shape necessary for fitting into ribosomes, carry-
ing an amino acid and reading a codon. The way that each tRNA recog-
nizes a codon is through base paring with a complementary sequence 
on the tRNA called the anticodon.
The start of translation is signaled by the codon AUG, which also codes for 
the amino acid methionine. The end of translation is signaled by one of three 
stop codons (UAA, UGA, or UAG), none of which codes for an amino acid. In 
prokaryotes, the process works like this (see Figure 6-10):
	
1.	Intiation is the beginning of protein synthesis and involves assembly of 
the ribosome, the tRNA that recognizes the start codon, and the mRNA 
molecule itself, as well as other accessory proteins. A second tRNA for 
the next codon enters the ribosome, and the two first amino acids are 
joined with a peptide bond.
	
2.	Elongation happens as the ribosome moves along the mRNA so that 
tRNAs can enter and add the appropriate amino acids to the growing 
peptide chain.
	
3.	Termination occurs once the ribosome has reached the stop codon. At 
this point, the ribosome separates into its two subunits, and the mRNA 
molecule and the peptide chain are released.
	
A peptide chain is a newly formed protein made up of amino acids covalently 
bonded by peptide bonds.
In eukaryotes the process is similar with a few key differences:
	
✓	Eukaryotic mRNAs are recognized by the ribosome by the mRNA’s 
methylated cap and its poly A tail.
	
✓	The ribosomes are larger and use different accessory proteins for each 
step of translation. The ribosomes of archaea also use some of the same 
accessory proteins as those in eukaryotes.

80
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
	
Figure 6-10: 
Translation.
	
The peptide chain then folds properly either on its own or with the help of 
other proteins. After it’s sent to the proper location in the cell, the freshly 
made protein will be ready to perform its function in the cell. Some bacterial 
proteins need to be secreted to the periplasm (the space between the inner 
membrane and the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria) or inserted 
into the membrane. Proteins to be secreted have a signal peptide that is 
around 10 to 15 amino acids long. The signal peptide is bound by other pro-
teins that will shuttle them to the area in the membrane where they can be 
exported from the cytoplasm.
Making the Right Amount: Regulation
Of the many proteins at work in a cell, some are required all the time, 
whereas others are needed only under certain circumstances. For example, 
ATPase is always needed, whereas an enzyme that breaks down a specific 
sugar is needed only when that sugar is present.
Cells have genes for many more proteins than they need at a given time, and 
the process of turning those genes on and off or of changing the activity of 
those genes is called regulation. Protein synthesis is expensive for the cell, so 
it’s important that it makes only what it needs.

81
 Chapter 6: Getting the Gist of Microbial Genetics
	
Why have two main ways of regulating metabolism? Because neither of the 
two by itself could manage the resources necessary to keep a cell running effi-
ciently. For example, when a protein is needed, it takes time to transcribe and 
translate the gene for it. Also, when the protein is no longer needed, it takes 
time for the amount of that protein in the cell to get old and stop working. 
So, although turning on and off transcription of a gene is important, it’s also 
important to turn on and off the function of a protein (like an enzyme) so that 
the cell can react quickly to its environment.

Regulation that occurs at the transcriptional level involves proteins that bind 
to DNA and either enhance or repress transcription. This form of regulation 
controls the amount of a protein that’s made.
DNA-binding proteins, as their name suggests, are proteins that interact with 
DNA. There are two kinds of DNA-binding proteins: those that are sequence 
specific and those that are nonspecific. An example of a nonspecific DNA-
binding protein is the histone than interacts with all the DNA in the cell in the 
same way. Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins bind when they recognize 
a short region of the DNA sequence.
	
Histones interact with negatively charged DNA because they’re very positively 
charged themselves. The association between the two neutralizes the charge 
on both and allows DNA to be compacted more than it if the negative charges 
were repelling each other.
Negative control of gene expression uses a repressor protein that, when active, 
binds to DNA and turns off expression of the gene. For some genes, the 
repressor is inactive until a co-repressor molecule is present. The corepressor 
binds to the repressor, activating it and causing expression of that gene to 
be turned off (see the arginine [arg] example in Figure 6-11). For other genes, 
the repressor is naturally bound to the gene to keep its expression turned 
off until an inducer molecule is present that binds to the repressor and inac-
tivates it, which turns on transcription of that gene (see the lactose [lac] 
example in Figure 6-11).
	
The process of transcription and translation of a gene is called the expression 
of that gene.

Figure 6-11: 
Negative 
control 
of gene 
expression.
Positive control of gene expression involves a DNA-binding protein called an 
activator that binds to DNA and activates transcription. Activators usually 
need to first bind an inducer molecule that then allows them to bind DNA. 
When all three are bound, RNA polymerase can attach and begin transcrib-
ing the gene. An example of this is expression of the genes for breaking down 
maltose (a sugar) that require maltose to bind the activator, which then turns 
on the genes for maltose breakdown (see Figure 6-12).

control

expression.
	
	
In eukaryotes, regulation of gene expression doesn’t involve repressor or 
activator proteins. Instead, signals to turn on and off transcription are sent 
directly to parts of the RNA polymerase enzyme itself.

Regulating protein function
Regulating the activity of an enzyme is a way of fine-tuning metabolism to 
limit any waste of energy, to stop the accumulation of toxic waste product, or 
to avoid overusing a valuable resource.
When products build up in the cell, they can act to turn off the activity of the 
enzyme that made them. This is called feedback inhibition, and it acts to switch 
an enzyme from its active form to an inactive form, or from “on” to “off.”
The activity of the enzyme can also be controlled in amore subtle way. 
Sites on the enzyme can be modified to incrementally decrease the amount 
of product an enzyme makes. This gives the cell precise control over a 
metabolic pathway.
Changing the Genetic Code
Genetic diversity is the basis of evolution and natural selection is the force 
driving it.
If a perfect copy of the genome were always passed on, there would be no 
genetic variety in the world. Genetic change is what drives evolution and has 
led to the great variety of life we know today. Changes to a genome can be in the 
form of a mutation or recombination, each of which occurs a few different ways.
In eukaryotes, DNA exchange is linked with cell division — two cells, each 
with one copy of the genome, fuse to form one cell with two copies of the 
genome. The genetic material can then recombine and split again, in meio-
sis (see “Doubling down with DNA replication,” earlier in this chapter), to 
Passing notes: Signal transduction
Sometimes instead of responding to a food 
source or the product of a biosynthetic path-
way, gene expression is regulated based on 
a signal that is unrelated to the genes being 
regulated. This type of transcriptional regula-
tion is called signal transduction, and it involves 
two parts: sensing the signal and responding 
to the signal. Rarely the same protein senses 
and responds to a signal, but more commonly 
two separate proteins work together in what is 
called a two-component regulatory system.

84
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
form haploid cells. In bacteria and archaea, however, DNA exchange is not 
always linked with cell division. Cells can take up genetic material that gets 
combined with their genome and separately reproduce by cell division.
Slight adjustments
Sometimes errors occur during DNA replication that alter the sequence by 
one or a small number of bases by adding too many nucleotides, too few 
nucleotides, or a wrong nucleotide. The result is called a point mutation. Point 
mutations can have a negative effect, a positive effect, or no effect on the pro-
tein. Most of the time, base substitutions have no effect on the final protein, 
so they’re called silent mutations. Other times, however, changes in one or a 
few bases can alter the function of a protein in a negative or positive way by 
decreasing the function of the expressed protein or improving it.
Three types of mutations are possible due to base substitutions (see 
Figure 6-13):
	
✓	Missense mutations: A missense mutation happens when the wrong 
nucleotide is added within the coding region of a protein gene and that 
changes the amino acid that is incorporated into the resulting protein.
	
✓	Nonsense mutations: A nonsense mutation is the result of the wrong 
nucleotide being added within the coding region of a protein gene, cre-
ating a stop codon. The resulting protein will then be shorter than it is 
supposed to be, or truncated.
	
✓	Frameshift mutations: A frameshift mutation is caused by the loss or 
addition of a nucleotide that changes how the pattern of three nucleo-
tides per codon is read. The result is that, from this point forward, com-
pletely different amino acids may be incorporated into the protein.
Point mutations can also be caused by mutagens, things like chemicals or 
radiation that damage DNA. Microorganisms have the ability to repair some 
of the DNA after damage from a mutagen, the process involves removing the 
incorrect or damaged bases and adding the correct ones.

The effects 
of point 
mutations.
	
Codons wobble, but they don’t fall down
The DNA code is degenerate — it has redun-
dancy built in to protect its message from base 
substitutions. More than one three-base codon 
in the DNA codes for the same amino acid, and 
often the difference is in the third nucleotide of 
the codon, called the wobble position. Because 
of this base substitutions that change the 
wobble, nucleotides don’t change which amino 
acid is added to the protein during translation. 
It’s a way of allowing some natural variation so 
organisms can evolve over time without having 
a high number of negative mutations in any pop-
ulation. Base substitutions happen naturally at a 
rate of about 1 per 1010 bases copied, depending 
on the individual organism and gene. Mutation 
rates in viruses are much higher, which works 
to their advantage because they’re constantly 
adapting to avoid their host’s defenses.

86
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Major rearrangements
Changes to an organism’s DNA can also happen on a larger scale than with 
point mutations, where regions of DNA from two different sources get com-
bined. The process of incorporating sequences from different sources into 
the same chromosome is called recombination (see Figure 6-14); it occurs in 
different contexts in eukaryotes and bacteria.

nation.
	

87
 Chapter 6: Getting the Gist of Microbial Genetics
Eukaryote microorganisms have a specific genetic recombination step built 
into the formation of the sex cells, where parts of each pair of diploid chro-
mosomes get exchanged, thus increasing the genetic diversity of the resulting 
spores. In bacteria, genetic recombination is not linked to cell division; instead, 
it’s part of a few different strategies aimed at increasing genetic diversity, 
including transformation, conjugation, transduction, and transposition.
Transformation and conjugation
Bacteria come upon DNA in their environment all the time because the DNA 
of previous individuals hangs around long after they’ve died. Bacterial cells 
that are able to take up foreign DNA are said to be competent. When cells are 
competent, large molecules of DNA are able to pass through the cell wall into 
the cytoplasm, after which recombination is necessary if the DNA is to be 
incorporated into a bacterial genome.
	
When competent cells take up DNA from their environment, it’s called trans-
formation. When cells transfer genetic material with the help of a conjuga-
tive plasmid, it’s called conjugation. Conjugation requires cell-to-cell contact, 
whereas transformation does not.
Gram-negative bacteria produce a sex pilus (a hairlike appendage on the 
surface of the bacteria) used to make contact between cells, whereas Gram-
positive bacteria come into close proximity with one another and make a 
bridge across cells using sticky substances on the cell surface.
Transduction
Another way that genetic material can be transferred between bacteria is 
through the action of a virus that infects one bacterial cell and transfers 
genes to another bacterial cell, a process called transduction. Viruses that 
infect bacteria are called bacteriophage or simply phage. There are many 
kinds of phage, and we discuss them more completely in Chapter 14, but in 
general there are two types of transduction by phage:
	
✓	Generalized transduction: Generalized transduction happens when a 
phage packages any genes present in a bacterial cell, whether they’re 
chromosomal, plasmid, or viral.
	
✓	Specialized transduction: Specialized transduction occurs when only 
some bacterial genes can be packaged into a phage, such as specific 
toxin genes or other virulence factors.
Transposition
Transposition is when a small piece of DNA, called a transposon, moves from 
one location to another within the DNA of an organism. For this to happen, 
there has to be an enzyme capable of cutting and resealing DNA and recogni-
tion sites where the enzyme acts. There are simple and complex transposons 
but all cause DNA modifications.

our perspective on growing microbes will depend on whether you’re 
more concerned with encouraging microbes to grow (for instance, to 
study them) or discouraging microbial growth (for example, for food pres-
ervation or sterilization). Growing some microorganisms in the lab has been 
very challenging, and microbiologists put a lot of effort into getting the condi-
tions just right so that they can encourage these shy microbes to grow. Other 
microbes are easily grown in the lab and are used frequently as model organ-
isms to study different aspects of microbial life. If you’re trying to get rid of 
microbes, some are easy to eradicate and others, like spore-forming bacteria, 
are quite challenging to kill.
In this chapter, we walk you through the ins and outs of microbial growth. We 
start with the topic of encouraging microbial growth, because we love microbes!
Getting Growth Requirements Right
For each microorganism, there is a set of conditions (both physical and 
chemical) under which it can survive. Many factors combine to create these 
conditions. Within the range of conditions that a microbe can survive, there 
is a narrower range that is optimal for growth.
Physical requirements
Microbes have a variety of physical requirements for growth, including tem-
perature, pH, and water stress. We explain these requirements in the follow-
ing sections.

90
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Temperature
Microbes can be separated into groups based on the range of temperatures 
at which they can survive. At the edges of each range, microbes can usually 
survive but not thrive, whereas the perfect conditions for growth are usu-
ally somewhere in the middle. There is also a lot of gray area between these 
groups because not all microbes in each group are the same. For instance, 
some psychrophiles can survive at 0°C but prefer 15°C, and others prefer 
30°C, bringing them almost into the mesophile group.
Here are the various groups of microbes based on their physical requirements:
	
✓	Psychrophiles are microbes that can grow at 0°C. Some are inhibited at 
higher temperatures, preferring to live in cold climates, whereas others 
can survive in conditions above 20°C. This latter group are called psy-
chrotrophs because they prefer colder temperatures but can live just 
fine in higher ones. The range for psychropiles is –10°C to 20°C, with an 
optimum at about 10°C. The range for psychrotrophs is from 0°C to 40°C 
with an optimum of about 20°C.
	
✓	Mesophiles like it best between 25°C and 40°C but can survive between 
10°C and 50°C. Microbes that live within animals grow optimally at 
a temperature that matches that of their host. For instance, microbes 
that live in the human body grow between 34 and 37°C, which is body 
temperature.
	
✓	Thermophiles can tolerate temperatures up to 70°C and like it best 
between 50°C and 60°C. This group contains a subset considered hyper-
thermophilic, or extreme heat loving. All the known microorganisms 
in this category are archaea and some can even grow in temperatures 
above 120°C, deep in the sea where the pressure stops water from boil-
ing at that temperature.
pH
Another physical growth condition important to microorganisms is pH. The 
pH is the measure of how acidic or alkaline a solution is, with values from 0 
to 14. Acidic environments include acid mine drainage, iron lakes, and the 
jar of pickles in your cupboard, with ranges between 1 and 6. Neutral pH is 
around 7. Alkaline, or basic pH, is 8 to 14. Most bacteria prefer a pH range of 
6.5 to 7.5, whereas fungi can grow in more acidic conditions, preferring pH 5 
to 6. Some bacteria and archaea are acididophilic (acid loving); they grow in 
conditions far too acidic for other species.
Water stress
The last physical condition to consider is water stress, either from the con-
centration of solutes in the microbe’s surroundings or from drying. As more 
solutes such as salts or sugar are dissolved in water, the concentration of 

91
 Chapter 7: Measuring Microbial Growth
water to solutes goes down. A microbial cell is permeable to water, so if the 
concentration of water is lower outside the cell than inside the cell, water will 
move out in order to balance the inside and outside solutions.
Too much water leaving the cell will kill it. This fact has been used to preserve 
meats and other foods, by either drying or curing them with salt or adding a 
lot of sugar (for example, honey and jam). On the other hand, environmental 
microbes have adapted to salty conditions; some grow quite well in low-salt 
environments, like seawater, or high-salt environments, like brine ponds.
One way bacteria have developed to deal with bad conditions is to transform 
themselves into endospores. The endospore is a dormant form of the original 
bacterial cell surrounded by a tough coating that makes it resistant to drying, 
as well as toxic compounds in its environment.
Chemical requirements
Unlike the physical requirements where a specific range or concentration is 
necessary for optimum growth, the chemical requirements just need to be 
present in the environment and a microbe will use what it needs. Microbes 
use compounds containing the following elements and vitamins to make 
everything in the cell including membranes, proteins, and nucleic acids:
	
✓	Carbon: Carbon is necessary for all life. In the microbial world, chemo-
organotrophs get their carbon from organic matter, whereas chemoauto-
trophs get it from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
	
✓	Nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus: Nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus are 
necessary for protein and nucleic acid biosynthesis. Most microbes get 
these elements by degrading proteins and nucleic acids, but some cap-
ture nitrogen from nitrogen gas or ammonia or get sulfur from other ions 
in the environment.
	
✓	Trace elements: Trace elements such as iron, copper, molybdenum, and 
zinc are needed as cofactors for enzymes and must be obtained, in tiny 
amounts, from the environment.
	
✓	Vitamins and amino acids: Unlike humans, microbes can make vitamins, 
which also act as enzyme cofactors. Some microbes, however, lack the 
ability to make one or several vitamins and have to get them from their 
environment. The same is true of amino acids and these along with the 
vitamins needed are called growth factors. Although most bacteria can 
make all the amino acids they need, some can’t quite make them all; 
these bacteria are called auxotrophs.
	
✓	Oxygen: The presence of oxygen affects a few different aspects of micro-
bial growth (see Chapters 9 and 10). Different microbes respond differ-
ently to oxygen (see Chapter 10).

92
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Culturing microbes in the lab
If you’re interested in studying a particular microbe in a laboratory, you’ll 
need to create an environment that will accommodate its growth well. Culture 
media contains all the things that a microbe needs for growth. Culture condi-
tions are conditions that are within the microbe’s growth optima (external 
environmental conditions that allow for the optimal growth of the organism).
The culture medium used for a particular microbe must contain all the chemi-
cal requirements for that organism, as well as have the right pH and solute 
concentration and be incubated at the right temperature and oxygen condi-
tions. Here are some of the different kinds of culture media:
	
✓	Chemically defined media are those where the concentration of all the 
components within it are known. Often, chemically defined media are 
used to study specific aspects of microbial growth and metabolism.
	
✓	Complex media are those in which the concentration of nutrients is 
unknown. These media are used most commonly in microbiology labs 
because they work well to culture a variety of microorganisms. Complex 
media contain ingredients such as animal or plant products, for which 
the exact chemical ingredients are not known. They’re often used to 
grow enough microbial biomass to be used for research.
	
✓	Anaerobic growth media contains reducing agents that remove the 
oxygen dissolved in them.
	
✓	Selective media are used to isolate particular microbes of interest. The 
idea behind selective media is to discourage or completely inhibit the 
growth of all but the microbe that you want to culture. This is accom-
plished through the use of additives that are harmful to all but the 
microbe of interest and conditions that favor the desired microbe, which 
then outgrows the rest.
	
✓	Enrichment media is a type of selective media specifically designed to 
encourage the growth of microbes that are either present in a sample in 
very small numbers or are easily outcompeted by the other microbes in 
the sample. If the microbes that you want to grow metabolize something 
rare, like phenol, it can be added as the sole carbon source and only 
allow microbes that degrade it to grow.
	
✓	Differential media contains compounds that change color depending 
on the metabolism of the microbes present. An example of this is blood 
agar on which bacteria form halos around their colonies as they lyse 
(break open), red blood cells.

93
 Chapter 7: Measuring Microbial Growth
Many media types exist that are both selective and differential so as to 
quickly grow and identify particular microbes.
Each of these types of media can be used as a liquid or as a solid. To make 
the solid version of each medium, agar (a substance extracted from algae) is 
added to the medium and then it’s heated (usually during sterilization). The 
mixture is poured into a container. Upon cooling, the agar sets the medium 
into a semisolid form on which microbial cultures can grow.
Obtaining a pure culture of a microbe of interest is accomplished by inoculat-
ing a plate of solid media in a specific way, shown in Figure 7-1. In the figure, 
the black lines show what you would actually draw on an agar plate using a 
stick or a loop as a “drawing tool” after having touched it to some bacteria. 
The bottom part of the figure shows where the bacteria would grow (the cir-
cles) following along the lines you “drew.” As the microbes are spread across 
the plate in the way shown, they are diluted out so that single colonies can 
be isolated. Colonies that look similar are likely from the same organism.

94
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
For microbes that require anoxic (free of oxygen) conditions, there are 
a couple ways to exclude oxygen from the growing conditions. The first 
involves a sealed jar containing a chemical combination that produces hydro-
gen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The hydrogen combines with the oxygen 
(O2) in the presence of the catalyst to form water. The other method is with 
a large chamber that is purged with an inert gas, usually nitrogen gas (N2), 
which replaces regular air.
Some microbes — namely, the ones that live in animals — can grow only with 
elevated levels of CO2. The range of CO2 needed is usually between 3 percent 
and 5 percent and can be achieved by lighting a candle in a sealed jar or 
using more modern growth chambers specifically designed to regulate the 
amount of CO2.
The biosafety level of a microorganism is the level of precaution needed 
when working with it and is based on its known ability to cause human dis-
ease. Biosafety levels start at 1 (safest) and go to 4 (hot zone) and have been 
decided for all microbes on which research is performed. To work with a 
level 3 pathogen, special containment rooms and equipment are required that 
keep everything under negative pressure and filter all air coming out of them. 
Level 4 pathogens require the same precautions, plus personnel have to wear 
protective suits that have their own air supply.
Observing Microbes
When studying microorganisms it’s often helpful to be able to see them. 
This may be in order to count them, tell the different kinds apart from one 
another, or study their structures. To deal with their extremely small size, 
two very different strategies are used.
The first strategy is to increase their numbers to a level that can be observed 
with the naked eye. This usually requires that the microbe of interest be in a 
pure culture that when grown up to sufficient numbers will form a character-
istic type of colony (a large number of microbial cells that came from a single 
individual microbial cell) on solid media.
The second strategy is to magnify the cells many times with the use of 
microscopy. Often this method gives good detail about individual cell struc-
tures but requires that the sample be prepared with the use of dyes and 
other chemicals.

95
 Chapter 7: Measuring Microbial Growth
Counting small things
Microbial experiments often require that we know just how many bacteria, 
for instance, are present. Knowing the number of microbial cells helps to indi-
cate whether cells are growing or dying and it helps experiments to be con-
sistent from day to day. Methods for deciphering the number of cells present 
easily and accurately are used in microbiology labs every day. These include 
direct methods where colonies are directly counted and indirect methods 
where an estimate of the number of cells is made.
Direct methods
Determining the number of bacterial cells that are alive in a sample is done 
using viable counts. Each method for calculating viable numbers of organisms 
takes advantage of the fact that when a suspension of bacteria is plated on 
solid media, each live bacterial cell will grow to form a colony, which is large 
enough to be seen. When the concentration of bacteria in a sample is high, 
it must be diluted enough so that the colonies are distinct from one another, 
which is done with serial dilution, illustrated in Figure 7-2.
	
Figure 7-2: 
Serial 
dilution.
	

96
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
In Figure 7-2, a culture of bacteria is repeatedly diluted by adding a fixed 
volume to the first tube (the first dilution) and then taking a fixed volume 
from the first tube and adding it to the second tube (the second dilution). 
This is repeated several times (which is why it’s called serial dilution) in a 
effort to dilute the original bacterial culture. A small volume of each dilu-
tion is then plated on agar and individual bacterial cells will each form one 
colony. Increasing dilutions will result in a decreasing number of bacteria 
present and, hence, a decreasing number of colonies on each agar plate. The 
number of colonies is then used to calculate backward to determine the exact 
number of cells that were present in the original sample.
	
To calculate the number of viable cells in the original sample, the number of 
colonies present after the plates have been incubated is multiplied by the 
dilution factor. The number of cells in a sample is usually expressed as colony 
forming units (CFU) per unit of volume (in this case mL) or CFU/mL.
When the numbers of cells in a sample are very low, such as in lake water, a 
large volume of the sample can be passed through a filter, which is then cul-
tured with the proper medium to produce colonies of the microbe of interest. 
In this case, the number of colonies is divided by the volume of sample fil-
tered. For example, if 5 liters (L) of lake water were filtered and 100 colonies 
appeared after incubation, then the original number of bacteria in the water 
was 100 colonies/5 L = 20 CFU/L.
Another way of counting the number of cells in a sample is by direct micro-
scopic counts. With this method, all the cells in the sample — whether alive or 
dead — are counted, but it gives you an immediate estimate of bacterial num-
bers without the need to incubate a sample for 24 hours or more.
Indirect methods
Although not as precise, indirect methods are faster and more convenient 
than direct methods at estimating the number of microbes in a sample.
Turbidity is the amount of light scattering caused by the cells in a liquid cul-
ture. A machine called a spectrophotometer passes a beam of light through a 
clear tube containing a bacterial culture. As the number of cells in a culture 
increases, more light is scattered and less of it passes through the tube to be 
recorded on the other side. Turbidity is expressed as absorbance and as opti-
cal density (OD). The higher the number (between 0 and 2), the more concen-
trated the cells in the solution.

97
 Chapter 7: Measuring Microbial Growth
Another way to indirectly estimate the number of cells is to measure the met-
abolic activity of the sample for a specific substrate. In this way, the amount 
of waste produced — either a gas that can be captured and measured or a 
metabolite that can be used with an indicator in the media — can be used to 
calculate how many growing cells are in the culture.
The last method to indirectly estimate the number of cells is by calculating 
the dry weight of the organism in culture. This method is often used with 
fungi that form long filamentous colonies that aren’t easily broken up by dilu-
tion. The sample is concentrated and the liquid is removed. Then the cells 
are dried and weighted.
Seeing morphology
Scientists have been peering at microorganisms through microscopes for 
centuries. For some, the shape of their cells can offer clues to their identity, 
but it’s often necessary to use stains that tell us a bit more about their cellu-
lar structure.
Simple stains contain a single dye that can bind to microbial cells and show 
off their basic structure. Examples of simple stains include crystal violet, saf-
ranin, methylene blue, and carbolfuchsin.
Differential stains distinguish one type of microbe from another. An example 
of a differential stain that tells apart Gram-negative from Gram-positive 
cells is the Gram stain, shown in Figure 7-3. It takes advantage of the fact 
that Gram-positive bacterial cells have a much thicker cell wall than Gram-
negative cells do, which stops them from being washed clean of the first stain 
by the alcohol-washing step.
The acid fast stain takes advantage of the fact that bacteria with a waxy sub-
stance in their cell walls will hold onto a stain even after being washed with 
alcohol. Bacteria that remain colored after washing with alcohol are called 
acid-fast and include human pathogens from the Mycobacterium group.
Other structures in the cell can be observed after being stained with special 
techniques. These include bacterial capsules, endospores, and flagella.

 Chapter 7: Measuring Microbial Growth
Calculating Cell Division and 
Population Growth
Unlike animal growth, which is measured both in the size and number of indi-
viduals, microbial growth is all about the population size. Only the number 
of cells matters when calculating the size of the population. Because cells are 
usually grown in solution the level of growth is referred to as culture density 
or concentration of microbial cells.
Dividing cells
When microbial cells are growing happily on a food source, they’ll increase in 
numbers by cell division. Not all microbes use the same method for increas-
ing the number of cells in the population. Here are the ways that cells divide:
	
✓	Binary fission, which is used by many bacteria, is a process in which 
the growing cell first replicates its DNA and then the cell wall constricts, 
dividing the cell into two (see Figure 7-4).
	
✓	Some bacteria and fungi, like yeast, form new cells through budding. 
This is where an area on the cell’s surface starts to grow outward and is 
eventually pinched off when big enough.
	
✓	Filamentous bacteria and fungi form long chains that don’t completely 
separate. To make new colonies, they form a special structure called a 
conidiospore, which then separates, or a part of the chain will simply 
break off.
Following growth phases
Microbes in culture follow a typical pattern called a growth curve (see 
Figure 7-5), which can be broken down into a few phases:
	
✓	Lag phase: The lag phase is where the cells are metabolizing but not 
increasing in numbers.
	
✓	Log phase: The log phase is when the greatest increase in cell numbers 
occurs. As the number of cycles increases, the number of cells jumps 
drastically, making it hard to visualize the growth rate. For this reason, 
cell numbers are converted to a logarithmic value with a base of 10, 
expressed as log10.

100
Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
	
✓	Stationary phase: In stationary phase, the culture doesn’t really divide 
anymore. This happens because the nutrients have been used up or the 
pH has decreased due to waste products or the oxygen has been used 
up.
	
✓	Death phase: In death phase, the cells begin to die. As their numbers 
decrease, the growth curve declines.

The growth curve for a particular microorganism is always the same when 
grown under the same conditions. This is helpful when studying the meta-
bolic characteristics of a microbe or estimating how long it will take it to 
grow up to a certain number of cells.
If a microbial culture is given infinite nutrients and the waste products of 
its metabolism are taken away, then much higher cell densities are pos-
sible. This technique is often used in industry in a process called continuous 
culture.
Inhibiting Microbial Growth
The terminology used to describe methods for reducing or removing microbes 
from a surface can sometimes be confusing. There are different reasons for 
wanting to get rid of microbes, but not all of them require sterilization (the 
complete eradication of all living things), which is needed for surgical equip-
ment. For the purposes of food preparation, for example, steps are used to 
ensure that foodborne pathogens that could make people sick have been 
removed. An example of this is commercial sterilization used on canned food, 
where the conditions are used to reduce the chances of including spores that 
cause botulism, but the food is not completely sterile. When cleaning a place 
where food is served, like a restaurant, the process of sanitation gets rid of 
microbes that can be passed between people. Disinfection is the removal of 
growing microbial cells from a surface. When that surface is skin, the disinfect-
ing agent is milder and is called an antiseptic.

Part II: Balancing the Dynamics of Microbial Life 
Another distinction to make is whether a chemical is bacteriostatic (which 
stops the growth of bacteria but doesn’t kill it) or bacteriocidal (which does 
kill bacteria).
In this section, we tell you about some of the compounds known to have 
activity in inhibiting microbial growth.
Physical methods
These physical methods disrupt proteins, killing microorganisms, and some 
have been used specifically to destroy bacterial endospores.
Heat, although useful for destroying microbes, isn’t enough to sterilize most 
things. It’s only in the combination of heat with pressure that resistant spores 
are killed. This is accomplished with special equipment like an autoclave or 
pressure cooker that uses steam under pressure.
In the absence of pressure, heat can kill most microbes, which is why boiling 
things in water for ten minutes is recommended to be fairly safe, although it 
won’t be free of the spores of some bacteria, if present.
If the object to be sterilized can withstand high heat, like metal can, then 
flaming can be used. With this method, the object is placed directly into a 
flame or is first dipped into alcohol that is then ignited. Needless to say, this 
is an effective way to sterilize an object.
Pasteurization is the heating of things like milk and beer at lower tempera-
tures than what would be needed to sterilize them in order to kill pathogens 
and lower microbial numbers while still protecting the flavor of the product. 
Two technological advances to the food industry include high-temperature 
short-time (HTST) pasteurization and ultra-high-temperature (UHT) treat-
ment, the latter of which actually sterilizes the product without severely 
impacting its flavor.
Liquid solutions can be sterilized by filtration through a membrane with a 
pore size smaller than the microbes to be removed. For bacteria and fungi, 
pore size is 0.22 µm to 0.45 µm, but for viruses and some sneaky bacteria it’s 
closer to 0.1 µm.
Low temperature serves to slow or halt the growth of most microbes. Some, 
however, can grow at low temperatures. If you want proof of this, just think of 
how leftovers can spoil in the refrigerator if left for too long.

103
 Chapter 7: Measuring Microbial Growth
There are several examples of radiation used to kill microorganisms. The 
first example is ionizing radiation such as X-rays and gamma rays that either 
directly damage cells or indirectly damage them via the production of free 
radicals. The second kind is nonionizing radiation that comes from ultraviolet 
(UV) light, which causes irreversible changes in a microbe’s DNA that make it 
useless.
Disinfectants
Examples of disinfectants are all around us. Some are easily identified and 
others are harder to spot. Here are some of them:
	
✓	A type of phenol that comes from coal tar is called a cresol and is the 
main ingredient in Lysol. A bisphenol called triclosan has been used in 
the manufacture of kitchen utensils like cutting boards to deter micro-
bial growth.
	
✓	Halogens like iodine and chlorine have been used for centuries and are 
still used today to treat water (iodine tablets) and in the household dis-
infectant Clorox.
	
✓	Alcohol is a convenient disinfectant that works for many microbes but 
isn’t able to get rid of endospores or unenveloped viruses.
	
✓	Heavy metals like silver, copper, and mercury are very effective against 
microorganisms and along with their historical use in medicine and 
industry have recently been incorporated into sporting equipment and 
clothing to reduce the microbes that cause odor.

he earth has undergone major geologic and climatic changes since it 
was formed 4.5 billion years ago. When microbes first appeared, the 
earth was very different than it is today. As the earth changed, it provided 
microbes with new opportunities for diversification. As microorganisms 
evolved, they had a significant impact on the earth’s atmosphere, leading to 
even more profound changes that made possible the diversity of life we see 
today. Organizing our understanding of microbial diversity involves learn-
ing about how to tell microbes apart and how to name them. Measuring the 
diversity of microorganisms today lets us read the history of microbial evolu-
tion, which, as it turns out, is also our evolutionary history.
Where Did Microbes Come From?
The earth was formed around 4 billion years ago, but before life could spring 
forth, the earth had to cool to below 100°C, making it possible for water to 
exist as a liquid. After the oceans formed, the surface of the planet was still 
extremely volatile, with asteroid crashes and cosmic radiation bombarding 
the surface. For these reasons, scientists think that life began not on the sur-
face in warm ponds, but deep in the ocean near hydrothermal vents (openings 
where water heated by the earth’s core escaped to the surface). In the mud 
near hydrothermal vents, energy and elements were likely plentiful and con-
ditions for the first life forms may have been right.

108
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Tracing the origins of life
Within this ancient mud at the bottom of the ocean, the following processes 
likely happened:
	
1.	 The formation of organic molecules was catalyzed spontaneously and 
without live cells. These organic molecules included lipids, amino acids, 
nucleic acids, and sugars. No one was around to consume this first 
organic material, so it just accumulated.
	
2.	 Ribonucleic acids (RNA) formed, some with catalytic activities (meaning 
that they helped chemical reactions to happen). These catalytic RNAs 
are called ribozymes because they’re made of RNA but have activities 
like enzymes. One of the activities of an early ribozyme was replication 
of RNA, making self-replicating RNA.
	
3.	 Another activity of early ribozymes was protein synthesis. Proteins with 
enzyme activities started catalyzing biochemical reactions, including 
nucleic acid replication.
	
4.	 Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evolved and was more stable than RNA, so 
it took over the role of storing genetic information. The flow of genetic 
information in the molecular biology of life was then set:
DNA → RNA → Protein
	
5.	 Last, lipid membranes were formed. They encircle things and have 
embedded within them proteins that can move molecules from one side 
to the other. Lipid-enclosed biochemical processes were protected from 
the randomness of the outside world and the cell was born!
The cell has undergone many improvements in the billions of years since it 
arose, but it remains fundamentally the same today. Exceptions include some 
viruses that store their genetic material as RNA and contain the enzyme 
reverse transcriptase, the discovery of which added an arrow from RNA to 
DNA to the above equation. In Chapter 14, a discussion of viruses highlights 
some other exceptions to these steps.
Diversifying early prokaryotes
Early on, primitive cells diverged in two different directions, eventually giving 
rise to bacteria and archaea. Each of these branches was likely well suited to 
different environmental conditions, so each gave rise to different structural 

109
 Chapter 8: Appreciating Microbial Ancestry
and metabolic specializations. Bacteria and archaea would have had to 
develop processes that were similar to each other to survive, yet the exact 
details would be different in each. Table 8-1 gives some examples.

Organisms need a source of carbon and a source of energy. The carbon is used 
to make the carbon-containing molecules used for cell structure and as energy 
storage. The energy is used to power metabolic and other cellular processes.
Different types of metabolism evolved, each with its own substrates and 
waste products. As early microbes consumed one substrate, others evolved 
to use a new energy or carbon source. The products of their metabolism built 
up and had a great impact on the chemical composition of the earth.
The impact of prokaryotes  
on the early earth
Early phototrophs used sunlight as energy, but it wasn’t until oxygenic photo-
trophs (which produced oxygen as a waste product) evolved that the diversity 
of life really started to take off. At first, the oxygen produced merely reacted 
with all the reduced compounds around. But after a couple hundred million 
years, oxygen eventually accumulated to levels that were high enough for 
aerobic microorganisms to evolve. It was another 2 billion years before oxygen 
levels in the atmosphere would get up to the 21 percent that they are today.

110
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Why did the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere allow such an explosion 
of different forms of life? The amount of energy gained from reducing O2 to 
H2O is very high, so aerobic organisms can grow much more quickly than 
anaerobic organisms, producing many more cells from the same amount of a 
resource. Many more cells means many more mutations capable of adapting 
to new niches. What the rising oxygen levels meant for anaerobic microorgan-
isms is that their reduced substrates were limited as oxygen spontaneously 
reacted with them. For many anaerobic microorganisms, oxygen was toxic, so 
they could either develop mechanisms to deal with it or be restricted to loca-
tions without oxygen.
As oxygen levels rose, microorganisms with organelles, the eukaryotes, 
evolved. This was the beginning of what is now the domain Eukarya. It 
started with algae that diversified extensively in the oceans and eventually 
gave rise to large multicellular organisms. Within 600 million years, these 
large multicellular organisms gave rise to the many forms of plants and ani-
mals that have lived and are alive today.
Hitching a ride: Endosymbiosis
The fundamental difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells is 
the presence of a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, which made 
many early microbiologists assume that the two had different evolution-
ary beginnings. In fact, many aspects of eukaryotic biology are more simi-
lar to members of the Archaea than to members of the Bacteria. It turns 
out that eukaryotes evolved from an archaeal ancestor that engulfed but 
didn’t destroy a bacterial cell, resulting in a symbiotic relationship called 
endosymbiosis (see Figure 8-1). This symbiotic relationship gave rise to the 
Eukaryotes.
Ozone, we love you
As the earth’s atmosphere became filled with 
oxygen (O2), some of it reacted with ultraviolet 
(UV) radiation to form ozone (O3). It formed a thick 
layer in the upper atmosphere that still covers 
many parts of the earth today. Because ozone 
absorbs radiation much better than plain air does, 
it protected the earth’s surface from strong UV 
and cosmic radiation. Up until that point, the levels 
of radiation bombarding the surface were too high 
to allow cells to survive. With protection from 
the ozone layer, life could now leave the relative 
protection of the sea to start colonizing the land, 
leading to an explosion of organisms adapted to 
terrestrial and freshwater habitats.

Figure 8-1: 
Endosym­
biosis.
There is still some question about the exact order in which this happened, 
but evolutionary biologists generally agree that the following things hap-
pened within a common archaea-eukaryote ancestor cell:
	
1.	 An aerobic bacterial cell was engulfed to eventually become the 
mitochondrion.
	
2.	 A nuclear membrane formed around the chromosome of the cell.
	
3.	 A cyanobacteria was engulfed to eventually become the chloroplast, 
giving rise to the algae and eventually plants.
	
4.	 Membrane-bound organelles formed.
The result is an evolutionary tree like the one shown in Figure 8-2.

112
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Figure 8-2: 
The tree of 
life, includ-
ing endo-
symbiotic 
events.
The advantages of endosymbiosis were obvious for the bacteria. Bacteria 
could give up having to defend themselves from being engulfed and having 
to acquire their own food. The host cell could use some of the hydrogen and 
the energy produced by the bacteria for the small price of some substrates 
and having to carry around extra cargo. Cells at that time were likely experi-
menting with increased size and could use the extra energy to power cellular 
processes.
Photosynthetic eukaryotes show up in the evolutionary record later so sci-
entists think that this early eukaryotic cell, with mitochondria and a nucleus, 
engulfed a cyanobacteria so that it could use sunlight for energy as well. Next 
to the diversification of prokaryotes, the appearance of eukaryotes marks 
the second major explosion of diversity with much more complex cells that 
could take advantage of brand new habitats.
History repeats itself
The endosymbiotic events that gave rise to 
mitochondria and chloroplasts were essential 
in giving rise to the eukaryotes. The photosyn-
thetic eukaryotes that emerged from this were 
ancestors to the green and red algae and to 
the plants. Then, nonphototropic eukaryotic 
microbes engulfed a green or red algae in a 
secondary endosymbiosis event, giving rise to 
some of the other protist forms we see today.

113
 Chapter 8: Appreciating Microbial Ancestry
Understanding Evolution
Before we can talk about the study of evolution in microorganisms, we should 
first describe exactly what evolution is. Evolution is made up of a few parts:
	
✓	The descent of one organism from another, also known as ancestry. The 
ancestors of a species are called its lineage.
	
✓	Differences between individuals in different generations.
	
✓	Environmental pressures that favor the traits of one individual over 
another. This is the driving force of evolution called natural selection. 
The individual habitats with all their specific environmental pressures is 
called a niche.
For evolution to work, there has to also be extinction, where the survival of 
the more successful organisms provides the stock for the next round of diver-
sification and selection. In this way, over time, lineages become more and 
more specialized for their niches. Figure 8-3 shows the theoretical evolution 
of different species over a time period.
	
Figure 8-3: 
Lineages 
arise due to 
evolution.
	
	
Mutations (changes) between generations affect many different characteris-
tics of the species, but only the ones that give it an advantage are kept. Some 
mutations are deadly or make the individual less successful, other mutations 
are neutral, and still others provide an advantage. Only the neutral and benefi-
cial mutations remain throughout the evolutionary history of that species.

114
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
	
Evolution of animals happens on time scales that are too long for us to observe. 
Even the evolution of organisms with short periods between generations is too 
slow to see in a lifetime. Bacterial generations are sometimes on the order of 
minutes, and evolution of lab strains can be measured, but it’s tricky to measure 
in nature.
Genetically similar organisms living in the same habitat and having the same 
environmental pressures are called ecotypes. When changes accumulate that 
are beneficial enough to give one member of an ecotype an advantage over 
the others (see Figure 8-4), it will reproduce much more quickly than the 
others and eventually swamp them out until they’re extinct. But if conditions 
change, different members of one ecotype can continue to exist, each taking 
advantage of different resources, making them into two new ecotypes.

Ecotypes.

 Chapter 8: Appreciating Microbial Ancestry
Studying Evolution
There are many different methods used to identify microbes. Some take 
advantage of metabolic differences between microorganisms by using bio-
chemical tests to exclude groups one by one until a single species or strain 
is left. Others look at aspects that all microorganisms have — for instance 
DNA — and measure the differences between them.
Each of these approaches is important to identifying a microorganism. The 
first approach, based on looking at the unique aspects of each microbe, is 
used extensively in medical microbiology and is covered in Chapter 17. The 
second approach, based on the similarities between microorganisms, is used 
most often to study evolutionary relationships and is covered here and used 
in Chapter 18.
Phylogeny (the study of the evolutionary history) of the organisms alive today 
is possible by looking at the differences in their DNA. Notice in Figure 8-2 that 
all the species present now have common ancestors. If changes in the DNA are 
preserved from when the change happened until today, calculating the related-
ness of organisms based on the degrees of difference between them should be 
possible.
Choosing marker genes
Changes from one generation to another are a result of mutations to an organ-
ism’s DNA. Some mutations are beneficial, others are detrimental, and many 
are neutral. These neutral mutations don’t affect evolution, so they build up 
in the genome and increase the number of genetic differences between spe-
cies. If you consider that throughout evolution each organism carries with 
them all the changes that have occurred to the DNA of their ancestors, then 
an organism’s genome contains a record of its evolutionary history.
To calculate the genetic changes within individuals, marker genes are used. 
These are genes that
	
✓	Are present in all organisms
	
✓	Are essential, so they aren’t lost or inactive in some individuals
	
✓	Haven’t changed too quickly, so they still have a lot of similarity overall
	
Examples of marker genes include the gene for the small subunit of the ribo-
somal RNA, elongation factor Tu gene, and the DNA gyrase gene, among others. 
The most widely used is the small ribosomal subunit gene. In bacteria and 
archaea, this is the 16S rRNA gene, and in eukaryotes it’s the 18S rRNA gene. 

116
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
This rRNA gene in particular has been extremely useful for taxonomic assign-
ments, as well as phylogenetic studies, but it isn’t always ideal for distinguish-
ing between very closely related organisms. To do that, either several different 
genes or the whole genome are compared.
Different genes accumulate changes at different rates. Some, like the 16S 
rRNA genes, change slowly, likely because their function is essential, so 
changes that affect function are quickly selected against. Other genes, like 
those for luminescence (the production of light), change more quickly over 
time because their function is more flexibly controlled. More slowly evolving 
genes are useful for telling the difference between distantly related microor-
ganisms, whereas more quickly evolving genes are better for distinguishing 
between closely related species.
Seeing the direction of gene transfer 
in prokaryotes
One of the challenges in determining the evolutionary history of organisms 
based on the genetic code of bacteria and archaea is that they can transfer 
their genetic code in more ways than one, both horizontally and vertically.
Vertical gene transfer
Vertical gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from the parent 
directly to the progeny. In bacteria and archaea, this is done through cell divi-
sion. Errors during replication of the parent genome are transferred to each 
of the daughter cells, resulting in mutations that may persist through the 
next generations.
Horizontal gene transfer
Horizontal gene transfer, sometimes called lateral gene transfer, is the incorpo-
ration in the genome of whole genes or other large sections of DNA from an 
outside source. This happens through several mechanisms, including trans-
formation and transfection (see Chapter 6).
The impact of horizontal transfer is that genes from completely unrelated 
species can be present within the same genome. This complicates phylo-
genetic analysis based on the differences in DNA sequence because it is 
assumed that mutations accumulated over time happen through vertical 
gene transfer.

Classifying and Naming Microbes
Taxonomy is the science of classifying living organisms for the purpose of
	
✓	Telling them apart
	
✓	Describing an individual
	
✓	Allowing microbiologists to speak a universal language
	
✓	Sorting out their evolution
Classification is the formal ranking that all described species are grouped 
into. Table 8-2 gives examples for a few different microbes. Ranks are ordered 
from the most inclusive at the top to the most specific at the bottom.

Many unofficial ranks are added by taxonomists to help them make sense of 
complicated groups of organisms, but none of these is official. One helpful unof-
ficial ranking for microbiologists is that of a strain (a subspecies label for bac-
teria that are within the same species but have different characteristics, called 
phenotypes). An example of a strain is E. coli strain 0H157:H7, which can make 
people sick, when the majority of the rest of the species is harmless.

118
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Nomenclature is the naming system, based on Latin words, given to each 
species. All described species are given a two-part name that is considered 
its scientific name in contrast to its common name. The two-name system is 
important for having an accurate record of each individual species described 
to date. The complete name is made up of the genus and species — for exam-
ple Escherichia coli in Table 8-2, is always italicized and is often shortened to 
an initial for the genus and the species name: E. coli.
	
The genus can be thought of as a noun and the species name as an adjective. 
For instance, Escherichia is a Latinized version of the last name of Theodor 
Escherich, who discovered this bacterium, and coli means “of the colon.” 
Other examples include Homo (“man”) sapiens (“wise”) and Staphylococcus 
(“bacteria that look like a bunch of grapes”) aureus (“golden”).
Organizing and keeping track of all of the known prokaryotes is a big job, but 
several resources exist:
	
✓	Guides for identification and classification: These are essential when 
describing a new strain or species or when trying to identify a strain. 
The gold standard for this is Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, 
which has both descriptions of and methods for identifying organisms 
based on growth and metabolism.
	
✓	Culture collections: Culture collections are an important resource 
because they keep live cultures of microorganisms that can be bought 
by microbiologists. Examples include: ATCC (www.atcc.org/en/
Products/Cells_and_Microorganisms.aspx), BCCM (http://
bccm.belspo.be/catalogues), and CIP (http://www.pasteur.
fr/ip/easysite/pasteur/en/research/collections), among 
others.
	
✓	Lists of currently described microorganisms: These are easy to browse 
and search through. Some examples include: List of Prokaryotic Names 
with Standing in Nomenclature (www.bacterio.cict.fr), Bacterial 
Nomenclature Up-to-Date (www.dsmz.de/bactnom/bactname.htm), 
and Taxonomy Browser (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy)
With the use of modern phylogenetic techniques, the classification and 
naming of many microorganisms, especially bacteria, have changed as micro-
biologists have realized that some species within the same genus were actu-
ally distantly related to each other and more closely related to other species. 
Two important examples are the reclassification of many members of very 
large genera into their own separate genus. For example, some Streptococcus 
species were renamed as Enterococcus sp. and some Pseudomonas species as 
Burkholderia species. This has proven to be important especially in tracing 
the origins of a human infection.

 Chapter 8: Appreciating Microbial Ancestry
Climbing the Tree of Life
It’s natural to be confused about how many domains of life there are. Intuitively, 
it seems like there is such a variety of life around us that we can observe with 
our own eyes. Historically, scientists have gone through many versions of 
the tree of life before coming up with the one we use today. Until the advent 
of molecular phylogenetics, there were many different classification systems 
based on methods available at each time. A big problem was always where to 
put the bacteria.
Before microscopy became sensitive enough to see subcellular structure, 
bacteria were grouped with algae and fungi as part of the kingdom Planta. 
Next, the question was whether to have a separate kingdom for the pro-
tists and include in it all the microscopic organisms. The term kingdom has 
even been superseded by the higher ranking of domain. Within the domain 
Bacteria and Archaea there are no kingdom ranks, yet this rank is important 
within the domain Eukarya. Based on DNA sequencing of the 16S and 18S 
rRNA genes, we now have a universally accepted three domain system, which 
includes the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eukarya domains (see Chapter 3).
Clearing up the concept of a species 
in microbiology
In regular biology, a species is defined as group 
of organisms isolated from breeding with others 
either by genetics or circumstance, termed 
reproductive isolation. The concept of repro-
ductive isolation only works for organisms that 
reproduce sexually, so a different approach had 
to be taken for prokaryotes.
The current species concept for prokaryotes 
is based on 16S rRNA gene identity and DNA-
DNA hybridization. Together, these two meth-
ods can distinguish between most species. In 
medical microbiology, bacteria are identified 
by specific biochemical and physiological tests 
aimed at separating different disease-causing 
microbes, but of course this doesn’t work for all 
organisms.
Another approach has been proposed for defin-
ing species: the phylogenetic species concept, 
where several conserved genes are used to 
build a better evolutionary history for bacteria 
or archaea. More complex phylogenies are 
both more useful and harder to make than phy-
logenies based on a single gene.
It’s hard to even guess how many total bacte-
ria and archaea species there are today, partly 
because of the difficulty in defining a species 
and partly because we just don’t have the 
resources to describe them all. To date, 7,000 
species of bacteria and archaea have been 
found for certain, with likely tens or hundreds 
of times more (maybe even a million total!) that 
haven’t been identified.

120
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Phylum and lower-level reorganization happens often as we discover and 
describe new organisms. In fact, the fine level detail of the phylogenetic trees 
shown in this book will likely have changed by the time you’re reading this!
	
Viruses aren’t classified in the tree of life because they aren’t technically alive. 
They use the machinery of their host cell to reproduce, and their genomes can 
become incorporated into and mingled with that of their host.
Continuing the debate
Since 1978, taxonomists have enjoyed the cer-
tainty that there are three domains of life, but 
recently this concept has been challenged. 
New evidence for the existence of only two 
domains is causing controversy in the field. The 
debate involves how to organize the branches 
of Archaea and Eukarya.
If each domain represents a distinct splitting 
of evolutionary paths, then members of one 
domain should never be found to arise from 
another domain, but there is some evidence 
that this is the case with the Archaea and 
Eukarya. Because these branching events 
happened over 3 billion years ago, piecing 
together the history is very tricky. Also, because 
the Archaea were only discovered in the last  
40 years, their evolutionary history is still being 
filled in as new members are found.
It’s an exciting time for evolutionary biologists 
as new species are found that help answer 
questions about how life began!

iving cells need energy, and they need carbon compounds that make up 
the bulk of the material in a cell. Microbes can get energy from the chem-
ical bonds of complex compounds, from light or heat energy or by stripping 
electrons from molecules in their surroundings. Many microbes fix carbon by 
reducing CO2 from their surroundings (plants do this, too); this provides not 
only for their carbon needs but also for the needs of organisms that can’t fix 
carbon from CO2. In order to fix carbon, an organism has to have a source of 
reducing power (provided by electron donors).
This chapter explains how microorganisms harvest energy from light or from 
inorganic compounds, how they get the reducing power they need, and the 
processes used to fix carbon.
Forging Ahead with Autotrophic 
Processes
For microbial cells, two things are at the top their list of priorities:
	
✓	Obtaining energy with which to create a proton motive force used to 
generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
	
✓	Converting carbon into cellular material
If a microorganism gets its carbon from organic material, the microorgan-
ism is a heterotroph. If the microorganism gets its carbon from inorganic 
carbon, like CO2, then it’s an autotroph. There are plenty of autotrophs in 

122
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
the microbial world, several of which are discussed here. One of the most 
common ways of assimilating CO2 into cellular material is through the Calvin 
cycle.
Fixing carbon
The biological world — from microorganisms to humans — is made of 
carbon-based life. So, all forms of life have to obtain carbon for their cellu-
lar material. But whereas all other organisms have to use organic (reduced 
carbon) substrates for food, autotrophs have devised ways of reducing the 
CO2 from the air, a process called fixing carbon.
There are a few different ways to fix carbon, which we cover in this section.
The Calvin cycle
This method of reducing atmospheric CO2 is used by all green plants, purple 
bacteria, cyanobacteria, algae, and most chemolithotrophic bacteria, among 
others. It’s no surprise then that the first enzyme in the cycle, ribulose bisphos-
phate carboxylase (better known as RuBisCO), is the most abundant protein on 
earth. RuBisCO makes two molecules of phosphoglyceric acid (PGA) from ribu-
lose bisphosphate and CO2 (see Figure 9-1). PGA then has a phosphate group 
(PO3
–) added to it, after which PGA is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is one of the intermediates in the pathway of 
glucose breakdown called glycolysis, so using the fact that the enzymes for 
glycolysis can function in the reverse direction, as most enzymes can, glu-
cose is then made from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. In this way, the cell has 
taken CO2 from the atmosphere, put in ATP and NADPH, and made glucose, 
which can be used for building cellular material or as energy if needed.
Carbon: A versatile atom
The reason all life on earth is carbon based is 
that the material that makes up cells contains 
chains of carbon atoms. Carbon is one of the 
few versatile atoms with which this is possible 
because
	✓	It’s abundant on earth.
	✓	It’s able to form four bonds with other atoms.
	✓	It’s small enough that the strength of these 
bonds can support branching structures.
This makes it thermodynamically possible to 
use carbon building blocks to create all the 
many different shapes of molecules necessary 
in the cell.

123
 Chapter 9: Harnessing Energy, Fixing Carbon
	
NADPH is the reduced form of NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phos-
phate), a cofactor used by the cell to shuttle electrons between reactions (see 
Chapter 5).
Here are the important steps to remember (refer to Figure 9-1):
	
✓	Carbon fixation: Six molecules of CO2 are incorporated by 6 molecules 
of ribulose bisphosphate (5 carbons each) to make 12 molecules of PGA 
(three carbons each).
	
✓	Reduction: Twelve molecules of ATP and NADPH are consumed during 
the rearrangement of the carbons to form 12 molecules of glyceral-
dehyde 3-phosphate (3 carbons each), which are converted into 6 
molecules of ribulose 5-phosphate (5 carbons each) and 1 molecule 
of glucose (C6H12O6).
	
✓	Regeneration of ribulose bisphosphate: Six more molecules of ATP are 
then required to phosphorylate the 6 ribulose 5-phosphates returning 
each of them to the CO2 acceptor molecule ribulose bisphosphate.

the Calvin 
cycle.

Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
	
During the Calvin cycle 18 ATP, 12 NADPH, and 6 CO2 are used to make one glu-
cose molecule.
A cellular structure used by autotrophic prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) 
is called the caboxysome. The carboxysome is small compared to the size 
of the cell and is used to trap CO2 and concentrate it along with crystalline 
layers of 250 or so molecules of RuBisCO. As CO2 enters the carboxysome, 
the first step of carbon fixation is facilitated because RuBisCO and CO2 end 
up in close proximity with one another.
A second important function of the caboxysome is to keep the RuBisCO 
enzyme away from O2. When oxygen is present, the enzyme will sometimes 
combine O2 and ribulose bisphosphate (a process called oxygenation) instead 
of carboxylating it (combining it with CO2). When this happens it becomes 
much more expensive, in terms of ATP and reducing power (electron donors), 
for the cell to use the oxygenated ribulose bisphosphate in further reactions.
Alternative pathways
Two other carbon-fixation pathways — which are used by the green sulfur 
and the green nonsulfur bacteria — are the reverse citric acid cycle and the 
hydroxypropionate pathway. The reverse citric acid cycle uses many of the 
enzymes of the citric acid cycle in the reverse direction. The hydroxypropio-
nate pathway may be one of the earliest forms of autotrophy on earth.
The reverse citric acid cycle
Two key steps of the reverse citric acid cycle are catalyzed by ferredoxin-
linked enzymes that work to reduce CO2 (see Figure 9-2). The first one carbox-
ylates (adds a carboxyl group made of a carbon two oxygens and a hydrogen) 
succinyl-CoA to form α-ketoglutarate, and the second carboxylates acetyl-CoA 
to pyruvate. Other steps in this process simply reverse the action of most of 
the enzymes in the regular citric acid cycle (see Chapter 5).
	
Ferredoxin is a nonheme iron-sulfur protein, one of the proteins important for 
the light reactions in these bacteria that acts as a strong electron donor.
Each turn of the reverse citric acid cycle uses three molecules of CO2 to make 
pyruvate, which is then converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which can 
be used to make cell material. This autotrophic pathway is common in the 
green sulfur bacteria, but it has been seen among a few other groups so it’s 
likely widespread among prokaryotes.

cycle.
	
The hydroxypropionate pathway
Another autotrophic pathway that hasn’t been seen widely among microbes 
is the hydroxypropionate pathway, which has been described mainly in 
Chloroflexus, a type of green nonsulfur bacteria. In this pathway, two mol-
ecules of CO2 are converted to glyoxylate and on to cell material. Because 
Chloroflexus is thought to be the ancestor of most of the other bacterial 
groups that use sunlight for energy, and because this pathway has only been 
found here and among very ancient archaea, this pathway is thought to be 
one of the oldest forms of autotrophy for photosynthetic organisms on earth.
Using the Energy in Light
Phototrophy is the use of light energy to make ATP to power cellular pro-
cesses. Organisms that can do this are called phototrophs. Photosynthesis is 
the conversion of light energy into chemical energy and is the process by 
which phototrophs use light energy.
As we mention earlier in this chapter, all organisms need a carbon source; 
those that reduce inorganic CO2 are called autotrophs, whereas those that use 
organic carbon are heterotrophs. It won’t come as a surprise, then, when we 
put these terms together to describe organisms that use light energy for ATP 
and CO2 (photoautotrophs) or organic carbon (photoheterotrophs) as a carbon 
source . As a side note, chemolithotrophic reactions, which we cover later in 
this chapter, are those that use inorganic compounds, instead of light, for 
energy to generate ATP.

126

Harvesting light: Chlorophylls  
and bacteriochlorophylls
Phototrophs are able to capture the energy in light thanks to photosynthetic 
pigments, like chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll, which absorb light energy 
kicking off a process that eventually results in the production of ATP. There 
are two main types of photosynthesis: those that generate oxygen (called 
oxygenic photosynthesis) and those that don’t (called anoxygenic photosyn-
thesis). For the most part, oxygenic phototrophs have chlorophyll whereas 
anoxygenic phototrophs have bacteriochlorophyll.
The overall structure of these two pigments is very similar (see Figure 9-3). 
They both have the distinctive tetrapyrrole ring with a Mg2+ in the center and 
a long 20-carbon phytol tail that helps anchor them to the photosynthetic 
membrane. The differences occur in the substitutions around the ring (high-
lighted in Figure 9-3) and in the length and substitutions on the phytol tail.
There are four different types of chlorophyll; a and b are the most common. 
There are also seven known variants of bacteriochlorophylls. These types of 
chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll differ in structure, and those differences 
affect the specific wavelength of light that each can absorb, which allows 
several different species of microbes together to collect the full spectrum 
of light, each absorbing a different range of wavelengths. Here is a list of the 
known types of chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll:
Using light energy
Sunlight is electromagnetic radiation with a 
wide range of wavelengths. The visible spec­
trum, or the part that we can see, is only a tiny 
part of the electromagnetic range and it’s made 
up of all the colors that we see. Each color is 
measured in wavelengths and carries a dif-
ferent amount of energy. A wavelength, as its 
name implies, is the distance a photon of light 
travels along a wavelike trajectory. Light with a 
shorter wavelength has a higher frequency, and 
vice versa. Higher-frequency light has more 
energy than lower-frequency light.
For our purposes, the wavelengths we need to 
talk about are between around 300 nanometers 
(nm) and 900 nm in length because light in this 
range is absorbed by microbes for energy. The 
other cool thing about light is that when one par-
ticular wavelength is absorbed — say, blue light 
at 420 nm — the rest of the light in the spectrum 
will assume the complementary color — in this 
case, yellow — and be seen that way by our 
eyes. Just outside the visible range (400 nm to 
800 nm) are wavelengths that can also be used 
by microbes, in the ultraviolet part (300 nm to 
400 nm) and the infrared part (around 900 nm) of 
the spectrum. Light in the ultraviolet and infra-
red part of the spectrum are sometimes referred 
to ultraviolet or infrared radiation.

127
 Chapter 9: Harnessing Energy, Fixing Carbon
	
✓	Chlorophyll a absorbs red light (around 680 nm) and is the main pig-
ment in higher plants, many algae and the cyanobacteria.
	
✓	Chlorophyll b also absorbs red light (660 nm) and is found in all higher 
plants, as well as a group of bacteria called prochlorophytes.
	
✓	Chlorophyll c is found in eukaryotic microbes, like marine and fresh­
water algae, and absorbs red light (between 450 and 640).
	
✓	Chlorophyll d is found in a type of cyanobacterium that lives in areas 
lacking visible light, but containing infrared radiation (700 nm to 730 nm), 
like nestled underneath corals and algae.
	
✓	Bacteriochlorophyll a and b absorb infrared radiation (in the range of 
800 to 1,040 nm) and are found in the purple bacteria.
	
✓	Bacteriochlorophyll c, d, and e absorb far red light (in the 720 nm to 
755 nm range) and are found in the green sulfur bacteria.
	
✓	Bacteriochlorophyll cs also absorbs far red light (720 nm) and is found 
in the green nonsulfur bacteria.
	
✓	Bacteriochlorophyll g absorbs red or far red light (at either 670 nm or 
788 nm) and is found in the heliobacteria.

Another kind of photosynthetic pigment found originally in marine archaea 
but now known to be more widespread in the ocean is bacteriorhodopsin. 
Membrane proteins bind retinal pigments forming a light-driven proton pump. 
Most of them absorb green light (between 500 nm and 650 nm) and appear 
purple. This relatively simple pigment captures light without accessory pig-
ments to act as antenna. The exact mechanisms of bacteriorhodopsin-driven 
carbon fixation are still being studied. Since their recent discovery, several 

128
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
other bacteria and archaea have been found to have bacteriorhodopsins with 
different adsorption spectra, allowing them to live at different water depths 
where the wavelengths of light available are filtered as depth increases.
The kind of pigment-binding proteins present determine the absorption maxima 
for an organism. The absorption maxima is the range of wavelengths of light 
that provide the most energy to that organism. There are many types of these 
pigment-binding proteins, and their position around the light-harvesting pig-
ments can change the spectrum of light absorbed. The combination of light-
harvesting pigments and pigment-binding proteins is called the photocomplex 
and always occur within a membrane. The arrangement within a membrane is 
essential for creating the proton motive force necessary to generate ATP.
The photocomplexes are organized so that there is a central reaction center 
(usually made of chlorophyll or bacteriochlorophyll) around which as many 
as 300 accessory pigments are arranged to gather up the light energy and pass 
it to the reaction center. When the surrounding pigments contain additional 
chlorophyll or bacteriochlorophylls, they’re appropriately called antennae, 
because they absorb as much light as possible and funnel it to the reaction 
center. The pigments in the reaction center participate directly in the reac-
tions involved in converting light energy to chemical energy. This setup is 
especially essential for phototrophs that live in low light conditions.
Photosynthetic membranes, which house the photocomplexes, occur in 
all phototrophs, but their structure can be very different in each organism. 
In eukaryotes, which have cellular compartments called organelles, it’s 
common to find structures called chloroplasts. Chlorplasts contain thylakoid 
membranes arranged in stacks called grana (see Figure 9-4a) and participate 
in generating the proton motive force during photosynthesis. In microorgan-
isms that don’t have traditional organelles, like the bacteria and archaea, a 
variety of photosynthetic membranes can be found:
	
✓	The cyanobacteria have thylakoid membranes, which are not contained 
within a chloroplast.
	
✓	The purple bacteria use structures called lamellae, that are made by the 
inward folding of the cytoplasmic membrane (see Figure 9-4b) and chro-
matophores (see Figure 9-4c), that are vesicular structures made from 
the membrane.
	
✓	The cytoplasmic membrane itself is used by the heliobacteria.
	
✓	The chlorosome, a specialized structure in the green bacteria, allows 
growth in environments such as deep in lakes and in areas that have 
the lowest light intensities. Instead of the antenna pigments surround-
ing the reaction center within the photosynthetic membrane, they’re 
arranged into dense arrays inside the chlorosome, which lies adjacent to 
the cytoplasmic membrane where the reaction centers are located (see 
Figure 9-4d).

Helping photosynthesis out: Carotenoids 
and phycobilins
Making a living from light energy is a double-edged sword — it means being 
constantly exposed to a source energy that can be harmful. Bright light 
causes the formation of singlet oxygen (1O2) through photo-oxidation reac-
tions. Singlet oxygen, and free radicals in general, are toxic because they can 
randomly energize other molecules. When members of the photosynthetic 
complex are oxidized by singlet oxygen, they become nonfunctional, which 
can cause major problems. Carotenoids come to the rescue by absorbing 
high-energy blue light (440 nm to 490 nm) and quenching the toxic oxygen 
species (namely, 1O2) before they cause damage.
Carotenoids are the reason many photosynthetic bacteria, other than the 
cyanobacteria, appear in bright colors of pink, red, brown, or yellow. This is 
because they absorb blue light and reflect red, brown, or yellow and because 
of the sheer number of them in the cell. Although carotenoids can act as 
accessory pigments transferring the light energy they’ve gathered to the 
reaction center, for the most part they’re photoprotective.
Members of another class of pigments called phycobilins are important to 
cyanobacteria and red algae. They enhance the light-gathering ability of these 
organisms by absorbing energy and transferring it to the main chlorophylls 
involved in photosynthesis. Red phycobilins absorb green light (550 nm), 
whereas blue phycobilins absorb red light (620 nm). All phycobilins have a 
structure called a bilin, which is a pyrrole ring along an open chain (seen in 
the nearby sidebar), and are bound to a protein to make the a complex called 
a phycobiliprotein. Many phycobiliproteins combine to form a phycobilisome, 
a structure of tightly packed light-harvesting molecules that help cyanobacte-
ria and algae to grow in places with very low light levels.

Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Generating oxygen (or not): Oxygenic 
and anoxygenic photosynthesis
The purpose of photosynthesis is to harness light energy and use it to move 
electrons through an electron transport chain. Electron carriers are arranged, 
in order of increasing electropositivity within a membrane. Through this pro-
cess, a proton motive force is created that is used to produce ATP.
	
Electronegative compounds are better at donating electrons than electroposi-
tive ones are. As electropositivity increases, a compound becomes better at 
accepting electrons.
The compounds used to carry electrons include pheophytin (chlorophyll 
without the magnesium ion (Mg2+) center), quinones, cytochromes, plastocy-
anins (copper-containing proteins), nonheme iron sulfur proteins, ferredoxin, 
and flavoproteins (covered in detail in Chapter 5).
There are two main types of photosynthesis: oxygenic (the kind that gener-
ates O2) and anoxygenic (the kind that doesn’t generate O2). Anoxygenic 
photosynthesis is used mainly by the purple bacteria, the green sulfur and 
nonsulfur bacteria, the heliobacteria and the acidobacteria. Oxygenic photo-
synthesis is used by the cyanobacteria, the algae, and by plants.
Oxygenic photosynthesis
Oxygenic photosynthesis occurs in, among others, eukaryotic microorgan-
isms like algae and in bacteria such as cyanobacteria; the same mechanism is 
at work in both. Electron flow happens through two different electron trans-
port chains that are connected; together, these electron transport chains are 
called the Z scheme (see Figure 9-5). The stars of each chain are photosystem 
I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), each containing chlorophyll reaction cen-
ters surrounded by antenna pigments.
Structures of photosynthetic pigments
If you squint at the structure of some of the 
photoactive pigments discussed in this chap-
ter, you’ll see that they all have a few things in 
common: chains of carbons arranged into rings, 
a lot of double bonds, and side chains (refer to 
the following figure). The thing about double 
bonds and rings is that they’re great at sharing 
electrons with each other so all the electrons 
along the structure of the molecule form a 
kind of cloud of electronegativity. When such 
a molecule absorbs a packet of light energy 
(called a photon), the electron cloud becomes 
excited, causing one electron to be transferred 
to another molecule rather easily.

132
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
	
Figure 9-5: 
The Z 
scheme.
	
	
Don’t let the names fool you, the flow of energy is from PSII to PSI.
The chlorophyll in PSI is called P700, and the chlorophyll in PSII is called 
P680, for the wavelengths of light each absorbs most efficiently. The steps 
involved are illustrated in Figure 9-5 and summarized here.
	
1.	 Light energy (a photon of light) is absorbed by PSII, exciting P680 and 
making it into a good electron donor that reduces the first member of 
the electron transport chain, pheophytin.
	
	 PSII is normally very electropositive and it would just remain reduced 
unless excited by light.

133
 Chapter 9: Harnessing Energy, Fixing Carbon
	
2.	 Water is split to generate electrons used to reduce P680 back to its rest-
ing state. The protons (H+) from water act to create the proton motive 
force, whereas the oxygen is released (giving the pathway its name).
	
3.	 The electrons travel through several electron carriers until eventually 
reducing P700 in PSI. P700 is already oxidized after having absorbed 
light and donated an electron to the next electron transport chain.
	
4.	 After passing through a series of electron carriers, the last step in the 
process is the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH.
Aside from the production of NADPH, electron transport functions to create 
the proton motive force, which is used by ATP synthase to generate ATP.
	
Because electrons don’t cycle back to reduce the original electron donor, 
this pathway is called noncyclic photophosphorylation. If things are ideal and 
enough reducing power (extra electrons) is available, some of the electrons do 
travel back to reduce P700 and in the process add to the proton motive force 
that generates ATP (or phosphorylation). When this happens, it’s called cyclic 
photophosphorylation.
The cool thing about microbes is how resistant they are to extenuating condi-
tions. For example, when PSII is blocked, some oxygenic phototrophs can use 
cyclic photophosphorylation with PSI alone in a similar way to how anoxy-
genic phototrophs do it. Instead of oxidizing water, they use either H2S or H2 
as the electron donor to provide the reducing power (the electrons) for CO2 
fixation.
Anoxygenic photosynthesis
Many of the steps in anoxygenic photosynthesis are the same as those for 
oxygenic photosynthesis (see the preceding section). For example, light 
excites the photosynthetic pigments, causing them to donate electrons to the 
electron transport chain and ATP is again generated from the proton motive 
force created by electron transport (see Figure 9-6).
Here are the main ways that anoxygenic photosynthesis differs from oxygenic 
photosynthesis:
	
✓	Oxygen is not released because P680 of PSII is not present. Water is too 
electropositive to act as the electron donor for the photosystem.
	
✓	Depending on the species, the reaction center can consist of chlorophyll, 
bacteriochlorophyll, or other similar pigments. The reaction center in 
purple bacteria is called P870.
	
✓	Some of the carriers within the electron chain are different, including 
bacteriopheophytin, which is bacteriochlorophyll without its Mg2+ ion.

134
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
	
✓	Electrons cycle back to reduce P870, so this is a cyclic electron transport 
chain leading to generation of ATP through cyclic photophosphorylation.
	
✓	Unlike in oxygenic photosynthesis, where NADPH is the terminal elec-
tron acceptor, no NADPH is made because electrons are cycling back 
into the system.

135
 Chapter 9: Harnessing Energy, Fixing Carbon
Without NADPH, cells have to come up with another way of generating the 
reducing power necessary to drive the Calvin cycle for carbon fixation. This 
is accomplished through oxidization of things like inorganic compounds. The 
electrons donated are added to either the quinone pool (purple bacteria) or 
donated to iron-sulfur proteins (the green sulfur and nonsulfur bacteria, and 
the heliobacteria).
When the electron acceptor is not sufficiently electronegative (as in the 
case of quinone), then reverse electron flow is needed to get the necessary 
reducing power. Reverse electron flow uses the proton motive force to push 
electrons to reduce NADP+. This mechanism is used frequently in other situ-
ations, where several turns of the electron transport cycle are necessary to 
generate enough power to reduce one molecule of NAD+ or NADP+.
	
In some phototrophs, both ATP and reducing power (that is electron donors 
like NADH or NADPH) are produced from the light reactions, whereas in others 
(like the purple bacteria) the light reaction producing ATP but reducing power 
has to be obtained in separate reactions (like oxidizing inorganic compounds).
Getting Energy from the Elements: 
Chemolithotrophy
Chemolithotrophy is the use of inorganic compounds for energy. Most chemo-
lithotrophs are autotrophs (reduce CO2 to make cellular material), but some 
are mixotrophs, meaning that they use inorganic chemicals for energy and 
organic compounds as carbon sources. In a nutshell, inorganic compounds 
are oxidized so that NAD+ can be reduced, and reverse electron transport 
is used only if the source of electrons is more electropositive (has a higher 
affinity for electrons) than NADH.
Inorganic substances used for chemolithotrophy include but are not limited to
	
✓	Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and elemental sulfur (S0) from volcanoes
	
✓	Ammonia (NH3), nitrate (NO2
–) and ferrous iron (Fe2+) from mining, fossil 
fuels, agriculture, and industrial waste.
	
✓	Hydrogen (H2), as well as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, all produced 
by other organisms.
	
Only microorganisms are able to perform these chemolithotrophic reactions, 
which are at the heart of most nutrient cycling in nature.

136
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Harnessing hydrogen
Oxidation of hydrogen (H2) can happen in both the presence and absence of 
oxygen (in oxic and anoxic environments). The main difference in these two 
situations is the terminal electron acceptor used. When oxygen is present, 
it’s the obvious choice because it has a high affinity for electrons and when 
reduced it forms water (H2O). The oxidation of H2 allows ATP to be made by 
the proton motive force. The enzyme involved is hydrogenase and it comes 
in two forms: a membrane-bound form for making ATP and a soluble form for 
reducing NAD+.
The H2 these microbes use is the result of fermentation reactions, which 
occur for the most part anaerobically. This means that there is little H2 in 
oxic environments. Also, the H2 present in anoxic conditions is snapped up 
quickly by anaerobic hydrogen oxidizers, which are plentiful in these envi-
ronments. Because of this, aerobic hydrogen bacteria have adapted to live 
in microaerobic environments. Here the small amount of oxygen inhibits the 
growth of anaerobic bacteria and as H2 is continuously available it floats up 
from the anoxic space below.
Most hydrogen bacteria can also be chemoorganotrophic, meaning that they 
can use organic carbon when it’s available. This ability to obtain carbon in 
an alternate way makes them facultative chemolithotrophs. When glucose is 
present, for instance, they repress CO2 fixation and hydrogenase.
Securing electrons from sulfur
The oxidation of sulfur compounds is performed by the sulfur bacteria. Sources 
of sulfur include hydrogen sulfide (H2S), elemental sulfur (S0), and thiosulfate 
(S2O3
2–); the oxidized form of these is sulfate (SO4
2–). There are two parts to 
complete sulfur oxidation; some microbes perform both, whereas others only 
use one part.
The first part is as follows:
H2S + ½ O2 → S0 + H2O
The S0 is deposited either outside or inside the cell. When stored inside the 
cell, it’s used as an energy reserve. When deposited into the environment, 
S0 forms crystals that are insoluble. Microbes have to attach to the crystals 
directly in order to oxidize it.

137
 Chapter 9: Harnessing Energy, Fixing Carbon
The second part is as follows:
S0 + 1½ O2 + H2O → SO4
2– + 2H+
Bacteria that perform this last stage of the reaction have to be acid tolerant 
because pumping protons (H+) out of the cell lowers the pH of the surround-
ing environment. One of the enzymes used is sulfite oxidase, which transfers 
electrons directly from thiosulfate to cytochrome c. A regular electron trans-
port chain is involved, and ATP is made as a result. Another pathway uses an 
enzyme called adenosine phosphosulfate reductase, which is usually found in 
sulfur-reducing bacteria, but here its action is reversed to oxidize sulfur and 
generate one phosphate bond in ATP (which has three). A third type of reac-
tion uses the sulfur oxidation (or Sox) system, which is made up of more than 
15 gene products. This complex system is used by several chemolithotrophs 
and even some phototrophs that oxidize sulfur in order to reduce CO2, as 
­discussed earlier.
Reduced sulfur compounds donate electrons that travel through the electron 
transport chain to O2. As always, this creates the proton motive force and 
ATP. The electrons for carbon fixation, however, come from reverse electron 
flow (where part of the proton motive force generated is used) in order to 
reduce NAD+ to NADH. When oxygen isn’t present, however, some use nitrate 
as an electron acceptor.
Pumping iron
Aerobic oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+) happens in acidic 
conditions. The reaction creates insoluble iron in water in the form of ferric 
hydroxide or Fe(OH)3 and acidifies the environment further. The bacteria that 
do this get so little energy from the reaction that they have to oxidize massive 
amounts of iron to survive, creating red iron deposits where they live.
In these acidic conditions, Fe2+/Fe3+ is very electropositive so the route to 
reduction of O2 is necessarily very short. Another aspect of this system is 
that the transfer of electrons from the first electron acceptor (cytochrome c) 
to rusticyanin is actually energetically unfavorable. The reaction proceeds, 
­however, because removal of Fe3+ from the system by the formation of Fe(OH)3 
pulls the whole thing forward.
Other bacteria make a living from catching ferrous iron that comes up from 
groundwater. As groundwater flows over iron deposits, it collects ferrous iron 
and keeps it in an anoxic environment. When not in acidic conditions, ferrous 
iron oxidizes spontaneously when it comes into contact with oxygen.

138
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
One of the most ancient forms of iron oxidation happens anaerobically. This 
type of reaction happens at neutral pH and is likely how the large iron depos-
its in the earth’s surface were laid down way before we had an oxygenated 
environment. The way this works is that NO3
– acts as the electron acceptor, 
and the energy is used either for energy (ATP) or for reducing carbon.
Oxidizing nitrate and ammonia
The oxidization of nitrogen compounds is called nitrification. The inorganic 
compounds ammonia (NH3) and nitrite (NO2
–) are oxidized by nitrifying bac-
teria and archaea. Most nitrifiers are also autotrophs, getting their carbon 
from CO2. These types of electron donors are very electropositive and hang 
on to their electrons for dear life. This means that the electron acceptors 
have to be very, very electropositive and only a small amount of energy is 
released. Because of this, the proton motive force is weak and growth rates 
are slow.
There are two steps in nitrification. The first step is being catalyzed by ammo-
nia monoxygenase (AMO) and the second step is being catalyzed by nitrite 
oxidoreductase:
NH3 → NO2
– → NO3
–
Bacteria and archaea are known to have similar AMO genes, yet to date only 
the purple phototrophic bacteria have been found to perform the second 
step. They do this in anoxic conditions and use the energy for reducing 
power in carbon fixation.
Nitrifiers are especially important for the nitrogen cycle. In nature, decompos-
ing organic material releases ammonia (NH3), which when oxidized to NO3
– 
provides an essential nutrient for plant, algae, and cyanobacteria growth.
Anammox
Another fascinating route for ammonia oxidation is through anammox or 
anoxic ammonia oxidation. This reaction is done under strict anaerobic con-
ditions by members of the Planctomycete group of bacteria. These bacteria 
lack the kind of cell wall of other bacteria and have a structure called the 
anammoxosome (see Figure 9-7), which takes up most of the cell. This struc-
ture has an impermeable membrane made of unique lipids and functions 
to stop any diffusion of the products of ammonium oxidation into the cyto-
plasm, which is important since they are toxic. This precaution is necessary 
because an intermediate of the reaction is hydrazine (N2H4), an ingredient in 
rocket fuel. The full reaction sees the oxidization of ammonium (NH4
+) with

nitrite as the electron acceptor. These bacteria are autotrophs, but they don’t 
use the Calvin cycle for CO2 fixation. Instead, they use the strong reducing 
power of hydrazine in the acetyl CoA pathway to fix carbon.

The nitrite for anammox comes from aerobic ammonia oxidizing organisms 
in nitrogen-rich environments like sewage treatment plants and other areas 
where there is wastewater. Here, suspended particles can contain both oxic 
and anoxic areas acting as habitats for both aerobic and anaerobic microbes. 
Because they’re inhibited by O2, anammox can only exist in strictly anoxic 
environments where ammonium and nitrite are both found.

very cell, whether microbial or not, must continuously produce adenos-
ine triphosphate (ATP) to power cellular reactions. ATP, the currency of 
the cell, is a short-term energy-storing molecule and is around for only a few 
seconds to a minute at a time. Organisms that get energy from the organic 
compounds in their environment are called chemoorganotrophs. There are 
two main strategies for extracting energy from organic compounds: respira-
tion and fermentation. In this chapter, we show you how these two strategies 
differ and compare the amount of ATP made from glucose by each. You see 
that respiration is also possible in the absence of oxygen and that most of the 
metabolic diversity in prokaryotes is due to fermentation pathways. We also 
talk about how some organisms can metabolize in more than one way and 
why that can be helpful for survival when conditions change.
Lifestyles of the Rich and Facultative
The presence, or absence, of oxygen can cause profound responses from 
many microorganisms. These can be put into four groups based on their rela-
tionship with molecular oxygen (O2). The term obligate refers to the absolute 
need for something, whereas the term facultative means that they can func-
tion in conditions that are not their preferred conditions.

142
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Aerobes use oxygen in their metabolism as the terminal electron acceptor for 
the electron transport chain in respiration. Different aerobes can grow in a 
range of oxygen concentrations for example:
	
✓	Some microbes, simply called aerobes, grow well at full oxygen levels 
(about 21 percent in air).
	
✓	Microaerophiles prefer to grow in conditions where the concentration 
of oxygen is very low
	
✓	Facultative aerobes either grow either in the presence or the absence 
of oxygen. When oxygen is present these organism use it during respira-
tion and when oxygen isn’t present they use other pathways for their 
metabolism.
Anaerobes don’t use oxygen for their metabolism but instead these type of 
microbes use fermentation or anaerobic respiration. Different anaerobes 
respond differently to oxygen in their environment:
	
✓	Obligate anaerobes are either inhibited or killed by oxygen. They live in 
environments that are devoid of all oxygen, like aquatic sediments or the 
colon of animals.
	
✓	Aerotolerant anaerobes essentially ignore oxygen in their environment 
and can grow well in it’s presence or absence. Because they lack the 
citric acid cycle and/or an electron transport chain, they don’t switch to 
aerobic respiration when oxygen is present.
In addition to the machinery needed to use oxygen in metabolic processes, 
another set of enzymes is needed if a microbe is going to survive in oxic envi-
ronments (environments with oxygen).
Oxygen is one of those molecules that can be converted easily to a high-
energy ion, called a free radical, through a series of steps, usually as part of 
its use as an electron acceptor. Free radicals are a problem because their 
unstable high-energy state can readily cause damage to sensitive molecules 
in the cell like DNA and proteins.
Free radicals from oxygen are a reality that every cell in an aerobic environ-
ment has to live with, so enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, 
and peroxidase have evolved to stop them before they even get started. 
All the groups of microbes listed in this section have a form of one of these 
enzymes, except for obligate anaerobes, which can’t even tolerate oxygen.

143
 Chapter 10: Comparing Respiration and Fermentation
Seeing the Big Picture
Sugars such as glucose, and organic substance in general, are great sources 
of energy and are used by many microorganisms for fuel.
	
Organic substances are those that contain at least two carbons bonded to one 
another; inorganic substances are everything else.
For the most part, the breakdown of an energy source can happen in one of 
two ways: by respiration or by fermentation. But before respiration or fer-
mentation, glucose is first broken down by glycolysis.
Respiration and fermentation are fundamentally different, mostly in the way 
they handle the substrate pyruvate. With exceptions, pyruvate is the product 
of glycolysis that is the main input into both pathways. These two metabolic 
strategies also differ in the products they release and how much total energy 
they can extract in the process. Figure 10-1 provides an overview of the respi-
ration and fermentation processes.

An overview 
of respira-
tion and 
fermentation.
	

144
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
	
Glycolysis, discussed briefly in Chapter 5, is the breakdown of glucose and 
happens by way of three possible pathways. The most common, which is pres-
ent in all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes is the Embden-Meyerhof pathway 
or classic glycolysis. The other two glycolytic pathways are phosphoketolase 
(sometimes called the heterolactic pathway) and the Entner-Doudoroff path-
way. Because it often precedes either respiration or fermentation, classic gly-
colysis is discussed here. The other pathways are discussed in the “Figuring 
Out Fermentation” section, later in this chapter.
The point of glycolysis is to split a six-carbon sugar such as glucose into two 
molecules of pyruvic acid, which has three carbons. The steps are shown in 
Figure 10-2. Although this looks a bit scary, it’s actually fairly straightforward.

145
 Chapter 10: Comparing Respiration and Fermentation
In the first stage of this process, called the preparatory stage, some energy 
has to be put in to get the molecules ready. Two ATPs are used during this 
preparatory stage, each donating one phosphate (Pi) that will be attached to 
the intermediate products. At the end of the prep stage, the six carbon sugar 
fructose-1,6-diphosphate is cleaved into two molecules of glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate (G3P) with three carbons each that go on to the energy conserva-
tion stage.
	
Technically, in the first stage of glycolysis, one molecule of G3P and one mole-
cule of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) are produced, but because DHAP 
is easily converted to G3P and used in the next stage of glycolysis, we can say 
that two G3P were made.
	
Following the number of carbons in each step helps when trying to account 
for all the products of glycolysis and respiration. It’s only when we get to fer-
mentation that you want to pay more attention to the other atoms bonded to 
the sugar because the products of fermentation still have energy in them and 
also have important properties.
In the second stage of glycolysis, the energy conservation stage, the cofactor 
NAD+ is reduced to NADH and ATP is formed along with pyruvic acid, which 
can then be used for either fermentation or respiration. Here’s how this hap-
pens: Each molecule of G3P is first oxidized when it donates two protons 
to two molecules of NAD+ to form two molecules of NADH. Next, another 
Pi is added to it so that it now has two phosphate bonds. One of these Pi is 
transferred to ADP to form ATP. Next, a rearrangement happens: A water mol-
ecule (H2O) is lost and a second ATP is formed by the transfer of the last Pi 
to ATP from the three-carbon intermediate phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP). 
What’s left after this step is pyruvic acid, a three-carbon molecule with no 
phosphates.
So, glycolysis breaks glucose into two molecules of pyruvic acid and pro-
duces a net amount of two ATP molecules and two NADH molecules. This 
may seem off, but remember that two ATP and one NADH were produced for 
each molecule of G3P, of which there were two. The net amount of ATP and 
NADH made in glycolysis is as follows:
–2 ATP (put in at the beginning)
+4 ATP and 2 NADH produced
2 ATP and 2 NADH net

146
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
The ATP is used to power cellular processes that require energy. NADH is 
considered a store of reducing power (a cofactor used in redox reactions) 
that can either go into the electron transport chain in respiration or be used 
to reduce pyruvate in fermentation. Both of these scenarios are discussed 
in this chapter.
Digging into Respiration
Compared to fermentation, respiration is a very efficient, but slow way of get-
ting energy from glucose. It requires pyruvic acid, a terminal electron ­acceptor, 
and an electron transport chain, and it generates ATP, NADH and FADH2 
(another cofactor used in redox reactions). When oxygen is present, it acts as 
the terminal electron acceptor and is reduced to water; in anoxic conditions, 
where no oxygen is present, another inorganic or sometimes organic compound 
is reduced.
Respiration, whether aerobic or anaerobic, involves the citric acid (TCA) 
cycle and an electron transport chain. Unlike the citric acid cycle, which 
uses the same enzymes in almost all organisms, the electron transport chain 
employs slightly different electron carriers in different microbes. Despite 
these details, the end result is the same for all electron transport chains: 
Energy is released and used to create the proton motive force across a mem-
brane, which in turn is used to make ATP.
So, now that we have pyruvic acid made from glucose through glycolysis, we 
can go straight to talking about the citric acid cycle, right? Not so fast. First, 
each pyruvic acid has to be oxidized to form acetyl-CoA (a two-carbon mole-
cule), during which NAD+ is reduced to NADH and CO2 is released. Acetyl-CoA 
then enters the citric acid cycle where more ATP is made and reducing power 
is stored in cofactors.
Spinning the citric acid cycle
Imagine the citric acid cycle, also called the Krebs cycle, as a merry-go-round 
with kids jumping on and off as it turns. Acetyl-CoA, NAD+, and FAD are the 
kids jumping on, and CO2, NADH, FADH2, and ATP are the kids jumping off.

147
 Chapter 10: Comparing Respiration and Fermentation
	
Figure 10-3 shows the citric acid cycle. The important steps are that acetyl-
CoA first combines with oxaloacetic acid. Then, through a series of steps, it’s 
converted to succinyl-CoA that is used to make ATP by substrate-level phos-
phorylation, leaving succinate that is then returned to oxaloacetate so that it 
can combine with another acetyl-CoA.
	
Figure 10-3: 
The citric 
acid cycle.
	
	
ATP can also be made without the use of the electron transport chain using 
a process called substrate-level phosphorylation, that involves converting an 
organic compound from one form to another. During the conversion enough 
energy is released to make one molecule of ATP. Figure 10-4 gives examples 
of substrate-level phosphorylation and how they generate ATP without the 
enzyme ATP synthase. In the “Figuring Out Fermentation” section of the 
­chapter, this way of generating ATP will be very common.

148
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
	
Figure 10-4: 
Examples of 
substrate-
level phos-
phorylation.
	
For every turn of the wheel, one ATP, three molecules of NADH, and one mol-
ecule of FADH2 are made and two molecules of CO2 are released as waste.
	
The citric acid cycle makes one turn for every molecule of pyruvate. Because 
glucose yields two molecules of pyruvate, the cycle turns twice for each glu-
cose, producing twice the products.
Starting with glycolysis, the net result is 2 pyruvic acid, 2 NADH, and 2 ATP. 
Then for every molecule of pyruvate the cell gets 4 NADH, 1 FADH2, and 
1 ATP. But because two pyruvates are formed from glucose, this equals 8 
NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP.
Stepping down the electron 
transport chain
At last we arrive at the part of respiration that uses oxygen. This is because, in 
essence, the electron transport chain is like a staircase where each step is an 
electron carrier (see a description of electron carriers in Chapter 5) and each 
step down has more reducing potential. At the top, electrons are added by 
NADH or FADH2 and then travel downward until finally being donated, along 

149
 Chapter 10: Comparing Respiration and Fermentation
with protons, to a terminal electron acceptor. The best electron acceptor we 
know of is O2, so in the presence of oxygen it’s reduced to water (H2O). When 
it’s absent, however, another compound is substituted (see the next section).
An example of the electron transport chain is shown in Figure 10-5.
	
Figure 10-5: 
The electron 
transport 
chain.
	
When electrons go from a higher energy state (top of the stairs) to a lower 
energy state (bottom of the stairs), the energy they carry can be used to 
power enzymes. In this case, the enzymes are embedded in a membrane and 
use the energy gained to pump protons (H+) across the membrane. As more 
H+ accumulate on the outside of the membrane, a difference in charge and pH 
between the inside and the outside of the cell builds up. Because of the differ-
ence in acidity and electrical charge across the membrane (called the proton 
motive force), protons naturally want to re-enter the cytoplasm and do so 
through the enzyme ATP synthase, which is embedded in the membrane, in 
the process powering the formation of ATP from ADP.
	
The exact order and kind of electron carriers in the electron transport chain 
vary among microorganisms, but the overall result is the same: Electrons 
release energy that is used to move protons across a membrane, creating a dif-
ference in charge and pH.

150
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Respiring anaerobically
Microbes that have an electron transport chain can still use it even if oxygen 
isn’t present. For this they use other inorganic compounds as the terminal 
electron acceptor. Examples of this include nitrate (NO3
–), sulfate (SO4
2–), and 
carbonate (CO3
2–) among others. Reduction of these compounds by micro-
organisms is actually very important for the natural cycle of nitrogen, sulfur, 
and carbon in the environment. Some organisms are able to respire both 
aerobically and anaerobically, whereas others are only able to do one or the 
other. Besides the three main substrates used as terminal electron acceptors 
(nitrogen-, sulfur-, and carbon-containing compounds) other compounds 
used include ferric iron, manganese, and inorganic and organic compounds.
	
Microbes can use inorganic substances in two different ways. When inorganic 
substances are incorporated into cellular material (for example, amino acids), 
the process is called assimilative metabolism. When inorganic substances are 
used as sources of energy, it is called dissimilative metabolism. There’s a big 
difference between these two types of metabolism: Dissimilative uses large 
quantities of the substrate to gather the energy needed, whereas only the 
amount of each compound needed for biosynthesis is used in assimilative 
metabolism. The other major difference is where many organisms use inor-
ganic substrates assimilatively only a small number of specialist microbes use 
dissimilative metabolisms of inorganic substances.
Nitrate and denitrification
Nitrate (NO3
–) is a very common terminal electron acceptor. When it’s com-
pletely reduced, it forms nitrogen gas (N2). The process of reducing nitrogen 
compound to nitrogen gas is called denitrification. Nitrogen gas makes up 
about 78 percent of air and is completely unavailable to plants and animals as 
a nitrogen source.
The nitrogen gas can be recaptured by microorganisms and returned into 
a form that is available to plants in a process called nitrogen fixation (see 
Chapter 11). Denitrification is important for removing fixed nitrogen from 
processes like sewage treatment so that the water released at the end isn’t 
full of nitrates because these nitrates cause algae to grow, fouling up rivers 
and streams.
There are several steps involved in complete denitrification (see Figure 10-6), 
but not all microbes go all the way. Some only convert nitrate to nitrite. Each 
step uses a different enzyme, but the result is the reduction of each com-
pound during steps in the electron transport chain.

151
 Chapter 10: Comparing Respiration and Fermentation
	
Figure 10-6: 
The steps in 
denitrifica-
tion.
	
Sulfate and sulfur reduction
Sulfate (SO4
2–) is an inorganic sulfur-containing ion that is common in the ocean. 
Because it’s the most oxidized form of sulfur, bacteria such as Desulfovibrio use 
it as the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, reducing it 
to sulfite (SO3
2–) and eventually hydrogen sulfide (H2S) anaerobically:
SO4
2– → SO3
2– → H2S
Although many plants and microbes can use sulfate for biosynthesis of 
sulfur-containing molecules in assimilative sulfate reduction, only the sulfate-
reducing bacteria can use it for energy with dissimlative sulfate reduction. 
The hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced is a gas with a distinctive rotten egg 
smell, that can be used by sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms or can react with 
metals forming metal sulfides such as cadmium yellow (CdS), used as a paint 
pigment, or iron pyrite (FeS2), commonly known as fool’s gold.
Sulfur-reducing bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide from elemental sulfur (S0) 
in the following way:
S0 + 2 H → H2S
The sulfate-reducing bacteria are fairly well studied, whereas the sulfur-
reducing bacteria are less well understood.

152
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Acetogenesis and methanogenesis
Another group of organisms that use anaerobic respiration for energy conser-
vation are the acetogens and the methanogens.
These organisms reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and, as their names suggest, 
form acetate (CH3COO–) and methane (CH4). They have one major thing in 
common: their use of the acetyl-CoA pathway to reduce CO2. Unlike the auto-
trophs in Chapter 9, strict anaerobes like these don’t use the Calvin cycle, the 
reverse citric acid cycle, or the hydroxypropionate cycle. Instead, they pro-
duce acetyl-CoA from two molecules of CO2.
Acetogens are interesting because they both produce ATP from an electron 
transport chain, with CO2 as the terminal electron acceptor, and use acetate 
to form more ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation. Although both 
bacteria and archaea are known to produce acetate, all known methanogens 
are archaea. Methanogens are abundant in the cow rumen (first part of the 
cow’s stomach important for digesting cellulose) even in the human intes-
tine, producing large amounts of methane, a smelly gas that is released as, 
well, you can guess.
Oxidizing hydrocarbons and other compounds
Hydrocarbons are molecules containing only carbon and hydrogen. They’re 
chains made up of carbons, and they can be pretty much any length, but the 
longer the chains, the more insoluble they are in water and the less available 
they are for microbial breakdown. Hydrocarbons occur mainly in crude oil 
where the abundance of carbon from the decomposition of plant material has 
been bonded into chains and covered with hydrogen atoms.
In both the presence and absence of oxygen, hydrocarbons can be oxidized 
for energy by microorganisms. Anaerobically, it’s the denitrifying and the 
sulfate-reducing bacteria that are responsible for the breakdown of hydro-
carbons, using the hydrocarbon as the electron donor and reducing either 
NO3
– or SO4
2– at the end of the electron transport chain. Many microbes can 
degrade hydrocarbons aerobically; the process is much quicker than it is 
anaerobically. In both pathways, long chains are broken into shorter chains, 
which are then oxidized to CO2.
Compounds other than glucose are broken down through respiration or 
fermentation and many of the pathways used are essentially the same (see 
Figure 10-7).

Figuring Out Fermentation
Both respiration and fermentation are ways of generating ATP, the energy cur-
rency of the cell, but they’re very different. In fermentation, ATP is produced 
directly from the products of glycolysis, so the amount of ATP produced is 
much lower. But fermentation is much faster than respiration and is a clever 
way to extract energy from a variety of substances in the absence of oxygen, 
although it can still happen when oxygen is present. One important function 
of fermentation is to oxidize NADH back to NAD+ so that it can be used again 
in glycolysis. This happens during the reduction of pyruvic acid into fermen-
tation products.

154
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
	
Fermentation doesn’t use the citric acid cycle or an electron transport chain to 
produce ATP. In fact, little to no ATP is made from the fermentation reactions 
that follow glycolysis. Instead, fermentation reactions are used to regenerate 
NAD+ and to balance the redox reactions. ATP is made through substrate-level 
phosphorylation, so fermentation doesn’t require the use of a membrane.
Because fermenting microorganisms lack an electron transport chain, they’re 
unable to completely oxidize organic compounds and the final products still 
contain energy. This is the unavoidable result of having to balance redox 
reactions. The products of fermentation are different depending on both the 
enzymes present and the type of microorganism, but they include things 
like lactic acid, ethanol, CO2, H2, and many others, but in all cases they are 
considered waste by the microorganism and are excreted into the media. 
Because of their fermentative properties, some of these microbes are used to 
make wine, cheese, yogurt, cured meats, and in industrial processes to manu-
facture solvents and other useful things.
The types of fermentation are named mainly for the products that are made. 
Embden-Meyerhof fermentations (those beginning with classic glycolysis) all 
begin with glucose and lead to a myriad of fermentation products, including 
the following:
	
✓	Homolactic fermentation produces lactic acid only. Examples of homo-
lactic fermentative bacteria include members of the genera Streptococcus, 
Lactobacillus, and Bacillus.
	
✓	Mixed acid fermentation produces lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, 
succinate, and ethanol and sometimes CO2 and/or H2. Examples of 
mixed acid fermenters include bacteria from the genera Escherichia and 
Salmonella.
	
✓	Butanediol fermentation can make the same products as mixed acid fer-
mentation as well as 2,3 butanediol. Bacteria from the genus Enterobacter 
ferment in this way.
	
✓	Butyric acid fermentation is performed by Clostridia bacteria and pro-
duces butyric acid, CO2, and H2, as well as ethanol and isopropanol.
	
✓	Butanol-acetone fermentation is also done by a species of Clostridium 
and produces acetone, which was used to make gunpowder during 
World War I.
	
✓	Propionic acid fermentation produces acetic acid, CO2, and propionic 
acid from lactic acid (this is called secondary fermentation, meaning the 
fermentation of a fermented product) and is especially useful for making 
Swiss cheese. The propionic acid gives the cheese its flavor, and the CO2 
makes the distinctive holes. Species of Propionibacterium are used for 
this type of fermentation process.

155
 Chapter 10: Comparing Respiration and Fermentation
The phosphoketolase pathway is used during a type of fermentation that pro-
duces lactic acid along with ethanol and CO2 called heterolactic fermentation 
or heterofermentation because more than one product is made. This pathway 
breaks down glucose in a different way than the classic glycolytic pathway 
and produces about half the amount of energy (see Figure 10-8).
	
Figure 10-8: 
The phos-
phoketolase 
pathway of 
heterofer-
menters.
	
As in classic glycolysis, in the phosphoketolase pathway the six-carbon glu-
cose molecule is split into a three-carbon molecule of pyruvic acid, which 
goes on to be reduced to lactate. But instead of a second molecule of pyruvic 
acid, the other three carbons are split between CO2, which is released, and 

156

acetyl phosphate, which gets converted to ethanol. Microorganisms that use 
this pathway, like Lactobacillus, are best known for being helpful in making 
sauerkraut and a type of yogurt called kefir.
The Entner-Doudoroff pathway is another type of glycolysis that produces less 
energy than classic glycolysis (see Figure 10-9).
	
Figure 10-9: 
The Entner-
Doudoroff 
pathway

formation.
	
The microorganisms that use this type of fermentation alone are few and 
come from a group of Zymomonas bacteria that are involved in the produc-
tion of tequila and mescal. For many other microbes, however, this pathway 
is used to break down glucose that feeds into respiration.

iving organisms don’t exist in isolation, every one is surrounded by a 
living and nonliving environment with which it interacts.
Before talking about the many habitats where microorganisms are found, we 
want to fill you in on some terminology for describing microbes in an ecosys-
tem, as well as the factors that influence the individuals within a habitat:
	
✓	Colonization: The growth of microorganisms either on a surface or 
within something.
	
✓	Population: An accumulation of the several members of the same spe-
cies. For microorganisms, especially prokaryotes, a population often 
arises from one individual cell.
	
✓	Community of microorganisms: Formed by many populations existing 
together; can form on a very small physical scale.
	
✓	Guilds: Populations of microorganisms in a community that use similar 
kinds of metabolism to exploit the same resource. An example of this is 
the use of sunlight by populations of different phototrophic bacteria.
	
✓	Niche: The environment shared by a guild of microbes that provides 
what they need to grow.
	
✓	Habitat: A general environment where populations of microorganisms 
live. Habitats often have several niches occupied by different guilds 
using different resources. As an example, a pond is a habitat with more 
than one niche for microorganisms; the photic zone where light can pen-
etrate and the sediment where it’s dark.

158
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
	
✓	Ecosystem: All the interconnected parts of an environment, living and 
nonliving. This includes all the plants, animals, microbes, rocks, soil, and 
water that affect one another and cycle nutrients. Ecosystems are com-
posed of many different habitats, some of which contain all kinds of life, 
and others of which, like deep inside rocks, contain only microbes.
In this chapter, we describe the many types of microbial habitats and explain 
how microorganisms get what they need to survive in each one. We also 
cover the lifestyle strategies used by microbes to survive and thrive in differ-
ent habitats.
Defining a Habitat
A habitat has a set of chemical and biotic features that define it. These include 
water, oxygen, pH, and temperature (all of which are covered in Chapter 4), as 
well as the following:
	
✓	Energy inputs: Energy inputs include light, organic carbon, and reduced 
inorganic compounds.
	
✓	Resources: Resources include nutrients containing carbon, nitrogen, 
sulfur, phosphorous, iron, and many other micronutrients. Two impor-
tant resources are electron donors and electron acceptors, which are 
essential for energy harvesting by all cells (see Chapter 5).
	
✓	Activities: Activities include primary production of organic compounds 
by autotrophs, the consumption of these organic products by hetero-
trophs, and the conversion of both inorganic and organic compounds 
in the environment by chemotrophs (see Chapters 9 and 10 that go over 
this in detail).
A habitat can be stratified in terms of temperature, oxygen, nutrients, and 
sunlight, and these stratifications make up different niches to which a spe-
cific microorganism, or group of microorganisms, can be uniquely suited (see 
Figure 11-1).
For microorganisms, these habitats can be on very small size scales. For 
instance, a particle of soil (refer to Figure 11-1) can have several different gra-
dients of chemical conditions that define different niches.

Understanding Nutrient Cycles
Because the earth is a closed system, nothing is ever lost — it only changes 
form. Nutrients cycle between environments changing from oxidized to 
reduced and from simple molecules to complex molecules. The main ele-
ments that make up all of the major nutrients are carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, 
phosphorous, and sulfur. These processes are called biogeochemical pro-
cesses because cycles are affected not only by biological processes but also 
by geological and chemical ones.
Despite their small size, microorganisms have a large impact on biogeochemi-
cal processes. As long ago as the 19th century, bacteria were suspected 
of recycling elements between environments and today we know just how 
extensive their roles are.
For every biogeochemical cycle, there are reservoirs where compounds are 
stored and active processes that transform and move compounds around.
Carbon cycling
Organic compounds are carbon-containing compounds that make up all the 
cellular life on earth. These include carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Carbon 
dioxide (CO2) is not an organic carbon source because it doesn’t have any 
carbon-carbon bonds (see Figure 11-2).

Figure 11-2: 
Organic 
versus 
inorganic 
carbon 
compounds.
	
Taking the inorganic carbon in the environment and making organic com-
pounds is the job of the autotrophs that are also called primary producers.
	
All cells need a carbon source. Autotrophs use inorganic carbon in the form of 
CO2. Autotrophs incorporate the CO2 into organic molecules; heterotrophs use 
this organic carbon directly. Also, remember that cells need a carbon source 
and an energy source. Heterotrophs use organic molecules for both — energy 
from the bonds between atoms and the carbon within the molecules — whereas 
autotrophs have a separate energy source (like light or oxidation of another 
molecule) and CO2 for their carbon needs.
The main autotrophs responsible for carbon fixation on earth are plants and 
photosynthetic microorganisms like algae, cyanobacteria, and other types of 
phytoplankton. Other nonphotosynthetic microbes fix carbon and contribute 
a bit more to the global organic material.
Heterotrophs, including animals and microbes, consume the organic carbon 
and either release CO2 as waste or hold onto the organic carbon until they 
die. Decomposition of dead organisms by microorganisms breaks down the 
organic matter into CO2 and methane (CH4), but complete breakdown can 
take decades for some of the more resistant compounds. CH4 can be con-
verted back to CO2 by methanotrophs, and the cycle is complete. The com-
plete carbon cycle is illustrated in Figure 11-3.
The main processes of carbon utilization on earth are from heterotrophic 
microbes that either consume it through respiration (both aerobically and 
anaerobically) or fermentation. Ocean and land animals also consume a small 
amount of the organic matter produced.

161
 Chapter 11: Uncovering a Variety of Habitats
Figure 11-3: 
The carbon 
cycle.
Within the carbon cycle, there is also a side loop for CH4, which is produced 
by methanogenic (methane-producing) microorganisms called methano-
gens. These microbes are found in the sediments of the ocean and belong 
exclusively to the Archaea. Methanogens can only use a small number of 
carbon compounds to make CH4, CO2, and acetate. To make CH4 from organic 
matter, they need help from the syntrophs (see the sidebar on syntrophs in 
Chapter 5 for a description of these interesting bacteria).
Major processes include
	
✓	Carbon fixation by autotrophs: CO2 → organic carbon
	
✓	Respiration and fermentation: Organic carbon → CO2
	
✓	Methanogenesis: Organic carbon or CO2 → CH4
	
✓	Methanotrophy: CH4 → CO2
Major reservoirs of carbon include, in order of highest percent to lowest per-
cent of carbon on earth, the following:
	
✓	Rocks: Contain carbon in the form of limestone. Nearly 99.5 percent of 
the carbon on earth is contained in the rocks in the earth’s crust.
	
✓	Oceans: Contain the highest amount of CO2, stored as carbonic acid. 
Absorbing more CO2 from the atmosphere as the levels of CO2 rise.
	
✓	Methane hydrates: Trapped molecules of CH4, made by microbes, frozen 
deep in ocean sediments. CH4 leaks out at different rates, depending on 
the temperatures in the sea.

162
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
	
✓	Fossil fuels: Deposits of plant material that have been converted to 
hydrocarbons over many millions of years.
	
✓	Organisms: Carry a significant amount of organic carbon around with 
them, which they release back into the environment when they die.
Both CO2 and CH4 are greenhouse gases (they can adsorb and emit infrared 
radiation) and although we hear most often about anthropogenic greenhouse 
gases (generated by human activity), movement of CO2 and CH4 in and out 
of some of these geochemical reservoirs have a major impact on global 
temperatures.
Nitrogen cycling
In addition to carbon, cells also need nitrogen to build things like proteins 
and nucleic acids. But unlike carbon, where the different forms are more com-
plex organic molecules, the nitrogen cycle involves only different oxidation 
states of nitrogen.
Nitrogen in the atmosphere is very plentiful, making up 79 percent of the 
air, but it’s in a form that most cells can’t use: nitrogen gas (N2). Microbial 
processes are essential for converting N2 into ammonia (NH3), called nitrogen 
fixation. Aside from fixing it from the air, nitrogen is available from decompos-
ing organic matter. When something dies, microorganisms break down the 
proteins into amino acids and then into ammonia. Together these processes 
make up the nitrogen cycle, an overview of which is shown in Figure 11-4. As 
with carbon, there are nitrogen sources and reservoirs between which differ-
ent processes act to cycle around nitrogen-containing molecules:
	
Figure 11-4: 
The nitrogen 
cycle.
	

163
 Chapter 11: Uncovering a Variety of Habitats
	
✓	Ammonification: Organic N to NH4
+. The breakdown of proteins and 
nucleic acids to ammonium. Performed by many microorganisms. When 
ammonia is used to make amino acids and nucleic acids, it’s called 
assimilation.
	
✓	Denitrification: NO3
– to N2. Happens under anaerobic conditions. It’s 
detrimental when denitrification happens in waterlogged fields because 
it causes fixed nitrogen to escape as N2. It’s good when denitrification 
happens in sewage treatment because it lowers the amount of fixed 
nitrogen in treated water that ends up in lakes and rivers.
	
✓	Nitrification: NH4
+ to NO2
– then NO2
– to NO3
–. Each reaction is catalyzed 
by different bacteria that live together in neutral soils that are well 
drained, because flooded soils become anoxic quickly. This happens 
extensively in soils, especially after fertilizer (natural or chemical) is 
added. Because NO3
– is very soluble, it will wash away quickly or suc-
cumb to denitrification if the soil becomes flooded.
	
✓	Anammox: NO2
– and NH4
+ to N2. Only a small number of strict anaer-
obes can do this. Happens extensively in marine sediments and sewage 
treatment.
	
✓	Nitrogen fixation: N2 to NH3. Very few microbes can fix nitrogen, so they 
don’t contribute greatly to the total amount of fixed nitrogen in general, 
but because fixed nitrogen is often in limited supply when nitrogen fixers 
are present, they really give plants a boost. Because nitrogen fixation is 
so expensive metabolically, it can only happen when a lot of energy is 
available.
	
	There are two categories of nitrogen-fixing bacteria — those that live 
inside of plant tissues (called symbiotic) and those that don’t (called 
free-living):
	
•	Free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria include Azotobacter, Cyano­
bacteria, and Clostridium.
	
•	Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria include Rhizobia, Cyanobacteria, 
and Frankia, all discussed next.
	
	One enzyme is responsible for nitrogen fixation: nitrogenase. This bacte-
rial enzyme is very sensitive to inactivation by oxygen, so you’d think 
that the bacteria making it would stick to anaerobic environments, but 
instead many have come up with elaborate strategies to keep oxygen 
away from nitrogenase:
	
•	Frankia, a filamentous member of the Actinomycete bacteria, make 
swellings that have thick cell walls and reduce diffusion of oxygen 
(O2) into the cell.
	
•	Cyanobacteria use heterocysts.

164
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
	
•	Rhizobia live in nodules and produce an oxygen-binding protein 
called leghemoglobin that keeps free O2 levels low.
	
•	Others have high rates of oxygen consumption so that there is 
never a large concentration within the cell.
	
From most oxidized and negatively charged to most reduced and positively 
charged, the nitrogen compounds discussed in this section are: nitrate (NO3
–), 
nitrite (NO2
–), nitrogen gas (N2), ammonia (NH3), and ammonium (NH4
+). NH3 
is a gas and spontaneously converts to NH4
+ in water when the pH is neutral 
where it’s soluble.
Sulfur cycling
The sulfur cycle is about the different oxidation states of sulfur — there are 
many more states than there are for nitrogen. The ocean is a major reservoir 
of sulfate (SO4
2–). The major volatile gas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the most 
reduced form of sulfur and is used by many bacteria that oxidize it either to 
elemental sulfur (S0) or to sulfate. Some bacteria even store S0 in their cells as 
a source of electrons for later (see Chapter 10).
Sulfate-reducing bacteria are abundant and widespread. They reduce sulfate 
when organic carbon is present. The sulfide produced from sulfate reduction, 
combines with iron to form insoluble black deposits of iron sulfide minerals 
(FeS and FeS2). S0 can be oxidized by Thiobacillus, producing sulfuric acid 
(H2SO4) and causing acidification of the environment at the same time. S0 can 
also be reduced to sulfide by hyperthermophilic archaea.
Phosphorous cycles in the ocean
Unlike nitrogen and sulfur cycles where the elements change oxidation 
states, the phosphorous cycle follows the change in solubility (in the nearby 
sidebar you’ll see that the calcium cycle is affected by pH). More soluble 
phosphorous is more available to plants, and vice versa. These elements also 
cycle due to the activities of microorganisms, but unlike the other cycles, 
there are no volatile forms that can escape. As with the other nutrient cycles, 
keeping things in balance is very important to ocean and terrestrial life.

165
 Chapter 11: Uncovering a Variety of Habitats
Microbes Socializing in Communities
Microbes living together in communities interact with one another in posi-
tive, negative, and neutral ways. They compete with the other members 
of their guild for resources, and they compete with everyone for space. 
Microbes also cooperate with each other to use resources most efficiently. 
They orchestrate these interactions by communicating with members of their 
own species and with other species through chemical signaling molecules. 
When coordinated, microbial cells can produce structures called biofilms 
within which they’re protected from outside stresses.
Using quorum sensing to communicate
Quorum sensing is the process in which regulatory pathways within the cells 
of a population of bacteria are controlled by the density of cells of their own 
kind. As the name implies, if a sufficient numbers of cells (a quorum) are pres-
ent, they can do something that requires more than one cell to accomplish. 
Quorum sensing controls biofilm formation and toxin production, among 
many other things, some of which are not fully understood.
Cells produce a signal molecule called an autoinducer that is sensed by other 
cells in the vicinity. When enough cells produce the autoinducer, the concen-
trations become high enough within cells to trigger gene expression. Some 
autoinducers are specific for the same species of bacteria, whereas others 
can signal across species. Gram-negative bacteria make acyl homoserine lac-
tones (AHL) and autoinducer 2 (AI-2) molecules; Gram-positive bacteria use 
short peptides as signals.
Happy couples
Microbial processes are important for complet-
ing most cycles and, in the process, coupling 
one nutrient’s cycle with another. The calcium 
cycle in the ocean is tightly coupled with the 
carbon cycle. The levels of CO2 in the air deter-
mine how much will be absorbed by the oceans. 
When absorbed, CO2 becomes carbonic 
acid (H2CO3), decreasing the pH of seawater. 
Organisms that use Ca2+ in their exoskeletons, 
like Foraminfera and corals, need a more basic 
ocean pH; otherwise, the calcium carbonate 
deposits that they make get dissolved. These 
organisms are important food sources for other 
ocean life, and when they die, they’re a major 
part of the cycling of organic matter and Ca2+ 
to deep in the ocean, where anoxic processes 
break down organic compounds very slowly, an 
important part of the carbon cycle.

166
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Living in biofilms
Whenever you have a fluid washing over a surface, like the water over rocks 
in a stream or saliva over the teeth in your mouth, biofilms form. A biofilm is a 
collection of microbes, usually bacteria but also sometimes archaea, within a 
sticky matrix attached to a surface. The bacteria make the substances that bind 
the biofilm together; these substances include polysaccharides, proteins, and 
even DNA. There can be an impressive number of species of microorganisms 
inside of a biofilm, or it can contain only a small number of species. The bacte-
ria aren’t just stuck in the matrix, however; they’re a living, growing community.
From afar, biofilm looks like a film on a surface, but up close a biofilm has 
spaces (as shown in Figure 11-5), which allows liquid to flow through so that 
gases and nutrients can be exchanged.
Figure 11-5: 
A biofilm.
Here are the main reasons bacteria form biofilms:
	
✓	For protection: Biofilms are thought to form in order to protect cells 
from predators, from environmental stresses, and from being mechani-
cally removed from a surface. One important feature of a biofilm is 
that cells within them are resistant to antibiotics, mostly because the 
drugs can’t penetrate the matrix.
	
✓	To keep cells in place: Biofilms are also thought to trap nutrients.
	
✓	For proximity: When cells are close enough together, they can commu-
nicate and exchange genetic material and other molecules.
	
✓	Because it’s the default: Biofilms are likely very common in nature, 
where nutrients are available but sometimes hard to get.

167
 Chapter 11: Uncovering a Variety of Habitats
Within solid parts of a biofilm, oxygen gradients can exist. This is where 
oxygen levels on the surface or near a hole in the biofilm are highest and 
decrease as you move toward the center of a solid area. These areas of low 
oxygen are a perfect place for anaerobic bacteria or archaea to colonize.
Exploring microbial mats
You can think of a microbial mat as an extreme example of a biofilm. They 
started forming 3.5 billion years ago and were the main type of ecosystem for 
a long time. When plants arrived and started competing with mats for light, 
and when predators arrived and started eating the bacteria, the number of 
mats declined. Mats are still found today, mainly in habitats with extreme 
temperatures or high levels of salt.
Microbial mats are many centimeters thick, made of several layers, each with 
different species of bacteria. Microbial processes, as well as physical factors, 
result in each layer having different oxygen concentrations, nutrients, and pH 
conditions. Filamentous cyanobacteria, as well as filamentous chemolithotro-
phic (sulfate-oxidizing) bacteria are common members of microbial mats. 
Because of the dynamics within mats and due to their age, they’re among 
some of the most complex ecosystems, containing the highest number of 
different species known. They’re ecosystems in the true sense of the word 
because they contain primary producers (either cyanobacteria or chemoli-
thotrophs that produce organic carbon compounds from CO2) and consum-
ers (heterotrophs) that cycle all the key nutrients, like carbon and nitrogen.
Controlling biofilms
Bacterial biofilms protect the inhabitants from 
a variety of things, including mechanical dis-
turbance, exposure to toxic substances like 
antibiotics, and predators. They can become 
a problem for humans, however, because they 
tend to clog up pipes and filters, form on medi-
cal equipment and devices, and protect human 
pathogens during an infection.
Because biofilms are resistant to antibiot-
ics and protected from phagocytosis by our 
immune cells, organisms in a biofilm are really 
hard to get rid of. Current research is aimed at 
preventing biofilms from forming, as well as 
biofilm-busting treatments with mechanical 
means and chemicals.

Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Discovering Microbes in Aquatic 
and Terrestrial Habitats
Everything is not everywhere, so although microbes can be found in every 
habitat, species have their preferred habitats, along with some less-than-ideal 
ones that they occupy only occasionally. Most aquatic habitats (saltwater 
and freshwater) and terrestrial habitats contain plants, animals, inverte-
brates, and microbes. This is unlike subsurface habitats, which are entirely 
microbial; life has been found down to nearly 2 miles underground, possibly 
accounting for 40 percent of the earth’s biomass.
Aside from the nutrient cycles, a few other things describe a microbial com-
munity: membership (who is there), diversity (how many different species are 
thriving there together), and biomass (how big the populations are). The fac-
tors that affect these things are nutrient concentrations, mixing, and oxygen 
concentrations.
Thriving in water
The photosynthetic microorganisms are commonly found in both freshwater 
and saltwater habitats. These include algae and cyanobacteria, which either 
float in the water column (planktonic) or attach to surfaces (benthic).
Oxygen levels in freshwater habitats influence the types of communities 
that can live there. The oxygen levels fluctuate depending on the amount of 
primary production. High rates of carbon fixation by primary producers is a 
problem for all aquatic habitats because it can lead to spikes in heterotrophic 
activity that consume all the oxygen. These bursts of oxygen consumption 
affect rivers and oceans as well, but freshwater lakes in summer are particu-
larly vulnerable because they tend to be stratified without much mixing.
The organic material and dead autotrophs from the top layer sink down to 
the bottom of the lake. Because diffusion rates of oxygen into water are low, 
heterotrophs at the bottom quickly use up all the available oxygen when con-
suming the organic matter. This zone lacking oxygen is called the anoxic zone 
and is unsuitable for fish or invertebrate life, but it can be perfect for anaero-
bic microorganisms.
Coastal oceans and the deep sea are two other aquatic habitats for microor-
ganisms. Figure 11-6 shows the different habitats that exist in the ocean.

169
 Chapter 11: Uncovering a Variety of Habitats
The photic zone extends down to 300 meters, where light penetrates the 
water, providing an energy source for a large variety of phototrophic marine 
microorganisms like algae, phytoplankton, and bacteria. Immediately below 
the photic zone, down to 1,000 meters, there is no light but there is still bio-
logical activity. The levels of nutrients here are very low, but there are bacte-
ria and archaea that are adapted to low nutrients and they’re abundant here. 
Below 1,000 meters is the deep sea, where there is far less biological activity 
because of the low temperature, low levels of nutrients, and high pressure, 
which increases with depth. There are some unique microbial habitats in the 
deep sea for bacteria and archaea able to withstand the great pressure, such 
as those near hydrothermal vents and in the sediments.
	
Figure 11-6: 
Ocean 
habitats.
	
Oxygenic versus anoxygenic phototrophs
Both are autotrophs using CO2 as their carbon 
source, but each uses different electron 
donors. Oxygenic phototrophs use water (H2O) 
as an electron donor, whereas anoxygenic 
phototrophs use other reduced molecules like 
H2S and H2). So, although we sometimes think 
of algae and cyanobacteria as using CO2 and 
producing O2, which they do, we should think 
of them as using CO2 and H2O (for different rea-
sons of course) and producing O2.

170
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Swarming soils
Another important microbial habitat is soil. Soil is made of minerals, organic 
matter, water, and microorganisms, with pockets of air mixed in. Soil compo-
sition varies greatly. For instance, dry soil has very little water, compacted 
soil has less air, mineral soil has little organic matter, and organic soil has a 
lot. The smallest unit of soil is the particle, which can have many habitats 
within it (see Figure 11-7). Different parts of a soil particle contain different 
micro-colonies of bacteria or archaea or have fungal hypha growing through 
them. Some parts are aerobic, but many are anoxic and home to anaerobic 
microorganisms.
	
Figure 11-7: 
Soil 
habitats.
	
One very important soil habitat for microorganisms is around the roots of 
plants, called the rhizosphere (refer to Figure 11-7). Plant roots excrete many 
compounds into the soil such as organic acids, amino acids, and sugars. These 
compounds attract and support the growth of many kinds of microbes, includ-
ing bacteria and fungi. Some of these rhizosphere microbes are beneficial to 
plants because they compete with pathogens in the soil and produce small 
molecules that are taken up by the plant and used in maintaining hormone 
balance. These beneficial microorganisms are called plant-growth-­promoting 
rhizobacteria (PGPR) because they promote plant growth and live in the rhizo-
sphere, unlike symbiotic bacteria, which live inside plant tissues.
Getting Along with Plants and Animals
Microorganisms don’t just inhabit the nonliving parts of ecosystems, there 
are many microbial habitats on and in other organisms, including plants, ani-
mals, and even humans. The intensity of the interaction between microbes 

171
 Chapter 11: Uncovering a Variety of Habitats
and their living habitat can be anywhere from very high (where both need 
each other to live) to low enough that neither really notices the other. Very 
intimate relationships between organisms are called symbiosis, with the 
microorganism called the symbiont and the other called the host. The nature 
of the relationship between organisms can be positive, negative, or neu-
tral. For the most part, only positive and neutral relationships are covered 
here because negative relationships, such as infections, are discussed in 
Chapters 15 and 17.
Microorganisms can form a symbiotic relationship with one another, as well 
as with other organisms. Lichen are an example of this where algae or cya-
nobacteria live in very close association with fungal hypha to the mutual 
benefit of both of them. The algae or cyanobacteria make organic compounds 
through photosynthesis, and the fungus provides support and protection. 
When a lichen reproduces, spores are made of an algal cell wrapped in a 
small fungal hyphae (see Figure 11-8).

Lichen.
	

172
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Living with plants
Plants are teeming with microorganisms. Every surface of a plant — both 
above ground and below ground — is colonized with microorganisms. Plants 
form intimate relationships with some microorganisms, like bacteria and 
fungi, that provide them with fixed nitrogen, small molecules, and protec-
tion from pathogens in exchange for sugars. There are many different types 
of plant-microbe interactions, a few of which are covered here.
As mentioned in the earlier section on the nitrogen cycle, plants are limited 
by a lack of fixed nitrogen and often live in association with nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria, which occur either in the soil as free-living microbes or within plant 
root tissues.
Legumes are plants that form a root nodule within which rhizobia live. The 
term rhizobia refers to the group of nodule-forming rhizobacteria that include 
species of Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, among others. Figure 11-9 gives an 
overview of how bacteria infect the root hair and then form the nodule within 
which they fix nitrogen that benefits the plant. Legumes are extremely impor-
tant to agriculture because they return some fixed nitrogen to the soil when 
planted in rotation with other crops. Rhizobia have a preference for which 
legumes they’ll colonize so there is a different species for each type of plant, 
including alfalfa, clover, soybean, and peas.
Nonlegume plants also form an interaction with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. One 
example is the alder tree, which can associate with the filamentous bacteria 
Frankia. The partnership generates enough fixed nitrogen that alder trees can 
grow in nitrogen-poor soils. Frankia is not as picky as the rhizobia and will 
also colonize other woody plants.
Mycorrhizal fungi form important symbiotic relationships with many different 
plants, some of which are dependent on the fungi for survival. (See Chapter 13 
for a complete discussion of mycorrhizal fungi.) Mycorrhiza is the name for 
the fungal growth, which extends out to cover an area that is much greater 
than that of the plant’s own root system. Although the mycorrhiza doesn’t 
perform nitrogen fixation, it does provide the plant with access to more water 
and nutrients than it would otherwise get.
The bacterial genus Agrobacterium forms a parasitic association with plants, 
called crown gall disease, causing large tumor-like growths on plant tissues. 
Agrobacterium species carry a large plasmid, called the tumor-inducing (Ti) 
plasmid, which they transfer into the DNA of the host plant. Once integrated 
into the plant’s DNA, the genes from the Ti plasmid direct the plant cells to 
make modified amino acids called opines that can only be metabolized by the 
bacteria and are used as a source of carbon and nitrogen. Agrobacterium is 
considered a plant pest, but research on the Ti plasmid has been useful in bio-
technology strategies that aim to genetically alter plant cells (see Chapter 16).

Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Living with animals
Although omnivores get some nutrients from fermentation of plant material 
in the gut, herbivores are completely reliant on it for survival. Cellulose is 
the structural material in plant tissues and is made up of glucose molecules. 
Because only microbes have the enzyme to digest cellulose into glucose 
subunits, they’re essential to the survival of ruminant animals (like cows). 
Ruminants have a specialized stomach, rumen, where plant material is fer-
mented by bacteria.
Most of these bacteria are cellulolytic, and they require the proper pH, tem-
perature, and anoxic environment within the rumen to happily go about fer-
menting cellulose. After the microbes break down the cellulose into glucose, 
the glucose is fermented into small fatty acids, which are absorbed by the 
animal for nutrients. Then the bacteria themselves are digested, providing 
protein and vitamins. CO2 and CH4 gas are produced as waste products and 
are belched out. Besides cellulose-degrading and glucose-fermenting bacte-
ria, the rumen also contains methanogenic archaea, which use the H2 pro-
duced by fermenters to reduce CO2 to CH4.
All animals are likely colonized by microbes, and the human body is no 
exception. It has been estimated the there are ten times more microbial cells 
than human cells in a single person. Considerable effort has been put into 
cataloguing microbes that inhabit the human body using 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing. Numerous studies using this method have found evidence of 
bacteria at sites including the entire length of the digestive tract, the respira-
tory tract, the urogenital tract, as well as the skin. The role of these microor-
ganisms in human health and disease is still unclear, but a concerted effort 
is being made to see if there is a pattern of microbial colonization associated 
with human health. It’s not yet clear, but it has been suggested for some time 
that even sites traditionally considered sterile are colonized with bacteria, 
such as the brain and the fetus in utero.
Living with insects
Like all other animals, insects are colonized by a diverse set of microbial spe-
cies. Unlike other animals, as far as we know, insects can have symbionts that 
affect their reproduction. It’s estimated that 60 percent of insect species are 
infected with microbes that are passed from parents to offspring and affect 
both the sex and survival of the larvae. An example of a reproductive manipu-
lator bacteria is Wolbachia, which is discussed in the sidebar in Chapter 12.

175
 Chapter 11: Uncovering a Variety of Habitats
The termite hindgut also acts like a rumen, digesting cellulose and hemicel-
lulose with the help of microbial symbionts. Some termites have mainly 
bacteria in their hindguts, whereas others have both bacteria and anaerobic 
protists. The protists within the termite gut also have symbionts that make 
either CH4 or acetate as a waste product.
Living with ocean creatures
Some of the most interesting microbial symbionts are those of ocean 
invertebrates.
For example, a small species of squid has a light organ colonized by a bacte-
rial species called Aliivibrio fischeri. The light organ emits light at night, which 
protects the squid from predators swimming below it that mistake the light for 
moonlight. The squid selectively chooses its symbiont from among the many 
other microbes in seawater and then lets the chosen bacteria grow to high cell 
densities within its body; then it expels the whole population once a day.
Around hydrothermal vents, giant tube worms take up reduced inorganic 
compounds like H2, H2S, or NH4
+, which are delivered to bacterial symbionts 
that use them as electron donors for metabolism. These bacterial autotrophs 
make organic material that supplies the tube worms with all the nutrients 
they need.
Corals form some of the most ecologically important structures in the ocean, 
providing habitats for countless fish. Although not technically an obligate 
symbiosis between an algae and a marine invertebrate, corals are much less 
healthy without the algae.
Tolerating Extreme Locations
Eukaryotes don’t tolerate extreme conditions well. The most resilient cells 
are those of bacteria and, especially, archaea.
Thermophiles are organisms that thrive at high temperatures, in particular 
enjoying growth above 45°C. Hyperthermophiles require even hotter temps, 
with optimum growth happening above 80°C, and the most heat-tolerant 
archaea has been found to grow at above 122°C. Thermophiles are found in 
hot springs and other geothermal locations, but only environments under 
pressure, like hydrothermal vents deep within the ocean, allow water to heat 
up to temperatures above 100°C.

176
Part III: Sorting Out Microbial Diversity 
Another essential characteristic of microbes found deep in the ocean is the 
ability to tolerate high pressure. Piezophiles can not only withstand the high 
pressures of deep sea environments but thrive there. They grow optimally 
at pressures between 300 and 400 atm (a unit of pressure: the standard 
atmosphere) but can also grow at 1 atm (the atmospheric pressure at sea 
level, which would be considered normal for us). Extreme piezophiles from 
the Mariana trench require more than 400 atm and grow optimally at 700 to 
800 atm.
Acidophiles are bacteria and archaea that require low acidity to survive. 
Acidic environments include soils near volcanic activity, in the stomach, and 
in acid mine drainage. Although the term acidophile is defined as something 
with an ability to grow at a pH below 4, the environments mentioned all have 
a pH of less than 2 and are known to harbor bacteria and archaea.
Psychrophiles do well in cold temperatures like polar seawater, arctic snow, 
and the depths of the ocean. These bacteria and archaea and algae function 
best below 15°C and many can be killed by 20°C temperature.
Detecting Microbes in Unexpected Places
It seems like everywhere we look for microorganisms, we find them. What is 
still uncertain is how they impact both their own environments and our lives. 
There is a lot of interest in finding microbes where we haven’t looked for 
them before and measuring their activities.
Keeping it together
Archaeal cell membranes are perfectly suited 
to hot temperatures because they don’t melt like 
bacterial cell membranes. This is because the 
cell membranes of archaea are a single layer 
of phytanyl subunits that are actually bonded 
to one another. In bacteria, the cell membrane 
is made up of two layers of phospholipids that 
associate with each other because of hydro-
phobic interactions (that is, because they’re 
not soluble in water). This means that where 
the bacterial cell membrane is flexible and will 
start to disintegrate at high temperatures, the 
archaeal cell membrane is more rigid and will 
stay intact even when temperatures rise.

 Chapter 11: Uncovering a Variety of Habitats
Finding microbes in our built environment has really taken off in recent 
years, with studies of everything from showerheads to airplanes to concrete. 
Locating microbes in hospitals and on hospital equipment is increasingly 
important as the numbers of hospital-borne infections and antibiotic-resistant 
pathogens keep growing.
Are there microbes in space? There is some controversial evidence of some-
thing on two meteorites, but it’s not clear if they represent fossilized micro-
bial remains or something else.
Microbes in space
If we do find microorganisms that we think orig-
inated in space, we really want to make sure 
that we didn’t put them there. NASA spends a 
great deal of energy making sure that the equip-
ment that it sends out into space isn’t carrying 
some tiny earthly passengers. Anything that 
will be launched into space, especially for mis-
sions to Mars or farther, is built in a clean room 
that has special air handling and is cleaned 
and sterilized every day. Clean rooms are not 
unique to the space industry — they’re used by 
the pharmaceutical and the medical equipment 
manufacturing industries.
To make sure that their clean rooms are free 
of life, NASA microbiologists look carefully for 
any viable organisms. A new species of bacte-
ria named Tersicoccus phoenicis was found in 
two different NASA clean rooms. Ironically, it’s 
only because the areas are frequently cleaned 
with chemicals, heat, and drying that micro-
organisms capable of surviving these harsh 
conditions are selected for. It’s also likely that 
these organisms live happily somewhere in the 
environment, but because no one is looking for 
them, they’ve never been seen before.

In This Chapter
▶	Becoming familiar with the Bacteria
▶	Introducing the Archaea
A
 
long with viruses, the prokaryotes make up most of the evolutionary 
diversity on the planet. A rough estimate puts the number of bacterial 
and archaeal cells on earth at around 2.5 × 1030. The number of species is 
harder to pin down. Some scientists think that there are far more prokaryotic 
species than all eukaryotic organisms combined, whereas others think that 
it’s the reverse. Either way, more prokaryotic species are being discovered 
every year, and it’s likely that we’ve just hit the tip of the diversity iceberg!
	
Prokaryote is sort of a misnomer because it’s used to talk about all non-
nucleated cells, as opposed to eukaryotes, which have a nucleus and organ-
elles, among other things. Both the Bacteria and the Archaea fall into this 
category, but they’re more distantly related to one another than are the 
Archaea and the Eukaryota (the third major domain of life) and so they tech-
nically shouldn’t be grouped together. Because the Bacteria and the Archaea 
have many other similarities, it’s simply more convenient to consider them at 
the same time in this book. However, archaea and bacteria are fundamentally 
different from one another in terms of cellular structures and genes, includ-
ing those used to determine ancestry.
Making sense of the vast numbers of different species and lifestyles is no easy 
task. In truth, scientists will be working for many years and there still won’t 
be a tidy sorted list. With this in mind, we’ve put together a chapter describ-
ing the major differences between the different prokaryotes based roughly on 
how they’re related to one another and how they live.
Another term for how things are related to one another in the evolutionary 
sense is phylogeny. Phylogeny is measured by comparing the genetic code in 
each organism. There are several ways to do this, which are summarized in 
Chapter 11.

182
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
	
There are three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, and within 
each are several phyla. A phylum is a major evolutionary division that is then 
divided again as class, then order, then family, then genus, then species. This 
type of organization is called taxonomic classification and each of these divi-
sions is called a taxonomic rank.
	
Kingdom used to be the highest taxonomic rank until recently when the higher 
rank of domain was added. Kingdom is still an important rank when describing 
major groups within the domain Eukarya, but it’s less useful for describing the 
Bacteria and the Archaea domains. For this reason, kingdom isn’t used in this 
chapter.
Getting to Know the Bacteria
Of the two domains of prokaryotes, the Bacteria are the best studied and 
contain all known prokaryotic pathogens. In reality, only about 1 percent of 
all bacteria have been studied in any detail and of these only a small propor-
tion cause disease. Some, like Pseudomonas, take the opportunity to colonize 
humans when their immune system is down, but they aren’t primarily human 
pathogens thriving mainly as free-living bacteria in soils. Others, like Wolbachia 
and Mycoplasma, lack a cell wall and cannot live outside a host cell. Figure 12-1 
shows a general view of the known phyla in the domain Bacteria.

logenetic 
tree of the

 Chapter 12: Meet the Prokaryotes
The Gram-negative bacteria: 
Proteobacteria
This phylum contains all kinds of interesting metabolic diversity that doesn’t 
match the evolutionary paths of diversity. This might be because members 
have been swapping DNA and have taken on traits that other bacteria had to 
evolve. This type of genetic transfer is called lateral gene transfer (LGT, or 
sometimes horizontal gene transfer, HGT) and makes deciphering bacterial 
evolution a bit tricky. The Proteobacteria can be divided genetically into five 
major classes named for letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha (α), beta (β), 
delta (δ), gamma (Ι), and epsilon (ε).
This group seems to have the largest number of species, and many of them 
have been isolated in laboratory culture. Many members of the Proteobacteria 
are models for the study of microbial systems like genetics (E. coli) and anoxic 
photosynthesis (purple sulfur bacteria).
Autotrophic lifestyles
Nitrifiers oxidize inorganic nitrogen compounds like ammonia and nitrate for 
energy. All are environmental, found in sewage treatment plants as well as 
soil and water. They’re different in that they have internal membranes that 
help with compartmentalizing toxic compounds made as a part of the oxida-
tion process.
	
Ammonia oxidizers have names that start with Nitroso– (for example, 
Nitrosomonas), and nitrate oxidizers have names that start with Nitro– (for 
example, Nitrobacter).
Sulfur oxidizers live either in acidic or neutral environments rich in sulfur 
compounds. The acid-tolerant sulfur oxidizers (like Thiobacillus) acidify their 
environment by making sulfuric acid as a waste product during metabolism, 
and many can also use iron as an energy source. Neutral sulfur environments 
like sulfur springs and decomposing matter in lake sediments are home to 
sulfur oxidizers like Beggiatoa that grow in long chains and often have sulfur 
granules deposited within their cells.
On the other side of the coin, sulfate and sulfur can be used by sulfate and  
sulfur-reducing bacteria. These include members like Desulfobacter, Desulfovibrio, 
and Desulfomonas, all of which are members of the Deltaproteobacteria and most 
of which are strictly anaerobic — there are some exceptions. If iron is present in 
the media, these bacteria will cause it to turn black.

184
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
Hydrogen oxidizers like Paracoccus oxidize H2 in the presence of oxygen (O2), 
which results in electrons and H2O. They use an enzyme called hydrogenase 
to produce ATP from the oxidation of H2 (see Chapter 9).
Methane is a major gas in places lacking oxygen like the rumen of herbivores or 
the mud at the bottom of lakes. Here methane is produced by species of archaea 
that is converted by methanotrophic bacteria, such as Methylococcaceae, back 
into carbon dioxide or organic material.
Nitrogen fixers are actually heterotrophs that fix nitrogen, which is very cool. 
Very few bacteria are able to fix nitrogen (N2) from the air into a form that 
is usable in the cell (ammonia, NH4). Those that can are interesting because 
they need oxygen for their metabolism. Nitrogenase, the critical enzyme for 
nitrogen fixation, is extremely oxygen sensitive. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria 
get around this problem in two ways. Free-living nitrogen fixers form a thick 
slime around their cells that lets them have just the right amount of oxygen 
but not too much. Others, like Rhizobium, live in an intimate association with 
the roots of plants (such as soybean) inside which they aren’t exposed to too 
much oxygen.
Heterotrophic lifestyles
The pseudomonads are ecologically important in soil and water and can 
break down things like pesticides. They can only metabolize compounds 
through respiration (they can’t use fermentation), but most of the group can 
do this both aerobically and anaerobically. They can metabolize many organic 
compounds (more than 100) but don’t make hydrolytic enzymes, which 
means that they can’t break down complex food sources like starch. Members 
of the group include Burkholderia, Ralstonia, and Pseudomonas. Several pseu-
domonad species are opportunistic human pathogens and specific plant 
pathogens.
The genera Neisseria, Moraxella, Kingella, and Acinetobacter are all aerobic, 
nonswimming Proteobacteria with a similar shape, so they’re often grouped 
together. The interesting thing about their cell shapes is that many (all 
except Neisseria, which has a round shape called coccoid all the time) are rod 
shaped during log growth and then switch to a coccoid shape in stationary 
phase. Moraxella and Acinetobacter use twitching motion (see Chapter 4) to 

185
 Chapter 12: Meet the Prokaryotes
get around. Most are found as commensals associated with moist surfaces in 
animals (such as mucous membranes), but some species of each are human 
pathogens and Acinetobacter in particular is more common in soil and water.
The enteric bacteria are facultative aerobes (not inhibited by oxygen) that 
ferment sugars with many different waste products. The bacteria in this group 
are all closely related within the Gammaproteobacteria and so are sometimes 
difficult to tell apart. Many are of medical and industrial importance. Most 
are rod shaped, and some have flagella, but for the most part they’re distin-
guished from the pseudomonads based on the fact that they produce gas 
from glucose and don’t have specific proteins needed to make the electron 
transport chain (cytochrome c) needed for respiration. This group includes 
the following genera: Salmonella, Shigella, Proteus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, 
Serratia, Yersinia, and Escherichia. Of note is the genera Escherichia that 
includes the best-studied species of bacteria, E. coli, which has been used in 
countless research and industrial applications. The genus Yersinia contains 
the species Y. pestis that was responsible for the plague of the Middle Ages.
A group of Proteobacteria similar to the enteric bacteria are the Vibrio bac-
teria. Members of this group do have a cytochrome c gene, but otherwise 
they’re pretty similar in other respects to the enterics. The group is named 
for the genus Vibrio, which contains not only the pathogen V. cholera but 
many other aquatic bacteria that produce fluorescent light in a process 
called bioluminescence. Other members of this group include the genera 
Legionella and Coxiella.
The Epsilonproteobacteria include bacteria found as commensals and patho-
gens of animals like Campylobacter and Helicobacter that are also common in 
environmental samples from sulfur-rich hydrothermal vents.
Interesting shapes and lifecycles
The Spirillia are spiral-shaped cells with flagella for moving around. They’re 
different from the Spirochaetes, which are distantly related and have different 
cellular structures. Two interesting examples of spiral-shaped Proteobacteria 
include Magnetospirillum, which have a magnet inside each cell (see the example 
in Figure 12-2) that helps them point north or south, and Bdellovibrio, which 
attacks and divides inside another bacterial cell.

186
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
	
Figure 12-2: 
Magnetic 
bacteria.
	
A sheath is like a tube inside which many bacterial cells divide and grow pro-
tected from the outside environment. Sheathed bacteria are often found in 
aquatic environments rich in organic matter like polluted streams or sewage 
treatment plants. When food gets scarce, the bacteria all swim out to look for 
a better place to live, leaving behind the empty sheath. Some bacteria, such 
as Caulobacter, form stalks that they use to attach themselves to surfaces 
in flowing water. Budding bacteria, such as Hyphomicrobium, reproduce by 
first forming a long hyphae at the end of which forms a new cell in a process 
called budding.
	
Budding is different from binary fission (where the cell divides into two equal 
parts) because the cell doesn’t have to make all the cell structure before it 
starts to divide. Budding is often used by bacteria with extensive internal 
structures that would be difficult to double inside of one cell.
The Rickettsias are obligate intracellular parasites of many different eukary-
otic organisms, including animals and insects.

187
 Chapter 12: Meet the Prokaryotes
The Myxobacteria have the most complex lifestyle of all bacteria that involves 
bacterial communication, gliding movement, and a multicellular life stage 
called a fruiting body. When the food sources are exhausted in one site, myxo-
bacterial cells swarm toward a central point where they come together and 
form a complex structure called a fruiting body that produces mixospores. 
These mixospores can then disperse to a new location where a new food 
source can be found.
More Gram-negative bacteria
Many of the known Gram-negative bacteria are from the phylum 
Proteobacteria, but there are several other phyla that are also Gram-negative. 
Each is unique and an important part of the microbial world:
	
✓	Cyanobacteria: The phylum Cyanobacteria were likely the first oxygen-
making organisms (through photosynthesis) on earth and were critical 
for converting the earth’s atmosphere into the pleasantly aerobic one it 
is today. They come in all shapes and sizes, as shown in Figure 12-3, from 
single cells to colonies and chains with specialized structures where 
nitrogen fixation occurs (called heterocysts).
Who’s your daddy? Wolbachia!
Species of Wolbachia live inside the cells 
of their host and infect countless species of 
beetle, fly, mosquito, moth, and worm (among 
many others) — more than 1 million species in 
all. In some cases, it’s a parasite, causing its 
host harm; in other cases, it forms a mutualistic 
relationship with its insect host, a situation that 
is beneficial for both parties.
Some species of insect actually need to be 
infected with Wolbachia in order to reproduce 
successfully. In many cases, infection alters 
how or if the embryos develop. Here’s an exam-
ple: The Wolbachia bacteria can infect female 
eggs but not the male sperm. Infected females 
then produce female offspring without being 
fertilized. Infection makes the male sterile so 
that he can’t fertilize an uninfected female.
Other strategies to increase the number of 
infected female offspring include killing male 
embryos and changing males into females 
after they’ve developed. Some of the insects 
that these bacteria infect are themselves para-
sites of animals. For example, heartworm that 
infects dogs requires a Wolbachia infection to 
reproduce; if the worm is treated with antibiot-
ics, it dies.
As we talk about in Chapter  15, however, 
using antibiotics this way eventually leads to 
antibiotic resistance in bacteria, so ideally it 
won’t catch on as a treatment. We still don’t 
understand a lot about this phenomenon, but 
research into how it works and how it affects 
insect, animal, and plant populations is ongoing.

188
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
	
Figure 12-3: 
Cyano­
bacteria.
	
	
✓	Purple sulfur bacteria: The purple sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide 
(H2S) as an electron donor to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and are found 
in anoxic (oxygen-free) waters that are well lit by sunlight and in sulfur 
springs. This group contains more than 40 genera with examples such as 
Lamprocystis roseopersicina and Amoebobacter purpureus, as well many 
species of Chromatium.
	
✓	Purple nonsulfur bacteria: The purple nonsulfur bacteria can live in the 
presence and absence of oxygen in places with lower concentrations of 
hydrogen sulfide. They’re photoheterotrophs, meaning that they can use 
photosynthesis for energy but use organic compounds as carbon sources. 
Many have Rhodo– in their names like Rhodospirillium, Rhodovibrio, and 
Rhodoferax, among others.
	
✓	Chlorobi: The phylum Chlorobi are called the green sulfur bacteria and 
are also phototropic (gathering energy from light), but they’re very differ-
ent from the green Cyanobacteria. For one thing, they live deep in lakes 
where they use hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as an electron donor and make 
sulfur (S0) that they deposit outside their cells. For another, they don’t 
produce oxygen during photosynthesis, so they didn’t contribute to the 
oxygenation of the earth’s atmosphere like the Cyanobacteria did.
	
✓	Chloroflexi: The phylum Chloroflexi is also known as the green nonsulfur 
bacteria. These bacteria are found near hot springs in huge communities 
of different bacteria called microbial mats (see Chapter 11), where they 
use photosynthesis to gather energy without producing oxygen.
	
✓	Chlamydia: The phylum Chlamydia is made up entirely of obligate intra-
cellular pathogens. These bacteria can’t live outside a host cell, so they 
must continuously infect a host. Members of this group cause a myriad 
of human and other animal diseases and are transmitted both sexually 
and through the air where they invade the respiratory system.

189
 Chapter 12: Meet the Prokaryotes
	
✓	Bacteroidetes: The phylum Bacteroidetes contains bacteria common in 
many environments, including soil, water, and animal tissues. The genus 
Bacteroides can be dominant members of the large intestine of humans 
and other animals and are characterized by being anaerobic and pro-
ducing a type of membrane made of sphingolipids that are common in 
animal cells but rare in bacterial cells. Other important genera include 
Prevotella, which are found in the human mouth, and Cytophaga and 
Flavobacterium, found in soils around plant roots.
	
✓	Planktomycetes: Members of the phylum Planktomycetes stretch the 
concept of prokaryote because they have extensive cell compartmen-
talization, (see Figure 12-4), usually only seen in eukaryotic cells. These 
compartments are especially useful to keep by-products like hydrazine 
(a component of jet fuel) contained (see Chapter 9).
	
Figure 12-4: 
Anammox 
bacteria.
	
	
	These bacteria live mainly in aquatic environments like rivers, streams, 
and lakes where some attach to surfaces by a stalk so that they can take 
up more nutrients from the surrounding water. These stalked bacteria 
divide by budding to produce a swimmer cell that takes off to find a new 
place to attach.
	
✓	Fusobacteria: The phylum Fusobacteria contains bacteria with cells 
that are long and slender with pointed ends. Some of the species of this 
group are found in the plaque of teeth as well as in the gastrointestinal 
tract of animals. They are anaerobic and members include Fusobacteria 
and Leptotrichia.

190
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
	
✓	Verrucomicrobia: The phylum Verrucomicrobia are named the warty 
(from the Greek verru) cells not because they cause warts but because 
some members look warty. The group is widespread in water and soil, 
but one Genus in particular is associated with the mucosal membranes 
of humans. Akkermansia mucilagina is more often associated with the 
guts of lean people.
	
✓	Spirochaetes: The Spirochaetes are highly coiled bacteria common 
in aquatic environments and associated with hosts. The latter group 
includes human pathogens such as Treponema pallidum that cause 
syphilis, species of Borellia that cause Lyme disease, as well those that 
help to break down wood in the guts of termites.
	
✓	Deinococci: The Deinococci share many structures with the Gram-
negative bacteria, but because they have a very thick cell wall they stain 
Gram-positive bacteria. Members of this group are so tough that they 
can withstand levels of radiation 1,500 times higher than would kill a 
person. Not only do they have a tough cell wall, but they have many dif-
ferent DNA repair enzymes that can take a complete Deinociccus radio-
durans chromosome that has been shattered into hundreds of pieces 
by radiation, and put it all back together in the right order.
	
✓	Thermotolerant bacteria: Several bacterial groups spanning many dif-
ferent phyla are thermotolerant. Some examples include
	
•	Aquifex, which are the most thermotolerant bacteria known.
	
•	Thermotoga, which makes a sheath (hence, toga in the name) and 
contains genes similar to those in the Archaea.
	
•	Thermodesulfobacterium, which is a sulfate reducer and makes 
lipids similar to those in the Archaea.
	
•	Thermus, that contains, most famously, the species Thermus aquati-
cus, from which Taq DNA polymerase was isolated. This enzyme is 
essential to many molecular biology applications because it drives 
the polymerase chain reaction (see Chapter 16).
The Gram-positive bacteria
Two phyla, the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, contain the Gram-positive bac-
teria. Although they both have Gram-positive cell walls, they differ in the pro-
portion of Gs (for guanine) and Cs (for cytosine) in their DNA. The Firmicutes 
are also known as the low G + C Gram-positive bacteria (with between 25 per-
cent and 50 percent G + C), and Actinobacteria are also known as the high 
G + C Gram-positive bacteria (with between 50 percent and 70 percent G + C).

191
 Chapter 12: Meet the Prokaryotes
Low G + C: Firmicutes
The Firmicutes can be split roughly based on their ability or lack of the abil-
ity to form endospores. Dividing the group this way is mainly for convenience 
because it’s easy to tell endospore formers from nonendospore formers by 
heating a culture up to kill everything but the spores. Within the two groups, 
there is quite a bit of phylogenetic and metabolic diversity.
Endospore formers, including species of Clostridium and Bacillus, live mostly 
in soil where endospore formation comes in handy when it’s dry. Some infect 
animals and cause nasty diseases, but for the most part this is accidental. 
One important member of this group is Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which 
makes an endospore that contains a crystalline toxin called the Bt toxin (see 
Figure 12-5), which is particularly effective against many species of insect. Bt 
toxin is used extensively as an insecticide in agriculture (see Chapter 16).
	
Figure 12-5: 
Bacillus 
thuringiensis 
endospore 
with toxin 
crystal.
	
The bacterial genera that don’t form endospores can be grouped further 
into the Staphylococci and the Lactococci. Both groups contain commensal 
and pathogenic bacteria of animals and are distinguished by where they’re 
found and their metabolism. For instance, the Staphylococci are tolerant 
of salt and are found on the skin, whereas the Lactococci are fermentative 
bacteria (Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus), found in the guts of animals 
(Enterococcus) and in milk (Lactococcus).

192
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
High G + C: Actinobacteria
The phylum Actinobacteria contains many very common soil bacteria 
and several bacteria that are commensal of the human body, as well as 
a few notable human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 
Corynebacterium diphtheria. Here are three important genera represented in 
this phylum:
	
✓	Members of the genus Proprionibacterium ferment sugars into propionic 
acid and CO2 gas and are the main bacteria used to make Swiss cheese. 
The gas makes the holes in the cheese, and the acid gives it a nutty 
flavor.
	
✓	Colonies of Mycobacteria have a waxy surface because of special acids 
in their cell walls called mycolic acids that make them difficult to stain in 
the regular way. Instead, heat and acid are used to stain cells red so that 
they can be visualized under a microscope. This group has many non-
pathogenic members as well as M. tuberculosis.
	
✓	The Streptomyces were thought for a long time to be a type of fungus 
because they make big filamentous clusters. They are, in fact, bacteria 
that, instead of dividing by binary fission into individual cells, form 
mycelia that make spores, which then pop off to populate new areas 
(see Figure 12-6). More than 500 different antibiotics have been isolated 
from this group, many of which are used in medicine today.

 Chapter 12: Meet the Prokaryotes
Acquainting Yourself with the Archaea
Also known as archaebacteria (archaea, from the Greek, means “ancient”), 
the archaea are thought to be the oldest forms of cellular life on earth. They 
differ from the bacteria in a few fundamental ways but until recently were 
thought to be part of the domain Bacteria. When sequencing genes to test 
the evolutionary relationship between microorganisms became popular, it 
became clear that the Archaea weren’t part of the Bacteria at all but made up 
a division of their own.
Since their discovery in the late 1970s, there has been a steady increase in 
the number of described members. Each time a new group is found, infor-
mation is added to what is known about the evolution of the entire group, 
because new members help to resolve the branching in the phylogenetic tree, 
shown in Figure 12-7. It’s likely that many more archaea will be discovered 
and that the current tree will change quite a bit.
	
Figure 12-7: 
The phylo-
genetic tree 
of Archaea.
	
	
Currently, there are two main phyla in the domain Archaea: the Euryarchaeota 
and the Crenarchaeota. However, within the Crenarchaeota, there may soon 
be a few new phyla, including the Thaumarchaeota, the Korarchaeota, and the 
Aigarchaeota.
	
As new archaeal strains are discovered, the gaps in what we know about how 
all archaea are related get filled in.

194
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
As with the Bacteria, there are far too many archaeal species to describe 
them all here but you can go to www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/
Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=2157 for a complete list. In this section, we 
discuss representatives of the different forms of archaeal life, filling you in 
on their ability to tolerate extremes of temperature, acidity, and salinity. It’s 
likely that the most extreme of the Archaea were some of the first life forms 
on earth, evolving during a time when the earth was hotter and harsher 
than it is now. How they’re able to thrive in extreme conditions is covered in 
Chapter 11.
Some like it scalding: Extreme 
thermophiles
Archaea are well suited to hot temperatures. This is likely because they 
evolved when the earth was younger and hotter and a much harsher envi-
ronment than it is now. The most heat-tolerant microorganisms on earth are 
archaea, and there are many examples that require hot temperatures to grow. 
Many archaea can not only grow at hot temperatures but withstand even 
hotter temperatures. In this section, we provide a list of a few of the most 
extreme and the temperatures at which they can live and grow.
Where do my genes come from?
The Archaea are interesting because they 
have many genes that resemble those in bac-
teria and others that resemble the genes in 
eukaryotes. This is part of the reason why they 
confounded microbiologists for years — they 
couldn’t squarely be placed within the domain 
of Bacteria or Eukarya.
A great example of this is an archaeon (singular 
for archaea) called Methanocaldococcus jan­
naschii, which has core metabolic genes that 
bear some resemblance to those in bacteria, 
but most of the genes for molecular processes 
(things like RNA transcription and protein trans-
lation) have similarities to those in eukaryotes. 
More than a third of its genome (40 percent) 
contains genes that don’t resemble those in 
either bacteria or eukaryotes.
Archaea likely evolved around the same time 
as the earliest bacteria. It’s even possible 
that eukaryotes came from an early archaeal 
ancestor. It’s mysteries like this that make the 
microbiology of the archaea so fascinating.

A thermophile is an organism that loves heat and grows best at tempera-
tures between 50°C and 60°C but can survive up to 70°C. Hyper-thermophiles 
(extreme thermophiles) grow best around 80°C to 90°C but can survive in 
much higher temperatures. Some hyper-thermophiles have been found to 
survive above 120°C in the high-pressure environment of the deep sea near 
hydrothermal vents.
The following archaea are thermophiles and extreme thermophiles:
	
✓	Thermococcus and Pyrococcus are strict anaerobes that get energy 
from metabolizing organic matter in many different thermal environ-
ments. Thermococcus grows fine in a range of temperatures between 
55°C and 95°C, and Pyrococcus grows best at 100°C.
	
✓	Methanopyrus is a hyperthermophilic methanogen (it produces meth-
ane). This group contains a unique kind of cellular membrane not found 
in any other organism. One species of this group, M. kandleri, is the cur-
rent record holder for growth at the hottest temperature, at 122°C. Water 
can attain temperatures this high only in deep ocean environments 
where great pressure stops water coming out of hydrothermal vents 
from boiling.
	
✓	Nanoarchaeum are very small in size and, as shown in Figure 12-8, live 
as parasites on another hypothermophilic archaea, Ignicoccus. These two 
archaea can be found together in hydrothermal vents and hot springs at 
temperatures between 70°C and 98°C.

✓	Ferroglobus can oxidize iron anaerobically. It’s likely that Ferroglobus 
and others like it were oxidizing iron before the earth’s atmosphere con-
tained oxygen, creating blankets of iron deposits on the ocean floor. As 
time went on, this layer of iron got trapped and is now seen as banding 
patterns in ancient rocks.
	
✓	Sulfolobus lives in sulfur-rich, acidic environments like those around 
hot springs where it attaches to sulfur crystals oxidizing the elemental 
sulfur for energy (see Figure 12-9).

tals covered 
in the 
Sulfolobus

closeup of 
Sulfolobus 
cells (right).
	
✓	Desulfurococcus and Pyrodictium are strictly anaerobic sulfur-reducing 
archaea that thrive around marine hydrothermal vents. Desulfurococcus 
grows best at 85°C, whereas Pyrodictium grows best at 105°C.
Going beyond acidic: Extreme acidophiles
Some of the most acid-tolerant microorganisms known are archaea, many 
of which are also thermophilic. Extremely hot and acidic environments are 
some of the most difficult to get to and sample from, which explains why so 
few microorganisms from these environments have been isolated. Here are 
some examples of extreme acidophiles:
	
✓	Thermoplasma lacks a cell wall and can live by sulfur respiration in 
coal refuse piles at temperatures around 55°C and hot springs.
	
✓	Ferroplasma also has no cell wall but lives in very acidic mine drainage 
at medium temperatures. It breaks down the pyrite in the mine waste, 
which acidifies its environment down to a pH of 0.
	
✓	Picrophilus is so well adapted to acidity that it can live at a pH of 0 and 
lower but falls apart when the pH goes up to around 4. Picrophilus has 
been found in acid mine drainage and active volcanoes.

 Chapter 12: Meet the Prokaryotes
Super salty: Extreme halophiles
The haloarchaea, also known as the halobacteria, are extreme halophiles that 
need extra-salty conditions to live.
	
Often archaeal species will have bacteria in their names. This is a remnant 
from a time before we knew how very different the domain Archaea is from the 
domain Bacteria.
The level of salt required is sometimes close the maximum amount of salt 
that water can hold (32 percent), compared to seawater, which contains only 
about 2.5 percent salt. Most halophiles are strict aerobes, requiring oxygen 
and get energy from organic matter.
Salty environments include brine ponds used to evaporate water from briny 
solutions and salterns, which are areas filled with sea water that are left to 
evaporate to make sea salt. Naturally salty environments include the pools 
in Death Valley, the Dead Sea, and soda lakes. Soda lakes are not only super 
saline but also have a very high pH (alkaline).
Here are a few interesting Haloarchaea and halo alkaliphiles (salt and alkaline 
loving) from soda lakes:
	
✓	Halobacteria was the first salt-loving archaeon studied and is the poster 
child for the group. It was used to learn most of what we know about 
the cellular structure and adaptations of highly salt-tolerant archaea. 
Halobacteria have a cell wall made of glycoprotein that is stabilized by 
the sodium ions (Na+) in the environment.
	
✓	Haloquadratum lives in salterns and was named for its unusually shaped 
square cells, which are thin and filled with gas pockets that let it float to 
the surface where the oxygen is.
	
✓	Natronococcus is a halo alkaliphile found in soda lakes with a pH of 
between 10 and 12.
Some have regular shapes like rods and cocci, whereas others can have very 
unexpected shapes like squares or cup-shaped disks.
	
Because water has a tendency to move from an area of low solute concentra-
tion to an area of high solute concentration (which is the concept of osmosis), 
cells have to maintain a higher ion concentration inside than the environmen-
tal ion concentration. This accumulation of compatible solutes inside the cell is 
the only thing that stops it from losing water to the hypersaline environment. 
Halobacterium accumulates massive amounts of potassium (K+) inside its cyto-
plasm to counteract the ultra-high concentration of Na+ outside the cell.

198
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
These microorganisms are so well adapted to their super-salty environments 
that they can’t live without very high levels of sodium in the environment. 
Sodium stabilizes the outside of the cells. In addition, they need a large supply 
of potassium, which is required for the proteins and other components inside 
the cell.
Not terribly extreme Archaea
Despite making up much less of the known microbial world, archaea have a 
big impact on the earth’s geochemical cycles. For instance, many primary 
producers in aquatic and terrestrial habitats are archaea that contribute the 
carbon cycling in these places. The ammonia oxidizing archaea are another 
example that are important players in the nitrogen cycling in the oceans 
because they’re part of the nitrification process. Methanogenic archaea are 
those that produce methane and live in environments lacking oxygen, such as 
the digestive tracts of animals (and humans), aquatic sediments, and sewage 
sludge digesters. They’re important members of carbon cycling, catalyzing 
the final step in the breakdown of organic matter. Examples include
	
✓	Methanobacterium, the cell wall of which contains chondroitin-type 
material. Chondroitin is a major component of cartilage.
	
✓	Methanobrevibacter
	
✓	Methanosarcina
	
✓	Nitrosopumilus, the ammonia-oxidizing ocean archaea
There are archaea living in nonextreme environments, both aquatic and 
terrestrial, including under polar ice in the Arctic Ocean. Scientists have 
evidence that they’re there, but none have either been grown in laboratory 
culture or been fully described.

n Chapter 8, we discuss the relatedness of all organisms and how the tree 
of life has three main branches, or domains, consisting of the Bacteria, the 
Archaea, and the Eukarya. This third branch gave rise to, and contains all of, 
the multicellular organisms, as well as many microorganisms, which we cover 
in this chapter.
Until the advent of DNA sequencing, classification of eukaryotic microor-
ganisms was done by comparing the physiology of eukaryotic groups to 
determine how they related to one another. Although many organisms can 
be classified in this way, many of the evolutionary relationships between 
groups were fuzzy. Now, thanks to modern techniques, we know more about 
­evolution within the domain Eukarya with some interesting changes to how 
we think about this group. For instance, the fungi, thought to be closely 
related to plants, are in fact closely related to animals.
There is a lot of diversity within eukaryotic microbes but they can be divided 
roughly into fungi and protists, with the latter containing much of the diver-
sity within the entire domain.
Fun with Fungi
For years, scientists thought fungi were closely related to plants, but it turns 
out that they’re more closely related to animals. Fungi take many different 
forms, from single-celled yeast to some of the largest and oldest organisms 
on the planet. This diverse group can be split into mushrooms, molds, and 
yeasts, all of which have important roles in nature. They are helpful in that 

200
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
they break down decaying plant and animal material in the environment, and 
are used extensively in the food and drug industries. Some of them, though, 
can be harmful as they are responsible for many economically important 
plant diseases. Some fungi cause disease in humans and animals, but for the 
most part they’re benign and even delicious.
Figuring out fungal physiology
When growing vegetatively (not reproducing), fungi can grow as single cells 
or as filaments. Some grow in both ways, but most fungi use only one form of 
growth. Unicellular (single-cell) fungi include the yeasts that divide either by 
budding or by fission (see Figure 13-1).
Most fungi fall into the filamentous category and are multicellular organ-
isms made up of hypha, which are long filaments of interconnected cells. The 
walls between cells are called septa; septa don’t always completely separate 
one cell from another so cell contents can move from one compartment to 
another. Other fungal hypha — called coenocytic hypha — are not separated 
at all; instead, many nuclei exist within the cytoplasm, which is continuous 
throughout. The dense cluster of fungal hypha that form as the fungi grow is 
called mycelia.
What is a eukaryote?
The term eukaryote is used as a general term 
for all organisms within the domain Eukarya and 
was originally coined from the Greek words eu 
(for true) and karyo (for kernel), referring to 
the fact that eukaryotic cells have a nucleus 
within them. Following this naming strategy, the 
Bacteria and Archaea are called prokaryotes 
(meaning prenucleus), which although con-
venient is a poor term for the other two major 
domains of life (see Chapter 8 for reasons why).
The nucleus is not the only difference between 
eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. 
Eukaryotic cells are usually much larger and 
contain membrane-bound organelles. Next to 
the nucleus, the other organelle considered to 
be a hallmark of eukaryotic cells is the mito-
chondrion. These are present at many copies 
within cells and function to provide the adenos-
ine triphosphate (ATP) necessary to power cel-
lular processes. Another essential organelle is 
the chloroplast, which contains the structures 
necessary for photosynthesis. Both the mito-
chondria and the chloroplasts are thought to 
be the remnants of prokaryotic cells that were 
engulfed by an ancestor of current eukaryotes 
in a process called endosymbiosis, theories of 
which are described in Chapter 8.

201
 Chapter 13: Say Hello to the Eukaryotes
	
Fungal cell walls are made of chitin, a polymer made from glucose. Chitin is a 
lot like cellulose in plants or keratin in animals — it gives cell walls their 
rigidity.
	
Figure 13-1: 
Unicellular 
fungi.
	
The main way that fungi get nutrients is by secreting hydrolytic enzymes that 
break down complex organic matter into simple subunits like amino acids, 
nucleic acids, sugars, and fatty acids. Some of the toughest polysaccharides in 
wood are digested only by fungi, making them important decomposers in an 
ecosystem. Fungi are found everywhere. They often contaminate food and cul-
ture media because they’re versatile, and their spores can be spread very easily.

202
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
Although lifecycles differ among fungal groups, many of them use a cycle 
of asexual reproduction along with a separate cycle of sexual reproduction. 
Fungi that use these two means of reproduction are called holomorphs.
Asexual spore formation involves a specialized structure forming on the end 
of the hypha, producing spores that then get dispersed and grow into a new 
fungus after they land on a food source. The different fungal phyla produce 
different types of spores, a sample of which is shown in Figure 13-2, that are 
used to identify them.
	
Figure 13-2: 
Types of 
asexual 
spores.
	
	
A fungal spore is very different from a bacterial endospore. Fungal spores are 
reproductive. After they’re dispersed, they give rise to new and separate fungi. 
They aren’t overly heat tolerant, but they can survive drying rather well. A 
bacterial endospore is not produced for reproductive reasons but as a sur-
vival mechanism when conditions are unfavorable. An endospore is formed 
within one bacterial cell, is highly resistant to heat and other stresses, and will 
germinate as the original bacterial cell when conditions improve.
Sexual reproduction is a way of increasing the genetic diversity of individu-
als and involves two different fungal hypha coming together to form a struc-
ture containing spores produced through meiosis. Meiosis is the process of 
making cells that contain half of the genetic information of the parent cell, 
called haploid cells, necessary in preparation for mating.
	
In order to reproduce sexually, two compatible fungal cells have to come 
together. The two different yet compatible cell types are analogous to male 
and female if instead of two genders there were many different ones. The 
result is that fungi encounter compatible mating types more often than if they 
could exist only in two types.

203
 Chapter 13: Say Hello to the Eukaryotes
The new fungus, the product of the previous two compatible fungal cells, 
then undergoes meiosis at some point to produce haploid fungi again, allow-
ing another chance of meeting a different compatible fungus, thereby increas-
ing genetic diversity. In the phylum Ascomycetes many species have lost 
the ability to reproduce sexually, and are referred to as anamorphs. Sexual 
reproduction in the Basidiomycetes involves producing a large structure to 
disperse spores called a fruiting body, which is commonly recognized as a 
mushroom.
	
Fungi are generally haploid, meaning that nuclei contain one copy of their 
genome. When two haploid nuclei fuse they become diploid because the result 
is two copies of the genome. Meiosis is splitting of diploid nuclei into two hap-
loid copies, along with a bit of mixing so that the resulting cells don’t have an 
exact copy of either parent but a combination of the two.
	
Plasmogamy and karyogamy are separate but related events in sexual repro-
duction. When two cells fuse and their cytoplasmic contents mix but the 
nuclei don’t fuse it’s called plasmogamy and the resulting cell is called dikary-
otic. When the nuclei in a dikaryotic cell fuse, it’s called karyogamy and the 
result is a zygote. Plasmogamy is more common in the fungi, whereas kary-
ogamy is widespread in nature; one great example of karyogamy is the fusing 
of animal egg and sperm cells during fertilization.
Itemizing fungal diversity
One of the unique things about fungi is that many of them change dramati-
cally throughout their lifecycles — so much so that the different stages have 
often been described as a separate species. Over time mycologists (microbi-
ologists who study fungi) have begun to clean up our understanding of many 
fungal groups, relabeling those that were originally thought to be different 
species but are, in fact, two different life stages of the same species.
Because there are so many different forms of fungi it can be hard to keep 
them all straight. But they can be organized into several different groups 
based on phylogeny (how they are related) and lifestyle — the five major 
phyla for fungi are the Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Glomeromycetes, 
Ascomycetes, and Basidiomycetes. There is still a lot we don’t know about 
fungal evolution, and many species of fungi have yet to be discovered that 
will change how we organize this list.

204
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
Most fungal groups are benign to animals and humans, but some do cause 
animal diseases called mycoses. Mycoses are difficult to treat because drugs 
aimed at fungal cells are also highly toxic to animal cells. Here are some 
examples of fungi-causing mycoses:
	
✓	Opportunistic infections from Microsporidia, Pneumocystis, and 
Cryptococcus cause life-threatening disease in immunocompromised 
people. Microsporidia is in its own phylum, whereas Pneumocystis is an 
Ascomycete and Cryptococcus is a Basidiomycete.
	
✓	Some members of the Chytridiomycete phylum, called chytrids, cause a 
serious disease in frogs by infecting the skin and reducing respiration 
leading to death. A large number of frog species have suffered tremen-
dous losses in their populations recently due to this pathogen.
	
✓	Less serious, yet inconvenient, infections include thrush, caused by 
the yeast Candida albicans, and athlete’s foot, caused by the fungi 
Trichophyton (both Ascomycetes).
There are a number of fungal plant pathogens, many of which cause large 
economic losses of crops and the heartbreaking loss of mature trees. Here 
are some examples:
	
✓	Apple scab starts as a brown discoloration on the fruit and leaves of 
apple and pear trees and eventually turns into dark dry scabs that crack, 
causing a lot of fruit loss. It’s caused by an Ascomycete fungi called 
Venturia and can only be eradicated by removing all diseased plant mate-
rial from near healthy plants.
	
✓	Dutch elm disease and chestnut blight are both caused by different 
Ascomycete fungi. They’re native to China and Japan where trees that 
have evolved along with the fungi have some immunity to disease. In 
North America and Europe, however, Ophiostoma species decimate elm 
tree numbers and Cryphonectria parasitica has almost completely wiped 
out the American chestnut.
	
✓	Wheat rust and corn smut are two economically important plant patho-
gens from the Basidiomycete group. Rusts have in the past devastated 
nearly half of North America’s wheat crops and new, more virulent strains 
are currently threatening much of the wheat varieties grown in Africa. 
They need at least two hosts to complete their lifecycles because they 
spend the winter on one and then infect the other during the summer 
months. Smuts, on the other hand, need only a single host, but they often 
get into the reproductive structures of flowering plants and infect the 
seeds before they even have a chance to be dispersed.

205
 Chapter 13: Say Hello to the Eukaryotes
In addition to pathogenic and benign fungi, there are beneficial fungi that 
associate with plant roots, called mycorrhizae (literally “fungus roots” in 
Greek). These provide an essential symbiosis — many plants, like pine trees, 
can’t grow without their mycorrhizal partners.
Interacting with plant roots
Several different types of fungi form intimate associations with plant roots 
in a beneficial symbiotic relationship and up to 90 percent of plants have a 
mycorrhizal component underground. Most forest soils are rich in mycor-
rhizal fungi that will associate with new seedlings, helping them gain nutri-
ents and moisture, producing enzymes, and offering protection from pests. 
In nutrient-poor soils, mycorrhizal fungi may tip the balance in favor of 
plant survival, and some plants absolutely need them to grow. Pines, for 
instance, would not survive in their preferred sandy soils if it weren’t for 
these associations.
These fungi form extensive structures with plant root tissue that function 
to transfer nutrients between themselves and the plant cells. We’ll talk 
about two different kinds here: the endomycorrhizal (“endo” meaning inside) 
and the ectomycorrhizal (“ecto” meaning outside) fungi.
As their name suggests the endomycorrizal fungi form extensive structure 
within plant root tissues that, in addition to hypha, include fingerlike pro-
jections called arbuscules, important for nutrient exchange, and balloon-
like structures called vesicles, used for fungal storage of plant carbon (see 
Figure 13-3). For this reason, these fungi are called arbuscular mycorrhizal 
fungi (AMF) and they belong to the phylum Glomeromycete. The fungi supply 
the plant with much higher levels of phosphorous that it would absorb on its 
own. In exchange, the plant provides all the mycorrhiza’s carbon needs.
Instead of penetrating extensively into plant tissues, ectomycorrhizal fungi 
form a dense layer of mycelia around plant roots and extend only slightly into 
plant roots (refer to Figure 13-3). At least three different phyla of fungi have 
members that form ectomycorrhizal relationships with plant roots, many 
of which form aboveground structures that are easily recognized as mush-
rooms. The sheath of mycelia protects plant roots from pathogens and allows 
increased uptake of water and nutrients. To interact with plant roots, fungi 
produce a hyphal network, called a Hartig net, that extends a few cell layers 
into root tissue and acts as the site of nutrient exchange.

Ask us about the Ascomycetes
Members of this group of fungi produce spores inside an ascus (Greek for sac). 
Figure 13-4 shows a section through the fruiting body of a conspicuous type of 
cup fungi from this group, often found on the forest floor. The formation of this 
structure starts with the meeting of two individual fungal hypha that interact 
to form hypha containing two nuclei, a process called plasmogamy. These spe-
cial hypha with a double nuclei extend upward and become diploid briefly as 
the nuclei fuse and then undergo meiosis to produce haploid ascospores that 
get dispersed when the asci (plural of ascus) rupture.

207
 Chapter 13: Say Hello to the Eukaryotes
	
Figure 13-4: 
The asco-
carp of a 
cup fungus.
	
Some Ascomycetes have a very different lifestyle from the filamentous fungi just 
mentioned. The most well known of these is the brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces 
that lives mainly as a single cell and divides by asexual budding. Sexual repro-
duction begins with the fusing of two haploid cells that can then remain diploid 
and undergo asexual budding for a long time before meiotically dividing to form 
haploid ascospores that then germinate.
Unlike the teleomorphs that reproduce sexually, anamorphs can only repro-
duce asexually, forming conidia (asexually produced spores) that are dis-
persed to new areas in the search for food. There are several Ascomycetes 
that have done away with sexual reproduction; an example is Penecillium, 
which grows along happily until it runs out of food and then produces conidia 
at the terminal ends of a specialized hyphal structure (refer to Figure 13-2).
Mushrooms: Basidiomycetes
Along with the Ascomycetes, the Basidiomycetes group makes up a large 
part of the diversity of the fungi, with a variety of shapes and spore disper-
sal strategies. Some of the reproductive methods can be quite complicated, 
involving several cycles of asexual and sexual reproduction in association 

208
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
with a number of different hosts. Some members of this group are known 
only by their anamorph (or asexual) stage, and it’s still unclear whether these 
have completely lost the ability to reproduce sexually or if evidence of these 
forms will turn up as scientists describe more species of fungi.
Several Basidiomycetes are well known, but none more so than the mush-
room, whose clublike shape was the inspiration for naming the group (basidio 
means club). The mushroom lifecycle bears similarity to the Ascomycete 
group in that two individual fungi come together, combining their hypha to 
produce a fruiting body containing spores, but the structure of the fruiting 
body and the exact mechanism of spore formation differ (see Figure 13-5).
	
Figure 13-5: 
The 
­mushroom 
lifecycle.
	
Here dikaryotic mycelia grow to make the fruiting body, which is called a 
basidioma, inside which the basidiospores are formed. It’s under the cap 
of the mushroom, between the gills, that spore formation happens. There, 
the two nuclei inside cells at the end of fungal hypha fuse and then undergo 
meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores. These can then disperse and find 
a place to germinate. Some mushrooms are very long-lived; the oldest one to 
date, Armillaria ostoyae, which is approximately 2,400 years old, is also the 
biggest at 2,200 acres, located in Oregon.

209
 Chapter 13: Say Hello to the Eukaryotes
Perusing the Protists
As a catchall for Eukaryotic microorganisms that are not fungi, the Protist 
group contains many different phyla making up most of the diversity within 
the Domain Eukarya. Many shapes, sizes, and lifestyles are represented in 
this group, making it difficult to keep them all straight.
Most are single-celled organisms; some like the algae form multicellular struc-
tures and others like some slime molds live as single cells that congregate 
to form multicellular structures. There is no single formula for reproduction 
either, which ranges from simple division to complicated cycles with many 
different structures.
Instead of discussing each case in great detail, we offer a few examples here 
that show some of the diversity of this group. We present the protists by 
their major habitat, starting with human parasites, plant pathogens, free-
living amoeba and ciliates, and finally the algae and other photosynthetic 
eukaryotes.
Making us sick: Apicoplexans
Although some members of the other groups are known to cause human dis-
ease, these are noteworthy because the diseases they cause are particularly 
unpleasant and/or deadly. Although some can live in the environment before 
infecting animals, others have adapted completely to a parasitic lifestyle, 
having lost many of the genes necessary for a free-living lifestyle.
Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, and Cryptosporidium are part of the same group, 
called Apicoplexans, which are obligate parasites meaning that they can’t live 
outside a host. Malaria, a disease that affects 10 percent of people worldwide 
is caused by species of Plasmodium that has an insect host and a human host. 
This parasite reproduces sexually within the mosquito, producing motile 
sporozoites that are transmitted to a human host by the insect’s bite. In the 
human, cycles of asexual reproduction take place in the liver and blood cells, 
leading to the characteristic fevers and chills associated with the disease. 
Mosquitoes that feed on infected humans then become infected themselves 
and start this complex cycle over again (see Figure 13-6).

210
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
	
Figure 13-6: 
The 
Plasmodium 
life cycle.
	
One strategy used by species of Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma to move 
between hosts is a process called encystment. This involves making a cyst 
that is excreted in the host’s waste. The cyst allows the organism to survive 
long enough to be picked up by another animal, where it can divide asexually 
and set up a new infection.
Species of Trypanosoma (see Figure 13-7) cause nasty diseases, including 
African sleeping sickness, where the parasite invades the spinal cord and 
brain of those infected. Although not a member of the Apicoplexans group, it’s 
passed to humans from a biting insect — the tsetse fly. Species of Trypanosoma 
have a long, slender cell shape that turns in a corkscrew when swimming, 
thanks to a long flagellum that undulates under the cytoplasmic membrane 
along the length of the cell. This swimming motion makes it possible for the 
organisms to move in viscous liquids like blood.

211
 Chapter 13: Say Hello to the Eukaryotes
	
Figure 13-7: 
Flagellated 
protists.
	
Another flagellated parasite, Giardia lamblia (refer to Figure 13-7) can survive 
in rivers and streams and cause a nasty diarrheal disease called giardiasis in 
humans and other animals. Another, Trichomonas vaginalis (refer to Figure 13-7), 
is transmitted sexually but can survive outside the body for a limited time. Both 
of these pathogens lack mitochondria, but they do have a mitosome, which is a 
remnant of a mitochondrion that has lost many of the mitochondrial genes. This 
means that these microbes likely once had mitochondria, but due to their strictly 
parasitic lifestyle, they’ve lost the need to generate much of their  
own ATP.
Making plants sick: Oomycetes
Once thought to be fungi because of their filamentous growth, the Oomycetes 
are responsible for many plant diseases as well as some animal ones. They 
have cell walls and are responsible for breaking down decaying organic matter 
on the forest floor, but as it turns out, they’re more closely related to diatoms 
(see the “Encountering the algae” section, later in this chapter) than to fungi.
Downey and powdery mildews are plant pathogens from this group, but the 
most notorious one, late blight of potato, caused widespread crop losses 
in the 19th century. This pathogen hit Europe, North America, and South 
America hard, but nowhere was as badly hit as Ireland, where it wiped out 
potato crops, all of which were of the same vulnerable variety, causing wide-
spread famine.

212
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
Chasing amoeba and ciliates
Ciliates and amoeba are not part of closely related groups. In fact, they aren’t 
very similar at all. But they’re often grouped together based on the fact that 
they move around chasing their food and ingesting it by phagocytosis.
	
Phagocytosis is the process where the cell membrane moves outward to sur-
round a particle of food on all sides forming a pocket for it called a vacuole. 
The vacuole contents are then completely enclosed inside the cell, separate 
from the cytoplasm, where digestive enzymes can be transferred from cyto-
plasm to vacuole. Once the food is digested, the vacuole breaks open to 
release nutrients into the cellular cytoplasm.
The ciliate Paramecium is a widespread example of this group of microorgan-
isms. It’s covered with cilia that are used for moving around and directing 
food into the equivalent of a ciliate mouth, the oral groove (see Figure 13-8), 
where food is ingested by phagocytosis.
	
Figure 13-8: 
Parame­
cium.
	
	
Cilia are shorter and finer than flagella and beat in unison to create movement.
Most ciliates are abundant in aquatic environments where some swim freely 
and others attach to surfaces by a stalk using their cilia for feeding. Very few 
ciliates are pathogenic to animals, but some do exist.
Amoeba, unlike ciliates, move around using a process that’s named after 
them, amoeboid movement. This type of movement involves extending part of 
the cell outward to form a pseudopodia, within which the cytoplasm streams 

213
 Chapter 13: Say Hello to the Eukaryotes
more freely than in the rest of the cell. When the pseudopodia has reached 
forward, the rest of the cell is pulled forward by contraction of the microfila-
ments inside the cell (see Figure 13-9).

and move-
ment in 
amoeba.
	
Amoeba also have a specialized structure called a contractile vacuole that is 
involved in getting rid of waste.
	
Some amoeba live happily in aquatic and soil environments without ever caus-
ing problems for humans, whereas others are responsible for a deadly form of 
amoebic dysentery.
Slime molds live in environmental habitats and have a very interesting life 
cycle. Until recently, they were thought to be fungi because they produce fruit-
ing bodies during reproduction, but now they’re known to be closely related to 
amoeba. There are two types of slime molds, one that spends most of its time 
as a single cell (cellular) and another that spends its life as a huge mass of 
protoplasm containing many nuclei but without individual cells (plasmodial). 
Plasmodial, or acellular, slime molds move around with amoeboid ­movement 
looking for food; then when resources are gone, they produce haploid flagel-
lated cells that swim off, and eventually two of them fuse to form a new diploid 
plasmodium.
Cellular slime molds live as individual haploid cells, moving around and con-
suming food. Then, when the food runs out, many of them come together to 
form a slug that eventually stops moving and forms a fruiting body in which 
spores are formed. Each spore is released and becomes a new single-celled 
individual (see Figure 13-10).

Encountering the algae
In this section, we cover both algae and eukaryotic microorganisms that make 
up plankton. The term algae is not a taxonomic classification — it’s used 
to describe eukaryotic microorganisms that live a photosynthetic lifestyle 
thanks to chloroplasts (see Figure 13-11) inside the cytoplasm of the cell.
Following an endosymbiosis event, where a eukaryotic ancestor cell engulfed 
a cyanobacteria that eventually became the chloroplast, green and red algae 
evolved (see Chapter 8 for an explanation of the different endosymbiotic 
events that are thought to have happened throughout the earth’s history). 
All algae are oxygenic phototrophs — they use light energy and release 
oxygen into the environment. But unlike the plants that developed complex 

215
 Chapter 13: Say Hello to the Eukaryotes
multicellular structures, like vasculature and roots, algae are either single-
celled or form simple multicellular structures. Figure 13-12 illustrates the 
types of algae that inhabit different environments.

Types of 
algae.
	

216
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
	
There are several different types of algae, usually grouped by color, but only 
red and green algae are closely related to land plants.
	
Red algae contain chlorophyll a and phycobilisomes as the main light-­harvesting 
pigments, but they also contain the accessory pigment phycoerythrin, which 
gives them a red color and masks the green color of chlorophyll.
Red algae can be unicellular or multicellular and live at greater depths than 
other type of algae because they can absorb longer wavelengths of light that 
filter down through the water. Some types of red algae are those used as a 
source of agar for microbiological media; although some can be eaten, others 
produce toxins. Unicellular red algae include the most heat- and acid-tolerant 
eukaryotes known, living in hot springs at a temperature up to 60°C and pH 
as low as 0.5.
Brown algae are called kelp. They’re large multicellular organisms that can 
grow rapidly in their ocean habitat. They produce alginate, which is used as a 
food thickener.
Green algae are most like plants. They have cellulose in their cell walls, con-
tain the same chlorophylls as plants, and store starch. Most green algae are 
unicellular; however, others are either colonial (growing together in a colony), 
filamentous, or able to form multicellular structures (see Figure 13-13). Some 
green algae live in soil; others live inside rocks, using the light that filters 
through their semitransparent home.
Lichen are a symbiotic partnership between a single-celled green algae and a 
filamentous fungi.
Diatoms are a major component of photoplankton. They use photosynthesis 
for energy, but instead of storing it in starch like the green algae do, they 
store it as an oil, which can be lethal if ingested in a high enough concentra-
tion. They make a cell wall of silica, the outermost part of which is called the 
frustule; the frustule remains long after the cell dies. The shapes of diatom 
frustules are often very ornate and beautiful and are either pinnate (elon-
gated) or centric (round). (see Figure 13-14).
Radiolarians and cercozoans are amoebalike microbes that live inside a struc-
ture called a test, which is made either of silica (radiolarians) or of organic 
material strengthened by calcium carbonate (cercozoans). Unlike diatoms, 
they aren’t photosynthetic; instead, they feed on bacteria or other particulate 
matter in the sediments of aquatic environments. They extend part of their 
cells out as needle-thin pseudopodia to gather food and move around.

Dinoflagellates (refer to Figure 13-14) also make up a large part of oceanic 
plankton. They’re photosynthetic, and they swim in a spinning motion using 
two flagella. They have cellulose within the plasma membrane, giving their 
cells a distinct shape. An overgrowth of members of this group can be deadly 
for fish because they produce neurotoxins. The famous red tide is due to 
overgrowth of a red-colored dinoflagellate named Alexandrium that turns the 
water a deep red and causes massive fish kills.

T
 
here are many more viral particles on earth than there are bacterial 
cells — by some estimates ten times more. There is likely a virus for 
every organism, and our guess is that there’s more than one. Viral diversity 
is so great that scientists have only scratched the surface when it comes to 
describing it. As with bacterial diversity, scientists are much more interested 
in viruses for which there is a known disease or impact on human lives.
In this chapter, we explore the shape and function of viruses, along with 
the differences in the types of viruses that infect the different types of 
cells — from bacteria to people to tobacco plants. In addition to viruses, there 
are also virus-like particles that don’t completely fit the definition of a virus. 
These include subviral particles and prions, which we cover in this chapter.
Hijacking Cells
Viruses are obligate parasites, meaning they must have a host. Because 
they aren’t cells and don’t have the machinery necessary to make proteins, 
viruses take over the machinery of a host and use it for their own replication.
Viruses range in size from 28 to 200 nanometers (nm). In contrast, bacteria are 
in the 1,000 to 10,000 nm range and animal cells are in the 10,000 to 100,000 nm 
range.

220
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
Frugal viral structure
There are many different viral forms with different structural components, 
but all viruses are much less complex than living cells. Viruses lack the 
machinery to perform biochemical reactions. All viruses contain nucleic acid, 
which encodes the viral genome (the nucleic acid that codes for the viral 
genes) and the viral capsid (the protein shell that encases the viral genome), 
which may or may not contain viral enzymes. Together, the viral genome and 
viral capsid are called the nucleocapsid. Other viral structures can include 
the envelope and the tail.
The basic structure of some viruses is shown in Figure 14-1.
	
Figure 14-1: 
Viral 
structures.
	
	
Another name for a single virus particle is a virion. This term is used when 
talking specifically about the physical attributes of a virus particle. In compari-
son, the term virus is used when talking about the behavior of the organism.
Both the size and type of nucleic acid found within the viral particle can 
differ between different groups of viruses. Here are a few of the main types of 
nucleic acids, along with how each affects viral structure and replication:
	
✓	DNA viruses: Can have either single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded 
(ds) DNA molecules within the nucleocapsid. If it’s ds, the DNA can be 
directly used for transcription and replication; if it’s ss, the DNA needs 
to form a ds DNA intermediate before it can be used.
	
✓	RNA viruses: Can either have ss or ds RNA molecules within their 
nucleocapsid. These viruses need to encode an RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase for replication of the genetic material because host cells 
don’t have an enzyme that can make RNA from an RNA template.

221
 Chapter 14: Examining the Vastness of Viruses
	
✓	Retroviruses: Exist as ss RNA that has to first be made into DNA, which 
can then be used for transcription and as a template to make the genomic 
copy. These viruses carry the reverse transcriptase enzyme with them 
in their capsid. The DNA copy of the retrovirus genome then integrates 
into the host genome. Reverse transcriptase is an important enzyme for 
molecular biology and biotechnology applications because it allows the 
formation of DNA from an RNA template.
The viral capsid acts to package the nucleic acids so that they can be deliv-
ered to a new host cell. Within the capsid, the genetic material can come as 
one or several molecules, but in all cases the capsid proteins surround the 
genetic material.
Repeated units of one or a small number of proteins are arranged in a symmet-
rical pattern and give viral capsids a geometric appearance when observed by 
electron microscopy. Helical viruses coat their RNA molecule with a protein, 
and the entire capsid forms a helix that is very uniform. In other viruses, an 
icosahedral (20-sided) structure is used for the capsid. The use of an icosa-
hedral is no accident — it’s the most efficient way to form a spherical shape 
using the smallest number of proteins. Examples of the different capsid 
arrangements are shown in Figure 14-1.
Some viruses, mostly those that infect animal cells, have a viral envelope sur-
rounding the viral nucleocapsid. The envelope can be studded with projec-
tions that help the virus interact with its target cell. An example of this is the 
influenza virus, whose viral envelope contains hemagglutinin (a glycoprotein) 
and neuraminidase (a protein) spikes that are important to its attachment 
and release from its host cell. The viral envelope is made of lipids that come 
from the host cell’s lipid membrane during the last stage of viral replication. 
When a virus lacks an envelope, it’s called a naked virus.
The most complex viral structures include those of the bacteriophage. One 
example, shown in Figure 14-1, includes an icosahedral head structure attached 
to a tail with filaments. The complicated tail structure is used to create a hole 
in the bacterial cell wall and then inject the viral genetic material into the cell.
Simplifying viral function
Viral replication is the entire process of making more viral particles, or 
virions. It’s driven by viral genes that have taken control of the host cell’s 
machinery for this purpose.

222
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
	
Some viral replication causes all host processes to stop. This interferes with 
the rhythm of biochemical processes normally carried out, a fact that is 
often irrelevant because the cell will die at the end of viral replication. Other 
viruses only take over a small number of processes, leaving the host cell to 
carry on as usual.
Here is a description of the steps involved in this process, the details of 
which differ between viral groups:
	
1.	 A viral particle attaches to the host cell surface.
	
	 The surface of the viral particle has proteins that interact with recep-
tors on the surface of the host cell. The virus may use one or more host 
receptors, but they have to be present for attachment to occur. Different 
types of cells express different receptors, making viral attachment spe-
cific for a particular cell type.
	
2.	 The entire virus or just the viral nucleic acids enter the host cell.
	
	 The viral genome has to enter the cell so that transcription of viral 
genes can occur. If other enzymes are needed — for example, a reverse 
transcriptase — then they must also enter the host cell.
	
	 The process of releasing the viral contents into the host cell is called 
uncoating, which can happen in a few different ways (see Figure 14-2). 
For example, the viral envelope is necessary to gain entry into animal 
cells, whereas the bacteriophage inject their DNA through a hole that 
they make in the bacterial cell wall.
	
Figure 14-2: 
Uncoating 
of viral par-
ticles during 
penetration 
into the host 
cell.
	

223
 Chapter 14: Examining the Vastness of Viruses
	
3.	 The host cell transcribes and then translates the viral genes.
	
	 The early viral proteins made are those involved in copying the viral 
genome and transcribing viral genes. Mid and late viral genes are for 
capsid and other viral proteins needed to make parts of the viral struc-
ture and are produced in large quantities.
	
4.	 Viral proteins are assembled and the genetic material is loaded into the 
capsid.
	
5.	 Complete viral particles, virions, are released from the host cell. Some 
bud off of the host cell, taking a bit of the cell membrane with them, 
which becomes the viral envelope. Some cause the host cell to lyse (the 
cell membrane, and cell wall if present, are disrupted releasing the con-
tents of the cell) and are released that way.
Because viral genes have different promoters than host genes, often the host 
machinery for things like mRNA synthesis or DNA replication won’t work on 
the viral genome. There are three main strategies for dealing with this:
	
✓	Viruses use host promoters and signals so that viral DNA and RNA look 
like host nucleotides.
	
✓	Viruses modify the host enzymes to recognize viral promoters and DNA.
	
✓	Viruses bring their own enzymes to get the ball rolling and then encode 
the enzymes needed in their genome.
Making Heads or Tails of Bacteriophage
There is likely a phage for every bacterial species, but only a few have been 
studied. In this section, we fill you in on three main viral lifestyles: lytic, lyso-
genic, and transposable.
Lytic phage
Also called virulent phage, lytic phage cause the lysis and almost complete 
destruction of the host bacterial cell. An example is T4 phage that has been 
studied extensively because it infects one of the most studied bacterial spe-
cies, E. coli (see Figure 14-3).

224
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
	
Figure 14-3: 
Bacterio­
phage T4, an 
example of a 
lytic phage.
	
Early in infection, T4 makes a lot of virally encoded proteins for DNA replica-
tion that are much quicker than the host proteins and have a preference for 
replicating viral DNA. This means that many copies of the genome are pres-
ent in the host cell from an early stage. Viral capsid, the head, is made and is 
packaged full of DNA. Then the tail and fibers are added afterward. The viral 
genome is added to the head by threading a string of DNA into the opening at 
one end; when the pressure inside is sufficient, the DNA strand is cut and the 
head is sealed. The pressure inside of the bacteriophage T4 head is ten times 
the pressure in a bottle of champagne.
	
Because the phage copies its genome as a long string without stopping between 
copies, and because the head can fit more DNA than there is in the genome, 
there is always a bit more than one copy of the genome in each virion. Some 
genes are present in more than one copy, and the beginning of the genome isn’t 
the same each time.
After the viral particles have been assembled, T4 lysozyme is made. T4 lyso-
zyme degrades the bacterial cell wall and the viral particles escape, leaving 
the host cell extremely damaged.
Temperate phage
Lysogeny is a survival strategy for viruses, allowing them to lay dormant for 
a period instead of continuing the frenzied cycle of always looking for a new 
host. When a temperate phage infects a host bacterial cell, it can either be 
lytic or lysogenic.

225
 Chapter 14: Examining the Vastness of Viruses
	
The lytic pathway proceeds similarly to that of a lytic phage ending in lysis of 
the host cell to release the viral particles. Sometime before the production of 
structural viral proteins, the virus can switch to the lysogenic state where the 
viral genes are integrated into the host DNA and no viral particles are made.
See Figure 14-4 for an overview of the cycle for a lysogenic virus.
	
Figure 14-4: 
Stages of  
infection 
with a 
temperate 
phage.
	

226
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
Once lysogeny has been induced, the viral genome is integrated into the host 
genome. At this point, it’s called a prophage, and the production of viral rep-
lication and capsid proteins stops. One viral protein is still expressed in the 
host cell; this is the one that represses the expression of all other viral pro-
teins, which would induce the lytic cycle if induced.
	
A bacterial host containing a prophage is called a lysogen. Some prophages are 
integrated into the bacterial chromosome, and others exist as a plasmid.
Things can stay this way for a long time, through several generations of 
bacterial cell division, in fact. The prophage can become induced at a later 
time, which results in the transcription of viral genes and the return to a lytic 
cycle. Not all prophage are ticking time bombs, however. Some prophage 
have lost the ability to be induced and remain in their host’s DNA indefinitely. 
When this happens, the prophage is called a cryptic virus. A cryptic virus can 
no longer make viruses or cause lysis of the host cell. Cryptic viruses some-
times contain genes that are useful for the host and get transcribed along 
with the normal bacterial genes. In some cases, they can make their host 
more virulent (for example, encoding the toxin used by Vibrio cholera).
A similar phenomenon happens with animal viruses. The genomes of most 
organisms are littered with viral sequences that have accumulated over time, 
most of which don’t encode toxins.
Transposable phage
Another type of bacteriophage not only integrates its genome into its host’s 
genome during lysogenic cycles but also repeats this integration as a mecha-
nism for copying its genome for a lytic cycle. These are called transposable 
phage, of which the bacteriophage Mu is best studied. When phage Mu 
infects a bacterial cell, it’s quickly integrated into the host genome by the 
enzyme called transposase. The transposase cuts both strands of the host 
DNA, creating two overhanging sequences between which the genome of Mu 
is inserted (see Figure 14-5). Where there used to be one copy of the host 
sequence, there are now two copies of the 5 bp region, one on either side of 
the Mu genome.
As with the temperate phage, if the Mu repressor is present, it will continue 
as an integrated sequence without increasing the number of copies of its 
genome or lysing the cell. If the repressor is absent, the transposase enzyme 
acts to copy the Mu genome to several locations. Up to 100 copies have been 
seen scattered across the genome.
	
A sequence of DNA that can move from one place to another on the same 
genome is called a transposable element. These transposable elements may 
make a copy of themselves in the process (replicative transposition) or they 
may move as a complete unit to a new position (conservative transposition) .

227
 Chapter 14: Examining the Vastness of Viruses
When the viral capsid is ready, the circular bacterial genome containing the 
many copies of the viral genome is cut around 100 base pairs (bp) before the 
beginning of the Mu genome, and then loaded into each viral head until full. 
The result is that, along with the viral genome, each virion contains around 
1.8 kilobases (kb) of host sequence as well.
Transposable phage are quite useful for research and biotechnology applica-
tions because they cause mutations in the genome wherever they’re inserted. 
They’re useful for studying the function of bacterial genes because they can 
be harnessed to knock out one gene at a time.

The trans-
posable 
phage Mu.
	
Infecting the archaea
Viruses of archaea are known to exist, and many 
have at least been imaged if not studied fully. 
What is known about archaeal viruses is that 
they must be tolerant of extreme environments 
because their hosts are often extremophiles. So 
far, all have shown to be double-stranded DNA 
genomes and many have heads and tails like 
bacteriophage, but none has been fully studied 
and not much is known about their method of 
infection and replication.

228
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
Discussing Viruses of Eukaryotes
There are two main differences between the viruses of bacteria, which are 
prokaryotes, and the viruses of eukaryotes, like animals and plants:
	
✓	In bacteria, the viral particle remains outside the host cell and only the 
viral genome enters. The entire virion enters the host cell in the case of 
animal viruses.
	
✓	Eukaryotes have a nucleus, into which viral genes must enter in order to 
replicate.
Different viruses have different cell specificities. As we note earlier, in the 
“Frugal Viral Structures” section, viral particles have proteins on their sur-
face that interact with host cell receptors, allowing attachment of the viral 
particle to the host cell surface. Which cell type a virus will infect is directly 
determined by which cell types it can enter. Because not all cells in an animal 
express the same receptors, they’re not all susceptible to the same viruses.
Infecting animal cells
Of the grand diversity of viruses on earth, we probably know more about 
viruses that infect animal cells because they’re the types that make people sick. 
There are animal viruses with each of the different types of genomes — for 
instance, double- and single-stranded DNA and RNA. Although the majority of 
animal viruses are enveloped, naked viruses also infect animal cells.
Here’s a list of the different properties of animal viruses:
	
✓	Virulent: viruses that lyse their host cell.
	
✓	Persistent: viruses that are continuously shed from a host cell indefinitely.
	
✓	Latent: Some viruses can have latent infections (not causing an symp-
toms of disease) that emerge as virulent from time to time, but unlike 
with temperate bacteriophage, the viral genome usually doesn’t inte-
grate into the host DNA.
	
✓	Fusogenic: Some virus can promote the fusion of several cells.
	
✓	Oncogenic: Some viruses can cause cancers either by causing mutation 
in the host cell they infect by inserting into the genome, or by altering 
the normal regulation of cell growth control.
Instead of describing all the many types of viral structures and functions, we 
describe two interesting examples in detail here: retroviruses and prions.

229
 Chapter 14: Examining the Vastness of Viruses
Retroviruses
Retroviruses are unique animal viruses that carry with them a special enzyme, 
called reverse transcriptase, which copies the RNA viral genome into double-
stranded DNA. Known retroviruses include the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), which causes AIDS in people, and feline leukemia virus (FeLV), 
which affects domestic cats.
We’ll focus here on the structure and activity of HIV as an example of a ret-
roviral replication cycle (see Figure 14-6). Although other retroviruses infect 
different target cells, many of the steps in infection are similar.
	
Figure 14-6: 
The replica-
tion cycle of 
a retrovirus.
	
Retroviruses are enveloped with a protein capsid containing two copies of 
their viral RNA genome, as well as three different viral enzymes needed for 
infection. The envelope is studded with proteins used for attachment to cells 
of the human immune system, T-lymphocytes. After it attaches to the cell 
surface, the virus is uncoated when the viral envelope fuses with the cell 
membrane, releasing the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. Within the nucleo-
capsid, the reverse transcriptase enzyme copies the RNA genome into double-
stranded DNA, which then enters the host cell nucleus and is integrated into 
the host genome.
	
After the HIV genome is integrated into the host cell’s genome (and called a 
provirus), it can’t be removed because it doesn’t make an enzyme for excision.

230
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
RNA copies of the provirus are transcribed by the host cell machinery and 
are translated into viral proteins, including structural parts like the capsid 
and enzymes, like reverse transcriptase to be packaged into new virions. 
Other copies of the viral RNA are made that will be packaged into these new 
virions and after the nucleocapsid is ready, the virions bud out of the host 
cell membrane, taking a part of it along with them as their viral envelope. 
Viral proteins needed for interacting with new host cells are present on the 
surface of the host cell membrane before budding happens.
Prions
Prions fit the definition of an infectious agent but lack all the characteristics 
of a virus. A prion is a protein that can infect a neuron, cause cell death, and 
be transmitted from one cell to another, but it lacks nucleic acids. In essence, 
when a prion infects a neuron, it acts on other proteins to change their 
structure, making them nonfunctional, insoluble, and difficult to break down. 
These insoluble, useless proteins then accumulate in the cell, leading to cell 
death. When enough of the neurons in an animal’s brain are affected, they 
suffer and die.
Prion diseases affect only animals. There are several forms known, each 
affecting a different species — for example, scrapie (sheep), bovine spon-
giform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease (cow), chronic wasting 
disease (deer), kuru, and Creuztfeldt-Jakob disease (humans). Although each 
form can be passed from individual to individual, it was thought for a long 
time that each type couldn’t cross from one species to another; however, 
the mad cow prion has jumped to people from cows to cause a variant of the 
Creuztfeldt-Jakob disease.
	
The infectious prion protein targets a protein that is normally expressed in all 
neuronal cells that is now called prion protein (PrP). In fact, the normal pro-
tein and the prion are identical in protein sequence; they’re just folded differ-
ently (see Figure 14-7).
	
Figure 14-7: 
Prion 
disease.
	

231
 Chapter 14: Examining the Vastness of Viruses
The normal protein in the correct conformation is labeled PrPC (for cellu-
lar), whereas the prion protein is labeled PrPSc (for the first prion disease 
described, scrapie). When PrPSc enters the neuron, it acts to change PrPC to 
PrPSc. As more PrPSc are made, they act to convert other PrPC to the disease 
kind, and the misfolded proteins combine into tightly packed clumps called 
amyloids. One thing that distinguishes prions from viruses is that they can’t 
induce the expression of proteins they need for infection; they simply act 
on the protein if it’s present. The PrPC protein has a normal function in neu-
rons that isn’t completely understood, but it isn’t always expressed. If PrPSc 
arrives and no PrPC is present to be acted on, then the infection can’t happen.
Following plant viruses
Just like animals (and the prokaryotes), plants are also infected by viruses. 
These include important pathogens of agricultural crop plants. Moreover 
plants are also infected by viroids, which can be thought of as stripped down 
viruses.
Tobacco mosaic virus
Most plant viruses are single-stranded RNA viruses. Tobacco mosaic virus 
(TMV) was the first virus ever discovered and is the most well-studied plant 
virus. It’s a helical RNA virus that is made entirely of a single strand of RNA 
surrounded by many coat proteins (see Figure 14-8).
The viral RNA genome is positive, meaning that it’s the same as what the host 
cell would use as a template for translation. For instance, host mRNA is posi-
tive and the sequence of the nucleic acid sequence is complementary to the 
DNA sequence. The first step is the uncoating of the viral genome. Because 
the genome resembles a host mRNA, it’s used directly for translation of pro-
teins. One of the first enzymes made is the all-important RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase used to make a negative RNA copy (–RNA) of the genome from 
which more positive RNA genomes (+RNA) can be made.
Next, movement proteins and the coat proteins are made that enable the 
virus to infect other plants through cell damage from an insect or other herbi-
vore. Another method that TMV uses to increase viral replication is through 
infection of cells via the cell-to-cell connections called plasmodesmata, which 
connect the cells throughout a plant but are too small for even bacteria or 
other viruses to pass through. A viral protein, called a movement protein, can 
bind to the viral RNA and help it to enter adjacent cells where it can begin a 
new infection.

232
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
Viroids
Viroids are short RNA sequences <400 bases that lack capsid proteins. No 
viroids are known to infect animals or prokaryotes, but there are several in 
plants. They’re small and circular with secondary structure. Viroids enter 
plant cells after damage to the cell has compromised the integrity of the cell 
wall. They also move from cell to cell by the plasmodesmata.
	
How exactly the viroids cause disease is unknown. It’s suspected that they 
create small interfering RNA molecules (siRNA) to be made that interfere with 
the translation of normal plant mRNAs. The way this works is that the small 
RNAs bind to the plant mRNAs, creating a double-stranded RNA complex that 
is flagged for degradation by the plant cell machinery. Plants use this type of 
regulation, called small regulatory RNA (srRNA), on their genes under normal 
conditions. So, it may not be a coincidence that plants are the only ones to 
be infected by these types of pathogens. Specifically, the viroids could have 
evolved accidentally from plant srRNAs.

 Chapter 14: Examining the Vastness of Viruses
How Host Cells Fight Back
Both viruses and their hosts exert evolutionary pressure on one another, 
meaning that each of them is going to take advantage of mutations that will 
give it an edge over the other. Because of their small genomes, the mutation 
rate in viruses is much higher than it is in host cells, but the host has sophis-
ticated mechanisms to suppress viral replication. It’s always a struggle to 
stay ahead of viruses.
Restriction enzymes
Bacteria and archaea have a way to protect themselves from viral attack. 
They use enzymes to cut up any foreign double-stranded DNA that is found 
in the cell. This method is aimed at stopping bacteriophage genomes, which 
have been injected into the host cell, from being transcribed, thus beginning 
the infection cycle. These enzymes are called restriction enzymes, and they 
act to recognize a short sequence, called a recognition sequence, and then cut 
double-stranded DNA. The system is called the restriction system because it 
restricts viral replication.
	
These enzymes are actually called restriction endonucleases because the 
enzyme cuts within a DNA molecule, as opposed to removing bases from the 
ends of a linear DNA molecule the way an exonuclease would.
Recognition sequences, also called restriction sites, have a few important 
features:
	
✓	They’re short and range in size from around 4 to 8 bases. The shorter 
the sequence, the more likely it is to occur in a DNA molecule.
	
✓	They’re usually palindromes, meaning that they have the same sequence 
in the forward and the reverse direction.
	
✓	They’re present in the DNA of all organisms, not just viruses and bacteria.
	
✓	Modification of restriction sites in the bacterial DNA is necessary at the 
restriction sites to prevent cleavage of the host chromosome. By tagging 
host DNA with methyl molecules that stop the restriction enzyme from 
binding there — a process called methylation — host DNA is protected 
from cleavage.
A host organism sometimes has more than one restriction system, and there 
are thousands of different restriction enzymes, each named for the bacte-
rial species that it was first discovered in. After binding to their recognition 

234
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
site, restriction enzymes then cut both strands of the DNA in a predictable 
way (see Figure 14-9). This predictable cleavage of DNA makes restriction 
enzymes useful for molecular biology and biotechnology, a topic covered in 
Chapter 16.
	
Figure 14-9: 
Restriction

of a phage 
genome.
	
Viruses fight back by modifying their DNA by methylation and by glucosyl-
ation to protect it from bacterial restriction enzymes. Survival is a dirty war 
when it comes to bacteriophages. Many viruses encode their own restriction 
enzymes aimed at the host DNA, effectively removing competition for viral 
gene transcription and translation and stemming any inducible defense that 
the host could turn on.
CRISPR
Bacteria and archaea have another way to resist viruses that includes protec-
tion from not only double-stranded DNA viruses but also single-stranded DNA 
and RNA viruses. This method involves having short viral sequences in the 
bacterial genome that can be used to recognize and drive the destruction of 
matching viral sequences if they appear in the cell. This method, called the 
CRISPR system (pronounced “crisper”), is widespread in bacteria and archaea 
but is not yet completely understood.

235
 Chapter 14: Examining the Vastness of Viruses
What is known about CRISPR is that several viral sequences are present in an 
organism’s genome separated by short sequences that are identical to each 
other (so they’re called repeated sequences, or repeats) and are palindromic.
The nature of these intergenic (between genes) sequences gave the system 
its name — clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
(CRISPR) — mostly because the short repeats were found in many bacterial 
genomes long before the sequences in between were recognized as viral.
The way that these viral genes protect bacterial and archaeal cells from viral 
attack is explained in Figure 14-10.
	
Figure 14-10: 
CRISPR 
antiviral 
protection.
	
First, the entire CRISPR region of the bacterial genome is transcribed. Then 
the repeat regions are cut so that a piece of RNA is present from each individ-
ual viral gene. These pieces are able to bind to viral DNA or RNA, which acts 
as the signal for the cleavage of the viral genome to begin. Cleavage of both 
the CRISPR RNA and eventually the offending viral genome is done by a group 
of proteins called Cas proteins.

236
Part IV: Meeting the Microbes 
	
Viruses are essentially transmissible genetic elements — the viral genes (genetic 
elements) move from cell to cell (transmissible). Another type of transmis-
sible genetic element in bacteria is plasmid DNA, which is another target of the 
CRISPR system. Short sequences matching plasmids are often found in the rec-
ognition region of the CRISPR system, making them targets for cleavage by the 
CASCADE system.
Viruses fight back either by altering the sequence that corresponds to the 
CRISPR encoded version or by deleting the genes all together. This way, tran-
scribed sequences for the CRISPR system either can’t bind their target prop-
erly or have nothing to bind to.
Interfering with RNA viruses: RNAi
Eukaryotic organisms don’t have a CRISPR system, but they do use some-
thing with a similar premise: short RNA sequences that direct enzymes to cut 
up other molecules of RNA in the cell, presumably of viral origin. RNA inter-
ference (RNAi) is a system to deal with double-stranded RNA that it detects 
floating around in its cytoplasm.
	
Double-stranded RNA is uniquely viral because cells only ever have double-
stranded DNA or single-stranded RNA.
When a double-stranded RNA molecule is detected in the cell the enzyme 
Dicer cuts it up into pieces around 21 to 23 bp in length. The small fragments 
that result, called short interfering RNA (siRNA), are bound by RNA-induced 
silencing complex (RISC).
RISC splits the two RNA strands and uses each as a way of finding other 
single-stranded RNA molecules in the cell, which could be viral mRNA being 
made by the host cell machinery. These single-stranded RNA molecules are 
cleaved by an enzyme called Slicer, effectively halting viral replication. The 
siRNA mentioned earlier can move from cell to cell, conferring on the cells 
resistance to the virus. In plants, the response doesn’t end there — plants 
have an enzyme to copy the siRNAs, enabling them to be spread throughout 
the tissues through the plasmodesmata (see Figure 14-8), hence protecting 
the entire individual.
Viruses can fight back in a number of ways:
	
✓	By making decoy RNAs that bind up all the Dicer-RISC complexes
	
✓	By replicating inside of compartments in the cell that aren’t accessible by 
the RNAi machinery
	
✓	By making proteins that inhibit Dicer function

he intersection of microorganisms and the human body usually only inter-
ests people when they get sick, but the processes that go on between the 
body and microbes is pretty fascinating. In this chapter, we describe the ways 
that the body recognizes which microbes to keep out and, failing that, how it 
deals with an infection.
In Chapter 17, we go on to talk about the ways that we as a society try to pro-
tect ourselves from microbial diseases, but here we talk, for the most part, 
about what processes are going on in the body and at the level of the cell. 
Antibiotics and the repercussions of their use are an important part of the 
human health saga.

Clarifying the Host Immune Response
Pathogens are microorganisms that are harmful to our health. They invade 
the body and cause infections that can result in various symptoms, from a 
fever and cough, to diarrhea and vomiting. Immunity is the ability to resist 
infections; it involves several layers of protection to keep pathogens out.

240
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
The first layer of protection is broad antimicrobial strategies that fend off 
intruding pathogens. If the pathogen is able to bypass these barriers, the 
pathogen next encounters the branch of the immune response called innate 
immunity. Innate immune cells are the first responders to an infection and 
work to kill off the pathogen. These cells also send out signals to recruit the 
second branch of the immune response, called adaptive immunity. Adaptive 
immune cells are specialized for clearing certain pathogens; they learn from 
experience so that they’re better prepared the next time an infection occurs.
The immune system involves many cell types, tissues, and organs, all of 
which work together to deal with the diversity of pathogens the immune 
system encounters, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.
In this section, we cover all these elements of the immune response in greater 
detail.
Putting up barriers to infection
Regions of the body that come in direct contact with the environment are the 
ones most frequently exposed to pathogens. Here are the various parts of the 
body that are on constant guard to prevent pathogens from getting in:
	
✓	Skin: The skin is a thick layer of cells that routinely sheds to eliminate 
microorganisms on the skin. Oil glands secrete oily fats that are antimi-
crobial and lower the pH of skin to discourage microbial growth.
	
✓	Secretions: Earwax, saliva, tears, and perspiration contain antimicrobial 
factors including a low pH and enzymes such as lysozyme that damage 
microorganisms.
	
✓	Stomach: The stomach produces a highly acidic gastric juice that is 
strong enough to kill microorganisms and their toxins.
	
✓	Respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts: The respiratory 
tract, the gastrointestinal tract, and the urogenital tract are lined with 
mucous membranes that secrete a thick dense layer of mucous to trap 
microorganisms.
	
✓	Microbes on and in your body: The normal microbiota is the collection 
of microorganisms that live on your body and inside of places like your 
gut. They have an important role in competing with pathogens and pre-
venting them from causing an infection.

241
 Chapter 15: Understanding Microbes in Human Health and Disease
Raising a red flag with inflammation
If a pathogen gets past the initial barriers and gains entry into the body, it 
starts to infect cells and injure tissue. The damaged tissue sends out chemical 
alarms that cause an immediate, local inflammatory response. The inflam-
matory response is what causes a cut to turn red and swell up. Inflammation 
helps to move immune cells from the blood to the injured tissue to prevent an 
infection.
The inflammatory response is important during the early stages of an infec-
tion to warn the immune system that something bad is happening. However, 
when immune cells are recruited, it’s important that the inflammatory 
response is dampened to prevent an overreaction to injury. Inflammation that 
remains ongoing can cause further tissue damage and prevent repair. Chronic 
(continuous) inflammation contributes to autoimmune diseases (such as 
rheumatoid arthritis) and infectious diseases (such as tuberculosis).
	
In the case of inflammation, too much of a good thing can be bad for the body. 
The inflammatory response must die down in order to allow repair of tissue 
following an infection.
Holding down the fort with 
innate immunity
Innate immune cells are the first cells of the immune system to contact 
­pathogens and rapidly respond to initiate the clearance of infection. They’re 
able to respond to a broad number of pathogens because they recognize 
features common to many microorganisms. These features are called pathogen-
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and they include carbohydrates, 
proteins, DNA, or lipids only found on microorganisms.
Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are surface-bound proteins on innate 
immune cells that detect PAMPs and indicate the presence of an infection. An 
important class of PRRs includes the toll-like receptors (TLRs), each of which 
detects a certain class of PAMPs. The binding of a PAMP to a TLR calls the 
innate immune cell to action and initiates a response that aims to eliminate 
the pathogen (see Figure 15-1).

242
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes

immune 
system that

Most innate immune cells share a common mechanism of pathogen killing 
called phagocytosis. During phagocytosis, the cell takes up the pathogen and 
traps it within the phagosome, a specialized organelle that releases highly 
toxic substances that destroy the pathogen. Here are some phagocytic 
immune cells:
	
✓	Macrophages are “big eaters” and scavenge the environment for unwanted 
material. They reside is mostly every tissue in the body and ingest and kill 
pathogens.
	
✓	Dendritic cells are also found in many tissues and help remove patho-
gens. They play an important role in starting an adaptive immune 
response to an infection.
	
✓	Neutrophils circulate in the blood and are called to tissues when there’s 
an infection.
Nonphagocytic innate immune cells are important for other branches of the 
immune response. Mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils release substances 
out of the cell to promote immune activation during allergic responses or 
parasitic infections. Natural killer (NK) cells destroy infected cells, as well as 
cancerous cells in tumors.

243
 Chapter 15: Understanding Microbes in Human Health and Disease
Sending out the troops for 
adaptive immunity
Several key features differentiate the adaptive immune system from the 
innate immune system:
	
✓	Ability to respond to specific microbial components called antigens
	
✓	Tolerance, or the inability to respond to molecules normally found in the 
body
	
✓	Memory of infection so that the response to reinfection is faster and 
more effective
Adaptive immune cells respond to antigens (antibody generators), which are 
molecules such as proteins, sugars, or lipids found in the pathogen. Each cell 
of the adaptive immune response expresses a unique surface receptor that 
is able to recognize a specific antigen. The immune system carefully chooses 
between the T cell or B cell receptor it expresses so that it responds only 
to microbial antigens and not to proteins, sugars, or lipids commonly found 
in the body. When a receptor binds to an antigen, it triggers the adaptive 
immune cells (like T cells, see “The tenacious T cell” section) to divide into a 
larger population and join the fight against the intruding pathogen. The popu-
lation of adaptive immune cells (B cells, see “The beneficial B cell” section) 
that is activated during infection remains in the body as memory cells so that 
next time the same pathogen is encountered, the immune system responds 
more rapidly see Figure 15-2.
Different adaptive immune cells use different mechanisms to combat infection.
	
Figure 15-2: 
Activation of 
T cells and 
B cells.
	

244
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
The tenacious T cell
The receptor present on T cells is called the T cell receptor (TCR). The TCR 
is able to recognize antigens only when they’re nested within a molecule 
called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). When macrophages or 
dendritic cells phagocytose and destroy a pathogen, they load its chewed-up 
bits into the MHC molecule and display it on its surface to show to cells of 
the ­adaptive immune system. If a TCR is able to recognize the antigen shown, 
the T cell is recruited to fight. Different types of T cells help clear infections 
in different ways.
Cytotoxic T cells (TC) are designed to hunt and kill infected cells. When they 
find their target cell, they release damaging molecules that trigger cell death, 
preventing the spread of an infection.
T helper cells (TH) encourage recruitment and activation of other immune 
cells. During an infection, TH cells help macrophages kill microbes they have 
taken up, activate B cells to produce antibodies, and recruit immune cells, 
like neutrophils to do damage control.
The beneficial B cell
The B cell receptor (BCR) is different from a TCR in that it doesn’t require 
an antigen to be presented in an MHC molecule. Instead, the BCR is able to 
directly bind to an antigen on a microbe. If the BCR finds its antigen, the B cell 
begins to divide and ramps up production of a secreted version of its BCR. 
The secreted molecules are called antibodies and help to target microbes for 
phagocytosis or offset the damaging effects of microbial toxins.
	
The interaction between a receptor on an adaptive immune cell and an antigen 
is like a lock and key. If a receptor doesn’t encounter the right type of antigen, 
it does not trigger a response.
Antibodies in action
Antibodies secreted by B cells are also called immunoglobulins, or Ig ­molecules. 
They bind and coat pathogens to target them for killing in a process called 
opsonization. Opsonization of pathogens like bacteria encourages the immune 
system to kill them in two ways:
	
✓	Macrophages and neutrophils have special receptors on their surface 
that recognize antibodies. If they come across a microbe coated in 
­antibodies, they phagocytose it.
	
✓	The complement cascade is a series of proteins that assemble on the 
­surface of a microbe when antibodies are present. Altogether, they form 
a hole on the microbe’s surface and cause cell death.

245
 Chapter 15: Understanding Microbes in Human Health and Disease
Ig molecules are typically Y-shaped, with two identical arms that can bind to 
antigens (see Figure 15-3). Some antibodies have two Y-shaped Ig molecules 
but most have only one.
	
Figure 15-3: 
The struc-
ture of 
antibodies.
	
B cells are able to produce five different classes of antibodies, each of which 
serves a different function in the immune response (see Table 15-1).

Interpreting natural immunity and immunizations
It can take up to two weeks for B cells to pro-
duce antibodies the first time they respond to 
an antigen. However, these B cells remain in 
the body after an infection is cleared, and if they 
encounter the same antigen at a later time, anti-
body production occurs much more quickly (see 
the figure). This results in natural immunity, or the 
ability to eliminate infection much faster upon re-
exposure. Natural immunity can last for several 
years to a lifetime, depending on the pathogen.
Newborn babies are highly susceptible to infec-
tions because their immune systems are not 
fully developed. Mothers transfer antibodies to 
babies in two ways to provide passive natural 
immunity.
	✓	Antibodies of the IgG class cross the pla-
cental barrier and provide protection during 
and after pregnancy.
	✓	Antibodies of the IgA class are present 
in breast milk, which newborns consume 
shortly after birth.
Passively transferred antibodies provide pro-
tection for only several weeks to months.
The specificity of antibodies for a pathogen and 
the speedy response the second time around 
is the basis of immunization. Vaccines deliver 
harmless antigens to the body in a controlled 
setting and prime B cells to produce antibod-
ies. If the individual becomes infected with 
the pathogen they’re vaccinated against, the 
immune system is prepared to stop infection 
early in its tracks.
Currently, close to 30 vaccines are available 
that protect against various infectious diseases, 
such as influenza, rabies, and meningococcal 
disease. Vaccines have eliminated many viral 
and bacterial infections (reduced the number 
of cases to near zero), and in the case of small-
pox, have completely eradicated infections (no 
existing cases), saving many lives.

 Chapter 15: Understanding Microbes in Human Health and Disease
Relying on Antimicrobials 
for Treating Disease
Getting a bacterial infection is likely not a major worry for you. At the first 
signs of an infection, you head to the doctor to get a prescription of antibiot-
ics and take them until the infection goes away.
It was a very different picture, however, just 80 years ago. People of every age 
died from untreatable bacterial infections. Antibiotics are a relatively modern 
advancement, one that has increased life expectancy and saved many lives. 
The use of one of the first antibiotics, penicillin, had such a significant impact 
on society that the scientists who discovered it were awarded the Nobel Prize.
Although we’ve come a long way in developing antibiotics to treat all kinds of 
bacterial infections, it’s unfortunately not a battle that medicine has yet won. 
Drugs that once worked for treating infections are no longer effective because 
pathogens have developed antibiotic resistance (which involves changes in 
the genes of a pathogen such that the pathogen is no longer susceptible to 
the drug’s action).
Pathogens are resistant to nearly every antibiotic developed to date. The 
current picture of antibiotic resistance worldwide is so grim that the World 
Health Organization (WHO) recently declared it a global health threat. There 
is an urgent need for more effective antibiotics in order to combat bacterial 
infections to prevent entry into what we fear will be a post-antibiotic era.
In this section, we fill you in on how antibiotics work and what they’re used 
to treat.
Fundamental features of antibiotics
Antibiotics are a broad class of chemical compounds that are categorized 
based on some general properties. Some of these properties help doctors 
decide which antibiotic to use to treat an infection:
	
✓	Spectrum: The spectrum of activity describes, essentially, how many dif-
ferent types of bacteria a drug can kill. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are 
able to kill only a select type of bacteria. For example, penicillin is effec-
tive at killing Gram-positive bacteria, but not Gram-negative bacteria. 
In contrast, broad-spectrum antibiotics are active against many types of 
bacteria, such as chloramphenicol, which is active against both Gram-
positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

248
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
	
✓	How they work: Not all antibiotics kill bacteria on the spot. Bacteriostatic 
antibiotics inhibit the growth of bacteria and make it easier for the immune 
system to control infection. Bactericidal antibiotics are more potent and 
directly kill the targeted pathogen. Sometimes two bacteriastatic drugs 
can be combined to have a bacteriacidal effect, this is called combina-
tion therapy.
	
✓	Where they’re made: Some antibiotics are isolated from environmental 
microbes, while others are made in a lab. Antibiotics produced by micro-
organisms are referred to as natural antibiotics, whereas antibiotics 
made in a lab are referred to as artificial or synthetic antibiotics.
	
	Whether antibiotics come from a natural source or are artificial has no 
impact on their effectiveness at killing microbes.
At the forefront of the field
Several key scientists made important contribu-
tions to the field of microbiology leading up to 
the development of antibiotics.
	✓	In the early 1900s, Paul Ehrlich put forward 
the idea that in order to stop bacterial infec-
tions, a “magic bullet” was needed that 
would target and destroy a pathogen with-
out harming the host. Following this theory, 
Ehrlich discovered the first antimicrobial 
agents, including Salvarsan, a drug used 
to treat syphilis infections in 1910. Ehrlich’s 
“magic bullet” concept is now known as 
selective toxicity and is still important for 
drug discovery.
	✓	In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming acciden-
tally discovered that a fungus, Penicillium 
notatum, inhibited the growth of the human 
pathogen, S. aureus. Scientists Howard 
Florey and Ernst Chain isolated the com-
pound produced by the fungus, now known 
as penicillin, and found that it saved mice 
from infections with staphylococci and 
streptococci. Penicillin was first used as 
an antibiotic in 1940 and saved the lives of 
many soldiers during World War II.
	✓	Gerhard Domagk researched the antimi-
crobial properties of a red dye and found 
that, although the red dye did not inhibit 
bacterial growth on a Petri dish, it was very 
effective at treating infected animals. His 
work uncovered that the body turns cer-
tain compounds into highly potent antimi-
crobials, and forged the way for the use of 
live animals for drug discovery. Domagk’s 
work also led to the development of an 
entire class of antimicrobials called sulfa 
drugs.
	✓	Selman Waksman recognized the idea 
that microorganisms themselves, such as 
the mold on Fleming’s Petri dish, produce 
compounds with antibacterial properties. 
Waksman screened thousands of soil bac-
teria and fungi for their ability to inhibit the 
growth of pathogens. In 1944, his efforts 
led to the isolation of streptomycin from 
the Streptomyces bacteria, which resulted 
in a drug used to treat tuberculosis. Even 
today, environmental microorganisms 
are screened in hope of finding new 
antibiotics.
These discoveries had such an impact on soci-
ety that they were recognized with the Nobel 
Prize. Fleming, Florey, and Chain received the 
Nobel Prize for their contributions to the discov-
ery of penicillin in 1945. Waksman received the 
Nobel Prize in 1952.

249
 Chapter 15: Understanding Microbes in Human Health and Disease
Antibiotics that target pathways unique to bacteria are great because they’re 
unlikely to produce side effects in humans. Some antibiotics, however, affect 
human cells and can be harmful, especially if used in high doses. Individuals can 
develop a sensitivity and may have an allergic reaction to an antibiotic cannot 
be treated with it. This is the case for individuals with penicillin sensitivity.
	
Don’t confuse sensitivity to an antibiotic with susceptibility to an antibiotic. 
A person may be sensitive to an antibiotic (have an allergic reaction to it), 
whereas a microbe may be susceptible to the action of an antibiotic.
Targets of destruction
Antibiotics target several types of structures or pathways in bacterial cells 
that are absolutely necessary for survival (see Figure 15-4). Some of these 
­targets are structures that are unique to bacterial cells, such as the peptido-
glycan cell wall. Other antibiotics target pathways important in both bacterial 
and human cells but take advantage of slight differences in the structure of 
enzymes, making them more selective for bacteria. This section describes the 
cellular targets of antibiotics and the groups of antibiotics that target them.
	
Figure 15-4: 
Cellular 
targets of 
antibiotics.
	

250
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
The cell wall is the target of several antibiotics. Antibiotics such as penicil-
lins, cephalosporins, bacitracin, cycloserine, and vancomycin inhibit bacte-
rial cell wall synthesis by interfering either with the synthesis or with the 
crosslinking of the subunits of peptidoglycan. Antibiotics like gramicidin and 
polymixin poke holes in the cell membrane causing bacterial cells to become 
leaky and die. This second type of antibiotic is used infrequently, however, 
because they also act against animal cells because they also have a cell 
membrane.
Antibiotics that target nucleic acid synthesis include
	
✓	Quinolones block bacterial DNA synthesis.
	
✓	Metronidazole is taken up by bacterial cells and randomly nicks the 
DNA, causing destruction of the bacterial genome.
	
✓	Rifampicin blocks the RNA polymerase enzyme needed for RNA synthesis.
	
✓	Sulfa drugs block the synthesis of folate, an essential component in the 
synthesis of RNA. Because mammals get all their folate from their food, 
these drugs are specific against bacteria.
Bacterial protein synthesis is a major target of antibiotics, all of which bind 
to various parts of the bacterial ribosome and interfere with translation of 
mRNA. Examples of drugs that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis include 
aminoglycosides (neomycin, gentamycin and kanamycin), tetracyclines, mac-
rolides, lincosamides, and chloramphenicol.
Unraveling microbial drug resistance
Antibiotics are one of the major scientific advances in the past century that 
have undoubtedly improved the quality of life, yet the battle against infec-
tious diseases has yet to be won. Bacteria are remarkably capable of evolving 
by altering their genetic code to make them less susceptible to the antimicro-
bial effects of antibiotics.
What does resistance look like?
Some bacteria acquire mutations that alter the target of an antibiotic 
enough that the antibiotic can no longer bind to its bacterial target. For 
example, some strains of Staphylococcus aureus are resistant to methicillin, a 
β-lactam antibiotic, which interferes with enzymes involved in peptidoglycan 

251
 Chapter 15: Understanding Microbes in Human Health and Disease
synthesis. To be methicillin-resistant, S. aureus must carry the mec gene, 
which allows the cell to continue making peptidoglycan as usual and not be 
affected by the antibiotic.
Bacteria use efflux pumps (membrane-bound proteins that work to pump 
things out of the cell) to get rid of unwanted waste and toxins. Pathogens 
make use of efflux pumps to pump out antibiotics (see Figure 15-5). Efflux 
pumps are not very selective for the substrates they expel — they’re able 
to pump out many different drugs. Multi-drug efflux pumps are present in 
Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and S. aureus. These strains often 
have mutations that lead to increased expression of efflux pumps to pump 
antibiotics out of the cell right away before they exert their toxic effects.
The structure of an antibiotic is very important for its target specificity and 
antimicrobial activity. Some bacteria carry enzymes that chemically modify 
antibiotics to render them inactive. Another mechanism of drug inactiva-
tion includes degradation. The most well-known example is the β-lactamase 
enzyme. This enzyme cleaves the β-lactam ring in penicillin to prevent it from 
interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis.

Where does it come from?
Emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is inevitable once an antibiotic is 
used to treat infection because bacteria that can resist the antibiotic have a 
greater chance of survival. Many bacteria are actually the producers of anti-
biotics and, therefore, must themselves be able to resist the toxic molecule 
they produce. These protective genes for some bacteria then move to patho-
genic bacteria and make them resistant to the antibiotics. Initially, the rate of 
resistance is low, but with increased use of antibiotics, resistance becomes 
widespread.
Some bacteria are naturally resistant to antibiotics, meaning that the cells are 
innately unaffected by the drug. For example, some antibiotics like vancomy-
cin are ineffective at treating Gram-negative bacterial infections because the 
drug isn’t able to penetrate the outer membrane.
Other bacteria acquire antibiotic resistance either through mutation of exist-
ing genetic material or acquisition of new genetic material. Example of this 
include
	
✓	Spontaneous mutations can confer resistance to a drug, usually by 
changing the target to prevent binding of the drug. Such mutations are 
passed on directly to bacterial cell progeny during division in a process 
referred to as vertical gene transfer. Spontaneous mutations are not a 
major source of resistance because they’re infrequent events and could 
have negative consequences on target gene function.
	
✓	Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a more prominent mechanism of 
acquiring antibiotic resistance. HGT involves the exchange of genetic 
information between bacteria. Mechanisms of HGT include conjuga-
tion, transformation, or transduction (see Chapter 8 for more detail). 
Resistance genes can be found on plasmids, referred to as R (resistance) 
plasmids; R plasmids exist separately from the chromosome or on 
mobile genetic elements, such as transposons.
Antibiotics can come from natural sources, such as soil bacteria or fungus, so 
some pathogens are exposed to antibiotics long before we use them to treat 
infections. Scientists suspect that nowadays bacteria experience increased 
exposure due to the inappropriate use of antibiotic treatment and overuse of 
antibiotics in the farming industry.

Discovering new antibiotics
Most antibiotics used today were discovered in the “golden age” of antibiotic 
discovery, from the 1940s through the 1960s. In the decades since, the “anti-
biotic pipeline” has run relatively dry and no new classes of broad-spectrum 
antibiotics have been developed despite an urgent need.
Drug discovery faces a variety of challenges, including the following:
	
✓	Lack of new target discovery: A few new bacterial targets, to which anti-
biotics act, have been recently discovered.
	
✓	Discovery of drugs with only a narrow spectrum: Discovering drugs 
to target Gram-negative bacteria is particularly difficult because of their 
outer membrane.
	
✓	Rapid development of resistance: Bacteria rapidly become resistant to 
antibiotics as these drugs are used more frequently. Because antibiotic 
therapy is short-term treatment, it doesn’t bring in as much money for 
pharmaceutical companies as drugs that people have to be on long term 
(or even for life). For this reason, pharmaceutical companies aren’t as 
eager to invest a lot of money in discovering new antibiotics.
	
✓	Risk of toxicity: As the safe drugs have been used up (meaning that 
more people have resistant infections and the antibiotics are useless 
against them), antibiotics that are more toxic to people are being used. 
Newer drugs are often more toxic to people because the antibiotics 
designed against the known bacterial targets have already been made.
With these challenges in mind, there are several approaches to antibiotic dis-
covery today:
	
✓	Generation of synthetic antibiotics: This approach is attractive because 
the structure of the drug can be created to optimize crossing of the mem-
brane and binding to the target protein. This approach involves rational 
drug design, in which a target gene (ideally one that is essential for bacte-
rial growth) is selected to target and inhibit. Structural models are used 
to predict drug-target binding to optimize drug design.
	
✓	High-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical compound libraries 
containing thousands of synthetic and natural compounds: The com-
pounds are screened in automated processes for their ability to inhibit 
bacterial growth. In contrast to rational drug design, HTS can result in 
identification of novel targets to inhibit.

254
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
Searching Out Superbugs
Antibiotics are of bacterial origin. They’re part of the arsenal of bacterial 
chemical warfare against one another. So, it’s no surprise that antibiotic resis-
tance genes are common among bacteria, too. When antibiotics are used, they 
affect all the bacteria that are sensitive to the antibiotic. When a member of 
the bacterial community is resistant to the antibiotic used, it’s given an oppor-
tunity to flourish. Superbugs are the result of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that 
been allowed to flourish and have become a problem for human health.
Different superbugs are a problem for one of these reasons:
	
✓	They cause disease and are resistant to the drugs we usually use to treat 
them
	
✓	They’re usually harmless microbes that are now impossible to treat if 
they do cause an infection (for instance, in someone with a compro-
mised or weak immune system).
	
✓	They’re resistant to several antibiotics.
The downside of antibiotics
In recent years, scientists have learned a lot 
more about the human microbiome, the col-
lection of bacteria that normally colonizes 
our bodies. Antibiotics can’t distinguish these 
“good” bacteria from pathogens (disease-
causing bacteria), so antibiotics can end up 
altering the microbiome, which may have impli-
cations for a person’s health.
Children are the most common age group to be 
prescribed antibiotics. Exposure to antibiotics 
in early life may affect immune system devel-
opment and increase susceptibility to allergic 
and metabolic diseases later in life. In order to 
minimize the effects on the microbiome, devel-
opment of antibiotics that are specific to patho-
gens is an active area of research.
Alternatives to traditional antibiotics to treat 
bacterial infections include the following:
	✓	Targeting genes that are not necessarily 
required for growth, but contribute to the 
ability of a pathogen to cause infection: 
Targeting such a factor may enable the host 
immune response to control infection more 
efficiently.
	✓	Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are pro-
duced by the innate immune system and 
are broadly active against many bacteria: 
A boost of AMPs during infection could pro-
mote clearance of a pathogen.
	✓	Phage therapy: This involves the use of 
phage (viruses that infect and destroy 
specific populations of bacteria) to target 
infections. Progress has been made in this 
field, but challenges in logistics still require 
attention.

 Chapter 15: Understanding Microbes in Human Health and Disease
Staying ahead of vancomycin-resistant 
enterococci
Enterococci are Gram-positive bacteria that normally colonize the gut and 
the female genital tract of healthy people and are generally not harmful, but 
hospital patients undergoing surgery or with open wounds are highly suscep-
tible to enterococcal infections. The most common type of infection is the 
urinary tract infection; others include bacteremia, endocarditis, and intra-
abdominal infections.
Infections spread directly from patient to patient, indirectly on the hands of 
healthcare workers, or on contaminated surfaces or equipment. The many 
sources of transmission and the many people at risk in a hospital make the 
enterococci a major cause of hospital-associated infections.
Enterococcal infections can be difficult to treat because strains are often 
antibiotic resistant. Enterococci are naturally resistant to β-lactams, ami-
noglycosides (low levels), macrolides, and sulfa drugs. The emergence of 
vancomycin-­resistance enterococci (VRE) has had a major impact on the 
treatment of infections, leaving doctors with limited options.
An added threat of VRE is the possibility that the resistant genes could be 
passed to other pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus. In 2002, a doctor 
reported the first case of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
strain that was also vancomycin resistant and carried the VRE resistance 
genes. Fortunately, only 13 additional cases have since been reported to date. 
(See the next section for more on MRSA.)
Battling methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus
Staphylococcus aureus is a prominent human pathogen capable of infecting 
nearly every site in the body and producing infections that range from mild to 
life threatening. Stopping S. aureus infections is difficult because it has a his-
tory of rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics. Penicillin-resistant strains 
emerged in 1944, just four years after the drug was introduced to market, and 
in the 1960s methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) appeared. Over the last 60 
years, MRSA has spread to cause epidemics globally.
Initially, MRSA infections were primarily a problem in hospital patients under-
going surgery or with open wounds. Outbreaks of MRSA in hospitals were 
reported throughout the 1970s and 1980s (see Figure 15-6).

256
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
	
Figure 15-6: 
The rise 
and fall of 
antibiot-
ics to treat 
Staphy­
loccous 
aureus.
	
In the late 1990s, MRSA spread out of hospitals and into communities. 
Community-associated (CA) MRSA affects healthy individuals with no 
known risk factors of infection, and commonly causes outbreaks in athletes, 
recreational facilities, prisons, and daycare centers. CA-MRSA primarily 
causes skin infections that are typically red, swollen, painful, and pus filled. 
Treatment of infections involves drainage of pus or, if more serious, use of 
antibiotics. If left untreated, the infection can spread to other body parts and 
cause a more severe infection.
CA-MRSA is spread by direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contami-
nated objects. If you come into contact with CA-MRSA, you can spread it to 
other ­individuals if you don’t wash your hands properly, or can infect your-
self through an open wound.
The antibiotic vancomycin is used as the alternative to methicillin to treat 
MRSA. Although it was discovered before methicillin, vancomycin was not 
widely used because of its toxicity to human cells. With the rise of MRSA 
and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the use of vancomycin has increased 
by 100 times in the last 30 years and, not surprisingly, has led to the rise of 
vancomycin-tolerant (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant (VRSA) Staphylococcus 
aureus. With the loss of vancomycin to treat Staph aureus infections, ­treatment 
options for this nasty bacterium are slim indeed.

257
 Chapter 15: Understanding Microbes in Human Health and Disease
Outcompeting Clostridium difficile
Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of diarrheal infections in hos-
pitals and long-term care facilities. Infections most often occur in the elderly 
or in a hospital setting when a patient is on continuous antibiotic treatment. 
Antibiotics can disturb the normal gut bacteria. Then C. difficile endospores 
can germinate and take advantage of the absence of other bacteria to grows 
rapidly.
The symptoms of a C. difficile infection include diarrhea, nausea, fever, and 
abdominal pain and can range from a mild form of infection to serious and 
possibly fatal cases. Mild cases don’t require treatment, whereas more seri-
ous infections require medication or surgery. Recently, more harmful strains 
have emerged and have caused serious outbreaks in hospitals resulting in 
death of up to 20 percent of infected patients.
Because they are so hardy, C. difficile endospores can survive on surfaces 
and equipment in hospitals and can resist common disinfectants. This makes 
it difficult for hospitals to get rid of C. difficile. The spores spread from the 
feces of individuals who carry C. difficile in their gut. Hospitals enforce hand 
washing to prevent transfer of spores; in some cases, they use specialized 
machines that sterilize a room after a patient has had a C. difficile infection.
Often after a patient gets a C. difficile infection, that person is more likely to 
get another one in the future. The cause of recurrent infections is not clear, 
and without knowing the cause, it’s difficult to find a cure. One treatment 
gaining appreciation is fecal transplants (literally, the transfer of stool from 
one individual to another). Although the idea isn’t the most appealing, the 
results are too good to ignore — it boasts a 95 percent success rate over the 
approximately 50 years of its use.
Pressure from extended-spectrum 
beta-lactamases
New Delhi metallo-β-Lactamase (NDM-1) is a recently described broad-
spectrum β-lactamase enzyme that inactivates all β-lactam antibiotics except 
aztreonam. It belongs to a group of acquired β-lactamases, called carbapen-
emases. Gram-negative bacteria carrying carbapenemases have gradually 
increased over the years yet remain a relatively rare cause of human infec-
tions. The rapid emergence of infections caused by bacteria carrying NDM-1 
in several countries has raised global alarm.

258
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
	
NDM-1 is encoded on a conjugative plasmid in isolates of primarily Escherichia 
coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as other Enterobacteriaceae species. The 
spread of NDM-1 across many unrelated bacteria is not common to resistance 
mechanisms and is another reason for raising concern. NDM-1 isolates cause 
a range of infections, including urinary tract infections, diarrhea, septicemia, 
pulmonary infections, and soft tissue infections. The infecting organisms are 
usually highly multidrug resistant, leaving few if any treatment options.
Most people acquire an infection with NDM-1 producing bacteria in a hospi-
tal setting. Currently, it appears that individuals who received medical care 
in India or Pakistan are most at risk of infection. With the amount of global 
travel in today’s society, NDM-1 producing bacteria are a threat worldwide. 
Some hospitals have begun to screen patients carrying bacteria with the 
NDM-1 gene to detect sources of infection early and prevent spread. New 
antibiotics to target multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria are urgently 
needed to treat infections.
Knowing the Benefits of Prebiotics 
and Probiotics
Probiotics are live microorganisms with claimed health benefits when con-
sumed in adequate amounts. They’re components of fermentation products 
(such as yogurt) or packaged in a supplement form. Once consumed, probiot-
ics colonize the gut for a brief period of time and exert their beneficial effect.
Prebiotics are nondigestible nutrients that are used as an energy source by 
beneficial bacteria normally found in the body. They stimulate the growth of 
these bacteria to promote a healthy gut microbial population.
Probiotic bacteria are thought to provide benefits to human health in three 
ways:
	
✓	Protecting against intrusion of pathogens
	
✓	Enhancing gut function to promote antimicrobial defense
	
✓	Altering immune cell populations and their function to strengthen 
­nonspecific immunity against pathogens
Probiotic bacteria can prevent entry of pathogenic bacteria in the gut by 
competing for nutrients and surface colonization. They also secrete metabo-
lites that inactivate toxins or are antimicrobial against other bacteria, called 
bacteriocins.

259
 Chapter 15: Understanding Microbes in Human Health and Disease
	
Cell surface components of probiotics act similarly to the PAMPs discussed 
earlier in this chapter — they bind to surface receptors on immune cells to 
induce an immune response. Yet in contrast to PAMPs, which induce an inflam-
matory response, probiotic microbial associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) 
can induce an anti-inflammatory response, as well as other beneficial changes 
in intestinal cells such as an increase in the mucous production. This anti-
inflammatory response is thought to limit the amount of inflammation in the 
gut and is referred to as immunomodulation. It may help restore a healthy gut 
in people with weak immune systems, but whether this provides beneficial 
effects in healthy people isn’t clear from the studies on probiotics.
With the increasing negativity surrounding antibiotic use, including their asso-
ciation with the development of antibiotic resistance, and possible long-term 
health effects due to disturbance of normal gut bacteria, probiotics are becom-
ing appealing therapeutics. They’re currently used to prevent antibiotic-­
associated diarrhea and acute infectious diarrhea in adults. They’re also used 
to successfully treat necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a devastating infection of 
preterm or sick infants where tissue damage kills parts of the bowel.
Attacking Viruses with Antiviral Drugs
The infectious cycle of a virus involves the hijacking of a host cell and use of 
its machinery to replicate and produce progeny virus. Development of antivi-
rals was initially a daunting task since the stages of viral replication depend 
on host cell machinery, making it difficult to develop selective drugs. Luckily, 
virologists discovered virus-specific pathways leading to the development of 
successful antiviral therapeutics.
In general, antivirals can target several steps of infection:
	
✓	Viral entry: The viral particle enters the host cell.
	
✓	Virus particle uncoating: An enveloped virus fuses with the host cell 
membrane, allowing entry of the viral capsid (containing the viral genes) 
into the host cell.
	
✓	Nucleic acid synthesis: After viral infection, the host cell machinery is 
hijacked to make copies of the viral genome by synthesizing viral nucleic 
acids.
	
✓	Viral particle production: After the host cell machinery is finished 
making viral genomes, it makes viral proteins and then assembles viral 
particles from the proteins and the genomes.

260
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
Most antivirals are specific to the type of virus they inhibit because not all 
pathways targeted are common to all types of viruses. Many antivirals target 
influenza and HIV. The development of anti-HIV drugs has been critical to the 
management of HIV infections and consequently AIDS. Currently no vaccine 
exists for HIV; anti-retroviral drugs, like AZT, have significantly improved the 
life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals.
Retroviruses use a special viral protein called reverse transcriptase to copy 
their RNA genome into DNA after they’ve entered the host cell. Drugs like 
azidothymidine (AZT) are nucleoside analogues. Nucleosides are the build-
ing blocks of nucleic acids and because AZT looks like a nucleoside (that’s 
the analogue part), AZT works by taking the place of nucleotides as they are 
incorporated into the growing DNA molecule during reverse transcription. 
But because they’re shaped slightly differently than the cellular nucleosides, 
they act to terminate the reaction (see Figure 15-7).

icrobial biotechnology is the manipulation of a microorganism so it can 
be used for a commercial purpose. Altering the genetics of a micro­
organism by inserting or deleting genes is called genetic manipulation, and the 
result is called a genetically engineered or genetically modified micro­organism. 
Many decades of research have gone into developing the tools needed to be 
able to manipulate DNA, and the results of this hard work are a set of tools 
collectively referred to as recombinant DNA technology. The reason this is 
important to a book about microbiology is that many of the tools used for 
recombinant DNA technology were discovered in, come directly from, and are 
applied to microorganisms.
The expression of foreign DNA in microbial cells poses many challenges, so it 
may seem like each section of this chapter is filled with obstacles. The field 
of biotechnology has for years been addressing these challenges, and it has 
come up with some clever solutions to many of them, building tools that are 
used to either improve or solve a problem in the areas of research, medicine, 
food and alcohol, energy, mining, and environmental contamination.
Using Recombinant DNA Technology
Despite its fancy name, the concepts in recombinant DNA technology are 
quite simple:
	
1.	 Get a sequence of DNA that you’re interested in.
	
2.	 Modify it (optional).

262
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
	
3.	 Cut it to fit and then join it to a cloning vector.
	
4.	 Insert it into a host cell.
	
5.	 Choose, or select for, the host cells that now carry your DNA of interest.
	
6.	 If you want the protein product, extract it from the host cell.
This, in a nutshell, is the process that has been used over the last several 
decades on countless genes of interest. In this section, we go into a bit of 
detail about how these steps are accomplished and talk about some of the 
molecular tools used.
Making the insert
The first step to any recombinant DNA strategy is choosing a gene or path-
way of interest. This depends on the biotechnology application, but two 
broad categories may include
	
✓	Making a protein of interest to be purified and used without the organism 
(that is, an antibody, an antibiotic, or a therapeutic agent)
	
✓	Engineering an organism to do something, which usually involves an 
entire pathway (that is, multiple genes)
The polymerase chain reaction
PCR, shown in the figure, is the process of 
creating a large amount of a particular DNA 
sequence from:
	✓	A small amount of that sequence, called the 
template
	✓	Some small pieces of DNA that match the 
ends of the sequence of interest, called 
primers
	✓	Nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA)
	✓	An enzyme that knits nucleotides into a 
sequence (called a polymerase)
This method, developed in the 1990s, changed 
everything for researchers working with DNA. 
In a few short years, they went from having to 
painstakingly extract large amounts of DNA to 
work with or find creative ways to work with 
tiny amounts of DNA, to being able to generate 
all the necessary DNA in a couple of hours.
A surfer/chemist named Dr. Kary Mullis devel-
oped the technique, for which he got a Nobel 
Prize, while struggling to get enough DNA to 
study. He reasoned that if he could just cycle 
through the steps of DNA synthesis enough 
times, it should be possible to keep copying a 
stretch of DNA, the template, over and over 
again. The copies end up becoming the templates 
and the number of DNA molecules increase at 
an exponential rate. The beauty of this method 
is that every copy is identical, except for the odd 
error made by the polymerase enzyme. From a 
handful of DNA molecules, you can make mil-
lions of copies of your DNA sequence of interest.

263
 Chapter 16: Putting Microbes to Work: Biotechnology
After you’ve chosen the pathway or protein of interest, you need to get the 
DNA sequence that corresponds to it. Until recently, going from function to 
DNA involved complicated screens to identify and then capture the genes of 
interest. Now, with recent advances in DNA sequencing, complete genomes 

264
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
are available for a large number of organisms. These genomes can be used 
to either predict the gene function computationally or compare the genes to 
genes from other organisms for which the function is known.
Two other relatively modern breakthroughs that make the process of generat-
ing a DNA insert easier are chemical DNA synthesis and the polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR). With these breakthroughs, it’s possible to simply amplify the 
gene(s) and then use them in a cloning strategy.
	
If the genome of your organism of interest hasn’t been sequenced or if the 
gene you’re interested in hasn’t been studied before, it’s a bit more compli-
cated to get the DNA you need to work with, but thanks to decades of work 
done prior to the advent of PCR and gene databases, this too is relatively 
straightforward. But that’s the subject for a whole other book. . . .
In any case, in order to amplify your gene(s) of interest, you must first extract 
total DNA (or RNA) from cells of that organism. DNA extraction is essentially 
the same for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and involves breaking 
open the cells, neutralizing the enzymes (that may degrade nucleic acids), 
getting rid of the cellular debris, and then cleaning away the impurities. Some 
types of cells — notably Gram-positive bacterial cells and tough plant tissues 
like seeds — require more work to break open, but other than that, the rest of 
the steps are pretty much the same.
After you have DNA, or complementary DNA (cDNA) made from RNA, from 
the organism whose genes you’re interested in, you can either use them the 
way they are or modify them to improve or change the function or structure 
of the proteins they encode. Modifications are done either by directed muta-
genesis, where a specific change is made to the DNA sequence, or by random 
mutagenesis, where errors are intentionally made during amplification of the 
genes and the resulting proteins are tested for the desired changes.
Now the sequence of interest, modified or otherwise, is ready to be used to 
genetically engineer a microorganism to do your bidding.
Employing plasmids
One of the most valuable assets to recombinant DNA technology has been 
the plasmid. These small, circular pieces of DNA that occur naturally in bac-
teria are not part of the main bacterial chromosome (thus, they’re said to be 
extra-chromosomal). They replicate when the bacterial cell divides and can 
exist as many copies inside a cell.

265
 Chapter 16: Putting Microbes to Work: Biotechnology
Plasmids are very handy because you can manipulate them by adding DNA 
of interest and then put them back into a host cell, such as bacteria or yeast. 
Plasmids that have been modified to have certain features added to make 
them suitable for the transfer of genetic material to a host are called cloning 
vectors. Several features of cloning vectors make them handy, all of which 
exist within a plasmid backbone:
	
✓	Origin of replication (ori): This is the area where the enzyme complex of 
DNA replication binds, allowing the plasmid to be copied before cell divi-
sion. If a plasmid has an ori that is not recognized by the DNA polymerase 
of the organism it’s in, then the plasmid won’t be replicated and won’t 
be transferred to the new cell when cell division happens. The ori can be 
specific to the type of bacteria the plasmid originally came from, giving the 
plasmid a narrow host range, or be more general, giving it a broad host range.
	
✓	Selectable marker: Selectable markers are usually antibiotic-resistant 
genes that allow bacterial cells to survive in the presence of an anti-
biotic. Selection is important — without it, bacteria would lose the 
plasmid during successive rounds of cell division. Making the proteins 
encoded on the plasmid, as well as the plasmid itself, is metabolically 
expensive for a bacterial cell, so it’ll try to do without it if possible.
	
✓	Site of insertion: The plasmid must have a site of insertion for the target 
gene. It’s important that this be a restriction enzyme recognition site that 
doesn’t occur anywhere else in the plasmid; otherwise, when digested, 
the plasmid will be cut into more than one piece, making recircularization 
inconvenient. For convenience, many cloning vectors have been engineered 
with a multiple cloning site (MCS), where sites for multiple different restric-
tion enzymes have been put next to one another to make cloning easier.
	
✓	Promoter: If the gene of interest is to be expressed as a protein, this 
stretch of DNA contains all the binding sites for the enzyme RNA poly-
merase and all the accessory proteins needed to begin transcription. 
The promoter can either be put ahead of the site of insertion or be 
inserted as part of the target gene so that it can drive expression of the 
gene of interest, once inserted.
	
One great thing about cloning vectors is that the promoters, selectable mark-
ers, and plasmid backbones can be mixed and matched to create the right 
vector for the gene(s) of interest.
Cutting with restriction enzymes
Bacteria have a natural defense system involving enzymes that cut up foreign 
DNA. This is needed because viruses that infect bacteria, called bacterio-
phage, inject their DNA (or RNA) into the bacterial cell and then take over the 

266
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
cellular machinery, eventually killing the cells. Restriction enzymes work by 
cutting up any foreign DNA that is found in the cytoplasm. These enzymes 
are either exonucleases, which remove bases from the ends or endonucealses, 
which cut at sites within the DNA.
	
Restriction enzymes are one of the most useful tools in recombinant DNA 
technology for the following reasons:
	
✓	They cut DNA in a specific and reproducible way, called a digestion. 
This is important because it allows researchers to know the exact size 
of the fragments that they’ll get when they put in a known sequence and 
a particular restriction enzyme. The way this works is that restriction 
enzymes recognize a particular sequence in the DNA and always cut in 
the same way when they’ve bound there.
	
✓	The sequences can be four, six, or eight nucleotides long (for many 
options and versatility) and always have the same sequence in either 
the 5’ or 3’ direction. An example of the six base sequence for EcoRI, 
a common restriction enzyme, is shown in Figure 16-1 with cut sites 
always occurring between the G and the A.
	
Figure 16-1: 
Recognition 
site and 
naming con-
vention for 
the restric-
tion enzyme 
EcoRI.
	
The naming convention for restriction enzymes is also shown in Figure 16-1, 
where the genus, species, and strain of the organism from which the enzyme 
was originally found make up the first few letters in its name and then the 
order of the discovery of each restriction endonuclease for that organism is 
shown by the roman numeral at the end of the name.

267
 Chapter 16: Putting Microbes to Work: Biotechnology
Today more than 3,500 restriction enzymes have been isolated that recognize 
around 250 different target sites. Shorter recognition sites are present more 
frequently in genetic sequences than are longer ones. Restriction enzymes 
that recognize four and six base sites are used most frequently, whereas 
those that recognize eight base sites are less commonly used.
After a restriction endonuclease is used to digest a piece of DNA, the two 
ends of the DNA made by the cut are staggered (see Figure 16-2) and said to 
be “sticky.” Any other piece of DNA cut with the same enzyme will have the 
same sticky ends, and the two can be joined together through ligation (refer 
to Figure 16-2).
	
Figure 16-2: 
Ligation of 
two pieces 
of DNA 
cut with 
the same 
restriction 
enzyme.
	

268
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
Ligation requires another enzyme called a ligase, which seals the nicks in the 
backbone by bonding the hydroxyl residue (–OH) on one end to the phos-
phate (–PO3) on the other. What you’re left with is a seamless sequence of 
DNA called a construct that can be cut and ligated again to add more DNA or 
put into a cloning vector. (A cloning vector containing an insert is sometimes 
called the cloning vector–insert DNA construct, but let’s just say the cloning 
vector–insert.) For multi-gene constructs, a different restriction enzyme site is 
required for each addition, making it difficult to construct very large pieces 
of DNA or entire genomes. Recently this challenge has been overcome by the 
use of recombination (see the “Making long, multi-gene constructs” section, 
later in this chapter).
	
Not all restriction enzymes produce sticky ends. Some cut sequences leav-
ing the two strands flush with one another, called blunt ends. Ligating pieces 
together that have blunt ends is not difficult, but the ligase has no way of 
knowing which way the ends should be glued together, so extra care has to be 
taken afterward to verify that the sequences are in the right order.
Getting microbes to take up DNA
If a bacterial species is not naturally able to take up DNA, or not competent, it 
must be induced to take up the cloning vector-insert or DNA of interest. This 
can happen in a few different ways:
	
✓	Heat shock: Chemical competence can be induced by exposing a mid-log 
phase culture of the bacteria to cold calcium chloride and then exposing 
it to a high temperature (42°C) for two minutes. Plasmid DNA in solution 
along with the bacterium is taken up through transient holes in the cell wall.
	
✓	Electroporation: Electroporation is used to make cells take up DNA by 
exposing them to a short electrical pulse. Again, DNA mixed in with the 
culture just before the pulse is taken up through the cell wall via small 
openings that close shortly afterward. Although we know that it works, 
not much is really known about the mechanism involved in DNA uptake 
through electroporation.
	
✓	Conjugation: Conjugation is the transfer of genetic material from one cell 
to another through cell-to-cell connections specifically made so that DNA 
can pass from one to another. The genes necessary to form these cellular 
connections are not generally present on cloning vectors but can be sup-
plied by a second plasmid called a mobilizable plasmid. For conjugation 
to happen, you use three bacterial strains, the donor, the recipient, and 
the helper (see Figure 16-3).

269
 Chapter 16: Putting Microbes to Work: Biotechnology
	
Figure 16-3: 
Conjugation.
	
For conjugation the donor contains the cloning vector with the insert that 
you eventually want to be transferred into the recipient. The helper has 
the mobilizable plasmid with all the instructions for how to move plasmids 
between cells. After conjugation has happened, the trick is to select only for 
the cells you want, namely recipients with the plasmid of interest, and screen 
out all the others.
Yeast cells can be transformed with DNA in ways that are similar to bacteria, 
such as using electroporation or methods involving calcium phosphate. When 
DNA is introduced into mammalian cells, the process is called transfection 
instead of transformation. For these eukaryotic cells that aren’t so easily 
transfected, creative methods have been used to get the foreign DNA into the 
cells, like using viruses, shooting gold particles at them, or using magnets.

Using promoters to drive expression
A promoter is a region of DNA that contains sequences where the enzyme 
RNA polymerase and transcription factors bind to initiate transcription (see 
Chapter 6).
	
Promoters are used to drive protein expression.
Two aspects of promoters are important to their function in the cell:
	
✓	They can be strong and induce the production of a lot of protein, or 
they can be weak, producing less protein. You want strong promotion 
to get the most protein possible, but sometimes when the protein prod-
uct is toxic to the host cell or is very metabolically expensive to make, a 
weak promoter has to be used.
E. coli: The workhorse of molecular biotechnology
Escherichia coli, otherwise known as E. coli, 
is a Gram-negative bacterium found in the 
gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans. 
Because it’s easy to grow, it became the model 
organism for bacterial research on cell struc-
ture and function, as well as genetics. Because 
E. coli is Gram-negative, it’s easily transformed 
to take up foreign DNA such as plasmids, allow-
ing it to be used for recombinant DNA technol-
ogy and protein work.
Most E coli strains used for cloning have been 
extensively modified to include traits needed for 
cloning, including the following:
	✓	A lack of natural restriction enzymes, so 
that it won’t chew up foreign DNA (see the 
“Cutting with restriction enzymes” section, 
earlier in this chapter)
	✓	An inability to repair and/or recombine 
DNA, so that it won’t change the DNA 
sequences you’ve put in
	✓	Strong repressors for promoters like T7 and 
lac, so that you can turn on gene expression 
only when you want to, which means fewer 
leaky promoters (see the “Using promoters 
to drive expression” section, later in this 
chapter)
	✓	An inability to induce conjugation, so that 
they won’t transfer the DNA to other strains 
of bacteria
	✓	Being clean of bacteriophage, which are 
viruses that infect bacteria and insert their 
DNA into the chromosome
E. coli is also useful for producing a foreign pro-
tein for several reasons. Because it lacks the 
thick peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive 
bacteria, it’s easy to lyse (break open) the cells 
and recover the protein (also useful for recov-
ering DNA). Also, it isn’t too picky about con-
ditions, growing well at 37°C, and has a quick 
doubling time of around 20 minutes (with per-
fect conditions).

271
 Chapter 16: Putting Microbes to Work: Biotechnology
	
✓	They can be either inducible (meaning that they’re turned on only when 
needed, so as not to create a heavy metabolic burden on the cell) or con-
stitutive (meaning that the cells continuously express the protein).
Promoters also contain regions where repressors or inducers can bind. 
Repressors are molecules that interact with the DNA and/or the transcriptional 
machinery (RNA polymerase and transcription factors) and repress (turn 
off) transcription. When promoters are hard to repress, often because there 
are fewer repressor molecules than copies of the promoter, they’re said to be 
leaky because gene expression happens despite the repressor being present.
Making use of expression vectors
Expression vectors are plasmids that have been modified specifically to help 
the genetically engineered cell make functional protein, which is usually 
harvested from the cells. Ahead of the actual protein coding sequence is the 
ribosome binding site (RBS) where the machinery that will make a growing 
peptide chain binds to the mRNA after it’s made. Strong binding of the host 
cell’s ribosomes to the transcript is important — it ensures that the protein 
will be made efficiently. Alterations in this sequence are especially important 
when using prokaryotic cells (like E. coli) to express eukaryotic proteins (like 
those from humans), because the RBS differs between the two organisms.
Another way to ensure that the protein of interest is efficiently made is to 
make sure that there isn’t a codon bias in your DNA construct. Codons are the 
three base codes used to signal each amino acid during protein translation. 
They’re the sites at which a transfer RNA, or tRNA, binds to add a specific 
amino acid to the growing peptide chain during protein synthesis. More than 
one codon — and hence, more than one specific tRNA — can code for the 
same amino acid, but most organisms preferentially use some over others.
When a protein with one codon preference is expressed in a cell with a dif-
ferent codon preference, it can create a shortage of tRNAs and slow down 
protein synthesis. Likewise, some codons are rare in many bacteria, so 
expression of proteins with these codons in E. coli creates bottlenecks and is 
too slow.

272
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
There are a couple of solutions to these problems:
	
✓	You can use strains of E. coli containing tRNAs for these rare codons.
	
✓	You can alter the codon usage of the DNA sequence so that it matches 
the host more closely.
	
Making sure that the final protein will be stable is important. Some amino 
acids, or combination of amino acids, create sites that are vulnerable to degra-
dation by proteases (enzymes that degrade proteins). This is how proteins are 
naturally degraded in the cell under normal conditions. When a heterologous 
protein is being expressed in bacteria, however, it’s good to have the least 
amount of degradation possible to maximize yields. A way of improving this 
is to change the amino acids to others that are unlikely to cause the same 
problem. This is easier said than done — the amino acid changes have to be 
chosen so as not to alter the protein’s function.
Properly folding proteins
You can imagine that you’ve carefully chosen the protein, cleverly tweaked 
it to be more stable, and put it into an expression vector with the right pro-
moter. Now E. coli is conveniently making a bunch of the protein for you in a 
test tube. But when you try to purify the protein, you find that most of it isn’t 
functional and it’s stuck in an insoluble fraction containing inclusion bodies. 
These are deposits of misfolded protein either in the cytoplasm or the peri-
plasmic space. Foreign proteins don’t fold properly for a variety of reasons 
but mainly because their disulfide bonds haven’t been formed.
	
Disulfide bonds are bonds between the sulfur-containing thiol groups of cyste-
ine residues that give protein their structure.
Gram-negative bacteria are not great at making disulfide bonds, so proteins 
that need a lot of them won’t fold right and will end up in inclusion bodies. A 
few strategies have been tried to improve protein folding, but most have had 
limited success. The best ones include
	
✓	Overexpressing disulfide bond forming proteins along with the protein 
of interest.
	
✓	Lowering the temperature at which protein expression is turned on.

273
 Chapter 16: Putting Microbes to Work: Biotechnology
Being mindful of metabolic load
Sometimes a genetically engineered bacterial strain will not grow as quickly 
as you would expect and can even lose the gene(s) of interest despite selec-
tive pressure. This happens because the foreign DNA creates a metabolic 
change in the host cell, which can be detrimental to the host cell.
The amount of detrimental impact of the foreign gene(s) on the host is called 
metabolic load. When the metabolic load gets to be too high, the cells tend to 
not grow very well. Metabolic load can arise for several reasons:
	
✓	A high plasmid copy number or large plasmid size can be expensive for 
the host cell to maintain.
	
✓	An overproduction of a foreign protein can use up important or rare 
tRNAs and/or amino acids.
	
✓	Sometimes foreign products like enzymes have activities that interfere 
with host cell pathways by using up needed intermediates or by creating 
compounds that are toxic to the host.
	
✓	If the increased rate of metabolism of regular cellular processes plus for-
eign protein can’t be sustained by the level of oxygen in the media, the 
cells won’t grow well.
Along with decreased growth rates, other effects of metabolic load include 
the slowing down of other processes in the cell that need a lot of energy (for 
instance, nitrogen fixation), an increase in the number of errors made during 
translation, and the increase in secretion of polysaccharide substances 
making the cells much stickier than usual.
Making long, multi-gene constructs
The traditional ligation-based method for cloning in E. coli is useful for 
assembling relatively short sequences, but when the construct is very large 
with a size exceeding 20 kilobases (kb), difficulty amplifying and a lack of 
unique restriction sites creates insurmountable challenges. To overcome 
the 20 kb barrier, a number of strategies have been developed recently, all 
of which rely on the ability of a DNA molecule to pair with and combine with 
another piece of DNA with a similar sequence in a process called homologous 
recombination (see Figure 16-4).

274
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
	
Figure 16-4: 
Homologous 
recombina-
tion of DNA 
strands.
	
Recombination-based assembly (the construction of long pieces of DNA with 
homologous recombination) was used in 2007 to reconstruct both mitochon-
dria and chloroplast genomes in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis and in 2010 to 
create a completely synthetic genome based on the bacterium Mycoplasma. 
This method involved using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to perform 
DNA recombination of over a thousand fragments of synthetic DNA in a process 
called transformation-associated recombination (TAR), shown in Figure 16-5.
Each 1 kb fragment was first chemically synthesized and designed to con-
tain regions at each end that overlapped sequences to either side of it in the 
genome. When two or more such pieces of DNA are taken up by the yeast cell, 
they’re naturally paired up, using these overlapping regions, and then com-
bined using homologous recombination. Pools of ten sequences each were put 
into yeast and combined to make longer fragments (10 × 1 kb = 10 kb), which 
were then put into yeast again to make longer fragments. In three rounds, the 
complete 1 mega base (Mb) genome of the Mycobacterium was constructed.

The advantages of this method can’t be overstated. Making a DNA construct of 
this size with only restriction enzyme digestion and ligation would never have 
been possible — but thanks to yeast cells and homologous recombination, 
complex gene constructs can be assembled easily.
Yeast: The new workhorse of molecular 
biotechnology
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is not a newcomer 
to genetic engineering or research labs, but it is 
starting to gain fame from its unsurpassed abil-
ity to assemble recombinant sequences in vivo 
(in the cell). As a eukaryotic cell, yeast has for 
years been used:
	✓	To study aspects of eukaryotic cellular biol-
ogy and physiology
	✓	In the food and beer industries and in bio-
technology to produce proteins of interest
	✓	As a model to study cancer
Like all eukaryotic cells, yeast carries its 
genetic information in chromosomes, but it 
can also use DNA in circular, plasmidlike mol-
ecules called yeast artificial chromosomes 
(YACs). Problems with instability of YACs have 
recently been overcome, so many of the clon-
ing steps that used to be done exclusively in 
E coli are now being accomplished more easily 
in yeast.

276
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
Providing Therapies
Pharmaceuticals (such as insulin, interferon, and anticoagulants), hormones 
(like human growth hormone, epidermal growth factor, and fibroblast growth 
factor), and anti-cancer drugs are all made through microbial biotechnology. 
In many cases, only a tiny amount of these drugs could be extracted from 
animal tissues. Some of these therapeutic agents used to be made from bio-
logical systems, usually protein based, but they were expensive and hard to 
make. This meant that patients often didn’t have access to them. Now many 
of these products are commonly used to treat people with diabetes, people 
with infectious diseases or cancer, and stroke patients, among others. A few 
examples are given in the this section.
Improving antibiotics
Many of the antibiotics that are used every day have been developed and 
produced through biotechnology. Although the discovery of naturally occur-
ring antibiotics has slowed, attempts to improve current antibiotics have 
continued. One example of this is the attempt to design new modes of action 
for current antibiotics by genetically engineering changes in known steps of 
antibiotic synthesis genes.
Manipulation of the expression of these genes in organisms such as Streptomyces 
has been used to try to improve antibiotic yield. Streptomyces are a genus of 
bacteria that is commonly found in soil. They’re an invaluable group of bacteria 
because they produce a lot of bioactive compounds, which are those that have 
effects on bacteria (as well as other organisms). More than 50 different antibiotics 
have been isolated from this group of bacteria.
One obstacle to high yield of antibiotics from strains of bacteria such as 
Streptomyces has been a limit to the amount of dissolved oxygen in the cul-
ture media. Antibiotics are complex to make, and producing large quantities 
of them requires more oxygen than can easily be dissolved in liquid media. 
One solution to this problem has been to engineer strains of Streptomyces 
with genes for a bacterial heme that can bind oxygen and deliver it to the 
growing cells.
Another problem is that organisms that produce antibiotics are often slow 
growing. A solution to this problem has been to identify all the genes involved 
in the biosynthesis of a particular antibiotic and engineer E. coli to produce 
the antibiotic of interest, since E. coli grows quickly in culture.

277
 Chapter 16: Putting Microbes to Work: Biotechnology
Developing vaccines
Current vaccines are produced in two ways: by culturing the pathogenic 
agent in a lab and then either killing it (killed vaccines) or inactivating its 
ability to cause disease (attenuated vaccines). These methods of vaccine pro-
duction have some drawbacks:
	
✓	It’s expensive.
	
✓	It produces low yields.
	
✓	It’s dangerous to the people making the vaccine.
	
✓	It requires that the vaccine be tested rigorously to ensure that no live 
agent has contaminated the final vaccine.
	
✓	The vaccine has to be refrigerated once made.
Researchers have come up with several ways to improve vaccines:
	
✓	Deleting the virulence genes, ensuring that the strain won’t revert and 
become virulent again.
	
✓	Using a benign microbe to express the bits of the pathogen that can 
illicit an immune response, called the antigenic determinants. This 
way the body makes a robust immune response and there is no risk of 
spreading the disease.
	
✓	Expressing the antigenic determinants in bulk in a fast-growing lab strain of 
bacteria like E. coli and then recovering them and using them in a vaccine.
The last two methods are especially useful for pathogens that can’t be grown 
in culture and for which there are no current vaccines. A number of vaccines 
have been developed based on these ideas, but for the most part they’re 
used in veterinary medicine. There is a real need to produce cost-effective 
and easily distributed vaccines for people in the developing world. Recently, 
there has been a resurgence in research in this area thanks in part to grants 
by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
Using Microbes Industrially
Many industries used to pump out waste products with a high carbohydrate 
load. Now that we know that the environment can’t totally absorb all our 
waste, industries have had to find ways of recycling or disposing of high-
carbohydrate waste, called biomass. Biomass has the potential to be used 
in many industrial processes as feedstock (the nutrient input) to fuel the 

278
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
microorganisms that are producing a product of interest. An example of this is 
the use of whey (the watery waste from the cheese industry) as input into the 
production of xantham gum, which is used as a stabilizer in cosmetic products.
Commercial microbial production is called industrial fermentation, even when 
fermentation in the biochemical sense is not part of the process. These 
types of reactions happen in large vessels called fermenters, which can often 
hold more than 3,500 liters. The following things are important to successful 
industrial fermentation:
	
✓	Inside a fermenter the conditions are rigidly controlled to be optimal for 
the microbes so that they produce the highest yield of products.
	
✓	The input media has to be cheap, so it’s often the waste from something 
else, like whey from cheese production.
	
✓	The microbial strains used have to be unstressed, healthy, free of patho-
gens (like viruses), and good at producing the product of interest. A lot 
of research goes into developing better microbial strains.
	
✓	The fermenter has to be protected from contamination with pathogens 
or competing microorganisms.
	
✓	Products should be easy to extract.
	
✓	The product has to be safe and free of bacterial substances that could 
be dangerous for the consumer.
Examples of food and alcohol fermentation include bread, cheese, yogurt, 
sauerkraut, pickles, beer, wine, and spirits. Food additives such as amino 
acids and thickening agents are produced from microorganisms, as well as 
organic acids and industrial alcohol.
Many of the additional steps involved in industrial fermentation are performed 
by enzymes derived from microbial sources. Typically, these enzymes are 
from genetically engineered strains. In the brewing industry, for instance, the 
yeast used to make the beer is rarely genetically engineered, but recombinant 
enzymes are used for other steps such as malting and post-fermentation steps 
like clarifying.
Protecting plants with microbial 
insecticides
During its spore-forming phase, the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) 
makes a group of proteins that are toxic to insects called the Cry proteins. 
Cry proteins are formed as crystals that, when ingested by certain insect 
larvae, are converted into the active toxin by the stomach pH and enzymes. 

279
 Chapter 16: Putting Microbes to Work: Biotechnology
The mature Cry toxin inserts itself into the cellular membrane of epithelial 
cells lining the intestinal wall of the insect, causing cell death and eventually 
dehydration as the intestinal cells are destroyed.
The bacterial Cry proteins have been engineered into crop plants to give 
them protection against insect pests. These transgenic plants are widely used 
in agriculture. Depending on the type of promoter used, the Cry proteins 
can be expressed either in all plant parts or only in the parts that are most 
affected by the insect. Target insects feeding on any part of the plant express-
ing the Cry genes will be exposed to the toxin. Other commercial prepara-
tions of the Cry proteins, used by organic farmers, include purified protein or 
Bt spores that can be applied to crops in the place of chemical pesticides.
	
As with all other pesticides, insects have managed to form resistance to the 
Cry toxins, with at least five species of insect known to be insensitive to them. 
This serves as a warning about overuse of an inhibiting compound, which if 
put into the environment in large amounts will inevitably cause the develop-
ment of resistance to it in the target organism.
Making biofuels
Biofuels are currently produced as alternatives to fossil fuels. To make bio-
fuel, carbohydrates are fermented anaerobically by yeast to form ethanol. 
Currently, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used to make biofuel from 
the carbohydrates derived from corn wheat and sugarcane. For the most 
part, the carbohydrates used come from the sugary and starchy parts of the 
plant, leaving the bulk of the plant biomass unused. This is because the rest 
of the plant (for instance, stalks and leaves) contain compounds called lignin 
and cellulose, which require many different enzymes (from many different 
microbes) to break down. It makes sense that these compounds would be 
resistant to microbial digestion — they provide the rigid support to plant 
structures in nature.
	
As an alternative to fossil fuels, current methods for producing biofuels are 
not perfect. The energy input for crop production, the impact on food prices 
and greenhouse gas emission from farming all decrease the payoffs (renew-
able resource, less greenhouse gas emissions, and less energy put in).
In an effort to improve the energy yield of the process, an alternative microbe 
has been proposed for producing ethanol. One of the problems is that yeast 
uses some of the energy it gets from fermentation to grow, creating more 
microbial biomass. Ethanol is, after all, a waste product, so in nature microbes 
would want to limit the amount of energy lost as waste. Some microbes, 
however, like the bacterium Zymomonas, ferment sugars through a different 
pathway that produces less microbial biomass from sugars, releasing more 
ethanol in the process.

280
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
Another improvement is the use of more complex carbohydrate sources as 
input to the system because breaking down complex carbohydrates either 
chemically or enzymatically before feeding them into the fermentation pro-
cess only makes the process less efficient. For this, genetic engineering of 
additional enzymatic pathways into both Zymomonas and E. coli has been 
used. Improvements to this process have been developed in the lab but 
aren’t currently used in industry.
Bioleaching metals
Acidithiobacillus and Leptospirillum bacterium can clean up abandoned mine 
sites. The traditional way of extracting metals from rocks has been through 
smelting processes. These processed have huge environmental impacts in terms 
of the release of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, arsenic, and mercury. Smelting 
is also pretty inefficient. It releases large quantities of waste called slag that still 
contain metals but at a concentration too low to be extracted economically. 
Bioleaching (the extraction of metals from rocks by microorganisms) is cur-
rently used as an alternative in about 20 percent of copper mines. Microbes can 
extract metals that are at lower concentrations and from types of rock that are 
difficult to smelt. They can also remove contaminating arsenic and convert it to 
a form that won’t leach into waste water or contaminate the final product.
Bioleaching is overall less expensive and requires less infrastructure than 
smelting, making it more economical and environmentally friendly. The way 
it works is that a solution of bacteria is percolated through a slag pile, remov-
ing metals as it goes. When the solution drains out, the copper is extracted 
from the liquid through electrolysis. All the microbes known to do this are 
acid tolerant and some are thermophilic (they like to grow at temperatures 
above 45°C) members of the Acidithiobacillus group. Some are iron-oxidizing 
members of the Leptospirillum group of bacteria.
	
Microbes used in bioleaching to mine metals can also be used to clean up con-
tamination in mine sites — specifically, uranium-contaminated sites, where the 
radioactive uranium has to be stabilized.
Cleaning up with microbes
Bioremediation is the degradation of organic contaminants by microorgan-
isms. Contaminants from chemical spills, industrial waste, or other waste 
include
	
✓	Hydrocarbons
	
✓	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
	
✓	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)

281
 Chapter 16: Putting Microbes to Work: Biotechnology
	
✓	Hazardous material such as explosives
	
✓	Xenobiotics such as pesticides, herbicides, refrigerants, and solvents
	
✓	Inorganic compounds such as cyanide, ammonia, nitrates, and sulfates
There are two ways of inducing bioremediation to occur:
	
✓	Bioaugmentation: The addition of bacteria to a site where they don’t 
naturally occur in order to induce breakdown of a contaminant
	
✓	Biostimulation: The addition of nutrients or growth stimulants to a site 
thought to already contain the bacteria needed
Stimulants can include adding or removing oxygen, water, nutrients, or electron 
donors/acceptors. Bioremediation can be done at the site, or the contaminated 
material can be removed and treated elsewhere and then returned to the site 
afterward.
Many soil bacteria from the genus Pseudomonas are able to degrade contami-
nants. The genes are often located on plasmids. One organism can sometimes 
use a wide range of compounds as its sole carbon source. Organic contami-
nants fall into a couple of groups based on whether they have aromatic 
structures and/or halogen atoms (see Figure 16-6). These features make them 
more difficult to degrade and more persistent in the environment.

Classes of 
environ-
mental con-
taminants

breakdown.
	

282
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
Nonhalogenated compounds are for the most part all converted to catechol, 
which is cleaved to common compounds that all microbes can use.
Halogenated compounds are more difficult to break down. For each halogen 
atom, the rate of degradation is cut in half. In order to be degraded fully, the 
compound has to have the halogen group(s) removed in a process called 
reductive dehalogenation that has only been found in some anaerobic syn-
trophic communities that have yet to be completely defined. The microbes 
in these communities are syntrophs —that they depend on one other to 
complete redox reactions. For this reason, halogenated pesticides like dithio-
threitol (DTT) that were widely used in the 1940s persist to this day in the 
environment, four decades after they were banned in North America.
Strategies to allow bioremediation of contaminated sites sometimes involve 
using a mix of microbes that can work together to perform all steps of the 
degradative process. Drawbacks of this approach are that contaminated sites 
often contain a mix of pollutants, some of which can inhibit the growth of 
some of the microbes in the mix. Another problem is that although a microor-
ganism may have the pathways needed to break down a compound, it may not 
perform well under the environmental conditions at the contaminated site.
To overcome these problems, a strategy has been developed to choose one 
microbe, or a small set of microbes, known to survive well at a site of contam-
ination and genetically engineer into them all the genes needed to perform 
the various breakdown steps required. Despite the promise of this strategy, 
the hydrocarbons in most oil spills are more effectively degraded by the nat-
ural microflora in the sea than by one genetically engineered “superbug.”
Finally, organic contaminants in radioactive waste sites pose a problem because 
organisms that are able to degrade the pollutants are killed by the radioactivity. 
A few known microbes are tolerant of the levels of radiation present at these 
sites. One, Deinococcus radiodurans, has been genetically engineered to express 
genes needed to break down aromatic compounds. The resulting strain can 
degrade toluene, chlorobenzene, and 3,4-dichloro-1-butene in the lab, but its 
use for large-scale bioremediation is a long way off.

n previous chapters, we discuss the variety of microbial life on earth, how 
we study microbes, and the role of microbes in the environment. The truth 
is, microbes would probably get much less attention if some of them didn’t 
cause serious human and animal diseases. The proportion of all microorgan-
isms on earth that make us sick is minuscule, but their impact has shaped 
human history and driven scientific discovery like almost nothing else.
Protecting Public Health: Epidemiology
Over the past century, there has been a drastic reduction in the burden of 
infectious disease. This is due to a combination of factors, including the use 
of vaccinations to prevent infections, the use of antibiotics to treat infections, 
overall improved nutrition and living standards, and water and food safety 
regulations.
The scientists who monitor the trends of infectious disease and the interven-
tions that protect against them fall in the field of public health. Public health 
incorporates information from a range of fields — including science, medi-
cine, sociology, statistics, politics, and education — to improve the health of 
an entire population. Epidemiologists are central to the field of public health 
and are experts in identifying, tracking, and stopping outbreaks.

284
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
Tracking diseases
Epidemiologists collect information called surveillance data on the health of 
a population on a regular basis. Outbreaks of infectious disease are sporadic, 
usually unpredictable, and can sometimes spread rapidly through a population, 
so it’s important that epidemiologists ask questions about the general trends 
of a particular infectious disease so that they can identify when something 
goes awry.
Several pieces of information help epidemiologists describe the pattern of an 
infectious disease:
	
✓	Incidence of a disease: The number of new cases in a population in a 
given time period
	
✓	Prevalence of a disease: The total number of new and existing cases in 
a population in a given time period
	
✓	Reservoirs: Sources of infection, such as animals, soil, or food
	
✓	Carriers: Individuals who carry a pathogen without showing signs of an 
infection
	
✓	Morbidity: The incidence of a disease in population that includes both 
fatal and nonfatal cases
	
✓	Mortality: The incidence of death in a population
Collecting surveillance data for each type of disease is important, because 
their occurrence, distribution, and impact on the population can vary quite a 
bit. For example, one case of the flu is not sufficient to sound the alarm, but 
one case of Ebola is an immediate threat.
Hospital-associated infections
Ironically, many outbreaks originate from hos-
pitals. This is partly because hospital patients 
often have compromised immune systems and 
are at higher risk of getting an infection, and 
partly because healthcare personnel are in 
f­requent contact with many patients and unin-
tentionally transmit infections. Around 5 ­percent 
of patients admitted to a hospital will get an 
infection while there. Hospital-associated 
infections are called nosocomial infections. 
Common pathogens include E. coli, which 
causes urinary tract infections, S. aureus, 
which causes bloodstream infections, and C. 
difficile, which causes diarrhea. Hospitals take 
preventive measures to reduce transmission 
of infections by encouraging hand washing, 
­isolating patients who show symptoms of an 
infectious illness, and thoroughly cleaning sur-
faces and surgical equipment.

 Chapter 17: Fighting Microbial Diseases
Investigating outbreaks
Infectious disease epidemiologists are like detectives. When their data indicate 
that an outbreak could be occurring, they begin to investigate the cases of 
people infected. They look for commonalities in people’s food consumption 
and social interactions to help identify the source of the infection and how it’s 
transmitted. With these clues, they decide on the best way to intervene and 
reduce the spread of the infection.
Outbreaks are classified into three main categories:
	
✓	Epidemic: An outbreak is considered epidemic when an unusually high 
number of people are infected in a population.
	
✓	Pandemic: A pandemic is similar to an epidemic, but it indicates that 
cases are widespread around the world.
	
✓	Endemic: An endemic disease is always present in the population in low 
levels.
Catching the source
When pathogens aren’t causing an infection, they reside in reservoirs (ani-
mals or inanimate objects that allow them to stay viable until they contact a 
susceptible host). Animals are common reservoirs of infections that can be 
transmitted to humans. Infections transmitted from animals to humans are 
considered zoonotic. For example, cows are a reservoir of a dangerous form 
of E. coli known as OH157:H7. If cow manure containing OH157:H7 contami-
nates soil or produce on a farm, the humans who consume that food are at 
risk of infection.
People who carry an infection without showing any symptoms, called carri-
ers, are another major source of infections. Because they don’t necessarily 
know they carry a pathogen, they don’t take precaution against spreading it 
to susceptible individuals. Carriage can be short (such as unknowingly con-
tracting a mild respiratory virus) or continuous (such as colonization for an 
extended period of time). Some examples of diseases where carriers spread 
infection include Staphylococcus aureus infections, hepatitis, tuberculosis, 
and typhoid fever.
Staying on top of transmission
Pathogen survival in a population depends on its transmission. To be successful 
at transmission, a pathogen must escape one host, travel to find another 
host, and then enter that host. Although it doesn’t sound like a difficult task, 
many pathogens are used to the warm and moist environment of the body, 
and the outside environment can be a harsh place to survive.

286
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
Direct host-to-host transmission occurs when a pathogen does not pass 
through an intermediate. Some infections, like colds or the flu, are transmitted 
in air droplets after infected individuals sneeze or cough. Other infections, 
such as syphilis or HIV, are transmitted through exchange of bodily fluid or 
sexual intercourse.
Infections can also be passed indirectly through an intermediate. Intermediates 
can be inanimate objects (referred to as a fomites), including bedding, toys, or 
surfaces, or living things (referred to as vectors), such as insects or animals. 
Vectors of disease are organisms that pick up a pathogen without becoming 
infected and transfer it from host to host. Mosquitos are common culprits of 
indirect transmission of diseases, such as malaria.
Gaining control
Epidemiologists can implement several strategies to help stop an outbreak:
	
✓	Control of vehicles of infection such as water or food (for example, 
through water purification or milk pasteurization)
	
✓	Reduction of interaction with reservoirs of disease (for example, elimi-
nation of infected animals/insects)
	
✓	Quarantine and isolation of infected individuals
	
✓	Vaccination
Vaccination is the ideal method to reduce the spread of disease. The coverage 
rate (the number of people vaccinated in a population) does not necessarily 
have to reach 100 percent for a vaccine to be effective. A successful coverage 
rate is one that provides herd immunity in a population. Herd immunity occurs 
when a sufficient amount of the population is immune to a disease such that 
the whole population is protected. For example, the success of the measles 
vaccines is attributable to herd immunity.
In some cases, it’s beneficial to reach 100 percent coverage, because this can 
lead to pathogen eradication. It’s possible to eradicate an infectious disease 
if the only reservoirs of infections are humans. Such was the case for polio, a 
virus that infects children and causes paralysis. Jonas Salk invented the polio 
vaccine in the 1950s and, since then, global vaccination efforts have led to 99 
percent eradication of polio, but efforts are still under way to eradicate polio 
completely.

287
 Chapter 17: Fighting Microbial Diseases
Identifying a Microbial Pathogen
Many pathogens cause infections that share similar symptoms, such as a 
fever, pneumonia, or diarrhea. This makes it difficult to diagnose an infec-
tion based on a patient’s symptoms. Clinical microbiologists have the task 
of identifying the causative microorganism in order to inform the doctor of 
how to treat the infection. The field of diagnostic microbiology uses genetic, 
biochemical, and immunological tests to narrow down the list of possible 
causative pathogens.
Traditional diagnostic tests first require culturing of the microorganism 
from infected tissue. This can take a few days — since some pathogens 
are slow growing or require very specific growth conditions. Although the 
traditional methods are effective, rapid identification is important for severe 
life-threatening infections. For example, the risk of death from septic shock 
increases 7 percent for every hour that passes. New technologies that allow 
rapid pathogen identification are making their way into diagnostic labs, 
making clinical microbiology a mixing pot of new and old tricks.
Characterizing morphology
A staple technique in every microbiology lab is the Gram stain (see Chapter 7). 
In the Gram stain, bacteria are categorized into two groups based on the 
results of the stain: Gram-negative or Gram-positive. The Gram stain also 
reveals the cell shape — for example, whether the cells are rod shaped or 
coccoid. From here, a clinical microbiologist has enough information to 
decide on the appropriate biochemical tests to use.
Using DDT to eliminate insect-borne disease
Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane, commonly 
known as DDT, is an insecticide developed in 
the 1940s to eliminate insects that carry human 
diseases, such as malaria, typhus, and West 
Nile virus. In a global concerted effort in 1955, 
it was used in an attempt to eradicate malaria. 
Although it was a successful means of reduc-
ing mosquito populations and controlling 
malaria, its overuse led to the emergence of 
insecticide-resistant species. Scientists also 
found that DDT had a negative consequence 
on animal ecology and human health. It was 
banned in the United States in 1972, although 
it’s still used today in developing countries 
where malaria is endemic, although its use is 
regulated. The benefits of protecting individu-
als against a deadly disease are thought to out-
weigh the health risks associated with DDT use.

288
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
Mycobacterium, a group of important human pathogens, won’t take up the 
crystal violet dye used in Gram staining because the cell wall contains high 
amounts of lipids. Instead, they’re stained with a carbol-fuchsin dye that is 
red; they don’t let go of the color when washed with acid, making them acid-
fast positive.
Figure 17-1 gives an example of how to narrow down the identity of a bacte-
rium based on staining and morphology.

Using biochemical tests
The principle behind biochemical tests it that different species differ in 
metabolic capacities or enzymatic activities that allow them to be differentiated. 
These tests (outlined in Table 17-1 and Table 17-2) act as a process of elimination 
to reach a final conclusion of the pathogen’s identity. There are many other tests 
but here are a few that illustrate the principle. Figure 17-2 is a flow chart for how 
these tests are run.

 Chapter 17: Fighting Microbial Diseases
Typing strains with phage
Bacteriophage, often just called phage, are viruses that infect bacteria (see 
Chapter 14 for more information about these viruses). The fact that phage 
are very picky about their host has been used in diagnostic labs to identify 
which strain of a particular bacteria is present, a process called phage typing. 
In practice, enough of the unidentified bacterium in question is plated on 
solid media so that a thin layer of cells, called a lawn of bacteria, covers the 
entire plate. Onto this lawn are placed drops of bacteriophage that will infect 
and lyse their target bacteria (see Figure 17-3), creating clear circles where 
the bacteria have died.
Figure 17-3: 
Phage 
typing of a 
bacterial 
strain.
One bacterial strain can be vulnerable to more than one phage, but most 
strains can be distinguished from one another based on the combination of 
which phage kill it. Phage typing is useful for finding the source of a bacte-
rial infection because samples from the site and a few other sources can be 
tested and then compared.

292
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
Using serology
Microorganisms are antigenic, meaning that they induce an immune response 
in a host that involves producing antibodies against the invader. Serology is 
the study of the serum of animals, and the antibodies present there and is a 
valuable tool for pathogen identification. The antibodies produced against 
an organism are very specific and can discern between closely related 
organisms, which are then called serotypes or serovars.
Serological testing involves the use of serum-containing antibodies produced 
in animals against known pathogens, called antiserum. Serological testing can 
be done in several ways:
	
✓	Agglutination test: Uses antisera, added to a sample of unknown bac-
teria, to test for the presence of a known pathogen. When the antisera 
contains the right antibodies, clumping of the bacteria, or agglutination, 
is visible.
	
✓	Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): Uses antibodies to bind 
and then visualize the presence of an antigen in a sample. The antigen 
can be either bacterial or viral, so these methods have been used in the 
quick detection of known pathogens including viruses. The antibodies 
are attached to a solid surface, the sample containing the suspected 
pathogen is added, if present the pathogen binds to the antibodies, and 
the rest is washed away. Another antibody to the pathogen is tagged so 
that it either emits light or changes color, indicating that the pathogen 
was, in fact, present in the sample.
Sorting the streptococci by Lancefield groups
The genus Streptococcus is made up of many 
different, closely related bacteria that have 
a range of impacts on human health, from 
innocuous colonization to nasty diseases like 
flesh-eating disease. The mystery behind this 
group of bacteria was that an astonishing array 
of diseases seemed to be caused by a group of 
bacteria that doctors couldn’t tell apart.
Dr. Rebecca Lancefield’s great knowledge 
about these bacteria, and about serology, 
enabled her to come up with a typing system 
for them. Using antisera against different Strep 
pathogens, Dr  Lancefield divided them into 
groups and then worked on identifying the 
antigenic bacterial components  —  capsule 
polysaccharide and M protein — in order to 
subdivide them further.
Today the Lancefield system is essential to our 
understanding of the diseases caused by the 
streptococci. This also explained why Koch’s 
postulates, stating that a single organism 
causes a single disease, didn’t work to describe 
this group of bacteria — many streptococci 
cause several different diseases.

293
 Chapter 17: Fighting Microbial Diseases
	
✓	Western blotting: Takes advantage of the same principals as ELISA, but 
the antigenic compound is bound to a matrix and the antibodies are 
added to it.
Testing antibiotic susceptibility
Knowing what organism is causing a disease, as well as the strain of that 
organism, is useful information. Most treatments are based solely on that 
information. However, it’s often important to know the antibiotic sensitivity 
profile of an organism in order to treat the patient effectively. Also, a patho-
gen can develop antibiotic resistance over the course of treatment, which 
makes it necessary to test which other drugs can be used against it.
To do this, several different methods are used, although only the broth dilu-
tion test is truly an accurate measure of how much antibiotic is needed to kill 
a bacterial strain.
	
✓	Disk diffusion assay: Indicates the inhibitory effect of different 
concentrations of antibiotic. It works by first spreading a specific 
concentration of bacterial cells on solid media and then adding disks of 
antibiotics then giving the bacterial cells time to grow and form a lawn. 
The zone of clearing around each disk gives an indication of the effect of 
the antibiotic. This test is less precise than other tests because it relies 
on the ability of the antibiotic to diffuse through the media.
	
✓	Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): Can be calculated for each 
antibiotic in a similar way to the disk diffusion assay, except that a 
commercially produced strip is added to the plate; the strip has precise 
markings on it that indicate the concentration of the drug being delivered 
to the media.
	
✓	Broth dilution test: The preceding two tests only give an indication 
of the inhibitory effect of an antibiotic. To test the concentration of 
the drug needed to kill the bacterial strain, the minimum bactericidal 
concentration is calculated. This is done with the broth dilution test, 
where concentrations of antibiotic are added to tubes of culture media, 
which are then inoculated with the bacterial strain. The amount of 
growth of bacterial cells from each tube is monitored on culture media 
without any antibiotic. The broth dilution test is commercially available 
with wells of a microtiter plate loaded with the precise concentrations of 
antibiotics necessary.

Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
Understanding Vaccines
In the fight against infectious diseases, we have three main weapons: sanitation, 
antibiotics, and vaccines.
Although proper sanitation has gone a long way toward stemming the spread 
of some diseases, in the developing world this is still a struggle. Education 
about preventive practices has reduced the spread of communicable diseases, 
but prevention isn’t always possible.
Antibiotics are very effective at killing or stopping the growth of bacterial 
infections, but they have several serious flaws. (See the article at www.dummies.
com/extras/microbiology for a complete discussion of the problems with 
the overuse of antibiotics, as well as the sidebar in Chapter 20 and the section 
on superbugs in Chapter 15.) Bacteria can and eventually will develop resistance 
to most antibiotics, leading to the development of many antibiotic-resistant 
strains that are impossible to treat. Multi-drug resistant bacteria (superbugs) are 
a major concern even today, because some are no longer sensitive to any of the 
available antibiotics.
In the case of viral infections, preventive behaviors and vaccination are our 
only defense, because antibiotics are useless to treat viruses and some can’t 
be treated at all once contracted. It’s especially important for young children, 
the elderly, and people with a compromised immune system, in which vaccina-
tion is not effective, to not be exposed to infectious diseases because they’re 
at the highest risk of both contracting a pathogen and having the most severe 
outcomes from an infection. For these reasons, it’s important for everyone 
to be vaccinated, a process that limits the number of circulating pathogenic 
organisms in society, thereby protecting the vulnerable from exposure.
Microbial diseases: The laundry list
An assortment of microbial diseases have 
afflicted humans throughout history and 
to this day. They range in severity from the 
minor inconvenience of a cold to the rapid 
deterioration and death that happens during 
sepsis. Individual species or strains of bacte-
ria, viruses, fungi, and protozoans can be the 
causes of disease, each with their own method 
of transmission, target tissue in the body and 
disease symptoms.
We don’t have space to catalog all known 
microbial diseases, but you can find a complete 
discussion of all microbial diseases at the

North America, see www.nc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list.
Understanding how vaccines work
Pathogenic microorganisms are seen by the body because they’re made of 
nucleic acids, proteins, and sugars, called antigens, which are foreign and 
provoke an immune response. The first time a pathogen is encountered, a 
primary immune response occurs that causes antibodies to be made against 
the antigens and memory cells to be formed. If the same pathogen is seen 
a second time, it provokes a quicker and much stronger immune response 
thanks to these memory cells.
	
Epitopes are the specific structures on the antigen that are bound by antibod-
ies. Antigens are made of protein or sugars and the parts of the molecules that 
are on the surface act as epitopes.
Vaccination takes advantage of this response to antigens by exposing a 
person to a harmless, or at least less harmful, version of a pathogen in order 
to induce protection from the real thing. Vaccination is extremely effective at 
reducing the number of deaths from a disease-causing microbe with the bonus 
that if enough people are protected, the amount of the virus or bacteria can 
no longer circulate in the population, eventually making vaccination against it 
unnecessary.
Two discoveries helped improve the safety and effectiveness of vaccines:
	
✓	Adjuvants: Adjuvants can boost the immune response, allowing both 
the use of smaller doses and the vaccination of people who normally 
only mount a weak response. Adjuvants were discovered by accident, 
but research into them found several compounds — namely, aluminum 
salts — that act to increase the primary immune response in ways that 
are not fully understood.
	
✓	Similar but harmless relatives: A harmless relative of a nasty pathogen 
can sometimes be similar enough that an immune response to it can pro-
vide protection against the pathogen itself. This was the case with one 
of the first-ever vaccines for smallpox based first on a similar virus that 
caused cowpox and later on the Vaccinia virus. Smallpox has been eradi-
cated worldwide in large part due to the success of Vaccinia at infecting 
animal cells and causing a robust immune response that will protect 
against many of the pox viruses.

296
Part V: Seeing the Impact of Microbes 
Ranking the types of vaccines
Although not the safest way, the most effective way to gain lifelong protection 
from a pathogen is to recover from an infection by it. For many pathogens, 
the mortality rate is very high, complications are unpleasant and sometimes 
permanent, and individuals at risk, like small children and the elderly, are dis-
proportionately affected.
A safer way of protecting people from an infectious microbe is to give them a 
vaccine for it. There are several types of vaccines based on what parts of the 
pathogenic organism are used to stimulate an immune response. They vary in 
their effectiveness in providing long-term immunity.
	
✓	Live attenuated vaccines: The most effective vaccines are those that 
contain live attenuated virus or bacteria. They’re called attenuated 
because their ability to cause disease has been disabled by either 
removing or disrupting one of their virulence genes. These vaccines 
produce immunity that lasts a lifetime. The risk that an attenuated 
pathogen will revert back to its virulent state is always there, making 
these types of vaccines riskier than the others.
	
✓	Killed bacteria or viruses: The immune system reacts to the pathogen 
but in a weaker way than it does to a live vaccine. Future exposures to 
the killed microbe in the form of boosters are required to keep immunity 
high.
	
✓	Subunit vaccines: Made by genetically engineering another, nonpathogenic 
microorganism, to trigger an immune response similar to what would 
happen with the real pathogen. Because the vaccine contains only one 
part of the original pathogen, a subunit vaccine gives a shorter period of 
protection than does the live vaccine.
	
✓	Toxoids: When our immune system encounters a bacterial toxin it 
produces antibodies that bind to it and inactivate it so that it can’t 
bind to its target. Toxoids are inactive bacterial toxins that, when 
used as a vaccine, can provide protection again the bacteria that make 
them. Toxoids are not as effective as live vaccines.
	
✓	Conjugated vaccines: The immature immune system of young children 
can’t respond strongly enough to some vaccines to give them protec-
tion from the pathogen later. For this reason, conjugated vaccines were 
developed that combine parts of the pathogen organism with an inac-
tivated toxin protein. Because the immune system reacts more strongly 
to the toxin, it also remembers the pathogen by association.
	
✓	DNA vaccines: Work by letting muscle cells make pathogen proteins that 
the immune system then reacts to. Because there is no pathogen present 
to set up an infection, there is no risk of real illness. DNA is injected into 
muscle tissue where it’s taken up by the nuclei of muscle cells that then 
transcribe and translate it.

297
 Chapter 17: Fighting Microbial Diseases
Weighing the risk of a vaccine
The role of a vaccine is to protect the population 
from the disease in order to make the disease 
caused by the pathogen so rare that it’s almost 
never seen. Because of their success, some 
vaccines now represent a higher risk to people 
than the diseases they were designed against. 
Examples of this include the polio vaccine 
and the rabies vaccine. In the case of rabies, 
only high-risk individuals and those who sus-
pect that they have been exposed to the virus 
are vaccinated. The polio virus is transmitted 
through fecal contamination of drinking water 
and infects the throat and intestines moving to 
the central nervous system. There it attaches 
to peripheral neurons, moving up to attack and 
kill the motor neurons in the upper spinal cord. 
The oral vaccine, a live attenuated virus, was 
so effective that it eliminated polio and drove 
one of the serotypes to extinction. However, 
because it is live, it can revert to a virulent state 
in 1 in 750 000 doses, causing the disease again. 
Because the threat of the wild virus is now 
gone, this is an unacceptable threat to public 
health. As an alternative, a less-effective but 
completely safe killed polio vaccine is used in 
areas where it has been eradicated. Managing 
these risks is an important part of public health 
policy.

icrobial ecology is the study of the interactions of microorganisms 
with one another, with other organisms, and with their environment. 
Because microbes are everywhere and are too small to see unaided, scien-
tists have developed some clever methods for studying microbes in their 
natural environments, including soil, aquatic environments, the surfaces of 
plants, and even within humans.
Studying Microbial Communities
Microorganisms live in communities, in mixed populations with many different 
species coexisting together. How these communities interact affects the eco-
system and nutrient cycling on an even larger scale (see Chapter 11). To study 
these communities, scientists consider two things:
	
✓	The biodiversity of microorganisms: The number and kinds of species 
within the community
	
✓	The activities of microorganisms: Metabolic activities as well as activi-
ties involved in communication and competition
In this section, we explain how scientists study microbial communities.

302
Part VI: New Frontiers in Microbiology 
Borrowing from ecology
The study of ecology focuses on all organisms and how they interact with 
their environments, not just microorganisms. The science of ecology began 
before microorganisms were really known to exist, but many of the main 
themes from ecology are applied to microbial communities as well. For 
instance:
	
✓	Both abiotic (nonliving) and biological processes have large impacts on 
nutrient cycles in nature.
	
✓	The evolution and genetics of the organisms in an ecosystem are impor-
tant to the understanding of the ecology of that system.
	
✓	The pattern of how communities interact can’t be known or predicted 
just by understanding each species alone.
Seeing what sets microbial communities 
apart from plants and animals
Communities of microbes are similar in many respects to communities of 
plants and animals, but they differ in two important ways:
	
✓	Microorganisms move around much more than plants and animals do, 
so they get to try out a lot of new niches.
	
✓	The rate of speciation (development of new species due to mutation) is 
much higher in microorganisms than it is in plants and animals, partly 
because of microorganisms’ higher rates of mutation and because gen-
eration times can be faster than they are for larger organisms.
Both of these factors make the study of microbial ecology unique from macro 
ecology (the ecology of everything else).
Observing Communities: Microbial 
Ecology Methods
Microbial ecology is not new. Scientists have been studying bacteria in their 
natural environment since the 19th century. Some traditional techniques for 
studying microbes in the environment include enrichment culture and iso-
lation of microbes. Advancements using new technologies, combined with 
important traditional methods, can be powerful ways of teasing apart micro-
bial communities.

303
 Chapter 18: Teasing Apart Communities
In this section, we cover some of the methods used to study communities. 
This isn’t a complete list of every tool available — think of it more as a sam-
pling of some fundamental tools.
Selecting something special 
with enrichment
Enrichment is when bacterial growth media contains specific supplements 
that are required for specific organisms to grow. These supplements vary 
from organism to organism to help the one of interest grow best. Scientists 
strive to re-create as best as they can the exact growth conditions of the bac-
teria as in nature such as temperature and mineral or nutrient supplements. 
Then the media is inoculated with a sample from the environment of interest. 
If the organism is there and the conditions are right, you may get growth 
of the organism of interest. Getting the right conditions is sometimes near 
impossible and is often very challenging. For this reason, if your organism of 
interest doesn’t grow, you can’t know for sure that it wasn’t in the inoculum 
that you added — it may be that the conditions weren’t right.
In order to get only the organisms that you want, you need to select against 
the organisms that you know are there but that you don’t want. For example, 
if you’re trying to grow bacteria A, but you know that bacteria B might be 
present, you can include an unfavorable supplement for bacteria B to inhibit 
its growth but still allow bacteria A to thrive. One problem is that some 
microbes can grow more quickly than others when given a chance. If another 
microbe in your sample can take advantage of the extra resources provided 
in your enrichment culture more efficiently than your microbe of interest, it 
may outcompete it and you’ll see only the unwanted one. This is a problem 
with fungi, which are not easily selected against in some enrichment cultures 
and are experts at growing like crazy with favorable conditions.
After a successful enrichment culture has been achieved, the next step is to 
get a pure culture of the strain of interest using isolation techniques such as
	
✓	Streak plate: Using a sterile tool (loop, toothpick, stick, or swab), touch 
some bacteria. On a new agar plate, make a line to streak out the bacte-
ria. Then, with a new sterile tool, streak again through the first streak to 
draw out fewer bacteria. Repeat again and allow the bacteria to grow. By 
the third streak, single colonies normally grow.
	
✓	Dilution series: From a liquid bacterial culture, dilute a small amount 
into clean liquid media. From this dilution, take a small amount and 
make a second dilution. As more dilutions are made into new tubes, the 
number of bacterial cells gets smaller and smaller. These dilutions can 
then be plated on agar and allowed to grow to look for isolated colonies.

Part VI: New Frontiers in Microbiology 
	
✓	Agar shake: A dilution of bacteria is made as described above. Instead of 
growing on agar plates, a small amount of each dilution is added to molten 
semisolid agar media and allowed to grow in a tube while shaking. The 
semisolid nature of the media allows the bacteria to migrate through it, 
thereby making single colonies.
All these techniques rely on diluting microbial cells enough that single colo-
nies can form and be chosen. To get a pure culture of the microbe of interest, 
these methods may need to be repeated several times on the same culture to 
make sure that it in fact only contains a single organism.
Seeing cells through lenses
Microscopy can be a powerful method of looking at and making observations 
about microbial cells. Regular light microscopy can be enhanced by the addi-
tion of fluorescent dyes that bind to DNA or to cell walls, giving contrast to 
samples, especially environmental ones where the background material can 
obscure the view. Another nonspecific dye can indicate which cells are alive 
and which are dead (see Table 18-1).
	
Fluorescence is the light emitted from a protein after it has been excited by 
specific kinds of energy. In Chapter 9, we explain the different wavelengths of 
light and how each carries with it a certain amount of energy. When excited by 
light such as ultraviolet (UV) light, fluorescent proteins emit light of a different 
wavelength, giving them a different color.

Probe labels are specific proteins that will bind to a known target and then 
fluoresce, or light up, when exposed to the proper wavelength of light. 
The proteins that can be used as probe labels can also be used directly by 
genetically engineering microbial cells to express them (see Chapter 16 for 
a discussion of genetically engineering microbes). These proteins are handy 
for strains that are studied in the lab but are obviously not useful for environ-
mental samples.
	
These dyes work because, when added to a sample, they only fluoresce when 
bound to DNA. Most can enter the cells easily, but others, like the vital stain 
propidium iodide used for live/dead staining, can’t enter cells, so they’ll only 
bind to DNA outside a cell or enter through holes in the membranes of dead 
cells.
Another useful technique involves labeling only the cells based on phylogeny, 
or their evolutionary relationship. In essence this method, called fluorescent 
in situ hybridization (FISH), will light up cells of a desired microbial group 
based on their genetic similarity.
	
Ribosomes are the essential machinery for making protein in the cell. They 
themselves contain proteins but also have a core of RNA called the ribo-
somal RNA (rRNA). Because all cells need their ribosomes to survive, they’re 
conserved through evolution and don’t change that quickly. Organisms that 
are closely related will have a similar rRNA gene sequence. The more dis-
tantly related two organisms are is related to how different their rRNA gene 
sequences are. There are exceptions to these simple rules, but by and large, 
they hold true, making rRNAs and their genes useful tools for the identification 
of microbial groups and the study of microbial evolution (see Chapter 8).
FISH probes work because of the tendency of complementary nucleic acid 
sequences to bind to each other. The target sequence is the one carried 
inside the microbial cell, the sequence that is added to bind to the target 
sequence is the probe. Probe sequences are chemically attached to a fluores-
cent protein, called a tag, making them visible microscopically.
Measuring microbial activity
When researching functioning of an ecosystem it’s also important to know 
what the microorganisms are doing. There are several ways to measure 
microbial activity in a sample; some are direct measurements and others are 
indirect measurements.

306
Part VI: New Frontiers in Microbiology 
Direct measurement of activity involves measuring the products of chemical 
reactions after adding the required substrates. When the products can’t be 
measured directly or are made in very low amounts, then indirect methods 
are used. These indirect methods include the following:
	
✓	Measuring gene expression: Gene expression can be measured to see 
which genes are transcribed. This gives an indication of which proteins 
are likely being made. Methods for measuring gene expression are dis-
cussed in the next section.
	
✓	Using radioisotopes: Radioisotopes can be used to trace the fate of an 
element or the rate of conversion of an added radioactive compound. 
For instance, radioactive sulfur can be added in the form of sulfate to 
see how quickly sulfate is released as hydrogen sulfide.
	
✓	Probing stable isotopes: Stable isotope probing is similar to using radio-
isotopes, except that heavy elements are used instead of radioactive ele-
ments. Most elements in nature have heavy and light versions present in 
the environment. When glucose made from heavy carbon (C13) is fed to 
an environment expected to contain a microbe that will break down glu-
cose, then the C13 eventually makes its way into the DNA of that organism. 
Because heavy DNA can be separated from light DNA and sequenced, the 
identity of the glucose consuming microorganism can be deduced.
Identifying species using marker genes
Sequencing can be used to identify microbial species within a sample. This 
technique is done most often with bacteria, but it can also be done with any 
other type of microorganism including viruses, as long as there is a database 
available against which to compare the sequencing results. As mentioned 
earlier in the “Seeing cells through lenses” section, the 16S rRNA gene is often 
used to tell species apart. Marker genes, including 16S rRNA genes, are handy 
because
	
✓	They’re quick to amplify using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
	
✓	They’re less expensive to sequence than the entire genome.
	
✓	They can give pretty good taxonomic resolution.
A phylotype is a sequence from a molecular profile that differs from all other 
sequences in that survey by greater than 3 percent. A phylogenetic tree can 
be made based on the differences found in the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria or 
archaea. Phylogenetic trees are useful not only for identifying microorgan-
isms and thinking about their evolutionary history but also for calculating 
the amount of biodiversity in a community or ecosystem (see Chapter 8).

 Chapter 18: Teasing Apart Communities
Getting the Hang of Microbial 
Genetics and Systematics
During the molecular biology revolution, techniques like sequencing and 
genetic manipulation were great tools to study microorganisms and their 
genes and processes. The recent generation of sequencing technologies have 
provided even more tools to complement those from microbial ecology. Next-
generation sequencing has made sequencing millions of bases possible in a 
fraction of the time it used to take and at a fraction of the cost. Fast computers 
and more advanced computational algorithms have made the study of the 
DNA, RNA, and even protein of microorganisms from mixed communities 
much more feasible than ever before.
Sequencing whole genomes
Prokaryotic genomes, from bacteria and archaea, are simpler than those from 
eukaryotes, namely because they’re shorter and they don’t contain intergenic 
regions (noncoding regions of DNA that interrupt genes). For this reason, the 
sequencing and assembly of bacterial and archaeal genomes can reasonably 
be done in a short timeframe for a reasonable amount of money. Sequencing 
the genome of an organism can give you information about its core metabolic 
functions, its virulence and communication genes, and how closely related it 
is to other known genomes.
The steps involved in sequencing a bacterial genome, for instance, are as 
follows:
	
1.	 Isolating the genomic DNA from a culture of the organism of interest
	
2.	 Sequencing the isolated genomic DNA
	
3.	 Assembling the sequences
	
4.	 Annotating the genes
The effort required to accomplish this last step can sometimes be enormous. 
For this reason, many genomes are published as draft genomes, where a 
rough idea of how the genome looks is known but maybe not all the pieces 
are there and not all the genes are annotated. A complete genome is decid-
edly more work, but the end result is a reliable map of an organism’s entire 
genome that is very helpful when studying genes.

308
Part VI: New Frontiers in Microbiology 
If the organism you want to study isn’t readily grown in culture, there are 
some creative ways of getting a genome sequence. From a mixed population 
of bacteria or archaea, single cells can be isolated that either resemble or are 
shown to be from the group of interest using FISH (see “Seeing cells through 
lenses,” earlier in this chapter).
Once they’re isolated, single or small numbers of cells can be used for 
genome sequencing. The challenge here is that the small number of cells 
often don’t provide enough DNA for sequencing. To overcome this challenge, 
a whole genome amplification method can be used to increase the copies 
of the genome present. Multiple displacement application (MDA) relies on 
a viral enzyme that starts copying DNA at random places and displaces the 
other strand as it goes (see Figure 18-1).
MDA is quicker than PCR (which has to be cycled through a high temperature 
to denature the two DNA strands) and generates hundreds of copies of the 
genome of interest within minutes. One area of concern when doing MDA is 
looking out for artifacts from non-specific base pairing.
Just say –ome
Don’t be intimidated by all of the –ome words. 
These days, scientists will take any opportunity 
to make their research sound sexy and com-
plicated by adding an –omic to the end of it. 
The suffix –ome means “all of,” and the suffix 
–omic means “the study of all of.” Some –ome 
words are entrenched in the English language 
and mean something specific (think genome); 
but other –ome words are fluid and can mean 
a couple different things. In this chapter, we 
walk you through some ways of studying 
microorganisms alone or in their natural com-
munities using all the genes in one organism 
(genome), all the genes from all the microbes in 
a community (metagenome), all the RNA being 
expressed (transcriptome), all the protein in a 
cell (proteome), or all of the small molecules 
floating about a cell (metabolome).
Not everyone uses these words the same 
way. For example, to some people, the word 
proteome means “all the proteins that can 
be expressed by an organism.” To others, 
proteome means “all the proteins measured 
during an experiment.” Sometimes these –ome 
words are used to refer to something “at one 
time” and other times they’re used to refer 
to “always.” For instance, because RNA is 
sometimes expressed and other times is not 
expressed, if you measured a cell’s transcrip-
tome, you would be getting a picture of the RNA 
expressed under the conditions at the time you 
collected the RNA. As you read through the rest 
of this chapter, you become more familiar with 
and understand more clearly the different types 
of –omics studies used and their purposes.

Using metagenomics to study 
microbial communities
The word metagenomics literally means “a high-level view of genomics.” In 
practice, it means the high throughput sequencing of all the microbial genes in 
a sample. The word metagenomics is also used to mean the sequencing of any 
microbial gene(s) from DNA extracted from a sample. Metagenomics as the 
sequencing of all microbial genes in a sample differs from the whole-genome 
sequencing of an organism in that it’s applied to a community of microbes and 
not just a single microorganism, and there is no genome assembly step.
The list of genes present in a sample provides an estimate to how the com-
munity is functioning. It can indicate which enzymatic processes were likely 
taking place in that community and what kinds of competition and coopera-
tion were taking place as well. One feature that microbiologists often look for 
when analyzing the metagenomic data for a bacterial community is the pres-
ence of genes that encode antibiotic-resistance. Recently metagenomic studies 
have found that antibiotic resistance is found nearly everywhere we look. It’s 
enriched in bacterial communities that are exposed often to antibiotics like 
hospitals and farm animals.
Also, identifying organisms is a lot easier when you have more than just one 
marker gene. Although this is true for simple communities where the mem-
bers are well known, with many environmental samples the microbes in them 
are often unknown so representatives of these communities won’t be in a 
reference database. Metagenomic analysis is the only way of knowing about 
the presence of these organisms and how similar or different they are from 
known bacteria or archaea.

Part VI: New Frontiers in Microbiology 
Reading microbial transcriptomics
Transcription is the process of making mRNA from DNA for the purpose of 
making proteins in the cell. Transcriptomics, then, is the sequencing of all the 
RNA in a sample for the purpose of measuring how much of each gene in a 
community is being expressed. Again, this is different from measuring the 
levels of RNA from one strain — instead, it’s a measurement of all the RNA 
made by all the microbes in a sample.
Transcriptomics is different from metagenomics because it tells you which 
genes are being expressed and at what levels. There are a few different 
technologies that measure transcriptional differences between groups of 
microbes, each of which takes advantage of reverse transcriptase (the ability 
of a viral enzyme to copy RNA into DNA). The product of a reverse transcrip-
tase reaction is called complementary DNA (cDNA) to distinguish it from 
genomic DNA.
The following are the methods currently used to study transcriptomics:
	
✓	RNAseq: RNAseq is similar to metagenomics, but instead of isolating 
the DNA from a sample, the RNA is isolated. This RNA is converted into 
cDNA using a reverse transcriptase and then sequenced as usual.
	
✓	Microarrays: Microarrays measure the abundance of cDNA, too, but 
instead of sequencing everything, it takes advantage of the tendency 
of two strands of complementary DNA to hybridize to one another. 
One strand is the single-stranded cDNA, and the other strand is chemi-
cally synthesized and attached to a solid surface. The cDNA is also 
fluorescently labeled so that it can be read using a fluorescent scanner. 
Sometimes two samples are compared to one another by labeling the 
cDNA from each with a different color.
	
✓	Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR): qPCR uses PCR to amplify a signal from 
a small amount of template RNA. The RT part of the name stands for 
reverse transcriptase, and the quantitative part means that as the copies 
of DNA are made during each cycle of PCR, their numbers are measured. 
By calculating back from the number of copies of DNA made, you can 
get a fairly accurate estimate of how much RNA you started with. This 
method is sensitive and fairly quick, but it has to be done on the tran-
script of each gene individually.
	
✓	Nanostring: Nanostring is a brand-new technology that has the sensitiv-
ity of qPCR and the capability of doing many genes like microarrays or 
RNAseq. You have to know which genes you’re interested in ahead of 
time and have probes designed for each one, but unlike in a microarray, 
the probes are not attached to a surface. Instead, the mRNA and the 
nanostring probe hybridize directly and only those that form the hybrid-
ized complex are kept and counted.

 Chapter 18: Teasing Apart Communities
Figuring out proteomics and metabolomics
Microorganisms change the proteins they make depending on their environ-
ment and how they’re interacting with it. In order to look at which proteins 
are being made under certain conditions, proteomic techniques are used.
	
The genome can tell you a lot about which proteins a microorganism has. 
Because each gene encodes a protein, you may assume that by listing all the 
genes you could get a sense of the processes going on in the cell, but it’s a 
bit more complicated than that. Genes are transcribed into mRNA at differ-
ent rates and only when needed. Then not all mRNA molecules are made into 
protein. Measuring all the protein present in a cell at one time gives you infor-
mation about how the cell is interacting with its environment under those 
specific conditions.
Two main proteomic techniques work well when used hand in hand (see 
Figure 18-2):
	
Figure 18-2: 
The use of 
2D gels and 
mass spec-
trometry in 
proteomics.
	
	
✓	2D gels: The proteins are extracted from a pure culture of a microbial 
strain and separated by both their charge and their size. The different 
amino acids used to assemble a protein sequence have different charges 
that impart on the final protein an overall charge (see Chapter 6). Also, 
because proteins vary greatly in length, they have a range of sizes as 
well. When finished, a 2D gel looks like the side of a Dalmatian, and pat-
terns between gels can be compared. Each spot can be extracted from 
the gel and used for mass spectrometry.
	
✓	Mass spectrometry: A protein sample is first digested into small pep-
tides. Then the amino acid sequence of these peptides is calculated with 
mass spectrometry, which uses very sensitive mass calculations for each 
of the elements in each amino acid and gives a spectrum, or pattern, that 
is unique to each peptide. To identify the protein of interest, the spectra 
produced are compared to those for a standard set of known proteins.

312
Part VI: New Frontiers in Microbiology 
Even when you know something about the proteins present in a cell at a given 
time, it isn’t always easy to infer the metabolism of the cell. Metabolomics is 
the study of all the metabolic products and intermediates present in a cell. 
Metabolites are small organic molecules that move in and out of the cell and 
are the substrates, the products, or the intermediates of chemical reactions 
going on. There are many more metabolites than there are proteins, RNA, 
or DNA molecules, so metabolomics is the trickiest thing to study about 
microorganisms.
Looking for Microbial Dark Matter
With the many tools at our disposal to study microbial communities in nature, 
you’d think that we’d know everything there is to know about the bacteria, 
archaea, and eukaryotic microbes that we share the planet with. The truth is, 
there are still many species of bacteria and archaea that have yet to be discov-
ered. Based on culture-independent methods (methods based on sequencing 
the DNA from microorganisms alone), scientists have found that there are far 
more species of prokaryotes left to be described than originally estimated. 
Shockingly, it seems that only the tip of the iceberg in terms of bacterial and 
archaeal species have been identified, and fewer still have been cultured.
Modeling proteins
Based on the genetic sequence, assumptions 
can be made about the function of the proteins 
that the genes code for. These assumptions are 
made based on how similar a gene is to genes 
that are known from other organisms and 
where the activity has been tested. If the gene 
is very similar, like more than 70 percent identi-
cal, it’s likely that they have the same function. 
If the gene is not that similar, its structure can 
still be modeled based on the structure of pro-
teins that are known with much less than 70 
percent identity.
Modeling a protein can give important informa-
tion about a protein, such as where its binding 
site is, which amino acids are in its binding site, 
and what other features of the structure of the 
protein may affect its function (for example, 
a cofactor binding site). We can’t predict the 
structure of a protein based on its amino acid 
sequence so someone has to have experimen-
tally measured the structure of a similar protein 
using a technique called x-ray crystallography.

he applied use of microorganisms goes back to the early days of agri-
culture and the use of fermentation for food production. Through a 
process of trial and error, humans have selected for microbes that are useful 
to us — for example, microbes that impart special flavors to our favorite 
cheeses, beers, and wines. At the same time, scientists have realized that 
microbes are perfect for studying the inner wiring of the cell. The facts that 
they’re unicellular, they’re easy to grow in a lab, and they have fewer genes 
than eukaryotic cells make them great for learning things like how and when 
DNA is turned into protein and how these proteins allow a cell to grow and 
divide. From painstaking genetic experiments that mapped how each gene in 
a cell functioned was born the molecular cloning era, when it became routine 
to isolate and make copies of DNA fragments in the lab, move the fragments 
from one cell to another, and even tweak the DNA sequences to see the con-
sequence of mutations.
Synthetic biology is the merging of the area of applied microbiology and 
molecular cloning. Instead of looking for organisms that can do specific func-
tions, why not just make an organism that does it? Synthetic biology began 
with the first experiments where we could move DNA between organisms 
and later evolved into isolating and cloning DNA. As tools for manipulating 
and synthesizing large fragments of DNA became available, synthetic biology 
really began to take off.
In this chapter, we examine how simple systems to control gene expression 
in bacteria can be rewired to make the cells work for us by making specific 
proteins. Using parts from these simple systems, more elaborate systems are 
built and the field of synthetic biology has emerged.

Regulating Genes: The lac Operon
Because cellular functions are directly linked to the proteins made by a cell, 
control of gene expression gives you control over how a cell behaves. Another 
term for the control over when and how genes are expressed is the regulation 
of gene expression or simply regulation. Regulation of gene expression in bac-
teria was first discovered for the lactose degrading system, in a group of genes 
called the lac operon. The lac operon is the poster child for gene regulation 
systems because it has been extensively studied, is well understood, and has 
been intentionally altered to change how it behaves. The lac operon contains 
genes for the import and breakdown of the sugar lactose, and its expression is 
regulated by the lac promoter.
	
All the genes needed to import and use lactose are grouped together into what 
is called an operon, where they’re all transcribed together from a single pro-
moter (Plac).
Using a good natural system
Lactose is a sugar found in the environment. Bacteria take lactose into the 
cell to use for energy. It’s a fairly large molecule, so bacteria must use a trans-
port protein to get it across the membrane. The transport protein is called a 
permease. As lactose trickles into the cell through the permease, an enzyme 
called β-galactosidase converts it into two other sugars that are easier for the 
cell to digest: glucose and galactose.
At the same time, a small amount of the lactose is converted to allolactose. 
Allolactose is not used for energy; instead, it acts as a signal of how much lac-
tose is in the cell. It does this by binding to a protein called the lac repressor 
(see Figure 19-1) and inactivating it. The lac repressor (LacI) is a protein that 
acts as an on/off switch for the expression of genes involved in the utilization 
of lactose.
The lac repressor binds to the lac promoter and blocks the RNA polymerase 
from transcribing the permease and β-galactosidase genes. When levels of 
lactose are high, allolactose is made and binds to the lac repressor, which 
stops it from repressing the lac operon. The system is then induced and the 
genes in the lac operon are transcribed. This system allows the cell to control 
the expression of the genes for lactose utilization.

315
 Chapter 19: Synthesizing Life
Figure 19-1: 
The lac 
operon and 
controlled 
induction.
	
François Jacob and Jacques Monod, French scientists, were pioneers in the 
study of the regulation of gene expression. To help with their experiments, 
they wanted to turn the system on without needing lactose or its permease. 
They screened through a collection of small molecule compounds and came 
across isopropyl β–D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), which diffuses into E. 
coli without the need for the permease and binds to the lac repressor, turning 
on the lac operon.
There are a few features of the lac operon worth noting from a design 
perspective:
	
✓	Leakiness of the lac operon is essential. You need some low-level 
expression to have a little permease in the membrane to get some 
lactose into the cell and then some β–galactosidase to make some allo-
lactose in order to get the system to turn on in the presence of lactose. 
If the system was really off, it wouldn’t be able to be induced because 
lactose would never get into the cell. So, if you wanted to build a system 
with a true off state, the natural lac system would not be a good choice.

316
Part VI: New Frontiers in Microbiology 
	
✓	The system behaves in a positive feedback loop. A little lactose gets in 
the cell initially through a few lac permeases, which then turn on the lac 
operon and make more lac permease and more allolactose and more lac 
permease and so on. This positive feedback loop means you can’t get 
levels of expression of the lac operon that are directly proportional to 
the levels of lactose: It’s an all-or-nothing system.
	
✓	The lac promoter is not all that strong and is not good if you want to 
make lots of a product.
	
It’s important to note that these properties are not “design flaws” in the lac 
operon but essential features that make the lac operon work well in E. coli in 
its natural environment.
Improving a good system
The study of the lac operon was the foundation of scientists’ understanding 
the regulation of gene expression (and it brought the Nobel Prize to François 
Jacob, Andre Lwoff, and Jacques Monod), but there were also direct appli-
cations of the lac system. Any gene could be placed downstream of the lac 
promoter and induced by the addition of the chemical inducer IPTG (mean-
ing that foreign proteins could be expressed in E. coli). This original system 
for gene expression wasn’t ideal — the lac promoter wasn’t that strong when 
fully induced and there was always some expression “leaking” through when 
it was supposed to be turned off.
To solve the low expression problem, a stronger lac promoter was found, 
through a process of making stressful conditions that only allow bacteria 
with a stronger lac promoter to grow, called selection. After selecting for a 
stronger promoter, the problem of leaky expression was tackled by increasing 
the amount of repressor present through overexpression, which is where the 
cell makes the repressor at levels much higher than it would naturally.
With these changes, the lac expression system became very useful for the 
overexpressing proteins in E. coli needed to purify and study them, as well as 
in biotechnology (see Chapter 16).

317
 Chapter 19: Synthesizing Life
With the ideas from the lac system in mind, scientists designed an overex-
pression system in the 1980s that is still widely used today. The expression 
system was based not on bacterial genes but on the genes from the T7 bac-
teriophage. This bacteriophage encodes its own RNA polymerase, and when 
the phage infects a host bacterial cell, this polymerase is so active that soon 
almost all the mRNA in the cell is from the virus, ensuring that only T7 pro-
teins are made.
Here are the features of T7 bacteriophage that make it so useful for protein 
expression:
	
✓	T7 RNA polymerase is fast — faster than the native E. coli RNA poly-
merase acting in the host cell — so it quickly outcompetes the E. coli 
RNA polymerase for resources and makes a lot of mRNA quickly.
	
✓	T7 RNA polymerase only recognizes T7 promoters, making it very spe-
cific for its target.
	
✓	T7 promoters (PT7) are very different from E. coli promoters, so the 
T7 RNA polymerase doesn’t ever transcribe from E. coli promoters by 
mistake.
	
When the gene for a protein of interest is put behind a T7 promoter in a cell 
expressing the T7 RNA polymerase, the cell makes that protein almost exclu-
sively. In the same way that expressing all phage proteins is bad for the host 
cell, overexpressing a protein of interest with the T7 RNA polymerase system 
is very toxic to the cell. To stop this from happening, the system has to be 
controlled so that expression of the target gene can be turned off until it’s 
deliberately turned on.
To make the T7 system controllable, the expression of the T7 RNA poly-
merase was placed under control of the lac promoter and repressed by the 
lac repressor. In this way, target protein expression could be turned on only 
after cells had grown normally to a high cell density. The on switch was pro-
vided by IPTG added to the now large batch of cells, inducing the expression 
of T7 RNA polymerase that soon made lots of mRNA and subsequently large 
amounts of target protein.
The use of a combination of the lac operon and T7 genes, summarized in 
Figure 19-2, revolutionized protein expression and purification in bacteria.

Once turned on, this system is very toxic, so E. coli cells will mutate to over-
come the detrimental effects, effectively breaking the system. This is an 
important limitation to synthetic biology — biological systems are inherently 
unstable.
Remember: Mutation and selection (that is, evolution) are intrinsic features 
of all biological systems.
	
Of course, if the right selection is used in the lab, this limitation becomes an 
asset that can be exploited to improve the performance of an engineered 
system.
	
Biological systems can also be “noisy” — their properties can change with 
time and between cells even in the absence of a major stress like overexpres-
sion of large amounts of foreign protein.

Synthetic biology merges the fields of biology, engineering, and even math-
ematical modeling to design new genetic regulatory systems, re-engineer 
proteins and metabolic pathways, and even potentially build new organisms 
from scratch. The first real forays into synthetic biology were to construct 
genetic regulatory networks with specific behaviors.
The examples in this section define simple systems or modules that can be 
used to design more elaborate systems. They serve to illustrate the basics 
and show how some simple designs are part of more complex circuits.
Switching from one state to another
One of the first synthetic genetic networks designed was inspired by bacte-
riophage lambda (λ). This phage can integrate into the genome of its host 
cell, called a temperate phage, and exist as a stable lysogen (see Chapter 14). 
A lysogen may be maintained for generations or induced into a lytic state, 
where the phage DNA is excised, replicated, and packaged into new phage 
particles. This system of lysogeny versus lytic states is not controlled by 
a simple on/off regulation but by a system of dual repressors (CRO and 
cI repressors) each inhibiting the expression of the other. The result is a 
bistable switch that can be stable in one state or another and switches 
between them.
Not so alike after all
A tube of culture in the lab, containing billions 
of bacteria, is often thought of as completely 
homogeneous. That is, all the cells within it 
are thought of as identical little clones of each 
other, behaving alike. In theory, they should be, 
because they presumably all come from one cell. 
But as it turns out, this isn’t entirely true. Cells in 
a seemingly homogeneous population will have 
different levels of gene expression — from a 
synthetic biology perspective this is an impor-
tant point. Perhaps not surprisingly, the lac 
operon and synthetic biology are featured in the 
history of understanding cell-to-cell variability in 
populations.
In an elegant but often forgotten paper by 
Aaron Novick and Milton Weiner in 1958, 
they show heterogeneity in single cells 
within a population of E. coli with respect to 
the lac operon and all-or-none induction of 
the lac operon. And in more contemporary 
times, Michael Elowitz and colleagues have 
used green fluorescent protein (GFP)–based 
reporters to explore heterogeneity in E. coli 
cells, in part motivated by results of their own 
synthetic biology experiments and not getting 
the consistent behavior from the designed sys-
tems that they would have liked.

Part VI: New Frontiers in Microbiology 
A synthetic system built on this idea uses a temperature sensitive version of 
the λ cI repressor and the lac repressor (LacI). The cI repressor gene also has 
a GFP gene as part of the same operon, so when the system is on, the cells 
turn fluorescent green. This system uses two signals to switch states, shown 
in Figure 19-3:
	
✓	Temperature: The temperature-sensitive cI repressor is inactivated at 
37°C.
	
✓	IPTG: When added, this compound inactivates the lac repressor.
	
Figure 19-3: 
Bistable 
switches.
	
This simple system can be coupled to other genes to control cell functions, 
and scientists can switch the cells from one state to the other quickly by 
either changing the temperature or adding IPTG.
Oscillating between states
A more elaborate synthetic regulator network that was one of the early sys-
tems built was the repressilator. Many biological systems have oscillatory 
behavior — for example, circadian clocks that control gene expression on a 
24-hour cycle.

321
 Chapter 19: Synthesizing Life
	
Intriguingly, most circadian clocks — from simple cyanobacteria to our own 
clocks — are not regulated simply by light and darkness. That’s why getting 
over jet lag is so difficult when we travel across many time zones — our inter-
nal clock is not easily reset by the new light/dark cycle.
Michael Elowitz and colleagues set out to design a simple oscillating genetic 
network. Whereas a two-repressor network can exist in bistable states, a 
three-repressor (or any odd number) system can oscillate if the parameters 
are just right. The repressilator (see Figure 19-4) was constructed with a 
gene for GFP under the control of the tetracycline repressor (TetR) that also 
repressed the synthesis of the lac repressor (LacI), which repressed the syn-
thesis of the bacteriophage lambda repressor (λ cI), which in turn repressed 
the synthesis of TetR. The cells alternatively expressed and repressed the 
expression of GFP, creating an oscillation of fluorescence.
	
Figure 19-4: 
The 
repressilator.
	
One design feature that was critical for this system to work is that the repres-
sors had to have short half-lives. Once they’re made, repressor proteins usu-
ally hang around a while, causing long periods of repression of their target 
promoter. For the repressilator to work, the repressor proteins have to be 
broken down quickly so that the genes can be de-repressed. To make the 
repressors less stable, ssrA degradation tags can be added to them.

322
Part VI: New Frontiers in Microbiology 
Keeping signals short
In bacteria, if there is a problem during the formation of a protein — for 
instance, if the ribosome stalls — there is a system in place to get rid of the 
unfinished protein. The peptide can’t be released from the ribosome until a 
short amino acid sequence, called a tag, is added to the end of the peptide 
chain. Afterward, the tagged peptide is directed to the proteolytic machin-
ery and quickly destroyed. Although the natural tag is 11 amino acids long, 
it turns out that just adding the last 3 amino acids (LAA) works just as well. 
This is called an ssrA tag (short for small stable RNA A) and is a handy tool in 
synthetic biology. By changing the tag sequence (to AAV or LVA), the amount 
of time it takes to degrade the protein can be tweaked, giving you control 
over how long a repressor will be around after it has been made, for instance.
The Synthetic Biologist’s Toolbox
Engineers love to build things. Imagine that instead of a toolbox full of wires, 
resistors, switches, and other bins and bobs, they have one filled with tran-
scriptional regulators, promoters, and engineered genetic networks, each 
with a function similar to a switch, a blinking light, or other functions not 
possible with inanimate objects made from metal and plastic. These biologi-
cal parts can be used to rewire cells to carry out all sorts of novel functions. 
Synthetic biology has expanded into more complex eukaryotic systems such 
as yeast with a toolbox similar to that developed for bacteria.
Making it modular
Although on paper these systems seemed straightforward to build, it takes 
quite a bit of effort to build them from scratch, and early synthetic biol-
ogy systems were done by trial and error, with lots of blood, sweat, and 
tears! For this reason, a collection of synthetic biology “parts” — also called 
BioBricks — and protocols is available and can be distributed to anyone look-
ing to build things from living parts.
Several resources exist to help you get started:
	
✓	The iGem Registry of Standard Biological Parts (http://parts.
igem.org/Frequently_Used_Parts): A synthetic biology toolkit of 
well-characterized parts, including operators, promoters, and regula-
tors, that continues to grow.

323
 Chapter 19: Synthesizing Life
	
✓	The BioBricks Foundation (www.biobricks.org): An organization 
dedicated to making synthetic biology open to everyone and to keeping 
it ethical and safe.
	
✓	OpenWetWare (www.openwetware.org): A place to share information, 
look for help, and get inspired to build things.
With a toolkit in hand, you can start to design all sorts of interesting net-
works. This inspired Drew Endy and colleagues to start an undergraduate 
competition to do just that, the iGEM competition.
Participating in the iGEM competition
The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition is an 
international synthetic biology competition that gives university students the 
opportunity to use the tools of synthetic biology to design and operate novel 
genetic systems in microbes. Teams from universities around the world are 
given BioBricks from the iGEM repository, or tasked with creating their own 
building blocks, and then they combine them in a way such that they perform 
a new function. Teams present their projects at the annual meeting and com-
pete for recognition of executing the best project.
An iGEM project involves selecting a problem to tackle, brainstorming solu-
tions using synthetic biology, and then executing the science. Along the 
way, teams are encouraged to participate in community outreach and con-
sider the public’s perception of their development. Teams must ask them-
selves, “Would the public consider their inventions safe?” and “Would they 
approve of its use?”
The iGEM competition is by no means your typical science fair. Students flex 
their scientific muscles and show up with high-quality creations. By tweaking 
genetic networks and moving genes around between microbes, students have 
used synthetic biology to provide solutions to a variety of fields. The follow-
ing are examples of projects presented at iGEM competitions:
	
✓	The use of microbes to create building material, in a process called 
biocementation, in space so that we don’t have to transport large and 
heavy bricks to habitable planets in the future (Brown and Stanford 
universities).
	
✓	Engineered worms that sense and migrate to environmental pollutants, 
like toxic material in oil sands, and then take up and digest the toxic 
material a way that safely removes it from the environment, a process 
called bioremediation (Queens University, Canada).

324
Part VI: New Frontiers in Microbiology 
	
✓	A “smart” drug delivery system that links engineered E. coli with drug-
containing nanoparticles, such that E. coli senses when it arrives in a 
certain environment and produces the enzyme needed to release the 
drug from the nanoparticle (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 
Switzerland).
	
✓	The creation of light-sensitive bacteria that act as photographic film. 
The team engineered typical E. coli to produce a black chemical unless 
it’s exposed to light. Shining a patterned light onto a plate of bacteria 
created an image with a resolution of 100 megapixels (University of 
California, San Francisco, and the University of Texas).

Caused by Microbes

M
 
icrobes play critical roles in human and animal health, maintaining 
ecosystems, and driving major geochemical processes. They inhabit 
every environment on earth, from the bland to the extreme. However, most 
people equate microbes or “germs” with disease. There is no shortage of 
microbes that cause disease; some are notable for the number of people they 
infect, and others for the nastiness of the infections they cause.
The interaction of people with pathogens has shaped the course of human 
history. Although it’s tempting to think of them as the bad old days, many 
of the same things that plagued people hundreds of years ago remain poten-
tial threats today. Travel between continents was responsible for bringing 
devastating infectious diseases to the New World, and it’s still a risk today 
as unprecedented numbers of people move around in our highly connected 
world. Air travel means we can reach any corner of the globe in 24 to 48 
hours. It also means that microbes can reach us from anywhere on earth just 
as quickly. The threat of great epidemics is still here, despite great advances 
in treating and preventing infectious disease.
As we push deeper into remote areas of the world, the risk of new pathogens 
jumping from other species to humans, called zoonotic infection, also increases. 
Zoonotic infections can be nasty — the more balanced relationship that was 
there between the natural host and the pathogen is gone.

328
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
In this chapter, we list ten nasty microbes, including
	
✓	Pathogens that have been with mankind for thousands of years
	
✓	Pathogens tamed with vaccines and antimicrobials that are reemerging 
threats due to resistance
	
✓	Emerging pathogens that are new threats to man, often as zoonotic infec-
tions that have jumped from other host species
Ebola
Ebola is one of the most lethal viruses to infect humans, with a mortality rate 
reaching 90 percent in some outbreaks. Ebola is one of two known filoviruses 
that cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. First identified in 1976 in the 
Congo near the Ebola River, infections by this filovirus have been confined 
to small outbreaks in isolated regions of central west Africa. Fruit bats are 
considered the natural host, but contaminated wild meat may be the source 
of initial infection. The virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids of 
infected people or animals.
What makes Ebola so nasty is that the virus can be in a person unnoticed for 
around 21 days. But when symptoms begin to show, the disease progresses 
rapidly, starting with fever, fatigue, muscle pain, and headache, and ending with 
vomiting, diarrhea, internal bleeding, and often external bleeding. Because of 
the virus’s long incubation period, containing an outbreak can be challenging. 
Apparently healthy people travel into new areas where they eventually get sick, 
and if they aren’t isolated immediately, others can become infected. Cultural 
practices of gathering groups of people around the deceased at burial ceremo-
nies haven’t helped matters — infection is spread most quickly during the last 
stages of the disease.
Anthrax
Bacillus anthracis, which causes the disease known as anthrax, is a Gram-
positive sporulating bacteria that gets its name from the distinct coal-like, 
black tissue that is shed from a skin infection (anthrakis is Greek for coal). It’s 
primarily associated with infections of grazing animals — spores can persist 
in the soil for decades. In humans, three types of infections are observed:

329
 Chapter 20: Ten (Or So) Diseases Caused by Microbes
	
✓	Cutaneous anthrax is easily diagnosed by its characteristic skin lesions 
and is easily treated.
	
✓	Gastrointestinal anthrax arises from eating infected undercooked 
meat. This form of anthrax is uncommon and can be effectively treated. 
However, because it presents initially like typical food poisoning, it’s 
often not identified in time and consequently has a high mortality rate.
	
✓	Inhalation anthrax, from breathing in spores, was once confined to 
the tanning industry when spores would be released from the hides of 
infected animals. Patients initially present with flulike symptoms, but the 
disease rapidly progresses after about 48 hours to an acute illness fol-
lowed by coma and death in up to 95 percent of infected individuals.
The potential to weaponize anthrax spores was realized early and is a major 
concern. The largest outbreak of inhalation anthrax occurred in 1979 in 
Sverdlovsk, in the former Soviet Union, downwind of a military complex; it 
resulted in up to 105 deaths. In late 2001, up to 6 letters containing anthrax 
spores were mailed to U.S. politicians, resulting in 11 cases of inhalation 
anthrax (5 deaths) and 11 cutaneous anthrax cases. The potential impact of 
aerosolized spores on a concentrated population could be devastating, and 
the threat of anthrax as a biological weapon is real.
Influenza
How often do you hear someone complain about being sick a couple days 
with the flu? More often, this is probably just the common cold. The real flu 
is a serious illness with fever, headaches, and fatigue lasting for many days. 
The flu is caused by the influenza virus and occurs seasonally throughout 
the world — it’s always flu season somewhere! Each year, the seasonal flu 
is responsible for up 5 million severe cases and half a million deaths. It can 
be particularly hard on the young and the elderly, although a recent flu was 
more severe in young adults. New flu viruses arise each year, so one year’s flu 
vaccine is usually not effective the following year.
About three times each century, a flu pandemic occurs, which spreads more 
effectively and is more virulent. The 1918–1920 flu pandemic, also called the 
Spanish flu, was thought to have killed 20 million to 100 million people.
	
The way that we keep track of influenza strains is by naming them for the 
different variants of two viral coat proteins — hemagglutinin (H) and neur-
aminidase (N) — to which numbers are assigned. The 1918 pandemic, as well 
as illness caused in 2009–2010, for example, were both caused by H1N1 viruses.

330
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
The flu virus usually spreads through contact or aerosols from coughing or 
sneezing patients, but some, like the avian flu (H5N1), can be carried by birds 
with the obvious potential to spread very rapidly around the world. Although 
it did not turn into the next big pandemic, H5N1 was highly pathogenic in 
humans and birds.
Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis (TB) is a global epidemic and a leading cause of morbidity 
and mortality throughout the world. Each year, it infects up to 9 million 
people and is responsible for over 1.5 million deaths. Once infected with 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, about 5 percent of people will develop active 
disease within five years; the remaining 95 percent will have a latent infection 
that can persist for decades, later becoming activated in about 5 percent of 
these individuals. With treatment, the mortality rate is less than 2 percent, 
but without treatment mortality rates are much higher.
A major change that has increased the severity of TB is the emergence of 
multidrug-resistant strains. These strains of M. tuberculosis are resistant to 
the antibiotics that were previously most effective against it, rifampicin and 
isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) comes from strains that 
are resistant to all the most potent antibiotics, making them the most difficult 
to treat. Almost half a million multidrug-resistant TB cases and an increasing 
number of XDR-TB strains are occurring each year, making an untreatable 
epidemic of TB a real possibility if new drugs are not discovered.
HIV
As its name suggests, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects 
immune cells. The immune suppression caused by HIV infection makes 
patients vulnerable to secondary infections from other bacteria, viruses, 
fungi, or protozoa. It’s these secondary infections that cause problems for 
those infected with HIV — they become hard to treat as the patient’s immune 
system deteriorates. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) applies 
to the most advanced stages of HIV infection where secondary infections are 
often fatal.
In 2012, it was estimated that 35 million people were living with HIV, with more 
than 2 million new infections and 1.6 million deaths per year. Secondary TB 
infections are attributed to about 25 percent of all HIV-related deaths. The virus 
is spread through sexual contact, bodily fluids, and contaminated needles.

331
 Chapter 20: Ten (Or So) Diseases Caused by Microbes
AIDS first emerged in the 1980s as a disease with an unknown cause, spreading 
through the homosexual male community before scientists identified the caus-
ative agent. Today, HIV infection is not restricted to gay men; in fact, women 
are the fastest-growing group of newly infected individuals.
Anti-retroviral therapy is effective in managing HIV infections, but it’s costly 
and widely available only in the developed world. Although these drugs have 
made HIV a largely manageable disease in the developed world, AIDS remains 
a devastating epidemic in many parts of the world.
Cholera
Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease, caused by the waterborne bacterium 
Vibrio cholerae. Every year, it affects 3 million to 5 million people and leads to 
up to 200,000 deaths. The rapid dehydration can be lethal within hours, but it 
can be effectively treated with oral rehydration therapy. Of course, rehydra-
tion therapy can be challenging because the disease is associated with poor 
sanitation and poor water quality. There have been 7 major cholera pandem-
ics around the world in the last 200 years that have resulted in tens of mil-
lions of deaths.
John Snow, a London physician, is credited with starting the science of epi-
demiology. He mapped cholera cases in London in the 1850s and observed 
that they all clustered around the Broad Street public water pump. The pump 
handle was removed, and this was attributed to the decline of cholera in this 
epidemic. In places where V. cholerae lives naturally, outbreaks can often 
follow natural disasters where damage to infrastructure can prevent access 
to clean water.
Smallpox
The smallpox virus, Variola major, has been a significant pathogen through-
out human history and has been responsible for major epidemics in the past. 
It’s particularly noteworthy, however, because it represents a remarkable suc-
cess story in the eradication of infectious disease. A concerted international 
effort that started in the 1960s was declared successful in 1980. Smallpox was 
the first and only major infectious human disease to be eradicated from natu-
ral transmission.

332
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
This was the culmination of the pioneering work of Edward Jenner, who dem-
onstrated the efficacy of a cowpox virus as an effective vaccine for smallpox 
virus at the end of the 18th century. Smallpox virus is now thought to exist 
only in laboratory collections. However, the threat of smallpox as a biological 
weapon has renewed interest in continuing to develop newer vaccines in the 
event of a manmade outbreak of small pox.
Primary Amoebic Menigoencephalitis
Bacteria and viruses are most of what comes to mind when people think of 
nasty microbes, but there are many examples of other types of organisms 
that can be particularly nasty. Of the small number of opportunistic amoeba 
pathogens, Naegleria fowleri deserves special attention because it’s known as 
the “brain-eating amoeba.” This free-living freshwater amoeba finds its way 
into the nasal passages of its host and then eats its way along the olfactory 
nerve and makes its way along the nerve fibers into the brain, where it feasts. 
It causes a condition called primary amoebic menigoencephalitis (PAM), a 
very rare disease but one that can affect any individual and is acquired from 
fresh water, including swimming pools.
Multidrug-resistant superbugs
Although not a specific pathogen, an increas-
ing concern is the emergence of multidrug-
resistant bacteria, also called superbugs. The 
sharp decline of infectious disease in the last 
half of the 20th century can be attributed to 
improved hygiene and water quality, vaccines, 
and antimicrobial drugs. These drugs were so 
effective, in fact, that in the late 1960s it was 
widely thought that infectious diseases — and 
bacterial infections in particular — had been 
defeated. Yet the victory didn’t last.
Most antimicrobial drugs are made by other 
microbes, or modifications of them. Microbes 
have been in chemical warfare with each other 
for hundreds of millions of years, and while we 
have exploited these microbial chemical weap-
ons to target pathogens, the pathogens have 
gained resistance genes that make the drugs 
ineffective. Widespread use of antibiotics in 
agriculture and misuse in medicine have accel-
erated the spread of resistance. Early in 2014, 
the World Health Organization declared that 
antimicrobial resistance is a threat to global 
public health. Resistance may soon move 
us into a post-antibiotic era where common 
everyday infections and minor injuries will be 
untreatable and death rates not seen for five or 
six generations will return.

333
 Chapter 20: Ten (Or So) Diseases Caused by Microbes
Symptoms appear within a week of exposure and start out as the loss of 
the senses of smell and taste, followed by generic symptoms of headache, 
vomiting, and fever, and ending with confusion, hallucinations, and seizures. 
Infections with N. fowleri are almost always lethal; death occurs one to two 
weeks after the initial symptoms appear.
The Unknown
Perhaps one of the most frightening and nastiest of the microbes may be the 
ones we don’t know about and can’t prepare for. Organizations like the World 
Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control are constantly 
on the alert for new emerging pathogens, yet these pathogens can still appear 
without warning. The lack of vaccines or therapies to deal with these new 
threats to human health makes them very dangerous. Two recent examples 
of zoonotic viral outbreaks are good examples of this.
In 2002, an outbreak of an unusual pneumonia, which became known as 
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), infected more than 8,700 people 
and killed almost 800 in southern China. It spread within weeks to 37 coun-
tries. Many of the deaths were in medical staff treating patients before the 
nature of the epidemic had been established. Infections from the SARS-
coronavirus had a mortality of almost 10 percent. Almost as quickly as it 
emerged, the epidemic was contained; it’s now considered a rare disease. 
This zoonotic virus likely made the jump to humans associated with the wild 
animal trade and has been found in civets, raccoon dogs, and ferret badgers.
In 2012, the first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was 
described in Saudi Arabia, caused by the MERS-coronavirus. It is believed to 
have originated in camels. The numbers of MERS cases are slowly increas-
ing (unlike the rapid emergence of SARS). Although MERS may not become 
as severe a threat as SARS was, another SARS or much worse is out there 
waiting for an opportunity to jump to a new host.

Ten Great Uses for Microbes
In This Chapter
▶	Seeing microbial processes in your everyday life
▶	Benefiting from microbial fermentation
▶	Maintaining a balance in your garden and your belly
B
 
ecause we usually can’t see the microorganisms all around us every 
day, it’s easy to overlook them. But in this chapter, we fill you in on ten 
ways that microbes affect our lives in important ways.
Making Delicious Foods
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used for millennia because 
it ferments sugars and makes carbon dioxide, which causes bread to rise. 
Commercial yeast, which is sold at the grocery store, is convenient because 
it acts quickly and predictably every time. One tasty kind of bread called 
sourdough is made using natural or wild yeasts instead of commercial yeast. 
Wild yeasts are present everywhere — they need only a little encouragement 
to start the fermentation process. Wild yeasts prefer more acidic conditions 
and grow more slowly than commercial yeast, so the bread they produce has 
a more acidic, complex, and (some would say) delicious flavor than other 
breads.
The lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, are used in 
making fermented milk products. Buttermilk, sour cream, cheese, and yogurt 
are made by letting these bacteria ferment milk to different degrees. After 
the initial stages of milk fermentation, several other kinds of microbes can 
be added to give cheeses their distinct flavor. Blue cheeses are inoculated 
with species of fungi to give them their sharp flavor and colorful veining, but 
another example is the use of Proprionibacteria to make Swiss cheese.

336
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Microorganisms are also responsible for the pickling process. Species of 
Lactobacillus are happy in very acidic conditions, so they’re almost always 
there at the final stages of pickling.
Lactic acid bacteria are also used to cure meats such as salami, pepperoni, 
and summer sausage that are then dried and/or smoked after fermentation.
Soy sauce is a fermentation product of soybean and wheat paste. The lactic 
acid bacteria and fungi such as Aspergillus produce the distinctive taste of 
soy sauce.
Vinegar is made not by lactic acid but by the acetic acid bacteria from wine, 
apple cider, or dilute ethanol.
Growing Legumes
Leguminous plants, such as soybeans, peas, clover, alfalfa, and beans, form 
intimate associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria like Rhizobium. The ­bacteria 
essentially move into the root cells and form little homes for themselves called 
nodules. Within these nodules, the bacteria change completely from their free-
living form and produce nitrogen compounds that are used by the plant in 
exchange for shelter and organic compounds made by the plant. This setup is 
great for both the plant and bacteria in question, but it also serves to replenish 
nitrate levels in the soil, which is why farmers often alternate these crops with 
other nonleguminous crops from one planting season to the next to prolong 
soil fertility.
Brewing Beer, Liquor, and Wine
Along with bread-making, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is probably 
best known for its use in making alcoholic beverages. This process involves 
mixing a sugar source — barley for beer, fruit juice for wine, or rice or potato 
starch for spirits — with yeast and water. The yeast first consumes the sugars 
­aerobically until the oxygen runs out; then it ferments the sugars anaerobically, 
producing ethanol and carbon dioxide as waste. When the concentration of 
ethanol gets to be around 20 percent, the yeast stops ­fermenting, so distilling 
is used to make liquor with a higher alcohol concentration.

337
 Chapter 21: Ten Great Uses for Microbes
Killing Insect Pests
The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (also known as Bt) produces a toxin that 
is specific to certain types of insects, many of which are pests encountered 
by gardeners and farmers. The toxin is so effective at killing the target insect 
that for years it has been used as an insecticide. A concentrated solution 
of Bt cells is sold as a spray that can be applied directly to plant tissues. 
Scientists have isolated the genes for the Bt toxin and have engineered plants 
to express it, producing transgenic Bt crops.
	
There are a couple of drawbacks to this method of pest control, however. As 
with any insecticide, Bt toxin can kill nontarget insects that are actually helpful 
in the garden. In addition, some pest insects have developed an immunity to it.
Another group of insect pathogens uses small worms called nematodes to 
get inside of their insect host. Members of the bacterial genera Photorhabdus 
and Xenorhabdus hitch a ride inside soil-dwelling nematodes without harm-
ing them. It’s only when the nematode crawls inside of insect grubs that the 
bacteria emerge and produce toxins that kill the grub, giving the nematode 
a lot of nutrients to use for reproduction. Gardeners wanting to reduce the 
number of grubs in lawns and gardens have taken advantage of this natural 
lifecycle.
Treating Sewage
Microorganisms are an important part of wastewater treatment during a few 
different steps of the process. After the sewage has been physically filtered 
to remove solid waste, called primary treatment, microbes break down the 
insoluble organic matter during secondary treatment. This process is espe-
cially necessary for wastes that are high in plant matter, such as those from 
industrial food processing sites. Huge communities of microorganisms present 
in bioreactors (or sludge digesters) act together to anaerobically break down 
the organic matter in the water.
Another type of secondary treatment is aerobic and involves microbes that 
form clumps called flocks that the remaining organic matter and other micro-
organisms bind to. The flocks are then allowed to settle, and the remaining 
water is much clearer than it was in the beginning.

Microorganisms in sewage treatment plants also convert nitrate in the waste-
water to nitrogen gas that is lost to the air. This process, called denitrification, 
is important because water with a high nitrate content can stimulate huge 
blooms of algae that foul lakes, rivers, and streams.
Contributing to Medicine
Microbes have evolved over the last 3.5 billion years to compete with one 
another mostly through chemical means. It’s not surprising, then, that the 
vast majority of the thousands of antibiotics known to us are made by micro-
organisms. Species of the bacterial genus Streptomyces alone produce more 
than 500 different antibiotics, including cycloheximide, cycloserine, eryth-
romycin, kanamycin, lincomycin, neomycin, nystatin, streptomycin, and tet-
racycline. Other antibiotics are made by Bacillus bacteria and fungi, such as 
Penecillium.
	
Because of this long history of competition and survival in the face of these 
chemicals, bacteria are naturally suited to develop antibiotic resistance. This 
means that despite having such an impressive arsenal of antibiotics, we’re still 
struggling to control the growth of many strains of bacteria that have become 
resistant to them.
Botox, the toxin from the Clostridium botulinum bacteria, is best known for 
its cosmetic use to decrease wrinkles by paralyzing the muscles of the face. 
It works by blocking release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from 
neurons, effectively stopping them from signaling the muscles. Recently, 
Botox has been used in many other medical applications, such as treating 
overactive muscle and twitching disorders, as well as treating headaches and 
chronic pain in joints, muscles, and connective tissue.
Setting Up Your Aquarium
In nature, fish live in complex environments filled with plants, insects, and 
microorganisms. Because of their biological complexity, natural habitats 
are good at absorbing and recycling fish waste, such as ammonia, so that it 
doesn’t build up. In a closed container, however, like an aquarium, ammonia 
released in fish waste can build up quickly, making the water inhospitable 
and toxic.
To stop this buildup of ammonia from happening, aquarium owners have to 
do two things:

339
 Chapter 21: Ten Great Uses for Microbes
	
✓	About once a week, change one-quarter of the water in the tank.
	
✓	Encourage the establishment in the tank of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria 
and archaea that live in the filter and the tank sediment and convert 
ammonia to less harmful products in a process called nitrification.
	
Pet stores sell an aquarium starter mix, but this usually doesn’t contain all the 
necessary ammonia oxidizers. You’re much better off seeding your aquarium 
from another well-established tank by taking a small amount of the filter. Once 
they’re established, the microbes will lead to a well-balanced tank ecosystem.
Making and Breaking Down 
Biodegradable Plastics
Most of the plastic used today is synthetically made from petroleum and is 
extremely resistant to degradation. Some attempts have been made to make 
biodegradable plastics synthetically by adding starch or using different poly-
mers, but most of these plastics still aren’t completely broken down. The 
best kind of biodegradable plastics are the ones made by bacteria because 
they can also be broken down by bacteria. These contain either polylactide 
(PLA), made as a product of fermentation, or polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), 
made by bacteria as storage compounds.
PLAs are slower to degrade and aren’t as good as PHAs that have many of 
the same properties of synthetically made polymers used in plastics. PHA 
polymers such as poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and poly-β-hydroxyvalerate 
(PHV) have been combined to make containers for shampoo and other per-
sonal care products in Europe.
Unfortunately, biodegradable bacterially produced plastics haven’t yet been 
able to compete with the synthetically made ones because oil is still cheaper 
than the sugar needed to feed the bacteria.
Turning Over Compostable Waste
The ability of the compost pile in your backyard or in your municipal waste 
treatment center to turn kitchen and yard waste into what looks like dirt 
depends directly on microorganisms. The process of composting starts with 

340
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
the initial breakdown of simple organic matter by microorganisms that pro-
duce, among other things, carbon dioxide, heat, and humus (broken down 
organic matter).
Next, heat-tolerant bacteria called thermophiles continue breaking things 
down and increasing the temperature up to between 140°F and 158°F 
(60°C–70°C). This phase is important because the increased temperature 
helps break down complex organic matter and kills most animal and plant 
pathogens. It’s also at this point that the pile is mixed to provide oxygen and 
to keep the temperature from going too high and killing all the composting 
microbes.
Finally, the compost pile cools and matures to include a complex community 
of microorganisms and insects that are beneficial to the environment.
Maintaining a Balance
The complex microbial communities on and in the human body can some-
times get out of balance. Probiotics have been designed to administer bacte-
rial species that are beneficial to the human body. They’re thought to help 
the body’s microbial community return to a balanced state. Widely used 
probiotics mainly include the lactic acid bacteria. They can be taken as a 
pill or in a fermented milk product, such as yogurt. Probiotics are thought to 
help with everything from inflammatory bowel disease and resistance against 
pathogenic bacteria and viruses to cancer treatment. Drawbacks to probiot-
ics are that they aren’t always effective and they need to be administered 
daily to have an effect.
Fecal biotherapy (sometimes called fecal transplant) is the insertion of feces 
from a healthy person (the donor) into the colon of a person suffering from 
a gastrointestinal disorder or disease. The idea is that the patient’s micro-
bial community is unbalanced and the healthy community of microbes 
from the donor sample can help restore a healthy balanced microbial com-
munity. The best example of its use has been in treating people suffering 
from a Clostridium difficile (or C. diff) infection, which is a nasty infection of 
the gastrointestinal tract that is often contracted in the hospital after anti-
biotic treatment. C. diff is very difficult to get rid of because the bacterium 
produces antibiotic-resistant endospores; it’s often fatal if unresolved. Fecal 
biotherapy has been used very successfully to treat C. diff infections because 
the bacterium doesn’t compete well with other microbes. Although fecal bio-
therapy is still controversial, a few clinical trials aimed at treating complex 
gastrointestinal disorders with fecal biotherapy are underway.

here are many professions where knowing about microbes, either patho-
genic or benign, is handy. There are also plenty of situations where apply-
ing a microbiology approach to a problem will get you out of a jam. In this 
chapter, we provide ten examples. Some are industries that employ micro-
biologists, and others are situations where a knowledge of microbiology is 
essential to getting the job done.
Medical Care: Keeping People Healthy
One of the places where microbiology is essential is in the healthcare indus-
try. Here are just some of the healthcare professionals who think critically 
about microbes every day:
	
✓	Nurses and doctors: As the front line of the hospital healthcare system, 
infection control nurses and doctors are constantly on guard against 
transmission of microbial pathogens. Protocols exist to protect both 
patients and staff from viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Simple hand washing 
can do wonders to protect people. Also instituted are routine screening 
for antibiotic-resistant bacteria and strict rules surrounding the inten-
sive care and surgical areas of the hospital.
	
✓	Pharmacists: Pharmacists dispense a variety of medications, many of 
which have microbial origins. Even synthetic drugs are often derived 
from a modified natural product.

342
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
	
✓	Clinical microbiologists: Identifying pathogenic microorganisms in the 
many patient samples collected every day is the responsibility of clinical 
laboratories. Identification of microorganisms is performed with selec-
tive media, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and biochemical and meta-
bolic tests.
	
✓	Obstetricians and midwives: Newborn babies are completely vulner-
able to infection by microbial pathogens, which is why obstetricians 
and midwives screen mothers for some of the pathogens that can be 
passed on to babies during delivery. Born relatively sterile, babies start 
getting their natural healthy bacteria almost immediately after birth, so 
parents are encouraged to expose babies to good microbes, from breast 
milk and skin contact with parents and siblings, and keep babies away 
from microbes that could make them sick, like from people who are 
contagious.
	
✓	Public health officials: These folks monitor the spread of infectious 
agents in the population and provide education about disease transmis-
sion and vaccination schedules. Public health officials are also responsi-
ble for monitoring rates of foodborne and waterborne illnesses to track 
sources of contamination.
Dental Care: Keeping Those Pearly 
Whites Shining Bright
The dentist’s office is a place where smiles get polished and nagging tooth-
aches get attended to. But a big part of dentistry is knowing about the micro-
organisms that live in the mouth. The oral cavity has the most microbial 
diversity of any site in the human body, with several hundred species of 
bacteria alone.
Plaque, which accumulates around the area where the gums meet the teeth, 
is a hard substance made up mainly of polysaccharide and other extracellular 
products of bacteria. After every dental cleaning, bacterial biofilms reform 
in the mouth through an organized process that involves different species of 
­bacteria working together to form a matrix that they share as a community. 
This is part of the reason that it’s difficult to get rid of the bacteria thought to 
be responsible for halitosis (bad breath). It’s hard to identify which microbe is 
the culprit and it’s hard to get rid of just the ones you want to, because they 
live in such a tightly knit community.

343
 Chapter 22: Ten Great Uses for Microbiology
Periodontitis is the inflammation of the tissue surrounding teeth because of a 
heightened immune reaction against pathogenic microorganisms living below 
the gum surface. This inflamed state within the gum tissue is thought by 
some scientists to be linked with many other negative health outcomes like 
cardiovascular disease. Others disagree with this connection, pointing out 
that people who are not well often don’t practice good oral care. The issue is 
still hotly debated, but dentists aim to keep gums happy and free of disease 
for the benefit of the teeth with the possible side effect of contributing to 
their patients’ overall well-being.
Veterinary Care: Helping Fido and  
Fluffy to Feel Their Best
As doctors with special knowledge about many different types of animals, 
veterinarians keep pets, livestock, and even wild animals healthy. The types 
of microbiology used in veterinary medicine are much like those used in 
human medicine — the pathogens just have different names.
When pets get sick with mystery illnesses, vets use some fundamental micro-
biology to figure out if a microbe is the cause. This includes microscopy 
and Gram staining of body fluids and stool, as well as culturing swabs. They 
administer vaccines for viruses like rabies and feline leukemia and give out 
other preventive treatments for parasites like heartworm.
Vets on the farm take care of infectious livestock diseases like mastitis 
(inflammation of the mammary glands and udder tissue) in cows and viruses 
in pigs and poultry. Lots of research is done on preventing and dealing with 
livestock infections, mainly because of the tendency for infections to spread 
quickly through animal populations and because loss of animal life is costly 
to the agriculture industry.
Many animal pathogens have been successfully eliminated from livestock 
populations only to remain in the wild animal population, which is much 
more difficult to treat. An example of treating the wild population is in the 
case of rabies. An oral vaccine has been developed that is safe for the ani-
mals and works well if ingested. Wild populations of raccoon, coyote, and fox 
have been immunized by lacing bait with the vaccine, stemming the spread of 
this dangerous virus.

344
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Monitoring the Environment
National environmental monitoring programs, like the U.S. Geological Survey, 
use microbiology, both to impact environmental conservation and for basic 
research reasons. Examples of such activities include the following:
	
✓	Monitoring the impacts of climate change on microbial populations: 
Rising temperatures can cause blooms of some microbes, like cyano-
bacteria, impacting animal and plant populations. Increasing tempera-
tures can increase soil microbe metabolic rates leading to more carbon 
cycling along with the release of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.
	
✓	Conserving wildlife: Scientists monitor aquatic and land animal diseases 
and research ways to treat or protect them from infectious microbes.
	
✓	Studying the interaction of microorganisms and their environments: 
How microorganisms interact with plants, corals, and in soils are important 
aspects of ecosystem functioning. This field is called microbial ecology.
	
✓	Recording and publishing water quality data: Scientists study water 
quality to keep the public informed of the closure of recreational 
beaches and warn them of poor water quality in lakes and streams.
	
✓	Studying how microorganisms interact with nonliving parts of the 
environment: These include sediments, minerals, rocks, and the 
atmosphere. This field is called geomicrobiology.
	
✓	Combining all of the above activities to measure overall ecosystem 
functioning: This includes research into the stability of different eco-
systems in the face of stress, as well as how to restore natural habitats. 
Because microorganisms play a huge role in ecosystem functioning, 
scientists study their presence and how they change.
Nowhere to hide
Populations of birds found nowhere else 
on earth are in danger of extinction on the 
Hawaiian Islands because of avian malaria. 
This nasty bird pathogen is transmitted by mos-
quito and decimates bird populations every 
year. Mosquitos only arrived on the islands in 
1827, so species of birds that evolved without 
avian malaria were completely unprotected. In 
the past, the cooler temperatures at higher alti-
tudes have acted as a refuge for birds looking 
to escape from the biting mosquitos. However, 
recent increases in temperatures due to global 
warming have reduced the area of each island 
that gets cool enough to stop mosquito breed-
ing. For this reason, avian malaria in Hawaii’s 
birds can act as an indicator of global warming. 
Because of avian malaria, bird species like the 
Hawaiian honeycreeper are going extinct at an 
unprecedented rate.

 Chapter 22: Ten Great Uses for Microbiology
Making Plants Happy
Farmers, horticulturalists, and gardeners use microbiology every day to keep 
plants protected from plant pathogens. A slew of microorganisms make a 
living from infecting plant tissues, and it’s sometimes hard to stay ahead of 
them. Plants infected with microbial pathogens are less healthy, often have 
unsightly blemishes, and can succumb quickly despite treatment. Prevention 
is the best medicine, especially because many pathogens get inside of plant 
tissues, making it hard to get rid of them before losing the plants.
Microbiology approaches used to combat plant pathogens involve the following:
	
✓	Know the enemy. It’s important to identify the culprit using microbiology 
techniques such as culture, fungal identification, and bacterial staining. 
Also, many nasty plant colonizers have a lifecycle that spans over the 
winter, so it’s important to clean up all infected material left over from 
the previous season; otherwise, the spores will germinate in the spring. 
And don’t forget that many have more than one host so although it’s the 
apples you care about, for example, you also have to get rid of all infected 
blackberry bush leaves (because this is where the fungus hides).
	
✓	The enemy of your enemy is your friend. Several microorganisms com-
pete with and actively kill other microorganisms, so it helps to know which 
these are and how to encourage them to grow near, on, or in your plants. 
Examples include free-living bacteria in the soil that are bioprotective.
	
✓	The best protection is healthy plants. Plant pathogens often prey on 
sick or stressed plants that otherwise would not be susceptible to infec-
tion. Maintaining good soil moisture and drainage, having the appropri-
ate amount of light, not crowding plants too close together, and making 
sure that the soil is not being drained of essential nutrients can help to 
keep plants healthy.
Keeping Fish Swimming Strong
The fishing industry works together with wildlife protection agencies to make 
sure that captive and wild fish populations are healthy and free of disease. 
To do this, a number of different microbial pathogens and hazards have to be 
considered:
	
✓	A huge part of the fishing industry involves keeping fish farms free of 
microbial pathogens. Farmed fish are particularly vulnerable to disease, 
and countries that share an ocean notify one another when they have 
a nasty fish virus or bacterial pathogen within their fish farms. Fish 
vaccines have been developed that help in this regard as well.

346
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
	
✓	Bacterial, viral and fungal fish pathogens are also a major problem for 
natural lake populations of fish. It’s important to collect data on fish 
pathogens in wild fish populations in national parks to make sure that 
fish stocking of streams upstream aren’t impacting wild fish populations.
	
✓	Large-scale deaths in young fish can happen because of ingestion of 
toxin-producing cyanobacteria. Invertebrates consume the bacteria 
and are, in turn, food for fish. The more invertebrates a fish eats, the 
more toxin it gets as well.
	
✓	Invasive fish species can impact local fish populations in a negative 
way, by preying on them, as well as competing for food and habitats. 
Another negative impact of invasive species is that they bring with them 
pathogens that native fish have no immunity against.
	
✓	Zoonotic diseases that can pass from one species to another.
	
✓	Some bacteria can cause vitamin B1 deficiency in trout eggs leading to 
death in early stages of life.
Producing Food, Wine, and Beer
Although bacteria and yeast are used extensively in the food industry to 
ferment a number of food products, microbiology is also used to keep food 
manufacturing processes safe from microorganisms that will either foul the 
products or make people sick. Clever ways to keep microbes off of surfaces 
in the food processing industry have been developed that include inhibit-
ing bacterial biofilms in order to stop bacteria like Listeria from growing on 
food-processing equipment.
An important question is how to determine that the equipment is free of con-
taminating microbes. To answer this question, environmental monitoring is 
used, including culture plates and swabs to assess cleanliness. Culture plates 
are inoculated by touching them to the surface in question or swabbing; 
these are then incubated to allow bacteria to grow, and then the organisms, 
if grown, are identified. Even very low numbers of bacteria can be problem-
atic, but these small numbers of organisms can be hard to detect by plat-
ing. Taking advantage of the fact that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) doesn’t 
hang around long after cells die, special swabs are designed to detect minute 
amounts of ATP, indicating that a living cell is present. The test uses firefly 
luciferase as an indicator; it lights up in the presence of ATP.
Canned foods are heated to kill pathogenic organisms, but this process 
doesn’t make the food inside sterile — temperatures used to sterilize would 
destroy much of the nutritional value and alter the quality of the food. Many 
heat-tolerant organisms still remain, but they aren’t likely to make people sick 
because they aren’t adapted to the human body and don’t make compounds 
that are toxic for people.

347
 Chapter 22: Ten Great Uses for Microbiology
Uses of microbiology in the beer and wine industry include monitoring the 
fermentation process at different stages to look for lactic fermenters that will 
spoil the product. The wine industry also relies heavily on agricultural micro-
biologists who can keep the grape vines free of plant pathogens.
Science Hacking
Twitter is awash with the hashtag #ScienceHack (www.twitter.com/
hashtag/sciencehack) calling all amateur scientists, or rather all science 
enthusiasts not affiliated with a university, to participate in events aimed at 
making an impact on research and medicine. One example involves genetically 
engineering E. coli to produce an antimicrobial and possibly anticancer com-
pound called violacein. This bright purple, aromatic compound is produced nat-
urally by a Gram-negative microbe, similar to Neisseria, called Chromobacterium 
violaceum. If E. coli were engineered to both produce and excrete violacein, the 
cost of this useful drug would be greatly reduced. If you’re more of a lone-wolf 
scientist, you can order a kit from Synbiota (http://blog.synbiota.com) 
and get to work in your kitchen, using biotechnology to change the world in 
months rather than years.
Looking for Microbes in Clean Rooms
Clean rooms are used in manufacturing and special research centers where 
limiting all sources of contamination from dust and microorganisms is impor-
tant. In these rooms, the incoming air is filtered, people are covered com-
pletely to avoid bringing in contaminants from outside, and all material going 
into the rooms is carefully cleaned and/or sterilized. Surfaces are cleaned 
with harsh chemicals that are thought to eliminate all living microorganisms, 
and people monitor the area frequently to look for live microbes that may 
have slipped through the cracks.
It was precisely these precautions that selected for and allowed one rare 
microorganism to grow on surfaces in a clean room at NASA used for preparing 
the Mars lander Phoenix. A newly discovered bacteria, now named Tersicoccus 
phoenicis, was found during a routine check of the facility. Because it can 
withstand the harsh chemicals and high temperatures used to disinfect the 
clean rooms, this bacterium remained after all other microorganisms were 
removed.

348
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Researchers think that T. phoenicis hasn’t been seen before because there are 
so many other organisms in nature that it’s hard to isolate and identify each 
and every one. The same microbe could be hiding in common dirt outside 
the doorstep of the facility and they’d never see it — it’s only because they 
work so hard at getting rid of bacteria that the ones able to withstand their 
sanitation measures are found on surfaces.
Producing Pharmaceuticals
Secondary metabolism is the term used to describe any nonessential products 
made by an organism. Many times these are waste products that are excreted 
from the cell, but other times these products have an important activity on 
live cells and so are called bioactive and can be excreted or stored within the 
cell. Bioactive properties of secondary metabolites include the following:
	
✓	Attracting or repelling other organisms.
	
✓	Killing or halting the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics are the most well-
known group in this class.
	
✓	Toxicity to eukaryotic cells, including chemotherapeutic drugs used to 
kill cancerous cells.
Many other functions exist and the spectrum of activities is still largely 
unknown.
Many compounds have more than one function, which often only comes to 
light after extensive testing and research. Plants, animals, and microorgan-
isms make bioactive secondary metabolites that they use to interact with 
their environment. When these bioactive compounds are purified for the 
pharmaceutical industry, they’re called natural products. In fact, the natural 
products industry is responsible for a large proportion of all the pharmaceu-
ticals used today. Almost all natural products used today are from microbial 
sources, two-thirds from bacteria (notably actinomycetes like Streptomyces) 
and one-third from fungi. For this reason, the pharmaceutical industry 
employs a large number of microbiologists who work to discover, isolate, 
and study natural products from microbes, essentially trying to harness the 
power of these compounds for human use.

About the Authors
Jennifer C. Stearns, PhD: Jennifer is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department 
of Medicine at McMaster University, where, along with Dr. Michael Surette, 
she pushes back the boundaries of medicinal microbiology every day. She 
currently researches how the usually benign bacteria in the respiratory tract 
can sometimes make people sick. Jennifer was captivated by the images of 
microbes in her mother’s nursing textbooks as a child and eagerly soaked up 
knowledge about microbiology everywhere she could. Seeing her interest in 
all things micro, her high school biology teacher, Mr. Tunnicliffe, lent her a 
copy of the novel The Hot Zone, which forever made her love deadly viruses. 
She has harnessed the potential of microbes to improve crop plant stress 
and applied the principles of microbial ecology to the bacteria living in the 
human GI tract. She is currently inspired by the awesome diversity of micro-
organisms in nature and in our everyday lives. You can follow her musings on 
the microbiology of the human body on the Human Microbiome Journal Club 
blog at http://hmjournalclub.wordpress.com.
Julie Kaiser, MSc: Julie is currently a PhD student in the Department of 
Microbiology and Immunology at Western University in London, Ontario. She 
completed her bachelor of science at McGill University and her master of sci-
ence at McMaster University and over the years has studied various human 
pathogens including E. coli, Salmonella, Streptococci, and deadly MRSA. She 
has earned numerous awards in communication for presenting her research 
at scientific meetings and currently outlets her thoughts on microbiology on 
The Human Microbiome Journal Club blog.
Michael G. Surette, PhD: Michael is currently appointed to both the 
Department of Medicine and the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical 
Sciences at McMaster University, where he’s unraveling some of the dynamic 
bacterial interactions inside the complex microbial communities of the human 
airways and gastrointestinal tract. He earned his bachelor of science in bio-
chemistry at Memorial University of Newfoundland and his PhD, also in bio-
chemistry, at the University of Western Ontario. His post-graduate research 
at Princeton University was on bacterial chemotaxis; this was followed by a 
faculty position in the Department of Microbiology and Infectious Disease at 
the University of Calgary, where he is currently an adjunct professor. Michael 
holds the Canada Research Chair in Interdisciplinary Microbiome Research, 
has been on the editorial boards of several microbiology journals, and is a 
member of both the Canadian Society of Microbiologists and the American 
Society for Microbiology. Michael has published over 100 peer-reviewed publi-
cations on bacterial sensing and communication, antibiotic resistance, genet-
ics, infectious disease, and microbiological methods. He has been invited to 
give countless seminars on bacterial genetics, behavior, biochemistry, and 
infectious disease.

Authors’ Acknowledgments
Because this is our first-ever book, we have many people to thank for both 
technical and moral support. We’re grateful to Matt Wagner at Fresh Books 
and Lindsay Lefevere at John Wiley & Sons for the opportunity to write this 
book and for their valuable encouragement throughout the process. Thanks 
to Elizabeth Kuball for keeping us on track.
Several people contributed material to this book and we’re grateful for their 
contributions. Thank you to Kayla Cyr for contributing most of the online 
article “Ten Reasons You May Not Need Antibiotics” and to Josie Libertucci 
for contributing to the online article “Fecal Transplants: What They Are and 
What They’re Doing.”
A special thanks to the entire Surette lab at McMaster University who hunt 
elusive microbes on and in the human body every day and to the anonymous 
asthma patient who donated the sample that appears on the cover.
We’d especially like to thank our technical editor Laura Rossi, in whose tal-
ented hands so many challenges melt away. We’d also like to thank our fami-
