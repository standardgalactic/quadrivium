About the Author
Manny Hernandez is a social entrepreneur and a community strategist com-
mitted to connecting people touched by diabetes and raising diabetes aware-
ness. He is the President of the Diabetes Hands Foundation (DHF), a nonprofi t 
that runs the fi rst two social networks for people touched by diabetes: 
TuDiabetes.com (in English, started in March 2007) and EsTuDiabetes.com 
(in Spanish, started in August 2007). Both social networks run on Ning.
In early 2008, Manny worked briefl y as a Community Advocate for Ning, in 
Palo Alto, CA. Between 2000 and 2008, he worked in Web product manage-
ment, online community management, content management, and search 
engine marketing in a number of companies, including Full Sail University, 
Quepasa.com, Earth911, and Pets911. From 1996 to 2000, Manny worked for 
Procter & Gamble in Venezuela.
In 1994, Manny earned his bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering in 
Universidad Metropolitana, Venezuela, and in 1996 he earned his Master’s 
degree in EE in Cornell University. While attending Cornell, the Web bug bit 
him, and it hasn’t abandoned him since. Manny loves to listen to music, read, 
and spend time with his family. You can fi nd him on Twitter at askmanny and 
blogging at www.askmanny.com.

To my father, Manuel Adolfo (1928–2005): Even four years after your depar-
ture, you continue to be my biggest inspiration. Te echo de menos, Viejo. . . .
Acknowledgments
Above all, thanks to my wife Andreina and my son Santiago for being so 
patient and supportive during the times I was sitting in front of the computer 
writing, instead of being with them. I now go back to having a life!
Thanks to the folks at Wiley, in particular Nicole Sholly and Amy Fandrei, 
who made the book possible before and during the writing process. Thanks 
for making me sound smarter . . . or should I say dummier?
To all my friends at Ning: Mackenzie Cooper, Brad Mallow, Laura Gluhanich, 
Athena von Oech, Kyle Ford, Evan Goldin, Alex Fishwick, along with the 
entire Advocacy crew. Gina and Marc, thanks for creating such an incredible 
platform. Thank you also to everybody else I had the honor of meeting and 
working with while I was at Ning; this book is a testament to your hard work.
Thanks to the amazing team of Administrators in TuDiabetes.com and 
EsTuDiabetes.com for all you do every day to help create and maintain an 
incredible member experience for people touched by diabetes.
Last, thanks to all the members of TuDiabetes.com and EsTuDiabetes.com. You

Introduction
O
nline social networks are part of modern life. Long gone are the days 
when MySpace, Facebook, and LinkedIn were a remote notion. Being a 
member of a social network has become an incredible way to connect (and 
reconnect) with other people who share your interests.
Until Ning was created, social networks offered members a space on the 
Internet that either looked all the same on every page (as in the case of 
Facebook or LinkedIn) or lent itself to a bit of a chaotic visual experience (as 
in the case of MySpace). Ning acknowledged the gap in between and started 
giving people the power and the platform to easily create, manage, and even 
make money running a social network dealing with any subject they want to 
share.
From school groups to scientists, from music fans to health patients . . . there 
can be a network on Ning for anything. You can either become a member of 
one or many social networks on Ning or start your own.
About Ning For Dummies
I wrote Ning For Dummies with two audiences in mind: members of social net-
works on Ning and Network Creators on Ning. The first two parts of the book 
are meant for anyone who is a member of a network on Ning and for people 
who are considering joining a network on Ning. Part III is for someone who 
is considering creating a network. Parts IV to VI are for anyone who wants to 
create a network and people who have already taken the leap and are run-
ning a network.
Here are some of the things you can do with this book:
 
✓ Set up a profile to share about yourself with others. You find out how 
to make your profile look good and tell enough about yourself. You also 
discover how to protect your privacy and limit access to your informa-
tion to only those you care to share it with.
 
✓ Connect with others that you have something in common with. 
All social networks on Ning have an edge that makes them unique. 
Considering how many networks there are, there’s a good chance that 
you can find a network you can join to meet other folks that are like you.

Ning For Dummies 
 
✓ Create a social network and customize it as much as you want. The 
management and customization tools built in to your social network 
on Ning are very well thought out and let you make your network look 
great. Your work goes mostly into getting new members to join and man-
aging the network once it’s running.
 
✓ Extend your brand through a social network and monetize it. You 
can extend your brand through the connections you develop in your 
social network. Ning also gives you the means to make money from 
your network.
Foolish Assumptions
In this book, I make the following assumptions:
 
✓ You have Internet access and an e-mail address. Ning is a service based 
on the Web, and you need an e-mail address in order to join or start a 
network on Ning.
 
✓ You have a basic understanding of how to use a Web site. I mean 
simple things like clicking links, selecting options from a drop-down 
list . . . nothing that’s rocket science.
 
✓ You get a kick out of connecting with others online. If you would 
rather not leave comments to others, participate in a discussion topic, 
share photos, post in your blog, and so on, this book and Ning are not 
for you.
Conventions Used in This Book
By conventions, I mean a set of rules I’ve used throughout this book to pres-
ent information to you consistently.
 
✓ When you see a term italicized, look for its definition, which is included 
so that you know what things mean in the context of Ning.
 
✓ Sometimes, I give you information to enter on-screen; in this case, I’ve 
used bold for what you need to type.
 
✓ Web site addresses and e-mail addresses are in monofont so that they 
stand out from regular text.

 Introduction
What You Don’t Have to Read
This book helps you take the steps to eventually create and run your own 
social network for anything. It starts by introducing you to the basics of Ning 
and being a member of a network. If that’s all you want to do, you don’t need 
to read much else. If you already run your own network, you’ll find the later 
chapters in the book particularly useful. All in all, the book is structured in a 
modular way, so you can read the chapters containing the information you 
need and nothing more.
How This Book Is Organized
Ning For Dummies is split into six parts. You don’t have to read it sequen-
tially, and you don’t even have to read all the sections in any particular chap-
ter. You can use the Table of Contents and the index to find the information 
you need and quickly get your answer. In this section, I briefly describe what 
you can find in each part.
Part I: An Overview of Ning
Part I covers the basics of Ning. What is Ning? Let me tell you right now that 
Ning is not a Chinese Web site or a style of martial arts. I introduce you to 
what Ning helps you accomplish and go through the process of setting up an 
account on Ning and joining your first social networks on Ning. Chapter 3 dis-
cusses how you can protect your personal information on Ning, so you can 
confidently participate in social networks on Ning.
Part II: Using an Existing 
Network on Ning
This part gives you the information you need to participate actively in a net-
work on Ning while making the most of all its features. Uploading photos and 
videos, communicating with other members in the network, participating 
in the discussion forum, events, groups, and chat are all things you find out 
how to do in Chapters 4 through 6.

Ning For Dummies 
Part III: Creating and Managing 
Your Own Social Network
Part III takes your experience in Ning to the next level. You find out how to 
go about creating and managing your own social network. I show you how to 
set it up, tweak it to make it look the way you want it, and manage it as you 
go along. I also discuss the importance of enlisting the help of others along 
the way in order to keep up with the demands of running a successful social 
network.
Part IV: Promoting Your Network
After your network is set up, you need to promote it to make sure members 
start joining. This part is devoted to showing you how you can spread the 
word about your network to get more people interested in it. I also deal with 
the use of tools to help you learn from your members and what they do, so 
you can keep on improving the network for them. Last, I show you how to 
keep your members coming back.
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks
Part V is meant for people who want to really spend some more time going 
“under the hood” to fine-tune elements throughout the network. I discuss CSS 
and internal tools within your network, which you can use to customize the 
appearance, language, and features of the network. With a little effort, you 
can make your network match as much as possible what you had in mind 
when you first thought of it.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The last part contains a chapter dealing with ten ways to help you make 
money from your network, ten hacks to make your network stand out even 
more and ten tools to help you run (or be a member) of a network on Ning. 
Complementing Part V, the last chapter offers a list of ten ideas for networks 
on Ning.

 Introduction
Appendix
The appendix contains a list of Ning resources you can go back to in order 
to stay current on the latest news and details from the Ning headquarters in 
Palo Alto.
Icons Used in This Book
What’s a For Dummies book without icons pointing you in the direction of 
really great, super-helpful information? In this section, I briefly describe each 
icon I use in this book.
 
The Tip icon points out helpful information that is likely to make your job 
easier.
 
This icon marks an interesting and useful fact — something that you might 
want to remember for later use.
 
The Warning icon highlights lurking danger. With this icon, I’m telling you to 
pay attention and proceed with caution.
 
When you see this icon, you know that there’s techie stuff nearby. If you’re 
not feeling very techie, you can skip this info.
Where to Go from Here
If you want to get a feel for what Ning is and how to join a social network on 
Ning, go to Part I. If you already belong to a network on Ning and want to 
make the most of your experience on it, read the chapters in Part II. If you 
want to create your own network on Ning, jump to Part III. If you want to find 
out how to best promote your network, go to Part IV. Last, if you want to take 
your network to the next level, make sure to read the chapters in Part V.

Part I
An Overview 
of Ning

In this part . . .
B
y now you know that this is not a Chinese book or a 
book on martial arts. So you are in the right place! 
By the same token, if you’re reading the introduction to 
Part I, I’m going to go out on a limb and assume that you 
want to start from square one. 
Because Ning is such a huge place that can be different 
things to different people, in this part of the book I cover 
the basics to help ease you into things such as
 
 Understanding what Ning is and what you can do 
on it
 
 Getting started on Ning
 
 Finding your way around Ning
 
 Protecting your personal information on Ning

Chapter 1
Exploring Ning
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering Ning
▶ Finding things to do on Ning
▶ Investigating your Ning Activity Feed
W
e all have different things that we’re passionate about. You may be 
a life-long fan of your hometown sports team. You may enjoy buying 
and selling handmade crafts. You may have even seen your favorite band 
twenty times in concert.
Regardless of all the facets that make up your life, you are not alone in them: 
Thousands, most likely millions, of people out there have something in 
common with you. But until now it wasn’t easy to find them or to connect 
with them.
Enter Ning. Ning exists to help people create their own social networks for 
anything. Inside social networks, people can connect and stay in touch with 
others they have a very specific connection with.
Nearly a million different social networks have already been created on the 
Ning platform. So depending on whether you choose to join one or more exist-
ing social networks or create your own social network, you may find yourself 
interacting with others in networks on Ning in a number of possible ways.
What Is Ning?
Ning is a platform for creating your own social network to interact with 
others in a niche social network that looks and feels unlike other social net-
works you may belong to. As a matter of fact, you can be a member of mul-
tiple social networks on Ning, and each network may be completely different, 
focusing on different topics and having an entirely different appearance.

10
Part I: An Overview of Ning 
The comparisons between Ning and other social networks such as Facebook, 
MySpace, and the like are inevitable. Yet Ning addresses a need that the 
others don’t: It empowers individuals in a way that wasn’t possible before 
because Ning allows you to create, customize, and run your own social net-
work related to any topic.
The “Ning” name, according to co-founder Gina Bianchini, had a combination 
of being “short, sweet, and had good karma.” Plus it helped that the URL was 
available, of course! And so Ning was born in October 2004, when Bianchini 
launched it with the help of Marc Andreessen of Netscape and Loudcloud 
fame. Nearly one million social networks later, it seems they had the right 
idea when they thought of it.
Since it first saw the light of day, Ning has become the best (and most afford-
able) option available to create customized social networks focused on spe-
cific areas of interest, something that general social networks fall short on.
Over the years, Ning has gradually become a more complete and robust plat-
form that keeps adding new networks by the thousands every week. A large 
number of those networks have several thousand members, and membership 
is also growing very rapidly.
What Can You Do on Ning?
When you first arrive on Ning.com, you can do quite a few things, as shown in 
Figure 1-1.
 
✓ Sign up for a free Ning account or sign in with it. I discuss the sign-up 
and sign-in processes in this chapter. This is different from actually join-
ing a network. If you’ve already joined a network, you can sign in to Ning 
with the same credentials you used. If you haven’t already joined a net-
work, this is a good first step for getting your feet wet with Ning.
 
✓ Create your own social network for anything. You can find out how to 
create your own social network on Ning in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Discover social networks on Ning. I deal with finding networks to join 
them in Chapter 2.
So are you ready to start your trip through Ning? Ready or not, here we go!

12
Part I: An Overview of Ning 
On this page, you find the following elements:
 
✓ Name: You can enter your actual name or a nickname by which you 
want to be known in networks on Ning that you join or create.
 
✓ Email Address: You need to enter a valid e-mail address you have 
access to.
 
✓ Password: Think of something that isn’t too obvious . . . you know, try 
avoiding things like your last name or the name of your dog.
 
✓ Retype Password: You need to retype the password to confirm that you 
entered it correctly.
 
✓ Birthday: Your date of birth is required to confirm that you’re eligible to 
use Ning. After you join a network, if you choose to make your birthday 
visible, it can inform your friends on the network that you’re having a 
birthday so they can congratulate you.
 
✓ Type the Code on the Right: This element is here to make sure you’re a 
human and not a computer setting up an account on Ning.
 
✓ Terms of Service: This link takes you to the Ning Terms of Service page, 
which lists all the definitions, policies, licenses, and fun things you 
always read in detail when you sign up for a new service.
 
✓ Privacy Policy: This link takes you to the Ning Privacy Policy page, 
where you can become informed about the use Ning makes of personal 
information on the Ning platform.
 
✓ Problems Signing Up?: This links takes you to a page from which you 
can reset your password, identify some of the causes that may be pre-
venting you from signing up, or go to the Ning Help Center for more 
troubleshooting information and support.
When you’re done entering all these items, click the Sign Up button.
Establish your profile
When you click the Sign Up button, you’re taken to your Ning Activity Feed. 
On top of it is a floating window (see Figure 1-3) prompting you to add your 
photo, enter your country and gender using the drop-down lists offered, and 
write a little bit about yourself. If you prefer to pimp out your profile at a 
later time, you can click the Skip link at the bottom. I discuss the details of 
setting up and making changes to your profile in Chapter 2.

Part I: An Overview of Ning 
Join and participate in social networks
In Chapter 2, I give you the details of finding and joining networks. When you 
find a network you like and join it, you can start participating in the social 
network. For example, you can
 
✓ Give your profile page all the personality that you want.
 
✓ Maintain a blog.
 
✓ Leave comments to other members.
 
✓ Post videos from a recent activity or event.
 
✓ Participate in the discussion topics in a forum.
 
✓ Organize events and meet-ups with other members.
 
✓ Chat with others about topics of common interest.
 
✓ Create and join regional groups.
Before you dash off to start socializing on Ning, you might want to check out 
the next section, where I give you a full tour of the Ning Activity Feed.
Getting Around Ning
Your Ning Activity Feed is packed with information and navigation links. 
Everything you need to get around Ning is right there. All that information 
coming at you can be confusing, so in the following sections, I break down 
each bit of the Activity Feed and then describe each link that appears in the 
navigation bar across the top.
Exploring your Ning Activity Feed
Your Ning Activity Feed gives you lots of territory to explore: Through it, you 
can manage your participation in networks you’re a member of and keep a 
tab on networks you created. Through it, you can also find out about net-
works you could benefit from joining. Take a look at some of it in Figure 1-5.
Status
Starting at the top, you can update your status, much you like you can do on 
Facebook or MySpace. This status not only appears on your Ning Activity 
Feed, but also gets updated in every network on Ning you belong to. As 
explained in Chapter 5, you can also update your status on a network-by-
network basis.

15
 Chapter 1: Exploring Ning
 
Figure 1-5: 
Your Ning 
Activity 
Feed gives 
you access 
to all your 
networks 
and friends.
 
Latest Activity
Below the green status box, you find a stream that pulls information from 
several different places:
 
✓ Status updates from your friends across all networks on Ning.
 
✓ Latest Activity from all networks on Ning you belong to.
 
✓ Latest Activity from all networks on Ning you created or have adminis-
tration rights to.
 
✓ Latest Activity from your friends across all networks on Ning. This 
includes things like videos they’ve added, photos they’ve posted, and 
friends they’ve made.
 
✓ Recommended Networks. Ning recommends networks intelligently 
based on what it judges to be your interests.
You can see in Figure 1-6 how another portion of the stream on the Ning 
Activity Feed looks.

Profile photo
If you added a profile photo when you signed up, you can see it next to the 
green status box. Clicking it takes you to your profile page on Ning.com, dis-
cussed shortly. Clicking the Edit Your Profile link below it takes you to the 
My Settings page, also discussed in a bit. You can access the Settings page 
clicking the Settings link in the top navigation.
My Social Networks
Below the profile photo is the My Social Networks area . . . well, not my social 
networks, but your social networks! You know what I mean: the social net-
works on Ning that you’re a member of. You can expand the number of net-
works you belong to by clicking the link Find Networks to Join directly below 
your social networks. Doing so takes you to the Social Networks page, which I 
deal with later on.
My Friends
Below your list of social networks is the My Friends grid, showing up to 15 of 
your friends across all networks on Ning you’re a member of. You can see all 
your friends together by clicking the View All # Friends link below the grid, 
where # is the number of friends that you have across all social networks on 
Ning. When you click this link, you’re taken to the My Friends page, which is 
covered later in this chapter. You can see the My Friends grid in Figure 1-7.

Notifications
In the right column of your Ning Activity Feed is a Notifications area, where 
you can see a summary of the notifications you have outstanding in connec-
tion with all networks you belong to. Notifications include
 
✓ Network Invitations: Messages you’ve received inviting you to join 
other networks.
 
✓ Network Friend Requests: Messages from others who want to be your 
friend in one of your networks. I talk more about friends in your network 
in Chapter 3.
 
✓ New Messages: Private messages you’ve received from others in your 
networks. Private messages are discussed in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Group Invitations: Invitations you’ve gotten to join groups in your net-
works. Groups are covered in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Event Invitations: Invitations you’ve received to attend events in your 
networks. Events are also covered in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Application Alerts: Alerts sent by OpenSocial applications you have set 
up in your networks. OpenSocial applications are discussed in Chapter 21.
My Links
Below Notifications, you can see the My Links section, containing links you 
can add and modify through your Settings page.

18
Part I: An Overview of Ning 
Create Your Own Social Network button
In the right column is the Create Your Own Social Network button. When you 
click it, you’re taken through the steps involved in setting up your own net-
work. I explain this process in detail in Chapter 7.
Navigating the Ning links
Across the top of your Ning Activity Feed, the navigation gives you access 
to the following pages: Profile, Social Networks, Friends, Notifications, and 
Settings. I discuss each of these pages in the following sections. All these 
pages also have a Home link in the navigation bar that takes you back to the 
Ning Activity Feed no matter where you are.
Profile
When you click the Profile link in the navigation, you’re taken to your Profile 
page, as shown in Figure 1-8.
Your Profile page displays most of the same information contained in your 
Ning Activity Feed, along with a few extra bits of information, such as your 
location, the number of times your profile has been viewed, and whether 
you’re online.
 
Figure 1-8: 
The Profile 
page lets 
you share 
a bit more

 Chapter 1: Exploring Ning
Social Networks
Clicking the Social Networks link in the navigation takes you to the My Social 
Networks page, shown in Figure 1-9.
Below the My Social Networks heading you can sort or filter the list of your 
networks in the following ways:
 
✓ A-Z: Displays all the networks you belong to in alphabetical order.
 
✓ Recently Visited: Sorts your networks starting with those that you’ve 
given more love to recently, expressed in the form of a visit to them.
 
✓ Most Active: Displays your networks starting with those that have exhib-
ited the most activity recently.
 
✓ Networks I’ve Created: Shows all networks you’ve created on the Ning 
platform. You can also identify your own networks in the other views 
because they have a light green background (by default), which makes 
them stand out from the other networks listed.
Additionally, clicking the + Create a Social Network link lets you start a new 
network. Clicking the icon of stacked lines next to this link displays your 
networks using a list view (the default view of this page). Clicking the icon of 
four tiny squares displays your networks in a grid, letting you see more net-
works in less space.
Last, the Search Networks search box comes in handy if you’re a member of a 
very large number of networks and need to find one quickly.
 
Figure 1-9: 
The My 
Social

page gives 
you a

of activity 
in all your 
networks.
 

20
Part I: An Overview of Ning 
Friends
Clicking the Friends link in the navigation takes you to the My Friends page, 
which you can see in Figure 1-10.
By default, you see the results in the Recently Updated tab, starting with 
your friends who have updated their status most recently. Clicking the All 
tab shows all your friends, and clicking Recently Added shows your most 
recently added friends at the top.
You can also grow your list of friends by clicking the + Find More Friends link. 
This takes you to a page where you can find recommended friends based on 
your current friends: people you’re likely to want to add as friends. As with 
social networks, you can also display your friends in a list view or in a grid 
view by clicking the appropriate button at the top right.
For each friend on the list view shown in Figure 1-10, you can see a photo, a 
name, and the friend’s most recent status update along with how long ago it 
was posted. Also, you get to see which networks you’re friends on and the 
Recommend a Network link on the right of each row. Clicking this link lets 
you invite that person to all the networks that you belong to but the friend 
does not.
Notifications
When you have an account on Ning, you receive notifications of many types: 
invitations to join a network or a group, invitations to RSVP for an event, 
requests from people to be your friends, messages from your friends, and 
many more such communications.
 
Figure 1-10: 
The My 
Friends 
page lets 
you see 
your friends’ 
last status 
and more.
 

21
 Chapter 1: Exploring Ning
When you click the Notifications link in the navigation, you’re taken to the 
Notifications page, as shown in Figure 1-11. This page combines all notifica-
tions you may get from all networks you belong to, which is particularly con-
venient if you’re a member of several networks.
Settings
The last option in the navigation bar is the Settings link. Clicking it takes you 
to the My Settings page, shown in Figure 1-12.

page lets 
you tweak 
your

across all

22
Part I: An Overview of Ning 
When you first get to My Settings, you can modify the details of your profile:
 
✓ Info: The information you entered when you created your profile.
 
✓ Details: More details about yourself for others on Ning.com to get to 
know you better.
 
✓ Links: Links to pages of interest that appear on your profile page, under 
My Links.
 
✓ Photo: The profile photo you may have added while setting up your 
profile.
 
✓ URL: The address you want for your profile page on Ning.
 
✓ Password: Changing your password across all networks you belong to.
 
✓ Remove: Removing your account on Ning.
 
Clicking the Remove link lets you remove your account on Ning. Doing this 
effectively deletes your member account on all networks you belong to, along 
with all content you’ve contributed to them (posts, photos, videos, and so 
on). Be very careful with this option, because you may lose a lot of information 
if you choose it.
On the left side of the page, the list of options lets you modify settings for the 
following things:
 
✓ Social Networks: This section of your settings (see Figure 1-13) lets you 
view general details about your profile and privacy for each of the net-
works you’re a member of. It also lets you conveniently edit both, allows 
you to adjust the frequency of the updates from each network that you 
get on your Activity Feed, and even lets you leave the networks.
 
✓ Theme: This section lets you change the theme or color palette for your 
Ning Activity Feed. You pick a primary color, and the page gives you five 
options for secondary colors, all of which complement the primary color 
very nicely. This way you have control of how your home page looks, 
and it still looks very good.
 
✓ Email Notifications: You can choose what specific types of e-mail notifi-
cations you want to receive from the networks you’re a member of. This 
section lets you set your default notifications when you join new net-
works. You can override these default settings in each individual network. 
Chapter 3 details what notifications you can expect from networks on 
Ning and how you can decide which ones to receive for each network.
 
 The section also allows you to control the e-mail notifications you 
receive for New Network Invitations and Ning Profile Friend Requests, as 
shown in Figure 1-14.
 
✓ Privacy Settings: In this section, you can decide who can view your Ning 
profile and your profile on each of your social networks. The Network 
Profiles privacy settings you choose become your default settings for 

23
 Chapter 1: Exploring Ning
any new networks you join. These can be overridden, as explained in 
Chapter 3, which has an entire section dedicated to the level of control 
over your privacy you have in networks on Ning.
 
 Your options for Privacy Settings are
 
• Ning Profile: You can choose among Anyone, Friends and Members 
on My Networks, My Friends, and Just Me.
 
• Network Profiles: You can choose among Anyone, Members of the 
Network, and My Friends on the Network.

Part I: An Overview of Ning 
My Personal Journey with Ning
In late 2006, after working on Web sites for more than six years and living 
with diabetes for four years, I knew I wanted to create a social network about 
diabetes. 
I spent the next few months searching for a platform that would let me spend 
as much time as possible facing the community members and not require 
me to spend too much time “under the hood.” I’m an engineer, so this might 
sound odd, but as much as I love playing with programming code, I actually 
prefer facing people.
In early March 2007, a blog post I ran into made me aware of Ning. In less 
than 15 minutes, I had set up and launched my social network. I couldn’t 
believe it. Ning allowed me to have a social network and to focus on creat-
ing a community for people touched by diabetes, and I didn’t have to worry 
about things behind the curtains.
As impressive as the social networking platform was, I was equally impressed 
with how affordable it was. It cost me nothing to set up the social network! 
And when I was ready to tell people about it, I added a few premium services 
that cost me very little. It didn’t take me long to know Ning was the right plat-
form for what I had in mind.
Since then, through word of mouth in the blogging community, members of 
the network spreading the word, and media coverage, TuDiabetes.com (in 
English) and EsTuDiabetes.com (in Spanish) have grown and continued to 
help people touched by diabetes.
Both social networks run on Ning and continue to prove every day what the 
platform can do. I’ve seen the Ning platform evolve, providing more tools to 
enrich the experiences of the members so that they would keep coming back. 
Today, Ning empowers thousands of Network Creators worldwide with tools 
that are helping change the world.

In This Chapter
▶ Finding a network to join
▶ Joining networks, both public and private
▶ Tweaking your profile
W
hen you consider the volume of networks on Ning (more than a mil-
lion of them at the time this book went to press), finding a network 
you really want may sound like a tough exercise. Don’t lose hope! There are 
ways for you to find the network that suits your needs and interests.
In this chapter, I walk you through not only finding the network you’re look-
ing for, but also joining networks, so you can start connecting with others in 
a social network on Ning in no time. I also explain how to set up and custom-
ize your member profile once you join.
Finding a Network to Join
Ning has made it easy to find networks that may be of interest to you. 
When you go to Ning.com, you will see a search box, where you can enter 
topics or keywords that you’re interested in. The results you get show you 
a list of networks that match your search, sorted by activity level (with the 
most active networks at the top of the list).
The Search Networks results page includes a Join link to the right of each 
entry listed. Clicking the link takes you directly to the Sign Up page for that 
network, bypassing the network’s main page.
If you’re signed in when you visit Ning.com, you’re presented with information 
as explained in Chapter 1. In the stream below your status update box, you 
encounter featured networks and recommended networks. These entries in 
your stream also include a Join link.

Part I: An Overview of Ning 
Manny’s Ten Favorite Networks on Ning
Ning has a network for everyone, no matter what your interests are. To give 
you a feel for the kinds of networks you can find and join on Ning, I’ve com-
piled a list of my favorite networks for you:
 
✓ AlternativeEnergy.com (http://alternativeenergy.com): Tightly 
integrated with lots of resources about green and renewable energy, this 
network has been named one of the top 100 networks for people who 
want to change the world.
 
✓ ASPCA Online Community (http://aspcacommunity.ning.com): 
This network is a thriving community that supports the objectives of the 
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
 
✓ Classroom 2.0 (www.classroom.com): This social network is aimed at 
those interested in Web 2.0 and collaborative technologies in education.
 
✓ Firefighter Nation (www.firefighternation.com): This is a vibrant 
professional and social network for current and former fire, rescue, and 
EMS professionals.
 
✓ Im Saturn – u r 2 (http://imsaturn.com): This gorgeous-looking net-
work is for Saturn drivers, employees, fans, and enthusiasts. The Saturn 
team runs regular contests such as Kiss My Astra and On The Road with 
Bon Jovi.
 
✓ Ingles Verde Amarelo (http://verdeamarelo.ning.com): This 
social network in Portuguese helps Brazilians learn English, connecting 
them with English speakers who are interested in learning about Brazil.
 
✓ NAVY For Moms (http://navyformoms.ning.com): This network is 
aimed at mothers who have sons and daughters in the U.S. Navy and for 
mothers with questions about life in the Navy for their kids.
 
✓ The Spill.com (http://my.spill.com): This network offers videos 
of movie reviews given by animated characters discussing the newest 
films. This network also provides a great space for movie buffs to 
exchange their thoughts about flicks old and new.
 
✓ ThisIs50 (http://thisis50.com): Though I’m not a huge fan of the 
content on it, at more than 400,000 members, this social network is a 
testimony to the kind of growth that a social network on Ning can 
experience.
 
✓ TuDiabetes (http://tudiabetes.com): This network is a place for 
people touched by diabetes. (I am partial to this network, since I started it.) 
Many of the examples in this book are borrowed from my experience with 
TuDiabetes.com.

 Chapter 2: Joining an Existing Network on Ning
Joining a Network
Broadly speaking, you can find two kinds of networks on Ning:
 
✓ Public networks are visible to everyone, and anyone can become a 
member of them.
 
✓ Private networks are visible only to members. Some private networks 
are set up in a way that lets anyone become a member; others are set 
up to allow only invited people to sign up. In this case, only after you get 
an invitation from any member of the network can you create a member 
profile. See the “Joining a private network” section, later in this chapter, 
for more details.
The following sections give you step-by-step instructions for joining both 
types of network.
Joining a public network
In the following steps, I explain the process of joining a public network:
 
1. Find the network you want to join, as described in the earlier section 
“Finding a Network to Join.”
 
 Public networks display a box in the top-right corner, giving visitors two 
options: Sign Up or Sign In, as shown in Figure 2-1.
 
2. Click the Sign Up link.
 
 You’re taken to a page where you need to enter the information shown 
in Figure 2-2. This step is identical for all networks on Ning. By signing 
up, you agree to Ning’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy . . . you 
know, that fun and detailed fine print that you always read.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Your first 
step to join 
a public 
network is 
to click the 
Sign Up link.
 

28
Part I: An Overview of Ning 
 
Figure 2-2: 
On this 
page, you 
enter your 
e-mail 
address, 
password, 
birthday, 
and a super-
secret code.
 
 
3. Enter the following information:
 
• Email Address: You need an e-mail address to sign up for (and, 
later, to sign into) networks on Ning.
 
• Password: You’re required to enter and retype your password.
 
• Birthday: Your date of birth is required to confirm you’re eligible to 
use Ning.
 
• Type the Code on the Right: This is required so that Ning can make 
sure you aren’t a machine, but a human . . . you are a human, right?
 
 If you have problems signing up, click the Problems Signing Up? link next 
to the Sign Up button. You’re taken to the Problems Signing Up or 
Signing In page, which gives you the option to reset your password, 
details the system requirements to successfully sign up (or sign in), and 
gives you a link to the Ning Help Center (http://help.ning.com) in 
case you’re still experiencing problems signing up.
 
 Alternatively, to reset your password, click the Click Here to Reset Your 
Password link. The page you are taken to gives you a field to enter your 
e-mail address. After you do so, click the Reset Password button, and an 
e-mail is sent to you with a link that you can click to change your password.

29
 Chapter 2: Joining an Existing Network on Ning
 
4. Click the Sign Up button.
 
 You’re taken to the Create Your Profile page (see Figure 2-3), where you 
create your profile and complete any signup questions specific to the 
network you’re joining.
 
Figure 2-3: 
The Create 
Your Profile 
page lets 
you create 
your mem-
ber profile.
 
 
5. To create your profile, fill in the following fields:
 
• Name: This is a required field. Though you can enter anything 
here, I recommend that you type in something that will identify 
you as uniquely as possible in the network. In case you’re wonder-
ing, you’re allowed to have the same name as someone else who 
already is a member in the network.
 
• Profile Photo: You can choose to leave the default photo the net-
work has for new members, but it’s a very good idea to add one 
from your own crop. If you don’t feel comfortable adding a photo 
showing your face, at least consider adding an image that distin-
guishes you.

30
Part I: An Overview of Ning 
 
 To add a profile photo, click the Browse button. This opens a new 
window that lets you upload a new image from your computer.
 
• Gender: You can choose between Male and Female, and you can 
opt to not display your gender information by selecting the Don’t 
Display check box.
 
• Country: When you click this drop-down list, you get a complete 
list of countries. When you choose any country besides the United 
States, a new text box opens below the drop-down list, letting you 
enter your City and State. If you choose the United States, you’re 
prompted for your ZIP code. Your city, not your ZIP code, is the 
one displayed on your profile page once you are done signing up.
 
 Following the profile questions are any signup questions specific to the 
network. For instance, in TuDiabetes, I ask members whether they have 
diabetes, what type of diabetes they have, when were they diagnosed, 
and what glucose meter they use, among other things.
 
 Signup questions with an asterisk next to them are required. Questions 
with a lock next to them are private and visible only to you and the net-
work’s Administrators.
 
6. Answer all the required questions and then click the Join button at 
the bottom of the page.
 
 This takes you to your profile page. At this point, you can pat yourself 
on the back! You’re officially a new member of the network.
Your profile is not set in stone. You can make changes to it, as I discuss later 
in this chapter, in the “Tweaking Your Profile” section.
Joining a private network
You know a network is private if you don’t see the network’s main page. 
Instead, when you enter the network’s URL in your browser, all you can see is 
the network’s Sign In page, as shown in Figure 2-4.
Private networks can be set up in one of two ways:
 
✓ To allow anyone to become a member: If this is the case of the network 
you want to join, you can simply join by clicking the Sign Up link and fol-
lowing the steps outlined in the previous section.
 
✓ To allow only invited people to become a member: If this is how the 
network is set up, the Sign In page is different — it has no Sign Up button. 
You can sign up only by clicking the link in the invitation e-mail you were 
sent by a member of the network. If you don’t have an invitation . . . well, 
as the Seinfeld-ism goes, no soup for you!

31
 Chapter 2: Joining an Existing Network on Ning
 
Figure 2-4: 
Private 
networks 
don’t show 
you the 
network’s 
home page. 
Instead, you 
see only the 
Sign In/Sign 
Up page.
 
There’s a special case, regardless of the network being public or private. The 
Network Creator may have set up the network to approve any new members 
before they can join. If this is the case, after you click the Join button, you’re 
presented with a message informing you that your membership is pending 
approval. You have the option to withdraw the request to become a member 
by clicking the Withdraw Request link, as shown in Figure 2-5. 
You receive an e-mail when your profile has been approved. If your profile is 
not approved, the network administrators can send you a personal message 
or contact you via e-mail, letting you know why. You can attempt to sign up 
again and make any necessary changes to your profile so the second time it 
gets approved.

networks

new mem-
bers before

Part I: An Overview of Ning 
Tweaking Your Profile
After you join a network, you can make changes to your profile as often as 
you need to. When you want to tweak your profile, the first thing to do is 
click the My Page tab on the top navigation, which brings you to your profile 
page. Some of things you can do on your profile are:
 
✓ Change your theme. Your theme is the way your profile page looks: 
background colors, font colors, font types, font sizes, and so on. As 
long as your Network Creator didn’t disable this option, you can change 
your theme by clicking the My Page tab of the network and clicking the 
Theme link below your profile photo. The page you’re taken to is almost 
identical to the one the Network Creator can use to change the net-
work’s theme, and so are the options available to you, so you can give 
your profile page as much personality as you want. Check out Chapter 8 
for more details on how to do this.
 
✓ Change the layout of your page. You can move most of the boxes on 
your profile page around to your heart’s content. Being able to do this 
and changing your theme are two great ways available for you to cus-
tomize your profile page.
 
 To move boxes on your profile page around, position your mouse on 
top of the header of a box you want to move. The shape of your mouse’s 
cursor will change to a hand, and a little box with four arrows pointing 
in four opposite directions appears (as shown in Figure 2-6) in the top-
left corner of the box. When you see these appear, click the box’s bar, 
drag it to where you want to place it, and drop it.
 
 Don’t get frustrated if you can’t move some boxes to some places on 
your profile page. For instance, OpenSocial applications (discussed in 
Chapter 21) and the Comment Wall can’t be moved out of the middle 
column. And don’t even dream of moving the profile photo and My 
Friends modules: They’re locked where you see them.
 
✓ Edit your Latest Activity. When you click the Edit button at the top right 
of the Latest Activity box on your profile page, a panel opens up. In it is 
a drop-down list that lets you pick how many events you want to show 
in your Latest Activity box: 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20.
 
✓ Add an RSS feed. If you have a blog, you may appreciate the ability to 
add an RSS feed to your page. For details on what RSS feeds are and 
how to add them to your profile page, refer to the section that discusses 
including RSS feeds on your main page in Chapter 9. Adding RSS feeds 
on your profile page works in very much the same way.

Chapter 3
Privacy, E-Mails, and 
Friends on Ning
In This Chapter
▶ Controlling your privacy settings
▶ Controlling what e-mails you receive
▶ Managing friends
P
rivacy likely falls at the top of the list of your priorities when you go 
online — and if not, it should. Because sites require you to put so much 
of your personal information on the Web, it’s important for you to feel safe 
about it. With any online service, you should be careful about the personal 
information you share, especially when entering sensitive information.
Ning helps protect your privacy online by requiring you to provide only an 
e-mail address to join a social network on Ning. Ning also provides a number 
of tools that ensure the information you’re posting is visible only to those 
you care to show it to.
This chapter focuses on the elements that networks on Ning make available 
to you, so you can keep the privacy of your profile page and the items you 
share through the network out of the reach of people you don’t want to be 
able to see them. Additionally, the chapter deals with the controls you have 
over the kind of e-mail notifications you receive from your network.
 
Before you dive into privacy on Ning, keep something in mind at all times: No 
privacy settings will protect you if you don’t exert common sense while you 
participate in a network on Ning or any Web site. So be mindful of your 
choices and what you share about yourself when you’re online.

36
Part I: An Overview of Ning 
Controlling Your Privacy Settings
In Chapter 2 I show you how to join an existing network on Ning. After you 
sign up, you’re asked a few profile questions. The Network Creator adds 
these during the setup of the network. They may range from simply asking 
about the country you live in all the way to detailed questions about personal 
matters. Some of the questions may be optional, and some may be required. 
At all times, use common sense when answering questions during the sign-up 
process.
For example, writing the city where you live is probably okay; giving your full 
address is a bad idea. Adding a photo of yourself is perhaps not a big deal; 
exhibiting a less-than-glamorous picture of you and your friends after a 
party is a great recipe for losing points when applying for a job. You get the 
picture . . . no pun intended!
If something smells fishy . . .
If a profile question smells fishy, don’t answer it! If it’s a required question, 
try to type something to meet the requirement without giving away more 
information than you should.
In this case, it’s best to stop the signup process immediately, go to http://
help.ning.com, and report the network. The folks at the Ning Help Center 
will investigate the situation and take any necessary action.
Managing your profile
After you’ve signed up and answered all the registration questions, you can 
go back to modify the details in your profile at any time. You do this by click-
ing the Settings link at the top right of any page on the network. You’re taken 
to the My Settings – Profile page, as shown in Figure 3-1.
This page is the first place where you can modify information that others see 
about you if you entered information when you signed up. If you make any 
changes to your profile, after you’re done, scroll down to the bottom of the 
page and click the Save button.

37
 Chapter 3: Privacy, E-Mails, and Friends on Ning
 
Figure 3-1: 
This page 
lets you edit 
your profile 
and your 
answers to 
the profile 
questions.
 
Here are some ideas of ways to keep your personal information more private 
in your profile:
 
✓ Name: This is how you’re known in the network. You may feel com-
pletely comfortable using your actual name, but unless the network 
requires you to enter your full name as part of its terms of use, you may 
want to consider using only part of your name (such as Manny) or a 
generic username (like Manny_Mo) to keep your identity more private.
 
✓ Birthday: Your full birthday (month, day, and year) is not visible to 
anybody but the Network Creator and the Administrators. Your age in 
years is displayed on your profile, and your birthday gets displayed on 
the network (for others to congratulate you) unless you select the check 
box next to Don’t Display My Age.
 
✓ Gender: In the same way as your birthday, if you don’t select the check 
box next to Don’t Display, your gender is displayed on your profile page. 
This may not be a big deal, but consider yourself informed about this.
 
Network Creators and Administrators don’t have access to your password 
information unless you give it to them. Not even the folks at Ning have access 
to your password. Only you know your password, so keep it that way. It’s in 
your best interest.

38
Part I: An Overview of Ning 
Your privacy in the network
Clicking the Privacy button to the left of the My Settings – Profile page (refer 
to Figure 3-1, earlier in this chapter) takes you to the Privacy page (shown in 
Figure 3-2). This page gives you extremely granular control over a number of 
things related to your contributions, your information, and even your actions 
and how others can reply to your actions in the network. There’s so much 
going on in this page that it’s worth covering in detail:
 
✓ Who can view your profile page and friends? This option gives you 
control over who gets a chance to view your profile page and your 
friends on the network. Your options are Anyone (all people in the net-
work — and outside it, if the network is public), Members (all members 
of the network), and Just My Friends.
 
✓ Who can view your photos, videos, and blog posts by default? This 
option lets you choose Anyone, Just My Friends, or Just Me.
 
 You can override this setting for any photo, video, or blog post at the 
time you’re adding it, as explained in Chapters 4 and 5.
 
✓ Who can comment on your photos, videos and blog? This option also 
offers you the choices Anyone, Just My Friends, and Just Me, taking your 
control one level further. You can control not only who can view your 
contributions, but also who can comment on them.
 
✓ Do you want to approve comments before they appear on your blog? 
This option lets you choose between Yes and No. If you choose Yes, 
you have to approve comments before they appear on your blog. If you 
choose No, comments posted are published immediately. One good 
reason to approve comments on your blog (or elsewhere) is to avoid 
unwanted comments and spam.
 
✓ Do you want to approve comments before they appear on your com-
ment wall? This option works on your Comment Wall the same way as 
the previous one operates on your blog. You can see all privacy options 
up to this point in Figure 3-2.
 
✓ Who can view your events? This option gives you control over who 
can view the events you create in the network. The options, again, are 
Anyone, Just My Friends, and Just Me.
 
✓ Do you want to notify 3rd-party blog tracking services when you add a 
new post? This option effectively sets off the equivalent of an announce-
ment that gets sent to a number of services that operate by tracking 
people’s blog posts. As a result, others are able to more easily find out 
when you’ve posted on your blog. If you would rather stay under the 
radar, deselect the check box next to the word Yes.

39
 Chapter 3: Privacy, E-Mails, and Friends on Ning
 
Figure 3-2: 
The Privacy 
page gives 
you abso-
lute control 
over your 
privacy.
 
 
✓ Which of your actions should display on Latest Activity? This option 
lets you choose what kind of information you want displayed in the 
Latest Activity section in your Profile page. By default, all actions are 
displayed. If you don’t want a particular action to display on your Latest 
Activity, deselect the check box next to it. These are the actions you can 
choose to share, as you can see in Figure 3-3 (which shows the bottom 
half of the My Settings – Privacy page):
 
• New content I add: When you add a new photo, video, blog post, 
and so on.
 
• New comments I add: When you comment on someone else’s con-
tent or reply to a forum thread.
 
• New friends I add: When you add a new friend. See the following Tip 
for details on what happens when you decline a friend request or 
de-friend someone.
 
• When I update my profile: When you make any changes to your 
Profile page, such as changing the theme or your photo, or adding a 
bit more meat to the box where you can brag a bit about yourself.
 
• My events and my RSVPs: When you create an event or make up 
your mind about attending an event.

40
Part I: An Overview of Ning 
 
Figure 3-3: 
The bottom 
half of the 
Privacy 
page 
gives you 
additional 
controls.
 
 
In case you’re wondering, there is no option to display when you send 
messages to others, when you visit other profile pages, when you decline 
invitations, when you de-friend or decline a friend invitation from someone, 
or when someone gets banned from the network. The reason for this is 
simple: They don’t get displayed ever. So feel free to remove members from 
your Friends list if they become annoying. Nobody will be notified.
Controlling What E-Mails You Receive
E-mail is one of those mixed blessings. You have to be thankful for it, but it 
can be a disgrace when it’s out of control. Thankfully, networks on Ning give 
you very fine control over what e-mails you receive.
To start managing notifications, alerts, and member activity, click the 
Settings link at the top right and click the Email button on the left of the page 
that appears. This takes you to the My Settings – Email page. Here, you have 
a large number of options that let you choose what network activity you want 
to receive an e-mail notification for. All options are selected by default. To 
stop receiving e-mails associated with a particular activity, you need to dese-
lect the check box next to it, as shown in Figure 3-4. Your options are
 
✓ Messages sent to me: Your friends on the network can send you private 
messages in your inbox on the network. If you deselect this check box, 
you’ll find out about private messages sent through the network only by 
checking your network inbox. I talk more about your inbox and private 
messages in the section on communicating with members in Chapter 5.

41
 Chapter 3: Privacy, E-Mails, and Friends on Ning
 
Figure 3-4: 
The Email 
page lets 
you control 
which 
messages 
you get.
 
 
✓ Messages sent to groups I belong to: Some groups on the network may 
allow members to send messages to all the members in the group. All 
groups allow group creators and administrators to send broadcast 
messages to their group members. Deselecting this check box ensures 
that you don’t get e-mails when messages are sent to groups you are a 
member of. You can discover a lot more about groups in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Messages sent to my events: The creator of an event can send a mes-
sage to all event guests at any time. This is a great way for event 
creators to let guests know about changes to their events. You won’t 
receive these messages if you deselect this check box.
 
✓ Messages sent to the whole network: Network Creators and Adminis-
trators have the option to send broadcast messages to all members. 
If you deselect this check box, you won’t receive these e-mails when 
they’re sent. Unless you’re getting overwhelmed with broadcast mes-
sages from your network, I recommend you leave this check box 
selected because you may otherwise miss important communications 
from the network’s head honchos.
 
✓ Messages sent to all friends: Occasionally, other members may choose 
to send a message to all their friends. These resemble a bit more the 
kind of messages you get from folks who have a question, a comment, 
or a joke they feel like sharing with a large group of people that you are 
part of. Again, deselecting this check box will stop these e-mails from 
reaching you.

42
Part I: An Overview of Ning 
 
✓ Alerts sent via Applications: Networks on Ning give you access to appli-
cations. These are third-party tools and services to add features and 
functionality to your profile on a network. Occasionally, there may be 
alerts sent via applications that you won’t receive if you deselect the 
check box next to this option.
Certain activity by other members can also generate notifications that you 
receive via e-mail if you select the check boxes next to each of the following 
options:
 
✓ Friend requests: When someone in the network sends you a friend 
request. I talk more about this in the next section.
 
✓ People that I’ve invited to join this network: When someone you 
invited to the network becomes a member, you get notified.
 
 To invite someone to a network, click the Invite link in the top naviga-
tion. You can invite others by various means: by entering people’s e-mail 
addresses one by one; by inviting friends you may have from another 
network on Ning; by importing e-mail addresses from Web-based e-mail 
(Gmail, MSN, AOL, or Yahoo!); or by importing addresses from your 
Address Book application.
 
✓ I have new comments to approve: When someone posts a comment 
on your profile page or on any content you have added, and you have 
turned on comment moderation from the Privacy page in your network’s 
Settings, you get a notification.
 
✓ I have new network content to approve: This is an option that applies 
only to Administrators.
 
✓ Feedback and problem reports: This one, too, applies only to 
Administrators.
Last, networks on Ning give you the option to follow discussions and blog 
posts:
 
✓ Follow discussions and blog posts I add: This option results in e-mails 
being sent to you when someone replies to a discussion or blog post you 
start.
 
✓ Follow discussions and blog posts I reply to: This option results in 
e-mails being sent to you when someone replies to a discussion or blog 
post you reply to.
 
 If you’re a very active person in the network, leaving this option on 
results in a potential flood of e-mails. If you find you’re receiving too 
many notifications, it may be a good idea to turn it off.

43
 Chapter 3: Privacy, E-Mails, and Friends on Ning
From time to time, wouldn’t it be nice if you could unplug yourself from 
all conversations that you have been part of until that day? Networks on 
Ning give you that option. If you click the Clear My Follow List button at the 
bottom of the Email page, you will stop following any discussions and blog 
posts you’ve been following until then. Handy, huh?
Last, at the very bottom of the Email page lies the None check box, which 
will result in your receiving no e-mails from the network at all. (It’s a nuclear 
bomb of sorts that is second only to leaving the network altogether.) 
Selecting this option makes sense only if you feel overwhelmed by the sheer 
amount of messages you’re getting from the network.
Managing Friends
Friends in social networks, as in real life, are the people you trust enough to 
tell them things you wouldn’t share with others out there. Because of that, in 
networks on Ning, friends are also given special treatment:
 
✓ Only your friends can send you private messages in the network.
 
✓ You can set any content you post on the network so that only your 
friends can view it.
 
✓ You can also set content you post on the network so that only your 
friends can comment on it.
This section deals with friends: how you add them and how you accept 
friendship requests. I also tell you how you block messages from friends, 
how you decline friendship requests, and how you de-friend (unfriend, anti-
friend?) someone.
Adding or accepting a friend
There are two ways to become someone’s friend in a network:
 
✓ You add that person as a friend.
 
✓ That person adds you as a friend, and you accept.

44
Part I: An Overview of Ning 
You can add someone as a friend in a couple of different ways:
 
✓ Click the profile photo of any member, anywhere on the network. That 
takes you to the person’s profile page. Below the person’s image at the 
top left, click the Add as Friend link, as shown in Figure 3-5. This request 
then goes to the person, and she can accept it or ignore it. I explain later 
in this section how the request gets accepted (or ignored).
 
✓ Click the Add as Friend link above any discussion topic, blog post, 
photo, or video posted by another member. Figure 3-6 shows an exam-
ple of how this looks like in the case of a photo. It looks exactly the same 
way with videos, discussion topics, and blog posts.

 Click to add this person as a friend
Finding new friends that meet a specific profile (such as living in your same 
area or enjoying the same things as you do) is easy thanks to the Advanced 
Member Search functionality. To perform an advanced member search, go to 
the Members page and then click the Advanced Member Search link next to 
the Search Members button. The page you’re taken to gives you the option to 
select among a number of parameters directly related to members’ answers 
to the profile questions during sign-up.
Also, you can become someone else’s friend by accepting his request to 
become his friend. If your e-mail settings are set to notify you when someone 
sends you a friend request, you receive an e-mail when this occurs. The mes-
sage you receive gives you a link that takes you to your My Friends page, as 
shown in Figure 3-7.

Click to add this person as a friend
To accept the friend request, click the Accept button. That adds the member 
to your Friends list. To decline the request, click the Ignore button. The 
person won’t be notified, so you don’t have to worry about that.
 
Figure 3-7:

If you’ve chosen not to receive notifications about friend requests or if, for 
any other reason, you need to get to your My Friends page, click the Friends 
link in the top-right section of the network. Also, next to the Friends link you 
can click a link that shows the number of outstanding friend requests you 
have waiting for you to accept or ignore.

Part I: An Overview of Ning 
Blocking and removing friends
Occasionally, you may be annoyed by someone who is your friend in the net-
work. There’s a way for you to block her without removing her as a friend. To 
block messages from a friend, here’s what you do:
 
1. Go to the friend’s profile page and then click the Block Messages link 
below her image, as shown earlier in Figure 3-5.
 
 This opens a box asking you to confirm whether you want to block all 
future messages and invitations from this person.
 
2. Click the OK button.
 
 You will no longer receive all those messages, yet you will still be friends 
with this person: the best of both worlds!
Unfortunately, things don’t always work out between friends: Friendships get 
tarnished, and at times you find out that the person you thought was your 
friend really isn’t. Networks on Ning also let you handle these cases gracefully.
Directly above the link to block a member’s messages is the Remove as Friend 
link (in the same place where the Add as Friend link appeared previously). 
If you click this link, you’re prompted to confirm whether you’re sure that 
you want to remove the person as a friend. If you click the OK button, this 
removes the person from your list of friends, with the following implications:
 
✓ She will no longer be able to send you private messages in the network.
 
✓ She will no longer be able to view the content you set as being for 
friends to view.
 
✓ She will no longer be able to comment on the things you set as being for 
friends to comment on.
Fortunately for you, blocked and removed friends don’t get notified when you 
take these actions. They may still yell at you when they see their messages 
unanswered, but that will be up to you to deal with.

Part II
Using an Existing 
Network on Ning

In this part . . .
T
here isn’t much point in setting up a profile in a social 
network on Ning and not joining the fun. Social net-
works give you (as a member) the means to easily add 
multimedia content and to communicate with other mem-
bers in a more individual way as well as tools to interact 
with many other members at the same time.
This part of the book gives you the information you need 
to participate actively in a social network on Ning while 
making the most of all its features.

Chapter 4
Adding Multimedia Content 
to the Network
In This Chapter
▶ Adding and editing photos and albums
▶ Adding videos
▶ Adding music and audio podcasts
▶ Understanding copyright
M
ost people love looking at photos, watching videos, and listening to 
music. It’s just how people are. Photos bring back memories, videos 
make you laugh or think, and music wakes up the singer you have hidden 
inside of you — even if it’s just while you’re taking a shower!
So it’s no surprise that photos, videos, and music are among the most popular 
content you can add or check out on a network on Ning. As soon as you join 
a network on Ning (which you read about in Chapter 2), you can start adding 
multimedia content to it.
In this chapter, you discover how you can add some photos, videos, and 
music from your own crop to a network you’re a member of.
Photos
If you’re old enough to remember what life was like before the Web, you 
probably remember that photos used to be printed in labs where rolls of film 
were developed. This was not only expensive, but also inconvenient because 
you had to wait anxiously to check out your photos, only to find out too late 
that the “amazing” shot you took of the Grand Canyon during your vacation 
was out of focus.
Fortunately, digital cameras have made these photo nightmares a thing of the 
past, and you can now take tons of pictures until you feel happy with the result.

50
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
With the advent of digital photography and more people taking more 
photos than ever before, new Web sites began to appear that allowed 
people to share their photos. Some good examples of these sites are Flickr, 
Photobucket, and Picassa.
As a member of a network on Ning, you can browse through the photos that 
others have added to the network, or you can add your own photos by using 
a number of convenient features. The next few sections walk you through the 
details involved in viewing, adding, and editing photos and albums on your 
network.
Viewing a network’s photos
When you click the Photos tab in the top navigation of your network, you 
land on the Photos page. You’re sure to discover a lot about your fellow 
network members and the topic of your network simply by checking out the 
photos in this section.
On the Photos page, you can view all photos that other members are okay 
with you viewing. You can also view all the albums that any member has 
created. You can also access your own photos (if you’ve gotten started with 
your photo-sharing frenzy), your own albums, and the photos that you may 
have marked as Favorites.
At the top of the page, you can see photos that have been featured by an 
Administrator of the network. Below the Featured Photos section, under the 
All Photos heading (see Figure 4-1), you can view all photos in the network 
and search for photos by typing a name or keyword in the text box and click-
ing the Search Photos button.
You can also sort photos by using the Sort By drop-down list on the right. 
Your sorting options are
 
✓ Latest: Shows the latest photos. (This is the way photos are shown 
by default.)
 
✓ Top Rated: Shows the top-rated photos. (Photo rating is explained in 
Chapter 5.)
 
✓ Most Popular: Shows the most popular ones (those that have been 
viewed the most).
 
✓ Random: If you’re feeling a little adventurous, you can simply view 
photos at random.
You can view the network’s photos in a slideshow by clicking the View 
Slideshow link on the left, under the All Photos heading.

51
 Chapter 4: Adding Multimedia Content to the Network
 
Figure 4-1: 
The Photos 
page lets 
you search 
and view 
photos and 
sort them 
in multiple 
ways.
 
 
You can mark any photo or video as a Favorite by clicking the photo or 
video to view it and then clicking the Add to Favorites link below it. 
You can later view the items you’ve marked as your Favorites by going 
to the Photos page or the Videos page and clicking the My Favorites link 
at the top.
Viewing the photos added by others can be fun, but adding your own photos 
is even better. Networks on Ning allow you to add photos in many different 
ways. If you’re viewing photos and you start getting an itch to share your 
own, check out the following two sections, which cover two ways to add 
photos.
Using the bulk photo uploader
Commonly, as a good digital photographer, you will have a bunch of photos 
to upload. The folks at Ning have made it easy for you to do this by simply 
dragging and dropping them much like you would while moving files around 
your own computer.
You can upload photos that are up to 10MB. Photo formats supported by net-
works on Ning are .jpg, .gif, and .png.
By using the bulk photo uploader page, you can upload up to 100 photos at a 
time. To add photos with the bulk photo uploader, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add Photos link at the top of the Photos page.
 
 The first time you use the bulk photo uploader, you see a pop-up window 
asking whether you want to trust this applet, as shown in Figure 4-2. The 
applet that the pop-up asks you about is the Java applet that allows you to 
copy photos from your computer to your network.

52
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
 
Figure 4-2: 
Click the 
Trust button 
to use the 
bulk photo 
uploader.
 
 
2. Click the Trust button.
 
 You see two panels: one on the left, containing a list of folders in your 
hard drive, and one on the right, originally empty.
 
3. Double-click the folder where the photos you want to add to your net-
work can be found.
 
4. Select the photos you want to add and then drag them and drop them 
into the panel on the right, as shown in Figure 4-3.
 
 If you decide you don’t want to add a particular photo, you can drag it 
and drop it outside the right panel to remove it.
 
5. When you’re done selecting photos to add, click Next.
 
 You’ll be able to enter details for each photo as well as apply them to all 
photos you have uploaded, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
Figure 4-3: 
The bulk 
photo 
uploader 
allows you 
to drag and 
drop photos 
from your 
computer 
into your 
network.
 

53
 Chapter 4: Adding Multimedia Content to the Network
 
6. Enter the title, description, and tags for each photo.
 
 Adding a title will help others get an idea of what the photo is about, 
before they click it. The description isn’t as critical, but it helps provide 
more context for the viewer. Tags are like keywords that describe the 
photo in general terms (for example, “Empire State,” “building,” “sky-
scraper,” and so on).
 
7. (Optional) Designate whether each photo can be viewed by anyone 
in the network (and outside it, if the network is public); by just your 
friends; or by just you.
 
 This is a good example of how you can control the privacy of the con-
tent you submit to the network.
 
8. (Optional) Apply the same info to all photos you’re uploading by 
clicking the Apply This Info to the Photos Below button, as shown 
in Figure 4-4.
 
9. Click the Upload button.
 
 You’re taken to your Photos page when all the photos you’ve added 
have been uploaded.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Adding info 
to your pho-
tos helps 
people find 
them when

54
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
Adding photos one by one
If you have only a photo or two to upload or if you’re having problems 
with the bulk uploader, you can use the simple uploader. With the simple 
uploader, you can browse to find photos one by one and then add them to 
your network all at once by clicking the Add Photos button. It lets you upload 
up to eight photos at a time. In Figure 4-5, you can see the simple uploader.
Sending photos by phone or e-mail
If you’re one of the many people who have a camera included in your mobile 
phone, chances are good that you take photos with your cell phone while 
you’re on the move. To add photos to your network from your phone or via 
e-mail, go to the Photos page and click the Add Photos link. Then click the 
link labeled . . . By Phone or Email (located under the More Ways to Add 
Photos . . . heading).
The page you land on gives you an e-mail address that you can use to e-mail 
your photos. You can send only one photo per e-mail. The subject you type 
becomes the title of the photo, and the body of the e-mail becomes the 
description.
Assuming that you can send e-mails from your phone, this may very well be 
the easiest way you can add photos to your network.
 
Figure 4-5: 
The simple 
uploader 
lets you 
upload 
photos one 
by one.
 

55
 Chapter 4: Adding Multimedia Content to the Network
Importing photos from Flickr
If you have an existing Flickr account, you’ll appreciate the convenience of 
importing your Flickr photos straight to your network, which means you 
won’t have to upload them a second time. To add photos from your Flickr 
account to your network, click the Add Photos link below the Flickr logo.
You land on a new page where you get to choose what photos to upload. You 
have four uploading options, which you can choose by clicking the circle 
next to each:
 
✓ Most recent photos: This option lets you get your 10, 20, 50, or 100 most 
recent photos.
 
✓ Get photos from a set: This option lets you chose among the Flickr sets 
of photos you have created.
 
✓ Get all my photos tagged: This option lets you choose the photos that 
match a certain tag or keyword.
 
✓ Get all of my photos from Flickr: This option, as you would expect, 
allows you to bring all your pics from Flickr . . . just hang on tight while 
the upload happens.
Before you get the photos, you can also choose to get the descriptions and 
the full-size versions of the photos. This is accomplished by selecting the Get 
All of My Photos from Flickr and/or Get All of My Photos from Flickr check 
boxes above the Get Photos button.
However, if you plan on importing 20 photos or more, getting the descrip-
tions and full-size versions will significantly add to the time the import pro-
cess takes. So think well or go have a nice meal before you import all the pics 
you took during your most recent vacation . . . or, if you don’t mind the time, 
go fix yourself a cup of coffee while you wait.
At the time this book was written, Flickr is the only photo-management Web 
site that networks on Ning support for photo importing.
 
Before you can import your photos from Flickr, the Network Creator needs 
to set up Flickr importing. You can find out how to create a network on Ning 
in Chapters 7 and 8. After you’ve selected what photos you want to get and 
what information you want to get them with, click the Get Photos button. Your 
photos are imported, and you’re taken to the My Photos page, where you can 
click any of them and edit any details as you see fit.

56
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
Editing a photo
Regardless of the method you used to add a photo, you may feel compelled 
to change something about it.
First off, if you don’t want to have the photo up on the network anymore, you 
can delete it. To do this, just click the photo you want gone from the Photos 
page and click the Delete Photo link below the photo.
If you don’t want to delete the photo, you can edit it. To edit a photo, click 
the photo you wish to affect from the Photos page and then click the Edit 
Photo link below it. As you can see in Figure 4-6, you can do a number of 
things when you edit a photo:
 
✓ Change the title: You know . . . give it a little more personality beyond 
that IMG00988.jpg filename.
 
✓ Add or modify the description: This can help others find your photo 
when they’re searching.
 
✓ Edit the tags: You can also do this without having to edit the photo. 
Simply click the Add Tags link below the photo.
 
✓ Modify the photo’s privacy settings: Under the Who Can View This 
Photo? question, you can choose who gets to view the photo. You can 
make your photo available for viewing by Anyone, Just My Friends, or 
Just Me.
 
✓ Add or modify the location of the photo: It can be a ZIP code, a city, a 
venue, you name it.
 
✓ Rotate the photo: This feature comes in handy if you took the photo 
sideways! It can also be done without having to edit the photo by 
clicking the Rotate Photo link below the photo.
 
Figure 4-6: 
You can 
edit lots of 
things about 
your photos.
 

57
 Chapter 4: Adding Multimedia Content to the Network
When you’re done editing your photo, click the Save button. Or, if you decide 
you don’t want to submit your changes, click the Cancel button.
 
The page you see when you edit a photo has the same options and fields that 
you get when you’re using the simple or bulk photo uploader after the photo 
has been uploaded.
Creating an album of photos
Albums in a network on Ning work in similarly to real-life albums: They let 
you group photos that are part of the same event or occasion. But creating 
an album is far easier on Ning!
 
1. Go to the Photos page by clicking the Photos tab in the top navigation.
 
2. Click the All Albums link or the My Albums link at the top.
 
 Both links give you the option to create an album.
 
3. Click the Add an Album link at the top.
 
 The page you’re taken to shows your photos by default. If you want to 
create albums from the photos by other members, select the Everyone’s 
Photos option next to the words Choose From, as shown in Figure 4-7.
 
4. Drag the photos you want to add to the album from the box on the left 
to the box on the right, as shown in Figure 4-7.
 
Figure 4-7:

5. In the text boxes provided, type a title for your album and add a 
description.
 
6. (Optional) Rearrange the order of the photos as you need to by drag-
ging and dropping them.
 
7. (Optional) Change the cover of the album (by default, this is the first 
photo in the album) by dragging a new photo into the box next to the 
album title.
 
8. Scroll down and click Save and — voilà! — you have an album.
Sharing photos
As with photos, you can edit and delete albums if you need to. But with 
albums, you also have the option of viewing them as a slideshow, and you 
can even link to them or embed them as a slideshow in another Web site.
You can obtain the code for embedding the slideshow from the album page 
itself:
 
1. While you’re on the album page, click the Get Embed Code link, 
located on the left side of the page.
 
 Clicking this link gives you a couple more options, allowing you to con-
veniently share the album on MySpace and Facebook.
 
2. Copy the code in the text box labeled HTML Embed Code, as shown in 
Figure 4-8.

59
 Chapter 4: Adding Multimedia Content to the Network
 
3. Paste the code in the Web site where you want to share the video.
 
4. Save the changes on the Web site.
You can also obtain the embed code directly from the slideshow:
 
1. Click the View Slideshow link on the album page.
 
2. Click the Embed button at the top right of the slideshow.
 
3. Select the code shown in the middle of the screen and click the Copy 
to Clipboard button.
 
4. Follow Steps 3 and 4 from the preceding list.
Another way to share photos and all other content from your network is by 
clicking the Share link below them. (See Chapter 15 for more details on 
sharing items with members.)
Videos
Online video is everywhere. Most likely you’ve already had your first encoun-
ter with online video: Maybe you were catching an embarrassing moment 
by a celebrity on YouTube or a brilliant viral video spreading like wildfire 
through the Funny or Die site. Each day, more and more sites not only offer 
videos for you to watch, but also give you the option to embed video on your 
own Web site, and networks on Ning are no exception to this.
Through your network, you can conveniently upload your own videos or 
embed videos from other sources, such as YouTube. In the following sec-
tions, you find out how you can share videos with other members of your 
network and beyond.
Watching the videos on the network
Clicking the Videos tab in the top navigation of your network takes you to the 
Videos page.
On the Videos page, you can find all the videos uploaded by members of the 
network that they don’t mind you watching. (I explain about privacy settings 
in the section titled “Uploading videos using the bulk video uploader,” later in 
this chapter.) You can also access your own videos and other members’ videos 
that you have enjoyed and designated as your Favorites.

60
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
Starting at the top of the Videos page, shown in Figure 4-9, you encounter 
the Featured Videos heading. Below this heading, you find the All Videos 
heading, which lists all the videos in the network. The All Videos section also 
includes a search box, which you can use to find a specific video, and a Sort 
By drop-down list, which you can use to sort videos by the following criteria:
 
✓ Latest: This option sorts videos based on the date they were uploaded, 
starting with the most recent ones.
 
✓ Top Rated: This option sorts videos based on their average star rating, 
starting with the ones with the highest rating.
 
✓ Most Popular: This option sorts videos based on how many times 
videos have been viewed, starting with the ones viewed the most.
 
✓ Random: This option shows videos in no particular order.
 
Figure 4-9: 
The Videos 
page 
allows you 
to access 
videos 
uploaded by 
all members 
in the 
network.
 
When you click any of the thumbnails on the Videos page, you land on the 
page that houses that video on the network. If the video is playing back from 
another Web site (YouTube, Vimeo, and so on), it won’t starting playing auto-
matically: You have to click the Play button for the fun to begin.
If the video file was uploaded directly to the network, it will start playing as 
soon as it starts loading, so be mindful of this and make sure to keep your 
speaker volume down if you want to avoid having the rest of your office 
figure out that you’re procrastinating while you should be working.

61
 Chapter 4: Adding Multimedia Content to the Network
If you like the video you’re watching, make sure to let the other member 
know by adding a comment in the text box under the video and then clicking 
the Add Comment button. You can see an example of a comment on a video 
in Figure 4-10.
 
Figure 4-10: 
Don’t forget

some love 
for your 
fellow 
members

posted: 
Leave a nice 
comment 
or give it a 
good rating.
 
Embedding videos on another Web site
If you find a video to be particularly enjoyable or useful, you may feel com-
pelled to share it with others elsewhere, such as on your own blog or another 
Web site. Networks on Ning make it very easy for you to do this. These are 
the steps you need to follow:
 
1. While you’re on the video page, click the Get Embed Code link, 
located below the video.
 
2. Copy the code in the text box labeled HTML Embed Code.
 
3. Paste the code in the Web site where you want to share the video.
 
4. Save the changes on the Web site.
If the video was uploaded directly to the network (not embedded from 
YouTube or another Web site), it becomes another way for your network to 
get visits (which will be appreciated by the Network Creator) because people 
clicking the video land on the page that contains the video in your network.

62
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
Getting ready to upload a video
Just like with photos, watching other people’s videos is only half the fun: The 
real thrill comes with sharing your own videos for others to watch, rate, and 
comment on.
 
To rate a video or a photo, go to the video or photo page, look for the blank 
five stars below it on the right, and click the star that designates the rating 
you want to give.
Before you rush to start uploading videos, keep these things in mind to save 
time and avoid frustrations:
 
✓ Video files uploaded have to be 100MB or smaller.
 
✓ Networks on Ning support .mov, .mpg, .avi, .3gp, and .wmv formats.
Even if you stick to the supported formats when creating a video to upload 
to your network, once in a blue moon you may encounter an error message 
after you attempt to upload the video. This is a direct result of the kinds of 
algorithms used by your computer to generate the videos from the raw foot-
age: Sometimes movie files that have the same extension (WMV files are a 
good example) aren’t compatible and therefore may not result in a successful 
upload.
If you’re struggling with your video and your network doesn’t seem to want 
to cooperate, don’t blame it. Simply convert the movie file to a format that 
will result in an error-free upload process. To do this, Ning recommends 
using one of two applications, depending on what platform you use:
 
✓ If you’re a Mac user, you can convert your video files using a program 
called iSquint. You can download it for free at www.macupdate.com/
info.php/id/19769/isquint.
 
✓ If you’re a PC user, you can accomplish the same thing by using a 
program called Videora. It’s available for free at www.videora.com/
en-us/Converter/iPod/download.php.
 
Even if you use iSquint or Videora to ensure that your video doesn’t conflict 
with Ning when it’s being uploaded, make a habit out of playing it back using 
QuickTime or some other video player before you upload it. If the conversion 
process was not successful for any reason, you may save yourself some pre-
cious time and the frustration of getting an error message after a while.

63
 Chapter 4: Adding Multimedia Content to the Network
Uploading videos using the 
bulk video uploader
If you’re serious about producing videos, you’ll love the bulk video uploader. 
It lets you upload up to 30 video files at a time.
Like the bulk photo uploader, it lets you drag and drop files from your com-
puter’s hard drive into the network. To add videos through the bulk video 
uploader, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add Videos link at the top of the Videos page.
 
 The first time you use the bulk video uploader, you see a pop-up window 
asking whether you want to trust this applet, just like the one that 
appears the first time you use the bulk photo uploader.
 
2. Click the Trust button.
 
 You see two panels: the one on the left, containing a list of folders in 
your hard drive, and the one on the right, originally empty.
 
3. Double-click the folder where the videos you want to add to your net-
work can be found.
 
4. Select the videos you want to add and then drag them and drop them 
into the panel on the right.
 
 If you change your mind about adding a video or add a file by accident, 
you can drag it and drop it outside the right panel to remove it.
 
5. When you’re done selecting videos to add, click Next.
 
 The following page lets you enter details (title, description, and so on) 
for each of the videos, as shown in Figure 4-11.
 
6. As with photos, enter the title, description, and tags for each video.
 
 I explain more about adding this sort of info in the earlier section, “Using 
the bulk photo uploader.”
 
7. (Optional) Designate whether each video can be viewed by anyone 
in the network (and outside it, if the network is public); by just your 
friends; or by just you.
 
 This option gives you control over the privacy of your video, effectively 
letting you designate who can watch it. You can choose Anyone, Just My 
Friends, or Just Me.

been uploaded.
 
The upload process for videos takes significantly longer than the process for 
photos, due to the size of the movie files. Make sure to maintain the browser 
window through which the upload process is being conducted. If you need to 
conduct other business while this happens, open a new window or a new tab 
in your browser. If you navigate away from your upload page, you’ll interrupt 
the process and lose your work.
Adding videos one at a time
If you have a single video to upload or can’t get the bulk uploader to cut the 
video mustard for you, the simple video uploader will always come to the 
rescue.
To switch to the simple video uploader from the bulk video uploader, click 
the link at the bottom of the bulk video uploader page.
Like its cousin the simple photo uploader, the simple video uploader (shown 
in Figure 4-12) lets you upload videos one at a time.

tiple videos.
 
Sending videos by phone or e-mail
You can add videos to your network one at a time by sending an e-mail for 
each of them. To add videos to your network via e-mail, click the Add Videos 
link to get to the Add Videos page. From there, click the link . . . By Phone or 
Email (located beneath the heading More Ways to Add Videos . . .).
The page you land on gives you an e-mail address that you can use to e-mail 
your videos. (It’s the same address you use to send your photos.) You can 
send only one video per e-mail. The subject you type becomes the title of the 
video, and the body of the e-mail becomes the description.
Assuming that you can send e-mails from your mobile phone, this method 
also lets you add videos to your network from your cell phone.
Adding videos from other video sites
Just as you can conveniently import photos from Flickr, you can easily add 
videos to your network from YouTube, Google Video, and just about every 
other video Web site you run into. To add a video from another site to your 
network, follow these steps:
 
1. On the page where you found the video you want to add, find and 
copy the HTML embed code for it.
 
 For example, in the case of a video on YouTube, the HTML embed code 
can be obtained from the box labeled Embed to the right of the video.

66

2. Return to your network on Ning and click the Videos tab in the top 
navigation.
 
 This takes you to the Videos page. From there, click the Add Videos link 
at the top of the Videos page.
 
3. Click the Add Videos link beneath the heading Add Videos from 
YouTube or Google.
 
 You’re taken to the Add Videos page.
 
4. In the provided box, paste the HTML embed code you copied in Step 1.
 
5. Click the Add Video button.
Editing a video
In the same way that you can do with photos, you can delete any of the 
videos you’ve added. To delete a video, click the video icon on the main 
Videos page and click the Delete Video link below the video.
You can also edit all the details about a video you have uploaded. The only 
thing you can’t edit about the video is the video itself (that is, you can’t 
change the video file). To edit a video, click the video icon from the Videos 
page and click the Edit Video link below it. Figure 4-13 shows the Edit 
Video page and all the details that you can edit about a video:
 
✓ Change the title.
 
✓ Add or modify the description.
 
✓ Edit the tags.
 
✓ Modify the privacy settings.
 
✓ Add or modify the location of the video.

 Chapter 4: Adding Multimedia Content to the Network
Music and Audio Podcasts
Listening to music and downloading songs are two of the most popular activi-
ties online. Nowadays, services like iTunes, Amazon, Lala, eMusic, and Last.
FM (which are actually my favorite ones, in case you’re wondering) let you 
tap into your favorite music and either download it to your computer or play 
directly online (also known as streaming the music track).
Audio podcasts have also become staples of online life in recent times. As 
opposed to straight-up music tracks, audio podcasts typically contain inter-
views and spoken commentary. You can encounter podcasts about every 
topic under the sun, from politics to sports, from technology to business, 
from comedy to news. (I mean, news shows can be the complete opposite of 
comedy these days.)
It’s no surprise that networks on Ning give you the option to upload music 
and audio podcasts and listen to the ones you and other members have 
added. In the following sections, you find out all about the Music Player 
option and how to use it to share audio tracks.
Listening to the tracks 
on the Music Player
All the music and audio podcasts in the Music Player are part of a playlist. 
The playlist determines the order in which the tracks are listed for playback. 
The Music Player lets you listen to the tracks on its playlist in a number of 
places in your network:
 
✓ To listen to a specific track, you can click that track and click the Play 
button directly on the Music Player in the main page of the network.
 
✓ You can also open a pop-up window by clicking the Open Popup Window 
button in the Music Player in the main page, as shown in Figure 4-14. 
Playing tracks from within the pop-up window allows you to continue 
navigating the network.
You can also embed the Music Player on another Web site. To obtain the 
HTML embed code for the music player, click its top-right corner. This “flips” 
the Music Player around, exposing the code. Copy the code and paste it 
within the HTML code for your Web site, and give your Web site visitors the 
chance to also enjoy your network’s Music Player.
 
Depending on how the network has been set up by the Network Creator, you 
may or may not be able to download the tracks that have been uploaded. If 
downloading is not allowed, you still can stream the tracks just fine; you just 
can’t copy them into your hard drive.

Figure 4-14: 
The Music 
Player 
shows 
you all the 
tracks 
available for 
you to 
listen to.
 
As soon as you begin playing a track, the top portion of the Music Player 
gives you the option to rate the track by clicking the number of stars you 
want to give it (which is the same way you can rate photos and videos).
You can also click the Add to My Page link directly below the playback infor-
mation on the Music Player. Doing this adds the track to the My Music box on 
your profile page, effectively adding the track to your own playlist.
Adding tracks to your playlist
The Network Creator sets up the network’s playlist, but you can create and 
manage your own playlist. You can add tracks to your playlist by choosing 
from the music in the network’s playlist or by adding your own.
To add tracks from the network’s playlist:
 
1. Double-click a track in the Music Player on the network’s main page.
 
2. When the track is playing, click the Add to My Page link above the 
Play button.
 
 This appends the track at the end of your playlist.
To add new tracks:
 
1. Go to your profile page.
 
2. Click the Add Music link below the My Music box.
 
 This takes you to the Add Music page. The Add Music page lets you 
upload audio tracks from your computer, as shown in Figure 4-15.

69
 Chapter 4: Adding Multimedia Content to the Network
 
3. Add tracks using either the simple uploader or the bulk music 
uploader:
 
• The simple uploader for the Music Player works just like the 
simple uploader for photos and videos. (See the earlier section 
“Adding videos one at a time.”)
 
• The bulk music uploader works just like the bulk uploader for 
photos and videos. (See the earlier section “Uploading videos 
using the bulk video uploader.”) By default, the bulk music 
uploader appears when you click the Add Music page. The bulk 
music uploader lets you upload 62 songs at a time.
 
Networks on Ning support only the .mp3 file format. You can upload up to 100 
MP3 files in total. Each file may be up to 20MB.
Another way to add tracks to the Music Player involves clicking the Edit 
Playlist link below the My Music box that’s located on your profile page. 
Then click the Add Music link below the . . . From Another Website heading.
As shown in Figure 4-16, this method takes you to a page where you can enter 
up to four URLs of audio tracks in text boxes. Then you simply click the Add 
Songs button. As a result, the Music Player establishes a link to the external 
MP3s you add.
 
Figure 4-15:

Music 
page lets 
you upload

from your 
computer.

Managing your playlist
Your network’s playlist can be managed in a number of ways. To manage 
your playlist, click the Edit Playlist link below the My Music box on your pro-
file page. You’re taken to the Edit Playlist page. As you can see in Figure 4-17, 
on that page, you can do all of the following things:
 
✓ Play tracks: You can play any of the tracks on your playlist by clicking 
the little button to the left of the track name.
 
✓ Reorder tracks: You can drag and drop tracks to change the order in 
which they are played.
 
✓ Delete tracks: You can delete tracks by clicking the Delete link to the 
right of the track you want to remove.
 
✓ Edit tracks: You can edit lots of details about each track by entering or 
editing the information in the appropriate field after clicking the Edit link 
beside the track name:
 
• The title of the track
 
• The artist
 
• The album name
 
• The album artwork
 
• Enable the download link for the track
 
• Allow another member to add the track to the My Music box on his 
or her member profile page
 
• More: Genre, Year, Label, Artist Site, Hosting Site, Label, whether 
the track has Explicit Lyrics, Label Site, License, License Name, 
and License URL

A Word or Two about Copyright
 
Just because you can upload music or add videos and photos to your network, 
that doesn’t mean it’s okay to upload a track by your favorite artist or post a 
skit from a popular TV show for others to enjoy. In case you missed the news, 
that’s I-L-L-E-G-A-L, and it can get you in trouble.
When you upload any kind of media to your network, you’re basically agree-
ing that you either have permission from the creator of the media or the 
copyright holder. (Maybe you are the copyright holder yourself.) In case you 
were wondering, here are the facts:
 
✓ Having paid for a CD or a few MP3s does not mean you have the right to 
distribute it.
 
✓ Renting or buying a movie doesn’t mean you can capture a portion of 
it and share it with your friends in the network. The same goes for TV 
shows you record with your DVR.
 
✓ That amazing pic by an Associated Press photographer that you saw on 
the home page of The New York Times . . . you guessed it: It’s protected 
by copyright laws!
Don’t kill the messenger: Those are just the rules.
So what can you do with this fantastic Music Player, you may be wondering? 
What can you do with it if you can’t upload any of that good music you have 
sitting on your hard drive? Here are three examples (far from a comprehensive 
list) to get your creative juices flowing. If you have specific doubts about a 

72
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
copyright matter, better get your checkbook ready so you can run them past 
an intellectual-property attorney.
 
✓ If you’re an up-and-coming artist: You have no record deal, and you 
essentially own all the music you have written and recorded. A network 
on Ning can be a great channel for you to use to share your music with 
others (not unlike what many bands and artists do through their pages 
on MySpace, for example). Before you do this, make sure to check with 
the Network Creator to verify that this is an acceptable practice in your 
network.
 
✓ If you’re great with words: You may have in your hands a great pod-
cast. You just sit in front of that microphone and hit the ground running, 
talking about the topic that makes you an interesting person to listen 
to. Sharing the podcasts you record is another great use for the Music 
Player. You can discover more about the world of podcasts by reading 
Podcasting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Tee Morris, Chuck Tomasi, and 
Evo Terra (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
 
✓ If you need records of your meetings: Some groups that have networks 
on Ning have conference calls with their members that they record for 
the convenience of others who were unable to participate in them. The 
Music Player is a great solution to help share these meeting archives in 
cases like these. (Granted, this isn’t the kind of stuff you would be tapping 
your feet to, but it’s helpful.)
 
Clearly, the same criteria apply for photos and videos. You have a world of 
photos you can upload: You simply have to have taken them yourself or have 
permission from the person who took them. Same with videos: Make sure that 
you’re not only the talent on the screen, but also the one with the rights to 
the video. Otherwise, you may find yourself dealing with some unnecessarily 
uncomfortable situations.

Chapter 5
Communicating with Others 
on the Network
In This Chapter
▶ Communicating with members
▶ Evaluating members’ contributions
▶ Blogging
T
hey say that those who find a friend find a treasure (or something like 
that, but you know what I mean). Communication, whether by private 
message or with a group in a chat room, is the backbone of your friendships 
on a social network.
This chapter delves into how members of a network can communicate with 
their friends and other members on the network. I talk about ways to do this 
privately and openly. You discover ways you can control the comments that 
others leave for you. You look at the ways that you can evaluate members’ 
contributions, and you go over the details of writing a blog on your network.
So buckle up and get ready to start connecting with others in the network. 
May you uncover many new treasures through your social network on Ning!
Communicating with Members
You talk to people on the phone, and you chat when you’re in a gathering. 
These are two examples of ways in which you communicate with others. 
One is fairly private and direct, just between you and the other person. The 
second one is more open, letting many people hear what you’re saying and 
also comment back to you.
Just like you can talk on the phone or chat at a party, you can communicate 
privately or publicly with other members in a network on Ning. The follow-
ing sections go over the tools that you have at your disposal to communicate 
with others in a network.

74
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
Sending private messages
In a network on Ning, you can exchange private messages only with two groups 
of people: your friends and the Administrators (including the Network Creator).
Private messages give you an ideal way as a member to communicate with 
other members in the network without everybody finding out about it. 
Because of the importance that private messages have for a social network, 
Ning has placed links to let you send private messages to other members in 
multiple places:
 
✓ On the member’s profile page, the Send a Message Link appears below 
the person’s photo, as shown in Figure 5-1.
 
✓ On pages for photos, videos, blog posts, and forum posts contributed by 
the member, the Send a Message link appears next to the member’s icon.
 
Figure 5-1: 
A member’s 
profile page 
is only one 
of the places 
where you 
can find a 
link to send 
a message 
to that 
member.
 Click to send a private message
When you click the Send a Message link in any of these places, you’re taken 
to a page that will remind you of your e-mail, as shown in Figure 5-2.
As with e-mail messages, you have room for three pieces of information:
 
✓ The recipient: Next to the To header appears the name of the recipient 
as a link back to the person’s profile page.
 
✓ The subject line: This is an optional field, but it’s a good practice to 
write something to give the recipient an idea of what the message is 
about.
 
✓ The message itself: You can enter only text in this box. Messages in net-
works on Ning do not currently support HTML or any kind of formatting.

75
 Chapter 5: Communicating with Others on the Network
 
Figure 5-2: 
A private 
message 
looks a 
lot like an

After you finish writing your private message, click the Send button, and after 
a brief confirmation message, off it goes. You get another brief confirmation 
message indicating that the private message has been sent, and then you’re 
sent back to the page where you clicked the Send a Message link.
Controlling private messages
All this sounds great, right? You can click the Send a Message link anywhere 
in the network to get a private message to anyone without any limitations? 
Wrong! This is where privacy kicks in, and Ning has thought of ways to pre-
vent people from contacting you if you don’t want to be messaged privately. 
Here are some restrictions, so you may feel more comfortable:
 
✓ Only your friends (and the Administrators) can send you private 
messages. I mean your friends on the network, so that gives you a first 
level of control because only you can add friends or approve friend 
requests being sent your way. Administrators, which include the 
Network Creator, need to be able to message you for obvious reasons: 
They run the network.
 
✓ Even if you’re friends with someone else in the network, you can 
choose to block messages from that person. Go to the profile page of 
the person you want to block. Among the links below the person’s pro-
file photo is one that reads Block Messages. Click this link, and after you 
confirm your decision (you’re prompted to do so), you will no longer 
receive messages from this member.
 
✓ You can remove a person from your friends list. Go to the profile page 
of the person you want to remove as a friend and click the Remove as 
Friend link. After you confirm your action, this member will no longer be 
your friend and, therefore, will no longer be able to message you.

76
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
 
If a person in your social network continues to try to contact you (through 
your Comment Wall, for instance) after you’ve blocked him or her, that person 
needs to be reported to the Administrators. To do this, use the Report an 
Issue link at the bottom of any page in the network.
Managing your messages and alerts
Just like your e-mail service, your network gives you a place where you can 
conveniently access, read, and delete all the messages you’ve received or sent.
You can read all your messages by clicking the envelope-shaped icon in the 
bar at the very top of your network or by clicking the Inbox link at the top 
right of any page. This takes you to the Messages section, defaulting to the 
Inbox tab.
As you can see in Figure 5-3, your network inbox starts by showing your 
received messages. Messages that you haven’t yet read are designated by a 
small dot to the left of the row that contains the message details. For each 
message, you see the date, sender, subject, and a few words that serve as a 
preview.
When you click any of the messages, the entire message gets displayed, 
giving you an opportunity to reply to the sender (Reply), reply to all per-
sons who received the message (Reply All), forward the message to others 
(Forward), archive the message in the Archive folder of your network’s inbox 
(Archive), delete the message (Delete), and block messages from the sender 
(Block Messages).

message by

link.
 

77
 Chapter 5: Communicating with Others on the Network
Besides reading messages you’ve sent or received through the network, in 
this section you can also review the alerts sent to you by applications you or 
your friends have added. I discuss these in more detail in Chapter 21, which 
is dedicated to OpenSocial applications. For now, all you need to know is that 
the Alerts tab to the right of the Inbox tab contains these messages.
If you click the Sent tab to the right of the Alerts tab, you can see the mes-
sages you’ve sent through the network. If you click the Archive tab to the 
right of the Sent tab, you can access the messages you’ve marked to be 
archived using the Archive link contained in them.
You can also compose a new message from within the Messages section by 
clicking the Compose link at the top right. This opens a page that looks quite 
a bit like the one shown earlier in Figure 5-2, except that it lets you choose the 
recipients from among your friends on this network or your friends in all net-
works, or you can enter one or more e-mail addresses, as shown in Figure 5-4.

Leaving messages on a Comment Wall
Work with me on this memory exercise: You’re back in college, living in the 
dorms, and you have a bulletin board on the door of your room. People can 
leave you notes letting you know to meet them at such-and-such place or tell-
ing you that they came looking for you and missed you. . . . Does this sound 
familiar?
Fast-forward to the present day, and turn to your network. You have a 
Comment Wall on your profile page (like the one shown in Figure 5-5), where 
other members can leave you messages in the same way. It lets members 

78
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
write something to you, include a link to another Web site, embed video from 
the network (as discussed in Chapter 4) or other sites, or post a photo for 
you to check out.
Moderating Comment Wall messages
Anybody in the network can leave you a message on your Comment Wall: 
People leaving messages don’t have to be your friends.
However, Ning provides you the means to control what appears and what 
doesn’t on your Comment Wall. If you click the Settings link at the top right 
and click the Privacy link on the left, you find an option on that page that 
asks “Do you want to approve comments before they appear on your com-
ment wall?” Essentially, if you select Yes, you set up your Comment Wall 
so that you have to approve all comments before they’re displayed. This is 
shown in Figure 5-6.
 
Figure 5-5: 
The 
Comment 
Wall on 
your profile 
page allows 
members to 
leave you 
messages.
 
If you choose to moderate comments before they appear on your Comment 
Wall, every time a comment left is by a member, the right column displays a 
notification indicating the number of comments to be approved. The notifica-
tion provides a link, which takes you to a new page where you can view the 
comments (see Figure 5-7). This page lets you approve the comment or reject 
it if you don’t want it to appear on your Comment Wall. You can also view 
comments that are pending your approval by going to your profile page and 
scrolling to the Comment Wall section.

Evaluating Members’ Contributions
Remember that song by The Beatles that went “I get by with a little help from 
my friends”? Or the one that said “All you need is love”? This was true back 
in the ’60s and holds just as true today in social networks on Ning.
Everyone likes being loved and getting appreciated for contributions. In 
a social network, the contributions are in the form of photos and videos, 
among other ways to share. One of the subtlest but nicest things you can do 
in a network is evaluate somebody else’s contribution by rating it, adding it 
as a Favorite, tagging it, or making a comment about it.
In the following sections, I discuss all these ways to evaluate the contribu-
tions made by other members.
Rating photos and videos
Rating things seems to be human nature. It’s everywhere: from the Olympics 
to American Idol, from YouTube to Digg. People like rating things, and 
because of that you can rate items on Ning. You’re given the option to give a 
rating of one to five stars to every photo and every video on your network.
To rate a video or a photo, simply go to the video or photo page, look for 
the blank five stars below the item on the right next to the word Rate (see 
Figure 5-8), and click the star that designates the rating you want to give.
As ratings get submitted, the average rating is displayed below the item on 
the left. It’s fun sometimes to just sit back and look at the average ratings that 
videos and photos get.
Adding an item as a Favorite
You can designate a photo or a video as a Favorite by clicking the Add to 
Favorites link below it. 
You can later view the items you have marked as Favorites by going to the 
Photos page or the Videos page and clicking the My Favorites link at the top.

videos and 
photos is 
very easy in 
a network

 These stars show the video’s average rating.
Click a star to rate the video.
Tagging items
Tagging is a new term that became popular with the start of the Web 2.0 
movement a few years ago as Web sites such as Flickr (a photo-sharing 
service) and del.icio.us (a social bookmarking service) came about. Tagging 
entails assigning keywords (or key phrases) to an item — whether it is a 
photo, video, or bookmark — to help describe it.
For example, if you add a photo of the Empire State Building, you can assign 
tags like newyork, building, and skyscraper to it. If you need to add multiple 
word tags to an item, you need to surround the words with double quotes (as 
in “new york”). Otherwise, they get treated as two separate tags: new, york.
Tags can be added to photos, videos, forum topics, blog posts, and events 
by the person who adds them, either as they’re being uploaded or by editing 
them later. This is explained in more detail in Chapter 4.
Tags make searching for items on your network easier in two ways:

82
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
 
✓ Items that are tagged with a certain keyword will appear in searches 
for that keyword that are performed in the network. So if you type 
New York in the main search box of the network (at the top right of 
the page), the Empire State Building you posted will appear. It will also 
appear if you type New York in the search box on the main photos page.
 
✓ Tags for an item are found below its rating, in the form of links. The tag 
links act as paths to help you find more items that also have the same 
tag. So if you click the newyork tag for the now-famous Empire State 
Building photo, you’re taken to a page that contains all other photos 
with the tag newyork. Tags provide a very convenient way to search for 
related items, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Tagging events
Tags in events are not called tags, but event types. But at the end of the day, 
they’re still tags: If you tag an event as party, whenever there’s a general 
search for the term Party or a search in the Events page using the term Party, 
the events that are tagged this way appear in the results.
Also, the event types you add to an event become clickable and lead to a page 
showing all other events that are of the same type. For example, Figure 5-10 
shows all the events with the event type Fundraiser. The power of tags in 
action!

tos in this

Commenting about contributions
You can leave comments on blog posts, events you have given an RSVP to, 
photos, and videos, as shown in Figure 5-11. Your comments may include the 
same elements as a comment you would leave on a member’s Comment Wall: 
pure text, links to other Web sites, and embedded videos and/or photos.

To leave a comment, type it in the comment box. To apply bold, italic, under-
line, and strikethrough format to the text, click the B, I, U, or S button, respec-
tively. If you want to turn a portion of the comment you leave into a link, 
select the text, click the chainlike button, and enter the URL of the page you 
want to link to. If you want to add an image to the comment, click the colored 
rectangular button. Last, if you want to insert a file into your comment, click 
the white document-shaped button.
If you want to, you can embed HTML code in the comment box, including 
embedding videos.
After you’ve left a comment anywhere in the network, you can delete it by 
clicking the little x symbol next to it. You can’t edit it, but you still can delete 
it and post a new comment the way you want it to come up.
 
Leaving sincere and useful comments on other people’s contributions will 
help earn you the trust of other members in the network.
Blogging in Your Network
Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock the past few years, you’ve heard of 
blogs, which are online journals of sorts: virtual containers for stories people 
write about themselves and others, on which readers can leave comments.
Quite possibly you have your own blog already. (If that’s the case, check out 
Chapter 9 to find out how to syndicate the content from your blog on your 
profile page through the use of RSS feeds, which is a great thing.) One of the 
great things about your network on Ning is that it lets you write your own 
blog. This is another way in which you can communicate with others.
Adding a new post from your blog page
You can start a new blog post in the following three ways:
 
✓ Go to your profile page and click the Blog Posts link below your photo. If 
this is your first blog entry, you’re taken straight to the Add a Blog Post 
page. (See the steps in this section for details on writing and posting 
a blog entry.) After you write blog entries, clicking the Blog Posts link 
takes you to your blog page, where you click the Add a Blog Post link to 
write more entries.
 
✓ Click the Blogs link in the navigation of the network. Once you’re taken 
to the Blogs page, click the Add a Blog Post link.

 Chapter 5: Communicating with Others on the Network
 
✓ Click the Quick Add drop-down menu that appears at the top right of 
every page. Select Blog Post from the options, as shown in Figure 5-12. I 
explain the Quick Add method in the next section.
If you want to add a blog post that you can format and add tags to, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Add a Blog Post link on your blog page.
 
 You’re taken to a page that lets you add the title and the body of the 
post.
 
2. (Optional) Add a title.
 
 If you choose to not add a title, the first few words of your post will 
become the title of the post. I recommend that you add a title.
 
3. Type your blog entry.
 
 If you’re unable to finish writing your blog post, you can click the Save 
as Draft button, which saves the current version of the post for you to 
later finish and publish.
 
4. Format your blog entry as desired.
 
 To make life easier, at the top of the text box where you enter your post, 
there are buttons to help you easily boldface, italicize, underline, and 
strikethrough words, as well as insert a link or an image or attach a file 
to your post. You can see this in Figure 5-13.
 
 At the bottom of the Add a Blog Post page (see Figure 5-14), you can find 
other blog posting options.
 
Figure 5-12: 
The Quick 
Add option 
lets you 
easily add 
new blog 
posts, 
discussions, 
events, 
photos, 
videos, and 
notes to the 
network.

your blog post and make it easier to find, as explained earlier in this 
chapter.

6. Choose a publishing date and time.
 
 You can just select Now if you want to keep it simple. Alternatively, 
select Choose a Date and Time and then set the date and time. For 
instance, you could use this feature to synchronize announcements you 
may want to make at times you won’t be in front of your computer.
 
7. Control who can view the post and who can comment on the post.
 
 Your options are Everyone, Just My Friends, or Just Me.
 
8. (Optional) Change your moderation settings on your privacy page by 
clicking the Change link.
 
 This opens the My Settings – Privacy page in a new browser window (or 
tab). After making and saving your changes, simply go back to your blog 
post, which is open in its original window.
 
9. Click the Preview button to see how your post will look after it has 
been published.
 
10. If you like what you see, click the Publish! button (see Figure 5-15) 
to make the post visible to others based on the privacy settings you 
selected.
 
 You’re all done! If, instead, you need to make any changes, go to Step 11.
 
11. Click the Back button to make any necessary corrections or additions.
 
12. When you’re ready to show your blog post to the world, click the 
Publish Post button, and voilà — you’re done!

Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
Adding a new post through Quick Add
When you add a blog post using the Quick Add drop-down list, instead of 
being taken to a new page, you’re presented with a floating box that allows 
you to enter the post title and entry of the post.
The box doesn’t offer any formatting tools (that’s why it’s called Quick Add, 
in case you were wondering), but it gives you the option to go to the full-
featured page (shown in Figure 5-13, earlier in this chapter) if you prefer the 
convenience of the formatting buttons. To switch to the full-featured format, 
click the More Options link in the floating box. When you’re ready with your 
post, click the Publish Post button.
Managing and editing your blog posts
Inspired bloggers are bound to write lots of blog posts. If this describes you, 
over time you’ll find the blog management page handy. To access this page, 
visit your profile page and click the link to your blog posts. On the page that 
appears, click the Manage Blog link below the header Admin Options.
The Manage Blog page shows the basics of all blog posts — date, time, title, 
and number of comments — along with all the means for you to edit or delete 
any of them (as shown in Figure 5-16):
 
✓ Edit a blog post by clicking the Edit link next to the post’s title or clicking 
the title itself. Doing so takes you back to a page that’s identical to the 
one you get while you’re creating a post. The difference is that it con-
tains the title and the body of the post you chose to edit.
 
✓ Delete a blog post by selecting the check box next to the post’s title 
and clicking the Delete button at the bottom. You can also delete a 
post from within the blog post itself by clicking the Delete Post link on 
the right side of the post.
 
✓ Preview draft posts. Another important use of the Manage Blog page is 
that it gives you access to any drafts of posts you may have saved in the 
past. By clicking them, you can edit, preview, publish, or delete drafts of 
blog posts shown on this page.
Moderating comments on your blog
On the Privacy page in your Settings, you’re given the option to moderate the 
comments posted by others on your photos, videos, and blog posts. If this is 

89
 Chapter 5: Communicating with Others on the Network
your case, the Comments tab on the Manage Blog page allows you to approve 
or reject comments posted by others. As long as you set up your Email 
Settings to notify you when you have new network content to approve, you 
get a notification every time there’s a comment for you to review.
 
Figure 5-16: 
The Manage 
Blog page 
gives you 
convenient 
access to all 
past posts 
you have 
written.
 
 
You can set up your blog, photos, and videos so that you can moderate com-
ments before they’re displayed. Visit the Settings page (link on the top right) 
and click the Privacy link on the left. Make sure you answer Yes to the question 
“Do you want to approve comments before they appear on your blog?”
If your blog isn’t set up to moderate comments, the Comments tab on the 
Manage Blog page shows you all the comments that have been posted by 
others on your blog posts. You can delete any of them if you so choose to by 
clicking the check box next to them and then clicking the Delete button.
Updating Your Profile Status
Last but by no means least, among the things you can do to communicate 
with others in the network is update your profile status.
In Chapter 1, I show you how you can do that from your Ning Activity Feed. 
When you update your status in your Ning Activity Feed, the new status is 
applied to all networks you are a member of.
You can also update your status on a given network by going to your profile 
page, typing your new status in the text box at the top (using 140 characters 
or less), and then clicking the button next to it.

Chapter 6
Interacting with Others 
on the Network
In This Chapter
▶ Participating in the forum
▶ Attending an event
▶ Joining a group
▶ Engaging in a chat
T
he key word in social network is the word social, and everyone has a 
very good idea of what that means. It involves people. Can you imagine a 
social network of one person? Not too exciting, huh?
Social networks come to life as their membership grows. Social networks 
on Ning become even more interesting as more and more people who have 
a common interest — whether it’s having gone to the same school or being 
fans of the same band — sign up and start participating and interacting.
When members start participating in the network, Ning offers many cross-
roads where they can interact with one another. This chapter is dedicated to 
these crossroads: the discussion forum, events, groups, and network chat.
Having Fun with the Forum
Discussion forums have been around as long as people have been connecting 
online (which, by the way, was before the advent of the Web as it’s known 
today). Forums lie at the heart of just about any successful online community 
that you can think of. Even more so, many successful online communities 
hover strictly around just a discussion forum because the forum gives par-
ticipants plenty of room to interact.

92
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
Considering the history of online discussion forums and their popularity, it’s 
no wonder that the forum lies at the heart of most networks you can join on 
Ning. In the following sections, I tell you a bit more about the forum and how 
it can help you interact with others in your network.
Starting a discussion
Hopefully the Administrators of your network have created different catego-
ries to help group discussions (existing and future) into neatly separate buck-
ets. Forum categories help you explore the content on the forum before you 
get busy creating a fantastic discussion topic . . . only to later find out that 
somebody else had already created it. If you’re an Administrator or you’re 
simply curious about how it’s done, I discuss how to set up forum categories 
in Chapter 11.
You get to the Discussion Forum page by clicking the Forum link in the navi-
gation of your network. Even if there are no categories in the forum and all 
discussions in the network live together on the main Discussion Forum page, 
shown in Figure 6-1, you can do a cursory search using the search box to find 
out whether anyone else has already brought up the topic you’re thinking of. 
If you don’t find anything, don’t worry too much over it: It’s totally possible 
that your topic is an original one, so get started with the new topic.

Discussion

and some 
categories.
 

93
 Chapter 6: Interacting with Others on the Network
To start a new discussion topic, click the Add a Discussion link at the top 
right from anywhere in the forum. This link takes you to a page, shown in 
Figure 6-2, where you can craft the first post of what will hopefully turn into a 
fruitful discussion. The elements that you need to fill in for a new discussion 
topic are
 
✓ Discussion Title: A title is needed to start a new topic. Spend a little time 
thinking of a good title, something indicative of what the topic is about. 
(“This is amazing!” would be a poor title choice, for instance.) Also con-
sider making the title as engaging as possible. (For example, “Are you 
in favor or against X?” would sound inviting to many people.) Last, try 
including keywords in the title in order to help make the topic easier to 
find through search engines.
 
✓ Post: This is the bread and butter of the topic. Make sure to elaborate 
your topic in the body of the post so the other members have access to 
enough information to understand your point.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Adding a 
new topic is 
simple, but 
try to think 
of a good 
title and 
give others 
some con-
text so you 
can spark 
a good 
discussion.
 
 
 If needed, you can take advantage of the formatting capabilities that are 
available (bold, italics, and underline). Including a link to a reference, if 
you have one, might also come in handy.
 
 Pictures speak a thousand words. So why not save yourself some typing 
by embedding an image as you’re creating the topic? To add an image, 
click the colored icon on the formatting toolbar above the Post text box. 
This opens a window, shown in Figure 6-3, where you can either find 
an image file on your computer or include the link to an existing image 
elsewhere and embed it in your new discussion. Click the Add button to 
finish the job: The needed HTML code is inserted into the text for you.

94
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
 
 You can also embed a video in your discussion topic. Just follow the 
same steps I cover in Chapter 4, using the HTML embed code, which you 
can get either from your network or from another video site.
 
Figure 6-3: 
You can 
either 
browse 
through 
your hard 
drive or 
enter the 
URL of an 
existing 
image to 
insert an 
image as 
part of your 
topic.
 
 
✓ Category: If your discussion forum has categories into which it is divided, 
you have the option to select where, among the different categories, you 
want your new discussion topic to be included.
 
✓ Tags: You can add tags to your discussion topic, to make the topic easier 
to search. You can think of tags as keywords that describe the topic.
 
✓ Attach File(s): To upload a file, click the Upload Files link below the text 
box for the post. This opens a panel that lets you find the file in your 
computer to attach to your post. You can attach up to three files to any 
discussion topic or reply to a topic.
 
 When you attach a file to a discussion topic, you can link directly to it 
from anywhere else. This can be useful if you want to reference the file 
outside the context of the discussion where you included it.
When you have all the ingredients ready, click the Add Discussion button and 
let the replies roll in.
 
Unless you change your e-mail settings, you automatically follow all discussions 
that you start or reply to. This means you will get an e-mail notification every 
time someone replies to your discussion: If your discussion becomes very 
popular, you may find yourself getting a few too many e-mails. You can avoid this 
e-mail backlog by clicking the Stop Following link at the bottom of the discussion, 
after it has started. You can also disable notifications through the Settings 
section: Click the Email link and deselect the Follow Discussions and Blog Posts I 
Add option and/or the Follow Discussions and Blog Posts I Reply To option.

95
 Chapter 6: Interacting with Others on the Network
Replying to an existing discussion
If your idea for a new discussion topic isn’t as new as you thought or if you 
find an existing topic that you feel compelled to participate in, you can easily 
join in the discussion.
If you want to reply to the topic that the discussion started with, just type 
your comment in the text box directly below it. You can format (using bold, 
italics, or underlining) and enhance your reply (with photos, videos, or 
attached files) in the same way that I describe in the preceding section. When 
you submit your reply, it appears in chronological order below any other 
existing replies to the main topic, and the left margin of your reply is aligned 
with the original post.
If you want to reply to someone else who has already replied, click the right-
pointing arrow next to the words Reply to This and enter your response. 
Depending on how your network’s forum is set up (threaded style or flat 
style), the text box for you to reply appears indented to the right below the 
post you replied to or in the text box below the original post that started the 
topic, quoting the post you’re replying to. The two kinds of forum setup are 
discussed in Chapter 11.
You can see the two kinds of replies in Figure 6-4. This figure shows replies in 
a forum set up with threaded style.
 
Figure 6-4: 
You can 
reply to the 
main topic 
or to some-
one else’s 
reply.
 
Participating in Events
When you think of the word social, the word event naturally comes to mind 
too: Events, after all, are part of your social life. Whether you’re referring 
to events taking place outside your computer (you know, in the real world, 

96
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
where most stuff happens) or you’re talking about chats, webinars, and other 
forms of online events, networks on Ning give you resources to RSVP for an 
event, create your own events, and invite others to attend an event.
Finding an event
You can find all the events that have been created on your network through 
the Events page. You can access this page by clicking the Events tab in the 
navigation at the top.
When you land on the Events page, you see at the top the events that have 
been featured by the Administrators. Directly below them are all the events 
existing on the network, as shown in Figure 6-5. Each event listing contains 
enough information to help you make up your mind about it. Listings also 
show your RSVP information for each event.
 
Figure 6-5: 
The Events 
page offers 
a summary 
of all the 
events in 
the network. 
You can 
access any 
event to 
learn more 
and RSVP.
 
If you can’t find an event you’re looking for and you think you know what it’s 
called or know a keyword that adequately describes it, you can search for it 
using the search box on the Events page. The results page contains a listing 
with all the events that match your search, arranging them in a similar way to 
the events on the Events page.
You can also find the event you’re looking for by navigating through the cal-
endar that’s shown in the bottom right. The calendar shows the current and 
next months and offers Last Month and Next Month links to let you go back 
or forward in time and find more events.
Days on which there’s at least one event scheduled appear as clickable on 
the calendar, and clicking any of the days takes you to a page that looks like 
the one shown in Figure 6-6.

97
 Chapter 6: Interacting with Others on the Network
 
Figure 6-6: 
You can 
display all 
the events 
scheduled 
for a partic-
ular day by 
clicking that 
day in the 
calendar.
 
RSVP-ing for an event
So you’ve found that conference you were looking for or that party you want 
to attend. Next, you have to RSVP for the event so that the organizer can 
get the right amount of drinks, food, and goods for all attendees — and also 
so your network friends know you’re going. To RSVP for an event, click the 
event you’re interested in attending on the Events page. You’re taken to a 
page that shows you the details about the event, as you can see in Figure 6-7. 
Some of these details are optional for the event creator to supply, so they 
don’t necessarily appear in all events.
 
✓ Event name: This information is shown at the top of the event in big 
letters — you can’t miss it!
 
Figure 6-7: 
An event 
page lets 
you learn 
more about 
the event, 
RSVP for it, 
and invite 
others to it.

Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
 
✓ Event time: This field shows you when (date and time) the event is set 
to start.
 
✓ Location: This field displays the venue where the event will take place.
 
✓ (Optional) City/Town: The name says it all.
 
✓ (Optional) Website or Map: This field can include a Web site where you 
can get more information about the event or a link to a map page show-
ing you how to get there.
 
✓ (Optional) Phone: This field can contain a phone number you can call 
for more information.
 
✓ Event Type: This field describes the event in general terms. Possible 
event types are party, conference, fundraiser, and meeting. Popular 
event types are shown on the right of the main Events page.
 
✓ (Optional) Organized By: This field can show the person or organiza-
tion responsible for putting together the event.
 
✓ Latest Activity: The date shown in this field indicates the last time that 
someone added a comment on the event or gave an RSVP for it.
 
✓ Invite More People link: If you’ve responded for an event, you can 
invite others to it — even if you’re not the event creator. See the follow-
ing section for more details.
 
✓ Export to Outlook or iCal (.ics) link: This link lets you export the event 
details to your favorite calendar application so you can have it as part 
of your schedule. Just click the link, and the necessary information is 
brought over to your Outlook or iCal program.
 
✓ Event Description: This description appears below the event details 
block, and it contains as much detail as the event creator added about 
it. The description is followed by two buttons that let you navigate back 
to the previous event in the calendar or forward to the next one — yet 
another way to find out about more things going on in your network.
 
✓ Comment Wall for the event: This Comment Wall works just like the 
Comment Wall for the members on the network. In case you’re wonder-
ing, no notifications about comments posted on the event page are sent 
to event attendees when other members leave a comment on the event’s 
Comment Wall.
 
✓ Your RSVP: When you’ve given your RSVP, your RSVP shows up. Until 
you enter a status, your RSVP appears as You Have Not Responded. 
After you find out all you need to know about the event, you can RSVP 
for it. If you’re unsure whether you’ll be able to attend, select the Might 
Attend option. If you know you’ll be attending, select the Will Attend 
option.
 
✓ Guest List: Unless the event creator chose to hide the guest list, below 
Your RSVP appears the list of attendees, followed by the list of those 
who might attend and those who are not attending the event.

99
 Chapter 6: Interacting with Others on the Network
After you RSVP for an event, that event appears in the My Events list. You can 
access your events in the following ways:
 
✓ Go to the Events page and click My Events at the top.
 
✓ Go to the Events page and view the items below the heading My 
Upcoming Events. This section will list the two next events that you’ve 
responded for. You can click the View All link below them to land on a 
page that contains all events you’re scheduled to attend.
 
✓ Go to your profile page and find your My Events list as one of the boxes.
Inviting people to an event
You don’t need to be the organizer of an event or the creator of the event in 
the network to be able to invite others to it. All you need to do is RSVP for the 
event. To invite others to an event, after you’ve given your RSVP, click the 
Invite More People link below the event details. You’re taken to a page like 
the one shown in Figure 6-8.
The Invite page gives you the flexibility to invite other members or people 
outside the network to an event. You can do this in a number of different ways:
 
✓ Enter Email Addresses: You can manually enter e-mail addresses of 
people you want to invite, separated by comas.
 
✓ Invite Friends: You can choose among your friends to send an invitation 
to the event.
 
✓ Import from Web Address Book: You can import contact information 
from Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, Gmail, or AOL Mail, simplifying the process 
of sending e-mail invitations.
 
✓ Import from Address Book Application: You can import contact infor-
mation by uploading your address book data in .csv or .vcf format 
from your Microsoft Outlook or Apple Address Book.
In addition to these options, Administrators are able to invite all members of 
the network to the event through this page. Regardless of the option you use 
to invite others to the event, you can include an optional message to go along 
with the invitation.
Creating an event
In this section, I show you how you can create your own event. For you to be 
able to create an event, the Network Creator has to set up the network’s pri-
vacy so that members are allowed to create events. 

100
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
 
Figure 6-8: 
The Invite 
page lets 
you invite 
people from 
inside and 
outside the 
network to 
the event.
 
To create an event, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add an Event link at the top of the Events page or any par-
ticular event.
 
 You’re taken to a page like the one shown in Figure 6-9.
 
 Event creation is a short process that involves filling out the details 
about the event and optionally sending invitations to the event.
 
Figure 6-9: 
To create 
an event, 
you need 
to enter a 
minimum 
amount 
of event 
details and

image.

 Chapter 6: Interacting with Others on the Network
 
2. Fill in the event information, which includes the following details:
 
• Name: This is a required field.
 
• Event Image: This is a required field. It may seem like something 
complicated, but it doesn’t need to be. If you’re holding a cookout, 
a photo with some food ingredients in it would work; if you’re hold-
ing a birthday party, a picture of a birthday cake gets the message 
across. All you really need is to find an image you can use to illus-
trate your event, which you can do using Google Images or other 
image search services. Just be sure you have permission from the 
copyright holder to use the image you choose.
 
• Description: This is a required field. It lets you format the informa-
tion you enter using bold, italics, underline, and strikethrough. You 
can also add links, images, and files to go along with it.
 
• Event Type: This is a required field. This is the equivalent of tag-
ging the event.
 
• Start Time: This is a required field. It lets you choose the date and 
time of the event. The minutes field gives you 15-minute increments, 
so you can set up only events starting at :00, :15, :30, and :45.
 
• End Time: This is an optional field. If you want to add an end time, 
click the Add End Time link.
 
• Location: This is a required field.
 
• Street: This is an optional field.
 
• City/Town: This is an optional field.
 
• Website or Map: This is an optional field.
 
• Phone: This is an optional field.
 
• Organized By: This is an optional field. By default, it shows your 
member name. If you’re creating the event on somebody else’s 
behalf, you can enter that person’s name in this field.
 
3. Manage the event’s privacy setting.
 
 Essentially, this privacy setting enables you to determine who will be 
able to see the details about the event and RSVP for it. You have two 
options:
 
• Public: If you choose the Public option (the one set by default), 
everyone in the network will be able to see the event details and 
RSVP for it.
 
• Private: If you choose the Private option, the event details will be 
visible only to those invited. These members will be the only ones 
who will be able to RSVP for the event.

4. (Optional) Select the Disable RSVP check box.
 
 Select this check box to disable the RSVP option. This may come in handy 
in the case of announcements that don’t involve space limitations or 
require planning for food or other amenities.
 
5. (Optional) Select the Hide Guest List check box.
 
 Select this check box to hide the guest list. This prevents people from 
peeking to find out whether some member they highly like (or dislike) is 
going to be in attendance (or not). Sorry, lurkers: no fun for you!
 
6. When you’re done adding all the details about your event and defin-
ing the privacy settings for it, click the Add Event button.
 
 You’re taken to a page that looks a lot like the one that you use to invite 
folks to an event (refer to Figure 6-8, earlier in this chapter).
 
7. Invite people to your event. (See the preceding section for the details.)
 
 This is a step you can skip if you want to, but clearly it’s in your best 
interest to invite others to your event; otherwise, you’re leaving it to 
chance that people will out about the event on their own.
 
 When you’re done sending out invitations, you land on your brand-
spanking-new event page, showing all the details about the event. How do 
you feel now? Better hurry up to get the place ready for all those guests!
Going Gaga for Groups
No matter how narrow the focus of a network on Ning is, there are always 
smaller niches that people are going to be interested in. Members of a fire-
fighters’ network (FirefighterNation.com is a good example) may want to 
connect with other firefighters in their state, firefighters who share their love 
for music, or firefighters who are experts on a particular kind of situation or 
equipment. The possibilities are, quite honestly, endless.
You can start your own network on Ning to focus on these subniches, but 
there’s a quick way to cater to most of the basic needs that a group of mem-
bers in your network may have: groups!
Groups on Ning give their members a number of tools that they enjoy in the 
network at large in order to help them connect and share with other mem-
bers of the same network. The following sections are devoted to covering the 
elements that make groups such a valuable element in your network.

 Chapter 6: Interacting with Others on the Network
Finding and joining a group
The Groups main page can be the place “where it’s happening” in many net-
works on Ning. Each group listed on it can be a hub of activity and discussion 
about some extremely specific topics. To get to the Groups page, click the 
Groups tab in the top navigation. Figure 6-10 shows a typical Groups page.
On the Groups page, you can
 
✓ Find featured groups listed at the top: This is a recurring theme in all 
sections of a network on Ning, showing any featured items for that sec-
tion up top.
 
✓ Find other groups listed below the featured ones: Depending on how 
active members have been creating groups, you may find anywhere from 
a handful to thousands of groups that range from a few members each to 
a ton of people participating in them.
 
✓ Search for a group: Performing a search for a group you may be inter-
ested in joining may be a useful first step. You can do this using the 
search box at the top of the All Groups section.
 
✓ Sort the groups: Another good idea is to change the way groups are 
sorted, to have a different view of them. When you first land on the 
Groups page, you’re presented with the most active groups. But you can 
change this to show you the ones with the latest activity, the ones with 
the most members, and the most recent ones (the “baby” groups in the 
network, if you like).
 
Figure 6-10: 
The Groups 
page in a

you join and

in existing 
groups, 
as well as 
create and 
manage 
your own.
 

104
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
 
 The most active groups are those with the most members, forum 
threads and replies, and so on. The ones with the latest activity will be 
those with the most recent comment on the Comment Wall, thread or 
reply in the forum, membership change, and so on.
Below the search box and the sorting drop-down list, you can find the listing 
of groups. Each group sports an image, its name, number of members, latest 
activity date, and a short description explaining its focus.
By clicking a group that interests you, you land on the group page. If the 
group has been set up as public (essentially, allowing any member to join it), 
you can join the group by clicking the Join link at the top right, as shown in 
Figure 6-11.
 
Figure 6-11: 
A group 
page lets 
you join 
(and leave) 
a group 
as well as 
interact with 
the group 
members.
 
If the group has been set up for moderated membership, you’re presented 
with an option to request access to the group. This request needs to be 
approved by the group creator or a group administrator before you can join 
the group and take part in it. Figure 6-12 gives you a feel for how a request to 
join a private group looks.
After you join an open group or get approved as a member of a private group, 
as long as your e-mail settings allow it, you receive a notification via e-mail, 
confirming your membership.
Participating in a group
Joining a group is really only the start of the fun (just like joining a social net-
work on Ning is only the beginning of your interaction with other members). 
Groups can develop an incredible life of their own, and they offer all kinds 

105
 Chapter 6: Interacting with Others on the Network
of nifty benefits to their members. Groups can contain RSS feeds pulling head-
lines and summaries of articles from another Web page. For example, a group 
of saxophone enthusiasts could pull saxophone-related news using an RSS 
feed from an outside site, thus giving members another reason to come to the 
group: They can get the latest news about the topic they care about. Groups 
give their members tools (as shown in Figure 6-13) — some informative and 
some interactive — that give meaning to their membership:
 
✓ A Comment Wall: The Comment Wall allows for back-and-forth conver-
sation among members of a group in a very nonstructured way, just like 
you can do on another member’s Comment Wall. The kinds of comments 
that can be posted can include formatted text; links; and embedded 
media, such as images and videos.
 
✓ A discussion forum: The discussion forum option in a group offers 
pretty much the same options that are available in the network’s main 
forum. The main difference is that there are no categories available for 
you to assign new discussion topics to. Besides this, the discussion 
forum becomes an excellent resource for people to engage in topic-
specific discussions.
 
✓ A group message option: You can message the members of a group. If 
the group creator has set up the group so that members can send mes-
sages to the entire group, above the members list you can find the Send 
Message to Group link. This gives group members a convenient means 
to get the attention of their fellow group members, effectively turning 
the group into a mailing list of sorts.
Groups can turn into very busy spots in a social network on Ning. If you don’t 
want to miss a thing, you can choose to follow the activity in the group. By 
default, when you join a group, you’re notified every time someone new joins 
the group and when any new discussions or comments are posted in the 
group.
 
Figure 6-12: 
Private 
groups 
require that

bership be

before

in them.
 

106
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
If you no longer want to receive notifications related to the group, click the 
Stop Following link at the top right of the group page. (You can still change 
your mind and opt in for notifications by clicking the Follow link at any time.)
If you decide that a group you joined is not for you anymore, click the Leave 
Group link at the top right of the group page, and you will no longer be 
among its members.
 
Figure 6-13: 
Groups are 
another 
way to be

Creating and managing a group
Starting a new group is one of the coolest things you can do in a network on 
Ning. It’s almost like starting your own network. As a matter of fact, it can be 
great practice for you to eventually start a new network with a tighter focus 
on a topic that may be too specific for your current network.
As I discuss in the previous sections, groups can offer a number of options 
for their members. Which of those options are made available to members is 
a decision that you, as the group creator, get to make.
 
Before you can create a group, the Network Creator must have set up the net-
work to allow members to create groups. Also, the Network Creator has the 
option to approve groups before they’re displayed to other members.
If the network is set up to allow you to create groups, you can find an Add 
a Group link at the top right of the Groups page. When you click that link, 
you’re taken to the Add a Group page (shown in Figure 6-14), which requires 
that you enter the group information, choose among the features it will offer, 

107
 Chapter 6: Interacting with Others on the Network
decide on the privacy level, and determine whether you’ll allow members to 
message one another. The following list describes the different elements:
 
✓ Group Information: First, you get to enter the details that describe the 
group:
 
• Name: You need to give the group a name. Try to make the name 
distinctive enough to differentiate your group from the myriad 
other groups it will coexist with.
 
• Image: You have to add an image to go along with any new group. 
This is a good thing: Visuals help people make a connection more 
easily, so try to find an image you can use that relates to the topic 
of the group.
 
• Description: This is an optional field but one that is important to 
take advantage of, even if you write only a single sentence. This 
description accompanies the group’s basic details in the listing 
shown in the main Groups page, so you can elaborate a bit more 
beyond the group name here.
 
• Group Address: This field is required, and it constitutes the only 
part of the URL of the group page that you have control over. For 
example, if you choose as group address the word fantasticgroup, 
and your network on Ning is http://yournetwork.ning.com, 
the URL for the group page will be http://yournetwork.ning.
com/group/fantasticgroup. As you type the group name, this 
field will become automatically populated, but you can change the 
address as you see fit while you’re setting up the group.
 
Figure 6-14: 
Setting up 
your group’s 
information.
 

108
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
 
• Website: This is an optional field that gives you the opportunity to 
include a link to another site, in case the group has another Web site.
 
• Location: This is an optional field that allows you to localize the 
group if your group is based in some local area.
 
✓ Features: After the information is complete, you choose the features you 
want to add to the group:
 
• Comments: This feature adds a Comment Wall to the group.
 
• Discussion Forum: This feature adds a discussion forum to the 
group.
 
• Text Box: Adding this feature lets you include a text box below the 
group information, allowing you to include more details, images, 
videos, and so on.
 
• RSS Reader: Adding this feature gives you the opportunity to 
include an outside RSS feed that will give group members another 
reason to come back to it, such as getting the latest news about 
the topic dealt with in the group by adding an RSS feed of news 
about the topic to the group.
 
✓ Privacy: You have two options to choose between, which you cannot 
change after the group has been created,
 
• Anyone: Selecting this option gives anybody in the network the 
ability to join the group at will.
 
• Moderated Membership: Selecting this option makes the group 
membership a moderated process, giving you more control over 
who joins.
 
✓ Messages: This option allows your members to send messages to the 
entire group, which gives the group parts of the functionality of a 
mailing list.
After you add the group information and choose the features and settings, 
click Add Group to go to the next step, which involves inviting other mem-
bers to join the group. This is an optional step. (The page you’ll see at this 
point is similar to the invitation page for events shown in Figure 6-8, earlier in 
this chapter.) If you prefer, you can choose to invite members later by click-
ing the Skip link.
 
Two elements of the group creation process cannot be changed after the 
group has been created: the group address and the privacy setting. Make sure 
to choose these two wisely, because the only way to change them after you 
set up the group is to delete the group altogether and create a new one.
Managing a group
After you’ve set up your new group, you can make small adjustments to the 
main page. To edit the details of each feature in the group, click the Edit 

109
 Chapter 6: Interacting with Others on the Network
button at the top right of each of them. When you click Edit, you see options 
for modifying the feature. Figure 6-15 shows the discussion forum selected 
for editing. When you’re done applying any changes, click the Save button. 
The following list describes the group features that you can edit:
 
Figure 6-15: 
You can edit 
how things 
appear on 
your group 
page.
 
 
✓ Text Box: The Text Box on your newly created group page works like 
the Text Box on your profile page. It gives you a space to add formatted 
text, links, images, and files.
 
✓ Discussion Forum: When you click the Edit button, you’re able to modify 
the following options:
 
• Display: You can choose between Detailed View and Titles Only. 
Detailed View shows the titles of the discussions along with a 
few lines of the post that opened the discussion. The Titles Only 
option, as you would guess from the name, displays only the titles 
of the discussion topics.
 
• From: This option determines which kinds of discussions are dis-
played. You can choose Latest Activity (includes new discussions 
along with new replies), Newest Discussions (includes only new 
discussions), Most Replies (shows the discussions with the most 
replies), Featured (as the creator or administrator of a group, you 
can choose to feature discussions in the group — more on this 
later), or Group Admin Discussions (discussions that the group 
creator or admins of the group have started).
 
• Show: This option lets you choose how many discussions topics 
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, or 20) are shown under the Discussion Forum 
header.
 
✓ Add RSS: To add an RSS feed to your group, you need to click the Edit 
button next to the Add RSS link. This action opens a panel inside which 
you can enter the following items:
 
• Title: This will be the title displayed at the top of this box.
 
• URL: This is the address for the RSS feed that you want included in 
the page.

110
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
 
• Display: Like the Discussion Forum option explained earlier, this 
option lets you choose between Detailed View and Titles Only.
 
• Show: This option lets you choose how many items from the RSS 
feed are shown on the group page.
Managing discussions in a group
When you create a group or if you’re a group administrator, you have admin-
istrative options you can use to control things in your group. Every discus-
sion topic in your group shows the following options (see Figure 6-16), shown 
below the Admin Options header in the top right:
 
✓ Feature: Clicking this link features the discussion. If you choose to dis-
play featured group discussions on the group page, this option makes 
this discussion topic show up on the group page. Also, featuring the dis-
cussion displays the topic below the Featured Discussions header when 
you click the View All link at the bottom of the Discussion Forum section 
on the main group page.
 
 Edit Discussion: Clicking the Edit Discussion link takes you to a page 
where you can edit the discussion title, the post, the tags, and any 
attached files. After you’re done making any edits, you can save them by 
clicking the Save button.
 
✓ Close Discussion: Occasionally you may find it necessary to close a 
discussion, either because it has derailed from its original purpose or 
because it’s no longer timely. Clicking Close Discussion lets you put a 
stop to replies on the discussion topic.
 
✓ Add Tags: Clicking this link lets you add tags to the discussion topic to 
make it easier to find it through a search later on.
 
✓ Delete Discussion: If you need to remove a discussion topic from the 
group’s discussion forum, this is the way to do it. There is no way to undo 
this action, so double-check before deleting any discussions in a group.
 
Figure 6-16: 
Managing 
discussions 
in a group.
 

111
 Chapter 6: Interacting with Others on the Network
Managing group members
Just like a network on Ning, groups in a network can grow to a decent size. If 
that is the case, and you find yourself needing help from others, you can pro-
mote other members to group administrators. To do this, click the Manage 
Group Members link under the Admin Options heading on your group’s main 
page.
When you land on the group Members page (see Figure 6-17), you can choose 
among the members by selecting the check boxes next to their names. After 
you’ve selected the members you want to promote to group administrators, 
click the Promote to Administrator button at the top left. (Note that you can 
also demote someone from group administrator.) Promoted members can 
help you with group administrative matters.
Group administrators cannot do a few things: delete the group, ban the group 
creator from the group, and promote or demote other members to group 
administrators.
 
Note that group administrators are different from network Administrators, 
whose role is explained in detail in Chapter 13.
Another thing you may find yourself needing to do once in a blue moon is ban 
people from your group. To ban a member from your group, click the check 
box next to the member’s name and click the Ban from Group button at the 
top center. If the reason for the ban changes, you can unban a previously 
banned member.
 
Make sure to read Chapter 17 to find out how to work with group administra-
tors and deal with banned members. Though the chapter deals with network 
Administrators and members of the network at large, some of the concepts 
can also be applied in a group.

demote, 
ban, and

Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
Chatting with Members
Chatting is what people do, isn’t it? It’s what you do when you’re on a long and 
boring plane trip, and it’s what you do when you run into someone who seems 
to have some interesting story to tell. You chat. Nowadays chat seems to also 
be equated with exchanging instant messages with other people using AIM, 
MSN, Google Talk, or Yahoo! Messenger. But in the context of a network on 
Ning, chat is another element that lets you interact with multiple members.
The most unique thing about chat is that all participants in a chat session 
need to be “there” (in the chat page) at the same time for the interaction to 
take place. “Duh! I knew that,” you may argue, but this actually makes chat 
an activity that’s completely different from all the other activities I talk about 
in this chapter. None of the other activities requires participants to be in the 
same place at the same time.
Now that this little bit of philosophical debate is out of the way, you can get 
down to discovering chat in a network on Ning. Chatting on Ning is incredibly 
easy through the Chat bar at the bottom of every page on the network, as 
shown in Figure 6-18. You basically click either one of the arrows on the Chat 
bar to open up the Chat window.
 
Figure 6-18: 
The Chat 
bar appears 
at the 
bottom of all 
pages in the 
network.
 
Chatting with multiple members
The Chat window shows you how simple chatting with other members can 
be. A typical Chat window is shown in Figure 6-19. (Before the chat session 
starts, the Chat window is a blank slate.) To the left, below the Main tab, you 
can see the messages posted by each member, and each message is pre-
ceded by a member icon and a time stamp.
Before you can chat with others, you need to make sure your status is set to 
Online through the little buddy-shaped icon next to the green or red circle 
in the bottom right of the Chat bar or (if the Chat window is open) at the top 
right of the Chat window. When you’re online, the light is green, and the Chat 
bar shows you how many other members are online. When you’re offline, the 

113
 Chapter 6: Interacting with Others on the Network
light is red, and on the Chat bar, instead of the number of members online, 
you see the message (Disconnected).
 
Figure 6-19: 
Chatting on 
Ning really 
can’t get 
any easier.
 
When you’re online, when you open the Chat window, you appear on the 
right, in the list of members currently participating in the chat session. Other 
features of the Chat window include
 
✓ A search box: This allows you to search for a specific member in case 
the list of members chatting is long.
 
✓ The text box: At the bottom, on the left side of the window, is the text 
box that you use to type your own messages as part of the chat. Above 
the text box is a handy panel with two buttons:
 
• The smiley button: Click the first button to show a number of smi-
leys you can include in your message. Clicking a smiley inserts 
the right code in the message box to give your posts a little bit of 
flavor. J
 
• The speaker-shaped button: The second button enables you to un-
mute and mute the chat. If it is un-muted, whenever someone posts 
a comment in the chat window, you hear a subtle yet audible beep 
alerting you to the fact that someone replied.
 
✓ Hide: At the top right of the Chat window, to the left of the buddy-shaped 
icon, you can click the downward arrow to hide the Chat window. Hiding 
the window doesn’t take you offline: It simply hides it from view so you 
can go about browsing the rest of the network conveniently.

114
Part II: Using an Existing Network on Ning 
 
✓ Detach: To the left of the downward arrow is a diagonal arrow pointing 
to the top left (also available on the Chat bar, when the Chat window is 
hidden). If you click this icon, the Chat window becomes detached in a 
new browser window.
 
If you click the diagonal arrow and the Chat doesn’t appear in its own window, 
most likely your browser is blocking pop-ups. Simply disable pop-up blocking 
for your network if you want to chat in the convenience of your own pop-up 
window.
Chatting with another member
Occasionally, you may want to chat privately with another member, as you 
can see in Figure 6-20. To do this, click the member icon in the chat window 
or on the listing of online members. You’re presented with a window showing 
you these options:
 
✓ Private Chat: Clicking this link opens a new tab next to the Main tab, 
where you can chat with the other member privately.
 
✓ View Profile: Clicking this option opens a new window where the 
member’s profile page will be loaded.
 
Figure 6-20: 
Chatting 
with another 
member is 
also very 
easy.

Network

In this part . . .
I
f you think being a member of a network on Ning can 
be a great experience, wait until you set up your own 
network. There are so many options for you to play with 
that you can truly make your social network on Ning 
unique:
 
 You can choose how your network looks.
 
 You can select which features to add to it.
 
 You can polish it with Ning’s premium services.
This part gives you the tools to go out there and get your 
own network started. You also find out how to manage the 
members in your network and how they interact and com-
municate with each other.

▶ Signing in and getting started
▶ Selecting features for your network
▶ Choosing a theme
▶ Defining profile questions
Y
ou are not alone. I really, really mean it: You are not alone in thinking 
about setting up a network on Ning. By the time you read this, there will 
be well over a million networks powered by Ning. Don’t be intimidated by 
that big number. This chapter deals with the steps leading up to the setup 
of a network on Ning, from preparing for it (including learning from other 
networks), through the creation process, to the point when you click the 
Launch! link and show your master creation to the world. Hang on tight!
Planning before You Start
I know, I know . . . planning is the boring part, but give me a few paragraphs 
of your time to share with you a few ideas that may come in handy.
Knowing your competitors
It’s easy to set up a network on Ning, so there’s a good chance you will find a 
good number of networks focused on the exact same topic you chose. (Yep, 
that brilliant idea that woke you up in the middle of the night.)
How do you find out who your competitors are? Go to Ning.com and enter a 
search term that matches your topic of interest in the Search Networks box 
at the top right of the page, as shown in Figure 7-1.

The Ning.
com home

starting 
point to 
search and

networks.
 
To give you an idea, when I launched TuDiabetes (a network for people 
touched by diabetes), there were more than 15 networks about diabetes on 
Ning. At the time I’m writing this, there are more than 15 pages of networks, 
and each page has 20 networks listed on it, so you do the math. Figure 7-2 
shows some of the current results when you type diabetes in the Search 
Networks box.

topic.
 

119
 Chapter 7: Setting Up a Network on Ning
What’s happened? On one end, Network Creators have started networks with 
narrower and narrower focus, zeroing in on subniches that were untouched 
just a few months ago. So, going back to the diabetes example, you now have 
networks about type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, teenage 
diabetics, parents with diabetes, parents of children with diabetes, and so on.
Also, there are unique niches coming up all the time: new networks centered on 
cities and neighborhoods; colleges, schools, and graduating classes; new artists 
and new political candidates; new technologies; and new games. Opportunities 
for Network Creators to start new networks are waiting around every corner.
Were you beaten to the punch? Why do I give you the “bad” news up front? 
Because you have an advantage! You have this book (which is awesome, I 
know), and even more important than that, having lots of other networks 
out there gives you the opportunity to look at what others have done, what 
has worked for them, and what hasn’t. When you use that knowledge to your 
advantage, your network will be as good as it can be. Here are some things 
that you can look at and learn from in other networks:
 
✓ Features to add: See what features each network makes use of. You may 
notice a pattern. For example, the Music Player may be a hit for the kind 
of network you have in mind, or it may be a true headache and a distrac-
tion from the main goal of the network.
 
✓ Public or private: Making your network public or private is a decision 
that you can always revert, but you can’t always revert the consequences 
of making the “wrong” choice.
 
✓ Questions to ask: Knowing what questions to ask new members is 
important. It helps you and other members learn more about the new 
members, how they found out about your network, how they relate to 
other members, and so on.
 
✓ Main page layout: See how the networks distribute the features on the 
main page. A good layout can help make the network great, just as a 
less-than-optimal layout will break it.
This list is not comprehensive, but it gives you an idea of what to pay atten-
tion to as you’re looking at other networks. The first three items in the 
preceding list are discussed in more detail in this chapter. I talk more about 
main page layout in Chapter 9.
 
Before moving on to create your own network, consider one last thing: If lots 
of other networks are doing the same thing you thought of doing, make sure 
you have a very compelling reason to start another one. I’m not saying you 
can’t, but it’s important for you to have a good way to differentiate yourself, 
a nice marketing budget, or both. Otherwise, you may find yourself running a 
pretty lonely network.

120
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
Seeing the big picture
Throughout the rest of this chapter, I lay out the process of creating your 
own network on Ning. Instead of providing one giant step list for you to 
follow, I’ve broken down the process into four smaller processes:
 
1. Sign in and describe your network.
 
2. Choose features for your network.
 
3. Choose a theme.
 
4. Define profile questions.
Step 1 is the only step you must complete entirely to officially have a network 
up and running. You can complete the other three steps all in one sitting, but 
you can also come back to them at a later time. It’s up to you.
Signing In and Getting Started
 
I recommend that you create a new e-mail address, sign up on Ning with it to 
create your new network, and use that e-mail account only for that purpose. 
The downside to this is that you won’t have all your networks on Ning (those 
you belong to and those you are the creator for) conveniently accessible 
through Ning Activity Feed.
If you choose to create a network using the same e-mail address you use as a 
member or as a Network Creator on other networks, and one day you want to 
transfer ownership to someone else, you can do so by following the instruc-
tions on this page: http://tinyurl.com/ningfordummiesnewowner.
To create your own network, go to Ning.com (just like you do when you’re 
searching for other networks) and then follow these steps:
 
1. Sign in to your Ning account by clicking the Sign In link at the top of 
the Ning.com home page.
 
 When you do so, you’re prompted to sign in with your Ning ID — the 
e-mail address and password you used when you signed up — as 
shown in Figure 7-3. (For details on how to set up an account, check out 
Chapter 1.)
 
 After you’re done signing in, there are only two steps that are absolutely 
required to set up your network on Ning: You must name your network 
and choose a Web address for it. Both of these steps are done on the 
Ning.com home page.

121
 Chapter 7: Setting Up a Network on Ning
 
Figure 7-3: 
You have 
to sign in 
before you 
can create 
a new 
network.
 
 
2. Fill in the Name Your Social Network text box.
 
 You can change this name later, so don’t worry too much if you misspell 
it or change your mind about it.
 
3. Enter a Web address in the Pick a Web Address text box.
 
 The characters you enter are appended in front of .ning.com and turn 
into your network’s Web address. For example, if you enter networkfor-
dummies (without spaces), your network’s address becomes http://
networkfordummies.ning.com.
 
 The Web address must contain only letters, numbers, or dashes. It 
cannot contain spaces.
 
 Think before you pick a Web address. After you’ve created your net-
work, you CANNOT change it.
 
 To illustrate the rest of the steps involved in setting up a network, I’ve 
created a new network called Network For Dummies and entered net-
workfordummies as its Web address.
 
4. Click the Create button and wait for a few seconds.
 
 You’re taken to the Describe Your Social Network page, shown in 
Figure 7-4. At this point, your network is still not available to others. You 
need to launch it for others to be able to join it.
 
 The next thing for you to do is enter information about your network, 
which I describe in some detail in the coming steps.
 
5. Choose a network name.
 
 You have the opportunity to change the name you chose in Step 2 when 
you created the network. If you don’t want to touch it now, you can still 
change it later through the Manage section of your network.
 
6. Choose a privacy setting.
 
 You have two options you can choose between: Public – Anybody Can See 
or Join It; and Private – Only Invited People Can Join and See It. If you have 
limited time to set up your network, I recommend you set it up as private 

122
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
until you’re able to complete the setup process so that others can’t see it 
until your masterpiece is ready for the world. You can later change your 
network’s privacy through the Manage section on your network.
 
 After your network has been launched, you have more granular privacy 
controls available. To access the controls, click the Manage link in your 
network’s navigation and click the network Privacy option. This leads 
you to the page shown in Figure 7-5.
 
Figure 7-4: 
The 
Describe 
Your Social 
Network 
page.
 
 
Figure 7-5: 
This page 
lets you 
control your 
network’s 
privacy and 
language, 
among other 
things.
 

123
 Chapter 7: Setting Up a Network on Ning
 
 Within the Public section, you have the option to let visitors see every-
thing on the network or see just the main page. If you want to ensure 
that search engines are also able to find every bit of content on your net-
work, make sure the See Everything option is selected.
 
 Within the Private section, you have the option to let anyone become a 
member or only invited people. The former is useful if you want to make 
sure the content is not visible to people who are not members. The 
latter comes in handy if you want to have absolute control over who can 
join your network.
 
 If your network is going to be used within a private organization, a 
school, or a family, it may be a good idea to leave it as a private network. 
Otherwise, if you want the network to be found by search engines and 
crawled all the way to the last corner, make sure to set it up as public.
 
7. Enter a tagline, which is the text that will appear in the header of your 
network.
 
 For Network For Dummies, I entered the tagline “A network for the read-
ers of Ning For Dummies.”
 
8. Add a description of your network.
 
 The description is limited to 140 characters. The text you enter in this 
box will appear in a number of places. It will appear in the Description 
box, if you add this feature to your network’s main page. You’ll also see 
the description in the entry for your network when it comes up in the 
Search Results page on Ning.com.
 
 The description also appears in every Google search result where the 
main page of your network appears. In Figure 7-6, you can see an exam-
ple of this with TuDiabetes, where the description text is “For people 
with diabetes to connect with each other.”
 
9. In case your network’s name, tagline, and description don’t contain 
some keyword that you want to have associated with your network, 
enter some keyword terms, separated by commas.
 
 Including relevant keywords makes it easier for people to find your net-
work when they’re searching on Ning.com.
 
Figure 7-6: 
Google 
search 
results also 
show your 
network’s 
description.

Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
 
10. From the Language drop-down list, select a different language for the 
interface of your network, if the default English (U.S.) isn’t the best 
option for your members.
 
 From Polish to languages that I can’t even attempt to pronounce cor-
rectly, your network can be offered in more than 20 languages, and new 
ones are being added frequently.
 
11. At this point, you can launch your network or further tweak it.
 
 If you want to launch your network (which makes it available to others 
besides yourself), click the Launch! link, as shown in Figure 7-4, earlier in 
this chapter.
 
 If you want to tweak your network some more, you can do so by clicking 
the Next button on the Describe Your Social Network page. Clicking Next 
gives you the option to select what features to add or remove from your 
network and lets you customize the way your network looks.
 
 So I definitely encourage you to click the Next button!
 
 If you need to leave halfway through the network creation process, fear 
not. You can come back later and type in your network’s Web address. 
If you’re signed in to Ning, you’re brought back to the same point you 
were in the creation process. If you aren’t signed in, you’re taken to a 
page indicating that the social network is still being set up, giving you 
the option to sign in to pick up where you left off.
Selecting Features for Your Network
If you click the Next button on the Describe Your Social Network page (refer 
to Figure 7-4, earlier in this chapter), you’re taken to the Add Features to 
Your Network page, shown in Figure 7-7. This page lets you drag and drop 
all the features for your network’s main page into the places where you want 
them to appear.
The features available appear on the left side under the Features heading. 
You can drag them to the right, inside one of three boxes: the left one, the 
middle one, and the small one in the bottom right.
If you change your mind about the placement of a feature, you can drag it and 
drop it wherever you want it to go. Piece of cake! Do the same if you want to 
remove it: You can drag a feature and drop it into the box labeled Drag Here 
to Remove Feature.
You see only the most popular features listed when you first land on this 
page: Description, Activity, Members, Videos, Blog, Forum, Events, and 
Groups. If you want to see the entire list, click the View All Features link at 

125
 Chapter 7: Setting Up a Network on Ning
the bottom of the Features list. For starters, it isn’t a bad idea to limit your-
self to the most popular features: You can remove them or add to them later, 
as I discuss in Chapter 9.
Again, at this point you can click the Launch! link, or you can click the Next 
button (shown in Figure 7-7) to continue on and customize your network’s 
appearance.
 
Figure 7-7: 
On the Add 
Features 
to Your 
Network 
page, you 
can add 
features 
and move 
features 
around your 
network’s 
main page.
 
Choosing a Theme
One of the nicest things about running your network on Ning is that you don’t 
need to be a very accomplished designer to make it look like a million dollars! 
The folks at Ning have taken good care of that and offer you more than 50 
great-looking templates (they call them themes) that you can use with mini-
mal effort.
If you click the Next button on the Add Features to Your Network page, you’re 
taken to the Customize Appearance page, the last step before the launch of 
your network, as shown in Figure 7-8. From there, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose a theme.
 
 Doing this is as simple as scrolling using the scroll bar on the right (as 
shown in Figure 7-8) until you see a theme you like. Then simply click 
the theme.

126
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
 
Figure 7-8: 
The 
Customize 
Appearance 
page is the 
last step 
before you 
launch.
 
 
2. Scroll down the page and then tweak the theme to make it look the 
way you want it to.
 
 Under the heading Now, Make It Uniquely Yours, you can adjust the 
theme settings to a degree that will serve almost all your customization 
needs, as shown in Figure 7-9.
 
Figure 7-9: 
After you 
choose a 
theme, you 
can cus-
tomize its 
settings.
 

127
 Chapter 7: Setting Up a Network on Ning
 
 I delve into great detail about how you can change your network’s 
appearance in Chapter 8, so if you can live with the default settings of 
the theme you chose until then, I promise the wait will be well worth it.
 
3. When you’re done choosing a theme and customizing your network’s 
appearance, click the Launch! button.
Once you click on the Launch! button, you’re taken to your network’s main 
page. At this point, you can sit back and contemplate your network: It’s 
finally up and running!
Defining Profile Questions
Now that your network has been launched, one of the first things to do is to 
define the questions for your members to answer during their sign-up pro-
cess. Thinking of the questions will probably take longer than adding them to 
the network.
When you’ve thought up your questions, follow these steps to define your 
profile questions:
 
1. Click the Manage link in your network’s navigation.
 
 This step takes you to the Manage page of your network, a page that 
you’ll visit any time you need to make administrative changes to the net-
work. You can see how this page looks in Figure 7-10.
 
Figure 7-10: 
The Manage 
page lets 
you make 
most of 
the admin 
changes to 
the network.
 

128
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
 
2. Click the Profile Questions icon in the Your Members section.
 
 You’re taken to the Profile Questions page, shown in Figure 7-11.
 
 By default, the Profile Questions page includes gender and location 
questions, as shown in Figure 7-11. You can leave these as they appear 
or remove them by clicking the Remove link.
 
 You can add other questions for your members to answer by clicking 
the Add Another Question link, as explained in Step 6 of this step list. 
For each question (new or existing), you need to complete the following 
fields:
 
• Question Title: The text you enter in this box is presented to the 
member during the sign-up process and will also be presented as 
the heading above the respective answer in the member’s Profile 
Information section on the profile page, as shown in Figure 7-12. 
The gender and location questions prepopulated by Ning can’t 
have their titles changed.
 
• Answer Type: This drop-down list gives you several options: One 
Line Answer (ideal for asking things like “Profession” and “How did 
you find out about us?”), Longer Answer (suited for questions that 
require more space to answer), Multiple Choice (whether you want 
members to be able to choose only one or more than one of many 
options), Date (to ask for birthdays and other dates), and Website 
Address (to ask for URLs of Web sites).
 
 If you pick Multiple Choice as the Answer Type, the space below 
the drop-down list expands to make room for a new text box titled 
Choices, as shown in Figure 7-13. If you pick Multiple Choice, check 
out Steps 3 and 4, but if not, you’ll skip those steps.
 
• Required: Selecting the Required check box makes the question 
mandatory for members. This means a member trying to sign up 
won’t be able to complete the registration process without answer-
ing the question.
 
• Private: Selecting the Private check box makes the answer to the 
question visible only to the member, the Network Creator, and the 
Administrators on the member’s profile page.
 
• Add to Advanced Search: Selecting the Add to Advanced Search 
check box makes the profile question available among the search 
criteria in the Advanced Search page for Members.

3. (Optional) Enter all the choices you want to make available to your 
members, separating choices with a comma.
 
 For instance, if the two options you want to offer are “Slime and Snails” 
and “Sugar and Spice,” enter Slime and Snails, Sugar and Spice.
 
4. (Optional) If you want to allow your members to pick more than one 
choice, select the Can Pick More Than One check box.
 
5. (Optional) Reorder questions by clicking any question and dragging it 
where you need it to appear.
 
6. (Optional) Add or remove questions.
 
 You can add another question anywhere by clicking the Add Another 
Question link above the position where you want the new question to 
appear. You can also delete any questions by clicking the Remove link 
for the question.
 
 Any changes you make to profile questions, such as changing a ques-
tion itself or removing a question you previously had, have a retroactive 
effect applying to all members who have signed up to the network up 
to that point. If you want to preserve their member data, make sure to 
export it, as explained in Chapter 10.
 
7. When you’re set with all your profile questions, click the Save button 
at the bottom of the page.
 
 You see a Success! message confirming that your changes have been 
successfully saved.

Chapter 8
Changing Your Network’s 
Appearance
In This Chapter
▶ Modifying fonts
▶ Modifying the header, footer, and sides
▶ Modifying body and content areas
▶ Managing tabs
I
n Chapter 7, you discover how to set up your network on Ning, and I 
touch on choosing your theme — the name Ning gives to your network’s 
look and feel. I also mention that I would tell you more about how to modify 
your theme to match the network you dreamed of — well, as close to that as 
possible.
In this chapter, I show you how to change the colors, fonts, and backgrounds 
of your network. I also show you how you can give your network a sexy look 
with the inclusion of a logo. Last, I cover your network’s navigation, how you 
can reorder its tabs, and add new ones if you need to.
To illustrate the changes you can make to your network’s theme and naviga-
tion, I try to make the network resemble the cover of a For Dummies book. The 
closest theme I found among the 50+ Ning offers was Dark Slate. If you could 
see this theme in glorious color, you would notice that the original colors in 
the theme do not quite match the gorgeous yellow-and-black beelike theme 
featured on the covers of all For Dummies books. But fear not, readers: When 
you finish this chapter, your network will sport a For Dummies-worthy theme. 
Well, my network will; I imagine you’ll want yours to look a bit different.
Modifying the Fonts in Your Network
To modify your published network’s appearance, click the Manage link in the 
navigation and choose the Appearance option in the Your Network section. 

132
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
Doing so opens the Appearance page, as shown in Figure 8-1. This page looks 
like one you see during the creation of your network, but it has the theme 
you chose for your network applied to it.
 
Figure 8-1: 
The 
Appearance 
page in your 
network 
lets you 
edit your 
network’s 
theme.
 
The focus of this chapter is on the Theme Settings tab below the Now, Make 
It Uniquely Yours heading. Most of the changes you make to the theme set-
tings are reflected in the small preview shown at the bottom of Figure 8-1, in 
the box where the words Network Name appear. However, image changes are 
not visible through the preview and require you to click the Save button at 
the bottom of the page.
 
Set up a private secondary network where you can play with changes to the 
theme and any other large-scale modifications. This way, you can make sure 
everything looks well on the secondary network before you apply the changes 
to your main network for all members to see. Check out Chapter 7 if you need 
a refresher on how to set up a network.
The first settings you see on the page affect the fonts in the network:
 
✓ Heading Font: You can choose from a drop-down list of standard Web-
safe fonts. The font family you choose is applied to the heading of the 
network — that is, the name of your network. Next to the drop-down list 
are a few letters (AaBbCc) meant to help you preview your font changes 
before you save them.

133
 Chapter 8: Changing Your Network’s Appearance
 
✓ Body Text: You have the same font choices for the body text in the net-
work. You can also preview the font change next to the drop-down list.
 
✓ Font Size: You can choose Small, Default, and Large from the drop-down 
list. The font size you select affects all the text in the network. Sticking 
with the default option works in most cases.
Modifying the Header, Footer, and Sides
Below the Fonts section, the Header, Footer & Sides section gives you a wide 
range of options to tweak, as shown in Figure 8-2. (The title “Header, Footer 
& Sides” was cut off the top of Figure 8-2, but you can see it at the bottom of 
Figure 8-1, earlier in this chapter.)
 
Figure 8-2: 
The bot-
tom of the 
Appearance 
page gives 
you more 
customiza-
tion options.
 
This list describes the options shown in the upper portion of Figure 8-2:
 
✓ Network Name: This option lets you choose the color for your network 
name. When you click the colored button next to the rectangle, a small 
box appears (see Figure 8-3) where you can pick among a number of 
common colors or choose a specific color by entering its hexadecimal 
code (also called a hex code). After you choose the color your network 
name will appear in, click the OK link.

134
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
 
 A good Web site for referencing color hexadecimal codes is www.web
monkey.com/reference/Color_Charts.
 
✓ Header Background: This option allows you to change the background 
for your network’s header — the area that contains the network’s name, 
tagline, and navigation. You can modify the background color and/or 
add a background image.
 
• Background color: To modify the background color, click the colored 
button next to the first rectangle, make a color selection within the 
box that appears (refer to Figure 8-3), and then click the OK link.
 
• Background image: To add a background image, click the little 
picture button next to NONE. Doing so opens a box that lets you 
upload a photo from your computer (see Figure 8-4). Browse for 
the image on your hard drive, select it, and then click the Done 
button. If you want to remove an image, select the No Image option 
and then click Done.
 
 To better understand how the header background image works, think 
of it as a rectangular hole cut into the page, with your network name 
left in place, floating on top of the image. If the image you use is at least 
955 pixels wide (the width of the header background area), that many 
pixels of the image will show through the hole. If the image you upload is 
less than 955 pixels wide, you have the following options (illustrated in 
Figure 8-5):
 
• Don’t Repeat Image: This option aligns the image you upload against 
the top-left corner of the header background area. The remaining 
area, from the edges of the image to the edges of the header back-
ground area, is filled with the background color you choose.
 
• Tile Image: This option tiles the image, filling the entire space in 
the header background area.
 
• Repeat Vertically: This option repeats the image vertically to the 
bottom edge of the header background area.
 
• Repeat Horizontally: This option repeats the image horizontally to 
the right edge of the header background area.
 
✓ Add a Logo: Hands down, adding a logo one of the coolest things you 
can do to give your network an identity. In essence, this option lets you 
upload an image that replaces the network name. Therefore, adding a 
logo lets your network header sport the same professional look as, say, 
your corporate Web site or the logo your graphic designer created for 
your business.
 
 To add a logo, click the little picture button next to NONE. Follow the 
same steps I gave you to upload a header background image.
 
 Your logo image needs to be 955 pixels wide to make sure that the entire 
image displays and no part of the header background color or network 
name shows.

135
 Chapter 8: Changing Your Network’s Appearance
 
✓ Top Bar & Footer: This option lets you change the color for the top bar 
and the footer of your network. The top bar gives you convenient access 
to your Members page, your inbox, and your Friends list. The footer dis-
plays the copyright notice for the network and other fun things, such as 
links to the Help page, the Privacy Policy, and the Ning Terms of Service.
 
• Color drop-down list: To change the color, click the colored button 
next to the rectangle and follow the earlier instructions to change 
the color for the network name and header background. The color 
you choose for the top bar is applied to the network footer.
 
• Show Ning Logo? check box: If you want to hide the Ning logo from 
the top bar, leave the check box unselected.
 
✓ Sides: This option works exactly like the Header Background option, 
except that it applies to the two vertical (empty) columns on the sides 
of the network. You can either choose a solid color for them or upload 
an image to display in the background.
 
The background images you upload to the sides of the network don’t need to 
be photos. For a cool use of the Sides option, create a 1-pixel-wide image that is 
as high as you want to make it. Using image editing software, apply a gradient 
effect to this thin strip. When you upload the image as the background for the 
sides, choose the Tile Horizontally option from the drop-down list. The result 
is two neat sides that have a gradient effect as you scroll down your network.

To pick a 
color, use 
the box that 
looks like 
this one.

Modifying the Body & Content Area
Last but not least among the Theme Settings on the Appearance page is the 
Body & Content Area section. (Refer to the options visible in the lower por-
tion of Figure 8-2, earlier in this chapter.) This is where you fine-tune and 
tweak the last remaining details of your network’s appearance. The first 
four options in the following list operate the same way as the Network Name 
option in the preceding section:
 
✓ Text Color: As you can imagine from the name, this option lets you 
change the color of the text in the body of your network. Changing this 
color has a very visible effect throughout your network because most of 
the content on your network shows in the color you select here.

137
 Chapter 8: Changing Your Network’s Appearance
 
 If you need to change the text color, link color, or subheader color, pay 
close attention to the contrast between the text and the background 
against which it will be sitting. Doing this is critical to ensure that the 
written content in your network is easy to read.
 
 Also, depending on the audience your network serves, consider avoid-
ing certain colors altogether. For example, in a network for people with 
Daltonism (red-green colorblindness), you should have neither green 
nor red as your text or link color.
 
✓ Link Color: This option lets you change the color of the links in your 
network in all places but two: the network navigation and the footer. The 
network navigation takes its color from the Network Name color. The 
color of the links in the network footer cannot be edited on this page. 
Their color is automatically picked to ensure that they contrast with the 
color you choose for the top bar and footer.
 
✓ Subheader Color: This option lets you change the color of a number of 
elements on the network. Among these are the titles of pages, headers 
of sections within a page, profile information on profile pages, and a few 
other items. I encourage you to be bold and try a color that stands out 
so you can easily spot all the places in your network that are affected by 
changing this color.
 
✓ Subheader Background: This option lets you change the background in 
such places as the headers above the list of forum topics and blog posts 
on the main page.
 
✓ Body Background: This option works much like the Header Background 
and Sides options explained earlier in this chapter, letting you change 
the background color for the body of the network. Now that you’ve met 
the other elements, you can easily spot the body of the network: It’s the 
middle space below the header, between the sides, and above the footer.
You can also add an image to serve as the background of the body of your 
network. The image can be tiled, repeated vertically or horizontally, or 
simply sit not tiled or repeated behind your network’s body of content.
If all this talk about different areas, colors, and backgrounds in your network 
seems hard to follow, don’t kill yourself over it. It may not seem easy, but 
once you play with the different settings, you’ll see it isn’t hard.
 
If you aren’t a savvy designer but still want to tweak your network’s color set-
tings, you can use online tools to find great-looking color palettes. One of 
these tools is Kuler (http://kuler.adobe.com), a Web site where design-
ers submit and vote on fabulous color palettes to help inspire you.
 
If the options covered so far still do not let you accomplish that last little bit 
you are seeking to accomplish in terms of how things look, there’s a chance 
you need to add your own CSS code. If you are up to the task, jump to Chapter 

138
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
19, where I go over some of the most important elements of CSS that you need 
to wrap your head around in your network on Ning.
Managing Your Tabs
Most of the time, the order in which the tabs appear in the navigation bar 
works just fine (the thinking heads at Ning have tried to make sure the 
default order fits most needs). But in case you want to shift the order of the 
links in your network’s navigation bar, here is how to do it:
 
1. Click the Manage link on the navigation.
 
2. Click the Tab Manager option below the Your Network heading.
 
 This takes you to the Tab Manager page, shown in Figure 8-6.
 
3. Click the tab you want to move in the list on the left side of the page, 
drag it to the new location, and drop it.
 
Figure 8-6: 
The Tab 
Manager 
page lets 
you rename, 
reorder, 
and add 
tabs to your 
network’s 
navigation.
 
Click to add a new tab.
Click to delete a tab.

139
 Chapter 8: Changing Your Network’s Appearance
If you want to remove a tab from the list, simply click the X to the right of the 
tab (refer to Figure 8-6). You cannot remove the Main, Invite, My Page, and 
Manage tabs. Every other tab can be removed from the navigation.
On the Tab Manager page, you can also add a new tab to link to an existing or 
a new page on the network. Here’s how:
 
1. Click the Add New Tab link at the top left of the Tab Manager page.
 
 This adds a new tab (coincidentally labeled New Tab) right above the 
Manage tab.
 
 To keep things sane in your navigation, Ning limits the number of top-
level tabs you can add to 14. This should be plenty, but it’s good to bear 
in mind, just in case.
 
2. Fill in information for your new tab, on the right side of the page:
 
• Tab Name: You probably want your tab to be called something 
other than New Tab. Because your network’s tabs cannot exceed 
12 characters, you have to be creative with the names of any new 
tabs.
 
• Make This a Sub-Tab: You can make the tab appear only when 
members position their mouse over an existing tab to create the 
effect of a menu opening beneath it. To do this, check the box next 
to Make This a Sub-tab. The new tab is indented to the right in the 
list of tabs.
 
• Target Page: Each tab needs a page to connect to. If this is an exist-
ing page, select the Use Existing URL option and paste the URL 
into the field next to it. If you want to connect the tab to a new 
page, select the Create a New Page option and read Chapter 23 for 
details on what to do next to finish adding a new page. Regardless 
of the option you choose, you can open the tab in a new window 
by checking the box next to Opens in a New Window.
 
• Make Tab Visible To: This drop-down list lets you choose whether 
you want the tab visible to Everyone (members and other visitors 
to your network), Members, or Administrators only.
 
3. (Optional) Adjust the colors of the subtab menu.
 
 Under the Sub-Tab Menu Colors heading on the Tab Manager page, 
you can change Text Color (the color of the link), Text Color on Hover 
(the color the link appears in when someone hovers his mouse on it), 

140
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
Background Color (the color behind the link), and Background Color on 
Hover (the color behind the link when someone hovers her mouse on it).
 
 These options function exactly the same way as the options to change 
colors on the Appearance page discussed in the previous section.
 
4. Click the Save Tab Settings button, and you’re done!
 
 If you mess something up, fear not. You have two options for starting over:
 
• Click the Cancel button, and you’re taken to the Manage page. From 
here, you can begin again or leave the settings alone.
 
• Click the Reset to Defaults button. Any tab information you may 
have entered reverts to how it was before you made any changes.
 
 In Figure 8-7, you can see the result after I added a link to the Dummies.
com Web site next to the Manage tab of my network’s navigation.
 
Figure 8-7: 
Adding a 
new tab 
with the Tab 
Manager is 
a breeze!
 
 
When you click a tab, the Tab Information section for that tab becomes edit-
able. You can edit the name of any tab whatsoever, and you can edit all the 
information about the tabs — except the Main, Invite, My Page, and Manager 
tabs.
This is handy if you want to rename the tabs in terms more familiar to 
your members. In Figure 8-7, you can see that I renamed the Members tab 
Dummies and the Photos tab Pics. This is reflected both on the list of tabs in

F
irst impressions count! If you don’t believe me, why do you think you 
sometimes find trays with fresh cookies at open houses showing homes 
for sale or rent? The folks showing the home want to make a good first 
impression on you.
The same applies to your network. Too bad you can’t offer trays with cookies 
for your visitors, but you can make sure their first impression is a pleasant 
one. Hopefully, they’ll be so happy with what they see that they’ll join your 
network, keep coming back, and tell others about it.
In this chapter, I start to deal with what you can control to make the experi-
ence for your members visually appealing, useful, and satisfying when they 
visit the main page of your network.
Adding and Removing Features
When you created your network, you chose some features to add. Since then, 
you may have played with the network and decided you should add a few 
more features — or remove some that don’t belong in your network.

142
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
You add or remove features on the Add Features to Your Network page. To 
get there, click the Manage link in your navigation and then click the Features 
option under Your Network. As shown in Figure 9-1, this page looks like the one 
you step through during the creation of your network to add features to it.
 
Figure 9-1: 
This page 
lets you add, 
move, and 
remove 
features 
from your 
main page.
 
I discuss how to add features in Chapter 7. If you need to add more features 
to your network, you just drag them from the list on the left side of the page 
to your desired location on the right side of the page where the layout of the 
main page is shown.
If you need to remove a feature you’ve added, simply drag it from the layout 
to the gray box labeled Drag Here to Remove Feature.
Changing Your Main Page’s Layout
You know how to add features: check! You know how to remove features: 
check! As you might expect, you can also move features around the main 
page. You also do this through the Add Features to Your Network page by 
dragging the feature and dropping it where you want it to appear on the main 
page — it’s that easy.

143
 Chapter 9: Tweaking Your Network’s Main Page
You have a lot of freedom to move things around, but there are a couple of 
restrictions:
 
✓ Username: You cannot move the Username box anywhere or remove 
it under any circumstance. This box, safely stationed in the top-right 
corner of the main page, shows your name and gives you convenient 
access to your inbox and friends, among other things.
 
✓ Ads: You can move the Ads feature only if you purchase the Ning pre-
mium service that lets you run your own ads. I talk about premium 
services in Chapter 18. Even if you are paying for this, you can move the 
Ads feature only within the right column or the left column, but not into 
the middle column.
 
✓ Created By: You can move or remove the Created By feature only if 
you purchase the Remove Ning Promotion links premium service, as 
explained in Chapter 18.
 
If you’re paying for the Control the Ads premium service and need to add an 
ad to your network’s middle column, you can do so with a Text Box. I cover 
the use of Text Boxes in the final section of this chapter.
Remember the movie in which the aquarium fishes escape and find their way 
back into the ocean, only to find out they’re floating on the sea inside plastic 
bags? One of them pops the question “Now what?” I’m going to take a wild 
guess that you may feel that way at this point.
When you start moving features around your main page’s layout, you start to 
get an even better grasp of how much control you have over your network. 
The possibilities are truly endless, but that doesn’t mean all possible layouts 
will serve your members well.
Depending on their focus, different networks can benefit from the features 
available in different ways. For example, some networks cannot exist without 
the Music Player, whereas others may rely more heavily on the Videos or the 
Photos features.
How you arrange features on the main page of your network directly affects 
the way in which your members participate, how compelled they may feel to 
go past the main page during their visits, and how much a visiting nonmember 
will want to join the network.

144
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
Therefore, always try to stand in the shoes of your current and potential 
members. Consider their interests and needs. Take into account the kind 
of access they have. You may find it hard to believe, but some people still 
depend on their phone to surf the Web. To help you a little bit, the following 
considerations should come in handy:
 
✓ Show members prominently. Members are the lifeblood of a network. 
This is so true that the Members feature is one of the few features your 
network automatically includes in its layout. (The other two are the net-
work description and the Latest Activity feature.) Displaying members 
on your main page prominently gives people visiting your network a feel 
for the members in your network and even hint at the overall type of 
network you run: family-oriented, animal lover-centric, and so on. Most 
of my favorite networks include the Members feature near the top of the 
main page.
 
 A very simple but powerful feature to add somewhere near Members is 
Birthdays, which shows your member’s upcoming birthdays.
 
✓ People love to chat. Chat became available to networks on Ning by mid-
2008. Since then, it’s become extremely popular. The Ning chat feature 
lets people do just that in real time. Also, because the chat shows all 
members who are participating on it as being online, it can come in handy 
as a means of finding out who is “around” when you visit the network.
 
 If you prefer to have a bit more control of all things chat, you can deter-
mine when to hold live chat sessions, which you announce to members. 
When the session is about to start, you can enable the chat (that is, 
make it visible to the rest of the members) by checking the box next to 
Chat in the Add Features to Your Network page, as shown in Figure 9-2, 
and clicking the Save button. When the chat session is over, you can dis-
able it by unchecking the same box.
 
 Because chat is a feature that involves real-time participation of mem-
bers, the only way to have total control over it is to monitor it all the 
time. If you cannot afford time to do this but need to make sure you keep 
an eye on all conversations in your network, you may be better off not 
adding the chat feature. Be warned, though: Your members will ask for it.
 
✓ Latest Activity pays off. Your network’s Latest Activity feature gives 
current and prospective members an idea of how active your network 
is. You should show this feature as close to the top of the main page as 
possible so it’s easy for visitors to the network to see that it is “happen-
ing.” If you’re concerned that your network is still too small and doesn’t 
show enough activity, move it down a bit for now, but don’t take it off 
the main page: The more members join and participate, the more useful 
the Latest Activity feature becomes.

145
 Chapter 9: Tweaking Your Network’s Main Page
 
✓ Show your pictures and videos. You may be surprised at how quickly 
your members start to share photos and videos on your network. They 
are two of the most used features in social networks on Ning. Knowing 
this (and how important it is for you to get in your members’ shoes), 
give prominence in your network to the Photos and Videos features.
 
✓ Discussion topics galore. Because of the ease of use (you don’t need 
a photo or video camera to contribute to it), the discussion forum is 
another incredibly popular feature. Make some room for it in the middle 
column because the forum is a feature almost all members will expect to 
find on your network; however, you may not need to station it too close 
to the top. Reserve those spots for Members or more visual features like 
Photos and Videos.
 
✓ Groups are your member’s networks. The Groups feature empowers 
members unlike any other feature on the Ning platform. Because your 
members are bound to come up with ideas you didn’t even dream of, 
groups that become popular are great candidates to feature on the main 
page as a means to attract new members into the network and give exist-
ing members more reasons to come back. Check out Chapter 16 on the 
use of Google Analytics to learn about popular groups on your network.
 
✓ Feature blog posts on the main page. When you see your members 
engage in writing blog posts, you may want to feature your members’ 
posts more prominently on your main page as a way to highlight content 
that is relevant to current and potential new members. Doing so can also 
be a means to give members recognition. Chapter 17 deals with ways to 
keep your members engaged and coming back to your network.
 
✓ If it’s appropriate, put the Music Player front and center. Networks 
that focus on artists and music or offer podcasts as a means of con-
necting with members are ideal candidates for this feature — make the 
Music Player prominent on the main page. If this is not your network’s 
focus, I don’t recommend adding it.

Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
Managing Features on the Main Page
Adding features to your network and deciding how to place them on the main 
page are the “What” and the “Where” elements of managing features on your 
network. This section discusses “How” to display your chosen features.
All features on the main page give you control of at least two things (some-
times more):
 
✓ How many items to show per feature
 
✓ How you want the items to display
To select how to display features on your main page, click the Edit button at 
the top right of the feature box you want to manage.
Next, I deal with the options available for each of the features discussed so far:
 
✓ Members: As shown in Figure 9-3, the Members feature box gives you 
three options:
 
• Display: This drop-down list lets you choose between Small 
Thumbnails (shown in Figure 9-3) and Large Thumbnails (shown in 
Figure 9-4).
 
• From: This drop-down list lets you choose among Newest, Most 
Popular, and Featured. The Newest option displays the most 
recent members in the network. The Most Popular option dis-
plays the members with the most recent activity on the network, 
whether comments left to them or contributions on their part. The 
Featured option allows you to display members that you’ve previ-
ously featured, as explained in Chapter 10.
 
• Show: This drop-down list lets you choose the number of rows of 
member thumbnails to display, ranging from 0 to 3 if the Members 
box is in the middle column or 0 to 5 rows if it is in the left or 
right column. This option gives you a level of control that is very 
useful when you try to tighten your main page’s layout: If you need 
to shorten the height of the page, you can reduce the number of 
rows, for instance.

 Chapter 9: Tweaking Your Network’s Main Page
 
Figure 9-3:

✓ Birthdays: The Birthdays feature box has only a single option for you to 
worry about. You can choose only how many birthdays to show: 1, 3, 5, 
10, or 20.
 
✓ Latest Activity: This feature box lets you choose how many and what 
kinds of events to display. The Show drop-down list lets you choose 
how many events to show: 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20. Below the drop-down list, 
clicking the Set What Activity Gets Displayed link takes you to the Latest 
Activity page, where you can choose what elements should appear in 
the Latest Activity box. (You can also get to this page by clicking the 
Manage link in the navigation and then clicking Latest Activity under the 
Spread the Word heading.)

148
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
 
 As shown in Figure 9-5, the Latest Activity page lets you set your display 
preferences and add a message to the Latest Activity stream.
 
• Display Preferences: Here, you can choose what displays in your 
network’s Latest Activity: New Content; New Profile Comments; 
New Blog, Discussion and Media Comments; New Friendships; New 
Members; New Events; Member Updates (changes to their profile 
pages); and Application Activity. Select the check box next to the 
type of activity you want Latest Activity to display.
 
• Add Message to Latest Activity: Here, you have two options: Add 
Facts about the Network and Or Write Your Own Message.
 
 Add Facts about the Network lets you pick among a number of 
preformatted messages detailing facts about the network, such as 
the number of members, the number of photos, the most popular 
forum post to date, and the number of events. These messages 
have the heading Did You Know on the Latest Activity box, as 
shown in Figure 9-6.
 
 Or Write Your Own Message lets you create your own personalized 
announcements up to 140 characters in length. These messages 
have the heading Announcement in the Latest Activity box, as 
shown in Figure 9-6.

 Chapter 9: Tweaking Your Network’s Main Page
 
✓ Photos: This feature box lets you choose how many photos to display; 
what kind of photos to display; and in some instances, from where to 
pull the photos to display. Click the Edit button to see your choices.
 
 The Display drop-down list lets you choose among these options:
 
• Slideshow: 100 photos are shown automatically, cycling from one 
to the next until the last one. The slideshow takes up the width of 
the column where the Photos feature box is located, as shown in 
Figure 9-7.
 
• Thumbnails: When you choose the Thumbnails option (see 
Figure 9-8), the Show drop-down list becomes visible, letting you 
choose the number of rows of photo thumbnails you want to dis-
play: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10. This option may be the most convenient for 
you to use if you want to make sure visitors with a slower Internet 
connection have a positive user experience because the slideshow 
significantly increases the load time of your network’s main page.
 
 The Slideshow and Thumbnails options on the Display drop-down 
list let you choose where the photos to display are pulled from. 
You can choose Recently Added, Most Popular, and Featured. But 
you can also choose among the photo albums you’ve created. This 
gives you a very fine level of control over the photos shown in the 
Photos feature box.
 
• Albums: You can select among Recently Added, Most Popular, and 
Featured albums via the From drop-down list. You also can choose 
how many rows of albums you want to display from the Show 
drop-down list: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10.

they can be

Figure 9-8: 
The 
Thumbnails 
option 
allows you 
to display up 
to 10 rows 
of photo 
thumbnails.
 
 
✓ Videos: The Videos feature box lets you choose the following:
 
• From: This drop-down list gives you the Featured, Recently Added, 
and Highest Rated options.
 
• Show: This drop-down list lets you choose to display 0 to 12 
videos.
 
 If the Videos feature box is in the left or right column, videos appear as 
thumbnails you can click, taking you to the video page, which does not 
have as much impact on page load times. However, videos in the middle 
column display in a video player, which translates into longer page-load 
times. Therefore, if you have your Videos feature in the middle column 
of your network, I recommend you limit the number of videos to display 
to no more than three or four.
 
✓ Forum: The Forum feature box gives you the most options to choose 
among, as shown in Figure 9-9.
 
 The View drop-down list gives you two options: Categories and Discussions. 
Choosing Categories displays categories you may have created in 
your discussion forum for topics to be classified under. You can read 
more about creating and managing forum categories in Chapter 11. 
Additionally, choosing Categories displays only the Show drop-down 
list, letting you display 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, or up to 20 categories.

151
 Chapter 9: Tweaking Your Network’s Main Page
 
Figure 9-9: 
The Forum 
feature box 
provides 
you very 
detailed 
control.
 
 
 Selecting Discussions displays discussion topics in the Forum feature 
box. Three other options become available:
 
• Display: This drop-down list gives you the option to show titles 
only or a detail view. The Titles Only option (shown in Figure 9-9) 
limits the information displayed to the title of the topic, the 
number of replies, the member who started the discussion, the cat-
egory it belongs to (if any), and the time stamp of the last reply.
 
 In addition to the information shown with the Titles Only option, 
the Detail View option (shown in Figure 9-10) displays the first 
three lines of the opening post below the discussion title.
 
• From: This drop-down list lets you choose among a wide range 
of options: Latest Activity, Newest Discussions, Most Replies, 
Featured, My Discussions Only, and Discussions from a Category.
 
 Latest Activity displays topics with the most recent activity (new 
topics as well as recent replies) at the top.
 
 Newest Discussions shows only the most recent discussions.
 
 Most Replies shows the discussion topics with the most replies at 
the top.
 
 Featured showcases featured topics in the Forum feature box. 
(Featuring discussions is discussed in Chapter 11 — and let there 
be no discussion about it.)

152
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
 
 My Discussions Only lets you display only your discussion topics, 
which may be useful in very special cases. (One of them would be 
if you have a super-sized ego.)
 
 Discussions from a Category lets you display discussions that are 
added to a specific category in your forum.
 
• Show: This drop-down list lets you display 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, or up 
to 20 discussion topics.
 
✓ Groups: The Groups feature box gives you two very straightforward 
options:
 
• From: This drop-down list gives you the following options, Most 
Recent, Most Members, Latest Activity, and Featured.
 
 Most Recent displays the groups that have been added most 
recently to your network.
 
 Most Members shows the group with the most members.
 
 Latest Activity lets you be a bit more hands-off; it dynamically dis-
plays the groups with the latest activity.
 
 Featured lets you control which groups you want to display, pick-
ing only those groups you’ve featured (see Chapter 12).
 
• Show: This drop-down list lets you display 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, or up 
to 20 groups.
 
Figure 9-10: 
The Detail 
View option 
lets you see 
a bit more

153
 Chapter 9: Tweaking Your Network’s Main Page
 
✓ Events: Because of their uniqueness (they represent activities with a 
location, date, and time tied to them), events have a few options that are 
not available in other feature boxes. The three drop-down lists available 
when you click the Edit button in the Events feature box are
 
• Display: This drop-down list lets you pick List View, Calendar, or 
Detail View. List View is shown in Figure 9-11. In addition to the 
event name, date, and time, you see only the location for each event.
 
 If you choose Calendar, the colorful icon next to each event is 
dropped for a handy-dandy calendar showing the current month 
with convenient links labeled Last Month and Next Month under-
neath it. The Calendar view is shown in Figure 9-12.
 
 If you choose Detail View, the icons shown are a tad bigger and the 
information shown for each event includes the event organizer, the 
event type, and the first few lines of the event description.
 
• From: This drop-down list lets you choose between Upcoming 
Events and Featured Events. Upcoming Events shows all up-
coming events, up to the total number that you choose to show. 
Featured Events gives you an extra bit of control over the events 
shown on the main page, letting you feature individual events, 
which in turn displays them in the feature box. You find out how to 
feature events in Chapter 12.
 
• Show: This drop-down list lets you display 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 events.
 
✓ Blog Posts: The Blog Posts feature box gives you three drop-down lists 
to control how and how many posts display:
 
• Display: This drop-down list works just like the Display drop-down 
list for the Forum feature box, giving you the option to choose 
between Detail View and Titles Only.
 
• From: This drop-down list lets you choose among Recently Added, 
Most Popular, Most Comments, Featured, and My Posts Only.
 
 Recently Added displays the most recent blog posts only.
 
 Most Popular displays the most viewed blog posts.
 
 Featured gives you the means to display posts you may have featured, 
which is a great way to highlight contributions from your members.
 
 My Posts Only is similar to the My Discussions Only option and is a 
handy tool to conveniently make announcements on the main page.
 
• Show: This drop-down list lets you display 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, or 20 
posts.
 
You can hide a certain feature from view on the main page without removing 
it from your network. Click the Edit button above the feature box and select 0 
(the first option available) from the Show drop-down list within the panel that 
appears.

Adding Items to the Right Column
You can add features on your network’s main page in the left column, the 
middle column, or the right column. Whatever you add to the left column and 
middle column appears only on the main page. But the right column is a dif-
ferent story.
Features you add to the top part of the right column appear on all pages of 
your network (refer to Figure 9-1, earlier in this chapter). This makes the 
right column a very important element of your network.

155
 Chapter 9: Tweaking Your Network’s Main Page
So what do you put in the right column? Glad you asked. Here are a few items 
that garner the most attention from appearing in the right column (and mem-
bers always know where to find them):
 
✓ Your own ads: If you pay the premium service to run your own ads (see 
Chapter 18), you need to make sure to place the ads in the right column. 
Even if you add other ads on your main page or throughout your net-
work, having ads in the right column of the network ensures that all 
pages visited by your members present an ad. If you use a service like 
Google AdSense, which displays different ads depending on the context 
of the page, you see how having the right column as the place for your 
ads is a no-brainer.
 
✓ Donate buttons: These buttons are there to help you raise money, 
so you should also place these in the right column to maximize their 
chance of getting seen (and clicked).
 
✓ Elements tied to spreading the word about your network: This 
includes the Get Badges feature and any text boxes that include links to 
other pages you may use to help you drive traffic to your network, such 
as your profile pages on Twitter, Facebook, or MySpace.
 
✓ Links to reference pages: If you have them, you might want to include a 
link to reference pages, such as a User Guide or your Terms of Use.
Including RSS Feeds on Your Main Page
Let’s face it: Because someone else has done it before or someone else does 
a better job at it than you can afford, there may be cases where you might 
benefit from syndicating someone else’s content. Nowadays this is done very 
easily by using a technology called RSS (Really Simple Syndication).
In a nutshell, RSS “pushes” changes to Web sites that include so-called RSS 
feeds in them. RSS feeds can come from blogs, news sites, Web sites with fre-
quently updated content, and so on. You too can take advantage of RSS feeds 
in your network on Ning. Here’s how:
 
1. Go to your Features page by clicking the Manage link in your naviga-
tion and then clicking Features below the Your Network heading.
 
2. Drag the RSS feature from the list of features on the left to the place 
on the main page layout where you want it to display.
 
 Do this as many times as you need, one RSS feature per RSS feed you 
want to add.
 
3. Click the Save button.

156
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
 
4. Click the Main link in your navigation.
 
5. Locate the RSS feature box on your main page and click the Add RSS 
link, as shown in Figure 9-13.
 
Figure 9-13: 
The RSS 
feature box 
lets you 
syndicate 
content 
from other 
Web sites.
 
 
6. Change the title from RSS to something relevant to the RSS feed that 
you’re adding.
 
 For example, I added a feed pulling all entries in Google News with 
the words for dummies. (If you perform a search for a term in Google 
News, the results page gives you a link to an RSS feed that you can use 
as explained in Step 7.) For this RSS feed, an appropriate title could be 
Dummies in the News.
 
7. Add the URL for the RSS feed; you can obtain the URL in the Web site 
that offers the RSS feed.
 
 Typically, you can copy the URL from your browser’s navigation bar 
(where you type a Web address) after clicking the little orange RSS icon 
(shown in Figure 9-14).
 
8. Choose between Detail View and Titles Only in the Display drop-
down list.
 
 Detail View shows the details beneath the title for each entry in the RSS 
feed. Take a look at the details for a few entries in the feed you are using 
to determine whether showing them is a good idea. If not, choose Titles 
Only to display only the title for each of the entries pulled by the RSS feed.
 
9. Determine how many items you want to show from the feed and 
choose 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, or 20 from the Show drop-down list.
 
 This decision is based strictly on the space available on your main page.
 
10. Click the Save button.
After you add an RSS feed, the items you choose to display appear in the format 
you select (detailed or title view), as shown in Figure 9-15. When visitors to 
your main page click a link, they are taken to the page that hosts the content.

content.
 
 
Although you can add as many as 10 RSS feeds to your main page, I highly 
recommend that you don’t add more than two or three. This consideration 
has to do with speed: Your main page will load as fast as the slowest RSS feed. 
Stacking RSS feed upon RSS feed adds to your total home page load time, 
potentially resulting in a painfully slow home page experience.
Using Text Boxes
Ning has already thought of most of the features you need to build your 
social network. But they knew you’d have needs that may not be covered by 
the features they offer, no matter how long the list.
Text Boxes are there to cover those special needs. Think of them as empty 
boxes that let you add almost anything to your main page: plain text, links, 
bulleted or numbered lists, images, video, JavaScript code, and the list goes 
on and on.

158
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
When you add a Text Box (by dragging and dropping Text Box on the 
Features page just like you do with RSS features), the Add Text link appears. 
Click it or the Edit button at the top right of the Text Box. Your editable 
space opens, as shown in Figure 9-16.
 
Figure 9-16: 
A Text Box 
lets you 
add almost 
anything 
not already 
offered 
by Ning.
 
The top line in Figure 9-16 lets you insert a title if you want to. In the text 
area at the bottom, you can type away and format your text; add an image; 
upload a file; or copy and paste HTML code from another Web site, such as 
YouTube. To add an image, click the second icon from the right. To upload a 
file, click the last icon on the right. In both cases, you can upload an item or 
insert an existing one.
At the bottom of the Text Box, you see the Add a Widget to This Textbox link. 
When you click the link, you’re taken to the Widgets page, which contains 
examples of widgets to let you add popular news items from CNN, interesting 
trivia, the latest Dilbert comic strip, clips from Saturday Night Live, and so on. 
If these don’t get your widget juices flowing, the page contains a list of widget 
providers to help you find what you need.
 
The examples on the Widgets page are all well-designed third-party Adobe 
Flash applications for you to embed in your Text Boxes. But beware of wid-
gets! Some widgets can be resource hogs: Add too many of them, and you may 
hurt the load time for your network’s home page. Other widgets may even 
cause your network to break or not display correctly, so try out any widgets 
you may want to add on a test network before you add them to your actual 
network.

Managing Members 
and Profile Pages
In This Chapter
▶ Allowing members to join your network
▶ Featuring members on your network
▶ Promoting and demoting members
▶ Managing profile pages
▶ Exporting member data
M
embers can make or break your network. I don’t mean break as in 
“crash, bring to its knees” break, but rather “I ain’t coming back to 
this site anymore” break. Sounds like a big statement; it is. Largely, the mem-
bers you welcome and feature in your network set the tone of your network. 
Therefore, it pays to spend time managing them.
In this chapter, I discuss the tools that you and your network’s Administrators 
can use to manage your members: selecting who can and cannot join, featuring 
members after they’ve joined, promoting members if they can help you more, 
and blocking members if they’re not being good citizens in your network. 
Additionally, you find out how to limit what your members can do with their 
profile pages.
Moderating Members
The first option you have to manage your members is to make your network 
private and set it up so that only invited people can join, as explained in 
Chapter 7. This may be ideal if you want to run a network for a private orga-
nization, a school, or a family where it’s important to restrict access. But 
making a network private isn’t the best option if you want as many people as 
possible to join.

160
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
A slightly more relaxed level of management is to moderate the members 
that request to join your network. This is done very easily:
 
1. Click the Manage link in your network’s navigation.
 
2. Select the Network Privacy option below Your Members.
 
 The Network Privacy page appears.
 
3. On the Network Privacy page, select the Approve New Members 
before They Can Join check box, as shown in Figure 10-1.
 
Figure 10-1: 
The 
Network 
Privacy 
page lets 
you moder-
ate new 
members 
in your 
network.
 
 
The ability to set up your network with member moderation is independent 
of the network’s being public or private. Public networks can be set up to let 
anyone see the main page of the network or see pages beyond the home page 
without being a member. Private networks can be set up to be invite-only or 
available to anyone to join; in both cases, nothing in the network is accessible 
to nonmembers.
New members who sign up for your network receive a message explaining 
that their membership is pending approval, as explained in Chapter 2.
As a Network Creator, you have the chance to review, approve, decline, or 
ban the membership request. You have a new member to approve when:
 
✓ You receive an e-mail notifying you. The e-mail contains the member’s 
name and e-mail address, as well as a link that takes you to a page where 
you can view the person’s profile. This page lets you accept or decline 
the membership request, as shown in Figure 10-2. You can handle the 
request by clicking the Actions drop-down list and selecting either 
Accept Membership or Decline Membership.

161
 Chapter 10: Managing Members and Profile Pages
 
✓ You view the number of new members awaiting approval. The 
number of new members awaiting membership is shown in the Awaiting 
Approval box in your network’s right column (refer to Figure 10-2). 
When you click the link with the number of new members, you’re taken 
to the page where you can accept them or decline them.
Either way, if you approve the person’s membership request, he receives a 
welcome e-mail.
 
Figure 10-2: 
You can 
approve, 
decline, or 
ban new 
members 
from the 
network.
 
Featuring Members
People like to feel loved and recognized. Luckily, networks on Ning give you 
the means to show your members some love — featuring them.
You feature members two ways: through the Members section or through the 
member’s profile page. Either one results in the member’s photo being added 
at the beginning of the Featured Members bundle at the top of the Members 
section, as shown in Figure 10-3.
 
Figure 10-3: 
You can 
feature 
members 
through the 
Members 
section.
 

162
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
To feature a member via the Members section:
 
1. Click the Members link on the navigation.
 
 The Members page appears.
 
2. Find the member you want to feature.
 
 Type in the member’s name in the search box at the top of the page 
and click the Search Members button; or click successive pages (at the 
bottom of the Members section) showing the photos of members until 
you find the member you want to feature.
 
3. Click the Feature link next to the member’s photo.
 
 This adds the member to the top of the list of Featured Members.
To feature a member via the member’s profile page, as shown in Figure 10-4:
 
1. Go to the member’s page.
 
 Click the member’s photo anywhere on the network.
 
2. Click the Feature link below the Admin Options header on the left 
side of the profile page.
 
 This step adds the member to the top of the list of Featured Members.
 
If you choose to display your featured members on your network’s main page, 
the members you feature in the Members section will appear in the Members 
box on the main page.
 
Figure 10-4: 
You can 
also feature 
members 
through 
their profile 
page.
 

163
 Chapter 10: Managing Members and Profile Pages
Managing Members
When members have been around long enough, they show their true 
colors. Some of them stand out particularly as candidates to become 
Administrators. Some of them also stand out because they don’t belong in 
your network.
This section discusses how to manage both extremes.
Promoting members
Promoting someone to Administrator should not be taken lightly, because 
Administrators have lots of power in the network (power to do things and to 
undo them, including the removal — accidental or not — of lots of content 
from the network). For details on the things that Administrators can and 
cannot do in the network, make sure to read Chapter 13.
Promoting someone to Administrator in the network is very easy to do:
 
1. Click the Manage link in your network’s navigation.
 
2. Select the Members option below Your Members.
 
 This step takes you to the Manage Members page, as shown in Figure 10-5.
 
3. Find the member you want to promote.
 
 Search for her by using the Search box next to the Search button or 
clicking successive pages at the bottom of the Members section until 
you find the member you want to promote.
 
4. Select the check box next to the member’s name, click the Actions 
drop-down list, and select the Set Role: Administrator option.
 
 If you need to demote an Administrator to member level, follow the 
same steps, but choose the Set Role: Member option from the Actions 
drop-down list.
 
Figure 10-5: 
This page 
allows you 
to promote, 
demote, 
and ban 
members.
 

164
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
To save yourself the need to search for the Administrator, you can click the 
Administrators tab (next to the Members tab), which hides all members who 
aren’t Administrators from view. (The Administrators tab is visible only to 
Network Creators and Administrators.)
Banning members
Promoting members, as I discuss in the preceding section, is not something 
you do (or need to do) every day. However, promoting a member feels good. 
You announce it to other members, and it’s a fun event. Too bad you don’t 
need to promote people more often! Why? Because the opposite action (ban-
ning someone) is not as much fun and, unfortunately, happens a lot more.
I’m not saying you’re going to be banning members from dawn ’til dusk, but 
no matter how innocent your network is or how much you believe this is not 
going to affect it, you’re going to find yourself banning members.
You may be able to avoid banning a member by reaching out to him via private 
messages first. You can explain to him why his actions or some content posted 
by him could lead to your banning him. However, this may not work. Some 
people clearly don’t care about you or your network: They want promote their 
scam or spam your members promoting their product without your consent. 
So you’d better know the two ways to ban someone from your network:
 
✓ Through the Members management page: Follow the same steps 
you follow to promote a member. After you check the box next to the 
member you want to ban, click the Actions drop-down list and choose 
Ban from Network. You’re then asked to confirm your decision; click the 
Ban button.
 
✓ Through the member’s profile page: Follow the same steps you follow 
to feature a member, but instead of clicking the Feature link, click the 
Ban Member link.
Banning a member presents you with the confirmation window shown in 
Figure 10-6. To proceed with the ban, click the Ban button. To backpedal on 
the ban, click the Cancel button.
When the member is banned, the profile page is no longer visible to others, 
and all contributions the member made to the network (content added, 
comments left on other members’ walls, and so on) are deleted. This means 
contributions do not come back even if you remove the ban on the member 
later. If you remove the ban on the member, the profile information originally 
entered reappears on the member’s profile page.

165
 Chapter 10: Managing Members and Profile Pages
 
Figure 10-6: 
You’re 
asked to 
confirm your 
decision 
before 
you ban a 
member.
 
If a banned member tries to sign into the network, she sees the page shown 
in Figure 10-7, which explains that she’s been banned from the network.
The same page gives the member an opportunity to contact you. This typi-
cally results in a variation of the “Why was I banned?” message, which you 
can expect to hit your inbox a short while after you click the Ban button.
 
Figure 10-7: 
Banned 
members

about the 
ban when 
they try to 
sign in.
 
If you need to remove the ban on a member, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Manage link in your network’s navigation.
 
2. Select the Members option below Your Members.
 
3. Click the Banned tab above the list of members.
 
4. Check the box next to the name of the member that you want to 
remove the ban from.
 
5. Click the Remove Ban button.

Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
Managing Profile Pages
Moving things around, changing colors, and adding applications to your 
profile page can be some of the most fun a member can have in a network on 
Ning. But hey! Maybe you have a very good reason to forbid your members 
from changing anything on their profile pages. The good news (for you) is 
that you can control what they can do on their profile pages.
By clicking the Manage link in your network’s navigation and clicking the 
Feature Controls link, you arrive on the Feature Controls page, as shown in 
Figure 10-8.
 
Figure 10-8: 
The Feature 
Controls 
page lets 
you limit 
the use of a 
number of 
features.
 Use these options to control what members can change on their pages.
At the bottom of this page, you have three options to control how much or 
how little your members can do on their profile page. All three are selected 
by default:
 
✓ Allow members to change their My Page theme: This option allows 
your members to customize the appearance of their My Page. If you 
deselect it, the option to change the My Page theme becomes unavail-
able to members.

167
 Chapter 10: Managing Members and Profile Pages
 
✓ Allow members to adjust their My Page layout: This option lets your 
members move features on their My Page. If you deselect it, all the pro-
file pages have the same layout.
 
✓ Allow members to add applications to their My Page: If deselected, 
this option removes all OpenSocial applications from your members’ 
profile pages. If you select this check box, your members are able to 
add OpenSocial applications to their profile page. You can find out more 
about OpenSocial applications in Chapter 21.
There! Not the most popular options to disable — if you ask me — but you 
may have very good reasons to do so.
Exporting Member Data
You may want to export your member data for a number of reasons:
 
✓ To analyze it in Excel, so you can learn about the demographics of your 
network
 
✓ To gather members’ e-mail addresses so you can send them a newslet-
ter, assuming you’ve asked them whether it’s okay for you to do so
 
✓ To have a backup of the data
Whatever your reason for doing it, follow these steps to export all the 
answers your members entered during their registration:
 
1. Click the Manage link in your navigation.
 
2. Click the Members link below the Your Members heading.
 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
 
4. Click the Export All Member Data (.CSV) link.
 
5. Click OK in the window that appears, which prompts you to confirm 
whether you want to start the export process.
 
 The more members you have, the longer this process takes.
 
6. Make sure to keep the browser window open during the export process.
 
 When the export finishes, you’re presented with a window confirming 
the success. As shown in Figure 10-9, click the link titled This Link to 
save the CSV document containing the member data on your local hard 
drive.

Chapter 11
Managing the Forum, 
Notes, and Chats
In This Chapter
▶ Your network’s forum
▶ Notes in your network
▶ Chats in your network
You have your network up. You’ve made it look nice. You have members 
coming in the door, and you’ve decided what they can do (and not do). 
Now you have to deal with the features in more depth, creating and managing 
content so your network starts to take shape.
In this chapter, you read about your network’s Forum, Notes, and Chat 
features — how to set them up and make the most of them.
Your Network’s Forum
The forum is the area in your network where members can initiate new dis-
cussion topics or respond to existing ones. (You may have heard about this 
referred to elsewhere as a discussion board.) Unlike chat, the forum lets mem-
bers in your network communicate publicly with one another in a way that 
doesn’t require them to be online at the same time.
The forum is bound to be one of the busy areas in your network, so it’s worth 
paying close attention to: creating categories for posts to go in, featuring dis-
cussions, moderating them, and starting new ones.

170
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
Managing the forum
Managing the forum is almost an art. I know that sounds clichéd, but it really 
is. Let me show you why.
Click your network’s Manage link at the top, and on the Manage page that 
appears, click the Discussion Forum link below the Your Network heading. 
The Manage Forum page appears, as shown in Figure 11-1.
 
Figure 11-1: 
The Manage 
Forum page 
lets you 
control your 
forum’s 
style and 
categories.
 

171
 Chapter 11: Managing the Forum, Notes, and Chats
Starting from the top, this page lets you change the following on the forum:
 
✓ Discussion Style: This area controls how replies in a forum topic are 
shown. You have two options:
 
• Flat: This option shows all replies in a forum topic in chronologi-
cal order (from oldest to most recent). This can be convenient in 
some cases but confusing if you want to follow “conversations” 
between members within a topic. Figure 11-2 shows how the flat 
discussion style looks.
 
• Threaded: This option indents replies that are posted about a spe-
cific post, allowing members to more easily follow the flow of a dis-
cussion. This style is my favorite. Figure 11-3 shows how the same 
discussion topic looks with the threaded discussion style.
 
✓ Main Forum Page Style: This option lets you modify how the main page 
of your forum looks. You have three choices:
 
• Categories: This option displays all the categories in your forum. 
This is one of the cleanest options available, although it doesn’t 
make it easy to visualize the most recent discussion topics. 
Figure 11-4 shows how the main Forum page looks when you select 
the Categories option. From the View drop-down list, members 
can switch from Categories to Discussions. When you choose 
Discussions, you’re given more options in a Sort By drop-down 
list. The options you can sort by are Latest Activity, Newest 
Discussions, and Most Popular.
 
• Latest Discussions by Time: This option simply lists the most recent 
discussion topics sorted by latest activity (when the topic started 
or when a new reply was posted). When this option is selected, 
members can sort the discussion topics by Latest Activity (the 
default order), Newest Discussions, or Most Popular by select-
ing one of those alternatives from the Sort By drop-down list, as 
shown in Figure 11-5.
 
• Latest Discussions by Category: This option shows all categories 
as a list on the left side of the main Forum page. It also groups 
discussion topics under their respective category, sorting them 
chronologically. It is a blend of sorts between the first two options 
(Categories and Latest Discussions by Time). You can see how it 
looks on the main Forum page in Figure 11-6.

✓ Categories: At the bottom of the Manage Forum page, you have the list-
ing of categories in the forum. Before you create any categories, there is 
an empty Category Title/Description placeholder for a category, so you 
can start fleshing out and adding information for that category and new 
ones you may need. As shown in Figure 11-1, earlier in this chapter, you 
can enter the following information for each category (you can actually 
do this for multiple categories at a time):
 
• Category Title: The category is listed in the forum under this name.
 
• Who can post on the category: You have two options. You can 
allow members to start discussions in the category or allow only 
Administrators to start discussions in the category. If you select 
the second option, the check box below it lets you set up the cat-
egory to allow members to reply (checked by default). If you don’t 
want members to be able to reply in the category you’re creating, 
uncheck the box. This can be useful when you want to keep a cat-
egory for network announcements (one-way communications to 
members).

174
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
 
• Description: This text explains what kinds of discussions are 
appropriate in the category you are creating. The description text 
appears below the category title on the main Forum page as well as 
on the category page itself.
 
• Delete or Add Another Category: If you change your mind and don’t 
want the category anymore, click the Delete link. If you want to add 
another category, click the Add Another Category link that appears 
directly above the location on the page where you want the new 
category to appear.
When you finish making any changes to the style or categories in the forum, 
click the Save button at the bottom to save your changes.
Managing forum discussions
A Network Creator or an Administrator has a lot of control over discussion 
topics on the network. As shown in Figure 11-7, the following options can be 
found below the Admin Options header:
 
✓ Feature: Clicking this link pushes the discussion topic to the top of the 
featured discussions list. If you set the Main Forum Page Style option 
to list Categories or Latest Discussions by Time, featured discus-
sions appear at the top of the main Forum page under the Featured 
Discussions header. Also, featured discussions appear in the Forum 
feature box on the main page of the network if you set it up as explained 
in Chapter 9. When you click this link, it changes to read Stop Featuring, 
which you can click to, not surprisingly, stop featuring the discussion.
 
✓ Close Discussion: Clicking this option prevents any further replies 
from being added to the discussion. This option is also available to the 
member who started the discussion, not only to Administrators and to 
the Network Creator. When you click the link, it changes to read Re-open 
Discussion, which you can click to allow further replies to be posted. It’s 
a good practice to leave one last post in the topic explaining the reason 
for closing the discussion.
 
✓ Add Tags: This option (also available to the member who started the 
discussion) works just like the Add Tags link for photos and videos (see 
Chapter 4), letting you describe with keywords what the topic is about.
 
✓ Delete Discussion: Clicking this link results in the removal of the entire 
discussion topic, deleting the initial post along with all the replies. 
Before removing the topic, you get a confirmation box asking whether 
you are sure that you want to do so. This option, along with the Feature 
option, is visible only to the Network Creator and to Administrators of 
the network.

175
 Chapter 11: Managing the Forum, Notes, and Chats
 
If you want to remove a single reply in a discussion topic, not the entire dis-
cussion, click the small X on the top right of the post you want to delete, as 
shown Figure 11-8.

Notes in Your Network
If you’ve heard of Wikipedia, the Notes feature lets you do something similar 
to a certain extent: It’s a wiki (a Web page on which content can be added or 
edited by people who visit it). However, the big difference is that Notes can 
be added or edited only by the Network Creator or Administrators.
The Notes feature lets you create static pages with HTML formatting, which 
comes in handy for a variety of things. For example, you can create Notes for 
a network Help page, an About Us page, a New User Guide, articles, recipes, 
and much more.

176
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
This section goes into detail about the Notes feature and about how you can 
take advantage of it.
Adding notes
Notes is not included by default among the features that launch with your 
network, so before you can add any notes, you need to make sure to add 
Notes as a feature to your network. To add the Notes feature, click the 
Manage link on your network’s navigation and click the Features icon below 
the Your Network header. Click the Notes feature in the Features list on the 
left and drag it where you want to include it on your network’s main page, as 
explained in Chapter 7. One area I find it useful to add Notes to is the bottom-
right corner of the main page, where it’s fairly nonobtrusive.
When you add the Notes feature, Notes is a new option in your network’s 
navigation. Click it to add a note. The page that opens is in itself a note, titled 
Notes Home by default, as shown in Figure 11-9.
 
Figure 11-9: 
Clicking 
Notes takes 
you to 
the Notes 
Home page.
 
From the Notes Home page, you can do the following:
 
✓ To add a new note, click the Add a Note link at the top right of the page.
 
✓ To view all notes, click the All Notes link on the left side of the page or 
click the Click Here link next to To View All Notes.
 
✓ To feature the note you’re on, click the Feature link under the Admin 
Options heading. Featuring a note has a similar effect to featuring a dis-
cussion topic but highlights it on the Notes page and the Notes box on 
the main page.
 
✓ To edit the note you’re on, click the Edit Note link below Feature. When 
you click Edit Note, the page shown in Figure 11-10 appears.
When the note is in editing mode, you can modify its title, which appears 
with a yellow background, and the note’s content.

177
 Chapter 11: Managing the Forum, Notes, and Chats
 
Figure 11-10: 
Editing a 
note lets 
you modify 
its title and 
its content.
 
You can edit the content of the note in Rich Text format or in Source format 
and preview your changes:
 
✓ The Rich Text option lets you edit the note in a way that resembles how 
the note appears to those who view it after it’s saved. You have a bar 
above the content window, with buttons that facilitate the formatting of 
the note’s content. You can see the bar in detail in Figure 11-11.
 
 A couple points to keep in mind while you use the Rich Text option are
 
• Adding an image larger than the width of the note results in the 
image’s resizing. If you aren’t happy with the resulting size (if it’s 
still too big), click a corner of the image and slide it to resize it to 
your liking — all of this without having to mess with the HTML code!
 
• The Rich Text formatting options take care of most of the needs 
you are bound to run into. But if you need to tweak things down 
to the pixel level, you’re better served with the Source option. For 
example, if you want to embed video and other widgets, you would 
have to select the Source option.
 
✓ The Source option allows you to control the HTML code of the content 
in the note. If you’re familiar with HTML, help yourself. However, you’re 
bound to run into some natural restrictions put in place by the folks at 
Ning, mainly for your own protection. See the Technical Stuff note about 
what flies and what is stripped from the code if you try to add it to a note.
 
 Notes support plain text and basic HTML. JavaScript, CSS expressions, 
and the following HTML tags are not supported: <script>, <frame>, 
<iframe>, <html>, and <body>.

✓ The Preview option allows you do just that: preview your note before 
you save the changes. This option lets you see the note exactly as it will 
look when published, but it doesn’t allow you to make any edits; you 
have to go back to the Rich Text option or the Source option to do that.
When you finish with any changes to a note (these details apply equally when 
adding or editing notes), click the Save button (either the one above the 
content window or the one below it). You’re taken to the note’s page, which 
reflects the changes you made.

The many uses of notes
I hope your wheels are spinning with the many ways you can use Notes. In 
case you’re not as excited as I am, here are some things you can do with 
Notes:
 
✓ Help section: You can create for your members an FAQ (frequently 
asked questions) section that includes the most common questions you 
receive and answers to them.
 
✓ About Us page: You can talk a bit more about your network, how it 
started, who’s running it, and so on. You can even include a photo of 
you back when you were thinking of starting the network.
 
✓ Guidelines for your network: You can describe what content is fair play 
and what actions will get a member banned. Your network’s Terms of 
Use are discussed in detail in Chapter 17.

179
 Chapter 11: Managing the Forum, Notes, and Chats
 
✓ New User Guide: You can give tips to your members here, such as 
how a member gets started or how to get over the fear of saying “hi” to 
others in the network.
 
✓ Links page: Web sites commonly carry a list of other Web sites they rec-
ommend. This is another great use for the Notes feature.
 
The folks at Ning made life easier for you by making the HTML templates avail-
able for the examples mentioned in this section, along with a few more that 
you’re welcome to copy and paste into a new note in your network. This way, 
you don’t have to play with the formatting as much and you can focus on the 
content. Get the code by visiting http://networkcreators.ning.com/
notes.
Chats in Your Network
Considering how popular chat is in networks on Ning, you’d imagine I would 
talk about it earlier. But the best comes to those who wait. I know that 
sounds corny, but I had to say it!
Chat gives your members a tool to interact with one another uniquely. Chat 
is a unique feature because the interaction between your members happens 
right away, in real time — unlike how interaction happens when they leave 
each other comments through the forum.
This section deals with chat in your network and the tools you have to make 
it a successful feature.
Adding Chat to your network
Adding Chat to your network is a fairly easy task. Like Notes, Chat is not one 
of the default features launched with all networks, although it won’t be sur-
prising if that changes in the future.
To add the Chat feature, click the Manage link in your navigation, click 
Features, and select the check box next to Chat from the Features list. Then 
click the Save button. A Chat bar gets added at the bottom of all pages 
throughout your network. Any member whose status is set to online (see 
Chapter 6) can chat with other online members without intervention from 
you or your Administrators.
 
Why do this? Having the ability to enable and disable Chat on the main page 
gives you a great level of control. This is ideal when you want to have sched-
uled chats (a great way to keep your members coming back): You promote 
the chat, create a network event for it, and invite all the members and/or use 

180
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
a banner on the main page. When the scheduled chat session is over, you can 
disable the chat window by clicking the X in the top-right corner of the chat 
window.
Moderating chat in your network
 
 There are two nifty tools to help you keep things in check in a chat. Network 
Creators and Administrators can clear the messages from the chat server, in 
case you want to get rid of any inappropriate messages that may have been 
posted throughout a chat session. (This option is not available to members.) 
To do this, click the third icon that appears above the text box where you 
type in your messages in the Chat window. (This icon is shown in the margin.)
A second resource to help you moderate your chat is the ability to ban any 
member from it. In Chapter 6, you see how other members can engage in pri-
vate chats and easily access each other’s profile pages. Another option that 
Network Creators and Administrators have that members don’t see when 
they click the icon of one of the chat participants is the one that lets you ban 
a member from the chat.
If someone is being too smart for her own good, you can pull your “chat stun 
gun” if you will and ban them from chatting for a while. Click the member’s 
icon and the Ban Member option at the bottom lets you do just this. When 
you click the Ban Member link, you’re presented with a message asking you 
to confirm whether you really want to ban this member and for how long (4 
hours, 8 hours, 12 hours or 24 hours), as shown in Figure 11-12.
If you choose to ban the member, the next time she tries to type anything in 
the chat, she’s presented with the message You have been temporarily 
banned from this chat. (A permanent ban from the chat can be accom-
plished only by banning the member from the network.) Everything else in 
Ning works just fine for this member, and everyone in the chat will probably 
be just fine too. Gotta love it, don’t you think?

bers from 
the chat 
temporarily.
 

Chapter 12
Managing Multimedia, 
Groups, and Events
In This Chapter
▶ Taking advantage of your network’s multimedia features
▶ Keeping an eye on groups in your network
▶ Managing your network’s events
M
ultimedia, groups, and events give social networks on Ning an impor-
tant part of the edge that makes them stand out.
Without photos, videos, and music, social networks would be missing elements 
that most people nowadays take for granted in other networks, like Facebook 
and MySpace. Without groups, big networks would become too much like a 
big city where you can easily get lost. And without events, members would not 
have the chance to conveniently learn about relevant activities taking place 
around them.
It is true that the forum, chat, and notes (covered in Chapter 11) constitute 
the backbone of the network. The features discussed in this chapter give 
you — the Network Creator — the power to make your social network as 
powerful and complete as it can be these days.
Multimedia Features in Your Network
Multimedia features of networks on Ning consist of photos, videos, and 
music. These features are among the Ning-integrated ones among which you 
can pick and choose during the network setup process.
If you didn’t add photos, videos, or music while setting up your network, you 
can do so at any time by clicking the Manage link in your network’s naviga-
tion and then clicking the Features icon below the Your Network header.

182
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
If you want to add photos or videos to your network, click the respective 
feature in the Features list on the left and drag it where you want to include it 
on your network’s main page. When you’re done, click the Save button at the 
bottom.
If you want to add music, click View All Features to display the Music option 
and then follow the same steps you would follow for photos, videos, or any 
other feature.
After you add these features, your members can add content to the newly 
created Photos or Videos sections or to the Music Player on their profile 
pages.
Importing photos from Flickr
You and most of your members may prefer to upload photos directly to your 
network, as explained in Chapter 4. However, there is a chance that some 
of them (and even you) have an account already set up with Flickr, one of 
the most popular photo-sharing services on the Web. To make it easier to 
integrate photos from your Flickr account, your network supports importing 
photos from Flickr.
Before anything else, make sure you have an account on Flickr. If you don’t 
have one, go to www.flickr.com and sign up for one. If you have a Flickr 
account, keep going.
 
To set up your network to import photos from Flickr, you need to obtain a Flickr 
API key. An API key is a unique code that is used to identify your network.
Make sure to get a different Flickr API key for every social network that needs 
to have Flickr photo importing. All of them can be set up through the same 
Flickr account.
To set up Flickr photo importing, here’s what you do:
 
1. Click the Manage link in your network’s navigation, and click the 
Flickr Importing option under the Your Network heading.
 
 The Flickr Import Setup page appears, and it walks you through the 
steps to set this up, as shown in Figure 12-1.
 
2. Click the Apply for a New API Key link.
 
 You’re taken to a page on Flickr with a form.
 
3. Complete the form on Flickr with your name, e-mail address, use for 
the key (select noncommercial use), and a description of the applica-
tion, and click the Apply button.

183
 Chapter 12: Managing Multimedia, Groups, and Events
 
 For the use of the key, you can write something like “To support import-
ing of photos from Flickr into my social network.”
 
 After you click Apply, Flickr sends you to a new page, as shown at the 
top of Figure 12-2.
 
4. Click the Edit Key Details link on Flickr to configure user authentica-
tion for the new key.
 
 You arrive at the API Key Authentication Setup page.
 
5. Copy the Web address below Setup Your Key on the Flickr Import 
Setup page (shown on the left in Figure 12-2), paste the Web address 
into the Callback URL field of the API Key Authentication Setup page 
on Flickr, and click the Save Changes button.
 
Figure 12-1: 
You can

network 
to allow 
importing of 
photos from 
Flickr.
 
 
Figure 12-2: 
Setting up 
a Flickr 
API key is 
simple: You 
only need 
to copy and 
paste.
 

184
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
 
 The confirmation page you’re taken to in Flickr contains two elements 
that you must copy and paste into the respectively named boxes in the 
Flickr Import Setup page: Your Key and Your Secret. The two boxes are 
shown on the left in Figure 12-3.
 
6. Copy and paste your key and secret into the appropriate text boxes.
 
7. Click the Save button, and you’re set.
 
Figure 12-3: 
Pasting the 
key and 
the secret 
is the last 
step of the 
Flickr Import 
Setup 
process.
 
Your members can now import photos from their Flickr accounts by follow-
ing the instructions explained in Chapter 4.
Adding music tracks to your network
It’s easy for a member to add music to his profile page, as you see in Chapter 4. 
Note that only the Network Creator or Administrators can add music to the 
network for everyone to enjoy through the Music Player on the main page or 
for members to choose tracks to add to their own Music Players.
To add music to the network, click the Add Music link below the Music Player 
on the main page, as shown on Figure 12-4.
The page you’re taken to looks exactly like the one members see when they 
add music themselves. Turn to Chapter 4 for details on uploading music to 
your network past this point.
 
Figure 12-4: 
Adding 
music to 
your net-
work is 
very easy.
 

185
 Chapter 12: Managing Multimedia, Groups, and Events
Managing the music in your network
You can manage the music in your network in two ways:
 
✓ Managing the network’s playlist: Management begins by clicking the 
Edit Playlist link below the Music Player on the main page (refer to 
Figure 12-4, earlier in this chapter). The remaining steps involved are 
identical to how members manage the playlists on their profile pages, as 
described in Chapter 4.
 
✓ Editing the settings of the Music Player: You can edit the settings by 
clicking the Edit button at the top right of the Music Player on the main 
page. This gives you three check boxes and a drop-down list, as shown 
in Figure 12-5.
 
Figure 12-5: 
You can 
configure 
the Music 
Player on 
the main 
page in 
a number 
of ways.
 
When you click the Edit button in your Music Player, you get the following 
options:
 
✓ Autoplay: When you select the Autoplay check box, the music on the 
playlist of the Music Player starts to play automatically when someone 
lands on the network’s main page. This can come in handy when used 
as part of a welcome-message podcast or an announcement of a new 
release in a social network for an artist, such as the Britney Spears or 50 
Cent social networks. However, the Autoplay option can also be annoy-
ing in some circumstances, so use it wisely: You don’t want members to 
stop visiting your network because a song started playing . . . while they 
were Web surfing at work!
 
✓ Show Playlist: This check box is useful if you want visitors to the main 
page to have an idea of what tracks they can expect after the one cur-
rently playing. If this option isn’t as important to them (or to you), 

186
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
there’s no need to select it. This option simply shows the playlist below 
the controls of the Music Player.
 
✓ Shuffle Playlist: Selecting this check box sets the Music Player playback 
mode to Shuffle mode every time someone visits the main page. The 
result is a playlist that jumps randomly between tracks. Again, it may or 
may not be important or useful to your members or you.
 
✓ Play: This drop-down list gives you the most control over the Music 
Player. You can choose among the following options:
 
• Playlist: This option simply displays the tracks the Network Creator 
or the Administrators have uploaded through the Add Music link on 
the main page, in the order that they were added to the network.
 
• Most Recent: This option works just like the Playlist option except 
for the fact that it also includes all tracks added by network mem-
bers to the list of available tracks, in the order in which they were 
added to the network.
 
• Featured: This option includes in the Playlist only those tracks that 
have been featured. Tracks can be featured only by the Network 
Creator and the Administrators through their profile pages. While 
the track is playing in the personal Music Player, clicking the 
Feature link above the controls of the player features it.
 
• Highest Rated: This option sorts tracks with the ones that have the 
highest rating sitting at the top going down to the ones with the 
lowest rating.
 
• Podcast: This option lets you take advantage of an existing audio 
podcast you (or someone else) may be recording that is relevant 
to the topic of your network. If you choose this option, a new URL 
field is displayed below the Play drop-down list, where you need to 
enter the address for the podcast. Typically, the URL can be found 
on the Web site through which the podcast is made available and 
then copied and pasted here.
When you’re done making changes to how you want your Music Player to 
behave, click the Save button.
Besides managing your Music Player, you can edit your network’s playlist by 
clicking the Edit Playlist link below the Music Player. The page you’re taken 
to looks exactly like the one that members see when they edit their own play-
lists, which I explain in detail in Chapter 4.
Moderating photos and videos
Moderating photos and videos is possible in your network on Ning. This may 
not be necessary if your members are well behaved, but you may find your-
self needing to keep an eye on user-submitted media. If this is your case, you 

187
 Chapter 12: Managing Multimedia, Groups, and Events
can set things up so that you (or one of your Administrators) must approve 
photos or videos before the rest of the members can view them.
 
Be prepared to do more maintenance work in your network if you choose to 
moderate photos. Considering the popularity of the Photos feature, you may find 
yourself having to view (and decide on) a large number of photos every day.
If you want to approve photos or videos before they appear on your network, 
click the Manage link in your network’s navigation and then click the Feature 
Controls link below the Your Members heading. On the Feature Controls 
page, select the check box next to either Approve Photos before They Appear 
or Approve Videos before They Appear, depending on which (photos and/or 
videos) you want to moderate. You can see both options in Figure 12-6.
When this option is set for photos or videos, members who upload either 
media get a message when they’re done, confirming that the items were suc-
cessfully uploaded and are awaiting approval.
If any items are awaiting approval, below the Quick Add drop-down list in the 
top-right section the Network Creator and Administrators can see a link with 
the number of photos and videos awaiting approval inside a yellow box, as 
shown in Figure 12-7.
Also, when photos or videos are waiting to be approved, the Network 
Creator and the Administrators receive an e-mail with a link to approve them. 
Clicking the link leads to the same page where the photo or video can be 
approved.
 
Figure 12-6:

photos

the network.

You have three ways to approve or delete photos:
 
✓ Approve or delete all photos at once: The Approve Photos page lets 
you approve or delete all photos submitted for approval by clicking 
the Approve All or Delete All buttons, as shown in Figure 12-8. This can 
be convenient from a housekeeping point of view if you have a large 
number of photos to approve.
 
✓ Approve (or delete) one page of photos at a time: You can choose to 
show 10, 20, or 50 photos per page, to approve or delete batches of 
photos at a time but not all photos at once. To approve all photos on the 
page you’re viewing, click the Approve Page button. To delete them all, 
click the Delete Page button.
 
✓ Approve or delete photos one by one: To do so, click the Approve or 
Delete button next to each of them. This method gives you the oppor-
tunity to more closely evaluate each photo: You can click a photo and 
approve or delete it from the page you go to, as shown in Figure 12-9. 
To approve the photo, click the Approve button. To delete it, click the 
Delete link.
The approval process for videos is identical to the process for photos.

Managing photos and videos
Once photos can be viewed by the network at large, you have three options 
available to manage photos and videos, as shown in Figure 12-10:
 
✓ Feature: Below each photo or video, the Network Creator and the 
Administrators can see a Feature link. Clicking it pushes the photo or 
video into the Featured Photos or Featured Videos list. These appear 
at the top of the Photos or Videos page, below the Featured Photos or 
Featured Videos header.
 
 To stop featuring a photo or a video, simply click the Stop Featuring link 
below it. Doing so removes the item from the list of Featured Photos or 
Featured Videos.
 
✓ Add Tags: This option works the same way as the Add Tags link for 
photos and videos described in Chapter 4, which is available to the 
member who added the photo or video. It lets you add keywords that 
help describe what the photo or video is about.
 
✓ Delete Photo or Delete Video: Clicking this link results in the removal 
of the video after presenting you with a confirmation box asking you if 
you are sure you want to remove the item. This option is visible to the 
member who added the photo or video, the Network Creator, and the 
Administrators.

190
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
 
Figure 12-10: 
You can

photos and

Photos and videos on the main page
As discussed in Chapter 9, featured photos and featured videos appear in the 
Photos and Videos boxes on the network’s main page, if you set the boxes up 
to display featured items. This isn’t the only option available when you click 
the Edit button for the Photos or Videos box.
Photos can be displayed in three ways, and the options are available within 
the Display drop-down list. Your display options are
 
✓ Slideshow: This option displays photos taking up the whole width of the 
main page column where they are placed in, as shown in Figure 12-11. 
The slideshow can pull photos from among the Recently Added, the 
Most Popular, the Featured ones, Random photos, and from your own 
Albums. These options are available through the From drop-down list.
 
✓ Thumbnails: This option displays photos in a format similar to the one 
on the Photos page. If the photos feature is in the middle column, three 
thumbnails are shown per row, as shown in Figure 12-12. If it is placed 
in the right or left column, only one thumbnail is shown per row. The 
thumbnails can pull from among the Recently Added, the Most Popular, 
the Featured ones, and from your own Albums. Last, with this option, 
you can pick 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 from the Show drop-down list to choose 
how many rows of thumbnails you want to display.
 
✓ Albums: This option displays rows of three album covers, letting you 
choose the photo albums among those Recently Added, Most Popular, 
and Featured from the From drop-down list. Last, you can also select to 
0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 rows of albums.

The Video box on the main page gives you only a couple of options, as shown 
in Figure 12-13:
 
✓ From: This drop-down list lets you choose which videos to display. You 
can select Featured, Recently Added, or Highest Rated.
 
✓ Show: This drop-down list lets you choose how many videos to display. 
If the Video box on the main page is in the left or right columns, you can 
display 0 to 12 videos. If the Video box is in the middle column, you can 
choose to display 0, 3, 6, 9, or 12 videos. This restriction is in place in 
order to ensure that rows of three videos are displayed.
The Photo box on the main page also gives you From and Show options. The 
From option lets you choose Recently Added, Most Popular, or Featured 
photos, along with all your photo albums. The Show option lets you pick 0, 2, 
4, 6, 8, or 10 rows of photos.

Allowing music downloads
 
One of the most important controls you can have in terms of music in your 
network is the ability for your members to download (or not) music added 
to the Music Player. If you allow this to happen, however, nothing prevents 
distribution of copyrighted music tracks among your members through your 
network other than their own restraint from uploading copyrighted content 
or, if they find it on your network, from downloading it.
If you spot a song that you suspect to be material posted without permission 
from the copyright owner, you can (and should) delete it from your network.
Still, Ning lets you make the ultimate decision. If you trust your members to 
do the right thing, you can allow Music Player tracks to be downloaded. This 
may actually be perfect if you intend to use it as a means to distribute music 
or podcasts that you have the rights to.
To enable Music Player tracks to be downloaded, follow the same steps to 
set up photo and video moderation explained earlier in this chapter, select 
the check box next to Enable Music Player Download Links (it is deselected 
by default) on the Feature Controls page (refer to Figure 12-6, earlier in this 
chapter) and then click the Save button.
Groups in Your Network
Groups are my favorite Ning feature. The reason I love them so much is 
because they give members the power to create smaller networks within 
your network. A network on Ning with multiple groups is the ultimate expres-
sion of success: It means your members have made the network theirs so 
much that they want to help co-create a part of it with other like-minded 
members.

193
 Chapter 12: Managing Multimedia, Groups, and Events
The Groups feature, like the other features discussed earlier in this chapter, 
can be added to your network as it’s created. Like other features, to add 
Groups to your network, click the Manage link in your network’s navigation, 
click the Features link under Your Network, drag and drop the Groups option 
from the Features list into the spot where you want it to appear on the main 
page, and click the Save button.
Controlling groups
When you first add the Groups feature to your network, members can add 
groups without any restriction. You can control whether members can add 
groups, and if you allow group creation by members, you can also set things 
up so that you must approve groups before they appear on the network.
To control group creation and moderate groups, click the Manage link and 
click the Feature Controls link under the Your Members heading. If you want 
your members to be able to create groups (something I strongly recommend 
you do), make sure to leave the check box next to Allow Members to Create 
Groups (under Groups) selected, as shown in Figure 12-14.
 
Figure 12-14: 
You can 
control 
group 
creation 
or moder-
ate groups 
before they 
appear.
 
If you allow your members to create groups, you have an option that is equiv-
alent to the one that lets you approve photos and videos before they appear 
on the network. If you want to have this kind of control over groups, select 
Approve Groups before They Appear check box and click the Save button at 
the bottom of the Feature Controls page.
If you set up groups to be approved before they appear, after a member goes 
through the steps to create a group (as explained in Chapter 6), instead of 
being able to immediately invite everyone and her mother to the group, she 
gets a message indicating that the group is waiting for approval, as shown in 
Figure 12-15.

194
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
In the same way as with photos and videos, when a group is waiting for 
approval, the Network Creators and Administrators receive an e-mail with a 
link to the Approve Groups page, as shown in Figure 12-16.
In this page, you can approve all pending groups (by clicking Approve All) or 
a page worth of outstanding groups (by clicking Approve Page). To approve 
groups individually, click the Approve button next to each group. You can 
also access the Approve Groups page by clicking the link below the Awaiting 
Approval header in the right column of the network.

groups are

erated, they

Groups 
page lets

Managing groups
Besides allowing members to create groups and setting up your network to 
approve groups before they appear on the network, you can edit groups. To 
edit a group, go to the group’s page and click the Edit Group link below the 
group’s Admin Options, and you’re taken to the page shown in Figure 12-17.

195
 Chapter 12: Managing Multimedia, Groups, and Events
 
Figure 12-17: 
You can 
modify most 
of the group 
details by 
clicking 
the Edit 
Group link.
 
Editing a group means you can change anything in the Group Information sec-
tion (name, image, description, and so on) except for the group address (the 
URL for the group). You can also modify the group’s features and whether 
members are allowed to send messages to the entire group. The only thing 
you cannot edit is the group’s privacy settings, which are set up during the 
creation of the group.
Being able to edit groups may come in handy for a number of reasons. For 
example, sometimes members need help adjusting something in the group 
that they have a hard time with. Also, if you don’t moderate new groups 
before they appear on the network, by editing the group you can adjust cer-
tain things (the group image, for example) that may be objectionable but not 
reason enough to remove the group altogether.
Another admin option you have available lets you remove a group. To do 
this, click the Delete Group on the right side of the Group page.
 
Think of this scenario: A member joins your network and has a field day spam-
ming other members. He also creates a new group that you find objectionable. 
Banning the member will hide him from view and remove all his contributions 
to the network. However, the group he created doesn’t disappear from the 
network. If you want the group to be removed, you need to delete it separately 
from banning the member.
Here’s a great option available to the Network Creator and Administrators: 
You can feature groups by clicking the Feature link under Admin Options. 
This results in the group appearing under the Featured Groups heading on 
the Groups page, as shown in Figure 12-18.

196
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
You can control how many groups get displayed in the Groups box on 
the main page: You can display 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, or 20 groups at a time. 
Besides featured groups, on the Groups box on the main page, you can show 
the Most Recent groups, groups with the Most Members, and groups with the 
Latest Activity. All these options are available through the From drop-down 
list, as shown in Figure 12-19.
 
My advice to you is to let your members get creative with groups. Give them the 
ability to create groups. If things get out of control, you have group approval 
as an option. The nice thing is you can always go back and change things on 
the network, but after you kill your members’ creativity by locking all doors to 
group creation, it’s harder to get them excited about starting new groups.

 Chapter 12: Managing Multimedia, Groups, and Events
Events in Your Network
Events are a fabulous way for your members to connect with one another. 
They can connect online (through chat sessions, for example) or offline (by 
meeting up with other members).
Like the other features discussed in this chapter, the Events feature needs 
to be added to the network before members can create events. I won’t go 
through this again, You know the drill: Manage➪Features➪Events➪drag and 
drop➪Save! That’s one of the things I love most about Ning: It’s easy to use,
and it’s consistent across the network.
By default, members are allowed to create events once you add the Events 
feature. If, for some reason, you want to be the only one (along with your 
Administrators) to be able to add events, click Manage and then click Feature 
Controls. On the Feature Controls page, deselect the Allow Members to 
Create Events check box (shown in Figure 12-14, earlier in this chapter), and 
then click the Save button at the bottom.
Managing events
Each event has the following admin options available, as shown in Figure 12-20:
 
✓ Feature: You can feature the event, just like you can feature other items 
in your network. Clicking the Feature link displays the event at the top 
of the Events page, below the Featured Events heading. Also, featured 
events appear on the main page if you choose to display featured events 
in the Events box.
 
✓ Edit Event Type: As the Network Creator or an Administrator, you can 
edit the event type, which is equivalent to editing the tags or keywords 
associated with an event. This helps add descriptors such as party, con-
ference, and chat to events. When you click the Edit Event Type link, a 
panel opens below it, where you can add or edit keywords. When you’re 
done, click the Save button below the panel.
 
✓ Delete Event: If you click the Delete Event link, you get a confirmation 
message asking whether you’re sure that you want to delete this event. 
If you agree to do so, the event is removed from the network altogether.

Events on the main page
The Events box on the main page give you three options to manage how 
events get displayed, as you can see in Figure 12-21:
 
✓ Display: This drop-down list lets you choose among the following 
options:
 
• List View: Choosing this option displays events in the Events box, 
as shown in Figure 12-22, including the event’s icon, name, date, 
and time.
 
• Calendar: Choosing this option displays a calendar in the event box 
with the current month. You can navigate back and forth by click-
ing the Last Month and Next Month links. Next to the calendar, the 
same information that the List View shows is included, except for 
the event icons. You can see what the Calendar option looks like in 
Figure 12-22.
 
• Detail View: Figure 12-23 shows how the Detail View appears in the 
Events box on the main page. It has the same information as the 
List View, plus a little bit of detail from the event’s description. 
You also see who the organizer is and larger icons.
 
✓ From: This drop-down list lets you choose between Upcoming Events 
and Featured Events.
 
✓ Show: This drop-down list lets you choose how many events to display: 
0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10.

Enlisting Help to Manage 
the Network
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing what an Administrator cannot do
▶ Understanding what an Administrator can do
▶ Promoting members to Administrators
▶ Managing Administrators
▶ Checking out the multiple levels of Administrators
I
 sometimes remember a commercial from a few years ago. The people 
who were opening an online store finished setting it up and sat back to 
watch the orders come in. As they saw the first customers checking out, they 
clapped in joy, but in the next moments they couldn’t hide their fear as they 
saw thousands of orders starting to pour in. They clearly were not ready to 
handle the load.
Should your network ever run into this kind of trouble (not with orders but 
with new members pouring in), at least you can prepare yourself by recruit-
ing Administrators.
This chapter deals with what Administrators can and cannot do, how to pro-
mote members to Administrators, and how to manage their contributions. 
Last, you discover how to create multiple levels of Administrators and assign 
smaller and specific responsibilities to different members in the network.

202
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
Discovering What Administrators 
Cannot Do
Administrators can do almost everything the Network Creator can do. The 
key word here is almost. To help you visualize how far that almost goes, take 
a look at the Manage page that an Administrator gets on Figure 13-1. Now 
take a look at the Manage page that the Network Creator gets on Figure 13-2. 
You can spot some pretty obvious differences.
 
Figure 13-1: 
Admini-
strators get 
only some of 
the permis-
sions that 
a Network 
Creator has.
 
 
Figure 13-2: 
The 
Network 
Creator is 
the only 
one with 
complete 
control over 
the network.
 

203
 Chapter 13: Enlisting Help to Manage the Network
To ease any concerns you may have about giving away control over matters 
in your network, let me tell you what Administrators cannot do before I tell 
you about anything else. The differences between an Administrator’s Manage 
page and that of a Network Creator are
 
✓ Administrators cannot change the network information. Network infor-
mation includes the name, tagline, and description of the network, along 
with the network keywords, language, time zone, network icon, default 
profile photo and favicon (the small icon that appears in the browser, 
next to your a Web site’s address). Most of these options are filled 
during the initial setup of the network. 
 
✓ Administrators cannot modify the analytics code for the network. How 
the Network Creator can add or modify this code and why this is impor-
tant are discussed in great detail in Chapter 16.
 
✓ Administrators cannot add or remove premium services. This matter 
is critical because premium services are the only elements in a network 
on Ning that you pay for (if you use them). I discuss premium services in 
Chapter 18.
 
✓ Administrators cannot modify the network privacy. This involves 
switching the network to public or private and the variations on these 
two themes that are covered in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Administrators cannot alter feature controls. Feature controls include 
control over what can be changed on profile pages, which you can read 
about in Chapter 10. Feature controls also let you manage your members’ 
events, groups, photos, videos, and music, as explained in Chapter 12.
 
✓ Administrators cannot take the network offline. When the network is 
offline, only the Network Creator can view it. The rest of the members, 
including the Administrators, get a screen like the one shown in 
Figure 13-3.
 
Figure 13-3: 
This is the 
message 
everyone 
besides the 
Network 
Creator gets 
when a 
network 
is offline.
 

204
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
 
✓ Administrators cannot delete the network. I should not have been 
mean, leaving this one for last. You can sleep peacefully! If you ever 
experience an Administrator uprising, your Administrators aren’t going 
to be able to delete the network.
In addition to the differences in the Manage page, Administrators cannot des-
ignate additional Administrators. This gives you an extra level of control.
Finding out What an Administrator 
CAN Do
As your network grows, as long as you choose the right people to be 
Administrators, you’ll be thankful for having them there, as they become 
your right-hand helpers.
Given the extent of the things they can do, it isn’t practical for me to name 
them all, but some of the most important ways in which Administrators can 
help you are
 
✓ Featuring members and their contributions: With a large network, 
Administrators can help you feature members and their contributions 
worth highlighting. This is discussed in Chapters 11 and 12.
 
✓ Moderating and banning members: Administrators can help you main-
tain the network clean of trolls, spammers, and other ugly online crea-
tures. You can read more about the moderating and banning process in 
Chapter 10.
 
✓ Moderating discussion topics: If things get heated in a discussion in 
the forum, administrators can close it or remove it altogether if needed. 
I include plenty of detail on how to manage things in the forum in 
Chapter 11.
 
✓ Managing chat sessions: Another great task for your Administrators to 
help you with is managing chat sessions in the network. Chat manage-
ment is dealt with in Chapter 11.
 
✓ Moderating new content and new groups: If you’ve set up your network 
to approve new photos, new videos, or new groups before they appear, 
Administrators can help you with the moderation. I explain the process 
of moderating photos, videos, and groups in Chapter 12.
This list is by no means exhaustive, but it gives you some ideas of the kinds 
of areas where enlisting the help of Administrators can be a blessing!

205
 Chapter 13: Enlisting Help to Manage the Network
Promoting Members to Administrators
In the preceding sections, I identify what Administrators can and cannot do 
to convince you of the value of having Administrators by your side. If I’ve 
been successful, your next task is to identify potential candidates, talk to 
them, and promote them to Administrators.
 
Potential candidates should be fairly easy to spot because they stand out: 
These are the members who participate regularly in the network; the people 
who contribute thoughtful comments in the forum; and above all, the ones 
who take the time to answer the questions from other members. Another way 
to spot them is by looking at members who have lots of friends and write on 
the Comment Walls of others, saying hi, welcome, and so on.
After you’ve identified a few of these folks, contact them and ask them 
whether they’d be interested in becoming Administrators. Be sure to clearly 
explain what you would expect from them as Administrators. If they’re okay 
with doing it, all you have to do for them to take action is to promote them. 
The process to promote a member to Administrator is detailed in Chapter 10.
Managing Administrators
Promoting members to Administrators is only the beginning of your interac-
tion with your Administrators. You have to give the people you empower 
with Administrator privileges the necessary training to make sure they fully 
understand the implications of their actions and how to do all the things you 
expect them to do.
 
In case you didn’t think of it, one good thing you can do to train your 
Administrators is to get them a copy of this book.
Splitting up the task load
After your Administrators are trained, it’s important to work as a team in the 
Administration tasks. Because every Administrator in the network can do the 
same things in the network doesn’t mean they should — that’s where you, as 
the Network Creator, step in. It doesn’t matter how you split the work:

206
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
 
✓ If your Administrators live in different time zones, you could designate 
them to cover the network at different times.
 
✓ You could split the network into features and assign different features to 
different Administrators.
The important thing is that all Administrators know what they’re supposed to 
do, so that tasks don’t fall through the cracks.
Communicating with Administrators
Another important consideration when having Administrators on your net-
work is to ensure good communication among all of them.
Because most, if not all, Administrators will not be sitting next to each other, 
I recommend that they use online tools to manage communications. Notice I 
don’t say e-mail, because e-mail is one of the worst tools to ensure that orga-
nized communication takes place among a group of team members working 
from different locations.
A few options you may want to consider are
 
✓ Adding a private group within your own network: This would be like 
eating your own dog food. Members can message all members of the 
group (your Administrators) when something relevant needs to be com-
municated to the entire team.
 
✓ Starting a separate network on Ning: You can take advantage of the 
entire feature set that Ning makes available to you. There’s no need to 
be constrained to the limitations that a group imposes.
 
✓ Setting up a Google Group: This is a pretty good and free solution that 
gives you most of the tools you and your Administrators may need to 
stay in touch with one another and document decisions made, members 
banned, and so on.
 
✓ Creating a Basecamp account: Basecamp is my favorite project com-
munication management tool. Up to a certain number of users, it’s a free 
solution, too. If you need to have a very large number of Administrators 
accessing Basecamp, there are different price plans available. You can 
set up a Basecamp account at www.basecamphq.com.
Whether you use smoke signals or the latest in Web-enabled technology, 
the key is to make sure there are clear rules on who is supposed to do what 
and that decisions get shared with the people in the team who may need to 
know about them. This clear communication not only results in informed and 
happy Administrators, but also reflects positively on the network and posi-
tively impacts the member experience.

207
 Chapter 13: Enlisting Help to Manage the Network
Understanding the Multiple 
Levels of Administrators
Your members can help you manage your network without your giving them 
full Administrative rights to the network. Click the Manage link in your navi-
gation and then click the Members link below the Your Members heading. On 
the Manage Members page that appears, click the Manage Roles link.
The Manage Roles section lets you add new roles, specific to certain tasks, 
so you can assign them to your members, as shown in Figure 13-4. In the 
figure, you can see that I’ve created three roles: Events Moderator, Photos 
Moderator, and Videos Moderator.
 
Figure 13-4: 
You can 
give your 
members 
very spe-
cific roles 
so they can 
help you.
 
If you want to remove an existing role, click the small x next to the role you 
want to delete. If you want to add a new role, click the Add a Role link, which 
takes you to the Add a Role page, as shown in Figure 13-5.
 
Figure 13-5: 
The Add a 
Role page 
lets you 
define how 
much you 
want a 
member to 
be able to 
manage.
 

208
Part III: Creating and Managing Your Own Social Network 
To create a new role, you need to enter the following information:
 
✓ Role Name: Try to give the role an intuitive name, such as Photo 
Moderator or Forum Moderator. This role gets displayed on the Manage 
Members page, in the same place where you (as the Network Creator) 
see Network Creator.
 
✓ Features: Beside each feature that can be managed in the network, you 
find a check box. Select the check box (or check boxes) next to the 
feature(s) you want the role to have administrative rights over.
 
✓ Content Items: If you click the Add a Content Item link, a window comes 
up, prompting you for the URL of a specific discussion, forum category, 
video, photo, note, event, page, or group for this role to administer. This 
option becomes very useful when you have a topic that is particularly 
popular, has gotten many comments, or is particularly controversial and 
you could use a few more eyes to keep tabs on it.
 
✓ Role Members: After you’ve assigned this role to members in your 
community, they’re listed here.
 
After you’ve added a role, you assign it to members through the Manage 
Members page. To get to the Manage Members page, click the Manage link 
in your network’s navigation and click the Manage Members option. On the 
Manage Members page, just click the check box next to the member you want 
to give the role to and pick the role you want to assign from the Actions drop-
down list, and you’re done!
When you’re done entering the details about the role, click the Save button 
to add the new role to the list of roles shown when you first click the Manage 
Roles link on the Manage Members page. You can have as many members 
assigned to a role as you need, and you can create as many as 20 roles on 
your network.
It’s important for you to realize that when you give a member permis-
sion to manage a feature, the member gets the same permissions that an 
Administrator would get. For example, if you create a Blog Moderator role 
and click the check box next to Blog while adding the role, any members you 
assign to that role are able to moderate blog posts before they’re posted, fea-
ture blog posts, add or delete blog comments, add or edit tags on a blog post, 
and remove blog posts.
I hope that you’re okay with relinquishing that much control. If not, and if 
your network starts growing a lot, you’re going to have a lot of work on your 
hands.

Part IV
Promoting Your 
Network

In this part . . .
U
ntil you promote your network, no matter how 
much it rocks, it’s just sitting there. You need to tell 
others about it so you can grow your membership.
This part is devoted to showing you how you can spread 
the word about your network to get more people inter-
ested in it. I also discuss the use of tools to help you learn 
from your members and what they do, so you can make 
the network experience better for them. Last, I share 
some tips on how to keep your members coming back . . . 
because, at the end of the day, isn’t that what you want?

Chapter 14
Inviting Others to the Network
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding what makes spam spammy
▶ Inviting people to your network
▶ Letting your members send invitations
S
o your network now shines with features on your main page, looking 
sharp with the changes you made to a theme to give it a unique person-
ality. You’ve posted a few videos and photos, started some discussion topics, 
posted entries on your blog, and added a handful of events and groups to get 
the ball rolling. Still, the main ingredient in your network is missing: mem-
bers. It’s time to invite members to your network!
This chapter deals with invitations: sending them out, resending them, 
cancelling them, and letting your members invite others to your network.
Discovering How NOT to Be a Spammer
Maybe you wouldn’t think of yourself as a spammer (and most likely you 
aren’t). But that doesn’t mean you’re incapable of spammy behavior . . . 
even by accident. So here are a few thoughts to protect you from the conse-
quences of spamming people with invitations to your network.
 
What is spam e-mail? At its core, spam e-mail is basically unsolicited e-mail 
sent in bulk. Most of the time, e-mail systems are trained to recognize the 
majority of spam messages: They typically get thrown into the deep dungeons 
of your Junk Mail folder.
Normally spam is sent with a commercial intent, but that doesn’t mean it’s 
okay for someone with noncommercial motivations to send unsolicited 
e-mail. To deal with spam, the United States has legislation such as the CAN-
SPAM Act of 2003, which can get you in trouble for sending lots of unsolicited 
messages.

212
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
Because network invitations are sent via e-mail, if abused, they’re just as 
prone to be judged as spam messages just like those that promote enlarge-
ment of body parts or 0 percent debt refinancing.
 
Keep in mind that when you sign up for an account on Ning and when you 
create a network on Ning, you agree to the Ning Terms of Service. Among 
other things, in the Terms of Service is a prohibition from engaging in spam as 
defined and covered by the CAN-SPAM Act and other laws that deal with unso-
licited commercial email.
The bottom line is this: If you violate this rule, your account may be terminated, 
and you could get yourself into legal trouble. Not worth it, don’t you think?
 
Now that you’ve been warned, consider these two tips to help you adhere to 
the Ning Terms of Service:
 
✓ Avoid sending tons of invitations all at once. Even if you’re the most 
popular person on earth, typically this is a big red flag that spells out 
s-p-a-m!
 
✓ Try to send invitations only to people you know. At the very least, 
send invitations only to the people you know are interested in the topic 
of your network.
It’s not too hard, don’t you think? Well, now that you know what not to do, 
you can go to the next section and take a look at how to invite people to your 
network.
Inviting People to Your Network
Inviting people to join your network starts with clicking the Invite link on 
your navigation. When you click it, you’re presented with the following 
options, as shown in Figure 14-1:
 
✓ Import from Web Address Book: When you click this option, you can 
pull all the e-mail addresses you have in your Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, 
Gmail, or AOL Mail account to conveniently invite them. Enter your 
e-mail address and password and then click the Import Address Book 
button, as shown in Figure 14-2.
 
 After your address book is imported, you can choose among all your 
imported contacts by selecting the check boxes next to those you want 
to invite, as shown in Figure 14-3. If you have too many contacts, you can 

213
 Chapter 14: Inviting Others to the Network
use the search box at the top of the page to find a specific one. When 
you’ve selected the contacts you want to invite, click the Invite button 
to send the invitations.
 
✓ Enter Email Addresses: Clicking this option lets you enter multiple 
e-mail addresses separated by commas and an optional message for 
them. After you’ve entered the addresses and the message, click the 
Send Invitations button, as shown in Figure 14-4.
 
✓ Invite Friends: This option is shown only if you have friends on other 
networks on Ning. Your list of friends shows up in a similar way to the 
contacts from your Web address book, letting you select or deselect 
check boxes next to them. You can also send an optional message to 
them. When you’re ready to do so, click the Send Invitations button, and 
you can connect with your friends from other networks in the network 
you’ve created.
 
✓ Import from Address Book Application: Programs that let you store 
contact information, such as Microsoft Outlook and Apple Address Book, 
let you export your contacts in a format called CSV (comma-separated 
values). Your contact information is stored in a format called VCF (vCard 
file).
 
 This option to invite people to your network lets you import your con-
tacts from these kinds of programs. You can upload a .csv or a .vcf 
file, as shown in Figure 14-5, and subsequently invite contacts from the 
following page, which looks just like Figure 14-2, shown earlier in this 
chapter.

Resending and Cancelling Invitations
There is a chance recipients of your invitations may have misplaced them 
in their e-mail inbox. You can resend invitations to your network by clicking 
the Manage link in your network’s navigation and then clicking the Manage 
Members option. On the Manage Members page, click the Invited tab, as 
shown in Figure 14-6.
This page shows the names and e-mail addresses of people invited to your 
network, as well as who invited them and the date they were invited. To 
resend an invitation, select the check box next to the person you want to 
invite again and select the Resend Invitation option from the Actions drop-
down list.
The Invited tab of the Manage Members page also lets you cancel invitations. 
To cancel an invitation, follow the same steps mentioned above and select 
the Cancel Invitation option from the Actions drop-down list.

Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
Allowing Your Members 
to Send Invitations
After someone has joined your network, she can send invitations out to 
others: This is, after all, one of the “viral” features your network offers to help 
you spread the word about your network. (I talk more on this in Chapter 15, 
which deals with promoting your network.)
 
If you need to control who joins your network, you can do this by approving 
new members before they join. This is the ultimate level of control you can 
have over who can be invited to and ultimately join your network. You can 
turn on the optional feature to approve new members before they can join. 
Chapter 10 covers moderating members.
If you need to control who joins your network, you can do this by approving

I
nviting people and having your members invite other people is certainly 
one of the key ways that you can promote your network. There’s a phrase 
for learning about something you may be interested in from someone you 
trust: It’s called “word of mouth.”
However, networks on Ning give you many ways in which you (and your 
members) can further promote your network. This chapter is dedicated to 
exploring these options. Also, I let you know about a few things you can do 
outside your network to help bring more people to it. So buckle up and get 
ready to let the world know about your network!
Spreading the Word with 
Badges and Widgets
Networks on Ning offer you badges and widgets that you can have your mem-
bers embed in other sites to help you promote the network.
Badges let your members show their network pride outside the network: 
They show that the member belongs to your network, turning into a very 
valuable endorsement. Widgets, in turn, offer a good means of disseminating 
multimedia network content virally.

218
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
Getting badges and widgets
You need to make sure the Get Badges feature is available from the main 
page first. To do so, click the Manage link in your navigation and then click 
the Features link.
On the Add Features to Your Network page, if the Get Badges feature is not 
already included in your main page layout, drag it from the Features list 
on the left, drop it where you would like it to appear on the main page (see 
Figure 15-1), and click the Save button.

feature lets 
members 
obtain 
badges and 
widgets.
 
Drag the feature to where you want it to appear.
Your members can obtain many different types of badges and widgets by 
clicking the Get More Badges link on the network’s main page, below the 
sample badge. This takes you to the Badges & Widgets page.
 
✓ Member Badge: This is a small badge with the default message “I am a 
member of:” followed by the network’s name or logo image. (The logo 
is available only if you’ve uploaded one, following the instructions in 
Chapter 8.) The member adding the badge can change the message 
to anything else by typing it in the Custom Text text box, as shown in 
Figure 15-2.
 
✓ Network Badge (Large): This badge shows the profile images for 16 of 
your members. The images of the members shown in Figure 15-2 get 
updated dynamically, reflecting the network’s most popular members.

 Chapter 15: Promoting Your Network
 
✓ Network Badge (Small): This smaller version of the network badge 
shows no member images. It gives your members the opportunity to 
embed a more discreet badge while still helping you promote the net-
work. You can see what it looks like in Figure 15-3.
 
✓ Photo Slideshow widget: The Photo Slideshow is a very convenient 
widget for members to be able to embed elsewhere. Members can cus-
tomize the player in two ways, as shown in Figure 15-3:
 
• Select Source: This drop-down list gives you the option to show My 
Most Recent (which pulls from your most recent photos), From 
This Network (which pulls from everyone’s photos), or My Albums 
(which lets you pick from the albums you’ve created in the network, 
if any).
 
• Player Size: This drop-down list lets you choose Small: 160 pixels 
wide; Medium: 300 pixels wide; or Large: 425 pixels wide, so you 
can pick the slideshow size that suits the space you have available 
to embed it.
 
✓ Music Player widget: The Music Player also gives members a few 
options to customize it, as shown in Figure 15-4:
 
• Select Source: In a similar way to how the Music Player can be 
customized by the Network Creator or the Administrators for the 
main page, this drop-down list lets members pick among Network 
Playlist, Most Recent, Featured, Highest Rated, and My Playlist.
 
• Player Size: This drop-down list lets you choose Small: 160 pixels 
wide; Medium: 300 pixels wide; or Large: 425 pixels wide, so you can 
tailor the embedded Music Player to the space you have available.
 
• Show Playlist: Selecting this check box displays the playlist on the 
embedded Music Player. Deselecting it hides the music tracks and 
leaves only the controls.
 
✓ Video Player widget: The last widget available to members is the Video 
Player. Its Select Source drop-down list offers you the following options: 
Most Recent, Highest Rated, and Featured for all the videos in the net-
work; and Most Recent and Highest Rated for the videos you have sub-
mitted (grouped under My Videos).
All badges, the Music Player, and the Video Player can be added to MySpace, 
Facebook, and other sites. You can accomplish this by clicking the links 
labeled Add to MySpace, Share on Facebook, and Add to Other. Also, the 
HTML Embed Code text box offers you the HTML code that you can copy and 
paste as needed. These options are shown in Figure 15-2, earlier in this chap-
ter. You can share the Photo Slideshow, Video Player, and Music Player on 
Facebook (by clicking the Share on Facebook link), or you can embed them 
by using the code in the HTML Embed Code text box.

Customizing badges and players
Network Creators and Administrators can spice up badges and players to make 
them stand out even more. You can customize them in one of three ways:
 
✓ Click the Customize link below any of the badges or widgets.
 
✓ Click the Customize tab at the top of the Badges & Widgets page.
 
✓ Click the Badges & Widgets link in the Spread the Word section of the 
Manage page.
When you follow any of these paths, you land on a page that lets you custom-
ize the background image, color, and branding for the badges and widgets. 
You can see this page in Figure 15-5.
The controls for changing background image and color work just like the 
ones explained in Chapter 8 for modifying the header, footer, and sides. 
These changes affect all badges and widgets.
You can also change the network branding for badges and widgets sepa-
rately. You can change the branding of the network badges in two ways:
 
✓ Network Name: You can modify the color of the strip behind the net-
work name on the badge by clicking the colored icon below Network 
Name and proceeding as you would to change the background color.
 
✓ Logo Image: You can also add a logo image much like you can for your 
network header, as explained in Chapter 8.
Branding for widgets can also be modified. You have the following options 
available below the Network Branding: Widgets header (to select one of 
them, just click the circle next to it):

222
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
 
✓ Don’t Display Any Branding: You can opt to display no branding what-
soever, which results in the display of just the content (photos, videos, 
or music playlists). This option may be appropriate in a handful of 
cases, but in general I recommend against it because it does away with a 
very simple opportunity to promote your network.
 
✓ Network Name: This option shows your network’s name visibly on any 
widgets embedded in other Web sites. Although this is better than no 
branding at all in most cases, if you have a watermark or logo available 
(as in the case where you’ve added a logo to your network’s header), 
you should apply it to your widgets.
 
✓ Watermark or Logo Image: If you choose this option, your widgets show 
the watermark or logo that you upload by following the same steps you 
would take to add a logo to your network’s header. This is by far the 
best of all three options if you have a nice design available for your logo.
 
I know I’ve said this enough already, but just in case, I’ll take one more oppor-
tunity to stress it: If you can afford it, make sure to get a nice design for your 
network’s logo. As you now know, it not only helps your network’s header 
stand out, but also helps your network’s widgets shine.
 
Figure 15-5: 
You can 
custom-
ize your 
network’s 
badges and 
widgets.
 

223
 Chapter 15: Promoting Your Network
After you make any changes, you can see on the right side of the page how 
they look by selecting the right badge (Member Badge, Large Network Badge, 
and Small Network Badge) or widget (Video Player, Photo Slideshow, and 
Music Player) from the respective drop-down list and clicking the Refresh link.
When the badges and widgets are looking the way you want them, click the 
Save button at the bottom of the page.
Syndicating Your Network’s Content
In Chapter 9, I discuss what RSS is and explain how you can add RSS feeds 
from other sites to your network’s main page. (Your members can also add 
RSS feeds to their profile pages.) It turns out that your network gives you lots 
of ways to use RSS feeds to syndicate content you and your members con-
tribute to the network.
If the titles of the items in your network’s RSS feeds are informative and com-
pelling enough, people visiting other Web sites that display your network’s 
RSS feed may click the titles and end up visiting your network.
 
In case you’re wondering what “informative and compelling” titles means, it’s 
another way of saying search engine–friendly (or SEO-friendly, as it may be 
called too). Entire books are devoted to this topic, but the key concept is to 
make sure the titles of all content you and your Administrators create (and as 
much of the content created by your members) are informative, compelling, 
and concise:
 
✓ Informative means that the title gives enough information about the 
post or topic dealt with. “Cool idea!” is a very good example of a poor 
title, for instance.
 
✓ Compelling means that the title invites the reader to click it. A compel-
ling title is as important for your network as it is for content syndicated 
outside it. “Ten ways to make your network succeed” is a good example 
of a compelling title.
 
✓ Concise means that the title is neither too long nor too short, but just 
long enough to give enough information to get the reader to click it.

224
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
Some of the most popular RSS feeds from your network that you can add 
elsewhere are
 
✓ Everyone’s blog posts: If you click the Blogs link in your navigation, the 
page you get to contains the title and first few lines of every blog post 
made by members of your community. This is a great candidate for 
syndication because many of your members are bound to write original 
content on their blogs on your network.
 
✓ Discussion forum posts: Over time, as more and more topics are started 
and discussed, the discussion forum becomes a hub of activity, and that 
makes it a great source of content for other sites to carry.
 
✓ Group discussions: Every single group on your network with discussion 
forums on it has an RSS feed associated with it. In the case of particu-
larly busy groups, these feeds can offer valuable content to syndicate 
through other Web sites.
 
✓ Recent public photos and latest videos: Depending on the level of adop-
tion by your members, the Photos and Videos section of your network 
can also be great sources of material to syndicate elsewhere through the 
RSS feeds they offer.
To obtain the RSS feed for a particular page on your network, keep your eyes 
open for the famous orange RSS icon. In most cases, if a page on Ning has one 
or more RSS feeds associated with it, the RSS icon is found at the bottom of 
the page. When you spot it, click the icon and copy the URL from your brows-
er’s navigation bar.
How you can syndicate the content carried by that RSS feed on another site 
depends largely on the way the other site handles feeds, and that varies from 
site to site. I trust that you know your way around this kind of stuff for the 
site where you want your network’s content to be showcased, so I won’t go 
into further detail here.
Sending Messages to All Members
Just because you can do something doesn’t mean that you should do it willy-
nilly. A good network-related example of this is the ability for you and your 

225
 Chapter 15: Promoting Your Network
Administrators to send messages to all members. At least, don’t do it too 
often: As a general guideline, I would say one message to all your members 
once a week may be close to too much.
 
Why do I caution you against sending too many messages to all members? Try 
to put yourself in their shoes. You get hundreds of e-mails per week, some 
relevant but too many of them trying to break through the noise to get your 
attention. Chances are good that you ignore a few of the messages you get, 
delete others, and then mark some more as junk. You read only a handful of 
e-mails: the ones that you care about, whose senders you trust.
Your goal as a Network Creator is to get your messages to make it into that 
select group of senders and stay there. If you start sending a message to all 
members every day, you stand an excellent chance of ending up just talking 
to yourself.
So how do you send messages to all members in your network? You have two 
ways: Send a broadcast message or share an item. I discuss both ways in the 
following sections.
Sending a broadcast message
To send a broadcast message, click the Manage link in your navigation and 
click the Broadcast Message link under the Spread the Word header. This 
opens a window that lets you enter a subject and the body of your message.
For now, you can create only text-based messages. Take a look at Figure 15-6, 
where you can see what the Broadcast Message window looks like. When 
you’re done composing your message, all you need to do is click the Send 
button, and off it goes to all your members.
 
Figure 15-6: 
The 
Broadcast 
functional-
ity lets you 
easily com-
municate 
with all 
members.
 

226
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
Sharing items with all members
You can share any item on the network with all members. All discussion 
topics, blog posts, photos, videos, and other items on your network give 
members the option to share them with others. To share something, click the 
Share link below any content item. This link takes you to a page similar to the 
one shown in Figure 15-7.
 
Figure 15-7: 
The Share 
page lets 
members 
conveniently 
share con-
tent items 
with others.
 
If the Share page reminds you of the Invite page, that’s because they look 
very similar. (I cover the Invite page in Chapter 14.) Members can share con-
tent items with others by manually entering their e-mail addresses, by select-
ing from their list of friends, by importing addresses from a Web address 
book, or by importing addresses from an address book application.
The Network Creator and the Administrators have one more option available: 
You can share items with all members in the network. When you click the 
Share with All Members link, you can optionally include a message or simply 
click the Send Message button to have all members be notified about the 
page you want them to visit.

227
 Chapter 15: Promoting Your Network
Other Ways to Promote Your Network
All the methods discussed so far in this chapter are centered on your network. 
They take advantage of the tools that Ning gives you natively to promote your 
network by yourself and with the help of your members and others.
This section is dedicated to other mechanisms you can take advantage of to 
get the word out about your network. The following list should give you a few 
ideas:
 
✓ Leave comments for others. Your target members are out there, and they 
aren’t too hard to find if you have the patience (and the respect) neces-
sary. Millions of blogs, videos, and photos are posted by people that you 
could leave comments on, letting them know about your network.
 
 What’s the key to having people respond positively and at least visit 
your network? Offer something valuable: If the blog post is asking a 
question, give an answer; if the photo or the video invite people to think, 
be thoughtful in your remarks — don’t just leave a plain invitation for 
people to join your network.
 
 Also, always be respectful of the context of the place where you’re leav-
ing a comment. Leaving comments hither and thither without care will 
backfire and earn you a well-deserved spammer reputation.
 
✓ Engage others through Twitter. Twitter is one of my favorite sites. Not 
surprisingly, both of my networks (TuDiabetes and EsTuDiabetes) have 
a Twitter page, which people can follow to be periodically notified of 
content that has been posted in them.
 
 I highly recommend you look into ways to automate this process, 
through the use of tools like Twitterfeed, which requires you only to 
give it one or more RSS feeds to syndicate (something that this chapter 
has already dealt with for your network). You also get the chance to 
state how often you want each of your feeds to be published on Twitter.
 
✓ Share through other networks. Sites like Digg, StumbleUpon, and del.
icio.us are rich repositories of content submitted by their members. 
Submitting pages from your network to these types of sites is another 
great way for other people outside your network to become aware of 
it. In general, it’s best to do this only with pages that you feel may have 
particular value to others, based on analytics data (more on this in 
Chapter 16).
 
 A slightly hidden feature that all pages on your network offer is the 
Share This Page option found in the Quick Add drop-down list below 
your name. When you select the Share This Page option, a window like 
the one shown in Figure 15-8 appears, letting you share the page on 
MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, StumbleUpon, del.icio.us, and Digg.

228
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
 
✓ Offline is the new online. If you sit back and think of the ways people 
find out about things, you’ll realize that many people still pick up flyers 
and read bulletin boards. Keep in mind that it’s important that you focus 
your offline efforts on people who are likely to join your network, but at 
the same time, don’t underestimate the power of these tried-and-true 
methods to spread the word about your network. If your network deals 
with chess, for example, giving out flyers to members of local chess 
clubs could be a great idea.
 
✓ Tell everyone. Telling people about your network means things like 
including your network’s URL in your e-mail signature and business 
cards.
 
✓ Offer value. Above everything else, focus obsessively on offering value. 
Members gravitate around a network they find valuable, and they 
become your biggest advocates if you ensure them a rich and valuable 
experience.

Using Google Analytics to Learn 
More about Your Network
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering your network’s Web analytics
▶ Setting up Google Analytics
▶ Finding out how Google Analytics can be useful
R
emember the days before Google? There were such days . . . just like 
there was life before the Internet and the cell phone. It just seems diffi-
cult to imagine life without Google lately, so it’s no surprise that the best way 
to obtain free Web analytics data comes to you courtesy of Google. It’s called 
Google Analytics.
Google Analytics is not the only Web analytics solution available. However, 
not only is it free (which is a very important plus), but it also gives you most 
of the information you can expect from a Web analytics package with minimal 
work on your part, and it presents the information in a very intuitive way. This 
is why I keep going back to it to track Web analytics of every Web site I run.
In this chapter, I’m not going to dwell on how Google Analytics works in 
detail or try to turn you into an expert on Web analytics: You can find some 
great books on both topics, including Web Analytics For Dummies, by Pedro 
Sostre and Jennifer LeClaire (Wiley Publishing, Inc.). My goal is to get you 
to see the importance of setting up Google Analytics so that it can help you 
learn as much as you can about your network.

Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
Understanding Your Network’s 
Web Analytics
Web analytics sounds like a very technical and statistics-loaded term. I’m not 
going to lie to you: There’s a bit of depth to analytics, but at the same time 
it’s one of those things you simply cannot afford to ignore. Web analytics give 
you the information you need to make the best possible decisions about your 
network.
Some of the things you can find out through Web analytics are
 
✓ How many visitors come to your network: If you set up your network as 
public, this is the combination of your members and outside people who 
may just be lurking.
 
✓ How long visits to the network last on average: Knowing the length 
of typical visits is important because you need to consider the average 
attention span of your visitors when creating original content.
 
✓ Where your network’s visitors are coming from: Knowing where your 
traffic is originating is very important. You can forge valuable alliances 
with your top traffic sources.
In short, Web analytics give you an x-ray of what’s going on in your network. 
Web analytics are solid facts, which is more useful than depending on any 
hunch you may have or simply looking at the number of members.
With the data you gather from looking at your Web analytics, you may con-
firm that you’re doing a great job: If so, pat yourself in the back. If you find 
you can improve things, you can go back and adjust things as discussed in 
Chapters 8 to 13, keeping in mind what aspects of your network specifically 
need help.
Setting Up Google Analytics
Let me show you how set up Google Analytics in your network. Here’s what 
you need to do:
 
1. If you don’t already have one, set up a Google account at www.
google.com/accounts/NewAccount.
 
2. Sign up for Google Analytics.
 
 You can do this at www.google.com/analytics by clicking the Sign 
Up button.

231
 Chapter 16: Using Google Analytics to Learn More about Your Network
 
 The next page you’re taken to prompts you for details about your net-
work, as you can see in Figure 16-1:
 
• Website’s URL: In this field, enter your network address without the 
http:// portion.
 
• Account Name: This name is visible only to you, but it’s useful to 
enter a meaningful name in case you start tracking analytics for 
multiple networks in the future.
 
• Time Zone Country or Territory: This is your country.
 
• Time Zone: Easy enough: your time zone.
 
Figure 16-1: 
The General 
Information 
page is the 
first step

3. Click the Continue button.
 
 You’re taken to a page where you are prompted for your contact infor-
mation: last and first name, phone number, and country or territory.
 
4. Fill out your contact information and click the Continue button.
 
 You land on the Google Analytics Terms of Service page (one of those 
pages you’ve seen a million times). If you want to use Google Analytics, 
you have no option but to agree to Google’s terms and conditions.
 
5. Click the Create New Account button, and you’re almost there.
 
 The page you’re taken to includes the tracking code, as shown in 
Figure 16-2. Select all the code inside the tracking code window and copy 
it. (To copy, right-click with your mouse and select the Copy option.)
 
6. Go to your network and click the Manage link in the top navigation.
 
7. Click the Analytics option under the Your Network header.
 
8. Paste the code in the box shown on the Analytics page, as shown in 
Figure 16-3, and click the Save button.
As you can see, it’s easy to start tracking your network’s traffic data using Google 
Analytics: You only need to know how to copy and paste a little bit of code.

what works and what you need to change.
Putting Google Analytics to Good Use
Whenever you sign in to Google Analytics, you’re presented with the dash-
board, a page that contains the most important pieces of Web analytics infor-
mation summarized visually, as shown in Figure 16-4.

233
 Chapter 16: Using Google Analytics to Learn More about Your Network
 
Figure 16-4: 
The Google 
Analytics 
dashboard 
offers the 
critical 
information 
at a glance.
 
Among the elements shown on the dashboard are the following figures in the 
Site Usage section:
 
✓ Visits: This figure gives you an idea of how many times your network 
was visited during the period for which you are looking at the data.
 
✓ Pageviews: This figure indicates how many pages were viewed in that 
period.
 
 The Pageviews figure is an important metric if you run your own ads 
(which is a premium service discussed in Chapter 18): The more page 
views your network has, the more your members are presented with 
the ads you run. The Pageviews figure is one of the things advertisers 
typically ask when they’re determining whether to advertise on your 
Web site.
 
✓ Pages/Visit: This figure is the ratio of the preceding two numbers. 
(Think of it as “Pages per Visit” rather than “Pages/Visit.”)
 
✓ Bounce Rate: This is a percentage of the visits in which the visitor 
leaves after viewing a single page on the Web site.
 
✓ Avg. Time on Site: This number can be useful for you to have an esti-
mate of your visitors’ attention span. Obviously, the higher this number, 
the better. 

234
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
 
 If you divide the average time on site by the pages per visit, you get an 
idea of how long a visitor spends per page. This data can help you esti-
mate how long a person is typically willing to spend on any given video 
or discussion topic posted on the network.
 
✓ % New Visits: This percentage indicates what percentage of the visits 
are arriving on the site for the first time in the period reported.
Knowing your visitors
Next in the list of pages you can explore in Google Analytics is the Visitors 
Overview page. To get to this page, click the Visitors link in the left naviga-
tion bar. Figure 16-5 gives you a feel for the kind of information that the 
Visitors Overview page offers.
I’ve said this already, but let me say it once more: If your network is set up as 
public, your visitors are not only your members. Your network also gets vis-
ited by folks who may come to it, get what they want, and never come back; 
lurkers who frequent the network but keep postponing signing up; and even 
so-called crawlers, automated scripts that go around Web sites, on search 
engine missions from Google, Yahoo!, and several other sites.
Don’t stop with the Visitors Overview page — the entire Visitors section is 
packed with information about your network’s visitors. This includes how 
many of your visitors are new to your network versus how many of them are 
coming back for more; what language, operating system, and browser they 
use; and even how many times have they visited your network. All these 
options are available through the links under the Visitors link in the left navi-
gation bar.
 
There is a fascinating page in the Visitors section titled Benchmarking. (To 
get to this page, click the Benchmarking link in the left navigation bar.) Before 
you can see it, you need to opt in for it. It’s well worth your while! To enable 
the benchmarking service, choose the option to share your Analytics data 
“Anonymously with Google and the benchmarking service” from the Edit 
Account and Data Sharing Settings page. You can get to this page from the 
page you get to after logging in to Google Analytics.
On the Benchmarking page you’re presented with very useful benchmarking 
information comparing your network with all sites of similar size that have 
use Google Analytics and have opted in as well. You can see how well or not 
so well your network is doing in comparison with comparable sites.

235
 Chapter 16: Using Google Analytics to Learn More about Your Network
Still, one of my favorite pages in the Visitors section is the Map Overlay, 
shown in Figure 16-6. To get to it, click the Map Overlay link in the left naviga-
tion bar. Simply put, this page summarizes the geographical origin of your 
visitors on a world map. You can drill down by clicking each country and 
state, down to the city level, giving you precious information if you need to 
do geographical segmentation of your visitors.

Finding out what sites visitors 
are coming from
Knowing what country, state, and city your visitors come from is useful. 
However, knowing what Web site they were on before they came to your net-
work is perhaps just as useful to know.
In the left navigation bar, click the Traffic Sources link to get to the Traffic 
Sources Overview page, shown in Figure 16-7. This page breaks down visits 
into the following categories:
 
✓ Direct Traffic: People who type the URL to your network directly in their 
browser or click a link that someone sent them via e-mail
 
✓ Referring Sites: People who visited your network from another site, 
where they found a link to it
 
✓ Search Engines: People who visited your network from a search engine
Additionally, besides showing the top traffic sources in visits and percent 
of the total visits, you can view the keywords that visitors typed in a search 
engine, ultimately leading to your network — click the Keywords link in the 
left navigation bar. You need to look at the keyword data on a regular basis 
(once a week is a good frequency) because it gives you priceless insight into 
how your visitors ask questions that your network can answer: This is the 
most inexpensive way of conducting market research!

 Chapter 16: Using Google Analytics to Learn More about Your Network
Popular content on your network
The Content section in Google Analytics helps you discover what contents 
your visitors are checking out most often on your network. If you click the 
Content link in the left navigation bar and then click the Top Content link, 
you get to the Top Content page. This page sorts all the pages in the network 
by page views, as shown in Figure 16-8. You can also sort the top content by 
other criteria, such as Time on Page and % Exit. (The % Exit is the percent-
age of page views that were followed by the visitor leaving the network after 
viewing the page.)
 
Figure 16-8: 
You can 
learn a lot 
about your 
visitors’

from the

page.
 
Among the things you can find out through the Top Content page are
 
✓ Who is the most popular member on the network? Actually, what you 
find out is who’s getting the most visits to his or her profile page. This 
is someone who perhaps should be featured and may be willing to help 
you spread the word about your network. You can find out who this 
member is by doing a search for the word profile in the search box at 
the bottom of the Top Content page.
 
✓ Which forum topics and blog posts are being read and replied to the 
most? By looking at the number of replies to a topic or a post on your 
network, you can learn only about the people who actively partici-
pated in the discussion; you need the analytics data to know how many 
people are actually reading. You can learn about the top forum topics or 
blog posts by searching for forum or blog in the search box on the Top 
Content page.

Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
 
✓ What groups may be worth featuring the most? Sorting groups by Most 
Active in the Groups page gives you an initial reference of the groups 
worth featuring, but the data on Google Analytics helps you further 
refine this information. Searching for group on the Top Content page dis-
plays a list of the most popular group pages in your network.
The list could go on, but you get the idea: The Content section in Google 
Analytics gives you data that you can put to great use.
Tracking new members signing up
Google Analytics lets you track something it calls goals. A goal can be anything 
that involves a confirmation page: a completed purchase, a successfully sub-
mitted item (or a failed submission), or a completed registration. Except for 
the case of the purchase, all the other examples of goals apply to networks on 
Ning, so you can see how setting up goals in Google Analytics can be useful.
When a visitor completes a goal, it’s referred to in Google Analytics as a conver-
sion (the visitor converted to a member, for example). Figure 16-9 shows the 
Goals Overview page for a goal I created to track new member sign-ups. To get 
to your Goals Overview page, click the Goals link in the left navigation bar.
 
It’s beyond the scope of this book to go through the steps to set up goals in 
Google Analytics, but you can read the details on how to do it on this Google 
Help page:

To set up a goal to track new member sign-up, click the Edit link to the right 
of the profile for which you want to set up a goal. This link takes you to the 
Profile Settings page for that profile. On this page, click the Edit link for one 
of the unused (Off) goals and use the following settings to populate the Goal 
Settings, as shown in Figure 16-10:
 
✓ Active Goal: Set this option to On to make sure your goal is being 
tracked.
 
✓ Match Type: This option on the Google Analytics goal setting page 
needs to be set to Regular Expression Match.
 
✓ Goal URL: This option needs to be set to newProfile — this is necessary 
because every new member who signs up lands on a page that has a URL 
that has newProfile at the end.
 
✓ Goal Name: You can enter anything you want in this field. The name you 
give the goal is reflected throughout the Goals section, so it makes sense 
to give it a meaningful name such as Member Sign Up.
 
✓ Case Sensitive: You can leave this check box deselected.
 
✓ Goal Value: This is the value that completing the goal has to you. Unless 
you need to track this information, you can leave it as 0.0.

Chapter 17
Keeping Your Network’s 
Members Coming Back
In This Chapter
▶ Building your community
▶ Managing your network’s growth
▶ Creating Terms of Use for your network
▶ Enforcing your Terms of Use
S
etting up your network on Ning is the beginning of the road for a 
Network Creator. You choose the features and the look that you want 
for your network. You invite people to join it, and you promote it. Thousands 
of people become members, and you now face a reality: If you want to keep 
people coming back, you have to keep working on your network as you 
would have to work with any other Web page.
To keep your network on Ning interesting and attractive to members, you can 
do a number of things. After the network is set up, you have to foster a sense 
of community in the network. As a result of building your community and 
your promotional efforts, your network will grow, and you have to prepare 
for this growth. To be ready for your network’s growth, you need to develop 
and enforce clear Terms of Use that will help you deal with challenges from 
members who bully other members or abuse your community, posting 
numerous unsolicited comments and sending promotional messages in bulk.
Building Your Community
The concept of communities on the Internet is nothing new. Usenet, consid-
ered to be the initial Internet community, dates back to the early ’80s, and 
the WELL (now at www.well.com) has been around since 1985. Because 
your network on Ning is not conceptually very different from other online 
communities, you can learn numerous lessons from past communities and 
then apply them to your own network.

242
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
Gathering information from 
your network and its data
One of the key ways that you build a community is by making it meaningful to 
the people who participate in it. To see why this is so important, consider a 
group you may have been part of in the past, whether it was the Eagle Scouts, 
a Jane Austen study group, or a garage band. When you have a group in mind, 
ask yourself, “Why did I choose to be a part of this particular group?” Chances 
are you participated in the group because there was something about it that 
you found appealing. Perhaps it was that you were getting something out of 
it, or the leader of the group particularly inspired you , or you simply loved to 
be with the people in the group. Ultimately, there was something you cared 
about deeply that kept you going back to the group.
Besides the Network Creator (you), networks on Ning also have Administrators 
(see Chapter 13) who help manage the network. Both need to always bear in 
mind what matters to your members most. The easiest way to find out what 
members care about the most is to read what they write about on the forum 
and other areas of the network. If members came to your network to ask 
about a topic they’re interested in, by keeping an eye on the conversations 
taking place in the network, you can discover a lot about their interests.
In the case of members who prefer to read posts and watch the photos and 
videos posted by others, you can find out what they care about by looking at 
the analytics data for your network. Things such as the most visited pages or 
the most visited sections on the network can show you a lot about what the 
interests of your members. For more information on analytics, see Chapter 16.
Welcoming all new members
Saying hello to all the people who join the network is a fairly manageable task 
that you can easily take on your own, as long as the network is small. If you 
don’t have the time to write a personalized message to each new member, at 
least make your message as personal as possible by having a skeleton mes-
sage and then adding something that’s relevant to that person.
If your network is set up to allow anybody to join without prior approval, 
having the discipline to welcome new members can also help you screen 
them. In a network on Ning, each new member has to answer any required 
registration questions that the Network Creator added while setting up the 
network. By taking a look at the answers provided by new members, you can 
spot spammers or other folks who do not meet the requirements to be a part 
of your network while you are welcoming those who are part of your target 
audience.

243
 Chapter 17: Keeping Your Network’s Members Coming Back
If you’ve set up your network to approve new members before they join, 
saying hi to them after you approve their membership makes them feel even 
more welcome.
As your membership grows, make sure new members continue to be wel-
comed, even if you, as the Network Creator, don’t do it. You can ask other 
members to help welcome new people (something they don’t need to be 
Administrators for), reminding them how it felt to be welcomed by you (or 
someone else) when they first joined. You might be surprised by how eager 
your members will be to help!
 
If by now you still wonder how important welcoming new members really is, 
just consider how different it feels to arrive in a party and not having anyone 
greet you, compared to having someone (ideally, a few people) showing you 
around and introducing you to things you can do while you’re visiting.
Alongside welcoming newly arrived members, consider having a Welcome 
Center on your network where you can give some general instructions about 
the network. You can create a Welcome Center through the use of the Notes 
feature (which I cover in Chapter 11), which lets you create static content 
pages.
Also, consider customizing your network’s welcome e-mail message that all 
new members receive upon signing up. This can be done using the Language 
Editor, a great tool that lets you modify all the messaging around the network 
to fit your specific needs. I explain how to change the welcome e-mail mes-
sage in Chapter 20.
Providing great, fresh content
Web sites that don’t offer fresh and relevant content don’t do much in the 
way of making visitors want to come back. Social networks on Ning are no 
different in this respect. If someone comes to your network and finds the 
same content over and over, there’s a good chance that the member will stop 
coming back altogether. Why come back to read the same things?
Here are a few things you can do to keep your content fresh:
 
✓ Keep your ear to the ground for new trends happening in your net-
work’s niche. Knowing the trends can help you create content (pod-
casts, blog posts, and so on) that your members will learn to expect, 
rewarding you with their loyalty. For example, to help keep TuDiabetes.
com fresh, I follow a number of diabetes blogs and forums; I read health 
news Web sites; and I regularly monitor YouTube, Digg, and a few other 
sites for diabetes-related content.

244
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
 
 Subscribing to Google Alerts is a great way to be on top of the latest 
news and posts having to do with a particular topic. Just visit www.
google.com/alerts, enter the search terms you want to be informed 
about, and type your e-mail address, and you’re set.
 
✓ Be consistent and predictable. Imagine how difficult it would be to 
follow your favorite TV show if it aired randomly. By looking at the 
Visitor Trending and Visitor Loyalty data in Google Analytics (explained 
in Chapter 16), you can determine how often you should be refreshing 
your network’s content. As a general rule, do your best to refresh con-
tent no less than once a week.
 
✓ Offer exclusive content. Here, the law of supply and demand can be 
seen in action: If you offer great content that can be found only in your 
network, members (and other people outside your network) are more 
likely to visit the site to check it out.
 
 Initially, there’s a good chance you’ll either have to come up with most 
of the exclusive content yourself or hire someone to do it for you. 
Exclusive content can include things like interviews with interesting 
people (in or outside the network) and discussing the results of a poll 
conducted in the network.
 
✓ Have a celebrity in your network’s niche join your network and 
contribute to it. Though this isn’t necessarily easy to accomplish, it’s 
an ideal way to generate exclusive content in terms of outside appeal. 
Assume that your network is the largest online community of coffee 
lovers. It may not be outrageous to try to e-mail a celebrity in this space 
and get this person interested in your site.
 
 When I say “celebrity,” I don’t necessarily mean someone like the 
founder of Starbucks, but perhaps the author of a famous coffee blog. As 
famous as the celebrity you contact may be, it’s possible that he’ll jump 
at the chance of getting more exposure for the blog he writes. After all, 
you both operate within a relatively narrow niche: coffee. At the very 
least, having him as a member and interviewing him for your network 
will be a great way to validate the work you do and keep other members 
interested.
Recognizing and rewarding your members
Over time, as your network grows in membership, you will also find yourself 
with a growing source of great exclusive content. Your members will start 
and engage in interesting discussion topics or share catchy videos that could 
very well be interesting to thousands more people.

245
 Chapter 17: Keeping Your Network’s Members Coming Back
Your members will generate content in the network as a result of their every-
day interactions with others. It helps if you offer recognition and reward 
them for outstanding contributions. To help you spot gems in your network 
that are worth rewarding, keep an eye on your network’s activity along with 
your analytics data. (I discuss analytics in Chapter 16.) You can easily moni-
tor the network activity by using the Latest Activity feature that shows all 
posts, new members, and all the activity in the network that you choose to 
display as part of the network setup process.
To uncover other valuable discussions, posts, videos, and other pieces of 
content worth highlighting, keep an eye on your network’s traffic data: You 
should check out the most popular pages among your network’s visitors at 
least once a week.
Most people like getting recognition or being rewarded for their contribu-
tions. This concept can be applied to your network as well. Offering rec-
ognition and rewards are two of the best things you can do to make your 
members to feel good about actively participating in your network.
 
To recognize great content, you can feature specific blog posts, photos, and 
videos on the main page of your network. You can also feature members who 
stand out in your network. You can feature a member in two ways: Click the 
Feature link by the member icon on the Members page or click the Feature 
link below the Admin Options on the page of the member you want to feature, 
as shown in Figure 17-1.
 
Figure 17-1: 
The Feature 
link under 
the Admin 
options lets 
you feature 
a member.
 

246
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
If recognition alone isn’t enough, consider contests and giveaways as an 
option. Some networks successfully offer a prize to the member who brings 
along the most new members in a certain period of time. Others choose to 
focus contests around content creation, asking members to submit entries 
to be eligible for a prize. If you’re short on ideas for contests, ask your mem-
bers. Regardless of the type of contest you choose to hold, here are a few 
tips to help you:
 
✓ Make sure to have clear judging criteria for how the winners will be 
selected. You can have contests where you and a few others choose the 
winners or contests where you ask the community to participate in the 
decision. For the community to act as the judge, you can advantage of 
the ability to rate photos and videos.
 
✓ When it comes to the prizes, you don’t need to spend an arm and a leg 
to make your contest work. Of course, giving away tickets to a popular 
concert or an all-expenses-paid vacation for two will attract the atten-
tion of many. But you’ll find that almost any prize, no matter how small 
(such as a $10 gift certificate to an online store), can make a contest fun 
and rewarding for members.
More important than the dollar value of your prizes is choosing something 
that’s relevant to the goals of your network. Still, if you’re keen on giving 
out cool prizes and you’re on a tight budget, here are a few ideas to get you 
started:
 
✓ Contact sponsors. You may be able to find sponsors who will fund one 
or more of your giveaways. It will make them look good, and you may be 
able to afford bigger and better prizes.
 
✓ Talk to your members. You may be able to find sponsors for prizes 
among your own members. That’s another reason for you, as a Network 
Creator, to introduce yourself to new members when they join.
 
✓ Keep it simple. A $25 gift certificate to a relevant store can go a long 
way! For example, if you run a network for animal lovers, the gift certifi-
cate could be to a pet supply store.
Avoiding spam
Members will value the efforts you put into keeping the network spam-free. 
There’s an overall prevalence of spam and other undesirable elements in the 
online experience these days, so it’s important to keep the atmosphere of 
your network clear of those elements.
Later in this chapter, I cover the topic of handling spam in your network in 
more depth. For now, don’t think that spam applies only to obscure-sounding 
folks inviting people to help them rescue money from Nigeria.

247
 Chapter 17: Keeping Your Network’s Members Coming Back
If you’re overly communicative, you may end up being considered a spammer 
by your members too. If your members aren’t expecting to receive frequent 
communications from the network, and they start seeing numerous messages, 
they may choose to turn off notifications from the network or, worse, flag 
messages from the network as spam and leave the network altogether.
 
Network Creators and Administrators have at their disposal the ability to 
broadcast messages to all members of the network. Use this feature with 
respect for your members’ expectations. As a general rule, try to avoid send-
ing more than one broadcast message per week.
Offering discounts and other benefits help
When you’re promoting a product or service, in the eye of the person you’re 
talking to, it’s all about the benefits, not the features. The features you offer 
to your members in your network can be translated in terms of the benefits 
they provide to the members, such as the ability to express themselves 
(through blogs, the forum, photos, and videos) and the ability to connect 
with other people.
Consider other benefits you can offer your members, such as the ability to 
get discounts to services and/or products that they value. For example, you 
can establish partnerships with vendors that give you a discount code for 
your members to get a 5 percent or $5 discount as they’re checking out after 
purchasing something. If you run a sports network, a discount to an online 
sporting goods store could be valuable to your members.
Sending out a newsletter
Although you’ll be competing for your member’s fragmented attention 
(people receive lots of e-mails and browse through dozens of Web sites every 
day), if the content your network offers is relevant, you stand a good chance 
of getting members to come back with a well-written newsletter. This is a 
good way for you to recapture members who don’t visit the network often, 
letting them know about interesting topics or fun videos they may have 
missed since the last time they signed in.
Because you can’t send long messages or messages containing HTML 
through your network, you’ll be better off using an off-the-shelf solution to 
offer a good-looking newsletter. I’ve personally used Constant Contact (www.
constantcontact.com) with very good results, but if you do a Google 
search for e-mail marketing, you can find a number of options that may work 
just as well.

248
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
Managing Your Network’s Growth
If your network grows, you’ll most likely be happy. Still, it may grow to a 
point where it may not be something you can manage by yourself. So if you 
suddenly realize that you’re biting off more than you can chew, consider 
asking for the help you need to better manage your network. Managing your 
network as it grows is important because it directly relates to how your mem-
bers feel about your network and how likely they are to come back to it after 
they visit it the first time and sign up for it.
If your network conveys a sense of chaos and feels like the Wild West, where 
there are no rules or rules are not enforced, members will eventually leave 
and never come back, even if you do everything I recommend to help build 
your community.
Communicating with your members
Communicating with the members of your network is an important and con-
tinual task throughout the life of your network. But even as the community 
grows, it becomes even more important to continue connecting with your 
members.
To communicate with the members of your network, your network gives 
you a number of channels that you can use to cater to different communi-
cation styles. The important thing with any of these approaches is to not 
over-communicate.
Here are a few ways for you to communicate with your members:
 
✓ Community announcements: You can write a post on your member blog 
or start a topic in the forum announcing information about the commu-
nity. You can then set aside a visible section on the main page of your 
network to link to your post. As explained in Chapter 9, you can do this 
with a Text Box, which lets you enter any kind of text or HTML, includ-
ing banner images, as shown in Figure 17-2.
 
✓ Weekly podcasts: Whether you do it in audio or video format, a weekly 
podcast will help you connect with your members in a very personal 
way. Letting your members see your face or hear your voice will take the 
communication to a level that text-based communication simply cannot 
accomplish. You can share podcasts in the network by uploading them 
as videos or taking advantage of the Music Player and uploading them as 
audio, as explained in Chapter 4.

249
 Chapter 17: Keeping Your Network’s Members Coming Back
 
Figure 17-2: 
You can 
include 
banners in 
Text Boxes 
on the main 
page.
 
 
✓ Broadcast messages: Discussed in Chapter 15, these messages are sent 
to all the members in the network and can serve to direct attention 
toward the community announcements and the podcasts when one of 
these has been posted. However, you should not abuse this feature, 
because you might start losing members who find excessive communica-
tions from your network annoying or overwhelming.
 
A Status Blog is a useful concept inspired by the Ning Status Blog (http://
status.ning.com). The idea is to have a blog outside your network to share 
information about upcoming or current maintenance downtime windows, so 
that members may be informed of the reasons why the network is unavailable. 
The blog is set up using an external service such as Tumblr, Blogger, or 
WordPress to communicate with the members while the network cannot be 
accessed. You can also use the blog to share certain milestones, such as 
number of members and traffic metrics.
Getting your members to help
You don’t have to do all of the management yourself — you can let your 
members get in on some of the tasks, too!
Are you familiar with the concept of neighborhood watch, in which citizens 
in a neighborhood help keep an eye on things and report suspicious behav-
ior? You should encourage your members at large to do the same, using the 
Report an Issue link at the bottom of your network. These reports are sent to 
the Network Creator and all Administrators.

250
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
Reporting suspicious behavior is one of the many ways in which members 
can help manage the network. Other ways for members to help are to wel-
come new members posting comments on their Comment Walls and to stay 
active, starting discussion topics or keeping discussions flowing by replying 
to existing topics.
Members can also help a lot by simply being constructive with their com-
ments. Life in the network can turn sour with only a few people injecting 
poison and negativity into discussions, so keeping things constructive in the 
face of different opinions being expressed is very important. Read the section 
titled “Enforcing Your Terms of Use,” later in this chapter, for details on how 
to handle members gone astray.
 
Ultimately, members who act as role models in the community, welcoming 
others, and participating actively and constructively in discussions can be 
invited to become Administrators.
Getting help from Administrators
In Chapter 13, I discuss all the ways in which you can enlist help from 
Administrators. Administrators can do almost everything the Network 
Creator can do, including featuring members, moderating and banning mem-
bers, and moderating content on the network. Some of the most important 
things Administrators cannot do are
 
✓ Administrators cannot delete the network.
 
✓ Administrators cannot designate additional Administrators.
 
✓ Administrators cannot add or remove premium services: You won’t find 
yourself unexpectedly having to pay for things like running your own 
ads on your network or find that your domain name mapping stopped 
working due to the action of an Administrator.
Knowing what Administrators cannot do may give you the peace of mind 
you need to relinquish some of the control you give away when you promote 
someone to become an Administrator. The reality is that Administrators 
become your right hand as your network grows.
Even if monitoring your network is the only thing you do all day long, even-
tually things can begin to happen faster than you can react to them. When 
things start moving too fast for you, having extra pairs of eyes looking at 
activity in the network and being able to act on issues if needed is very 
useful.
You can count on Administrators to help you steer discussions that get off 
track and keep your network free of spammers.

251
 Chapter 17: Keeping Your Network’s Members Coming Back
Creating Terms of Use for Your Network
To help Administrators and to set clear guidelines of what is and what isn’t 
acceptable behavior by members, you need to create Terms of Use for your 
network.
 
The Terms of Use you create for your network should not amend or supersede 
Ning’s Terms of Service (http://about.ning.com/tos.php). This is some-
thing you agree to when you register with, use, or browse the Ning platform.
 
I am not a lawyer. I am merely a guy who has run a social network before and 
wants to save you a headache or two. If you want legal advice about this or 
any other matter pertaining to your social network, it’s going to cost you more 
than a copy of Ning For Dummies.
Although the vast majority of your members will act reasonably while par-
ticipating in your network, you will likely run into cases of members who will 
join your network with the goal of advertising or something more obscure. 
To deal with these cases, you need to define what’s acceptable behavior 
and what’s not in your network. You also need to clearly explain the conse-
quences of not following the guidelines.
The Terms of Use will be a reflection of the values that you set for your net-
work. These terms are pillars that normally don’t change, and you can count 
on them to define the spirit and the environment that will drive your net-
work. It’s important that you think through the values you want your network 
to uphold as much as you can, so you can rely on them as you’re creating or 
updating the Terms of Use. Examples of values you may have in your network 
are respect, diversity, and openness.
After you’ve established the values that will define your network, try to 
address the following areas in your Terms of Use:
 
✓ Ownership of copyright and content ownership: You need to clarify 
for your members how copyright violations will be handled. Make 
sure to familiarize yourself with the basics of copyright and the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and offer a clear way for people to 
report alleged infringement in compliance with the DMCA.
 
✓ Handling of advertising and promotion: Depending on the type of net-
work you run, it may or may not be okay to allow members to actively 
promote products or services. However, even if your network allows 
it, you should establish what constitutes acceptable ways for members 
to talk about external Web sites. Be certain that you draw a clear line 
between what is acceptable promotion and spam.

252
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
 
✓ Offensive content: If you run an adult social network, your terms may 
differ from the ones of a family-oriented network. Regardless of the niche 
for your network, make sure to define what constitutes offensive material.
 
✓ Harassment of other members: It is never acceptable to insult or harass 
other members, so be sure to include terms to explain what will happen 
in these cases.
 
✓ Trolls and inflammatory topics: People who post topics with the 
intention of stirring up controversy and getting other members to 
react emotionally are known as trolls and should be dealt with as well.
 
✓ Privacy Policy: This can be an altogether separate document. It details 
elements such as the information your network collects from your 
members. The Privacy Policy should also cover how the network uses 
member data. As with the Terms of Use, your network’s Privacy Policy 
cannot amend or supersede Ning’s Privacy Policy (http://about.
ning.com/privacy.php).
 
✓ Termination: It is a good idea to explain clearly what actions by a member 
can lead to a warning as opposed to what can get a member banned.
If you intend to run your network as part of a business, you may want to con-
sider running your Terms of Use and Privacy Policy by an attorney to make 
sure you’re dotting your i’s and crossing your t’s properly.
Enforcing Your Terms of Use
After you create the Terms of Use comes the real test: applying them to your 
network as part of your everyday operation. While your network is small, this 
should typically be an easy task that you may not have to spend too much 
time on. But as your network grows, you’ll find that you need to enforce 
them. This may be as easy as stepping into a discussion that’s turning sour 
or removing a video that’s inappropriate for your network, or it may be as 
drastic as banning a member.
Enforcing the rules can be complicated, and situations aren’t always black 
or white: There can be shades of gray. When you put your Terms of Use out 
there in the real world, you’ll encounter cases that you hadn’t thought of 
before. For example, your Terms of Use may indicate that members cannot 
promote other services or Web sites: A posted link would be in violation of 
these guidelines if it were posted in isolation. But how do you treat links that 
are part of a running discussion topic where they’re relevant to the context?
How you deal with links to other Web sites depends on the policy you choose 
to adopt, but as you establish and update your stance on matters like this, 
consider that spammers are getting more and more sophisticated these days. 
What appears as an innocent contribution to a topic may be spam in disguise.

253
 Chapter 17: Keeping Your Network’s Members Coming Back
When you’re enforcing the Terms of Use, you have to take into consideration 
not only the context of the place where a contribution is being made, but also 
the context of the member posting it. Is the poster a person who regularly 
contributes on topic and without any preference for citing a Web site beyond 
another one? Is it the first post the person makes on the Web site? Depending 
on the answer to these questions, your action may differ.
 
When you’re learning the ropes, it helps to learn from the pros. One of the 
most popular blogs on the Web is Boing Boing (www.boingboing.net). 
Teresa Nielsen Hayden is one of the blog’s moderators, and she wrote a fan-
tastic piece on Boing Boing’s Moderation Policy that I highly recommend you 
read. It can be found at
http://boingboing.net/2008/03/27/boing-boings-moderat.html
One thing is for sure: Your Terms of Use will be a dynamic document you will 
find yourself revising over time. As a result of the things you learn over time 
by observing the behavior of your members, decide how you’re going to deal 
with new situations and update the Terms of Use accordingly so that the next 
time you face the same case, you have a frame of reference to fall back on.
Informing members about 
the Terms of Use
Thinking through your Terms of Use, writing them, and updating them as you 
go are only part of the job. You need to make sure you inform new members 
about them. There are a number of ways in which you can do this:
 
✓ Edit your welcome message. Along with allowing you to edit and cus-
tomize almost every word in your network, your network’s Language 
Editor lets you change the message that gets e-mailed to all new mem-
bers as soon as they join your network (see Figure 17-3). In this message, 
you should include a link to the Terms of Use so that new members may 
bear in mind what constitutes acceptable behavior in the network. 
 
 When new members sign up for your network, they have to agree to abide 
by Ning’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. In the same way, you can use 
it to edit your network’s welcome message, you can use the Language 
Editor to include language in the sign-up screen requiring new members 
to agree to abide by your network’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
 
 In the Language Editor, click the Edit link corresponding to your network’s 
language and perform a search for By signing up, you agree, which is part 
of the language included in the sign-up screen next to the links to Ning’s 
Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (see Figure 17-4). You can include links to 
your own Terms of Use and Privacy Policy in the custom text box.

message.
 
 
✓ Implement a “Network 101” box: You can include a Text Box (which 
allows you to enter plain text as well as HTML and images) in the right 
column of your network, where it is visible throughout the entire net-
work to link to your Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other references, 
such as a Welcome Center.

 Chapter 17: Keeping Your Network’s Members Coming Back
Minimizing spammers in your network
Part of fostering a sense of community in your network is allowing your net-
work’s members to communicate with each other. In this section, I provide 
some methods that can help you lessen the occurrence of unwanted spam-
ming in your network.
Moderating new members
One way to minimize (though not completely eliminate) issues with spam-
mers and other undesirable folks is to moderate new members. If you’ve set 
up your network to moderate new members, either the Network Creator or 
an Administrator needs to approve someone’s membership before he or she 
can get inside the network. This moderation gives you a stage during which 
you can evaluate new members prior to their joining the network, as opposed 
to letting members join the network without any evaluation on your part.
Depending on the volume of new members you get on a daily basis, moderat-
ing new members may or may not be something you can accommodate — it 
obviously takes additional time and effort. However, it may be a great way to 
keep spammers at bay. The main downside of this approach obviously is that 
it won’t help you catch stealth spammers, people who appear to be legitimate 
members at first and eventually come out from under their cover to do what 
they came to do in the first place.
Adding required profile questions
When you’re setting up your network, you can add profile questions to it: 
questions for members to answer so as to help build their profile pages. 
Required profile questions are questions a new member must answer before 
being allowed to finish the sign-up process into your network.
Though required profile questions aren’t necessarily a deterrent for spam-
mers, they can help you gather valuable information to help you identify 
potential spammers. Sometimes you’ll see people entering garbage text 
(something like qweqgcdsbcasd) as a way to meet the requirement of answer-
ing a particular question. That is not a good sign and definitely should raise 
a red flag. A slight variation of this case is when a new member exhibits very 
little effort while answering profile questions — again, not necessarily a 
spammer but cause for a red flag to be raised.
Adding an open-ended question to which only a legitimate new member 
would have an answer can also help you spot people you may not want in 
your network. For example, in the case of a network for people with diabe-
tes, such a question could be “What was your most recent A1C?” If you don’t 
know the answer to this question, you won’t necessarily be banned. If you 
have diabetes, however, it is very unlikely that you will not know how to 
answer this question.

256
Part IV: Promoting Your Network 
Dealing with banned members
The reaction of a banned member can be quite unpredictable. It can fluctu-
ate from utter silence all the way to complete outrage. In the case of a silent 
banned member, that is one less headache for you and your Administrators.
In the case of an outraged banned member, your reply to any communica-
tions from him or her needs to be as measured as possible. Here are some 
thoughts for you to consider if you’re in this position:
 
✓ If a banned member writes and asks you about the reason for the 
decision, provide concrete examples. In as much detail as you find 
necessary, explain the reason for the ban and cite the section of the 
Terms of Use that was violated.
 
✓ Expect a reply from the person. If he or she took the time to write the 
first time, there’s a very good chance a reply from you will be followed by 
a reply back, and this reply may be stronger than the first communication.
 
✓ Not having read the Terms of Use cannot be an excuse for unaccept-
able behavior in the social network. Be firm in your decision. At the 
same time, keep doors open and consider the context that the person 
presents you with. Under certain circumstances, you may want to 
consider letting a member back in the network. These cases typically 
involve an apology and a promise on his or her part to not repeat the 
behavior that led to getting banned.
 
✓ Always keep your cool and think before replying. The person who got 
banned was banned for a good reason. If his or her approach to getting 
unbanned involves insulting one of the Administrators, you can safely 
imagine what this person’s behavior would be if he or she were let back 
in the network.
 
✓ Everything has a limit, and you aren’t obligated to reply indefinitely 
to a thread of replies from a banned member. Decide when you will 
stop any further communication, inform the person at that point, and be 
firm about not continuing the conversation past that point.

Purchasing Premium Services
In This Chapter
▶ Purchasing premium services
▶ Controlling the ads
▶ Using your own domain name
▶ Removing Ning promotion links
▶ Getting more storage and bandwidth
E
ver since I found out about it, I thought the platform offered by Ning 
was fantastic for a free service. Think about it: You can create and run 
a social network (your own flavor of Facebook or MySpace) focused on any 
topic you want, without having to worry about all that goes on behind the 
scenes to make it happen.
But you might need a little more than the basic package: You may need to 
control your own ads, use your own domain name, remove Ning’s promotion 
links, or get more storage and bandwidth. If this is your case, Ning has four 
premium services that you can pay for on a monthly basis to take care of 
these needs.
In this chapter, I cover the premium services, explaining what each of them 
allows you to accomplish.
Purchase Premium Services
Purchasing premium services in your network is a straightforward process. 
Just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Manage link in your navigation and follow the Premium 
Services link under the Your Network header.
 
 You’re taken to the Add Premium Services to Your Network Name page, 
shown in Figure 18-1.

260
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
 
Figure 18-1: 
This page 
lets you 
easily add 
premium 
services to 
your 
network.
 
 
2. Select the Add check boxes next to the service(s) of your choice and 
click the Go button at the bottom of the page.
 
 There are four premium services you can add to your network, (dis-
cussed in detail in the following sections of this chapter):
 
• Remove Ning Promotion Links: $24.95 per month
 
• Control the Ads: $24.95 per month
 
• Use Your Own Domain Name: $4.95 per month per domain
 
• Get More Storage and Bandwidth: $9.95 per month per unit
 
 If you previously purchased other premium services, you can skip to 
Step 4; otherwise, proceed to Step 3.
 
3. Fill out your credit card information and review your services.
 
 To keep your finances straight, keep in mind that each Ning account can 
be associated with only one credit card. So, for example, if you have two 
networks that need to be run using two different credit cards, you need 
two different Ning accounts to run the networks under the separate 
credit cards.
 
 Also, to make accounting departments happy, when you purchase pre-
mium services, the credit card you enter is charged, and a receipt is 
e-mailed to you. From that point on, your credit card is charged every 30 
days (unless you cancel your premium services), after which you get an 
e-mail with a receipt.

261
 Chapter 18: Purchasing Premium Services
 
4. Click the Go button.
 
5. Enter your password for confirmation purposes.
To cancel a premium service, follow the same steps you would take to add a 
new premium service. Instead of selecting the Add check boxes, you need to 
click View Your Premium Services. This link is shown in Figure 18-2.
 
Figure 18-2: 
The View

Click to view, cancel, or edit your premium services.
On the page you’re taken to, you can do the following: Cancel any premium 
service by clicking the respective Cancel link; view or edit your credit card 
information; or edit the ads on your network if you’re paying for this pre-
mium service, as shown in Figure 18-3.

262
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
Control the Ads
By default, your network displays AdSense ads in the right column. If some-
one clicks an ad, any revenue generated goes to Ning. If you don’t plan on 
having ads become a revenue stream on your network and you don’t mind 
having ads on your network, you don’t need to do anything.
If you want to obtain revenue from running ads on your network or you 
prefer not to have any ads at all, you need to purchase the Control the Ads 
premium service.
When you select the Add check box below the Control the Ads section of the 
Premium Services page, a panel opens, as shown in Figure 18-4.
 
Figure 18-4: 
The Control 
the Ads 
premium 
service lets 
you remove 
Ning’s 
AdSense 
ads and 
optionally 
run your 
own ads.
 
After you pay for the premium service, Ning’s AdSense ads get removed 
from the network. If you want to run your own AdSense ads (or ads from any 
advertising network), paste the HTML code from your advertising network 
into the box in the Control the Ads section and click the Go button at the 
bottom of the page.
When you pay to control the ads on your network, you are not limited to 
adding the code from your advertising network. Through your Features page, 
you can also move the Ads box anywhere you want on the main page, and 
you can paste HTML advertising code in Text Boxes on your main page or 
elsewhere in your network.

263
 Chapter 18: Purchasing Premium Services
 
Although you can technically add the HTML code for a banner ad to a Text Box 
on your main page, you should not do it unless you pay for the Control the Ads 
premium service. It’s against Ning’s Terms of Service to run ads on your net-
work without paying for the premium service to control the ads. When you 
consider how inexpensive this premium service is, putting a banner ad in a 
Text Box is simply not worth the hassle and wasting all your hard work.
Use Your Own Domain Name
Use Your Own Domain Name is my favorite premium service. If there’s some-
thing that gives personality to a site, it’s the domain name. Although the 
.ning.com appendage at the end of all networks on Ning could be consid-
ered a minor thing, using your own domain name looks more professional.
Also, by now, many of the best network URLs have already been taken, so 
you may find yourself stuck with a network URL you aren’t particularly fond 
of. So that’s two reasons to use your own domain name.
When you select the Add check box below the Use Your Own Domain section 
of the Premium Services page, a panel opens, as shown in Figure 18-5.
 
Figure 18-5: 
Using your 
own domain 
gives your 
network 
a more 
professional 
appearance.
 
Unfortunately, setting up this premium service typically entails a bit more 
legwork than the other ones. But it’s not rocket science: It simply requires 
a bit more attention to detail. Here are the steps to follow to get your own 
domain name mapped to your network on Ning:
 
1. Purchase a domain name if you haven’t done it yet.
 
 Ning recommends you use GoDaddy, Network Solutions, Yahoo!, 
Register, DomainMaze, or 1&1 as domain name registrars.

264
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
 
2. When you have your domain, enter it in the URL text box shown in 
Figure 18-5.
 
 This step notifies Ning of the domain you want to map to your network.
 
3. Go to your registrar’s Web site and set up domain name mapping.
 
 This is where things can get hairy, but Ning has made it easier by offer-
ing tutorials for each of the registrars I mention in Step 1. You can read 
these tutorials here: http://tinyurl.com/ningfordummiesdomain.
 
4. Wait up to three days for all the domain name magic to happen.
 
 If you don’t see your network coming up when you type in your domain 
name after three days, contact your registrar.
If you set up everything properly, when people type your domain name, they 
see your network on Ning. Your network is still available through its .ning.
com URL unless you implement the hack to have it redirect to your domain 
automatically (which I explain in Chapter 23).
Remove Ning Promotion Links
The Remove Ning Promotion Links premium service is the easiest one of all 
to understand and set up. Networks on Ning by default carry these Ning pro-
motion links:
 
✓ At the top left of the network is a Create Your Own Social Network button.
 
✓ In the footer is a line that reads “Created by Manny Hernandez on Ning.” 
(Well, most networks don’t say Manny Hernandez.)
 
✓ In the right column, as shown in Figure 18-6, you find an About box con-
taining a link to Ning.com and a Create Your Own Social Network! link.
 
Figure 18-6: 
The About 
box is one of 
the places 
affected 
by this 
premium 
service. 
When you buy this premium service, the top-left button goes away, the refer-
ence to Ning on the footer disappears, and the About box can be moved or 
removed from the right column.

265
 Chapter 18: Purchasing Premium Services
 
Paying for this premium service does not remove the links on the right side of 
the network footer, pointing to Ning’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service 
with your network’s theme. Also, it doesn’t remove mentions of Ning in the 
Privacy Policy and Terms of Service or mentions of Ning ID in the Sign In and 
Sign Up pages.
Unlike the case with the other premium services, when you select the Add 
check box below the Remove Ning Promotion Links, nothing happens. You 
just click the Go button and continue with the rest of the setup process as 
explained earlier in order to do away with the promotional links.
Get More Storage and Bandwidth
Get More Storage and Bandwidth is the premium service I would worry about 
the least if I were you, at least for now. It’s meant for networks that have lots 
of photos and video content or networks that have been around for a while.
By default, your social network lets you store 10GB of content and use up to 
100GB of bandwidth. According to Ning, this is roughly equivalent to a net-
work with approximately 5,000 photos or 500 videos.
 
If your network is the next online multimedia success story, you may be one of 
those Network Creators who need to purchase additional storage and band-
width. If this is your case, Ning notifies you as you’re approaching your quota.
You can buy additional units of 10GB of storage and 100GB of bandwidth 
at $9.95 per unit. When you select the Add check box below the Get More 
Storage and Bandwidth section of the Premium Services page, a panel opens, 
as shown in Figure 18-7.
 
Figure 18-7: 
You can 
purchase 
more stor-
age and 
bandwidth if 
you need to.
 
Enter the number of units you need, click the Go button, and complete the 
rest of the process to have your storage and bandwidth needs taken care of.

Breaking the CSS Code
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the basics of CSS
▶ Making changes to CSS on your network
▶ Checking out examples of CSS changes
▶ Finding additional CSS resources
C
ascading style sheets (CSS) is a topic that can take a whole book. As 
a matter of fact, it does take many books: Doing a search for CSS on 
Amazon.com returns more than 40,000 titles! This is so much the case that 
trying to talk in a few pages about CSS is nearly impossible.
This chapter isn’t meant to be a tutorial on CSS. You really need to go elsewhere 
for more info — such as HTML, XHTML & CSS For Dummies, 6th Edition, by Ed 
Tittel and Jeff Noble (Wiley) — for an in-depth look at this topic.
In this chapter, I discuss CSS just enough to help you understand the basic 
concepts underlying it and how it applies to your network. I give you some 
examples of changes you can do to your network’s CSS. I also share a few 
references to books, Web-based resources, and networks on Ning for you to 
look into for information and inspiration.
Discovering the Basics of CSS
Back in the early days of the Internet, Web site content and presentation (the 
way the Web site looked) were so intrinsically connected that redesigning 
a Web site was a task that few people looked forward to. One day, someone 
thought that the content of a Web site and its look could be separated, so that 
the changes to how the content looks could be made relatively easily. Enter 
cascading style sheets (CSS).
With CSS, you can define things like font size, font family, font color, back-
ground color, and so on, completely separated from the content to which it is 
applied.

If you want to get a quick idea of what CSS does to a Web site, visit CSS Zen 
Garden (http://csszengarden.com) and try some of the different CSS 
themes the site offers. Figures 19-1 and 19-2 show two sample themes for 
you to get a feel. You can basically view the same information with different 
looks. This is not to say that changing the way a Web site is easy, but it’s far 
easier today than it used to be in the mid- and late ’90s.

 Chapter 19: Breaking the CSS Code
 
A good example of how your network takes advantage of CSS is accessing it 
through a mobile phone. If you add /m at the end of your network’s URL, you 
network is presented using a CSS that’s designed with iPhone users in mind. 
You can see a version of http://tudiabetes.com/m in Figure 19-3.

Grasping the very basics of CSS
In the examples later in this chapter, you encounter a number of things that 
may look like a foreign language to you, so in the interest of not turning this 
book into a book about CSS, I limit explanations about CSS to what you need 
to know to understand what the examples mean.
Here’s an example of a CSS style discussed later on:
.xg_widget_profiles_members_index .count
{
display: none;
}
In plain English, it translates into something like this: “When you see the 
class .count that is a child of .xg_widget_profiles_members_index, 
do not display it.”

270
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
What are classes? To differentiate them, classes in a style sheet are always 
preceded by a dot, as with .count. Classes make it possible for you to define 
multiple formats for a single HTML tag on the same Web page.
What is a child? It’s an element in CSS that is contained within another ele-
ment, called (you guessed) its parent. This parent-child relationship is 
denoted by a space between the two classes, as shown in the preceding piece 
of code, where there’s a space between index and .count.
In another example, you see the following code:
#xn_bar
{
float:none;
margin-left:auto;
margin-right:auto;
width:955px;
}
I want to draw your attention to the # sign in front of #xn_bar. This is an 
example of an ID, the complement to a class. IDs in a style signify elements 
that are referenced only once in the document. In the case of the example, 
this ID refers to the thin strip with the search box at the top of your network 
that sits at the very top of every page on your network, an element that 
appears only once in the entire page.
The best advice I can give you
There’s nothing like “seeing” CSS in action and playing with it to start getting 
a good feel for it. If I can get you to remember one and only one thing after 
you’re done reading this chapter, let it be this:
 
PLEASE, download and install a copy of Firebug.
You can get Firebug at http://getfirebug.com. To run Firebug, you need 
to run Firefox as your browser because Firebug is a Firefox plug-in.
Firebug lets you inspect a Web site’s CSS by simply placing your cursor over 
the element you want to learn about. You can then make edits to the CSS in a 
nonpermanent way that lets you see how those changes would appear.
After you set up Firebug, the only things standing between you and CSS mas-
tery are time and patience.

271
 Chapter 19: Breaking the CSS Code
Making Changes to CSS on Your Network
In the following sections, I go over a few examples of things you can do in 
your network through CSS changes. Before I get to the things you can do, let 
me spend a few lines going over the ones you can’t.
What you can’t do with CSS
You can accomplish a lot of things, but remember, CSS is strictly focused on 
displaying existing information. In the case of your network, CSS can help you 
manage the display and positioning of elements that your network already 
contains.
However, CSS can’t insert HTML elements that your network doesn’t already 
contain. This is not to say that you can’t accomplish some of those fantastic 
ideas you already have, such having a horizontal header above your naviga-
tion or an Adobe Flash header crowning your network. To find out how to 
do some things that involve inserting elements that your network doesn’t 
natively carry, check out Chapter 23.
Besides not letting you insert elements that don’t already exist on your net-
work, here are a few other things you currently can’t accomplish with CSS:
 
✓ Changes to Flash content: Your network’s badges, photo slideshow, Video 
Player, and Music Player are all Flash applications. You can either show 
them or hide them, but you cannot modify them through any use of CSS.
 
✓ Changes to content elements on profile pages: On a member’s profile 
page, the headers and boxes for all content elements (all blog posts, 
forum posts, photos, videos, and so on) posted by the member are 
controlled by the same class. As a result, you can’t selectively hide or 
modify one without also affecting all the other ones. This may change in 
the future, but currently it is something you can’t accomplish.
 
✓ Changes to member details on profile pages: On a member’s profile 
page, the details below the member photo are in the same boat as the 
content elements just mentioned. For example, you can’t hide a mem-
ber’s gender and display her location, or vice versa, because all the 
member details are controlled by the same class. If you modify the class, 
all the member details are affected by it.

272
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
Making changes from the 
Advanced Appearance tab
In Chapter 7, I show you how to play with the theme of your network so you 
can design it to your liking. To make any CSS change on your network, you 
have to go to the same place:
 
1. Click the Manage link on your network’s navigation.
 
2. Click the Appearance option below the Your Network header.
 
3. On the Appearance page, click the Advanced tab, as shown in 
Figure 19-4.
 
4. Paste into the text box available any CSS code that you want to 
include.
 
5. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the Save button.
 
 The CSS styles you added should be reflected in the network at this point.
 
It’s a good idea to get your CSS code all clean and ready to go before entering 
it in the Advanced tab of the Appearance page. CSS changes are one of the rea-
sons why it’s a good idea to run a test network to try out your changes before 
you apply them to your live network.
 
Figure 19-4: 
The 
Advanced 
tab in the 
Appearance 
section 
lets you

changes.
 

273
 Chapter 19: Breaking the CSS Code
As for tools to work on your CSS, there are plenty of nice HTML and CSS edi-
tors out there. A Google search for CSS editor reveals a lot of them. As long as 
you aren’t too sloppy, all you need is a basic text editor, such as Notepad (for 
Windows) or TextEdit (for Mac OS), to copy your code from.
Looking at examples of CSS changes
In the following sections, I give you four examples of CSS changes to get you 
an idea of the kinds of things you can accomplish using CSS in your network.
 
New CSS classes are regularly added to the code that powers networks on 
Ning. Also, some CSS classes are retired occasionally.
Therefore, even though you can remove newly added styles, it’s always a 
good idea to verify the following CSS examples before implementing them on 
your network, to avoid any surprises. You can do this verification on a test 
network, where you aren’t going to annoy members on your live network.
 
In all the examples in this chapter, I have modified existing styles. You can 
create your own styles to use them in text boxes and notes if you want. To 
do this, you need to first define the new class in the Advanced tab of the 
Appearance section. You can then call the class in the HTML where you want 
to use it elsewhere on the network.
Hiding the number of members
This CSS style hides the number of members on the Members page. This is 
something some network creators like to do while their networks are still 
relatively small.
.xg_widget_profiles_members_index .count
{
display: none;
}
Fixing the background image
If you’ve uploaded a background image through the Appearance page (as 
explained in Chapter 8), you can use this CSS style to lock the background 
image of the network in place when you scroll down. You can see an example 
of an implementation at http://thisis50.com.
body
{
background-attachment: fixed;
}

Aligning the bar with the Ning button with the other edges
This CSS style is purely aesthetic, but it gives your network a nicer look (well, 
I kinda like it myself, at least). Figure 19-5 shows you what happens to the 
area where the Ning button is located before and after applying the new style.

Changing fonts on your profile page
This CSS style, which I’ve applied on my TuDiabetes.com profile page (it 
works the same way, except for showing up only on my page and being modi-
fied by clicking the Theme link below my profile photo), makes the font of 
headers of the modules in my page a bit bigger and changes them to use the 
Courier font. (I have a thing for this font lately.)
.xg_module_head h2
{
font-size:1.4em;
font-family:courier;
}
You can see the change in action in Figure 19-6, where the headers for My

Finding Additional CSS Resources
CSS, as you can see, is a vast territory. So it helps having a few good extra ref-
erences to fall back on:
 
✓ CSS No Crap Primer: This funny named Web site comes up at the 
top when you Google CSS 101, and for a good reason. It really makes 
understanding CSS as easy as it can get, so I recommend you start here: 
http://wendypeck.com/css101.html.
 
✓ W3Schools.com: The Learn CSS tutorial is the second easiest way into 
CSS you can find around (the first one being the CSS No Crap Primer). It 
goes into more detail than the primer, giving many more examples: www.
w3schools.com.
 
✓ Eric Meyer: As the author of a large number of CSS titles, Eric Meyer has 
turned into a bit of a legend in Web design circles. The CSS section on 
his site (http://meyerweb.com/eric/css) is fairly comprehensive 
and has turned into a must-use reference.
 
✓ World Wide Web consortium: The W3C site (www.w3.org) is the top 
destination for CSS references. The W3C Learning CSS section (www.
w3.org/Style/CSS/learning) is very useful, as is the complete CSS 
specification (www.w3.org/TR/CSS21). However, the W3C Web site 
isn’t the best place to go to get started with CSS.
 
These networks are nice examples of what can be done on a network on Ning 
with CSS changes:
 
✓ http://my.fidgetstick.com: The change to a two-column layout on 
this network was done with CSS. The main page looks like a million 
dollars, as you can see in Figure 19-7.

276
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
 
Figure 19-7: 
The main 
page of the 
Fidgetstick 
network 
has some 
impressive 
CSS work.
 
 
✓ www.finance30.com: The folks who designed this site kept the three 
columns, but through some CSS magic, they swapped the left column 
and the middle one. They also did some very cool stuff by adding a box 
with plenty of space in the footer in order to house the network’s About 
section, a toolbox, and quick links.
 
✓ www.veloist.com and http://printjunkie.net: Both of these net-
works are good examples of subtle changes that go a long way. Adding 
feather-thin borders or separators to the different features on the main 
page and tweaking with fonts are two things the designers did very well.

Using the Language Editor
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know the Language Editor
▶ Choosing a different language
▶ Customizing your network with the Language Editor
▶ Translating your network to an unsupported language
▶ Importing a language into your network
D
o you remember a song that went “You say potato, I say potato”? The 
first potato was pronounced with an American accent and the second 
one with a British accent. If you don’t remember it, don’t feel bad: That prob-
ably means you’re not too old!
At the time this book is being written, Ning lets you offer your network in 
more than 20 languages, so you can say potato in more languages than you 
can imagine.
This chapter deals with the Language Editor, the tool that makes all this 
possible. The Language Editor also lets you modify specific words and some 
other cool things across your network.
Meeting the Language Editor and 
Choosing a Different Language
The Language Editor is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal for 
customizing your network to the max, and it’s one of my personal favorites!
Chapter 19 tells how you can make your network look the way you want it. 
The Language Editor helps you make your network interface (menus, but-
tons, headers, legends, and so on) read exactly the way you want it to.

278
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
Having your network’s language meet your needs may mean one of two things:
 
✓ You may need the network to be offered in a language other than the 
default U.S. English, so you can cater to your target member audience.
 
✓ Your network may be in English, but you may need to change certain 
words to match your needs or wants.
Whatever the case, the Language Editor is the tool you need, and it can even 
help you accomplish a few stylistic changes that go beyond textual modifica-
tion. I go over a few examples of each case later in this chapter. In the follow-
ing steps, I show you the simplest thing you can do with the Language Editor: 
Choose a different language.
 
1. Click the Manage link in your navigation and click the Language 
Editor icon below the Your Network heading.
 
 You land on the Language Editor page, which presents you first with the 
option to edit the language on your network, as shown in Figure 20-1.
 
 The Language Editor page shows you what language your network is 
currently using next to the words The active language for your network is, 
followed by the Change Active Language link.
 
2. Click the Change Active Language link
 
 You’re taken to the Network Information page, where you can change 
the network’s language to one of the languages offered by Ning. The 
variety of languages goes as far as offering two variations of English (U.S. 
and British), two variations of Spanish (Argentina and Spain), almost 
every other major language in Europe, and a number of Asian languages.

Customizing Your Network with 
the Language Editor
Although it’s extremely useful to be able to change the language of your 
entire network, the true power of the Language Editor shows when you use it 
to tweak little things here and there throughout the network.
In Chapter 8, I rename the Members link in the network navigation as 
Dummies (because my test network is called Network For Dummies), as 
shown in Figure 20-3. I promised in that chapter that I would show you how 
to change the name of many other things in the network in Chapter 20 — 
you’re finally here!

280
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
 
Figure 20-3: 
The 
Language 
Editor lets 
you rename 
text ele-
ments in the 
network.
 
To change Members to Dummies elsewhere in the network, you need to 
use the Language Editor. Follow these steps to see how you would go about 
making such a change:
 
1. On the Language Editor page, click the Edit link next to the active 
language for your network — in my network, that would be English 
(U.S.).
 
 You’re taken to the page where you edit your active language, as shown 
in Figure 20-4.
 
2. Type Members in the Original Text box and click the Search button.
 
 As you can imagine, you get a large list of results because the word 
Members appears in many places in the network.
 
Figure 20-4: 
This is the 
page where 
all the text 
customiza-
tion magic 
happens.
 

281
 Chapter 20: Using the Language Editor
 
3. Scan the Original Text column for instances of the word Members (all 
by itself) and type Dummies in the Custom Text box in the column 
right next to each.
 
 If you wanted to be exhaustive, you would substitute the words member 
and members for dummy and dummies in every single result you get on 
this page and click one of the Save Page buttons. (There’s a Save Page 
button at the top of the page and one at the bottom.)
 
 For simplicity’s sake, scan for all instances of Members and All Members 
and substitute Dummies and All Dummies in the boxes to the right of 
each instance, in the Custom Text column on the right.
 
4. When you’re done changing every instance, click either Save Page 
button.
 
 If you take a look at the Members . . . errr, Dummies page, the instances 
of the word Members that used to be there have been replaced with the 
word Dummies (see Figure 20-5).
 
5. Repeat this process to change as many words, phrases, and text details 
across the network as you need.

Members 
is now All 
Dummies

Changing your welcome e-mail message
Every time new members join, an e-mail message is sent to them, which 
essentially thanks them for joining and provides them with a link to your net-
work. You can edit this welcome e-mail message through the Language Editor 
to include additional information and links or to make it a bit more personal.

282
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
To edit the welcome e-mail message, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Language Editor page corresponding to your network’s lan-
guage, type the text Welcome to %s! Thank you for joining. in the 
Original Text search box.
 
 In case you’re wondering, the %s part gets replaced by the network 
name when the message is sent.
 
2. Make all the changes you want to your welcome e-mail message and 
then click the Save Page button.
 
 From that point on, all new members will receive the updated version of 
the message upon joining the network.
 
Although you can include HTML code in any custom text you enter through 
the Language Editor, whether the HTML gets properly rendered depends on 
where the text you’re modifying gets displayed.
For example, because network messages don’t support HTML, any HTML 
code you include in your modified welcome e-mail message doesn’t get ren-
dered as such.
If you want to include a link in any network e-mail messages, such as confir-
mations of actions such as joining the network or joining a group, simply type 
in the URL without any HTML code surrounding it.
Changing your network’s footer
The network footer is one area on your network where you can make great 
use of the Language Editor. You can find an excellent example of this at www.
firefighternation.com, one of the networks I recommend in Chapter 2.
Dave Iannone, Network Creator for Firefighter Nation, has customized his 
network’s footer to include additional information such as his company’s 
name linked back to his company’s Web site, his network’s partners, and a 
disclaimer about his network’s intended use, as you can see in Figure 20-6.
 
Figure 20-6: 
The 
Language 
Editor 
lets you 
modify your 
network’s 
footer.
 

283
 Chapter 20: Using the Language Editor
Lots of text elements in the Language Editor, like the ones I am about to explain 
to you, contain items called variables that Ning automatically translates into 
something else. This is a way to maintain items automatically updated across 
the network in case you change your network’s name, your own member pro-
file name, or any other elements that Ning handles dynamically for you.
Several text elements (shown in Figure 20-7) make up your network’s footer:
 
✓ © 2009 Created by Manny Hernandez on Ning: As I’m sure you figured 
out already, in your network, this part of the footer obviously show your 
name instead of mine. When you search for this text element, you can 
find it by doing a partial search; for instance, searching for Created by 
brings this element up among the results. In the Custom Text column, 
the corresponding entry goes something like © %1$s &nbsp; Created by 
%2$s on Ning, which warrants a bit of explaining:
 
• %1$s — This is a variable that gets translated into the current year 
in this particular case. In other lines of text in the Language Editor, 
it means other things. Unless you want to get rid of the current 
year information in the footer, you don’t have to do anything to it.
 
• &nbsp; — This item is the equivalent in HTML to nonbreaking 
space, which is a way of physically spacing to pieces of text on the 
page without introducing a line break.
 
• %2$s — In this line of text, this variable is replaced by whatever 
name you go by in the network you created. If you want, you can 
replace it with the name of your company or organization along 
with a link to your Web site, as Dave did on FireFighter Nation. Just 
like in the case of %1$s, this variable means other things in other 
lines of text.
 
✓ Badges: This link points to your network’s Badges & Widgets page. If 
you feel the term badges is not well understood by your members, you 
give this link a different name.
 
Figure 20-7:

284
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
 
✓ Report an Issue: You can turn this text into the more inviting Contact Us 
or Feedback.
 
✓ Privacy: This link points to Ning’s Privacy Policy.
 
✓ Terms of Service: This link points to Ning’s Terms of Service. If you have 
your own Terms of Service, one good use of the Language Editor could 
be to change this text to “Terms of Service (Ning).”
Translating Your Network to an 
Unsupported Language
Although there are 24 languages supported by Ning at the time of this writ-
ing, with so many languages in the world, you may need to translate your net-
work to a new language. The Language Editor is the place for you to do this.
To create a new translation, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Create a New Translation for Your Network link close to the 
bottom of the Language Editor page, as shown in Figure 20-8.
 
 You’re taken to the Create a New Translation page, as shown in 
Figure 20-9.
 
2. Give the new language a name in the Language Name text box.
 
3. Choose an existing language as a starting point to base your new lan-
guage on from the Based On drop-down list.
 
Figure 20-8: 
Ning lets 
you create 
your own 
translation 
for your 
network.
 

285
 Chapter 20: Using the Language Editor
 
Figure 20-9: 
To cre-
ate a new 
translation, 
you have to 
base it on 
an existing

4. Click the Create button.
 
 The page you’re taken to next looks almost exactly like the one shown 
in Figure 20-4, earlier in this chapter, but showing at the top is the name 
you’ve given the new translation. Instead of having the Custom Text 
column fields prefilled with language, the fields are empty, giving you the 
chance to customize every single language item in the entire network.
 
5. In the Custom Text column, fill in the fields with translated text.
 
6. When you’re done, click the Save Page button.
 
 This can be quite an undertaking, but if the language you need for your 
network is not available, it may be your only option. Still, before you 
create a new translation, I recommend you contact Ning through the 
Help Center at http://help.ning.com and ask whether Ning has 
plans to offer the language you need in the near future.
 
7. When you’re done creating the new translation, simply follow the 
steps discussed earlier (in the “Meeting the Language Editor and 
Choosing a Different Language” section) to choose a different lan-
guage from the Language drop-down list.
Importing a Language from 
one Network into Another
If you’ve taken the road of translating a language for a network you created 
and you’re creating a new network that you want to use the same language 
on, you can also do it through the Language Editor.

286
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
To obtain the language file from your previous network, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Import Your Language File link at the bottom of the 
Language Editor page.
 
 This step takes you to the Advanced Import page, shown in Figure 20-10.
 
Figure 20-10: 
The 
Advanced 
Import 
page lets 
you import

 For example, in the case of my network, I would go to http://net
workfordummies.ning.com/lib/scripts/translations.php.
 
 You’re taken to the Translations page, which contains links to all the 
translations found on your network, as shown in Figure 20-11.
 
Figure 20-11: 
The 
Translations 
page lets 
you down-
load your 
translation 
files.
 

287
 Chapter 20: Using the Language Editor
 
3. Click the link corresponding to the translation file you need.
 
 You’re prompted to choose an application to open it with. A text editor 
such as Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for the Mac should do the 
trick.
 
4. Open the translation file to verify it’s the one you’re looking for and, 
if so, save it on your local hard drive.
 
5. When you have your translation file, go to the Advanced Import page 
and choose the language you want the contents of the file to be added 
to from the Add to Language drop-down list.
 
6. Select the translation file by clicking the Browse button.
 
7. When you’re done, click Upload Language File.
 
 When the upload is done, all the blood, sweat, and tears you put into 
your translation file will be a part of the language you chose to add the 
file to in the new network.

OpenSocial Applications 
in Your Network
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering OpenSocial
▶ Adding and removing Profile apps
▶ Finding out about some great OpenSocial applications
▶ Creating OpenSocial applications
▶ Using Ning apps
O
penSocial saw the light of day in November 2007. Google, along with a 
large number of partners (including most of the main social networking 
sites except for Facebook), developed an interface for social network applica-
tions. That interface enables third-party applications to access member data 
and perform network actions that are generally accessible only to a service’s 
core features. One of my favorite examples of a social network application is 
Reading List by Amazon. Thanks to it, you can share the books you want to 
read, the ones you’re reading, and those you’ve read and recommend with 
your connections on LinkedIn, a popular business-centric social network.
OpenSocial makes features from social networks such as Hi5.com, MySpace, 
orkut, Friendster, and all networks on Ning available to anyone who imple-
ments an OpenSocial application. For example, you could chat with friends 
from multiple networks in your network on Ning, or you could have your status 
from a social network update your status throughout multiple networks.
If this sounds complicated, the following pages should help you understand 
why having Ning support OpenSocial is so important for your network. In this 
chapter, I discuss the basics of OpenSocial, along with the steps you need to 
follow to create, add, or remove OpenSocial applications. I share some of the 
most popular OpenSocial apps and deal briefly with the future of OpenSocial 
on Ning.

290
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
Opening Up with OpenSocial
The concept underlying OpenSocial is fascinating. The OpenSocial API 
acknowledges the fact that people on the Web participate in multiple Web 
sites and social networks. Thus, applications that support OpenSocial can 
run on multiple Web sites.
Likewise, through the applications that support it, OpenSocial can make 
information such as friends in a network; status; preferences in music, film, 
and reading; and so on available from one site to another or allow the aggre-
gation of information in unique and convenient ways.
Being able to visualize and connect with your friends through Google or 
Yahoo! Maps within any OpenSocial-compatible social network; sharing files 
with others in your network (or outside it); and having your status on one 
social network drive the status in your profile page in other networks are 
three examples of things that OpenSocial makes possible.
For OpenSocial developers, the advantages are clear: Having to develop a 
single application that works for multiple Web sites represents an important 
time and money saver.
Lucky for all Network Creators, networks on Ning are compatible with 
OpenSocial. I can only imagine what the future will be like as more applications 
are developed to increase the functionality available to networks on Ning.
Adding and Editing Profile Apps
At the end of this chapter, I deal briefly with Ning Apps, which only Network 
Creators and Administrators can add to the network. However, members can 
add applications to their profiles very easily and then edit those apps. I show 
you how in the following sections.
Adding applications
Adding Profile Apps to your profile page is truly a piece of cake:
 
1. Visit your profile page and click the Add Applications link below your 
profile photo.
 
 This step takes you to the Application Directory, the list of all applica-
tions, shown in Figure 21-1.

291
 Chapter 21: OpenSocial Applications in Your Network
 
Figure 21-1: 
The 
Application 
Directory 
lets you 
browse all 
applications 
and add any 
to your pro-
file page.
 
 
2. On this page, you can do the following things:
 
• View the Recommended applications by clicking the 
Recommended link on the left.
 
• Look at the Most Popular applications by clicking the Most 
Popular link.
 
• Explore all applications by category, clicking the different catego-
ries listed below the Categories heading.
 
• Search for a particular term to see whether there’s an existing 
application that meets your needs.
 
3. When you find an application you want to add, click the Add to My 
Page button below it to add it to your profile page.
 
4. When the prompt appears (see Figure 21-2), confirm whether you 
want to add the application.
 
 This may seem unnecessary to you, but it’s an important step because it 
lets you read the application’s Terms of Use and cancel your request by 
clicking the Cancel button if you don’t agree with them.
 
Figure 21-2: 
This window 
prompts you 
to confirm 
whether 
you agree to 
the applica-
tion’s Terms 
of Use.
 

292
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
 
5. If you agree with the Terms of Use, click the Add Application button 
to complete the process and add it to your profile page.
 
 The new application you’ve added appears at the top of your profile page.
In Figure 21-3, you can see how my profile page looks after I added the Friend 
Map application.
 
Figure 21-3: 
New appli-
cations are 
added at the 
top of your

Below each application on another member’s profile page, there are two 
links, as shown in Figure 21-4:
 
Figure 21-4: 
You can 
easily add

293
 Chapter 21: OpenSocial Applications in Your Network
 
✓ Add to My Page: Clicking this link is equivalent to clicking the Add to 
My Page button in the Application Directory. This link is great to help 
you add an application you want on your own profile page after seeing it 
in action on someone else’s profile page.
 
✓ View Application: Clicking this link takes you to a page where you can 
find out more about the application and add it to your page. Also, this 
page contains a Report Abuse link. Clicking this link lets you report a 
bug, fraud, spam, or other issues with the application. This report sends 
an OpenSocial Abuse Report to the Network Creator and Administrators.
 
 If you click View Application for an application you’ve added, the page 
you arrive on also has a Remove Application link.
Editing your applications
All the applications you add to your profile page have an Edit button at the top 
right. If you want to make changes to your application, here’s what you do:
 
1. Click the Edit button in the application you want to adjust.
 
 A panel opens, giving you a few options to control the display of infor-
mation related to the application and your page, as shown in Figure 21-5. 
You find two check boxes:
 
• Allow this application to add updates in the Latest Activity module 
on My Page
 
• Allow this application to send me and my friends alerts
 
Figure 21-5: 
The Edit 
panel for an 
application

Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
 
2. Select or deselect the check boxes, depending on what you want the 
application to be able to do.
 
3. If you want to remove the box where the application appears in your 
profile page, click the Remove Box link.
 
 The application continues to be accessible through the My Applications 
page. You can get to the My Applications page by clicking the 
Applications link below your profile photo.
 
4. To remove the application from your profile page and your 
Applications altogether, click the Remove Application link.
Manny’s Favorite Profile Apps
Ning offers hundreds of Profile Apps: You can find apps to suit all preferences. 
Here, I present a few applications that I find particularly useful, hoping they 
can help you extend the value you offer through your network. You can find 
any of them by searching for the application name in the Application Directory.
 
✓ Box.net: Enables safe file uploading and file sharing with others in your 
network. This opens incredible avenues for collaboration.
 
✓ Friend Map: Lets you view all your network friends on a Yahoo! map, 
zoom in and out, and navigate throughout the entire map.
 
✓ PollDaddy: Allows members to create polls on their profile pages and 
share them with others in the network.
 
✓ RSS: Combines and displays up to five RSS feeds. This app helps over-
come the limitation of a single RSS feed per profile page.
 
✓ ShopIt: Lets members buy and sell products and services from their pro-
file page and conveniently share product information.
 
✓ Text Box: Gives you one extra text box to include in your profile page, in 
case a single text box is not enough.
 
✓ Unype Virtual World: Lets you chat with members from Facebook, 
MySpace, Bebo, Hi5, Ning, and Orkut on a world map.
 
✓ Ustream.tv: Lets you broadcast video live from your profile page. You 
need only a webcam to take advantage of it.
 
It’s a good idea to pay a visit to the Application Directory periodically to see 
what new applications may have been added recently, which are the most 
popular and typically the highest rated. New applications are created all the 
time, which brings me to the next section of this chapter, dealing with the cre-
ation of Profile Apps.

295
 Chapter 21: OpenSocial Applications in Your Network
Creating Profile Apps
Creating Profile Apps is not for everybody. If you’re a Network Creator, 
nobody expects you to be able to create new OpenSocial apps unless you 
have a background in Web software development with a solid JavaScript and 
HTML foundation.
 
Because OpenSocial development requires more advanced knowledge than 
can be included in this chapter, I don’t discuss technical details about 
OpenSocial application creation here. I recommend you follow the advice in 
this section in order to arm yourself with the tools you need to develop your 
own applications.
If you have what it takes, you should start by join the Ning Developer 
Network at http://developer.ning.com, shown in Figure 21-6. This net-
work has thousands of members constantly discussing OpenSocial applica-
tion development.
Also, in the Ning Developer Network you can find all the documentation you 
need in order to create your application. If you click the big Create Your 
Application button on the main page of the network or select the Submit an 
Application option under Profile Apps in the network navigation, you’re taken 
to the Submissions page.
 
Figure 21-6: 
The Ning 
Developer 
Network is 
an excellent 
resource for 
developers.
 

296
Part V: Advanced Tips and Tricks 
When you’re not signed into the network, the Submissions page lets you access 
the OpenSocial Documentation by clicking the Learn More! link at the bottom 
of the page. At all times, you can also access the documentation within the 
OpenSocial option in the Resources menu of the network navigation.
When you’re done creating your OpenSocial application, you need to submit 
it for approval. You need to be signed into the network in order to submit an 
application for review.
Go to the Submissions page, as explained earlier. The Submissions page 
you’re taken to appears, as shown in Figure 21-7. Any previously approved 
applications you’ve submitted appear at the top of the page, such as the 
Blood Glucose Units Converter application, developed by Bernard Farrell, as 
you can see in Figure 21-7.
Below any previous applications, there’s a text box where you can enter the 
URL to your OpenSocial application file. Paste the address where the applica-
tion is found into the New Application text box and click the Add button.
The application gets submitted for consideration, and if it gets approved, you 
get notified via e-mail when it’s added to the Application Directory. If any-
thing about the application needs to be changed, you also get notified about 
what needs to be corrected. After you’ve made the necessary changes, you 
can resubmit the application by following the same steps.

 Chapter 21: OpenSocial Applications in Your Network
Networkwide Ning Apps
By the time you read this, Ning Apps should be available. These are network-
wide OpenSocial applications that give Network Creators the ability to add 
new features and functionality to their networks.
Any Ning App you add to your network becomes seamlessly added to your 
main page and also has its own tab, just like any other feature on your net-
work. The only difference is that Ning Apps may have been developed by 
Ning, or they may have been developed by third-party developers.
To find out more about Ning Apps, make sure to review the Ning resources in

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
f you’re thinking of making money from your network, 
this part is for you. I discuss ten ways to help you mon-
etize your network.
If Part V didn’t give you enough advanced tips and tricks 
and you feel the need for more technical challenges, I 
offer some hacks to make your network stand out from 
the crowd, as well as ten tools to help you run a network 
on Ning.
The last chapter in this part offers a list of ten ideas for 
networks on Ning (just in case you’re having trouble pick-
ing one for yourself).

Chapter 22
Ten Ways to Monetize 
Your Network
C
hances are good that you want to run your network to simply help con-
nect other like-minded people without any thought of making money off 
it, and that’s perfectly fine. However, it’s also fine if you want to make money 
off your network. In this chapter, I discuss ten potential ways to monetize 
your network on Ning.
Running Ads through an Ad Network
Though it’s not free, the easiest way to monetize your network is to run ads 
on your network. One of the most popular ways to run ads is to sign up for an 
ad network such as Google AdSense. The advantage of doing this is simple: 
The ad network analyzes the content in the pages of your network and 
inserts the most appropriate ads into each page, depending on the page’s 
content. All you need to do is sign up, obtain the code, and plug it in your 
network, as I explain in Chapter 18.
Google AdSense may be the most popular advertising network, but it is cer-
tainly not the only one. Doing a cursory search on Google (how ironic!) for 
ad network returns more options than you will ever have time to explore. 
If you’re lucky, you may find an ad network specifically suited to your net-
work’s niche. Specialized ad networks are known for getting higher returns 
than generic ones like AdSense.
Whatever you do, before you add any code you obtain from your ad network, 
you must sign up for the Control the Ads premium service, as discussed in 
Chapter 18.

302
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Selling Your Own Ads
When you run ads from an advertising network, the network retains a portion 
of the money advertisers pay. If you want to get an even higher return for 
your ads, you can sell your own ads.
 
I would not recommend this option unless you can afford to manage direct 
relationships with advertisers, giving them the kind of time and attention they 
expect for their money.
This option also does not typically work well for networks with fewer than 
2,000 members or fewer than 300,000 page views. (You can find out about 
your page views by using Google Analytics, as explained in Chapter 16.) At 
lower membership and traffic levels, you may be able to sell ads to small 
advertisers, but larger advertisers may not see an incentive to carry an ad 
on what they see as a small Web site. So until you network has grown signifi-
cantly, ads from an advertising network may be your best bet.
For you to be able to sell your own ads, you need to purchase the Control the 
Ads premium service (see Chapter 18).
Using Ads as Fixed Background Images
In Chapter 19, I give an example of using CSS to make your network’s background 
image fixed so that it doesn’t move when visitors scroll down on the page.
A good use of this CSS example is to offer advertisers the background image 
as a space where they can place their ad. The downside of this option is that 
users can’t click it, so you can’t direct click-through traffic elsewhere with 
this approach.
You can think of this option as something similar to a billboard on the street: 
It can be used to promote a product or service that can be purchased offline 
or over the phone.
Working with Affiliate Programs
Affiliate or referral programs are older than the Web. The concept is simple: 
For each sale or lead you refer to another vendor or site, you get paid a 
commission. Some vendors have their own affiliate programs (for example, 

303
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Monetize Your Network
Amazon.com has Amazon Advantage). Others sign up as part of affiliate net-
works like LinkShare and Commission Junction. These networks represent 
thousands of vendors under multiple categories.
After you sign up with an affiliate program, you’re required to include a code 
of some kind (not unlike the case of advertising networks) in your network. 
The main difference with ad networks is that ad networks pay a little bit for 
every click on ads that you carry in your network. Affiliate programs may pay 
more money, but you see the money only if people click the ad and purchase 
a product or service in connection with it. Otherwise, you don’t get any 
payoff from the click.
If you include any kind of ads on your network as part of an affiliate program 
you’re part of, you need to purchase the Control the Ads premium service 
(see Chapter 18).
Charging a Network Membership Fee
As you know by now, it costs nothing to create or become a member of a net-
work on Ning. However, you can charge a membership fee for people to sign 
up to your network if you want. You can do this by setting up your network 
so you can moderate new members, as explained in Chapter 10. Before you 
approve new members, you can send them the details about the membership 
fee, directing them to a site through which you collect fees, such as PayPal or 
Google Checkout.
 
Think before you charge for being a member of your network. Consider why 
would someone pay to join: Are you offering something really unique? Perhaps 
members in your network can mingle with others whom they would otherwise 
never be able to hang out with, and that alone is worth the price tag. Just make 
sure you’re offering something worth paying for before you charge for a mem-
bership fee. Otherwise, you risk not getting people signing up to your network.
Charging Group Membership Fees
An alternative version of the network membership fee option is to charge 
group membership fees. One or more groups on your network may offer spe-
cial benefits that members would be willing to pay for. Using this method, 
you can have tiered membership on your network where all members have 
access to most of the network and those who want access to other premium 
benefits can pay to join the group(s) where these benefits are available.

304
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Until Ning offers a tiered membership option, you can implement this by 
setting up a group with moderated membership, as explained in Chapter 6. 
Before you approve new members, you can charge them the group member-
ship fee by taking similar steps to the ones explained in the previous subsec-
tion for the network membership fee alternative.
Asking for Donations
Although donations may be an option to monetize networks that may be 
better suited for networks that are not for profit, don’t underestimate the 
potential for generating revenue this way. If you do a good job with your net-
work, your members may be willing to make a small donation to support your 
efforts.
To recognize donors that help your network, you can list them on a Notes 
page, which you can set up as explained in Chapter 11.
To facilitate the collection of donations, you can add a nice-looking PayPal 
Donate button like the one shown in Figure 22-1. You can add the button to a 
Text Box on your main page, as explained in Chapter 9.
 
Figure 22-1: 
PayPal 
Donate but-
tons make 
collection of 
donations 
very easy.
 
Selling Merchandise
Selling merchandise that sports your network’s logo is not only a good way 
to monetize your network, but also a great way to promote it because people 
who buy merchandise normally wear it (in the case of T-shirts, hats, and 
bags) and carry it around and use it (as with mugs, buttons, and other forms 
of swag).

305
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Monetize Your Network
 
One of the most convenient ways to sell network merchandise is to sign up for 
services such as CafePress (www.cafepress.com) or Zazzle (www.zazzle.
com). They let you design your own items, set up an online store, and promote 
the store through your network by using code you can include in a Text Box. 
For every item that sells in your online store, the service pays you a commis-
sion. The service takes care of manufacturing and shipping of the orders.
You can also design and order your own merchandise to sell it yourself, 
so you can potentially make a bigger profit. The downsides of this are 
obvious: You need to keep an inventory, which costs you money, and you 
have to take care of the fulfillment of the orders, which also costs money 
and takes time away from your running the network. However, this may be a 
good option for you if you can afford it.
Applying for Grants
Grants can come from government sources as well as private foundations. 
Though many grants are directed to nonprofit organizations, not all of them 
are: Some grants are intended for small businesses.
As more and more attention is being paid to social media as a viable channel 
to create social change these days, you may find that you qualify for grants to 
help develop your social network on Ning.
Performing a search for grants or small business grants in a search engine 
returns a very large number of results that you need to sort through to find 
the options that are suited to your unique situation.
Future Options through OpenSocial
In Chapter 21, I discuss OpenSocial applications, including a brief mention of 
OpenSocial network applications. One of the applications I mention is ShopIt, 
an application that lets you and your members buy and sell products and ser-
vices through your network.
New ways to monetize your social network on Ning may become available in 
the near term thanks to the rollout of OpenSocial network apps, letting you 
monetize your network in new and creative ways.

Chapter 23
Almost Ten Ways to Make 
Your Network Rock
T
hroughout this book, I show you how to join, participate in, create, cus-
tomize, manage, and promote a network on Ning. This chapter gives you 
a few more tools to help make your network rock!
A few of the tips discussed next require that you install tracking code hacks, 
which are pieces of code (typically JavaScript) that must be included along-
side any tracking code you may have added to your network’s Analytics 
page, as explained in Chapter 16.
I denote where you must install the hacks with the words tracking code 
hacks in bold. (I don’t want you to miss it!) For your convenience, here are 
the steps you must follow to install tracking code hacks:
 
1. Click the Manage link in your network’s navigation.
 
2. Click the Analytics option under the Your Network heading.
 
3. Add the code included in this chapter (corresponding to the hack you 
want to apply) into your tracking code box.
 
 Make sure you do not overwrite any existing code you find in the box 
(unless that is what you want to do).
 
4. Click the Save button.
Redirecting Your Network 
to Your Own Domain
As discussed in Chapter 18, when you purchase and configure the Use Your 
Own Domain premium service, it ensures that visitors who enter your domain 
name are taken to your network. However, your network continues to be 
reachable through its .ning.com address. To make sure any visits to your 
network are directed to your own domain, follow the steps in this section.

308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Make sure to do this only after you can access your network at yourdomain.
com. If you take these steps before you can access your network at your
domain.com, your social network may become inaccessible.
 
1. Sign in to the network as the Network Creator.
 
2. Visit http://YOURNETWORKNAME.ning.com/admin/index/edit
DomainRedirection. 
 
 For example, in the case of TuDiabetes, I would go to http://tu
diabetes.ning.com/admin/index/editDomainRedirection.
 
 You’re taken to the Domain Redirection page, as shown in Figure 23-1.
 
3. From the Redirect To drop-down list, select the domain you want your 
network’s visitors to be redirected to automatically.
 
4. Click the Save button.
 
Figure 23-1: 
The Domain 
Redirection 
page lets 
you send all 
visits to your 
network to 
your own 
domain.
 
Adding a New Page
Occasionally, you may need to add JavaScript code or an iFrame to a static 
page on your network, or you may want to enable comments at the bottom 
of a static page. You can’t accomplish either of these things through the use 
of Notes. Here’s where Pages come in handy, something you can add to your 
network using the Tab Manager, which I explain in Chapter 8.
The ability to create and edit pages is a beta feature, meaning that you may 
still run into a bug here or there. But for the most part, they do what they’re 
intended for. So if you need to create a new page, follow these steps:
 
1. Go through the steps to add a new tab, as explained in the last section 
of Chapter 8.

309
 Chapter 23: Almost Ten Ways to Make Your Network Rock
 
2. In the Tab Information section, select the Create New Page option and 
click the Save Tab Settings button. 
 
 This step adds the new page to your navigation based on where you 
placed the tab.
 
3. Click the tab in your navigation to go to the newly created page.
 
4. On the new page, click the Edit link to edit the page.
 
5. Type or paste any content or code you may have at hand into the 
page’s text box.
 
6. Click the Update Page button when you’re done.
Having a Flash Header
If you want to replace the image in your network header with an Adobe Flash 
(SWF) animation, you can do it with this tracking code hack. The Flash 
movie file needs to be 959 pixels wide by 179 pixels high.
 
1. Write a blog post and upload the SWF file to it using the Upload File 
button.
 
2. When the post is live, right-click the SWF file and copy the link to it. 
 
 The URL begins with http://api.ning.com/files. 
 
3. You no longer need the blog post, so you can delete it.
 
4. In the following code, substitute the http://API_LINK URL for the URL 
you just copied:
<script type=”text/javascript”><!--
/**
 * Tracking Code Hack: Replace the Header of the 
network with a swf
**/
 
var headerSwfUrl    = “http://API_LINK”;
var headerSwfWidth  = 959;
var headerSwfHeight = 179;
var newHeaderHtml   = ‘<embed src=”’+headerSwfUrl+’” 
width=”’+headerSwfWidth+’” 
height=”’+headerSwfHeight+’” 
type=”application/x-shockwave-flash” 
pluginspage=”http://www.macromedia.com/go/
getflashplayer <http://www.macromedia.com/go/
getflashplayer> “> </embed>’;

310
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
var headerElement   = document.getElementById(‘xg_
masthead’);
 
//replace the old header with the new one
headerElement.innerHTML = newHeaderHtml;
 
//change the id as a simple way to remove all css 
attached to it
headerElement.id    = ‘newheader’;
//-->
</script>
 
5. Copy the entire code with the new URL you just substituted into the 
tracking code box, as explained in the beginning of the chapter.
 
6. Click the Save button to finish.
Adding a Horizontal Banner 
to Your Network
If you pay for the Control the Ads premium service, you may want to run a 
horizontal banner that extends across the top of your network. The following 
two tracking code hacks let you insert a banner (or any other content, for 
that matter) below the thin strip with the search box at the top of your net-
work or below the network navigation, as shown in Figure 23-2.
 
Figure 23-2: 
You can add 
a banner or 
any other 
content 
below the 
colored strip 
at the top or 
below the 
navigation.
 
Below the strip with the search box
Copy the following code into the tracking code box, substituting 
HEADLINER_HTML with the HTML and CSS that you’d like to display below 
the thin strip with the search box at the very top of your network.

311
 Chapter 23: Almost Ten Ways to Make Your Network Rock
<script language=”JavaScript”>
//insert under the colored strip at the top, below the 
navigation only if it exists
var ningBar = document.getElementById(‘xn_bar’);
if(ningBar) {
    var headlinerAd = document.createElement(‘div’);
    headlinerAd.id=’headliner_ad’;
    headlinerAd.innerHTML = ‘HEADLINER_HTML’;
    ningBar.parentNode.insertBefore(headlinerAd,ningBar.
nextSibling);
}
</script>
Below the network navigation
Copy the following code into the tracking code box, replacing HEADLINER_
HTML with the HTML and CSS that you’d like to display below the navigation:
<script language=”JavaScript”>
var insertionPoint = document.getElementById(‘xg_head’);
//if the exceptin ID exists we abort 
var exceptionElement = document.getElementById(‘signin_
email’);
if((exceptionElement == null) && insertionPoint) {
    var bannerAdHtml = ‘HEADLINER_HTML’;
    insertionPoint.innerHTML += bannerAdHtml;
}
</script>
 
A cool use of this tracking hack is to post Urgent Announcements in a way 
similar to CNN Breaking News.
Opening RSS Links in a New Window
By default, any links in an RSS box on your network’s main page open on the 
same window you are on. As a result, anyone clicking them effectively leaves 
your network’s main page.
This tracking code hack lets you change this, so all links in all RSS boxes on 
the main page of your network open in a new window. Simply insert this code 
into your network’s tracking code box:
<script language=”JavaScript”>
x$(document).ready(function() {
  x$(‘.module_feed’).find(“a”).attr(“target”, “_blank” );   
});
</script>

312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Speeding Up Load Time of Static Files 
If you have images, scripts, and other static files, you can speed up their load 
time significantly by storing them in your network’s xn_resources folder. 
Anything stored in this folder is optimized for faster download. To take 
advantage of the xn_resources folder, follow these steps:
 
1. Connect to your network’s file system using WebDav, as explained on 
this page: 
http://tinyurl.com/ningfordummieswebdav
 
2. Click the xn_resources folder and create a new folder. 
 
 For example, if you want to save static images, you can create one called 
images.
 
3. Drag and drop all files you want to optimize for faster download into 
the new folder. 
 
4. Anywhere the newly uploaded files appear, change the link that 
points to them.
 
 The new URL where you can download these files can be found at 
http://static.ning.com/yournetwork/newfolder/filename. 
For example, an image file named logo.jpg uploaded to a new images 
folder in the xn_resources folder for TuDiabetes would be available at
http://static.ning.com/tudiabetes/images/logo.jpg
Adding a Favicon
Favicons are those cute little icons that appear on your browser’s address 
bar when you visit some Web sites. They also appear in your bookmarks if 
you bookmark the Web site.
By default, your social network’s network icon will be applied as its favicon 
(only smaller). However, you can also add a different favicon to your social 
network by following these easy steps:
 
1. Create a favicon for your network. 
 
 You can either do it yourself (it’s a 16x16 image saved in the ICO format) 
or, more conveniently, do a Google search for create a favicon and use 
any of the resources listed in the results to help you create it.
 
2. Click the Manage link in your navigation and click the Network 
Information link under the Your Network heading.

313
 Chapter 23: Almost Ten Ways to Make Your Network Rock
 
3. In the Set Favicon section of the Network Information page, click the 
Browse button to find the recently created .ico file in your computer. 
 
 The Network Information page is shown in Figure 23-3.
 
4. Click the Save button.
 
Figure 23-3:

you add a 
favicon and 
many more 
things.
 
Changing Your Default Profile Photo
The default profile photo gets displayed when a new member hasn’t 
uploaded his or her own profile photo. You can choose what this photo looks 
like, further customizing your network. Follow these steps to change your 
default profile photo:
 
1. Go to the Network Information page (to get there, see Step 2 in the 
preceding section).
 
2. In the Set Profile Photo section of the Network Information page, click 
the Browse button.
 
3. In the window that appears, find on your computer the profile photo 
you want to use as a default and click the Open button.
 
4. Click the Save button.

Preventing Members from Modifying 
Their Profile Pages
I am all for letting members do with their profile pages as they please. 
However, you may have some good reasons to disable their ability to pimp 
out their pages. If this is the case, the following steps can help you accom-
plish just that:
 
1. Click the Manage link in your navigation and click the Feature 
Controls link under the Your Members heading.
 
2. Deselect the check box next to Allow Members to Change Their My 
Page Theme if you want to prevent them from changing the way the 
look and feel of their profile pages.
 
3. Deselect the check box next to Allow members to adjust their My Page 
layout if you want to prevent them from moving feature boxes around 
their profile pages.
 
4. Click the Save button.

Ten Handy Tools to Help 
You Run Your Network
E
very industry and trade has a recommended brand or a power tool that 
everyone in the know takes advantage of. Being a member or running a 
network on Ning is no exception to this.
This chapter gives you nine programs or plug-ins and a hardware item that 
make your life as a member or a Network Creator easier, starting from the 
most basic ones to the most sophisticated.
Firefox
www.firefox.com
I have to hand it to Microsoft: Internet Explorer has improved dramatically 
in the past few years. However, my heart has a very special place for Firefox. 
This is not an emotional decision: Firefox is a very stable, fast, and safe 
browser, and there are some very powerful extensions developed for Firefox 
that are simply not available for Internet Explorer. Firebug (mentioned later 
on) is one such extension.
Flash Player
www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer
There’s a good chance that you don’t need to worry about installing Flash 
Player because most of the world’s Internet user have it on their computers. 
However, Flash is not only a nice-to-have application, but also a necessity 
when you run a network on Ning. Network features such as the video player 
require Flash to even appear on your screen.

316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Java
http://java.com/getjava
Just like you need to have Flash Player to run some features on your network, 
to use the bulk uploading option for photos, videos, and music explained in 
Chapter 4, you need to make sure you install Sun’s Java Runtime Engine.
A Text Editor
Though any text editor can do the job, Notepad and TextEditor natively come 
loaded with Windows and Mac OS, respectively. They come in handy when 
working with your network’s CSS, Language Editor or adding any code to 
a Text Box in your network, to make editing tasks more comfortable to 
perform.
Firebug
http://getfirebug.com
In Chapter 19, I discuss CSS for your network on Ning. Firebug is a fascinating 
Firefox extension that allows you to inspect a Web site’s CSS by placing your 
cursor over the element you want to find out about and make edits to the CSS 
in a non-permanent way that lets you see how those changes would appear.
A Video Converter
Windows: www.videora.com
Mac: www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/19769/isquint
As explained in Chapter 4, you may find yourself needing to convert your 
videos to a format supported by Ning. Two applications that are well suited 
for this task are iSquint for Mac and Videora for PC.

317
 Chapter 24: Ten Handy Tools to Help You Run Your Network
An Audio Converter
www.apple.com/itunes
The same way a video converter comes in handy for videos, an audio con-
verter is helpful for audio files because your network’s Music Player supports 
only MP3 files. One of the best programs you can get to help you convert 
audio files (and much more) is iTunes, which is available for both Mac and 
Windows platforms.
A Tool for Screenshots
Windows: www.wikihow.com/Take-a-Screenshot-in-Microsoft-
Windows
Mac: http://skitch.com
When members communicate with you or you communicate with them or with 
Ning to get help with an issue, having screenshots makes the process easier.
To take screenshots in a Windows computer, you can follow the steps on 
the www.wikihow.com page. A great solution to obtain (and comment on) 
screenshots for the Mac is Skitch.
A Digital Video Editor
Mac: www.apple.com/ilife
Linux: www.kinodv.org
If you run a network on Ning, you might as well dust off that webcam because 
video gives you an excellent means to offer unique content and connect with 
your members. To make your videos look good, get a digital video editor.
Most Windows computers have Movie Maker natively installed. You can 
download a free copy from here:
www.download.com/Windows-Movie-Maker-Windows-Vista-/
3000-13631_4-10729231.html

318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
For Apple computers, you can get iMovie, which is part of the Apple iLife 
suite. Linux users can count on Kino Video Editor.
Dual Monitors
This last tool is not a program or a plug-in but a hardware accessory. If you 
haven’t tried working with two monitors, you don’t know what you’re missing. 
Well beyond the “cool” factor, using two monitors expands the space avail-
able for you to spread windows on, ultimately increasing your productivity.

Ten Ideas for a Network on Ning
You’ve gotten to the end of the book. In case you still don’t have an idea 
of what you can start a network about, in this last chapter I give you ten 
ideas for starting your own network on Ning.
To Reconnect with Classmates
Everyone has classmates, whether they be from high school, college, grad 
school, or even grade school. Ning gives you a great place for you to run a 
magnificent social network where you can catch up on stories about your 
long-lost friends from school and their whereabouts.
To Share with Other Fans
Whether you’re a die-hard rocker or love the latest pop idol, whether you 
love classic literature or modern books, whether you love football or base-
ball, you surely are a fan of something. Guess what? You’re not alone, and if 
someone hasn’t done it, you can start a social network to connect with all 
those other fans out there.
To Rally People around a Campaign
If you’re running for office or you support a candidate in an election, a net-
work on Ning provides you with a great vehicle to coordinate volunteers and 
drive fundraising efforts.

320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
To Connect with Other Patients
This is how I became involved with Ning. TuDiabetes.com and EsTuDiabetes.
com connects people touched by diabetes. You can connect patients with all 
kinds of chronic conditions and ailments.
To Communicate with Your Students
If you teach a class in school, you and your students can benefit from being 
a part of social network. Communication in the network can reinforce and 
improve the classroom experience. 
Find out more about these kinds of networks at
www.classroom.com
To Raise Awareness about a Cause
Whether you are fighting global warming or defending human rights, you can 
connect with others like you through a network on Ning, letting you spread 
the roots of your cause like wildfire.
A good example of this kind of network is
http://alternativeenergy.com
To Network with Other Professionals
People today are super busy with career and family. It’s difficult to find time to 
meet and connect with professionals who are in your line of work. Enter Ning. 
Many professionals are able to network with others who work in the same line 
of business through a network on Ning. What could be more convenient?

 Chapter 25: Ten Ideas for a Network on Ning
To Offer a Space for Online Learning
You can combine the features offered by a network on Ning with other out-
side resources to offer a very complete online learning experience. 
For example, this network helps Brazilians learn English online:
http://verdeamarelo.ning.com
To Help Conference Attendees Network
The bigger the conference, the more overwhelming it feels. But it doesn’t 
have to be that way: Conference attendees can successfully connect and 
share tips about the event outside the venue and after hours through a net-
work on Ning. People who have attended SXSW and MacWorld know it.
http://sxsw.ning.com/
http://macworldexpo.ning.com/
To Discuss Your Favorite Movies
Maybe you’re an all out movie buff. Or you care about the classics. Or 
instead, you prefer foreign or independent movies. Whatever your prefer-
ence, you can set up a network on Ning for it. 
A great example of a movie review network is

To help you stay on top of the latest and greatest that Ning has to offer in an 
ongoing basis, I recommend you check out the following resources regularly. 
If you use some kind of RSS reader, all of them offer RSS feeds so you can 
keep tabs on them.
Each of the sites I discuss here has its own reason for being. I highly recom-
mend you check them out regularly to reap the benefits each of them has to 
offer.
Ning Blog
http://blog.ning.com
The Ning Blog is updated up to three to four times per day. Many blog posts 
feature networks on Ning. The Ning folks highlight the elements they find 
appealing about each network they feature, so you may learn from the best 
examples around. Considering the number of networks that cross their paths 
on a daily basis, getting featured on the Ning Blog is quite a feat!
Besides featuring outstanding networks on Ning, the Ning Blog offers the 
following:
 
✓ Regular posts that explain new features or feature updates in great 
detail. This is done well before features are rolled out; as feature 
releases approach, so you may know when to expect them; and once 
features have been made available to the networks.
 
✓ Valuable tricks to show you how to make the most of the platform.
 
✓ Space for Ning to make company announcements.

Ning Help
http://help.ning.com
If you have problems or questions about your network, don’t call 
Ghostbusters! (Okay, that was a bad joke. . . .) Go to the Ning Help Center.
The Ning Help Center is a well-thought-out resource to help you get the 
answers to your questions about your network. It offers access to informa-
tion in multiple ways:
 
✓ Search: You can find answers by entering keyword(s) in a search box. 
The results you get all contain the keyword(s) you entered.
 
✓ Browse: You can browse categories by diving into topical areas and read-
ing the titles of all the questions that pertain to the same kind of issue.
 
✓ Drill down: You can go into issues that pertain to Network Creators, 
Administrators, network members, or visitors.
 
✓ Contact Ning: If you still can’t find an answer to your question, you can 
fill out the Contact Us form. The folks at Ning are amazingly fast at reply-
ing to inquiries.
So now that you know: Who you gonna call? Er . . . visit . . . well, you know!
Network Creators Network
http://networkcreators.ning.com
The Network Creators network is an ideal network on Ning for Network 
Creators to join. The folks at Ning are “eating their own dog food,” which 
speaks volumes about their commitment to the product they offer.
The network isn’t set up as typical network in a couple of respects:
 
✓ The forum contains a very long archive of topics from a period during 
which it was one of the mechanisms that Network Creators employed to 
reports issues or ask questions. All the content in the forum is still there 
and searchable, so you can find lots of answers to your questions in it too.
 
✓ Photos are not enabled, and videos are only one way. They haven’t 
made the photos feature available: There is no need for it on this kind 
of network. The videos feature is enabled, but it has been renamed 
Screencasts and is set up to moderate videos submitted. Ultimately, 
folks use it to post screencasts detailing new feature releases.

 Appendix: Ning Resources
Besides these two particulars, this is a great network that every Network 
Creator should sign up for. Here are some of the benefits it offers:
 
✓ Tutorials: The Notes section is structured as a container for several 
great tutorials that you should not miss.
 
✓ Groups: More than a hundred different groups gather Network Creators 
around common interests. There are groups for designers, groups about 
Web analytics, groups in Spanish, and — the biggest and best group of 
all — Ning For Dummies! Yep, I’m not kidding.
 
✓ Members: As networks on Ning grow, so does this network. At last 
count, it had more than 22,000 members, but by the time you read this 
book, it will likely be much bigger. The members are all folks who are 
on the same boat as you, so it makes sense to connect with and learn 
from them.
 
✓ Preview: One of the coolest things in the network is the Preview section. 
In it, Ning shares info ahead of feature releases: You get full-size screen 
shots and detailed accounts of how new features or feature updates are 
going to look like, so you know what to expect and won’t be caught by 
surprise.
It’s very valuable. It’s free. There is absolutely no reason why you should 
postpone signing up for the Network Creators network.
Ning Developer Network
http://developer.ning.com
This is another network on Ning. I discuss it in Chapter 21 as part of the dis-
cussion about OpenSocial.
This is another network that every Network Creator should consider joining, 
though it’s not necessarily for everyone. You don’t have to be a developer 
to join, but it helps since a lot of the discussion revolves around specific 
developer-related topics.
The discussion forum is structured around the following categories:
 
✓ OpenSocial Development and Application Support
 
✓ Announcements
 
✓ HTML, CSS, and Design Help
 
✓ PHP, API, and Documentation
 
✓ “How To” / Hacks

326
Ning For Dummies 
 
✓ General Discussion
 
✓ Development Services Needed
 
✓ Development Services Offered
The notes page on the network has been used beautifully to offer numerous 
resources for developers and network creators alike.
The Developer Network contains the documentation for OpenSocial develop-
ment, the Application Directory, and the mechanism to submit new 
applications.
Ning Status Blog
http://status.ning.com
The last element in the list of Ning resources is the Ning Status Blog. At first 
inspection, this blog may appear to be one of those blogs that people start 
and eventually stop contributing to. Don’t let this appearance deceive you.
After you’ve launched your network, the Ning Status Blog gives you perhaps 
the most critical pieces of information about the systems that make it pos-
sible for your network to be up and running.
This blog is communicates with Network Creators, Administrators, and curi-
ous members:
 
✓ When a release or scheduled maintenance is under way: These events 
are announced ahead of time through the Ning Blog and also through a 
broadcast message to all members of the Network Creators network. In 
the course of the maintenance or release session, the Status Blog is the 
first place for you to keep an eye on because it contains all the detail you 
may need to be informed yourself and keep your members current about 
things. When the activity is over, the Status Blog will let you know with a 
post titled something along the lines of “Tonight’s release is complete!”
 
✓ When some or all networks on Ning are experiencing issues or are 
offline due to some technical issue: In times like these (which are very 
rare), you learn to appreciate the Status Blog very much. The Ning folks 
keep it updated with the status and the extent of the situation. They 
also normally include a time by which you should expect to see a new 
update. Finally, after the issue has been resolved, you should see a post 
titled something like “All networks are online and speedy” to let you 
know all is back to normal.
