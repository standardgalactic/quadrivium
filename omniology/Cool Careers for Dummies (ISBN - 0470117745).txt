About the Author
Marty Nemko has several cool careers. In his 20th year as career coach, he’s
served more than 2,500 clients. U.S. News & World Report called him “Career
coach extraordinaire.” The San Francisco Bay Guardian named him “The Bay
Area’s Best Career Coach.” He enjoys a 97 percent client-satisfaction rate.
He’s Contributing Editor for career issues at U.S. News & World Report and
career columnist for Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine and for the
Mensa Bulletin. Before going national, his column appeared in the Sunday
Los Angeles Times and San Francisco Chronicle.
He’s the author of 500+ well-published articles and five commercially and crit-
ically successful books, including the All-in-One College Guide, a consumer
advocate’s guide to choosing, getting into, finding the money for, and making
the most of college.
He’s in his 18th year as producer and host of Work with Marty Nemko, on a
National Public Radio affiliate in San Francisco.
He’s hosted a nationwide PBS pledge-drive special, Eight Steps to a Better
Worklife, and been a repeat guest on major TV and radio shows, including
the Today show and CNN Headline News Comcast Local Edition, on which he
now appears daily. He has been the primary interview source for dozens
of articles, including those in The New York Times, Washington Post, and
Wall Street Journal.
He holds a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, and subsequently
taught there.
He’s the hybridizer of six commercially introduced no-spray roses; they don’t
require spraying for disease.
Believe it or not, he finds time for hobbies. In 2006, he starred in a San Francisco
Bay Area production of Neil Simon’s Broadway Bound, in which he played the
cheating husband opposite his real-life wife. At that show, he also played the
pre-show music on the piano. (He has played more than 2,000 professional
jobs as a pianist.) In summer 2007, he directs the play Same Time Next Year.
Marty’s first job: New York City taxicab driver.
Marty’s Web site, www.martynemko.com, offers 500+ of his published articles
for free. If you want to be coached, by phone or in person, by Marty or one of
his personally selected and trained associates, e-mail him a brief description
of your situation at mnemko@comcast.net.


Dedication
To my parents. As teenagers, they were wrested from their home in Poland
and into concentration camps. After the war, they were placed on a cargo
ship and dropped in New York City with no money, no family, no education,
no English, but plenty of Holocaust scars. Despite it all, they succeeded.
For them, work — even though they didn’t have cool careers — was their
healer. They are my inspiration.
Author’s Acknowledgments
To the thousands of my clients and callers to my radio show who taught me
much of what is in this book.
To Paul and Sarah Edwards, for their significant contributions to the self-
employment chapter.
To the book’s wise reviewers: Jim Gonyea, career forums host on America
Online; Marilyn Maze, director of career products for American College
Testing; the queen of online career searching: The Riley Guide’s Margaret
Riley Dikel; and a guy who painstakingly reviewed every word of this edition,
my colleague Steve Piazzale.
To other people whose ideas enrich these pages: Michael Scriven, Greg Stock,
Warren Farrell, Michael Edelstein, Bob Karr, David Brodwin, Allan Gold, David
Wilens, Rick Newman, Miriam Weinstein, Jeffrie Givens, Becky Washington,
Arthur Jensen, Harvey Davidson, Walter Block, Libby Pannwitt, Lynaire
McGovern, Jared Taylor, Julie Petrie, Jackie Strellis, Robin Happy, and the
dean of career experts, the author of What Color Is Your Parachute, Dick Bolles.
Thanks, John Jones, for your reassurances.
To the good people at Wiley: Editors Lindsay Lefevere, Georgette Beatty, and
Sarah Faulkner for being consummate professionals while always friendly and
tactful. I especially appreciate Lindsay’s telling me, before I started writing
this edition, that I was one of the best For Dummies authors. That motivated
me to try to live up to her expectations. I have had a number of publishers,
and you guys are, by far, the best. Consumer Dummies rocks!
And finally, my dear wife, Barbara Nemko, not just for having contributed a
great chapter to this book and offering suggestions on the rest of this manu-
script, but for being a model for all of us to aspire to. I love you, forever.

Foreword
T
here’s a big, big world out there, with a lot of things to choose from. But
you already know that, or you wouldn’t be reading/browsing/eyeballing
this book about cool careers. Hmmmm.
In the matter of choosing a career, there are thousands of possibilities for you
to explore. You want, of course, to find someone who can cut the number of
possibilities down to manageable size. Welcome to Cool Careers For Dummies,
a veritable encyclopedia. It’s just what you were looking for. 
Encyclopedias of careers come in two forms. One form is that of a book or
some related database. The other form is that of a person. Yep, some people
are “walking encyclopedias.” They know more about all the options that are
available out there than ten other people put together. If you want to read
a book that is a kind of all-encompassing encyclopedia of your options, be
sure — always — that it is first of all written by a person who is a walking
encyclopedia.
Marty Nemko, the author of this book, is just such a person. I have known
Marty for years, and I am always amazed at all the things he knows, and
knows about. Just read his “Yellow Pages,” and you will see. The scope of
his knowledge is breathtaking. He knows big facts and also little facts that
no one else seems to know. 
A walking encyclopedia isn’t just concerned with information. A good walking
encyclopedia is concerned with something deeper that I think we must call
“wisdom.” It involves selection, evaluation, matching, discrimination (in the
good sense of that word), and large gobs of graciousness. Yep, that’s Marty.
Read this book. Use this book. Study this book. You’re in good hands, I guar-
antee you.

Introduction
A
number of years ago, I heard about a little-known career called child life
specialist. When children must go to the hospital for an extended stay,
they’re assigned a child life specialist to help them adapt to living without
their parents.
When I told a client about this career, something happened that had rarely
occurred with previous clients: her eyes lit up.
That helped me realize what people most want from career counseling: new
options. So, I started collecting cool careers. Every time I heard of an interest-
ing career, I added it to the list. I included unusual careers as well as neat
niches within the popular careers. One example: lawyers who specialize in
outer space issues. Plus, I included low-risk/high-payoff ideas for self-employ-
ment. After a few years, my list contained more than 500 careers.
This book contains a quick scoop on each of those careers. Each scoop
focuses on the non-obvious insider information about that career and ends
with a great Web site and/or book in case you want to learn more about that
career.
The book also gives you, for free, the strategies that my private career coun-
seling clients pay me big bucks for. These approaches have been the most
helpful in choosing a career, in landing a job, and in making the most of it. I
developed many of these strategies because, for many people, the standard
career advice wasn’t working.
And that’s the book in a nutshell. Its ideas have helped many, many people
find a cool career, including folks who were quite stuck. Whether you’re look-
ing for your first real job, thinking about changing careers, or considering
self-employment, I know this book will help you — a lot.
About This Book
Although the previous editions of Cool Careers For Dummies received uniformly
gratifying reviews, from the day the second edition was published, I’ve been

working to ensure that this third edition is even better. In this edition, I do
the following:
 Pack the book with advice aimed especially at people just starting out —
two years on either side of graduation — and add plenty of tips for mid-
career people and for Boomers.
 Provide new guidance for career searchers who simply don’t have an
overriding passion or skill.
 Add, to the Cool Careers Yellow Pages in Chapter 2, new, rewarding,
viable careers and drop some that no longer measure up. Also, I enhance
or update 95 percent of the career scoops that were in the previous 
edition.
 Completely rewrite the section on ahead-of-the-curve careers in the Cool
Careers Yellow Pages. It’s filled with ideas on how to get in on the ground
floor of the next Big Things.
 Revise the 35 Most Revealing Questions in Chapter 3 so that they’re even
more likely to reveal what you really want in your career.
 Improve the advice in Chapter 4 for the many people who have a hard
time making the final decision — “Yes! This is the career I want to
pursue.”
 Improve Chapter 8, which distills what really works into a doable 
step-by-step plan.
 Add secrets to creating a winning resume in Chapter 9 — even if your
work history isn’t ideal.
 Enhance Chapter 11 on making any job better. Even more important 
than landing a good job is making the most of it. This chapter provides a
step-by-step plan for making even a humdrum job much better. To whet
your appetite, here’s one component: “The 3-Minute MBA: The world’s
shortest management course.”
 Streamline Chapter 12 on how to conquer procrastination.
 Add two new chapters about the top ten career truths for women and
men (Chapters 14 and 15). Being a guy, I wasn’t sure I was the right person
to write the former, but I found the right person. She’s a huge career suc-
cess; for example, she was named her region’s Schools Superintendent
of the Year. Plus, she’s a straight shooter, willing to tell you the things a
woman normally tells only her own child. Oh, I should also mention that
she’s my wife: Dr. Barbara Nemko.
 Create special lists of great careers in the Cool Career Finder (the
Appendix) for liberal arts graduates, Boomers, offshore-resistant job
searchers, and even slackers.

Cool Careers For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Conventions Used in This Book
I use a few conventions to make your experience with this book as easy as
possible:
 Italics highlight new terms and emphasize words.
 Boldface text indicates the keywords in bulleted lists and the action part
of numbered steps.
 To draw your attention to Web sites, I set them in monofont — a font
that looks like it came out of a typewriter.
 These days, even some cool sites have addresses so long they stretch to
Kansas — well, at least beyond the end of the line. In those cases, I don’t
insert a hyphen to indicate the break. So, when using one of those Web
addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book. Pretend the
line break doesn’t even exist.
What You’re Not to Read
I’d love to see you read every word in this book, but if you twist my arm, I
have to admit that some of the words are less important than others:
 Sidebars, which are shaded in gray, are useful stand-alone material, but
the world won’t end if you skip them.
 The 500-plus career intros in the Cool Careers Yellow Pages in Chapter 2
are arranged in categories, such as careers with people. If your idea of
nirvana is to work in isolation, you can certainly skip that section. Just
read the sections that appeal to you.
 You can easily find and succeed in your cool career without reading the
paragraphs marked with an Unconventional Wisdom icon. But they’re
mind-expanding and you probably won’t find those ideas anywhere else.
Foolish Assumptions
Because you’re reading this book, I assume
 You’re still unsure what you want to be when you grow up — even if you
already have gray hair. This book will help you get clear.
3
Introduction

 You’re not aspiring to a low-level job. This isn’t the book for high school
dropouts exploring options in manual labor. All work is worthy. Indeed,
people willing to work on low-paying, boring, low-prestige jobs deserve
great respect. But this isn’t the book for them.
 You’re reasonably intelligent, somewhere between bright and brilliant.
Don’t be fooled by the For Dummies title. These books are for intelligent
people who don’t want a drawn-out, painful learning experience. They
want the important information, and they want it fast and enjoyable.
That’s what I try to give you.
 You’re not easily offended. I sometimes write politically incorrect things.
I’d rather offend you with the truth than anesthetize you with lies.
How This Book Is Organized
The chapters in this book are organized into five parts.
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, 
Right Here
Whether you’ve never had a career before or want to dump your old career
for a new and improved one, this part is for you.
First, follow your heart. Browse the 500-plus careers in the Cool Careers
Yellow Pages in Chapter 2 and simply pick out one or more that make your
heart beat a little faster. Don’t feel like browsing all 500? There’s a quicker
approach. I divide the careers into categories to make it easier to home in on
the ones that are right for you.
Next, use your head. I ask you to list what’s really important to you in a career.
Don’t know? Answer the 35 Most Revealing Questions in Chapter 3.
Finally, blend head and heart. This part concludes with a virtual career coach.
It simulates what I do with my private clients so that your final career choice
makes sense and feels good.
Part II: Training for That Cool Career
Choosing a career is one thing; succeeding at it is something else. Often, a
key to success is to be trained well. In this part, I show you how to find the
4
Cool Careers For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

right training for you and how to make the most of it. If a university seems
like the right choice, I show you how to maximize your chances of admission
to a great program and how to reap the maximum benefit from your training.
But often, you can learn more at what I call You University, a custom mix of
mentoring, articles, tapes, and live or online classes. I even show how You U.
“graduates” can get hired over candidates with more degrees.
Part III: Landing That Cool Job
The standard advice — network, network, network — simply doesn’t work
for lots of people. They either don’t have many contacts to network with or
they’re uncomfortable with schmoozing. This part shows you an effective
way to land the job even if the thought of networking gives you the creeps
and you don’t have a 500-name Rolodex. For my clients, this approach has
been invaluable. From creating a winning resume to knock-their-socks-off
interviewing to staying motivated, this part covers it all.
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler
When you buy a suit, it probably looks just okay off the rack. To really make
it look good, it needs to be tailored and accessorized. The same is true with
your career. This part shows you how to make any job better by tailoring it to
your strengths and by using wise approaches with your boss and co-workers.
And if you’re a procrastinator, you probably won’t be after you finish reading
Chapter 12. (Don’t tell me you’ll read it next year.)
Another approach to making your career cooler is to become self-employed.
Chapter 13 takes the exciting but scary thought of being your own boss and
shows you how to maximize your chances of success.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Many good ideas don’t require long explanations. So here’s where I plunk lots
of good ideas that are self-explanatory: the top ten career truths for men,
women, and everyone.
Finally, there’s the appendix. It’s called The Cool Career Finder — a way for
you to find careers in nearly 20 categories, such as Cool Careers for Liberal
Arts Grads, Offshore-Resistant Careers, Boomer-Friendly Careers, Make a
Difference Careers, and even Cool Careers for Slackers.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
There are some ideas I really don’t want you to miss, so I mark them with one
of these icons:
This book is filled with tips. These are important good ideas.
Bigger than a tip, these are key strategies for finding and landing a cool
career.
Many people procrastinate on their career search if it’s drudgery. So, over the
years, I’ve kept track of approaches that are fun yet effective, and I put many
of them in this book. This icon makes sure you don’t miss them.
This icon lets me brag. These are the ideas I’m most proud of.
Avoid these common pitfalls and you probably won’t bomb out.
Where to Go from Here
No need to read the book from start to finish. I write it so that you can skim the
Table of Contents and simply start reading from the place that most intrigues
you. For example, perhaps you’ll want to start by browsing the Cool Careers
Yellow Pages in Chapter 2 or by answering the 35 Most Revealing Questions
in Chapter 3. Of course, I believe you’ll enjoy and profit from reading every
word. (That’s what every author thinks.) If you don’t, e-mail me. I promise to
respond and maybe incorporate your suggestion into the next edition.

Career, Right Here

In this part . . .
You’ve probably tried to choose your career — 
unsuccessfully, or you wouldn’t have bought this
book. The approach in this part was developed for people
like you. I give you plenty of options to explore in the Cool
Careers Yellow Pages and ask you 35 revealing questions
to help you match a career to your talents, interests, and
values. By the time you finish reading this part, chances
are, you’ll have found your cool career — and had fun in
the process.

 Previewing your own career journey
I
n this chapter, I give you an overview of what works as you find and enjoy
your own cool career, but first, I show you what doesn’t work.
Julie Seeks a Career: A Cautionary Tale
Sure, some people come out of the womb knowing what they want to be
when they grow up — the 5-year-old violin prodigy comes to mind. But most
people aren’t so lucky — and they don’t get much help.
Some parents tell you, “It’s your life. You decide.” Other parents go to the
other extreme, expecting you to follow in their footsteps: “Hazardous waste
disposal is a great career.” Before you even learn how to tie your shoes,
they’re pushing: “Come on, let’s visit Daddy’s toxic waste dump.”
In high school, you take a career test that asks what you’re interested in. How
the heck are you supposed to know? If you’re like most teens, you spend
most of your school life studying such career irrelevancies as the symbolism
in Romeo & Juliet, quadratic equations, and the slave ships of 1628. After
school, you play soccer and are forced to take piano lessons — a skill for
which only your mother thinks you have talent. You spend summers at Camp
Kowabonga, during which your career exploration consists of observing your
counselor go postal. How in the world are you supposed to validly answer
test questions about your career interests? It’s little surprise that many high
school students laugh at their career test results: forest ranger, funeral direc-
tor, or “You could pursue a wide range of careers.”

Many students remain undaunted. They figure that career clarity will come in
college. Trouble is, most colleges proudly proclaim that their courses are not
for career preparation but for general education. Worse, college courses are
taught by professors — people who have deliberately opted out of the real
world. So, many college students’ career sights are limited.
As college graduation approaches, panic often sets in and the same students
who procrastinated endlessly trying to ensure that they made the perfect
career choice suddenly force themselves into a decision, often based on very
little information. Their entire reasoning often fits on a bumper sticker:
 “I want to help people, so I’ll be a doctor.”
 “I’m lousy in science and I like to argue, so I’ll go to law school.”
 “I want to make a lot of money, so I’ll go into business.”
 “I don’t know what I want to do, so I’ll get a master’s in something.”
None of these reasons would work for Julie. She was sick of school. So she
headed to her college’s career center where she was pointed to a career
library and encouraged to “explore.”
That’s inadequate guidance for most people. Julie did, however, fall into a
job. Her cousin was the janitor at Western Widget Waxing, Inc., and put in a
good word for Julie: “She has always been interested in widgets.” Julie wrote
a letter to Western Widget Waxing, Inc., that began, “I believe I’m well-suited
for a career in the widget waxing industry.” She got an interview. She wore
that conservative suit she swore she’d never wear and told old WWW, Inc.,
that ever since childhood, she spent much of her spare time waxing widgets.
She got the job.
Within days of starting at WWW, Julie realized that widget waxing wasn’t all it
was cracked up to be. Now what? Not surprisingly, WWW’s human resources
manager told Julie only about options in widget waxing. “Well, Julie, you are
on track to becoming a widget waxing supervisor, and down the road, I think
you have the potential to become a widget waxing director.” On seeing Julie’s
face go flat, the manager tried, “Well, you could join our sales department.
Would you like to sell widget waxing? How about the accounting department?
Shipping? Well, what do you want, Julie?” That was the problem. Julie hadn’t
a clue.
In desperation, Julie decided to seek help from a professional — even though
it used up the money she’d been saving for that vacation. “What’s a thousand
bucks if it can land me a cool career?”
10
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here 

Alas, when Julie showed up at her appointment with the career counselor,
there were those tests again.
Counselor: Well, Julie, on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, you’re an INFP.
That means you’re an intraverted, intuitive, feeling perceiver.
Julie: So what should I do for a career?
Counselor: Julie, you can’t rush this. That would be premature foreclo-
sure. We need to review the results of the Campbell Interest and Skills
Survey. You’re an RIC. That stands for realistic-investigative-conventional.
Let’s interpret that.
Julie: So what should I do for a career?
Counselor: Well, Julie, use the information you’ve learned about yourself
from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and from the Campbell Interest and
Skills Survey by exploring in the career library.
Julie: Noooooooh, not again!
Instead, Julie returned to Western Widget Waxing, Inc.
Too often, career counseling is like psychoanalysis: You gain insight into
yourself but your life is no better.
One day, Julie heard about a book called Find Your Career Joy While Doing
What You Love and the Money Will Come While Your Flower Opens. So off Julie
trotted to the bookstore, and although daunted by the book’s thickness and
its 66 worksheets, she figured it was only $19.99 — the cost of two movie tick-
ets. Such a deal. Julie bit.
Five years later, our hero was still on worksheet #4. Her father, her friends,
and even her hairstylist were asking her, “Well, Julie, what are you going to be
when you grow up?” Julie decided to get serious. She pulled out her aging
copy of Find Your Career Joy While Doing What You Love and the Money Will
Come While Your Flower Opens and actually managed to complete all 66 work-
sheets. This gave her a complete inventory of her skills, interests, values, job
requirements, personality attributes, and inter-ocular focal length.
But doing all that still didn’t tell Julie how to figure out which career fits best.
I swear I’m not exaggerating. Even the best-selling career guides don’t take
you through that crucial next step: showing you which careers fit your skills,
interests, and values. The guides state or imply that if you do all their work-
sheets, you’ll somehow divine your dream career.
11
Chapter 1: Your Cool Career Journey

Julie cried, and Julie stayed on at Western Widget Waxing, Inc. “Maybe I am
meant to be in widget waxing,” she told herself. She worked hard, and indeed
the human resources manager’s prediction came to pass. Julie became direc-
tor of Widget Waxing. But still she wasn’t happy.
Then Julie was sure she found a solution: the computer. WWW, Inc., benevo-
lent firm that it is, bought a career-finding software program and made it
available to its employees. Julie was first in line. A couple of hours and voilà,
15 best-fit careers popped out. Some of the careers made sense but didn’t
excite her enough to make her quit her now-comfortable job at WWW to go
back and get retrained for a profession she wasn’t even sure she’d end up
liking better. After all, Julie had become a director and was vested in WWW’s
retirement plan. A few of the generated careers did excite Julie, but they were
careers that excite too many people — TV broadcasting, for example. So what
if Julie would love to anchor the nightly news? So would half the continent.
Although Julie didn’t know it, many computer programs often fail for another
reason. They eliminate careers if the career seeker lacks even one ostensibly
necessary skill or personality trait. In the real world, many careers don’t have
such rigid skill and personality requirements. Take book editors, for example.
Some succeed primarily because of their aesthetic sense, others because of
their feel for the bottom line. And aren’t some editors introverts, others extro-
verts? Even if Julie lacked a key attribute, if she found a career that excited
her, she may well have been willing and able to put the energy into compen-
sating for her weakness. But the computer program never gave her the chance.
Krishna Rama (nee Julie) now resides at the Harmonic Transcendent Monastery
in Berkeley, California, hoping to find career nirvana through meditation.
All jokes aside (at least for the moment), despite taking career tests, plowing
through fat career guides, and/or meditating, many people end up falling into
their careers more by chance than by choice. Not a good way to ensure
career happiness. There has to be a better way.
There is. Read on.
Taking Your Own Journey
There are two ways to use this book. You can simply flip to a chapter that
intrigues you and start there. Or you can let me be your virtual career coach.
After reading the overview in the following sections, just turn the page and I’ll
take you by the hand and walk you through what, for most people, is the most
12
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here 

successful way to go from career clueless to career contentment. Reading
this book all the way through simulates what my private clients pay me big
bucks for.
Discovering your cool career
Here’s what you and I can do together to start your journey:
1. Our first hour or two will be especially exciting. In browsing Chapter 2’s
Cool Careers Yellow Pages, you discover fascinating information about
500 cool careers and self-employment opportunities. Even on the off
chance that none of those 500 appeal to you, you understand the world
more richly than you ever have before. But chances are good that one or
more careers will call out to you.
2. I ask you the 35 Most Revealing Questions in Chapter 3. Over my 20 years
as a career counselor/coach, I’ve tried zillions of questions to tease out
my clients’ core skills, interests, values, and desires. These 35 are the
ones that have been most revealing.
3. By this point, you likely have come up with one or more careers that
intrigue you. Not so fast. Before committing to a career, you deserve to
know more about it. So, in Chapter 4, I show you the smartest ways to
learn more about a career. If, after that, you’re still unsure, I help you
gain the courage to make a decision.
If, after completing these three steps, you’re still unsure of what career to
choose, I’ve learned, over the years, that it’s far wiser to choose the best of
the options you’ve considered than to wait on the sidelines hoping for some-
thing better to come along. By choosing something, and then getting the best
training, and doing a competent job search so that you can unearth a good
job offer, you’ll probably be further along on the path toward a cool career
than if you took more career tests, visited a career library yet again, or even
worked with a career counselor/coach like me.
Finding the best training for your needs
In Chapters 5 and 6, I show you how to choose the right training program and
make the most of it. Feeling like an expert is more central to believing you’re
in a cool career than the career itself. I’ve seen people who have ostensibly
cool careers — for example, actors — who are miserable, because deep down,
they’re not sure they’re that good. On the other hand, I’ve seen plumbers
13
Chapter 1: Your Cool Career Journey

who think they’re in a cool career, largely because they know they can handle
virtually any problem they’re likely to face.
Getting a cool job
The part of career-finding that most people hate is looking for a job. Some
people will procrastinate until they’re homeless instead of sitting down to
start the job hunt. So, in the next part of our journey, I do everything I can to
make that job search easy and pleasant. I start, in Chapter 7, by helping you
get into the right mindset — by the time you’re through, you’ll practically laugh
at getting rejected. In Chapter 8, I lay out the plan, step by step. I show you how
to create a great resume in just a few hours (see Chapter 9), and the secrets of
impressive interviewing — even if you’ve been slacking on your parents’ sofa
for the last two years. (Chapter 10 has the full scoop on interviewing.)
Making the most of your new career
The last step in your journey is probably the most important. Choosing your
career carefully and then not making the most of it is like giving the gas station
attendant $20 but putting only $10 of gas in your tank. I show you how to take
your off-the-shelf career and tailor and accessorize it to fit you. And I equip
you with skills critical in nearly every career: for example, people skills so out-
standing that you become beloved (see Chapter 11), overcoming procrastina-
tion (see Chapter 12), and the art of being entrepreneurial (see Chapter 13).
Okay. Onward to what may be one of your life’s most exciting journeys.

Chapter 2
The Cool Careers Yellow Pages
In This Chapter
 Using the Cool Careers Yellow Pages effectively
 Discovering many great career options
 Finding out what’s on the leading (but not bleeding) edge
T
he first step in finding your career may be the most fun: browsing the
Cool Careers Yellow Pages. It gives you a fast yet substantive introduction
to more than 500 good careers, including many unlikely suspects.
What Makes a Cool Career Cool?
Competition for a spot in the Cool Careers Yellow Pages was fierce. First, a
career had to be one of the following:
 A popular career
 A little-known niche within a popular career
 A little-known career
 A self-employment opportunity that seems to have a high reward/risk ratio
I narrowed down the careers further by selecting the highest scorers overall
on these criteria:
 Potential to make a difference in society
 Potential for at least a middle-class income
 A good job market

Using the Cool Careers Yellow Pages
You have three options when you peruse the Cool Careers Yellow Pages:
 The Very Busy Person’s Approach. To make it easy to home in on the
right career for you, I divide the career profiles into categories. Scan the
careers in the category that seems to best fit you (for example, careers
with people and words), read the profiles of just the few careers that
jump out at you, and pick the career that seems most on-target. A tenta-
tive career in ten minutes! (Of course, even the busiest person should
check that career out in greater detail. So, each career’s profile ends
with one or more Web sites or books that enable you to do that.) Most of
those books are too specialized to be carried in your local bookstore,
but most are available at www.amazon.com.
You can also learn a lot about a career simply by googling the career
name and the word “careers.” So, for example, if you want to know more
about a career in geology, just enter “geology careers” into the search
engine at google.com.
Want another superbusy person’s approach to homing in on the right
career? This book’s appendix contains special lists of careers: for exam-
ple, the careers most likely to impress your family, easy-to-transition-
into careers, careers that are too much fun to be work, those offering the
surest routes to big bucks, and the careers most likely to improve soci-
ety. You could start by browsing the careers on one of those lists.
 The Busy Person’s Approach. Zoom into a couple of categories and
read just those profiles. A tentative career in 20 minutes!
 The Wisest Approach. The career profiles are short and pleasant to read,
so it’s wise to read ’em all. Who knows? Your dream career could be in a
category you wouldn’t have picked. Besides, at the risk of immodesty,
I’m confident you’ll enjoy reading this chapter and learn a lot about the
world in the process. A woman who had bought this book’s second edi-
tion for her son e-mailed me to say she couldn’t stop reading the Cool
Careers Yellow Pages even though she wasn’t looking for a career.
The categories
A career can require skill with people, with data, with words, and/or with
things. In the Yellow Pages, I categorize the careers accordingly. For example,
the attorney profile is in the “Words/People” category. Most attorneys must
excel at using words and must also have good people skills.
16
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

Puhleeze, don’t treat a career’s category as gospel. The individual job you
land may be different. For example, one lawyer may mainly write contracts, in
which case he doesn’t need exceptional people skills. Another reason not to
take the categories too seriously is that many careers fall on the border
between two categories. They could easily fit in another category.
The icons
Sometimes, a picture is worth 1,000 words. Not so with these pictures;
they’re worth maybe three or four.
Each career profile is accompanied by an education icon. It represents the
typical minimum that an average employer requires. Some job openings
require more than that minimum, but, occasionally, a candidate is impressive
enough to be hired with less. Before choosing a career, verify the current edu-
cation requirements in your locale.
No degree required. Training may involve an on-the-job program, an appren-
ticeship, or a certificate program.
Some college required, usually a two-year degree.
Bachelor’s degree required.
Master’s or other post-bachelor’s — but not doctoral — education required.
Doctoral degree required.
Some icons denote things other than education requirements:
Careers marked with this icon have significant self-employment potential.
A career in which being older is often a plus.
Careers marked with this icon are profiled in-depth in the Occupational
Outlook Handbook, an authoritative government source available in most
libraries, and online at www.bls.gov/oco.

Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

Taking the road less traveled
The Cool Careers Yellow Pages covers the popular professions, such as doctor,
lawyer, and psychologist, but as you know, those careers require years of
graduate school. Many people in those fields believe their education failed to
prepare them for their career despite the enormous cost and years of effort.
Before committing to all that schooling, know that many people find great
career satisfaction and acceptable income in similar careers that don’t require
you to spend so many of your peak years behind a student desk. Examples:
 Aspire to be a doctor? Physician assistants and nurse practitioners real-
ize most of a doctor’s benefits: They command a healthy salary, get to
diagnose and treat patients, and because they rarely treat serious ill-
nesses, most of their patients get well.
 Leaning toward the law? Consider becoming a mediator: less confronta-
tional work, fewer ethical temptations, and shorter training.
 See yourself as a psychologist? Personal coaches not only train for a
shorter time but because they deal with healthier people, they also see
more progress.
 Aspire to be an executive? It’s a long hard road. And in today’s flatter
hierarchy, an ever-smaller percentage of aspiring executives ever get
past middle management. That often means long hours and little power.
Instead, consider owning your own small business, where you get to
instantly catapult yourself from schlepper to CEO (with no MBA required).
So in addition to the popular high-status professions (which are covered in
the Cool Careers Yellow Pages), consider checking out the Yellow Pages’ many
other careers.
Okay, enough preliminaries. Enjoy.
Work with People
Caretaking and coaching
Mediator. Traditionally, the way that divorcing husbands and wives avoid
killing each other is by hiring two attorneys and letting the lawyers slug it
out. That’s expensive, adversarial, and often, just plain yucky. An ever-more
popular alternative is to hire a mediator. Don’t like divorce mediation? Tackle
employment cases — before going to trial, most wrongful termination suits
18
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

must be mediated. Lawyers generally are chosen to mediate complicated
fact-centered disputes while counselor-types more often are used when emo-
tional issues are at the core. Whether a lawyer or counselor, a really good
mediator needs the listening skills of a suicide counselor, the patience of Job,
the wisdom of Solomon, and, alas, the marketing skills of P. T. Barnum. Media-
tion Information: www.mediate.com. Meditation Resource Center: www.nolo.

Geriatric Care Manager. Imagine you have aging parents living in another
city. They need help dealing with the healthcare system, finding someone to
look in on them, or completing paperwork. You’d help out if you were local,
but you’re not. An answer? Hire a geriatric care manager. U.S. News tells of
geriatric care manager Pat Gleason. She “has dozens of ‘adopted’ grandpar-
ents. As she makes the rounds to private homes and nursing facilities in
Texas, she is showered with hugs and kisses from clients she helps with the
problems of aging. It may be a woman recovering from a broken hip who
needs help making her home easier to navigate, or a widower having trouble
rebuilding a social life . . . One job perk, she says, is free history lessons, such
as the stories she heard from a 104-year-old about crossing the Oklahoma
Territory in a covered wagon.” Don’t want to be self-employed? Some hospi-
tals and HMOs also hire geriatric care managers. National Association of
Professional Geriatric Care Managers: www.caremanager.org.
Psychotherapist/Psychologist. Not long ago, experts thought that schizo-
phrenia, autism, and depression were caused by bad parenting. So countless
patients and their families were subjected to years of fruitless psychother-
apy. Now, it’s clearer that these and many other psychological problems have
largely physiological roots. That will increase the need for physicians trained
in psychology but reduce the need for psychologists focused on the psyche.
Nevertheless, for now at least, demand for psychotherapists remains solid.
More health plans are covering psychotherapy visits because it’s tough to
cope with life’s ever-greater demands and because new therapies are more
effective. For example, brief solution-oriented therapy, sometimes combined
with new drugs, is rapidly replacing prolonged analysis of childhood angst.
New trend: e-counseling. Compared with in-person or by-phone counseling,
the client can take more time to reflect on the therapist’s questions.
Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychotherapy. Jeffrey
Kottler’s book: What You Never Learned in Graduate School: A Survival Guide
for Therapists.
My experience getting a PhD in educational psychology from Berkeley and then
teaching at four different graduate schools has convinced me that psycholo-
gist training programs have been padded into doctorate-length marathons:
It’s not because there’s so much that aspiring psychologists need to know,
but because universities make more money the longer students are in school.
19
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

And grad students are free or low-cost research slaves for professors. If
you’re considering a career as a psychologist, ask yourself whether you want
to endure that. Then consider whether a career as a personal coach (which I
cover later in this chapter) may be less demanding and more fulfilling.
That said, the following niches, which don’t attempt to radically remold
people the way traditional psychotherapy does, are, in my view, among the
most likely to be rewarding:
(Neat Niche) Relationship Acceptance Therapist. Couples counseling
apparently works best when it helps partners learn to accept each other
as they are instead of trying to change each other. (This makes sense. How
easy is it to make you change?) A study found that after just six months of
acceptance therapy, 90 percent of couples considering divorce reported
“dramatic” increases in satisfaction and none split up. Andrew
Christensen’s book: Reconcilable Differences.
(Neat Niche) Men’s Therapist. The number of therapists for women and
people of color have long been increasing. Now men are starting to seek
counselors specializing in men’s issues. Mensight magazine: www.men
sightmagazine.com. The National Men’s Resource: www.menstuff.org.
Glenn Good’s book: The New Handbook of Psychotherapy and Counseling
with Men, Revised Edition.
(Neat Niche) Infant Mental Health Counselor. This career emerged because
more and more children are born with severe mental or physical problems,
or into homes with parents ill-equipped to be parents. The infant counselor
advises parents on how to bring up a challenging baby while retaining
their sanity. The Infant Mental Health Specialist: www.zerotothree.org/
vol21-2s.pdf. World Association for Infant Mental Health: www.msu.edu/
user/waimh.
(Neat Niche) Money Counselor. Some people hoard money, others spend
it too fast; Boomers can’t discuss it with their aging parents. Enter the money
counselor. In my favorite incarnation of this career, you first help your client
understand the cause of his money problem and, in turn, develop a plan to
cure it. Then, if the client is deeply in debt, you negotiate for him, asking
creditors for reductions in interest and penalties. Sometimes, creditors will
even pay you a percentage of any debt payments you submit to them.

(Neat Niche) School Psychologist. This can be a great job: nine-month
year, high status, no undue stress. Typical project: Johnny is doing lousy
in school. What should school and parents do? In comes the school psy-
chologist: Observe the kid; test him; pow-wow with parent, teacher, kid,
and special education teacher; and write jargon-filled report. School

psychologists may also conduct parenting workshops and screen students
for gifted students programs. National Association of School Psychologists:
www.nasponline.org. Kenneth Merrell’s book: School Psychology for the
21st Century.
Alas, programs for gifted students are being dismantled. Why do slow learn-
ers have the right to special, expensive instruction, and psychological and
other services, but gifted students, with so much potential to contribute to
society and who often flounder without attention, increasingly get zilch?
(Neat Niche) Consulting Psychologist. A dentist is losing patients and ter-
rifying others. Maybe she’s just a bad dentist, but it could be she doesn’t
know the art of calming patients. A consulting psychologist teaches the
dentist how to calm her patients. Another example: a psychologist may
teach a lawyer how to tease out honest responses from clients and depo-
nents. Society of Consulting Psychology: www.apa.org/divisions/div13.
(Neat Niche) Sports Psychologist. A golfer has trouble concentrating. A
pitcher freaks out under pressure. Teammates hate each other’s guts.
Enter the sports psychologist. The American Psychological Association’s
Division of Sports Psychology: www.psyc.unt.edu/apadiv47. Robert
Weinberg’s book: Foundations of Sport and Exercise Psychology, 4th Edition.
(Neat Niche) Forensic Psychologist. Is he sane enough to deserve the
death penalty? Rehabilitated enough to be released into society? Competent
enough to manage his own affairs without a conservator? More worthy of
being the custodial parent? Was the death a disguised suicide to let the
beneficiaries cash in on an insurance policy? Forensic psychologists address
those sorts of questions. The Forensic Psychologist: www.geocities.com/
athens/7429/forensicpsychprep.html.
College Student Advisor. In years past, professors advised the students,
but colleges have realized that professors are more interested in and knowl-
edgeable about their own research than about what courses Jill should take.
So, many colleges now hire counselor types to advise undergraduates. Some-
times, it’s just a matter of reviewing a transcript and suggesting courses, but
with the amount of career-planning and personal malaise that many college
students feel, it often goes well beyond. National Academic Advising Association:
www.nacada.ksu.edu. Virginia Gordon’s book: Academic Advising.
Personal Coach. Do you like to help others but would rather deal with prob-
lems easier to address than reconstructing a personality? Personal coaching
is some combination of goal-setting advisor, time-management consultant,
motivator, sounding board, confidant, dream-builder, image instructor, and
cheerleader — everything but going back and discussing the childhood causes
of one’s malaise. The emphasis is on problem solving — what are you going
to do to solve this now? Some psychotherapists, who practice cognitive or
rational-emotive therapy, do those things, but personal coaches can be 
21
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

adequately trained in far less time. Alas, coaches must market heavily to get
clients — there seems to be a coach under every rock. Coaching is increas-
ingly done by phone. Some even coach via e-mail for the clients who prefer
having time to reflect on the coach’s question before answering. International
Coaches Federation: www.coachfederation.org. Coach U: www.coachu.com.
Choice magazine: www.choice-online.com. Julie Starr’s book: Coaching
Manual.
(Neat Niche) Career Coach/Counselor. Here, I get to write about my own
career. The part I like best is helping people make the most of their current
jobs — I’m successful with nearly all those clients. Unfortunately, most
people hire a career counselor to help them get a different job. And here I
have mixed feelings. With students and new college graduates, it’s still fine.
I help them identify new options and develop a plan to get hired, and it
usually works. But many older people come in wanting to change careers,
and my success rate and that of other career counselors I’ve spoken with
is low. Few midlifers who say they want a new career end up being willing
to put in the time and effort necessary to make it happen. The third type
of client wants help landing a job. I find this work a little boring because
it’s mechanical: cranking out a resume and teaching the client how to win
the job-hunt game. More important, I dislike that part of my job because I
believe it actually makes the world a worse place: My task is basically to
make my clients look their best to employers. That gives my clients an
unfair advantage over uncoached candidates who may in fact be more
qualified. So I refer most such clients to a hand-picked colleague.
That said, a lot of things are great about my job. I work one-on-one in a peace-
ful environment — my home. I get to hear people’s life stories — fun. I get to
wear many hats: counselor, idea generator, marketer, cheerleader, chastiser. I
improve people’s worklives and often help them make a bigger difference in
the world than they otherwise would have. If you want to be a career coun-
selor, here’s what it takes: You must be credible yet not intimidating, and
optimistic yet realistic. You must also be a perceptive listener, know a lot
about the world of work, be able to motivate people to act, and know how to
use the Internet’s myriad career resources. Private practice can work if
you’re willing to self-promote, especially if you pick a niche: teachers,
lawyers, middle-age men, whatever. If you’re averse to marketing yourself,
some of the best jobs are at college career centers. The book you’re reading
constitutes a summary of my style of career coaching. A book presenting a more
traditional approach is Howard Figler’s and Richard Bolles’s Career Counselor’s
Handbook. National Career Development Association: www.ncda.org.
(Neat Niche) Time Management Coach. When someone asks, “How are
you?” the answer is as likely to be “Swamped” as “Fine.” Enter the time-
management coach — the person who tries to help wring 25 hours from a
24-hour day. Many people and employers willingly pay for that kind of advice.
Marketing tip: Conduct time-management seminars in workplaces. That
generates a fee and helps you recruit individual clients. Start preparing 
for this career by doing the equivalent of writing a term paper. Read a few
22
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

books and articles on time-management, do a Web search, and write down
potentially useful strategies so that you have plenty of different strokes for
different folks. Then do a few freebie consultations for friends. First, check
out the time-efficiency section of this book in Chapter 11. Stephen Covey’s
book: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Alec MacKenzie’s book: The
Time Trap. Google “time management coaching” to get a sense of what vari-
ous time management coaches do.
(Neat Niche) Simplification Coach. More people are recognizing that overly
materialistic, hypercomplicated lives make for a worse existence. Some
people may have no choice, like the 55-year-old executive with a stay-at-
home spouse and a fat mortgage who’s still paying for two kids in college.
Even if a person has a choice, it’s tough to get off the treadmill. Most
people are conditioned to try (rarely successfully) to buy their way into
happiness. A simplification coach can help. You help your clients evaluate
every aspect of their lives: “If you opted out of the materialistic lifestyle,
could you pursue a career you’d enjoy more? Will that home remodel truly
be worth the hassle, cost, and resultant financial insecurity? Should you
build in more time for just relaxing? Would your child benefit from a less
packed after-school schedule? Michael Sheffield’s Simplicity Coaching:
www.simplicitycoaching.com. Linda Pierce’s book: Simplicity Lessons.
(Neat Niche) Parenting Coach. Whether they have a newborn or an adult
child who just moved back home, many parents worry that they’re not
good enough at parenting. They don’t want a therapist; they just want help
in getting their pride and joy to not drive them crazy. You can market to
individual parents, for example, by offering free seminars at PTA meetings.
Too, school districts and social service organizations may hire parenting
coaches. Subniches: sleep consultant, potty trainer, adult child slacker
coach. Search “parenting coaching” at google.com to get a sense of what
different parenting coaches do.
(Neat Niche) Shyness Coach. Many people are painfully shy. Coaching
them is a largely untapped market. You role-play stressful situations with
clients and help them realize that the worst-case scenario isn’t so bad or
so likely. New evidence suggests that shyness often has a physiological
component, so improvement may be modest, but even that is often worth-
while. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shyness.
(Neat Niche) Dating Coach. You start by helping your clients figure out
who the right sort of romantic partner for them would be and where such
people are most likely to be found. Next, you help them with initial interac-
tions: for example, writing a match.com ad or teaching them the art of
flirting in a supermarket. Role-play the first date, and then “double date”
with them, debriefing afterward. Finally, help them develop the ability to
turn a great first date into a serious relationship. David Wygant’s book:
Always Talk to Strangers. Romy Miller’s book: Understanding Women: The
Definitive Guide to Meeting, Dating and Dumping, If Necessary. Ellen Fein’s
book: Rules II. Joy Browne’s book: Dating For Dummies, 2nd Edition.

Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

(Neat Niche) Image Coach. “Are you a winter, spring, summer, or fall?” As
an image consultant, you may start by picking out their clients’ colors, but
you’ll probably move on to helping them select their clothes, makeup, and
maybe even posture and interaction style. New subniche: Teaching people
the art of walking into a meeting or party. Image consultants are popular
because primping up one’s image is a relatively painless way to get an
edge at work and at play. The freshly divorced, for example, are often
eager to present a new persona. Market your services by offering seminars
for singles groups or for an organization’s employees. Or convince a cor-
poration’s HR department to hire you to spruce up all employees who
want an image assessment and upgrade. Neat niches: enginerds, singles
older than 50, those who wear plus sizes, employees in a specific field.
Association of Image Consultants International: www.aici.org.
(Neat Niche) Executive Coach. Many executives are just a beat off. They’re
a bit too intense, too detail oriented, too something. Companies or the
executives themselves hire coaches to help underperforming execs get
into the rhythm. You may help them on such matters as posture, body lan-
guage, speaking style, etiquette, nonverbal communication, running a
meeting, and business protocol. Harvard Business School’s article on execu-
tive coaching: hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/4853.html. Stephen Fairley’s
book: Getting Started in Personal and Executive Coaching.
(Neat Niche) Retirement Coach. Boomers are entering retirement age,
many with trepidation. They may need to plan on living another 30 years
but have only saved for a fraction of that. Work is central to their identity
and even with a bit of part-time work and volunteering, they worry they’ll
feel out-to-pasture. Couples in retirement suddenly find themselves spend-
ing more time together and may not like each other so much anymore.
Enter the retirement coach, who may assist in financial planning, helping
the client figure out how to fill days, and/or readjusting to seeing the
spouse 24/7. Jan Cullinane’s book: The New Retirement.
Organizer. Work and homelives are increasingly complicated and cluttered,
so it’s no surprise that the demand for organizers is growing. Marketing tip:
Contact HR directors at nearby businesses. Suggest they hire you to do “orga-
nizing makeovers” for any employees who feel they need it. Repeat business
is likely because, generally, once a slob, always a slob. Tell your clients that,
just as they get their teeth cleaned regularly, they need you to clean house
(don’t forget the garage) regularly. Since 1993, membership has more than
doubled in the National Association of Professional Organizers: www.napo.net.

Doula. The most exhausting period in many women’s lives is labor and child-
birth, and the first weeks after birth. Throughout, the doula is there to provide
pain-decreasing techniques from breathing techniques to different positions,
from massage to aromatherapy. Doulas also provide much needed emotional
support and advice for moms (and dads?) before, during, and sometimes after
the birth. Some evidence suggests that doula-assisted births result in shorter
24
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

labor, fewer Caesarean and forceps births, and less need for pain medica-
tions. Doulas of North America has seen membership grow from 85 in 1992 to
6,000 today. Doulas of North America: www.dona.com.
Literary, Artist’s, or Performer’s Agent. Most artistic types aren’t entre-
preneurial. Left to their own devices, they’d hang out, practice their craft,
and the checks would somehow arrive in the mail. The agent’s job is to make
that happen. Agents help polish the sample product, pitch it to prospective
buyers, and negotiate the deal for 10 to 15 percent of the take. Why is being
an agent a cool career? You get to pick out and then champion the talented
people you want to represent, work closely with them to ensure their product
is well packaged, and help them reach as large an audience as possible. Plus,
being an agent requires no formal credentials. Most agents learn the business
as an agent’s assistant or as a talent buyer — acquisitions editor for a publish-
ing company, for example. North American Performing Arts Managers and Agents:
www.napama.org. Association of Authors Representatives: www.aar-online.
org. Tony Martinez’s book: An Agent Tells All.
Social Worker. Many people and families just can’t make it without help. A
child is abused; an older adult has Alzheimer’s disease; a single parent with
eight children, on top of it all, gets AIDS. Few jobs are more intimate and
human than the social worker’s. Despite the frustrations and low pay, most
social workers who make it past the first two years like their jobs. After all,
part of their job is to give away cash, rent subsidies, child-care, food stamps,
health services, job training, and other resources, compliments of taxpayers.
And pay isn’t as bad as it used to be, averaging about $50,000. Social work
remains one of the last professions with excellent job security: More than half
of social workers work for the government, it’s not a job that can be sent off-
shore, and it’s hard to foresee the need for social workers declining. Many
social workers are, however, employed by HMOs or private agencies such as
the Red Cross, or are in private practice. This is one of the many careers in
which the training requirements have been ratcheted up: Now, a master’s
degree is usually required. National Association of Social Workers: www.social
workers.org. The New Social Worker Online: www.socialworker.com.

Employee Assistance Professional. Workers show up with problems: 
drug abuse, prone to violence, in financial disarray, or with eldercare needs.
Employee assistance professionals coordinate programs to help. On the pre-
vention side, EAPs may establish physical fitness programs, sponsor work-
shops on time management or career planning, and even arrange carpools.

Victim Assistant. Imagine that you’ve just been assaulted. Upon reporting
the crime — if you’re fortunate — you’re introduced to a victim assistant.
This person provides you with emotional and practical support all the way
through trial and is your liaison with the district attorney. Victim assistants

Bail Bond Investigator (Bounty Hunter). Few tasks are riskier than
going after criminals on the run. Believe it or not, the police are often too
busy to find them. That’s where bail bond investigators come in. First, you
must track down leads. Computers help, but the ability to find snitches is
key. (One woman bailed her grandson out of jail by posting her house as a
bond, but he skipped town, and guess who turned him in? Dear ol’ grandma.)
An unsurpassed adrenaline rush comes in the actual chase and takedown —
many people who skip bail won’t go back to jail without a fight. So, it’s not
surprising that successful bail bond investigators can earn a six-figure income.
(I wouldn’t do it for seven figures.) Premiere Bounty Hunter School and Training
Center: www.beabountyhunter.com.
Child Life Specialist. Imagine that your child is told she has a serious ill-
ness and must suddenly move from home into a hospital for a long stay filled
with painful treatments. The child life specialist’s job is to help children
adapt to living without their parents and to psychologically prepare them for
scary medical encounters. Child life specialists also help ensure that these
kids get an education and a bit of fun in their lives. Child Life Council: www.
childlife.org. Richard Thompson’s book: Child Life in Hospitals.
School Guidance Counselor. The modern version of this job is much more
complicated than dealing with kids kicked out of class for chewing gum.
School counselors may coordinate sex education, health awareness, career
counseling, gang violence prevention, and on-site social work services. And
yes, counselors still spend a lot of time telling Johnny that he better shape up
or else. The quality of these jobs varies. Some end up being more clerk than
counselor. American School Counselor Association: www.schoolcounselor.
org. John Schmidt’s book: A Survival Guide for the Elementary/Middle School
Counselor.
Nanny. The training is short; the task is doable, often pleasurable; and you
may get to work in an environment most people only dream about: a wealthy
person’s home. That’s not a bad combination, even if the pay is low. If you’re
good with kids, you won’t have trouble finding a job. With the increase in single
parents, and with two-parent families working full time, even many middle-
class people find that a nanny is a must. The key to enjoying nannyhood is to
get hooked up with a great family. Attending nanny school maximizes your
chances. Why? Because many desirable families search for their nannies by
contacting nanny schools. International Nanny Association: www.nanny.org.
Jo Frost’s book: Supernanny: How to Get the Best from Your Children.
Child-Care Center Owner. As the number of single parents and families
with two working parents grows, so does the need for child-care centers. To
succeed, worry less about creating a fancy facility or even having lots of toys
26
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

and equipment. What’s key is to be or hire a child-care provider(s) with that
ineffable ability to make children love them. Of course, child-care providers
must also be responsible and have an ever-watchful eye — young children
can do all sorts of dangerous things. My mother told me that as a toddler, I
had a habit of eating carpet fuzz. National Child Care Information Center: www.
nccic.org. National Association of Child Care Professionals: www.naccp.org.
Personal Assistant. According to the New York Post, a typical day in the life
of Olympia Dukakis’s personal assistant consists of rendering a second opin-
ion on a movie contract, dropping off her dry cleaning, picking up her dog’s
gourmet dog food, and suggesting ideas for marketing Dukakis’s salad dress-
ing. Salaries range from $30,000 to $100,000, plus perks like concert tickets
and traveling first class. Of course, not just celebrities need assistants. These
days, just about any busy person could use one. Niches: executives, college
presidents, wealthy widows, and your run-of-the-mill busy middle incomer.
Sometimes, the job may be more like an office assistant — word-processing a
report, coordinating a project, and handling the bookkeeping — but Beth
Berg made a good living with none of that. She started “Dial a Wife.” She plans
the meal, waits for the plumber, takes Junior (and his friends) to soccer, 
perhaps plants your herb garden, and even does the initial house hunting.
Sounds like a traditional wife, but she gets paid $50 an hour. Berg’s first ad
simply said, “Buy time.” Dionne Muhammad’s book: Beyond The Red Carpet:
Keys To Becoming a Successful Personal Assistant.
(Neat Niche) Virtual Assistant. This is an option for someone who wants
to, at home, use administrative skills, such as word-processing, database
management, Internet searching, travel arranging, and bookkeeping. Of
course, virtual assisting is especially appealing if you have a disability, 
you want a portable business because your spouse’s career requires fre-
quent moving, or simply because you love the idea of being able to play in
your garden during the day. There’s no commute and no office politics. A
Newsweek article describes this career as an administrative assistant with-
out a boss looking over your shoulder. International Virtual Assistants

Concierge. Marcia’s concierge service, operating in the lobbies of residential
and office buildings, helps inhabitants with life’s mundane tasks, such as
picking up dry cleaning, returning videos, and taking cars in for oil changes.
Marcia can often get employers to pay for her services because they know that
many employees sneak time off work to take care of life’s necessities. In hiring
Marcia, the boss gets full use of the employees and grateful workers as a bonus.

Bringing people together
Personnel Recruiter. Forget about the image of the recruiter coming onto
campus to recruit applicants. Today’s recruiter starts before jobs are even
advertised. He develops ongoing relationships with the sorts of people the
employer is likely to hire. For example, a company that uses Java program-
mers may routinely post tips and tricks on online Java discussion groups to
elicit positive feelings toward the recruiter. When a job opens, the recruiter
posts it on the Web and sets up software to screen applicants. Increasingly,

(Neat Niche) Employment Interviewer. You’ve been on the other side of
the table: “Mr. Job Applicant, why do you want to work for this company?”
You think, “Because I’m desperate. I’ll work anywhere.” You answer,
“Because I’m impressed with your fine line of products.” How’d you like a
career in which you’re the interviewer? Employment agencies hire inter-
viewers to screen applicants, prep them for interviews, and then pitch them
to prospective employers. Don’t like the selling part? Work for a company
or the government. Your job is simply to match applicants with the avail-
able openings. Pierre Mornell’s book: 45 Effective Ways for Hiring Smart.
(Neat Niche) Executive Recruiter (Headhunter). This is one of the few jobs
that requires no formal education yet can yield a six-figure income. You
work for a private agency engaged by companies to lure top execs from
other firms. What makes this a neat niche is that you get to work with
accomplished people, and you can earn big money if you can persuade
enough HR managers to let you conduct their employee searches. You must
also be able to sniff out top-flight execs, determine whether they’re com-
patible with the client company’s culture, and if so, convince them to take
a job with another company. Keith Kulper’s article: www.kulpercompany.

School-to-Work Coordinator. Some schools are finally realizing that they
graduate too many students ill equipped for real-world jobs. So high schools
are hiring school-to-work coordinators. A coordinator may arrange for teach-
ers to visit local workplaces. Some teachers, on seeing what it takes to succeed
in today’s workplace, change what they do in the classroom. School-to-work
coordinators may also help students in career planning by bringing commu-
nity members to schools to talk about their jobs, and arranging student job
shadowing and internships. National Tech-Prep Network: www.cord.org/ntpn.
Casting Director. Would you find it fun to cast a sitcom? An epic motion pic-
ture? A feminine hygiene commercial? Casting director is one of those little-
known but fun Hollywood careers. Here’s how casting works: You write a
breakdown (a list of all the needed characters), e-mail it to agents, and wait
for submissions (photos and resumes). Then you pick people to audition.

Casting Director Lisa Pirriolli says, “Casting is perfect for people who were
unpopular in high school and this is their way of getting back at all the
people who didn’t ask them out.” The bad news: You usually have to start as
a volunteer. Casting Society of America: www.castingsociety.com. Janet
Hirshenson and Jane Jenkins’s book: A Star Is Found.
Sales-oriented work
Salesperson. When you hear the word “salesperson,” what’s the first word
that comes to mind? Pushy? Although those types are around, many success-
ful salespeople don’t fit the stereotype. They are, however, self-starters who
are pleasantly persistent and good at listening to the customer and explain-
ing how a product can solve the customer’s problems. They aren’t reluctant
to ask for the sale. A career in sales is one of the few routes to high income
without college. Sales offers flexible hours and, if you’re an outside sales rep,
a chance to travel. Plus, it’s nice to know that your income is directly related
to your performance: The more you sell, the more you make. The problem is
it’s tough to know how much you’ll sell. Even good salespeople will fail if the
product, territory, or commission rate stinks. (Before accepting a job, ask one
of the company’s other salespeople about those three things.)
Many salespeople are surprised to find that they actually spend less than half
their time selling. They answer technical questions, write proposals, take
care of problems with product or delivery, and write reports to management.
The Internet is eliminating many sales jobs — an intelligent Web site can do a
better job of selling than many salespeople at a fraction of the cost and is
available 24/7. But at least until the next edition of this book is written, jobs
for good salespeople should be available. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/sales. Louise Kursmark’s book: Sales Careers. Tom Hopkins’s
book: How to Master the Art of Selling.
Many salespeople tell me that, sooner or later, they find sales to be unfulfill-
ing. After all, if the product was that good, it would usually sell itself or merely
require somebody earning $12 an hour to take orders or explain the product.
When salespeople earn a good living, it’s often because they’re able to con-
vince prospects to buy something they wouldn’t have in the absence of a
sales pitch. Some of my clients do like selling: They enjoy “the thrill of the
kill” (closing the sale), promoting a product they believe in, the money, and
the competition against their sales quota or fellow salespeople. But reflective
people, I believe, may want to avoid a career as salesperson.
(Neat Niche) Sales of E-mercials. As you bid a not-fond farewell to blinking
ads, you alas must say hello to Internet commercials now that more people
have high-speed Internet connections. Getting in on the ground floor of
this nascent niche may be as lucrative as the ad salespeople who started
selling TV spots in the 1950s.

(Neat Niche) Big-Ticket Item Sales. Examples: golf courses, airplanes, sky-
scrapers, and custom software. Custom software? The software that banks
use to back up their data costs each bank hundreds of thousands of dollars.
(Neat Niche) Green Product Sales. Environmentalism is the world’s newest
religion. That means that green products, from solar panels to pollution
control systems to lumber made from sawdust and plastic milk containers,
are becoming an ever-easier sell.
(Neat Niche) Sales of Instruments and Consumables to Biotech Companies.
The biotech industry is booming and its companies use lots of costly items.
(Neat Niche) Industrial Sales. I like this because it’s under-the-radar — no
one grows up thinking, “When I grow up, I want to sell conveyer belts.”
That means the competition is less and the pay is better. And, for the right
person, it can be fun — getting to visit all sorts of manufacturing plants
and helping them solve their problems. Manufacturer’s Agents National
Association: www.manaonline.org. Don’t miss its quiz for future agents.
(Neat Niche) Electrical Components Sales. Electrical parts aren’t sexy, but
demand for these components is high and few salespeople have the tech-
nical expertise to sell them effectively. That means higher salaries. An
engineering background is a plus and sometimes a must.
(Neat Niche) Financial Services Sales. Thirty-somethings worry about
saving for their children’s obscenely expensive college education. Older
people are becoming ever-more desperate to figure out how their tiny nest
egg will last their lifetime. So, financial “consultant” (sales) careers at
banks and other financial service companies should be lucrative.
(Neat Niche) Security Sales. Employees and customers often view employ-
ers as Bad Guys and are increasingly willing to — let’s be blunt — rob
them. Of course, your basic off-the-shelf theft remains popular, but there
are new, more complicated schemes, such as selling the company’s customer
database to competitors or starting a company that utilizes the previous
employer’s core technology that’s been tweaked just enough to avoid get-
ting caught or at least sued. And of course, there are the increasingly pop-
ular hack attacks, rendering a company’s computers inert. Add to those
the growing terrorism threat and it’s easy to see why companies and the
government are willing to spend more on security.
I predict that one of the decade’s best-selling security products will be
“intelligent video.” (See, for example, www.objectvideo.com.) These are
video cameras with an attached computer that can discern illegal activity.
Governments, especially in high-crime areas, are installing intelligent video
cameras on buses, in schools, even at stop signs. (You wouldn’t fail to come
to a full and complete stop every time, now would you?) Companies such
30
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

as retailers and banks will increasingly use intelligent video for loss pre-
vention. And of course, Homeland Security can install them to increase
border security.
College Admissions Recruiter. The United States has almost 5,000 colleges
and vocational-technical schools, 97 percent of which must recruit to fill their
classrooms. Your title may be College Admissions Counselor, but a more
accurate description is salesperson. You must be able to soft-sell — sell 
without appearing to be selling. This is a great job for anyone who likes to
travel and talk with teens and parents. A sense of humor and a repertoire of
clean jokes go far. National Association for College Admission Counseling:
www.nacacnet.org.
Don’t confuse a college admissions recruiter with a college admissions coun-
selor. The recruiter is hired by a college to recruit students to that college,
whereas the college counselor’s job is to help students find a college match-
ing their needs.
Fundraiser/Development Specialist. You may wonder, “Why the term
‘development’?” Because a nonprofit organization develops prospective
donors into actual donors — ideally, big donors. For example, your alma mater
attempts to develop you in the beginning by e-mailing you invitations to free or
low-cost events designed to make you feel closer to the college — to remind
you of the good old days, even if, in fact, they weren’t so good. Half-price tick-
ets to the football game, a glossy alumni magazine and e-zine with stories
designed to make you feel close to the college, and dinners with speeches by
the campus’s best professors are all part of the cultivation process. Then,
when you’re feeling warm and fuzzy about dear ol’ State U, the college starts
with the solicitations — usually with e-mail campaigns and telemarketing
banks. Plus, if according to the alumni questionnaire you completed, you’re a
potential big donor, the college assigns an already-donating alumnus with
similar interests to individually solicit you. A development office keeps pre-
cise records of how much you donate. The more you donate, the more they
ask for the next time. A development officer’s crowning achievement is con-
vincing you to put the organization in your will.
Development jobs tend to divide into cultivators and harvesters. Cultivators
coordinate fundraising events, maintain donor databases, and write pitch
pieces and grant proposals. Harvesters are the direct pitchers. They must
have the ability to get wealthy people to trust them quickly, to ask for large
sums of money without blinking, and to endure rejection. Knowledge of wills
and trusts is helpful. If you’re older and polished, a career as harvester may
work because many donors fit that description. Former sales managers make
especially good fundraising executives. Association of Fund Raising Profession-
als: www.afpnet.org. Chronicle of Philanthropy: www.philanthropy.com.

Auctioneer. “$100 bid, now two, now two, will ya give me $200? $200 bid,
now three, now three, will ya give me $300?” When you think of auctioneers,
you may think of one thing: fast talkers. But there’s more: Auctioneers must
enjoy selling and be masters at creating a sense of urgency while using a
sense of humor. Acting skills can help. Note: The auctioneer chants not just
because it keeps the audience interested, but because it makes things go
quickly. At an average household estate auction, the auctioneer’s chant helps
sell an average of 60 items per hour. Tobacco auctioneers may sell 500 to 600
lots per hour! Half of auction events are real estate and business liquidations,
but auctions are used to sell everything from forests to amusement parks. It’s
becoming better known that auction fever leads to high prices, so good auc-
tioneers are selling high bids. And you don’t need a lot of school to start
chanting. Only one-third of auctioneers have a college degree. Many auction-
eers learn on the job, while others attend short training programs. National
Auctioneers Association: www.auctioneers.org.
(Neat Niche) Fundraising Auctioneer. Many nonprofit groups, from ele-
mentary school PTAs to United Way, have fundraising events. Auctions can
raise big bucks, but most are conducted by amateur auctioneers. That usu-
ally results in lower bids than with a professional. Richard O’Keef Fund-
Raising Auctions: www.letsdoanauction.com.
Other people-oriented careers
Producer. Whether it’s a hip-hop concert, a TV news segment on legalizing
prostitution, a local production of Brighton Beach Memoirs, or a DVD virtual
trip to Tahiti, few things are more fun than coming up with an idea and putting
the pieces together so it becomes a reality. That’s what a producer does. 
I’m not talking just about hiring the actors and behind-the-camera crew. I’m
talking about solving countless problems like this: In the book, Gig, producer
Jerry Bruckheimer tells of having spent a million dollars designing space
suits in which the actors in the movie Armageddon could breathe. In the
middle of the shoot, Ben Affleck fell to the floor, suffocating in his space suit.
The oxygen system had stopped working. Someone had to cut it open. No
harm was done except that it stopped production, and for every lost minute,
hundreds of people must be paid — an expensive meter always is running.
Bruckheimer said, “So there’s a little set story for you. And there are a million
of those.”

year’s income in a few months. International Association for Exposition

(Neat Niche) Game Producer. According to Jill Duffy, managing editor of
Game Developer magazine, you needn’t be a supertechie. Game producers
are more likely to hire the programmers and artists, keep track of the
budget and milestones, set up meetings, and keep people motivated. Less
competitive points of entry: games for cellphones or so-called casual
games, which are quick games such as the classic Tetris and my favorite,
Bookworm. The hardcore PC and PS3 games are the sexiest and therefore
hardest-to-get-into niche of the market, but the casual game segment is, in
fact, the fastest growing. Game Developer Magazine: www.gdmag.com. Dan
Irish’s book: The Game Producer’s Handbook.
Event Planner. This is similar to being a producer without the financial 
risk. Someone else is the producer, and she pays you a fee. This career is the
compulsive’s dream — with endless details to get right, all by an immovable
deadline, plus a Nervous-Nelly client usually adding to the stress. To boot,
you frequently must give up your nights and weekends. To tell you the truth, I
can’t imagine why anyone likes this career, but many people do. Indeed, event
planning is among the more aspired-to careers among my female clients. That’s
the only reason it’s included in this book. (They say they like working on pro-
jects with a definite beginning and end, that it’s aesthetic and people-oriented,
and that it doesn’t require much technical knowledge.) The good news is that
it’s a huge field. The meeting industry, predominantly conventions and expos,
has a national market of more than $80 billion! Other niches: corporate parties
and product rollouts. Meeting Professionals International: www.mpiweb.org.

Trial Consultant. This field has certainly evolved from its start, when a few
activist social scientists tried to help Vietnam war protesters win their cases.
Then, hiring a trial consultant became de rigueur for celebrity defendants: If
OJ Simpson hadn’t retained a trial consultant, who knows where he’d be
living today? Dr. Phil met Oprah Winfrey when she hired his trial consulting
firm to aid in her defense. Now, trial consultants are frequently used by all
sorts of well-heeled clients.
You probably think of trial consultants as helping to pick a jury, but they also
coach witnesses and conduct mock trials and focus groups to try out differ-
ent strategies. Beware if you’re the defendant and the other attorney has
retained a trial consultant. This is a cool career for lawyers who don’t want to
argue, psychologists who don’t want to listen to patients’ problems all day,
and market researchers who’d rather deal with people than data. American
Society of Trial Consultants: www.astcweb.org. Amy Posey’s book: Trial
Consulting.
Temp Agency Owner. Alas, many full-time jobs are being replaced by temp
positions. How can you capitalize? Start a temp agency. You can’t compete
with mega-agencies such as Manpower or Olsten, so pick a profession in which
it’s tough to find good employees — especially a field you know a lot about.
Examples: nurses, association executives, disabled employees, short-order
cooks, medical records technicians, pharmacists, escrow personnel, and
robotics engineers. If you’re successful, you can consider franchising your
operation. American Staffing Association: www.americanstaffing.net.
Relocation Consultant. You’re moving to a new city. What’s the best neigh-
borhood to live in? Which are the best schools? Where should your husband
look for a job? A relocation specialist living in that city can help you. Based
on answers to a questionnaire about your wants and needs, the relocation
consultant points you in the right direction. It’s like having a wise, local rela-
tive. How do you get a job as a relocation consultant? Approach the local
offices of national real estate chains or the human resources of large, locally-
based corporations. Employee Relocation Council: www.erc.org.

Personal Care Facility Owner. Many aging Boomers can’t stand their vari-
cose veins, wrinkles, and fading eyesight. And because the surgeries have
become easier, more people are lining up. Personal care surgery clinics have
been popping up for a while now, but the need, especially in small cities, may
not be saturated. Don’t worry, you needn’t be a doctor. You can be the entre-
preneur who opens the clinic, does the marketing, and hires the doctors to
staff it.
Work with Data
Scientific data
Biologist. No field has done more to improve life. In the last decade alone,
people working in biology/biotechnology have developed
 Food crops that can grow in a previously infertile section of Latin America
that covers 800,000 square miles — an area larger than the size of
Mexico. Thousands of formerly starving people now can eat.
 A method to identify a criminal (DNA analysis) that is thousands of
times more accurate than conventional methods.
 Breakthrough drugs — like new proteins that lessen the effect of heart
attacks, and drugs that greatly extend the life span of people with HIV.
Currently, 300 biotech drug products and vaccines are in clinical trials
targeting cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, diabetes, multiple
sclerosis, AIDS, and arthritis.
I attended a presentation by five Nobel Prize winners. One of the few things
they agreed on was that the field that will make the greatest impact on
humankind in the coming decades is molecular biology/biotechnology. When
most people think of biology, they think of macrobiology: studying different
animals and plants. I recall, in college, seeing cute pictures of endangered
furry creatures. Indeed, many people choose to major in biology with such
visions in mind. But fact is, if you’re considering a career in biology, know
that most of today’s biology careers focus on molecules. From here forward,
biology is mainly math. Actually, the name “biologist” is now misleading.
Today, most biologists are part biologist, part chemist, part mathematician,
and part programmer. They spend a majority of their time on the computer.
Those with a whole-animal biology background will usually be limited to posi-
tions as lab assistants or high school biology teachers.
An oversupply of biology PhDs makes competition fierce for PhD-level jobs 
in biotech unless your background includes computer science, mathematics,
or engineering. Even then, a low-paying one-to-two-year postdoc is usually
required. The good news is that associate-, bachelor-, and master-level jobs
35
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

are available at biotech and pharmaceutical firms. True, you aren’t top
banana, but you can have interesting opportunities, such as running experi-
ments, perhaps assisting in designing them and writing them up, and even 
co-presenting at conferences. In short, you can derive many of the benefits 
of a PhD with less school and less difficulty landing a job. Careers in Biology:

Sciences: www.aibs.org/careers. Nancy Rothwell’s book: Who Wants to be
a Scientist?
(Neat Niche) Genomics Biologist. Now that the human genome has been
sequenced, genomists are starting to discover what each gene does. Genes
have been discovered that control everything from shyness to obesity.
These discoveries, of course, are key to enabling the use of gene therapy
to prevent and cure diseases and to enhance human potential. Progress
has been amazing. A number of years ago now, Princeton University
researchers inserted a gene into a mouse. As a result, the smart mouse,
nicknamed Doogie (for the precocious TV doctor, Doogie Howser), dramat-
ically improved its memory and that of his offspring. This gives hope for
curing Alzheimer’s disease and mental retardation, and, if society decides
it’s ethical, to improve normal people’s memory and that of their children.
In the 1967 movie, The Graduate, Dustin Hoffman got a career tip: plastics.
Today, if I were to give such a tip, it would be genomics. BayBio: www.
baybio.org. BioSpace: www.biospace.com. American Society of Gene
Therapy: www.asgt.org.
(Neat Subniche) Proteomics Biologist. Genes work by expressing (generat-
ing) proteins. Those proteins are the actual building blocks of human func-
tion and of disease. Learning how to fix defective proteins will result in
many cures. For example, scientists at Zycos Corp. identified a protein
that is expressed in nearly every major cancer but not in normal tissue.
Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proteomics.
(Neat Niche) Bioinformatician (Computational Biologist). Scientists used
to study drug candidates one at a time. Now, they can assess a pharmaco-
logical characteristic of 500,000 compounds in days. An individual person’s
genome can be identified within hours. Such advances usher in a new era
of personalized medicine. But all these studies generate an extraordinary
amount of data that must be stored and available in a user-friendly format
for interpretation. Who makes this happen? Bioinformaticians. These com-
bination molecular biologists, mathematicians, and computer program-
mers promise to be the coming decades’ most important behind-the-scenes
heroes. Biotech research companies, universities, and federal agencies are
hiring them. Information: www.bioinformatics.org.
(Neat Niche) Plant Geneticist/Botanist. Plant geneticists have created
high-protein grain that has saved countless lives in developing nations. Less
dramatic, orchids used to be affordable only for the wealthy. Now, thanks to
plant cloning and tissue culture, you can buy a world-class orchid for 20
bucks. (Now if they only figured out how to make them easy to grow.)
36
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

More important, plant geneticists play a key role in figuring out how humans
develop from one cell into highly differentiated adults. This understanding
is crucial to preventing and curing diseases. Although some of this research
can be done only on animals, much can be done ethically and inexpensively
using plants. As a plant lover who likes intellectual challenges and wants
to make a difference, if I were starting over, this may be the career I would
choose for myself. Botanical Society of America: www.botany.org.
(Neat Niche) Agricultural Scientist. Are you a science type who doesn’t
want to be in a lab all day? An ag scientist’s job is to find better ways to
grow crops. You may work on a better way to control downy mildew on
rose bushes or the glassy-winged sharpshooter on grapes or to keep oxalis
weeds from taking over broccoli fields — all with minimal impact to the
environment. Rather than work on control, you may work on prevention:
developing plant varieties genetically engineered to be resistant to pests
and disease. The largest employers are the government and university
extension services. American Society of Agronomy: www.agronomy.org.
(Neat Niche) Entomologist. Locally or in remote jungles, you may gather
and study data on the thousands of new insect species discovered each
year. Which are threats? Allies? How to deal with them? Or you may visit a
farm infested with some little terror and figure out how to nuke it without
nuking the rest of us. Entomology Society of America: www.entsoc.org.
Epidemiologist. With the world ever-smaller, diseases can spread fast. And
with bioterrorism an ever-increasing risk, those diseases can be man-made as
well as natural. Epidemiologists may track and predict an outbreak’s spread
and develop plans for its mitigation. Think avian flu. Or using a combination of
hard science and social science methods, they may help governments develop
plans and policies to help prevent conditions such as obesity or AIDS. The
most responsible positions usually require a doctorate. American Public Health
Association: www.apha.org/public_health/epidemiology.htm.
Pathologist. These detectives of the microscopic try to figure out what, if
anything, is abnormal in a person’s cells or bodily fluids. Clinical pathologists
do that to help an individual patient while investigative pathologists do it to
help solve crimes. (CSI fans know what I’m talking about.) Careers in Pathology:
www.aamc.org/students/cim/pub_pathology.htm.
(Neat Niche) Cytotechnologist. You’re the cancer detector. You examine
biopsied cells using microscopes and chemical tests to see what’s up.
Obviously, this is a career for someone who is careful. A mistake can be
devastating. This career usually requires only a bachelor’s degree.
American Society for Cytopathology: www.cytopathology.org.
Terrorism Expert. Alas, terrorism is likely to provide plenty of job and con-
sulting openings. This profile’s heading, of course, subsumes many different
specialties. For example, governments and companies hire people to try to
37
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

smuggle terrorist weapons onto planes, into ports, and into supposedly
secure buildings. Other specialties: extremist religious sects and cults; politi-
cal extremist groups; unaffiliated terrorism-prone individuals; countries likely
to spawn terrorist groups or state-sponsored terrorism; prevention of con-
ventional, biological, chemical, cyber, nuclear, or radiological (dirty nuke)
attacks; food supply protection; water supply protection; public venue (for
example, arenas or trains) protection; port security; and corporate and com-
munity preparedness planning.
The feds hire the most terrorism experts, but so do states, cities, and mid-to-
large companies. Also, some jobs may be available at disaster-related non-
profit organizations such as the Red Cross. A first step to learning more about
any of those specialties is simply to google them. If you’re interested in a career
in port protection, google such terms as “consultant ‘port protection’” and “expert
‘protecting ports.’” The portal to federal terrorism-related jobs: www.usajobs.

(Neat Niche) Biological Weapons Deterrence Specialist. Biological
weapons are far more dangerous than even nuclear weapons. An airborne-
communicable biovirus released on just a single subway car could decimate
the nation. And bioweapons are far more portable than nuclear weapons —
enough airborne-communicable bioviruses to destroy the United States
can fit in a vial. The National Academy of Science worries even more about
custom-created bioviruses — there isn’t time to develop an antidote every
time a new one is created. The need for deterrence experts is obvious, the
federal budget for it has grown, and the field is far from saturated. Hey, if
you’re intelligent, please get into this career. You could save our lives.

I believe it is impossible to foil all such attacks, and thus, the wisest, although
certainly not foolproof, approach is to attempt to understand and work with
terrorist groups so they’re less likely to want to destroy us.
Hydrologist. Tom Stienstra, author of Sunshine Careers, reminds us that
without water, we have nothing. Hydrologists ensure that water is as safe 
as possible. They gather data and then make water-saving proposals to cor-
porations or government agencies. Although some hydrologists work in labs,
many have offices in the great outdoors. Hydrology is one of the few outdoor
professions that pays a middle-class living and may require, for an entry-level
position, only a bachelor’s degree. Can you picture yourself hiking into wilder-
ness areas to take and analyze water samples, sneaking in reveries by a flowing
stream? Just remember, many hydrologists spend a lot of time in front of a
computer and at the water’s source: frigid mountains and glaciers. A master’s
or doctoral is typically required for hydrology’s higher-level positions. Great

weather — not only tomorrow’s but also next year’s. This has profound impli-
cations. For example, imagine you’re a farmer and you know how wet and
warm the next season will be. You can pick the perfect crop for that weather.
You can be a meteorologist even if you’re too shy to be on the nightly news.
Meteorologists also work in agriculture, for cruise lines, ski resorts, the
Department of Defense, and airlines. Meteorology is for the math and com-
puter person who doesn’t want to be a programmer. Because predicting the
weather requires integrating information from around the globe, a foreign lan-
guage is a plus. Of course, it helps if you’re fascinated with the weather. Half
of the meteorologists are hired by the National Weather Service, which often
requires a master’s, and a PhD if you’d enjoy improving weather prediction.

Geologist. The career for people with and without rocks in their heads.
Many geologists — petroleum geologists, for example — don’t even see the
rocks they’re studying because they’re so far below the earth’s surface.
These geologists use computer data to answer one question: Where should
we drill for oil? Guess wrong and the company loses millions. Guess right and
you’re a genius. You, of course, have lots of cool tools — like gamma ray
detectors — to help you guess right. Much of the work is outdoors and can
be in remote locations for long periods, so it’s a lousy choice if you value
family life and a stable work environment. Most of the unexplored oil loca-
tions are abroad, so if you can speak a foreign language and are willing to
relocate, job opportunities should be ample. The growth area in U.S. geology
jobs is in cleaning up ground-based pollution. What luck: Most of the oil is far
away and the pollution is right here. New employers of geologists are seismic
data brokering companies, but the largest employers are oil companies and
the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, the Interior, and Defense. About.com’s
geology portal: geology.about.com.
(Neat Niche) Planetary Geologist. Is there life on Mars? Can we introduce
life onto Venus? The answers may lie on and beneath the planet’s surface.
Enter the planetary geologist. He may look at samples retrieved from space
missions or simply look at photographs of planets, moons, and comets.
Fewer than 1,000 planetary geologists are employed in the United States.

Most work for universities and NASA. A PhD in planetary geology is a
must. American Astronomical Society: www.aas.org.
Geophysicist. Usually, the earth doesn’t move. That is, unless you’re in love
or there’s a volcano or earthquake. Geophysicists focus on the latter two in
these neat niches. American Geophysical Union: www.agu.org.
(Neat Niche) Volcanologist. When will a volcano erupt? Volcanologists better
not guess wrong. If they predict an imminent gusher and nothing happens,
many people have been needlessly terrified and evacuated. If the volcanol-
ogist says, “No problem,” and it blows, you have a fried community. Accord-
ing to Time, “Volcanology may be the most dangerous science since those
vast laboratories can explode at any moment with a force equal to thousands
of atom bombs.” The United States has fewer than 200 volcanologists, and
most have a PhD. I include very few careers with such poor prospects of
landing a job and that require so much training, but despite the danger,
volkies really love their career, so I couldn’t resist. Volcanologists spend a
lot of time in exotic places studying a fascinating phenomenon. Their work
can save lives and property, and because children are so fascinated with
volcanoes, they visit many schools, usually leaving an auditorium full of
wide-eyed kids. Article, Do You Want to Become a Volcanologist: volcano.

(Neat Niche) Seismologist. So, you think seismologists predict earthquakes.
Sorry, bub. Most seismologists earn their livings creating earth vibrations.
Why would they do that? One reason is that it’s a good way to determine
where to drill for oil. Other seismologists figure out how to prevent mining
disasters — and what to do when they guess wrong. Of course, some seis-
mologists do get involved with earthquakes. They may help design a plan
to make a building earthquake resistant, and try to predict when and
where the next Big One will strike. Unfortunately, to date, despite all the
PhDs hacking away at it, dog barking still seems to predict earthquakes as
well. U.S. Geological Survey’s Earthquake careers portal: earthquake.

Chemist. Yes, you get paid to play with a grown-up’s version of a chemistry
set, but it’s a lot more complicated than mixing two potions and seeing whether
the mixture turns green. You need lots of advanced math in this field. The job
market isn’t great for pure chemists because many jobs today require a chunk
of biology or physics along with the chemistry. Drug companies and materi-
als manufacturers do hire some chemists, with lead positions requiring a
master’s or doctorate. Try not to blow up the lab, huh. Chemical careers:

(Neat Niche) Toxicologist. Toxicologists found the source of the 2006 e-coli
spinach outbreak. How? The DNA of fecal matter on the lettuce matched
that found on one farm. The Texas A&M toxicology home page warns that
such incidents are far from rare: “Hardly a week goes by without hearing
about a chemical that may threaten our health: pesticides in the food we
eat, pollutants in the air we breathe, chemicals in the water we drink. Are
these chemicals really dangerous? How much does it take to cause harm?
Toxicologists answer these questions.” The terrorism threat is further
increasing the demand for toxicologists. A doctorate is typically required
for high-level jobs. Society of Toxicology: www.toxicology.org. Wikipedia
entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toxicology.
Physicist. Want to figure out how the universe began? Create nano-sized
machines to cure disease? Develop the science behind the next generation of
fuel cells or medical imaging machines? How about study things with no con-
ceivable practical application, like string theory? I listened to an entire NPR
show on that and all I know is that string theory has something to do with
groups of quarks (things much smaller than electrons) acting like guitar
strings. I think I’ll leave that to the physicists. American Physical Society
career site: www.aps.org/jobs.
(Neat Niche) Photonics. Your job is to figure out how to move photons (ele-
mental particles of light) so they do some good. And indeed, they can.
They’re used in missile defense, correction of poor sight, welding, barcode
scanners, and fun stuff like laser light shows, holograms, and tattoo removal.
Well, that doesn’t sound like much fun. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/photonics. Optical, Laser and Fiber Optics Resource: www.

Statistician. Where should a gold-mining company explore for gold? In what
districts should a politician campaign hardest? Should the pitcher intention-
ally walk the batter? A statistician helps answer such questions. Yeah, you
can lie with statistics, and not everything can be reduced to probabilities, but
statistics often lead to good decision making. Not a bad payoff for one’s
career efforts. Florence Nightingale said that statistics is the most important
science in the whole world: for upon it depends the practical application of
every other science. The American Statistical Association: www.amstat.org.
(Neat Niche) Biostatistician. You answer questions such as “How effective
is a new drug? How sure are we that this specific gene expresses this spe-
cific protein across an entire population? What are the chances of a side

effect among pregnant women?” Among the many job openings for statisti-
cians I’ve seen lately, by far the most are for biostatisticians. Wayne
Daniel’s book: Biostatistics, 8th Edition.
(Neat Niche) Sports Statistician. Were you the kid who calculated the like-
lihood of this or that happening during the game? This may be your dream
career. Sports statisticians are numeric journalists, creating interesting
stats that enrich a journalist’s article or broadcaster’s reporting. Or your
job may be to keep track of numbers that help a coach decide which play-
ers to play and which to bench.
Can you make a living as a sports statistician? Alas, probably not. Most
sports statisticians work for free or peanuts. Want to try to beat the odds?
Hone your craft by being a high school or college team’s statistician. Don’t
record just the basics; be creative. For example, in the game’s final minutes
when the outcome is in doubt, Biff completes 40 percent fewer passes than
he does in the rest of the game — Mr. Choke — while Rick completes 20
percent more passes — Mr. Clutch. If you prove yourself at the high school
or college level, send work samples — especially that creative stuff — to
producers of pro sports TV shows. Their names are mentioned or listed at
the end of the game. You may even send your material to the Elias Sports
Bureau, which produces stats for Major League Baseball, the NFL, and the
NBA. American Statistical Association: www.amstat.org/sections/sis/
career/index.html.
Cryptanalyst. The government has just intercepted a secret message from a
terrorist organization. Cryptanalysts decode it. A Web site contains thou-
sands of customers’ credit card numbers. Cryptanalysts encode it to deter
hackers. In short, cryptanalysts make and break secret codes. Most cryptana-
lysts have a PhD in math — a secret decoder ring won’t quite do. Wikipedia
entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cryptography. Society for Industrial and
Applied Mathematics: www.siam.org.
Cancer Registrar. Because most cancers don’t have a single foolproof cure,
many treatment protocols are tried for each type of cancer. One way to figure
out which methods work best for whom (for example, African-Americans in
their 60s with leiomyosarcoma and diabetes) is to accumulate treatment
records of every cancer case. Most HMOs, insurance companies, and govern-
ment agencies do that, and the person in charge is the cancer registrar.
(Might I ask why there isn’t a worldwide or even a national database?) This
person doesn’t just enter submitted information into the database; he often
speaks with the physician and even the patient for clarification. May you
never get a call from a cancer registrar. National Cancer Registrar’s

Computer data
Computer Programmer. You get to work on puzzles with a real-world appli-
cation. For example, you may start with a problem such as how to monitor
the amount of electricity Minnesota uses per second. You figure out how that
can be calculated and then use a programming language to “teach” the com-
puter how to calculate it. That part, for really bright people, tends to be chal-
lenging, fun, and addictive. But after the basic program is written, major
tedium usually follows. Debugging often means days of staring at screens full
of numbers, trying to divine which ones are wrong. Another plus, however,
for this career is that programming tools are getting ever better. Of course,
that means that today’s programming languages are tomorrow’s dinosaurs,
so to be happy and successful as a programmer, you must relish the idea of
continually reeducating yourself. The current hot languages are Java, C, C++,
Visual Basic.NET, and PHP.
Alas, with so many programmers in low-cost countries such as China and
India willing to work for a pittance, the average U.S. programmer may soon
have a hard time convincing employers she’s worth a middle-class salary.

(Neat Niche) Wireless Device Programmer. Entire cities such as San
Francisco and Philadelphia are becoming giant wireless hotspots. Cell=
phones have ever-more features, such as full-motion video and wireless
Internet capability. And as Boomers age, they demand wireless technology
to help them through their dotage. For example, researchers are develop-
ing an implantable microchip that monitors an outpatient’s vital signs and
broadcasts anomalies and the patient’s location to his physician. Wireless
jobs are available if you know Java, VXML (for voice recognition), and
WML. Experts Exchange, Wireless Programming: www.experts-exchange.

(Neat Niche) Virtual Reality Programmer. You write software that’s the
ultimate training method: putting students in a virtual duplicate of the
actual situation — military officers in war zones, doctors in surgery,
schoolchildren learning what to do in case of fire, and astronauts in space-
ships. And of course, virtual reality is the goal of video games — witness
how eyetracking is starting to replace game controllers. Soon, controller
cramp from pressing “Shoot” 10,000 times may become a thing of the past.

(Neat Niche) Education/Training Programmer. Do you like the idea of cre-
ating software that helps students learn more while having fun? Although
teacher unions are unlikely to trumpet this, evidence is growing that stu-
dents learn more from good, simulation-centered or even so-called drill-
and-kill software than from a live teacher. Parents and corporate training
departments buy the most education software, but schools are increas-
ingly being dragged along. Encyclopedia of Educational Technology: coe.
sdsu.edu/eet. Educational Software Cooperative: www.edu-soft.org.
(Neat Niche) Web Programmer. The job is usually to take the blueprint
from a Web site designer and bring it to life. Increasingly, Web program-
mers specialize in either the front- or back-end. Front-enders develop the
site’s interface, where a sense of the artistic and what humans will like are
key. Back-end specialists work on such matters as integrating a database
into the site or ensuring that the site is compatible with multiple browsers.
Whether front- or back-end, you need to at least be proficient in Java and
PHP. If your site needs to access information from a database, you need to
know SQL scripting. On the artistic side, common tools include Adobe
Illustrator, Photoshop, Flash, and 3DS Studio Max. But no programmer’s
toolkit is complete without the skills to optimize the site’s search engine
placement. The Web Guild: www.webguild.org. Search Engine Watch:

(Neat Niche) Game Programmer. Of course this sounds cool. The ques-
tion is, how do you get hired? Most developers still learn on their own, but
there are a growing number of university-based training programs. Game
Developer magazine’s site has a list. When you create a cool sample pro-
gram, send it to game companies. Easy way to find them: read reviews of
games on www.gamespot.com. They usually include the name of the
developers. Then use google.com to find their Web site, and e-mail 
your creation to them. Game Developer magazine: www.gdmag.com.

(Neat Niche) Computer Security Programmer. The Feds consider com-
puter systems one of terrorism’s most likely targets. In addition, from both
inside and outside an organization, hackers steal information from com-
puters to make money or to try to disrupt a company just for the heck of
it. This produces an ever-stronger demand for security programmers to
foil the thieves. Also, corporations, the FBI, and the Department of Justice
hire these cybersleuths to search the Net to nab software pirates. The
Business Software Alliance estimates that nearly one in two software 
applications is pirated. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Newsletter Publisher. According to the Newsletter Publishing Association,
50 percent of new newsletters succeed, a higher percentage than other small
businesses. And your chances are even better if you do things right:
 Choose a narrow niche. It’s easier to sell 1,000 newsletters for home
health nurses than 100 for nurses.
 Choose a topic that has an endless stream of new information that your
target readers crave. Sample titles: Citywide Wi-Fi Update, Power Plant
Financing, Proteomics This Week, Currency Options Insider, iPhone News,
and Employment Law Digest. Or focus on creating custom newsletters for
nonprofits or clubs.
 Be sure an existing publication doesn’t meet the need.
 Focus on your online edition. Distribution costs are much lower than
print.
 To market a newsletter successfully, make the most of such e-marketing
tools as Google’s AdWords.

Employee Background Checker. When one of former San Francisco Mayor
Willie Brown’s key employees was caught lying on his resume, His Honor
shrugged, “Everyone lies on their resume.” Alas, he’s not wrong. Depending
on which study you believe, 33 to 45 percent of job applications contain “cre-
ative writing” — a degree never completed, a claim of no criminal record, or
an inflated work history. As job and tenant applicants seem ever more likely
to stretch the truth and government regulations tighten about what can and
can’t be asked, companies increasingly turn to pre-employment checkers to
verify information on resumes and to contact former employers. The Internet
enables you to learn an awful lot about an applicant in just a few minutes. Yet
companies routinely pay more than $100 per background check. This is a
low-investment home business that would seem to have a high probability 
of success. National Association of Professional Background Screeners: www.

Actuary. How much should an insurance company charge each employee of
the Western Widget Company for health insurance? That’s a typical question
asked of an actuary. Actuary is a good career for someone who wants a
career that applies math to practical decisions, and that offers salaries that
often reach six figures. More good news: You can achieve the highest level of
actuary (Fellow) without a graduate degree. You do have to pass a series of
arduous exams for which you can study at home or take classes at local actu-
ary clubs or at universities. Society of Actuaries: www.beanactuary.org.
Economist. This is another career for the math-centric person who wants to
do something that’s at least potentially practical. Economists answer such
questions as, “How will our company be affected if the minimum wage goes
up?” “What are the costs and benefits of legalizing gambling in this county?”
“What has happened to solar cell production and why?” In other words, econ-
omists predict and analyze production and consumption trends to help gov-
ernments and companies make policy. Problem is, people’s actual behavior
often doesn’t follow the predicted model. I’m always amused when I read a
panel of blue-ribbon economists’ predictions. They rarely agree. Nevertheless,
a master’s or doctoral degree is often required. List of Economics Careers:

Web Store Owner. If you keep it simple, you have a reasonable shot at earn-
ing at least a sideline income, as they say, earning income while you sleep.
 Sell on both your site and on eBay. Pick a niche: fish tanks, Japanese net-
suke, whatever you love or know a lot about. Don’t pick anything perish-
able, like African violets. A newbie won’t be able to anticipate sales well
enough — you’ll likely have a house full of dead plants.
 Try to get a self-explanatory name for your site. So, if you want to sell net-
suke, go to a domain registration site (my favorite is www.godaddy.com)
47
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

and find something close to netsuke.com, which is taken. That site
offers suggestions. For example, bestnetsuke.com is currently avail-
able. Good enough.
 Next step: Create and host your site at store.yahoo.com. Not only is
its site-creation software sophisticated yet idiot-resistant, but your site
will also be well-placed on Yahoo!’s search engine. An alternative: an
eBay store: pages.ebay.com/storefronts/start.html.
 Keep your site simple: It must load quickly, enable you to find what you
want quickly, and check out quickly. Forget cutesy graphics — they look
amateurish and slow things down. Speed sells.
 To maximize traffic to your site, try to make it the definitive one in your
niche. For example, if you’re selling window boxes, make sure your site
has a great selection of fairly priced ones. Yes, you need a JPEG picture
of each, but each should be small enough that the pages load quickly. To
increase traffic further, build an e-mail list: Invite visitors to sign up to
get an RSS feed or regular e-mails about your site’s new features and
products; publicize your site on your Facebook, MySpace, or linkedin
profile; post a promotional video on You Tube; give live and teleclass/
Webinar workshops (collecting the names of attendees); write an article
for an on-target publication (including a tag line with your Web site, of
course); and/or start a visitor forum on the site.

Forest Service. And in the search for the exotic, markets are building for the
likes of dog sledding, hang gliding, sky diving, mountain climbing in the
Himalayas, and exploring Antarctica and the Brazilian jungle. The market for
adventure and travel is getting crowded, so nichecraft is particularly impor-

Appraiser. Yes, there’s the mundane sort of appraising businesses, machin-
ery, and real estate. But some appraisers are more like professional treasure
hunters, sifting through collections of coins, stamps, jewelry, antiques, or art,
and figuring out whether there’s booty among the ordinary. You can find 
oddball niches too: appraising race horses and Lionel train collections, for
example. As businesses turn over more quickly and the population ages, the
need for appraisers is increasing: in estate planning, or in divvying up the 
pie after the fact. And because big bucks are at stake, you may be well paid.

Work with Words
Writer. Self-expression — it’s a powerful driver for many people, including
me. My life gains meaning when I know that others will read what I have to
say. And written self-expression has particular power because there’s time 
to be more reflective than when speaking. Although your odds of making a
living as a novelist or poet aren’t much better than the chances of Al Qaeda
embracing Israel, neat writing niches exist that may allow you to write with-
out having to eat ramen three times a day. For example, in addition to tradi-
tional writing jobs such as journalist, new writing careers have emerged in
recent years — for example, eBay listing writer and professional blogger. In
most writing careers, you must write not only well, but also quickly: a few
publishable pages per day is a rule of thumb. Writer’s Resource Center: www.

(Neat Niche) Professional Blogger. Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan
Schwartz says, “My blog has become my single most effective vehicle to
communicate to all of our constituencies.” Few CEOs blog, but ever-more
companies are hiring bloggers to add an edgier and more human tone to
their Web site. Make money from your own blog by selling products and/or

(Neat Niche) Film Critic. Here’s how to increase your chances of making a
living at this long-shot career — without having to get a film studies degree.
Step 1: Study Christopher Null’s book: Five Stars! How to Become a Film Critic,
the World’s Greatest Job. Step 2: Watch a movie. Step 3: Write a review with
a distinctive style. Step 4: Show your review to three trusted people. Step
5: Make revisions as a result. Step 6: Repeat Steps 2 through 5 with at least

100 films. Be sure to include some classics. Step 7: Send your half dozen
favorite reviews to at least 30 employers of film critics. Also post them on
amazon.com and imbd.com.
(Neat Niche) Web Writer. Your writing must be concise; generally laced with
bullets, punchy anecdotes, and statistics; and packed with fresh content —
the Web operates at warp speed. Web writing is the ideal career for some-
one with a supermarket full of knowledge about one field, the ability to
quickly track down additional tasty morsels, and then boil them all down
into a quick but satisfying snack. Writing for the Web: crofsblogs.

(Neat Niche) Medical Writer. Writing Preparing for Your Hysterectomy is a
typical assignment for medical writers. Many medical writers translate
prevention practices and treatments into plain English. Who’ll hire you?
Medical Web sites (such as HealthWatch or WebMD), HMOs and other health
insurers, hospitals, clinics, and publications that appeal to older readers. If
you have a strong science background, biotech and pharmaceutical com-
panies may hire you to produce regulatory documents. To me, the latter
sounds less cool, but I hear the money’s good. Article: healthcare.

(Neat Niche) Politician’s Writer. Most politicians, from the town councilper-
son to the president, need writers. Political writers craft copy for the pol’s
site, fundraising letters, speeches, and see-how-much-I’m-doing-for-you
newsletters. One approach to landing a job is to write a fundraising letter
for your favorite local politician, and then send it as a sample.
(Neat Niche) Industry Publications Writer. Ever thought of writing for
Pizza Today? It’s a magazine for people in the pizza biz. Thousands of
trade rags exist and, because it’s not sexy work, tend to pay writers well.
(Neat Niche) Ghostwriter. Here’s a back-door route into ghostwriting, a
cool gig. Contact celebrities, especially those who have been outside the
headlines for a few months — last year’s hero is usually afraid he’s had his
15 minutes of fame. Ask the person whether he’d like you to write a book
about him. If he agrees, develop a proposal together and send it, probably
through an agent, to publishing houses. When the book comes out, the
star is listed as the author in huge type and your name is Lilliputian, if it
appears at all. The name of Hilary Clinton’s ghostwriter for It Takes a
Village, Barbara Feinman, never appeared on the book. Celebrity ghost-
writing may be the fastest route to a well-paying, if secret, book deal. Eva
Shaw’s book: Ghostwriting. Jennie Erdal’s book: Ghosting.
(Neat Niche) Copywriter. This job offers one of the surer routes to a non-
starving writing career. Many copywriters think first about ad writing, but
also consider company annual reports, Web or mail order catalog copy,

consumer information booklets, and restaurant menus. The key to being a

(Neat Niche) Technical Writer. In this in-demand niche, you develop user
manuals, articles about new products, instruction booklets, press releases,
and online help files. It’s often a high-pressure job because you’re brought
on after the product is completed and everyone’s eager to get it on the
market. Online Technical Writing Textbook: www.io.com/~hcexres/

(Neat Niche) Writing Coach. So many writers and wannabe writers have
trouble: coming up with the right idea, structuring their work, dealing with
writer’s block, craving feedback on their work, or requiring editing help.
Even if you can’t make a middle-class living as a writing coach, it could
well be one ring in your three-ring-circus writing career. To get a sense of
what they do and how they market themselves, google “writing coach.”
Journalist. If you can land a decent-paying job, journalism is a great career.
You have opportunities for creativity, you’re often learning something new,
and you feel you make a difference. Many factors, however, make it ever-more
difficult to find a journalism job that pays a middle-class salary. Print and
broadcast organizations are merging or folding, and many remaining ones are
using more nationally syndicated content. Thousands of bloggers, vloggers,
and other citizen journalists are doing journalism for free, and before long,
online search engines will provide on-demand custom “newspapers,” based
on information from multiple news organizations.
Like a career in acting or film directing, journalism is one of those job aspira-
tions that often results in poverty. I was on a top floor of the Time-Life Building
talking with four editors from one of Time-Warner’s major magazines, and
everyone agreed how obscene it was that colleges continue to welcome more
and more journalism majors even though only a small fraction will ever make
a middle-class living in the field. Indeed, a 2006 Wall Street Journal op-ed said,
“In 2005, newspapers cut 2,000 jobs; this spring more people graduated from
journalism school than ever before.”
So why is journalism on the list of cool careers? Because it’s so rewarding
that it’s worth considering — if you love interviewing and digging up informa-
tion, and are excellent at cranking out clear prose rapid-fire. To increase your
chances of landing a good job, specialize; science, technology, or ethnic 
specialists may have an edge. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Information Media.

Many articles and TV news segments are slanted more than the Leaning Tower
of Pisa. Even in prestigious media outlets, too many journalists select stories
mainly so they can sell their viewpoint (for example, anti-George Bush). They
cram each article full of support for their position, carefully nuancing every
word, adding just enough balance to make it look fair. Biased coverage is the
main reason the media is distrusted. You may never completely control your
biases, but the public trust demands that you make your best effort.
(Neat Niche) TV Newswriter. You write the words that those public-idolized
puppets called TV news anchors read, down to the segues between stories.
You have to write concisely and with edge. Ted White’s book: Broadcast
News Writing, Reporting, and Producing, Fourth Edition.
Book/Magazine/Web Site Editor. The fun part of being an editor is finding
great projects, convincing your editorial/publication board to say yes, and
then helping the author to mold the project into something wonderful and
salable without deflating the author into inaction. But getting into this field 
is tough, and your first jobs are usually low paying with long hours. If you
insist on the book business, consider moving to the Big Apple, where 90 per-
cent of the business is located. One rarely considered starting place is as an
agent’s assistant. You read unsolicited submissions (called the slush pile),
and make connections with editors. Scan acknowledgments in recent books
to find beloved agents. In magazines, try to get a first job as a fact checker or
researcher. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/editing. American
Society of Magazine Editors: www.magazine.org/careers. American Society
of Newspaper Editors: www.asne.org. Diana Athill’s book: Stet.
(Neat Niche) Web Site Editor. A Web site wants to be sticky, stimulating
return visitors. Web editors are in charge of making that happen. One part
writer, one part editor, one part businessperson, the Web editor comes up
with content ideas for the site (a four-part series, a weight-loss tracker
that requires you to check in, and so on), recruits writers, polishes sub-
missions, and works with the tech person to make them Web-ready.
Association for Internet Professionals: www.association.org.
(Neat Niche) Copy Editor. Many people write, but to get their writing into
publishable form often takes some doing. That’s why print and online pub-
lishers hire copy editors. Writers who want to maximize chances of publi-
cation also hire copy editors to polish their drafts into publishable shape.
American Copy Editors Society: www.copydesk.org.
(Neat Niche) Resume Writer. Even many confident people find having to
write their resume scary. “One page or two?” “How can I sound good with-
out bragging?” “What about that employment gap when I was hitchhiking
cross-country?” Enter the resume writer, a wordsmith who helps people
present their best selves while resisting the temptation to overinflate. It’s a
53
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

good career for writers who enjoy interviewing people and can quickly con-
vert that interview into a concise, logical resume. Linking yourself to an
employment Web site, outplacement firm, or headhunter attracts more
clients and work. So does conducting a resume seminar at job fairs and
job-seeker support groups; sending postcards to seniors at local colleges
(student directories are usually made public); and specializing in military
personnel moving to civilian life, medical, legal, or technical professionals,
or the physically handicapped (getting referrals from a local department
of rehabilitation). Resume software: ResumeMaker Professional, download-
able from www.resumemaker.com. Professional Association of Resume

Librarian. If you picture a mousy bookworm, update your stereotype. Today’s
librarian is a sociable computer whiz whose job increasingly focuses on help-
ing patrons retrieve obscure information from mountains of electronic and
print resources. This is an underrated career. Most librarians enjoy helping
patrons dig up information. They learn in the process and keep up-to-date on
the latest books and online resources. Librarians who specialize in medicine,
other sciences, law, or engineering make more money. American Library
Association Library Resources: www.ala.org. Priscilla Shontz’s book: The
Librarian’s Career Guidebook.
(Neat Niche) Private Librarian. Hospitals, government agencies, prisons,
magazines, TV and radio station news departments, and research depart-
ments of corporations and nonprofit organizations have libraries. Would
you ever have thought Revlon had a library? The Brookings Institute? The
United States Air Force? Newsweek magazine? Most large law firms? All
hire librarians. I recently gave a talk to 100 special librarians. Most of them
love their careers. Special Libraries Association: www.sla.org.
(Neat Niche) Information Retriever/Independent Search Specialist.
You’re already overwhelmed with information, and it’s going to get worse.
Your savior is the information retriever, who for a fee, goes beyond what a
librarian has time to do. Retrievers search the Net and databases such 
as Dialog and Nexis and phone interview the right people, providing you
with a digest of the best information. The information mountain is so 
overwhelming that information professionals specialize, for example, in
genomics, engineering, mergers and acquisitions, politics, or digital art.
How do you get clients? Pick your specialty, give talks at its professional
association, and write for its publications. Association of Independent
Information Professionals: www.aiip.org.
Information Abstractor. Would you enjoy synthesizing articles into a para-
graph or two? Can you do it quickly? In an hour, an abstractor must abstract
two to three articles. If you can do that, you’ll be in demand because of the
54
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

need to distill that relentless information explosion. Major hirers: Web sites,
corporations needing to distill material for scientists and executives, and
publishers of research abstracts. You’ll be particularly in demand if you have
content expertise in law, medicine, engineering, chemistry, or real estate.

Indexer. An index can make the difference between a book and a good book.
Peter Farrell, author of Make Money from Home, calls a good index, “a minor
work of art but also the product of clean thought and meticulous care.” That
work of art must usually be done quickly — publishers usually give indexers
manuscripts just a few weeks before publication. Indexing is a self-employed
occupation that requires a person with the odd combination of enjoying the
solitary work of creating an index and the ability to go out, ask for business,
and insist on reasonable compensation: $3 to $4 per manuscript page or $30
to $40 an hour. A degree may not be necessary. American Society of Indexers:

100 books and offers impressive-sounding training): www.abbington.com/

Ethicist. Dilemma: Robots can now create robots. Efficient yes, but could
they eventually create a man-destroying army of robots? Probably not, but to
avoid the risk, should research on robot-creating robots be illegal? If these
practices are made illegal, will that only transfer control of the technology to
terrorist groups and rogue nations? Such dilemmas, along with more common
ones, like when should doctors stop treating a dying patient, fill the ethicist’s
inbox. American Society of Law, Medicine, and Ethics: www.aslme.org.
Radio Guide Publisher. Why are there so few radio guides? TV guides are
ubiquitous, yet few radio guides exist. When getting into your car, wouldn’t
you like to know what music is playing on which station? Who’s debating
whom on talk stations? To make a living as publisher of a radio guide, get
local radio stations to e-mail you their program listings — they should be
eager because you’re offering them free publicity. Then sell the listings for
newspapers or local Web sites to publish. For additional income, publish an
advertising-funded radio guide to distribute free at supermarkets. New York
Online Radio Guide: www.nyradioguide.com.
Graphologist/Handwriting Analyst. You can find handwriting analysts at
more than just carnivals. Police departments, attorneys, and employers also
use graphologists to catch forgers or to verify who wrote the ransom note.
Bonus: Graphologists can be the center of attention at a party. Wikipedia

Work with Things
Artistically done
Magician. Oh to pull a rabbit out of a hat, saw a woman in half, or link the
solid rings. And to do it in Vegas or L.A.’s Magic Castle, America’s centers of
magic. But it requires years of practice, plus showmanship and a sense of
humor. Alas, most magicians don’t end up in Vegas. To have even a chance 
of conjuring up a living at magic, you probably must convince corporations
to hire you for their parties and trade shows. You’ll also have to fill in with
street shows in tourist areas, in train or bus stations, and at parades, and
with private parties for kids and adults like me who continue to be fascinated
with prestidigitation, welcoming it as a low-tech escape from a too-fast, too-
serious world. Despite the liabilities, few careers are as, well, magical. Interna-
tional Brotherhood of Magicians: www.magician.org. Jim Steinmeyer’s book:
Hiding the Elephant.
Specialty Cake Baker. Most bakers are poorly paid production machines.
Special-occasion cake bakers are an exception. You must be an artist, offering
delicious masterpieces unavailable at your basic bakery. It should be the kind
that when the bride and groom look at wedding pictures, they smile and say,
“That was some cake!” If I wanted to become a cake baker, I’d look in my
Yellow Pages under “wedding services” and visit wedding cake makers until I
found a baker of superlative cakes who was willing to let me apprentice.
Alternative: Ask local restaurants whether they want you to bake cakes for
them. You think restaurants want to bake in-house? At a very fancy hotel’s
Sunday buffet brunch, I saw someone take the last piece of cheesecake. I
asked a server whether there might be any more. He reached under the table
and pulled out a bakery box with another cheesecake. Sandra Gurvis, in her
book Careers for Non-Conformists, suggests that for cake bakers, a high metab-
olism and/or health club membership helps counteract the inevitable taste
tests. Bo Friberg’s book: The Professional Pastry Chef.
Artist/Graphic Artist. Get real. If you have visions of hanging out in your
loft, splattering paint on some enormous canvas, congratulations — you have
a cool hobby. The Princeton Review profile of artist careers reports that “as a
purely self-expressing career, 90 percent of artists make under $1,000 per
year on their art.” If you expect to make a living as an artist, know that 75 per-
cent of the art available in the United States is produced by the ad industry.
Much of the rest appears on Web sites. And almost all is computer-generated
art produced by people with excellent freehand drawing skills enhanced by
the computer. You must make good friends with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop,
and possibly 3ds Max and Maya. The good news is that demand for computer
artists is growing. More good news: In production art, degrees don’t count; your
portfolio does. Send it to art directors at ad or design/marketing agencies —
and don’t forget the small houses. Oh, one more sad truth: Only a third of
people who start a career in graphic arts last five years.

If I was trying to make a living as a fine artist, I’d drive samples around from
gallery to gallery seeing whether they would take my work. I’d also create a
commercial line of work that took me just an hour or two per piece to make
and see whether I could sell them at craft fairs at a price that would yield me a
decent hourly rate for my time. I’d create a Web site that sold my stuff while
also serving as an online brochure. Finally, I’d schmooze relentlessly in the art
world. In no field is the aphorism, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know,”
more true. About.com’s graphic design portal: graphicdesign.about.com.

Many art schools’ Web sites, brochures, and salespeople paint an overly 
optimistic picture of career prospects. For example, a site may tout a few suc-
cessful graduates. They don’t address the question: Of every 100 students
who start attending your school, what percentage earn enough money from
their art even to pay for their education, let alone earn a middle-class living?
If you’re interested in art school, ask the admissions representative that
question. The usual answer is, “I don’t know.” If the percentage was high, I
bet they would know.
(Neat Niche) Animator. An architect develops a blueprint for a house, but
the customer is nervous. Will it really be livable? So an animator develops
a walk-through animation of the premises. Now the customer can do as
many virtual walk-throughs as he likes before the first nail is hammered.
This is just one of the new opportunities for animators. Now computers
can, at moderate cost, do animations sophisticated enough to appeal to
adults that previously were impossible at any price. Science and industry,
TV, films, Web sites, and video games have jumped on the animation band-
wagon. Downsides are low pay and highly structured work — this isn’t the
career for freewheeling artists. Also, much animation work is now offshored
to low-cost countries. Top animation schools: California Institute of the
Arts and Toronto’s Sheridan College. Animation World Network: www.awn.

(Neat Niche) Special Effects Artist. Create impossibilities that appear
before your very eyes in movies or computer games. Have kinky black hair
transform in seconds into straight blond tresses, a 70-year-old’s face
morph into a teenager’s, a lovely day degenerate into Armageddon. Key
software: Maya and SoftImage. Letter to an aspiring special effects artist:

(Neat Niche) Jewelry Maker. Most jewelry makers like creating only unique
pieces. They dislike repeat production and marketing. If that’s you, do you

beads. Too, some people make a good living just setting stones. Article,

(Neat Niche) Textile Designer. So many of my female clients wax rhap-
sodic about their love of fabric, color, and design. For them, textile design
is a dream career: computer-centric, yet still enabling you to touch, feel,
and intuit what looks beautiful not only to you but also to users. Surface
Design Association: www.surfacedesign.org. Marypaul Yates’s book:

(Neat Niche) Muralist/Faux Finisher. If you can’t get a government grant,
convince local merchants to hire you to paint inspiring murals on graffi-
tied buildings, in restaurants, in apartment house or office building lob-
bies, on freeway underpass walls, even on billboard-sized signs. Faux
finishing is the art of making a surface — usually a wall — look like some-
thing else, such as marble or leather. It’s less sexy than mural painting, but
potentially offers more gigs. The Ultimate Resource for the Faux Finisher:
www.muralsplus.com. Rebecca Pittman’s book: How to Start a Faux
Painting or Mural Business.
(Neat Niche) Commission Artist. If you can create paintings that look good
on the walls of corporate buildings or rich people’s living rooms, place an
ad in a magazine that your potential clients read (for example, corporate
executives may read Forbes, and wealthy people may read Town and
Country). Include a few samples and text such as, “Create a gallery-quality
painting to your specifications for a fraction of the cost.” Article, Making
Art on Commission: www.artbusiness.com/privcom.html.
Technical Illustrator. Three of the words I most dread are some assembly
required. The “easy instructions,” despite the drawings created by technical
illustrators, usually don’t help. Maybe you’ll do a better job. Technical illus-
trators tackle projects more important than my patio furniture. They may, for
example, create drawings of the inner workings of a rocket engine. Article:
www.adda.org/content/view/41/46. Society of Illustrators: www.society
illustrators.org.
(Neat Niche) Biomedical Visualization Specialist. This field, formerly
known as medical illustration, has come a long way. Thanks to software
and imaging equipment, medical illustrators are no longer limited to what
they can draw by hand. For example, they now use computer-generated
brain maps to demonstrate differences between a Nobel Prize winner and
a developmentally delayed person or between the parts of the brain that
are activated when thinking about math or about sex. Information:

(Neat Niche) Ocularist. You paint artificial eyes, typically in front of
patients, so you can match their other eye perfectly. So, in addition to art
skills, you need an empathic personality. I’d guess that with the right

patient, a Cyclops or pirate quip or two may make the process more pleas-
ant. American Society of Ocularists: www.ocularist.org.
(Neat Niche) Forensic Artist. Forensic artists create those composite
drawings of criminal suspects, reconstructions of dead or maimed victims
to use in solving crimes, and computer-generated drawings, slides, and
videos that attorneys use to present their cases. Because each situation is
different, because you’re not a robot, and because the stakes are high, you
have a shot at being a nonstarving artist. Neville’s Forensic Art World:
www.forensicartist.com.
Conservator. A conservator’s idea of bliss is restoring old paintings, furni-
ture, autographs, books, and musical instruments to their former glory. A
combination painter, refinisher, and chemist (watch those fumes!), most con-
servators are hired by major museums, libraries, and archives, and in the
restoration of historic properties. Alas, few jobs are available. American
Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works: aic.stanford.edu.
National Trust for Historic Preservation: www.nationaltrust.org.
Cinematographer. It seems that everyone wants to be a film director, but
what are the odds of making a living at it? Think lottery. How can you derive
many of the benefits of directing with fewer people competing for jobs? Try
cinematography. Like directors, cinematographers direct on film sets. The
major difference is that rather than directing people, they direct the cameras.

Lighting Designer. This is another backdoor into a film or theatrical career.
Lighting designers are hired not only in film and theater, but also for trade
shows, and for lighting major buildings — hotels, corporate lobbies, muse-
ums, concerts, and theme parks. International Association of Lighting
Designers: www.iald.org.
Foley Artist. Remember the sounds of the steamy sex scenes in the last
movie you saw? They probably were created by a foley artist making dispas-
sionate love to his own wrist. That crunching snow as the avalanche rescuers
try to save the day? Walking on cornstarch in a burlap bag. Foley artists create
sounds that are easier to record than those made during an actual shoot. The
good foley artist must be an audile: able to look at an object and imagine what
type of sound it produces. Take, for example, that horror flick in which a char-
acter’s guts are pulled out: It’s raw chicken. Article and links: www.skillset.
org/film/jobs/post_production_sound/article_4768_1.asp.
Exhibit Designer/Builder. Many artistic types who like to sling a hammer
dream of becoming film or theater set designers, but that market is extraordi-
narily tight. But exhibit designing/building, a similar field, is less known and
therefore easier to break into. You build the equivalent of theater sets for trade
shows, expos, and museums. Exhibitor magazine: exhibitoronline.com.

Holographer. Looking for a career that melds art and science? Wanna make
something cool? Try holography. Holographs are no longer just 1960s psyche-
delia; the field is growing. Holographs are used in new-product promotion, on
ID and credit cards, in movie special effects, and even in medical diagnosis.
Holograms may even be used as a replacement for digital memory storage,
because they can store data in three dimensions, rather than just two.
Although some holographers learn on the job, others attend a special school,
such as the one at The Museum of Holography: www.holographiccenter.

Holography.
Tool and Die Maker. This is one metal artist who can expect to earn a
living. Working from a blueprint or instructions, you develop the prototype
tools and dies for metal or plastic products — from coins to wrenches.
Although you need artistic skills, you get lots of help from designers. Tool
and die designing and cutting are computer assisted. No college is required.
Most die makers learn as apprentices. For you, could this be a career to die
for? (Groan.) Precision Machined Products Association: www.pmpa.org.
Perfumer. Come up with a fragrance that smells great and different — that’s
what perfumers do when new perfumes, soaps, laundry products, shampoos,
lotions, or candles are created. Most perfumers learn their art in an extensive
apprenticeship. Procter and Gamble offers a prestigious one. Entrants to that
program typically have a master’s degree, yet half of perfumers have no
degree at all. Article: careers.nsta.org/pdfs/perfumer.pdf. Perfumer

Computer Chip Layout Designer. This job essentially requires you to fit
New York City onto a postage stamp. It sounds harder than it is. But like a
chip — a potato chip — it’s addictive. You can find yourself working 24 hours
straight because, “I’m getting it. I’m getting it. It’s almost done.” You take
engineer’s specs for the 10,000-device chip, and feed that information into a
computer program that lays it out for you. Unfortunately, the computer layout
invariably has errors that you have to fix by hand. That’s where the art comes
in. Your job is to cram those devices in as tight as possible and still get the
chip to work. David Comer’s book: Fundamentals of Electronic Circuit Design.
Neon Sign Maker. How’d you like a career of twisting colored glass into
special shapes? Tom Unger of Krypton Neon says you have a reasonable shot

Sailboat Captain. Some people seem to have the sea gene — they feel they
are meant to be around water. If that’s you, you can make a living at it if you
really put your mind to it. Government regulations require extensive on- and
off-boat training, which can cost almost as must as a yacht — and take as
long as building one by hand. After you’re licensed, pick a niche: Want to
transport yachts? Move to Hawaii and take tourists on scuba trips? Take ’em
on a history buff’s trip down the river or whale watching off the California
coast? All are possible, but only if you develop a serious marketing plan and
have a personality that can win over everyone from your customers to hotel

Harbor Pilot. This is a sailor’s job that doesn’t require long stints away from
home. Your job is to dock ships or take them — the world’s largest moveable
man-made objects — out to sea. You start as a $50,000-a-year deck hand or
engineer and move up to captain. If you’re talented and a relentless networker,
you may get to be a harbor pilot and earn a solid six-figure salary. Why do
they earn so much? Because even experienced sea captains don’t have the
skills to navigate all sorts of vessels through the shallow, tricky waters of
ports. And sometimes, after steering the ship to sea, they must climb down
from the ship and into a small boat to get back to harbor. The job market for
the top-paying jobs is tight as the tightest sail, but jobs that pay a middle-
class salary are aplenty: fear of oil spills has resulted in regulations requiring
most large ships to be towed into dock, often by a tug, but sometimes simply
by advising the ship captain. Some tug operators and aspiring harbor pilots
get their experience by working on party or fishing boats or by attending a
two-year maritime program, such as that at the National Maritime Academy
or one of the five state maritime Academies: California, Maine, Massachusetts,
New York, and Texas. Article, You’re a What? Harbor Pilot: www.findarticles.

Heart-Lung Perfusionist. In open-heart surgery, the surgeon can’t work on
the heart if blood is squirting all over the place. So a machine is hooked up 
to an artery to receive the blood. The machine then, like a heart and lungs,
pumps blood and air back into an artery on the other side of the heart and
lungs, and circulation continues. Meanwhile, the heart is relatively bloodless
so the surgeon can work. The surgeon hooks up the blood vessels and the
perfusionist runs the machine. Sounds straightforward, but talk to any perfu-
sionist and he’ll mention one word: stress. One mistake can be one too many
for a bypass patient. Only calm people with a high tolerance for stress do well.
They must also be mature enough to accept the great responsibility of this
work. The big upside of this career is that you’re intimately involved in saving
people’s lives. Perfusion is the smallest healthcare profession with only 3,200
practitioners in the United States. Heart Pumper: www.heartpumper.com.

Prosthetist/Orthotist. An amputee walks in. You’re going to make his artifi-
cial limb or brace. You must be able to work face-to-face with amputees and
create limbs and braces with great precision. After all, you’re preparing a
61

device on which that person’s ability to use hands or feet depends. Extensive
training is required, but many of the schools are public so it doesn’t — pardon
the expression — cost you an arm and a leg. Orthotics and Prosthetics Careers:
www.opcareers.org.
Pedorthist. A person needs special shoes — not because she has to match a
dress, but rather because her feet are deformed from disease or injury. A
podiatrist (foot doctor) sends her with a shoe prescription to a pedorthist,
who examines and measures her feet and then designs or modifies shoes to
fit. Demand for pedorthists exceeds supply, and training normally takes less
than a year. Pedorthics Footwear Association: www.pedorthics.org. Board
for Certification in Pedorthics: www.cpeds.org.
High-Security Driving Instructor. How’d you like to teach police officers
how to conduct a high-speed chase? Show a diplomat what to do when a ter-
rorist starts shooting at her car? Show an FBI agent how his car can intercept
a moving vehicle? That’s what security driving instructors do. Unless you
want to take a vow of poverty, forget about being a regular ol’ driving instruc-
tor — they often earn little more than minimum wage. That isn’t enough for
the privilege of having a terrified aspiring driver let go of the steering wheel
at 30 miles an hour and head straight for a brick wall — yes, it happens. BSR,
Inc. (a security driving school): www.bsr-inc.com.
Irrigation System Specialist. Nearly every homeowner, farmer, and golf
course owner needs an irrigation system. And if you already have one, chances
are it needs to be fixed or upgraded. Irrigation system design is a great career
for someone who likes a combination of science and art, indoors and out-
doors, business and environmentalism. Environmentalism? Yup, because
modern irrigation systems save water, and fertilizing through the irrigation
system allows less chemical fertilizer to be used. The Irrigation Association:
www.irrigation.org offers training courses.
Musical Instrument Repairperson. Kids aren’t known for their tender
treatment of anything, let alone school musical instruments. That means
plenty of repairs are needed. And, of course, even some older folks’ instru-
ments need work. Musical instrument repair is a great career for fix-it types
who prefer to avoid things electrical. It’s a low-stress job. Working conditions
are usually ideal, and you’re nearly always assured of pleasing your customer.
You should know how to play the instrument. Otherwise, how do you know
whether you fixed it? Noted training institutions include Badger State Repair
in Wisconsin, Renton Technical College in Washington, and Red Wing
Technical Institute in Minnesota. National Association of Professional Band
Instrument Repair Technicians: www.napbirt.org.
(Neat Niche) Piano Technician/Tuner. This is a good niche if you prefer to
be out-and-about rather than in your workshop all day. And, if you get bored
with just tuning, you can learn piano rebuilding. Despite the presence of
electronic aids, piano tuners need a good ear. Unfortunately, the market
62

for piano technicians is poor — synthesizers sound as good as many
pianos, are less expensive, can create many more sounds, are portable,
and needn’t be tuned. Piano Technicians Guild: www.ptg.org.
Sound Engineer. You’re the person sitting in the back of a live theater or
concert hall with a control board so big it looks like you’re running a space-
ship. Before the music starts, you set up the right mikes in the right places,
and if the performance is for recorded rather than live performance, afterward
you use digital tools to manipulate and mix the sounds into perfection. Many
sound engineers have a bachelor’s degree in sound engineering, but a possi-
ble alternative is to start by reading Gary Davis’s book, Sound Reinforcement
Handbook, and learn audio editing software such as ProTools, Reason, Digital
Performer, Live, or Logic. Then beg your way into a volunteer apprenticeship
at a theater or concert hall. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Audio_engineering. Article: www.wikihow.com/Become-a-Sound-
Engineer. Audio Engineering Society: www.aes.org.
Conference Recording Specialist. Tens of thousands of professional meet-
ings take place each year in the United States alone, but only a fraction offer
recorded sessions for sale on CD or MP3 to those who missed sessions. This
is a simple business. Equipment needs are modest: digital recorders, micro-
phones, a CD duplication machine, and perhaps video equipment for record-
ing keynote addresses. Marketing is straightforward — Associations Unlimited
(available online through many large libraries) lists most of the world’s asso-
ciations, along with their size and upcoming conferences. Then just call large
associations in your local area and make your pitch to the conference coordi-
nator. You may be able to get a yes simply by touting the convenience to the
organization’s members, but your chances multiply if you offer the associa-
tion a piece of the action. Audio-Visual Education Network, a company that has
recorded more than 2,000 conferences: www.aven.com.
Computer Repairperson. As products become ever-more computerized —
from PET scanners to iPhones — ever-more people are needed to repair
them. It’s a nice job with a pleasant work environment and the chance to use
your brains to diagnose problems, and it’s in high demand. And when you fix
their mission-critical gizmo, they’ll love you. Morris Rosenthal’s book: Start
Your Own Computer Business.
(Neat Niche) Notebook Computer Repairperson. Because notebook com-
puters are delicate and moved around so much, they break. Training doesn’t
require a PhD. A few months should do. Start with Morris Rosenthal’s book,
Computer Repair with Diagnostic Flowcharts. Then get certified by one or
more manufacturers, such as Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, or Sony.
(Neat Niche) Hard Disk Repairperson. People are willing to pay through
the nose to retrieve the data they should have been backing up.

(Neat Niche) Personal Digital Assistant Repairperson. PDAs such as
Treos and BlackBerrys are expensive and so justify repairing. Their porta-
bility increases their dropability and, in turn, your employability. Article:

(Neat Niche) Biomedical Equipment Repairperson. This high-tech repair
niche pays well because when the machine must be fixed, it must be done
perfectly and fast! A patient on a heart-lung machine can’t wait long. Roger
Bowles’s book: Critical Careers: A Guide to Opportunities in Medical
Equipment Service.
(Neat Niche) Robotics Technologist. Does building and fixing robots sound
like fun? Until recently, robots mainly welded cars and elevated highway
beams. Today, they assist with hip replacement surgery, climbing and
painting rusty utility towers, and installing space stations. One perhaps
surprising job requirement: the ability to lift 50 pounds. Robots haven’t yet
been to WeightWatchers. RoboticsOnline: www.roboticsonline.com.
Computer Forensics Expert. Want to take a byte out of crime? Rev. William
Guthrie’s wife was found dead of Temazepan poisoning. A computer forensic
expert searched the good minister’s computer to find that he had visited
many Web pages on that very drug. The pastor is now serving a life term.
More often, computer forensics experts unearth employees who steal trade
secrets and destroy company data. Information: www.forensicfocus.com.

Edition.
Telecommunications Specialist. Today’s corporate telecom system goes
well beyond a switchboard. It likely includes BlackBerries, cellphones, per-
haps satellite, videoconferencing, voice over IP (Internet phones), computer
networking, and yes, regular ol’ phones. The telecom specialist helps a com-
pany figure out which combination of gizmos it needs and then supervises
the installation. Listening and planning skills are key — a system is only good
if it meets a company’s current and anticipated needs. Society of Telecommuni-
cations Consultants: www.stcconsultants.org.
Solar and Wind Energy Technologist/Installer. Few of the many technol-
ogist careers nurture the soul of the environmentally conscious like this one
does. Not only are you helping to keep the ecosystem clean, but you’re also
probably working for clients who are similarly minded. And, with today’s high
energy prices and the need to become energy-independent from the Middle
East and Venezuela, demand for alternative energy sources is increasing,
although at least in the short-term, the largest demand for solar and wind
energy is in third-world countries — they don’t have the infrastructure to
support conventional power plants. Most solar installers learn on the job,
although some community colleges offer programs. American Solar Energy
Society: www.ases.org.

Millwright. Few high school graduates picture themselves as crucial to the
operation of a megacorporation, yet millwrights are. They install and repair
heavy industrial equipment. And it can be rewarding work: It can feel great to
be called on to figure out what’s wrong, and under time pressure, solve a
problem that affects an entire plant’s operation. You’re also called on when a
new piece of million-dollar heavy machinery is delivered. You’re there to
unload, inspect, and move it into position. That can mean deciding which
ropes, cables, and hoists to use. It often means constructing special wood or
metal foundations and using lasers to get the accuracy down to the millime-
ter. Fast-growing specialties include robotics and medical diagnostic equip-
ment. Most millwrights learn as apprentices or in community college pro-
grams. It’s a largely unionized field, so the pay’s good. Information: www.
kwantlen.bc.ca/trades/millwright/careers.html.
Handyperson. When I tell friends that I have a good handyperson, their eyes
light up — they’re hard to find. That’s largely because ever-more high school
students are eschewing the trades for a white-collar career. So, if you have
handyperson skills, you’ll likely find yourself with plenty of customers grate-
ful to pay you well. Being a handyperson is a fun career because you get to
work on a range of projects that are fairly simple. Well, not simple for a klutz
like me. Sarah White’s book: Start & Run a Handyman Business.
(Neat Niche) Senior Retrofitter. This is an Entrepreneur magazine Hot Pick.
“The Boomers are getting old but they don’t want to see themselves as get-
ting frail,” says Jim Lapides of the National Association of Home Builders
Remodelers Council. “Making stairs easier to climb or lowering light
switches may ease the aging process, but many seniors won’t seek out
such retrofits.” So the NAHB encourages remodelers to suggest retrofitting
while doing routine jobs in seniors’ homes.
(Neat Niche) Noise Control Specialist. Many owners of residences and
workplaces near airports, freeways, schools, and factories willingly pay 
for some peace and quiet. This is a high-value specialty, yet the skills
required are often modest. Often, all you’re doing is insulating, double-
glazing, and weather-stripping windows and doors. Information: www.
soundproofing.org.
I don’t understand why leaf blowers are legal. They are the noisiest things this
side of an atom bomb, and the noise lasts longer. Plus their engines spew out
carcinogens. And for what? To blow leaves around? What’s wrong with a rake?
Electrician. I’m shocked that more people aren’t becoming electricians. If
you’d get a charge out of a career that requires working with your hands and
your brain, this career could light up your life. While many electricians plug
in via a four- or five-year apprenticeship, others get wired on the job, supple-
mented with classroom or correspondence courses. According to the federal
government’s Occupational Outlook Handbook, working as an electrician 
is among the best-paying of careers not requiring a college degree. And 
65
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

surprisingly, electricians are seriously injured by electricity at only half the
rate of the general population. Just don’t be color-blind: All electrical wires
are color-coded! Elizabeth Lytle’s book: Careers as an Electrician. International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers: www.ibew.org.
Automotive Technician (Car Mechanic). Get that image of a grease-
covered dude out of your mind. Today’s automotive technician may spend
almost as much time with a computer as with a wrench. Cars are heavily
computer controlled, as is the equipment used to diagnose problems. If you
have the ability to understand a complicated repair manual and a nose for
diagnosing what’s wrong, this is a better career than it used to be. More good
news: Many automotive techs get their first professional job with no training
other than having played around with their own car. New opportunities are
available for women because the work has become more automated, and
physical strength is less important. Career Voyages: www.careervoyages.
gov/automotive-service.cfm.
(Neat Niche) Mobile Auto Repairperson. Every car needs tune-ups, brake
jobs, and so on, and nearly every car owner finds it a hassle to get them:
Drop off the car and somehow get to work in the morning, and then some-
how get back to the shop after work. Enter the mobile auto repairperson.
He does the work right where you park your car for work. What a busi-
ness: big demand, little competition, and ample markup. Ideal clients: large
companies with an employee parking lot. Explain to their human resources
director that by allowing you to offer repairs in the lot, employees won’t
need to take time off work to get their cars serviced. Google “mobile auto
repair” to find examples of such businesses.
Mobile Car Detailer. Many people want their cars polished and cleaned
inside and out but don’t have the time to do it themselves or to take it to a
shop where they have to sit around waiting for it to be done. Enter the mobile
car detailer. While the customer’s car is parked at work or at home, the mobile
car detailer does the job. This is another of those low-investment, no-brains,
high-markup, easy-to-satisfy-the-customer businesses. One marketing approach
is to get local new car dealers, especially luxury brands, to give a coupon for
a half-price detailing to each new-car buyer. Luxury car buyers want their
babies to keep looking good, and you know they have disposable income.
One discounted detailing may yield a customer who’ll keep buying your ser-
vice for years. A variation: Set-up shop in an airport, employee, or shopping
mall parking lot. Eileen Figure Sandlin’s book: Start Your Own Automobile
Detailing Business.
Avionics Technician. In a $20 million airplane, $16 million is avionics (elec-
tronic equipment). It’s been said that today’s airplanes are flying computers.
That means plenty of avionics to fix and plenty to upgrade. Electronics are
always getting better, so many people are retrofitting — much cheaper than
buying a new plane. Avionics technology is a career for tinkerers who read
magazines such as Popular Mechanics, and of course, who like airplanes.

“Dull-normal” Business Owner. Thomas Stanley, author of The Millionaire
Next Door, found that a disproportionate number of millionaires owned what
he calls “dull-normal businesses,” such as window manufacture, welding con-
tracting, pest control, transmission repair, mobile home park maintenance,
sand blasting, and used truck parts. The book goes on to say that these
people, despite their career’s lack of status, are generally happy with their
worklives. Thomas Stanley’s books: The Millionaire Next Door and Millionaire
Women Next Door.
I’ve found that status is often the enemy of contentment. I’ve seen more
happy small business owners than doctors, lawyers, and executives.
Surveyor. Is that airport runway level? What are a park’s legal boundaries?
Where does your neighbor’s land end? Surveyors figure these things out.
They still use the old-fashioned theodolites on tripods, but increasingly use
satellite-based Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Geographic Information
Systems (GIS). Surveying is a fine career for someone who doesn’t have a col-
lege degree but is comfortable around algebra and geometry, likes to learn as
an apprentice, and wants an outdoor career with some status. The director of
California’s state apprenticeship programs told me that of the hundreds of
apprenticeable careers, he’d say that surveying was the best. The job market
is tight. American Congress on Surveying and Mapping: www.survmap.org.
Geographic Information Specialist. How fast is a forest fire spreading?
What’s the best location for a highway? Worldwide, which crops will be
bumper? (The last is a favorite question of commodities traders.) Geographic
information specialists use satellite photos, lasers, and computers to create
maps that answer these questions. Sounds like you need a PhD, but only a
bachelor’s or master’s is required. American Society for Photogrammetry and
Remote Sensing: www.asprs.org.
(Neat Niche) Photogrammetry Technician. You prepare maps of inaccessi-
ble regions using aerial photographs. This career requires just two years
of education after high school. Wilfried Linder’s book: Digital
Photogrammetry: A Practical Course, 2nd Edition.
(Neat Niche) Precision Agriculture. Instead of blanketing farms with pesti-
cides and fungicides, precision agriculturists use computers and global
positioning systems to enable farmers to apply chemicals on an as-needed
basis. Precision Agriculture: www.precisionag.org.
Drafter. Can you picture it: sitting at a drafting table with triangles and a T
square drawing blueprints? Forget it. Although you still need freehand draw-
ing skills, almost all drafting today is done with a computer-aided design and
drafting (CADD) program. Drafters take the designs of an engineer or archi-
tect to create blueprints of everything from toys to skyscrapers to rockets.

Tile Setter. This strikes me as the ideal construction career: Progress on
each job is steady and readily apparent, and the results look pretty. Training
is short, usually on-the-job, although apprenticeships are available. And
here’s the kicker — pay is higher than for most construction trades. Perhaps
that’s because of hours spent on your knees and the toll the chemicals take
on your hands. But pay also is higher because half of tile setters are self-
employed, which is double the rate in other construction trades and a sign
that tile setters find it relatively easy to get work. National Tile Contractors
Association: www.tile-assn.com.
Locksmith. This is the only career in which you don’t get arrested for picking
locks. It’s one of the best hands-on, physically undemanding occupations:
strong need, short training, and many grateful customers. Just think of all those
people locked out of their homes or cars, and companies and homeowners
who need to keep the bad guys out. As security threats rise, demand for high-
tech entry systems grows. Locksmith profile: www.apprenticesearch.com/
fpTrades/locksmith.asp. Associated Locksmiths of America: www.aloa.
org. Bill Phillips’s book: The Complete Book of Locks and Locksmithing, 6th

Farrier. Horses’ hooves grow like your nails do, and when they’re over-
grown, a farrier must trim them and reshoe the horse. The saying goes: “No
hoof, no horse.” Pay is excellent — $50,000 to $125,000 a year is typical.
Perhaps that’s because few farriers can do it after age 45. It’s said that every
farrier has only so many shoeings in him. Other downsides: You must be
careful to ensure you don’t cripple the horse and that it doesn’t give you a
career-ending kick. But if you love the idea of doing physically demanding
work with horses, are good with your hands, and don’t mind having to face a
career change in your 40s, horseshoeing can be a lucky career choice.

Gemologist. A gem of a career: looking at beautiful jewelry all day and decid-
ing how much each piece is worth. Even better, after only a few months, you
can become one of only 1,000 people to be certified by the Gemological
Institute of America. Never again will anyone be able to pawn off a cubic zir-
conium as a diamond on you. If you can live with rhinestone pay, you may
find this a sparkling career. Gemological Institute of America: www.gia.edu.

Arborist. A career in which you start at the top — top of the tree, that is,
pruning it, topping it, bracing it, and spraying it. When you climb down, you
also advise on which tree to put where, and how to plant and care for it so
that — unlike the feeble specimen in front of my house — it thrives. Do a
good job and you’ll have bolstered Joyce Kilmer’s case: “I think that I shall
never see a poem lovely as a tree.” Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/

Personal Chef. The United States Personal Chefs Association estimates that
25,000 personal chefs could find employment in the United States, yet only
5,000 are active in the entire world. This career is better than restaurant
cheffing because you cook smaller numbers of meals so you needn’t spend
long days, nights, and weekends standing over a hot stove. And unlike when
starting out in a restaurant, you design all the menus, a veritable executive
chef. United States Personal Chefs Association: www.uspca.com. American

Dog Trainer. Do you have the patience to teach Rover not to chew up the
furniture or pee on the floor when Rover’s owner doesn’t? Do you like the
challenge of convincing a dog to let you walk it rather than have it walk you?
Consider a career in dog training. Best way for you to train is to visit a few
local training centers, watch a few pros work, and ask your favorite for an
apprenticeship. Most states don’t have licensure requirements. Anyone can
claim to be a dog trainer, so choose your mentor carefully to avoid getting
bitten. American Dog Trainer’s Network: www.inch.com/~dogs.
(Neat Niche) Service Dog Trainer. We all know about guide dogs for the
blind, but demand is increasing for dogs for the deaf. Your job is to train the
dog to alert its master to specific sounds like a smoke alarm, a ringing phone,
and a knock at the door. Because these dogs are generally large, and much
of the training requires moving the dog, assistance dog trainers must be
physically strong. National Service Dog Center: deltasociety.org.

do? Typical jobs are sniffing out drugs for the United States Customs
Service, sheep herding, and finding injured people in wreckages for local

Pet Sitter. Americans are nuts about their pets. Forty-three percent of
United States households have pets, more than the percentage of households
with kids! And pet sitting, which a decade ago was a novelty, today is an
established career. Pet sitting can be done three ways. You can open your
home to Muffin, live in Muffin’s home while her owners are gone, or make
69
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

daily stops at Muffin’s home. Don’t think that pet sitting is the same as pet
playing. Crises occur. Muffin can be sick or develop a case of separation anxi-
ety when you show up. In such cases, you must instantly become a pet shrink
or find yourself with a pooch who refuses to go for a walk or who takes a bite
out of your leg. More often, it’s a matter of accommodating pet idiosyncrasies,
like my cat who likes to roll around in the tub each morning after I shower. To
keep the cat happy, the pet sitter moistens the tub and puts the cat in. The
more likely way to make a middle-class income from pet sitting is to have a
staff of sitters, but that means you don’t get to play with Muffin. National
Association of Professional Pet Sitters: www.petsitters.org.
Pyrotechnician. Staging pyrospectaculars sounds like a blast, but it’s not
easy to soar into this field. The problem is that it’s dominated by a small
number of private, mainly family-run businesses that like to keep their sky
shows to themselves. But if this career sounds more exciting than a rocket’s
red glare, here are some good ways to start. Visit American Fireworks News:
www.fireworksnews.com. Next, attend training offered by a local fireworks
company during the spring or the one-day course offered by the Pyrotechnics
Guild International (www.pgi.org). Work as an assistant at a July 4th show
or two. It’s seasonal work for most people in the field, but a small percentage
keep busy year-round shooting fireworks for movies, TV, theater, concerts,
and sporting events. American Pyrotechnic Association: www.americanpyro.

Product Tester. How’d you like to play with toys for a living? Be a toy tester
for Mattel or Hasbro. Michael Ferraro tastes Godiva Chocolate for a living.
Jack Brashears’s job is tasting Jack Daniels whiskey. Product testers check
out everything from software to cars. The field has limitations, though. A rather
lazy person contacted the Simmons Mattress Company to ask whether it uses
mattress testers. The answer was no.
(Neat Niche) Computer Game Tester. I include this because it somehow
had to be in a book called “Cool Careers.” But having spoken with some
game testers, it’s a terrible job. You’re put in a room with many other testers,
which means the room must be kept cold to keep all the computers from
overheating. Most of the time, you’re not playing the game, you’re trying
to break it — for example, you bump against each of the game’s 9,000 walls
to be sure nothing untoward happens. And because there’s always a rush
to get the game out, the game company often has you work 12 hours a day.
Plus, the pay is abysmal — typically around $10 an hour. Employers can
get away with that because ten zillion game fanatics think it’s a cool career.
Not. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/game_tester.
Diver. I wish I could tell you that the reality matches the stereotype: gliding
through glistening tropical waters, harvesting abalone. Fact is, 90 percent 
of divers are construction workers for whom diving is just a mode of trans-
portation to the job site — except that you have the added challenge of doing
it under the sea, so you can’t run down to Home Depot for a part. That said,
70

diving has pluses. Within a few years of deciding to become a diver — 
admittedly at low pay and with long hours — diving proves to be one of the
few outdoor careers that doesn’t require a college education and that can
earn you $45,000 to $75,000 for a nine-month work year. Engineers can make
more. You get to travel all over the world — often on a moment’s notice. And
there are prized neat niches: police divers who look for guys who have been
fitted with cement shoes, research divers who assist marine biologists, and
journalist divers who write articles and take pictures for magazines, books,
and even screenplays. Before you take the plunge (I couldn’t resist), remem-
ber that a typical job is working in the Gulf of Mexico, repairing oil rigs.

Work with People and Data
Optometrist. “Better with lens A or lens B?” After a while, I can never tell
and feel like a dunce. In any case, optometrists examine, diagnose, and treat
eye conditions, usually by prescribing glasses or contact lenses. In some states,
they’re allowed to do some minor surgery. Optometry is among the most
rewarding health careers because it identifies problems that usually have a
ready cure. And because the population is aging, and because optometrists
are a lower-cost alternative to ophthalmologists (medical eye doctors), the
job market for optometrists is good. Association of Schools and Colleges of
Optometry: www.opted.org. American Optometric Association: www.aoa.org.
Orthoptist. This is another option for people who want to be a doctor but
don’t have the grades or desire to spend that much time in school. Like an
eye doctor (ophthalmologist), but under his general supervision, you check
vision, perform tests for everything from depth perception to eye muscle
problems, and do patient education. Orthoptists more often work with chil-
dren. A bachelor’s degree plus a two-year program enables you to start in a

Pharmacist. You’re not just filling prescriptions. You’re often a front-line
healthcare provider, teaching diabetics how to inject themselves with insulin,
assisting with blood pressure monitoring, and ensuring that people know
how to take their medications. The latter isn’t as easy as it sounds. Many
older people must take many medications, each of which must be taken at a
different time, some of which must be taken on an empty stomach, others
when not drowsy. Perhaps the most important thing a pharmacist does is
ensure that drugs can be taken together. The TV show Dateline did a test in
which an obviously pregnant woman walked into ten pharmacies asking
whether two drugs could be taken together. Six of the ten pharmacists said
yes. In fact, when a pregnant woman takes those two drugs together, it’s
lethal. Each year, thousands of people are hospitalized because they take 
prescription medications improperly. Pharmacists can be lifesavers.

Some of the more interesting pharmacy jobs are in drug companies’ research
departments and in hospital pharmacies. In the latter, in addition to filling
prescriptions, you may attend grand rounds, instruct interns, and assist sur-
geons in preparing infusions. As in many other fields, the training requirement
has been ratcheted up: now a Doctor of Pharmacy degree is standard, which
typically requires seven years of post-high-school education. American Asso-
ciation of Colleges of Pharmacy: www.aacp.org. Fred Gable’s book: Opportuni-
ties in Pharmacy Careers. Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education: www.

Genetic Counselor. People are ever-more aware that they’re much affected by
their genes. The upshot of Time and Newsweek cover stories is that personal-
ity and intelligence are heavily mediated by their biology. What do genetic
counselors do? Example: A husband and wife both suffer from severe depres-
sion. They’re thinking about having a child. A genetic counselor helps them
understand the odds that their child will suffer from depression, facilitates
their deciding whether to get pregnant, and helps them make peace with their
decision. People enter this field from a wide range of disciplines, including
biology, psychology, nursing, public health, and social work. National Society
of Genetic Counselors: www.nsgc.org. Human Genome Project’s profile of
genetic counseling: www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/

Dietitian/Nutritionist. They’re not just in the hospital basement any more.
Now, companies hire dietitians to plan healthy meals for their employee cafe-
terias and to promote sensible eating habits. (Frankly, I’d rather have an
Indian food buffet.) Government uses them to plan such things as school
menus. Food manufacturers and supermarket chains use dietitians to evalu-
ate prepared foods and put interesting low-calorie recipes, such as endive
salad with radicchio and sun-dried tomatoes (yuck), into their ads.
Health spas, weight-loss clinics, and prisons use dietitians to make sure visi-
tors have a balanced diet. We don’t want to lack any of the four basic food
groups, now do we? My daughter says that our fridge contains a different four
basic food groups: snack foods, jams, condiments, and science experiments.
The previously mentioned dietitian careers are growing, but most dietitians
still are kept busy with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, in hospitals, clin-
ics, and in their own private practices. I’m still hungering for that Indian food
buffet, but I’ll settle for some chow fun (fat, greasy, delicious Chinese noo-
dles). American Dietetic Association: www.eatright.org.
Patient Advocate. It requires Magellan to navigate the labyrinthine health-
care system. Most people, especially when ill, aren’t the best navigators.
Enter the patient advocate. You help ensure that the patient gets to see the
desired specialist; you do research so the patient is more informed when talk-
ing to the doctor; you may monitor the patient in the hospital to ensure the
pills really are meant for her; you sort through the mountains of bills and, if
necessary, negotiate fees with the healthcare provider, insurance company,
72

or other payer. (“Medicare, how dare you refuse to pay for that surgery!”)
The confluence of aging Boomers with an ever-more complex healthcare
system means unlimited demand for a persuasive, persistent person willing
to do the vital work of patient advocacy. Some hospitals and HMOs hire
nurses and social workers as patient advocates, but an enormous unmet
need remains. Patient Advocacy Foundation: www.patientadvocate.org.
Manager. Many people like to manage projects and other people, and that’s
a good thing. Despite all the downsizing, the United States still has millions of
managers. What makes a particular management position good? The specific
industry or government agency isn’t so crucial. Instead, look for the following:
 An organization with enough money to do things right and pay you 
reasonably
 An organizational culture that values excellence and its people
 Compatible co-workers, supervisees, and supervisors
 A product or service you believe in
Assess those things before accepting a position.
That’s what you’re looking for, but what are employers craving? Kathryn and
George Petras, in the book, Jobs, describe today’s employable manager:
“Multilingual, a generalist with technical skills, computer competent, a doer,
not a follower, a team player or team leader, a change agent.”
You need to know about some downsides to a career in management. The
workplace hierarchy is flatter, so opportunities for promotion are fewer. Indeed,
a recent American Management Association survey of middle managers found
that only 43 percent thought their job was secure, compared with 72 percent
in 1991. And while on the job, managers certainly have their work cut out for
them. Their bosses demand ever-more productivity at the same time as new
laws make firing incompetents even tougher. And often, you’re asked to super-
vise people who may be halfway around the world. Because of all the down-
sides, I believe that management can be considered a cool career only if you
make the effort to see that the job you accept meets the requirements previ-
ously listed. About.com’s management portal: management.about.com. The
Wall Street Journal’s Executive Career Site: www.careerjournal.com.

(Neat Niche) College Administrator. A college campus is a great place to
be a manager. Who can resist a beautiful environment, intelligent people,
learning opportunities all around you, a pro-social mission, and work
hours that tend to be more moderate than in the private sector — not to
mention that things really lighten up between terms and all summer? And
few organizations hire as many managers: often multiple layers of manage-
ment for everything from governmental affairs to the physical plant. A
downside is that office politics are particularly vicious on many college
73
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

campuses. And political correctness is epidemic — how ironic that univer-
sities, traditionally the clarion callers for free speech, are today among its
greatest censors. Not surprisingly, colleges want their managers to have
graduate degrees. It doesn’t look good if an organization selling degrees
doesn’t require them of its managers. Nancy Martin’s book: Career
Aspirations & Expeditions.
(Neat Niche) College Student Affairs Administrator. This career has 
nothing to do with steamy dorm room flings. College student affairs admin-
istrators coordinate the nonacademic part of student life, from student 
orientation to graduation. For example, they supervise the fraternities,
coordinate residence hall activities and intramural sports, and sponsor
antidrug programs. National Association of Student Personnel Administrators:
www.naspa.org.
(Neat Niche) Government Manager. Aspiring managers shouldn’t over-
look government positions. Eighty percent of government jobs are man-
agerial and professional compared with 25 percent in the private sector. In
addition to quantity, government jobs often offer higher-quality benefits,
stability, offshore resistance, and colleagues dedicated to the public inter-
est. Plus, government agencies are encouraging more customer-service
orientation among their employees, so the stereotype of the semicomatose
government worker is becoming less accurate. Links to government job
sites: www.rileyguide.com/gov.html.
(Neat Niche) Court Administrator. One thing I learned since writing the
previous edition of this book is that for many people, a job’s setting can be
as important as its tasks. Courts tend to be well funded, attractive, peace-
ful workplaces — unless, of course, two lawyers are screaming at each
other or a perpetrator decides to go ballistic in the courtroom. (Oh, that
was a TV show. Sorry.) Courts need administrators to do everything from
coordinating judges’ schedules to figuring out how to get enough jurors
and developing more efficient systems for processing traffic tickets. (I
have a bachelor’s degree in traffic school.) And because these are govern-
ment jobs, benefits are good, vacations long, and job security maximum.

(Neat Niche) Manager in a fun business. Any of these turn you on: toy
company (Cranium’s and LeapFrog’s corporate cultures are well regarded),
ice cream making (Ben & Jerry’s?), adventure travel company, fashion or
cosmetics, country club, sports team, MTV, dance studio, car company
(Porsche?), plant nursery, sporting goods firm? In a 2006 Business Week
survey of large employees, guess which company was rated the #1 best to
work for: Disney. (Maybe I should give my assistant a pair of mouse ears.)
(Neat Niche) Performing Arts Manager. Many aspiring actors, singers,
and dancers, who have realized why the word “starving” so often appears
next to the word “artist,” move to the back office as a way of staying
74
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

around the field they love. Today’s performing arts managers do more
than supervise ticket sales. Indeed, their main job is often to direct
fundraising: coordinate galas, e-mail solicitations, and schmooze with
potential donors. The coolest such job may be artistic director, who gets
to choose what goes onstage and hire the director, crew, and perhaps per-
formers. Performing arts manager salaries generally are low, but many
people are willing to live modestly for a life even tangentially related to
their creative passion. North American Performing Arts Managers and
Agents: www.napama.org.
(Neat Niche) Information Technology Manager. The term “IT manager”
subsumes three kinds of jobs. You can manage an application, such as a
database. You can manage a desktop; that is, select, install, and support
the organization’s computers, including its laptops and PDAs. Or you can
manage its infrastructure: for example, its backbone and security system.
Beware of becoming too technical and not leaderly enough. According to a
Computerworld blue-ribbon panel, by 2010, most programming and similar
technical worker-bee work will be offshored to low-cost countries. The
successful IT manager of 2010 will need to be a “versatilist”: having just
enough technology skill to speak with techies and a deeper ability to
manage large projects and contribute to the business as a whole.
Of course, whether you’re a generalist or specialist, IT is among the world’s
fastest-changing fields. If you love life on the cutting edge yet have the
communication skills to work with mere mortals, IT management gives you
the opportunity for money, learning, and advancing the world’s ability to
communicate and conduct commerce. (See separate profiles in this chap-
ter for Systems Analyst, Network Administrator, Database Administrator,
Hardware Engineer, Software Engineer, and Web Developer.) Computerworld’s

(Neat Niche) Work-Life Manager. According to Self magazine, this job title
didn’t even exist 15 years ago. Yet today, thousands of companies have
hired managers to develop and implement family-friendly work policies, such
as flexible work scheduling, dependent care, and family leave. Most such
managers have a human resource background. Average salary: $75,000.
Work-life managers are overwhelmingly female. Alliance for Work-Life
Progress: www.awlp.org. Work-Life and Human Capital Solutions:
www.workfamily.com.
(Neat Niche) Project Manager. The project can be a conversion of enter-
tainment content to AppleTV format, an expansion into the Mexican market,
or building a satellite. In any case, the project manager’s job is to develop
a design for the project and then coordinate its completion, usually using
scheduling software. This job is good for someone who is second best in
many things; for example, a software project manager needs to be good if
not tops in programming, managing, art, interface design, and marketing.

Project managers like their job because it has clearly defined milestones.
More and more project management jobs will be one-offs: you’re hired 
for a specific project, and when it’s done, you have to convince some 
other employer that your skill set is ideal for the job. Wikipedia entry:
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/project_manager. Scott Berkun’s book: The
Art of Project Management.
I find it sad that ever-more workers must work on a project basis. That forces
them to spend much of their worklives looking for their next few months of
employment. More important, they’re denied the extended-family experience
of working with the same folks for a long time. I know that just-in-time hiring
is efficient, but I have the sense that its net effect on society is negative.
(Neat Niche) Product Manager. Being in charge of a product, even if it’s
toilet paper, is fun. You get to supervise all decisions: how thick and soft it
should be, whether it should be embossed with dots or doves, what picture
goes on the packaging, how the sales force pitches the product, whether 
ad dollars are weighted more heavily toward print, TV, Web, or point-of-
purchase, and whether the ads should show the product being used. 
Well, not that. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/product_
management. Donald Lehmann’s book: Product Management.
(Neat Niche) Facilities Manager. You run an organization’s facilities: decid-
ing where to lease, developing its environmental sustainability plan, hiring
the maintenance crew, and continuity management (how to get the facility
up and running again after a disaster). My favorite subniche: stadium man-
agement. International Facility Management Association: www.ifma.org.
Frank Booty’s book: Facilities Management Handbook, Third Edition.
(Neat Niche) Association Manager. Thousands of professional organiza-
tions exist, from professional associations to chambers of commerce. Each
uses managers. What do they do? Typically they ensure that new members
are recruited, the membership list is maintained, dues are collected, the
newsletter is sent out, the Web site is optimized, and meetings and confer-
ences are planned and promoted. One way to get a job created for you is
to approach organizations that have been volunteer-run and are ready for a
step up. Or start your own association. Surprisingly, many fields don’t have
one. American Society of Association Executives: www.asaecenter.org.
(Neat Niche) City Manager. You’re involved in all aspects of running a city,
from distributing the budget to overseeing park renovation to hiring key
personnel. City managers are among the more powerful government offi-
cials who don’t have to run for election. A master’s in public administra-
tion is usually required. International City/County Management Association:
www.icma.org. Douglas Watson’s book: Spending a Lifetime: The Careers of
City Managers.
(Neat Niche) Environmental Manager. Government agencies and corpora-
tions hire environmental managers to develop plans to minimize pollution
76
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

to water, air, and soil quality, and to develop remediation plans when things
go awry. Corporate environmental managers also draft environmental
impact reports before expanding operations. The WWW Virtual Library:
Environmental Management: www.gdrc.org/uem.
(Neat Niche) Nonprofit Manager. It’s true that nonprofit management is
especially difficult because staff is often largely volunteer and funds are
limited, but The Cause is sometimes enough to make it all worthwhile. Oh,
and while salaries are generally low, that’s not true at the top. According
to a 2005 Chronicle of Philanthropy survey, the median compensation for the
241 nonprofit chief executives who responded to the survey was $327,575.

(Neat Niche) Public Affairs Manager. For altruistic and selfish reasons,
many companies, TV and radio stations, nonprofits, universities, and hos-
pitals work hard at being good community citizens. Your job is to direct
those efforts. You may set up a community blood pressure screening, a
Christmas toy giveaway, or sponsor a neighborhood dispute resolution
service. Larger corporations often set up foundations to donate money to
local charities. The usual point of entry is a college internship or volunteer
position. Public Affairs Council: www.pac.org. Nicholas Henry’s book:
Public Administration and Public Affairs, 10th Edition.
(Neat Niche) Foundation Program Manager. How’d you like to supervise
the giving away of money to worthy causes? Corporations, government
entities such as school districts, and wealthy individuals set up founda-
tions to distribute money to nonprofit causes. Foundations hire program
managers, often called grantmakers, to write and solicit grant proposals
from potential recipients of foundation money and, after money is granted,
to supervise the spending of that money to ensure it isn’t squandered.
Foundation Center: foundationcenter.org/grantmakers. Joel Orosz’s
book: The Insider’s Guide to Grantmaking.
(Neat Niche) Healthcare Administrator. What’s a healthcare system to
do? Technology is advancing, healthcare laws are changing, HMOs are
squeezing, population is aging, hospitals are closing, stand-alone clinics
are opening, home healthcare is burgeoning, regulations are increasing,
and nationalizing the healthcare system looms. The answer: Hire more
administrators to make sense of the madness. A typical challenge: An
emergency room administrator tries to balance the budget in the face of
increasing nonpaying patients and ever-more parsimonious insurers.

(Neat Niche) Human Resources Manager. HR managers usually wear one
of three hats. You can be a hiring specialist, for example, trying to recruit
those tough-to-find scientists. You can be a benefits expert, for example,
helping employees best use their benefits. Finally, you can be an organiza-
tional developer. In that role, you may develop programs to prevent com-
munication problems, workplace violence, drugs, or racial enmity, and
serve as mediator when problems arise. An ever-larger part of an HR man-
ager’s work deals with issues of race, gender, and disabilities. Alas, diver-
sity training sessions often devolve into angry affairs, and lawsuits and
other legal hassles are taking up ever-more of the job. The good news is
that organizational developers generally get to be the good guy. While
other managers’ main job is to make workers do more, better, and faster,
your job often, at least ostensibly, is to keep things human. Yes, you’re also
trying to build the bottom line, but your efforts generally have a more com-
passionate quality. About.com’s human resources portal: humanresources.

Recruiter profile in the earlier section “Bringing people together.”)
(Neat Niche) Construction Manager. Imagine being able to look at an
office building, arena, freeway cloverleaf, school, or biotech lab, and say, “I
directed the construction of that.” Construction managers have the chal-
lenging job of helping owners clarify their desires, bidding the job, hiring
subcontractors, planning the project’s timeline, directing the project’s exe-
cution, and coming up with solutions to the myriad problems that occur.
Increasingly, a bachelor’s degree in construction management is important
because the jobs are getting ever-more complex and computer-centric.
Downside: You’re on-call 24/7 to deal with delays, weather, and job-site
emergencies. But demand is strong, pay is good, and you get to see the
fruits of your labors for the rest of your life. Construction Management
Association of America: www.cmaanet.org.
School Administrator. You wouldn’t think that turnover is high among
school principals. It’s a prestigious job with an important mission. Yet turnover
is high, and here’s why: Principals report that it typically takes two years of
time-consuming, highly stressful, union-scrutinized effort to have even a
chance of getting rid of an incompetent teacher. Thus, most principals feel
forced to look the other way, and instead, take the flak from complaining par-
ents and students. Another source of principals’ stress is that they often must
take on more tasks than in the past. For example, they may be charged with
establishing school-based drug, alcohol, and violence prevention programs.
Your supervisees, teachers, have ever-tougher jobs, with more limited-English-
proficient immigrant students, and orders from on-high requiring teachers to
serve ever-more severely learning-disabled and emotionally disturbed stu-
dents in the regular classroom. And not just serve them, but achieve the new
mantra, “No child left behind: All students can learn to high standards.”
Principals must manage to keep teacher morale high under these trying cir-
cumstances. Yet another demoralizer is salary. The strong teachers’ unions
have gotten solid salary increases for teachers but administrators’ salaries
78
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

haven’t kept pace. The result is that teacher salaries often approach those of
the principals.
The silver lining in all this is that the job market for aspiring principals has
never been better. And a principalship is a launchpad for often more-reward-
ing jobs as a district or county school administrator. American Association of
School Administrators: www.aasa.org. Ronald Thorpe’s book: The First Year
as Principal: Real World Stories from America’s Principals.
(Neat Niche) Private School Founder. The public schools, especially in
mixed-socioeconomic areas, are increasingly prioritizing the needs of low-
achieving children over those of other children. Many parents of average
and high achievers are becoming convinced that these schools are inhibit-
ing their children from achieving their potential. Even liberal parents com-
mitted to the concept of public education are sending their children to
private schools lest they sacrifice their children in the name of a political
philosophy. Even the nation’s leading public school cheerleaders, the
Clintons, wouldn’t send their child to public schools.
If you’re willing to take on the challenge of starting and running a private
school, you may well find strong demand. Your school needn’t be expen-
sive. Many parents don’t care much about fancy facilities — better good
teachers in wooden buildings than wooden teachers in good buildings. I
know of a school that operates in a large tent, yet there’s a waiting list for
admission. Parents care that their schools have good teachers, good kids,
and a fascinating curriculum. Provide those and you’ll always have a wait-
ing list, and you may even change the lives of children in ways that few
other people do. Donald Leisey’s book: The Educational Entrepreneur: Making
a Difference. National Association of Independent Schools: www.nais.org.
Labor Relations Specialist. Whether employed by a union or by manage-
ment, most of your work is done before you ever sit down at the negotiating
table. Through the year, your job is to learn the needs of labor and manage-
ment and to resolve disputes as they arise. If you’re employed by a union,
you may also try to unionize workplaces. Come contract time, the bulk of
your work is still away from the negotiating table. At that point, your main
job is to do the research needed to bolster your side’s position. And then, of
course, during negotiations, you get to play hardball, poker, or win-win.

Political Campaign Manager. Everyone who runs for office, from school
board member in Lost Gulch to president of the United States, needs a cam-
paign manager. The campaign manager researches the opinions and voting
patterns in the jurisdiction; helps develop the candidate’s themes; plans
fundraisers; coordinates the Web site, e-mail, and snail mail attack; hires staff;
trains phone bank workers; coordinates the door-to-door campaign; excites
the media with a nonstop barrage of “news”; coordinates damage control;
and even helps design the campaign button. It’s an exciting job: You’re in

charge of a winner-take-all contest that can make a difference in society. Start
out by volunteering to assist in running the campaign for a local politician.
Information: www.completecampaigns.com. Catherine Shaw’s book: The
Campaign Manager, Third Edition.
In the crazy U.S. system, leaders get elected largely on who presses the most
flesh, buys the best database of undecided voters, makes the speech with the
most focus-group-approved soundbites, and more important, extracts the
most dollars from special interest groups. If I had my way, elections would 
be just two weeks long and funded completely with a modest amount of tax
dollars. Each registered voter would receive an e-mail or booklet with each
candidate’s voting record and personal statement. During those two weeks,
the candidate could use the tax dollars to campaign as he or she saw fit and
would be required to participate in at least one televised debate in which
candidates could not dictate the terms. That’s it. Substance, not fluff, and
much less chance of politicians landing in the hip pockets of special interest
groups. Perhaps more important, because of the brief, honorable campaign,
outstanding candidates, daunted or disgusted by what it currently takes to
get elected, would be more likely to come forward.
Administrative Assistant/Secretary. Many of my clients crave being the
right-hand person — and this career affords that opportunity. Ignore Hollywood
portrayals of the overworked, abused secretary; this can be a fine career.
Trusted administrative assistants may have quite a varied workday: draft a
letter, appease a client, conduct research on the Internet, plan a luncheon,
create a PowerPoint presentation, organize the boss’s file system, prepare a
spreadsheet, screen mail and calls, and enjoy a close (sometimes, very close)
relationship with the boss. And unlike the boss, admins are usually out the
door at 5:00, with little or no work to take home. And increasingly, bosses
allow their admins to work at home at least one day a week. International

Succession Planning Consultant. A tough time for family businesses is
when one generation realizes that it must allow the next generation to take

Fee-only Financial Planner. This is an especially good field for the older
career-seeker. Most people with money are older and tend to trust people
their own age. Especially as Boomers age and worry about how in the world
they’re going to save the zillion dollars the experts say they’ll need for retire-
ment, the need for financial planners is accelerating. Social Security is unlikely
to help. A survey found that more 20-somethings believe in UFOs than believe
they’ll ever see a penny of Social Security. And with an ever-wider range of
investment and insurance options, many confused people want help.

The good financial planner is as much a financial therapist as number cruncher
or mutual fund picker. Unfortunately, the traditional financial planner has a
conflict of interest: She makes more money if you buy high-commission invest-
ments and insurance, and makes even more if you buy and sell often. Enter
the fee-only financial planner. These professionals get paid a flat fee, so their
only motivation is to please the client. How to get clients? Develop relation-
ships with estate-planning attorneys and accountants, and make presentations
at employee workplaces. Some say that the best financial planner training is
the one you get if a brokerage house hires you. Others recommend the two-

Debt Collection Specialist. If you don’t mind representing a business
against a debtor, this is a good career. It’s one-on-one problem solving — the
sort of work many people like. And if the debtor can’t pay, the world doesn’t
end. There’s always another debtor to call on. That’s the key to success in
this business — staying pleasant and solution-oriented. It’s a great home
business. You can sit at home in your comfies with your feet up, with no over-
head, and earn 25 percent to 50 percent of every dollar you retrieve for your
client businesses. And there are plenty of dollars to retrieve. Consumer debt
is two trillion dollars. The Association of Credit and Collections Professionals:

ment. You get clients by cold-calling businesses, or from bankers or collec-
tion agencies. Check to be sure that it’s legal in your state to represent
debtors in this way.
Business Broker. As small-business-owning Boomers retire, they’ll be

Corporate Intelligence Officer. An article in Working Woman reassures you,
“No need for a cloak or dagger. Corporate intelligence staffers comb through
perfectly legitimate sources of information — newspapers, competitors’ sales
materials, speeches, credit reports, databases, and interviews — for the goods
on competitors. You really have to be good at getting information, which means
getting people to trust you.” Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals:

Military Officer. This job title is a catchall for hundreds of occupations,
from manager to doctor, accountant to engineer. A military career offers
many pluses: fine free training, extensive benefits, and esprit de corps
unmatched in most civilian jobs. Of course, you have to accept a life of uni-
forms, the bureaucracy to end all bureaucracies, and transfers to places
you’d otherwise never choose. (The Middle East, anyone?) And, oh yes, you
can get your head blown off. Among the many routes in are ROTC, enlist-
ment, Officers Candidate Schools, and the prestigious service academies,
such as West Point (Army), the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, and
the Coast Guard Academy. Those schools offer small classes taught by
unusually dedicated instructors. When I visited the Air Force Academy, the
cadets were more enthusiastic about their college experience than students

Work with People and Words
Public speaking
Radio/TV News Reporter. This is one of those long-shot glamour profes-
sions that may be worth the risk. You get to investigate fast-breaking stories,
sometimes in dangerous environments, and report your findings live. Even in
non-emergency situations, you usually have just an hour or two to gather
your information before making your report. With the thousands of local
news broadcasts, you may be able to land a job, at least if you’re willing to
start out in Podunk and work nights and weekends. Musts are the ability to
write concisely and quickly, a good memory, and an authoritative on-air pres-
ence. News reporting is a launchpad for a news anchor position, which, in
addition to offering fame, pays awfully well for a job that mainly consists of
reading aloud. Center for Investigative Reporting: www.muckraker.org.

Sports Announcer. Sports continues to be a passion for millions of
Americans. That’s good news and bad news. The good news is there’s plenty
of demand for sports announcers: on radio and TV, before the game, during
the game (play-by-play and color), and after the game. The bad news is that
half the sports fans would give their eyeteeth to make a living as a sports
broadcaster. Who does make a living at it? People with the ability to analyze
what’s going on beneath the surface and who are a goldmine of interesting
trivia to fill the large spaces of time in which nothing’s going on in the game.
Pluses are a commanding voice, a quick wit, being a well-known former athlete,
and a degree from a top broadcast journalism program, such as Northwestern,
Syracuse, or Missouri. Even then, your first job is likely to sound like this:

Talk Show Host. I excluded this career from this book’s first edition because
the odds of making a living at it are small. But so many people see it as their
dream career or as a marketing tool for their business that I decided to include
it and simply tell you how to maximize your chances of defying the odds.
Start by thinking about what your unique style would be. Are you a particu-
larly tough interviewer? Someone from the political far right or far left? Some-
one with encyclopedic knowledge and a palpable passion about something?
An unusually self-revealing person? You’ll probably increase your chances of
success by incorporating your unusual characteristics into your talk show.
For me, it’s that I have the ability to answer practical questions quickly. So
my show is heavily call-in and about a practical topic: work. I also like doing
interviews in which I don’t just ask the questions, I also participate in a con-
versation/debate — I often contribute almost as much content as the guest
does. I’m also constitutionally fast. I talk fast; I interrupt. Rather than homog-
enizing myself into being just another mid-speed-talking host, I allow myself
to be my regular, fast self. Finally, I’m willing to be very honest on the air. So, I
do issue tough love and say politically incorrect things.
So, what are your unique attributes and interests? Make those the centerpiece
of your radio persona and structure for your talk show. Practice interviewing
people and taking call-ins using that style. Do it at home and record the inter-
views. Critique yourself. Have friends and family critique you mericilessly.
When you record an interview you’re proud of, edit it down to the best three
to five minutes of excerpts and hand-deliver it to the program director of
appropriate local radio and TV stations. Any station that won’t let you see
the program director gets a mailed copy and a follow-up phone call two days
later. That’s how I got to host my first talk show, and now I’m in my 18th year
as producer and host of Work with Marty Nemko on a National Public Radio
affiliate in San Francisco. Even if you can’t make a living as a talk show host,
you can get yourself on the air. Build up your chops on a local cable access
TV station, by buying airtime on a station, or by webcasting or podcasting
your show. Talker’s Magazine: www.talkers.com. Podcasting resource: www.

Professional Speaker. This is another fantasy career with reasonable
prospects. Despite the plethora of electronic alternatives, people still want to
hear live speakers. Quite a few people, including some no-names, make a
living spreading their gospel at conventions, college campuses, corporate
headquarters, and general public forums. Even cruise ships have added
speakers to their menu of entertainment. Find an in-demand topic on which
you are or could become an expert. Then read books such as Dottie Walters’s
Speak and Grow Rich, study DVDs of great speakers, craft a solid outline of
your speech, build in something experiential so they’re not just listening to a
talking head, and practice, practice, practice until you’re able to convey
something of real substance while making a powerful connection with your
audience. Consider joining a local chapter of Toastmasters, where you learn
public speaking principles and get to give talks to fellow members, a sympa-
thetic audience. When you have a knock-your-socks-off sample DVD, send it
to conference program chairs and lecture bureaus. The latter can help market
you. National Speakers Association: www.nsaspeaker.org. Toastmasters

(Neat Niche) Speaking Coach. Most people are called on to “say a few
words,” whether at a staff meeting, a professional conference, a venture
capitalist pitch session, or a toast at their child’s wedding. If you’re a good
public speaker, why not teach others what you’ve learned? Acquire clients
by giving talks on how to give a speech at conferences or at local compa-
nies. Don’t forget about law firms — many attorneys earn their living as
smooth talkers. Enter google “speaking coach.”
Training and teaching
Employee Trainer. The need for training has never been greater. More stu-
dents graduate from high school and even college without basic skills at the
same time today’s workplace requires them to be communication whizzes
and technomavens. Even those who graduated from college with enough skills
soon find they need to upgrade. Older workers feel they must stay up-to-the-
minute lest they be permanently put out to pasture. Trainers are needed in 
so many areas: from basic reading to advanced Oracle, peak performance to
retirement planning, database management to diversity management. A cur-
rent challenge for trainers is how to help American workers adapt to global-
ization. Online training will grow more popular as people, ever-busier, would
rather watch their training from a computer, when they feel like it, than to
show up in a seminar room at a specified time. And the quality of online train-
ing is getting better thanks to improved conferencing software and wider use
of full-motion video. American Society for Training and Development:

(Neat Niche) Software Trainer. New software and new versions of old soft-
ware continue to be released. Heaven forbid you should be saddled with
84
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

Version 7.0 when Version 8.0 is available. As a trainer, it’s a plus if you’re
certified by the software’s manufacturer. Trainers are hired by large orga-
nizations, training schools, community colleges, and adult schools. Linda
Johnson’s e-book, How to Get Started as a Software Trainer: dreamjobstogo.
com/titles/djtg0036.html?10456.
(Neat Niche) Dream-Career Trainer. Train clients for those difficult-to-get-
into fields to which many people aspire: rock star, talk show host, athlete,
comedian, artist, screen writer, voiceover artist, film director, or Web site
developer, for example. The trainers usually end up making more money
than the dream-career aspirants.
Health Educator. HMOs know that an ounce of prevention is not only
better than a pound of cure, but it also costs less. HMOs’ ounce of prevention
is to hire health educators to teach people such things as how to lose weight,
fit exercise into a busy day, or lower their cholesterol (as though people
don’t know that broccoli is good and cheeseburgers are bad). Nonetheless, a
job conducting health seminars is, as jobs go, pretty salubrious. American
College of Healthcare Executives: www.ache.org.
Teacher. On its face, teaching would seem like a wonderful career. The work-
day and work year are short, benefits are tops, job security is unsurpassed,
and average pay has risen above $60,000 in many metropolitan areas. So why
would one-third of all new teachers leave the profession within five years?
Here’s how the Princeton Review Web site describes teaching: “Usually begin-
ning at 8 a.m., teachers must begin the difficult task of generating interest in
their often sleepy students. A good sense of humor and the ability to think
like their students helps.” Don’t get seduced by 3 p.m. dismissal bells and
summers off. Especially in gritty urban schools, where the most hiring is
occurring, teaching today is no cushy gig. Schools now put everyone from
the mentally challenged to the mentally gifted in the same class. It takes
exceptional talent and long hours to develop no-snooze lessons for that wide
a range of students, often including immigrants who may speak Spanish,
Chinese, or Tagalog, but little English. Teachers also have far less power to
remove children who chronically disrupt the class — and it takes only one.
Students with severe behavior problems used to be placed in special classes.
Now, except in the most extreme cases, they’re mainstreamed. And new
teachers, despite having the least experience, are often given the toughest
classes. Now add the many hours after school preparing interesting yet valu-
able lessons for that wide range of students, correcting papers, the pressures
of high-stakes No-Child-Left-Behind testing, and dealing with parents who
complain that Johnny’s individual needs aren’t being met. Finally, remember
that teachers are with kids all day, so they don’t get much intellectual stimu-
lation. You need a special mentality to do that.
I paint this stark picture because I believe that teaching is among the more
important professions. That’s the main reason it’s on the list of cool careers.
Because most public school teachers, after just two years, receive tenure for
life, a bad teacher, saddled by the golden handcuffs of job security, can be
85
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

tempted to stay in the profession forever, damaging 30 kids at a time, year in
and year out. So I want to encourage teachers to enter the profession with
full knowledge of its realities. Too often, people decide to become teachers
based on their own years as a student or on a rewarding experience as a one-
to-one tutor. The experience of many of today’s classroom teachers is quite
different. About.com’s elementary education portal: k-6educators.about.
com. Pearl Rock Kane’s book: The First Year of Teaching.
(Neat Niche) Retreat Leader. So many people would enjoy getting away
for an inspiring, reinvigorating, and fun weekend. On what topic could you
captivate people for a weekend? Relationships? Salesmanship? Quilting?
Parenting? Procrastination? Libertarian politics? People will often pay a
good few hundred bucks for a weekend retreat, so this could be more
lucrative than you may think. As always, the keys are good product and
good marketing. Mention it on online groups, place an ad for it on a spe-
cialty site or craigslist.org, put flyers in the right places (including
retreat centers), and of course, tell everyone you know. I personally love
retreats, so if I were looking for more to do (I’m not), I’d lead a “Find Your
Next Career” retreat. Merianne Litemen’s book: Retreats That Work.
(Neat Niche) Distance-Learning Teacher. According to a 2006 U.S. News
cover story, three million Americans are now pursuing their degrees
online. And the trend is spreading into traditional college education. For
example, at U.C. Berkeley, students can, 24/7, crank up any part of an inter-
active Intro to Chemistry course from their dorm room. And rural high
schools are now able to offer a wide array of courses even if no local
teacher is available to teach them. It takes special skills to teach via dis-
tance learning, so if you can make that your specialty, you should be in
demand, especially now that — thanks to high-speed connections — full-
motion video can be incorporated into online classes. Distance Education
Clearinghouse: www.uwex.edu/disted. S. Joseph Levine’s book: Making
Distance Education Work.
(Neat Niche) English-Language-Learners Teacher. Immigration continues
to jump, and so does the need for teachers of English as a second language.
They are hired by K-12 schools, community colleges, adult schools, and by
companies for their immigrant employees. This career is often gratifying
because most students are motivated to learn the subject — unlike some
other school subjects. Dave’s ESL Cafe: www.eslcafe.com. Suzanne
Peregoy’s book: Reading, Writing and Learning in ESL.
(Neat Niche) Adult Education Teacher. Here’s another niche with moti-
vated students. At a community college or school district’s adult school,
you help students get their General Education Development (GED)
diploma, and teach English-as-a-Second Language and other subjects.

(Neat Niche) Program Specialist. Elementary schools often use specialists
to visit classrooms to teach art, music, technology, or special ed. This
86
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

tends to be a rewarding job because you’re the breath of fresh air in a stu-
dent’s humdrum day, and because you’re able to focus on your specialty.
(Neat Niche) Music or Art Teacher. After years of decline, schools are
starting to hire more music and art teachers. National Association for Music
Education: www.menc.org. Links: www.artmuseums.com.
Something’s wrong when the National Endowment for the Arts gives millions
of dollars to a relative handful of artists who produce work that much of the
public finds unappealing or even disgusting, while millions of schoolchildren
receive little or no art instruction, something that can so enrich the lives
even of non-artistic kids.
(Neat Niche) Vocational/Technical Teacher. Community colleges and post-
secondary career colleges, and some high schools, hire teachers in fields
such as technology repair, business education, agriculture, plumbing, and
protective services. Links: dragon.ep.usm.edu/~yuen/votech.htm.
Athletic Coach. I coached an Oakland (CA) Boys Club basketball team. I
went in with visions of using hoops to help kids triumph over their life cir-
cumstances, but that proved overly ambitious. Just getting them to pay atten-
tion took everything I had. It was fun though, and the games were a rush,
constantly figuring out what to do to give your team an edge while trying to
be a good role model.
The usual starting job is a high school coaching position, but you only start to
earn a decent income at the college level. There, you have additional respon-
sibilities, such as meeting with the media and big-time donors. And you must
make recruiting trips to convince high school athletes that even though they
have a C average at a low-rigor high school, they can succeed in college classes.
Because of Title IX regulations, the number of female sports teams is increas-
ing, so job opportunities are good for women and not so good for men. If I
were trying to break in, I’d write a letter to every top college coach in my
field and see whether I could get any sort of assistant job working for him or
her. Comprehensive Online Access to Coaching Help: www.coachhelp.com.
Jim Thompson’s book: The Double-Goal Coach.
Clergy. A clergyperson told me that the thing I thought was most important
in a cleric turns out not to be a requirement at all: She said that many clergy
have serious doubts about the existence of God. They are, however, strongly
committed to helping people live richer lives using religion as a foundation.
Sometimes this help is direct: sermons, religion classes, and ministering to
people at high and low points of their lives — birth, marriage, crisis, and
death — but clergypersons also spend a surprising amount of time in indirect
service, such as fundraising and administrative work. Except for the long hours
and having to be on-call at all hours, the clergy is a rewarding profession with
high status, unmitigated do-gooding, and a good job market except for Protes-
tant ministers (because their churches are merging). The situation is better
for rabbis and cantors (they lead singing during services) and excellent for

Catholic priests — lifetime celibacy is increasingly unpopular, and their repu-
tation as abusers of boys doesn’t help. Indeed, the Catholic Church has run
full-page ads attempting to “collar” future priests. The job market is especially
good for aspiring priests who speak Spanish. After checking out the resources
here, investigate a career in the clergy by speaking with a clergyperson you
respect, and then contacting the ordination organization for your denomina-
tion. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clergy. Oye Magazine:

sions. Information: www.celebrantusa.com.
On the creative side
Actor. Like many creative pursuits, acting is one of the world’s best hobbies
and worst careers. Expressing creativity is a primal need — so primal, in fact,
that the competition even for volunteer work in the creative arts is intense.
Last year, for example, I auditioned for a part in a community theater produc-
tion of Death of a Salesman. Nobody would get paid a dime, yet more than
100 actors, many with degrees in acting and extensive stage experience, tried
out. (I wasn’t even invited to the callbacks, let alone offered a role.)
The good news is that the job market may be improving a bit. With the pro-
liferation of Internet video for commercials, training, and entertainment,
increased cable viewership, and more foreign demand for American produc-
tions, the need for actors is increasing. But there’s plenty of bad news. For
example, 80 percent of actors in the Screen Actors Guild (those who have
already acted in a union job) earn less than $5,000 a year from their acting!
Even the term actor is misleading. It implies you’re acting, doing something.
For the most part, actors wait. They wait to be hired. After they’re hired, on
the set, they wait for their turn; for the weather to clear; for the tech people
to set things up; for the producer, director, and minions to make up their minds.
Casting Director Lisa Pirriolli, in the book Gig, adds, “It’s a horrible life . . . it’s
all about getting the job and about rejection. If you do get the job, it’s all about
doing it correctly and getting the next one, and the next one, just trying to
become famous. And if you do become famous, it’s all about being famous.
And then it’s about when your star is going to fall.”
Okay. Despite it all, you decide to try to make a living as an actor. Here are some
keys to making it: First choose a niche. Are you the insecure villain type? A
singing airhead? Be sure your headshot, sample reel, and resume capture
your niche, and send the package to local acting agencies. It may be smarter
to start in a large city other than Los Angeles or New York, perhaps Toronto
88
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

(“Hollywood North”) or Wilmington, North Carolina (“Hollywood East”). To
get leads on gigs, contact each city’s film commission. Or start out in industri-
als — training and promotional videos. It’s much easier to obtain credits and
develop a sample reel. To avoid starving in the meantime, rather than or in
addition to waiting tables, consider interim jobs that help polish your craft:
mock trial participant, mock patient (used in medical school training), role-
player in employee training seminars or police crisis simulations, traffic
school instructor, and Santa Claus. (Don’t let your little kid read that.) Robert
Cohen’s book: Acting Professionally.
Musician. Nothing inspires or heals like music. It can lift a depression, tame
an angry soul, move one to gyrate with joy — even if you’re alone in your
kitchen. How terrific to have a career in which music is your main activity.
But how do you fight the odds against making a living at it? First, you gotta
find out if you really have enough talent. Don’t count on your teachers to be
candid. They have too much vested interest in encouraging you. Besides, it’s
hard for someone who knows you to tell you that you’re probably not good
enough. How do you discover the truth about your talent? Play for (or send a
recording to) people who don’t know you but are in a position to pay you for
your work: orchestra conductors, studio gig contractors, wedding band lead-
ers, nightclub owners, and so on. If you audition 20 times and receive little
encouragement, cut your losses. Make music your after-work passion. For
example, join a community orchestra. If you get sincere encouragement but
not a full-time paying gig, you may have to be entrepreneurial to make a
middle-class living. Find great musicians to join your musical group. Then
seriously market it. For example, convince local government or corporate
leaders to hire you to play at their events, play host to a party for wedding
planners, or invite event planners via direct mail to visit your Web site, which
contains audio clips of your music. Sheila Anderson’s book: How to Grow as a
Musician. Classical Music directory: www.musicalonline.com.
(Neat Niche) Background Vocalist. Ooh, wah. Ooh, wah. Yeah, yeah. No,
this isn’t the sound of sex. It’s the sound of a background singer. This is an
under-the-radar, sometimes well-paying career for talented singers who
can walk in, read the music, and crank out those “yeahs” and “oohs” so
they give you goose bumps. Don’t think you can do this job if you’re a
second-rate singer. Unless the lead singer is a Norah Jones, background
singers are often better singers.
Composer. Increasingly, soundtracks, especially for computer games, are
created as much by computer cut-and-pasters as by musical wizards. Instead
of standing in the orchestra pit, this conductor sits at a computer with a library
of sounds, special effects, and music clips, and creates the mood of a computer
game, commercial, or film trailer. Of course, traditional songwriters are still
out there, but the job market is molto largo (very slow). American Society of
Composers, Authors, and Publishers: www.ascap.com. Article: mixonline.com/

Getting political
Politician. Yes, they always have to have their hands out, and their reputa-
tion isn’t sparkling, but most politicians I’ve met try to be fine leaders. And
although the wheels of government turn slowly and inefficiently, at least its
goal is benevolent. No specific training is required to be a politician, although
you must be instantly likeable, a compelling speaker, and have a thick skin.
The biggest downsides are loss of privacy and job instability. But if after 
a couple of losses you decide to switch careers, the connections you’ve 
made will likely help you land a job. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/politician. William Endicott’s book: An Insider’s Guide to Political
Jobs in Washington, DC. Richard Benedetto’s book: Politicians are People, Too.
Political Aide. Most politicians have paid aides. They research problems,
draft legislation, and sub for the pol at rubber chicken dinners. This is a satis-
fying job. You actually have some power, and the work is varied and fast-paced.
The usual route in is to start as an intern or campaign volunteer. Ask for more
responsibility, and prove yourself. Vault.com profile: www.vault.com/nr/
occ_profiles.jsp?product_id=524&p=1&ht_type=11.
Lobbyist. You’re a lobbyist for the National Abortion Rights League. A law
you want to pass would solidify teens’ right to have an abortion without
parental permission. You may actually have drafted the legislation, and you
certainly dug up research that proves its benefits; for example, the legislation
would result in fewer teen moms and avoid unsafe abortions. You play host
to a cocktail party for key legislators and just enough other folks to make
your goal less obvious. You write press releases and try to get on TV and
radio or into the blogosphere to expound your position. That’s the life of a
lobbyist, a professional persuader of politicians. A law degree is a plus, but
not essential. Lobbyist jobs are similar to the sought-after positions working
for a legislator but may be easier to land. American League of Lobbyists: www.
alldc.org. Anthony Nownes’s book: Total Lobbying.
If political campaigns were publicly funded, legislators would listen more to the
public than to lobbyists who throw big bucks at politicians to gain influence.
One-on-one
Speech-Language Therapist. Think of how you feel when you listen to
someone who stutters. Imagine how he feels. The speech-language therapist
treats stuttering and other voice and speaking problems, from cleft palate to
limited vocabulary to stroke victims trying to recover their speech. For many
patients, progress is slow. Patience is a must. Speech therapists who work in
schools have relatively short workdays, with ample time off. They may also
work in hospitals, clinics, and in private practice. Many speech therapists

(Neat Niche) Accent Neutralization Specialist. When you call tech support,
it’s reassuring to hear someone whose accent you can understand. To that
end, companies hire accent reduction specialists. Too, many immigrants
to the United States, especially those in professional jobs, are eager to
improve their accents. In either case, to find clients, contact human resource
departments at high-tech corporations. They often recruit from abroad to
fill programmer, engineer, and scientist positions. Articles: healthcare.

College Admission Counselor. “Which college should I go to?” “How do I
get in?” “How do I find the money?” In high schools, college counselors typi-
cally help students answer these questions with individual counseling and
group presentations. In private practice, the work is one-on-one. As usual,
specializing is wise. You can specialize, for example, in students with learning
problems or those aiming for designer-label colleges. National Association for
College Admission Counseling: www.nacacnet.org. Independent Educational

(Neat Niche) College-Bound Athlete Consultant. Many high school stu-
dents are pulled kicking and screaming into doing their college applica-
tions. Not so with college athletes. They may not care any more than their
peers about the joys of learning, but they do care about playing ball. These
motivated clients make your job fun. You help Bruiser figure out which 
colleges will let him play a lot and satisfy him academically and socially.

Troubled Teen Consultant. Few things are more frustrating to parents than
an out-of-control teen: School and parents are ignored, and sex, drugs, and
rock-and-roll are extolled. What’s a parent to do? They increasingly hire con-
sultants to find after-school programs, tough-love camps, and therapeutic
boarding schools to help Junior — or at least to get the troubled teen out of
Mom and Dad’s frazzled hair. Independent Educational Consultants Association:

Tutor. Many tutors love their jobs. They gush about the close one-on-one
relationships, the visible progress, and the fact that you can earn money with
minimal startup costs and without endless training. How do you make a
decent living as a tutor? Let local public school teachers know that, unlike
chains such as Sylvan Learning, you make house calls. It also helps if you
carve out a niche, working with, for example, students with attention deficit
disorder, or math for girls. I often give just one word of advice to people with

keter who got plenty of clients just by standing in front of a computer
store and giving his pitch to everyone walking out with a new computer.
He often made an appointment on the spot. Google “computer tutoring.”
(Neat Niche) SAT/ACT Tutor. Because students (or at least their parents)
are motivated, this type of tutoring can be pleasurable. And done right, SAT/
ACT tutoring not only prepares the student for the test, but can also pro-
vide skills that can last a lifetime. In studying for the SAT, I learned hundreds
of important words. I mean, can one survive without knowing sanctimo-
nious, hubristic, and bloviating? After all, how else could I accurately describe
what I’m sounding like here? I know: blowhard. Google “SAT tutoring.”
Home Schooling Consultant. As disenchantment with public schooling
rises, and the media reports the high SAT scores and top college admission
rates of home-schooled kids, it isn’t surprising that two million children are
now home-schooled. But home schooling is no easy feat. As a consultant, 
you help parents and kids design learning programs and iron out problems.

Work with People and Things
Polygraph Operator. Would you find it fun figuring out whether people are
lying? That’s what polygraph (lie detector) operators do. Hook up your sub-
ject to a machine that monitors heart rate and brain waves. If things start
spiking when you ask, “Did you murder your husband?” your subject may be
a step closer to Ol’ Sparky. Most polygraph operators work for law enforce-
ment agencies, but polygraph tests also are used by attorneys to prove that
their clients are upstanding citizens, and in pre-employment testing in sensi-
tive industries such as day-care centers. You don’t want a pedophile caring
for your child. American Polygraph Association: www.polygraph.org.
Funeral Director. Many people cringe at this profession, but funeral direc-
tors are proud of their work. When a death occurs, a funeral director who
helps family members make arrangements that feel right can be a real benefit
in a time of need. Alas, too many funeral directors take that opportunity to
push $5,000 caskets when a $500 one would do: “You wouldn’t want to be
cheap with your mother, now would you?” Training is moderate in length, pay
is substantial, and demand is growing thanks to the aging U.S. population and
because many funeral directors are about to retire. Not a bad combination.

Do me a favor, though. Be sure to spend some time at a funeral home — other
than when Granny Fern’s lying in state — before deciding on this career. Despite
projected fast growth in this field, landing a job isn’t easy. Because the career
is desirable, many people keep this business in the family. It may take a while
to convince an employer that you’re, pardon the expression, dying for the job.

Occupational Therapist. You help a stroke patient relearn how to drive.
You find an alternative for an arthritis patient who can no longer button a
shirt. Using a combination of psychology, computers, braces, and a healthy
dose of common sense, the occupational therapist is the practical soul 
who tries to put it all together. The Department of Labor projects fast

Electro-Neurodiagnostic Technician (formerly EEG Technician). END
techs monitor brain waves. Why would you want to do that? In surgery, brain
waves indicate how well the anesthesia is working. In a sleep clinic, brain
waves help figure out what’s causing a person’s insomnia. Doctors use them
to determine how well a medication is helping an epileptic. This is a cool
career because, despite its important healthcare role, it can be learned on the
job or with a short training program, and employment prospects are good.

Diagnostic Medical Sonographer. Commonly known as ultrasound tech-
nologists, you perform sonograms to, for example, noninvasively diagnose a
heart problem or to determine how a pregnant mom and baby are doing.

Low-Investment Food Operations Owner. Simple, no-seating food opera-
tions can be relatively low-risk routes to high income.
(Neat Niche) Pizza-by-the-Slice Business Owner. Pizza never goes out of
style, has a large markup, and is a relatively simple business. One secret to
success is to open your shop within smelling distance of a busy walk-in
entrance to a college campus. Remember, the pizza has to be to-die-for.
Find an ever-crowded pizzeria that serves delicious pizza and is located
far enough from your proposed location that the owner won’t fear your
competition. Ask the head pizza maker to teach you how to make it. If nec-
essary, pay for your lessons. Google “pizza by the slice.”
(Neat Niche) Food Carts. The most important thing about a food outlet is
location. Subject to zoning restrictions, carts enable you to move around so
you can be in front of a busy office building at lunch time, at the main exit
of the local high school during the afternoon, in front of a busy movie the-
ater in the evening, and near the stadium on game days. Carts not only make
good locations possible, they also keep rent low — an unbeatable combi-
nation. Good candidates for cart-based businesses: sandwiches, burritos,
93

soup, espresso, and pastries. Espresso is my favorite cart business, not
only because Americans consume 400 million cups of coffee a day, but also
because the profit margin is so high — that $3 latte costs 10 cents to make.
That sort of margin would impress even Joey the Loan Shark.
As with all businesses, there are things to watch out for. For example, if the
landlord sees you getting rich just by pouring coffee, he can toss you and
install his intellectually challenged cousin. So, after you prove to yourself
that you can make one profitable, on subsequent carts, get a long lease.
Worried about status? Remember, you’re not selling coffee; you’re presi-
dent of the Continental Cappuccino Company with stores throughout the
region. Links: www.espressotop50.com.
Parking Lot Oil Change Business Operator. Every car needs oil changes,
and nearly every car owner finds getting them inconvenient. At best, you sit
around at a while-you-wait oil-change service. Otherwise, it’s drop off the car,
somehow get to work, and somehow get back to the shop. Instead, imagine
that when you pull into a parking lot at work, a shopping center, or the air-
port, you can request an oil change while your car is parked. Isn’t that more
convenient? What a business: big demand, large income potential, small
investment, no extraordinary skills required, and little legitimate competi-
tion. The Automotive Oil Change Association: www.aoca.org.
Work with Data and People
Technically speaking
Technical Support Specialist. I love these people. When I can’t get my
software to work, or worse, when I get an error message such as, “General
Failure, Drive C,” I reach for the phone and get a tech support person, who
almost always straightens me out. Tech support can be a launchpad to other
high-tech careers because you get to understand products and their warts
from the customers’ perspective. Standout tech support people graduate not
only to supervisor but also to sales, marketing, and even product development
positions. But you may first have to pay your dues. Unless your employer has
outsourced after-hours tech support to India, newbie help-deskers may have
to work the graveyard shift. “Help, I’m on the phone with Beijing and my Treo
won’t sync!” Also, you need the patience of a saint — people are often frantic
when they call (or at least I am). Help Desk Institute: www.helpdeskinst.com.

Software Designer/Architect. This is what you can do when you’ve been a
programmer for a while and you’re ready for a less coding-intensive job. As 
a software designer, you talk with your bosses, customers, and other stake-
holders, figuring out what they want the software to do. Then, you design its
architecture and supervise programmers who produce the actual software.

Web Developer/Webmaster. Countless organizations and individuals want to
build or upgrade their sites. Web developers start by trying to understand the
client’s needs and then create a site using an ever-cooler software toolkit. Sure,
demand for developers is declining as create-your-own-site software is getting
ever easier and more powerful. For example, see the sitebuilder at homestead.
com or Website Tonight at godaddy.com. But demand for human site builders
who can create sophisticated sites that are search-engine optimized will con-
tinue. Jobs will also be available for people who can maintain and troubleshoot
sites. Site development is a fascinating career because it offers a combination
of creativity, art, and business. International Webmasters Association: www.

Database Administrator. Among an e-commerce site’s greatest treasures
are its databases. Databases, for example, enable customers to see whether a
product is in stock, and provides the site owner with its customers’ prefer-
ences so it can custom-market. So, no surprise, companies need database
administrators, especially those with expertise in Oracle/SQL. The U.S.

can three different computer systems talk with each other? The systems ana-
lyst, working with programmers and managers, develops the blueprint for
system-wide solutions to problems like these. You may not be a hard-core
programmer, but you need some skills in programming, networking hardware,
software, and data modeling to do what-if projections. Another key skill is the
ability to translate between geek-speak and plain English. The more senior

Operations Research Analyst. One way the U.S. manages to stay competi-
tive in this global economy is its ability to create efficient production sys-
tems. The operations research analyst, a practically oriented math whiz, is
one of the brains behind it all. He may, for example, help the Green Giant
figure out how much corn to plant and when to plant it. He may shorten the

Purchasing Specialist/Supply Chain Manager/Logistics Manager.
How’d you like to get paid for shopping? Well, it’s not quite like at the mall.
Purchasing specialists do the shopping for companies and government agen-
cies. Of course, it doesn’t hurt to have a good instinct for when it is and isn’t
worth going after a bargain, but this job has rapidly gone technological. Supply-
chain software helps ensure that you get what you need when you need it
instead of the old way, which meant lots of costly inventory doing nothing in
a warehouse. Demand is great for people graduating from supply chain man-
agement programs, such as the ones at Arizona State or Michigan State Uni-
versities, but any bachelor’s degree plus enthusiastic interest in purchasing
may be enough to get you in the door. About.com’s purchasing specialist portal:

Gerontologist. Unlike the geriatrics expert, who focuses on the science of

living facility develop its program, or, with a doctorate, conduct research on
how to improve the quality of people’s aging while controlling societal costs.

Crunching numbers
College Financial Aid Officer. At most colleges, more than half the stu-
dents apply for financial aid. With only so much money available, your job is
to distribute it equitably and to mollify or negotiate with students who get
less than they had hoped for — and after filling out all that paperwork, some
are unhappy. It’s a nice job because it feels good to allocate money, breathing
periods between crunch times are sizeable, you need only a bachelor’s degree,
and you get to work on a college campus — a pleasant work environment.

Accountant. Even if you’re the stereotypical accountant — a mumbling
recluse — you’ll probably find employment. The job market is terrific for
bean counters. But higher-level positions require an accountant to be a good
96
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

communicator, often imparting bad news: “No, you can’t deduct that. No, 
you calculated that incorrectly. No, that’s inadequate documentation.” That
naysayer role is one of the field’s biggest downsides. But cheer up — for good
accountants who are Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), there’s light at the
end of the green-eye-shade tunnel. Companies promote good accountants to
positions such as comptroller and chief financial officer, where they function
more like financial physicians than bean-counting bookkeepers. They’re
involved in decisions about developing and marketing new products, how to
best use existing capital and raise more, and even how to structure the com-
pany. Accountants and their closely related finance specialists are a com-
pany’s antidote to decision making based on gut feelings.
The Big Four firms (KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, and Ernst &
Young) offer terrific training, great pay, and challenging assignments. Problem
is, it’s tough to get them to hire you. If they won’t, not to worry: There are
plenty of other accounting firms, most mid-to-large-size corporations and
nonprofits use in-house accountants, and the government — and not just the
IRS — is full of them. To boot, the federal government-imposed Sarbanes-Oxley
reporting requirements are essentially a full-employment act for accountants.
In short, if you’re a halfway decent accountant, the world is your oyster. CPAs
(especially with Sarbanes-Oxley experience), experienced cost accountants,
junior-level financial and business analysts, and degreed senior accountants
are all in demand. And if you want to help people with their taxes or straighten
out small business financial messes, you can simply hang out a shingle.

(Neat Niche) Forensic Accountant. Crooks are ever-more creative. For
example, they used those cheapie, tiny USB drives to steal account infor-
mation from credit union computers. That reminds me of the person who
stole one penny from every account in a large bank, so small an amount
that no one noticed for years, until a forensic accountant did. The corpo-
rate accounting scandals of the mid-2000s, from Enron to Apple, have made
forensic accounting a hot career. It’s a cross between an accountant and a
detective. According to U.S. News, these fraud fighters are often called in by
law firms, government agencies, and corporations to sniff out such indis-
cretions as secret CEO compensation, phony insurance claims, improper
securities trading, and to testify in court. The Big Four firms alone hire hun-
dreds of forensic accountants each year, and so does the FBI. Who knows?

(Neat Niche) Healthcare Accountant. When you have an operation, its
cost depends on the answers to these questions: Are you on Medicare?
Medicaid? Do you have private insurance? Which company? Are you a low-
income patient? Are you paying your own way? (You may pay more.) Not
only is there rarely one set price, there usually isn’t just one payer — a
single surgery often gets paid for by the government, an insurance com-
pany, the patient, and sometimes after all that, the hospital eats some of
the costs. A healthcare accountant keeps track of the entire mess. Links:

(Neat Niche) Environmental Accountant. Environmentalism has become
religion, so government agencies and nonprofits are using more environ-
mental accountants to argue that the environmental damages caused by a
company outweigh the benefits. And many companies — especially utili-
ties, manufacturers, and chemical companies — hire other environmental
accountants to prove the opposite, or simply to comply with the regulations.
CPAs who also are engineers are in particularly great demand. Article:
finance.monster.com/articles/environmentalaccounting.
Environmental Management Accounting: www.emawebsite.org/
about_ema.htm.
(Neat Niche) Consulting Accountant. CPAs are often called in on a consult-
ing basis, perhaps to computerize a company’s accounting function, facili-
tate a merger or acquisition, figure out how to reduce fraud or comply
with Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, or provide advice on how to improve
operating procedures. The Big Four accounting firms do a lot of this.

(Neat Niche) Executor. Some wills name a bank or trust company as execu-

uals who are advertising estate sales. Google “professional executor.”

Investment Banker. Business’s growth hormone is money. A typical 
I-banker’s assignment is to get money on the best terms. Are you willing to
work into the wee hours and do lots of traveling to get a company the best
deal on the money? You don’t raise the dough by calling a few banks and
saying, “Hi, will you lend us some money?” Here’s how investment bankers
work: A growing private company needs more money. Should it go public?
Get private equity funding? Spin off a division? Get bought out? You do com-
plex calculations to help the company come up with an answer. Say the com-
pany decides to go public and issue stock. You attempt to price it right. Then
you hand off the project to a different kind of I-banker — the salesperson —
who attempts to convince banks, mutual fund managers, and pension fund
managers to buy your stock or bond offering. To sell requires more than a
slick tongue, but that helps.
Most I-bankers are first hired with just a bachelor’s degree (in any field, as
long as it’s from a designer-label college at which you got good grades). Your
first job is an analyst, a number cruncher. You usually need an MBA before
making the big bucks. A couple of years as an I-banking analyst is usually a
ticket to top-name MBA programs. But I’m talking full years. In her book The
Fast Track, Mariam Naficy writes, “The amount you’ll work in investment
banking cannot be overstated. One analyst reported that he bought 50 pairs
of underwear because he had no time to do laundry.”
Many people, in part thanks to movies like The Bonfire of the Vanities and
books like Liars Poker, believe that investment bankers do nothing good for
the world. In fact, their job often is to help companies raise money so that
they can bring a better product to a broader market. Even media-reviled
investment banker Michael Milken, by raising money for MCI as an invest-
ment banker, was key to making the telecommunications industry more com-
petitive, and in turn, lowering everyone’s phone bills. Before deregulation,
you were paying 40 cents per long-distance minute. Now, you pay a few pen-
nies. Thank an investment banker. The most sought-after jobs are at “bulge
bracket” firms such as Goldman Sachs, but the fastest-growing segment is
mid- to large-sized traditional banks, which are now allowed to do investment
banking. Vault.com’s investment banking hub: www.vault.com/hubs/

Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

Sales types are on the phones convincing institutional clients, such as pen-
sion fund managers, to invest in some stock or bond. Traders execute the
buy or sell on the best terms — using quantitative analysis and plenty of
guesswork. This is a career for people who are adrenaline-addicted, charis-
matic, and have thick skins. Not all traders have Ivy League degrees. This
is the niche within investment banking in which street smarts, aggressive-
ness, a winning personality, and quantitative instincts can be enough to
yield a salary far in excess of their contribution to the world. Alexander
Elder’s book: Entries and Exits: Visits to 16 Trading Rooms.
Venture Capitalist. On behalf of a pension fund, foundation, bank, insur-
ance company, or individuals, a VC looks for businesses to invest in, most
often small, fast-growing software or biotech firms, but occasionally low-tech
ventures such as retail or restaurants. Many proposals come in unsolicited or
at cattle calls, in which fund seekers pitch to an audience of VCs. But some of
the best investment ideas are discussed at a bar or on the golf course, so it
doesn’t hurt to be a schmoozer. After you find a prospect, you need MBA-
level quantitative skills to estimate the business’s future value. Just as impor-
tant, you need a nose for judging people because a business succeeds or fails
as much on its people as on its product. After you’re convinced that a busi-
ness is worth investing in, you need the ability to convince investors. You
may, after investing, take a role in guiding the business’s development.
A few VCs work on their own, the so-called angel investors. But most work for
a VC firm or join one of the banks or companies, such as Cisco Systems and
Sony, that have in-house VC shops. Because the salaries can be astronomical,
most jobs at top VC firms (for example, Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Partners)
go to graduates of Harvard or Stanford MBA programs, which have specific
tracks for aspiring VCs. National Venture Capital Association: www.nvca.org.

Professor. A professorship has many upsides: the joy of creating knowledge
and helping others acquire it through your classes, advising, writings, and
conference presentations. You have intelligent, civilized (usually) colleagues,
100
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

and after a few years, tenure for life. Plus, you get to work in one of the more
appealing work environments: a college campus.
The professoriate also has its downsides. As a former faculty member at four
universities and consultant to 15 college presidents, I’m in a position to know.
More and more students are grossly unqualified to do college work and unwill-
ing to work hard, yet routinely complain about too-tough grading if they get a
C. (See the eye-opening book Generation X Goes to College, by Pulitzer Prize
nominee Peter Sacks.) Despite many students’ lack of even basic skills, pro-
fessors, except at two-year colleges, usually need a doctorate, which, depend-
ing on the field, takes an average of 6 to 12 post-bachelor’s degree years to
complete. Does tenure sound good? Be aware that colleges increasingly hire
part-timers and temp faculty. Prospects for permanent jobs are best in engi-
neering, business, and computer science, and for Blacks, Hispanics, and
Native Americans. Office politics can be intense — in few workplaces is there
as much conniving over so few resources. Too, there’s often pressure to pub-
lish journal articles when you’d rather be teaching. Ernest Boyer, the late vice
president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, wrote,
“Winning the campus teaching award is often the kiss of death for promotion
and tenure.”
A final minus: On many campuses, there is the pressure to be politically 
correct — to assign liberal readings, espouse liberal views, and even to pass
students of certain races even though you believe the student’s work doesn’t
justify a passing grade. Harvard president Lawrence Summers nearly got fired
when he suggested, in a private brainstorming session, that genetic predispo-
sition may help explain why there are so few female scientists. He thought he
survived after promising to spend $50 million to increase the number of
women scientists, but no. Soon after, he was forced to step down. American
Association of University Professors: www.aaup.org. John Goldsmith’s book:
The Chicago Guide to Your Academic Career: A Portable Mentor for Scholars
from Graduate School through Tenure.
College classes stress the importance of treating labor fairly, yet colleges are
notorious for hiring part-timers to avoid paying for benefits. Do colleges know
what the word “hypocrisy” means? Colleges also pay many instructors piece-
work, often at very low pay per piece (per course). And don’t make the mis-
take of thinking that if you take a part-time teaching position, you have a
reasonable chance of converting it into a full-time, benefited, tenure track
professorship. That rarely happens.
Thesis Completion Consultant. Many graduate students get close to finish-
ing their degrees but drop out because they have trouble doing their thesis.
You can help. You may guide the student to develop the questions to be
addressed, plan the thesis’s structure and analysis, and review a draft.
Association for Support of Graduate Students: www.asgs.org.
Proposal Writer. Every year, state and federal governments issue thousands
of requests for proposals for every imaginable product and service. They
101
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

may request proposals for a state-of-the-art English-as-a-Second-Language
program, 300 desks for IRS offices, or 50,000 Navy uniforms. The 35,000 private
and corporate foundations issue even more requests for proposals. Organiza-
tions that want to win these contracts often hire proposal writers to maximize
their chances. To become a self-employed proposal writer, try reading the
Commerce Business Daily (cbdnet.gpo.gov) and the Foundation Directory
Online (www.foundationcenter.org) to find proposals you’d like to write,
and contact organizations that may want to bid on the proposals. The Grants-
manship Center: www.tgci.com. Jim Burke’s book: I’ll Grant You That.
Program Evaluator. “You’re judgmental!” That’s usually a criticism, but in
this profession, you’re paid to be judgmental. Typical scenario: You’re hired
to evaluate a school district’s new reading program. You interview students
and teachers, compare test scores with a control group, and write a report of
your findings. Being an evaluator is fun because you get to check out lots of
innovative programs, see what works and what doesn’t, and make recommen-
dations for improvement. The bad part is that many program sponsors don’t
really want your input; they hire you mainly to meet a government requirement.
After all, few people like to be evaluated, especially negatively. A master’s or
doctorate degree filled with statistics courses is usually the admission ticket
to the profession, but program evaluators frequently use only the statistics
they learn in their intro to stats class. American Evaluation Association: www.
eval.org. John Boulmetis’s book: The ABCs of Evaluation, 2nd Edition.
Marketer. Your company wants to introduce a product — maybe a game
that can be played on a cellphone. You review the competition to identify a
gap in the market; for example, perhaps no good game exists for intellectual
teenage girls. Then, with that general product in mind, you review demo-
graphic and psychographic data to find the market segments most likely to
buy it. You conduct surveys and focus groups to see what features would
attract your target market. You help select packaging and a marketing mes-
sage, and last, figure out how best to advertise it: A well-linked blog? Ads on
cellphones? Print ads in high school newspapers? Demand is great for mar-
keters with technical backgrounds — developing a marketing plan for a cir-
cuit board is easier if you’re an engineer. If you want to be a self-employed
marketing consultant, the key, as usual, is to carve out a tiny but in-demand
niche — for example, showing shopping malls how to set up promotions to
bring customers to the mall. (A lost cause, in the long run, I’m betting.)

(Neat Niche) Trend Spotter. Trend spotters visit clubs, cafes, and malls to
see what new things people are buying. They develop the next “in” thing.
In addition to retailers, trend spotters are hired by department store
chains, e-commerce sites, high-tech equipment manufacturers, ad agen-
cies, and even the government. For example, when a city wants to see
what’s in store for it, it may send a trend spotter to Berkeley, California.

(Neat Niche) Focus Group Leader. A key step in developing a product is to
ask a group of people about it. In today’s jargon, that’s called a focus group.
Often, a focus group is simply a structured discussion, but it can be much
more sophisticated. For example, before the president gives a speech, he
may read a draft to a private audience of citizens carefully selected to be
representative of swing voters. Each guinea pig has a dial that can be
turned from 0 (I hate it) to 10 (I love it). They continually adjust the dial as
the president speaks. He then uses only the material that gets a high
rating. The focus group leader selects the participants, runs the proceed-
ings, and writes up the results. David Stewart’s book: Focus Groups: Theory
and Practice (Applied Social Research Methods), 2nd Edition.
(Neat Niche) Social Marketer. The same techniques that Madison Avenue
uses to convince you to buy a brand of cigarettes, social marketers use to
get you to live more wisely. For example, the U.S. government now spends

(Neat Niche) Film Marketer. There’s plenty to market: getting domestic
movie houses to rent films and getting the filmgoers to see them. Then you
have overseas, airlines, cable and network TV, DVD, and now, video-on-
demand markets. I’m not done yet. Don’t forget about the T-shirts and base-
ball caps. Independent Film & Television Alliance: www.ifta-online.org.
(Neat Niche) Marketing Researcher. You design surveys to collect needed
information. In addition to in-house corporate or nonprofit marketing
departments, you can work for independent polling organizations. Biggies
include Gallup, Field, Harris, and Roper. Pollsters have enormous power. 
A subtle change of wording can dramatically change a poll’s results. The
question “Would you eat corn that came from seeds specially bred to pro-
duce sweeter corn?” will yield a very different result than “Are you con-
cerned about eating genetically engineered corn?” Marketing Research

Business Developer. Most businesses need someone to ask, “What alliances
could I create that would build the business? Would it be to license our cool
technology? Co-brand? Merge with someone?” Business developer is today’s
term for the old and crucial job of dealmaker. Surprisingly, for this key position,

small companies often hire young, smart, silver tongues not long out of col-
lege. Business developer is one of the more responsible and heart-pumping
jobs a newbie can get. David Aaker’s book: Developing Business Strategies.
Management Consultant. Your job is to solve problems too tough for an
organization to solve by itself. Examples: A firm wants to start selling in Asia.
A nonprofit needs a better system for managing the information flow. A
startup has a great idea, but now what? Yes, to address such problems, you
need top analytical skills, but you also must be persuasive and tactful — even
though you’re a 20-something with no real work experience, you’re telling a
veteran what to do. You also must be willing to work long hours. The typical
management consultant for a major firm works 50 to 80 hours a week and trav-
els half the time. Management consulting is a great career for learning about
the business world, to have major impact on a company while you’re still in
your 20s, and to hang around with really smart (and well-paid) people. However,
for a decent shot at being hired by a top consulting firm, such as Accenture or
McKinsey, you must have good grades from a designer-label college and make
a great impression in tough interviews. Small management consulting firms
and self-employment are alternate possibilities. One self-marketing tack is to
write a proposal to the ten small firms you think you can best help. Wikipedia

Organizational Identity Consultant. Large companies and nonprofits hire
consultants to create logos and slogans that capture their essence. That sells
more product and encourages employees to feel good about the company.
Although this may not be the most socially redeeming job, it pays well and, to
me, sounds fun. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporate_
identity. David Carter’s book: American Corporate Identity 2007.
Organizational Developer. Organizational developers figure out how to
make workgroups more effective, often with trainings, sometimes by restruc-
turing. They may also be involved in team building and diversity training.
Some insiders, however, report that many ODers approach the latter two
activities with trepidation because of past failures. When I recently suggested
that a client, an organizational developer with 20 years of experience, may
want to do more team building and diversity training, he grimaced, put his
hands over his face and moaned, “Noooo! Anything but that!” Wikipedia

(Neat Niche) Business Plan Writer. Many business owners know they need
a business plan but don’t know how to create one. Inexpensive software
packages, such as BizPlan Builder, can help you make business plans look
professional, but the key to being a good business plan writer is under-
standing what it takes to identify and market a winning product or service,
and raise money for and operate the business. This seems like a fun career,
helping come up with the business idea and implementation plan without
incurring any financial risk or dealing with the headaches of running the
business. A way to find clients: Teach a class at a public library or college’s
extension school on how to write a business plan. About.com’s business

(Neat Niche) Private-Practice Consultant. Many doctors are running
scared. So are many dentists, podiatrists, psychotherapists, orthodontists,
veterinarians, chiropractors, lawyers, and CPAs. They’re scared because
they increasingly realize that being good practitioners doesn’t make them
good businesspersons. So they’re turning to consultants to help recruit new
customers and develop better systems for billing and collections, payroll,
records management, and personnel. Demand is strong, and you work with
educated people with the money and motivation to pay you well. National
Society of Certified Healthcare Business Consultants: www.smdmc.org.
(Neat Niche) Security System Consultant. Only one-fourth of homes and
businesses have security systems, but many more people are thinking
about installing one. The expertise required to become a consultant in this
specialty is less than for most fields, but the stakes are high. Thus, cus-
tomers may be willing to pay for a consultant. Michael Khairallah’s book:

Acoustics Specialist. You probably know that acoustics specialists ensure
good sound in a concert hall, but they also keep offices quiet so you can 
concentrate, and homes quiet so you can sleep. In addition, acoustics spe-
cialists help design loudspeakers and microphones, and recording and film
studios. Acousticians also are the folks who created sonograms — safer alter-
natives to X-rays and invasive diagnostic tests. Acoustical Society of America:
asa.aip.org.
Coroner/Medical Examiner. Did Professor Plum do it with the candlestick
in the conservatory? Or did the victim die of natural causes? Medical examin-
ers, who, in many jurisdictions, don’t need to be MDs, answer such ques-
tions. It isn’t the sort of medical career that makes a great first impression:
you cure no one and you spend your life mucking around with dead people.
Fortunately, after a period of desensitization, playing around with corpses
begins to feel normal. And it is rewarding work: One medical examiner
described it as “the only career in which you enable dead people to save
lives.” National Association of Medical Examiners: www.thename.org.
Microscopist. Imagine being able to look at something at 500,000 times mag-
nification, in three dimensions. That’s what today’s microscopists can do.
Why would you want to magnify something so greatly? To examine what hap-
pens to diseased cancer cells at the molecular level, to assess the quality of
the ceramic coating on a rocket’s heat shield, or to determine whether the
DNA of skin underneath a suspect’s fingernails matches that of the person
who was strangled. Microscopy Society of America: www.microscopy.org.
Oceanographer. You see them on TV, diving off a spacious boat on a perfect
day, exploring a coral reef in pursuit of new ways to preserve the ecosystem.
Those types of oceanographers still are around but increasingly they help
restore shorelines, build offshore oil rigs, and rehab bridges. No matter the
specialty, a career in oceanography has downsides that don’t make it onto
the National Geographic special. Many oceanographers spend months far
from home, much of that time freezing in cramped quarters. Something else
those TV specials don’t highlight are the many hours oceanographers spend
far from the sea: in cubicles, crunching numbers. A master’s or PhD in marine
science is standard, but people familiar with boats, electronics, or dive appa-
ratus can get onto oceanographic expeditions without a college degree.
Oceanography Society: www.tos.org.
Geographer. Michael Jordan was a geography major. Can’t you just imagine
him debating: “Hmm, should I be a geographer or a pro basketball player?”
Well, assuming you don’t have pro basketball potential, geography offers
some pretty cool careers. Don’t think that geographers mainly make maps.
Only a small percentage does. (Mapmakers are covered under the separate
“Cartographer” entry in the later section “Work with Things and Data.”)
Geographers are often experts on such matters as global warming, where to
do economic development, and Afghani terrain. If you decide to become a
geographer, you’ll be in good company: Mother Teresa started out as a geog-
raphy teacher. About.com’s geography portal: geography.about.com.

(Neat Niche) Location Expert. Everyone knows that the three keys to a
business’s success are location, location, and location. Because geogra-
phers know about demographics, transportation, availability of labor,
shopping patterns, and how cities expand, geographers are good candi-
dates for helping organizations figure out where to open up shop. Zvi
Drezner’s book: Facility Location.
(Neat Niche) Area Specialist. The government or a company wants to
understand a country so its plans are on target. So, area specialists brief
their bosses based on information from the media, government docu-
ments, aerial photos, and intelligence reports.
Silviculturist. Silviculturists are forest builders. You create, restore, or main-
tain a forest or tree nursery. Your job is to pick the right tree varieties and
supervise planting, pruning, and harvesting. Also, you may conduct research
on topics such as the best way to ensure rapid tree growth, or the effects of
animal grazing on the forest. Although most silviculturists live in isolated
locations, urban forestry is a possibility as cities look to provide islands of
respite amid the maelstrom. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
silviculture. Society of American Foresters: www.safnet.org.
Viticulturist. In plain English, this is a grape grower, and often a vineyard
manager. Typically, you work for a winery and direct its field operations. 
With an enologist (wine expert; see the profile in the later section “Work with
Things and Data”), you decide which grape varieties to plant and how to
grow them for best flavor. Because you’re a manager, it helps if you know
accounting. Although you aren’t the farmer, you’ll find yourself doing a lot 
of bending. But don’t worry, there’s free wine to dull any aches. American
Society for Enology and Viticulture: www.asev.org. Lon Rombough’s book: The
Grape Grower.
Pilot. I’ve often wondered whether this career was boring. After all, it seems
you’re basically just a bus driver whose bus has wings. Yet many people aspire
to be pilots. I guess it’s the takeoff, aerial views, and landing, the prestige and
good pay, and perhaps, all those motel nights with flight attendants. Most
pilots like their careers. But how to land a job? Those plum commercial air-
line jobs generally go to former military pilots and to others with thousands of
air hours and certifications from an FAA-certified training school. The good
news is that many under-the-radar pilot jobs exist. And they may be more
interesting than long-distance commercial flights on which you spend hours
staring at instruments that are actually flying the plane, and as a reward for
all that staring, you get jet lag. Under-the-radar pilot jobs: rescuing injured
people, aerial advertising, fish spotting, flight instructor, tracking criminals,
burial-at-sea, dropping aerodynamically packaged seedlings for reforestation,
helicopter-based radio/TV traffic reports, emergency parts delivery, and
patrol — oil and electric companies have pilots fly over pipelines and electri-
cal lines to check for leaks. Aviation Communication: www.flightinfo.com.

Healthcare
Registered Nurse. Today, whether the patient gets well depends at least as
much on the nurse as on the doctor. As cost-cutting pressures increase, regis-
tered nurses are doing more and more substantive medical care, and medical
assistants now mainly handle bedpan cleaning. RN pay is solid, in some met-
ropolitan areas, reaching $100,000. A two-year degree is all that’s required,
although a bachelor’s and especially a master’s will open additional interest-
ing doors. According to the Health Resources Services Administration, 400,000
nurses with master’s degrees are needed for such positions as nursing super-
visor, nurse practitioner, nurse educator, midwife, and anesthetist. Yet, only
140,000 nurses have a master’s. Here’s a field in which a master’s makes sense.
I keep hearing of nurses who ignore patients’ call bells and of nurse errors
that endanger or kill patients. Please, only consider nursing if you are, even
when stressed, a caring, detail-oriented person. Information: www.discover
nursing.com. About.com’s nursing portal: nursing.about.com. American
Association of Colleges of Nursing: www.aacn.nche.edu. Suzanne Gordon’s

(Neat Niche) Nurse Practitioner. You derive most of the benefits of being 
a physician with few of the liabilities. You get to do the fun parts of doctor-
ing: exams, health education, and treating treatable conditions like that sore
throat. And if things get too tough, you refer your patient to a physician.
And you needn’t subject yourself to four expensive, exhausting years of
medical school, an even more exhausting year of internship, and two to
four years of residency. A two-year training program following your bache-
lor’s in nursing, and you’re in, and with a good salary to boot. American
College of Nurse Practitioners: www.acnpweb.org.
(Neat Niche) Nurse Anesthetist. Anesthesiologists earn $250,000-plus a
year and HMOs don’t like that one little bit. So HMOs increasingly prefer
nurse anesthetists because they can pay them half that — good money for
a nurse — and still save a bundle. Some general nursing experience plus a
two- or three-year program after the bachelor’s degree opens the door to
108

thetists are men, compared with just nine percent among nurses overall.

(Neat Niche) Nurse Midwife. More and more moms-to-be and healthcare
bean counters are attracted to midwifery’s combination of lower costs and
more human touch. And midwifery can be a gratifying career. Not only do
you deliver babies, but you also provide pre- and postnatal care such as
teaching moms to breast feed. Registered nurses must complete a year of
additional training for nurse-midwife certification. American College of
Nurse-Midwives: www.acnm.org. Juliana van Olphen-Fehr’s book: Diary of 
a Midwife.
(Neat Niche) Obstetric-Gynecological Nurse. Experience the miracle of
childbirth on a daily basis. This can be a stressful job, and not just in a

(Neat Niche) Transplant Coordinator. You’ve drunk yourself into a stupor
once too often, so your liver is kaput. Doc says you need a transplant. The
transplant coordinator decides where you belong on the waiting list. (Too
far back, in your soused opinion.) When someone dies whose liver is the
right size and blood type, the transplant coordinator schedules the team
for surgery, and gives you your pre- and postsurgery education. Center for
Organ Recovery & Education: www.core.org.
(Neat Niche) Wellness Coordinator. Large employers, hospitals, and occa-
sionally cities hire wellness coordinators to arrange health fairs, conduct
blood pressure and lipid screenings, coordinate noon aerobics and stop-
smoking classes, and, of course, encourage employees to eat more broc-
coli and less Häagen-Dazs. American Association for Health Education:
www.aahperd.org/aahe.
(Neat Niche) Patient Discharge Planner. As hospitals release patients
more quickly, discharge planners help patients transition to in-home care.
A planner decides whether Mrs. McGillicuddy needs a home-health aide,
trains her or her family on how to self-administer injections and other
treatments, and helps the family solve problems as they arise. The work is
generally less stressful than direct patient care. Jackie Birmingham’s book:
Discharge Planning Guide.
(Neat Niche) Case Manager. A 90-year-old woman has been battling cancer
for five years. Her cancer has now spread to her liver, and she’s in pain.
Should she receive another operation? How about painful physical therapy
for her atrophying leg? Should she be in the hospital? At home? In a hospice?
What should and shouldn’t the insurer pay for? The case manager coordi-
nates this decision-making process and has one of the more interesting
roles in the managed care system. After reviewing the record, speaking
109
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

with the patient, family, healthcare providers, and insurance company, and
leading rounds, the case manager makes recommendations that balance
the interests of everyone involved: the payer, the hospital, the family, and,
of course, the patient. Catherine Mullahy’s book: The Case Manager’s
Handbook, Third Edition.
(Neat Niche) Clinical Trials Coordinator. A pharmaceutical company devel-
ops a new treatment that works on the computer and with rats, so it’s time
for human subjects. Nurses are hired to examine potential patients, admin-
ister the treatment, ensure that patients are complying, and write reports.
This is a neat niche because it’s little known, in demand, and a different
experience for the nurse burned out on patient care who would enjoy
being part of a research team. Information: www.clinicaltrials.gov.
(Neat Niche) Menopause Counselor. Menopause has come out of the
closet, if the number of T-shirts proclaiming, “I’m out of estrogen and I
have a gun,” are any indication. As they enter the “change of life,” some
women seek support beyond what their gynecologist can provide during
the quickie annual exams that HMOs usually pay for. Google “menopause
counseling.”
(Neat Niche) Nurse Informatician. Nurses need to access lots of data:
patient records, drug contraindications, disease ins-and-outs, and insur-
ance gobbledygook. The nurse informatician works with the computer pro-
grammer to develop systems that are nurse-friendly and is on call to help
nurses having trouble extracting information. The pay’s good, the job’s
rewarding, and there’s no blood and gore. American Nursing Informatics
Association: www.ania.org.
(Neat Niche) Nurse Legal Consultant. Law firms are inundated with people
who want to sue their doctors or hospitals for medical malpractice. To
evaluate those claims’ legitimacy, lawyers hire nurse legal consultants to
review the medical records, and if the case seems meritorious and involves
nursing malpractice, to research the nursing literature to develop the case’s
foundation. Nurse legal consultants also testify in trials as expert witnesses.
American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants: www.aalnc.org.
Exercise Physiologist. Athletes are learning to perform better, not just with
a coach’s help, but with the help of an exercise physiologist. The latter may,
for example, show an athlete how to improve by using slow-motion, computer-
analyzed video of exactly what his muscles are doing. In addition to consult-
ing with teams, exercise physiologists get jobs in sports medicine, cardiac
rehab clinics, and corporate fitness centers. American Society of Exercise
Physiologists: www.asep.org. William McArdle’s book: Exercise Physiology.
Respiratory Therapist. Humans can live for days without food or water, but
without air, we’re dead in nine minutes. A respiratory therapist’s job is to
keep patients breathing — often not just the very old, but also the very young.
Newborns must often be placed on sophisticated ventilators. Your job is to

monitor the ventilators to ensure proper oxygen, CO2, and pH levels. You also

sonings. American Association for Respiratory Care: www.aarc.org.

Network Administrator. “The network is down. What the heck happened?”
“I don’t believe it! I lost my data!” Network administrators install and repair
those oh-so-complicated systems. You’re a combination mega-Tinkertoys
assembler, electrician, programmer, and fix-it person. The job’s tough, but,
for the right person, it’s fun because you get to see how all the pieces fit
together, and there’s variety, including needs assessment with actual human
beings and hands-on computer diagnostic brainwork. Plus, you’re crucial to
everyone who uses the network — you receive heartfelt thank-yous when
you get people back up and running. This is no 9-to-5 job; you work until it’s
fixed. You are well paid, though. The Department of Labor projects great

fications in security (see www.sans.org) and monitor the Computer
Emergency Response Team site (www.cert.org) to learn about the latest
threats. The Federal Computer Security Division: csrc.nist.gov. Rick
Lehtinen’s book: Computer Security Basics.
Quality Assurance Specialist. If you’d get a kick out of checking out prod-
ucts to see whether they’re up to snuff, this job may be for you. And actually,
you often get to do more than just try to make the software crash or sniff
around the production line. QA people are often brought into meetings with
higher-ups and taken on sales calls — you, more than anyone, can describe
all the steps taken to ensure that the product works as advertised. The down-
side: You’re the person who’s telling everyone to improve — not likely to
make you popular at work. With the rush to get products to market before a
competitor does, it isn’t surprising that software testers don’t catch every
bug. For example, syndicated columnist Bob Weinstein reports that Microsoft
employs 3,000 testers, yet upon release, MS Word reportedly had 60,000 bugs.
American Society for Quality: www.asq.org.
Risk Management Specialist. The insurance industry is an attractive
employer because of good salaries, but for many people, it’s a turnoff because
of the nature of the product. One of the more rewarding insurance careers is
111

in loss prevention, or as it’s increasingly called, risk management. Rather than,
for example, being an adjuster, whose job is to give loss victims as little as
possible, the risk manager has the more pleasant role of helping a business
develop a strategy to prevent losses. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/

Employment Tester. To avoid costly hiring mistakes and charges of discrim-
ination in hiring, employers increasingly are supplementing interviews with
formal testing. Consultants select off-the-shelf instruments and develop cus-
tomized tests, notably simulations, to predict which candidate is likely to do the
job best. Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology: www.siop.org.
School Computer Coordinator. Schools are filling with computers, but after
planting, many groves of Apples are gathering dust. The main problem is
teachers who don’t know how to use them effectively. Enter the school com-
puter coordinator — combination network administrator, teacher trainer, and
troubleshooter with a knack for figuring out how to help Johnny with whatever

Planner. Should Wal-Mart be allowed to open a store in your city? What’s the
wisest plan for revitalizing downtown? How can you make the county environ-
mentally sustainable without destroying the economy or greatly impeding
people’s quality of life? To address such questions, you, the planner, review
copious data, conduct studies and public hearings, and before making a rec-
ommendation, probably wear many hats, including that of an engineer, econ-
omist, architect, sociologist, and politician. A silver tongue is essential if you
expect even vestiges of your plan to survive irate community groups. Many
planners specialize in urban or rural land use, transportation, housing, air
quality, water quality, health and human services, historic preservation, or
hazardous materials. American Planning Association: www.planning.org.

FBI Special Agent. Are you an aspiring James or Jane Bond? The reality is
usually less exotic, investigating such mundane dalliances as your basic fraud-
ulent bankruptcy, but FBI special agents do search out terrorists, corrupt offi-
cials, kidnappers, people spying on the U.S., hackers, drug traffickers, identity
thieves, mobsters, and bank robbers. Downsides are that you travel a lot and
are alone most of the time. The FBI employs more than 10,000 special agents,
and prefers a graduate degree in law or accounting or fluency in a foreign lan-
guage. No surprise, Middle Eastern languages are in particular demand. Are you
37 or older? Forget it; the FBI wants to hire young. So do most employers, but
age discrimination laws prevent it. The FBI is above all that. Entry-level job title:

gonna call? Your friendly private investigator. He’ll hang out in the neighbor-
hood, talk with some folks (hopefully without arousing suspicions), dig through
online public information, and use that time-honored PI technique: dumpster
diving. PIs must be able to read people and persuade them to give you infor-
mation. Remember Columbo?
Some danger exists here. For example, a wife has a husband followed. If hubby
catches you, the private investigator, he may want to redecorate your face.
The good news is that such mishaps are rare, especially nowadays, when many
more cases are solved by a computer search than by stakeout. This is a cool

Work with Data, Things, and People
Physician. With Boomers aging, elder treatments improving, and demand
for cosmetic surgery growing, there is a shortage of physicians. Plus, health
maintenance organizations hire many doctors at good salaries while relieving
them of much insurance paperwork. And of course, this career is prestigious
and well paying. But practicing medicine today does have downsides. Getting
into medical school is difficult, and after you’re in, it’s usually an exhausting,
expensive ordeal. It can cost $200,000 and is usually followed by a few years
of low-paying, 100-hour weeks of internship and residency. Insurers constrain
how physicians can practice medicine: Patient visits are shorter, and ever-
more treatments are subject to insurer scrutiny. Meanwhile, malpractice suits
climb. In many specialties, the physician’s life is very stressful. Consider the
typically six to eight years after college that it takes to prepare to be a physi-
cian, the enormous cost of medical school, the fraternity-like hazing called
internship, the strain of high-stakes decision making, having to inform unsus-
pecting patients of severe illnesses, and the now usually prohibitive costs of
starting your own practice.
And there’s more. Medicine is changing so rapidly that it’s impossible to keep
up; so many physicians feel guilty that because of their own lack of knowledge
and insurer constraints, they may not be providing optimal care. Meanwhile,
some patients, armed with Internet printouts, feel they know more than the
doc — and sometimes they do. Because physicians have ready access to mind-
altering drugs, many docs turn to them for stress relief. American Medical Asso-
ciation: www.ama-assn.org. Jennifer Danek’s book: Becoming a Physician.

For some aspiring physicians, physician assistant (which I cover later in this
section) and nurse practitioner (see the profile in the earlier section “Work
with Data, People, and Things”) may be wiser career choices even though
they have less prestige and lower income potential.
If, however, you want to consider the MD route, there are neat niches. They’re
notable not only because they’re relatively pleasurable compared with other
niches, but also because they typically offer reasonable work hours.
If you have a bachelor’s degree but not the science prerequisites for medical
school, many colleges now offer a one-year post-bachelor’s program that
medical schools will consider.
(Neat Niche) Infectious Disease Specialist. As you’re reading this, terrorist
groups and governments may well be developing one-of-a-kind mutated
viruses to use as bioweapons. The chances of that affecting you remain
small, but that’s not true of this: Natural selection is creating superbacte-
ria that are resistant to even the most powerful antibacterials. Too, the
odds of contracting infectious diseases is growing because of easier world-
wide travel and continued migration to crowded, urban areas. I’m not just
talking about newly discovered pathogens such as the West Nile or Avian
flu viruses. Cases of the formerly thought-of-as-cured tuberculosis are
increasing in the United States because of uncontrolled immigration. And
then there’s AIDS: the virus itself and the myriad opportunistic infections
that its victims contract. Infectious disease researchers and practitioners
do some of humankind’s most important and challenging work. Infectious
Diseases Society of America: www.idsociety.org.
(Neat Niche) College-Based Physician. College student health problems
are usually curable, you have no overhead, and you work in a beautiful,
stimulating setting: a college campus.
(Neat Niche) Sports Medicine. How’d you like to be the team physician for
a college football team and/or treat weekend warriors’ sprains and concus-
sions? Here’s another physician specialty in which you succeed with a
large percentage of your patients. The difference between sports medicine
and orthopedics? Only the latter does surgery. American Medical Society
for Sports Medicine: www.amssm.org.
(Neat Niche) Occupational Medicine. This niche offers many advantages:
need, good compensation, variety, and a high success rate. On-the-job
accidents and job-related illnesses are frequent, with a relative shortage of
occupational medicine docs. Employers and insurers know that your efforts
to prevent on-the-job illnesses and accidents will save them lots of money,
so compensation is good. Internal medicine, psychiatry, surgery, epidemi-
ology, toxicology, forensic medicine, administration, preventive medicine —
occupational medicine encompasses them all. You help a high percentage
of your patients. American College of Occupational and Environmental
Medicine: www.acoem.org.

(Neat Niche) Radiologist. Few medical fields have advanced more in recent
decades. Diagnostic radiologists used to rely mainly on X-rays, which pro-
duce crude images while exposing patients to significant radiation. Today,
ultrasound, and especially CT (CAT and PET) and MRI scans, enable far
more useful images with lower risk to the patient. Interventional radiolo-
gists now are involved in, for example, cutting-edge (pardon the pun) pro-
cedures such as opening blood vessels and inserting stents in diseased
arteries. Radiology Info: www.radiologyinfo.org/en/careers/index.
cfm?pg=diagcareer. Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
radiologist.
(Neat Niche) Dermatologist. After med school, you first choose a spe-
cialty, and dermatology is among the most competitive because it’s so
desirable: You help most of your patients look better than ever. Patients
treated by other medical specialists usually feel fortunate to just get back
to where they were. Some dermatologists specialize, for example, in excis-
ing cancers, or more often, in doing cosmetic surgery. And newly available
techniques make it more likely you’ll delight your patients, and with ever-
shorter recovery times. (Botox, anyone?) Wikipedia entry: en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/dermatology.
Don’t overlook this cool career just because society tends to denigrate cos-
metic surgery as a narcissistic luxury, one that objectifies the body rather
than focusing on a person’s substance. I used to think that way myself. But
I’ve seen a number of people’s lives improve as a result of the surgery — they
feel better about themselves every minute of every day and are even more
productive at work. So, I’ve become a bit of a fan. I wonder whether cosmetic
surgery has done more to improve people’s sense of well-being than years on
the psychologist’s couch.
(Neat Niche) Infertility Specialist. Ever-more women are deferring parent-
hood until getting pregnant isn’t so easy. Enter the infertility doctor, with
an ever-growing array of fixes, including in-vitro fertilization, with ever-
better egg screening to help ensure normalcy. Today, fertility docs even
allow you to pick your baby’s sex. Most people know couples who had a
boy or two and were eager for a girl, only to have another boy. Today’s in-
vitro fertilization methods allow you to have a child with the gender of
your choice. What’s next: ensuring that your child isn’t ugly? Has a high
IQ? American Society for Reproductive Medicine: www.asrm.org.
(Neat Niche) Hospital Research Director. Many hospitals, even those
unaffiliated with universities, conduct research. Research director is a
great job for a burned-out doc who wants to improve the quality of med-
ical care rather than just implementing the status quo. Grant proposal
writing skills are key.
Physician Assistant. This career is similar to nurse practitioner. See that
profile in the earlier section “Work with Data, People, and Things.” For most
doctors, the fun part is doctoring — diagnosing patients, treating them, doing
115
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

patient education. The dreary parts are the paperwork, managing the office,
and dealing with insurance companies. Physician assistants enjoy many of
the benefits of being a physician with few of its liabilities. Under a doctor’s
supervision, physician assistants do diagnosis, treatment, and patient educa-
tion, but training takes just two to three years — much fewer than doctors
put in. And paperwork and management responsibilities are few. According
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this career is among the fastest growing, as
healthcare organizations cut costs by using physician assistants more and
doctors less. Salaries aren’t doctor-level, but they’re respectable — about
$80,000 on average. To enter this field, you need a bachelor’s degree in a sci-
ence/health field and a few years of experience as a nurse, EMT, or para-
medic. American Academy of Physician Assistants: www.aapa.org. Terence
Sacks’s book: Opportunities in Physician Assistant Careers. Andrew Rodican’s
book: Getting Into the Physician Assistant School of Your Choice.
Audiologist. As Boomers age, their hearing fades, so demand should be
strong. Plus, you’re ever-more likely to satisfy customers because hearing
aids are getting better. For the self-conscious, some new hearing aids are so
tiny that everything fits into your ear canal except the gizmo you pull it out
with — the nation’s most famous user is Bill Clinton. Many audiologists get
out of the office and spend part of each week in hospitals, rehab centers, and
special schools. Alas, increasingly, a doctoral degree is required. Audiology
Net: www.audiologynet.com/audiologist.html. Frederick Martin’s book:
Introduction to Audiology, 9th Edition.
Veterinarian. A vet is like a doctor except you need to know a half-dozen
species, none of which can describe their symptoms to you. Veterinary medi-
cine offers advantages over being a physician. You get to perform a wider
range of procedures because, in many specialties, board certification isn’t
required. Plus, most veterinary medicine is fee-for-service, so you aren’t bogged
down with labyrinthine regulations and paperwork. One downside is that vet-
erinary offices tend to be loud: lots of barking. American Veterinary Medical
Association: www.avma.org. About.com’s veterinary portal: vetmedicine.
about.com. Gene Witiak’s book: True Confessions of a Veterinarian.
(Neat Niche) Laboratory Animals Vet. It’s a relatively easy specialty: work-
ing hours are 9 to 5, no weekends, and you get to work in a medical school
or drug company setting. There are ample jobs because most animal
research must be supervised by a laboratory animal vet.
(Neat Niche) Veterinary Cardiologist. Demand is growing, treatments are
improving, and earnings are excellent for these heart specialists. About.com’s

Veterinary Technologist. Much shorter training than for veterinarians, yet
veterinary techs get to do much of what vets do. Say that poor Fifi isn’t feeling
well. You, the vet tech, may take her medical history (if you can speak dog),
give her an exam, and take her blood (poor Fifi). The vet diagnoses the prob-
lem as a bladder infection and prescribes an injection that you administer.
Next, even poorer Bowser comes in — he was run over by a car. The vet decides
to operate. You administer the anesthetic and assist in surgery. You’re even
allowed to stitch Bowser up. Bowser also has a broken leg. You take the X-rays,
the vet sets the leg, and you apply the cast. Finally, you educate Bowser’s
mommy or daddy about how to take care of Bowser during his recovery. You
needn’t be dogged to land a job because there are four job openings for every
vet tech graduate in the United States. The problem is that salaries are poopy.
North American Veterinary Technologists Association: www.avma.org/navta.
Paramedic. A person is having a heart attack. Or three teens are down after
a gang war. Or there’s a bad car accident and bleeding passengers are tangled
in the wreckage. The paramedic is first on the scene to try to save the day. If
you thrive on adrenaline but can stay calm and be gratified by your saves but
not burned out by your losses, this can be a rewarding career. Training is
short. Initial certification as an emergency medical technician (EMT) is short
(just 100 to 120 hours!). Full paramedic status requires 750 to 2,000 hours and
certifies you to do the stuff they do on ER. This is a burnout profession, so
after a few years, figure on going for an RN or physician assistant degree.
Demand continues to grow as Boomers age and the number of illegal immi-
grants (unscreened for violent criminal records) grows. National Association
of Emergency Medical Technicians: www.naemt.org.
Physical Therapist. An executive with BlackBerry thumb (from checking
e-mail too often), an older person recovering from a stroke, an infant with a
birth defect — each of these is a typical physical therapy patient. The physi-
cal therapist’s job is to develop programs to relieve pain and restore func-
tion. Many people think of a physical therapist as the person who coaches
the patient through exercises, but in many cases, that’s done mainly by less
expensive physical therapy assistants. Increasingly, the physical therapist is
primarily the patient’s plan maker and instructor. Aging Boomers will create
strong demand for physical therapists. Admission to PT school has become
difficult, only a notch easier than medical school. This is another of those
fields in which a doctoral degree is becoming required. American Physical
Therapy Association: www.apta.org.
(Neat Niche) Sports Physical Therapy. Helping people who hurt themselves
trying to stay in shape tends to be a more rewarding, less burnout-prone
niche than traditional physical therapy, which more often deals with cases
in which progress is slow. Sports Physical Therapy Section: www.spts.org.

Acupuncturist. Insert needles, manipulate carefully, restore balance in so-
called “energy fields,” and possibly help everything from weight loss to pain
control, and from arthritis to upper respiratory infections. Not only is the public
willing to try, but some insurance companies are also paying. Quackwatch.com

Work with Words and People
Attorney. You’re lousy at science and like to argue, so you go to law school,
right? Catch this: Three-fourths of lawyers wish they were doing something
else. A similar percentage wouldn’t recommend that their children become
lawyers. That’s because the job is often contentious and filled with tempta-
tions to be unethical. Yet, armies of college graduates run off to law school
seeking money, status, an opportunity to change the world, and/or a TV
lawyer wardrobe. It’s a myth that law is an easy route to a six-figure income.
Assuming you can land a lucrative gig, you’ll probably work 60-plus-hour
weeks — some law firms buy futons for their offices so the lawyers can sleep
there. And many attorneys don’t make big money. Indeed, many lawyers are
forced to work as paralegals who may make no more than garbage collectors.
Another myth is that lawyers spend most of their time in a courtroom. Even
litigators spend only a small fraction of their time before a judge, and transac-
tional attorneys, who draft agreements, rarely see the inside of a courtroom.
For most law jobs, the ability to make airtight arguments is key, but another
essential is being detail-oriented. Law is about preparation, which often
means reading through the sheaves of dry material you can’t pawn off on
your paralegal.
Final myth: The law is a good option for people who want to cure social ills.
Many students enter law school with that hope. The reality is that only a tiny
percentage of lawyers end up with public interest jobs. I know one Yale Law
School graduate who clerked for a U.S Circuit Court of Appeals judge, yet was
turned down for a low-paying job at the National Abortion Rights League.
The good news is that the following neat niches offer a reasonable chance of
having it all: the prestige, the money, and a more pleasant life than experi-
enced by the typical corporate or insurance defense attorney.

There’s money to be made in them thar hills. Most lawyers choose to live in

(Neat Niche) Computer Law. My name is McDonald. I register my food
business on the Web as www.McDonald#1.com (fictitious). Can the folks
from the Golden Arches sue me? My employer lends me a computer to use
at home during the days I telecommute. One evening, on that computer, I
write a love letter to my wife. The employer screens it and says it’s unau-
thorized use of a company computer. Is the company right? My company

program. A year later, an awfully similar program appears on a Chinese

everything from product endorsements to estate planning. Sports Lawyers

of Sports Agents. Sports Law Blog: sports-law.blogspot.com.
(Neat Niche) Adoption Attorney. How different this is from traditional
adversarial lawyering — helping to match a child needing parents with
parents wanting to adopt a child. It’s a far cry from the other sort of family
law: divorcing couples ready to kill each other over an armoire. Links:

(Neat Niche) Employment Lawyer. This is among the law’s fastest-growing
specialties. Legal employment remedies have been expanded for minori-
ties, the disabled, and homosexuals who believe they have been discrimi-
nated against in the workplace. Employers must be increasingly careful to
119
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

ensure that they comply with all laws and are prudently responsive to the
ever-growing number of lawsuits. Employment lawyers are key to all this.
Of course, on the other side, claimants need lawyers to handle their cases.
Bottom line: lots of work for employment lawyers. Vault.com links: www.

(Neat Niche) Mediator/Arbitrator. See the mediator profile in the earlier
section “Caretaking and coaching.”
(Neat Niche) Education Lawyer. Johnny has gone through 12 years of
schooling and still can’t read. Who’s responsible? Many parents are claim-
ing that the schools should be, and they’re hiring lawyers to file big-dollar
lawsuits against school districts. Education lawyers, of course, also defend
school districts against these and other claims. Other cases may, for exam-
ple, involve a teacher who was fired for incompetence and claims that due
process was violated, a group of Black parents suing a school district
because a disproportionate number of student suspensions are African-
Americans, or a child who falls off a schoolyard play structure whose
parent claims inadequate supervision. Education Law Association: www.
educationlaw.org.
(Neat Niche) Intellectual Property/Patent Lawyer. When you think of
patents, contraptions may come to mind, but today, patents often are
awarded for such things as genes, computer chips, and genetically engi-
neered mice. The intellectual property lawyer obtains that patent. She
must understand both the science and the law to convince the United
States Patent and Trademark Office that the new product truly is different
from existing products. So it’s no surprise that most intellectual property
lawyers have a science or engineering background in addition to a law
degree. Robert Benson, a patent attorney for Human Genome Sciences,
loves his job: “In the lab, you can only do so much research work, but as a
patent attorney you get to experience literally hundreds of lifetimes of
research work.” National Association of Patent Practitioners: napp.org.
American Intellectual Property Law Association: www.aipla.org.
(Neat Niche) Space Lawyer. As more and more government and commer-
cial satellites orbit Earth, disputes arise. Does a country have the right to
launch a surveillance satellite that circles the globe? Who owns which
rights to the moon? They’re already selling tickets for commercial space
flights. What sorts of contracts are needed to protect the spacelines and
their passengers? Space law is, as they used to say in the 1960s, a new
frontier. Information: www.spacelawstation.com.

(Neat Niche) Elder Lawyer. Family members or nursing home staff,
exhausted from caring for senile, incontinent patients, often commit elder
abuse, leaving old people unturned so they develop bedsores, or tied
down with restraints for the staff’s convenience. Lawyers specializing in
elder law argue whether there’s legal liability. Elder Law Answers:
www.elderlawanswers.com. National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys:
www.naela.org. Steve Weisman’s book: A Guide to Elder Planning.
(Neat Niche) Environmental Lawyer. No one wants to despoil the earth,
but companies and government regulators have different ideas of how
much despoiling is cost-effective to avoid. Even within the government,
there’s confusion as federal, state, and local regulations often contradict
each other, providing plenty of fodder for environmental lawyers. Links:
www.findlaw.com/01topics/13environmental/index.html.
Environmental Law Institute: www.eli.org.
(Neat Niche) Tax Attorney. This is among law’s highest-paid specialties,
and it’s easy to understand why. A corporation is structuring a deal — do
it right and the company can save millions in taxes. Individuals, too, are
willing to pay big bucks to a tax attorney — for example, when being
audited for deducting that trip to Bora Bora. Shannon Nash’s book: Vault
Guide to Tax Law Careers.
(Neat Niche) Estate Attorney. After a lifetime of work, you’ve accumulated
quite a nest egg. Although you’ve already been taxed on that income, the
government wants to tax it again when you die — nice way for the govern-
ment to offer its condolences. The estate attorney’s job is to write wills
and trusts to minimize this double taxation. As the Boomers age, this spe-
cialty continues to grow. Introduction to Estate Law: www.mylawyer.com/
guide.asp?level=1&id=623.
Paralegal. To cut costs, paralegals are doing much of the work that lawyers
used to do: researching cases, interviewing witnesses and clients, writing
reports and legal documents — just about everything but appearing in court.
You get to do that without needing a bachelor’s degree plus three expensive
years of law school. The most you’ll have to do is a four-year program, and
many firms hire graduates of one- or two-year programs. Job-market damp-
ener: An excess of lawyers is resulting in their being hired as paralegals.

Administrative Law Judge/Hearing Officer. This is a relatively easy way
to become a judge, but you still usually must be a well-connected attorney.
The difference from the more familiar kind of judge is that administrative law
judges rule on the laws and regulations of public agencies, and the process is
more informal. Typical role: A school district offers a child with learning diffi-
culties a special class, but the parents want the district to pay for a special

Public Relations/Communications Specialist. I held the stereotypical
view of public relations people — sleazebags — until I wrote my first book. In
my heart, I believed it deserved to be read, but how was I to get it noticed
among the 60,000 other books that were published that year? That made me
realize that publicists can serve an honorable purpose. Publicist is actually
only one specialization within the public relations field. Public relations types
also develop corporate images consonant with community values, promote
anyone from rock star to seminar leader, and of course, do damage control. I
recall that when the Oakland (CA) Unified School District school board decided
to mandate Ebonics (Black English dialect) for its students, a national firestorm
erupted. Then the district hired a public relations firm, and its message was
clarified (some say sanitized), and the storm blew over. That’s the bad part of
PR. You’re often a spin doctor, and you’re perceived that way.
If you want to be a self-employed PR person, specialize — for example, in
books, arts nonprofits, toy companies, or shareholder communications. Key
skills include the ability to come up with clever ideas quickly and in quantity
and pitch them compellingly — verbally and in writing — to the media.
Bonus: Many PR people get to go to cool parties attended by the media and
glitterati. My vote for the most effective publicity stunt ever? When IBM
pitted its Big Blue computer against chess superstar Garry Kasparov. Public

(Neat Niche) Public Relations for Travel and Tourism. Paul Plawin, in
Careers for Travel Buffs, writes, “In order to write about the delights of the
Doral Beach Spa in Miami Beach, a Royal Caribbean Cruise, the beaches of
the Bahamas, the fun and frivolity of Southern California, or the fjords of
Alaska, public relations people must visit those destinations.” Definitely a
neat niche. Public Relations Society of America’s Travel PR section: www.

Awards Entrepreneur. Tiffany Schlain decided to give out awards for the
best Web sites and turned it into a big business, the Webbys, with money
earned from contestant entry fees and awards ceremony ticket fees. She even
charges honorees for their award statues and framed certificates! There are
contests and awards in countless fields: from blogs and vlogs (the Bloggies and
Vloggies, of course) to new car quality (JD Power) to screenwriting (dozens
of those contests — screenwriters are desperate to put “award winner” on
their resume). Yet, the market for awards isn’t saturated. For example, you may
set up local analogs to the Tony Awards for your region’s best community
theater actors, directors, and plays. If you don’t make enough money from
one such enterprise, do a few. The Webby Awards: www.webbyawards.com.
Personal Historian/Biographer. So many parents ask their college student,
“What in the world are you going to do with a degree in history?” Well, tell
your parents about Ellie Kahn. Her firm, Living Legacies, produces custom-
ordered histories of individuals, families, and historical buildings. She’s com-
piled 80 histories in book, video, or audio format. I’m not surprised that she’s
successful. Most people are egocentric. Deep down, most people would love
to have a book written about them, but how do you turn that into a business?
You can contact famous people who are in need of a boost. Offer to write their
biography. When they agree, write a book proposal and find a literary agent
to peddle it for you. Just plain folks may also want their stories recorded as
personal legacies for future generations. Or someone may want a biography
of his aging parent or a volume that tells his family history. Market through
genealogy societies, senior centers, reunion planners, or by placing ads in
upscale community newspapers. To avoid putting in too many hours for too
little money, I recommend this model: Create the video by doing an hour’s
interview with each of one to four protagonists and editing it into a 15-minute
DVD, with professional-looking titles, dissolves, and background music.

Foreign Service Officer. Imagine working in the United States embassy or
consulate in one of 250 foreign countries (the government’s choice —
Afghanistan or Zimbabwe, perchance?). Your first job may include helping
poor souls who lost their passports, but things usually get more interesting.
Your job may include keeping abreast of political and economic conditions so
that you can brief American policymakers. Or you may arrange cocktail parties
for business and political leaders of your host country. A cool career, but here’s
the rub: Eight thousand people apply for the 200 openings each year. Better
be a good reader and writer, and have a knack for learning a foreign language
in six months — and another language two years later. Urdu, anyone? Wikipedia

Foreign Language Interpreter/Translator. Millions of hours of Al-Qaeda
conversations had been intercepted but weren’t translated until after 9/11
because of the shortage of translators and interpreters. (Translators work
with the written word; interpreters translate speech.) But you needn’t speak
Arabic to have good career prospects. Ever-more immigrants are entering the
medical and court systems while U.S. firms are importing or outsourcing to
ever-more Asian scientists, engineers, and computer programmers. The most
in-demand languages are Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Japanese,
French, and German. Good money is possible if you specialize. Security, med-
ical, legal, and engineering interpreting are good bets.
No matter what your niche, it helps if you’re both bilingual and bicultural —
understanding both cultures enables you to translate the nuances. The largest
employer of interpreters and translators: the federal government, the United
Nations, and the Organization of American States. Perk: lots of all-expense-paid
travel, but often on a moment’s notice. Risk: Instant translation software is get-
ting better and better (for example, try the free demo at www.systransoft.
com). Within five years, software may be good enough to put many if not most
human translators and even interpreters out of a job. American Translators
Association: www.atanet.org.
(Neat Niche) Translation. Translating written material is less stressful
than language interpreting on the fly because you have time to think or,
heaven forbid, look up a word in the dictionary. Plus, the work hours are
more normal. Unlike translators, interpreters must attend events wherever
or whenever they occur. Favorite subniches: translating film scripts, Web
sites, and software.
Court Reporter. Picture a court reporter. Chances are, you’re envisioning
someone in a courtroom pressing keys on a stenotype machine. In fact, only
one-fourth of court reporters do that. Most work for attorneys, creating tran-
scripts of out-of-court depositions. Others record the proceedings of govern-
ment hearings. Still others provide the captioning now required for much live
TV. Too, the Americans with Disabilities Act now mandates that all hearing-
impaired college students, at no-cost, are entitled to be accompanied to all
classes by a court reporter to provide real-time translation. Thanks to voice-
recognition software, many court reporters can forgo the stenotype machine
in favor of simply talking into a computer. That enables them to be hired with
less than a year of training, or even by learning on the job. However, record-
ing 225 words per minute using stenotype machines (mandated for hiring by
the federal government and still preferred in many courts) requires an aver-
age of 33 months of training. Besides training, the good court reporter must
have excellent listening skills and good vocabulary, grammar, and punctua-
tion. They must also be perfectionists; for example, judicial appeals often
depend on the court reporter’s transcript. National Court Reporters
Association: www.ncraonline.org.

Regulation Compliance Consultant. When a law or regulation changes, it
can mean an opportunity for entrepreneurs. For example, a few years back,
North Carolina decided to require all high school students to take an earth
science course. Well, many of the state’s teachers had never taught earth sci-
ence, so an enterprising woman contacted the state’s education department
and got to provide earth science training workshops for teachers all across
North Carolina. Every time you hear of a new law or regulation, ask yourself,
“Does that create an opportunity for me?” Quiz: The U.S. Postal Service
recently announced that in 2010, it plans to remove thousands of those blue
mailboxes on the street. Does that offer a business opportunity? Here’s one:
Bid as a contractor that removes the mailboxes. Then sell them on eBay as,
for example, childproof garbage cans or even just as “future antiques.”
Work with Things and People
Interior Designer. What fun! Helping people figure out how to make their
homes or offices beautiful and functional. And you get to go on shopping
sprees. Trouble is, if you expect to make a living, the job usually requires
much more than shopping: reading blueprints, creating estimates for com-
mercial and residential projects, developing mockups using computer-aided
design (CAD) systems, and knowing whether you can knock down a wall with-
out the building collapsing. In short, you’re somewhere between a decorator
and an architect. Interior decorators often practice without credentials, but
interior designers must have a bachelor’s degree, and to get the respected
American Society of Interior Designers certification, must know building codes

enters a building’s lobby and can’t easily figure out how to get to the bathroom
or the elevator, then back to the lobby, you’ve got a problem.” Side benefit:

Home Stager. This is a well-paying career for artistic types without much
artistic talent. When a homeowner decides to sell, he’s willing to invest some
bucks to make the house look its best. Stagers come to the house to recom-
mend moving and removing furniture and decorations. (“That stuffed moose
head simply must go!”) They also suggest low-cost improvements, such as
painting one wall a dramatic color to enliven a nondescript room. Because the
home seller stands to make big bucks, these one-day decorators can earn good
money, and although it’s an artistic career, staging doesn’t require a Rembrandt.
Information: www.stagedhomes.com. HGTV’s book: Designed to Sell.
Landscape Architect. A landscape architect’s projects can be mundane,
like designing the spaces between buildings in an industrial park or building
an artificial pond in a homeowner’s backyard. Or they can be exotic like
designing the landscapes of resorts, golf courses, zoos, urban plazas, col-
leges, cemeteries, landmark monuments, wetlands, or scenic highways. For
example, landscape architects designed the U.S. Capitol grounds, preserved
Yosemite Park, and created Boston’s “Emerald Necklace” of green spaces tying
the city to the suburbs. Because most landscape architecture projects don’t
have as many components as designing a building, young landscape architects,
unlike building architects, may more quickly get to design entire projects. Also,
the training is shorter: You typically can get a job with just a bachelor’s degree
and an internship of a year or less. One downside: Landscape architects are
subject to an ever-growing thicket of environmental regulations — you’re more
likely to stay calm if you’re an ardent environmentalist. American Society of
Landscape Architects: www.asla.org. Nicholas Dines’s book, Landscape
Architect’s Portable Handbook.
Garden Designer. Many people allow their yards to decline into the too-
natural look. Sure, you can hire a garden-variety gardener, but she doesn’t
have design skills. Landscape architects have design skills, but you may need a
second mortgage to afford one. Enter what I call the Garden Doctor. She makes
house calls and performs transplants. Armed with a laptop and software like
Better Homes and Gardens Home Designer Pro 7.0, the Garden Doctor and
client can design the perfect Eden right there onscreen without lifting a
shovel. When the design is just right, the homeowner can do the job or con-
tract with the Garden Doctor. Association of Professional Landscape Designers:

Home Inspector. Buying a home can be love at first sight, but love is often
blind. Enter the home inspector, whose job is to help the blind to see. No sur-
prise, you’ll need to know how to assess the soundness of a home’s wiring,
plumbing, heating, building materials, and so on. Market your service to local
real estate agents, perhaps by giving lectures at local Board of Realtor meet-
ings titled “How to Keep an Inspection from Killing the Deal.” American Society
of Home Inspectors: www.ashi.com. National Association of Certified Home
Inspectors: www.nachi.org.
Home Remodeling Contractor. This is one of the construction industry’s
most rewarding jobs. Typically, you help design the project, bid the job, hire the
workers, and keep a nice percentage of what you charge, without ever getting
your hands dirty. Neat niches: green remodeling, converting buildings for use
by computer-intensive tenants, upgrading biotech labs, home offices, green-
houses, and additions for elder relatives. National Association of the Remodeling
Industry: www.nari.org. Building Online: www.buildingonline.com.
Athletic Team Trainer. Suddenly a player goes down. You race out onto the
field and must make an instant evaluation: How bad? Do we need the stretcher?
A doctor? You don’t want to overreact — the player, the team, and the fans
want to see her play again, or at least walk off the field, but of course, better
safe than sorry. The athletic trainer’s key skill is decision making. He also has
important decisions to make before and after the game. For example, an injured
athlete is dying to play again. The doctor has given the okay, but as you tape
up the player, you notice him wincing. What should you do? Other interesting
parts of the job: developing conditioning programs for the team and rehab regi-
mens for injured athletes and motivating them to implement those programs.
And there’s more. Michael O’Shea, a trainer at the University of Louisville,
explains, “The trainer is a 24-hour father confessor.” Training jobs for sports
teams are tough to land, but there’s growth at corporate fitness centers.
National Athletic Trainers’ Association: www.nata.org.
Dentist. It’s a myth that you must be excellent with your hands to be a good
dentist. Studies find that an average person can develop the hands-on skills.
You do, however, need a good back. Many dentists develop back problems
from constantly leaning over patients. And dentistry is stressful. It’s no fun to
see patients flinch (hopefully, not writhe) in response to your gentle touch. A
major upside compared with other medical professions is that you cure most
patients’ problems. Plus, it’s one of the few medical professions left in which
127
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

self-employment remains a viable option. And there are neat niches. American
Dental Association: www.ada.org. Jeffrey May’s book: The Art and Science of
Being a Dentist.
(Neat Niche) Cosmetic Dentist. Help turn yellowed, cracking teeth into
movie-star whites. Much more pleasant than having to tell unsuspecting
patients, “I’m sorry, we have to do a root canal.” Bonus: Only minimal
extra training is required. American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry:
www.aacd.com.
(Neat Niche) Veterinary Dentist. You knock Fido out before starting, so
there’s no flinching (or biting) to stress you out. Also, it’s a nonimpacted
(pun intended) field. Academy of Veterinary Dentistry: www.avdonline.org.
Dental Hygienist. More than just cleaning your teeth, a dental hygienist
takes and develops X-rays and administers anesthesia. In some states,
hygienists even examine patients who are unable to come to the dentist’s
office. And, of course, part of their job is to show you ugly pictures of dis-
eased gums to guilt-trip you into flossing more and rinsing with Listerine.
Dental hygienists must take precautions to avoid repetitive strain injuries
and back pain. American Dental Hygienists’ Association: www.adha.org.
Surgical Technologist. Just a bachelor’s degree, sometimes quite a bit less,
and you can play a role in the life-and-death drama of the operating room.
The surgical technologist preps the patient (I remember having my chest
shaved before my appendectomy. Not fun!), provides emotional support (I
definitely needed that), and gets the surgical tools and machines ready in the
operating room. During the operation, when the surgeon calls, “Sutures! Clamp!
Retractor!” or any of those things they yell for on ER, the surgical technologist
is the one being yelled at. According to the Department of Labor, surgical
technology is a fast-growing field. Association of Surgical Technologists:
www.ast.org.
Cardiovascular Technologist. Heart disease is the number one cause of
death in the United States and is the leading reason that men die six years
earlier than women. The cardiology technologist plays a key role in diagnos-
ing the problem before it’s too late. The range of diagnostic tools has advanced
well beyond the traditional electrocardiogram. Cardiovascular techs have a
stressful job, especially if they’re assisting in heart catheterization — an inva-
sive but accurate test for heart blockages. It helps to have a knack for calming
people down. Alliance of Cardiovascular Professionals: www.acp-online.org.
Dispensing Optician. This job is a nice blend: part technical, part people.
You help customers pick out the frames that make them look sexy, intellec-
tual, whatever. You then take some measurements — for example, the dis-
tance between the patient’s pupils so the lenses can be made the correct
128
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

distance from each other. Then you make the actual glasses, grinding over-
sized lenses until they fit. In states where opticians are licensed, you can
make a reasonable living. The growth is in the chains like Wal-Mart. Most
opticians are trained on the job or by apprenticeship. Optician Career:
www.careeroverview.com/optician-career.html.
Massage Therapist. This is one of the few careers in which nearly every
customer is extremely satisfied. The best massage therapists are not only
wonderful with their hands but also demonstrate a sense of caring. Training
is short, typically 500 hours, but be sure to enroll in a program accredited 
by the Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation (www.comta.org).
Downsides: You’re on your feet all day doing physical work, and there is risk
of repetitive strain injury. American Massage Therapy Association: www.amta
massage.org. Martin Ashley’s Book: Massage, A Career at Your Fingertips.
(Neat Niche) Corporate Massage. A corporate massage therapist is a
stress buster who gives in-chair (or on a massage table in the conference
room) massages to employees. Massage has been called the new coffee
break. How do you convince tightwad employers to hire you? You might
say, “No perk costs less and increases morale more. And your company is
seen as benevolent, which can boost sales and make it easier to attract
quality employees.” Some employers are going halfsies: they pay half, the
employee pays half. Sounds like a deal to me, but at least one employer isn’t
at ease with on-site massage. The IRS office in San Jose offered on-site mas-
sage to its employees (ah, our tax dollars at work), but there was a problem:
the sound. The IRS’s Morgan Banks explains, “You can’t have taxpayers
coming into an audit hearing ‘oohs’ and ‘ahhs.’ Now we’re looking for a
room with thicker walls.” Infinite Massage: www.infinitemassage.com.
Barber/Hairstylist. There’s no way to avoid an occasional bad hair day, but
hairstylist keep them to a minimum. Your job is to consult with your client on
style — perhaps urging that cool new look you saw at the latest trade show
Then, you cut, color, perm, and otherwise torture the person’s hair into
beauty — natural looking, of course. If beauty ain’t gonna happen, there’s
always a hairpiece. And in any case, you can offer a bit of pampering — for
example, a facial or shave. You do all of this while chatting away. Don’t like
chitchat? This career isn’t for you. At the end of each session, you may want
to push some of those mousses, gels, and sprays because a big part of your
income comes from selling product. Almost half of hairstylists own their own
salon, but increasing numbers rent space in others’ salons, day spas, resort
spas, department stores, or residential care homes. Downsides to this career:
You’re on your feet eight hours a day and often work evenings and weekends.
Too, there’s a risk of repetitive strain injury and tight shoulder muscles. One
thing you needn’t worry about: that your job will be offshored. They would
need awfully long scissors to cut your hair from Mumbai. J. Elaine Spear’s
book: Haircutting For Dummies.

Cosmetologist/Makeup Artist. A fun job, making people look attractive
while chatting with them. And training is short. Although most cosmetolo-
gists don’t get rich, some, like my sister, do just fine. Sandy always loved
putting makeup on others, so she learned everything she could about it, and
went to a manufacturer who put Sandy’s brand name on ready-made cosmet-
ics. Then, Sandy opened a store called Let’s Make Up. There, she did free
makeovers and showed people how to do it themselves. When the women saw
how good they looked, they usually bought fistfuls of the stuff. Within two
years, Sandy was making fistfuls of money. National Cosmetology Association:

book: The Business of Beauty.
(Neat Niche) Special Effects Makeup Artist. How’d you like a career
making up puppets and creature masks? According to the Hollywood
Reporter, “Since 1992, membership in the Los Angeles Makeup Artists and
Hairstylists Union has increased by more than 50 percent. There are 720
people working in this field and their handiwork is in demand like never
before. . . . “ Michael Westmore, makeup supervisor at Paramount for the
Star Trek series, says that he’s never seen anything like the latest bull
market: “I’ve hired over 80 people myself.” But not everyone’s a bull. One
insider warned that computer technology is replacing a lot of what special
effects makeup artists do. Janus Vinther’s book: Special Effects Make-Up.

“We are seeking candidates with three years in cosmetology, theatrical

(Neat Niche) Wedding Makeup Artist. Many brides hire a pro to ensure the
bridal party looks luminous, not just for the ceremony, but for the zillion
photographs that immortalize that one-of-a-kind (hopefully) day. The camera
often requires that you wear special makeup to avoid looking washed out.

Fashion Designer. “Next year, I think our line of children’s swimsuits should
use more tricot in earth tones. Parents are tired of cutesy. For a change, we
might also try a loose fit. Here’s a sketch of a couple of designs. If you like 
any of them, I’ll cut a few samples. Maybe we could try them out at our sales
meeting or at a fashion show.” That’s the life of the fashion designer. This is
another of those careers in which there are few jobs, but colleges admit zillions
of students. Most people often think of designers focusing on haute couture,
but they may have a better chance of landing a job if they pick an under-the-
radar niche such as uniforms, children’s swimwear, or hospital garb. (Wanna

don’t think of this niche, so it isn’t quite as crowded. Jennie Bev’s e-book,
Breaking Into and Succeeding as a Handbag Designer: www.stylecareer.
com/handbag_designer.shtml.
Photographer. As with most artistic careers, to be successful, you must be
both talented and a willing and able marketer. Photographer Dennis Miller
says, “Photography is 75 percent sales — if you’re very talented; 95 percent 
if you’re not.” To be competitive, a photographer must be expert at using
Photoshop to edit digital images and at using the Web for sales and market-
ing. About.com’s photography portal: photography.about.com. Professional
Photographers of America: www.ppa.com. Rohn Engh’s books: How to Sell &
Resell Your Photos, and SellPhotos.com. Donna Poehner’s book: Photographer’s
Market.
(Neat Niche) Newborn Photographer. It amazes me that life’s most awe-
inspiring event, childbirth and the day after, is rarely photographed pro-
fessionally. Try to get a hospital director to grant you the exclusive right 
to offer photographic services to expectant parents who will be giving
birth at the hospital. A birth photographer’s Web site: www.mother-birth.
com/Birth%20Photography.htm.
(Neat Niche) Government Photographer. Government work can be an island
of security in the photographer’s tempestuous sea, infamous for irregular
employment and low pay. The feds may hire you to take aerial photographs.
Law enforcement agencies hire forensic photographers: “Did that piece of
headlight come from a suspect’s car?” Enhanced photographs of evidence
can tell the tale.
(Neat Niche) Industrial Photographer. This is another photography job
that’s potentially stable. Plus, you get to work with top-of-the-line equipment.
A downside is that the work is unlikely to quench your thirst for artistic
expression. A typical project: taking photos of a prototype at each stage in
its development. An industrial photographer’s site: www.proshooter.com.
(Neat Niche) Photojournalist. As periodicals try to stay competitive, they
use more photos. The job market is still tight, but if you have expertise in
digital photography and postproduction, this rewarding job may be a bit
easier to land than in years past. A relatively easy entry point: small-market
or specialty publications, such as a local sports monthly. National Press
Photographers Association: www.nppa.org.

(Neat Niche) Lithograph Cameraperson. You use computers and cameras
to lay out magazines and mail-order catalogs. With so much media moving
to the Web, it’s easy to ignore such publications, but they’re still large
businesses and, because of the higher quality possible in print, are excel-
lent places to showcase fine photography.
(Neat Niche) School Photographer. Taking headshots of 100 kids a day
isn’t the most creative work in the world, but plenty of customers are out
there. At many schools, picture taking is an annual event. One of my
clients takes a more creative approach to school photography: She takes
close-up action photos of varsity team members and sells them to the
proud parents. Another plus for school photography is that, unlike most
photography niches, your evenings and weekends are free. Professional
School Photographers Association International: www.pmai.org/
sections/pspa.htm.
(Neat Niche) Pet Photographer. People love their pets, sometimes as
much as their kids. I really enjoy looking at the photo of my dog’s head
lying in a teddy bear’s lap. I recommend taking a very low-cost approach
to marketing a pet photography biz: Create an 81⁄2-x-11-inch ad filled with
your best pet photos. To it, attach a pad of tear-off discount coupons.
Mount the ads on stand-up cardboard easels. Place them near the cash
register in vet’s offices, pet supply stores, pet stores, and pet adoption
facilities. Or rent a booth at dog shows. Owners of purebred show
animals are especially proud of their pets. (I prefer to get my pets from
the pound or rescue organization: hybrid vigor, plus I feel I’m saving a
life.) Portal to articles on pet photography: www.animalpetsand
friends.com/Category/Pet-Photography/68. Pet Pix: www.pet
pix.com.
(Neat Niche) Real Estate Photographer. Increasingly, properties for sale —
from home to factory — are in full view on the Net, with a 24/7 virtual open
house, full of photographs. Someone’s gotta take those pictures. Could it
be you? The cutting edge: a full-motion video house tour. Example: www.
surroundpix.com.au.
(Neat Niche) Annual Report Photographer. Every public company,
mutual fund, and investment company is required to produce an annual
report. The successful firms usually opt for spartan reports, but the ones
hungry for business make a glitzy full-color magazine filled with, you
guessed it, photographs. How to get gigs? Two-thirds of the work comes
out of New York. Send your portfolio to each company’s investor relations

Accident Reconstructor. “It was his fault. He ran right into me!” It’s the job
of the accident reconstructor to find out whether he’s lying through his teeth.
Using photographs of the crime scene, statements from drivers and witnesses,
knowledge of the physics of what is and isn’t possible, and computer simula-
tions, accident reconstructors learn the truth. Accident Reconstruction
Network: www.accidentreconstruction.com.
Business Equipment Broker/Lessor. More people are starting businesses,
and because new businesses often fail, more people will be ending their busi-
nesses. Business equipment brokers profit from both. They lease to new busi-
nesses and buy used equipment from companies going bust. And of course,
they handle upgrades. As technology advances ever faster, rather than buy,
many businesses prefer to lease the latest model, and in two years, lease the
next-generation one. Equipment Leasing Association: www.elaonline.com.
Firefighter. All the firefighters I’ve met like their jobs. Disadvantages such
as irregular hours and living in a firehouse are usually outweighed by the
exciting, rewarding work of responding to emergencies and helping people.
Plus, typically, only a high school diploma or perhaps a two-year fire science
degree is required. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, firefighting
ranks 14th in likelihood of dying on the job. That seems daunting, but num-
bers 1 and 2 are truck driver and farm worker, careers most people don’t
think of as inordinately death-inducing. International Association of Fire
Fighters: www.iaff.org. Steve Delsohn’s book: The Fire Inside: Firefighters

Golf Course Superintendent. Where do we put that new bunker? How do
we schedule the groundskeepers? What’s the best way to keep those greens
perfect without using too much water or chemicals? To answer those questions,
every golf course has a superintendent. This is another cool career that does-
n’t require a bachelor’s degree: A two-year degree in turfgrass management
will do. Golf Course Superintendents Association of America: www.gcsaa.org.
Park Ranger. People think this is the career for shy souls who spend their
lives alone, searching through binoculars for forest fires. Granted a few of
those are around, but most park rangers spend lots of time with people —
preaching the environmentalist gospel or pestering park patrons, “Do you
have a fishing license?” “No dogs allowed,” and “I’m going to have to ask you
(drunken fool) to leave the campground.” A park ranger’s first job is usually
filled with physically demanding tasks, such as shoring up eroding paths.
Jobs, albeit low-paying ones to start, are available in national, and especially
in state and regional, parks. Insider’s secret: Job seekers overlook jobs on
federal lands other than parks. Check out national forests, wilderness areas,
wildlife refuges, and scenic rivers. Good-paying administrative park jobs are
133

the job is — nothing is better than a life in the wilderness. Park Ranger Career
Site: www.angelfire.com/realm2/parkrangers/home.html.
Sports Referee/Umpire. I loved being an umpire. It was fun making a deci-
sion every few seconds that was respected — usually. Somehow, even getting
booed wasn’t so bad — when I was able to remind myself that in the larger
scheme of things, it didn’t matter whether it was a ball or a strike. And as a
sports fan, umpiring was a way to be a part of the game even if I wasn’t a great
ballplayer. Don’t count on making full-time money as an ump. Sure, Major
League Baseball umpires and National Basketball Association referees make
six figures, but for most high school and college refs, officiating is a sideline,
as much for the fun as for the money. There are perks, though. You get to
travel and, in sports such as basketball or soccer, it’s a fun way to stay in
shape. And demand is high. You, however, need skills: competent decision
making under pressure and the ability to stay cool when coaches and fans yell
in your face. Referee/Umpire Homepage: www.gmcgriff.com/refonline.

Stunt Person. Ready to dive from a cruise ship into a frigid ocean? How
about getting set on fire? Leaping from a tall building? If so, maybe you’d like
to be a stunt person. Be sure your health insurance is in place. Most of the
“gags” that pay well don’t just look dangerous, they are. The risk doesn’t
deter aspirants; competition is fierce for stunt jobs. You usually need to be
quite an athlete and well trained. One training school, Stunts Are Us, is located
in, of all places, Kenosha, Wisconsin: www.stuntsareus.org. Another school
is the United Stuntsmen’s Association Stunt School: www.stuntschool.com.
First step, though, for a career in which you swing from nooses and tumble down
stairs is to read Jack Bucklin’s book: Stuntman.
Work with Things and Data
Engineer. This is a career for math and science junkies who like to solve
practical problems, usually by designing an object. Perhaps it’s a snowboard
that turns better, a way for diabetics to take insulin without injections, or a
hydrogen-powered car. Turnover is low, although twice as many women leave
the profession. The engineering major is long, grueling, and often irrelevant.
One engineer I met, who works for General Dynamics, told me that 95 percent
of what he learned in college — a prestigious one — was irrelevant to his work.
Engineering is among the highest-paid, most in-demand, bachelor’s level
careers, but more companies are offshoring engineering work to low-cost

(Neat Niche) Hardware Engineer. Your job is to design and produce elec-
tronic devices. You may, for example, design the wireless module for the
next-generation iPhone, a computer chip for a robot that enables a world-
class surgeon to do brain surgery on a patient halfway around the globe,
or the procedure for mass producing that chip. No way around it, you have
to be smart for this career, know a lot of science and math, and have the
knack of solving hard problems thrown at you left and right. For example,
when you’re designing a new chip, a million unexpected problems come
up — after all, you’re charting new territory. Through it all, you have to
communicate well, orally and in writing, to tease out what your bosses
really want, fight with them if you think they’re nuts, and coordinate with
your teammates. After you develop your widget, you help create documen-
tation and training that ensures that users can actually use it. Institute of

(Neat Niche) Telecommunications Engineer. The Olympics are seen
instantly around the world. A paralyzed person talks, and a computer types
his words as fast as he can speak. You check your e-mail while on the toilet.
The hero? Telecommunications engineers. What’s next? Soon, your cell-
phone will respond to your voice commands to send to your friends (and

(www.lockheed.com) has already built 1,000 spacecrafts and clocked
1,500 years of on-orbit performance. Many people think that spacecraft
engineering mainly involves designing the vehicle itself. Actually, the main
work is designing the thousands of computer programs needed to drive

(Neat Niche) Flying Car Developer. It’s absurd that the best idea trans-
portation planners have for coping with gridlock is to simply stop building
roads, thereby forcing people into mass transit that no matter how
expanded, will greatly inhibit their freedom of movement. A solution: a
flying car. Don’t laugh. It vastly increases the area on which people can
drive — without spending a dime on freeway construction. Think it’s sci-
ence fiction? At least one flying car already exists (see www.moller.com).
And it’s radar-controlled to help ensure that vehicles don’t hit anything.
60 Minutes, the Wall Street Journal, and ABC News have done features on it.
(Neat Niche) Nonpolluting Car Developer. Whether or not you’re a high-
powered engineer, working to develop an environmentally clean car, prob-
ably using hydrogen fuel cells, may involve you in an effort that could save
the planet. EVWorld: www.evworld.com.
Engineering Technician. Your job is to assist an engineer in designing and
developing products. For example, you may test and troubleshoot electrical
and computer systems or work on a survey party, calculating land areas, esti-
mating costs, and inspecting construction projects. A two-year degree in engi-
neering technology is the norm. In choosing to be an engineering technologist
rather than a full-fledged engineer, you trade some prestige for a shorter
training, and still often end up with an interesting job. American Society of
Certified Engineering Technicians: www.ascet.org.
Patent Agent. You get to do everything a patent lawyer does except appear
in court. Sam invented a gadget that opens jars more easily and wants to
patent it. Your job is first to assess whether it’s really new enough to justify a
patent. If so, you draft a patent application to the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. It describes, in words and pictures, how the new invention is different
from anything that preceded it. People will always want to patent their inno-
vations to protect their rights, and the position can’t be automated, so there
should always be a need for patent agents. A background in science or engi-
neering is almost a requirement. How to Become a Patent Agent: inventors.

Inventor. Sixty thousand kids a year are treated in hospitals for trampoline-
related injuries. So Mark Publicover invented JumpSport (www.jumpsport.
com), which provides 360-degree protection around standard-sized trampolines.
JumpSport is now sold in thousands of outlets. How does an invention get
invented? It can start by asking yourself: “What’s annoying?” and “What could
I invent that would solve the problem?” Inventors, mostly engineering types,
usually develop their prototypes as an after-work spice to their corporate or
137
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

government day jobs. How to do it successfully? You needn’t build the proto-
type yourself. Find a model maker (www.modelmakers.org has a directory).
Then test your prototype on potential customers and retailers. If it passes
muster, find out what it would cost to manufacture — use the Thomas
Manufacturing Register of 160,000 manufacturers to find a manufacturer
(www.thomasregister.com). Is it cheap enough to allow ample profit?
Have them make a small run and distribute it through trade shows,
a Web site, or wholesale to retailers. Or try to get a corporation to buy
(and not steal) your invention. (See an intellectual property lawyer first.)
Avoid services that promise to take your idea and turn it into a moneymaker.
They usually aren’t worth it. Inventors’ Digest: www.inventorsdigest.com.

Industrial Designer. Your alarm clock goes off. You flail to find the snooze
button, to no avail. Industrial designers try to design better ones. Your cell-
phone can do all sorts of things, but you can’t figure out how to make it work.
An industrial designer is trying to make it idiot-proof. Your Prius looks cool.
Thank an industrial designer. Good news: To be an industrial designer, you
needn’t be an engineer or an excellent artist. Industrial designers aren’t the
engineers; they work with engineers. And although it helps if you can draw,
it’s as important that you care deeply about how products are made, look,
and feel. The rest can usually be taught. Top training institutions: Carnegie
Mellon, Rhode Island School of Design, and Art Center College of Design (CA).

(Neat Niche) Packaging Designer. Your company wants to introduce a new
shampoo. Dozens of brands already are on supermarket shelves. Your job
is to design the bottle so shoppers are compelled to pick yours. Working
with graphic artists, marketers, and accountants, you design the most
compelling packaging possible within budget. Packaging Design Magazine:

(Neat Niche) Toy Designer/Inventor. Sounds simple, but toy design,
more than most careers, requires you to have expertise in many fields.
You have to be enough of a developmental psychologist to know what
sorts of activities will stimulate a 7-year-old. You must be enough of an
artist to create something beautiful. You must be imaginative enough to
think of all the ways a toy can break or be unsafe. You must be enough
of an engineer to design a product that is both cool and that will work —
even if Junior drops it. Next time you pick up a toy, have a little more
respect for its designer. About.com’s toy design and invention portal:

Broadcast Technician/Broadcast Engineer. This is a back door into a
field whose front entrance is mobbed. And you don’t even need performing
talent. Broadcast technologists operate and maintain the recording equip-
ment in radio stations, TV studios, and on remotes. An utterly nonrandom
example is going to Hawaii to cover the Aloha Bowl. The bad news is that you
must often work nights and weekends, and the pay can stink. Training is less
than a year at a private technical school or a bit longer at a community col-
lege. But there’s an alternative. The broadcast engineer at my radio station
told me that in decades past, techie teens would, like groupies, hang out at
radio stations to learn broadcast engineering. Now, few do, perhaps because
most teens view radio as passé. That leaves an opportunity for you. Society of
Broadcast Engineers: www.sbe.org. About.com’s radio portal: radio.about.

(Neat Niche) Webcasting Technician. It’s already happening. Hundreds 
of radio stations make their shows available live or archived on the Net.
This cool career will likely expand, and by the time you’re reading this,
video-compression technology and fatter-piped Internet access should
mean that you’ll be able to — on your computer or even cellphone —
watch your favorite TV shows, movies, even that rare footage of Albert
Einstein holding forth in his lab, whenever you want. There should be
great demand for technicians who know how to make it all happen.

Cartographer. That’s the fancy word for mapmaker. Although you still need
some drawing skills, this is yet another field that’s been revolutionized by the
computer. New maps are often of remote areas, only now accurately map-
pable thanks to computer interpretation of aerial or satellite data. Rendering,
too, is done on computer, using, for example, AutoCAD. Cartographers may
also map seascapes to identify coral reefs, or create drainage maps to help
farmers plan irrigation. They even develop video games — you know, the
ones with 37 labyrinthine floors filled with dungeons and monsters. American
Congress of Surveying and Mapping: www.survmap.org. GoogleEarth: www.

Enologist. Want to make wine for a living? A bachelor’s degree and intern-
ships during crush time in wineries provide the preparation. Alas, only a few
colleges offer a major in enology. The best-known program is at the University
of California, Davis. American Society of Enology and Viticulture: www.asev.
org. Pascal Ribéreau-Gayon’s book: Handbook of Enology.

Brewer. Don’t like wine? How about beer? Although I’m not sure the craft
brewing fad will last, beer drinking will. Don’t think the job is mainly tasting.
It’s part chemistry, part management, and okay, part tasting. About.com’s
portal to information on beer: beer.about.com. Master Brewers Association:
www.mbaa.com.
Criminalist. He’s lying dead. Near the corpse lies a tiny white hair. The crim-
inalist picks it up. Under the microscope, it’s clear that it’s a pet hair. A visit
to three suspects’ homes finds that one of them has a pet whose hair matches
exactly. No, it’s not just a CSI episode. Real-life criminalists search crime scenes
to unearth physical evidence — a weapon, fingerprints, a clothing fiber, blood,
drugs, even vapors — and then perform tests to see whether they link the
suspect and the victim. It’s safer than a detective job because you usually
show up after the danger is over. Entry-level criminalists may need only a cer-
tificate or associate degree in forensics/criminalistics; biology or chemistry is
often an acceptable substitute. When you get bored with picking up stuff at
crime scenes, get a bachelor’s or master’s degree and you may get to do more
interesting work, like analyzing ballistics, fingerprints, arson, forgeries, and
crime patterns, to help the cops plan their strategy. American Society of
Criminology: www.asc41.com.
Historic Preservationist. America has hundreds of thousands of buildings
under the protection of the Landmarks Preservation Commission — 21,000 in
New York City alone. In many of these buildings, continuing efforts are made
to restore the property to its original state. That means hiring people who
can do research to find out what the building looked like way back when, and
who have the management skills and/or artistic ability to re-create it. Much of
this work is done on a volunteer basis, but a few jobs are available for the
eager and well trained. National Trust for Historic Preservation: www.national
trust.org.
Work with Things, People, and Words
Filmmaker/Director. What could sound cooler: “Hi, I’m a feature filmmaker”?
Beyond sounding cool, directing feature films is cool. You get to orchestrate
the telling of a story that you put in front of millions of viewers. And the
process is the ultimate in creativity and camaraderie, with you leading your
film crew, working intensely for months, and then it’s done — you can sit
back and watch your masterpiece and see the money roll in. What a dream!
Unfortunately, for 99.99 percent of aspiring filmmakers, it is only a dream.
Even many graduates of the top film schools (UCLA, USC, and NYU) end up
never earning enough even to pay back their student loans, let alone make a
subsistence living as a filmmaker. Nevertheless, if my daughter said, “Dad, I
140
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

want to be a filmmaker,” I wouldn’t discourage her — the prospect is just too
exciting. I’d feel that if she couldn’t make it as a filmmaker in Hollywood, she
could somehow make a living in some lesser Hollywood role or by directing
training videos. As important, she’d have acquired skills transferable to many
other careers. Worst case, in a few years, she’d have to read the next edition
of this book. The filmmaking portal: www.filmmaking.com.
Restaurant Menu Creator. There are countless restaurants, and each of
them needs a menu, many of which need to be changed periodically. Because
the menu is what the customer reads at the moment of truth — when deciding
how much to spend — an appealing menu design can mean big bucks to the
owner. So if you become an expert in menu design, you may be able to charge
amply for your services. Start by studying restaurant menus. Compendia are
available at hotel concierge desks, in the Entertainment Guide, and online. Lora
Arduser’s book: The Food Service Professionals Guide to Food Service Menus.

Curator. A museum exhibition begins with your idea. You then choose the
objects that best convey the idea and create an innovative way to install the
exhibit. Then you work to publicize it. In between exhibitions, you try to
acquire interesting stuff. You do all this in one of the more peaceful work
environments imaginable. Most curators major in an academic field, such as
art, history, archeology, or computer science, and then join a museum, zoo,
or college or government library in that field. To advance, you usually need a
master’s in library science. Museums are expensive to maintain, so to land a
good museum job, you usually must have business expertise (translation: an
MBA). American Association of Museums: www.aam-us.org. The Exhibitionists:
www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/maths.
Architect. When a filmmaker wants to create a character worthy of respect,
he often makes the person an architect. After all, architecture is an ideal
blend of art and science, creativity and logic. An architecture career also
seems exciting: designing a building and seeing it become a reality. Alas, most
architects spend many years before designing a building that actually gets
built. First, you have a five-year bachelor’s degree or a master’s. Then you
have a three-year internship. After that, many architects in firms must spend
years designing building components, like ensuring that the wiring meets
the requirements of Section 13.02.05 of the Springfield County Building Code.
A good architect must be an excellent communicator; someone who can
tease out what the client really wants and convince the Springfield County
Building Department that the wiring deserves a variance to Section 13.02.05.
He must also be a good project manager — a building is comprised of a thou-
sand headaches. Patience is beyond a virtue; it’s a necessity — the client
or the city is always changing something. One thing you needn’t be good at
is drawing, thanks to CAD programs, which are dominant in architecture.
141
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

An increasing amount of architecture is being offshored. So, moving forward,
successful architects need offshore-resistant skills: client relations, sales,
and macro project planning. About.com’s portal to info on architecture:

(Neat Niche) Green Architect. Some evidence suggests that inhabitants
are healthier in green buildings. Because those buildings make extensive
use of natural light, people in them feel better, and with careful material
choices for carpets and drapes, and good ventilation, people don’t cough
or scratch their eyes because of poor air quality. People feel better in
green buildings, not only because the materials are safer, but also because
they’re largely recyclable and energy efficient, so they feel like they’re
doing their part for the environment. About.com’s Green Architectural

Corporate Security Consultant. Corporations have always had a problem
with security, and not just with customers. Employee theft is an even greater
problem — for example, stealing client lists or proprietary technology. Now
with corporate property ever-shrinking (genes, microcircuits, formulas) and
surveillance technology ever-more sophisticated (such as software that cracks
encryption codes), the field of corporate security is, well, exploding. To suc-
ceed, specialize — in museums, hotels, or e-commerce sites, for example.

(Neat Niche) Violence Prevention/Resolution. Workplace violence is epi-
demic. More than 500,000 incidents of workplace violence occur each year.
Courts increasingly find that the lack of a thorough violence prevention/
intervention plan is evidence of liability if a worker assaults another worker.
This creates a job market for you. National Institute for the Prevention of
Workplace Violence: www.workplaceviolence911.com.
Business Home Economist. For years, women have been ridiculed for going
into home economics, so few do anymore. Finally, the need has exceeded
supply. Business home economists are used by manufacturers of large 
appliances to do demonstrations and by large department stores to suggest
what to buy and how to display it. Supermarket chains, food manufacturers,
142
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

and trade boards employ business home economists to prepare and present
information to consumers. The Egg Board, for example, may ask a business
home economist to develop a Web page showing how to prepare eggs without
unduly clogging your arteries. American Association of Family and Consumer
Sciences: www.aafcs.org.
A Guide to the Future
Being ahead of the curve can be key to your success. Think, for example, of
the people who got in on the ground floor of the automobile age, television,
rock ’n’ roll, or the Internet. What’s next?
Consider the megatrends in the following sections in choosing your career or
a business you want to start. These trends may also help you strategize
within your current career — for example, helping you or your employer
decide which directions to take. In addition, the 15 minutes it takes to read
this guide to the future should make you a more interesting conversationalist
and a more thoughtful observer of our ever-faster-changing society.
Of course, he who lives by the crystal ball eats broken glass, so, to mix
metaphors, take these predictions, indeed any predictions, with a grain or
two of salt.
Computers and technology
Personalization Nation. The latest Web applications (often dubbed Web
2.0) will yield an ever-more personalized approach to many things.
Some career implications:
 Marketing will be ever-more customized. As ever-more people shop on
the Net, data about individuals’ buying and voting tendencies will be
captured, and custom e-mail ads and commercials created. Experts in
personalized marketing will be in demand.
 Mass customization of clothing. We take for granted the ability to get
Dell to build us a computer with the precise specifications and options
we want. Clothing is next. Most people have experienced the frustration
of trying to find a piece of clothing they like, in the color and size they
want, that’s in stock. Soon, they’ll be able to go to an e-store, search the
styles to pick precisely what they want, enter their body’s measure-
ments, and in a few days, the customized garment will be at their front
143
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

door. Lands’ End already offers a first-generation version: see its Custom
Clothing section at www.landsend.com/custom. For more on mass
customization, see www.mass-customization.de.
 Networking will, more and more, move online because improved match-
ing paradigms will do a better job of hooking up compatible people. I
believe that companies such as match.com, MySpace, orkut, YouTube,
and LinkedIn will continue to grow, and therefore provide good opportu-
nities for employment. Activist organization moveon.org uses what I
believe will become a dominant approach to marketing: merging online
personalized marketing with online and in-person networking. For more
on online networking, see entrepreneurs.about.com/od/online
networking/Online_Business_Networking.htm.
 Medicine. By the end of the decade, you’ll start to see diagnoses and
treatment based on information about a person’s individual physiology.
This will cause an increase in biotech jobs. (See the later section “Health
and science” for more on biotech. For more on personalized medicine,
see www.personalizedmedicinecoalition.org.)
E-Populism. Until recently, corporate publishers almost completely con-
trolled what people bought: They hired editors to decide what topics to
cover and pick the person to write each piece. After publication, corporate-
owned periodical publishers chose one person to review each of what they
guessed were the top 1⁄1000 of new works. With contributions and judgments
made by so few people, it’s not surprising that publications too often didn’t
satisfy — haven’t we all paid for books, movies, and videogames that we
ended up disliking?
Things are changing. Using tools such as digital video cameras, video cell-
phones, blogs, videopodcasts, and improved editing software, ever-more
people can easily create and publish their radio show, illustrated article or 
e-book, news report, sitcom, film, or training video on the Net, thereby making
it available to the entire world. Then, the public’s collective wisdom evalu-
ates it: If your video gets high public ratings, it will get a zillion viewers on
GoogleVideo/youtube.com. If the public loves your article, it will be promi-
nently placed on digg.com and in the blogosphere. Today, the public can
rate everything from doctors (at, for example, healthgrades.com) to cars
(edmunds.com) to spas (yelp.com) to books (amazon.com) and other con-
sumer products (epinion.com).
Some career implications:
 Marketing professionals must become experts at figuring out how to get
consumers to rate products on those citizen-rating sites.
144
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

 Use mass collaboration. The most famous example is Wikipedia, the
online encyclopedia created and constantly upgraded by the public with
minimal editing. It turns out its quality is better than one may have
expected. A study reported in Nature magazine found that Wikipedia’s
science articles were about as accurate as those in the Encyclopedia
Britannica, the gold standard of reference books. So it’s not surprising
that corporate America is jumping on board the mass collaboration
bandwagon. For example, Procter and Gamble solicits public (paid) help
in developing 60 percent of its new products. GoldCorp paid $575,000 to
members of the public who helped figure out where to mine for gold.
Even federal intelligence agencies have created wikis (sites designed for
mass collaboration) to gather intelligence information from among their
employees. So, if you have expertise to share, search the Net for compa-
nies who want it. If you need expertise, solicit it on the Net. Sometimes,
you won’t even have to pay — many people love to solve challenges,
just for the heck of it. Why else would people climb Everest? As a job
seeker, the ability to start and maintain a wiki may put you ahead of the
competition. I believe mass collaboration and wikis will become a huge
aspect of Web 2.0.
 As ever-more people look to the Web for buying guidance, opportunities
will continue to grow at online rating services. Work for such companies
as Epinion, Digg, and Amazon, or create a site that offers ratings in a
niche likely to be ignored by those major players. Examples: medical
imaging machines, management training tools, political candidates,
eldercare services.
 The de-monetization of entertainment. Entertainment choices continue
to grow. For example, you can find the following:
• Ever-more appealing Web sites, such as youtube.com and
myspace.com
• Free or cheap downloads of every imaginable piece of music at
places like apple.com/itunes
• An attempt to make most of the world’s books available for free at
books.google.com
• Dozens of cable TV channels
• Video on demand (which will soon replace NetFlix and, of course,
the video rental store)
• Custom, RSS-fed, online “newspapers,” amalgamating content from
multiple sources
• Ever-more immersive video games (for example, the next genera-
tion of games will replace those hand-cramping game controllers
with eye-movement control)
145
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

All those entertainment choices mean that the public will be willing to
pay ever-less for them, and, in turn, cause a decline in salaries and the
number of jobs in the entertainment industry. Avoid this field. More than
ever, creative pursuits such as writing, filmmaking, and so on, should be
thought of as hobbies and not relied on for income, because now, anyone
can easily publish his article, artwork, book, or movie, and users can easily
find and access those works for free using google.com, youtube.com,
and so on. The odds of your making a living in such creative endeavors
are smaller than ever.
E-commerce finally triumphs. Web-based stores have long offered unbeat-
able advantages both to customers and store owners. The customer can
shop from the convenience of home, 24/7. With price search engines such as
shopzilla.com and pricegrabber.com, he can, in just a few minutes, find
the best-rated products and which vendor has them in stock and at the best
price (including shipping). The online store owner loves that she has no need
to pay the enormous costs of renting and building out a bricks-and-mortar
store. In addition, she doesn’t have to worry about shoplifting or inventory —
she can simply have the manufacturer or wholesaler ship the product directly
to the customer. Plus, online store owners earn money while they sleep.
But in its early years, e-commerce was slow to catch on. Customers found
site navigation and checkout difficult and too often were disappointed by
shipping delays and poor customer service. Too, store owners found it diffi-
cult and expensive to create a workable e-commerce site. Now, those problems
have largely been resolved. For example, in an hour, you can create a good 
e-commerce site using templates from ebay.com, yahoo.com, godaddy.
com, or homestead.com. As a result, even late-adopter shoppers and retail-
ers are jumping on the e-commerce bandwagon. Increasingly, shoppers use
bricks-and-mortar stores only for inexpensive or heavy items, or as a place to
see the merchandise, after which they go home and buy it on the Net.
Some career implications:
 Employment opportunities in the retail sector should be available at
price search-engine and review sites: for example, pricegrabber.com,
froogle.com, and shopzilla.com, the latter of which attracts 20 mil-
lion visitors a month!
 Avoid working for retailers, even the big ones, such as Wal-Mart and
Target, and even for online retailers. Ever-more customers will buy from
the lowest-priced provider, which often is one of a zillion tiny Web sites
run by one person willing to sell on just a few percent margin. Few good
jobs or even self-employment opportunities will be available. The best
option in this space may be a Web site selling very niched products:
advanced magic tricks, stud peacocks, or parts for high-powered lasers.

Online education and training. The word “webinar” didn’t even exist
when I wrote this book’s previous edition. Now, it’s standard training fare.
And online education has exploded. A 2006 U.S. News cover story reports
that three million students are now pursuing an entire degree online.
Although traditional education and training will long endure, I predict the
online numbers will grow much larger still because Web-based training and
education will soon combine these five powerful features:
 Full-motion video, on-demand
 Interactivity with simulations
 Human interactions via e-mail and chats
 Ease of course development using new online tools
 Portability, thanks to such devices as iPhones and video iPods
Combine all five, and online education becomes vastly superior to in-person
instruction. Instead of having to commute and find a parking spot to listen 
to some instructor — good, bad, or indifferent — drone on, you get a hand-
picked instructor, augmented by simulations and discussions that any stu-
dent (even a homebound disabled person) can access on demand, 24/7.
Additional pressure to move to specialized online training will come from the
ever-faster pace at which knowledge grows — impossible for the average uni-
versity instructor to keep up with. (See, for example, the video tutorials on
cutting-edge topics at www.tubetorial.com.)
Perhaps the most compelling application of online education will be K–12
education. Political exigencies (which I think are absurd, but that’s another
book) are forcing students of all abilities — from developmentally disabled 
to gifted — to be placed in the same teacher’s class. Without computers, it’s
virtually impossible to provide all the students with appropriate-leveled
instruction. Simulation-based, individualized online teaching modules will
someday — if the teachers’ union relents — revolutionize instruction. At that
point, the teacher’s role will primarily be to get kids unstuck and to preside
over socialization activities.
Some career implications:
 Consider working for an online training firm or an organization’s in-
house training department. Learn the art of creating and leading a 
webinar.
 In your own education and training, before signing up for a bricks-and-
mortar course, let alone for a degree program, evaluate online options.

Wireless videofication. Today, text and audio are wireless in the form of
e-mail and downloaded music, for example. Even still video is wireless. For
example, an iPhone enables you to wirelessly e-mail that photo you just took
on the beach in Hawaii to your grandparents in Chicago. Soon, you’ll be able
to use your cellphone for full-motion video. Imagine you’re on that Hawaiian
beach and feel like watching that Adam Sandler movie 50 First Dates, about
falling in love in Hawaii. Just click and you can watch it. No wires required. Or
feel like a video chat with a friend in Maine so you can rub in her face that
you’re strolling along the beach while she’s huddled in the frozen tundra?
Soon that will be possible. (First-generation versions exist. For example, see
Yahoo! Messenger’s “View my Webcam” feature at messenger.yahoo.com/
superwebcam.php.) Or instead of sitting at your desk and using kludgy Web-
conferencing software for that regional meeting (or actually flying to one),
you’ll soon be able to attend while sitting on that beach, wirelessly seeing
each other in full-motion, non-jerky video. (See WebEx.com.) Ads, especially
for big-ticket items such as cars and real estate, will have migrated from text
in newspapers, and more recently, craigslist.org, to full-motion video
commercials that — based on your interests — are e-mailed to you. Or imag-
ine taking that boring class, not in Stern Hall Room 3101, or even chained to
your home computer, but on that beach, or at least under the tree near your
favorite lake.
Some career implications:
 Job hunting will become videocentric. Using such software as
Videocaster (videocaster.com), winning resumes will include a video
presentation of the candidate, ideally demonstrating himself at work.
For example, a manager may include a video of himself running a meet-
ing. A teacher may include a demonstration lesson. They will post their
position-wanted video resumes on Web sites from monster.com to
youtube.com.
 Advice-givers, such as lawyers, counselors, and even doctors, should
consider offering online video consulting.
 Become a salesperson for a company that provides targeted e-mail 
commercials.
 Work for a company that develops wireless video infrastructure — for
example, Bluetooth.
148

 Work in the wireless distribution departments of content development
companies — for example, major film studios or top providers of online
training.
 Developing nations lack the infrastructure for wired telecommunication
and therefore make heavy use of cellphones. So demand for cellphone-
based video should be strong, thus creating employment opportunities.
Health and science
Biotech Decade. This field is about to reach the tipping point, at which its
long-standing promise will be realized. It’s taking ever-less time to conduct
experiments to determine the functions of the 23,000 genes in the human
genome, which proteins affect which gene function, and, in turn, what can be
done genetically to prevent and cure disease. For example, the day I wrote
this section, scientists announced that they can create cows that are immune
to mad cow disease. The next few years will likely see a breakthrough in the
treatment of a major human disease, and in turn, an increase in biotech
research and investment budgets, and, of course, patient demand for those
new treatments.
Some career implications:
 Biotech companies will be employers of choice, not just for scientists,
but also for all the support people required: from accountants to admin-
istrative assistants, manufacturers to marketers, risk managers to regu-
latory affairs specialists.
 Fertility clinics will expand into reproductive choice clinics, in which
prospective parents will be able to use in-vitro fertilization not just to
get pregnant (while selecting their child’s sex, which is now possible)
but also to ensure the child is born without serious disease. They may
even ensure characteristics such as high intelligence. Demand for 
reproductive choice services will grow, creating significant employment
opportunities.
 Bioethics will become a more prominent career, as ever-thornier ques-
tions become issues: A new cancer cure costs $500,000. What should
determine who gets it: Ability to pay? Worthiness of the candidate to
society? A lottery? We allow parents to choose the sex of their babies. Is
it ethical to allow them to ensure their baby has a pleasant personality?

Nanotechnology. In nanotechnology, matter is manipulated, molecule by
molecule. This will enable the creation of molecule-sized machines. Why
would anyone want such a small machine? Well obviously, you’ll be able to
wear a heckuva powerful computer on your wrist. But more intriguing appli-
cations may include cleansers that can remove any stain, insulation that can
keep homes at a constant temperature, and true medical miracles. Back in
2000, Time magazine was already touting nanotechnology’s potential: “A diag-
nosis of pancreatic cancer would be devastating to any of us, bringing with it
the horrors of debilitating chemotherapy and a slim chance of surviving the
next five years. Fifteen years from now, however, you might not even bat an
eye at the news. Your doctor will simply hand you a capsule packed with 
millions of nanosensors, each programmed to seek out and kill the cancer
cells in your body . . . And that’s not all. One day, autonomous ‘Nanobots’ far
smaller than motes of dust will patrol the body, repairing aging organs and
fixing genetic damage before it can turn into disease.”
Nanotechnology is already used in a variety of products: next-generation
water-filters, sunscreens, automotive polishes, recording tapes, and stain-
resistant fabrics, and soon, superior tires and solar cells. The U.S. government
now funds a nanotechnology initiative involving 20 federal agencies and a
budget of $1.3 billion — see www.nano.gov. That site also contains links to
other nanotechnology information. See also, www.smalltimes.com.
Some career implications: The National Science Foundation predicts that within
15 years, two million people will be employed in nanotech. Already, there are
20,000 nanotech researchers. Although most jobs will be for engineers, physi-
cists, and mathematicians, their work will be supported by people in a wide
range of backgrounds. For training opportunities, see: www.nano.gov/
html/edu/eduunder.html.
Aging. Today, just 12 percent of the U.S. population is 65-plus. By 2030, it will
jump to 30 percent.
Some career implications:
 Demand for preventive products and services will grow. Boomers are all
too aware that the healthcare system is creaky and, even at its best,
doesn’t yet have good answers for aging’s major diseases. So Boomers
are exercising more, eating healthier foods, and trying to control stress.
As a result, employment prospects should be good in such areas as
organic food, exercise facilities aimed at older adults (e.g., Curves and
yoga studios), and weight-loss programs such as Weight Watchers.
 I predict that national healthcare is coming, so experts in transitioning
from the private to a public system will be in demand. But whether the
U.S. goes single-payer or not, healthcare providers such as HMOs are
150
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

realizing that computerizing medical records, prescriptions, and diag-
noses is a cost-effective way to improve quality while lowering cost. So,
experts in computerizing healthcare, public health, and health delivery
quality control will be in demand.
 Few Boomers have saved enough to last the longer lives they’re
expected to live. And most people believe Social Security is unlikely to
help much. So the market for financial planners and estate planners
should be strong. Alas, financial planners can do only so much, so there
will be many impoverished elders. As a result, government programs for
seniors will burgeon, with accompanying opportunities for employment.
 Many Boomers have accumulated significant equity in their homes and
will sell them to finance their future. Generally, they’ll move to smaller
residences, often in retirement communities. More such facilities will
need to be built and run, creating significant job opportunities.
 Many Boomers have aged parents to care for, often at a distance. So,
demand for geriatric care managers will grow. Too, many Boomers will
decide to move their aged parent nearby. As a result, demand for in-law
units will increase. Real estate investors and developers should consider
properties with such units attached.
Environmentalism is America’s fastest-growing religion. Not withstand-
ing Al Gore’s film and the media’s froth, a dispassionate look at the science
suggests that scientists remain unsure whether global warming is man-made
and, more important, whether realistic-to-implement efforts can significantly
forestall it. A recent major British study hailed by environmentalists argues
that global warming can be forestalled, but a surprising number of experts
disagree. For example, the Copenhagen Consensus, a group of Nobel Prize–
winning scientists and economists that, in 2006, attempted to identify the
optimal ways to spend a hypothetical $50 billion to benefit mankind, rated
global warming as a bad use of money. A 2006 San Francisco Chronicle article
by senior editor Andrew Ross summarized expert judgments this way: “It is
already too late, according to an emerging consensus of opinion.” Sixty
Canadian scientists who wrote to Prime Minister Stephen Harper asserted
the same thing: There is “no consensus among climate scientists.”
Nevertheless, the United States and most Western countries are on the brink
of deciding — perhaps heavily for political reasons — to make an all-out
effort to control global warming and other environmental degradations — it’s
hard for leaders to admit it’s not worth spending the money. In addition to
the billions in dollar costs, governments have decided to impose significant
hardships on the citizenry. For example, the San Francisco Bay Area’s trans-
portation master plan prohibits building any new freeways for the next 20
years. That’s forcing commuters into gridlock, stealing time from an already
overpacked day.

Some career implications:
 Green building will become mainstream building. This will create oppor-
tunities in such industries as recyclable lumber, solar cells, and organic
insulation, paints, and carpeting, and even straw-bale construction.
 “Sustainability” will become hot, creating opportunities in such areas 
as recycling, locally and organically grown produce, and population 
control.
 America’s desire to reduce use of fossil fuels will continue to grow for
environmental reasons and to become energy-independent from the anti-
American Venezuela and Middle Eastern countries. So, employment in
both the research and production sides of the nuclear, solar, clean coal,
and wind energy fields should grow.
 Employment in pollution control industries should be strong.
 Research efforts will increase to develop no-emission vehicles. For the
latest trends, see the Institute of Transportation Studies (www.its.
ucdavis.edu).
 Employment in regulatory agencies should increase, especially with the
increase in elected Democrats that I project will continue.
For more info on this megatrend, see Andres R. Edwards’s book, The
Sustainability Revolution: Portrait of a Paradigm Shift.
Politics, culture, and economics
Terrorism is coming. As extremist groups continue to grow and the avail-
ability of hard-to-detect miniaturized weapons such as dirty nukes and
bioviruses increases, the probability grows that terrorist attacks will occur
on U.S. soil. Most experts believe that such an attack will come sooner rather
than later. The 9/11 attack hit merely three buildings yet profoundly affected
the nation’s economy. A nuclear or biological attack, or a hack into banking
systems’ computers, will have far greater effects.
Some career implications:
 Employment in federal, state, and local Homeland Security and disaster
preparedness will continue to grow.
 Employment in private sector firms specializing in terrorism prevention
and remediation will grow.
For more information, see Stephen Flynn’s book, America the Vulnerable.
152

America turns inward. Losses in Vietnam and Iraq are a one-two punch
that will knock out America’s belief that it can be the world’s policeman. The
new isolationism will, of course, save a fortune. Alas, the money won’t be
returned to the taxpayer. It will just be redirected to domestic government
spending.
Some career implications:
 Increased hiring in federal social service agencies — for example,
Education, Environmental Protection, and Health and Human Services.
 Increased hiring by contractors who serve these federal agencies.
 National healthcare (socialized medicine) will be adopted, especially if,
as I predict, Hillary Rodham Clinton or Barack Obama wins the presi-
dency in 2008.
 Decreased hiring in the military and by defense contractors.
The atheism era. Society’s mind molders — schools, colleges, and the
media — continue to increase their ridiculing of religion, especially Christianity.
An example: College classes emphasize religion’s role in causing violence
rather than its benefits to individuals and society. The news media typically
portrays religious people as airheads in rapture or highlights the worst in
religion — for example, Pat Robertson’s indefensible statements and Ted
Haggard’s, Jim Bakker’s, and Jimmy Swaggart’s sex scandals. The media
rarely reports the views of religious moderates or liberals; for example, the
media makes one think that mainstream Christians consider gay people to be
sick sinners. CNN founder Ted Turner said, “Christianity is a religion for
losers.” Movies usually portray religious people as stupid, evil, or both. I
recently rented Stephen King’s thriller movie Misery. It’s about a woman who
breaks the legs of her favorite author so she can control him. Even though
the movie has nothing to do with religion, throughout it she’s wearing a large
cross, with the cinematographer shining a bright light on it at all times, lest
we forget she’s religious. Of late, major book publishers have focused on
books advocating atheism. As I write this, The God Delusion, a book ridiculing
religion and advocating atheism, is number six on The New York Times best-
seller list. And, of course, the terrorist acts and threats of radical Muslims
haven’t helped religion’s image. In light of all this, with the exception of
Muslims and Latino Catholics, I predict a decline in religiosity in America.
Some career implications:
 While the first years of the 21st century saw an increase in attempts to
bring spirituality into the workplace, moving forward, employees in
many workplaces need to be more cautious before discussing religion at
work, especially among higher-level employees, where antireligion bias
is likely to be greatest. Job seekers should, more than ever, avoid bring-
ing up religion in interviews.
153
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

 Advertisements in the 1990s and early 21st century often displayed reli-
gious symbols, notably the Christian sign of the fish. Such approaches
will be increasingly risky.
 A decline in religiosity won’t mean a decline in the need for sources of
inspiration or for emotional support in tough times. Therefore, secular
organizations offering such support should flourish. An example is what
I call secular religious nonprofits, such as environmental advocacy groups
and bereavement, illness, and divorce-support organizations. Job seek-
ers may find these fertile grounds for finding employment. Too, entrepre-
neurs may consider serving this market.
Islam is in. Islam will buck the U.S.’s atheism trend. The Muslim birthrate 
is very high and more people, especially African-Americans, are signing on.
This trend is abetted by the media’s increasing positive attention to Islam —
for example, the extraordinary coverage of the sitcom Little Mosque on the
Prairie. Another example: Today, as I write this, the cover story of the Sunday
San Francisco Chronicle’s travel section, spanning three full pages, urges
Americans to vacation in Iran.
Career implications: Both in the U.S. and Europe, experts in Islamic cultures
and languages will be in great demand by corporate marketing departments
and by government agencies and nonprofits attempting to incorporate
Muslims into Western societies.
The Latinization of America. According to a 2006 Time magazine cover
story, Latinos in the United States have a 60 percent higher birth rate than
Whites. In addition, more than one million new Latinos — legal and illegal —
immigrate to the United States every year. More than half the growth in the
U.S. population is now Hispanic. By 2050, the United States will be less than
half White, with Hispanics becoming, by far, the largest ethnic group. Earlier
waves of immigration were largely from European countries, nations that 
had high levels of socioeconomic development. This wave of immigration is
largely from countries with low levels. In addition, this wave, because more
than 50 percent arrive illegally, is largely unscreened for diseases and crimi-
nal records.
Some career implications: Bilingualism in Spanish and understanding of
Latino culture will become an increasingly important qualification for
employment, especially in these areas:
 Marketing. Latinos have, on average, distinctive product and service
preferences. Companies will be eager to tap this market.
 Healthcare. Latino immigrants come to the United States with greater-
than-average healthcare needs. For example, communicable, multiple-
drug-resistant tuberculosis is a growing problem. Doctors and nurses, 
in healthcare facilities and in outreach efforts, must be able to speak
Spanish. Public health departments will also require more bilingual/
bicultural personnel.
154
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

 Education. Previous waves of immigration were controlled, so schools
could handle the numbers of children who didn’t speak English. Today, 
it appears that American society has decided not to heavily control
immigration. As a result, many schools are already overwhelmed by 
limited-English-proficient students. Therefore, the demand for bilingual/
bicultural teachers, aides, and administrators will continue to climb.
 Social services. The average Latino immigrant’s income is low, and so
their demand for government-provided services is high. Examples of
these services include cash welfare payments, food stamps, Medicare,
and subsidized housing. Advocates are working hard to ensure that
immigrants get those social services, so the government will continue to
hire more social workers and other professionals to meet the demand.
 Criminal justice. Illegal immigrants commit disproportionate numbers
of violent felonies. According to the California Department of Corrections,
25 percent of all incarcerated felons in California are illegal immigrants
from Mexico. This creates a great need for bilingual/bicultural lawyers,
judges, court administrators, and so on.
 Border security. Securing the 2,000-mile border between the U.S. and
Mexico will require significant new hiring by the government and by
government contractors. Both human and technological solutions will
be adopted. Thousands of people are required just to build that 700-mile
fence.
For more on the Latinization of America, see the Web sites of the Pew
Hispanic Center (www.pewhispanic.org) and the Center for Immigration
Studies (www.cis.org).
Declining America. Fed Chair Ben Bernanke has warned that America’s
economy is at risk of serious decline. Corporate earnings (and in turn, tax
payments and job openings) are likely to decline for many reasons:
 Americans will spend less as fewer of them will be able to afford a mate-
rialistic lifestyle as more well-paying jobs are offshored and remaining
ones will require technical expertise that few Americans have the ability,
time, and money to acquire.
 Brain drain: Top Asian employees are increasingly leaving the United
States to work in Asia for Asian companies, especially those in China.
 Ever-increasing environmental (for example, California’s strict new
global warming law) and financial (for example, Sarbanes-Oxley) regula-
tions are decreasing earnings, while companies in other countries, such
as China, have far fewer restrictions.
 Shopping price engines now enable both business and consumer 
customers to price-shop better than ever before. That lowers profit 
margins.
155
Chapter 2: The Cool Careers Yellow Pages

 The current wave of immigrants, unlike previous ones, spends less
money in the U.S. Instead, they send money back to their family in their
home country. For example, in 2005, Mexicans living in the U.S. sent $45
billion back to Mexico.
 Corporations have a growing desire or pressure to give away profits.
Last year, American businesses donated to nonprofits an all-time high
$4.1 billion. They make additional large noncash donations. For example,
Home Depot contributed 50,000 employees and two million hours to
community service. In previous generations, much of that money would
have been fed back to shareholders to pump into the U.S. economy, 
or reinvested in research and development, which would ultimately
result in improved products, increased sales, and in turn, more job
growth. Now, those funds are spent on causes less likely to have such
multiplicative effects — for example, a donation to the symphony or art
museum. Meanwhile, government tax revenues, thus decreased because
of likely-to-decline corporate earnings, will be less able to keep up with
social spending for the rapidly increasing numbers of needy aged and
immigrants.
Also contributing to America’s decline is its descending social norms: For
example, integrity among its residents appears to be declining. Examples:
corporate leaders’ financial fraud, athletes cheating by taking performance-
enhancing drugs, escalating student cheating on exams and adult cheating 
on taxes, increased “creative writing” on resumes, and clerics’ having sex
with children parishioners. Also straining the social fabric are society’s 
mindmolders — the schools, colleges, and media — who are encouraging
people to identify more with people of their race or ethnic group than with
people in general, which is straining life in and outside the workplace. That
model has led to devastating violence in many societies around the world,
past and present (Sunnis and Shiites, Serbs and Croats, Hutus and Tutsis,
Israelis and Palestinians, Irish Catholics and Protestants) and portends to do
the same in the U.S.
America needs less pluribus and more unum.
Some career implications:
 The retraining business will boom. As Boomers retire and as technology
demands increase, employers will be forced to provide or subsidize
community-college-based retraining. Employees will see it as the only
way to earn more than subsistence wages.
 This is China’s and India’s century. Americans may most easily capitalize
by working for U.S. companies with current or intended interests in
those countries. Entrepreneurs beware, however. It isn’t easy to do busi-
ness in those countries without deep in-country connections. Eastern
156
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here

Europe, only now fully embracing capitalism, may offer better entrepre-
neurial opportunities. For example, a client of mine set up a medical
journal publishing company in Poland. Another conducts corporate
training in Hungary. Both of those fields are fairly saturated in the United
States but less so in Eastern Europe. Both clients are now millionaires.
 Pressures to offshore jobs will increase, and in turn, the need for U.S.
employees expert at finding quality employees overseas and in training
them to work well with American co-workers and customers will also
increase.
 Hiring and salaries will decline in most sectors, but mostly in the private
sector. The last bastion of reasonable job security will be in government
employment. Exception: Public sentiment and decreased tax revenues
will usher in a new era of U.S. isolationism, so employment in the 
military-industrial complex will decline.
 A small number of interesting jobs may exist in corporate foundations —
the entities that companies create to give away money to nonprofit
causes.
 Public schools will, in ever-more locales, become unacceptable to
middle-class families. This will increase demand for private schools and
home-schooling consultants. In just the last 20 years, the number of home-
schooled children has grown from 300,000 to two million!
 People will cocoon more. Traffic and crime will likely increase. So, as
home-based entertainment gets more impressive, people will choose to
spend more discretionary time at home. Careers involved in making
home environments more pleasant (for example, home remodeling)
should benefit.
 The middle class will shrink and the lower class will expand. This will
give rise to government policies to redistribute wealth downward and/or
increased social unrest, such as youth riots like those seen in France in
2006. Thus, government careers assisting (or resisting) the poor should
increase.
 Increasing numbers of middle-class and wealthy Americans will relocate
to Asia, and to less volatile English-speaking countries, such as Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand. Specialists in helping people to relocate will
be needed.
 More people will need to learn to find happiness without materialism.
They will need to come to realize that the life well led comes far more
from good work and good relationships than from expensive jewelry, a
luxury car, a fancy house, or five-star vacations. With that realization,
you’ll be able to consider a far wider and perhaps more rewarding range
of careers than you otherwise may have.

The 35 Most Revealing Questions
About You
In This Chapter
 Assessing values, abilities, and passions
 Gauging your potential for self-employment
 Taking in the big picture
 Working with your virtual career coach
You meet. Your heart starts pounding. You fall madly in lust. You don’t
stop to think that he’s married to his work. Or that her earning potential
is worse than an aspiring artist’s.
Or the opposite, you meet the logical choice: intelligent, employed, no vices.
Rationally, it’s right, but the chemistry’s not.
As in finding a mate, choosing a career should involve both your head and your
heart. You’ve already used your heart: You picked out the careers from the
Cool Careers Yellow Pages in Chapter 2 that make your heart beat faster. Now
it’s time to use your head. Which of those careers (or perhaps another career)
logically makes sense? If you’re like most career searchers, you’re not sure.
That’s where the 35 questions in this chapter come in. Over the years, with
my clients and callers to my career radio show, I’ve tried every approach
imaginable to tease out people’s career musts: the things that people really
want and need in a career. I’ve found these 35 questions to be the most help-
ful to most people.

Making the Process Easier
When a doctor takes your medical history, she knows that only a few of your
answers to her many questions will reveal anything significant. She still asks
all the questions because she can’t know in advance which ones are signifi-
cant for you. The same is true of these 35 questions. Only a few will reveal
your true career musts.
Questions that yield a career must usually elicit an immediate “Aha!” So if you
have any trouble answering a question, skip it and go on — that question is
unlikely to be significant for you.
After you answer these questions, I tell you how to make use of your career
musts in the later section “The Virtual Career Coach: Integrating Head and
Heart.”
Examining Your Values
Each night, when people put their heads on their pillows, they feel good if
they worked and lived in accordance with their values. But what are your
values? These questions will help you unearth them.

8. What do you most enjoy talking about?
Pick something that may suggest a career for you — your darling daugh-
ter, probably not; fashion, maybe; health, even more likely. I encourage
you to come up with unusual, even weird topics. If you come up with
something that everyone seems to be interested in (say, pop culture),
you may have a tough time landing a well-paying job in that field. If you
come up with something unusual — for example, improving school cur-
riculum or hydrogen-cell-powered cars — your chances are better.

You have much less competition for good jobs and then advancement in
fields that few people aspire to work in. Examples of these fields include
the scrap metal industry, database administration, and heavy equipment
manufacturing.

Considering Self-Employment
You live in an era in which highly paid, secure employee jobs are increasingly
reserved for superstars. For everyone else, self-employment may be a more
likely route. But not everyone has what it takes. What about you? These ques-
tions can help you decide.
165
Chapter 3: The 35 Most Revealing Questions About You

If you can’t honestly answer yes to the following questions but are still eager
to consider self-employment, you may want to work as an assistant to a suc-
cessfully self-employed person. You’ll either acquire the skills and mindset
you need or realize that you’re wiser to be employed by someone else.
16. Do any of these self-employment categories excite you?
• Distributing the work of creative people: Examples include being
an agent for performers or artists, being a film distributor, or
owning an online art gallery.
• Replicating a successful business in a different geographic area:
For example, opening a New York–style pizza place in the South or
selling previously best-selling computer equipment in developing
countries.
• Being self-employed in a high-profit-margin, niche field that has little
competition: For example, selling used parts for 18-wheel trucks.
• Paying $10,000 to $100,000-plus to be shown how to run a particu-
lar business, step by step (buying an existing business or franchise)
• Turning people’s complaints into a business that you can start
• Converting a hobby or personal interest into a business
• Finding a product or service that you want to sell
• Creating a template for a difficult-to-stage event and replicating it
for different customers: An example is staging fundraising auctions
for nonprofit organizations.
• Starting a grungy business, which means you have few competitors:
Examples include commercial bathroom maintenance, hazardous
waste disposal, and high-voltage electrical work. (Those aren’t
exactly cool careers, but sometimes making big money in a mun-
dane career feels cooler than making chickenfeed in a cool career.)
17. Do you like being in charge?
Do you love running the show and hate having someone tell you what
you can and can’t do? When you’re your own boss, you make all the
decisions — from which computer to buy to whether to take on a lucrative
but risky project. Staying motivated when you’re on your own is easier
when you crave one of the main benefits of being self-employed: control.
18. Are you flexible?
Planning is valuable when you’re on your own, but often, you have to
throw out your plan and reinvent. If you’re looking for a relatively fixed
job description, you’ll do better in a salaried job. But if you like the idea
of continually reshaping what you do, self-employment feels good.
19. Can you get things done?
Are you unusually productive? Ideas and dreams are a dime a dozen. The
key to turning them into reality is implementation. As they say, success
166
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here 

is 5 percent inspiration and 95 percent perspiration. If you’re easily dis-
tracted from work, you’ll have problems being self-employed.
20. Are you good at solving real-world problems quickly?
Think of stumbling blocks you’ve faced at work and at home. Did you
overcome most of them quickly, or did you stay bogged down? When
you’re your own boss, there’s always a thorny issue to address. The suc-
cessfully self-employed solve problems quickly, by themselves or with
some affordable help.
21. Are you persistent?
Even the successfully self-employed face many setbacks, but they don’t
sulk. They quickly move to develop a new strategy. (Of course, that
doesn’t preclude an occasional private cry.)
22. Do you communicate well?
As the front person, you must make a good first impression, orally and
in writing.
Today, much of the world’s communication occurs by computer. To suc-
ceed in most businesses, you must be able to quickly draft e-mails, find
information on the Internet, and continually update your Web site. The
latter has become easier with do-it-yourself Web site-creation software
such as store.yahoo.com or www.homestead.com.
23. Are you willing and able to market and sell?
No matter how much you enjoy doing your work, you won’t get the
chance to do it as your own boss unless you can find a way to let others
know what you can do for them.
Answering Big-Picture Questions
Often, career searchers get bogged down trying to figure out their career
building blocks: skills, interests, and values. Yet sometimes, the wisest career
choice is more organic — think bigger-picture. These questions may help you
see the forest through the trees.
24. What are your peak accomplishments?
You had plenty of drive to complete these achievements, and they gave
you a strong sense of accomplishment. If you can’t think of at least two
from adulthood, go back to your younger days. Does looking at your
peak accomplishments suggest a career must or a career?
__________________________________________________________________

25. Describe your dream workday, from the moment you get up until the
moment you go to sleep. Does that suggest a career must or even a
career?
__________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________
26. What career do your parents, partner, or close friends think that you
should pursue?
If you don’t know, ask them. But don’t too quickly accept or reject their
advice because of the source. Make an open-minded choice.
__________________________________________________________________

person who can help you get hired for a better job than you can get
on the open market? If so, what work could you do for that person?

31. If you acted like a true grownup, what would you do?

suggest the sort of career you should pursue?

33. Sometimes, what you need more than anything is a change. What
career appeals to you that represents a dramatic change from what
you’re currently doing?
__________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________
34. If you’re thinking about a career change, what makes you think that
seeking a new career is wiser than finding a new job in your same
career or doing more to make the most of your current job? For exam-
ple, can you seek out new assignments or a new boss, or work on your
personal demons without changing careers?
__________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________
35. Deep down, some people know what they want to do. They simply
need to be asked point-blank. Richard Bolles asks, “What job would
you love to do more than any other in the world?”

The Virtual Career Coach: Integrating
Head and Heart
Great! You used your heart to pick out careers that feel good from the Cool
Careers Yellow Pages (see Chapter 2). You used your head to answer the 35
Most Revealing Questions earlier in this chapter. Now, I show you how to inte-
grate head and heart so you end up choosing a career that satisfies you both
rationally and emotionally.
I’m going to be straight with you. Despite my best efforts, the remaining few
pages of this chapter can be, frankly . . . well . . . let me just say it . . . hard.
169
Chapter 3: The 35 Most Revealing Questions About You

They require you to do some careful thinking about your career. However,
these pages are also important. Otherwise, I would have simply pressed the
delete key. Stay with me. Most of you will find this section worth the effort.
Step 1: List your career musts
Look at your answers to the 35 Most Revealing Questions and circle the
answers that you consider most significant. These are your career musts.
If you circled more than five career musts, see whether you can whittle them
down to the five most important without feeling like you’re cutting off your
right arm. Hint: You can often cheat by combining two musts into one.
Step 2: See whether the careers you
picked satisfy your career musts
Look at how well each career you picked from the Cool Careers Yellow Pages
satisfies your career musts. Do your career musts make you want to elimi-
nate any of those careers?
Step 3: Note other careers suggested by
your career musts
Look at your career musts. Do any other careers come to mind that are at
least as interesting as those you picked from the Cool Careers Yellow Pages?
Want more ideas? Show your career musts to your friends — a decent party
game. Here are some examples:
 When Jacque saw “sales,” “romance,” and “aesthetic” among her career
musts, she added wedding planner to her list of possible careers.
 When Luther saw “writing,” “travel,” “high-income,” and “fluent in
Spanish,” he added “marketing communications writer for a fast-growing
company that does business with Central America” to his list of possible
careers.
Many people’s career musts are quite general — for example, “I like managing
adults.” Beyond that, in their heart of hearts, they don’t really have any career
musts. As long as the job pays well, they’re cool. If that sounds like you, you
have two choices: sally forth with that general career goal, or force yourself
170
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here 

to narrow. Most job seekers find that their search goes more smoothly if they
do the latter. For example, if you like managing adults, here are ways to narrow:
 Focus on one industry — for example, biotech or fashion.
 Decide where you want to manage, perhaps in a hospital, in a home-
based business, or on a cruise ship to Bora Bora.
 Think about whom you want to manage. Arty types? Business people?
Techies? Highly intelligent people?
A wise client once said, “Managing is managing, so why not pick an uncrowded
industry, one that most people wouldn’t think of?” He looked through the index
of the Yellow Pages (the phone book, not this book’s Yellow Pages) and stopped
at “acid manufacturers.” He read up on the acid industry, e-mailed all the local
firms, and soon got a management job with a minimum of competition.
Step 4: Add careers from the 35 
Most Revealing Questions
One or more of the 35 earlier questions may have elicited not only a career
must, but also an actual career that intrigues you. If so, do you like that
career at least as well as the careers you picked from the Cool Careers Yellow
Pages? If so, add it (or them) to your list of possible careers.
Step 5: Pick one or more careers 
that may actually work
Look at all your possible careers:
 Careers you identified in Steps 3 and 4
 Careers you picked from the Cool Careers Yellow Pages in Chapter 2
 Other careers you’re considering — like going into your uncle’s widget
business
And now, ta-dah, the moment of truth: Which career seems most intriguing?
Don’t expect to feel orgasmic about it yet. Intrigued is good enough for now.
Step 6: Find out more
Before making your final career choice, you want to learn more about that
top-choice career(s) of yours. Chapter 4 shows you how to do just that.

Chapter 4
Making Your Career Choice
In This Chapter
 Reviewing what’s published
 Getting the scoop from people in the field
 Paying a visit to a workplace
 Addressing your career fears
 Making a final check on your choice
You’ve found a career (or three) that sounds good. But what if you picked
wrong? What if you fail in that career? Or what if you succeed but are
totally miserable?
This chapter boosts your chances of picking well. It shows how to find out
what a career is really like — before taking the plunge. And it’s not compli-
cated. Reading, contacting, and visiting are the three approaches. Read about
the career, and if it still sounds good, contact a few people in the field, and if
it still feels right, visit a few people at their workplaces. This chapter shows
you how to make the most of all three approaches.
A side benefit of all that digging is that you have insider information about
the career, which should make you impressive in job interviews. (I give you
the full scoop on interviews in Chapter 10.)
Despite all that sleuthing, some people will be afraid to commit to a career.
(They’re probably the same people who are afraid to commit to a relation-
ship.) Not to worry: This chapter concludes with a smorgasbord of strategies
that can help even the most commitment-phobic person choose a career.
Reading about a Career
Articles and books are among the most underrated products. (And a college
education may be the most overrated, but that’s another book.) If you’re will-
ing to do only one thing to check out a career, read. A good article or book
constitutes access to the best, most thorough, and most carefully organized

ideas. And they’re available to you 24/7 online or at the library for free, or
worst case, for the cost of a large pizza.
By reading a career-related article or skimming a book, you usually discover
things that one or more experts took years to figure out. Take, for example,
the Occupational Outlook Handbook. It includes authoritative profiles of 270
of the most popular careers, based on interviews with many people in those
fields. What a treasure! Reading the OOH is like discovering what thousands
of people have to say about their careers. Plus, the information is distilled for
you and available whenever or wherever you want it. To me, that’s cool.
In this section, I explain the benefits of reading before contacting or visiting
people in a field, and I give you tips on the best reading material out there.
Why read before phoning or visiting?
Okay, so why read about a career before contacting someone in that field?
Simple: You don’t want to sound like a dodo. Read about the career and
you’re more likely to impress your contacts as being worth their time. Who
knows? One of them may then be willing to take you under wing, reveal inside
secrets, and maybe even help you get hired.
Also, boning up in advance means you make the most of your contact — you
need to ask only about the things you couldn’t discover on your own.
What’s the best stuff to read?
“All right, so you’ve guilt-tripped me into reading stuff. What should I read?” I
tell you in the following sections.
Getting help from the library
Try this elegantly simple approach recommended by Mary-Ellen Mort, career
librarian and founder of jobstar.org, a leading career site.
1. Call your area’s central library and ask which branch (or local college
or high school) has the best career collection.
If no career collection is available, ask for the business collection.
2. Visit or call the librarian in charge of that collection and describe the
career you want to learn more about.
That’s all you need to do. The librarian is likely to help you find the right
information. It’s that simple.
174
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here 

In addition to books and periodicals, many of today’s libraries subscribe to
powerful online services — too expensive for home users — that can search
enormous databases for information about your target career. So, even if you
live hours away from a decent library, you may be able to access their data-
bases from your home computer or even get the librarian to do a little
searching for you and e-mail you the results.
Brushing up on other reading materials
If you’re a do-it-yourselfer who’d rather I hand you some cool references,
here they are. No need to consult them all. Just pick any that jump out at you.
 The Occupational Outlook Handbook ($17.95 as a paperback book,
free online at www.bls.gov/oco). Its strength is its authoritativeness.
Its weakness is that it avoids any subjectivity. So it’s great on the facts,
lousy on the feel. For the latter, use the guides in the next bullet.
 Vault.com’s guides and WetFeet.com’s Insider Guides are filled with
insider information on popular fields. They do a particularly thorough
job on investment banking, attorney, and management careers in a vari-
ety of industries. Also, they provide insider-written profiles of large 
companies.
 University of California, Berkeley Career Site
(www.uhs.berkeley.edu/Students/CareerLibrary/Links/
occup.cfm). I’m touting this not because it’s from my alma mater but
because it offers an amazing amount of well-organized information on
hundreds of careers. Not surprising for a university site, the focus is on
careers requiring a degree.
 Career Voyages (www.careervoyages.gov/students-links.cfm).
Compliments of the Feds, this site offers text and video information on
100+ careers, with an emphasis on the cutting edge.
 America’s CareerInfoNet (www.acinet.org). This site is also a federal
freebie and offers links to some of the Net’s best career information sites.
 Google.com. Use your prospective career as the search term. Rely not
only on Google’s Web search, but also click on its “groups” tab, and you
can search thousands of online discussion groups — often a source of
scuttlebutt. There, you can also post a query such as, “I’m thinking
about a career in X. What should I know about it that might not appear
in print?”
 Amazon.com. Simply enter your career into Amazon’s search feature
and out pops book titles with your career in the title. Bonus: The listings
include descriptions and usually reviews of the books.
 Professional association publications. A professional association’s Web
site often contains a gold mine of information about the field assembled
175
Chapter 4: Making Your Career Choice

by the field’s leaders. I provide Web addresses of associations for most
of the 500+ careers in this book’s Cool Careers Yellow Pages (see 
Chapter 2).
 The Riley Guide (www.rileyguide.com). This site links to other sites
for hundreds of specific occupations.
Contacting People in the Field
You can’t find out everything by reading. As you find out in the following 
sections, talking to people lets you ask the questions that your reading didn’t
answer. It’s also a way to start building your professional network.
Many career seekers are reluctant to call people in the field. The two main
reasons are “I don’t want to impose” and “I’m afraid I’ll sound stupid.” Remem-
ber that most people like to talk about their careers. And if they don’t, they’re
adults — they can say no. And if you do sound stupid, so what! How important
is that in the larger scheme of things? Besides, with that advance reading
you’ve done, you probably will sound brilliant.
Need more prodding to pick up the phone or send that e-mail? Chapter 12
offers cures for procrastitis.
“Okay, okay, but whom do I contact?”
This list should yield you more contacts than you can stomach:
 If you have a friend or relative in your target career, you can start there.
At the end of the conversation, ask for the names of colleagues you
could speak with.
 Your college’s Web site or career center may maintain a list of alumni,
including their line of work. Some may be willing to tell their career tales.
 Attend a local meeting of your prospective career’s professional associa-
tion or an on-campus professional club.
 Get the phone numbers of members of the professional association by
checking its Web site.
 Find names in the professional association’s magazine or newsletter.
Authors and cited experts are often more accessible than you may think.
 If you have chutzpah, just open your Yellow Pages and start dialing. Use
your printed Yellow Pages for locals, and use anywho.com for out-of-
towners. If you’re considering an entrepreneurial career, out-of-towners
are more likely to talk with you because they’re less afraid you’ll become
a competitor.
176
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here 

Each person’s viewpoint is idiosyncratic. One dentist may gush that business
is booming while the next dentist moans that attracting new patients is like
pulling teeth. (I couldn’t resist.) So don’t get too swayed by one person’s
opinion. Speak with at least two or three folks.
“What should I say?”
Nearly everyone gets nervous when asking something of another person. The
antidote is preparation. In the following sections, I do much of that prepara-
tion for you: a model script for how to open your conversation followed by a
smorgasbord of questions to choose from.
Getting through to your target and introducing yourself
Count on getting turned down often in your quest for information, but the 
following approach works often enough, and, unlike oft-recommended ruses,
it’s honest.
When you phone, you’ll rarely get your target person. The key to getting
through a gatekeeper or voicemail jail is to briefly tell your true human story.
Here’s a gatekeeper example:
Hello, my name is (insert your name). This may be one of the weirder
(trust me, that word works) calls you’ve gotten today, but I really need
your help. I’m trying to choose my career and I think I may want to be a
(insert career), but I’m not sure yet. I’ve read about the career but feel I
should talk with someone in the field. Can I ask you to see whether your
boss may be willing to answer just a few questions about what it’s like to
be a (insert career)?
If the gatekeeper can’t or won’t put you through, ask for your target’s e-mail
address. But for now, assume you have your target person on the phone. This
approach works well:
Hello, I’m (insert your name). I’d really appreciate your help. I’m consider-
ing becoming a (insert career). I’ve read a lot about the field but would
like to talk with someone who’s actually in that career. I wonder if I could
ask you just a few questions about your experience as a (insert career).
If the person says that now isn’t a good time, ask when you can call back or
whether you can meet in person. Read on to find out what to do if the person
agrees to answer your questions right away.
Asking useful questions
Next, ask your questions. You may have your own, but these questions are
likely to elicit useful information. There are more here than you need; pick
your favorites.
177
Chapter 4: Making Your Career Choice

 How’d you get into this career?
 Can you walk me through a typical day?
 What do you find to be the best and worst things about your career?
 Can you think of anything I should know about this field that is unlikely
to find its way into print? (My favorite question.)
 What skills have you found crucial to succeeding in your career?
 Can you think of anything you know now that you wish you’d known
when you were deciding to enter this field?
 Describe your background and interests. Then ask: Do you think I should
consider this field? Any other fields I should consider?
 Are there any particularly interesting specialties within your field?
 Any advice about the smartest way to prepare for this career?
 Are there entry-level jobs in this field that provide particularly good
learning experiences?
 In this field, where are good job openings listed?
 What kind of salary can I expect?
 How is the field changing?
 Why might someone leave this field?
 Do you know someone else you think I should talk with or something
else I should read before deciding whether to pursue this career? Any
event I should attend? Any organization I should join?
 Any other advice you’d give someone entering this field?
If the conversation goes well, ask whether you can spend an hour watching
that person at work.
Visiting a Workplace
Why visit? Because, like sex, some things you just have to experience to 
fully appreciate. Watching someone at work is the next best thing to trying it
yourself.
Craig, for example, thought he might want to be an arborist (tree surgeon),
but after spending an hour on-site with a professional, realized that having to
spend that much time on high branches, often in bad weather, outweighed
the joy of artfully shaping trees.
In the following sections, I explain what to do during a workplace visit and
give you the scoop on virtual visits.
178
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here 

At the risk of stating the obvious, send a thank-you letter or e-mail to your
contact after you visit a workplace. For secrets to writing a winning letter,
check out Chapter 10.
Knowing what to do during a visit
Okay, so you’re on-site. What now? Just ask the person to show you around
and to let you watch tasks that are central to the job. (Sometimes an hour
will give you all you need; other times, you may want to spend an entire day
or even longer.) If possible, get introduced to others in that career at the
worksite.
Use your head and your heart. Rationally, can you see yourself doing this
work, day in and day out? Emotionally, do you sense that you’d feel good in
such a career?
Taking a virtual visit
If you live on an isolated farm, visiting an urban planner may not be easy. That’s
why videos can be valuable. In some ways, career videos are better than in-
person visits because they usually round up a variety of people in the profes-
sion, ask good questions, and give you the full tour. And a virtual visit is perfect
for those shy souls who simply can’t make themselves set up an in-person visit,
let alone ask lots of good questions. Large libraries, especially those in a high
school or college career center, often have a collection of career videos.
Videos on hundreds of careers can be viewed at www.careervoyages.gov/
careervideos-main.cfm and www.acinet.org/videos.
asp?id=27,1&nodeid=27.
Getting Serious about a Career
By now, you should have identified a top-choice career, but it’s worth a little
more digging to ensure your choice is a wise one. Here are some methods:
 A seminar or short course in your chosen field: The professional asso-
ciation for that career may offer live, recorded, or online versions. Also
check your local college’s extension catalog. Taking a short course helps
you assess both your aptitude for and interest in the field.
 Conferences and trade shows: Here you find hundreds of practitioners
plus their suppliers and customers all in one place. Exhibit areas sell
tools of the trade, and ongoing workshops teach you the field’s basics
and cutting edges. Plus, the many meals, breaks, and parties are
179
Chapter 4: Making Your Career Choice

designed to facilitate discussion. These events often are listed on a
career’s professional association Web site. Associations Unlimited, an
online database available through many large libraries, also lists upcom-
ing major meetings for most professional and trade associations.
 Volunteering, interning, or project work: Nothing takes the place of 
an actual tryout. A brief one is often enough to show you what you need
to know about a career. For instance, before deciding to become a high
school teacher, Derrick volunteered as a classroom aide. After a week,
he began to feel the draining effect of trying to keep 30 students — a 
different 30 every 50 minutes — motivated, let alone educated. He also
quickly tired of the conversations in the teachers’ lounge. Teaching wasn’t
right for him. Two weeks of volunteering saved him two years of training
plus many more years of unhappiness in a career he didn’t like.
Think of a short-term volunteer or low-pay stint as a tuition-free educa-
tion. Working for little or nothing gives you power — the power to ensure
you get to do meaningful work. So, before signing on, negotiate your role.
Licking envelopes for an oceanographer won’t give you a good idea of
what the job is like. Accompanying the oceanographer on a dive in a
bathyscaph followed by a day entering data into a computer will.
Good internships can often be created simply by asking a desired mentor
whether you could be her slave in exchange for some mentorship. The
advantage of that approach is that you get to pick your supervisor. Or to
find existing internships, see www.rileyguide.com/intern.html.
Finding the Courage to Commit
No matter how much analysis you do, saying, “Yes, this is the career I want!”
can be hard to do. People hesitate to commit to a career for three reasons:
you don’t know enough about your prospective career, one career doesn’t
stand out, and fear. The courage builders in this section address all three.
When you don’t know enough 
about a prospective career
What’s making you nervous about your proposed career? Sometimes, get-
ting more information can reassure you. Could reading something, talking to
someone, or observing a workplace help you decide whether your prospec-
tive career is a wise choice? (I cover all these tasks earlier in this chapter.)
Examples:
 “Am I good enough in math to be an economist?” Possible solution:
Ask economists how much math they use and whether niches exist that
require less. Can you do that much math?
180
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here 

 The cost and time of training. Possible solution: Keep asking around.
Often, you can find shortcut training.
 “Does a market really exist for the product I’m thinking of selling?”
Possible solution: Ask potential customers.
When no career seems attractive enough
Sure, maybe you just need more options. But often, you can scour every
career collection in the world and still have a hard time committing. Often,
that’s because you’re holding out for a career that feels clearly superior to
your other options.
True, some people know, early on, that they were meant to be a doctor, ballet
dancer, or whatever, but those folks rarely use career guides. If that uniquely
perfect career was going to hit you like a lightning bolt, it probably would’ve
done so long before now.
If I filled a room with 100 people who love their careers, most of them would
say that before entering the career, they weren’t sure they’d love it. Most of
them could easily have chosen another career. What brought them to career
contentment was getting started, choosing something. They got to the point
where they just bit the bullet: “I’m just going to choose something, dammit!”
That enabled them to turn their attention toward the things that make a career
wonderful: getting good training, finding a good job or self-employment oppor-
tunity within that field, and then tailoring their job to fit their strengths, weak-
nesses, and preferences. Not surprisingly, after all that, they started to expe-
rience success in the career. Only then could they say, “I love my career.”
So, follow these steps to be like most of those 100 people:
1. Pick your favorite careers from the Cool Careers Yellow Pages in
Chapter 2 and from the 35 Most Revealing Questions in Chapter 3.
2. Distill that input using the virtual career coach in Chapter 3.
3. Take a moderate amount of time to check out a prospective career(s)
using the approaches I tell you about earlier in this chapter.
4. Select your top-choice career, even if it doesn’t generate career
ecstasy. As long as that top-choice career feels likely to be better
than the status quo, choose it.
Until you get into the career, you can’t really know for sure whether it can
make you happy. But taking steps down one career path is more likely to help
you figure that out than additional thinking at the trailhead.
181
Chapter 4: Making Your Career Choice

Be passionate in pursuing the career, even if you’re ambivalent. That’s key to
ensuring your success. Focus on
 Getting the best training possible. Good training makes you feel and
become competent. You can often find the best training at a student-ori-
ented college rather than at a prestigious, research-oriented one. Even
more practical training options include mentors, workshops, tapes, and
articles. Part II covers your training options.
 Doing a thorough job search. If you can get multiple job offers, you
maximize your chances of finding a job with good co-workers, learning
opportunities, an organization you feel good about, and one that offers
annual paid training in Hawaii. Part III shows you how to land a great job.
 Molding your job to fit your strengths. Revise your job description to
make use of your assets. Propose projects you’d find fun. You may even
be able to incorporate some advantages of other careers you considered.
For example, if you choose interior design over photography, make
before-and-after photos a part of your service. Head to Chapter 11 for
more on making the most of any job.
 Recognizing that your career contentment depends not just on a 
well-suited career and job, but on other factors as well:
• Accepting that work is work. Even those who have worklives that
many people envy usually think that work is still work. Work isn’t
often as pleasurable as going out to eat, walking in nature, or being
with someone you love. I can gratefully accept that work is work,
mainly because I value being productive, feeling needed, having
structure, and earning a living, even when it isn’t fun. If you make
this mindset permeate your workday, you can feel good about your
worklife in almost any career.
• Maintaining an accepting attitude. Resenting work’s many
moments that are too hard, too easy, too stressful, or too boring is
easy to do. Or you can view those moments with a Zen-like accep-
tance and a commitment to handle each moment with grace,
reminding yourself of the good in your life. For me, this is the key
to happiness, not just in a career, but in life.
At minimum, starting down a career path helps you discover that you made a
wrong choice. Millions of people change careers. If your next career choice
bombs, you’ll learn about yourself and make a better choice next time. You’ll
certainly make a wiser choice than if you had attempted to divine the perfect
career while sitting on the sidelines.
When you’re afraid that you’ll fail
Fear of failure is sometimes legitimate — in your gut, you know your chances
of success are small. But sometimes, even if your rational mind believes you
182
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here 

have a reasonable chance of success, your fear of failure makes you too
scared to give it a try. The following courage builders may help.
Know that it’s usually worth risking failure
Many successful people have failed a lot. In my first after-school job, I was 
an office clerk — and got fired for making too many careless errors. My first
professional job was as a school psychologist. My contract wasn’t renewed
because I wasn’t supportive enough of teachers’ efforts. My first book was
rejected by 18 publishers before one publisher offered me the grand sum of
$5,000 for it. Yet if you look at my bio in the front of this book, I daresay you’d
call me a success. To maximize your chances of success, try difficult, exciting
things, and when you fail, ask what you can learn from it.
Failing usually is better than not trying at all. Not trying is the one way to
guarantee you fail. You’d be surprised how often trying something difficult
works out: Your adrenaline is pumping, you scramble awhile, and eventually
you do okay. And that feels great.
Yeah I know, your shrink told you that your fear of risk taking stems from
your childhood: Your mother taught you not to take risks, or your father
yelled at you when you made a mistake. I also know that the kindly shrink
probably inadvertently supported your inertia: “I know how hard it must be
when your parents were so tough on you.” Bottom line, you gotta make your-
self get over it. If the benefits of trying something exceed the risks, feel the
fear and do it anyway. Force yourself to stay focused on taking small steps
and getting help when you’re stuck. After working with 2,600 clients, many
who have had therapy, I believe that many people are helped more by the
previous sentence than by years on the therapist’s couch.
All your ducks needn’t be in a row
Many people think that before starting their career, they must start with a
crystal clear idea of their ultimate career goal and know they have the poten-
tial to succeed. It rarely works that way.
Many successful people get their first jobs with only a general idea of their
career direction. Many are unsure whether they’ll succeed in that career.
They simply sallied forth. Kumar, a new college graduate, had the sense he
wanted to work in high-tech but couldn’t be more precise than that. He got a
quickie certification in Java and Oracle and stuck those on his resume to see
what that bait would yield. He got a job as a Web site programmer. Who
knows whether he’ll end up happy in that career, but I’d sooner bet on him
than on someone who waited for crystal clarity before acting.
The chief resident at a New York medical school greets each year’s interns 
by saying, “Each of you is entitled to one clean kill. You can’t become a good
doctor without lots of practice and inevitably that means you’ll kill someone.
Accept it. Over your lifetime, your worth as a doctor will be determined not
by your early errors but by the sum of what you do.” If that’s true for doctors,
183
Chapter 4: Making Your Career Choice

it’s probably even truer for you — I suspect that your errors won’t kill anyone.
Remember, every newbie scrambles. Key to success then is to stop stewing
and start acting.
Compare your options against the status quo
Instead of judging your candidate career(s) against some abstract ideal, write
the advantages and disadvantages of your candidate career versus the status
quo. The right choice often comes clear.
The Judge Judy technique
Pretend you’re a lawyer and give all the reasons why Career A is better. Then
pretend you’re the opposing attorney and give the reasons why Career B is
better. Finally, be Judge Judy and render a decision.
Try out your new career as a sideline
Unsure whether your new career will work? Charlie liked the idea of produc-
ing videos of playful interviews with employees for showing at company par-
ties. Charlie started his video business as a sideline, not wanting to quit his
job until he was sure he could make money at his new pursuit. He wins either
way: If he’s successful, he can, with confidence, quit his job and go full time; if
not, he still has his job.
Give yourself a trial period
Can you make it as a singer? Will that pizza-by-the-slice business be worth-
while? Reduce your risk by giving your new venture a fixed amount of time.
On your calendar, circle a date, perhaps a year from now. If, by then, you
don’t see signs you’ll succeed in your new endeavor, drop it. Limiting your
risk can give you the courage to give it a shot.
184
Part I: Finding Your Cool Career, Right Here 
How I made a career decision
I was teaching graduate students at Berkeley
when I realized I’d never be happy as a profes-
sor. I am practical at heart. I wouldn’t be content
in a career in which my primary task was to pub-
lish esoteric articles in the Journal of Educational
Psychology, but I couldn’t think of a career that
really excited me. The best I could come up with
was career counseling, but that felt just okay.
I nonetheless took the plunge. In the beginning
I was unhappy and asked myself why. The job
was too passive; I was sitting and listening most
of the time. So I adopted a more active style, but
the job still needed more spice, so I volunteered
to host a weekly radio show on careers and
education. That opened the door to the other
cool things I now get to do.
Molding my career to fit me converted a so-so
career into a happy one. I truly am eager to get
up each weekday morning — well, most week-
day mornings. If I had remained a professor until
I found a career that excited me right off the bat,
I might still be waiting.

Choose more than one career
Can’t decide? Choose more than one (for example, a part-time tutor, copy-
writer, actor, and bartender). Having multiple careers can be exciting, but
you’d better be a quick study and enjoy long hours. For some people, that
doesn’t work. It’s hard enough to succeed in one career.
Choose a less radical option
Not sure it’s worth tackling a totally new career? Choose a less radical option:
 Tweak your current job. (See Chapter 11.) Many people who think they
need a new career can solve their problem by changing bosses, renegoti-
ating their responsibilities, or improving their skills.
 Find a new job in your current career. Maybe a different organization’s
culture can cure your workplace woes.
 Find a different niche within your current career. Sick of being a biolo-
gist in a lab? Try field-based biology. The Cool Careers Yellow Pages in
Chapter 2 lists neat niches in many careers.
 Stay in the same industry but change job titles. Or change industries
but keep the same job title.
 Find more meaning outside of work. Pursue a hobby that allows for
self-expression; do volunteer work; fall in love.
A Final Check: Is Your Choice 
Right for You?
It’s time. You’ve reviewed lots of careers and picked the one that feels best.
Now it’s time for a final check: Does your career have all five signs of being
right for you?
1. Can you, within an acceptable amount of time, acquire the knowledge
and skills to succeed in this career?
If you’re unsure, ask someone in the field to review your previous
efforts. Or try to understand an introductory textbook, or find someone
to teach you a bit of the field’s essentials. Are you getting it?
2. Can you get the time and money to train for this career?
Before rejecting a career on this basis, read Chapters 5 and 6, which
describe cost- and time-effective ways to get the training you need. And
if you’re thinking of starting a business, Chapter 13 shows ways to get
the cash flowing quickly.
185
Chapter 4: Making Your Career Choice

3. Will this career likely sustain your interest?
Picture yourself in this career for five years. Are you likely to feel good
about having chosen it?
4. Are you likely to enjoy working in this career’s environment?
For example, at home? Outdoors? In an office?
5. Are you likely to enjoy the typical people interactions in this career?
If so, congratulations. Sounds like you’ve found a cool career!

magine how you’d feel knowing you’re an expert who can be counted on to
do the job wonderfully. Nothing is more central to career satisfaction.
Of course, key to becoming an expert is good training. This chapter helps you
figure out whether you need a degree at all. More often than you may sus-
pect, you can find wiser ways to prepare for your career. This chapter even
shows you how to convince an employer to hire you over someone with more
degrees. But as good as non-degree training can be, it’s certainly not right for
everyone. Ready for a back-for-a-degree stint? Chapter 6 can help.
The Bad and the Good about 
Pursuing a Degree
Today, many people view a degree as a magic pill. Sometimes it is, and some-
times it isn’t. The following sections will help you decide whether you should
take that pill.

Lousy reasons to get a degree
If you have a good reason, going back for a degree can be a fine idea. Alas,
many people don’t have a good reason. Here are some classic lousy reasons:
 To help decide what career to pursue: Mistake. Most degree programs
expose you to only a fraction of the career options. Far better to choose
your career using the approach in Part I of this book.
 To postpone looking for a job: Part III of this book shows you how to
land a rewarding job without undue pain. No need to spend years and
megabucks to postpone that.
 Because you think it will lead to a good job: Find out whether a degree
is absolutely necessary. By informational interviewing, you can find out
whether there’s more than one way to reach your goal.
 To impress friends and family: Can’t you think of less costly and time-
consuming ways to do that? How about landing a good job years sooner
than if you had gone for a degree?
 To feel legitimate: In many fields, you can more legitimately prepare for
your career away from the halls of academe, at what I call You U.: a self-
and mentor-selected combination of articles, seminars, professional con-
ferences, the Internet, and on-the-job training. Don’t commit years of
your life and lots of money just to create the illusion of legitimacy —
sometimes what a degree mainly provides.
 To dazzle employers: In many fields, your boss is likely to be more
impressed with a well-designed You U. education than with a diploma
that both of you know doesn’t mean that you’re career competent. Later
in this chapter, I show you how to dazzle employers more legitimately.
Good reasons to get a degree
Of course, there are good reasons to pursue a degree:
 For your enlightenment. A degree program can help you become an
informed citizen and to experience life more richly.
 Some fields absolutely, positively require a degree. For example, if you
want to be a physician, the state isn’t going to let you treat patients just
because you had a mentor. In fields like engineering, management con-
sulting, investment banking, and at top law firms, employers generally
ignore applicants who aren’t waving a prestigious diploma.
 Your efforts to effect a career change without going back to school
have failed. You hate your current career, so before springing for the big
bucks and time for a degree, you’ve taken seminars and networked in
your target field’s professional association, sought out mentorships,
190
Part II: Training for That Cool Career 

read relevant stuff, redone your resume to emphasize your transferable
skills, and cold-contacted dozens of potential employers in your target
career, yet everyone’s telling you that you need a degree.
 You need the structure of school. To design and follow through on a
You U. education, you must be a real self-starter, even if you have a
mentor. (I show you how to find one later in this chapter.) Many people
need the structure of school: Be there from 7 to 9 p.m. on Tuesdays and
Thursdays; read pages 246 through 384 by next Monday; write a term
paper as follows; take the final on December 20, from 2 to 4 p.m.
 You want the consistent social contact that comes from meeting from 
7 to 9 every Tuesday and Thursday night.
More reasons to save your tuition money
Many people recognize the drawbacks of getting a degree, yet they insist it’s
worth the time and money because of what the piece of paper, the diploma,
can do for them. Will that be true for you?
When I think about my 2,000+ degree-holding clients, despite their spending
all that time and money on degrees, many feel like imposters in their careers.
That’s far more psychologically damaging than having acquired competence
while lacking only a piece of paper that attests to it. Higher education may be
a reasonable way to become a connoisseur of life, but if your goal is to advance
your career, in many fields, I’ve become convinced that higher education is
among the most overrated, overpriced products of all.
Yes, people with degrees earn more than people without degrees, but that
doesn’t mean the degree is the main reason. They earn more mainly because
degree seekers, on average, are more able and motivated to begin with. If you
locked degree seekers in a closet for four years, they’d likely earn more than
people who don’t pursue degrees.
True, many employers place want ads that specify a degree. But if you write
an application letter like the one I recommend in the later section “Convincing
Employers to Hire You without That Degree,” many employers will consider
you, just as they may consider a candidate who lacks some other job require-
ment stated in the want ad. Mightn’t it be worth trying to land that job without
the degree? If it doesn’t work, you can go back to school with greater confi-
dence that you really do need that degree.
In her book, Success Without College, New York Times editor Linda Lee cites a
Newsweek article by Robert Samuelson that says, even “going to Harvard or
Duke won’t automatically produce a better job and higher pay. Graduates of
these schools generally do well. But they do well because they are talented.”
The article was titled, “The Worthless Ivy League.”

Some bad news
The Phi Delta Kappan, a prestigious education
periodical, provided this discouraging information:
A Rand Corporation report concluded that
new doctoral degrees in science and engi-
neering average 25 percent above appropri-
ate employment opportunities. A National
Science Foundation study found a 41 per-
cent oversupply of PhDs in the supposedly
in-demand electrical engineering field and a
33 percent oversupply in civil engineering.
Rand charged that universities are oblivious
to the job market. . . .
Thousands from other professions face 
the same situation. Even graduates from
America’s most prestigious business schools
are finding no guarantee of a job. An 
amazing 16 percent of newly minted MBA
graduates of Stanford University were
unable to find jobs. Less prestigious busi-
ness schools fared even worse: 40 percent
of the graduates of Ohio State’s business
school could not find jobs; the figure for the
University of Georgia was 30 percent; for
the University of Texas at Austin 24 percent;
and for Tulane University 24 percent.
Experts project that of the millions of uni-
versity graduates, only a mere 20 percent
will find the well-paying, challenging jobs
for which they were trained.
That article was written in 1997. Now, graduate
schools admit even more students at the same
time as companies are offshoring ever more
high-level jobs.

But you need to know one of higher education’s dirty secrets. Colleges’ Web
sites usually trumpet the careers possible with a given major. This informa-
tion misleads readers into thinking that if they spend the years and money,
they’ll land one of those careers. Here’s the truth: In many fields, as you’ll
now see, nowhere near enough jobs exist for the number of degree holders.
For example, I was sitting in one of the executive suites in the Time-Life Building,
meeting with four editors of one of Time-Warner’s major magazines. In the
course of conversation, someone said, “It’s obscene what these schools of
journalism are doing. They’re accepting millions of students into their jour-
nalism programs knowing full well that 90 percent of them will never make
more than McWages from journalism.” Everyone nodded.
You U. — Often a Better Way
In more fields than you may think, motivated people can use an approach to
career preparation that offers a greater payoff than pursuing a degree. I call it
You University. At You U., you, perhaps with the help of a mentor you select,
decide what you want to learn and then design a plan to learn it (see the fol-
lowing section for more details).
One of my clients, Phillip, wanted to learn how to create partnerships
between corporations and schools. Instead of going back for a largely misfit-
ting master’s in education or business, he did a You U. “master’s.” How, you
ask? He simply followed these steps:
1. Phillip searched the Net for articles on business-education partnerships.
2. He interviewed, by phone, people at companies involved in those part-
nerships. One person suggested materials he should read and men-
tioned an upcoming conference on business-education partnerships.
3. At the conference, our hero attended sessions, spoke with experts, vis-
ited the vendor booths, and found out about an on-target newsletter and
an Internet discussion group. He also visited corporations with model
school programs.
Now, imagine you’re a corporate employer looking for someone to develop a
program with local schools. Would you rather hire someone with a master’s
in education, or someone like Phillip, who attended You U.? Good choice.
Phillip got hired as a school liaison by a large telecommunications company.
Here’s another example: When prominent nature recording artist Jonathon
Storm decided to switch from pursuing an architecture degree to becoming a
recordist, instead of changing majors, he left school to learn directly from a
master. He contacted the nation’s leading nature recordist and asked to study
personally with him. Today, Jonathon is a master.
193
Chapter 5: Degree-Free Career Preparation

Just look at these differences between degree programs and You U:
 Starting with the basics, in a degree program, you must show up at spec-
ified times at that not-so-nearby university — assuming you can get a
babysitter and afford the tuition.
In a degree program, you’re taught by PhD types, theoreticians often out
of touch with the practical knowledge people preparing for a career need
most. Worse, you’re stuck with whichever professors happen to be at that
college.
 In contrast, if you attend You U., you’re taught by precisely the right sort
of people. Whether you’re looking to become a graphic designer, a sky-
scraper developer, or whatever, you can probably find a master practi-
tioner somewhere in the world willing to mentor you for a fraction of the
cost of college tuition. (See the following section for ways to find one.)
You can take workshops taught by some of your field’s leading practi-
tioners. Searchable, online databases offer plenty of these learning
opportunities in every imaginable field.
And if you are looking for theoretical knowledge to round out your edu-
cation, books, audiotapes, and videotapes allow you unlimited access,
24/7, to the world’s best theorists. For example, The Teaching Company
(www.teachco.com) sells CDs and DVDs of hundreds of liberal arts
courses taught by some of the best professors at the most prestigious
colleges.
Plus, if you want or need the contact of on-campus college courses, at
You U., you’re not limited to only one campus. You can find the best pro-
fessor in your locale for each course. In major cities, you have a number
of universities to choose from. (There are many ways to find the good
professors. For example, most colleges publish a list of their teaching
award winners and/or post the student evaluations of faculty.)
You U. is beyond comparison with regular degree programs, but I do it anyway
in Table 5-1. Before heading back for a degree at State U. — let alone Big Bucks
Private U. — ask yourself whether the smart choice might not be You U.

Planning Your You U. Education
Planning your own education is simpler than you may think, as I show you in
the following sections.
Finding a mentor
Start by finding a mentor who is an expert in your field, someone who can
suggest resources, ensure you’re covering enough of the bases, and answer
your questions. Expect to compensate your mentor with money or by volun-
teering as her assistant. Sometimes though, people, especially older folks,
will mentor you for free. Many people 50-plus want to pass on their wisdom
to the next generation.
195
Chapter 5: Degree-Free Career Preparation

Where to find a mentor:
 Someone in your field whom you already know, like, and respect.
 At a meeting of your field’s professional association. Some such associa-
tions have formal mentoring programs.
 Posting a request for a coach on your field’s Internet discussion group.
 Calling SCORE, the Service Corps of Retired Executives (www.score.org).
 The Yellow Pages. Open the Yellow Pages to the appropriate category
and dial until you find the right person.
 Someone who supervises interns. Don’t know of anyone? www.riley
guide.com/intern.html is a portal to databases of internships.
 That unusual professor with enough practical knowledge to coach you.
 Post a flyer at the local senior center or an ad in its newsletter.
No need to limit yourself to one mentor; different people provide different
expertise and opinions. Besides, you don’t want to overtax your mentor.
Figuring out what to learn
When talking with a potential mentor, ask this question: “I’m trying to learn 
X, Y, and Z, using books, articles, the Internet, CDs, DVDs, and seminars. Any
titles you’d particularly recommend?” In addition to asking your mentor(s),
you can pose this question to other professionals in the field. Additional
ideas can come from
 A respected member of your professional association
 Your association’s Web site
 Public, college, or corporate libraries and their librarians
Surveying sources of courses
Consider local colleges’ extension programs and regular colleges that focus
more on students than on research.
Some people are more satisfied with online classes. As long as you’re a self-
starter (and not tempted to cheat), they’re fast, at-home convenient, and less
expensive. They also offer other advantages:
196
Part II: Training for That Cool Career 

 With tens of thousands of choices from one-hour quickies to semester-
long comprehensives, you can pick an online class on the right topic and
in the right length for you. With online classes, you choose what you
want instead of what your local university is selling that semester.
 Before signing up, you can check out an online class’s quality more
easily than with a live course — many such courses offer a demo. You
can check out five courses in an hour without leaving home. The quality
of online classes is especially variable. Do check out a course carefully
before paying your money.
 Online classes usually allow you to set your own pace. (That’s an advan-
tage and a disadvantage. Procrastinators beware!)
 Increasingly, online classes are more interactive, often including simula-
tions, demonstrations, and e-mail discussion groups. (You’ll want a high-
speed Internet connection for video-centric classes.)
 When a question is asked, you get to answer it, without embarrassment,
unlike in a live class where only the called-upon student does.
 You can replay (and fast forward!) video-based classes as often as you
like. Try fast-forwarding a live instructor!
 You can attend class in your slippers.
These resources offer a treasure trove of distance- and in-person learning
opportunities:
 Peterson’s Online Learning (www.lifelonglearning.com): A data-
base of credit-bearing distance learning courses offered through 
universities.
 Globewide Network Academy (www.gnacademy.org): A database of
32,000 courses and 6,000 programs.
 Distance Education Clearinghouse (www.uwex.edu/disted/catalogs.
cfm): A portal to directories of distance learning courses and programs.
 The Small Business Administration (www.sba.gov): This federal
agency offers many courses for current and aspiring businesspeople.
How’d you like to put a prestigious college’s name on your resume after
attending class for just a few days and without undergoing a rigorous admis-
sions process? Most designer-label and other colleges allow the public to
take in-person or online seminars, workshops, and often, full courses. It’s the
easiest, fastest route to getting Harvard onto your resume.

Scoping out other learning tools
Here are additional effective learning techniques you can use in You U.:
 The book and the article are among the most underrated learning tools.
You can often find on-target readings simply by visiting your professional
association’s Web site, googling for articles, and checking out amazon.com
for books. Using those tools, in just a few minutes, you will have searched
millions of books and articles to find the right ones for you. Now tell me
that’s not cool.
 Another time-effective learning method is the tutor. For example, rather
than taking a course in Java, get a study manual and have a tutor start
you off. Then keep a list of questions and problems, and use that as the
basis for the next tutoring session. Sources of tutors: your workplace,
your professional association or discussion group, community college
instructors, and tutor.com.
 Another practical approach to career training is to buy it as part of a
franchise. Look for companies that have a proven system, have been in
business at least five years before franchising, have been franchising for
at least five years, and have at least ten franchisees. For a searchable
database of franchises, see www.entrepreneur.com/franzone.
Convincing Employers to Hire 
You without That Degree
Imagine that you’re an employer. Do you consider the candidate who wrote
the letter in Figure 5-1?

I’ll bet the house on this: The decline of in-person
college for adult students
I’m convinced that the bricks-and-mortar col-
lege’s heyday for adult students is over. In-
creasingly, online learning — getting your
knowledge on a just-in-time basis with at-home
convenience — puts that 7 to 9 p.m. Tuesday
and Thursday, campus-based class to shame.
And high-speed Internet brings to your home
videos of top teachers augmented by interac-
tive simulations.
I’m even more certain that online classes fea-
turing video lectures from national-star profes-
sors will largely replace that backbone of
traditional college education: the large lecture
class. I’ll bet the house that, within a decade,
the large in-person lecture class will be as
obsolete as the cigar-smoking fad.

Dear Ms. Hirer,
When you’re inundated with applications, it’s tempting to weed out those without a 
prestigious MBA, but I believe I’m worth a look precisely because I don’t have any 
MBA.
I considered getting an MBA, but after talking with a number of MBA holders and 
examining the courses I would have to take and their relevance (or, too often, lack 
thereof) to becoming a fine software marketing manager, I concluded that the two 
full-time years could be more profitably spent.
I contacted directors of marketing at leading Silicon Valley software companies and 
offered to work for them for no pay in exchange for their mentoring. I figured that 
was cheap tuition for the on-target learning I would receive. A marketing manager 
at HP took me on. After three months, I felt I had learned about as much from him as 
I could, whereupon I made a similar arrangement with a director of marketing at 
Cisco Systems.
In these apprenticeships, I was deeply involved in a number of projects similar to 
those mentioned in your ad, specifically Internet marketing and managing a national 
consumer branding campaign. In addition, I attend American Marketing Association 
conferences, read the best articles and books recommended by the AMA, and 
spend much of my commute time listening to relevant books on CD. To get the 
bigger picture, I even read a couple of books by leading academics.
But now comes the moment of truth. In choosing a self-directed education over a 
traditional one, I believe I prioritized substance over form. Now the question is: Will 
you interview me?
I hope that you’ll appreciate my having developed an outside-the-box learning plan, 
that I was assertive enough to make it happen, and persistent enough to see it 
through to completion without a professor and deadlines forcing me to do so. 
Perhaps more important, in working at the elbow of top hardware marketing 
executives, I learned a tremendous amount about how to do the job well.
I recently discussed my You U. education with an MBA holder from Stanford, and he 
said that I probably learned more of real-world value than he did.
I’m hoping you will call me for an interview, but as any good employee, I won’t just 
passively wait. If I haven’t heard from you in a week, I will take the liberty of 
phoning to follow up.
I enclose samples of the deliverables I produced during my work at HP and Cisco.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Christopher Wah

This letter makes clear that the candidate both learned more of practical
value than in most graduate programs and, perhaps more important, was a
take-charge person — precisely what many employers look for in an
employee with an advanced degree.
Would you interview Christopher? Even if other applicants had Ivy League
degrees? During a speech, I asked the 300-person audience that question.
Almost everyone raised his or her hand. On my radio show, I asked the same
question of the associate dean of the U.C. Berkeley Business School, and even
he agreed that he’d interview Christopher.
Engaging in Lifelong Learning
Lifelong learning has become a cliché, and it can sound exhausting — forever
upgrading yourself until you retire. But there’s an upside. In past generations,
after years on the job, many people felt bored — like they had been there,
done that. There always have been new things you can learn, but now to sur-
vive, you probably must learn them. Consider staying permanently enrolled in
You U. That can mean one or more of the following:
 Join or form a group of your peers that connects live or electronically, to
discuss problems and solutions.
 Don’t let the monthly issues of the magazine from your professional
association stack up.
 Attend at least one professional conference a year.
 Find one or more mentors. Times have changed. A mentor/protégé rela-
tionship used to be a one-at-a-time, time-intensive deal. Today, such a
relationship is likely to be more fluid. You call with a question, exchange
e-mails on a new development, and occasionally commiserate over a cup
of coffee. Ideally, you’ll have a few mentor relationships, some in which
you’re the mentor, others in which you’re the protégé.

A
t its best, a back-for-a-degree stint in school can be a blast: Taking time
out from the real world, learning stuff you’re really interested in, meet-

who takes you under wing and lines up a cool job for you after graduation.
That ideal is too rarely realized, but this chapter shows you how to maximize
your chances.
You may be able to land a cool job without going to school; in fact, I recom-
mend trying this option before you opt for a college or grad school stint.
Check out Chapter 5 for more details on degree-free career preparation.
Choosing the Right Program
When going back to school, finding the right program is usually more impor-
tant than finding the right college. Here’s how to do just that.
Identify your career niche
Don’t make the mistake of thinking to yourself, “I’ll choose my career niche in
school.” That rarely happens, or if it does, you’re usually choosing based on
unimportant criteria such as “that professor’s course was interesting.”

So please choose a career niche before choosing the institutions to apply to.
The Cool Careers Yellow Pages in Chapter 2 describe neat niches for hundreds
of careers. Need more help? Read, and talk with people in your field. Chapter
4 gives you guidance on doing research and contacting people.
Identify programs in your niche
Here are some ways to find the right program for you:
 Massive searchable databases of degree programs are offered through
Web sites like Petersons.com, gradschools.com, and
www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/tools/search.php. The
latter has a separate database of all the nation’s community colleges. A
community college can often be a smart choice for career preparation —
even if you already have a bachelor’s or graduate degree.
 Compare offerings at your local colleges by visiting their Web sites.
 Your field’s professional association may list relevant programs.
 The military offers top training for a wide range of careers. And not only
is it free, but you also get paid to learn. See
www.militarycareers.com.
That should take care of your initial screening, but how do you find a great
program and one that’s right for you? Read on.
Assess the program’s quality
Talk with graduating students or with recent graduates. Talking with its cus-
tomers is a great way to assess a program’s quality.
How can you do this? If the college is far away, you may be able to e-mail stu-
dents through the college’s Web site. If it’s nearby, sit in on an advanced class
that includes students who have almost finished the program. At the end of
class, go up to a group of students and ask, “Do you like the program?” and
“What are the best and worst things about it?”
How do you get to sit in on a class? Just phone or e-mail the instructor and
ask permission.
When you contact the instructor, ask questions such as, “What should I know
about the program that might not be in the official program description?” or
“What’s this program’s actual average time to completion?” Some programs
report the “expected” time to completion, but not the time it takes the aver-
age student, which can be years longer.
202
Part II: Training for That Cool Career 

Also, find recent graduates of the program in the alumni directory, which is
often available on the college’s Web site. If it’s not there, ask the department’s
administrative assistant to persuade a few recent graduates to phone you.
Recent grads are in a great position to assess their degree program’s value.
Read through the official materials
Although a college’s Web site is the electronic equivalent of a sales brochure,
you can usually find much of value there. For instance:
 Find out whether a program’s emphasis matches your interests. You
don’t want a psychology master’s program that focuses on Freudian
theory when you think it’s a bunch of hooey.
 How many full-time professors teach in the program? A small depart-
ment can mean too few choices.
 Do the required courses sound interesting? How about the assignments?
Will the workload allow time for respiration? To find out, check syllabi.
They’re often on the college’s Web site or available from the department
administrative assistant.
Calculate the program’s true cost
The listed tuition may be irrelevant. As on an airplane, passengers pay differ-
ent amounts. To find out how much you’ll pay, before applying, describe your
situation to a financial aid officer at the college, and get a written estimate of
how much aid you’re likely to get that is cash, not a loan. Don’t like the
answer? Contact the head of the program to which you’re applying. See
“Finding the Money,” later in this chapter, for more about paying for school.
Finding the Right College or Grad School
Many people choose a car more carefully than a college. Would you buy a car
without a good test drive or reading Consumer Reports? Colleges seem so dif-
ficult to judge that many college shoppers shrug their shoulders and rely
mainly on the institution’s brand name: “Harvard has a great name, so it must
be good,” or “The Harvard name on my diploma will get me a good job.”
Not necessarily.
Before I explain, I feel the need to establish my bona fides here as an expert
in higher education. After all, this is a career guide, not a college guide. What
I’m about to say is so contrary to what you’ve been led to believe that if I
don’t establish credibility upfront, I fear you’ll dismiss my advice out of hand.
My PhD from Berkeley specialized in the evaluation of education programs,
203
Chapter 6: Degree-Based Career Preparation

and Berkeley subsequently went on to hire me to teach education evaluation
in its Graduate School of Education. I have written three well-reviewed books
on higher education and have been a consultant to 15 college presidents.
ABC-TV, in its summit on education, introduced me as being “among the
nation’s leading education consumer advocates, the Ralph Nader of
Education.”
Okay, enough of that. Now, onto why you may well want to turn down
Harvard, even if you can get in.
The problem is that most brand-name colleges derive their prestige from
their research, not the quality of education they provide. They hire and pro-
mote faculty based mainly on how much research they can publish (usually
in a tiny, arcane area), with little regard to how well they teach. Such profes-
sors are ideal if you want to become a professor, but not otherwise.
I can hear you now — “But the brand name on my diploma will open career
doors!” Yes, a designer label on a diploma is a plus in the job market. But top
students may get an at-least-equal advantage by attending a less prestigious
college because they’re more likely to get practical rather than theoretical
instruction, top grades, personal attention, leadership opportunities, and top
letters of recommendation.
My own daughter was admitted to Williams College, one of the nation’s 
hardest-to-get-into colleges. Instead, she opted for a less selective (and less
expensive) one. Because she was able to excel there, she was noticed by her
professors, one of whom gave her a tip on a job in the White House. She
ended up working for almost a year in Hillary Clinton’s research office. (We
have a cool picture of her with Hillary on our living room wall.) Bonus: She
got a scholarship she wouldn’t have received at a more prestigious college.
Lest you think my daughter is an exception, more than half of the CEOs of
America’s 50 largest corporations received their college degrees at public
universities. Although making career connections is easier at a prestigious
college, and one does grow from spending four years around the best and
brightest, as you’ll see, many, many students, having mortgaged their finan-
cial security and that of their parents by attending expensive private colleges
or graduate schools, end up feeling disillusioned, even ripped off.
You may protest: “But look at the most successful people! So many came
from places like Harvard and Yale.” Yes, Ivy graduates are disproportionately
represented in top positions, but that doesn’t mean the institution caused
that. On average, Ivy-caliber students are smarter, come from better schools,
and have brighter, better-connected parents. You could lock top students in a
closet for those college or grad-school years, and on average, they’ll end up
with better careers than other people.

A study reported in the American Economic Review concluded that even in
terms of earnings, “What matters most is not which college you attend, but
what you did while you were there. . . . Measured college effects are small,
explaining just 1 to 2 percent of the variance in earnings.” Important things to
do while you’re in school include selecting a major such as engineering or
computer science, choosing professors carefully, getting to know them,
making the most of classes and assignments, and finding leadership opportu-
nities. More on all these topics in the section “Making the Most of the School
You Choose,” later in the chapter.
Loren Pope, in Colleges That Change Lives, wrote that 35 years after gradua-
tion, “The New York Times reported that a quarter of Harvard’s class of 1958
had lost their jobs, were looking for work, or on welfare, just when their
careers should have been cresting. . . . Many in the class of ’58 thought their
degrees ensured career success. They were wrong. ‘The autobiographical
sketches written for the 35th reunion did not radiate with expressions of suc-
cess and optimism,’ said author and Yale professor Erich Segal. ‘Quite the
contrary, they seemed like a litany of loss and disillusion.’ And Harvard was
not alone. Alumni groups at other Ivy League schools, the author added, ‘are
reporting that their members in growing numbers are suffering from the
upheavals in corporate America.’ If there is a lesson in all this it is that a
degree from a college like Harvard is no longer the lifetime guarantee of suc-
cess in careers that it used to be.”
Despite the fact that you can get a good education at non-brand-name col-
leges, many people choose the most renowned college they can get into. It’s
understandable. Designer-label colleges attract smart students, so chances
are, something will rub off. And some employers — investment banking firms,
for instance — tend to round-file resumes from applicants without a “Top 25”
diploma. Even with other employers, you may ask, “If I go to Who Knows U.,
how will I compete in the job market against graduates of Brand-Name U.?”
Fact is, the job search strategies in Part III, which most people don’t use, can
fully compensate for the advantage of a brand-name diploma.
205
Chapter 6: Degree-Based Career Preparation
The easiest way into a prestigious degree program
Many prestigious colleges offer a program that
makes gaining admission to a bachelor’s degree
program far easier for people with nontraditional
backgrounds (working adults, child geniuses,
and so on). These special programs aren’t well
publicized, so knowing their specific names is
helpful. Harvard: Extension School. Yale: the
Special Studies Program. Penn and Columbia:
School of General Studies. Georgetown: Liberal
Studies Program.

Getting in
Only a small percentage of undergraduate programs are difficult to get into.
Fact is, most are 98.6 schools — all you need to get in is normal body temper-
ature. (I’m exaggerating only somewhat.) Too, admission to many graduate
programs is easier than you might think.
As I’ve been stressing, just because a college is difficult to get into, doesn’t
mean that it’s better. I liken a designer-label school to a Mercedes. It has a
prestigious name and costs a fortune, but ironically, it’s more of a hassle
(requires more maintenance and has more frequent breakdowns) than inex-
pensive cars with less exotic names. I must admit to feeling a certain pleasure
driving along in my Toyota and seeing some fru-fru fussmobile broken down
along the side of the road.
The hassles with selective colleges start with getting in but don’t stop there.
Professors at selective colleges are likely to care more about their research
than about their students. The high concentration of star students also
instills fear, inhibiting many students from speaking up in class and turning
them into studyholics. Harvard’s student health center reported that the
second most common student complaint is stress and burnout.
When you were a teenager, you may have been more likely to fall in love with
someone because he or she played hard to get. By now, you realize that’s
foolish. Please apply that mature thinking when choosing a college or grad
school. Many people aspire to be admitted to hard-to-get-into colleges mainly
because they’re hard to get into. Far better to fall in love with a college
because of what it is, not how hard-to-get it plays.
206
Part II: Training for That Cool Career 
My favorite place for adults to earn 
a credible degree quickly
Thomas Edison State College (phone: 609-
984-1150; www.tesc.edu): Called “one of the
brighter stars in higher education” by The New
York Times, the fully accredited TESC grants
extensive credit for prior learning, including
learning acquired through life experience. You
can complete your additional units through any
combination of exams, live courses, or distance
courses offered anywhere in the United States,
including TESC’s many self-study courses. To its
11,000 students, it offers associate, bachelor’s,
and master’s degrees. A TESC degree is well
regarded. For example, 90 percent of its bache-
lor’s graduates gain admission to their first
choice graduate school. The kicker is that TESC
is a public college, so the price is right.

It’s a buyer’s market. Because college selection is often name-driven rather
than quality-driven, many non-designer-label colleges and graduate schools,
including high-quality ones, can’t fill their classrooms — largely because their
diplomas don’t bear a brand name. The message to you is: Be picky. Most col-
leges — perhaps even those that will do you the most good — may want you
more than you want them.
Getting into killer colleges
Despite all my warnings, suppose you do want into one of the most selective
colleges, like Harvard or Yale. For starters, of course, you need top numbers.
An A-average or better and being in the 90th percentile or higher on The Test
(ACT, SAT, GRE, MCAT, LSAT, or so on) put you in the running. Most applicants
to designer-label institutions have numbers in that range, yet only a fraction
are admitted. Usually, it’s those who benefit the institution more. You say: “Me,
benefit a college?” Yes, you. Benefits fall into the following categories:
 The student has potential to do big things. Those institutions select
only the nation’s top applicants. Do your accomplishments suggest
potential to do big things, like invent something, become a CEO, or be
elected to high office? Does your admission essay convey ambition? Are
you so well connected (Daddy’s on the Ways and Means committee?)
that you’re likely to have a big impact? Your application, especially your
essay, must make a convincing case.
 The student is likely to particularly enrich the campus community.
• A true intellectual can invigorate classroom discussions.
• A person of color may lend a different perspective to discussions.
Some sorts of diversity, however, count less: An Appalachian, a
Chinese immigrant, or the child of a brilliant scientist is usually
viewed less enthusiastically than “underrepresented” minorities.
• A person (especially an undergrad) with the ability to play on var-
sity sports teams or to perform in campus music and drama offer-
ings improves the quality of the college’s offerings.
• An iconoclastic thinker is likely to present unconventional but
intelligent ideas in and outside of class. But be careful: Political
correctness is rampant on college campuses. Writing an applica-
tion essay advocating conservative ideas is risky.
 A professor wants the student. Here’s how you might make that happen:
You phone a professor who specializes in a topic of interest. At the end
of the conversation, you agree it would be great if you were the profes-
sor’s advisee and research slave. That professor — usually in response
to your request — writes a note about you to the admissions team. No
surprise, that boosts your chances of admission.
207
Chapter 6: Degree-Based Career Preparation

 The student’s family has given a bunch of money to the college. Those
students usually receive an edge in admission proportional to the size of
the bunch. Generally, this works better at private than at public colleges.
 The student is a fine fit for the program to which he’s applying. How
do those students benefit the college? If you choose a program because
its unusual aspects are just right for you, you’re likely to be satisfied and
thus more likely to donate money to the college. So if you’re applying to
Duke’s PhD program in biomedical engineering, explain the specific rea-
sons why you prefer it over its major competitor, Johns Hopkins.
Finding the Money
Adults, particularly applicants to graduate schools, have a tough time finding
financial aid because government formulas penalize working adults. It’s still
worth applying because you’ll probably get a government-guaranteed loan,
and you may use a lifelong learning tax credit, but unless you’re a real star or
underrepresented minority, don’t count on significant cash aid.
Get the financial aid applications early. Some colleges’ deadlines are almost a
year before the enrollment date. These deadlines are firm. Meet them.
Sometimes worth the effort is applying for a private scholarship — you know,
like the David Letterman Scholarship, which is reserved for students just like
Dave: C students at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. To find private
scholarships you may qualify for, use Fastweb.com, a database of 1.3 million
scholarships. Searching it will likely generate dozens of good fits, but it’s usu-
ally only worth applying for your few best shots. The odds of winning are
tiny, so applying for too many is usually a waste of time. If, however, you’re
Black, Latino, Native American, or a superstar, applying to 10 or 20 is worth-
while.
208
Part II: Training for That Cool Career 
Some test-prep advice: Choose a CD, not a course
A note about preparing for The Test (SAT, ACT,
GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or MCAT): If you’re self-
motivated, instead of taking a course, use a CD
such as How to Prepare for the GRE. Not only is
it $20 versus $1,000, but you also don’t waste
time getting to the test center, and you can have
a lesson whenever you want, 24/7. The CD indi-
vidualizes instruction so you don’t waste time on
stuff that’s too easy or too hard. In a course,
that’s particularly likely if you’re a non-average
scorer: below the 40th percentile or above the
90th percentile on a practice exam.

If you’re applying to graduate school, don’t just contact the institution’s
financial aid office; contact your specific department’s office. Often, it has
special funds.
A great source of info and links on financial aid is www.finaid.org.
Comparing the Deals
If you apply to more than one institution, before saying yes to one, carefully
compare financial aid offers:
 How much cash will you have to come up with?
 How big a loan will you have to pay back?
 If your income stays the same, will your cash award be renewed each
year, or after they have you, how likely is it that they’ll pull the plug?
If your award from your top-choice college seems too low, try to negotiate a
better deal. The key is to provide new data that can justify a new decision.
For example, can you say that other colleges have offered you better deals?
Or, point out that your financial picture isn’t as rosy as the financial aid form
makes it appear — you have big medical expenses, or your home needs
major repairs? Sometimes, sending an itemized budget can make your situa-
tion clearer.
209
Chapter 6: Degree-Based Career Preparation
Why is college so darn expensive, anyway?
Colleges keep raising tuition. When you count
all expenses, four years at a brand-name pri-
vate college costs $200,000! The government’s
response: urging us to start saving when Junior
is a fetus. Plus the government offers students
even more aid, which simply allows colleges to
raise tuition even higher — at taxpayer
expense.
Why is no one asking colleges to be more effi-
cient? For example, should professors really be
earning a nice salary and full benefits for teach-
ing two or three classes a semester and work-
ing on research that’s useless in the real world?
Why aren’t interactive video-based online
courses, taught by the nation’s best professors,
used instead of large lecture classes? That
would raise quality while lowering cost. For
more, see my article, Utopia College, at
www.martynemko.com.

Making the Most of the 
School You Choose
Two identical twins could enroll in the same program, yet one twin could
have a far better experience. Here’s how to make the most of yours.
Find good teachers
A good instructor can make medieval linguistics come alive, while a bad one can
turn Rock ’n’ Roll 101 into a snooze. When you enroll, be a savvy consumer:
 Pick the campus’s teaching award winners. The list is usually on the
college’s Web site or available through its office of academic affairs.
 Check student ratings of professors. Some colleges publish the results.
Check on the college’s Web site, but you may have to dig — some col-
leges aren’t that proud of the evaluations. Can’t find them? Call the office
of the campus’s student newspaper or student government.
 Ask the department’s administrative assistant. These assistants see the
faculty evaluations, and some may even give you an answer other than,
“All the professors are good.”
 Check out syllabi. Often they’re on the Web, or the department adminis-
trative assistant has them.
 Look at the required books in the bookstore. A great way to avoid
spending big bucks on textbooks you won’t read anyway.
 Get picks from students or TAs who’ve been around awhile. As with
any key purchase, it’s wise to talk with people who have bought it.
 Over-enroll. Plan to take three courses? Sign up for four, attend the first
session of each, and drop the worst one. Don’t put up with a professor
who sounds as bored as a class reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.
 Choose courses that help prepare you for your profession. Sure, take
that course in Sanskrit linguistics if (for some unimaginable reason) it
fascinates you, but in general, keep your eyes on the prize.
 When in doubt, choose the teacher rather than the course title.
European Epistemology taught by a great teacher is usually better than
Human Sexuality taught by a dud.

ask a question, make a comment. Of course, you’ll be hated if your hand is 
up all the time, so the next best way to be active is to ask yourself a question
every minute or so. For example, “What’s the real-world relevance of this?” 
or “How might I use this in my career?”
Choose your advisor well
A good advisor can help you find good professors, sign you on as an assis-
tant, become your career coach, line up job leads, ponder the meaning of life
with you, and make sure you don’t find out three days before you expect to
graduate that you’re missing Statistics 101. Before settling on an advisor, chat
with a couple of candidates whose specialization sounds interesting to you.
Look for one-on-one opportunities
Most people learn best in one-on-one situations. Beyond your advisor, look
for opportunities for one-on-ones — even on a one-time basis. See a prof
during an office hour, a peer advisor when you have a problem, or a student
who said something that aroused your interest.
Adapt assignments to fit you
Where possible, tie term papers and fieldwork assignments into your career
plans. If an assignment doesn’t turn you on, propose an alternative. You’ll be
surprised how often the prof says yes.

Chapter 6: Degree-Based Career Preparation

Build relationships with 
potential employers
The key to landing a good job after graduation is to develop relationships
with potential hirers while still in school. So, get fieldwork and internship
assignments at places you may want to be employed. And work hard to
impress the person there with the power to hire you.
Network at professional association meetings — they tend to be especially
welcoming of student members.
Also, while still in school, e-mail 10 or 20 potential employers, explaining that
you would love some advice on how to best prepare so that employers are
more likely to want to hire you after graduation.
Don’t take crap
A member of the orientation committee at Harvard gave the following advice
to incoming students. She advised, “Fix it. If you can’t, ask. If someone says
no, ask someone else.” If you think of this every time a problem arises, you’re
on the path to college happiness.
Succeeding in school after 40
Many older people contemplating a back-to-school stint worry:
 “I won’t be able to learn stuff as quickly as when I was younger.” For
some people, that’s true, for others not, but most older students have a
secret weapon: maturity. They’re more likely to put in the study time
and be efficient at it. That usually trumps any decline in learning speed.
And if you need help, professors and teaching assistants love when stu-
dents come in. In addition, many colleges offer special tutoring and
workshops for returning students. Another plus for you: Older students
are more likely to make wise contributions to class discussion, which
makes you a valued class member, and likely to get a good grade.
 “I’ll be the outsider among all those young people.” It’s true, at many
of the nation’s 100 designer-label colleges, most students are 17–22 and
some tend, foolishly, to look askance at older students. But most of the
nation’s 3,500 colleges enroll many adult students. In addition, to help
you find kindred spirits, many colleges offer special get-togethers for
adult students.

Chapter 7
Creating the Right Mindset 
for Job Seeking
In This Chapter
 Keeping your spirits up
 Beating a fear of failure
 Letting go of your anger
A
good mindset makes your job search more successful, maybe even bor-
derline fun. In this chapter, I discuss some ways to think about your job
search. The keys are learning how to stay upbeat, beat your fears, and get all
chips off your shoulder. Read on to find out how to do that.
Staying Upbeat
A job search is a medium-distance race. Get despondent after the first 100
yards, and you’re not going to win. This section shows you how to go the 
distance.
Pretend that you’re going to the mall
When you shop, you stroll the mall in search of treasure, asking salespeople
for tips. You try stuff on, most of which looks worse on you than on the rack,
but it’s still fun, like a costume party.
A job search is similar. You’re exploring a “mall”: your target career’s milieu.
You look around (by reading, searching the Net, phoning people in likely
workplaces, and visiting work sites — as I explain in Chapter 4), ask people
for directions to the areas within the “mall” that are most likely to have the
job you’re looking for, and sooner or later, you find something good.

Thinking of your job search as a mall visit helps create the right mindset:
only moderate preparation, plenty of exploration, meeting people, trying stuff
on, and enjoying the process, even if you don’t end up buying anything
(accepting a job offer) for a while.
Picture the benefit
How would your life be better if you got a job? List all the ways. Keep that list
on your desk. Look at it all the time. It’ll keep you going when those
inevitable rejections roll in.
Be playful yet persistent
Some of my most successful clients treat their job search like a game. The
motto: “Playful yet persistent.” Some experiences, such as a rejection by a
dream employer, are unavoidable energy drains, but most experiences are, at
least partly, under your control. For example, trying to make a cold call inter-
esting, even playful, can keep you upbeat, even if the call leads nowhere.
When the receptionist answers the phone, instead of saying, “Hello, ma’am. I
am seeking information about a possible position at your firm,” try this: “This
may be one of the weirder calls you’ve gotten in a while.” (The receptionist
usually laughs and/or says something like, “You wouldn’t believe the calls I
get.” If she says the latter, ask, “What’s the weirdest?”) Next, say, “Okay. Let
me tell you why I’m calling. I’ve heard great things about your company and I
think I would love to work there. Can you think of a nice person who might be
willing to talk with me?”
For more examples of making your job search interesting, even playful, see
Chapter 8.
Fake it ’til you make it
Sometimes, the key to feeling upbeat is to act the way you do when you’re not
ready to pull your hair out. In psychologist’s lingo, “Often, behavior change
precedes and causes attitude change.” In plain English: Fake it ’til you make
it. To do so while still being honest, pretend that you’re your best self: Think
of the hour in your life when you were most confident, most together.
Especially at key moments in your job search, pretend you’re that best self.
216
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

Be real
Being real may seem inconsistent with “fake it ’til you make it,” but it’s not. It
just means not overselling yourself. If you’re just a basic, good, hard worker,
describe yourself as just that.
If you’re not a star, don’t try to pass yourself off as one. The thought of
having to do all that B.S.ing will stress you out and make you more likely to
procrastinate in your search for work. You’ll probably sound unnatural and
therefore won’t be successful. And if, against all odds, you manage to bam-
boozle someone into thinking you’re more capable than you’re likely to be,
you risk failing on that job and making you and your boss miserable.
So don’t make a false impression. Sell who you really are. You’ll enjoy your
search for work more and be more likely to end up with work you’ll do well.
Besides — although increasingly this quality is seen to be unimportant — it’s
honest.
Be in the moment
The following phrase is key to contentment, even during your job search. The
phrase: Be in the moment. Stop thinking or looking back or ahead so much.
Instead, try to fully immerse yourself in every little task — whether it’s the
puzzle of deciding what to say in your resume or the challenge of convincing
a gatekeeper to let you talk with a prospective employer. At this moment, I’m
trying to enjoy the challenge of how to phrase this paragraph so it’s helpful
but not preachy. (I’m not sure I solved the preachy problem.) Taking life one
moment at a time — at least in my opinion — is key to a successful career
and a contented life.
Have six balls in the air
When you have a hot job lead, you may be tempted to stop your job search.
Fact is, the odds of a hot lead turning into a job are small. So, here’s a useful
rule of thumb: Have at least six balls in the air at all times. If one falls, find
another. Keep six balls in the air for a while and you’ll soon be able to stop
juggling.
Breathe
Whenever you feel stress, take one to ten deep breaths. Nothing so simple is
so potent. A breath
217
Chapter 7: Creating the Right Mindset for Job Seeking

 Increases oxygenation to your brain, thereby improving your thinking
power
 Relaxes your neck and torso muscles
 Gives you a break while requiring almost no time
Breathe. Do it now.
Get support
Sometimes, all the strategies in the world can’t generate enough fire in your
belly. Often, the answer is to gain energy from the support of others, ideally
fellow job seekers. Find job-search support groups through your state unem-
ployment department, chambers of commerce, or job search ministries at
churches. Here are some Web sites to start you off:
 For a nationwide database of support groups, see www.job-hunt.org/
job-search-networking/job-search-networking.shtml.
 A number of large cities have branches of the 5 O’Clock Club 
(fiveoclockclub.com), which offers, for a moderate fee, by-
phone or in-person support groups led by a professional trained 
in a job search methodology similar to what I advocate in this book.
 Have a few wrinkles? You may prefer a support group with fellow experi-
enced folks. If so, consider 40 Plus (40plus.org/links). Many state
unemployment offices offer similar groups.
Shrugging Off Fear of 
Rejection and Failure
Do you dread making contacts because you fear rejection and failure? See
whether adopting any of the following mindsets helps.
Make a solid effort, and 
you won’t be a loser
Are you afraid you seem like a loser if you ask people for job leads? The key
is how you think of it: You’re not desperate; you’re simply exploring to see
whether you can find a more satisfying worklife. People can respect you for
that. Many of them wish they had the guts to do the same.
218
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

Afraid you seem like a loser if you apply for a bunch of jobs and don’t get
one? All that means is that you’re applying for the wrong jobs — jobs in too
tight a market or for which you aren’t that qualified. There truly is a job for
almost everyone in the world — as long as you don’t give up before having
made a solid effort. The only thing that makes you a loser is giving up before
you really try.
Also, remember that your worth as a human being isn’t defined solely by how
successful you are in the work world. For whom do you have more respect: a
successful lawyer who’s sleazy at work and callous outside of work, or a dish-
washer who’s ethical at work and kind to everyone?
Recognize that you have skills
Sure, the want ads make it seem like every job requires you to be a techno-
geek, but the fact is that most jobs, especially nontechnical ones, aren’t
advertised. Many, many good jobs require mainly those generic skills we take
for granted: intelligence, people skills, organization, communication, and reli-
ability. Want two examples?
 David Wolper, who was the producer of Roots, the 1984 LA Summer
Olympic Games, and LA Confidential, and who brought Jacques Cousteau
to TV, admitted to me that his main skill was talking to people on the
phone.
 Recently, my wife, Dr. Barbara Nemko, was named her region’s Schools
Superintendent of the Year, beating out 100 competitors, and she insists
the key to her success is just plain common sense.
These examples aren’t exceptions. Thirty-eight million managerial positions
exist in the U.S., and most of them don’t require the ability to program in
Java, perform chemical assays, or create a blueprint using AutoCAD. They
mainly require some combination of people skills, organization, communica-
tion, reliability, integrity, and the ability to learn quickly. Don’t you have at
least some of those skills? So, go forth and show prospective employers that
you do.
Ask yourself “What would God think?”
Ask yourself, would God — or if you’re an atheist, your higher self — think
you should contact that potential employer? Knowing that even God would
urge you to go after that job can give you the strength to shrug off fear of
rejection.
219
Chapter 7: Creating the Right Mindset for Job Seeking

Think of your contacts as library books
When you’re at the library looking for information, you pick a book off the
shelf, glance through it, and if it isn’t helpful, you simply move on to the next
book. Try to think of each person you contact in your job search like a book
in the library. If one person isn’t helpful, simply go on to the next one, with
no more emotion spent than if that person were an unhelpful library book.
Know that batting .050 is good enough
The good news about a job search is that you need to find only one good job.
It’s not like baseball, in which you need a good batting average. I like Tom
Jackson’s description of a job search in Guerrilla Tactics in the Job Market:
NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.
NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.
NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. YES.
Stay cool
Imagine two gold miners. Each time the first miner tries a vein that turns out
to contain nothing but rock, he gets frustrated. The other miner, knowing he
needs to strike gold only once every 50 times to make enough money, stays
cool. Is there any question as to which miner ends up making more money?
Any question as to who is a happier person?
Pretend that rejection is a blessing
Look at a rejection as a blessing in disguise. It may keep you from a job that is
wrong for you. At least think that way.
Envision the worst that could happen
Picture the worst cases: embarrassing yourself in an interview for a cool job,
sending out a bunch of job applications and never hearing from any of the
employers, plugging away for six months and still not getting a job. Ask your-
self, in the larger scheme of things, even in that worst-case scenario, can you
survive? Can you develop a Plan B?
220
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

For folks who are 40-plus: Be 
proud of your experience
Many older workers especially fear rejection and failure, seeing them as confir-
mation that they’re over the hill. They may be insecure because they don’t look
as good as that 20-something hottie or aren’t as techno-savvy as people fresh
out of college who’ve been playing with technology since they were toddlers.
Those fears may be legitimate, but remember that employers hire thousands
of older people every day. And that’s not because employers are charitable.
Employers hire older people because older people have more experience,
which is a great teacher. Too, employers know that many older people are
more reliable: They may have a stronger work ethic and be less likely to
come to work exhausted (or call in sick) because they were up all night party-
ing or calming a crying baby. Yes, some employers may want younger
employees, but many others will appreciate you because you’re older. So,
wear your gray hair proudly. (Or dye it.)
Help yourself cure a deep-rooted 
fear of rejection
How you handle stressful situations, such as those that come up in a job
search, may be affected by your family. For example, as a child or spouse,
were you considered stupid? Made to feel guilty for speaking up? Expected to
live with scarcity? Disliked by your parents? Were your role models inade-
quate: For example, did you have a lazy or short-tempered spouse?
Solution: Every time you feel uncomfortable during your job search, in a
memo pad, write down
 What happened
 What you’re saying to yourself
 A family-rooted explanation for your feeling badly (if there is one)
 How you behaved as a result
 What, if anything, you want to do differently next time
Sometimes, fear of rejection is exacerbated by physiologically rooted depres-
sion. If, even in the absence of a specific problem, you persistently feel sad,
hopeless, guilty, and have a lack of interest in most activities, treatment — brief
cognitive therapy, increased exercise, plus a selected-for-you antidepressant —
can often be very helpful. For more on depression, check out www.nimh.nih.

Chapter 7: Creating the Right Mindset for Job Seeking

Getting That Chip off Your Shoulder
Upon probing, a number of my clients admit resenting having to look for a job:
 Some people are bitter that they were let go from a previous job. They
feel that less competent people were kept, yet they were fired. Or they’re
amazed that the employer had no loyalty despite their faithful service
and friendship.
 Other people think that with their qualifications, a job should practically
fall into their laps. Or they’ve had jobs fall into their laps before and
somehow expect it to happen again. Yes, jobs do fall into people’s laps,
but that can take months or even longer, and that random position is
unlikely to be as appropriate for you as a career goal you work hard to
select for yourself (see Part I of this book to do just that). Placing your
hopes on a great job descending on you like manna from heaven is risky.
 Still other people resent looking for a job because they’re frustrated that
finding something is taking so long. Fact: Even if you follow the 30-Days-
to-a-Cool-Job plan in Chapter 8, the average person takes a few months
to actually seal the deal. A job hunt, even when done well, is rarely a
sprint; it’s a medium-distance run. Knowing that upfront is better than
starting to sprint and fading after just a few days of hard work.
No matter how legitimate the reason, a chip on your shoulder hurts your
chances of landing a job. Even if you don’t actually say, “I’m angry!” people
know. The best advice I can give may sound unsympathetic and simplistic,
but here it is: If you want to land a job quickly, force yourself to get over it.
Don’t allow yourself even a moment of anger. It tends to build rather than
“get out of your system.”
If you can’t make yourself get over your anger, try this approach before
spending a dime on a shrink. Every time you become aware of a chip-on-your-
shoulder thought, in that instant, force yourself to replace the thought with a
constructive one. Ask yourself, “What’s the next one-second task I need to do
to line up the work I’m seeking?” That simple strategy works for many of my
clients. Frankly, I used that strategy every time I felt overwhelmed with the
task of writing this book.
222

Chapter 8
30 Days to a Cool Job
In This Chapter
 Making time to look for a job
 Knowing what to do, day by day
O
f course, there are no guarantees. If you’re ability-free and personality-
impaired, your job search can take years. But after refining the
approach in this chapter over the past 20 years and seeing it work so often, I
can look you in the eye and tell you that finding a good job in 30 days is a
realistic goal for most people — if you spend those 30 days wisely.
Certainly, many employers take their sweet time deciding which candidate to
hire, so after the 30-day mark, you may have to undergo additional interviews
or wait until funding has been approved, but after 30 days, you’ll have set all
the balls in motion.
Before getting started, convince a good nag (perhaps a relative or friend) to
allow you to give daily progress reports. The fear of having to answer the
inevitable question — “Well?!” — will help keep you on the program.
My colleague Libby Pannwitt urged me to add this statement: “Before begin-
ning, you must shut off all internal voices that say, ‘I can’t do that,’ ‘It’s scary,’
‘Eek,’ ‘Yes but,’ and so on.”
It’s going to be an intense 30 days, but well worth it. Just picture how you’ll
feel in that cool new job. Onward.
Finding the Time to Search
Most people, especially those working full time, wonder how they’ll find the
time to do a job search. The good news is that you can do a lot after work:
researching fields and employers, writing your resume and cover letters, even
interviewing for jobs. Most employers are willing to schedule interviews before
or after work, respecting that you don’t want to interview on company time.

Many people waste oodles of time on things they agree are less important
than finding a job. Examples:
 Watching TV.
 Phoning and visiting friends. (Is it really worth the time to go to your
cousin’s wedding in Topeka?)
 Time-sucking hobbies, such as golf, quilting, sports watching, or putter-
ing in the workshop or garden.
 Zoning out or reading a trashy novel on the commuter train or bus
instead of writing job-related letters on your laptop.
 Hanging out with family. Especially in the short-term, quality, not quan-
tity, family time is what’s important.
I’m not asking you to give up these activities forever, but landing a good job
can make your life so much better. Put in the 30 days and chances are good
that you’ll have a better life for years. Isn’t that a good deal?
I’m not going to lie to you: The first ten days or so (20 if you’re currently
working full time) will be intense but worth the effort:
 You’ll complete most of a job search’s yucky tasks in less than two
weeks. Just keep picturing that cool job you’ll get.
 Unlike when doing a job search in drips and drabs, you’ll build momen-
tum, finding yourself on a roll.
 Having made all your contacts in less than two weeks, you’ll have maxi-
mized the chances of receiving more than one job offer at around the
same time. Having that choice of job offers allows you to pick the one
with the best combination of good work, wise boss, pleasant environ-
ment, and reasonable compensation. Because of that, this short but
intense approach is more likely to lead to career contentment than even
having picked a cool career.
At first glance, this process may look complicated. But I promise you that if
you take it just a baby step at a time, it’s not only doable but also effective,
and maybe even sort of fun.
Day 1: Craft a Winning Resume 
and Research Your Field
The Internet will make creating your resume easier than you may think. Too,
the Net will help you identify important information about your field that,
even if you’re a newbie, will give you the patina of an insider.
224
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

Creating your resume
Create your resume using resumemaker.com ($29–$39). It walks you
through every step. When you use ResumeMaker, creating your resume is a
half-day task, one-day tops.
I find that people have only so much energy they’ll devote to a job search.
Waste more than a day on a resume and you’ll probably end up spending less
time on more important job-search activities.
When you start your resume, follow these guidelines:
 Decide on your job target. You can choose something specific (for
example, entry-level forensic accounting) or something more general
(for example, “a position requiring qualitative research skills”). General,
however, doesn’t mean, “I’m desperate. I’ll take anything.”
 Incorporate two or three brief PAR stories into your resume. A PAR
story includes a Problem you faced, the intelligent way you Approached
it, and its positive Resolution.
 If you’re just starting out, fill your resume with relevant accomplish-
ments at school and in after-school jobs.
 Incorporate praise quotes from bosses, peers, supervisees, or 
customers.
 Don’t worry whether it’s one or two pages, just fill as much space as
you can impressively and legitimately fill. Some people, usually later in
their careers, can even go three or four pages.
 Get feedback on a draft, ideally from people you know in your target
field.
Need more resume advice, like how to deal with the fact that you’ve been
unemployed for two years? See Chapter 9.
If you finish your resume before Day 1 is done, start on the task in the next
section. If not, start it tomorrow.
Studying your field of interest
Learn about your target industry or profession. It will be helpful in your sub-
sequent contacts with employers. Sources include the following:
225
Chapter 8: 30 Days to a Cool Job

 A portal to industry information is at www.careeronestop.org/
jobseeker/Jobseekers_info.asp#JobMarketInformation.
 Find professional and trade associations’ Web sites at www.asaecenter.
org/Directories/AssociationSearch.cfm and dir.yahoo.com/
Business_and_Economy/Organizations/Professional.
 The Web sites www.vault.com and www.wetfeet.com offer insider
guides to leading fields and companies.
 Google the industry or profession at google.com. Use Google’s Web
tab, News tab, and Groups tab.
 Search amazon.com’s database of three million books.
Spend just one to four hours on all this research. Like undue resume primp-
ing, more research on the profession or industry at this point is usually
overkill. (If you need more help with research, check out Chapter 4.)
Day 2: Concoct Your Pitch and Identify
Your Target Employers
This is the heart of the matter. Give the right pitch to enough of the right
employers, and you’re halfway home.
Coming up with a winning pitch
Craft a 10-second and a 45-second pitch. Each must explain why you’re look-
ing for a job, what you’re looking for, and proof that you’re good and will add
value for an employer.
 For example, a 10-second pitch may be: “The company downsized, I’ve
always gotten great evaluations, but that’s the way it goes. So I’m look-
ing for another graphics designer position where my efficiency will be
appreciated.”
 The 45-second pitch adds information about the kind of job you’re look-
ing for and provides credible evidence that you bring a lot to the table.
For instance: “When my boss had a client who needed something done
fast and well, he always gave me the job. For example, I remember the
time when United Way had their annual gala but had forgotten to create
the printed program. They called the day before the event saying all
they had was raw text and could anything be done? I stayed up until
midnight. The next morning, we sent it to the printer, and that night, a
program sat on everyone’s seat.”
226
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

But what if you’re just starting out? I can hear you wondering, “What could I
bring to the table?” Emphasize a skill or experience that would impress your
contact. Here’s an aspiring nurse’s 45-second pitch: “I loved nursing school. It
really confirmed that I was meant to be a nurse. I especially loved my fieldwork
assignment in the emergency room. I remember one time, five people were
brought in, the casualties of a gang fight. I saw the doctors and nurses leap 
into action. I watched them, fascinated. All of a sudden, they asked me to lend
a hand. I only got to hand them instruments and hold the patient in position —
I wasn’t allowed, by law, to do much until I got my license — but afterward, I
said to myself, ‘This is where I belong.’ By the way, all five guys lived.”
Have a ready answer for the question(s) you’re most afraid you’ll be asked;
an example is “Why have you job-hopped so much?” For guidance on how to
address such questions, see Chapter 10.
Targeting specific employers
Identify 25 employers you’d like to work for, without regard to whether
they’re currently advertising any openings. Most job seekers should focus on
small, growing companies and government agencies in their target industry
within reasonable commuting distance.
How to find such employers? Sure, ask friends and colleagues, but also look
for want ads with multiple job openings at a company you’ve never heard of.
Those are usually small companies in growth mode — the ones most likely to
be hiring for a wide range of positions. Find those ads by entering your locale
on www.simplyhired.com and www.indeed.com, both of which aggregate
listings from thousands of employment sites, including monster.com and
careerbuilder.com.
Check out the following Web sites for specific types of jobs:
 To find federal agencies with job openings, go to www.usajobs.
opm.gov.
 For state and local jobs, go to www.statejobs.com.
 For jobs aimed at those just starting out, see monstertrak.com.
 For jobs aimed at people 50+, see www.yourencore.com and
www.seniors4hire.com.
To find the name of the person with the power to hire you, of course, first
check the employer’s Web site. If it’s not listed there, phone each organiza-
tion’s main number and say something like, “Hi, I’m updating my mailing list.
What’s the correct spelling of your marketing director’s (or whoever you think
would be your target boss) name? And what’s his (or her) direct-dial phone
number? And e-mail address?” Enter each employer’s contact information in
227
Chapter 8: 30 Days to a Cool Job

ResumeMaker’s Contact Tracker. If you receive only a person’s name, you can
often find the contact info by googling the name along with the name of the
company, the word “e-mail,” and perhaps the company’s area code. Or ask
the switchboard operator for the mailroom. Those folks have the desired
information but not gatekeeper responsibility.
Day 3: Research Your Target Employers
Research the 25 employers you identified during Day 2. Take no more than 15
minutes on each. Just look at the company Web site and then google the
employer’s name, using Google’s Web, News, and Groups tabs. Keep notes on
each employee in ResumeMaker’s contact tracker. You don’t want employers
to think that you picked them at random. They want to feel loved.
Days 4–5: Contact Your Network
E-mail or phone the 50 people in your network who are most likely to help
you get a job, especially a job at one of your 25 target employers. You say you
don’t know 50 such people? You’re wrong. Consider these sources:
 Past and present co-workers and bosses
 Your professors
 Past and current friends, even back to childhood, and lovers (be careful
there)
 Family (Don’t forget about your second cousin twice removed. Really. I
discuss the power of distant ties later in this chapter.)
 Your professionals: your doctor, lawyer, hairstylist, clergyperson, and 
so on
 Even someone as distant as a fellow student in your statistics study
group 20 years ago
The odds are tiny that any one person will give you a lead that results in a
good job offer, but if you contact 50 people, chances are good. Truthfully, it’s
best if you contact not 50 but 100 people. That greatly increases your
chances of getting multiple job offers, so you have a choice. But it’s okay; I’ll
settle for 50.
In the following sections, I show how to make your contacts without taking a
lot of time, and with less stress than you may think.
228
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

During Days 4 and 5, you also spend time getting responses from the people
you contacted, making follow-up calls, and writing thank-you notes. (See a
sample of a thank-you note in the later section “Following up.”)
Knowing how much networking 
time you need
I can hear a complaint: “You expect me to contact 50 people in one day?!?!” I
forgive you if you take two days to do it, but the average person can, indeed,
do it in a day. Salespeople, for example, are often expected to make 150(!)
dials a day.
Break it down. Assume you’re sending 25 e-mails and making 25 phone calls:
 The e-mails are identical except for a couple of lines to personalize each
one. So, each should take no more than five minutes: That’s a total of
two hours.
 Of the 25 phone calls, you probably get voicemail 15 times. At two min-
utes each, including dialing time, that’s a half-hour. Add ten phone calls,
say 15 minutes each, and that’s two and a half hours.
You wind up with a total of five working hours. Allowing you an hour’s worth
of breaks, if you start at 9, you’re done by 3. No sympathy.
Making 50 contacts, especially for shy people, can be an odious task, and I
find that my clients are a lot more likely to get it done if they just cram it into
one yucky day than if they space it out.
E-mailing contacts in your network
I can hear you protesting: “Why in the world would my second cousin twice
removed, let alone someone in my statistics study group 20 years ago, help
me get a job?” I’ll show you: Pretend you were in that study group, and out of
the blue, 20 years later, you get the e-mail in Figure 8-1.
Can you see how even a distant tie feels, somehow, close enough? If you did
know someone, mightn’t you tell Henry about it? I routinely ask that question
of the attendees of my job seeker workshops and, invariably, most raise their
hand to say yes.

Succeeding on the phone
In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell reminds readers that they make a hard-to-change
impression within the first few seconds of a conversation. Your tone of voice
must be friendly and confident without coming on too strong. Yet you must
be yourself. Sounds paradoxical, but it isn’t. At different times, people use dif-
ferent voices. Avoid your depressed, I-hate-looking-for-a-job voice. Into an
audiocassette recorder, record your friendly, confident-sounding voice, listen
to that tape, and use that voice. When you pick up the phone, smile — it
comes through. Standing up also can help.
If you’re phoning, save any chitchat for the end of the conversation. If you
chat upfront, your motive for friendliness may be suspect. Also, by saving the
small talk for the end, if the person needs to cut short the conversation,
you’ll have already finished the important part of the call.
Dear (Name here),
I’d imagine I’m the last person on the planet you’d expect to hear from. You and I 
were in the same statistics class with Professor Marascuilo at Penn State 20 
years ago.
I’ve been a project manager with a video game company and got great evaluations, 
but they just sent all the work to India.
I’ve been reading a book on how to find a job and it urges job seekers to call 
everyone they know, no matter how distant the tie. So, I’m wondering, by any 
chance, if you might know someone who might need a good software project 
manager or could lead me to one. And by any chance, might you know someone at 
one of these employers? (Insert your list of 25 target employers.)
Thank you for considering my request. I love my work and am eager to get back
to it.
Sincerely,
Henry Mikulski

Day 6: Contact Leads
Phone (or e-mail if you’re better in writing) a hirer or a connection to a hirer
you’ve obtained from your network. Don’t, however, contact anyone at your
25 target employers yet. That’s for later, when you’ve seen whether anyone in
your network knows someone at those firms. (See the section “Day 9: Contact
Your Target Employers” for more information.)
In the following sections, I explain how to ease into making contact, how to
reach the people you’re seeking as quickly as possible, what to say when you
reach them, and how to follow up.
The most important idea to keep in mind with every contact: Be persistent but
likable. Please remember this phrase. These two words are keys to a success-
ful job search: Persistent. Likable.
Making contact when you have cold feet
Before calling a lead (including an actual employer), role-play a call with a
friend. Then call your lowest-priority potential hirers, your throwaways —
you’re going to mess up on your first few. After you’ve had a couple of good
phone calls, move up to your top-choice employers.
Afraid you’ll stumble on the phone? A few mess-ups may actually make you
more credible. When I started out on radio, to avoid stumbling, I scripted
much of what I said. Boy, did I sound perfect — too perfect. Reading a script
stripped away the human connection that’s key to a successful interaction.
Now, I simply start talking, and only when I get stuck do I look at the few
phrases I’ve written down to remind me of my main points. Now, after many
years on the radio, I stumble more than I did when I started, which makes me
seem more human, and in turn, actually connects me better with my audi-
ence. So relax. Keep your few talking points in front of you to help you when
you’re stuck, and, when you stumble, know that it probably won’t hurt you.
The first call is the hardest, so don’t make just one call per sitting. Set a goal,
such as, “I’ll take a coffee break after I’ve made ten calls.” I can hear you protest-
ing, “Ten calls! That will take all day.” Remember, if you make ten calls, you’ll
probably get through to only a few people. It takes only one minute to leave a
full voicemail message, so the coffee break will come sooner than you think.
231
Chapter 8: 30 Days to a Cool Job

Getting through
One of job seekers’ greatest frustrations is being unable to get through to the
right person. They can’t get past a gatekeeper or through voicemail jail, and
they leave messages that are never returned.
No method always works, so prepare to be turned down much of the time
(that’s no big deal). But each of the following strategies increases your
chances of getting to speak with the Great and Powerful.
Getting out of voicemail (or e-mail) jail
If you get Ms. Hirer’s voicemail, don’t be disappointed. Voicemail is your
friend. Unless the gatekeeper screens his voicemails and deletes yours, the
hirer will get to hear your 10- or 45-second pitch (your choice) — of course,
told in your natural, pleasant, and not-stuffy voice. Remember, your first few
seconds are key. Here’s a sample:
Hi, this is Ellen Neiman. I’m following up on the letter I sent you last week.
I’m the Trenton State graduate who’s really interested in selling for the
cable industry. If you think I might be of help to you or have any words of
wisdom on how I might find a job in this field, I know you’re probably
busy, but I’d love a call back. My phone number is 510-555-2740. (Say it
slowly.) That’s 510-555-2740. The best times to reach me are today until 5
p.m. and tomorrow morning from 8 to 9. Thanks so much.
To help ensure your e-mail is read, choose an intriguing but honest subject
line — for example, “Query from an eager, aspiring salesperson.”
Getting past a live gatekeeper
Here’s a tough scenario. In this case, Ellen didn’t write first, so it’s a total cold
call, and she got the gatekeeper from hell. Here’s how she handled it:
Gatekeeper: Mr. Hirer’s office.
Ellen: Hi. Is he available? (The brevity and informal tone suggests she’s not
an interloper and increases the chances that the gatekeeper will put her
through without an interrogation.)
Gatekeeper: Who may I say is calling? (So much for no interrogation.)
Ellen: Ellen Neiman.
Gatekeeper: May I ask what this is in reference to? (The dreaded question.)
Ellen: I could really use your help. (An opener that has been known to
calm even dragon-like gatekeepers.) I just graduated from college and am
very interested in a sales position in the cable industry. I’m sure Mr. Hirer
is busy, but could you see if he might speak briefly with me? Even if he
can’t use someone like me, maybe he might have a few words of wisdom
about where I might turn.
232
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

Gatekeeper: I’m sorry, Mr. Hirer is unavailable. If you wish, you can leave
a message, but there are no positions open.
Ellen: Could you recommend someone else it might be wiser to speak
with?
Gatekeeper: No. Would you like to leave a message? I really must go now.
Ellen: Does he have voicemail? Perhaps I could leave him a voicemail.
Gatekeeper: No he doesn’t. Would you like to leave a message?
Ellen: Thank you, no. I’m tough to reach. When’s the best time for me to
try back? (Leaving a message, especially with this gatekeeper, is unlikely to
bear fruit. Besides, you want to be sure the call happens when you have
your notes in front of you. Better to retain control and call back.)
Gatekeeper: (Sighs) I don’t know. He does stay late occasionally. (Finally,
a morsel.)
Ellen: Thank you very much.
At least half of all gatekeepers are this useless to you — their job is to protect
their boss’s time. That’s okay. Don’t let the grinches get you down. Laugh
them off as you would a troll in a video game and move on. Sooner rather
than later, a guardian angel is likely to descend.
When to phone back? If the gatekeeper doesn’t recommend a specific time,
try a prime time: a time when the hirer is likely to be at the desk, not in meet-
ings, and without a gatekeeper you need to cajole. Prime times are 7:30 to 9
a.m. and 5 to 7 p.m.
If you’re self-employed and looking for clients, try making cold calls.
Whenever public relations consultant Michael Cahlin needs business, he
simply whips out the phone book and starts calling companies he’d like as
clients. He asks them whether they’re happy with their PR. Often they aren’t,
and soon he has several new clients.
Walking in when you have the nerve
Have guts? Try walking in. Here’s why it works so well. If someone phones
you to ask whether you want to find a home for a new baby, chances are good
that you say “No.” But if that same baby is dropped on your doorstep, you
probably take it in and try to get it cared for. The same holds true for walking
in to an employer’s office. It’s much easier for an employer to turn down a
phone call or e-mail than a flesh-and-blood human being.
When I’m in a TV studio waiting to go on the air, I often chat with the pro-
ducer and camera people. I usually ask them how they got their cool jobs.
233
Chapter 8: 30 Days to a Cool Job

Frequently, they say that they went door to door, from studio to studio, until
someone said yes. Similarly, when my wife and I came to California, we got in
the car and drove from school district office to school district office. She got
three job offers within a week. Colonel Sanders started his career by going
from restaurant to restaurant asking the owners to try his chicken.
Richard Bolles, author of the classic career guide What Color Is Your
Parachute?, advises that walking in without an introduction works best for
entry- to mid-level jobs; and for blue-collar jobs, walking in is the most effec-
tive job-search method.
So, if you have the guts, walk in, explain that the company is a dream
employer, and say that you’d love to talk with someone who may be able to
help you figure out how you could get hired. Always start by telling your 10-
or 45-second pitch and seeing whether you can make an appointment for an
interview or, if you’re really lucky, get an interview on the spot.
If the gatekeeper says no and you’re really gutsy, sit and wait until the boss
walks past you. That can easily result in wasted hours, but it has worked. (Or
maybe that was a movie.)
Such direct strategies may work with small companies, but with larger organi-
zations, it’s usually more productive to visit their Web site and e-mail a senior
person from there. In those cases, try to contact the person who would be
your boss or your boss’s boss, but an HR person is okay too. Pleasant persis-
tence can help you prevail.
Speaking to a lead
Whether you leave a voicemail or are speaking with your contact, start with
your 10-second pitch, enthusiastically delivered. (Smile on the phone.)
Example:
Hello, Mr. XXXX, I’m a high school teacher who’s doing well — my princi-
pal gives me top evaluations — but I’m ready to move on to a job where I
can spend time with adults, not just teenagers. If you might possibly need
someone who’s able to explain things simply and is well organized, or if
you know of someone who may need a teacher like me, I’d love a call. My
phone number is 510-555-7457. That’s 510-555-7457. The best times to
reach me are between 8 and 10 a.m. and 4 and 6 p.m. Thank you.
If you get the person on the phone, after giving your 10-second pitch, listen
more than you talk. If you think it would impress that particular contact, tell
one or two of your PAR stories (see the earlier section “Creating your
resume” for more details about PAR stories).
234
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

If the person you’re talking to asks more than two questions (questions are
signs of interest), say something like, “You know, if you think it might be help-
ful, I’d be pleased to come in so you can connect a face to the voice.” A face-to-
face meeting increases your chances of getting good information and/or a job.
Ask questions about the employer’s needs so you can better understand how
you might be helpful. If you have an idea, tactfully propose it by saying, for
example, “In listening to you, it would seem I could help you by doing X.
What do you think?” If he likes your proposal, say something like, “Would you
like me to draft a one-pager that summarizes it?”
If the employer isn’t interested in you, end the conversation by asking, “What
would you suggest I do next? Is there someone else you think I should talk
with, an event I should attend, or something I should read?
Following up
After each call, e-mail your resume, cover letter, proposal, paper on a topic of
interest, or thank-you note as appropriate.
If your resume is likely to be weak in comparison with likely competitors for 
a job, don’t send it. Just send a thank-you note. Check out the sample in
Figure 8-2.
Dear Mr. Johnson,
Thanks for taking my call yesterday.
I am pleased that you think my experiences at college make me marketable. I do 
think that my job marketing the campus radio station on the Web taught me a lot 
that would be valuable to an employer.
And, of course, I appreciate your offering to keep your ears open for a position that 
may be appropriate for me.
I’ve already followed up on your suggestion that I contact Jamal Washington. I just 
called and left a voice mail.
Work aside, it was fun hearing about your new sailboat.
Best regards,

If you’re just entering a field, your resume simply documents your lack of

for example, “Thoughts on what it takes to be a great TV news reporter.”
Days 7–8: Answer Want Ads 
the Smart Way
Many career guides and counselors opine that answering ads is a weak
approach to landing a job. But in light of the number of jobs posted on the
Net, the new easy tools for sifting through them, new laws and policies
requiring the public advertising of jobs, and people getting ever sicker of
being “networked,” answering ads may be a more powerful tool than you
think — especially if you use the techniques I show you in this section.
Answering want ads: An underrated 
job-search method
The want ads are a more powerful job-search tool than you may have been
led to believe. Consider these facts:
236
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 
The biggest-steak-in-Texas approach
Dan Kennedy, author of the No BS Marketing
Newsletter, insists that this version of cold con-
tact is a surefire way to land a job:
 Target ten successful entrepreneurs or
CEOs of small- to mid-sized growing com-
panies in the field you want to work in.
 Research their lives and companies, per-
haps just using Google (google.com).
 Prepare individual letters to each of your
targets, selling yourself — and add,
“Someone must have given you your first
chance. I’m looking for someone to give me
mine.” — and offer to work for free.
 FedEx those letters.
 If you don’t hear from them quickly, pursue
them with phone calls, e-mails, ideas, or
anything else you can think of to secure
interviews.
Kennedy says, “I’ll bet you the biggest steak in
Texas that within 30 days, you’ll be working for
one of those 10 leaders.”

 With literally millions of easy-to-search online job ads to choose from,
you can focus on those that really fit. The odds are much smaller that a
networking contact will lead to a well-suited job.
 It’s fast. Respond to an ad today and you could be hired within weeks or
even days. Other job-search methods, such as networking, typically take
months or even years.
 Ads are a legal cheat sheet for job applicants. Unlike with networking
or cold calling, you usually know exactly what the employer is looking
for — the job requirements are right there in the ad. So you can tailor
your resume, cover letter, and interview to the employer’s needs.
 Responding to want ads is more psychologically rewarding than net-
working because:
• You know you’re probably applying for an actual job opening.
• Responding to want ads is less stressful than asking people to help
you find a job, or trying to convince an employer who hasn’t listed
a job opening that she should hire you.
• Networking and cold calling often involve trying to convince some-
one to buy something they’re not looking for. Unless you’re a real
sales type, that’s not fun.
 Using the want ads is an ideal approach for people who work during
business hours. “When will I find the time to network and make cold
calls?” is a frequent cry of working stiffs. In contrast, you can search for
and respond to want ads at night and on weekends so you don’t have to
take time off work. And unlike when you’re networking, you don’t have
to worry if you’re having a bad hair day.
 Using the want ads is ideal if you’re looking for a job out of town. The
Web contains sites with literally millions of instantly searchable job
openings all over the world. In fact, want ads should be an especially
large part of an out-of-town job search because you probably don’t have
many faraway networking contacts.
 Responding to want ads is ideal for people who write better than they
schmooze.
 The want ads are a great place to discover employers who are in
hiring mode. Even if their posted ads don’t fit you, contact them and
they may create a job for you.
 Want ads can even be useful when you’re self-employed. Use them to
identify organizations seeking someone to do work that’s right up your
alley, and then propose doing the job on a project-by-project basis.
237
Chapter 8: 30 Days to a Cool Job

 Want ads may be better for you than other job-search tools.
Networking works if you have a 500-person Rolodex. Cold-calling dream
employers works if you’re a terrific self-promoter. Unfortunately, most
people, especially those who consult career guides, aren’t like that. For
most people, responding to want ads feels more doable. Career guide-
books call networking and cold calling the best job-search techniques,
but they’re useless if you’re too uptight to use them. Want ads are a job-
search tool for the rest of us.
Want ads have long been underrated, and networking overrated, but today,
that’s truer than ever. More and more job openings are subject to affirmative
action hiring requirements, so fewer jobs are filled from the “inside.” To fulfill
legal requirements, they must be advertised.
Meanwhile, thanks to the Internet, answering want ads is a job-search
method on steroids. Millions of job openings are posted on the Web. You 
can search through them to find tailor-made jobs from the comfort of your
home. You can even have personal electronic job scouts on monster.com
or federaljobsearch.com scour the Net for you 24/7, searching through
those millions of job openings and delivering the best fits on a silver platter
right to your electronic door. All free to you! Now tell me that’s not cool.
Deciding how much to use the want ads
Other career guidebooks give everyone the same advice: Use want ads spar-
ingly. But one-size-fits-all advice rarely does fit all. So how much should you
use want ads? Some people should devote no time to scanning the want ads;
others should devote more than half of their job-search time. To tell what’s
right for you, check out the following questions. The more you answer yes,
the more you should use want ads:
 Are you better at writing resumes and letters than at networking?
 Are you more likely to answer ads than to network?
 Do you know only a few people in your field?
 Are you new in town?
 Are you expecting a salary of less than $70,000?
 Is your target job in demand?
 Are you currently employed in or near your target field?
238
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

Despite the advantages of want ads, few job seekers should devote all their job-
search time to answering ads. More than half the jobs, in all fields and at all
levels, are never advertised. So spend some time contacting target employers
even if they have no listed openings, and tell people in your personal network
what sort of job you’re looking for — especially if you’re trying to break into a
new field. Employers don’t have to advertise to find someone without experi-
ence. They can get candidates by asking their current employees, friends, or
cousin Gomer. (See the earlier section “Days 4–5: Contact Your Network” for
more details.)
Not sure whether the want ads will work for you? Craft good responses to
perhaps 20 carefully selected ads. If you get no positive responses, you have
your answer.
Starting to answer ads
Visit each of your 25 target employers’ Web sites and apply for any on-target
jobs. Start your cover letter by mentioning your referrer, if you have one.
Then — and this is crucial — explain, point-by-point, how you meet the
requirements stated in the ad. Include a sentence or two that capitalizes on
the knowledge you obtain in Day 3 about that employer. (Cover Letters For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Joyce Lain Kennedy [Wiley] has everything you
need to know about cover letters.)
Your goal is, by the end of Day 8, to have applied for ten openly advertised
on-target jobs. You probably won’t find ten on those 25 target employers’
sites. Find the rest on employment Web sites. Particularly look at niche sites
aimed at your profession. For a list of those, see www.rileyguide.com/
jobs.html. But also consult indeed.com and simplyhired.com, each of
which lists millions of openings.
239
Chapter 8: 30 Days to a Cool Job

Day 9: Contact Your Target Employers
At each of your 25 target employers’ Web sites, look for an on-target job to
apply for. If you can’t find one, e-mail a person who potentially could hire you
or someone one level above that. Try to contact the person who would be
your boss or your boss’s boss, but a human resources person is okay too.
In the situation in Figure 8-3, the job seeker isn’t clear about what kind of
work she wants to do. Most career counselors would say, “You’re not ready
to contact employers. Go back and figure out what you want to do first.” But I
find that many people, despite all efforts, remain open to lots of jobs. They’re
better off sallying forth and telling the truth. Figure 8-3 is the kind of letter an
open-minded job seeker may write.
240
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 
Hunting for job-seeking help with 
recruiters and agencies
If you’re seeking a job for which you have pre-
vious experience, contact recruiters, also
known as headhunters. Don’t consider a
recruiter who asks you for money — the
employer should pay the fee. To find appropri-
ate recruiters, call the human resources depart-
ment of a target employer and say, “I’m looking
to submit my resume to a recruiter for a (insert
type of job) position. When you use a recruiter
to find that type of employee, who do you use?”
You may also consult a directory of recruiters,
such as The Directory of Executive Recruiters
(www.selectrecruiters.com/kijs).
If you’re looking for an entry-level position or
are changing careers, forget about head-
hunters. You may, however, contact a few
employment agencies. The difference between
agencies and headhunters is that agencies
generally focus on lower-level positions, espe-
cially temporary ones. Look in your Yellow
Pages to find on-target agencies. Again, if an
agency asks you for money, hang up. The
employer should pay the agency.
Unlike other cover letters, when writing to an
employment agency or headhunter, include
your salary requirement. State it as a range,
such as “$58,000 to $68,000, depending on the
nature of the position.” (Cover Letters For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Joyce Lain Kennedy
[Wiley] is a fine resource on writing cover letters.)
Also tell the agency or headhunter that you
don’t want your resume sent to an employer
without your permission. Otherwise the
recruiter could blast your resume to ten zillion
employers and demand a hefty commission
from the one who hires you. That could add
$20,000 to the employer’s cost of hiring you.
That’s often enough to make the employer move
on to another candidate.

The method in Figure 8-3 works so well because you get to be considered
without having to compete with zillions of other applicants. And it can work
fast — create good chemistry and show up at the right time, and you can get
a job offer pronto. You may balk at the phrase, “Am I deluding myself?” but it
actually works. Try it.
Most people are more effective in cold contact if they e-mail first and follow
up with a phone call. But if you feel that you’ll be more persuasive in a cold
call, feel free to phone first and follow up with an e-mail. And if you’re really
gutsy, especially for low-level positions, walking in can be the most effective
approach of all.
For more information about contacting target employers, use the methods
that I describe in the earlier section “Day 6: Contact Leads.”
Dear Mary,
Tom Hawkins suggested I contact you. I have long been fascinated with fragrances 
and imagine that working in a perfumery would be wonderful.
I’d guess that I could do more than one thing for you, so I thought I’d share a few 
things I’ve done. Perhaps the following will enable you to see how I might help you:
 
* 
I helped turn around the shipping department at McFallon’s  
 
 
Wholesale Nursery. I developed a new system, hired great people,  
 
 
and created an environment in which everyone — well almost  
 
 
everyone — wanted to work hard.
 
* 
I developed the Web site for a little home business — see  
 
 
www.rosefragrances.com.
 
* 
I received a grant from Exxon to create a catalog of South Carolina’s  
 
 
wildflowers. It was an amazing experience.
Am I deluding myself (Yes, that phrase works) into thinking that I might be of help to 
you even though I lack direct experience in a perfumery?
If you think I might be worth interviewing, or if you simply have a little advice for me, 
I’d love to hear from you. My number is 510-555-3888, and the best times to reach 
me are between 8 and 9 a.m. and 5 and 6 p.m.
Sincerely,
Monica Pataki

Days 10–11: Follow Up
If, within a week, you haven’t heard from the people you contacted, call to
follow up. Don’t hesitate to leave a voicemail. If, for example, you had cold-
contacted an employer, say something like this:
“I’m (insert your name), the manager at the Big Whup Widget Company
who was just part of a downsizing and phoned you. I’m assuming that not
having heard from you, you’re too busy to respond. I can understand. But
I know that sometimes, things can fall between the cracks, so I’m taking
the liberty of calling to follow up. If you or one of your managers is inter-
ested in talking with me or have any advice as to where I should turn, I’d
appreciate a call. The best times to reach me are (insert) and my phone
number is (repeat the number twice). And my name, again, is (insert
name). Thank you.”
Of course, you won’t hear back from most of the people you contact — even
from employers whose ads you’re responding to — but you’re likely to get at
least one bite. Often it’s from an employer who has been thinking about
hiring but hasn’t gotten to that laborious process yet. Sometimes, an
employer finds it easier to just vet you and be done with it.
Days 12–30: Interview and 
Land That Cool Job
Congratulations. You set in motion everything you need to do to land a job.
During Days 12 through 30, you should be getting responses, leads, and inter-
views. Hopefully, you’ll also start negotiating for a cool job. In this section, I
briefly describe the interviewing and negotiation processes.
Here are a few other tasks you can do during Days 12 through 30:
 Follow up a second time with people who didn’t respond to your initial
follow-up query. That second follow-up usually is well worth it, because
the potential employers are feeling guilty about not having responded
despite your persistence.
 Twice a week, revisit employment sites to find on-target ads. Of course,
also apply to on-target jobs e-mailed to you by the electronic job scouts
you signed up for. (I cover want ads earlier in this chapter.)
You know your job search is on track if you have at least six live prospects,
including, for example, a person who doesn’t have a job opening now but
asks you to check back in a month.

Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

Interviewing
Tips for job interviews include the following:
 Before the interview, reread the research on the firm from Day 3.
Perhaps do some more. You can, for example, call the receptionist,
explain that you have an interview scheduled, and ask whether he can
direct you to any material about the organization that’s not on its Web
site but that could help you prepare.
 Have ready a few PAR stories. A Problem you faced at work, how you
Approached it, and its positive Resolution. Pick those you think would
impress that particular employer. (See Chapter 9 for more about PAR
stories.)
 Early in the job interview, ask a question or two that helps guide your
responses throughout the interview. Examples: “What attributes end up
being most crucial on this job?” or “What’s an important task I’m likely
to be asked to do in the first few weeks on the job?”
 Ask whether the job description has been fully mapped out or
whether it depends on the candidate. If it’s the latter, you have a golden
opportunity: Play consultant and see whether you can identify
employer’s problems that you could solve. That could encourage the
employer to recast the job in your own image.
 If possible, demonstrate that you can do a key task. For example, for a
sales position, demonstrate how you’d try to sell the product. If you’re
applying for a training position, demonstrate how you’d teach a concept.
Providing a job sample can convince many employers that you’re capa-
ble of doing the job even though you have no experience.
Some employers, especially in unionized or government workplaces,
require all candidates to receive an identical interview, so you may not
be allowed to ask questions or do a demonstration until the end. Don’t
force it.
 Especially if your job history suggests you’re underqualified for the
job, try to move the discussion away from your past and to the future.
Ask about the job’s tasks and explain how you might tackle them.
 E-mail a thank-you note the same day. Sounds obvious, even corny, but
many employers see it as a sign of motivation and professionalism. (I
give you a sample thank-you letter in the earlier section “Following up.”)
 Follow up three days later. Say something like, “I’m quite interested in
the job, so I’m calling to follow up. May I ask where I stand?” If you aren’t
number one, ask whether there’s anything that makes the employer hesi-
tant to hire you. Offer to submit additional material, such as a short pro-
posal outlining how you’d address a problem the organization is facing.
243
Chapter 8: 30 Days to a Cool Job

For more on interviewing (for example, a list of ways to create chemistry with
an interviewer), see Chapter 10.
Negotiating
When you get the call offering you a job, don’t negotiate terms on the phone.
Make an appointment for a day or two later. That subtly makes clear that you
won’t accept just any offer.
Prepare for the negotiation by creating a list of comparable salaries for the
position. You can often get these from www.rileyguide.com/salary.
html, from trade publications, or from local employment agencies that 
specialize in your field.
In the negotiation, if appropriate, first try to get the job description upgraded
to greater responsibility. That can justify a higher salary. And don’t settle for
a dead-end job at a no-name employer. Hold out for a launchpad job: one
offering the chance to learn important skills, ideally for a well-known
employer. My daughter’s first job was in the White House. That was the good
news. The bad news was that her job was to answer letters to Socks, the
Clintons’ cat. Before she got typecast as a low-level employee, she told her
boss, “I’m willing to pay my dues, but I’m a pretty good researcher and writer,
so I’m wondering if I could be more useful doing something else.” Soon, she
was working on Hillary’s daily briefing.
What If, After 30 Days, You Got Zippo?
If the 30 Days to a Cool Job method doesn’t bear fruit for you, your best bet is
to repeat the process with a different job or industry target. Or seek assis-
tance from a private career counselor or government-sponsored “One-Stop.”
(To find your local One-Stop, go to www.servicelocator.org.) Perhaps
some mock interviewing with a pro can help.
But if you follow the plan, you’re miles ahead of most job seekers, and I’m
betting that you’ll land a cool job.

Chapter 9
Crafting the Right Resume
in Less Time
In This Chapter
 Writing a resume in a few hours, not a few weeks
 Putting together a just-right resume in 11 easy steps and 1 hard one
C
reating a resume is a great first step in your job search. It usually helps
you realize that you’ve accomplished more than you think. Plus, it dis-
tills your accomplishments into impressive sound bites you can use in net-
working (see Chapter 8) and interviews (see Chapter 10). Purists may sniff,
but this chapter contains my client-tested, not-too-fussy, not-too-lazy, just-
right guide to creating a plenty-good-enough resume. To use this approach to
maximum advantage, use it with www.resumemaker.com ($29 for students
and entry-level workers, $39 for more senior people).
Despite my efforts to make do-it-yourself resume making straightforward,
some people want a human hand holder. The person I refer clients to is Beth
Brown (www.susanireland.com/writers/bethbrown.html). If someone
wants a resume for a federal government job, I refer them to Kathryn
Troutman at www.resume-place.com.
Spending a Limited Amount
of Time on Your Resume
Yes, your resume should demonstrate competence and create chemistry. Yes,
it should be formatted for easy reading. Yes, it should avoid errors in speling
(just kidding). Yes, tweak it a bit for each individual employer. But no, it’s not
worth taking the time to craft your resume as carefully as a prenuptial agree-
ment. A resume, created efficiently, is a few-hour, not a few-week, activity. Jobs
are rarely won because of the tweaking done beyond those first few hours.

Remember, many of today’s employers usually use resumes only for a quick
screen — average inspection time is 15 seconds. Why? In part because
employers know they can’t trust resumes: More than one-third of resumes
contain inflated credentials, and even the honest ones can’t be trusted.
Thanks to rev-up-your-resume books, chapters like this one, software, and
resume ghostwriters, a resume may better indicate whether a candidate got
help on her resume than whether she can do the job.
So put your job search time where it counts — in putting yourself, your letter,
work sample, and maybe your resume in front of the right people.
Notice that in the previous sentence I said, “maybe your resume.” Why?
Because unless your work history is likely to be superior to that of most other
candidates for your target job, you’re better off hitching your prospects on
your letter, work sample, and perhaps a bio, which is a brief listing or narrative
of your highlights. Yes, some employers will reject you for not submitting your
resume, but many others won’t look askance, and when the day is done, you’ll
probably get a good job quicker with no resume than with a mediocre one.
If you’re looking for work as a self-employed individual or small business,
never use a resume. Use a bio, portfolio, or presentation kit. Why? A resume
makes you look like an employee who can’t find a job, not a business owner.
Step 1: Write Your Name
and Contact Information
Even with something as basic as your name and contact info, there are do’s
and don’ts:
 Put your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address on separate
lines. Otherwise, computers may read the info as one long string, and,
poof, your contact information is lost.
 List your home address. If possible, list a street address rather than a
post office box. It presents a more stable image.
 Include your home and cellphone numbers. You’re probably wise, how-
ever, not to include your work phone and e-mail address. Sure, that
makes you more accessible, but it also suggests that you’re job hunting
on company time. (You wouldn’t do that, now would you?)
 Don’t have a home e-mail account? Plenty of free ones are available. My
favorites: gmail.com (Google’s e-mail service) and mail.yahoo.com.
246
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

 If you have a Web site or blog, list it. It’s a good place to display your
work samples and post your resume. Think twice if your site or blog’s
address is deathtotheestablishment.com and features your grunge
band photos.
Don’t have a site? Maybe this is the time to get one. The free site builder
at www.homestead.com lets you create a good-looking, functional site
in no time. And the site-hosting fee is just $9.99 a month. Setting up a
blog is free and even faster, plus there’s no hosting fee: go to www.
blogger.com.
Step 2 (Optional): Write Your Objective
If you’d consider a wide range of jobs and would rather your first impression
stand or fall on your Highlights section (see Step 9), then you don’t need an
objective. Include an objective only if you have a specific job target and
would turn down anything else, or if you’re tailoring your resume to a spe-
cific job opening.
An objective can follow this form: “A position requiring abilities A and per-
haps B plus personal attribute Z.” For example:
 Petroleum geologist position requiring extensive knowledge of computer-
based drill site analysis and Alaska field experience, and the ability to
work well in isolation.
 Psychologist position requiring successful experience with drug abusers
and with diverse populations, and the ability to remain calm under
stress.
 Management position requiring the ability to make good decisions
quickly, solid understanding of video signaling technology, and unques-
tionable integrity.
 High school English teacher position requiring successful experience in
teaching advanced-placement classes and the willingness to take on
extensive after-school responsibilities.
 Cushy job requiring a laid-back personality, the desire for a six-figure
income, and the willingness to accept it without feeling guilty that it
wasn’t earned.
Or simply state your target job (for example, high school English teacher),
and present your attributes in your resume’s body (see the next section).
247
Chapter 9: Crafting the Right Resume in Less Time

Step 3: Choose Your Format:
Attributes or Chronological
The main headings in an attributes resume are — no surprise — your attrib-
utes: skills, expertise, or abilities. Figure 9-1 shows an example.
In contrast, a chronological resume’s main headings are the jobs you’ve held,
listed in — again, no surprise — chronological order, with your most recent
job listed first. (See Figure 9-2.)

Almost all employers prefer a chronological format, so consider an attributes
format only if you’ve never held a job related to your desired position: for
example, you’ve always been a supermarket bagger and now are seeking a
job as a physics teacher.
If you’re concerned about your boss discovering that you’re looking to leave,
your resume should indicate that you’re employed by, for example, a major
consumer products company rather than by, say, Procter & Gamble. That can
avoid, for example, getting caught by your human resources department
searching the Net for resumes with the words “Procter & Gamble” to see
which employees are looking to leave.

Chapter 9: Crafting the Right Resume in Less Time

Step 4: Select a Specific Resume
to Use as a Model
Resumemaker.com contains a large collection of model resumes. Pick one that
 Uses your chosen structure — attributes or chronological
 Has content relevant to your target job
 Uses language and has a feel you like
Use that resume as a template. In addition, keep handy one or two more of
your favorite model resumes as sources of phrasing or inspiration.
Step 5: Draft a Resume that Builds
on Your Model Resume
This step is the hard one. I do my best to make it as easy as possible.
A survey of 1,133 resumes by ResumeDoctor.com found that 42.7 percent of
resumes contained false information. So, it’s not surprising that ever-more
employers are verifying information. Ninety-six percent of 2,500 HR profes-
sionals surveyed by the Society for Human Resources Management said their
companies always check references, credentials, or both. So, don’t exagger-
ate on your resume. It may well come back to bite you. Besides, do you really
want to beat out a more qualified candidate by lying?
In the following sections, I show you how to build the body of your resume
with accomplishments, skills, and careful wording.
Listing impressive accomplishments
For each of your past jobs, list two or three of your accomplishments that
would most impress your target employers and, importantly, are the kind of
work you want to do (or at least wouldn’t mind doing) on your next job.
Limiting yourself to just two or three accomplishments makes it more likely
that the employer actually reads your most important points. It also makes the
reader curious to know more. To find out more, he or she has to do precisely
what you want — interview you.
Before you send your resume to a particular employer, review it to see
whether the accomplishments you listed would most impress that employer.
If not, see whether you can come up with more appealing ones.
250
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

Plan on keeping your resume to one or maybe two pages. Okay, okay. If you
can fill three or even four pages with accomplishments that would impress
your potential employer, go for it.
The general rule is to write only about the jobs you’ve had in the last ten
years. But if going back further would make you look better to your target
employer, go ahead.
In the following sections, I describe a variety of accomplishments that you
can include on your resume.
If your target employer would be more impressed by your school-related
accomplishments, focus on those rather than, for example, that summer job
driving a beer truck.
Quantitative accomplishments
Quantitative achievements are powerful. Examples:
 Developed proposal that received $25,000 foundation grant.
 Spearheaded quality improvement initiative that reduced product defect
rate by 15 percent.
 Only one accident in two years as operations supervisor.
 Conducted study that resulted in a 20 percent decrease in my employer’s
phone bills and earned me a cash bonus (which only partly compensated
for the personal phone calls you made to your girlfriend in Shanghai).
 Especially impressive are achievements that compare your performance
to a benchmark. For example: Ranked second of 15 salespeople in net
profit generated. Of course, you needn’t mention that the other 13 were
part of the state prison’s early-release program.
References and recommendations
Less quantifiable accomplishments in the form of recommendations and com-
pliments are also fine:
 A quote from your performance evaluation or letter of recommendation:
“Tawanda is one of our brightest and easiest-to-get-along-with employees.”
 Successful projects: “I developed a new procedure for assaying immuno-
suppressants.”
 Increased responsibility: “Within three months, was given sole responsi-
bility for the agency’s largest graphic design projects.”
 Compliments you’ve received from co-workers or satisfied customers.
(Don’t mention the time you were complimented for finally getting some-
thing right.)
251
Chapter 9: Crafting the Right Resume in Less Time

Get letters of reference early in your job search. Not only will they be useful
as quotes in your resume, but reference letters also are great for sending to
prospective employers.
PAR stories
Some accomplishments can be particularly powerfully stated as PAR stories.
In a PAR story, you describe a problem you faced, how you approached it, and
the positive result. Take the accomplishment, “Only one accident in two years
as operations supervisor.” By itself, it’s okay, but here’s how it reads as a PAR
story:
When I was hired, three serious accidents had occurred during the previ-
ous year. (Note that this will benchmark the achievement about to be men-
tioned.) One man lost part of a finger. I observed and interviewed all the
relevant people, and we developed a new plan for reducing accidents. In
my two years as supervisor, the company experienced only one accident,
a slightly twisted ankle.
My clients have found that anecdotal style effective — it feels real — but
some job seekers insist on being more traditional. If that’s you, you can write
something like, “Collaborated with team members to develop a successful
accident-reduction plan, achieving a 20 percent reduction in onsite accidents
within first year.”
“Soft” accomplishments
To get a job offer, you must prove three things:
 You can do the job.
 You will do the job.
 Your personality fits the organization.
So don’t forget about “soft” accomplishments, such as people skills and
Boy/Girl Scout attributes like reliability and hard work. If true, include such
accomplishments as:
 Voluntarily worked, on average, a 55-hour workweek. Took only four sick
days in three years.
 Well-liked by co-workers. If they gave an award for employee most likely
to be asked out to lunch, it would be me. (Of course, as a result, I now
weigh 967 pounds.)
Other accomplishments to list
Still can’t think of enough accomplishments? Try these:
 Think of all the people who benefited from your efforts. What would
they say about you? Any statistics you can cite?
252
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

 Sometimes, you can jog your memory by looking at a list of action phrases
and verbs. A long list can be found on resumemaker.com. In general, use
more dynamic verbs such as “spearheaded” and “championed” rather
than the bland “managed” or “ran.”
 Don’t forget about unpaid work or school activities if necessary. If you’re
including unpaid work, title this section of your resume “Work History”
rather than “Employment History.”
Including transferable skills
If you’re trying to land your first job in a field, your previous experience, by
definition, will be less applicable to your target job. The good news is that
nearly everyone has accomplishments that use transferable skills — those
you used in a different context but would also be helpful in your target job.
For example, if you’re a new college graduate seeking a job as a TV news
reporter, an accomplishment using transferable skills would be that term
paper in which you “interviewed 50 students to identify new strategies for an
anti-alcohol abuse campaign. Findings were heavily used in the final project
design.”
Or, say you’re tired of being a starving artist and decide you want to become
a project manager for an art-related company. Highlight accomplishments as
an artist that may be relevant as a content manager; for example, “Curated a
student art exhibit, including design, text, and marketing. The event attracted
285 people. A review in the New Orleans Times-Picayune called it, ‘Bold and
fascinating.’”
My favorite example of a transferable skill: A prostitute decided to give it up.
What transferable skill did she put on her resume? Excellent customer serv-
ice. True story.
Compensating for an imperfect 
work history
Sometimes your work history is less than ideal. But you can present flaws
honestly without killing your chances of landing a job. In the following sections,
I tell you how.
Unemployment
If you’re worried that your current unemployment will hurt you in interviews,
consider getting a volunteer or temp job, ideally for a prestigious employer in
your desired field. Or set yourself up as a consultant. Before putting consultant
253
Chapter 9: Crafting the Right Resume in Less Time

on your resume, do have at least one consulting assignment (even if unpaid) so
you have an answer when the interviewer asks, “Well, Binky, tell me about one
of your consulting assignments.”
Job-hopping
If you’ve job-hopped, give reasons why you left; for example, you were in a
temp position, or you had to move because your spouse got a job offer she
couldn’t refuse.
But sometimes people have more problematic reasons for leaving. If, for
example, your boss hated your guts, you might list the reason for leaving
as “incompatibility with the company. (My boss insisted on a standardized
approach with customers while I found a more individualized approach to be
more effective.)” In a case like that, have the objective you create in Step 2
state what sort of employer you want to work for. In this example, you may
say, “an employer who encourages employees to innovate.”
Little or no work history
You haven’t been catatonic all this time (I hope). Even most party-hearty,
kickback, down-a-brew types have done enough constructive things to fill a
resume, at least a one-pager with lots of white space and wide margins. So, if
you don’t have a lot of real-world work experience, make a list of your accom-
plishments: classes you’ve taken, projects you completed, volunteer work,
and so on.
Don’t use vague language to hide what you were doing, like the homemaker
who wrote: “Operations manager for multi-dimensional enterprise.” Such
creativity appears deceptive, which is the last thing you want an employer
to think.
The late Yana Parker suggested that parents who stopped working to raise
their kids be honest, and be sure to include any out-of-home paid or volun-
teer work. For example:
2006–present, Full-time parent. Handled intricate logistics for young chil-
dren, including other parents’ kids, involved in many activities. Plus com-
munity work involving fundraising, voter registration, and community
service committee work.
A gap in work history
To combat a gap in your work history, list your resume in years rather than
months. Fill in the gaps with any education or volunteer work.
That solution, however, doesn’t solve David’s problem. He worked for a firm
that took on too much work with a too small budget, so David burned out
and took a yearlong vacation.
254
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

My recommendation: Tell the truth. In addition to being honest, the truth can
work well. For example:
April 2006–March 2007, Personal Sabbatical.
I’d never had a break, and figured while I was still plenty young enough to
enjoy it, I’d spend a year on pure pleasure: traveling in Europe for two
months, helping my brother remodel his kitchen, taking golf lessons, even
cleaning out my basement! And lest you think I was a total slug, I
attended a landscape architecture conference, and during a drive through
California, visited a half-dozen award-winning landscape architecture pro-
jects. I’m now back and eager to get to work.
Are you surprised? A narrative in a resume? And so informally written? Yes
and yes. Key to landing a job that you’ll be happy and successful in is to tell
your true human story throughout the process: in resumes, cover letters, cold
calls, and interviews. In today’s era of the oh-so-sanitized job applicant, a
candidate who tells his true human story often stands out as the sort of
person the employer wants in her organization. And if the employer doesn’t
want to hire that sort of person, it’s a sign that you don’t want to work there.
You may ask, “Shouldn’t a story like that go in the cover letter rather than the
resume?” Answer: It should go in both. It’s wise to repeat crucial material that
explains away problems and creates positive feelings about you. Besides,
resumes and cover letters have a habit of separating from each other, as when
the recipient of your resume and cover letter forwards only your resume to
his boss. (Want to know more about cover letters? Check out Cover Letters For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Joyce Lain Kennedy [Wiley].)
Phrasing carefully to get your resume
past the computerized gatekeeper
Most large employers electronically scan resumes for words that match their
job descriptions. To outsmart the computerized gatekeeper, follow these steps:
1. Make a list of 20 to 30 words or two-word combinations that you think
will most impress your target employer.
For example, if you’re looking for a job as a biotech scientist, you might
list: protein purification and molecular modeling and such soft skills as
communication.
Use nouns rather than verbs: manager of rather than managed and pro-
grammer rather than programmed. The resume-scanning programs gen-
erally look for such nouns.
Don’t know the right keywords for your target jobs? Pick them out of on-
target job ads.
255
Chapter 9: Crafting the Right Resume in Less Time

2. Insert into your resume as many of those words as you legitimately can.
Don’t, however, insert those that don’t accurately reflect you. They may
get you past the computer screening, but last I checked, companies still
use human beings to make actual hiring decisions. And those human
beings tend to probe your resume’s veracity.
Also, don’t insert keywords that would lead to jobs you don’t want. For
example, if you have a lot of sales experience, but want to get away from
sales, avoid the use of the word sales in your resume. Indeed, minimize
mention of your sales experience throughout your resume. Your resume
should highlight the things you want to do in your next job.
3. If some keywords don’t fit naturally into the body of your resume,
list them in a section at the end of your resume entitled, “Additional
keywords.”
Step 6: Write the Education Section
Normally, the education section follows the employment section, but list your
education first if it’s more impressive than your work achievements. This is
true of most job seekers just starting out.
Include your grade-point average if it’s at least 3.0 in your major or overall.
Also include any honors, like Dean’s List or cum laude. (No, second prize in
your fraternity’s belching contest doesn’t count.)
If you started but never finished college, simply list your years of attendance
and your major. For example:
1999–2000, Kegger College, major in sociology.
If you’re still working on your degree, write your expected graduation date.
If not obvious from your major, list courses that are particularly relevant to
your career goal. Include education outside of school, such as seminars. For
example, here’s David’s education section:
2006, Geohydrology issues in shoreline foundations. University of
California, Santa Barbara Extension.
2005, BS in Landscape Architecture, California State Polytechnic
University. San Luis Obispo, 3.3 overall grade-point average, 3.5 land-
scape architecture grade-point average.
256
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

Special career-applicable courses:
Three years of college-level Spanish. (moderate fluency)
Business courses in project management and finance.
If you learned things that may impress an employer, you might add “. . .
which taught me X.” For example: “BA in political science, which taught me
survey methodology, database management, and statistical analysis.”
If most of your career-relevant learning occurred outside of school, describe
it. Figure 9-3 shows the education section of an aspiring curator with a
career-irrelevant major and lots of out-of-school education.

Step 7: Decide on Optional Sections
Depending on your situation, add a section for awards, community involve-
ment, publications, computer skills, licenses, or professional affiliations. Only
include an affiliation if it’s likely to impress your target employers. Fellow of
the American Academy of Sciences, yes. Member of Hell’s Angels, no.
Step 8: Write the Personal Section
Here, list volunteer activities, personal interests, hobbies, and so on. This
section can sometimes be a door opener. Seeing a resume from a fellow back-
packer can move an employer to pick up the phone.
Step 9: List Your Highlights at the Top
This is the most important part of your resume. Here, spend time. In the few
seconds of attention that your resume may get, this is the only part you can
be sure will get read.
You have three options: Most people will choose just one, but if two are more
impressive in your case, include them both.
Option 1: A summary of accomplishments
In one line each, list the few accomplishments that will most impress your
target employer. Call it a summary.
SUMMARY
Received A.S.L.A. Award as landscape architect on U.S. Highway 1 shore-
line restoration project.
Top evaluations from supervisor: “Gets the job done right, plus he’s fun
to be around!”
Eight completed projects. (See online portfolio at dpwilens.com.)
Excellent customer satisfaction (many references available).
Solid knowledge of AutoCAD 2007 and TrackIt project management
software.
Led 12 friends on a trip down the Amazon.

Option 2: A paragraph of attributes
Alternately, you can write a short paragraph describing the things about
yourself most likely to impress your target employer. This is a good option if
you’re a good employee who can’t point to specific achievements. The key
here is to imagine yourself as the employer. What attributes would he most
value that you can honestly claim? Say you’re hankering for another general
medical-surgical nurse position:
SUMMARY: Four years as general medical-surgical nurse, known for
exceptional concern for patients and absolute accuracy in treatment and
in providing emotional support. Supervisor wrote, “Jan is thorough and
remarkably helpful not just to patients, but to all of us.”
Option 3: Your human story
The third option is a short paragraph that quickly tells your human story —
what brings you to wanting this job. Weave in the best thing(s) you bring to
the table. This is the preferred option if your best shot at the job is making a
human connection rather than selling your previous experience.
SUMMARY: I was able to work with a number of patent examiners as an
engineer at Loral. As time went on, I became fascinated with what they
do. After a year of intensive preparation, I now am eagerly seeking a
position as assistant patent examiner.
Often, the most qualified person doesn’t get the job. One reason: Another
candidate created chemistry. A resume summary and cover letter are excel-
lent ways to give you an edge when your actual qualifications are unlikely to
be best-among-the-bunch.
Step 10: Get Feedback
Show your resume to a respected friend and then to a personnel recruiter or
potential employer. Make any recommended changes.
John Sullivan, Professor of Management at San Francisco State University,
suggests that you have your reviewers circle all the items in the resume that
impress them, put an X through all items they don’t like, including typos, and
a question mark next to all items that confuse them or slow them down.
259
Chapter 9: Crafting the Right Resume in Less Time

Step 11: Create an Unformatted
Version of Your Resume
The resume you’ve just created is fully formatted, and in Microsoft Word. You
also need to create an unformatted version for pasting directly into an e-mail
or posting on an employment site.
You ask, “Why can’t I just send the formatted version? Everyone has MS Word.”
First, not everyone has Word. Also, some employers don’t like attachments
because they can have viruses and because they take time to open. In addition,
many employment Web sites require you to paste elements of your resume into
their site’s template. It’s more likely to look better if it’s unformatted.
Don’t worry. Creating an unformatted version of your resume is quick and
easy. Here’s how Margaret Riley Dikel, coauthor of The Guide to Internet Job
Searching, and resume writer Beth Brown recommend you do it:
1. Make a copy of your resume in MS Word.
Simply open your resume in MS Word, click “Save as,” and name the
copy something like “unformattedresume.doc.”
2. In that new copy of your resume, put your section headings in caps.
3. Use a plus sign to bullet items in a list.
4. Surround italicized words with asterisks.
5. Use the space bar instead of indents (for example, five spaces for one
indent).
6. Alter the margins so they’re 65 characters wide. To do that:
a. Go to the File menu, select Page Setup, and change the right margin
to 2”.
b. Select (shade) what you eyeball to be the longest line on the
resume.
c. Go to the Tools menu, select Word Count, and check how many
characters with spaces are on that line.
d. If the number is more than 65, make the margin bigger and 
re-check.
260
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

7. Make sure the unformatted text looks good in an actual e-mail:
a. Select (shade) the entire resume and press Control-C.
b. Go to your e-mail program (for example, Outlook Express or
Eudora) and press the key that creates a new e-mail.
c. Be sure your cursor is in the body of that e-mail. Then press
Control-V to insert your resume.
d. If anything doesn’t look right, go back to the unformatted version
of your resume you just created in MS Word, make needed
changes, and repeat steps a through c again.
8. As a final check, e-mail it to yourself.
9. Finis!
When you want to e-mail your resume to someone or post it on an employ-
ment site, just select (shade) that unformatted resume in MS Word and press
Control-C. Then move your cursor to the place in your e-mail or employment
site you want to insert your unformatted resume. Press Control-V to insert it.
In your e-mail cover letter to a prospective employer, write, “To ensure my
resume’s readability on your system, I enclose it two ways: an unformatted
version in this e-mail and a fully formatted version attached as an MS Word
file.”
Step 12: Stop Obsessing
and Start Celebrating
You’re done!

any interviews can feel like the Inquisition. This chapter shows how to
make it more like a first date: a pleasant discussion in which you’re
both trying to see whether you should get involved. This chapter also shows
you how to be your most impressive self while being honest.
Getting Ready for an Interview
As in most things, preparation is half the battle. Try the tips in the following
sections to get set for any job interview.
Study
I know, I know — everyone hates studying. But a little studying will pay big
dividends. Don’t worry, I’m not asking you to study calculus:
 Study the job description. Come up with 20-to-60-second anecdotes of
problems you’ve solved that are related to the job description. For
example, if you’re a new college graduate interviewing for a job as a PR
person, tell the tale of how you helped promote your fraternity’s suc-
cessful blood drive. Don’t, however, tell how you convinced the univer-
sity not to close down your fraternity following Bongo Night.
It’s always good to have an anecdote that demonstrates how quickly you
learned something. That attribute is valuable in nearly all jobs.

 Bone up on the field and the organization. You want to make clear that
you’re not just applying for jobs at random. So, brush up on your field’s
trends, key players, and lingo. Study the employer’s Web site and ask the
interviewer’s admin whether she knows of anything you can read or
someone you can talk with in preparation for your interview.
 Try to learn about your interviewer. Check with your network (see
Chapter 8 to find out who’s included in a network) or at least google
your interviewer. One of my clients thus discovered that her interviewer
volunteered in a Montessori school. So did the candidate, which gave
her a perfect topic for small talk before the formal interview.
 Bone up on any technical skills or knowledge required for the job. It
can be tempting to try to slide by on soft skills: organization, people
skills, and so on. These days, an ever-increasing percentage of jobs want
those skills plus technical knowledge. So, be prepared to strut your stuff.
Prepare
Next, get ready for these questions:
 “Why should we hire you over other candidates?” Technical expertise?
Work ethic? People skills? Use those 20-to-60-second anecdotes.
 The question(s) you most fear, such as, “Why did you leave your last
job?” Preparation is the best antidote to fear.
 Behavioral questions. As job seekers are ever-more prepped to answer
stock questions like, “Tell me your greatest weakness,” employers are
moving to behavioral questions in which you’re asked to describe what
you did in past work situations.
So, a potential employer may say to you, “Tell me about a conflict you
had with a boss or co-worker,” or “Describe a situation that demonstrates
your thinking skills.”
 Case questions. You may well be asked a case question: to describe how
you’d respond to a situation likely to occur in the new job. Example:
“Here’s a one-pager on a widget we’ll be introducing. Read it and then
lead a marketing meeting with the three of us.”
To see how well you think on your feet, Microsoft (and I imagine other
top employers) ask such questions as
• Why is a manhole round?
• How would you design a better vending machine?
• What’s your favorite Web site and how would you improve it?
264
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

To prepare for case questions, rehearse the following ritual:
1. Take a deep breath and a few moments to think before you speak.
The interviewer knows that case questions are the most challenging.
2. Take 10 or 15 seconds to jot down a couple of ideas. That will
structure your thinking.
3. In a calm, measured way, describe your approach. Qualify your
statements, saying, for example, “Of course, in the real world I
might want to look at some data and talk with some people, but
shooting from the hip, here are some thoughts that come to mind.”
Answers aren’t the only thing you need to prepare. In addition, you should
 Prepare a few questions to ask. Examples: “What would you hope I’d
accomplish in the first few weeks?” and “Where’s the best place around
here to get a massage?” Well maybe not that one. Want more ideas? Just
think of yourself in your first day on the job. What would you want to
know from your boss? No, not “Where is the bathroom?”
 Prepare a portfolio of your work. It’s axiomatic in education, screen-
writing, and sales: show, don’t tell. That also applies to job seekers.
Could you bring work samples to the interview? Of course artist types
bring portfolios and filmmakers bring sample reels, but other applicants
could bring a sample. Teacher? Bring a video of you in action. Computer
programmer? Bring a cool program you developed. Manager? Bring
thank-you notes from bosses, supervisees, or customers. If you’re a
sewage treatment worker, don’t bring a sample.
Practice
Now, just practice what you’ve developed earlier:
 Practice your 10- and 45-second pitches. Those explain what you do,
that you’re good, and why, if you’re so good, you’re looking for a new
job. Sample 10-second pitch: “I was a therapist at Kaiser, loved my work
and they loved me, but when my wife got a job in Florida, I had to
move.” The 45-second version would add an accomplishment or two
that would impress your target employer. If it’s your first job, talk about
relevant experiences at school. Check out Chapter 8 for more details on
coming up with 10- and 45-second pitches.
 Do a mock interview. Do one with a trusted friend and then pay a pro-
fessional career counselor or coach to do one with you. Have him record
it so you can review it together. Some state employment services offer
videotaped mock interviews for free.
265
Chapter 10: Impressive Interviewing

 Be ready to be quizzed on your resume. Most interviewers will have
your resume in front of them, and sometimes find it easiest to structure
the interview around it, even asking about that stupid little job you had
12 years ago.
Eighteen Ways to Create Chemistry
in an Interview
Alas, hiring is often based as much on gut feeling as it is on the hard merits.
So, you gotta connect chemically with the interviewer. In the following sec-
tions, I provide potent ways to ensure you do just that.
Check your body chemistry
Start with the basics. You can’t have chemistry with the interviewer if you
have bad breath or body odor.
Dress one notch above
Dress the way your future boss might. Don’t know what that’s like? Call the
receptionist or boss’s admin: “I’m coming in for an interview for a job working
for (insert potential boss’s name). Any suggestions for what I should wear?”
Arrive early
Arrive 20 minutes early. Then find the nearest coffee shop to hang out at for a
few minutes. Go over your notes, including your 10- and 45-second pitches,
why you’re looking, why you’re interested in this job, a few anecdotes of
problems you faced and solved, and answers to the questions you most fear.
(See the earlier section “Getting Ready for an Interview” for details on this
preparation.)
Walk into the building five minutes early. Get a feel for the place. Like it?
The interview starts the moment you enter the building and ends only when
you leave it. Why? Slouch into the building and the person next to you may
be the interviewer returning from lunch. After the interviewer says good-bye,
many applicants blow it by letting their guard down and saying something
stupid. My wife often asks her admin about a job candidate’s behavior.
266
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

Help yourself relax
Think back to a moment when you were confident. In the interview, pretend
you’re that self and remind yourself that millions of jobs are out there. If you
aren’t meant to get this one, it doesn’t mean you’ll be a bag lady.
If possible, learn something about the interviewer in advance, even if you
only ask the receptionist, “What can you tell me about Mr. Crasdale?” Even
knowing that Mr. Crasdale just came back from vacation will help you feel
more confident, like you have inside information, and in turn, more relaxed.
Try to have a good time from the get-go
A good time and a job interview seem to be mutually exclusive, but not nec-
essarily. Here are some ideas for enjoying an interview from start to finish:
 Enjoy the décor in the reception area.
 Try to figure out whether the interviewer is nervous.
 Check the interviewer’s office for clues to what she’s like: the family pic-
tures, the golf clubs in the corner, the desk that looks post-tornado.
 Listen well to the interviewer. Does it sound like she’d rather talk about
her upcoming vacation than “What is your greatest weakness?”
 When you’re asked a killer question, answer it quickly and move the
conversation to a more pleasant area.
 Ask the questions you’re curious about, the serious and the playful.
After you establish some credibility, it may enhance your image as a nice
person to ask a human question such as, “What do most people do for
lunch?”
Establish the first-date mindset
Many people think of a job interview as an interrogation: you’re sitting there
under a bare light bulb, bombarded with questions, many of which you can’t
answer.
As I mention in this chapter’s introduction, you can often make an interview
more like a first date, in which each of you has a chance to decide whether
you’re well-matched, logically and chemically. Treat an interview like a first
date, and you’ll both more wisely decide whether to hook up. A first-date 
mind-set also discourages you from assuming that too-formal, phony-appearing
job-seeker persona: “I believe I am uniquely qualified for the position,” or “I’m
seeking a position with a dynamic organization.”
267
Chapter 10: Impressive Interviewing

You also make an interview more like a date by asking a few questions during
the interview, not just at the end. Your questions can come from your pre-
interview research about the employer or as follow-ups to what the inter-
viewer said, but here are generic questions:
 What should I know about working here?
 Can you tell me a bit about the culture in this workgroup?
 To whom would I be reporting? What sort of person gets along best
with him?
 What do people say they like best and worst about working here?
 How many people have held this position in the past few years? Why did
they leave?
Most interviewers are glad to answer a few questions — indeed, questions
show intelligence and that you’re interested but not desperate. Too, their
answers can guide what you’ll say in the rest of the interview.
Make the most of the first ten seconds
Malcolm Gladwell, in Blink, asserts that you make a hard-to-change impression
in the first few seconds you meet someone. How to make a good first impres-
sion? It’s a sad commentary on human judgment, but just follow the advice
offered by Gary Ripple, author of Campus Pursuit: Smile, offer a firm handshake,
look the person in the eye (long enough that you know what color they are),
and pleasantly and confidently say, “Hi, I’m Joe Blow.” Wait to be invited to sit
down, then lean slightly forward, keep a pleasant look on your face (I said
pleasant, not psychotic), and maintain eye contact most of the time.
End the interview similarly. Smile, look the interviewer in the eye, shake his
hand, and, if true, say that you enjoyed the interview. If not, thank him for an
interesting experience.
Rehearse the above ritual ten times. It’s that important.
Avoid turn-off mannerisms
Richard Bolles, author of What Color Is Your Parachute, urges interviewees to
beware of trivial mannerisms that can nix you:
 You slouch in your chair.
 You fidget in your seat.
268
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

 You play with your hair or hands.
 You continually avoid eye contact.
 You’re overly negative.
 You’re too self-critical.
 You speak as quietly as a church mouse or as loud as a wrestling
announcer.
 You constantly interrupt the interviewer.
I add one more no-no: bragging. But you ask, “How can I let the interviewer
know good stuff about me without bragging?” Two ways: with those anec-
dotes demonstrating your abilities (see Chapter 9 for details), and by having
someone else brag for you. For example, you can say, “My co-workers always
say I’m the go-to guy when there’s a thorny problem.”
Really try to understand
the employer’s needs
Suppose you’re applying for a position as an accountant. The employer’s
main priority may be developing a new accounting system, improving
employees’ reporting practices, or even a desire to avoid an IRS audit. If you
understand the employer’s needs and show how you can meet them, you’ll
stand a much better chance of landing the job than if you simply answer the
interviewer’s questions blind.
269
Chapter 10: Impressive Interviewing
Avoiding uncomfortable questions about salary
Standard advice is to never bring up salary until
the job is offered, let alone early in the interview.
My clients find that conventional wisdom to be
wrong. Typically, somewhere in the interview,
the interviewer asks, “What is your current
salary?” or “What is your salary requirement?”
No answer to that question is helpful to you. So,
preempt the problem by striking first with a
question like, “The position seems to involve
(insert as high-level a description of the tasks
as possible). What salary range have you bud-
geted for the position?”
If they respond, “Well, how much are you look-
ing to make?” respond with, “I’m just looking to
be paid fairly. What have you budgeted for the
position?” If they continue to hedge, that’s a
sign you don’t want to work for them. If forced,
offer a wide range like “$65,000 to $85,000
depending on the scope of responsibilities.”
When negotiating as a self-employed person or
independent contractor, gather information
about his needs, describe what you can do to
meet them, and then give the cost.

Sometimes you can tease out an employer’s needs with questions such as,
“What sorts of issues are important for your new hire to address?” or even,
“Any problem you’re facing these days that is particularly worrisome?” Other
times, you simply need to listen well. The interviewer’s questions and state-
ments usually reveal her concerns.
In short, think of yourself as a consultant, helping the client to identify his
needs and then collaboratively figure out a way you can help solve them. To
that end, you may even offer to write a proposal or work on a small project.
That can really help you stand out in comparison with the other candidates.
Be yourself, but be your best self
By being your real self, whether it’s quiet, jovial, whatever, you’re not that
sanitized middle-of-the-road person that most job seekers try to be. As a
result, you’re more likely to end up at the top or at the bottom of the heap
than in the middle. Sure, if you’re not what they’re looking for, they’ll turn
you down. Fine! Better to show the real you before you commit to each other,
rather than after — just like marriage.
Having said that, I recognize that there are many “real yous”: The you zoning
out in front of the TV isn’t the same as the you working on your greatest
accomplishment. Be yourself, but be your best self.
Really listen and watch
Especially in an interview, most people listen poorly. You may be so worried
about how you’re coming across and so busy planning what to say next, that
you only half-attend to what the interviewer is saying and revealing with body
language. That’s a shame because you may miss crucial hidden messages:
 The interviewer may show what she’s mainly looking for in a candidate.
Example: She’s always talking about getting stuff done fast.
 The interviewer’s reactions may reveal what she likes and dislikes about
you. Does she, for example, start getting fidgety as you go on about the
latest technology?
 The interviewer may yield clues to what she or that workplace is really
like. Maybe you’ll discover you don’t want to work there if, for example,
an employer stresses the importance of teamwork on this job and you
go nuts when having to rely on others to get your work done.
270
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

 Look out for signs of empathy, such as when an interviewer says, “I’ve
only been here a few months myself.” That can relax you.
 Look out for signs of nervousness, perhaps because she’s afraid that if
she makes another bad hire, she could be fired. That too can relax you.
 When you’re really listening, you’re able to ask questions that follow up
on what the interviewer is saying — a great way to create chemistry.
Talk the right amount
Most comments should be 20 to 60 seconds long. More than that and you
risk sounding egocentric or putting your interviewer to sleep. If the inter-
viewer wants more information, she can ask a follow-up question. If your
utterances are generally less than 20 seconds long, especially if they’re
mainly one-sentence answers, an interviewer may think you’re withholding
or unknowledgeable.
Keep the Traffic Light Rule in mind: During the first 30 seconds of an utter-
ance, your light is green. During the next 30 seconds, it’s yellow — the risk
that your listener thinks you’re long-winded is increasing. After the 60-second
mark, your light is red: Yes, sometimes running a red light is okay (for exam-
ple, when you’re telling a truly fascinating anecdote), but almost always, you
should stop, perhaps asking a question.
Beware of interviewers who talk the whole time. You may think that will bene-
fit you, but according to an M.I.T. study cited in the 2007 edition of What Color
Is Your Parachute, unless you’re talking roughly half the time, your chances of
getting hired decline. So, if your interviewer won’t shut up, at an opportune
moment, interrupt and say something that would give you an opportunity to
talk, such as “Would you like me to share some thoughts on how I’d handle
this job?”
Ask one or more power questions
early in the interview
“What would a star be like in this job?” “Anything else?” “What are the most
important things you’ll want me to work on in the first few weeks on the job?”
The sooner you can ask these questions, the sooner you can start tailoring
your answers to what’s important to the employer. It’s like getting the
answers to the test in advance.
271
Chapter 10: Impressive Interviewing

To avoid sounding like you’re simply parroting back what the employer
wants, be sure to back up your claims with facts or anecdotes. For example,
if the boss says he’s most looking for someone with fire in the belly, it’s not
enough to say that you have drive. You need to back it with evidence that
you go the extra mile. This is the time to use one of those PAR stories: A
problem you faced, how you approached it, and its positive resolution. (See
Chapter 9 for more information about PAR stories.)
If you’re interviewing with a startup or other fiscally shaky employer, ask a
few questions about the company or workgroup, such as, “What’s been your
net earnings over the last couple of years? What’s your burn rate (monthly
expenses)? How long will you be able to sustain that rate?” Any ethical
startup will understand that you have the right to ask such questions.
Indeed, asking them tends to impress employers.
At the end of the interview, think about asking, “Do you have any remaining
concerns?” or “Based on what we’ve talked about today, I sense that I could
do this job well. Do you agree?” That gives you a chance to counter any
objections.
Stay connected with all your interviewers
A panel may conduct your interview. The regular interview rules apply with
the following additions. When responding, mainly look at your questioner but
occasionally establish eye contact with the others. When asking a question,
look mainly at the person you want to answer it, but if another panelist
seems eager to respond, give that person the nod to go ahead.
Bring up one weakness early on
Bringing up a weakness of yours can help you and the interviewer assess
whether you’re likely to be successful on the job. In bringing it up yourself,
not only do you demonstrate candor — unusual in a job candidate — but
you also allow an open discussion of how serious a liability the weakness
would be. That’s good for interviewer and interviewee. Take that team-
player example. You may say, “I’m looking for a job where I’ll have a lot of
autonomy. I find that, when I’m on teams, I tend to dominate or feel too
forced to constrain myself, but if you’re looking for a self-starter, that is
one of my strengths.”
272
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

Mirror the interviewer
If she’s strictly business, you should be too. If he’s social and playful, show
that side of yourself.
Reveal a bit about your personal life
Talk a little about your family, hobbies, and so on. If you get a good response,
reveal a bit more.
Know the secrets to video interviewing
To save travel costs and reduce scheduling hassles, employers increasingly
use video interviewing instead of face-to-face. Increasingly, the employer
simply mails the candidate a Webcam. You have only a few special things
to remember:
 You look shifty if your eyes avert to the side. You look depressed if your
head is tilted downward. The solution: When you’re talking, keep your
head straight and your eyes trained slightly above the camera.
 A lag exists between the video and audio transmission, so voices can
seem out of sync. Before answering a question, wait until you hear the
interviewer finish. Don’t rely on the video or you risk interrupting
the interviewer.
Other Keys to Wowing Interviewers
Here are more strategies that help make you the winning candidate.
Don’t just say you can do it — prove it
Many career guides tell job interviewees to focus on their accomplishments —
what they did in the past. I’ve found that interviewees are even more likely to
score by focusing on the present: by demonstrating — during the interview —
how they can help the employer.
273
Chapter 10: Impressive Interviewing

Imagine you’re director of sales for a publishing company and are interview-
ing two candidates for a sales job. Candidate A discussed his previous sales
experience while Candidate B pretended he was on a sales call and sold one
of your products to you. Assuming the candidates were otherwise equal,
which one would you hire?
Ask something like: “What’s a typical problem I might encounter on the job?”
After getting an answer, ask: “Can I show you how I might approach it?” Start
by asking the interviewer a question or two about the problem to give you
the information you need to craft a plan for addressing it. Then say, “In light
of what you’ve said, might this approach make sense? (Then outline it.) Of
course, I’d know much more if I were actually working on the project, but this
gives you a sense of how I might approach things.”
Maximize the good part of the interview
Give longer answers to questions you like, shorter answers to questions you
don’t. Many job seekers do the opposite. They keep trying to dig themselves
out of trouble and often just dig themselves deeper, and at minimum, ensure
that a larger proportion of the interview is spent on their weaknesses.
Also ask questions to redirect the interview to areas you want to talk about —
for example, the new job and how you’d approach its challenges.
Fit the job description to your strengths
Often, the employer knows she needs to hire someone but isn’t sure how to
best use the person. If, in the interview, you can help clarify that she needs
someone with your strengths, you may talk your way into a well-suited job.
Early in the interview, ask, “Is the job description mapped out or does it
depend on the candidate?” If there’s some play, the interviewer may be grate-
ful for your help. Ask her to tell you about some of the organization’s needs.
Then gently propose how the position may be structured to meet those
needs and how your strengths would be well suited. Example:
“You’ve identified two key problems: getting the staff comfortable with
the new computer program and reducing the backlog in processing
claims. That would be fun to tackle. My software training background
will help me in getting the staff comfortable with the computer program,
and I know I’ll enjoy figuring out how to streamline the claims process.”
274
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

If the job description is fluid, expect that you won’t get a job offer right away.
The employer probably won’t hire until he’s figured out what he wants. So,
focus on helping the hirer do just that. Offer to do a little homework that may
be helpful — for example, write a short proposal or report. That should put
you ahead of the competition.
Success at 40-plus
After 40, many job seekers start to worry about age discrimination. Here are
some antidotes:
 Dress your age, but well. Don’t try to look like a teeny bopper, but avoid
clothing worn only by the aged — string ties come to mind. Also, be sure
your clothes aren’t too tight. That accentuates your perhaps no longer
lithe body.
 Use good posture. Helen Gurley Brown was only slightly exaggerating
when she said, “After 40, it all comes down to posture.” Not sure about
yours? Stand naturally in front of a mirror.
 Reassure about your vigor. If you do have good energy, say so, perhaps
even mentioning your hobby as a skier or tennis player. Move purpose-
fully as you stride (not trudge) in, sit down, get up, and walk out.
Someone who seems to need a crane to get up from a chair may not
create the right impression.
 Sell your age as a plus. Wisdom (sometimes) comes with age. If true,
explain that your experience can help prevent mistakes that others may
have to learn on their own skin.
 Talk about new things you’ve learned over the years, especially those
relevant to the job you’re applying for. For example, a teacher may say,
“A decade ago, research started to indicate that phonics is — for low-
intelligence students — a better approach to teaching reading, so I
quickly learned how to incorporate it into my instruction. Now, with a
decade of experience with it, my kids’ test scores are higher than com-
parable kids’ scores in other teachers’ classes.”

Chapter 10: Impressive Interviewing
Employers’ revenge
Sick and tired of hearing job interviewees’ BS,
employers are starting to subject their finalist
candidates to a cram-proof, valid final test: the
day-long job simulation. The employer hires
them for a day and watches them doing the job
they’re being considered for.

Offer to fill other needs if you sense
you’re a poor match for the job
Sometimes, you can turn the lemon into lemonade. Try this:
“In listening to you, it sounds like I’m a poor fit for this position, but I’m
wondering if I might be of use to you in another way. What I bring to the
table are (insert your best attributes). Might someone with that back-
ground be of help to you?”
This is an example of industrial magnate Henry Kaiser’s famous advice to job
seekers: Find a need and fill it.
Sometimes, you may think you’ve done well in the interview but, by the end,
you nonetheless get the sense you won’t get the job. It’s worth asking, “Is
there any reason you’d be hesitant to hire me?” You may tease out an objec-
tion you can successfully counter.
After the Interview: When the Job
Is Often Won or Lost
Right after the interview, while everything’s fresh in your mind, grade yourself
on the Interview Report Card I talk about here, and draft a thank-you note. Then
prime your references and make follow-ups.
The Interview Report Card
Grading yourself on this report card helps you in future interviews. Without
it, you may be tempted to deceive yourself into thinking that you did better
than you did. Ask yourself the following questions to see how well you did:
 Did your face, voice, and body language convey interest?
 Did you create a good impression in those crucial first few seconds?
 Did you share a weakness early? Did it seem to help or hurt you?
 Did you listen well?
 Did you describe the accomplishments most likely to impress the
interviewer?
276
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

 Did you not just tell, but also demonstrate, that you could do the job?
 Did you ask questions during the interview, not just at the end?
 Did your questions help you get clearer about whether you want this job?
 Did you talk roughly half of the time?
 Did your comments rarely exceed one minute in length?
 Did you show caring about the people, asking personal questions as
appropriate?
 Did you show that you care about the organization’s product or service?
 Did you reveal an appropriate amount about your personal life?
 Did you mirror the interviewer’s style?
 Were you honest enough?
 Were you your best self?
 Were you able to have a reasonably good time?
 Would you hire yourself for this job?
Ahead-of-the-pack thank-you letters
It’s best if you can draft the darn thank-you letter right after the interview.
Then let it sit overnight, review it with fresh eyes, and mail or e-mail it.
I’m frequently asked, “Should I send my thank-you note via e-mail, or should I
send a handwritten note?” It depends on the recipient. Trust your intuition.
Richard Bolles, in What Color Is Your Parachute, suggests you do both.
A thank-you letter can do more than say thank you. It enables you to
 Remind the interviewer of the things he was most impressed with. “I’m
pleased you think my experience managing designers would be valuable.”
 Give a better answer to a question you flubbed. “I’ve given further
thought to that question you asked about polymerase chain reactions.”
 Say more about things the interviewer cares about. “There was one
more thing I thought you might be interested in.”
 Reiterate your interest in the position.
Figure 10-1 shows a letter that accomplishes all this.
277
Chapter 10: Impressive Interviewing

References
Ask potential references whether they’re willing to serve. That can avoid sur-
prise bashings. Try this wording: “I was hoping to use you as a reference. Do
you feel you’re in a position to provide a strong one?”
When a prospective employer is ready to call your references, you call them
first. Explain the ways you’re well suited to the job and the issues you’d like
your reference to address.
If you’re employed, ask hirers to defer contacting your references, especially
your current employer, until ready to hire you. You don’t want your current
boss to find out you’re looking if you don’t actually get a job offer. And even if
you’re excited about a possible job, don’t tell anyone who may tip off your
current employer. Hot prospects often turn cold. The career battlefield is lit-
tered with people who talked about their next job too soon and got shot
down by their current boss who didn’t want an employee he couldn’t count
on. Hold off until you’ve signed the new job offer. Trust me on this one.
The end game
Often, this is where the game is won and lost. Most employers appreciate
polite persistence.
Dear Nadine,
I really enjoyed the opportunity to interview with you. The dyslexia project is 
generating some impressive results. I am pleased that you think my background in 
pathology would be helpful and look forward to the possibility of joining your staff.
You asked a question that got me thinking. You asked what sort of study I think 
would be the most valuable next step. On reflection, I think we’d get valuable 
information from doing PET scans of dyslexic children of different ages to better 
understand how cerebral structure and function change developmentally. That 
could point us to the best times to provide educational as well as physiological 
interventions.
I am excited about the prospect of working for you.
Sincerely,
Allan Gold
Figure 10-1:

thank-you
note as

278
Part III: Landing That Cool Job 

A few days after sending your thank-you letter, call to ask where you stand. If
you’re not the front-runner, ask, “Is there anything that makes you hesitant to
hire me?” If a concern is raised, explain why it’s unjustified (if it is), have a
reference do so, or offer to provide a work sample — a report, proposal, or
one-day trial, for example. End the call by affirming that you’re eager and
confident you can do the job. If it doesn’t feel too pushy, say something like,
“Of course, we only scratched the surface. If you might find it useful, I’d be
pleased to talk further with you.” Send a follow-up note reiterating all this.
If the job is worth using up some of the goodwill of one of your references,
ask him to phone the hirer to say how wonderful you are.
Two weeks later, if you haven’t heard anything, you can send a letter that
says, “You and I discussed (insert topic). I came across this article and
thought you might be interested. I’m still interested in the position and hope
to hear from you soon.”
Dismissing a full-time employee has become extraordinarily difficult, so
employers take extra time to make a hiring decision. Expect multiple inter-
views and possibly employment testing. This is especially likely when the job
description is fluid. Keep trying to help the hirer develop the job description
and you’ll more likely get the job.
Handling Job Offers and Rejections
It’s finally over. Unless the employer failed to even give you the courtesy of
a rejection letter, the results are in: you got a job offer or not. Here’s how to
make the most of both situations.
You got the job offer!
Congratulations! Being offered a job is a great feeling, but don’t sound too
eager. At minimum, it will hurt you when negotiating the terms of your employ-
ment. I even know a case in which excess enthusiasm resulted in a retracted
job offer. The employee was so ecstatic that he appeared desperate. That
motivated the employer to check his references more closely than he other-
wise would have, whereupon the employer developed buyer’s remorse and
offered the position to another candidate.
The right response to a job offer that you’d consider is a moderately enthusi-
astic, “I’m pleased. Can we set up an appointment in a couple of days to dis-
cuss salary and other terms of employment?”
279
Chapter 10: Impressive Interviewing

Someone else got the job, but all’s not lost
If someone else lands the job and you’re in mourning about it, phone the
interviewer or, if a group interviewed you, the nicest interviewer. Say some-
thing like, “I’m disappointed. I believe I could have done a good job for you.
Might I ask what made you hesitant to hire me? Anything else? (That follow-up
question often yields something valuable.) I want to know if there’s something
I need to work on.” Close with, “If by any chance your situation changes, I
hope you’ll keep me in mind. Would you mind if I phoned you back in a
month to follow up? And is there anyone else you think I should talk with?”
Despite all efforts, even the best candidates get rejected a lot. The successful
job seeker sees whether he can learn anything from it, doesn’t allow himself
to get frustrated, and moves on to the next constructive task.
A rejection after you’ve revealed your true best self is often a blessing.
Wouldn’t you rather hold out for someone who wants you for who you are?

Making Any
Career Cooler

In this part . . .
You buy a suit. Off the rack, it probably looks just
okay. To really look terrific, you need to tailor and
accessorize it to fit your body and tastes. The same is true
with your career.
In this part, I show you how to tailor and accessorize an
off-the-shelf career so you’re maximally likely to be happy
and successful. For example, I show you how to get your
assigned tasks changed so they match your strengths,
how to reduce your job stress, and how to become a
beloved employee — or at least a fire-resistant one.
Another way to make your career cooler is to overcome
the tendency to procrastinate. In this part, I do my best to
light a fire under you.
Yet another way to make your career cooler is to be your
own boss. In the final chapter of this part, I show you how
to become successfully self-employed, even if you’re not a
born entrepreneur.

Chapter 11
Making the Most of Any Job
In This Chapter
 Tailoring your job to fit your strengths
 Becoming a star . . . or at least fire-resistant
 Staying fresh
 Succeeding when you’re just starting out, in mid-career, and a Boomer
 Earning your three-minute MBA
 Moving up and moving out
You’ve completed the first two of the three steps to a satisfying worklife:
You’ve selected a career and landed a job in that career. Now I turn to
what may be the most important step: making the most of that job.
Most people who love their jobs appreciate six things about it:
 A good boss and co-workers
 A moderate workload
 Work that’s interesting
 Moderate stress
 Winning at office politics
 Fair compensation
This chapter shows you how to maximize your chances of having the first five.
My favorite book on negotiation is Jim Camp’s Start with No (Crown Business).
Managing Your Boss
Do you change readily? Neither do bosses. So it’s best if you can start out
with a good boss. How to maximize your chances of that? Job search vigor-
ously so you get multiple job offers and can pick one with a good boss. Other
chapters in this book urge you to ask questions during the interview and
after being offered the job. That should help you avoid the clinkers.

But assume it’s too late for all that. And assume it’s the worst case: You’ve
been assigned to the boss from hell. Even if this is your first day on the job, if
even a remote possibility for a better option exists, request the transfer right
away. Changing bosses before everything is cast in stone is often easier.
No dice? Try the fixes in the following sections for dealing with a bad boss or
making the most of a good one.
Tailoring the job to fit you
Give your boss a suggestion or two for tailoring the job to fit you. Can any of
these make your career cooler?
 A revised job description that capitalizes on your strengths and mini-
mizes your weaknesses. For example, a programmer who’s good at trou-
bleshooting but lousy at design may offer to trade roles with another
programmer who’s the opposite.
 A piece of equipment. An architect’s life can be made easier by getting
his own CAD terminal.
 Alternate work hours. Working from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. instead of 9 to 5
avoids traffic jams and allows you to watch your kid’s Little League games.
 Autonomy. A manager at a Web 2.0 business got permission to take full
charge of a new part of the site, from design to marketing.
 A new challenge. A biotechnician got the okay to use a cutting-edge
technique for his next experiment.
 More feedback. Feedback junkies enjoy being kept apprised of how
they’re doing.
 More time in the field or in the office. A salesperson was supposed
to spend most of his time in the field but, on many appointments, felt
unprepared. So he requested more time in the office to learn more about
his client before the appointment. It was granted.
 Changing who you work with. A manager had worked well with an
employee in another unit. She got that person transferred to her
department.
 Dressing unconventionally. All the co-workers in my client’s workplace
wear ties. My client hates ties. He got his boss to make an exception
for him.

Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

Developing wonderful
communication skills
Are you trying to get something from your boss (or co-worker or lover)?
Needing to get out of trouble? Communication skills are key. Most people
think they’re terrific communicators — but few actually are. These tips
may help:
 Learn your boss’s decision-making style. It boils down to two ques-
tions: Is she fact- or emotion-driven? Fast- or slow-paced? Respond
accordingly. If you have a slow-paced, emotion-driven boss, you’d be
foolish to barge into his office rapid-firing, “Hi, Joe. If we do A, B, and C,
I think we can generate big bucks. Whaddya think?” Yet the same
approach can work with a fact-driven, fast-paced boss.
 Curious, not convince. When you’re annoyed with your boss (or a co-
worker or a loved one), it’s tempting to try to convince her of the error
of her ways. Alas, that rarely results in future improvement. Think back
to the last time you tried that. Did it help?
Here’s a better approach. Rather than trying to convince the other
person that he’s screwed up, recognize that there’s usually another
side to the story. Ask questions demonstrating your curiosity about
that other side. Remember this mantra: Curious, not convince. Try
starting your next tough talk with a sentence like, “I’m unhappy
because (insert perceived wrongdoing), and I’m wondering if there’s
something I’m not understanding.” Then really listen to the other
person’s perspective. That requires 100 percent of your attention —
you have no room for judging or devising solutions. You’ll have time
later for solutions. When the person stops talking, and you sense more
could be said, just wait, say “mm-hmm,” or ask a question that encour-
ages him to say more.
 When your protagonist makes an accusatory statement, paraphrase
it back. Doing that shows you really hear the statement, forces you
to better understand the other person’s perspective, and usually
serves as a more helpful response than your first instinct: “You idiot!”
So when she says, “You’ve been slacking off,” you may respond with,
“I can understand why you’d think that. I have been taking long
lunches.” Then, she may be more open to hearing your explanation,
which may be something like, “I’ve been having a hard time working
in this room with all the noise. So, from noon to 2, I’ve been going to
a coffee shop to work. I get a lot more done. Can I show you what I’ve
been accomplishing?”
285
Chapter 11: Making the Most of Any Job

 Get your boss or co-worker to come up with a solution. How do you
feel when someone says, “You should do X”? Chances are, your internal
reaction is, “No!” Few people like to be told what to do. The key to get-
ting someone to change is to try to get him to come up with a solution.
Ask questions that make that possible, such as: “So it sounds like our
inventory database is causing the problem. Any sense of what should be
done?” If your counterpart gets stuck, and you want to propose a solu-
tion, say, “John, would you mind if I suggest something?” Getting his per-
mission makes him more likely to feel some ownership of the idea.
 Conclude by asking the other person to summarize what’s been agreed
to. And then if true, thank her for making a difficult conversation easier.
These tips are just the beginning. In the following sections, I provide addi-
tional guidance on some of the personality types you may encounter.
If the boss is a hothead
Don’t take it personally. The louder she yells, the sorrier for her you should
feel, but don’t dismiss everything she says. Just because the tone is off-
putting doesn’t mean the feedback is invalid. Try to judge what she says on
its merits and not its tone. If you want to discuss a criticism with a hothead,
be sure to use those excellent communication skills.
It’s usually wisest to let the person vent it all out, and then ask whether you
might go to the bathroom. When you return, she’s likely calmed down and
more open to hearing your response.
If, despite trying to make changes to improve, you find yourself continually
having to endure tirades or passive-aggressive attacks, get a transfer or quit.
You deserve better.
If the boss is a micromanager
Use a Zen approach. Fight back by not resisting. Keep your boss as informed
as possible. For example, offer to e-mail him an update each day. There’s a
decent chance that after your boss sees that you’re someone he can trust,
he’ll redirect his micromanaging to less trustworthy types. And remember,
sometimes a supervisor micromanages because you do need a lot of guidance.
Before resenting the close supervision, ask yourself whether you might benefit
from it.
If the boss is lazy or incompetent
You won’t change these tendencies. Work hard at accepting her as she is. Just
as you wouldn’t be furious at a developmentally disabled child’s inability to
perform, you must react that way with an incompetent or lazy boss. As you
plan, of course, don’t count much on her. Ask only for the most crucial
things. If you need support, look for it elsewhere.
286
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

Maintaining a Moderate Workload
Your perfectly good job can become miserable in a hurry when you have too
much work or the work is too hard. The following sections show ways to cut
your workload down to size.
Working at home
Of course, many people don’t want to work at home. They’d miss the office
chitchat, find goofing off too tempting, or discover they live next door to
someone who practices the drums all day.
For many others, though, telecommuting, for at least part of the week, is great.
I work at home and I love it. I work relaxed — no worry about someone looking
over my shoulder. And I’m much more efficient. When I used to work in an
office building, I was faced with nonstop meetings and interruptions such as
“Let me tell you about my daughter’s sweet sixteen.” Now, when I want to work,
I work. And when I want to socialize, I chat on the phone or invite someone to
lunch. Between clients, I get to play the piano or play with my cat. My normal
writing attire: underwear. Try that in an office! I don’t have to waste time get-
ting dressed for success — unless you call Jockey shorts and uncombed hair
dressed for success — and I have a ten-second commute.
Here are keys to keeping your boss and yourself happy as you merrily work
at home:
 Reassure your boss. Many bosses are control freaks. They’re afraid that
if you’re out of sight, your work is out of mind. They have visions of you
sleeping ’til noon, watching soaps ’til 3, and squeezing in a smidge of
work before your kids come home at 3:30. Offer to document how you
use your time to stop your boss from losing sleep over that lavish
lifestyle she thinks you’re living on company time.
Remind your boss that she’s saving on office space and that you’ll be a
more effective employee now that you can start work each day without
hours worth of makeup, hair-styling, and a draining commute. Besides,
she has an employee who’s happier, and therefore less likely to bolt for a
job paying a few pesos more.
 Set limits. Your boss may be at least partly right. Work at home and you
have endless temptations: morning tennis, housecleaning, a call to your
girlfriend, and, yes, the refrigerator — telecommuting can be a diet killer.
And, of course, the biggest impediment to a successful telecommuting
day is kids. If you have young children, it may be worth getting childcare
so you can work in peace.
287
Chapter 11: Making the Most of Any Job

 Be your own OSHA inspector. In most workplaces, especially larger
ones, the employer takes steps to ensure an ergonomically reasonable
workplace. Telecommuters also are entitled to one. Be sure your chair is
adjustable, the keyboard is placed so your wrist needn’t strain, and if
you use the phone much, you have a headset. Yeah, I know they look
dorky, but they feel wonderful.
 Try to get compensation for telecommuting. If you’re working at home,
your employer saves office space, furniture, utilities, phone, computer
costs, and so on. Why should you have to pay for all that?
 Stay in the loop. Telecommuters often are passed over for promotions —
out of sight, out of mind. Especially if you’re telecommuting more than a
day a week, be sure to stay in the loop — phone and e-mail colleagues
frequently, and don’t miss the company picnic.
For a portal to articles about telecommuting, see telecommuting.
about.com.
Time-efficiency, no matter where you work
Even if you don’t work at home, you still have a variety of options for keeping
your workload moderate. Why not try the following strategies?
 Make time-efficiency your mantra. Have a little voice always on your
shoulder whispering, “Is this the most time-effective way?” Not the
fastest, not the best, but the optimum balance of the two — that’s what
time-effectiveness means.
 Adjust your quality standards to suit the task. Ask yourself whether
you’re doing some of your tasks too perfectionistically.
 Use the one-minute struggle. Rarely does struggling with a problem for
more than a minute result in a solution. It usually just results in more
frustration. So when you reach a roadblock, struggle for no more than
one minute. At that point, decide that your imperfect solution is good
enough, that you need help, or that you can complete the project without
solving that problem.
 Ask the most efficient person you know to watch you work for a half-
hour and then have her offer suggestions for how you can improve.
 Get your job tasks realigned. You’ll get more done faster if you spend
maximum time using your strengths and minimum time using your weak-
nesses. A lawyer was great at drafting documents, but a paralyzed wimp
in the courtroom. He arranged to trade tasks with another of the firm’s
lawyers who was the opposite.
 Outsource some work. You’re already managing time well: You priori-
tize, you try to be efficient, you BlackBerry even in the bathroom. Yet
you rarely catch up. If you can’t offload work onto a co-worker or get
288
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

permission to hire a temp or consultant, find an intern. After clearing
it with your boss, post a position announcement at a local college’s
internship office.
 Just say no. Of course, sometimes that’s impossible, but often you can
say no without hurting your career. One of my clients, insecure by
nature, felt that the only way he would be deemed worthy is saying yes
to everything. He was known as the designated workhorse and worked
an average of 60+ hours a week. He got laid off anyway, in part because
he was often exhausted and resentful about his workload. In his next
job, we agreed that he would learn to say no. When he was hired again,
he asked whether he should put in long hours for the first few weeks to
get off to a good start. I urged him not to because it would create the
expectation that he’d always work that hard. So, he limited himself to
50 hours a week, and when asked to do tasks that would take him
beyond those 50 hours, he would say, “My plate is full. Would you like
me to substitute this (the proposed new task) for something else I’m
working on?” He’s much happier . . . and, six months later, still employed.
Keeping Your Job Interesting
You spend more waking hours at work than any other activity. Don’t let your-
self get bored. The following sections show you how.
Compose a mission statement
Have a personal mission statement and, where possible, allocate your time
accordingly. Mine is: “To use my best skill — the ability to communicate
verbally and in writing — in the service of helping people with their work-
lives, exposing higher education as America’s most overrated product, and
advocating for a now-neglected group: boys.”
So, for example, if a publisher asked me to write a book on small business
marketing, I’d say no. If I were asked to write an exposé of higher education,
I’d enthusiastically agree.
Propose a special project
Sometimes, all you need is a special project. During a tour of my friend Pat’s
house, I noticed a wall of awards she had received from her various employ-
ers. I asked her, “What’s the secret of your success?” not really expecting an
answer. To my surprise, she offered one: “On every job, I propose a special
project that I’d find fun and that would please my boss.” What project can you
propose that would inject some pleasure into that humdrum job of yours?
289
Chapter 11: Making the Most of Any Job

Perhaps your boss may indulge your do-gooding desires and, for example, let
you spearhead an adopt-a-school program, or even give you a half-day-a-week
released time to do community service. Brian Kelly, President of Napa’s
Charter Oak Bank, requires all his employees to do community service.
Develop a mentoring relationship
A mentoring relationship can help keep your job interesting. Have a role
model? If so, tell the person that. Ask his advice about something. If that
works well, ask something else later. And it shouldn’t be a one-way street, so
look for an opportunity to do something for him.
Can’t think of someone you’d like as a mentor? Perhaps be a mentor to some-
one else at work. It doesn’t need to be someone young. Sometimes, an older
worker can use counsel on something, perhaps some new technology that
you’re whiz-bang at.
Or form an online or in-person support group, perhaps among people who do
what you do, in and outside your organization.
Or join a ready-made group. For a listing, check www.shersuccess
teams.com.
Find a fun hobby
Build a cool avocation into your after-work life. One of my clients, a Fortune
500 manager, works during his lunch hour on a screenplay he hopes to sell
to Hollywood. Another client takes an hour during most workdays to hit a
bucket of golf balls. “It makes me feel like I have a great job — I can go to the
driving range in the middle of the day.”
Weave your hobby into your job
More often than you may think, you can incorporate your hobby into your
job, like these people did:
 Ann Flexer, who works at the Edelweiss jewelry store in Berkeley,
California, plays the guitar when business is slow — it passes the
time while attracting customers.
 An interior designer who liked photography took before-and-after
photos not only of the job but also of her clients and families, posted
them on the company site, and sent 8-x-10-inch prints to her clients as a
thank-you.

Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

 Way back when I was a teacher, I felt out of place with the mostly female
faculty. In the break room, conversation typically centered around such
matters as Cuisinarts and toilet training — not high on my interests list.
One of my hobbies is breeding roses. One day, I brought a bouquet into
the faculty room to the oohs and ahhs of the teachers. From then on,
I brought in a fresh arrangement each week. Before long, I developed a
reputation as the school romantic and became a favorite of the teachers
and the principal.
Can you think of a way of incorporating a current or past hobby into your
worklife?
Make a lateral move
Sometimes, your current job is hopelessly dull. Can you make a lateral move?
Examples:
 A biologist had spent years on bacterial biofilm but saw that another
division of the company was working on a cool mouse gene project. He
pitched his boss and the mouse-project boss, and got his transfer into
a whole new job. Note: You’re more likely to get to do new work within
your current organization, where you’re trusted. An outside employer is
likely to hire you to do what you’ve been doing.
 An admin had always wanted to spend some time in Europe. When she
heard the company was expanding into Spain, she begged her way into
getting to help open their Barcelona office.
The World’s Shortest Stress
Management Course
I’m prone to being stressed. I believe I secrete more adrenaline than the
average person. That scared me because I knew that high-stress people
die younger. In addition, I saw that being a high-stress person was hurting
my career and personal life. No one wants to be around someone who’s
stressed out.
In contrast, I saw that most successful people appear calm. For example, when
watching C-SPAN, I noticed that most congresspeople and expert witnesses,
among the nation’s most influential people, remain calm, even when negotiat-
ing the world’s most important issues. So I figured that to get what I want, I too
need to be calm.

Chapter 11: Making the Most of Any Job

So, I’ve worked hard to figure out how to keep my stress under control. Here
is what I’ve learned. I’ll never be a laid-back person, but the following strate-
gies have helped me, and subsequently my clients.
Stop rushing
At age 20, I visited Europe for the first time. I recall standing in the Louvre
around 2 p.m. thinking, “If I can get through the Louvre in an hour, I can
probably fit in Versailles before the end of the day.” That was typical. My
addiction to adrenaline, fed by always trying to cram in as many activities
as possible, kept me from enjoying whatever I was doing and made me a
more stressful person.
Lesson Learned: Do everything at a comfortable pace. Rarely is rushing
worth it. Even good emergency room doctors rarely rush — they proceed
with focus, but without rushing.
Be accepting
Live by the serenity prayer: May I have the serenity to accept the things I
cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the
difference. In the workplace, everyone has projects they’d rather not do,
but must. Yet some workers get stressed about it while others accept the
inevitable.
On a related note: Accept people’s fallibility. Everyone encounters people
who are stupid, thoughtless, and even mean. You may even be married to
one. People are incredibly hard to change — even PhD-toting psychologists
often fail to fundamentally change their clients. If you can’t cut the person
out of your life, try to view him with charity rather than judgment: “We all
have flaws. He’s doing the best he can.” People who are angered by or try to
fix other people usually live stress-filled lives, and rarely change them much.
You can refine but rarely remold.
Conserve your emotional energy units
You can often reduce your job stress by being conscious of how you expend
your emotional energy units. Every day you start out with a full supply, but if
you expend your energy units too rapidly, you’re burned out before the end
of the day. As you feel stress, ask yourself, “Am I expending my energy units
wisely?”

Susannah, a home health nurse, came to me complaining of burnout. On
questioning, it was clear that most of her burnout was caused by just three
of her 30 patients. Those three refused to cooperate and their families were
unhelpful and often loudly drunk. I asked her to consciously try to conserve
her energy units while visiting those patients. A few days later, Susannah
called and excitedly told me that the simple technique reduced her burnout
enough that she no longer felt a need to change jobs.
Find support from someone fun
In ever-more-pressured workplaces, without a fun person to break things up,
you can gyrate yourself into a whirling work dervish. The funmeister offers
badly needed respites: a joke he pulled off the Internet, gossip about who’s
seeing whom, or a recipe for Last-Request Chocolate Cake. Recruit a funster
onto your support team.
Decorate your workspace with flair
Many people feel less stress if they have an attractive workspace. Even all
cubicles aren’t alike. Want one near the window with the view? Far from the
elevator? Near the chatterboxes? Away from them? Even if your cube is run-
of-the-mill, your job may feel a bit less stressful if you decorate it to suit you.
I recall one cubicle with an Oriental rug on the floor, oil paintings on the
walls, and an Asian fountain on the desk.
Get permission to bring your pet to work
Fourteen of Vermont’s Small Dog Electronics’ employees bring their pets
to work. And to boot, the employer pays 80 percent of their veterinary
insurance. Workers and management rave: Not withstanding the occasional
piddle, flea visitation, and dog-phobic employee, pets at work reduce stress,
increase employee loyalty, and save employees the time and cost of a pet
sitter. Pet perk — a great idea. The Web site www.dogfriendly.com/
server/general/workplace lists hundreds of employers with pet-friendly
policies. See whether your boss will bite.
Watch for early signs of stress
My neck starts to feel tight when I’m stressed out. When that happens, I take
lessons from the yogis: I make sure my posture is good and take a few slow
deep breaths. I may get up and stretch. I also often take a walk around the
block or put on some music.
293
Chapter 11: Making the Most of Any Job

The next time you lose your cool, ask yourself, “What was the first clue I was
getting stressed?” From then on, promise yourself to take preemptive action,
even if it’s just to remind yourself that it’s only 15 minutes until your lunch
break.
Think less and act more
When I’m already stressed, I ask myself, “Is there anything I can do right now
to fix the problem?” If yes, I try to do it. If the answer is no, I immediately
divert my attention by asking myself, “What do I want to do now?”
So many people analyze a problem to death: analysis paralysis. After a mod-
erate amount of thinking, try something, anything. Figuring out an alternative
approach is easier when you get feedback on what you’ve tried. Think less;
act more.
Take three breaths and leave
Some people have short fuses — they go from calm to explosive in one second.
So often they find themselves looking back and thinking, “I wish I hadn’t said
that.” If that sounds like you, take the time to develop the habit — the second
you start to feel angry — of taking three slow deep breaths, and if another
person is the target of your anger, leaving the room. When you leave the room,
ask yourself, “In the long run, will I be better or worse off if I get angry about
this?” If, on reflection, you conclude that exploding is worthwhile, fine. You
made a conscious choice to do it instead of letting your adrenaline dictate your
behavior. But fact is, you will rarely decide it’s worth getting angry.
Be in the moment
Everyone has reasons to be upset about things in the past. Thinking about
them rarely helps. Rather, it usually increases your stress. Likewise, you
shouldn’t look too far ahead. When writing my first book, I focused on getting it
done. I lived for the moment when I could see the book finished. That looking-
forward orientation gave me one moment of pleasure but deprived me of thou-
sands of good moments during the writing process — most work is filled with
many little interesting problems to solve. Since then, I strive to stay in the
moment, trying to derive pleasure in whatever I’m doing that minute. I find 
that makes work less stressful . . . sometimes.

Winning at Office Politics
without Selling Your Soul
Employees often complain, “I can’t take the politics,” when they really mean,
“I can’t win at the politics.” Here’s a top-ten list for keeping your star rising
and your back unstabbed.
 Be powerfully placed. Here’s the ideal: You’re in a department that’s
central to the organization, well funded, involved with a core or hot prod-
uct, and led by a rising-star boss. If not, can you angle for a transfer?
 Get tasks that are high priority and visible. For example, it’s usually
better to be on the team that’s creating a new joint venture with a big
Chinese firm than to be on a team in charge of maintaining low-priority
accounts. Usually, the people on that China project team will be the
organization’s best, and your contribution to the project’s success is
more likely to be noticed. To boost your chances of getting on the team,
you might, in this example, along with your request, submit a little
report you did on similar joint ventures.
 Even if you’re a clerk, think like a CEO. Think of a way to streamline a
procedure, build the bottom line, or make employees’ lives easier.
 Don’t wink in the dark. Cautiously self-promote. To get ahead, higher-
ups must know how good you are. How do you let them know without
press releases? Career coach Kate Wendleton recommends having a 
one-sentence message ready. For example, when your boss’s boss sees
you in the elevator and asks, “How are you, Sam?” instead of the usual,
“Fine, Ms. Moneybags, how are you?” occasionally try something like,
“Great. I just closed a deal with Astrogel.” As writer Angela Durden says,
when you work hard without promoting yourself, “it’s like winking at a
girl in the dark — you know what you’re doing, but no one else does.”
Unless you decide it’s wiser for your boss to get the kudos, get credit for
your brainchild. When you come up with a good idea or have drafted an
impressive document, run it by a trusted colleague to be sure it isn’t
stupid. If it passes muster, bring it up at a staff meeting or e-mail the
staff “to get feedback” on the idea. That way, everyone knows the gem
was yours.
Don’t rub your good work in co-workers’ faces, especially weak em-
ployees’. They can be saboteurs. Instead, keep a record of everything
good you do — useful at salary review time or if enemies try to build 
a case against you.
 Make your boss look good. Support him where you can. When you do a
project, be sure to give due credit for your boss’s assistance.
295
Chapter 11: Making the Most of Any Job

 Use the keys to excellent communication (I describe them in the earlier
section “Developing wonderful communication skills”).
 Get feedback. Ask co-workers how you’re doing. Anything they wish
you’d improve? Early feedback gives you time to fix things before you’re
a marked person.
 Befriend a wise old soul. Having a confidant who knows the political
ropes really helps. Often these wise old souls no longer are interested in
climbing the ladder. They’d rather play an avuncular role, passing on
words of wisdom to the next generation.
 Make friends in low places. Often, employees such as receptionists and
janitors know what’s going on, and may be more likely than higher-ups
to give you the inside scoop.
 Perform unrandom acts of kindness. Bake cookies for the office, look
for legitimate reasons to compliment others, or throw a TGIF office
party. Not only will doing such things help you politically, but you’ll also
enjoy your job more.
This list is all well and good, but in the real world, even if you play positive
politics perfectly, employees can gang up on you: They may be threatened by
you or dislike you, if only because you dress too nicely. Suppose that, as in
The Apprentice TV series, three officemates decide, if only subconsciously, to
form an alliance against you. They do plenty to make you look bad: keeping
you out of the information loop, never supporting your proposals, not priori-
tizing getting your projects done, never offering to help you. And they bad-
mouth you: “That Linda. She really gets more credit than she deserves.” And
if you dare show even a hint of frustration with them, they run to your boss
complaining that you have a bad attitude that’s destroying office morale.
Even though you’re a good employee, you can see that their machinations
can get you fired. What should you do?
Assuming you prefer not to quit, in addition to positive politics strategies,
you can:
 Store your ammunition. Keep a list of everything you do to try to build
relationships with alliance members — from helping them out when
they’re overworked to those brownies you bring in. Brownies are potent
political weapons.
 Try to neutralize your enemies. Ask them about things they’re interested
in, take coffee breaks with them, and so forth.
 Gently confront the group. Convene a formal meeting with them. Recount
your efforts to work well with them. Ask what you can do to improve the
office environment. Don’t expect them to offer to change anything. That’s
okay. Often, over the next few weeks, they’ll cool down. Don’t threaten to
go to the boss; it’s implicit that you might, and making it explicit can moti-
vate them to go to the boss first. That could force you onto the defensive.
296
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

 Have one of your powerful allies intervene. Perhaps your wise old soul
or another respected employee can gently let the alliance know that top
management likes you, and that if they continue to mess with you, they —
not you — will suffer.
 Go to your boss, perhaps with your ally. Show your documentation of
your peacemaking efforts and, if necessary, evidence of your on-the-job
accomplishments.
 Decide that you can accept the status quo or go to your boss’s boss.
This rarely works, so you should also start looking for a new job.
Staying Current the Smart Way
Staying current keeps you competent and confident, and increases your
employability. But with the information explosion, staying current isn’t easy.
Before going back to school for a course, let alone a degree, see whether
these just-in-time learning approaches can help:
 The Hey Joe School. When you’re stuck, simply ask someone in your
office, or by phone, “Hey Joe, how do I . . . ?” This simple approach can
be powerful. Unlike in a class, where you’re amassed with information
with no real-world opportunity to apply it, at the Hey Joe School, you
learn what you need when you need it. Just-in-time learning.
Most organizations have experts at various things — for example, the
computer wizard or the nut who can recite all your company’s product
specifications in his sleep. Because they’re so good, they’re likely in
demand. If you expect them to return your e-mail within the decade, go
out of your way to help them when you can. And when they help you, a
thank-you note or little present doesn’t hurt.
 The tutor. For most people, the best way to learn something complicated,
such as a computer program, isn’t from a course, but a tutor. Who might
tutor you? A savvy co-worker in your office, a community college instruc-
tor interested in moonlighting, or someone who answers an ad you place
on an online discussion group or even on craigslist.org.
Set up your tutoring this way: Keep track of all your questions and use
them as the basis for the next tutoring session. Ask whether you can call
your tutor for help between sessions.
 The mentor. Find a respected person in your field and agree that you
can call her for counsel. Or create an online version: Form an e-mail
group with colleagues in which each member can post questions for the
group’s consideration. It’s easy to set one up. A great free service is at
groups.yahoo.com. An appropriate group may already be available —
check the groups tab on google.com.
297
Chapter 11: Making the Most of Any Job

 The article. Articles are wonderful — they offer condensed expertise on
virtually any topic at minimal cost and require minimal time. And thanks
to google.com or links from your professional association’s Web site,
finding on-target articles is easy and fast.
 The book. How terrific to have a large quantity of an expert’s best
thoughts, available 24/7 for the cost of a large pizza, or free from the
library. And you can search Amazon.com’s database of 3 million books
to find precisely the title you’re looking for, often including reviews by
readers and experts.
 The electronic discussion group. Of the hundreds of thousands of
groups, one is likely to provide you with an on-target education. That
may be the best way to stay up on current issues and trends. Find
groups at groups.yahoo.com or by searching on Google’s groups tab.
 The workshop. Professional associations and university extension pro-
grams offer workshops that focus on the basics or cutting-edge issues.
Ask your colleagues which workshops they find most useful.
 Certifications. In thousands of specializations, you can earn a respected
certification by taking a few courses or via self-study. Check local col-
leges and certificates.gradschools.com.
 How good an employee are you, really? I have counseled hundreds of
fired employees. Barely a handful said it was their fault. My sense is that
many of them had good self-esteem but in fact were weak employees.
Could you be one of them? A way to find out is a 360-degree evaluation:
asking people all around you (for example, boss, supervisee, peer, cus-
tomer, vendor), “As part of my professional development, I’d like some
feedback. What would you say are my strengths and weaknesses?”
Requesting a 360-degree evaluation is scary, but perhaps less scary
than a stalled career.
 The world’s fastest self-improvement strategy. On your refrigerator, desk,
or computer monitor frame, write, “I need to stop (insert something). I
need to start (insert something). I need to continue doing (insert some-
thing).” Every time you drink something, read those words aloud to keep
your goals front and center.
 Continual self-improvement . . . give me a break! A client of mine says
that he can experience ongoing improvement without being overwhelmed
by remembering a Japanese car company’s motto. Instead of, “How can I
improve?” he asks, “How can I be just a little bit better?”
Sometimes, I wonder, though, whether everyone deserves an even easier
approach — giving yourself a total break from self-improvement. Is there
not a point at which, at least for a while, you deserve to say, “I’m good
enough!”?

The Three-Minute MBA: The World’s
Shortest Management Course
Many employees hold their breath when those oh-so-confident MBAs march
in. Alas, those mathematical models, simulations, and case studies that
seemed so clever in graduate school rarely work as well in the real world.
MBA programs do teach some valid principles, but it’s easy to lose sight of
those needles in the haystack.
I attempt to remedy that here. All these principles are real-world proven. At
the risk of hubris exceeding that even of new MBAs, I believe that if you
follow just these principles, you will improve more as a manager and leader
than if you had that $100,000 sheepskin.
 Hire smart. The best managers hire wisely:
• Encourage your respected employees, colleagues, and friends to
refer truly outstanding candidates.
• Generally, value intelligence and drive over experience and degrees.
• Rather than asking standard interview questions such as “What is
your greatest weakness?” put candidates in simulations of situa-
tions they’re likely to face on the job.
• Instead of calling three references, who rarely criticize a candidate,
ask your finalist candidates for ten references. Call all ten at night,
when they won’t be at their desk. Leave voicemail messages
explaining that you’re hiring for an important position and want
the reference to call back only if the candidate is truly outstanding.
Unless you get at least seven callbacks, you probably should move
on to another candidate.
 Cut your losses. If, within one to three weeks, you get the sense that a
hire isn’t excellent, and attempts at remediation or clarifying your expec-
tations don’t quickly bear fruit, it’s usually wisest to let her go. She’s
unlikely to become excellent. Great managers spend their time on
higher-payoff tasks than the remediation of weak employees. Examples
of these tasks include developing strategy, acquiring resources, and sup-
porting strong supervisees to do their jobs better (see the next bullet).
 Inspire; don’t micromanage. Develop a truly worthy agenda for your
work group and, if possible, incorporate your supervisees’ input, which
inspires them to act on the agenda. That doesn’t just mean giving moti-
vational speeches. It means being a role model — you gotta walk that
talk. Also, be liberal with deserved praise, sending copies of attaboys
to higher-ups. Don’t micromanage. Do the opposite: Free up your
supervisees to do their job with a minimum of rules, policing, and
accountability paperwork.
299
Chapter 11: Making the Most of Any Job

 Communicate wonderfully. Most people think they communicate well but
don’t. You must be so clear that a junior high school student would under-
stand and appreciate what you say. You must be so concise that someone
with ADD would still be paying attention at the end of your utterance. You
must listen more carefully than you ever have before. When you must crit-
icize, do it in a way that allows the person to save face. For example, “I’ve
noticed (insert problem, stated very briefly). Do you think that’s a valid
concern? And if so, what you do think should be done?” (I discuss devel-
oping communication skills in detail earlier in this chapter.)
 Master meetings. Meetings cost a fortune. Even assuming no travel costs,
you have the participants’ salaries and benefits, and they have to stop
their work to attend. So, call meetings only when that cost is truly justified
(for example, when a problem requires instant group brainstorming).
Meetings in which people give non-urgent reports usually aren’t worth
the money. That should be done by e-mail.
When you have meetings, send a tight agenda to participants in
advance. Inviting only the few people likely to contribute the most not
only saves money, but also produces better results. You can always
e-mail the meetings’ results to others. At the meeting, if at all possible,
keep to the agenda and its time limits.
 Be absolutely ethical. Always. Ethics are crucial, not only because you
and your supervisees will feel better about their work, but also because
unethical leaders lead to the devolution of civilization. Everyone wants
to feel like they leave the world better, not worse. The test: Would you
be proud to tell your child what you’re doing?
Enjoying Success at Every Career Stage
A lot of career advice is just as applicable to someone starting out as it is to
someone starting to think about retirement. But some counsel is stage-specific,
as I explain in the following sections.
When you’re just starting out
In your first career years, of course, you’re probably still working on becom-
ing technically competent. But perhaps as important, don’t ignore the soft
stuff: communication skills, developing a powerful network, and entrepre-
neurial skills. This section shows you how to do all three.
Strengthen your one-on-one communication skills
You probably think you already have them, and you’re probably wrong. (See
the section “Developing wonderful communication skills,” earlier in this
chapter, for tips that you can use now.)
300
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

Network now
Developing useful contacts takes time. Networking probably won’t help you
land your first job, but it will help you later.
First, develop a few-second self-commercial. For example, “I’m having a good
time as an assistant manager on a small Wi-Fi project, but I think I’m ready for
something bigger.” Self-commercials are useful when you run into a boss in
the elevator, and during networking activities. Keep your self-commercial
ready to use when you
 Start an Insider’s Group. These groups are made up of people in your
line of work who communicate via a Yahoo! group (check out groups.
yahoo.com) and perhaps periodically in-person.
 Join your professional association. Volunteer for its program commit-
tee or even to serve as an officer. You’d be surprised how often organiza-
tions are searching for leaders.
 Attend gatherings. To maximize your networking opportunities, be on the
greeting committee. Or act like the host: Find out about people and offer
to get them a drink or food, or introduce them to someone else. Start con-
versations, perhaps about the host, the event, or something in the news.
Even if you take part in these activities, you probably won’t develop a useful
network unless you create deep connections with people. The key to success-
ful networking: deep connection. You must get your protagonist to discuss
his or her passion or problem. How do you do that? With probing questions.
Follow these steps when you meet someone new, and you’re well on your
way to networking successfully:
1. After introducing yourself and making an environment comment
(about the venue, food, speaker, weather, and so on), start with work.
For example, you may say, “What do you do at work?”
2. Listen carefully.
Often the answer reveals a passion or a hint of a problem. That hint may
be as subtle as a tone of voice dropping while your new contact
describes what he does.
3. If he reveals a passion or a hint of a problem, ask a follow-up question.
If you pick up on a potential problem, you may say, “Sounds like maybe
your work isn’t so thrilling.” Keep listening carefully.
4. When the person runs out of things to say on the subject, express
empathy before asking another question.
Asking another question too soon may make the other person feel inter-
rogated. Instead, try telling him about, for example, your employee from
hell. Then consider asking another question or two to better understand
his situation, and perhaps you can gently guide him to a solution.
301
Chapter 11: Making the Most of Any Job

5. If your initial question about work doesn’t suggest a passion or prob-
lem to discuss, move to a question about family.
Ask, for example, “Do you have a family?” Again, listen for a sign of a
passion or problem.
6. If that yields nothing, move to outside-of-work interests.
You may say, for example, “Outside of work, what do you spend a lot of
time on?” That can reveal such things as a home remodel project that
he loves or is a pain, or a health problem.
7. When you’re ready to end the chat but would like to continue the
relationship, say something like, “I’ve enjoyed our chat. Would you
like to continue the conversation sometime?”
People love to talk and too rarely are listened to carefully about what’s
important to them. As Fran Leibowitz says, only half joking, “There is no
listening. There’s just waiting for the other person to stop talking.” So, if you
listen actively to a person talking about his passion or problem, you increase
the chances of him wanting to befriend you or help you. And at minimum,
you’ll have had a more rewarding experience than if your conversation
focused on the weather. Chapter 8 has more information about networking.
Develop entrepreneurial skills
School rarely teaches entrepreneurship, but it’s key in many middle- and
upper-level positions in both the non- and for-profit sectors, and even in
some areas of government. And of course, entrepreneurial skills prepare you
for self-employment.
Of course, you can learn in an MBA program, but before spending the big
bucks and big time, try learning at the elbow of a good entrepreneur, even if
you’re just filing and making coffee. As long as you watch carefully and ask
questions, you should pick up some good lessons. Or use the services of the
Small Business Administration (www.sba.gov), which offers courses in
entrepreneurship and one-on-one free coaching from retired executives.
When you’re mid-career
Mid-career is when most people start to top out or burn out. Want to avoid
both? Follow these tips:
 Plot out your career arc. Perhaps rethink what you want to be. Set goals
and sub-goals. Say you’re an optometrist and think you’ll be bored if you
spend the rest of your life asking, “Better with lens A or lens B?” So your
goal may be to teach part time at the local optometry school. Your sub-
goals might be to read a book on the art of teaching and then to teach a
workshop at the next optometry association meeting.
302
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

 If you want to continue moving up, continue to grow your skill set.
Leaders read leadership-oriented magazines when exercising on the
treadmill, find role models and mentors, and engage career coaches to
help them navigate choppy waters. Areas of particular importance as
you move up:
• Strategic thinking, incorporating large amounts of data, but ulti-
mately relying on good intuition.
• The ability to inspire employees to work hard and smart, both in
their own and in the organization’s interest.
• Delegation. Take the time to train people to handle delegated tasks
or find people to whom you can more confidently delegate.
• Running a meeting in an efficient yet inspirational way.
• Public speaking. Key is the art of storytelling. Consider taking a
storytelling workshop or joining Toastmasters, a club with chap-
ters all over the world in which members give talks to each other
to improve their public speaking and to make connections.
• Conversance with all aspects of a business. The technology,
finance, sales, marketing, and so on.
 Derive more meaning from your work. Most people want to do this,
but they don’t know how. Many people think the only answer is a career
change into a “make-a-difference” career. Especially after age 30, however,
this change can be difficult to do while meeting your expenses. Easier is to
ask yourself, “How can I make more of a difference in my current job? Do
I want to mentor a younger employee? Learn a new skill? Speak my truth
about a political issue? Take a leadership role in an employee fundraising
effort? Speak out against unethical practices in my workplace? Volunteer
for a charity that could really use my help?”
When you’re in your final years on the job
Ever wonder whether you’re considered deadwood? I’d feel terrible if my 
co-workers thought so, even if my job was secure. And these days, ever fewer
jobs are.
The more yeses, the more likely you’re considered deadwood:
 Compared with years past, you’re working on less important projects.
 You’ve been reassigned to a less powerful boss.
 Your co-workers rarely seek your professional advice.
 Your peers’ raises are larger than yours.
303
Chapter 11: Making the Most of Any Job

 You’re not current on best practices or technology.
 You deride those who work harder than you.
 You’re eagerly awaiting retirement.
Especially if you think you may be perceived as over-the-hill, and even if
you’re not, the following sections present strategies if you’re in the late
stages of your career.
Learn something new
Acquiring a new skill or knowledge is energizing and demonstrates to your
boss that you’re not just going through the motions until retirement.
When you’re ready to learn something new, choose something that you feel
you can enjoy learning, is valued by your employer, and would be visible to
your boss and others. For example, if your company is planning to upgrade
its project management software, you might check out the various packages
and recommend one to your boss. If you can’t learn something by reading on
your own, the process is often much easier with a tutor than a course. (See
the earlier section “Staying Current the Smart Way” for full details.)
Brand yourself as a wise elder
You may no longer work 14 hours a day or know Version 8.0 cold, but your
many years in the workplace may enable you to prevent and solve problems
that even the most eager newbie can’t. So, rather than compete with the
young fire-breathing dragons, establish yourself as a Wise Elder. Here’s how:
 With young upstarts or others who may welcome counsel or mentor-
ship, say things like, “I notice you’re working on a challenging project.
I’ve had some experience with that sort of thing, so if you have a ques-
tion or simply want to kick it around a bit, I’d be pleased to do that.”
 Help people, especially young ones, to network — introduce them to the
power people and others who can abet their careers.
 In your memos, reports, and proposals, mention any relevant lessons
you’ve learned from past experience.
 In meetings, say things like, “I faced a similar problem awhile back. We
tried an approach similar to what’s being contemplated here, but it
didn’t work. Finally, we tried X and it worked well. I’m wondering
whether we should consider trying that here. What do you think?”
Angle for jobs in which age is a plus
In certain jobs, age is a plus. For example, you may be the ideal candidate to
become a rainmaker (someone who brings in lucrative clients), internal or

external consultant, or to work on a product aimed at older customers.
Sometimes, to get the okay, all you need to do is make the case to your boss.
Consider changing careers
Even if you don’t have much fire in your belly and you’re no longer the
sharpest tool in the shed, you’re not doomed to staying in that same old job
you’re tired of. Consider senior-friendly workplaces. For example: traditional
industries such as banking, transportation, food and wine, nonprofits serving
the aged, senior housing, teaching, architecture (mainly older people are in a
position to hire architects), the government (which makes great efforts to
hire people of all ages), fundraising (big donors are generally older and prefer
dealing with their age peers).
Also consider self-employment. Want to use your lifetime of experience as
a consultant? Run an espresso cart (with a name like “Grandma’s Grind”)
in a carefully selected location? Or consider one of the few ways to earn
while you sleep — affiliate marketing on the Internet (check out www.
superaffiliatehandbook.com).
Mind your personal appearance
Most people look at least acceptable when they’re young, but with time’s rav-
ages, it becomes increasingly important that you make the most of what you
have left:
 Have good posture. Sit and stand up straight, and walk with a bounce in
your step. I know, sometimes you don’t feel like bouncing. Bounce anyway.
 Get enough sleep. It’s easier to bounce when you get seven or eight
hours of sleep. Also, you’ll look younger — everyone looks older when
sleep-deprived. Even if you have to do it in your car, consider taking a
half-hour nap in the afternoon. Nothing makes you look more like dead-
wood than appearing fatigued.
 Use caffeine judiciously. Mainstream medical research has come to con-
sensus that one to three cups of coffee a day isn’t harmful and may even
be helpful. Caffeine certainly increases energy and cognitive function.
But people do build tolerance to caffeine, so drink as little as you need
to maintain your energy.
 Stride; don’t trudge. Plod down the hall and you look like deadwood.
 Avoid a hang-dog face. Smile as much as possible. Bonus: Your smile
distracts people from the part of your face that most reveals your age:
your eyes.
 Wear glasses. Speaking of your eyes, glasses cover a multitude of sins:
red eyes, glassy eyes, raccoon eyes, and crow’s feet. Don’t need glasses
to improve your eyesight? Get a pair with plain glass lenses.

Chapter 11: Making the Most of Any Job

 Dress well. No need to look like a 30-year-old, but dress smartly and
neatly. Wearing an old, tight-fitting, brown suit is like wearing a sign that
says, “I’m deadwood.” Clothing tips:
• Think three times before buying clothes meant for 20-somethings.
The contrast between your clothes and your age will accentuate
the very thing you’re trying to distract from.
• Soft colors make most people look younger.
• Choose clothes that hide your bad features. For example, if you
have flabby arms, wear 3⁄4 sleeves in the summer.
• Be sure your clothes are pressed. The rumpled look doesn’t work,
even if you’re a professor. There’s no faster way to look burned out.
 Groom your hair. For most women, a medium-length cut works best.
Older guys, keep your hair relatively short. Both men and women can
consider coloring their hair; your original color usually looks best. Guys,
that beard may have looked cool when you were younger, but now, it
probably just makes you look older.
 Whiten your teeth. Get your teeth whitened or do it yourself. It costs
little and makes a difference.
Examine your finances carefully
If you’re eager to retire, see whether you can cut your expenses and afford to
retire earlier. The following tips may help:
 Estimate how much money you’ll need for retirement and how much
more money you’d have if you waited a year or five. The Retirement
Center at vanguard.com offers useful tools. (Click on “personal invest-
ing,” then “planning and education,” then “retirement planning.”)
 Consider selling your house and moving to smaller digs or a place in a
less expensive location. I was amazed to discover that a home that, on
either coast, would cost a half million dollars, could be had in the fast-
growing university town of Austin, Texas, for $150,000.
 You can safely cut costs on your kids’ and grandkids’ college education.
There’s no compelling evidence that attending a low-cost college will
impede success and happiness. I have a PhD from Berkeley in the evalu-
ation of education and have written three books on higher education,
and I truly believe there is no need to shell out the big bucks. At mini-
mum, insist your child help pay the way.
 Reconsider all big purchases. For example, would you really get that
much more pleasure from a $2,000 plasma TV than from the TV you
already have? From that flying vacation staying at deluxe hotels than
from a driving vacation staying at moderate motels? Do you really need
more clothes, jewelry, or a new car?
306
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

Create an exciting vision for your retirement
When you devise cool plans for your retirement, you have something great to
look forward to instead of just dreading your current existence. For example,
might you want to tutor illiterate adults? Write that novel? Create the ultimate
garden? Learn how to play the piano? Get involved in a community political
issue? Serve on your local school board? Become the world’s best grand-
parent? Get involved in your local community theater? Renew the relationship
with your spouse or child? All of the above?
Dream away, but don’t assume that retirement will necessarily be preferable
to working. A few months after retirement, many people wish they were back
at work. Too often, after the first few months of retirement, you run out of
things to do. If you’re contemplating retirement, vacation for a few weeks and
ask yourself how you’d like 10 or 20 years of that. Will you soon feel irrelevant,
out to pasture? Lay out a plan for how you’ll fill the next five years. Will you
really fill the time with volunteer work, golf, reading, gardening, and friends?
Or will that get old? When in doubt, cut back rather than retire.
Also, retirement apparently isn’t good for your health — the average person
lives only two years after retirement. I plan to work until I drop, while still
trying to squeeze in the enjoyable things that many people save for retire-
ment. For example, I had never been in a play before. So, after a few acting
lessons and two unsuccessful auditions, I was cast in a community theater
production of Agatha Christie’s Ten Little Indians and had a ball! I urge you
not to wait until retirement to do the things you want to do.
I hope I have many productive years left, but you never know. So, I figure I
better use my time wisely before I lose it. I tell myself to take on only clients I
truly believe in, and to share with my readers, clients, and listeners as many
new and valuable ideas as I can come up with. The old saw, “No one ever died
wishing they spent more time at the office,” doesn’t apply to me. I’d prefer to
croak while working.
Assessing Your Chances 
of Getting Ahead
Up isn’t the only way. In fact, many higher-ups wonder whether the extra salary
is worth the extra headaches. But for many people, getting ahead is a way to
make a career cooler. How likely are you to get ahead? After you’ve been in
your new career for a few months, hopefully having followed the principles in
this chapter, try this self-test. Or take it now to give you goals to shoot for.
Many of these items are from a Fortune magazine inventory.

Chapter 11: Making the Most of Any Job

Score yourself on each question, then just add them up to get your total
score:
___________
1. Compare your work with that of your peers. If you think you add more
value, give yourself 1–3 points. If you’re less productive, take away 1–3
points.
Can’t figure out how valuable you are? Think about, or even ask, your
peers, suppliers, or customers how much they value what you do.
___________
2. Do you play a leadership role in tasks and projects central to the organi-
zation’s success? If so, give yourself 1–3 points.
___________
3. Do you perform a worker-bee task that is so crucial to the organization
that they can’t afford to promote you from there? If so, subtract 3–5
points.
___________
4. If at least one of your suggestions for improving the organization has
been adopted and you got credit, give yourself 1–3 points.
___________
5. If your organization or department is ripe for downsizing, subtract
1–3 points.
How do you know? Here are some clues:
• Your department’s product stacks up poorly against others in the
organization or among your competitors.
• Morale is low and office politics are high.
• You’re involved in cutting costs rather than building market share
or creating new products.
___________
6. Are you known for your enthusiasm? Give yourself from minus 3 to plus
3 points.
___________
7. Do you have long-term career goals and specific strategies to achieve
them? If so, give yourself 1–3 points.
___________
8. If you’ve already received a promotion, give yourself 4 points.
___________
9. Are you pampered? For example, if you still need an administrative
assistant to do your word processing and spreadsheets, you look like a
dinosaur and a high-maintenance one at that. Subtract 2 points.
___________ 10. Do co-workers and bosses frequently seek your counsel? Give yourself
1–3 points.
___________ 11. If your co-workers and bosses were polled, would all or almost all of
them say that they like you? Give yourself 3 points.
308

___________ 12. Have you cultivated important allies in and outside your department? If
so, give yourself 1–3 points.
___________ 13. Do you regularly ask friends and colleagues for feedback on how you’re
doing? If so, give yourself 1 point. If you’ve then improved, give yourself
2 more points.
___________ 14. Are you actively upgrading your skills in areas valued by employers? If
so, give yourself 1–2 points.
___________ 15. Do you build your reputation by writing articles, speaking at industry
events, or being active in your professional association? If so, give your-
self 1–3 points.
___________ 16. If you lost your job today, could you tap a network of people for advice
and job leads? If so, give yourself 1–4 points.
___________ 17. Do you have portable skills such as technical or management know-
how? If so, give yourself 1–3 points.
___________ 18. Listen to your boss during a performance review. If she talks to you about
your role in the organization’s big picture, give yourself 1–3 points.
___________ 19. Is your boss’s star rising or in a death spiral? Give yourself between plus
2 and minus 2 points.
___________ 20. Do you dress like someone in the position to which you aspire? Give
yourself between minus 2 and plus 2 points.
___________ 21. If you were the boss, would you hire you? If yes, give yourself 3 points.
If no, subtract 3 points.
___________ 22. If you were the boss, would you promote you? If yes, give yourself
5 points.
Scoring:
10 or fewer: You may be downsizing material. Is this a wake-up call to start
working on some of the items on this list? Would you be more motivated to
do so in a different job? In a different career?

Think twice before aspiring to management
In the past, it made sense to want to go from
worker bee to manager, because it meant more
money, more prestige, and a launchpad to even
more prestigious job titles. Things have changed.
The hierarchy is flatter, so fewer opportunities for
promotion exist. Senior management demands
ever-more productivity, and at the same time,
new laws make firing incompetents tougher. In
the book Gig, Chad Finlay, a video game designer
turned manager, said, “When I first got into
games, you’re making stuff and you get to read
cool reviews about it. . . . Now I’m walking
around, ‘How’s this going? Are you getting this
done? I need this by Friday.’ It got old.”
When you’re promoted to manager, your cama-
raderie with your former peers tends to decline.
Your credibility with your former peers also is
likely to slide because staying current is hard
when you’re a manager. For example, few pro-
grammers have the time to keep up with the
latest programming languages when their full-
time job is to manage other programmers.
Even more dangerous, management requires
different skills than those required of worker
bees. The Peter Principle often raises its ugly
head — the great classroom teacher may not
be a great principal.
And don’t forget about money. Managers usu-
ally work longer hours than worker bees and,
because managers don’t get paid for overtime,
they often earn less per hour than the people
they supervise! With a 40 percent to 60 percent
marginal tax rate, the after-tax benefit of a pro-
motion to management probably won’t improve
your lifestyle.
The final kibosh: At a time when most people
wish they had more spare time, managers work
long hours.
An often smarter move than aspiring to man-
agement: a lateral move to one of the company’s
cool areas.

L
et’s come back to this chapter later. (Just kidding.)
But you can get into this gradually. I start with some surprising truths about
procrastination.
Most independently wealthy people continue to work. For example, Fortune-
500 CEOs stay in their jobs even after they have more money than they could
spend in five lifetimes. You say, “That’s not surprising — they have a cool
career.” Well, consider this: 100 workers at a cheese factory bought a lottery
ticket and ended up winning the largest prize in the history of the Wisconsin
lottery — $208 million. They were cheese cutters, packers, and maintenance
workers, and many of them worked the night shift, not widely considered
cool careers. Yet many of them came to work the very next night (Sunday)
and plan to continue working indefinitely.
Many people find that work is key to feeling they have value. I’ve had many
clients who complained of depression, and when they found a good job, that
depression subsided. I call work Prozac without side effects.
Yet a surprising number of my unemployed clients admit to doing everything
possible to avoid work: They procrastinate in their job search, and when
they’re on a job, they spend as much time as possible chatting, playing on
the Net, and so on.

No surprise, procrastination devastates one’s career. When I give a speech to
successful executives, I often ask, “How many of you think of yourself as a
procrastinator?” Only 15 percent raise their hand. Yet when I ask the same
question of groups of unemployed people, about 85 percent do.
Procrastination is a career killer. In this chapter, I show you how to turn the
tables and defeat procrastination.
In the Beginning: How People Develop
a Habit of Procrastination
Psychotherapists offer a variety of explanations for why people procrasti-
nate: fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of success, and so on. With many of
my clients, procrastination is simply a bad habit caused by their
teachers. See whether this sounds like you:
At some point in school, for the first time, you waited until the last
minute to get started on a paper or studying for a test. Pumped by
adrenaline, you managed to get it done. And lo and behold, you got a
decent grade.
You promised not to procrastinate again — the experience was too
stressful — just as the person who gets drunk for the first time gets a hor-
rible hangover and swears, “I won’t do that again.”
But unconsciously, a little voice within you said, “Hmm, that was kind of
cool: I got to avoid that big ugly project until the last minute, and then the
adrenaline of the deadline pumped me up — kind of a fun drug — and I
did okay!”
From then on, when an unpleasant assignment came along, you won-
dered whether you could get away with cramming. And at some point,
when an assignment felt especially odious or your friends invited you to
par-tay, you figured, “Well, okay, I’ll take the risk. It worked before; maybe
it will work again.” So, you delayed the task until the adrenaline rush of
the fast-approaching deadline kicked in, and miracle of miracles, again,
another decent grade!
Slowly, like the budding alcoholic or drug addict who comes up with
ever-more flimsy reasons to get drunk or high, you, the nascent procrasti-
nator, came up with ever-feebler rationalizations for getting your adrena-
line fix: “There’s this great TV show on” or “I’ll be more in the mood
tomorrow.” And thanks to rampant grade inflation (almost 40 percent of
college students had an A average in high school, double the rate of just
20 years ago), a reasonably bright student can get good grades with 
312
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

last-minute work. By the time you finished school, you became a full-
blown adrenaline junkie: Procrastination had become your normal
response to an assignment.
Alas, in the real world, you won’t find as much grade inflation. To succeed in
all but low-level careers, many employers insist that to get a mere passing
grade, projects be completed to high standards. Unless you’re exceptionally
bright, that last-minute crap doesn’t cut it. You’ll probably be the one who
gets downsized, offshored, outsourced, or automated. And, of course, if
you’re self-employed, procrastination will likely kill your business because
you have no one to pick up the slack if you, well, slack.
Most people are fully aware that procrastination hurts them. They know it’s
like a credit card: fun when you use it, but painful when the bill comes in.
Nevertheless, they admit that they’re unlikely to change. They accept their
procrastination as an immutable weakness, much as a blind person accepts
his handicap. If you’re convinced that you won’t change no matter how many
strategies for overcoming procrastination I offer you, this chapter still has
something for you: ways to increase your chances of success assuming
you’re an incorrigible procrastinator; see the later section “Advice for the
Incurable Procrastinator.” If, however, you want to improve upon your ten-
dency to procrastinate, I can help you. Keep reading.
The World’s Shortest Course in
Overcoming Procrastination
If you’re fed up with the way procrastination is hurting your work and per-
sonal life and you’re ready to stop, this chapter contains dozens of ways to
help you. You won’t need them all. Think of this chapter as a smorgasbord of
procrasti-cures. Try one. Doesn’t do the trick? Try something else.
313
Chapter 12: Light My Fire, Please! Overcoming Procrastination
How your humble author controls 
his procrastination
I try to stay in the moment. I don’t think about
what fun thing I could be doing instead, or how
much work is ahead of me. I try to stay focused
on whatever my next few-second task is. When
I feel a compelling urge to play instead of work,
I usually indulge it — guilt-free. For example, I
take a few minutes to play on the Net or walk
around the block and smell the roses (literally),
but I try to keep my breaks short so that I have
plenty of time to accomplish my work.

314
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 
Prefer not to bother reviewing dozens of options? Try this plan. It amalga-
mates the strategies that have worked best for the largest number of my
clients. To start:
1. Decide whether you really want to do the task. Maybe its benefits
aren’t worth the effort. If you decide you want to do the task, do you
want to do it now or schedule it? Consciously choosing makes it more
likely that you’ll actually complete the tasks you decide to do.
2. Picture the benefits. If you decide to do the task, picture the benefits of
getting it done: a benefit could be as small as an attaboy from your boss
or spouse or simply the pleasure of getting the task done and off your to-
do list. Or the benefit could be much bigger — bringing you a step closer
to being able to buy a home, for example.
3. Build in reminders. Procrastinators tend to repress thoughts of doing
the dreaded task. To make sure you don’t forget, write an alphabet letter
on your hand, set a timer to go off when you should be starting the task,
or simply schedule the darn thing on your calendar.
Tell people your goal and deadline. For example, you can say, “I have an
important report due on Friday.” Often, that can motivate you; when they
later ask you whether you got it done, you won’t have to say no or lie.
Find someone to compete with. Suppose you’re both looking for a job.
Make a bet: The person who lands an in-person interview first wins, for
example, a dinner at a favorite restaurant.
4. Identify the moment of truth. This is the moment you’re consciously or
unconsciously deciding whether to work on the dreaded task or not.
Perhaps the moment is at the beginning, or maybe it’s when you reach a
hard part of the task. At that moment, say aloud, “Stop!” Literally pinch
yourself for sliding back into your wicked ways, and muster the energy
and discipline to get started or keep moving. That’s the moment of truth,
the moment where you have to believe that “Right now, it’s in my inter-
est to be productive rather than to have fun.” Get through it and you’ll
find it easier to continue. If that doesn’t work, proceed to Step 5.
5. Ask yourself, “What’s making me reluctant to do the task?” Your
response, for example, may be “It’s going to be hard,” “I’d rather do
something fun,” or “I don’t know where to start.”
6. What would your wise twin say in response? For example:
• If you’re afraid the task will be hard, your wise twin may say, “You
can divide it into small bites and get help when you need it.”
• Don’t know how to break it up into little steps? Your wise twin may
say, “Who could help you do that?”

• If you’re procrastinating looking for a job because you believe
you’re not qualified, your wise twin may ask you, “Is that true? If
so, get training or change careers.” If you are reasonably but not
perfectly qualified, your wise twin may say, “You’ll get even better
as you work on the job. But you won’t have a chance to get better
unless you make those phone calls.”
• If you’re tempted to do something fun instead of the task, your
wise twin may ask you, “Is the short-term relief worth the long-
term consequences? Your call.”
7. Struggle for no more than one minute. Sitting stuck is the most painful
part of a task. The fear of staying stuck makes many people procrasti-
nate the entire task. My clients have found the one-minute struggle to be
an invaluable rule. When you reach a hard part, struggle for no longer
than 60 seconds. If, at that point, you haven’t made progress, you’re
unlikely to make progress even if you sit there for an hour. So, at the 
one-minute mark, stop and get help or decide that you can do the task
without that hard part.
8. Commit to a small amount of effort (for example, three phone calls).
Work at being efficient during that small amount of effort. Frequently ask
yourself, “Is this the straightest line to getting the task done?” Perhaps
give yourself a reward for getting it done; an example is working all the
way through a commercial break, and then letting yourself watch the next
segment. Achieving even a small success will motivate you to do more.
9. Look back and ask yourself whether it was worth the effort to get
the task done. That can make you less likely to procrastinate on the
next task.
10. Block out some time for pure, unadulterated, guilt-free fun.
Cured? If not, read on.
Cures for Every Imaginable Excuse
Some procrastinators can be helped by a cure tailored to their particular
excuse for procrastinating. The following cures for making excuses apply
both to job seekers and to those who have already found cool careers.
The fear-of-failure excuse
In other words: “I’m afraid of failing.” Sometimes, fear is a sign you shouldn’t
tackle a task. But if you think doing the task is probably in your best interest
but you’re too scared to try, one or more of the following tactics may help.
315
Chapter 12: Light My Fire, Please! Overcoming Procrastination

Feel the fear and do it anyway
If, rationally, you believe that the potential rewards of doing the task justify
the risk, do as author Susan Jeffers says, “Feel the fear and do it anyway.”
Sure, if the cost of failure is huge, don’t risk it. For example, if you’ve been
doing mediocre work and your organization is in financial trouble, you 
probably shouldn’t ask for a raise — that could get you fired. But if the
risk/reward ratio is good, feel the fear and do it anyway.
Not trying usually means greater failure
If you don’t try, you’re a guaranteed failure. If you give it a shot, you have at
least some chance of succeeding, and at minimum, you’ll learn from your fail-
ure. You’ll also gain self-respect and the esteem of others. People who try and
fail are respected more than people who don’t try at all.
Think less and do more
As a child, I’d lie awake worrying about dying. As a young adult, I interpreted
every twinge as a sign of an impending heart attack. Doctors tried to reassure
me that nothing was wrong, while therapists tried to find the cause of my
hypochondria. But nothing worked. I was a worrywart. But at age 30, I sud-
denly stopped worrying. Who cured me? My wife. “Martin,” she ordered, “the
more you think about your health, the more in knots you are. From now on,
every time you get a hypochondriacal thought, force yourself to think of
something else.” Within two weeks, I was cured. That was years ago. Of
course, now I worry about little green men from Mars coming to destroy the
earth. Just kidding.
Why did I tell you that story? Because too often, people procrastinate by
thinking a problem to death — analysis paralysis. This, of course, usually
leads to a worse result than if they had tried something, even if it ended up
not working.
If you stay at the source of a river until you figure out the precise route to its
mouth, you’ll never arrive there. Most successful people do minimum plan-
ning, try something, and then revise, revise, and revise again. Start down the
river and then make midcourse corrections.
Avoiding analysis paralysis is particularly important for career searchers.
Rarely can you make progress just sitting there and thinking. Read some-
thing, write something, phone someone, or visit someone.
I’ve found analysis paralysis to be a particular problem with clients who have
had psychotherapy that focuses on the childhood roots of their problems.
Many of these people appear more paralyzed as a result. They seem stuck in
the past, more interested in talking yet again about what their parents or sib-
lings did to them decades ago than in doing something to get unstuck.
316
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

Stop your downward spiral
Fear is usually better and worse at different times. Often, what makes things
worse is momentum: One unproductive thought triggers another, which trig-
gers another, and before you know it, you’re overwhelmed.
The key is to stop unproductive thinking before it builds momentum — stop-
ping a rock that’s just starting to roll down a hill is easy, but if it gains speed,
it can knock you over. So, as soon as you recognize an unproductive thought,
just say Stop! to yourself and do something productive. That sounds simplis-
tic, but it often works.
Each time you complete a small part of a task, you’re starting the spiral
upward.
Don’t wait until you feel more confident
It works the other way around. The more you do, even if it isn’t very success-
ful, the better you’ll feel. The less you do, the worse you’ll feel.
Try affirmations
I used to make fun of affirmations. So did a weekly segment on Saturday Night
Live that featured the affirmation: “I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and
doggone it, people like me!”
But fact is, I’ve seen affirmations work with a number of clients. My hypoth-
esis: Just as repeated negative self-talk likely creates hard-wired physiological
changes in the brain, those thoughts can be rewired by consistent positive
self-talk. So, what’s an affirmation you’d like to say aloud ten times, three
times a day for at least a week?
The live-for-today excuse
An example of this excuse is “Searching for a job is yucky, no fun at all. I
always find something I’d rather do.” Try the following cures if you often use
this excuse:
 Remember that you’ll actually have more fun if you don’t procrasti-
nate. When you procrastinate, you suffer from the following:
• Ongoing guilt: Even when you’re watching your favorite TV show, a
little voice whispers in your ear, “You should be working.”
• Staying in the same miserable situation that made you want to find
a cool career in the first place: the low pay, the lousy work, your
lack of success.
• Enduring your family’s searing questions: “When are you going to
find yourself, Melvin?”
317
Chapter 12: Light My Fire, Please! Overcoming Procrastination

If you truly like pleasure more than pain, the key is to get your work
done as efficiently as possible so that maximum time is left for pleasure
without guilt or negative consequences to spoil the fun.
 Make the task as pleasurable as possible. When you’re doing the task,
keep asking yourself, “What’s the fun way to do this?” If, for example,
you know you need to cold-call prospective employers, ask yourself,
“How can I make these phone calls fun?” That can simply be a matter of
not taking it too seriously if a hirer blows you off: “The heck with him.
There are plenty of others I can call.”
 Beware of focusing only on the fun parts or of creating fun side activi-
ties that you rationalize are important to completing the task. For
example, many job seekers spend hours playing with their resume’s
format or researching companies on the Net, rather than contacting
potential employers. Solution: While you’re working, keep asking your-
self, “Is this the most direct path to my goal, or am I fooling myself?”
 Make a deal with yourself. For example: “Okay. I’ve decided that doing
this stinkin’ task is in my best interest, but I want a reward. So, here’s the
deal: If I work on it for 15 focused minutes, I’ll take a few minutes to
answer that e-mail from my girlfriend.”
 Accept that you have an addiction. Like drug addicts, live-for-today pro-
crastinators accept a damaged life in exchange for the momentary relief
of deferring work. Are you finally willing to say: “That’s it. I’m ready to
kick my addiction. I’m ready to be disciplined; I’ll be happier if, during
the workday at least, I make myself value productivity more than fun”?
A client of mine, Dave, in his early years, was a procrastinating
nonachiever. One day he simply decided he’d had enough. Today Dave is
a successful fundraiser, having won a number of achievement awards,
and is a happy guy.
The spacey procrastinator’s excuse
Here’s an example of this excuse: “I just can’t seem to focus.” Spacey people
often have big ideas but can’t stay focused long enough to accomplish even
little things. These folks can benefit from the following cures:
 Becoming more time-aware. Many spacey people are oblivious to time.
Set a timer to go off every three minutes. Each time it buzzes, ask
yourself, “Is this the most direct approach to achieving my goal?”
 Being alert to early signs of spacing out. When you feel yourself starting
to fade out, say aloud, “Okay, focus!”
318
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

 Picking a productivity place and time. Can you think of a place you’re
least likely to procrastinate? A time? Use that place and time when you
have an important task you’re likely to procrastinate.
 Taking a drug for ADD. If you have a long-standing inability to focus,
even on important things, a trial course on a drug such as Ritalin may be
worth considering. Originally used with children, these drugs have more
recently been found to help some adults. Of course, before taking any
prescription drug, discuss it thoroughly with your physician.
The perfectionist’s excuse #1
The first variation of the perfectionist’s excuse is “It takes me a long time, but I
want to get it right.” What to do? Know when good enough is good enough and
when you need to be perfect. It usually takes a long time to get from good to
perfect, so you want to spend that time only when it’s worth it — for example,
in crafting a good answer to “Why have you been unemployed for the last nine
years?” In nearly every other task in a job search and in most tasks in work
and life, shooting for perfection is time that you can spend more valuably.
I’ve seen many clients waste weeks agonizing over the fine points of their
resumes, the design of their business cards, or their cold-call script. Their job
prospects would be better if, instead, they started contacting employers. One
reason people are perfectionists about things like their resume is that fid-
dling with inanimate things is more comfortable than risking embarrassing
yourself. Be aware of that tendency. Ask yourself, “Is this the most direct
route to achieving my goal?”
The perfectionist’s excuse #2
Related to the previous excuse is “I’d rather not do it than do it poorly.” That
high-minded talk can be fear talking. Such people are afraid that if they make
a mistake, others will think they’re stupid.
Fact is, most successful people don’t let fear of mistakes stop them. They
dive in, make errors (sometimes appearing stupid), and learn from them.
Unsuccessful people are much more likely to plan, plan, plan, hoping to
achieve perfection and giving up before implementing much of their plan. Or
if a project has to be done, they find themselves at the eleventh hour, forced
to crank out something far worse than what they would have produced if
they hadn’t procrastinated. Sometimes a procrastinator’s motive is to protect
his ego: “I could have done it well if I had taken the time.” For that cold com-
fort, they pay a huge price. Sure, surgeons and diamond cutters must be per-
fect, but almost everyone else, especially job searchers, needn’t be.
319
Chapter 12: Light My Fire, Please! Overcoming Procrastination

Another difference between winners and losers lies in how they react to fail-
ing. Winners don’t waste time on self-pity. They focus on learning from their
failure so they can succeed the next time.
The fear-of-imposing excuse
This type of excuse is “I don’t want to contact them because I don’t want to
impose.” The cures:
 Recognize that you may not be imposing. Many people enjoy giving
advice. Plus, if you’re phoning for a job and the employer happens to
need someone like you, you’re doing him a favor. If not, you waste ten
seconds of his time. Big deal. You’ve stopped people on the street asking
for directions, right? Asking whether an employer is willing to talk with
you requires no more time.
 Clue in to the karma concept. Even if you are imposing, recognize that
asking for help is okay as long as you remember to be kind to people
who ask you for help.
The fear-of-success excuse
An example of this excuse is “I’m not sure I want to succeed. If I do, I’ll pay a
price.” Try these cures to beat this excuse:
 Remember that you can set limits. Accepting more pressure than you
want is unnecessary. For example, many successful executives have
decided that the stressful 70-hour weeks aren’t worth it no matter how
high the salary, so they quit to do something low-key like teaching col-
lege. Others are strongly committed to family, and they usually, with
persistence, find a family-friendly job that allows them to preserve
most of their evenings and weekends.

Advice from Tiger Woods
Golf requires an extraordinary degree of perfec-
tion. Mis-hit a ball by a tenth of an inch and it can
end up in the woods. Tiger Woods is arguably
the most perfect golfer in history, and even he
doesn’t strive for perfection. He aims for what he
calls “professional excellence,” a competent
effort on every shot. If it’s good enough for Tiger,
it’s good enough for everyone else.

 Be aware of the martyrdom tendency. Some people avoid succeeding
because they’re afraid their spouse or parent will feel inferior in compar-
ison. You shouldn’t sacrifice yourself to protect someone’s ego.
The adrenaline addict’s excuse
Here’s an example: “School got me into the habit of waiting until the last
minute to do assignments. I was able to get good grades even though I didn’t
start working until the night before.”
As I mention in the earlier section “In the Beginning: How People Develop a
Habit of Procrastination,” alas, except in dead-end jobs, last-minute work usu-
ally doesn’t cut it in the real world. Fine, blame the schools, but now you
have to cure your adrenaline addiction.
Realize that adrenaline addiction is dangerous. It’s bad for your health and
leeches pleasure out of every task.
If you’re not ready to kick your addiction to adrenaline, try these palliatives:
 Create an artificial deadline. For example, say, “I’m going to create a
networking list by 9:00.” Set a timer.
 Give yourself an absurdly short deadline. For example, say, “It’s 11 a.m.
and I want to have lunch at noon. Let’s see if I can write a draft of my
resume by then.”
A client of mine who supervises a cancer clinic was overwhelmed by the task
of creating his annual budget. I told him: “You have three minutes. Draft a
budget.” The absurd time limit forced him to focus only on its key compo-
nents and to identify the fuzzy areas. Three minutes later, he had written a
ton about the budget and was eager to fill in the blanks.
The high-potency version of this cure: Hand a friend a $100 check. If you
don’t finish the work by the agreed-on time, he cashes it.
The resent-authority excuse
Heard this one? “You’re not going to make me do that.” You’re right. Neither
family nor societal pressure can make you do anything, but recognize that if
you make the choice not to succeed, you, not the authority, will suffer.
321
Chapter 12: Light My Fire, Please! Overcoming Procrastination

The don’t-have-time excuse
Does this sound familiar? “I can’t get started on my career search until I clean
my desk (or get my divorce finalized, quit my job, whatever).” The cures:
 Realize that these are delaying tactics. Yes, they’re also legitimate prob-
lems, but millions of people with piled-high desks, who do full-time jobs,
and yes, are even in the throes of divorce, have found new careers or
done great things on the job. Often, the search for a better career actu-
ally provides rays of hope and distraction from the stress of a breakup. If
you wait until all the stars are aligned, you’ll never get started.
 Admit that a career- or job-search does take time. Starting now, as you
contemplate beginning an activity (including turning on the TV), ask
yourself, “Should I be working on my job search?” Pull out your appoint-
ment book or PDA and schedule blocks of time to devote to your search.
All-Purpose Procrastination Cures
The excuse-specific cures in the previous section often help procrastinators,
but some general cures can also be of real benefit. Pick out a few of the fol-
lowing cures that may work for you.
Doing your work without becoming stuck
The following cures can prevent you from getting stuck on a task:
 Attach a sense of urgency to the task: “I have to do this.”
 Create a highly visible to-do list that you can’t avoid seeing throughout
the day, perhaps on your desk.
 Don’t put short tasks on your to-do list — do them now. If a task is a
quickie, getting it done is often wiser than putting it on your to-do list —
you avoid adding to that mass of tasks hanging over your head like Poe’s
pendulum in the pit. Also, doing those quickie tasks now tends to keep
you from being overly perfectionistic about them, and, of course, you
avoid procrastination — you’ve gotten it done! So instead of the guilt,
you’ll start hearing from others, “Wow, thanks for the fast response!”
That feels so good.
322
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

 Just do it. Do it now, even if you don’t feel like it. If you work on your
career only when you feel like it, you won’t feel like it often enough.
Don’t expect it to be fun. As those obnoxious but correct people say, “No
pain, no gain.” Fight through the discomfort and just do it. Think how
good it will feel to have put in a good hour. Think of the benefits you’ll
derive. Then make yourself start working.
 Pick a specific time to start on your big task. Put it on your schedule,
just as you would a doctor’s appointment or a date with a friend. You
wouldn’t fink out on a friend. Why fink out on yourself? Choose the time
of day you’re most likely to actually do the task.
 Figure out where you’re least likely to procrastinate. If at home you
play too much with your dog, consider working somewhere else.
 Draw a thermometer and tape it to your desk. Instead of numbers on
its side, write the little steps you need to take to get the task done. Every
time you complete a step, color in that part of the thermometer. This
technique helps churches raise lots of money. When my wife was facing
her PhD dissertation, we posted on the refrigerator a hand-drawn ther-
mometer with all the milestones on the side. Each time she passed one,
we had a coloring-in ceremony. She says that was key to her getting her
dissertation done.
 Use a few-second task to get you rolling. Before you start or when you
reach a hard part, you may be tempted to grab a soda, call your friend,
or trim your nails. That’s when you have to force yourself to get working
(on the task, not your nails). Ask yourself, “What’s my next few-second
task?” An example of an answer: “I have to open my address book to see
whom I need to call.”
 Don’t think about how much work you have ahead of you. That can
overwhelm you into procrastination. Instead, think like a mountain
climber. Just put one foot in front of the other, and when you get to the
top and look down, you’ll be amazed at how far you’ve gone.
Before I began to write this book, I knew 400-plus pages lay ahead of me,
but I never let myself think about that. The task would’ve felt overwhelm-
ing. As soon as those thoughts entered my mind, I immediately replaced
them with, “What’s my next few-second task?”
 Be aware of the moment of truth. When tempted to procrastinate, you
face a moment of truth when you’re still not over the edge, like when
you’re on the brink of losing your temper. At that moment, you can
consciously suppress the desire to procrastinate. When you feel that
temptation arise, force up your energy, your discipline, and ask yourself,
“What’s my next few-second task?”
323
Chapter 12: Light My Fire, Please! Overcoming Procrastination

 Turn on pump-you-up music. That works for some, not others.
 Recognize that you build momentum. The more you accomplish, the
more you want to accomplish. The less you accomplish, the less you
want to accomplish.
 Think of your workday as a series of one-minute blocks. That mindset
proffers many advantages. Many one-minute blocks go wasted — for
example, when you’re on hold, while waiting for the boss, or before a
meeting begins. You’d be amazed how much work you can get done in
one minute. Work during those one-minute periods and you may wring
an extra half-hour out of your day without putting in any overtime.
Another benefit of the one-minute mindset is that it keeps you from
being too perfectionistic or becoming overwhelmed by the size of a task.
After all, you can do only so much in one minute.
Getting unstuck when all else fails
If, despite taking all the previous cures I offer in this chapter, you’re still pro-
crastinating, try one or more of the cures in the following sections.
Remind yourself of the benefits of not procrastinating
Pick the benefit most motivating to you. For example, years ago, I tried to get
my wife to quit smoking. I told her it could kill her. No impact. I told her
people think smokers are losers. No impact. I told her it didn’t look sexy. She
stopped that day and hasn’t taken a puff since.
Can’t think of a motivating-enough benefit? These may trigger something:
When you find a job, you can support your family, feel useful, afford that
vacation you’ve fantasized about, and rid yourself of the guilt that you’re let-
ting life pass you by.
How do you keep your key benefit in mind? One way is to cut a picture out of
a magazine of that benefit — a car, a home, whatever — and hang it next to
your computer or on your refrigerator. Or write a benefit of doing the task on
your palm. For example, one client wrote “GWOMB.” It stood for “Get Wife Off
My Back.”
Embarrass yourself
Recognize that choosing to procrastinate says, “I value fun more than being
productive, even when I’m supposed to be working.” Do you really want to
define yourself as a shirker? Do you want others to see you that way?
324
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

Look back
Although focusing on the future is helpful, also take a moment to look back.
See whether you can find a procrasti-cure among your reflections:
 Think back to times you’ve procrastinated. What were the conse-
quences? Has it hurt your career? Your relationships? Your self-esteem?
Sometimes, looking at the price you’ve paid for procrastinating can
make you angry enough with yourself to say, “I’m tired of sabotaging
myself. I’m not going to let this happen again.”
 Think back to a time you didn’t procrastinate on an unpleasant task.
What kept you from procrastinating then? A rigorous schedule?
Someone nagging you? Does that give you a clue as to how to beat your
current procrastination?
Grow up
How will you feel tomorrow about having procrastinated on a task today? Ask
yourself, “If I were my grown-up self, what would I do?”
Get advice from your twin
What would you say to get your twin to quit procrastinating? Often, people
know the solution but are too close to themselves to see it. Imagining that
you’re giving advice to someone just like you can enable you to see the forest
through the trees.
Focus on small changes
People often underestimate the effects of small changes. A client of mine,
Dianne, lived wracked with guilt because she paid little attention to the
accounting part of her photography business. I said, “Commit to 15 minutes a
day working on your books.” She did that and what a relief! Next session, she
said, “Fifteen minutes isn’t a big deal, but it turns out to make a big differ-
ence, psychologically as well as practically.”
Brand yourself with a scarlet letter
This tactic is a bit draconian, but what the heck. Write the letter “P” (for pro-
crastinator) on the outside of your hand so that everyone can see it. Unlike in
Hester Prynne’s case, no one’s forcing you to do it. That P, which follows you
everywhere you go, is an ongoing reminder that curing your procrastination
is Job One. The P is also embarrassing, so it may motivate you to overcome
the problem so you can honorably remove it.

Find someone to check in with
Some people can tackle projects without support. But many people, espe-
cially procrastinators, find that having someone to check in with is helpful.
Regular check-in is a key to the success of Weight Watchers and 12-step pro-
grams. It can be of equal value in your career. Here are some options:
 Get one-on-one support. Some people prefer one-on-one support. Find a
friend you can phone every day. Richard Bolles, author of What Color Is
Your Parachute?, suggests finding a “loving taskmaster” — someone who
can meet weekly or even daily with you, giving you a gently dispensed
hard time if you’ve been a slacker. I allow procrastinating clients to
e-mail me nightly to report their progress. One client said, “Knowing I’ll
have to report to you each night makes me feel like Marty Nemko is at
my side all day urging me on.”
 Seek support from a group. Would you prefer group support? Ongoing
groups are available in most large cities. For example, the 5 O’Clock Club
has branches in a few major cities plus virtual branches — online
groups (www.fiveOClockclub.com). Also consider Forty Plus. To find
your nearest chapter, visit www.40plus.org/links/. To find other
local job-search support groups, check out www.job-hunt.org/job-
search-networking/job-search-networking.shtml or check
with your chamber of commerce, college alumni association, church, or
unemployment office.
 Take the initiative. You can even start your own support group. Here’s
an approach adapted from Barbara Sher’s Wishcraft. Recruit members by
asking friends, relatives, or colleagues, or by placing an ad in a local
newspaper. Just write, “Forming a career-related support group. For
information, call (insert phone number).” Your group should have four to
six members. Meet weekly or at least monthly. At each session, each
person gets ten minutes in the hot seat. That member starts by telling
the group her goal(s). Then group members offer advice on objectives
for the next week. Before moving out of the hot seat, each person ends
by saying what she commits to accomplishing by the next meeting.
Consider using this book as the group’s “textbook” to help ensure that
all members are knowledgeable about career issues.
Members of job support groups generally do well. They feel accountable to
the group and come away with ideas and encouragement from group mem-
bers, as well as inspiration from seeing people arrive unhappy and leave with
better worklives.
Fall in love
I’m not sure why it works, but a number of lifelong procrastinators report
being cured after falling in love or having a baby.

Advice for the Incurable Procrastinator
I’ll be honest with you. Some people, despite knowing all the techniques in this
chapter, will still procrastinate, even if it means getting fired or going broke.
These individuals probably won’t find a cure in another book, workshop, or
therapist. I had a discussion with an eminent psychologist who has spent his
life writing and giving workshops on procrastination for a prestigious organi-
zation. In confidence, he admitted that he believes many, if not most, chronic
procrastinators are incurable. If you feel that’s you, this section’s advice is
for you.
You may not be able to change, but you can change your environment.
Incurable procrastinators thrive best in work environments in which tasks
 Don’t take long to complete
 Aren’t inordinately difficult
 Are structured, with a clearly laid-out, step-by-step process
 Are closely supervised
 Require being part of a team; the sense of obligation to the team moti-
vates procrastinators to get their part of the task done
 Must be completed on a tight deadline with no room for procrastination
Example: One inveterate procrastinator who is very bright and made a great
first impression had been hired three times by Corporate America and fired
three times by Corporate America. She’s finally found a job she can succeed
at: barista at Starbucks. That job meets all the above requirements. Making
coffee drinks doesn’t take much time, isn’t difficult, requires a step-by-step
procedure, has close supervision, involves teamwork (the barista makes the
drink and hands it to the sales clerk), and has tight deadlines — people want
their caffeine NOW!
The good news is that a permanent barista at Starbucks makes a reasonable
living with full benefits. Although this procrastinator lost the status she had
working in corporate offices, she no longer feels like a loser. She’s productive
and making a living. You can too.
Don’t want such a low-level career? I’ve scanned the 500-plus in Chapter 2’s
Cool Careers Yellow Pages and picked out a few that many people find appeal-
ing yet can often be done successfully by procrastinators: accountant, audiolo-
gist, electrician, librarian, locksmith, massage therapist, nurse occupational
therapist, optometrist, psychologist, physician assistant, and speech therapist.

Chapter 13
The Keys to Successful 
Self-Employment
In This Chapter
 Finding the idea
 Being aware of the downsides
 Creating a successful business
 Knowing how to handle challenges
T
he coolest career may be the one you create for yourself.
Who’s going to give you a salary to be a ghost hunter, peacock farmer, prairie
preservationist, collector of antique furniture, musical instrument maker,
horror aficionado, nature poet, Mediterranean culinary historian, backcountry
adventurer, boot maker, video biographer, surfing photographer, or Web cop?
Those are only a few of the thousands of cool careers people have created for
themselves by becoming their own bosses.
I’m not talking about building an elaborate business, as a classic entrepre-
neur might. If you were one of those, you probably wouldn’t be reading this
book. I’m simply talking about creating a job for yourself in which you find
customers who are willing to pay you to pursue your cool career. You don’t
need to have employees unless you want them and can afford them. You
probably won’t need to get bank loans or venture capital. You may not even
need to shell out the big bucks for an outside office. Many self-employed
people do just fine, thank you, working from home.
In this chapter, I show you the six essentials of self-employment. I also outline
potential disadvantages of self-employment and how to overcome them.

But What about the Downsides 
of Self-Employment?
People contemplating self-employment often get teased: “So you’re consider-
ing trading job security for the freedom to work 70 hours a week with no ben-
efits?” Or “Being self-employed is being on a perpetual job search.” Or “When
you’re on your own, you only have to work half-time — whichever 12 hours a
day you want.”
With a little luck, and if you follow the advice in this chapter, you have a good
chance of enjoying the freedom and control of self-employment along with
healthcare and other benefits, reasonable vacations, and at least as much job
security as you can get in a so-called real job. But first, here are the potential
downsides of self-employment (and ways to get around them):
 Job insecurity: Many people equate being your own boss with job inse-
curity. Fact is, self-employment, well done, offers a good shot at a life-
long paycheck. No one can fire you on a whim. You’ll never be offshored,
merged, purged, right-sized, or downsized. And with the average job
lasting only three and a half years now, isn’t job security more nostalgia
than reality?
 Insane hours: Conventional wisdom says that the self-employed work
harder and longer than anyone else. Yet scientists, corporate managers,
and nonprofit managers routinely work more than 50 hours a week. In
fact, many in the high-tech and biotech sectors think a 50-hour week is
for shirkers. Remember also that a 50-plus-hour corporate workweek
doesn’t even count the ever-lengthening commute time. Seventy-three
percent of people working in offices of 100 or more must work on week-
ends, and to make ends meet, many people are forced to request over-
time or to take a second job. The savvy self-employed often needn’t
work longer, especially if she’s working from home.
 You’re on a perpetual job search: If being on your own feels like a per-
petual job search, you’re probably not doing it right. At first, yes, you’ll
be busy lining up clientele, but stay with it awhile, and if you’re good
and you listen to your customers, business will start coming to you.
So you may be wondering: “If all this is true, why isn’t everyone self-
employed?” The answer is that many people aren’t suited to or interested in
being their own boss. But I’m assuming you score high on the self-employ-
ment test in Chapter 3. If so, you’re likely to do just fine in self-employment if
only you know how. This chapter will show you how.

Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

What Are the Six Musts for Successful
Self-Employment?
Mountains of books have been written about how to become successfully
self-employed. Yet, when I really think about it, the keys to success reduce to
only six things, which I explain in the following sections.
Coming up with a good idea
People think the key to a successful business is coming up with The Idea.
Actually, that’s the easy part. Good ideas are everywhere:
 Chapter 2 (the Cool Careers Yellow Pages) lists dozens of my favorite
self-employment ideas, including, for example, owning a chain of well-
located carts selling coffee or soup. That’s a low-cost, low-risk, high-
profit business.
Sure, those businesses have been done before. That’s actually a huge
plus. When you innovate, you’re a guinea pig. If you replicate, your odds
of success are much better because you’re copying a proven winner.
Don’t innovate; replicate.
 Your own regular Yellow Pages lists virtually every kind of business.
Scan its index, and in the space of an hour, you’ll be exposed to hun-
dreds of business ideas that are already up and running. Find one
you like? Visit a few businesses of its type, incorporate their best
features into your version of the business, and aim yours at a partic-
ular geographical location (or online), age group, or ethnic or gender
market.
 Think about your current work. Is there a problem you frequently hear
co-workers or customers complaining about? Could you start a business
that would solve it?
 Do you believe in a product or service that you may like to sell?
All things being equal, service businesses are safer than product busi-
nesses. Service businesses have no costly inventory, no theft problem,
and no spoilage. Plus, they’re usually easier to run from your home,
which saves you commute time and thousands of dollars in rent.
 Start a franchise. www.entrepreneurmag.com lists 500 prominent ones.
331
Chapter 13: The Keys to Successful Self-Employment

 Barbara Sher’s Idea Book contains a wealth of fun, easy-to-start small
business ideas, from gondolier to doll repairer. Her ideas generally pay
poorly but offer good quality of life. They’re a good balance to my more
practicality first/passion second approach to business.
 Paul and Sarah Edwards’ book Home-Based Businesses For Dummies, 2nd
Edition (Wiley), offers many ideas plus a bookful of strategies on how to
make a home business successful.
While you’re searching for good ideas, beware of the following:
 Don’t be tempted by advertised get-rich-quick schemes. You probably
won’t get rich and it certainly won’t be quick. Whatever they’re selling will
take time, energy, and money, just like whatever it is you really want to 
do. So don’t fall into the trap of thinking, “Well, I’ll just buy their envelope-
licking business ‘opportunity’ until I make plenty of money and then I’ll 
do what I really want to do.” Instead, save time and figure out how you 
can make money doing what you really want to do in the first place.
 Three of the top ten scams on the Internet involve work-at-home offers
and business opportunities. So, be extra skeptical of e-mail solicitations.
The old saying “If it sounds too good to be true, it is” has never been
truer. Scrutinize each offer with a careful eye. For example, does the
solicitation, as required by law, state the number and percentage of
previous purchasers who achieved the touted earnings? If the business
“opportunity” still seems interesting, check with the Better Business
Bureau: www.bbb.org. But just because nothing askance is reported
doesn’t mean a business offer is legitimate. Most people don’t report
being scammed; they’re embarrassed or think it’s their own fault.
Putting your toe in the water
A business idea may sound great, yet in practice, it’s a flop.
Sometimes an idea may, indeed, be sound, but you may not have the ability
to make it succeed. To reduce that risk, before choosing a business, watch
someone who’s already doing it. For example, if you’re thinking about being
a Web site designer, watch one for an hour or two. Can you see yourself,
with training, doing that for 40 hours a week and producing wonderful sites?
If so, try to learn a bit of the necessary material — for example, PHP, the
Web development language — on your own or with a tutor. (See Chapter 5
for more details about preparing for a career without a degree.) Are you
catching on quickly? If so, chances are you’ll develop the skills needed to
succeed.
332
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

Other times, a business succeeds only because of Herculean effort — an
owner willing to work 80 hours a week or invest a fortune to ensure its suc-
cess. Last time I looked, you didn’t look like Hercules, nor did you have a
fortune to invest.
Still other times, the idea is good, but its heyday is over. Open yet another
bagel, frozen yogurt, or Hawaiian barbecue joint in your city and you may
face a double whammy — a market that’s already saturated, and you’re
buying into a fad that may be fading.
A risk-reducer: Catch people in front of a store, call people out of the phone
book, arrange a get-together of friends, whatever. Describe your product or
service and ask them how likely they are to buy it. Beg them to be brutally
honest — “Better to know now than after I’ve opened the business.” Ask them
what they’d comfortably be willing to pay for your product or service and
how the product or service could be enhanced so they’d pay more.
Creating your mini business plan
Preparing a simple business plan helps you decide whether to be self-
employed. Don’t be intimidated by the term business plan. There’s no need
for a massive document. You probably can say all that’s necessary in fewer
than ten pages. Your business plan just needs to include
 Evidence that a market exists for your product or service (based on the
marketing survey you’ll do as described in the previous section)
 A description of your target customer
 What you’ll do to reach your market
 A list of your business’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
(A little research, even a simple Google search, can be helpful here.)
 A rough budget for the first two or three years, and where you’ll get the
money
After developing your business plan, ask yourself, “Would I invest in this busi-
ness?” If yes, show the plan to your business-savviest friends or a commercial
lending officer at a bank. Ask them the same question. If everyone gives you
the thumbs-up, you probably can proceed with confidence.

For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Paul Tiffany and Steven D. Peterson (Wiley). And

Chapter 13: The Keys to Successful Self-Employment

Having an entry plan that
keeps the cash flowing
You shouldn’t need a lot of money to launch your independent career. The
myth that you need a bank loan, venture capital, or rich friends and family
keeps too many people from becoming their own boss.
Creating a job for yourself isn’t like starting a traditional business. The aver-
age person starting a business spends just $5,000, according to the Small
Business Administration. Today, much of that money goes for a computer
and office equipment — which you may already have, and the costs of which
keep going down. Most of the self-employment opportunities listed in this
book’s Cool Careers Yellow Pages (see Chapter 2) require only a small invest-
ment. Before spending big, think hard about ways to launch your business
less expensively. If you can’t cut costs, before getting into hock, consider
another business.
In the following sections, I explain the components of an entry plan that
won’t break the bank.
Keys to controlling costs
The old axiom “It takes money to make money” may be true in big business,
but in creating your own little business, being a cheapskate actually helps.
You’re going to make errors in the beginning. So if you have low monthly
costs, you’re more likely to survive those errors without going bankrupt.
Here’s a list of ways to keep your costs low:
 Start your business at home. You can save thousands of dollars each
month on rent and other costs. If you need to meet with clients and your
place is a pigsty, offer them the convenience of meeting at their place, at
a quiet restaurant, or at a rent-by-the-hour office in an executive center.
 Provide a service rather than a product. Products must be produced
or bought, and usually require you to maintain thousands of dollars of
inventory.
 Learn how to be a businessperson. The small-business battlefield is lit-
tered with former business owners who had a great idea but lacked the
knowledge or willingness to run it, and especially to market it hard and
smart. Unless you love techno-minutiae, don’t bother getting technical
expertise; you can always hire that. You learn how to run a business.
That’s a skill that never goes out of style, that many people find doable
and more fun than learning endless arcana, and that opens the door to
making serious money. In contrast, most technical types work long
hours to earn just a moderate wage.
334
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

How should you learn business? Volunteer or work for successful busi-
nesspeople. Don’t try learning it in school. If those professors were such
good businesspeople, they’d probably be running a business, not teach-
ing. Remember that most professors are hired based on how well they
do research, not how good of businesspeople they are. One of my clients
is a business professor. He teaches entrepreneurship yet has never, ever
run a business. Indeed, the only jobs he’s ever held other than professor
are used car salesman and clerk at Radio Shack.
 Avoid the temptation to buy expensive stuff. Office furniture, state-of-
the-art techno-equipment, and pricey ads all cost money. You need that
cash for more important things, like your training, computer, marketing,
and perhaps a Web site. The guy who created mine (www.martynemko.
com) is Matt Nicholas (nicholassolutions.com).
 Avoid hiring help. If you need help, see whether you can hire other self-
employed people on an as-needed basis. Not only does that avoid the
ongoing overhead of employees, but it also saves you from paying hefty
payroll taxes and reduces the risk of someone suing you for wrongful
termination.
 Consider using a small business incubator. These are sets of adjacent
offices that allow you to share equipment and administrative-assistant
services, and provide a professional environment. With 1,000 incubators
in the United States and 4,000 worldwide, one is likely to be near you.
Beyond the cost-savings, the proximity of other budding entrepreneurs
seems to inject a pioneering spirit among everyone. A University of
Michigan study reported that 87 percent of businesses incubated by
“mature incubators” still were in business after five years. To find an
incubator, look in your Yellow Pages under “executive suites” or at the
National Business Incubator Association Web site: www.nbia.org.
Transition plans
Here are common ways to transition into self-employment:
 The Moonlighting Plan: Keep your full-time job and develop your busi-
ness as a sideline. When it takes off, you can go whole-hog. Be sure to
work at least eight hours a week on a sideline business.
 The Part-Time Plan: While you’re building up the business, work a part-
time job to provide a base income. When your business equals the base,
drop the part-time job.
 The Spin-Off Plan: Turn your previous employer into your first major
customer or, when ethically and legally possible, take a major client with
you from your previous job.
335
Chapter 13: The Keys to Successful Self-Employment

 The Cushion Plan: Of course, there are obvious cushions like savings,
divorce settlements, or severance packages, but think about less obvi-
ous assets. Benjamin funded his new business by selling his grand piano,
saying, “I wasn’t playing it anyway. It was just a very expensive piece of
furniture.” Your cushion should be large enough to cover your expenses
for the cash-poor startup phase, often 6 to 12 months, depending on the
business.
 The Leave Plan: Start your independent career while on leave or
sabbatical.
 The Piggyback Plan: If you have a working spouse or partner, cut back
your expenses so you can live on one salary until your business gets
going.
 The Key Client Plan: If you have sufficient stature in your field, line up
one or more retainer contracts with clients for the first year to provide
you with assured revenue in exchange for a discount rate.
Smart pricing
Of course, when you’re first starting out, charging top dollar is unfair, but as
soon as you feel it’s ethical, consider charging at least mid-range, if only
because many prospective clients will be turned off if you charge too little.
They believe that you get what you pay for.
Many new businesses charge too little, either because they’re desperate for
customers or because they fail to take into account all the costs of doing
business. In setting your pricing, start by figuring out what yields you a rea-
sonable annual income. On top of that, you must factor in all your costs —
for example, setting up your office, your Web site, training time, equipment,
materials, travel to clients, phones, accounting fees, utilities, marketing costs,
your benefits, and, importantly, the 30 percent to 70 percent you’ll typically
pay in federal, state, local, self-employment, Medicare, disability, business
license, and other taxes.
Do you lament that employed people get benefits but the self-employed don’t?
You simply have to build the cost of sick leave, vacation time, retirement, and
health insurance benefits into what you charge. Here are a few resources to
help you out:
 The Web site insure.com makes finding good insurance values easier.
 The Web site www.allbusiness.com links you to services for the self-
employed: insurance, legal services, even potential customers.
 Check with your state’s health insurance commission for special pro-
grams for the self-employed. To find yours, enter “state health insurance”
into the search engine at google.com and the name of your state.
336
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

Don’t base your fees on the assumption that you’ll be able to bill out a 40-
hour week. Few people can. The number of billable hours you can expect
to generate each week depends not only on how much business you can
line up but also on the nature of the work. A medical transcriptionist may
bill 40 hours a week, while a consultant may average no more than 15. Talk
to others about the norm in your field, but soon, your own experience will
be your best guide.
Finding money
Okay, I’ve done what I can to keep you out of debt, but sometimes it’s
unavoidable. If you really need to borrow money to get underway, here’s the
straight scoop on the most often considered sources of startup funds:
 Banks: Banks are eager to give loans to small businesses and self-
employed individuals for expansion. The problem is, they’re looking for
a two- to three-year track record.
The U.S. Small Business Administration can make it easier for you to get
a good bank loan, especially if you’re a woman or minority. Take a look
at www.sba.gov/financing/index.html.
 Equity loan: If you have significant equity in your home, banks will
gladly lend you money at a decent rate, but beware. You don’t want to
risk losing your home on a risky business.
 Friends, relatives, and other personal contacts: This may be your best
bet, but before hitting up ol’ Uncle Albert, consider what would happen
to your relationship with him if, somehow, you aren’t able to repay.
 Credit cards: Usually the easiest approach, but it’s expensive unless
you’re careful. Here’s how you might do it. Get at least two cards while
you still have a job: one for personal use and one for your business. Find
cards with low introductory interest rates. Currently, some offer 0 percent
for the first year. After that, you can switch cards for a new introductory
rate.
To find the best credit card deals, check out www.bankrate.com/brm/
rate/brm_ccsearch_lowrate.asp.
 Venture capital: Generally, forget about it. Venture capitalists want to
invest at least hundreds of thousands of dollars for a piece of some
action that promises them millions. They’re not interested in helping
someone create a great little career. Still curious about venture financ-
ing? www.vfinance.com has lots of articles, plus links to 1,500 venture
capital firms and 24,000 angel investors (see the next bullet).
Beware of firms offering to find you venture financing for a four-figure
fee. They rarely work. If you need help tweaking your business plan, hire
a consultant for an hour or two.
337
Chapter 13: The Keys to Successful Self-Employment

 Angels: Say you’re not established enough for a bank loan, too small
for a venture capitalist, without friends and family, and holding too
many maxed-out credit cards. Maybe you need to be touched by an
angel — a financial angel, that is. Angels are individuals looking for
projects to invest in. How to find one? Light a candle and pray at www.
angelnetwork.com and www.vfinance.com. Just be sure you have
an irresistible one- to two-page summary of your business plan (which
I cover earlier in this chapter) and a compelling 30-to-60-second verbal
summary ready to go.
 Other sources: Inc. magazine (inc.com) and Entrepreneur magazine
(entrepreneurmag.com) often have features on financing your small
business.
Acting like the CEO you are
When you’re self-employed, you suddenly go from subordinate to CEO. To
succeed, you have to act like the chief executive. Here are common no-nos:
 Never use a resume. Prepare a bio, brochure, and/or portfolio. Have
professional-looking letterhead, business cards, stationery, and probably
a Web site.
 Never refer to yourself as a freelancer. If you want to command good
fees, don’t represent yourself as less than the head of your own com-
pany. Freelancers routinely get paid less and are paid last. Also, never
put the word just in front of what you do — for example, “It’s just a home
business” or “I’m just a one-man shop.” Be proud of your one-person
operation. After all, your clients never have to work with an underling.
They get the personal attention of the firm’s principal.
 Never ask for an interview. Interviews are for jobs. You are getting busi-
ness, lining up customers, serving clients. Therefore, you arrange for a
meeting, offer to make a presentation, make a bid, provide a quote, or
submit a proposal.
 Never ask what someone pays. Tell people what you charge. However,
don’t announce your fees first thing, even if that’s the first thing they ask
for. Explain that you need to better understand their needs before you
can quote a price. That gives you the opportunity to learn their needs
and explain how they’d benefit from your work. Build value for what you
do before announcing the price and customers are more likely to be
relieved to hear that your fee isn’t higher.
 Never work without an agreement. Before you begin working with a
new client or customer, get an agreement in writing as to what you’ll be
doing, the price, payment arrangements, and so on. Depending on the
nature of your work, your agreement can be a simple order form, a pur-
chase order, or a contract.
338
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

You will often be the one to provide the contract, but large organizations
usually have their own standard forms. Beware when you get one of
those babies — their attorney probably wrote it to benefit them. If
you’re nervous, hiring your own legal eagle to review it is a good idea.
And remember that even though those corporate contracts look official,
they’re not set in stone. Don’t hesitate to negotiate.
When extending credit, remember that it’s always a privilege, no matter
how big, well-known, or established the customer. Take the time to
check credit references. Big companies go bankrupt, too. Remember
that United Airlines, Macy’s, and Bethlehem Steel went Chapter 11.
 Never complain. Your customers have enough problems of their own.
That’s probably part of why they want to work with you. So don’t add to
their problems. If you’re having business or personal difficulties, com-
miserate with family and friends if need be, but don’t moan and groan to
clients. Ever hear a CEO complain to a customer?
Getting business to come to you
It’s every new businessperson’s biggest question: How do I get customers?
Eventually, if you’re good, repeat business and word of mouth may largely
sustain you, but for now at least, you have to get the word out. People have
to know not only what you do but also how you’re different from others who
do similar work.
The good news is that you have plenty of ways to market, and you need to
choose only the method(s) you feel comfortable with. If cold calling makes
you sweat, pick something else. Chances are, you won’t do a marketing activ-
ity you hate. Here are several of the quickest, most effective marketing activi-
ties, and they’re also low-cost:
 Schmoozing: Otherwise known as networking, schmoozing is the most
popular way for self-employed people to get business. You can schmooze
at professional and trade association meetings, in business organizations
and Chambers of Commerce forums, and through formal networking
groups like linkedin.com and Business Network International (www.
bni.com), which has chapters nationwide.
If business gatherings aren’t for you, schmooze colleagues, friends, and
associates. Pick up the phone, do lunch, or go to lots of parties. Or
browse Web sites and user groups, leaving helpful information along the
way. Add a tag line to your online signature so people know what you do
and can reach you by e-mail.
Even social networking sites such as match.com, facebook.com,
myspace.com, friendster.com, and even youtube.com can be
used for business networking. In your profile, describe what you do,
with enthusiasm.
339
Chapter 13: The Keys to Successful Self-Employment

 Conduits: Conduits are business owners whose customers need what
you offer. Make a list of everyone your potential customers do business
with. Those are your conduits. For example, if you have a cleaning serv-
ice, commercial real estate agents can be conduits for you because their
clients need property cleaned before sales. Let all relevant conduits
know about you and what you offer. Sometimes, referrals from one or
two good conduits can keep you busy full time.
A variation on the theme: cross-referral. Figure out categories of busi-
nesspeople you can cross-refer with: “I’ll send you mine if you’ll send me
yours.” In my case, as a career counselor, I may target headhunters. I’d,
for example, attend a local conference of headhunters and, during
breaks, chat with people until I found at least one to whom we both felt
we could honorably refer clients.
 Cold calling: Some hate it, some love it. But if you’re good at it, it can be
very effective. Why do you think companies do so much telemarketing?
 Your Web site: Creating a site that will be picked up by the search
engines is an art, and it’s often best left to a pro. When interviewing can-
didates to create your site, ask what they do to optimize your site so it
appears high in search engine rankings. In addition, Google’s AdSense
ads may, depending on your business, be a cost-effective way to drive
traffic to your site.
 Online ratings: If you provide a service in a major metropolitan area, get
a free listing on popular rating services such as local.yahoo.com,
angieslist.com, citysearch.com, and insiderpages.com. Ask
your satisfied customers to rate you.
 Consultant sites: If you’re a consultant, try posting your availability on
these sites: www.elance.com and www.guru.com.
 Flyers: Post flyers where your target customers will see them. If I were
looking for new clients, I might post flyers near a college’s career center
saying:
Want more career help?
I pick up where college career centers leave off.
 Sampling: Your work can be your own best sales force. Let people see
what you do. Give them a taste and whet their appetite for more. You
can provide samples of your work through your Web site, photos, port-
folios, brochures, business cards, demonstrations, DVDs, free consulta-
tions, speeches, and seminars or by passing out actual samples.
 Articles: Write an article for a trade publication or have someone write
an article about your business. I enjoy doctors as clients, so I could see
myself writing a piece for the local medical society’s newsletter called
“When Doctors Have Necrotic Career Syndrome.”
340
Part IV: Making Any Career Cooler 

 Giving a talk: Libraries and service clubs such as Kiwanis and Rotary are
always looking for speakers. Or speak at a professional conference. For
example, if you run a bookkeeping service, give a talk called “The Seven
Keys to Doing Your Own Bookkeeping” at a small business owners conven-
tion. Be sure to give attendees a handout that lists the major points of
your talk, plus your contact information. Many of your attendees will try
to do their own bookkeeping but later decide that outsourcing it to you
is wiser.
 Being interviewed on a talk show: Especially on small stations, getting
on the air is easier than you may think. Just call the radio station, ask
to speak with the producer of (insert name of talk show) and give a 
30-second pitch about why listeners would be interested in you. For
example, “I run a crime scene cleanup business, and you wouldn’t
believe the stuff I see. There was this time when a girlfriend pushed
her boyfriend and all his stuff out the window. He’s fine, but you’d be
amazed what was among his things. So I think your listeners might find it
fun to have me on the show.”
Please, if you need more customers, whenever you’re not doing paying work,
make marketing your number one priority. This may be the most important
sentence in this chapter.
But What If I Fail?
If you fall on your face, corny as it may sound, force yourself to congratulate
yourself for having had the courage to try, regroup, and put together another
plan for crafting your cool career. Winston Churchill once said that success is
moving from failure to failure with grace, composure, and confidence. Being
more optimistic than that, I would add: until you get the hang of it. If you’re
willing to learn from your experiences, you probably will get the hang of it;
you’ll find a way to make your cool career work.
And of course, deciding at any point that being your own boss isn’t for you is
perfectly okay. As you can see in the Cool Careers Yellow Pages in Chapter 2,
there are plenty of great salaried careers.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
n working with more than 2,500 clients over the past
20 years, I’ve found that there are only a small number
of important career musts. Many of them are usually con-
veyed only privately, either by a career coach, or more
often, by a wise parent to a child.
In this part, we share them with you. Note that I said “we.”
Some of these career musts apply to everyone, but others
are — like the hair dye — just for men. Others are just for
women. As a guy, I figured I wasn’t the right, well, guy, to
write about career musts for women, but I found the per-
fect person — my amazing wife.

O
pportunities for women in the workplace have never been greater.
Often, if a woman doesn’t succeed, it’s not because a cabal of men has
erected a glass ceiling; it’s because she’s shot herself in the foot. This chap-
ter’s ten career musts can ensure you don’t.
Note: Barbara Nemko contributed this chapter. She is the Napa County (CA)
Superintendent of Schools, recent Northern California Schools
Superintendent of the Year, and wife of author Marty Nemko.
Being Who You Are
Today, some women subvert who they are to prove that they can do anything
a man can. For example, some women endure physics and calculus for an
engineering major and a construction-site engineering career, not because
they love engineering, but mainly because society or their parents encour-
aged them to pursue a nontraditional career. Not surprisingly, women engi-
neers leave the field at twice the rate of men.
Other women do the opposite: hiding their competence for fear of appearing
too strong. That, of course, devastates their career.
Be who you are. For example, if you do love and are talented in engineering,
go for it, certainly. In fields with fewer than 50 percent women, you often find
special efforts made to court you. But being courted isn’t worthwhile if a frog
(a misfitting career) is doing the courting. Choose a career that’s right for you.

Similarly, after they’re on the job, some women, in an attempt to show how
tough they are, try to act like stereotypical men — all bottom-line. And they’d
never dare to do anything as stereotypically female as baking cookies for the
staff. Be yourself. If you’re all business, that’s fine, but if you’re more comfort-
able blending a bit of traditional femininity into your workplace, that may be
even better. If, for example, you enjoy baking cookies, bring ’em on in — food
is love.
I had a male supervisor who warned me against bringing in home-baked
goodies because he was afraid I’d be regarded as a lightweight. I’ve never
found that to be the case. In fact, people seem to like my Jewish-mom caring.
Plus, last year, I was named my region’s Schools Superintendent of the Year,
so I don’t think the Death-by-Chocolate brownies I bake and serve at meet-
ings hurt my career.
Being Self-Effacing
Conventional wisdom is that women should never be self-effacing. It rein-
forces unfair stereotypes that women are weak. But I’ve found that if you’re
already viewed as competent, occasional self-effacement is a plus, especially
when done in a lighthearted way.
For example, I always make fun of the fact that I can’t sing, am terrible in
sports, and even that I’m technologically challenged. Remember, more than
anything, people want to feel good about themselves. If you’re in an even
moderately powerful position, it helps to admit things you can’t do. When
you’re self-effacing, the people who work for you may feel better about them-
selves and therefore be more open to what you have to say.
You don’t want to be self-effacing in a job interview. There, you haven’t yet
established your credibility. For details on interviewing, see Chapter 10.
Negotiating for Fair Pay
Most employers want to get every employee, man or woman, to work for as
little as possible. Employers are more successful at getting women to work
for less not mainly because of sexism but because, on average, women are
more willing to accept an employer’s weak offer and, after being hired, are
less likely to ask for a raise.
If you negotiate and do it well, in most cases, you should be able to get equal
pay for truly equal work. Indeed, Dr. Warren Farrell, the only man who served
three times on the board of the National Organization for Women in New York
City, wrote a book, Why Men Earn More, which distills a decade of U.S. Bureau
346
Part V: The Part of Tens 

of Labor Statistics and other authoritative data. That research indicates that
when men earn more, it’s usually because more men are willing to do the
things that earn higher pay: move all over the country to God-forsaken places
to get promotions, acquire difficult-to-acquire skills such as computational
biology, work more than 50 hours a week, take additional training at night
and on weekends, or accept greater risk — for example, a 100-percent com-
mission-based job. Indeed, the book concludes that for many popular
careers, for truly the same work, women earn at least as much as men. The
statistic that women earn just 80 cents on the dollar is misleading.
Too many women feel grateful or lucky when offered a big job and just accept
a weak offer. Learn how to negotiate.
Competing Healthily
Competing with women (and men) is fine — competition can fuel some people
to achieve their best. But some women seem to compete with other women
on trivial matters — notably, their appearance. Out of jealousy, some women
sabotage an attractive female co-worker: by withholding key business informa-
tion, spreading false rumors, taking credit for her work, and so on. Please, if
you want to be taken seriously at work, don’t let petty stuff intrude on your
worklife. It’s hard to expect people at work to respect you if you’re playing
those games.
Balancing Work and Family
For societal and perhaps biological reasons, the average woman wants to be
more involved in family matters than the average man does. Women are gen-
erally more eager to have children, and they want to be more involved in
raising them and in caring for aging parents.
If that’s you, make a conscious choice. Do you want to be superwoman:
deeply involved in family while holding a demanding job in which the norm
is a 60-hour workweek? Or do you want to opt for a more balanced life?
Choosing the latter is fine, but accept that you probably won’t be selected
for that job in which a 60-hour workweek is the norm if you’re not willing to
work that many hours.
There is a way to have it all: hire help. If you’re in or even aspiring to a big
job, hiring domestic and child-care help can be a terrific investment. For little
cost, if you search a bit, you can find someone, perhaps a college student, to
pick up your kids, drive them to after-school activities, pick up the groceries
and dry cleaning, and start dinner.
347
Chapter 14: Top Ten Career Musts for Women

Research shows that what counts in parenting is quality time. Don’t feel
guilty if you’re working a very full-time job. Just be sure that you do provide
that quality time daily. For example, even though I was working full time, our
family usually had dinner together (I would cook up a storm on Sunday and
freeze meals for the week), talked about the day, and Marty and I read our
daughter a bedtime story. That routine went on long after she knew how to
read. It was a wonderful time for all of us.
But to be honest, superwomen rarely exist outside of comic books. Many
women find that opting for balance is wise. Especially if you have children,
you may want to aim for a 20-to-40-hour-a-week job, leaving time not only for
family responsibilities, but also for fun.
In our marriage, we have a bailiwick system. We divide life’s tasks according to
our preferences and strengths. I’m a neat freak, so home care is my bailiwick; I
do those tasks or hire someone to do them. Marty is a lousy cook and thus is
prohibited from preparing meals, but he’s a whiz at investments, insurance,
gardening (I hate getting dirt under my nails), and the like. Those aren’t my
strengths or interests, so he has 100 percent responsibility for those. Our
bailiwick system avoids arguments about whose turn it is to do the dishes,
and we each feel a certain pride in having control over our domain.
A bit of advice about maternity leave: After having their babies, many
women return to work, but their heart is mainly with their baby. They’re also
exhausted — having an infant is draining — which additionally diminishes
their drive to work. You don’t want to ruin your reputation at work, so consider
coming back to work part time for the first few months, and when you’re at
work, be sure you really work. Otherwise, you’ll convey the impression that
you’re permanently going to give your job short shrift. If you’re working part
time, be sure your hours are clearly posted, including the hours you work
from home. And stick to your schedule. That way, people know you’re really
working.
Harnessing Your Hormones
In my younger days, during the few days before my period, I was sort of a
lunatic. I’d get teary from little sadnesses that I’d easily shrug off the rest of
the month. Routine annoyances would turn me into the Dragon Lady. Now, in
menopause, those hormonal changes aren’t as problematic, although they’re
still a bit of an issue.
Here’s how I minimize their effects on my worklife: When I’m feeling cranky, I
generally keep it to myself and just try to minimize stressful interactions. At
meetings, I’m deliberately quieter. If pushed, I might ask whether we can put
the discussion off until tomorrow.
348
Part V: The Part of Tens 

With regard to hot flashes, we’re not living in Victorian times. Besides, the
entire Boomer generation is going through menopause. So, if I suddenly feel a
furnace in me, I just rip off my jacket and fan myself. I even have one of those
little battery-operated fans. I believe that being upfront about menopause,
indeed joking a bit about it, turns a potential negative into something slightly
endearing.
Getting Physical
Even if your job doesn’t normally require physical strength, chances are good
that you occasionally have to lift something heavy. For example, our daugh-
ter is an attorney. She frequently needs to move 30-pound deposition boxes
down the hall or store them in an airplane’s overhead compartment. She
makes a point of not asking a man for help, and instead does such things her-
self. That’s a vivid way to show that — like Rosie the Riveter flexing her
biceps — she can do it all. That also conveys the message that she won’t use
being a woman as an excuse for anything. Men, except for the increasingly
rare Neanderthal types, respect that.
Dressing Wisely
Wear what you want — if you’re not worrying about your choice impeding
your career. For some people, making a fashion statement is so central to
their identity that they’re willing to let their career suffer. But if you’re not
willing to pay that price, forget about what’s in the fashion magazines. You
don’t want to look like you’re spending all your time and money trying to
keep up with the fashion fads. Doing that conveys a shallow image.
In some arty or avant-garde workplaces, anything goes, but in general, dress-
ing for success means dressing in quality, timeless designs — look at what TV
news anchors wear. You want to be thought of as a professional, not a runway
model. If you enjoy making bold fashion statements or wearing a nose ring,
save them for after work. One more tip: A scantily clad or tattooed employee
doesn’t look professional.
Even if your workplace encourages casual dress, casual doesn’t mean sloppy.
Leave those flip-flops for the beach. You’re safest with high-quality, middle-of-
the-road choices.

Chapter 14: Top Ten Career Musts for Women

Flirting to Advantage
Daniel Goleman, in his book, Social Intelligence, reports that when a woman
makes eye contact with a guy for even a moment, it releases dopamine in
him, and in turn, increases his feeling of well-being. Babies flirt shamelessly
with everyone, and people love it. Don’t you want people to associate you
with a sense of well-being? You don’t want to be known as a big flirt, but a
smile, a bit of eye contact, and an unexpected “How are you doing?” has long
made the world go round.
Dating in the Workplace without Disaster
Most advice on workplace dating is equally applicable to men and women,
so you can flip to Chapter 16 (which covers career musts for everyone) for
details. Here, I mainly want to warn you about the one workplace dating issue
that applies more often to women than to men: compartmentalization.
Men, on average, are more likely than women to compartmentalize their
relationship issues. For example, Bill Clinton had one of the world’s most
embarrassing affairs (remember the cigar?) trumpeted all over the media
for months. Yet, it seemed to have no impact on his ability to do his job.
Most women I know are less able to do that. If you dated one of your co-
workers, would you feel compelled to treat your sweetie differently in
the workplace? If you broke up, would everyone in the office know it,
even without your telling them? Think about how you’d feel if you broke
up and had to see him daily. If you don’t think you’d handle it well, don’t
date anyone at work.
If you think you can compartmentalize your relationship, the workplace may
be the best place to meet a romantic partner. After all, at a bar or club, for
example, you’re judging mainly on looks (and that judgment is likely affected
by alcohol). At work, you get to see your prospect in action, day in and day
out. Is he kind? Competent? Successful? Chasing every skirt in the office?
Disclosure: I’m not unbiased on this issue. Marty and I met at work and we’ve
been together now for 30 happy (well, usually happy) years.

Top Ten Career Musts for Men
In This Chapter
 Expanding your options at work and at home
 Embracing your inner maleness without being a Neanderthal
 Working wisely with women
S
o many books offer career advice for women. The Women and Business cat-
egory at amazon.com lists 950 titles. Yet Amazon doesn’t even have a Men
and Business category. This chapter helps fill the gap. Men need guidance too.
Consciously Decide Whether You Want
to Be the Primary Breadwinner
In most families, the man is still the primary breadwinner. Often, that’s
assumed. Far wiser is for each couple to discuss that crucial issue openly.
For example, in being the primary breadwinner, are you forced to take a job
that makes you miserable? Some high-paying jobs pay so well because few
people would otherwise take them; examples include traveling salespeople,
middle managers in an insurance company, and corporate lawyers.
Would you be happier in a lower-paying but more rewarding career? Women,
in general, have been wiser about trading money for quality of life. Should
you consider that? Might it be worth living in more modest housing in
exchange for working at a job you love? Should your wife assume more of the
financial burden even if she’s not able to be at home as much with the kids?
(The evidence is mixed on whether stay-at-home moms’ kids do better.)
Should you do more housework? Parenting? Would you enjoy that more than
working for a fire-breathing boss, or in a clanging, carcinogenic factory?
Fortunately, you have no rules — there is no more “men’s work” or “women’s
work.” Each couple should craft for themselves the division of labor that best
accommodates both spouses’ strengths and preferences.

Consider Nontraditional Careers
For decades now, women have, appropriately, been encouraged to consider
all careers rather than just those traditionally held by women. Similarly, men
should consider the full range of career options. Some traditionally female
careers can be unusually rewarding: librarian, teacher, editor, nurse, and
graphic designer, for example. A real man chooses a career that feels right for
him without worrying that it’s not a “manly” career.
Use the Power of Deep Connection
Women, on average, are better at connecting with people than men are. They
start young. Walk into any kindergarten and you’ll see most girls playing
together cooperatively, while most boys are playing by themselves or in
very uncooperative ways: pushing, chasing, and terrorizing. Fast forward
a few years and, in most households, while boys are staring at a TV or com-
puter game, girls are on the phone or instant messaging their friends. Fast
forward to adulthood and you’ll find nine zillion women’s organizations —
the ultimate networking opportunity — and barely any for men.
Guys, you gotta recognize the power of deep connection. When you talk with
another man, ask about deeper things than his new car, techno-toy, or the
score of the big game. I’m not saying you have to “process deep feelings,” but
guys care plenty about their careers, health, looks, finances, maybe even feel-
ings. Find out what the person you’re talking with is most concerned about,
and discuss that. Then share a concern of yours. Be careful, however, not to
give unwanted advice, particularly to women. The stereotype is generally
true: Women mainly want to be heard rather than to have their problem
solved. I don’t get it, but then again, I’m a guy. Because men do, in general,
appreciate advice and don’t just need to be heard, when you’re talking with
a guy, you may offer each other help that solves problems. That’s likely to
bond you enough that you both want to help each other’s careers.
Temper “Male Energy”
Workplaces used to deify “male energy”: aggressiveness, competition, individ-
ualism. Today, in many workplaces — especially those with a number of
female higher-ups — to survive, let alone thrive, men usually must temper
male energy. That may or may not yield better business results, but certainly,
in recent years, the pendulum has swung to give women’s ways of being more
respect than men’s. The unvarnished truth is that in today’s typical work-
place, men must usually accommodate to women’s ways, not vice versa.
352
Part V: The Part of Tens 

A no-holds-barred approach to achieving a goal may win the battle but will
probably lose the war. For example, one salesman wanted to become the head
honcho when the boss retired. To put himself in line, he did the following:
 Hyped product strengths, downplayed product weaknesses, and pushed
customers harder to “make the commitment.”
 Unfairly complained about fellow team members to the boss.
 Dominated the weekly sales meeting. Although six people were in the
room, he talked half the time.
This salesman sold more machines but, not surprisingly, didn’t get the pro-
motion. Why? Because he pushed some customers so hard that they com-
plained to the boss, and his complaints about co-workers and his dominating
meetings were seen as the ploys they were.
Drive is often key to achieving excellence, but please, don’t cross ethical
lines. And even when ethical, always ask yourself whether the side effects of
being aggressive might outweigh the benefits.
Be Tactful and Listen Well
Another form of excessive aggressiveness: bluntness. Many men think of
bluntness as a positive: “I’m direct, a straight-shooter.” Fact is, if the blunt-
ness decimates your listener, the price may be too great. Women, in general,
are better at criticizing tactfully. You can be tactful too.
Occasionally, to shake a person’s undue complacency, you must be blunt. But
do that often, and you’ll probably be viewed not as a straight-shooter but as
insensitive. When you must criticize, do it in the most self-esteem-preserving
way. For example, “I noticed (insert your concern) and wonder whether there’s
something I’m not understanding.” When the person explains, even if it’s an
imperfect explanation, try to accept it, knowing that you planted a seed —
he’ll probably make the necessary change.
353
Chapter 15: Top Ten Career Musts for Men
Do you talk too much at meetings?
Rule of thumb: In a meeting, talk no more than 50
percent above your share of time. For example, if
you’re in an hourlong meeting with six attendees,
your share is ten minutes. Your maximum talk
time: 15 minutes. And that assumes that you have
more of value to say than the other attendees.
Normally, you want to talk less than that.

Poor listening is among aggressiveness’s most insidious manifestations. The
aggressive person is so eager to prove his point that he listens poorly to what
the other person is saying, thereby losing opportunities to find common
ground, let alone to have his mind changed. Above all, learn to listen well.
Controlling unbridled aggressiveness is particularly important if your boss is
a woman. Many female bosses worry about being steamrolled by male
energy, so you’ll get lots of brownie points if you temper your aggressiveness
with good listening and tactfully made suggestions.
If you find yourself unable to consistently follow my advice to temper your
maleness to accommodate to today’s typical workplace, you may be more
likely to find success in the handful of remaining fields in which male-centricity
remains the norm — for example, aerospace, construction, transportation,
energy, agriculture, and manufacturing.
Mind Your Health
Men die six years younger than women, and it seems that more men than
women in their mid- to late-50s show significant decline in physical and
mental capability. That, I believe, partly explains why Boomer men are having
a harder time finding jobs than are Boomer women.
Because men are at risk of earlier decline, it’s especially important that you
take precautions to forestall aging and disease. I’m not telling you anything
new here, but perhaps this is a wakeup call to get serious about controlling
your weight, not smoking, drinking no more than moderately, and getting reg-
ular, moderate exercise. Science is finding that your mother may have been
right: Walking may be the best exercise. And despite all the diet books and
fads, the best advice can fit on a thimble: Eat lots of fruits and veggies, a mod-
erate amount of whole-grain rather than refined-grain carbs, and little fat.
Easier said than done, I know.
Flirt with Your Antennae Out
Flirting is fun, but, in today’s workplace, it’s risky, especially for men. Women
typically have the power in such matters: If you flirt and she perceives it as
unwelcome, in most workplaces, her perception is presumed valid unless
proven otherwise, which is hard to do. And if you flirt again, you’re on the
road to a sexual harassment claim. Telling a woman three days this week how
great she looks may be innocent to you, yet it can be perceived as “persistent
unwanted advances.” At that point, no matter how trivial you say your com-
ments were, many HR departments would initiate an inquiry.
354
Part V: The Part of Tens 

I’m not saying you shouldn’t compliment women. I’m not even saying that you
can’t flirt. But the burden is on you: Have your antennae out for even a scin-
tilla of verbal or nonverbal indication that your attentions are unwelcome.
Don’t Date Your Supervisee
Note: This section applies to women as well as men, but because more men
are bosses, I placed it in this chapter.
In my view, if you’re the type who can keep a personal relationship from
affecting your worklife, the advantages of dating people you meet at work
outweigh the liabilities. (Of course, I’m biased in that I met my wife at work.)
But I beg you, even if company policy doesn’t prohibit it, not to date some-
one you supervise. Your supervisee may agree to go out with you only for
fear of hurting her career if she says no. Is that the basis on which you want
a date? And if things go wrong, oy! The supervisee often claims the boss
abused the power relationship, which can cost you your job. Or what if she
threatens to make that claim unless you promote her or let her get paid full
time for part-time work? Even if you dodge those bullets, having to supervise
your disgruntled ex-lover won’t be fun. And just imagine if you wanted to fire
her! Even when the relationship is working fine, higher-ups may make you
pay. Esteemed Boeing CEO Harry Stonecipher was fired simply for having a
consensual affair with a Boeing employee.
React to Reverse Discrimination
I’ve been career coach to 2,500 clients, almost all professionals. In the confi-
dentiality of my office, a surprising number have asserted that women (and
minorities) receive favoritism in hiring and promotion over men who are
more competent and/or willing to work longer hours.
If you believe you’ve been the target of reverse discrimination, you could try a
lawsuit, but that’s very chancy and exhausting. Or you could make a career of
changing today’s common belief that reverse discrimination is appropriate.
If you don’t want to pursue those options, get over it. In many workplaces
and universities, reverse discrimination is a fact of life. It’s bad enough that
you may be treated unfairly; don’t let it also destroy your peace of mind.
355
Chapter 15: Top Ten Career Musts for Men

Be Proud to Be a Man
In the appropriate attempt to redress past and lingering discrimination
against women, society’s mind-molders — schools, colleges, and media — are
empowering women, but too often at men’s expense. Textbooks, college pro-
fessors, sitcoms, movies, even newspaper and magazine features tend to por-
tray women as the good guys and men as testosterone-poisoned boors,
crooks, or abusers. The schools and colleges continually trumpet the contri-
butions of women, while accentuating the evils of men, especially “Dead
European White Males.” It’s easy to see why, today, women’s self-esteem, on
average, is higher than men’s, and why only 1⁄3 of the college graduating class
of 2007 is male.
Let me remind you that, despite what society’s mind molders may say, all men
are not killers, rapists, slackers, and dolts. Aristotle, Plato, Jesus, Leonardo
da Vinci, Beethoven, Monet, the Wright Brothers, Jonas Salk, Steven Spielberg,
and 98 percent of the Nobel Prize winners for science are all men. In addition,
the key scientists behind every drug from aspirin to breast cancer break-
through Herceptin, and the leaders behind such advances as anesthetics,
heart bypass surgery, refrigeration, heating, the electric light bulb, the radio,
the television, the computer, the mapping of human genome, even the birth
control pill — all are men. And in the five decades since the women’s move-
ment began, 97 percent of science, 92 percent of literature, and 100 percent of
economics Nobel Laureates still are men.
Turning to the lower rungs of the work world, almost all people who do such
grungy, dangerous, life-shortening work as fumigator, prison guard, coal miner,
steelworker, and sewer maintainer are men. And 99 percent of American sol-
diers killed in Iraq are men. And the only gender required to register for the
draft is, you guessed it, men.
The fact is, most men are hard working, goal-oriented, and straight shooting.
The world needs both men and women. Don’t forget it.
Of course some men (and women) are an embarrassment to their gender,
indeed to the human race. And, in my view, you have an obligation, not only
to yourself but also to your fellow men and women, to use traditionally male
attributes — aggressiveness, drive, and a protective instinct — to positive
ends. Indeed, in and out of today’s workplace, you have ample opportunities
to use your maleness for great good. Many men do. You can too.

Top Ten (Or So) Career
Musts for Everyone
In This Chapter
 Getting what you want without becoming obnoxious
 Finding a mentor and being a mentor
 Dating in the workplace without disaster
 Sharing the most important lesson I ever learned
P
rioritizing these career musts will contribute to your having a cool
career, indeed a cool life, more than anything I can think of.
Become a Master Communicator
The key is good listening: really trying to understand what the talker is saying
while noticing changes in her tone of voice and body language, imagining
how she’s feeling, and asking follow-ups to be sure you really understand. It’s
not easy.
Becoming a better listener is mainly a matter of will. When your mind drifts,
for example, to “What do I want to say next?” say to yourself, “Stop! Listen!”
When you’re talking, your tone and pace must be pleasant. To experiment,
talk into a tape recorder: Try faster and slower paces, the low, middle, and
high parts of your vocal range. What’s most pleasing? Get in the habit of
using that voice.
Don’t talk too much or too little. Rule of thumb: In any one-on-one interac-
tion, talk 30 to 50 percent of the time. If the other person is quiet, ask ques-
tions to draw him out. Don’t you like it when people ask you a question?

Work Hard
People tell you it’s more important to work smart than to work hard. Fact is —
and I’m sorry to break the bad news — most successful people work smart and
hard. The good news is that most hard workers feel unusually fulfilled. It feels
great to be productive. Take pride in your work more than your home, in what
you produce more than what you preach.
Treat Chapter 11 as your worklife bible: It shows you what you need to know
about maximizing your productivity while enjoying the process.
Even if you’re unemployed, yes, work hard in looking for a job, but also fill
your day with projects: Volunteer, clean your place, help a friend. You’ll find
work to be a great antidepressant . . . and it has no side effects.
Don’t Overvalue Money
Money helps. Indeed, most middle-class people are happier than poor
people. They can afford a safe place to live and decent wheels, and eating out
needn’t always involve the golden arches.
But a more upscale lifestyle — especially if you have to hold an unpleasant
job to afford it — is unlikely to yield more happiness. I’ve found as many
unhappy Jag-driving mansion owners as Toyota-driving cottage dwellers.
As you decide what work to do, ask yourself whether the lifestyle gain from
the extra income (after taxes) is worth it. Contentment more likely will come
from good work, relationships, and hobbies than from an expensive house,
new car, or vacation in Hawaii. Well, okay, maybe keep the nice Hawaii trip.
Prize Integrity
My mouse pad is imprinted with the statement, “Integrity is key.” Yes,
cheaters often win — in the material sense. Many, maybe even most decep-
tive salespeople, plagiarizing students, and cook-the-books accountants get
away with it, but they still lose. They lose in the bigger game of making their
lives meaningful. If you — especially when it’s to your detriment — do the
ethical thing, you’ll be loved and respected on this earth, and if there’s a
hereafter, honored in that one. And you can go through life with your head
high, knowing you’re making the world a better, not a worse, place.
358
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Become Beloved
You make yourself a beloved co-worker by practicing positive office politics:
looking for opportunities to brighten everyone’s day, even if it’s just to pick a
piece of lint off someone’s jacket. It shows you like them. Other examples:
 Be generous with earned compliments, stingy with criticism. Many
people crave praise more than money — feeling worthy is a primal need.
 Think twice before hurting a person’s self-esteem. Ask yourself: Do I
need to say that? If so, how can I say it so she feels okay?
 Bring in those to-die-for cookies — food is love. The wise employee
adds just a bit of such not-necessary activities. Too much looks unpro-
fessional; not enough makes you look too all-business.
Avoid Saboteurs
I’m no Pollyanna. I’m fully aware that you can practice positive politics ad
nauseam (as I discuss in the previous section), and still, someone may sabo-
tage you. These strategies can help:
 Keep your antennae out for saboteurs. They’re rare in some workplaces,
the norm in others. You’re especially at risk if you’re more capable than
other workers, are physically attractive, or have a personality that many
people find annoying.
 Tactfully confront your saboteur. If you have good evidence that you’re
being unfairly sandbagged — for example, important information is
being withheld from you — gently confront the person with a statement
such as, “Perhaps I’m wrong, but as I understand it, (insert your con-
cern). Is that true?” If the person denies it, as he usually will, say some-
thing like, “I’m glad, because I couldn’t tolerate that.” That approach
puts the person on notice without forcing an admission. If the person
admits it, ask why. If the explanation is unacceptable, say, “Can I count
on it stopping? If not, I’ll have to see the boss.” Then, poison his coffee.
(Yes, I am kidding.)
 Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. A good way to defuse
enmity is to invite your nemeses to work with you on a plum project, or
even invite them to a party. That gives you an opportunity to have them
bumped off. (Yes, I’m still joking.) Seriously, such invitations are a good
idea because most people want to be wanted. And when you’re together,
there will be chances to create connection.
359
Chapter 16: Top Ten (Or So) Career Musts for Everyone

Ask for What You Want
Most successful people ask for what they want. If they want to work for a
company, they try to get a meeting with one of its big shots. If they need
advice on whether to pursue a career, they e-mail one of the field’s gurus.
Successful people are also assertive on the job. The meek may inherit the
earth, but not today’s workplace. Winners know that politely asking for what
you want — advice, training, more responsibility, a revised job description —
is usually worth the risk.
Even winners get turned down a lot but realize that costs them nothing. They
just ask someone else, and someone else, and someone else, until they get a
yes — or until they realize the world is telling them, “Nope, not this time.”
Losers, in contrast, don’t act; they ruminate. For example:
 Losers worry they’ll sound stupid. Winners realize that with a bit of
rehearsal, they probably won’t sound stupid, and even if they do, there
usually are other people to ask.
 Losers worry about imposing. Winners realize that the imposition is just a
few seconds. If the person feels imposed on, she can simply say no. If she
agrees to help, that’s her choice — and indeed, many people enjoy help-
ing. Think about it: You’ve stopped a stranger to ask for directions. Asking
someone a career-related question is no bigger an imposition than that.
So, how do you move yourself from reluctant asker to enthusiastic one?
 Make a list of the benefits versus the liabilities of making the request.
Usually, you’ll find you have nothing to lose and much to gain.
 Rehearse. Script your pitch; then reduce it to a few guide words. Use
those words as you practice into a tape recorder. Role-play with a friend.
 Imagine the worst case. Could you survive?
Conquer Procrastination
I devote an entire chapter to overcoming procrastination (head to Chapter 12
for details), but it’s so crucial that I include it in this chapter too.
Procrastination really is a career killer. Don’t rationalize that you can get away
with it. You did in school, but you probably can’t at work, unless you’re willing
to settle for a perennially low-level job. After you decide not to procrastinate,
be aware of the moment of truth: the moment you — usually unconsciously —
decide, “I’m going to do that task later.” At that moment, ask yourself, “Would I
360
Part V: The Part of Tens 

be wiser to defer this task or do it now?” You’ll procrastinate less. Then break
the task down to baby steps and, when stuck, get help. Don’t know how to
break it into baby steps? Get help with that.
Control Your Anger
Anger is a career killer. You can be calm 98 percent of the time, but blow up
even rarely and you may be branded a hothead, which is career death. Even
if your anger is passive-aggressive, people will feel it and will you.
The problem is that some people go from zero to 60 in one second. If that’s
you, the nanosecond you feel anger rising in you, say: “Excuse me, I need to
use the bathroom.” In the privacy of that stall, amid the atmosphere of toilet
paper and toilet seat protectors, take some deep breaths and ask yourself,
“Will displaying anger serve me in the long run?” Rarely will you answer yes.
If you find yourself getting angry often, are you expecting too much from
people? Are you working in a workplace with too low-level people or with too
problemed clients? Is your anger covering your insecurity? You could change
jobs or go into therapy for years to figure it out, but I believe it’s first worth
trying a zero-tolerance anger policy: no anger ever. That’s better than giving
yourself discretion — by the time you’ve decided, you’ve exploded.
Get a Mentor; Be a Mentor
Most people grow up hoping that someone will take them under wing. Alas, it
rarely happens — unless you make it happen. When you meet a potential
mentor, ask for a bit of advice. If he’s forthcoming, be effusively thankful and
look to repay the favor. Later, ask for more advice. If the person provides it
and seems to enjoy the process, you have a budding mentor relationship.
And no need to limit yourself to one mentor; assemble a team.
You may think of mentors as older than you, but you may meet someone far
younger from whom you could learn. A younger person may particularly be
flattered by a request for advice.
Look, too, for opportunities to mentor others. Not only is that fair payback,
but you’ll grow as much from mentoring as from being mentored.
For more on mentoring, see Chapters 5 and 12.

Date Delicately
Fifty-eight percent of respondents to a Vault.com survey said they had been
in an office romance. With people spending ever-more time at work, that’s no
surprise. Alas, there are ever more minefields. The definition of sexual
harassment is broadening and employees are quicker to file grievances.
Here’s how to increase your chances of workplace dating without disaster:
 Don’t create false hopes. If you’re looking for a one-night stand, in your
seducing, don’t make noises about craving a long-term relationship.
 Unless company policy prohibits it, keep your relationship secret as
long as possible. Otherwise, co-workers will scrutinize the two of you
for any hint that you’re playing favorites.
 Stay professional. Try to treat your lover as you would any other
employee. No smoochy e-mails from the office — management can
snoop. And, of course, resist the temptation to dive into the supply
closet. These tips are easier said than done. For example, 28 percent of
respondents to the Vault.com survey admitted to an office tryst.
 Give each other space. If you’re together at and outside work, things
can get stifling. Allow time apart. Bonus: Maintaining outside interests
means that if you break up, you still have a life.
 Have fun! Despite these strictures, an office romance can be fun and
more. I speak from personal experience.
Always Look Forward
I learned the lesson to always look forward from my dad. I asked him, a
Holocaust survivor, why he never complained about having lost his teenage
years and his entire family. He replied, “The Nazis took five years from my
life. I won’t give them one minute more. Martin, never look back; always look
forward.”
Everyone has bad things happen to them, but my most successful clients
don’t wallow. They always ask themselves, “What’s the next positive little
step I can take?” I can offer you no better advice.
