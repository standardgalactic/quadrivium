Preface 
T h i s  book was intended for students who plan to study in the hu- 
manities and in the social and management sciences. Students in- 
terested in the physical and natural sciences, however, might also 
find its study rewarding. All that is presupposed is some high school 
algebra. The authors strongly urge that the topics be studied in the 
order in which they appear and that no topics be skipped. 
In recent years there has been considerable divergence of opinion 
among mathematics teachers as to the degree of abstraction, rigor, 
formality, and generality that is appropriate for elementary courses. 
We believe that the trend lately has been to go too far in these direc- 
tions. Quite naturally, this book reflects our views on this question. 
Although the subject matter is considered from a modern point of 
view, we have consciously tried to emulate the informal and lucid 
style of the better writers of a generation ago. Manipulative skills 
are cultivated slowly, and the progression from the concrete to the 
abstract is very gradual. 
We wish to extend our thanks to our typist Susan Schreck and to 
Matthew Marlin and Anne Park, who were students in a course from 
which this book evolved. We also wish to thank the editorial con- 
sultants of Barron's for their helpful suggestions.

Introduction 
L o g i c  is concerned with reasoning. Its central concern is to dis- 
tinguish good arguments from poor ones. One of the first persons to 
set down some rules of reasoning was Aristotle, the esteemed philoso- 
pher of ancient Greece. For almost two thousand years logic re- 
mained basically as Aristotle had left it. Students were required to 
memorize and recite his rules, and generally they accepted these rules 
on his authority. 
At the end of the eighteenth century Kant, one of the great philoso- 
phers of modern times, expressed the opinion that logic was a com- 
pleted subject. Just fifty years later, however, new insights and results 
on logic started to come forth as a result of the investigations of 
George Boole and others. In his work, Boole employed symbolism in 
a manner suggestive of the symbolic manipulations in algebra. Since 
then, logic and mathematics have interacted to the point that it no 
longer seems possible to draw a boundary line between the two. 
During the last forty years some deep and astounding results about 
logic have been discovered by the logician Kurt GBdel and others. 
Unfortunately, these results are too advanced to be presented in this 
book. We hope that what you learn here will stimulate you to study 
these exciting results later. 
Finally, we must tell you that complete agreement does not yet 
exist on the question of what constitutes correct reasoning. Even in 
mathematics, where logic plays a fundamental role, some thoughtful 
people disagree on the correctness of certain types of argumentation. 
Perhaps someday, someone will settle these disagreements once and 
for all.

Sentence Composition 
1.1 
The Basic Logical Operations 
Compound sentences are often formed from simpler sentences by 
means of the five basic logical operations. These operations and their 
symbols are: 
conjunction A 
disjunction 
v 
negation 
1 
implication -, 
bi-implication - 
The symbols are usually read as follows: 
I 
1 
II 
not 
I 
SYMBOL 
A 
I 
-, 
11 if ... then... 
I 
TRANSLATION 
and 
I - 
11 if and only if I 
Note that a good way to keep from confusing the symbols A and v is to 
remember that A looks like the first letter of the word "AND." 
If the letters A and B denote particular sentences, you can use the 
logical operations to form these compound sentences: 
A A B ,  read AandB 
A v B, read A or B 
i 
A, 
read it is not the case that A 
A -+ B, read if Athen B 
A -  B, read AifandonlyifB 

2 SENTENCE COMPOSITION 
Examples. 
Let A be the sentence: "Snow is white." 
Let B be the sentence: "Grass is green." 
Then A A B is the sentence: "Snow is white and grass is 
green." 
Let A be the sentence: "Humpty Dumpty is an egg." 
Then 1 A is the sentence: "It is not the case that 
Humpty Dumpty is an egg." 
Let A be: 
"Jack is a boy." 
Let B be: 
"Jill is a girl." 
Then A -+ B is: "If Jack is a boy, then Jill is a girl." 
Let A be: "Birds By." 
Let B be: 
"Bees sting." 
Let C be: 
"Bells ring." 
Then -I A -, (B v C) is: "If it is not the case that birds 
fly, then bees sting or bells ring." 
Note that in the last example, the "not" sign applies only to the sen- 
tence A. If we had wanted to negate the entire sentence A -+ (B v C), 
we would have enclosed it in parentheses and written 1 [A - 
(B v C)]. 
Then it would read, "It is not the case that if birds fly, then bees sting 
or bells ring." 
A property of declarative sentences is that they are true or false, but 
not both. If a sentence is true, it has truth value t. If it is false, it has 
truth value f. You can compute the truth value of a compound sentence 
built from simpler sentences and logical operations if you know the 
truth values of the simpler sentences. This can be done by means of 
tables. The table for the conjunction operation is given below. Here is 
how to read it. On a given row, the extreme right-hand entry shows 
the truth value that the compound sentence A A B should have if the 
sentences A and B have the truth values entered for them in that row. 

1.2 TRUTH VALUES 3 
TABLE FOR A ("AND") 
Examples. 
Use the table just given to find the truth values of these 
compound sentences: 
a )  Giants are small and New York is large. 
b) New York is large and giants are small. 
c) America is large and Russia is large. 
ANSWERS: 
a )  First label each part of the sentence with its own 
truth value. 
f 
t 
T_-A----7 & 
[Glants are small] A [New York is large]. 
Now look in the table to see which row has the values 
f, t (in that order) entered in the two left-hand col- 
umns. This turns out to be the third row (below the 
headings). Looking to the extreme right of that row, 
you will find that the entire sentence has the truth 
value f. 
b) Labeling each part with its truth value, we get 
Now look in the table to see which row has the values 
t, f (in that order) entered in the two left-hand col- 
umns. This turns out to be the second row. Looking 
to the extreme right of that row, you will find that 
the entire sentence has the truth value f. 

4 SENTENCE COMPOSITION 
C) First label the parts: 
t 
A 
[America is largJ A [Russ~a 1s large]. 
The first row of the table indicates that the entire 
sentence has the truth value t. 
We make the tables for the other four logical operations in a similar 
way: 
TABLE FOR 
TABLE FOR 
v ( 4 6 0 ~ )  
-I ("NOT") 
TABLE FOR -, 
TABLE FOR - 
("IF . . . THEN . . .") 
("IF AND ONLY IF ") 
According to the table for v, the disjunction A v B is a true sen- 
tence if A is true, if B is true, or if both A and B are true. Unfor- 
tunately, in ordinary conversation people do not always use "or" this 
way. However, in mathematics and science (and in this book), the 
sentence A v B is considered true even in the case where A and B are 
both true. 
The implication operation presents a similar problem. Quite often 
"if A, then B" indicates a cause-and-effect relationship as in the sen- 
tence: 
If it rains, thegame will have to bepostponed. 
Mathematicians and scientists, however, do not require such a cause- 
and-effect relationship in affirming the truth of A - B, and our 

1.2 TRUTH VALUES 5 
table has been set up in accordance with their time-honored conven- 
tions. 
Examples. 
Use the tabbs just given to compute the truth values of 
the follo&g sentences: 
a ) A W  equals six, then three equals three. 
b) (5 = 7) v (6 = 8). 
c) It is not the case that three equals three. 
d) [(2 = 4) v (3 = 3)] - [(5 = 0) A (6 = I)]. 
ANSWERS: 
First label the parts with their truth values: 
f 
t - 
& 
a) [two equals six] + [three equals three] 
The third row of the table for + shows that the 
entire sentence gets the truth value t. 
The fourth row of the table for v shows that the en- 
tire sentence gets the truth value f. 
i 
[ihree equals three] 
The first row of the table for 1 shows that the en- 
tire sentence gets the truth value f. 
d) This one will involve the use of three tables because 
it contains three logical operation symbols. 
First label the elementary parts: 
From the third row of the table for v you can see 
that the part to the left of the arrow gets the truth 
value t. From the fourth row of the table for A ,  you 

6 SENTENCE COMPOSITION 
can see that the part to the right of the arrow gets 
the truth value f. Now labeling the parts to the left 
and right of the arrow with the truth values just com- 
puted for them, you have 
f 
\ 
From the second row of the table for + you can 
see that the entire sentence should have the truth 
value f.

onverses and Contrapositives 
Suppose you are given an implication A + B. Two related implica- 
tions are given special names. 
B -+ A is called the converse of A + B. 
. - 
1 B 4 i 
A is called the contrapositive of A + B. 
The truth value of an implication and its converse may or may not 
agree. Below are given some examples to show this. Later you will see 
that an implication and its contrapositive always have the same truth 
value.

Examples. 
Let A be: 
1 = 2 
Let B be: 
2 is an even number. 
Then A -, B has truth value t, while its converse B + A 
has truth value f. 
Let E be: 2 is an even number. ' 
Let 0 be: 
3 is an odd number. 
Then E -, 0 has truth value t, and its converse 0 - E 
also has truth value t.

and in English. 
(a) If Ollie is a dragon, then Ollie roars. 
(b) If Ollie is toothless, then Ollie does not roar. 
(c) Ollie roars only if Ollie is a dragon. 
2. Let A and B be two sentences. If A has truth value t, which truth 
value must B have to insure that: 
(a) A - B has truth value t? 
(b) the contrapositive of A - B has truth value t? 
(c) the converse of A -. B has truth value t? 
3. Give examples of implications that have truth value t such that: 
(a) the converse has truth value t. 
(b) the converse has truth value f. 
1.5 
Logic Forms and Truth Tables 
Logical symbolism enables us to see at a glance how compound sen- 
tences are built from simpler sentences. Meaningful expressions built 
from variable symbols, logical operation symbols, and parentheses 
are called logic forms. Capital letters like A, B, C . . . can be used as 

10 SENTENCE COMPOSITION 
the variable,symbols in constructing logic forms. The following are 
examples of logic forms: 
A - B  
B 
A v C  
( i A - B ) - . B  
Note that a single variable symbol is acceptable as a logic form. 
Logic forms will often be discussed. When talkingabout logic forms, 
heavy-type capital leters like A, B, C (with or without numerical sub- 
scripts) will be used to denote them. Thus in a given discussion, you 
might use the symbol B to denote the logic form 
Remember: 
1 .  Heavy type capital letters, like A, denote entire logic forms. 
2. Regular capital letters, like A, are variable symbols which appear 
in a logic form. 
You have already seen that the truth value of a logic form is deter- 
mined by the truth values assigned to its variable symbols. Let A and 
B be variable symbols. A preceding section contained tables listing the 
values assigned to each of the logic forms: 
i A  A v B  
A A B  A - B  
A u B  
for given truth values of A and B. The tables are examples of truth 
tables. Using these five tables, you can construct the truth table of 
any logic form. As an example, consider the truth table of the logic 
form 
(A v C) -, (B -+ A). 
In each row give an assignment of truth values to the variable symbols 
A, B, and C, and at the right-hand end of the row list the value of the 
entire logic form for that assignment. The optional columns headed 
"A v C" and "B -, A" are included to help fill in the table. If you 
feel sufficiently confident, you can omit such intermediate columns 
when building future truth tables.

optional columns 
We suggest that you first fill in the columns under the variable 
symbols A, B, C . . . and then complete these columns one at a time. 
Below are repeated the first three columns of the preceding table. 
Note that the places in the columns which have t as entries are shaded, 
and observe that there is a pattern to this shading. By following the 
pattern you can be sure that a logic form with n distinct variable 
symbols will have a truth table with 2" rows and that these rows dis- 
play aN the possible ways of assigning truth values to the variable 
symbols. Note that the top half of the left-hand column consists only 
o f t  entries, the bottom half of f entries. In the next column blocks 
oft entries and blocks of f entries are alternated; each block consists 
of 114 the total number of rows in the table. In the third column, each 
block makes up 118 of the total number of rows, etc.

have truth value t. Examine these rows closely.] 
1.6 
Tautologies, Contradictions, 
and Contingencies 
Certain logic forms have truth tables in which the right-hand column 
consists solely of t's. These forms are called tautologies. Hence a 
tautology is a logic form which has truth value t no matter what 
values are given to its variable symbols. If the right hand column of 
the truth table of a logic form consists solely off's, the logic form is 
called a contradiction. Thus a contradiction has truth value f no mat- 
ter what values are given to its variable symbols. If a logic form is not 
a tautology and not a contradiction, it is called a contingency. 
Example 1. 
Tautology: 
A v 1 A 
Contradiction: A A i 
A 
Contingency: 
A -+ B 
Notice that if the variable symbols of a tautology are replaced by 
sentences, the compound sentence is always true. 
Example 2. You have already observed that A v i 
A is a tautology. 
Thus the sentence: 
A 
1 A 
A 
'it is raininiorct is not raining\ 
is a true sentence. 
The truth of the sentence in this example does not 
depend on any facts from meteorology. It is true by 

1.7 SENTENTIAL INCONSISTENCY IS 
virtue of the way it is built up from its parts by means 
of the logical operations. In other words, it is true by 
virtue of its form. Logicians call a sentence like this 
one a substitutive instance of a tautology.

Sentential Inconsistency 
Let A , ,  A,. . . A, be a collection of logic forms. These logic forms are 
said to be sententially inconsistent if their conjunction is a contradic- 
tion. Otherwise, they are said to be sententially consistent. 
To test a collection of logic forms A,, A,. . . A, for sentential inconsis- 
tency, you have only to form their conjunction A, A A, A -. 
A A,, 
make a truth table for this conjunction, and look to see whether the 
right-hand column of the table has all f's. If this is so, then they are 
sententially inconsistent. If there is at least one t, then they are sen- 
tentially consistent. 
If, after symbolizing a collection of sentences, you find that the re- 
sulting collection of logic forms is sententially inconsistent, then you 
would know that these sentences are built from their elementary sen- 
tences in such a way that it is impossible for all of them to be true.

2. Symbolize the following sentences and test the resulting logic forms 
for sentential inconsistency. 
(a) Either a recession will occur or, if unemployment does not de- 
crease, wage controls will be imposed. If a recession does not oc- 
cur, unemployment will decrease. If wage controls are imposed, 
unemployment will not decrease. 
(b) If imports increase or exports decrease, either tariffs are im- 
posed or devaluation occurs. Tariffs are imposed when and only 
when imports increase and devaluation does not occur. If exports 
decrease, then tariffs are not imposed or imports do not increase. 
Either devaluation does not occur, or tariffs are imposed and ex- 
ports decrease. 
3. After discovering his immense popularity with the American 
people, Bagel the beagle decided to run for president. He called to- 
gether his top political advisors for a brainstorming session. Out of 
this session came the following advice: 
Owl: 
Beagles can't be president, or the country will go to the dogs. 
Fox: If a beagle can be president, the country won't go to the dogs. 
Bear: Either a beagle can be president, or the country will go the 
dogs. 
Cai: It's not the case that (the country will go to the dogs and a 
beagle can't be president). 
Since Bagel's confidence in his advisors was a shade less than ab- 
solute, he decided to run a sentential consistency test. What did it re- 
veal?

Constructing Logic Forms from 
Truth Tables 
You know that for each logic form a truth table can be made. In this 
section you will learn how to reverse the procedure. Here we have a 
truth table for an unknown logic form with n given variable symbols. 
The problem will be to construct a logic form having this given table 
for its truth table. 
Given the truth table, the following procedure is employed to con- 
struct the desired logic form. 
1. For each row whose right hand entry is t, make a check markd 
to the right of that row. 

1.8 CONSTRUCTING LOGIC FORMS FROM TRUTH TABLES 
17 
2. To the right of each check mark */ write a sequence of n terms 
(one corresponding to each variable symbol) as follows: if in that 
row a variable symbol has the value t entered for it, then the cor- 
responding term is to be that variable symbol itself; if the variable 
symbol has the value f entered for it, then the corresponding term is 
to be the negation of that variable symbol. 
3. To the right of each sequence of terms which you made in step 2, 
write the conjunction of those terms. 
4. Beneath the table, form the disjunction of all the conjunctions 
which you made in step 3. 
The disjunction formed in step 4 will be the desired answer. 
Example. 
Construct a logic form having the following truth table.

Step 2

Step 3 

18 SENTENCE COMPOSITION 
The result of Step 4 is the desired logic form. To check 
your work, make the truth table for the logic form just 
constructed. 
Comparing this table with the table you were given, you 
can see that they coincide. Hence 
( A A B A ~  
C ) v ( A A l  B A C ) Y ( T A  A ~ B A C )  
is a correct answer. 
Probably you have noticed that this method doesn't mention what 
to do in case the right-hand column of the given table only has f's. 
This case is even easier; just make a contradiction of the form 
(X A 7 X) for each variable symbol X, and then take the disjunction of 
these contradictions. 
Exercises 1.8 
1. Using the procedure outlined in this section, find a logic form for 
each of the following truth tables:

'3. The people who live on the banks of the Ooga River always tell 
the truth or always tell lies, and they respond to questions only with a

leads to the top of a mile high waterfall and the other branch leads to 
a settlement. Of course there is no sign telling which branch leads to 
the settlement, but there is a native, Mr. Blanco, standing on the

shore. What yes-or-no question should the explorer ask Mr. Blanco to 
determine which branch leads to the settlement? 
[Hint: Let A stand for "Mr. Blanco tells the truth," and let B stand 
for "The left-hand branch leads to the settlement." Construct, by 
means of a suitable truth table, a logic form involving A and B such 
that Blanco's answer to the question will be "yes" (i.e., true) if and 
only if B is true.] 

Algebra of Logic 
Let A and B be logic forms. A and B are logically equivalent if and 
only if the logic form A - 
B is a tautology. If A is logically equivalent 
to B, it is indicated by writing A = B. 
Suppose A i 
B. Then if all the variable symbols appearing in 
A or B are listed, the assignments of truth values to these symbols 
which make A true will be precisely those which make B true. 
Example I. 
Prove: (A -. B) = 1 (A A 1 B) 
ANSWER: 
TO do this, construct the truth table of the logic form 
(A + B) - 1 (A A 1 B) 
which, for brevity, will be denoted by E. 
From the truth table you can see that E is a tautology. 
Hence: 
A - - B = ~ ( A A ~ B )  
Example 2. 
Prove: A -+ (B -+ A) 
C v -I C 
ANSWER: 
Construct the truth table for the logic form 
[A -, (B -. A)] - (C v -I C) 
which is denoted by E.

By inspecting the truth table for E, you can conclude:

The second example shows that the tautologies A -, (B -+ A) and 
C v i 
C are logically equivalent. Actually it is true that all tautologies 
are logically equivalent, and all contradictions are logically equiva- 
lent.

the logic form

[Hint: Make the truth table for A -+ (B -. C). Then use the pro=-

the logic form so obtained is logically equivalent to A - (B -+ C).] 

2.2 BASIC EQUIVALENCES 23 
Basic Equivalences 
Here is a list of twenty basic equivalences which will be used repeatedly 
throughout this book. You should familiarize yourself with all of the 
equivalences listed. They can be easily verified by the truth table 
technique which you used earlier to check for logical equivalency. 
(In fact, you already verified a couple of them in previous exercises.) 
The symbol T is used to denote the particular tautology A v  1 A, 
and the symbol F is used to denote the particular contradiction

24 ALGEBRA OF LOGIC 
We close this section with a few observations. In Chapter 1 we 
introduced the concept of "contrapositive" of an implication. Basic 
equivalence 19 asserts that an implication is logically equivalent to its 
contrapositive. 
From your basic algebra course you may be familiar with the 
commutative, associative, and distributive laws. In contrast to the 
situation in ordinary algebra, there are two distributive laws here. 
Note that one of these may be obtained from the other by interchang- 
ing the A and v symbols. In ordinary algebra this doesn't work. If you 
interchange the + and . symbols in the distributive law 
a.(b + c) = (a-b) + (a-c) 
you get 
which is false in ordinary algebra. (Note, for example, that it fails 
when a, b, c, each have the value 1 .) 
2.3 
Algebraic Manipulation 
In this section you will learn another method for proving that two 
logic forms are logically equivalent. For this procedure you need the 
following two rules. 
I. Replacement rule. If part of a logic form A is replaced at one or 
more occurrences by a logically equivalent form, then the result is 
logically equivalent to the original form A. 
11. Transitivity rule. If A, B, and C are logic forms such that 
A = BandB = C,thenA s C. 
The technique used to show logical equivalency here resembles the 
process used in algebra to ;how that two algebraic expressions are 
equal. Starting with one of the logic forms and making successive 
applications of the replacement rule and the basic equivalences of 
the preceding section you convert it into the other logic form. Then, 

Since you started with the left side of the equivalence in 
qtlestion and ended with the right side, you can conclude 
by the transitivity rule that the equivalence holds. 
2.3 ALGEBRAIC MANIPULATION 25 
by using the transitivity rule, you can conclude that the two logi_c 
forms are logically equivalent. 
Here are a few examples to show the algebraic manipulation of 
logic forms. Study these examples carefully before attempting the ex- 
ercises which follow. 
Example 1. 
Prove: 
A A (B v -I A) 
A A B 
PROOF: 
Start with the left side and, in a series of steps (listed 
vertically), manipulate your way to the right side: 
A A ( B v  1 A) 
distributive law 
(A A B) v (A A 1 A) 
definition of F 
(A A B) v F 
identity law 
A A B  
Since you went from the left side to the right side in steps 
which leave each line logically equivalent to the one pre- 
ceding it, you can conclude by the transitivity rule that 
the desired equivalence holds.

(b) No widow must pay taxes unless she has earned $1000 during 
the past twelve months. 
(c) Anyone over 18 years of age who has not earned $1000 during 
the past twelve months does not pay any taxes. 
Find a simpler form for these rules.

2.4 CONJUNCTIVE NORMAL FORM 
29 
2.4 
Conjunctive Normal Form 
Logic form A is a conjunctive normal form if it satisfies one of the fol- 
lowing conditions: 
i) A is a variable symbol. 
ii) A is the negation of a variable symbol. 
iii) A is a disjunction of two or more terms, each of which is either a 
variable symbol or the negation of a variable symbol. 
iv) A is a conjunction of two or more terms, each of which is one of 
the three types listed above. 
It is very important to be able to recognize a conjunctive normal form. 
Example 1. 
The following logic forms are conjunctive forms: 
A 
(satisfies condition i) 
1 B 
(satisfies condition ii) 
T C v B v A  
(satisfies condition iii) 
( 7 C v B v A) A A A 1 B 
(satisfies condition iv) 
( i 
A v B) A (C v A) A (B v C) (satisfies condition iv) 
The following logic forms are not conjunctive normal 
forms: 
A + B  
( A A  B)v i C  
( A v B ) r r ( i B 4 A )  
7 (A * B) 
To help fix the idea in your mind, think of a conjunctive normal 
\ 
form as a logic form which looks like 
where the heavy-type letters denote logic forms no more complicated 
than single variable symbols or negations of variable symbols. We 
are allowing as special cases of this, the case where only one of the 
bracketed expressions actually appears, and the case where some of 
the bracketed expressions have only one term. The bracketed expres- 
sions between the conjunction symbols are called the cwjunets of 

38 ALGEBRA OF LOGIC 
the normal form. If the conjunctive normal form has no conjunction 
symbols, the entire expression is thought of as a single conjunct. Thus, 
A v B v -I C has only one conjunct, namely the expression 
A v B vlC. 
Exercises 2.4 
1. Determine which (if any) of the following logic forms are conjunc- 
tive normal forms.

2.5 
Reduction to Conjunctive Normal Form 
By using algebraic manipulations it is possible to reduce any logic 
form to an equivalent conjunctive normal form. 
Example. 
Find a conjunctive normal form logically equivalent to: 
ANSWER: 
(A A B) V (B A 1 C)

[(A A B) v B] A [(A A B) v 1 C]

associative law 
( A v B )  A ( B v B ) A ( A A  1 C ) A ( B V  1 C )  

2.5 REDUCTION TO CONJUNCTIVE NORMAL FORM 
31 
The last line is, as desired, a conjunctive normal form. 
It is not the simplest answer, but for the intended ap- 
plications of conjunctive normal form, this will not 
matter. 
Note that a logic form might be manipulated into a conjunctive 
normal form in various ways, and the answer might come out in 
various ways. All answers, of course, would be logically equivalent. 
Now it turns out that in reducing to a conjunctive normal form you 
need to use just one of the two distributive laws learned in Section 2.2. 
If you now switch to an "arithmetical notation" and write 
A + B instead of A A B 
AB instead of A v B 
then you see that of the two distributive laws, the one you need ap- 
pears in the new notation as 
A(B + C) = AB + AC. 
The other distributive law would look rather strange and unfamiliar 
in arithmetical notation. It would appear as 
A + (BC) = (A + BXA + C). 
You are probably so accustomed to working with ordinary numbers 
where this second distributive law fails, that we might have confused 
you if we had introduced and used arithematical notation earlier in 
the book. Fortunately, for reduction to conjunctive normal form you 
do not need to make use of this "funny looking" distributive law. So 
perhaps in reducing to conjunctive normal form, it might be more con- 
venient to use arithmetical notation. For one thing, your expressions 
will take up less space. For another, repeated application of the dis- 
tributive law to complicated expressions can be handled just as though 
you were "multiplying out" an expression of ordinary algebra. 
A further space saving device would be to write 
A' instead of 1 A. 

32 ALGEBRA OF LOGIC 
De Morgan's laws would then appear as 
(A + B)' = A'B' 
(AB)' = A' + B' 
Of course, for uncomplicated expressions you may prefer not to use 
the new arithmetical notation at all. It is entirely optional. 
A good way to reduce to a conjunctive normal form is to perform 
the following four steps: 
1. Use the arrow laws to remove all -. and -. 
2. Use de Morgan's laws repeatedly until the only negated terms are 
variable symbols. 
3. Switch to arithmetical notation. 
4. Multiply out (as in ordinary algebra). 
Naturally, if you get a chance to simplify things along the way by 
using the absorption, idempotent, domination, or identity laws, so 
much the better. 
Example.

associative and commutative laws

CAD + CB'D + CAE + CB'E 
The last line is the desired conjunctive normal form.

2.6 
Uses of Conjunctive Normal Form 
If a logic form A is a conjunctive normal form, there is a way of tell- 
ing at a glance whether or not it is a tautology. Just apply the follow- 
ing rule: 
A conjunctive normal form is a tautology if and only 
if in each conjunct there appears some variable symbol 
and its negation. 
In applying the above rule, do not forget that if no conjunction 
symbols actually appear in the conjunctive normal form, the entire 
normal form is thought of as a single conjunct. 
/- 
Example 1. 
(A v B v i A) A (C v D v E v i D) is a tautology be- 
cause of the appearance of A, 1 A in the left conjunct 
and D, 1 D in the right conjunct. 
( A v B v  1 A ) A ( C V  1 B v D ) A ( E v  1 E) is not a 
tautology because the middle conjunct fails to have 
some variable symbol and its negation. 

34 ALGEBRA OF LOGIC 
A v B v D v 1 B is a tautology because of the ap- 
pearance of B, 1 B. 
A v B v i 
C is not a tautology. Its only conjunct (the 
whole expression itself) fails to have some variable 
symbol and its negation. 
Here is how to test any logic form A for tautology (regardless of 
whether A is a conjunctive normal form or not). First reduce A to a 
conjunctive normal form. Then you can see at a glance whether the 
normal form (and hence A) is a tautology. 
Example 2. 
Is the following logic form a tautology? 
A + (B -, A) 
ANSWER: 
Reduce to a conjunctive normal form 
A+(B--A) 
E 1 A v(B-+A) 
l A v ( 1 B v A )  
= 1 A v l B v A  
Now 1 A v 1 B v A is a conjunctive normal form, 
and it is evident by inspection that it is a tautology. 
Consequently, so is A + (B -. A). 
Example 3. 
Is the following logic form a tautology? 
ANSWER: 
Reduce to a conjunctive normal form 
(A-B)-+A 
= i(i 
A v B ) v A  
= ( f l A ~ l B ) v A  
= ( 1 1  A v A ) A ( ~ B v A )  
= ( A v A ) h ( l  B v A )  
= A r r ( 1 B v A )  
Now A A ( 1 B v A) is a conjunctive normal form. By 
inspection it is evident that it is not a tautology, so 
neither is (A -+ B) -+ A. 

2.7 DISJUNCTIVE NORMAL FORM 35 
In both examples a truth table could have been used just as easily 
to settle the question. For expressions with three or more distinct 
letters, making a table can be tedious, and the method of conjunctive 
normal forms is preferable. 
Using a conjunctive normal form to test for tautologies also gives 
additional information. If the test shows that a logic form is not a 
tautology, the conjunctive normal form helps to find an assignment of 
truth values to the variable symbols, which makes the original logic 
form have truth value f. A11 that has to be done is to locate a conjunct 
which fails to have both a variable symbol and its negation. Then 
assign values to the variables so as to make that conjunct false. 
Exercises 2.6 
1. Test the following to see if they are tautologies using the method 
of conjunctive normal form. For each logic form which is not a tau- 
tology, use the conjunctive normal form to find an assignment of

A logic form A is a disjunctive lorarrl form if its satisfies one of the 
following conditions: 
i) A is a variable symbol. 
ii) A is the negation of a variable symbol. 
iii) A is a conjunction of two or more terms each of which is a variable 
symbol or the negation of a variable symbol, 
iv) A is a disjunction of two or more tirms each of which is one of the 
three types described above. 

36 ALGEBRA OF LOGIC 
Example 1. 
The following logic forms are disjunctive normal 
forms: 
A  
1 B v C  
A A B  A ~ C A D  
( l B ~ c ) v ( A ~ D ) v l  
E 
The following logic forms are not disjunctive nor- 
mal forms: 
A - B  
( ~ B v C ) A A  
(A A C) v  (A -+ B) 
Note that some logic forms, for example the form 1 A, can be 
both a conjunctive normal form and a disjunctive normal form. 
A  disjunctive normal form looks just like a conjunctive normal 
form except that the roles of the symbols A and v are reversed. Thus 
is a conjunctive form, while 
(AA 1 B ) V D  
is a disjunctive normal form. 
Every logic form A can be reduced to a logic form which is a dis- 
junctive normal form logically equivalent to A. 
Example 2. 
Find a disjunctive normal form which is logically equiv- 
alent to: 
(A + B) + C  
ANSWER:

arrow law 
i 
(A- 
B) v C

The last line is, as desired, a disjunctive normal form.

Example 3. 
Find a disjunctive normal form which is logically equiv- 
alent to: 
ANSWER: 
A A (B V C) 
(A A B) V (A A C) 
The right-hand side is the answer. 
Now it turns out that in reducing to disjunctive normal form you 
need to use only one of the two distributive laws. In fact, it's the one 
you did not need for reducing to conjunctive normal form. Recall that 
in switching to arithmetical notation this distributive law looked un- 
familiar. You can avoid dealing with a "funny looking" representa- 
tion of this distributive law by reversing the role of the + symbol. 
This time write 
A + B  for 
A v B  
AB 
for 
A A B 
Again the distributive law that you do need is 
A(B + C) = AB + AC. 
Any logic form can be reduced to a disjunctive normal form by the 
following steps: 
1. Eliminate arrows. 
2. Repeat the use of de Morgan's laws until negation symbols appear 
only in front of variable symbols. 
3. Switch to arithmetical notation. 
4. Multiply out (like in ordinary algebra). 
In order to help you remember that it is the "or" symbol which 
should correspond to + in reducing to a disjunctive normal form, 
think of the word DOPE whose first three letters come from 
Disjunctive (normal form) Or Plus. 
Recall that for conjunctive normal form the key word was CAP. Of 
course, if the logic form in question isn't very complicated, you may 
prefer not to use arithmetical notation.

The last line is a disjunctive normal form.

Uses of Disjunctive Normal Form 
If a logic form is a disjunctive normal form, there is a way of telling 
by inspection whether or not it is a contradiction. Just apply the fol- 
lowing rule: 

2.8 USES OF DISJUNCTIVE NORMAL FORM 39 
A disjunctive normal form is a contradiction if and 
only if in each disjunct there appears some variable 
symbol and its negation. 
Example 1. 
D A 1 D is a contradiction. 
(A A B) v  (A A C) is not a contradiction. 
B  is not a contradiction. 
(A A 1 A) v (A A C) is not a contradiction. 
(A A 7 A  A B) is a contradiction. 
(A A 1 A) v  (B A C  A 1 B) is a contradiction. 
To test an arbitrary logic form to see if it is a contradiction, reduce 
it to a disjunctive normal form, and then check the normal form by in- 
spection. 
Example2. 
Use reduction to a disjunctive normal form to tell 
whether the following logic form is a contradiction. 
(A -. 1 B) A (A A B) 
ANSWER: 
( A - + ~ B ) A ( A A B ) E ( ~ A V ~  
B)A(AAB) 
= ( ~ A A A A B ) v ( ~ B A A A B )  
Each disjunct has some letter and its negation. Therefore, the origi- 
nal logic form is a contradiction. 
Even if reduction to a disjunctive normal form reveals that a logic 
form A is not a contradiction, some useful knowledge can be obtained. 
You can use the disjunctive normal form to determine an assignment 
of truth values to the variable symbols in A which gives A truth value 
t. All you have to do is locate a disjunct which fails to have a variable 
symbol and its negation. Then assign values to the variables so as to 
make that disjunct true. 
Exercises 2.8 
1. Reduce each of the following logic forms to a disjunctive normal 
form and determine whether it is a contradiction. If it is not a contra- 
diction, use the disjunctive normal form to find an assignmint of

form true.

(c)

(d)

2. Use reduction to a conjunctive normal form and to a disjunctive 
normal form to determine which of the following logic forms are tau- 
tologies, which are contradictions, and which are contingencies. 
(a)

C) v (C + A) 
(b) 
[(A + B) + C] -, [(C + A) + (D + A)] 
(c) 
(A+B)+[(B-,C)+(A-+C)] 
(d) 
[(A A C) v (B A 1 C)] ++ [ ( l  A A C) v ( 1  B A 7 C)] 
3. Check the following set of assumptions for sentential consistency. 
If the XYZ company builds a new factory or some of its machinery 
must be replaced, either the company can obtain a loan or it will be 
threatened with bankruptcy. The company can obtain a loan if and 
only if it builds a new factory and no machinery must be replaced. 
If machinery must be replaced, then the company cannot obtain a 
loan or it does not build a new factory. Either the company will be 
threatened with bankruptcy, or some of its machiner must be re- 
placed and the company can obtain a loan. 
[Hint: Symbolize the sentences, take the conjunction and reduce to 
a disjunctive normal form. See if it is a contradiction.] 
2.9 
Interdependence of the Basic 
Logical Operations 
Previously you were introduced to the five basic logical operations: 
A 
v 
1 
+ .-. 

2.9 INTERPENDENCE OF LOGICAL OPERATIONS 41 
The double arrow law mentioned earlier in this chapter shows how to 
express the operation - 
in terms of the operations -. and A: 
A - B  = (A4B)A(B-.A) 
It follows that any logic form with occurrences of - can be con- 
verted to a logic form having no occurrences of - by replacing the 
left side of the above equivalence with the right side. This shows that 
you can get along with just the remaining four logical operations. 
Furthermore, the arrow law and de Morgan's law can be used to ex- 
press-. and A in terms of v and 1 : 
A - B = 1  
A V B  
Hence, given any logic form A, you can eliminate all occurrences 
of -, -+, and A in favor of v and 1 , and the new logic form would be 
logically equivalency to A. 
The above discussion shows that of the five basic operations avail- 
able, it is possible to get along with just two of them, namely v  and 1 . 
Example. 
Find a logic form logically equivalent to the one below, 
but which uses only the connectives v  and i 
: 
ANSWER: 
A  ++ B  a (A --* B) A (B -+ A) 
-- ( ~ A v B ) A ( ~ B v A )  
P [ ( ~ A v B ) A  
l B ] v [ ( i A v B ) ~ A l  
-= (i 
A A  7  B) ~ ( B A  
i 
B) 
v [ ( l  A  A A) V ( B A  A)] 
= ( - ~ A A  
T B ) v ( B A A )  
i ( A v B ) v  i ( i A v  i B ) .  
The example above shows one reason why we did not merely in- 
troduce the two logical operations v  and i at the beginning of the 
book and do all subsequent work using just these two operations. 
Many short logic forms, for example A - B, would be expressed by 
long unwieldy ones. Thus, even though it is possible to manage in 
principle with just two operations, it is convenient to have all five 
of them available. 

ALGEBRA OF LOGIC 
There is a new logical operation in terms of which each of the five 
basic operations can be expressed. It is called the Sbeffer stroke, and it 
is denoted by a vertical stoke I . Its truth table is: 
Since the truth table of A 1 B is the same as the truth table of 
i 
(A A B), we have 
AlB =l(A A B). 
You have already seen that any logic form can be expressed using 
o n l y  the operations v and 1. Thus, to conclude that all the basic logi- 
cal operations can be expressed in terms of the Sheffer stroke alone, 
you need only show that v and 1 can each be expressed in terms of I . 
Y o u  can see that 7 A may be so expressed by observing that: 
T h a t  A v B can be expressed in terms of the Sheffer stroke follows 
f r o m  : 
A v B = 7 [T (A v B)] 
The conclusion to be drawn from this section is that every logic 
f o r m  can be expressed by an equivalent one whose sole operation 
symbol is the Sheffer stroke. Our interest in this result is only theoreti- 
cal, not practical.

Analysis of Inferences 
3.1 
Sentential Validity 
You have probably met the following types of argument before. The 
first example constitutes good reasoning, while the second one does 
not. 
Example 1. 
If grass is green, snow is white. 
Grass is green. 
Therefore, snow is white. 
Example 2. 
If x and y are even numbers, x + y is even. 
x + y iseven. 
Therefore, x and y are even numbers. 
Each of these examples is called an inference or an instance of an in- 
ference pattern. An inference pattern is a finite list of logic forms pre- 
sented as follows: 
The logic forms above the bar are called premises while B is called 
the conclnsion. (The symbol :. is read "therefore.") 
An inference pattern is sententidly valid if and only if 
(conjunction of the premises) -. conclusion 
is a tautology. An inference is called sententially valid if its inference 
pattern is sententially valid. 

46 ANALYSIS OF INFERENCES 
Example 3. 
Consider the inference: 
If grass is green, snow is white. 
Grass is green. 
Therefore, snow is white. 
To check it for sentential validity, first symbolize. 
G: Grass is green 
S: Snow is white. 
The inference pattern is 
Since 
[(G -. S) A G] -. S 
is a tautology (verify that yourself), the inference is 
sententially valid. 
The sentential validity of an inference depends solely on the way in 
which the premises and conclusion are built from their basic sentences 
by means of the logical operations. You should convince yourself 
that if you substitute sentences for the variable symbols in a sen- 
tentially valid inference pattern, and if by doing so you get premises 
which are true statements, then the conclusion will also be a true 
statement. Thus an inference which is sententially valid constitutes 
good reasoning. 
Example 4. 
You observed above that 
is a sententially valid inference pattern. An inference 
which is an instance of this pattern is: 

3.1 SENTENTIAL VALlDITY 47 
If cars sing, dogs whistle. 
Cars sing. 
Therefore, dogs whistle. 
This inference, then, is a sententially valid inference. 
The preceding example vividly demonstrates that it is only the form 
of the inference that determines whether or not it is valid. The fact 
that the premises and the conclusion are unrealistic has no bearing 
on the matter. 
Study the following important example. 
Example 5. 
All countries have armies. 
France is a country. 
Therefore, France has an army. 
Let A be: All countries have armies. 
Let B be: 
France is a country. 
Let C be. France has an army. 
The inference pattern corresponding to the above in- 
ference is: 
It is easy to see that the logic form 
is not a tautology. Thus the inference is nor sententially 
valid. On the other hand, any reasonable person 
would probably agree that the inference's conclusion 
really does follow from its premises. The reason that a 
sentential validity test doesn't help to recognize that 
this inference constitutes correct reasoning is that its 
correctness is somehow related to the way in which 
the premises and conclusion are built from their re- 

48 
ANALYSIS OF INFERENCES 
spective subjects and predicates. B and C have the 
same subject while A  and C have the same predicate. 
Our symbolic resources are not adequate for the job of 
revealing this. Logic forms display only the way in 
which wmpound sentences are built from their basic 
elementary sentences; they do not display the subject- 
predicate structure of the elementary sentences them- 
selves. The problem of how to recognize the wrrect- 
ness of such inferences involves an area of logic 
known as "quantification theory," which is beyond 
the scope of this book and will not be pursued. 
Remember: Inferences which are sententially valid constitute good 
reasoning. Inferences which are not sententially valid might represent 
good reasoning nevertheless.

(b) If wages are raised, inflation continues. 
If there is a depression, wages cannot be raised. 
Therefore, if there is a depression, inflation cannot continue. 
(c) If this child is challenged, then he will enjoy learning. If he is 
not challenged, this child will be bored with school. 
This child does not enjoy learning. 
Therefore, he is bored with school. 
(d) If other countries develop new weapons, we feel that our na-

security is threatened, then we will spend more money on social

Therefore, if other countries develop new weapons, then we will 
not spend more money on social reform programs. 
(e) If the Department of Agriculture is correct, corn blight does 
not occur if the crop is sprayed weekly. 
Corn blight does occur. 
Therefore, if the corn is sprayed weekly, the Department of Agri- 
culture is wrong. 
(f) Unless protective tariffs are imposed, our balance of payments 
will be unfavorable. If our balance of payments is unfavorable, the

Therefore, if protective tariffs are imposed, foreign aid appropria-

3.3 
Checking Sentential Validity of 
Inferences by Repeated Use of Previously 
Proven Inferences 
The method introduced earlier for checking the sentential validity of 
an inference has the advantage of being conclusive in that it ulti- 
mately leads to an answer. Unfortunately, it sometimes leads to in- 
volved symbolic manipulations. The technique described now seems 
closer to the natural reasoning process and is often shorter. However, 
this new method is recommended only if you already suspect that the 
inference in question is sententially valid. 
In the new technique, inferences that have already been shown to be 
sententially valid (in particular those introduced in the preceding 
section) are used to prove that the given inference is sententially 
valid. The method is based on the following rule: 
An inference is sententially valid if the conclusion ap- 
pears as the last line in a vertical list of logic forms,

52 ANALYSIS OF INFERENCES 
A chain of inferences like the one in the preceding example is called 
a deduction of the conclusion from the premises. Such deductions 
resemble mathematical proofs (for example, the proofs of Greek 
geometry). This is not to say, however, that all proofs in geometry 
are such simple deductions. Analysis of the reasoning used in ge- 
ometry has shown that many of the inferences used there depend not 
only on the way in which the premises and conclusions are built from 
their elementary sentences by means of the logical operations, but 
also on the internal (subject-predicate) 
structure of the elementary 
sentences as well. The ancient Greeks did not carry the analysis of 
these inferences far enough; the logical analysis of the Greeks was 
inadequate for making fully explicit the reasoning used in their own 
mathematics.

Switching Circuits 
4.1 
Representing Switching Circuits 
By Logic Forms 
In this chapter the relationship between the design of switching cir- 
cuits and the algebra of logic forms will be investigated. First you will 
see how to represent a switching circuit by means of a logic form. This 
is done by making use of some basic properties of electric circuits and 
switches. 
To each switching circuit you will have to associate a circuit diagram. 
Examples of such diagrams are: 
The symbol "6" 
represents a terminal of the circuit, while.the 
symbol " 
- 
" represents a switch in the circuit. 
53 

54 SWITCHING CIRCUITS 
You know that for current to flow from one terminal to the other, 
there must be an unbroken path connecting the terminals. A path is 
unbroken if and only if all the switches occurring along it are closed. 
Using this fact, you can assign to each circuit a logic form which re- 
flects the structure of the circuit. The following examples demonstrate 
this. 
Example 1. 
Consider the circuit 
Switches joined together in this way are said to be con- 
nected in series. Assign the logic form A A B to this 
circuit because current flows if and only if both 
switches A and B are closed. 
Example 2. 
The following two switches are said to be connected in 
parallel. 
Assign the logic form A v B to this circuit because cur- 
rent flows if and only if A is closed or B is closed. 

4.1 REPRESENTING SWITCHING CIRCUITS 55 
Example 3. 
The circuit 
is an example of a series-parallel combination. Its logic 
form is A A (B v C) because current flows if and only if 
A is closed, 
and 
B or C is closed. 
In some circuits, one handle operates several switches simultaneously. 
Whenever one handle closes or opens several switches together, these 
switches are labeled with the same letter. 
Example 4. 
In the circuit 
both switches labeled A act in concert and are operated 
by the same handle. Its associated logic form is 
A A (A v B). 
This circuit has three switches, but only two control 
handles, an A-handle and a B-handle. 

54 SWITCHING CIRCUITS 
If one handle simultaneously opens one switch while closing an- 
other, it is indicated by labeling the one switch by a letter and the 
other by the negation of that letter. 
Example 5. 
In the circuit 
the two switches labeled A  act in concert but in op- 
position to the switch labeled 1 A. All three are con- 
trolled by one common handle. This circuit therefore, 
has four switches and two control handles, an A- 
handle and a B-handle. Its logic form is 
A A B A ( ~ A v A ) .  
The following table summarizes the procedure used to determine 
the logic form which represents a switching circuit.

4.2 
Simplifying Switching Circuits 
Consider the following switching circuits: 
For a given setting of the handles, current flows in the first circuit if 
and only if it flows in the second circuit. The first one, however, has 
fewer switches. Thus, the first circuit may be called a simplification of

the second. Actually there is a very practical reason for wanting to 
simplify a switching circuit; the smaller the number of switches in a 
circuit, the lower the cost of manufacturing it. Imagine how much 
money the telephone company could save if it eliminated just one 
switch from each bank of switches in the phone system! 
In Chapter 2 you learned how to simplify a logic form by algebraic 
manipulations. Now you can use the skills you developed there to 
simplify switching circuits by doing the following: 
1. Determine the logic form associated with the circuit. 
2. Use algebraic manipulations to simplify the logic form. 
3. Determine the switching circuit associated with the simplified logic 
form. 
Example. 
Simplify the following switching circuit and sketch the 
simplified circuit. 
ANSWER: 
The logic form associated with this circuit is: 
(A v B) A ( 1  A v C) A (B v C). 
Now simplify this logic form:

Limitations of the Logic Form Method 
Of Simplifying Switching Circuits 
In the last section logic forms were used to simplify certain circuits. 
There are two main drawbacks to this method. First, there is not yet a 
"nice" practical way to determine if a switching circuit is simplified 
as much as possible. In fact, this problem is still being investigated by 
research mathematicians. Also, this method does not take into ac- 
wunt circuits which are not "series-parallel" circuits. 
Example. 
The following is a diagram of a "bridge" circuit. 

4.4 DESIGNING A SWITCHING CIRCUIT 63 
The circuits which correspond to logic forms are 
"series-parallel" circuits, not "bridge" circuits. Thus, 
our method would never lead us to a circuit like this. 
Consequently, if this were the simplest circuit for a 
given situation, our method would fail to reveal that 
fact. 
Exercises 4.3 
1. Find a "series-parallel" circuit which behaves like the following 
"bridge" circuit. 
4.4 
Designing a Switching Circuit Starting 
With a Table Which Describes Its Behavior 
By examining the diagram of any switching circuit, you can .im- 
mediately determine whether current flows for any given setting of the 

64 SWITCHING CIRCUITS 
switches..Then you can compile a table that shows what the circuit 
will do for each setting of the switches. 
Example. 
Display a table describing the behavior of the following 
switching circuit for each possible setting of its 
switches. 
ANSWER: 
The table should appear as follows: 
t%p+qq 
off 
off 
off 
on I off 
off 1 on 
Now suppose you are given a table like the one constructed in the 
preceding example. It may seem surprising, but by using techniques 
off 
on 
developed earlier, you can actually design a switching circuit whose 
08 
on 
behavior is prescribed by the given table! First think of the table as a 
truth table (with "on" playing the role of the truth value t). Then con- 
struct the logic form which has this table for its truth table (You 
learned how to do this in Section 1.8.) After that, construct the cir- 
cuit which corresponds to this logic form. This will be the desired cir- 
cuit. 

4.4 DESIGNING A SWITCHING CIRCUIT 65

by the following table, and sketch this circuit.

The method just outlined will always lead to a switching circuit with 
the desired behavior. However, the circuit obtained by this method 
may not be the simplest circuit with this behavior.

scribed by the table:

ANSWER: 
The method just learned shows that the table describes 
the behavior of the switching circuit corresponding 
to the logic form: 
Now this can be simplified.

Hence the table also describes the behavior of the very 
simple circuit:

3. The five members of the Pookaville city countil are meeting to vote

4. A certain king's five advisors must decide whether to ratify a pro- 
posed treaty with the United States. It takes a majority vote of the ad- 
visors to ratify the treaty, except that the advisor who is prime 
minister has a veto (i.e., the treaty is ratified only if he votes for it). 
Design a circuit so that each advisor can vote for ratification by 
throwing a switch, and a bell rings if and only if the treaty is ratified. 
[Hint: Make a table.] 


Set Theory 
5.1 
Elementary Set Theory 
The idea of a set is the foundation upon which most of modern mathe- 
matics is built. It is so fundamental that we will not even try to de- 
fine it. Synonyms like "collection" or "class" or "family" are often 
used to convey the same idea. 
The objects which make up a set are called the elements or members 
of the set. If an object x is an element of the set A, we write 
If x is not an element of A, we write 
If every member of A is also a member of B, we say A is a subset of B, 
and write 
It is easy to see that every set is a subset of itself. Two sets, A and B, 
are equal (written A = B) if and only if they have the same members; 
that is, every member of A is a member of B and vice versa. In case 
A C 
- B, but A z B, we say A is a proper subset of B and write 
This happens when every member of A is a member of B, but some 
member of B is not a member of A. 
Example 1. 
The box on the next page should help to clarify the 
notions introduced so far.

In many applications of the theory of sets all the sets which come 
into play are built from elements taken from a set U which is specified 
in advance and called the universe (for that application). For example, 
in plane geometry the universe U is usually taken to be the set of all 
points in the plane, and the geometric figures like lines, circles, and 
triangles are thought of as sets of such points. 
In denoting sets, set braces ( , ) are often used. A set is sometimes 
specified by listing its elements inside set braces. For example, 
[1,2,8) is the set whose elements are 1, 2, and 8. In specifying a set 
this way, it is immaterial in what order the elements are written and 
how often they are repeated. Thus 
A set can also be specified by stating a property its members will 
have. For example, 
"the set of all objects which have the property of being 
an odd number," 
in short, 
"the set of all odd numbers." 

5.1 ELEMENTARY SET THEORY 
71 
Using x to denote a typical member of this set, we write 
(x I x is an odd number) 
and read this 
"the set of all x such that x is an odd number." 
The symbol " ( " is read "such that." 
It is convenient to introduce the so-called empty set which has no 
members. The symbol $J is used to denote it. It can easily be shown 
that $J is a subset of any set A by the following reasoning. To assert 
$J C_ A is the same as asserting that for any x, the implication 
holds; but this implication holds automatically since for any x, the 
left side of the implication is false. 
If A and B are sets, the set of elements belonging to either A or B 
is called the union of A and B. We write this 
A U B. 
For example, { 1,2) U (2,3) = ( 1,2,3). 
t 
The set of elements in both A and B is called the intersection of A 
f 
and B. We write this 
A n B. 
For example, {1,2) fl {2,3) = (21. 
The set of elements which is in A but not in B is called the difference 
of A and B. We write this 
Forexample,[1,2) - (2,3) = (1). 
When a universe U is specified and A is a subset of U, U-A is 
called the complement of A (with respect to the universe U). The com- 
plement of A is denoted by 
A'. 
For example, if U is the set of all whole numbers, and A is the set of 
all even numbers, then A' is the set of all odd numbers. 

72 SET THEORY 
Example 2. 
Suppose universe U is the set of all positive whole num- 
bers. 
Then A U B = ( 1,2,3,4,5,9) 
A n  B = [1,3,4) 
~ n c = $  
A - B = ( 2 , 5 )  
A' = (6,7,8,9.. .) 
It is possible for the elements of a set to be sets themselves. For 
example, for each set A, the power set of A can be formed which has 
the subsets of A as its elements. It can be shown that if A has n 
elements, the power set of A has 2" elements. 
Example 3. 
If A = ( 1,2,3), the elements of the power set of A are: 
Relationships among sets can be visualized by making a type of pic- 
ture called a Venn diagram. A few diagrams are given below. Think 
of the areas enclosed by the rectangles as the universe U. The rest 
ought to be self-explanatory.

Basic Identities and Relations of

quently needed when using set theory to solve mathematical problems.

You have, no doubt, been struck by the formal similarity between 
these identities and the basic logical equivalences used to manipulate 
logic forms. More will be said about this later. 
In the example below, one of these identities will be verified for you. 
The rest of them can be done in a similar way.

Checking Consistency of Data 
Social scientists working for the government spend much time col- 
lecting and evaluating data to reach conclusions that help shape 
government programs. Private enterprise spends much money on 
market research in which data is collected and evaluated to determine 
the public's response to a company's products. It may surprise you to 
learn that some very elementary set theory can be useful in checking 
that the collected data make sense, but this is indeed the case! 

5.3 CHECKING CONSISTENCY OF DATA 
77 
If A is a set, let #(A) denote the number of elements in A. The 
following formula, although easy to verify, is important. 
Using it, you can now derive a similar formula for #(A U B U C). 
The basic idea is to think of A U B U C as the union of two sets, 
namely A and (B U C). Now apply the above formula to these two 
sets to get 
#(A u [B u CI) = #(A) + #(B u c )  - #(A n [B u CI). 
The formula can further be applied to the second term. Moreover, 
after applying the distributive law to the third term, the formula can 
be applied to its parts. Collecting terms, the result is 
Study the two boxed equations! Compare them! If you look at both of 
them the right way, you should be able to make a good guess as to how 
the formula for four sets ought to look. 
In the following two examples you will see how to use the above 
formulae in a practical way. 
Example 1. 
In a random survey of 100 people who owned houses or 
cars, it was found that 70 people owned a house, and 
30 people owned both a house and a car. How many 
people surveyed owned a car? 
ANSWER: 
Let H = set of house owners 
C = set of car owners 
The basic formula is 
Substituting the data, the result is 
100 = 70 + #(C) - 30. 

78 SET THEORY 
Thus solving for #(C), the answer is 
#(C) = 60. 
Hence, 60 of the people surveyed own cars. 
Example 2. 
Data concerning the sex, education, and marital status 
of the 500 employees of the Sunshine Brewery were 
reported as follows: 
250 females 
156 college graduates 
235 married 
2 1 female college graduates 
73 married females 
43 married college graduates 
12 married female college graduates 
Now the man in charge of assembling the data was a 
bit of a boozer, and it was rumored that he made up 
the data after having too much to drink. His boss be- 
came suspicious and was able to check the data for 
consistency as follows: 
F = set of female employees 
G = set of college graduate employees 
M = set of married employees 
The data can now be written 
250 = #(F) 
156 = #(G) 
235 = #(M) 
21 = #(F 0 
G) 
73 = #(M n F) 
43 = #(M n G) 
12 = #(M n F n G) 
Putting this data into the previously given formula for 
the union of three sets, we get 
#(M U F U G) = 250 + 156 + 235 - 21 
- 73 - 43 + 12 
= 516 

5.3 CHECKING CONSISTENCY OF DATA 
79 
Recall that the company had only 500 employees and 
M U F U G being a subset of the set of employees 
can have no more than 500 members. This contradicts 
the figure of 516 just calculated, so the data is in- 
consistent. The data collector, by the way, was trans- 
ferred to the tasting department where he seems to be 
getting along well.

24 support wage and price controls 
No senator supporting higher tariffs on imports favors wage and price 
controls. Of the senators supporting higher taxes, as many favor wage 
and price controls as favor higher tariffs. Moreover, each senator 
favors at least one of the three proposals. 
(a) How many senators favor both higher taxes and wage and price 
controls? 
(b) How many senators favor only higher taxes? Only higher tariffs? 
Only wage and price controls? 

Boolean Algebra 
6.1 
The Abstract Approach 
Earlier you were asked to learn a long list of basic logical equivalences, 
which were established by means of truth tables. Some of the equiva- 
lences in the list could have been derived from others listed there. This 
fact was not stressed at the time and now needs to be presented. 
Example. 
The derivation below shows that the absorption law can 
be obtained if the commutative, identity, domination, 
and distributive laws hold. 
A A ( A v B ) =  ( A v B ) A A  
commutative law 
identity law 
(A v  B) A (A v  F) 
distributive law 
= A  ~ ( B A  
F) 
domination law 
= A v F  
identity law 
= A  
It is not hard to see that a derivation of the "same form" as the one 
just given could establish the absorption law for set theory as well. 
The following changes of symbolism in that derivation are all that are 
needed. 
insteadof v  
(7 instead of A 
= instead of = 
9 
instead of F 

82 BOOLEAN ALGEBRA 
Note that verifying the absorption law by the method of the preceding 
example yields more information than verifying it by truth tables. The 
method really shows that the absorption law holds not only in logic, 
but also in set theory, and, in fact, that it holds in any other "algebraic 
system" for which the commutative, identity, domination, and dis- 
tributive laws hold. If a scientist of a future age were led by the needs 
of his science to devise such an "algebraic system," he would be sure 
(from our proof) that the absorption law holds in his system too. 
This discussion illustrates what is often referred to as the abstract 
approach. This is the simultaneous study of a number of systems by 
first selecting or "abstracting" laws which are common to all of them 
and then deriving consequences of these laws. 
The next section will continue in this spirit. Five laws which are 
common to logic and set theory (and other systems) will be selected. 
On the basis of these five laws, others will be derived. Algebraic sys- 
tems satisfying the five laws selected are called Boolean algebras in 
honor of George Boole (1815-1864), who was one of the first people 
to use algebraic manipulations in the study of logic. 
It would not be appropriate to use the symbolism of logic or the 
symbolism of set theory in the development of Boolean algebra since 
these are only special cases of Boolean algebras. Instead new symbols, 
whose meanings are left unspecified, are used. It is not important to 
know which operations and constants these symbols represent. It is 
only the laws which govern their behavior that count. Below are listed 
the new symbols, their names, and the way they can be interpreted in 
logic and set theory.

6.2 DEFINITION OF BOOLEAN ALGEBRA 83 
Note: Be careful not to confuse 0 and 1 with the "numbers" 0 and 1 
of ordinary arithmetic. 
The word "complement" and its symbol were borrowed from set 
theory. This is unfortunate as the meaning is not always the same as 
in set theory. Nevertheless, this terminology is firmly rooted among 
practicing mathematicians, so you will have to live with it. 
6.2 
Definition of "Boolean Algebra" 
If necessary, you should carefully reread the preceding section. Other- 
wise, the definition of the notion of a Boolean algebra will not seem 
to be well motivated. 
Definition. 
An operation on a set S is a rule of correspondence 
which, to each pair of objects a, b of S (taken in that 
order), assigns exactly one object in S. 
Example 1. 
Given: 
R: the set of real numbers; 
+: the usual addition of real numbers; 
then "+" is an operation on R which assigns to each 
pair of real numbers, a and b, the number a + b. 
h m p l e  2. 
Given: 
N: 
the set ofpositive whole numbers; 
-: the usual subtraction of numbers; 
then "- " is not an operation on N because even though 
a and b are in N, a - b need not be a member of N. 
(It might be zero or a negative number.) 

84 BOOLEAN ALGEBRA 
Definition. 
A Boolean algebra is a system which consists of a set B 
together with two operations u and n, called cup 
and cap respectively, and which satisfies the following 
five laws: 
B1. Commutative laws: 
Foralla, b E (8, 
B2. Associative laws: 
B3. Distributive laws. 
For all a, b, c E (8, 
a u (b n c) = (a u b) n (a u c) 
a n (b u c) = (a n b) u (a n c). 
B4. Identity laws: 
There exists in (B objects (which we denote by 0, 1 re- 
spectively) with the property that 
a u 0 = a foralla € I 3 3  
and 
a n  1 = a forallaE(B 
Objects with the property of 0 and 1 are called identity 
elements for the operations u and n respectively. 
B5. Complementation laws: 
For each a E (8, there exists in (8 an object (which we 
denote by a') with the property that 
a u a l =  1 
a n a' = 0. 
Objects with the property of a' are called complements 
of a. 

6.2 DEFINITION OF BOOLEAN ALGEBRA 85 
In some books these laws are referred to as the axioms of Boolean 
algebra, while in others they are called the postulates of Boolean 
algebra. 
Example 3. 
Given: 
a: the family of all subsets of a given universe U; 
U: the operation of set union, U; 
n: the operation of set intersection, (3; 
then (B is a Boolean algebra with respect to the opera- 
tions of u and n.9 plays the role of the u-identity 0, 
while U plays the role of the n-identity 1. 
Example 4. 
This example shows in precisely what sense the algebra 
of logic forms is a Boolean algebra. It is a very so- 
phisticated example because the individual members 
of this Boolean algebra are themselves sets of logic 
forms. 
Let I[A] denote the set of logic forms logically equiva- 
lent to the logic form A. Let (B denote the family of all 
sets which are of the form [AD f a  some A. The opera- 
tions u and n on 63 are defined for [A], [B] € 63 as 
follows: 
let

Exercises 6.2 
1. In this exercise you have the opportunity to verify that there is a 
Boolean algebra with exactly two members.

u and n on CB are defined as follows: 
Show that 
= {p, qJ is a Boolean algebra with respect to the opera- 
tions of u and n just defined. 
Which member of @ plays the role of O? 
Which member of B plays the role of l? 
Which member of

Duality 
Suppose you have a statement in the symbolism of Boolean algebra 
and interchange the symbols in that statement as follows: 
(a) interchange the symbols u and n 
(b) interchange the symbols 0  and 1 
The resulting statement is called the dual of the original statement. 
Example. 
Thedual of a u b = c is a n b = c. 
Thedualof a u O =  a is a n . 1  = a. 
Thedualof On 1 = 0  is 1 U
O
 = 1. 
If you carefully reexamine axioms B1-B5 in the preceding section, 

6.4 SOME THEOREMS O F  BOOLEAN ALGEBRA 87 
you will discover the following curious and important fact: 
The dual of each axiom is also an axiom. 
This fact has the important consequence that if you prove a statement 
using the axioms of Boolean algebra, then you could also prove its 
dual. The reason for this is that you could replace each step in the 
proof by its dual. The resulting sequence of steps would be a proof of 
the dual of the original statement. This remarkable result is referred 
to as the principle of duality. 
Example. 
Suppose you were to prove the idempotent law (this will 
be done later), a u a = a, from the axioms of Boolean 
algebra. Then the principal of duality guarantees that 
dual, a n a = a, would also be provable.

Some Theorems of Boolean Algebra 
In this section some consequences of the axioms of Boolean algebra 
will be derived. Remember: Each result can be interpreted as a result 
of logic, or as a result of set theory. 
Theorem I. 
In any Boolean algebra a, 
a) there is at most one element with the property of 0. 
That is, there is at most one identity element with re- 
spect to the operation U. 
b) there is at most one element with the property of 1. 
That is, there is at most one identity element with 
respect to n. 
PROOF: 
a) Suppose 0  and O* were identity elements with re- 
spect to u; we shall show that 0  = O*, i.e., 0  and O* 
are the same element after all. 
o = o u o * = o * u o = o *  
:. 0  = o* 
b) The proof in this case is similar to the proof just 
given.

Theorem 11. (IDEMPOTENT LAWS) In any Boolean algebra a, for 
alla € a, 
PROOF: 
By using the principle of duality, you need only show 
that one of the identities holds. Then the other also 
holds automatically. Now prove that a u a = a. 
a = a u O  
B4 (identity law) 
= a u (a n a')

(complementation law) 
= a u a  
B4 (identity law) 
Tbeorem 111. (DOMINATION LAWS) In any Boolean algebra (8 , 
for all a E 
, 
PROOF: 
Because of the principle of duality, you have to verify 
only one of these identities to conclude that both hold. 
Provethata u 1 = 1. 
I = a u a '  
= a u (a' n 1) 
= (a u a') n (a u 1) 
= 1 n ( a u  1) 
= ( a u  l ) n  1 
= a u l

Theorem IV. (ABSORPTION LAWS) In any Boolean algebra (B, for 
all a, b in@, 
PROOF: 
Because of the principle of duality, you only have to 
verify one of these identities to conclude that both 
hold. Prove the top one.

Theorem V. If in a Boolean algebra (B, there are elements a, b, and c 
such that both the relations

Theorem VII. (UNIQUENESS OF COMPLEMENT) Each element 
a of a Boolean algebra (B has at most one comple- 
ment. 
PROOF: 
Suppose a' and a* were complements for a. Then, by the 
definition of complement, 
a u a f =  1 
a u a *  = 1 
and 
a n a l = O  
a n a * = O  
thus: 
a u a l = a u a *  
and 
a n a f = a n a *  
therefore, by Theorem V, a' = a*

Tbeorem VIII. In any Boolean algebra B, for any a f B, 
(a')' = a 
PROOF: 
a u a' = 1 and a n a' = 0 by B5. Therefore, a' u a = 1 
and a' n a = 0 by Bl. Now this last pair of identities 
means that a is a complement for a'. But (a')' is also a 
complement for a'. In fact, that is just what the sym- 
bolism (a')' denotes. In Theorem VII it was proved 
that each element in 63 can have only one comple- 
ment. Therefore, a and (a')' must be the same object 
that is, a = (a')'. 
Exercises 6.4 
1. Prove de Morgan's laws. That is, show that in any Boolean algebra 
63, for all a, b E 
(a u b)' = a' n b' 
and 
(a n b)' = a' u b' 
[Hints: 1. Because of the principle of duality, only the top identity has 
to be verified. 2. Show that a' n b' has the requisite properties to be a 
complement for a u b.] 
2. Show that in a Boolean algebra (B, it can happen that a n b 
= a n c even though b # c. 
3. Show that the associative laws can be derived from the remaining 
four laws for a Boolean algebra. 
[Hint: Let x = a u (b u c) 
y = (a u b) u c. 
Then show 
a n x = a n y  
a' n x = a' n y. 
Then use the dual of Theorem VI to conclude that x = y.] 
This result was first discovered by E. V. Huntington (1904). It shows 
that the associative laws wuld have been omitted from the definition 
of Boolean algebra.

1. Because of the principle of duality, verify only 
(a u b)' = a' n b' 
(i) First note (a u b) n (a' n b') = [(a u b) n a'] n b' 
= [(a n a') u (b n a')] n b' 
= lo u (b n a91 n b' 
= (b n a') n b' 
= (a' n b) n b' 
= a' n (b n b') 
= a 1 n O  
= 0 
(ii) Now note(a u b) u (a' n b') = a u [b u (a' n b')] 
= a u l(b u a') n (b u b')] 
= a u [(b u a') n 11 
= a u (b u a') 
= a u (a' u b) 
= (a u a') u b 
= l u b  
= 1 
From (i) and (ii) you can see that a' n b' has the requisite properties to 
be the complement of a u b. Hence, by Theorem VII, (a u b)' = 
a' n b'. 
2. Let (B be the Boolean algebra consisting of the subsets of a set X,

Moreover:

= a' n (b u C) 
and 
a' n y = a' n [(a u b) u cl 
= [a' n (a u b)l u (a' n c) 
= [(a' n a) u (a' n b)] u (a' n c) 
= [O u (a' n b)l u (a' n c) 
= (a' n b) u (a' n c) 
= a' n (b u c) 
Hence a' n x = a' n y. So by the dual of Theorem VI, x = y.
