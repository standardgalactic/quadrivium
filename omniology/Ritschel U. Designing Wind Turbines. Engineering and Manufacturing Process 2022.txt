This series publishes short books analyzing and reviewing the past and present energy
use of society and its future needs. A breakdown of current energy sources shows that
approximately 80% of the world’s primary energy comes from fossil fuels. The book
provides an assessment of the needs to change the way in which energy is produced and
utilized.

Preface
Wind has been tamed for a long time in human history for transportation and as source
of mechanical power for grinding grain and pumping water. Since about three decades
electricity from wind plays an important role in the transformation process towards a
climate-friendly, CO2-free energy supply. In addition, the energy payback time1 of wind
turbines is short (less than 1 year) such that in many scenarios for the future energy supply
wind contributes a signiﬁcant share.
The book is based on practical experience derived from development projects for com-
plete designs of new wind turbines and parts of it. Two of those designs are used for
illustration in this book. Focus of this book is on mechanical design of the drive train of
a wind turbine and how a wind turbine is developed within the engineering process of a
wind turbine manufacturer. Initially, we provide a concise account on basic concepts to
generate electricity from a wind rotor. We are not aiming to provide a complete overview
on wind energy and wind turbines. For this we refer to a number of excellent accounts
on wind energy for which updated editions appear on a regular basis, like books of Hau
[Hau 2014] and Manwell et al. [Manwell et al. 2009].
The wind turbine manufacturer is often called Original Equipment Manufacturer
(OEM). Detailed descriptions and explanations are given here for those components of
the wind turbine that are normally developed by the OEM of a particular type. The OEM
needs to have full knowledge of the complete system that consists of all parts being rotor
blades, nacelle, drive train, tower, and foundation including the dynamic properties and
the response to controller action. This knowledge is called system competence. The drive
train is the most important system. In wind turbines with gearbox, it consists of many
components like shafts, bearings, gearbox, and generator. In systems without a gearbox,
a large extraordinary generator has to be integrated into the drive train.
Some components are normally designed by the OEM itself. Examples are hub and
machine frame. These components will be treated in detail here. For other components
preliminary sizing is presented, since they are merely speciﬁed by the OEM. The design is
done by specialized industry companies. Examples are bearings and gearboxes. A detailed

same amount of energy that was used for its manufacturing and installation.

design is then provided by suppliers. The working principles of these components are
explained. The main contents of typical speciﬁcations for those components are described.
Other components like blades and towers are only treated brieﬂy.
The content of this book is largely covered by a lecture held at the University of Ros-
tock and guest lectures at other places. During the last 20 years the Rostock area has
become one of the centers of wind industry activities in Germany. About 10.000 jobs
have been created both for blue- and white-collar personnel. Hence, there has been high
demand for graduates from universities with knowledge in wind energy technology for
many years. As a consequence, an institute for wind energy technology has been founded
at the university as part of the mechanical engineering faculty. A curriculum was devel-
oped to provide an introduction to the ﬁeld and further insights in more specialized topics.
One of these more specialized topics is the one-semester course entitled “Designing wind
turbines in the industrial context”, which has been taught every year since 2015.

Wind Energy Basics
During recent history of mankind primary energy was mainly based on fossil sources like
coal, oil and natural gas. There is a broad consensus that a transition from fossil to renewable
energies has to take place during the next three decades. Main reason for this transition is not
the scarcity of fossil resources but the impending climate change caused by upper C upper O 2 emission
when the fossil fuels are burned.
The two renewable technologies that that can be quickly scaled up to the generation capac-
ity needed are photovoltaics and wind power.1 As argued for example recently by Schellnhu-
ber et al. (2016) the upscaling of new renewables is the only viable way to keep the global
warming below 2  Superscript degrees Baseline normal upper C and, thus, prevent irreversible damage to our climate.
1.1
Why Wind Turbines?
Wind power, one can say without exaggeration, is so far the most successful of the renewable
energies. By end of 2020 the wind power capacity installed worldwide was 743  upper G upper W, and
about 75  upper G upper W new installation was forecasted for 2021 (GWEC 2019).
Wind turbines (WT) have gone through an amazing development during the last three
decades or so. Most obviously they have enormously grown in size. The ﬁrst industrial wind
turbines during the 1980s had a rotor diameter of 15  normal m. The latest offshore wind turbines’
diameter measures more than 200  normal m. In the course of this development a number of virtues
of the technology have been achieved:
1 Of course hydro power and the use of biomass have long been used and are also renewable. The may
be called the traditional renewables. However, they cannot be scaled up to the necessary generation
capacity.

Wind Energy Basics
• Electrical energy production by one wind turbine reaches several millions of k upper W h and
thus can, on average, supply the electricity for thousands of households. The energy
production of a large wind farm can be compared to a conventional coal power plant.
• Cost of wind energy decreased since the 1980s to values that are similar or even below
the ﬁgures of conventional power stations. The size of the individual plant is essential
here.
• Not unrelated to the cost of energy is the energy payback time, i.e., the energy needed
to be produced during operation of the wind turbine to compensate the energy needed to
manufacture and install it. For wind turbines it is a few months only, much less than the
payback period of other technologies.
As a consequence wind energy always plays a important role in the scenarios for the energy
transition.InacooperativestudyofseveralGermanresearchinstituteswindcontributesabout
one ﬁfth of the global primary energy corresponding (under certain assumptions explained
in the study) to 28.000  upper T upper W h divided by normal a2 (Schmid et al. 2011). This demand can the mapped to the
needed wind capacity, which is a measure for the power (k upper W) installed. If we would assume
that an average of 45 percent sign of the installed capacity is utilized,3 it would correspond to a total
installation of about 7,000  upper G upper W compared to about 740  upper G upper W that have been installed during
the past 30 years. This is a large number in view of the ambitious time scale needed to
decelerate global warming.
Due to the intermittent nature of wind a comparison between electricity from wind and,
e.g., coal is misleading. Having a large amount of coal stored nearby the coal-ﬁred power
plant this can produce electricity whenever there is demand. In principle it can produce
almost always rated power, i.e., the power for which its steam turbine and generator have
been designed for. Wind power and photo voltaic on the other hand have to be backed up by
some storage or by some other kinds of energy source that is available when wind and/or
sun are not available. This is a special topic by itself not addressed in this book.
1.2
Concepts to Utilize Wind Energy
There is a long history of using wind energy for various purposes and with various concepts.
A good overview is provided in Manwell et al. (2009) and Hau (2014). In this section we
describe some basics of wind energy to then quickly arrive at three bladed turbines that we
see now in many countries of the world.
2 Somewhat lower ﬁgures for wind power are provided for instance by the Global Wind Energy
Council (Sawyer 2016).
3 An average capacity factor of 0.45 has been assumed. This is too high for present day turbines
but taking into account the present trends it might be realistic. The capacity factor is explained in
Sect.2.10.

body with arbitrary (here
elliptical) shape
Wind speed v
Lift
Drag
Force
A moving ﬂuid (air) will generate a force on a body (blade). If both air and blade move,
the relative speed is relevant. In general the force will not be aligned with the direction of
the relative speed. It can be decomposed into a component parallel to the relative speed,
called drag, and a component perpendicular to the relative speed, called lift. The value of
lift and drag and their ratio depends on the relative speed, the geometry of the body and the
angle between speed v and the (main axis of the) body, the angle of attack.
Only if we have symmetry with respect to reﬂection across the direction of v, lift is zero.
A sphere would be such an object that produces no lift since it is symmetric with respect
to any direction. In Fig.1.1 the situation is depicted for two dimensions. The basic concept
can be easily extended to three dimensions.
Wind turbines can utilize drag or lift for operation, i.e., make the rotor turn dominantly
by drag or lift force. They have a vertical or a horizontal axis of rotation. The operating
principles of these turbines will be treated in the following sections.
Almost all utility-scale wind turbines on the other hand have three blades, are of lift-type
and have a (nearly) horizontal axis. What is the reason why all other concepts have not been
successful when it comes to large wind turbines? In the next two section we will answer this
question.
1.2.1
Drag-Type Wind Turbines
The archetype of a wind turbine operating on drag is the cup rotor. This is probably the
most intuitive way to use wind to generate torque and rotation. It is based on our experience
that wind generates a force on ourselves. Due to the shape of the cup the drag is direction
dependent. This can be used to operate a rotor. Naturally the axis will be chosen vertical
since then the rotor works for any wind direction as wind is approximately horizontal. A
pictorial demonstration is given in Fig.1.2, which provides a top view.
The cup rotor generates a torque u p per  M equals left parenthesis upper D 1 minus upper D 2 right parenthesis r as long as up p er D 1 greater than upper D 2 (where upper D 1 and
upper D 2 refers to drag forces and r to the radius, i.e., the distance from the rotational axis to the
center of the cup). The open cup (upper D 1) propels the rotor while the other cup (upper D 2) hinders
the movement. There will be a starting torque at speed zero. But obviously the cups cannot
move faster than v, because then the drag on the propelling cup becomes zero. The power
generated by the rotor is given by u p p er P equals upper M normal upper Omega, where normal upper Omega is the angular velocity of the rotor.

This concept is simple and robust and, in fact, widely used for anemometers. However,
calculations (that we do not present here) show that the extracted power in relation to the wind
power hitting the rotor is small. Further on, the surface from which power is extracted—it
can be called aerodynamically active area—needs to be covered by some material which
for larger rotors leads to weight and structural problems. In conclusion, this would be too
costly for large utility-scale wind turbines.
There are many variants of the drag concept, like the Savonius rotor. Wind turbines based
on these concepts are sometimes used for powering lighting at remote places or similar. The
power of these devices is typically some Kilowatts. Large wind turbines based to the drag
concept are not built.
1.2.2
Lift-Type Wind Turbines
Utilizing the lift force is less intuitive but more efﬁcient. The reason is that the ratio between
lift and drag can reach high values well above 100 for certain types of airfoils. The high
lift-to-drag ratio is the basis of airborne ﬂight as well of the lift-type wind turbines.
Figure1.3 shows essentials on airfoils. The chord is a straight line that connects leading
and trailing edge. The incident ﬂow makes an angle with respect to the direction of chord.
This is the angle of attack called alpha. The aerodynamic force that is caused by the ﬂow can
be decomposed as shown already in Fig.1.1 into lift and drag. For airfoils the lift-to-drag
ratio becomes high for certain angles of attack. For airfoils used in wind turbines the angle
of attack with highest lift-to-drag ratio is small, at about 5 Superscript degrees or so (depending on the detailed
shape of the airfoil).
Lift-type wind turbines can work with horizontal or vertical axes. The ones with vertical
axis are also called Darrieus wind turbines. Darrieus rotors have not made it to series pro-
duction of utility-scale wind turbines. So they will not be treated in detail in this book. A
reference on this type of wind turbines is, e.g., Paraschivoiu (2002).
To understand the aerodynamic concept of the horizontal axis wind turbines consider a
rotor with one blade pointing vertically upwards as shown in the model of Fig.1.3.

Blades are cut at a certain radius to show the orientation of the airfoil with respect to
the rotor plane. The rotor plane is an imaginary plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation.
We assume that the rotor has a certain angular velocity normal upper Omega and the rotor plane is oriented
perpendicular to the wind direction, i.e., the rotor is facing the wind. The axis of rotation
is parallel to the wind direction. In nowadays wind turbines this is roughly but not strictly
true. The axis of rotation is pointing slightly upwards. This so-called tilt angle is normally
around 5 Superscript degrees. The reason why it is not simply zero will be explained in Sect.2.1.
Figure1.4 shows the situation of the blade at this section in the two-dimensional projec-
tion. Wind speed v is perpendicular to the rotor plane. There is a second component that
the moving blade experiences as a result of the rotation speed at the radius r. This speed
v S ubscript t Baseline equals normal upper Omega r is parallel to the rotor plane and in three-dimensions tangential to the circle with
radius r with the center at the axis of rotation. In a self-consistent (and more correct) treat-
ment of the ﬂow near a rotor blade, one has to introduce induction factors. For the sake of
simplicity this is omitted here.
In Fig.1.4 the variable w is the relative ﬂow speed, the vector sum of wind speed v and
tangential speed v Subscript t. In contrast to Fig.1.3 there is an additional angle between the chord
line and the direction deﬁned by the rotor plane. This angle is denoted by beta in Fig.1.4 and
called local pitch (or twist) angle of the airfoil at radius r under consideration.

Wind Energy Basics
Fig. 1.4 Incident ﬂow at airfoil and resulting forces. Decomposition in thrust and propulsion with
respect to rotor plane
The aerodynamic force can be projected onto directions parallel and perpendicular to
the rotor plane. Essential for making the rotor turn is the component parallel to the rotor
plane, called propulsion in in Fig.1.4. In order to generate a torque to maintain the rotation,
the propulsion must point to the right in Fig.1.4. In order to get a good performance, it
should be as large as possible. The perpendicular component, the thrust, is not useful but
can not be avoided. The thrust on the rotor blades is the crucial force sizing the blade root
and eventually the lower part of the tower.
As can be concluded from the previous remarks and Fig.1.4 a high lift-to-drag ratio
is important for large propulsion. If drag exceeds a certain limit at a given lift value, the
propulsion vanishes or becomes negative such that the concept of the lift-type wind turbines
fails. By turning (pitching) the complete blade around its longitudinal axis this can be used
to regulate torque and power to a desired value, e.g., at high wind speeds or to stop the rotor.
The relative wind speed w and its direction with respect to the rotor plane depends on and
increases linearly with radius r. For a good performance the local pitch angle beta has to be
chosen in the design of the blade such that up to a certain wind speed the angle of attack
at each radius operates at the maximum lift-to-drag ratio. Consequently, rotor blades have a
twisted shape. This is further addressed in Sect.2.3.
1.2.3
Power Performance of Different Concepts
To address power performance, let us consider an imaginary surface with area upper A that is
oriented perpendicular to the wind direction, e.g., a circle. Air ﬂowing through the circle
has kinetic energy. The kinetic energy per unit of time, i.e., the wind power upper P, streaming
through the circle is given by
u pper P equals StartFraction rho Over 2 EndFraction upper A v cubed comma upper P equals StartFraction rho Over 2 EndFraction upper A v cubed comma
upper P equals StartFraction rho Over 2 EndFraction upper A v cubed comma u pper P equals StartFraction rho Over 2 EndFraction upper A v cubed comma
(1.1)

where rho is the air density. The value for the air density at sea level and 15  Superscript degrees Baseline normal upper C temperature
is r h o equ als 1.225 k g divided by normal m cubed. For a wind speed of 10  normal m divided by normal s at which modern wind turbines start to
generate rated power, the power per unit area is about 600  normal upper W divided by normal m squared. This means, if we want
to design a wind turbine with access to power in the range of upper M upper Ws, we need to use a rotor
area of several thousand normal m squared.
The important question is, how much of this power can be extracted from the wind and
converted into electrical energy. The relevant quantity is the power coefﬁcient c Subscript upper P deﬁned
as the ratio of the power supplied by the wind turbine and the wind power due to its kinetic
energy.
There is a relatively simple and famous way to determine an upper limit of c Subscript upper P, which is
the actuator disk theory sometimes also called Betz theory.4 The result is that under certain
assumptions the upper limit of c Subscript upper P is 16 divided by 27 or roughly 0.59. So for the example given above
we would obtain a maximum power of roughly 360  normal upper W divided by normal m squared.
In the previous sections we have discussed drag- and lift-type wind turbines. Drag-type
wind turbines have a relatively low c Subscript upper P, much lower than the limit. Together with the fact
that the surface where the wind power is extracted needs to be covered by material which
would lead to extremely heavy and expensive structures for large rotors this concept can not
be used for utility-scale wind turbines.
Going beyond the simple actuator disc model, wind turbines are realized with vertical
or horizontal rotor axes. In general the lift-type concepts (both horizontal and vertical axis)
have better power performance than the ones operating on drag (vertical axis). Lift-type
vertical axis wind turbines can reach values for c Subscript upper P of about 0.3, while horizontal axis wind
turbines reach much higher values. In this case maximum c Subscript upper P values of slightly above 0.5
are possible, which are not so far from the Betz limit.
As mentioned in Sect.1.2.2 airfoils at each position of the blade (or radius measured
from the axis of rotation) has to operate at high lift-to-drag ratio or, in other words, the
angle of attack must have a certain value. For typical airfoils this value is roughly at 5 Superscript degrees. One
consequence of this is that the chord direction changes along the blade such that the blade
has a twisted shape. However, also the chord length of the blade is changing, i.e., decreasing
with increasing radius. This, however, requires more theoretical insight as it is an extension
of Betz’ approach taking into account effects of rotation and radial dependence.
Drag and lift-type concepts described here have one feature in common. A rotating device
(simply called rotor) extracts power from wind. In principle, also a linear motion could be
used. In fact, linear motion is used in novel ideas for wind power plants with kites, see Weber
(2021). We do not treat this topic further in this book.
4 Many text books contain good accounts of the actuator disk theory, e.g., Hau (2014).

1.3
The c Subscript upper P Baseline left parenthesis lamda right parenthesis Curve
So far we have only mentioned a c Subscript upper P value, which in fact is the maximum value of a more
general c Subscript upper P Baseline left parenthesis lamda right parenthesis curve classifying the rotor. An important quantity in the context of the power
performance of a wind rotor is the tip-spead ratio. This quantity is often denoted by lamda and
deﬁned as
l amda equals StartFraction v Subscript tip Baseline Over v EndFraction equals StartFraction normal upper Omega dot upper R Over v EndFraction right arrow normal upper Omega equals StartFraction lamda dot v Over upper R EndFraction lamda equals StartFraction v Subscript tip Baseline Over v EndFraction equals StartFraction normal upper Omega dot upper R Over v EndFraction right arrow normal upper Omega equals StartFraction lamda dot v Over upper R EndFraction

lamda equals StartFraction v Subscript tip Baseline Over v EndFraction equals StartFraction normal upper Omega dot upper R Over v EndFraction right arrow normal upper Omega equals StartFraction lamda dot v Over upper R EndFraction

lamda equals StartFraction v Subscript tip Baseline Over v EndFraction equals StartFraction normal upper Omega dot upper R Over v EndFraction right arrow normal upper Omega equals StartFraction lamda dot v Over upper R EndFraction
(1.2)
wherein normal upper Omega denotes the angular velocity of the rotor, upper R rotor radius, and v the ambient wind
speed (before kinetic energy is extracted by the rotor). The quantity normal upper Omega usually expressed in
units of 1 divided by s is related to the rotor rotational speed upper N by n o r mal upper Omega equals upper N pi divided by 30 often expressed in
units of rounds per minute (r p m). For the common three-bladed wind turbines it is obvious
what tip speed means. For a drag type wind turbine like sketched in Fig.1.2 one can take
the speed at the outer end of the cup.
The rotor can actually operate at any lamda which constitutes the c Subscript upper P Baseline left parenthesis lamda right parenthesis curve. An example
for such a curve for the rotor blades of one of the turbines we use in this book is shown in
Fig.1.5.
Qualitatively the c Subscript upper P curves for other rotors are similar. They start from zero (no rotation
no power) have a maximum that depends on the concept and then decrease again. For lamda too
large there must be a point where the rotor cannot generate power anymore and for even
larger lamda the power would be negative. Using this lamda one can directly calculate the speed a
rotor would reach in case it can turn freely. Somewhere in between is the maximum c Subscript upper P max.
The respective tip speed ratio for maximum value is denoted as design tip-speed ratio lamda Subscript upper D
for the rotor, i.e., c Sub s cript upper P max Baseline equals c Subscript upper P Baseline left parenthesis lamda Subscript upper D Baseline right parenthesis.
The maximum at la m da Subscript upper D Baseline asymptotically equals 9.5 in the Fig.1.5 is quite common for modern wind turbines.
In many textbooks the maximum for three-bladed rotors is still at lower lamda values which
is actually outdated. The design tip-speed ratio is related to the rotor solidity, deﬁned as
Fig.1.5 Power coefﬁcient c Subscript upper P

the projected area of all blades in relation to the total rotor area. As rotor blades are much
slimmer now than some decades earlier (see also Sect.2.10) the design tip-speed ratio has
increased up to values of about 10. For more details we refer to Hau (2014).
1.4
Electrical Energy from Wind
The rotor can be connected to a rotating electrical machine in order to generate electric power.
Electric machines in principle can work as a motor generating torque or as a generator
absorbing torque or, in other words, generating a negative torque (brake torque). If for
instance at a given wind speed the rotor operates at a certain c Subscript upper P it generates the torque
u p pe r M equals upper P divided by normal upper Omega, where normal upper Omega is the angular velocity. If the electrical machine, now working as a
generator, is able to generate the torque with the same magnitude, the system will operate
at constant speed. Seen from the mechanical point, the generator works as a brake to keep
the speed of rotation at a certain value. Without the generator torque the rotor would speed
up further to a speed that is in accordance with c Subscript upper P Baseline left parenthesis lamda right parenthesis curve explained in Sect.2.6.1.
For production of electricity an aerodynamic rotor connected to a generator is sufﬁcient.
Such a machine is called direct drive or sometimes gearless wind turbine. About a quarter
of all wind turbines worlwide is of this type. Alternatively, many models use a gearbox
situated between rotor and generator in the main drive train. The reason for this is that the
rotor speed is slow, e.g., 15  r p m. With such a slow speed one needs a special generator
design with higher number of so-called pole pairs. Hence, those direct-drive generators are
large and heavy. In order to use a standard high-speed machine, designed, e.g., for 1500  r p m,
one needs a suitable gearbox, in this particular example with a gear ratio of 100. In order
to achieve this ratio one needs several gear stages. One can conclude that in wind turbines
either one has to live with a complex and expensive generator (gearless) or with a complex
and expensive gearbox (geared system).
1.5
The Power Curve
The power curve is the electrical power generated by the wind turbine as a function of wind
speed. For all wind turbines that generate electrical energy there is a generic form of this
curve. Key quantity is the power rating (or rated power) of the system upper P Subscript upper R. The generator
will have a certain rated power mentioned on its type plate. If the sizing of other components
is done according to modern engineering standards, effectively also many other component
will be sized for the same power level. Depending on the size and the performance of the
rotor at a certain wind speed the rated power will be reached. This is called rated wind
(speed) or v Subscript upper R. The increase of power to that point will roughly be p roportional to v cubed. For higher wind
speeds the power has to be limited to upper P Subscript upper R. There are different concepts to limit or, as it is also
called, regulate the power. In all modern utility-scale wind turbines this is done by pitching
the blades and, thus, tuning the rotor to a lower c Subscript upper P level.

Wind Energy Basics
As an example we want to show the power curve of a 2  upper M upper W wind turbine, used in this
book as an example. With its rotor we can reach c S ubscript upper P Baseline equals 0.5. Some of this mechanical power
is lost on the way to the electrical grid. Mechanical and electrical losses amount to about
10% of the power extracted. Hence, for modern wind turbines we can assume c Su b script upper P comma e Baseline equals 0.45
for the ratio of electrical power supplied to the grid to wind power ﬂowing through the rotor,
where the sufﬁx e stands for electrical. As a result a simple form of the power curve is given
by

(1.3)
For wind speeds v  l ess than 3 normal m divided by normal s the wind turbines do not feed power into grid. The power
of the wind is quite low for these wind speeds and losses in the system are of the same
magnitude. The speed when power production starts is called cut-in wind speed. At the
other end, for high wind speeds, one stops the turbine when the wind speed exceeds 25  normal m divided by normal s.
This is called the cut-out speed.
In terms of power rating (in normal upper W), air density (in k g divided by normal m cubed) and rotor area (in normal m squared) the rated
wind speed (in normal m divided by normal s) is (approximately) given by

equation for the wind turbine with 93  normal m rotor and 2  upper M upper W rated power is shown in Fig.1.6.

1.5
The Power Curve
11
The power curve of other turbines, even for drag-type concepts, would look similar,
the quantitative form depending on upper P Subscript upper R, c Subscript upper P, rotor area upper A and air density rho. Most of these
quantities we have in our hand. Only with the air density it is different. For instance at an
altitude of 1000 m the air density is about 10% lower than at sea level with a signiﬁcant
impact on the power curve.
In reality the situation is more complex. One reason is wind turbulence. Due to this below
v Subscript upper R the power curve is typically above the simple form because positive gusts increase power
more than negative gusts reduce it. On the hand near v Subscript upper R the power curve is below the simple
form because positive gusts are regulated to rated power.

Modern Wind Turbines
Compared to early times of utilizing wind energy, modern wind turbines have experienced
quite some changes. Basic elements are still present: Some device for capturing the wind
(blades), a building (tower) and a foundation. But driven by structural integrity and costs
modern wind turbines nowadays look different. Also the purpose has changed in time.
Previously utilized mostly mechanical for pumping water, grinding grain, driving machines
via belts, etc., modern wind turbines have been producing electrical energy since the middle
of the last century.
2.1
Geometry with Upwind Rotor
In a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) the rotor can be upwind or downwind of the
tower, in other words, with respect to the wind direction in front of or behind the tower. The
downwind position has a number of advantages, but nevertheless all present utility-scale
wind turbines have upwind rotor. The main disadvantage of the downwind position is the
strong tower shadow. In the following we focus on the upwind position.
When the turbine is operating there is a thrust force on the blades bending them towards
the tower. In order to avoid that the tip of a blade hits the tower, the distance of the rotor
plane and the tips needs to be sufﬁciently large. How can this distance be obtained? One
way is to increase the horizontal distance between tower and rotor which is called the rotor
overhang. If the overhang is large enough, one can leave the rotor vertical. This method was
used in older wind turbines but it is clearly expensive as it includes more structural material
to hold the rotor in the overhang distance.
A smarter way to achieve a sufﬁciently large tip to tower distance (TTD) is to change
slightly the overall geometry. The result is sketched in Fig.2.1. Firstly, the rotor axis is
tilted by a small amount. Tilt angles of present-day wind turbines are about 5◦or somewhat
above. In addition to the tilt angle larger turbines have a rotor cone angle, the blade is pointing

slightly into forward direction. The cone angle is about 3◦relative to the rotor plane. The
rotor plane itself is deﬁned perpendicular to the rotor axis. Additional a pre-bending of the
blade can be utilized to increase the distance, meaning that the blades are bent relative to
the blade axis away from the tower, see Fig.2.1.

Components and Systems
A wind turbine consists of numerous components and systems. Some are essential, some
are more auxiliary items. The key components of the wind turbine are blades, components
of the drive train like gearbox and generator, as well as tower and foundation. The outer
components are depicted in Fig.2.2. Some of the components are manufactured by the OEM
and some are obtained from suppliers depending on the degree of vertical integration in the
company.
It is useful to distinguish between components and systems. Systems are assemblies of
components with a particular purpose where some party needs to have the competence.
Systems are always more than the sum of their components. Of course, the wind turbine is
a system. Other important systems are
• Drive train—consisting of rotor, shaft, gearbox, etc.
• Pitch system—consisting of pitch bearing, drive, energy storage, etc.
• Yaw system—consisting of yaw bearing, drives and brakes
• Control system—consisting of sensors and controller hardware and software
• Safety system—stand-alone system to stop the turbine in case of danger

2.3
Rotor Blades
Rotor blades are one of the key components of the wind turbine. They should have good
aerodynamic performance, i.e., yield a high value of the power coefﬁcient. Other aspects of
the aerodynamics are noise and performance in power regulation. Further, the mechanical
properties of the blades are important. One objective is to make light rotor blades. Since the
rotor needs to be held in some distance in front of the tower-top, a light rotor reduces loads
on all subsequent structural parts including the foundation. Not only the static loads due to
the weight of the components are important, but also the dynamic loads occurring due to
structural vibrations are reduced by low mass and inertial moment of the rotor.
In modern wind turbines of earlier days there were attempts using blades made from steel
and aluminum. Nowadays blades are made from composite materials where ﬁbers like glass
and carbon ﬁbers are enclosed by a suitable resin, the so-called ﬁber reinforced plastics
(FRP). FRP are light and strong enough to design slim blades that withstand loads from
wind, gravity, and vibrations. In recent years the design has become slimmer. The chord-

length relative to the blade length has become smaller. The power performance of the rotor
does not suffer from this change. Only the rotor has to run faster with slimmer blades. Slim
blades are lighter, but of course the structural stability needs to be ensured by a suitable
structural design.
The standard internal structure of a rotor blade is shown in Fig.2.4 (see also Sing et al.
2013). The shell is manufactured in two molds. It consists of an upper and a lower part
where the division is approximately the chord line of the airfoils. Two shear webs that go
through most of the blade keep the upper and lower part in their distance when the blade is
bent due to wind loads. Spar caps are located at and in between the shear webs. They are
made of stronger material with ﬁbers mainly in the direction of the blade axis such that the
stress is in direction of the ﬁbers. The spar caps in some blades are made from carbon ﬁbers
which have higher strength than glass ﬁbers.
The shear webs together with the spar caps build a spar that is responsible for the stability
of the blade. In some rotor blades—depending on the preference of the blade manufacturer—
the spar is made ﬁrst and then as a module attached to the shells. Alternatively the webs are
attached to the shell that contains the spar caps already in the laminate.
The parts of the blade shell in front and behind the spar caps is made from sandwich
material which is light and stiff such that the airfoil retains its original shape. Shells and
webs are connected to each other by glue. The matrix material are resins like polyester or
epoxy. In summary:
• Rotor blades are mainly fabricated from glass ﬁber reinforced plastic (FRP)
• Some larger blades contain also carbon ﬁbers in highly loaded parts (box girder, spar
cap)
• Carbon ﬁber is much more expensive than glass ﬁber
• Shell of the blade partly consists of sandwich material (FRP, Balsa wood/foam)
• Matrix material is polyester or epoxy resin
Concerning the manufacturing procedure two molds are needed for the upper and lower
side of the blade. The challenge is now to obtain a material where ﬁbers are distributed

18

Modern Wind Turbines
evenly in the resin for instance 60% ﬁbers immersed in 40% resin. One way of fabrication
is hand laminate, where the ﬁbers are laid into the mold and resin is distributed by hand
with rollers. However, the quality as judged for instance by the uniformity of the material
is typically not satisfactory with this method. A solution would be to add more material to
compensate the shortcomings of the production process. But this would lead to higher mass
which one does not want. For these reasons, hand laminate is no longer used for large rotor
blades.
The approved method for the mass production of rotor blades is vacuum infusion. In this
process, ﬁber material is also placed into a mold. The form lined with ﬁber mats is then
covered by an airtight foil. The mold is designed in such a way that resin can also be fed to
one side at certain distances through pipes or hoses. On the opposite side there are lines to
which vacuum pumps are connected, which suck the air out of the space between the foil
and the mold. At the same time, the resin is then sucked into the space and gradually ﬁlls
the space between ﬁbers with resin. Either polyester or epoxy is used as the resin. Resins
are liquid at low temperatures and then harden when the mold is heated.
A disadvantage of the blades produced in this way is that they are difﬁcult to recycle.
Resin or the matrix and ﬁbers made from it are difﬁcult to separate from one another. How
should one deal with many thousands of rotor blades that can no longer be used after about
20 or 30 years? One possibility, if not very nice, is to burn the material that has been cut into
smaller pieces. Another possibility is shredding everything and placing them in concrete as
a ﬁller, for example in road construction. However, real opportunities for recycling are being
worked on and there are promising approaches for a sustainable solution.
An important part of the blade is the blade connection, i.e., the connection between the
blade and the hub or, more precisely, between the blade and the blade bearing—usually
called the pitch bearing—where the pitch bearing is then attached to the hub. High loads
have to be transmitted over the blade connection on a relatively small circle of bolts. As seen
in Fig. 2.3, the blades are cylindrical on the hub side. This part is called the blade root. For
example, a 60m long blade has a diameter in the connection area or around 2m. There are
around 70–100 threaded rods on the circle, which must be ﬁrmly anchored in the laminate.
Two solutions have been established for the connection between the threaded rods and
the blade root. One works with laminated bushings that are provided with internal threads.
On the outside, the bushings have a wavy shape, so that a solid connection with the laminate
is created. The alternative to this is the connection with the help of T-bolts, as is also used in
a similar way in furniture and is therefore also called IKEA connection. In the process, holes
are drilled in the axial direction for the threaded rods in the blade root. At the end of each
axial bore, additional holes are drilled in the transverse direction for the T-bolts into which
the threaded rods are screwed. The blade root is then connected to the bearing ring with nuts
on the rods. By pretensioning the rods, the blade is ﬁrmly connected to the bearing.
Since the composite material and structures made from it is regarded as less reliable than
for instance steel structures, testing plays an important role in rotor blades. From each new
blade one specimen has to be put on a test rig in order to prove the stability under extreme

loading. Blade test facilities need a large hall and a solid concrete wall or block where the
blade can be mounted in horizontal position. Now the blade is pulled vigorously at various
load application points, so that is corresponds to the extreme loading that may occur at the
wind turbine. According to some standards, a test for fatigue loads must also be carried out.
There are no comparable requirements for components made of steel or cast iron.
A cross section of a typical airfoil was provided in Fig.1.3. The outer shape of the blade
follows an aerodynamic airfoil similar to those used for air crafts, however, adjusted to the
necessities of wind turbine requirements. Since the air ﬂow is not uniquely distributed across
the blade (due to different relative wind velocity as a function of radius) the angle of attack
varies along the rotor blade. Therefore the rotor blade has an intrinsic twist, which is different
from wings of airplanes. Wind ﬂow is going from leading to trailing edge passing along the
suction side (upper surface) and the pressure side (lower surface) in Fig.1.3. Chord line and
max thickness (usually given in per cent of cord length) deﬁne the relevant areas that lead
to actual forces (lift and drag) acting onto the blade structure and make the blade rotate.
Airfoils used for blades are usually asymmetric. A measure of asymmetry is the camber line
which is the middle line between upper and lower surface.
Due to the different relative wind speeds across the radius the chord length changes as
well. For an optimal performance it is larger at root and smaller at tip. At root, usually for
technical reasons and reasons of rather low relative wind speed at blade root and hub, most
of the blades have a cylindrical blade root. This is seen in Fig.2.5 (right). A different concept
to treat the blade root following more the theoretical concept is realized by Enercon in the
same Fig.2.5 (left).
Design and structural analysis of blades is a chapter by its own and will not be tackled
further in this book. From wind turbine design point of view the blade can be considered as
a component that can be purchased from a supplier. Although very relevant for the design

of the turbine it is yet not a turbine speciﬁc design element as is the hub or the main frame.
Hence for further reading see, e.g., Hau (2014).
2.4
Towers
Three different tower concepts are used for wind turbines, each of which comes with a
number of advantages and disadvantages, the tubular steel tower, the lattice tower, and the
concrete tower, see Fig.2.6. The majority of towers for wind turbines are tubular steel towers.
The tubular steel tower basically consists of a steel tube with a certain wall thickness. The
tube can be conical or partly cylindrical and partly conical. The base diameter normally is
larger than the diameter at the tower top such that some part of tower needs to be conical.
The tube is made from steel plates that are bent and attached to each other by horizontal
and vertical welding seems. The tower is highly loaded—statically and dynamically—such
that quality requirements on welding seems are high. The necessary quality is achieved by
automatic or semi automatic procedure and close examination of the seems.

Towers
21
Justduetothelargeamountofmaterial,thetowerisoneofthemostexpensivecomponents
of a wind turbine. The tubular steel tower for a multi-MW wind turbine can weigh several
hundred tons. For example the tower of the 2 MW turbine for hub height of 80 m has a mass
of about 170 t. As a consequence, mass optimization is a important part of the engineering
process. It turns out that the wall thickness of the tower needed for stability becomes lower
when the diameter is larger. This is true up to a diameter after that the wall would start to
buckle. As a results of this, the towers of recently installed wind turbines are cylindrical up
to about 2/3 or more of their total height and then end in a conical part.
Since a tubular steel tower is too long and too heavy for transport on roads, for onshore
wind turbines they have to be divided into sections. The typical tubular steel tower is divided
into three or more sections each of which can be moved from a manufacturing plant to the
site with special transport vehicles. The size of the sections (diameter, length, and mass) is
determined by transport restrictions. The tower sections are connected by ﬂanges with bolts.
Flanges are thin steel rings that have to be machined with high precision and handled with
great care to avoid plastic deformation. In the tower manufacturing plant they are welded to
the tubular sections.
Especially the diameter is important for the stability of the tower. At the bottom the bend-
ing moments are highest. A larger diameter would be desirable. This is where a drawback
of the tubular steel towers becomes relevant. It is the transport restriction concerning the
diameter. In general, during the transport bridges have to be passed which are usually not
more than 4.5 m high. Since tower sections so far cannot the fabricated at the wind-farm site
the bridges are so to say a hard limit for the tower base diameter. Alternatively to increase
the tower-base stability one could use thicker steel plates for the wall. But also sheet thick-
ness is limited to some centimeters since the plates have to be bent. Effectively there is a
limit for the size and hub height of wind turbines on tubular steel towers—about 140 m
rotor diameter and not more than 140 m hub height—above which other tower concepts are
needed. Tubular steel towers for offshore wind turbines where the transport restrictions do
not exist have a larger diameter and are made in one piece.
A tower concept for which comparable limits do not exist is the lattice tower. It consists of
main beams—in most cases four main beams—connected by a lattice of thinner steel beams
that prevent buckling of the main beams, very similar to masts of electrical transmission
lines. The beams are attached to each other by bolts. The lattice tower can be assembled
from the individual beams or pre-assembled sections that are easy to transport on roads.
Consequently, no limits for hub height and rotor size exist for the lattice towers. On the
other hand assembly time is much longer than for tubular towers, the tip to tower distance
is demanding, torsional stiffness has to be carefully observed as a low torsional stiffness
might lead to operational problems. Further the bolts—many more than in the tubular steel
tower—have to be maintained and last but not least many people do not accept lattice tower
for aesthetic reasons. Under the bottom line, although the lattice tower has its advantages,
only very few wind turbines are installed on it.

22

Modern Wind Turbines
While the two tower concepts mentioned use steel as structural material the third concept
is based on concrete. Concrete has the special feature that it can tolerate large pressure but
little or no tensile stress. Like in bridges or tall buildings one can pre stress the concrete such
that the concrete remains under pressure even when for instance a large bending moment at
the tower bottom of the wind turbine would cause tensile stress at the wall. Further, concrete
has good vibrations damping properties, i.e., higher structural damping than steel.
For smaller wind turbines spun-concrete masts were quite popular for a while. More
recently concrete towers became popular to overcome the limitations of the tubular steel
tower but still provide the outside appearance of the latter. One can use in-situ concrete. But
formanytowersprefabricatedelementsare usedwhichhaveasizesuitablefortransportation.
The towers can be completely made from concrete. But very popular recently have been
the so-called hybrid towers that have a concrete lower part up to a third or half of the total
height and a tubular steel part on top. Again a restriction for the base diameter made from
in-situ concrete or pre-fabricated parts does not exist such that the concept is suitable for
large rotors and hub heights. New wind turbines with hybrid towers look more or less like
tubular steel towers from outside where the concrete part is painted with the same color
as the steel part. Only those who know the diameter limitation of steel tubes recognize the
larger width of the tower base.
Concerning stability the properties of concrete are different from steel. Pure concrete
without steel reinforcement tolerates pressure but must not be loaded by tension stress.
Especially the loading and sizing of the lower part of the tower is determined by the thrust
on the rotor. In the tower wall a bending moment grows from top to bottom which leads
to pressure at the downwind and to tension at the upwind side. For large heavily loaded
structures it is not sufﬁcient to include steel reinforcement into the wall. The tower needs to
be pre-stressed in the vertical direction such that even when large bending moments occur
the concrete always remains under pressure. This is achieved by steel strands that go from
the bottom of the tower to the top of the concrete part. In some towers the steel strands are
guided in channels inside the wall, in others the strands lie at the wall inside the tower. An
important part in this concept is the component at the top end of the concrete part where
the steel strands are connected and an adapter for the steel ﬂange is provided where a steel
tube for the uppermost part can be ﬁxed. Although the hybrid tower is more expensive than
a tubular steel tower, for large wind turbines with hub heights of 150 or more meters, it is
regarded as the best choice by many project developers.
As any other building wind turbines need a foundation. Unless in many smaller buildings
the foundation is not sized by the weight of the structure on top but again by the bending
moment. The so-called slab foundations are large and heavy plates of reinforced concrete
that are sized in such a way that even the extreme thrust values cannot overturn the turbine.
If the soil is stable enough the large slab is sufﬁcient. If the soil is too soft one uses vertical
piles beneath the slab that go down to more stable layers below the surface.

Between the tower and the concrete slab a reliable connection is needed. Here we discuss
the connection to the tubular steel tower. There are two different types of connection used
in wind industry. A sketch of both concepts in provided in Fig.2.7.
One is the connection with long anchor bolts shown in Fig.2.7 (right side). The anchor
bolts are extending from the bottom ﬂange of the tower to a ring beneath the foundation.
The bolts are not immersed in the concrete but separated from it by plastic sheaths. By

stressing the bolts the foundation is clamped between tower base and the ring at the bottom.
A realization is shown in Fig.2.8.
Another type of connection is the steel insert (or base can) shown in Fig.2.7 (left side).
It is a short steel tube that is set into concrete. It has a ﬂange on top to which the base part
of the tower can be attached.
2.5
Power Generation System
The generator converts mechanical to electrical power. The essential process for this con-
version takes place in the air gap between generator rotor and stator. The relevant physical
quantity is the torque in the air gap, where the mechanical and the electrical pictures match.
On one hand, torque can be expressed in terms of mechanical quantities coming form the
aerodynamic rotor of the wind turbine and, on the other hand, it can be expressed in terms of
electrical quantities such as currents and voltage acting in the cabling and power electronics.
Since we are focusing mostly on mechanical aspects of wind energy in this book, we refer
to details of the electrical machines to Heier (2014).
Various concepts for electrical machines that can be used in wind turbines are available.
Widely used are synchronous and induction machines generating 3-phase alternating current
(AC). Induction machines are also called asynchronous ones. They basically differ by real-
ization of circuitry in the rotor, whereas the circuitry of the stator is alike. Synchronous and
asynchronous refer to the rotational speed of the generator rotor in relation to the rotation
of the magnetic ﬁeld from AC in the stator of the generator. The rotor is synchronous, if it
is rotating with the same speed and asynchronous, if its speed is (slightly) different.
If the stator is directly coupled to an electrical grid, the rotational speed is determined
by the grid frequency. In modern wind turbines, however, the rotation is freed from this
limitation by using converters in one or another way. To run the wind turbine with adjustable
or, as it is called often, variable speed is very important as we show in Sect.2.6.1.
To demonstrate, on a basic level, how variable speed works, we utilize the concept of a
permanently excited synchronous generator. Magnets are attached to the generator rotor in
a small distance (air gap) from stator coils. While turning the rotor voltage is induced in the
stator coils with a frequency proportional to the rotational speed. Connecting this machine
to the grid and feeding in electricity with the proper frequency (50 Hz or 60 Hz depending
on the country) becomes possible with a converter. The converter consists of a rectiﬁer or
generator-side converter producing direct current (DC) from AC. Then another converter—
normally called inverter–converts DC to AC with grid frequency. The connection between
the converters is called the DC link.
Thus, effectively we have an AC to AC converter that converts electrical current from
any frequency to grid frequency. One can also state it in a slightly different way: The stator
is still connected to the grid but the AC frequency is changed on its way to a value that is
good for operating the aerodynamic rotor.

2.5
Power Generation System
25
The converter is not only good for changing frequencies. Even more important is that the
torque can be controlled. With torque control it is possible to run the turbine at a speed with
maximum power coefﬁcient.
In Fig.2.9 the two concepts used for wind turbines are shown. The two upper panels
correspond to a complete decoupling of grid frequency as described above. This is used
for mechanical drive trains with gearbox (upper panel) and for direct drives (middle panel).
The generator is connected to the so-called fully-fed converter. The power ﬂow is simple.
It goes from the generator through the converter to grid. The converter has to be sized for
rated power.
The lower panel is referred to as doubly feed induction generator (DFIG) concept. In this
case the frequency of the rotor current is adjusted (i.e, detached from grid frequency) by a
converter and the stator is still connected to grid. The rotor needs to be connected in this case
by slip rings to the outside. The advantage of this concept is that the converter needs not to
be sized for the full power rating. In existing machines the rating is about 30% of the system
rating. Cost and power rating are roughly proportional. The speed range of the doubly-fed
system is limited. It is related to the share of power that runs through the converter.
A vital part of the power generation system is the transformer. Wind turbine generators
often work on a voltage level of about 700 V. Some large machines also work at somewhat
higher voltages. Also the converter is designed for the same level. But that voltage is not
suitable for transferring the electrical energy over large distances. The reason is that the
necessary cable cross sections would be too high. Thus, each wind turbine has a transformer
to step up to a level of 30 kV for instance. As indicated in Fig.2.9, the transformer is between
converter and grid.
From the design point of view the location and integration of all these components is
relevant. The generator is the interface between mechanical and electrical engineering. The
mechanical aspects like integration of the generator in the drive train design are described in
Sect.4. The task is quite different for geared and gearless systems. How about converter and
transformer? In many wind turbines the converter is at the bottom of the tower. Accordingly,
also the transformer is at the tower bottom or even in a separate housing outside the tower.
The advantage of this concept is, that the access to converter and transformer for service and
repair is easy (in case of land based wind turbines). The mass of these components does not
contribute to the nacelle mass. On the other hand, the low voltage level extends from nacelle
to tower bottom. For high towers and large power ratings this implies a large amount of
copper in the cables that connect downwards. As a consequence, there is a trend to integrate
the complete power generation system with transformer into the nacelle.
To provide the complete picture we mention that wind turbines with generator directly
connected to the grid have been built also. Until about 20 years ago these machines were
quite successful due to their simplicity and lower cost. Many of those wind turbines have a
concept with two rated speeds (one low, one high), as if there were two generators in the wind
turbine. The relevance of this will be explained in the next Sect.2.6. In fact, this concept
is realized by switching the number of active pole pairs that are contained in one housing.

Essential Control Concepts

Another solution, is “stretching” the limits for slippage from few percent to few 10% by
what is called “dynamic slip control” for induction machines, see, e.g., Heier (2014).
2.6
Essential Control Concepts
Modern wind turbines are operating automatically, i.e., align with the wind direction, run
at the right rotor speed, pitch the blades to the proper angle. They are controlled by micro-
processors like many other machines. In the following sections a brief account of operation
and control concepts is given. For more details we refer to Burton et al. (2021), Gasch et al.
(2012).
We distinguish control strategies below rated power (equivalent to below rated wind
speed) and at rated power (equivalent to above rated wind speed). Below rated we aim at
extracting as much power as possible. Above rated wind speed there is enough power in
the wind and hence the task is to keep the mechanical power extracted by the wind turbine
constant. This is called power regulation. In the following section we shall focus on variable
speed control and power regulation by pitch. This concept is used by all utility-scale wind
turbines fabricated during the last two decades. The control scheme to realize such a concept
is sketched in Fig.2.10. In this ﬁgure we identify two control loops, one for torque demand,
i.e., torque control, and one for pitch angle demand, i.e., pitch control.
In former wind turbines a concept with constant speed and power regulation by stall, i.e.,
onset of turbulence at rotor blades at certain wind speed, was used frequently. This will be
brieﬂy explicated at the end of this subsection.
2.6.1
Variable Speed Operation by Torque Control
The basis of variable speed control is the cP(λ) curve as explained in Sect.1.3. In today’s
turbines blades can be turned around their axis. This is called pitching. In Fig.1.5 the curve
is shown for a pitch angle θ = 0 only, which (normally) refers to the respective maximum cP
value of the rotor. If the pitch angle θ of the rotor blades is changed we get a set of cP(θ, λ)

curves with lower maxima as θ deviates from zero. The variation on the pitch angle will be
used below in the context of power regulation. In this paragraph we focus on the case θ = 0
only, or in other words optimal power performance.
To appreciate the variable speed concept we calculate the mechanical power Pmech for
θ = 0. With rotor area A and wind speed v the mechanical power that can be extracted from
the wind is
Pmech(λ) = cP(λ) Pwind = cP(λ) ϱ
2 A v3.
(2.1)
It depends explicitly on the tip speed ratio λ. The result of this equation is a set of power
curves for different wind speeds. These curves are shown in Fig.2.11 as blue lines. Each
blue line represents a certain wind speed v indicated in the ﬁgure. Since λ = vtip/v and
vtip =  R, with the rotor radius R, for each wind speed v and rotor speed a λ can be
determined to be used in Eq.2.1 that lead to the blue set of curves.
To get the respective power maximum for a given wind speed, the cP value has to be
maximal. This is the case for the design tip speed ratio λD which is constant for all wind
speeds. In its turn, the rotor needs to be operated at a speed proportional to the wind speed,
i.e., variable speed. In our particular example we ﬁnd λD = 9.5 and cP,max = 0.5 from
Fig.1.5. The curve connecting the respective power maxima is the green line in Fig.2.11.
The black vertical line refers to the rated rotor speed and its height (black dot) to the power set
point, which is a bit higher than rated power (delivered to grid) to compensate for mechanical
and electrical losses in the system.

Essential Control Concepts
29
The aim is to operate the wind turbine on this green line, as long as wind speed is low.
How can we make the rotor to operate at λD? The method used in all modern wind turbines
is torque control. The basic idea is as follows: We need to measure the rotational speed
N of the rotor and read from Fig.2.11 or, better, a table that contains this information, the
respective maximum power that can be generated at this N. Then the power generation
system is arranged such that is provides a generator torque T corresponding to T = P/,
where  = N π/30.
In fact, the aerodynamic rotor may be at any N, not corresponding to λD. In such a
situation the aerodynamic torque is different from the counteracting generator torque. If N is
too small (λ < λD) the aerodynamic torque is larger than the generator torque corresponding
to this N and the rotor will speed up. Conversely, if N is too high, the aerodynamic torque is
smaller and the rotor will slow down. With this concept we always end up at the point were
aerodynamic and generator torque are the same and at the maximum cP if we have used the
proper cP(λ) curve. This procedure is also called maximum power point tracking.
Going back to Fig.2.11, the variable speed concept allows the operational state to follow
the green line, in this particular case, up to a wind speed of roughly 7.5 m/s, which is where
rated rotor speed is reached.
Since maxima of the blue set of curves that show the mechanical power are rather ﬂat,
the operational characteristic curve (power vs. speed or torque vs. speed) for the generator,
sometimes called inverter curve allows some freedom to satisfy technical limitations such as
technical inertness or physical limitations such as ﬂuctuations due to turbulence. Hence the
practical inverter curve (red dashed line in Fig.2.11) can slightly deviate from exact optimal
curve (green).
To summarize, control philosophy below rated is as follows: Power transfer from wind
to rotor depends on rotational speed. The generator is used as an electromagnetic brake
to control rotational speed such that the power harvest is maximum. This way electrical
power is produced. At a given time t the state of the turbine is deﬁned by the rotational
speed. Using measured rotational speed the brake torque of the generator is chosen such that
the power taken form the wind is maximum. This is realized by so called “inverter curve”
based on the conclusions from Fig.2.11. The inverter curve reﬂects the properties of the
aerodynamic rotor. Task of the electrical layout is that the inverter curve can be realized by
the generator/inverter system.
2.6.2
Power Regulation by Blade Pitch
Above rated wind speed the rotor can generate more than rated power. One has to limit or
regulate the power to rated. One possibility to do so is to pitch the blade and hence change
the angle of attack and therefore local lift and drag coefﬁcients of the blade airfoils and
eventually the effective cP value of the rotor. This leads to limitation of mechanical power
and can be used to keep the power at rated. This is reﬂected in Fig.2.12 sometimes called

mussel diagram that shows the power contour as a function of pitch angle and wind speed.
The diagram is calculated from the cP(θ, λ) curves at rated rotor speed for the 2 MW wind
turbine of this book. To keep the mechanical power at 2 MW we ﬁnd that at about v = 11 m/s
the pitch angle has to increase, when the wind speed increases.
Modern large wind turbines use blade pitch to limit the mechanical power. The control
philosophy above rated is as follows: Since power transfer from wind to rotor depends on
blade pitch angle at rated power, we use rotational speed of the rotor to control the pitch
angle. This means that the rotor is kept at an (almost) ﬁxed speed, the rated speed. Hence at
a given time t the state of the turbine above rated is deﬁned by rotational speed and blade
pitch angle. Using measured rotational speed a subsequent pitch angle will be predicted (set
point) that is capable to keep the rotational speed at rated rotor speed, compare Fig.2.10.
This procedure is realized by a “control equation” that relates the actual set point of pitch
angle θsp(t) to the previous set point at earlier time t −t, where t is called sample time

of the controller. A simple example of a control equation for a so called PI control, using
proportional and integral terms, reads as follows,
θsp(t) = θsp(t −t) + [K P ((t) −(t −t)) + KI (t)t] f (θ),
(2.2)
where parameters K P and KI are freely chosen to govern the proportional and integral gain.
The speed error at time t is (t) = (t) −ref. The measured speed (t) is taken, e.g.,
at low speed shaft, and normally ﬁltered in subsequent processing, see also Fig.2.10. The
reference speed ref can be rated speed or close to it. The factor f (θ) refers to non-linearity.
Reason for this is that the power contour is steeper at high wind speed and high pitch angle
compared to small pitch angle and rated wind speed. This can be seen from inspection of
Fig.2.12. The contour lines are getting closer for θ going from zero to larger values. In the
simplest case the factor f (θ) can be chosen as a gain divisor f ∝θ−1 beyond a reasonable
minimum value for θ0 ≃2◦· · · 4◦.
In order to prevent drift and other effect of the control signals, real controllers are more
complex, however, these essential control loops are the relevant features of any controller.
2.7
Alternative Power Regulation Concepts
Before the variable speed concept has been thoroughly established, also other methods for
power regulation have been utilized. In contrast to variable speed concept, there is also a
constant speed concept. Although the constant speed concept is rather outdated, still some
wind turbines run with this concept. Using an induction generator and constant speed the
mechanical power extracted from the wind is not optimal. This concept requires the generator
to be connected to the grid directly. Since the grid has a ﬁxed frequency so the generator
has to have a nearly constant speed.
At and above rated, another possibility to limit the power is by using the stall effect.
This requires a particular design of the blades. The physics effect behind is as follows: If a
certain wind speed is reached the (otherwise avoided) stall effect sets in and torque remains
constant or nearly constant while thrust further increases. However, since from a certain
size of the turbine the loads on the blades and the thrust on the turbine through stall effect
is getting rather large, so that the structure becomes expensive, stall regulation is limited to
wind turbines with maximum rated power of 1 · · · 1.5 MW.

Operational States
Tooperateawindturbineautomatically,safetyforhuman,machineandenvironmentrequires
installation of two independent systems: (1) Safety system, (2) Operating system. There is a
hierarchy required for these systems, namely that operations of the safety system are superior
to the operating system at all times.

Modern Wind Turbines
Operationofawindturbinetypicallydistinguishesbetweenaboutsevenmajoroperational
states. These are collected in Table2.1. Idling is a state in case wind too high, v ≥vout, or too
low, v ≤vin. Production is referred to as normal operation of the wind turbine between wind
speeds of vin < v < vout. Stop is a normal stop and could come in several variants in terms
of stop speed by controller or manual action. An Emergency stop is usually triggered by the
safety chain, automatically or by pushing the emergency stop button. Start is a transient state
running up the rotor and connecting the generator to the grid. Waiting for wind is a stationary
state when wind speed is too low for start and too high for stop. Service is stationary state
initiated manually to maintain the turbine.
The task of the controller is to automatically switch between all those states, if not
prohibited by the hierarchy requirements mentioned above. The latter is the case, if the
turbine was stopped by the safety system. In this case the wind turbine has to be reset
manually. To this end authorized service personnel has to visit the wind turbine site, check
the reason for trip of safety chain, and reset the system manually.

In order to operate the wind turbine automatically quite some operational data are pro-
cessed by the control unit. The control functions may govern or otherwise limit functions
or parameters. To this end sensors are employed. Operational data are rotational speed,
electrical power, wind speed, generator temperature monitoring, condition of the braking
equipment, wind direction including alignment to the wind direction, grid voltage, grid fre-
quency, faults in machinery components as well as faults in electrical components such as
short circuit and overload to name a few.

2.8.1
Safety System
Basis of the safety system is a safety concept. The safety concept is a part of the system
concept intended to ensure that in the event of a malfunction the wind turbine remains in a
safe condition. If any malfunction occurs it is the task of the safety system to ensure that the
installation behaves in accordance with the safety concept. Examples for safety concepts
are: Single failure concept or redundancy concept.
The safety system is the hardware and the logics realized in a particular turbine to follow
the safety concept. It is intended to keep the installation in a safe condition and is logically
super ordinate to the control system. The safety system has to be activated after safety-
relevant limiting values have been exceeded and/or if the control system is incapable of
keeping the installation within the normal operating limits.
Further on the safety system should not be overwritten at any time, neither manually
nor automatically. The safety system has to be protected against unauthorized access. The
safety system must be fail safe. Components have be doubled or otherwise constructed in
a fashion that allows functioning under all circumstances. And last but not least, the safety
system should superseed the controller.
Safety relevant limiting values are related to operation parameters that are monitored
during operation, i.e., rotational speed, power, short circuit in the electrical power system,
mechanical shock, cable twisting, malfunctioning of control system, emergency push button
released.
In practice there are more relevant processes related to the safety of a wind turbine
system. Those processes that are accompanying the development are: Health, Safety and
Environment (HSE) process initiated in order to omit risks for people safety, environment,
work conditions, etc. A Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (D-FMEA) is performed
to omit possible failure risks related to design and choice of components and systems and
last but not the least modern wind turbine design is governed by a Quality Management
System (QMS) to ensure realization of all the concepts related to quality of the processes in
the most general fashion, e.g., according to ISO 9001:2015.
2.9
Why All Utility-Scale Wind Turbines Look Similar
Most of the wind turbines installed nowadays are of lift-type and have nearly horizontal axis
and three blades. Is this just lack of innovation in wind turbine manufacturers or is there a
technical reason for this? In fact there are good reasons why almost all wind turbines use
this conﬁguration.
Firstly, horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) with aerodynamically well designed rotor
blades have a high power efﬁciency cP. The value cPmax = 0.5 reached by this type can
not be reached with other concepts so easily.

34
2
Modern Wind Turbines
Secondly, the rotor has a relatively small amount of aerodynamically inactive material.
Only a small hub is needed to keep the blades in position. Only a small area near the center
which is about 1% of the rotor disk is not active. This also means that with little amount of
structural material (the hub) really long aerodynamically active elements (the blades) can
be kept in their position.
Thirdly, the high cP can be achieved with relatively little amount of material (blades)
extracting wind power from a large area (rotor area). The area covered by the blades divided
by the rotor area is called the solidity. Lower solidity is one of the main trends in blade
design during the last 10 years or so. By using carbon ﬁber in highly loaded parts of the
blades and/or optimizing structural concepts, the blades are not only much longer but also
more slender than 10–20 years ago. The solidity of the rotors is decreasing. In this way
speciﬁc costs of the rotor per area have been reduced. Solidity is the essential parameter for
cost reduction.
The question which number of blades is suitable, three, two, or even just one, is an old
one. From the mechanical point of view there is a big difference between two and three
blades. Technically speaking, the three-bladed rotor (also rotors with more blades) has the
same inertia with respect to any axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This is not the
case for the two-bladed rotor. Therefore three blades are dynamically more benign than two.
This is most probably the main reason, why almost all wind turbines have three blades.
Another reason for three instead of two blades is the tip speed. Using two blades with the
same dimensions as for three baldes the solidity of the rotor is reduced and the tip speed has
to go up. This causes more noise and poses an environmental challenge for wind turbines
at least on land. In spite of this, there are the famous early two-bladed experimental wind
turbines1 and also new proposals for wind turbines with two blades.
In conclusion, the present day wind turbines are the result of a development over many
decades. Three-bladed wind turbines with slim blades were favored by some pioneers as
early as in the 40s of the last century (Hau 2014). So it is not straightforward to present a
better concept.
An alternative that also comes with high cP and low solidity is the lift-type VAWT. There
are new attempts to push the vertical-axis type for offshore application. The most important
advantage of the VAWT is that they operate on any wind direction while the HAWT the rotor
axis has to be aligned to the wind direction. On the other hand, the structural parts needed
to form the rotor with an area comparable to a HAWT become large and heavy. Structural
dynamics will be an issue and it might be challenging to create an economic design for a
large VAWT to compete with the present-day HAWT.
A potential alternative that may come up in the future is kites. Stated in a simpliﬁed
fashion the kite is a single blade held in aerodynamically position by cables. The power
generation system is located on the ground. Compared to nowadays wind turbines the kites
do not need a tower and foundation, and the nacelle must not be lifted on top of the tower.
This means a lot of savings and potentially lower cost of energy. The drawback of the kite is
the missing stability that is provided by the tower. The kite must not get off control, hit the

ground and get damaged. A long-term (many years) automatic operation for a kite power
plant has not yet been demonstrated.
2.10
Some Recent Wind-Industry Trends
During the past 20 years or so wind industry developed from small businesses to mature
medium size companies. For example the number one OEM in the western world, Vestas
from Denmark, has revenues of 17 Bill. USD and 30.000 employees in 2020. Since 2000
the revenues have grown by a factor of 17. In Denmark and Germany wind industry has
become a major factor on the job market having created many thousands of well paid jobs.
If it comes to technical trends, quite obviously, wind turbines have grown in size. In
2000 the typical wind turbine had a power rating of 2 MW and a rotor diameter of 80 m.
Recent new types for installation on land have a power rating of 5 MW and a rotor diameter
of 150 m. The growth in size comes along with a reduction of cost of energy which is the
driving force behind this development. For the wind turbines of the 2020s there is a clear
distinction between land-based machines and offshore models. New offshore models have
a rotor diameter of 200 m and more and power ratings around 10 MW. These turbines are
developed only for offshore wind farms while the the prototypes used for certiﬁcation and
tests is usually installed at a site on land where the logistic issues with large and heavy
components can be solved.
2.10.1 Trend to Lower Specific Power
A trend that is also very essential is the development of the speciﬁc power during these
years. The speciﬁc power is the power rating of the wind turbine divided by the rotor area. If
we calculate this quantity for the two land based models mentioned in Sect.2.11 we obtain
400 W/m2 for the small one and 280 W/m2 for the large one. A lower speciﬁc power means
a lower rated wind speed, in other words at a site with a certain mean wind speed the time
span while rated power is generated is larger for lower speciﬁc power. A quantity that is
important for any power plant is the capacity factor simply deﬁned as the average power
produced during the year divided by rated power. At a given site lower speciﬁc power leads
to higher capacity factor which, in other words, means that the power plant is utilized to a
higher degree. Sometimes it is stated that wind turbines are more efﬁcient now than 20 or 30
years ago. But in the sense that thermal losses are lower or aerodynamic efﬁciency is higher
this is not correct. It is simply that the capacity is higher and the electrical energy produced
per MW installed is larger.
2.10.2 Cost of Energy
What does this mean for the cost of energy? If a larger rotor is used the blades are more
expensive, the investment becomes larger, and the cost of energy might be the same or

36
2
Modern Wind Turbines
even higher than before. This is not the case since the trend towards larger rotors and lower
speciﬁc power has been accompanied by the development of slimmer blades. The cost of
blades is largely determined by the amount of material that is used for the shell and the
internal structure. Besides the length the other main dimension is the chord length which
varies along the blade. An important result of the aerodynamic optimization is that one can
reach a high power coefﬁcient for different chord length functions. For smaller chord length
the rotor speed or, in other words, the tip-speed ratio has to be higher at a certain wind speed.
A smaller chord length with same relative thickness means that the blade will be lighter than
the one with larger chord length. Of course, this cannot be continued beyond a certain limit
which is set by the stability of the blade and its bending when subject to extreme loading.
During the years the blade structural design has been optimized and better materials and
manufacturing procedures are used such that blades are slimmer now. Longer and slimmer
blades that lead to lower speciﬁc power used lead to higher capacity factor and lower cost
of energy.
2.10.3 Trend to High Onshore Towers
One important challenge for a wind turbine concerns the hub height. The hub height is
mainly determined by the tower height. The mean wind speed increases with increasing
height above ground. The vertical wind gradient depends on the roughness of the surface.
For a smooth surface, e.g., above water the wind speed approaches its surface-independent
value (the so-called geostrophic wind) more quickly than for rough surfaces, e.g., on land
with trees or other objects that are obstacles for the air ﬂow near the surface. As a result,
the hub-height for offshore turbines relative to the rotor diameter is lower than for onshore
installations. The lower speed near the surface also means higher turbulence which is also
detrimental for wind turbines. Onshore attractive hub heights are equal or more than the
rotor diameter which means 150 m and more for the wind turbine of the early 2020s. As
mentioned in Sect.2.4 for the popular tubular steel tower there is a limit due to logistic
reasons. Sufﬁciently high towers can be built in form of lattice of concrete-steel hybrid
towers. As lattice towers are considered unsightly by many people there has been a trend to
high hybrid towers during recent years.
2.10.4 Other Trends
There are a number of other important trends to be mentioned. Control of wind turbines
has been improved considerably in recent years. Whereas 20 years ago transient opera-
tional states like starts and stops where running rough with wind turbine towers vibrating,
these procedures are very smooth nowadays. Further improvements can be achieved by
more sophisticated control procedures like individual blade pitch and using remote sensing
methods with LiDAR for short-term prediction of the wind speed. All this leads to reduced

2.11

37
vibrations and to lower loading of the structure. Since fatigue loading is often sizing the
components of wind turbines, the improved controllers lead to lighter components and lower
costs.
Advanced digitization leads to more information about the machines and can be used for
remote control. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are implemented
to organize the data for high level supervision.
Another trend in wind industry is improved service for wind turbines. OEM are offer-
ing customers long-term warranty and service agreements. This mitigates the risk for the
investors and increases the value created for the OEM.
2.10.5 Onshore and Offshore
So far we have not much explicated on differences between wind turbines sites on land
and those in the sea. To date all offshore wind turbines that are fabricated on an industrial
scale have three blades and also otherwise use the same concepts as their counterparts on
land. There is only a growing difference concerning the size of machines. The present day
onshore turbines have a power rating of 5 MW while the offshore turbines have 10 MW.
Further, while on land gearboxes in the main drive train with high-speed generators are the
dominating technology, the trend for offshore the wind turbines is a gear-less drive train.
For more details we refer to Ritschel (2020).

Wind Turbines Used for Illustration in This Book
The 2 MW wind turbine used for illustration in this book is a geared machine using the 3-
point concept for the rotor bearing. The turbine was developed in the years 2009–2010 and
built under a license agreement by the Chinese company Geoho. The authors participated in
the development project and have permission to use design documents. Further the authors
have permission on a set of photographs illustrating the wind turbine components and the
assembly process. Figure2.13 shows a wind farm in China, wherein a total of almost 500
wind turbines of this type and variants thereof have been installed. The nacelle of this type
of wind turbine is completely assembled before installation takes place in a wind farm. To
this end, all the components and systems have to be delivered to the assembly hall of the
OEM. A few components at different assembly stages are shown in Fig.2.14.

Development Process and Requirements
In the early days wind turbines were developed by small teams in small companies. Often
startups pursued new concepts, developed a prototype and tried to market their product.
Nowadays there are still new ideas and startups in the wind industry but the mainstream
is different. The industry is dominated by relatively large companies with thousands of
employees and several hundred engineers. The product development process (PDP) in this
case needs to be well structured. Many different departments of a company have to contribute
and cooperate in an efﬁcient manner. In a highly competitive environment the speed of
product evolution has been important in recent years. Wind turbines are still growing in
size. Digitalization is of growing importance. Consequently, the speed with which new
types of wind turbines are brought to the market is pivotal to keep up with the competition.
The basic ideas of the PDP as brieﬂy described here originated from other industries like
automotive and has been adapted to wind. Further in this section, we are looking at the
engineering process as such, certiﬁcation as an important additional task in the PDP and
other requirements for the development.
The topics discussed in this chapter could ﬁll alone a book. The details are important
in the industrial environment. However, in the present text we want to focus on the wind
turbine technology as such, the design of the components and the strength analyses that are
normally done by the OEMs. So the topics in this chapter are reported in rather concise
form.
3.1
Modern Development Process
In an industrial company many different aspects have to be taken into account when a
new product is developed. A number of different units like sales, manufacturing, service,
engineering, procurement, ﬁnance/controlling and others have to contribute and cooperate.
Systematic management and documentation of the process plays a key role. In large com-

panies this is done in the framework of a structured product development process which
consists of a time line with the tasks of different units. The time line is grouped in phases
like planning phase, concept phase, design phase, prototype phase, etc. So step by step the
future product becomes more detailed. Each of the partial processes has its time schedule
and milestones. At some point in the process also external parties have to be involved like
for example component suppliers and a certiﬁcation body. Certiﬁcation is an important part
of the development process and will be discussed separately in Sect.3.3.
The duration of the process is up to ﬁve years depending on the novelty of the design in
the context of the ﬁrm. Sometimes only a variant of a already existing turbine, sometimes
a radically new design is developed. An important task for the project management is that
activities are synchronized periodically in the course of the process. This can be done
for instance in form of gate reviews after each phase. A scheme illustration the product
development process is depicted in Fig.3.1.
In Fig.3.1 the milestones are symbolized by the black triangles (contents is not further
speciﬁed). The gate reviews after each phase are symbolized by the diamonds.
During the ﬁnal phases the prototype of the new turbine type is built and during the
industrialization phase requirements for a series production are established. An important
result of the engineering process is the bill of material which contains all components of the
product from large main components to small bolts and nuts.
Important in the project plan is the critical path. It is the sequence of tasks built upon each
other that determine the overall duration of the projects. For wind turbines the critical path is
often determined by main components and their delivery times. Since the main components
often integrate many functions, it takes a great deal of time and work to obtain the ﬁnal
design. At the same time these components have a long order time. Such components are
called long-lead items. For instance lead times for components made from cast iron (see
Sect.5.1.1) may be one year, rotor blades if not already existing may even take longer.

3.2
Engineering Process
45
Important documents resulting from the PDP are speciﬁcations. On the one side there
are requirement speciﬁcations which contain the features of a system or a component. The
requirement speciﬁcation contains the loading of the system or component, the external
conditions under which it has to function, and also for example standards according to which
it must be developed. But it may also include requirements from other processes. In brief,
the requirement speciﬁcation says “what is needed.” Taking into account the requirements,
on the other side the feature speciﬁcation contains a description of the component or system
and explains “how it is done”.
The requirement speciﬁcations are mainly resulting from the engineering process.
Addressees can be colleagues in the same company working on the same project or external
suppliers.
3.2
Engineering Process
In the PDP process the result of the planning phase is a description of the key data of the
wind turbine, rotor diameter, power rating and some basic concepts (see, e.g., Sect.4). Early
in the concept phase or even in the planning phase one starts with a ﬁrst CAD design and
load simulations. In the course of the engineering project then an iterative procedure follows.
With the loads stability analyses for components are carried out. Further in the project input
from the other processes has to be included. Based on this design changes have to be made
which leads to a updated simulation model. Depending on the starting point, the degree of
novelty of the systems, a certain number of iteration steps have to be made. The ﬁnal result
of this procedure is the design of the prototype, consisting of drawings of all parts, a bill
of material, speciﬁcations and documents for certiﬁcation (see Sect.3.3). In fact, the type-
certiﬁcation procedure can start well before the ﬁnal results are obtained. It is reasonable to
certify the loads before the ﬁnal stability analysis is done.
Designing the wind turbine is part of the engineering process. Important tools here are:
• A software tool for carrying out simulations. Modern simulation codes allow to model the
complete wind turbine from rotor blades to foundation and the elasticity of the supporting
soil. External forces by wind and (offshore) waves as well as structural vibrations are
taken into account. The model can be used on the one hand to study and optimize the
control procedures of the turbine in various operational situations. On the other hand the
model allows to calculate sectional loads in blades, drive train, tower and the foundation.
The simulated loads are the basis for the design. It is the only quantitative information
that is available at this point. A simulation tool for this purpose is, e.g., Flex5 originally
developed by Stig Øye at the DTU.
• A tool for 3D computer-aided design. With modern design tools one can systematically
develop the components in 3-dimensional fashion and assemble the system. The design
can be made more and more detailed, starting with a rough geometry, adding step by step

virtual prototyping, see text
smaller details like bolt holes. From the design model drawings and also visualizations
of the turbine or parts of it can be made. A tool for this purpose is, e.g., the commercial
software Solidworks.
• Stability analysis of components is another essential task in the engineering process. In
general the stability has to be proven with respect to ultimate (also called extreme) loads
and fatigue loads. For the stability analysis we need the geometry of the component, the
material parameters like yield strength and the loading obtained by simulation. Nowadays
main components are analyzed with ﬁnite-element methods. A software used for this
purpose is, e.g., ANSYS which is widely used in wind industry.
As shown in Fig.3.2 the three basic tasks in the engineering process are simulation,
design and analysis.
3.3
Standards,Guidelines,Certification
The engineering process takes place within the framework of standards and guidelines.
Roughly speaking the standards contain rules that have to be obeyed but leave some freedom

The idea behind the procedure is that the wind turbine developed should be safe in various
respects. The turbine as such should not fail when used in the planned way and it should be
possible to operate it without major repairs for 20 or 25 years up to wear parts that have to be
replaced. Another aspect is personal safety. When people are servicing a wind turbine they
should work in a safe environment. Most of the time wind turbines are operating without

people in the machine or nearby. But of course there is an overlap between personal safety
and technical safety.
The wind energy standards have a long history and have evolved in form of many revisions
over the years. In the past national standards played an important role. An example is the
Danish Standard DS472 that had to be followed for many wind turbine projects in the 80s and
90s of the last century when Denmark was the forerunner in wind energy utilization. During
the past 20 years the international wind turbine standard IEC 61400 became more and more
important. For many parts of the world and locations onshore and offshore wind turbines
have to be developed according to the IEC standard in order to get a type certiﬁcation and
to become bankable. The IEC 61400 has recently been integrated into a new set of standard
that goes under the name IEC RE for renewable energies. Important for the designer of a
wind turbine are
• IECRE OD-501 Edition 2.0 for type and component certiﬁcation,
• IEC 61400-1 for land based wind turbines,
• IEC 61400-2 for small wind turbines, and
• IEC 61400-3 for offshore wind turbines.
The standards 61400-1 to 3 formulate design requirements in a relatively broad sense. For
instance also wind conditions that one has to assume and load situations in which the wind
turbine has to be studied are described. So-called wind turbine classes are deﬁned on the
basis of a certain range of wind speeds and turbulence intensities for which the turbine is
designed. Further requirements concern the design of all parts of the wind turbine and the
safety system. We are not going into the details here. The standard on design requirements is
accompanied by many other more speciﬁc standards that are treating particular technologies.
The initial document in the list above, superior to the others, concerns the certiﬁcation
process as such. The engineering team that designs the wind turbine is mainly involved in the
type certiﬁcation, i.e. a certain design (type) is checked by a second party, the certiﬁcation
body. The certiﬁcation body needs an accreditation for this work. The type certiﬁcation
consists of several different actions.
First of all the design is checked as long as the wind turbine only exists on the paper (or
on the computer) in form of drawings, speciﬁcations, and reports on operation, control and
safety, loads and stability analyses. After the design has been approved or during the assess-
ment when one has sufﬁcient conﬁdence in ones own work, the prototype can be fabricated.
Testing the prototype, evaluating the manufacturing process and the quality management are
further steps of the type certiﬁcation. As sketch of a possible ﬂow chart, when development
and certiﬁcation go hand-in-hand is shown in Fig.3.3.
Very important are data from the prototype. It is the ﬁrst time the developer has the real
machine and not its virtual counterpart. In the measurement many quantities are recorded
for some time, normally for one year or so. Recorded quantities are power, rotor speed,
blade pitch angle, yaw angle, and others. Wind speed and direction are not recorded at the

wind turbine but at a nearby met mast. Each wind turbine has devices to measure wind speed
and direction on the roof of the nacelle but due to the inﬂuence of the rotor the data are too
much distorted. With the data from the prototype and mast one can check the performance
of the wind turbine. Very important are the measured power curve and the functionality of
the controller. Also loads are measured. This is done indirectly with strain gauges. Strain
gauges that are attached to the surface of structural parts like blades, shafts, tower and others
allow to determine bending moments which, as stated in Chap.2, are often important for
the sizing of the components. In this way the measurement closes the cycle. Simulated data
which up to this point are often called load assumptions are validated by the measurements.
Project certiﬁcation is sometimes done in larger wind farm projects. Almost all offshore
wind farms go through a project certiﬁcation. The purpose of this action is that a second
party checks all assumptions and derived data that result from the project development.
An example is the wind turbine as such. It has a certain type certiﬁcation, loads have been
calculated for speciﬁc site conditions. So one task for the project certiﬁcation is to compare
the simulated loads as basis for the design with the real loads that are expected for the given
project. For offshore wind turbines it is even more difﬁcult since waves also have an impact
on the loading of the system. So to carry the load comparison is a part of the certiﬁcation
process.
An important role is also played by guidelines. Guidelines are issued, e.g., by certiﬁcation
bodies or other associations. A guideline that has been used a lot in wind industry is the one
of the former German Lloyd, often called the GL guideline (DNV GL 2010). Since many
years the German Lloyd is accredited for the certiﬁcation of wind turbines among other
activities. In 2013 it merged with the Scandinavian certiﬁcation body Det Norske Veritas.

3.4
Load Cases,Ultimate and Fatigue Loads
49
The GL guideline is more comprehensive than the IEC standard, something like a hand book
for the development of wind turbines. In a wind turbine development project the guideline
is often used in combination with the standard.
In recent years personal safety become a more and more important topic. There is a
certain overlap of issues between technical safety (which is required by IEC 61400) and
personal safety. But there are also many other aspects of personal safety that are not touched
upon by the IEC standard. There was a discussion over several years whether wind turbines
are machines comparable to other industry products like vacuum cleaners or dish washers.
Finally for the European Union it was decided that the wind turbine is a functional machine
for which a declaration of conformity to the machine directive 2006/42/EC in combination
with EN 50308 has to be stated. As a result the manufacturer can use the CE mark (accord-
ing to Regulation (EC) No 765/2008). With the CE mark, the manufacturer conﬁrms the
conformity of the machine with regard to the applicable European, i.e., EU directives and
the implementation of all conformity assessment procedures prescribed for the machine.
The general requirements with a focus on the protection of employees are aimed at avoid-
ing risks to health and safety. Among other things, the standard regulates door openings,
access routes, ﬂoors, platforms and railings, ladders with fall protection, passage and work
areas, attachment points and handles, lighting, protection of moving parts, protection against
electrical hazards, as well as noise levels and thermal insulation. It also includes statements
on climbing equipment, moving parts of protective and blocking devices, emergency stops,
power shutdowns, ﬁre protection and warning signs. It is true that EN 50308 is not a harmo-
nized standard within the meaning of the Machinery Directive, i.e., there is no presumption
of conformity. However, it claims to take in, if possible, the ways to access the wind turbine,
the tower, the nacelle, and the hub should be easy to reach and working there should be
comfortable as much as possible.
3.4
Load Cases,Ultimate and Fatigue Loads
In Sect.3.2 we have mentioned the simulation model. The model is good to study the system
in operating situations and get realistic results for the loads. The question here is: What
kind of situations should be studied? To answer this question we have to consult the IEC
standard. It contains a list of so-called design load cases (DLC) for which the model has to
be analyzed. The list is divided in eight different groups which are named:
1. Power production
2. Power production with occurrence of failure
3. Start up
4. Normal shut down
5. Emergency shut down
6. Parked

7. Parked with occurrence of failure
8. Transport, assembly, maintenance and repair.
The procedure is illustrated in Fig.3.4. A simulation model has to be combined with the
proper loads cases to arrive at the design loads for a particular wind turbine. We are not
going into further details on the simulation model to load cases of the guideline here. About
20 years ago a complete set of load cases consisted of about 100 situations. Nowadays the
number can be in the order of 10 Thousands. The result of the simulation are time series of
loads and other relevant parameters of the turbine. Duration of one time series is in many
cases 10 min with a temporal resolution of some milliseconds. Loads cases with transient
events are sometimes shorter or longer depending on the situation. When we talk about loads
here in this Section we mean the mechanical sectional loads that are sizing the components.
Full information on loading of the structure is provided by six components, i.e., three forces
and three moments. When we consider, e.g., a shaft we have the axial force and two off-
axial components, and, in addition, we have the torsional moment and two bending moments.
When these sectional loads are known, an analysis of the shaft can be done.
Time series from simulation are analyzed with respect to extreme (or ultimate) and fatigue
loads. What are ultimate loads? During its service life the wind turbine has to withstand
extreme situations with high wind speeds, strong gusts, and (offshore) high waves. Extreme
loads could also occur in other situations like certain failures during operation. An example
is a grid or load loss during operation which should not lead to any damage. The philosophy
concerning these events is that extreme situations that might occur with a frequency of once
per 50 years should be survived by the system. So one can regard the ultimate-load situations
as rare or even singular events during the service life of the turbine.
The results of the analysis are presented in form of a matrix. In its diagonal the matrix
contains the ultimate loads. Tables of this type are provided in Tables3.1, 5.2, 6.4, and
7.2. There are two ﬁgures in each ﬁeld, one for the upper and one for the lower ultimate
value. Loads are in general not symmetric with respect to changing “+ sign” to “- sign”. The
horizontal lines in the matrix contain the values of other components at the same time when
the ultimate value occurred, called simultaneous components. The ﬁgures extracted from
simulation have to be multiplied by safety factors. The motivation for these factors is that
ﬁrstly we are working with a model and the reality will be somewhat different, and secondly
the results depend to a certain extent on statistics. The turbulent wind in combination with

3.4
Load Cases,Ultimate and Fatigue Loads
51
Table 3.1 Extreme loads at hub center R rotating coordinate system. Safety factors included as
indicated in column SF, see text
structural dynamics of the system leads to a stochastic time series of loads. To cover both
effects a safety factor of 1.35 is used, 35% higher ultimate loads that simulated. This is the
factor for “normal” load cases that may occur under normal operating conditions. One has
to apply a factor of 1.1 for “abnormal” load cases which have a lower probability to occur.
Additional information in the matrix on the left side shows the coding for the load case were
the ultimate value occurred and in the right column the wind speed in this moment of time.
The result for such a matrix is provided in Table3.1. It was obtained for the 2 MW wind
turbine and provides loads for the center of the hub. It is an important point in the model of
the turbine that essentially consists of an elastic beam that connects the tower axis and the
the blade axes. Loads at this point are used to size main shaft, machine frame, main bearing
and its housing as well as the gearbox.
The second analysis that needs to be done is with respect to fatigue loads. The varying
loads occurring every day, sometimes with higher, sometimes with lower range of change.
In this way damage is accumulating over the years. It has been mentioned already in the
summary that wind turbines see a large number of such load ﬂuctuations compared with
other machines. So analysis with respect to fatigue is essential.
At this point we have to dig a little deeper into this matter. From the simulation model
we obtain loads. What we have to analyze to assess fatigue is stress (S) in materials. For
relevant materials an S(N) curve is available. It describes how many load cycles (number
N) can be tolerated before a crack appears. A crack can proceed quickly to total failure of
a component. So cracks should not occur in any structural component over the service life
time.

52
3
Development Process and Requirements
A method to proceed from time series of loads to stress ﬂuctuations and fatigue is as
follows. For the component under investigation an FE model is used. Reference load cases
are calculated with a certain value of the six load components (e.g. unit loads) which leads
to a stress tensor for this speciﬁc situation. Then at points for which fatigue is presumably
high the actual stress tensor, in fact, the time series for it, is obtained by linear superposition
of the reference cases. From the time series fatigue damage can be obtained with the critical
plain method, see, e.g, Barkey and Lee (2012).
Fatigue can be obtained for a single time series. What we want is fatigue for the service
life of the turbines. This sounds tedious but in fact it is straightforward. According to wind
frequency and other input one can extrapolate the damage from a set of time series to
the complete service life. The key property of fatigue is linear accumulation. The damage
related to certain operating situation can be multiplied by a factor to take into account the
total amount of time the turbine operates in this situation and damage values of different
situations can be simply added. The additional input needed is the wind speed distribution
for one year.
3.5
Vertical Integration of Manufacturing in Wind Industry
Vertical integration means that the whole supply chain or parts of it is owned by the OEM.
The wind turbine consists of a multitude of large and small components, so it is not realistic
to operate a company that is 100% vertically integrated. But by manufacturing blades, the
tower, the generator of a direct-drive concept, and some more items, the share of the total
value is quite high already. There are pros and cons on a high degree of vertical integration.
The wind turbine is a highly complex system. Key components and systems contribute to
the dynamics of the whole system and the response to controller activities. So the in-depth
knowledge and understanding of all relevant parts of the system is important. There are also
economic reasons pro and contra vertical integration. A compact overview of respective
advantages is given in the list below.

As in many cases there is no simple answer to the question about vertical integration. As
a consequence there are examples among wind turbine OEMs with very different strategies
in that respect. There has been a clear trend over the last two decades or so to higher

3.5
Vertical Integration of Manufacturing in Wind Industry

vertical integration in wind industry. In the earlier days until about the year 2000 many
OEM only assembled the nacelle in a manufacturing facility. Virtually all parts needed for
nacelle and hub were purchased from suppliers. Also blades were bought from independent
blade manufacturers. Even the controller hardware and software, so to say the brains of the
turbine, were sourced from specialized suppliers. As the market volume was growing the
OEM realized that strong dependence on external suppliers, especially when it comes to
the key components, can be dangerous. In a situation with growing demand on the market,
e.g., a blade supplier effectively determines how many pieces the OEM can sell. As a
consequence, many OEM started their own blade development and manufacturing activities.
Also the controller, at least the controller software, was declared as a key competence by
many OEM. Other key components are discussed in the following list:
• Hub and machine frame are either made from cast iron (see Sect.5) or in case of the
machine frame sometimes also a welded design is used. Most OEM purchase these items
from a foundry or a metal processing company. Most of these suppliers are independent.
On the other hand the German OEM Enercon, well-known for high vertical integration,
operates its own foundry.
• There are large bearings as main, yaw and pitch bearings in the system. These bearings
are fabricated with high precision, materials need special treatment, such that the bearings
are normally sourced from independent suppliers
• The gearbox in the main drive train (not in direct-drive concepts) is a highly sophisticated
component. There is a number of gearbox manufacturers for whom wind gearboxes are
not the only but an important market. Concerning selection, treatment and machining of
materials know-how and precision machinery is needed. The gearbox plays an important
role for the drive-train dynamics in interplay with other components like rotor blades
and the generator. Further the loading of the gearbox, especially the off-axial loads, need
to be known and communicated to the gearbox manufacturer. So a detailed requirement
speciﬁcation is needed and a close cooperation between supplier and OEM has to be
established.
• The generator of a geared wind turbine is a standard industrial product that in princi-
ple as a very similar design is also used (often as a motor) for other purposes. This
is different for direct-drive turbines. In this case the generator is a multi-pole machine
exclusively designed for wind turbines. The worldwide most successful OEM with direct-
drive concepts (Enercon from Germany and Goldwind from China) fabricate the gen-
erator in-house. But there are also direct-drive designs offered by electrical machinery
manufactures like ABB and Siemens.
• Inverters in the power generation system are also key components of nowadays utility-
scale wind turbines. Often they are provided by the suppliers of the generator. The inter-
play between generator and inverter is controlled by the inverter software which in most
turbines is not to the full extent running on the main controller. So it is reasonable that
the system, generator, inverter, and other components, are from the same source.

54

Development Process and Requirements
• The tower has a big impact on the structural dynamics. Vibration frequencies of the tower
have to be tuned to values that are not in conﬂict with multiples of the rotor frequency.
As a consequence, the tower is often developed by OEMs while it is fabricated by a
specialized steel processing company (in case of a tubular steel tower).
• Rotor blades and the main controller have been discussed brieﬂy already above in this
Section.
Depending to a large extent on the policy of an OEM and to some extent also on the concepts,
the strategies concerning vertical integration are very different. One strategy followed by
most big players is that, if a component is not made in-house, there should at least be two
or better three suppliers. This obviously reduces risk of dependencies.
3.6
Transport and Logistics
Components of wind turbines are large (rotor blades) and heavy (nacelle, tower sections),
see Fig.3.5. Therefore transport restrictions and logistic issues in this context have to be
discussed. If we are mainly focusing on the design of the nacelle we are talking about the
width, height and weight of the nacelle. But we are also commenting on the tower and
rotor blades. Not many components can be fabricated near wind farm sites. Hence transport,
often on roads, sometimes by other means, from factory to site needs to be planned. For the
transport special purpose vehicles are needed and permissions from the authorities have to
be asked for. Since otherwise conﬂict with normal trafﬁc would be a problem, the vehicles
are only moved during the night, accompanied by additional safety vehicles.
On roads the bottle necks are bridges. There are standards for vertical clearance of bridges
in different countries. On freeways, which are used for long distance, the clearance is 4.9 m
(or 16 ft) in the US and 4.5 m in Germany. This means that the height of a component should
not be much more than 4 m. The width might be larger but then it is an obstacle for other
trafﬁc.
Mass is also an issue. Roads and bridges are designed for a certain load capacity. Nacelle
and tower are the heaviest parts. To reduce mass and also length of individual items the
tower is divided in sections (see Sect.2.4). Also the nacelle of large wind turbines is often
modularized such that individual modules are not exceeding a certain mass. The mass limit
often depends on individual bridges, so that the transport route has to be planned carefully.
If not width or mass, it might also be just length that has a transport limit. This is the
case for rotor blades which are relatively light, even in large turbines not more than 20 t,
but long. Length is in particular an issue in curves. A method to get rid of problems with
length is blade division. If the rotor blades were designed in two or more sections (like the
tower), this problem would be solved. There are many ideas for divided blades, but it is
more challenging to make divided blades compared with tower sections. Thus, so far most
blades are fabricated and transported in one piece. But whereas one thought some ten years

and rotor blades, transport during nights only (lower)
ago a blade length of 60 m for wind farms on land would be the maximum, we see now
blades with 70 m and more. So the length limit has been pushed further by using improved
transport vehicles and planning the routes very carefully.
The discussion in this section holds mainly for wind turbines on land. For offshore
machines there are different rules to be described in the next section.

56

Development Process and Requirements
3.7
Requirements for Offshore Wind Energy
Offshore wind turbines are different in some respects from the land-based cousins. One is
the size of the turbines. So far in the evolution of wind turbines larger size always meant
lower cost of energy. Provided that the large components like tower, blades and nacelle
come from a factory near a suitable harbor, size and mass limits that come from transport
on roads are absent. This is the main reason for the size difference between land based and
offshore wind turbines. There are logistic challenges as well. Cranes in the harbor need to
be suitable, quays have to be sized for heavy loads, ships and installation vessels must be
available at reasonable cost and need to have sufﬁcient capacity. For some time ago high
cost of installation vessels slowed down the realization of projects. In recent years the cost
of energy has come down to a competitive level.
A second aspect is corrosion protection that concerns all parts of the wind turbine (and
its substructure). Salty water and higher humidity are affecting the outside steel structures.
Better corrosion protection of all exterior parts needs to be better than on land. For the tower
shell this implies that coating needs to be thicker. It is slightly different to the interior of the
turbine, where some of the components emit waste heat from the surface. In a closed system
the air would heat up with time. The standard solution for wind turbines is that air from
outside is used to replace the inside air. Offshore it is not possible to use the salty outside
air directly, e.g., by simply leaving a hole in the nacelle cover (passive concept) or using
a fan (active). Before the air can be used to cool the system humidity and salt need to be
removed. The clean air then generates some over-pressure inside the turbine such that there
is a controlled inlet and at some point, e.g., the gap between nacelle cover and tower and
between spinner and nacelle cover the air leaves the interior. This air exchange concept has
nothing to do with the cooling system for gearbox and generator responsible for removing
most of the heat from the components, see Sect.10.3.
Another difference between on- and offshore concerns service work on the wind turbine.
On sea accessibility of the turbine is much more difﬁcult than on land. Access from a boat is
only possible when the waves are not too high. Depending on the location the time windows
for boat access might be small since wind speeds are generally higher offshore and high
waves are frequent. The trend here clearly is to carry people by helicopter and drop them
on a hoisting platform. The transportation and hoisting by helicopter can be carried out at
wind speeds more than 20 m/s.
For an offshore site it is important that service is planned only and unplanned repair
work remains rare if not absent. Thus, reliability of the wind turbine and all its systems has a
higher status than on land. This may be achieved by including a higher degree of redundancy.
For instance sensors needed for automatic operation can be redundant. Another strategy
to avoid unplanned service is to install condition monitoring systems. While for onshore
turbines condition monitoring is optional and not used in many turbines, for offshore sites
it is mandatory.

Drivetrain
As mentioned Sect.2.9 most wind turbines have three blades and a tower and therefore
different types of different manufacturers look very much alike. Only from the shape of the
nacelle in some cases we can suspect that internals are different. Inside the nacelle we have
the drivetrain, introduced as a system in Sect.2.2. This is where different manufacturers or
developers leave their footprint.
In this section we describe different ideas for the drivetrain. Different concepts for the
rotor bearing (also called main bearing) are described and pro and cons for the particular
solutions are mentioned. The individual components, connections between components, etc.
will be described in the subsequent sections. An excellent account on drive trains is also
given by Schaffarczyk (2014). Actually rotor blades are also part of the drivetrain. They
are very important for instance for the drive train dynamics. As mentioned already we are
not giving a detailed account on aerodynamics and blade design. We have given a short
summary on rotor blades in Sect.2.3, so the drivetrain in this section starts with the hub.
4.1
Gearbox or No Gearbox?
People often mention that all wind turbine look alike: A slim tower, three blades. It is not
easy to distinguish different brands of wind turbines. At the ﬁrst glance this is true. But
looking more carefully we see a lot of differences. Not only sizes of rotors and towers are
different. One feature that allows to distinguish wind turbines is the shape of the nacelle.
Some models have a long box shape nacelle, others have a shorter nacelle with a large
circular cross section. It is the drivetrain concept that to a certain extent determines the
shape of the nacelle.
To generate electricity or more precisely electrical power from wind we only need the
aerodynamic rotor and the electrical generator. As described previously in a large HAWT the
rotor speed is low, roughly in a range of 10–20 rpm. On the other side there are well proven

industry motor/generator concepts1 that are designed for relatively high speed. If for instance
a generator is equipped with two or three pole pairs for a 50 Hz grid it has a synchronous
speed of 1500 or 1000 rpm respectively. We call these machines high-speed generators in
the following. As we know already from Sect.2.5 the generator speed is decoupled from the
grid frequency by a converter. A machine designed for 1500 rpm will not perform well at
a much lower speed. As a consequence, if one decides to use such a generator a gearbox is
needed as schematically shown in Fig.4.1 to operate the generator at or around the design
range. The gear ratio needs to be approximately 100. It needs to convert from low speed
to high speed. Most gearboxes for other application—in cars for example—are functioning
into the other direction. As also shown in Fig.4.1 we distinguish the low-speed side of the
drive train, between rotor and gearbox, from the high-speed side from gearbox to generator.
There will be more details about gearboxes in Chap.7.
If we do not want a gearbox the generator has to be designed for the slow rotational speed.
In this case, roughly speaking, what was previously the “mechanical” gear ratio to increase
speed is now the “electrical” gear ratio, by increasing the number of pole pairs instead.
Typical direct drive generators have 50 · · · 100 pole pairs. The poles are arranged on a ring
with large diameter (5–10 m), hence, these generators are also called ring generators. In an
optimized design the diameter (perpendicular to the axis of rotation) is larger than the axial
dimension.
One of the challenges in designing direct-drive wind turbines in the arrangement of the
generator relative to the rotor and the connection with the rotor, in other words, the integration
of the generator. This will be elaborated in more detail in Sect.4.7.3.
Another idea is to choose a concept in between the high speed with gearbox and direct
drive. Then instead of three gear stages one can use one or two stages. The required generator
1 Each electrical motor can also be operated as a generator to convert mechanical into electrical power.

Hub Concept

operates at medium speed. Sometimes these concepts are called hybrid, since elements of
both, geared and direct-drive, machines are present. More on hybrid concepts is explained
in Sect.4.6.
Having described different concepts now to set up the drive train of a wind turbine,
one may ask: “What is the best solution?”. Aspects are performance, cost, and reliability.
There is no simple answer to this question. Concepts have advantages and disadvantages.
We mention some of them in the subsequent subsections.
Wind industry had a lot of problems with gearboxes in the past. Especially when wind
turbines were quickly growing in size and power rating from the late 1990s to the early
2000s manufacturers were desperately ﬁghting against premature failures of gearboxes. For
a company specializing on wind turbines with gearbox it is not an easy task to switch to direct
drive. Therefore most established OEM worked on improving their design in cooperation
with the gearbox manufacturer.
Presently the majority of wind turbines is still with gearbox and high-speed generator.
However, there is a trend towards direct drive and hybrid wind turbines. Only if we look at
the new offshore wind turbines, direct drive and hybrid are already dominating. In the long
term this will probably be the case also for wind turbines on land.
4.2
Hub Concept
The hub is the central part of the rotor that connects blades with the subsequent parts of the
drive train. It is a special component in wind turbines and highly loaded. All aerodynamic
loads on blades and in addition the weight of blades have to be supported by the hub. The
main purpose of the rotor is to generate torque that can be converted to electricity. However
(as explained in Sect.1.2.2), blades experience also thrust (force perpendicular to the rotor
plane) which can be larger then the propelling force and hence is dimensioning the hub.
Details of the design process, materials etc. of the hub are discussed in Sect.5.2. The hub is
a component that is normally designed in-house by the manufacturer of the wind turbine. It
is often also used as a housing for the pitch system.
Interfaces of the hub to other parts of the drive train are blade ﬂanges and the ﬂange that
connects, e.g., to a rotor shaft or directly to the rotor bearing. A picture of the structural part
of the hub, i.e., the hub cast, is shown in Fig.4.2 which also shows the mentioned ﬂanges.

4.3
Rotor Bearing
Independent of the fact whether there is a gearbox or not, we need a rotor bearing, often
also called main bearing. The purpose of this bearing is to keep the rotor in its position and
allow it to turn freely—there is always some friction, but it should be small—with respect
to the rotor axis. A bearing has an inner and an outer ring. One can use models with roller
elements between the rings, called roller bearings, or sliding bearings. Although sliding
bearings are often used in large machinery2 they have never been used for the rotor of wind
turbine. The reason is the loading situation. As will be explained in more detail later there
are large bending moments (see Sect.5.3.1) that have to be supported by the rotor bearing.
Sliding bearings use a thin oil ﬁlm between rings to avoid the direct contact between the
solid surfaces. This concept is less tolerant with respect to off-axial loads (see Sect.4.5).
Bearing types used for wind turbines are spherical, cylindrical or tapered roller bearings.
Some solutions frequently used in wind turbines are discussed below. In addition there are
rotor bearing concepts using a shaft and concepts using an axle. In the former case the inner
ring is rotating and the outer ring to the non-rotating structure, and in the latter case the outer
ring is rotating and the inner ring is attached to an axle.
2 For example as the bearing for ship propeller shafts sliding bearings are used.

Separated or Integrated Drivetrain
61
In wind turbines with a gearbox only shaft-type rotor bearing concepts are used. The
reason is that with an axle it is more difﬁcult to guide the torque to gearbox and generator.
On the other hand, axle-type bearings are used for several design-variants of direct-drive
wind turbines for which the generator is directly attached to the rotor.
4.4
Separated or Integrated Drivetrain
In a classical wind turbine design with gearbox the drivetrain is separated. This means that
different functionalities like rotor bearing, support of bearing, transfer of torque from rotor
to gearbox, the gearbox itself and the generator are implemented in separate components.
The separated drive train is shown in schematic form in Fig.4.3. There are two bearings
(2) that suspend the main shaft (1) and with it the rotor. The gearbox (3) is attached to the
main shaft and connected to the generator (5) by the high-speed shaft (4). Details of this
drivetrain concept and its variants will be shown later in this Sect. 4. The conclusion at this
point is that the separate drivetrain will, in general, be longer since each component needs
a certain space. The advantage is that the loading and sizing of the components in such a
design is relatively straightforward. Each component gets its own speciﬁcation and can be
purchased from specialized suppliers. The wind turbine manufacturer than has to assemble
all components to build the drivetrain.
The opposite philosophy is integration of functionalities. Two bearings can be united in
one housing. The bearing of the ﬁrst stage of the gearbox can be the main bearing at the same
time. Housings of gearbox and generator are ﬁrmly attached to each other such that no extra

high-speed shaft is needed. An example for an integrated drive train is shown schematically
in Fig.4.4. Herein the main shaft is part of the gearbox. It has also the role as the shaft of
the ﬁrst stage of the gearbox. So the housing of the gearbox and the bearing housings are
integrated in one component. Further the generator is directly ﬂanged to the gearbox. In this
way the high-speed shaft and the generator frame are not needed.
Obviously in the integrated design there are not only less components but it can also be
much shorter in the axial direction. Consequently the whole nacelle will be more compact
than in the separated design. This is quite attractive and promising with regard to potential
cost saving.
In fact, the attitude concerning integration is ambivalent in wind industry and some
integrated wind turbine designs failed or vanished from the market. The reason is that with
integration of different functions, like, for example, bearing and gearbox housing, also the
loading situation becomes more complicated. With loads from the rotor directly acting upon
the gearbox there might be deﬂections that, in turn, have impact on the contact between gear
wheels. Hence integration is a good idea in principle but needs careful consideration of the
loading situation. More detailed analyses of the multi-functional components are needed
than in the case of separated design. If these analyses are not carried out or not carried
out correctly then the OEM risks problems with the product. Therefore wind turbines with
gearboxes nowadays show often a separated or a mildly integrated design. The 3-point

4.5

concept explained in Sect.4.5.1.2 is the most important example used by many OEM. In
direct-drive wind turbine most recent designs have generator and rotor bearing integrated
(see Sect.4.7).
4.5
Wind Turbines with Gearbox and High-Speed Generator
As displayed in Fig.4.5 about 70% of the wind turbines worldwide are of this type: Gearbox
in combination with high-speed generator. In this section we describe the drivetrain concepts
of such wind turbines. The drivetrain is a system that consists of several components. The
components, or better some examples of components, will be described from Sect.5 on. In
the following we ﬁrst focus on the main bearing, also called rotor bearing concept. In the
mechanical design process the decision for a certain concept is an important step. It has
impact on costs and the assembly process. Further in this section the “rear part” of the wind
turbine will be described, i.e., the gearbox, the generator and the connection between the
two.
4.5.1
Low-Speed Side—Machine Frame and Rotor Bearing Concepts
The ﬁrst three bearing concepts described in the following can in principle be used for wind
turbines with gearbox or with direct drive. The ﬁrst two types, however, are mainly used for
wind turbines with a gearbox. The concepts with axle—sometimes also called king pin—is
only used in combination with direct-drive machine and will be described below. An account
in the literature concerning the rotor bearing issue in wind turbines is given in Hart et al.
(2020).

4.5.1.1 Two-Bearing Concept
This concept—often also called 2-point—has been used in many wind turbine and of course
also in other contexts. In one realization it consists of two bearings and a main shaft supported
by a suitable machine frame (MF). The machine frame is often also called main frame or
bed plate.
A concept design for a drive train with two bearings is shown Fig.4.6. Each bearing has its
own housing. The connection between machine frame and bearing housing is approximately
at the level of the rotor axis. This way the connection itself—one of the highest loaded bolt
connections in the wind turbine—is mainly loaded by a shear force and not by a bending
moment. Consequently, the machine frame has the shape of a trough or tub. It has to reﬂect
the tilt angle between rotor axis and the horizontal plane.
In Fig.4.6 the support structure consists of a front part for the bearings and the torque
support for the gearbox (see also Sect.4.5.2). Usually (not always) the generator is placed
on a an extra component, the auxiliary frame (also called generator frame), attached to the
machine frame. As seen in Fig.4.6 the machine frame supports the bearings and the torque.
Further in the lower part it provides ﬂanges for installing yaw drives. Since it integrates
many functions and complex loading it is often the component one has to devote a great
deal of work in the engineering process.
Concerning the manufacturing process the machine frame can be a cast or a welded
design. Due to the complexity of the geometry of the machine frame, casting has advantages
and most of the machine frames of wind turbine that are manufactured in larger numbers
are castings.
The classical concept with separate bearing housings uses spherical roller bearings (SRB)
as rotor bearing. An SRB supports radial and axial forces with respect to the rotor axis. Since
an SRB is used in the Windrad 2 MW design and also in many other wind turbine with
gearbox it will be treated in somewhat more detail in Sect.6.1 Another virtue of the SRB is
that it is self-aligning such that some miss alignment of the bearing housings relative to each
other can be tolerated. The two bearings can also be an SRB and a cylinder roller bearing.
With cylinder rollers the conﬁguration is much less tolerant. With this type of bearing the
shaft should be aligned with high precision with the bearing and its housing. The solution

then is a common housing for both bearings which reduces potential geometric deviations
and constraint forces resulting from this otherwise.
In principle also other roller bearings can be used. The requirement is only that at least
one of the two bearings has to support the thrust force (in axial direction) and both have
to support radial forces caused by the weight of the rotor and bending moments due to
aerodynamic forces on the rotor. An example for a different realization of the 2-bearing
concept are two tapered roller bearings at a distance that are prestressed against each other
in a common housing.
In the 2-bearing concept the weight of the gearbox is supported by the main shaft. Only
the torque has to be supported directly by the machine frame. So the naïve picture is that
with this concepts only torque is transferred from the rotor to the gearbox. The off-axial
loads are absorbed by the two bearing and need not to be considered for the gearbox. Why
is this picture naïve or even too naïve? The reason is that in the low-speed part of the drive
train the bearing situation is statically indeterminate. There are three points (two bearings
and the torque support) that are mounted on the machine frame and have to be aligned to
the rotor axis. Howerver, two points already deﬁne the axis and any misalignment of one of
the components with respect to the remaining one will lead to constraint forces. In addition
deﬂections due to loading during operation can lead to constraint forces as well. If this is not
under control and not taken into account in the design it may cause problems. The constraint
forces and a method to avoid or at least mitigate them in the drive train will be discussed in
more detail in Sect.7.3.
In conclusion there are advantages and disadvantages of the 2-bearing concept. Advan-
tages are:
• Long experience in wind industry and good reputation
• Various standard bearings like spherical roller bearings can be used
• With some care and additional measures only or mainly torque is transferred to the
gearbox
Disadvantages are:
• There are many components like shaft, two bearings, bearing housing, that add to the
costs of the product
• The drivetrain is relatively long in axial direction
• There are many components at or near the tower axis such that it may be difﬁcult to
create an access way from tower to nacelle that is consistent with HSE requirements (see
Sect.3.3)
• The fact that drive train suspension is statically indeterminate entails a certain risk for
this concept concerning constraint forces.

Drivetrain
4.5.1.2 Partly Integrated Concept—3-Point Suspension
On the ﬁrst glance quite similar to the previous concept is the 3-point suspension, see Fig.4.7.
In this concept there is one main bearing, an SRB, and the second main bearing of the main
shaft is absent. It is replaced by the bearing of the ﬁrst stage of the gearbox. In this way
the function of the shaft bearing and gearbox bearing (see also Sect.7.1) are integrated and
compared to the 2-point suspension one bearing and its housing are saved. The low-speed
part of the drive train is supported at three points, the shaft bearing and the two arms of the
gearbox, therefore the name 3-point suspension.
The price for saving one bearing is that on one hand loads on the gearbox are quite
different. On the other hand, constraint forces are absent. The loading situation does not
depend on the deformation of the machine frame. But now the gearbox has to support off-
axial loads from the rotor. The arms of the gearbox that in the 2-bearing concept only support
the torque are now also supporting off-axial loads. Also, the main loads from the rotor that
have to be guided to the tower are partially going through the gearbox.
Consequently, the 3-point suspension was criticized in the context of premature gearbox
failures. For some time it was unpopular in wind industry. Some manufacturers kept this
concept and worked in cooperation with gearbox manufacturers on improving the gearbox.
After a learning curve it is still used in many wind turbines nowadays. Advantages of the
concept are:
• Second shaft bearing not needed
• Standard spherical roller is used as main bearing
• Statically determinate concerning loading
• Long experience with the concept and learning curve
Disadvantages are:
• Off-axial loads on the gearbox
• Large axial dimension of drive train
The Windrad 2 MW turbine used as an example uses a 3-point suspension, Fig.4.8.

4.5.1.3 Moment Bearing
The moment bearing is quite different from the previously described 2- and 3-point bearing
concepts. Generally we need at least two support points along the shaft. As mentioned in
the context of the 2-point suspension we can have a low-speed shaft and two tapered roller
bearings. They need to be prestressed against each other. In a moment bearing the two rows
are moved close to each other while the diameter becomes larger. This way one can arrange
the two rows of roller elements in one inner and one outer ring such that the two main
bearings eventually become one component that support axial and radial forces and even the
bending moments. This is why it is called moment bearing. A simple 3D model to illustrate
the concept is shown in Fig.4.9.
If for instance the outer ring of the bearing is attached to a suitable machine frame, the
inner ring is connected with the hub on the one side and with the gearbox on the other side. A
sketch of such a conﬁguration is depicted in Fig.4.10. In the sketch a short shaft connects hub
and gearbox. One might also think of a design where the inner ring of the bearing is directly
attached, e.g., to a component of the ﬁrst planetary stage (see Fig.7.2). In such a design one
can say that the role of the main shaft is played by the inner bearing ring. Hence with such
a bearing one can save costs for other components (shaft, bearing housing). Furthermore
the nacelle can be shorter with a moment bearing since the axial distance between hub and
gearbox is smaller which has some impact on logistics. A disadvantage is that the moment
bearing is more expensive than the bearings used for the other concepts.

Fig.4.10 Sketch of drivetrain
with moment bearing
For wind turbines with gearbox the moment bearing has ﬁrst been used by Vestas in a
design with 90 m rotor and 3 MW power rating. However, this minimal design with the
gearbox directly attached to the moment bearing was not used in subsequent designs. Other
designers decided to attach a short main shaft and a low-speed shaft coupling in between
bearing and gearbox (Rachholz et al. 2012).
Using this type of bearing, the machine frame looks quite different than for the other
concepts. It is sometimes called of cradle type. The bearing ring is embedded like in a

4.5
Wind Turbines with Gearbox and High-Speed Generator
69
cradle. The frame has to provide a material efﬁcient connection between a ﬂange at the
bottom, where the yaw bearing is attached, and the ﬂange where the moment bearing is
attached.
For geared wind turbines with high speed generator the moment bearing has not been
used much. But for direct drive concepts it is used in a number of designs. Also the Eleon
wind turbine used for illustration in this book has a moment bearing.
Advantages are:
• Short in axial direction
• In principle no main shaft needed
• All loads supported by one bearing
Disadvantages are:
• Higher costs of bearing
• Connection to gearbox tricky
• Limited experience.
4.5.2
Gearbox and Its Interfaces
The key component of wind turbine with high-speed generator is the gearbox. It is also the
most expensive component of the drive train. The gearboxes with gear ratios of 100 or so
have several stages. One stage has a gear ratio in the range of four to six. Gearboxes with
three stages are very widespread. In Sect.7 more details about gearboxes will be provided.
Another important task in the design process is to connect the rotor to the gearbox. With
the two-bearing concept a frequently used solution is that the gearbox has a hollow shaft
that is slipped over the main shaft. Then the assembly is compressed with a shrink disk. The
shrink disk is usually a quite massive component that can generate a high radial force. It
will be described in more detail in Sect.7.2.
With the two-bearing concept the weight of the gearbox is carried by the main shaft and
its bearings. Therefore there is no weight carrying connection between gearbox and machine
frame. However, without any connection between gearbox and machine frame the concept
would not work. Any gearbox needs a torque support, otherwise it would simply rotate with
the speed of the main shaft. The reason is that the gearbox converts the torque from a high to
a relatively low level inversely proportional to the gear ratio. This means for the concept with
high-speed generator that almost all the torque needs to be guided from the gearbox to the
machine frame. The common concept for the torque support with the two-bearing concept
is that the gearbox housing has two arms in horizontal direction. The arms are prevented to
move up or down by elastic bearings that are inside a frame attached to the machine frame.

70
4
Drivetrain
For the 3-point suspension the main shaft is also connected with a shrink disk. But of
course in this case the ﬂow of loads is different. Not only torque has to be supported but
also the aerodynamic loads from the rotor and all weights of components, including the one
of the gearbox, that are in the low-speed part of the drive train. For the 3-point concept the
gearbox support often is also simply called torque support.
The gearbox support prevents not only vertical movement but also displacement in side-
ways direction. The thrust (and therewith movement in axial direction) is supported by the
main bearing.
In the case of the moment bearing the situation is again different. A classical shaft is not
needed. The rotating part of the ﬁrst gear stage can be connected directly to the inner ring
of the bearing. Other concepts use a shaft-like component and/or a cardanic connection to
decouple the gearbox from the main bearing and the loads from the rotor.
4.5.3
High-Speed Shaft and Connection of Gearbox and Generator
The standard solution to connect gearbox and generator is via a high-speed shaft. This
component is connected to the output shaft of the gearbox on one side and to the generator
shaft on the other side. In the separated design this connection must not be stiff in order to
avoid constraint forces. A frequently used design works with two lamellar couplings with a
light shaft made of composite materials in between. This concept is tolerant with respect to
misalignment.
In the separated design the generator is installed on special bearings that provide a ﬂexible
connection between auxiliary frame and generator and also reduces structure born sound.
There are also concepts with gearbox and high-speed generator where the generator is
directly ﬂanged to the gearbox. Then the weight of the generator is supported by the gearbox
housing.
4.5.4
High Speed Generator
High speed generators are designed not only for wind turbines but also for other industrial
applications. The design is rather straight forward and therefore high speed generators in
combination with proper gear boxes are widely used. This makes them rather attractive from
cost point of view.
Integration into the wind turbine design needs careful consideration of two interfaces: (1)
connection to high speed shaft, i.e., torque transfer, (2) mounting to auxiliary frame, which
inﬂuence the total alignment. Both interfaces are described in next Sect.5. It is advised to
check total alignment and possible imbalance after assembly is completed.
Unlike other industrial application utilized as ground based generators, design of gener-
ators for wind turbines require further attention. One is related to rather high acceleration in

4.5

71
the nacelle and another one to the efﬁciency of the generator/converter system as a whole.
Namely, it is not necessary to optimize the electrical performance at rated speed but rather
below rated speed due to the particular power characteristics of wind turbines.
Rated speed is deﬁned through grid frequency which is usually 50 or 60 Hz, or in other
units 3000 or 3600 rpm. High speed generators utilized in wind turbines usually have rated
speed half or one third of that, depending on the number of pole pairs implemented within
the electrical circuitry. The number of pole pairs is chosen with respect to the gear ratio to
end up with an economical solution for the complete drive train.
4.5.5
Drivetrain Dynamics for Wind Turbine with Gearbox
One particular requirement for certiﬁcation is the so called drive train analysis. This is
important, because of all the rotating parts inside the nacelle, which is on top of an elastic
structure, i.e., the tower. The basic idea is to identify possible resonant behavior in the
structure through start-up, stop or operation of the wind turbine. Excitation of the drive train
could be by rotor frequency or multiples of it, e.g., 1P, 3P, 6P for a three blade rotor, and
by tooth engagements wherever those occur, in particular inside the gearbox. Drive train
analyses addresses the response of the drive train as a whole and in particular within the
rotational degree of freedom. This way possible torsional vibrations can be identiﬁed and if
relevant, prevented at an early stage of development by design, by damping measures and/or
change of design parameters to shift resonances into an uncritical region.
Elements to be considered are: Blades, hub, main shaft, shrink disc, gearbox, brake disc,
high speed coupling, and the generator rotor, Fig.4.11. The whole system is embedded
into the main frame including the torque supports, the generator frame with the generator
housing/stator. Within the gearbox further rotating and supporting structures that participate

Drivetrain
in the dynamics are planetary stages consisting of ring gear, planet carrier, planet wheels, sun
wheel on the entry side and the intermediate/high speed gears including gears and pinions
at the rear side all embedded into the gear housing that is connected to the main frame via
the torque support. All parts are coupled to each other like a chain, either stiff or elastically
via force elements including stiffness and damping to build up the dynamic equation for the
torsional mode (in the simple case of one dimension). This also includes tooth engagement,
which requires notion of meshing stiffness.
From a practical point of view the challenge is to draft all the relevant parameters for
completion of the analysis. What is needed are the moments of inertia of the components,
torsional stiffness of rotating parts, meshing stiffness as mentioned above. The result will be
shown in a Campbell diagram which provides intersections between excitation frequency
(mostly given in units of rpm) and system frequencies (normally given in units of Hz).
An example of such a diagram being a part only of quite a few of those diagrams for a full
analysis is shown in Fig.4.12. Only the lower frequencies are presented here. The complete
analysis set includes frequencies up to about 500 Hz or so.
Excitation frequencies are lines through the origin with different slope depending on
the excitation mechanism: The two black solid lines are related to the rotor speed (1P and
3P), whereas the two black dashed (1P, 2P of Planet II) and dashed dotted (1P, 2P of output
shaft) lines refer to an excitation from tooth engagement. Details and nomenclature of a gear
box are described in Sect.7. The vertical black dashed dotted lines conﬁne the operational
region of the wind turbine, whereas the remaining vertical lines provide the normal shut
down speed (orange) and the one triggered by the safety chain (red). The horizontal lines
constitute the system frequencies that could possibly be excited. They emerge form a coupled
chain model of the torsional degree of freedom of the complete drive train. The modes are
simply numbered according to the eigenvalues as they appear and refer to 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.
In the legend the subindex refers to the dominating (isolated) system frequency, e.g. drive
train means torsional mode, edge/ﬂap refers to blade modes.
Focus is on the intersection between the horizontal lines (system modes) and the sloping
lines (excitation). If the wind turbine is operating close to any of those points there is
excitation possible. If this excitation is relevant or not depends on the actual dynamics of the
whole system and has to be investigated in a separate so called transient analysis. However,
most of the intersecting points are harmless, since damping is strong or coupling between
excitation and response is low. Nevertheless, if an intersection is identiﬁed that might lead
to challenges for the design, mild design changes might help, e.g., change of parameters,
meaning change of material and/or components used, change of sizes or masses. If this does
not lead to satisfactory results, from a development point of view, it might still be time for
a design change. Finally, if there is no design related solution possible additional elements
like dampers might be useful. This would/could be implemented, e.g., in blades or the tower,
depending on the actual position of the intersection, but only, if there is no other solution
available. In other cases, there might also be a software solution possible, in order to make

of the regular operational region.
4.6
Concepts with Medium Speed Generator
As explained in Sect.4.1, in a sense, a wind turbine with medium speed generator is posi-
tioned in between a classical gearbox and direct drive wind turbine. Like in case of direct

74
4
Drivetrain
drive, one has a generator with a relatively high number of pole pairs which axial dimension
is shorter than the radial one. Also the gearbox with one or two planetary stages is shorter
than the conventional three-stage gearbox. Therefor a natural design idea is to attach gearbox
and generator directly to each other or even integrate them into a common housing.
There have been a number of wind turbine designs to exploit advantages of the medium
speed concept. A famous design with a long history in wind industry is the multibrid concept.
The multibrid design consists of a so-called 1 1/2 stage planetary gearbox directly connected
to the medium speed generator. In addition, the bearing of the planetary stage is integrated
with the rotor bearing. So in one housing we have the rotor bearing, the gearbox and the
generator (Siegfriedsen and Böhmeke 1998).
The advantage of a highly integrated concept is the potential for cost reduction in the drive
train. The number of components is reduced. On the other hand integration also increases
the technological risk. Loads lead to deformations of components and some parts like the
gear wheal pairing are sensitive with respect to deformation. As a consequence a careful
deformation analysis of the design has to be made taking into account all potential loading
situations.
The Multibrid concept was used for the offshore wind turbine Areva 5M. About 200 of
this wind turbine with different rotor diameters (115 and 135 m) were built and installed
in a number of German offshore wind farms, i.e. Alpha Ventus, Borkum West II (now
named Trianel), Global Tech I and Wikinger. After a turbulent business history the company
Multibrid GmbH then Areva Wind GmbH and now Adven Offshore (a Siemens Gamesa
subsidiary) decided to discontinue manufacturing wind turbines including the multibrid
concept from 2017 on and is now mainly focusing on offshore service and maintenance.
Nevertheless, medium speed concepts have nowadays a market share of about 4%, see
Fig.4.5, but are promising for the future. For instance, the latest Vestas offshore wind turbines
use a medium speed generator, a 2-point suspension, and gearbox and generator are attached
to each other. Between main shaft and gearbox a ﬂexible coupling is used.
4.7
Direct Drive Concepts
The idea to design a wind turbine without any gearbox is long standing and many attempts to
realize such a concept have been made (Klinger 2012). Presently about 20% of wind turbines
worldwide are direct drive, Fig.4.5. They are also called gearless. There are different types
of generators and many ways to arrange the generator relative to the rotor. In addition many
different ways of integration exist. As a consequence, there is a large number of different
direct-drive design concepts. Some have been successful in the market, some not. Some are
used for the latest offshore wind turbine and some have vanished from the market. In the
following an overview on basic design concepts is given and some examples provided. A
sketch of a particular conﬁguration is shown in Fig.4.13.

4.7.1
Type of Generator
On direct-drive wind turbines synchronous generators are used, both with electrical and
permanent excitation. In permanently excited machines the rotor is equipped with permanent
magnets and the stator carries coils made from copper. In electrically excited machines
copper is on both sides. Which concept is used depends on costs, mass and to a lesser degree
size where these aspects are often related to each other. The main objectives of the generator
design are to keep mass and costs low and the size of the generator such that it can be
transported on roads. For large wind turbines the generator may reach a size where this is
not feasible. The solution to this issue then is to divide the generator in smaller segments
that could be moved to and assembled at a suitable location. For offshore wind turbines this
is a plant near a harbor.
Also machines with super conducting coils have been suggested for wind turbines
(Abrahamsen 2012). In such machines higher ﬂux densities can be achieved and, as a con-
sequence, weight and size reduction is possible. Although promising, this technology is not
yet in a mature industrial state.
For electrical machines also the geometry of the air gap is important. It determines the
direction of the magnetic ﬂux (ﬁeld lines) relative to the axis of rotation. Electrical machines
can have radial, axial and transverse ﬂux. While generators with all ﬂux directions have been

76
4
Drivetrain
suggested for wind turbines, the existing models have all radial ﬂux. Also for machines with
medium and high speed radial ﬂux is used.
4.7.2
The Air Gap Challenge
As mentioned already in Sect.4.1 the direct drive generator has a large diameter. For rotating
electrical machines it is necessary that coils or magnets are moving (rotor) with respect to
other coils (stator) to induce a voltage and generate electric current and power.
Stator and rotor are separated by the air gap. In order to exploit the electrically active
material with high efﬁciency the air gap of the generator must be small. In state-of-the-art
designs the air gap is about 5 mm while, as mentioned in Sect.4.1, the diameter of the
generator, more speciﬁcally the ring diameter, is 5–10 m. Since torque (and hence power)
increases quadratic with radius and only linear with length of the generator in most cases
diameter is larger than the length of the direct drive generator. As a consequence design of the
generator is highly demanding with respect to size accuracy and quality of its components.
More importantly if the generator is connected in some way to the aerodynamic rotor it
will also experience loads and, in turn, deformations. It is of utmost importance to have
possible deformations under control in the design process such that the air gap never vanishes
completely or, better, a safety distance remains in all situations. If the rotor would touch the
stator during operation it would cause damage. The air gap failure is one of the worst-case
scenarios for direct-drive wind turbines.
In the design process of a wind turbine with gearless concept one needs to take into
account the air gap challenge from the very beginning. One of the objectives is to reduce
loading of the generator structure that can have impact on the air gap. In the ideal case only
torque would be transferred from the aerodynamic rotor to the generator. In reality this is
not possible; but there are strategies to reduce deformation. An obvious (but also expensive)
solution is to include an elastic coupling between hub and generator (Baseer et al. 2020).
In any case, a deformation analysis needs to be done. For this purpose ﬁnite-element
tools are used (e.g., ANSYS), where the relevant structural properties of the generator
can be modeled, wind loads and electromagnetic air gap forces are applied, and realistic
deﬂections can be obtained. In this analyses one assumes also additional safety factors for
instance for the loads such that eventually, if everything has been done correctly, one can be
conﬁdent that no air gap problems will occur.
4.7.3
Position of the Generator and Integration Concept
A generator has to be positioned relative to rotor and tower and connected with the hub. There
are three positions that have all been used in different wind turbine designs. The generator
can be “in front of” the tower (i.e., on the same side as the rotor), above the tower, or behind

4.7
Direct Drive Concepts
77
the tower. One aspect of the position is the location of the center of mass of components
above the upper tower ﬂange. In general, the center of mass is not at or near the tower axis.
If the generator is behind the tower one expects that the arrangement of nacelle and rotor
can be balanced to some extent. However, mass or weight balance is only one aspect of
the loading of the components at the tower top, the ﬂanges, bolt connection, and the yaw
bearing. Loads relevant for sizing at the tower top are dominated by aerodynamic loads from
the rotor. Gravitational loads, of course, must be taken into account, but are not decisive.
Since the location of the center of mass is at our disposal, we might place the generator
also at the same side as the rotor. The center of mass for this design will be in front of the
tower. The resulting loads, such as a bending moment at the tower top, can be carried by
the appropriate design of yaw bearing, the bolt connections and the uppermost part of the
tower. All direct-drive designs that are successful on the market have generator in front of
the tower. An example will be given in Sect.4.7.5 for a new innovative gearless design.
The main reason that the position in front of the tower is more successful is its level of
integration. Obviously, the rotor bearing can also be used as the generator bearing. In this
case the hub is directly connected to the generator rotor and no additional shaft or coupling
is needed.
Another possible integration is that the housing of the generator plays the role of the
machine frame. If the generator is attached at one side to a suitable structure above the tower
and on the other side the rotor is attached to the generator shaft, e.g., then not only shaft and
its bearing has double functionality but also the housing of the generator.
Integration saves components and costs. On the other hand, the air gap analysis is more
demanding than in a design where the generator has its own bearing and is simply a separate
component. Nevertheless to use one main bearing for aerodynamic and generator rotor is
mainstream for gearless wind turbines. Similar to a separated design of a geared wind turbine
is positioning the generator behind the tower. In this case the generator would have its own
bearing and a main shaft is needed to connect rotor and generator. The obvious advantage
of this design concept is that the generator can be exchanged without removing nacelle and
rotor from the tower. This concept was considered as promising for direct-drive wind turbine
some 20 years ago but was never successful on the market.
In our sketch Fig.4.13 the generator is in front of the tower. A single moment bearing is
used. There is a short axle attached to the machine frame such that in principle the generator
can be transported as a complete unit. Such a unit could be also put on a test bench.
4.7.4
Inner and Outer Rotor
Another choice that needs to be deﬁned during design process is whether the generator rotor
is outside or inside the stator. In high-speed machines the rotor is always inside the stator,
closer to the axis of rotation than the stator. This arrangement is called inner or internal rotor.

78

Drivetrain
But in general, depending on the geometry of the generator, it could also be the other way
around; the rotor could be outside the stator. This case is called outer or external rotor.
Both, rotor and stator, are arranged on a ring with a radius of several meters and need to
be connected to structural components that are closer to the axis of rotation (like bearing or
shaft for example). This connecting structure is called the shield. For large ring generator
the shields can be one-sided. This allows one to arrange the rotor either inside or outside the
stator. In the sketch Fig.4.13 the generator has an inner rotor.
4.7.5
Eleon as an Example
Concerning the integration concept the Eleon wind turbine introduced in the Sect.2.11 also
uses a single moment bearing. The basic concept is depicted in Fig.4.14. The bearing is the
blue object (no roller elements shown). The special feature of this concept is that the stator
housing is separated from the machine frame. Both stator an rotor are attached to the outer
and inner ring of the moment bearing. The deﬂection from off-axial loads that effects the
generator now is reduced to the deﬂection of the bearing. Since we need a rotary bearing
this cannot be avoided. In that respect the Eleon design concept is unique. There is another
special feature at the rear end of the generator. It is an auxiliary bearing that additionally
stabilizes the air gap. As a consequence, the structural design is sized only by the air gap
forces which is much different from other existing direct drive concepts.

Fig.4.15 Eleon generator during installation process
One important detail remains to be discussed. With the purpose to support all loads
by the moment bearing—except torque of course—the whole conﬁguration is statically
indeterminate through the second bearing. It turns out by careful analyses and fabrication
of the components that the constraint forces remain small enough to pose no risk to the
bearings. The generator of the 3.4 MW turbine before and during installation is shown in
Fig.4.15.

Structural Components
In this section we focus on main structural components for nacelle and drive train. These
are components like hub, machine frame, main shaft that are individually designed for a
particular type of wind turbine. Since these are pivotal components, they need to be designed
by the party that has the overall system competence. To a certain extent this is also true for
the nacelle housing and the spinner or hub cover. Therefore housings are also included in
this Section.
Some of the components include several functions. For example the machine frame pro-
vides support for rotor bearings, gearbox and yaw drives and has to fulﬁll further require-
ments explained in Sect.5.3. Therefore development needs quite some effort and is time-
consuming. Further on, the machine frame is a so-called long-lead item. This means that it
has a long delivery time, i.e., this type of components determines the schedule from kick-off
event to prototype installation in a new wind turbine development project.
Other key structural components are rotor blades and towers. They are mentioned brieﬂy
in Sects.2.3 and 2.4. They are not treated in anymore detail here.
5.1
Materials and Manufacturing Process for Main Components
There are only few types of materials that are used for structural components. For instance
the DNV GL guideline (DNV GL 2010) provides information about these materials. Of
particular importance are
• Cast iron for hub, machine frame and other parts
• Construction steel for machine frame and other supporting structures
• Forged alloy steel for the main shaft, if the wind turbine needs one
• Fiber reinforced plastic as the materials for nacelle cover and spinner.

Structural Components
In the following some properties of these materials are discussed. The materials for
structural parts—except the FRP that is also mentioned here—are iron based. The amount
of material needed and the pressure on general cost reduction in wind industry does not
allow materials like aluminum or titan alloys for structural parts, although they have some
favorable properties.
5.1.1
Cast Iron and Casting Process
Spheroidal or ductile cast iron is the most important structural material of the drive train.
It mainly consists of iron and contains a 3.0–3.7% fraction of carbon besides some other
minor admixtures. As shown in Fig.5.1 the material contains small nodules that consist of
graphite. This has an impact on the mechanical properties. While other cast iron materials
are brittle, spheroidal cast iron is ductile and chosen for structural parts subject to volatile
loads.
The casting process is most suitable for components like the hub with a relatively com-
plex geometry. It is possible to create a geometry that is optimized for given design loads.
Limitations to the geometry are deﬁned by the casting process itself. Designers need to have
good knowledge about the casting process and they should communicate with the foundry
to optimize the design for the manufacturing process.
One example of a rule that should be followed in the design process is to avoid material
accumulations, in other words, avoid that some parts of the structure are thicker than others.
In the fabrication process accumulations would cool down more slowly than other parts of
the structure which would lead to stress and potential damage. Another rule is caused by
the fact that the material can tolerate more compressive than tensile stress. Consequently
one should design the geometry such that for loads applied to the component the structure
should lead to compressive stress, if possible.

spheroidal cast iron

Materials and Manufacturing Process for Main Components
83
A typical material accumulation results in case several reinforcing ribs meet at one point.
To improve the design one could introduce a ring rib where the reinforcing ribs end. Or one
can move the ribs in such a way that they do not meet at one point.
The large structural components of wind turbine are produced in the sand-casting process.
After the design is completed and a 3D-model is available (see Sect.3), the ﬁrst step in this
process is to produce the pattern. The pattern is a replica of the component made from wood
or foam. The pattern is used to form the mold from a mixture of sand and glue that consist
of lower and upper parts (called drag and cope) and the core inside a ﬂask. Further the
core is needed that ﬁlls the space inside the mold corresponding to the hollow parts of the
component. More details on the casting process can be found, e.g., in Campbell (2015).
The pattern and suitable ﬂasks can be normally reused. The mold and the core are
destroyed in the process. Also after cleaning the sand can be reused. Patterns are expensive
such that casting is not cost efﬁcient for one or a small number of items. Since most wind
turbines are developed for mass production casting has become the standard manufacturing
process for structural components like hub and machine frame.
An important issue in the manufacturing process is the quality of resulting items. In the
casting process one has to make sure that the material has uniform properties and no cavities
or other defects result in the process. Quality depends on know-how of the foundry in casting
large items. A standard is also to carry out measurements with ultrasonic or x-ray devices
to assure quality.
5.1.2
Construction Steel and Welding
The metallic material that is most widely used worldwide is so-called construction steel. Its
chemical composition is slightly different from that of casting material. It contains 1.6%
manganese and no or very little carbon. It is available as half-ﬁnished material in shape
of plates of different thickness. Construction steel is ductile like spheroidal cast iron and
suitable for welding. Further on, plates can be bent up to a certain curvature using the
property that steel can be plastically deformed to a certain extent without being destroyed.
However, the need to start a design from plates or bent plates implies a strong limitation
to the geometry of the component to be manufactured. It is, e.g., cumbersome to produce a
component like the hub that approximates a sphere.
For manufacturing a component made of construction steel also starts from a computer
aided 3D design. It needs to take into account properties of the plates like size, available
thickness and restrictions due to the fact that the geometry has to be obtained from ﬂat or
rounded sections. Further also requirements due to the welding process need to be taken into
account. Compared to components for the casting process this limits the geometry. Plates
need to be cut in parts that are attached to each other by welding to build the component.

84
5
Structural Components
The quality of welded components to a large extent depends on the quality of the welding
seams. They need special care and control after completion. E.g., it needs to be checked
whether the complete welding seam is ﬁlled with material.
A side remark concerning the price of the raw or half-ﬁnished material may be in place.
World-market prices for iron-based materials like steel plates have varied greatly over time
depending on the economic situation. During the last 20 years price for steel plates made in
the USA varied from USD 500 to USD 2000 in February 2022 per metric ton.1 The price of
the ﬁnished component is determined by half-ﬁnished material (plates) and manufacturing
cost. In large and heavy components material costs are very important or even dominating.
5.1.3
Forged Alloy Steel
Another manufacturing process that is used for components of wind turbine is forging. For
example main shafts used for 2- and 3-point suspensions in wind turbines with gearbox are
often made from forged alloy steel. Alternatively, main shafts can also be made by casting.
Here we utilize the shaft of the Windrad 2 MW wind turbine as an example for a forged
main component. The material in this case is alloy steel, containing iron and small admixtures
of chromium, molybdenum, and nickel in the order of 1%. The material is delivered to the
forgery in the form of a slug. Then it is heated and hammered to obtain the trumped-like
shape of the main shaft. After forging the item is slowly cooled down and later machined.
A demanding part of the machining process is preparing the bore through the main shaft. In
comparison, with a cast main shaft the bore could be implemented in the casting process.
The forged alloy steel has a high strength, signiﬁcantly higher than that of cast iron or
construction steel. This is an important advantage for the main shaft. The diameter of the
main shaft inﬂuences the bearings. The bore of the main bearings is sized by the diameter
of the main shaft. So it is an advantage to have a small main shaft diameter.
5.1.4
Glas Fiber Reinforced Plastic
The ﬁber reinforced plastic is mentioned here as the only non-metallic material, since most
wind turbine nacelle covers and spinners are made of this material. They are not structural
components in the sense that the main loads are going through but are important in the
engineering process. Often they are designed by engineers of the wind turbine manufacturer.
The material used here is a cheaper version of the composite material used in blades. The half
ﬁnished material in this case are randomly ordered ﬁber mats. In the design process nacelle
cover and spinner are divided into suitable sections. For each section a mold is prepared.
The items are then produced by hand lamination where the mats are put into the molds and
resin is distributed manually with rollers.

Main loads for nacelle cover and spinner are direct wind loads. The main parameter for
the strength of the component at a certain location is given by the plate thickness. Also
sandwich material with glass ﬁber at upper and lower side and foam in between is used.
Some essential properties of materials for design of wind turbines are collected in
Table5.1. Note that parameters depend on material thickness as well, which is not shown here
to keep the table concise. Exact values are provided in the relevant standards and guidelines.
5.2
Hub
The hub of a wind turbine is a special component that we do not have in a similar form in
other machinery. The main properties of the hub are
• Provide stable support for a certain number of rotor blades. Blades are directly connected
to the hub or, as in all wind turbine of the last 20 years, a bearing that is then attached
to the hub. Blades have a certain weight and experience aerodynamic forces that are
dimensioning for the hub.
• The hub needs to be connected to a shaft or in another way connected to the subsequent
parts of the drive train such that the torque can be transferred to the generator.
• The hub needs to be accessible up to a certain extent.
The historic Dutch wind mills had four blades. With this rotor concept it was possible to
use two wooden beams that cross each other in the center. This way one avoids to design a
connection between blade root and hub near the rotor axis where high loads are expected.
In two-bladed designs it is also possible to use a bar that crosses the rotor axis. For the

86
5
Structural Components
tree-bladed rotor such solutions are not possible. All hubs need to have three ﬂanges with
120◦distance.
5.2.1
Hub Design Concept
Two concepts for designing the hub are described here. Firstly, we consider the tubular hub.
As shown in Fig.5.3 the hub consists of three tubes that cross each other in the rotor axis
in a distance of 120◦. There will be a fourth tube along the rotor axis. Such a hub can be
a welded design with prefabricated tubes. At the ends of the tubes will be ﬂanges to attach
the blades and the shaft. Also the rotor cone can be realized in such a design by pointing the
blade tubes slightly in forward direction. Wall thickness of the turbines has to be such that
they are providing stable support for the blades.
Quite different from the tubular design is the spherical hub design. We start with a sphere
(1). As further shown in Fig.5.2 the next steps are to cut off caps from the sphere, one for
the connection to the main shaft (2) and three for connection to the blades (3), (4). Again the
blade axis are positioned at an angle of 120◦. Then one adds a narrow ﬂange to the cuts (5),
(6). By deﬁning the wall thickness the object will become hollow and resembles a spherical
shell with openings (7). Finally, rounding are added since any sharp edges could lead to
sources of cracks (8).

spherical hub concept

5.2
Hub

Material thickness can be made variable, e.g., by placing an inner sphere and by slightly
shifting the centers of the outer and inner sphere relative to each other. Also more holes may
be necessary to enter the hub for servicing the pitch system depending on the concept. For
instance the hub of the Eleon 3.4 MW machine does not have further openings. The hub can
be accessed easily from the nacelle through the generator and the main bearing. But most
wind turbines have these access openings. In some more detail we discuss the hub of the
Windrad 2 MW turbine in the next Sect.5.2.2.

2 MW Hub Design and Structural Analysis
The hub of the Windrad 2 MW turbine is a modern design based on the spherical hub
approach. Clearly the closed sphere would be the most stable geometry. Cutting of parts for
blade connection and main shaft connection the geometric stability is reduced. To increase
the stability one can partly ﬁll the opening with a reinforcement structure. But this structure
must not be too large since access to the blade root should be possible. Furthermore openings
are needed to remove the sand kernel in the casting process.
In Fig.5.4 two 3D views of the 2 MW hub are displayed. The ﬁgure (left side) shows the
front view. The large opening is the ﬂange for connecting the pitch bearing and through this
bearing the blade. Also seen are the blind holes for the bolts that connect the pitch bearing to
the hub. The reinforcement structure shown in the hub in Fig.5.4 is a compromise between
the different requirements mentioned in the previous paragraph. The other opening at the
front side is the one to enter the hub for service. It needs to have sufﬁcient size to allow
service personal to enter the hub. The rear view on the right hand side shows the bolt hole
circle for attaching the main shaft.
The drawings, see Fig.5.5 with measures are the reference for the manufacturing of the
component. The object can be reconstructed from the drawings. The drawings are derived
from the 3D model and equipped with the measures. For the casting process 3D models are
also used directly.
The drawings also contain information about details of the manufacturing process, like
surface treatment and required roughness, rounding of edges, etc.

Hub Stability Analysis
The stability analysis of the hub is carried out with FE methods (see Sect.3.2). The hub is a
component for which a great deal of analysis is done for structural optimization before the
ﬁnal proof of stability is carried out and documented for the certiﬁcation process.
The loads dimensioning the hub originate from the blades. On the rear end the hub is
attached to the main shaft. In an approximate approach this joint can be treated as a stiff wall.
In reality it is not absolutely stiff but ﬂexible due to the elasticity of main shaft, machine
frame, etc. Taking into account this realistic treatment of stiffness may reduce the calculated
stresses in the hub, on the expense of more computation time of course.
Concerning the load transfer to the component to be analyzed, sectional loads can be
uniformly distributed across the blade ﬂanges. Near the ﬂanges this may, however, not lead
to a realistic stress distribution. The reason is the bolt connection. Bolt connection cause a
characteristic stress pattern in the clamped parts near the bolts. For a more precise analyses
also the bolts with pre-stress have to be modeled. This makes models very cumbersome. The
same holds for the bolt connection between hub and main shaft. As bolt connections extend
to the vicinity of the hub (pitch bearings, blade roots, main shaft) in this approach parts of
the vicinity of the hub have to be modeled as well. The result of the simpliﬁed approach for
the van Mises stress and one of the extreme load cases is shown in Fig.5.6.
5.3
Machine Frame
The machine frame is the most challenging component in the design process. It fulﬁlls the
following requirements:

5.3
Machine Frame

Fig.5.7 Machine frame of the Windrad 2 MW wind turbine
• Provide together with main bearing and main shaft a ﬁrm connection between the upper
end of the tower and the rotor.
• Provide support for the elements of the drive train. For wind turbine with gearbox these
are the bearing(s) and the gearbox or only the torque of the gearbox. For direct-drive
wind turbine this is the stator part of the generator.
• Provide ﬂanges and surfaces where drives and brakes of the yaw system are attached to.
• Since the machine frame is located above the tower the design also needs to take account
of access ways for service personal that connect tower and nacelle.
• It needs to integrate the rotor lock that allows to ﬁx the rotor in particular positions.
• Also points where the nacelle cover can be attached to are needed.
It is made either from cast iron or steel plates as welded design. The frame of the 2 MW
wind turbine of this book is shown in Fig.5.7. The machine frame waiting in the assembly
hall for further processing is shown in Fig.4.8. A drawing of the 2 MW machine frame is
provided in Fig.5.8.
5.3.1
Sizing and Analysis
For sizing and structural proof loads have to be introduced onto the machine frame. For the
three point bearing the points are the ﬂanges of the main bearing housing and the torque
arm supports on both sides of the gearbox. For the 2 MW sample wind turbine the load

introduction points are indicated by red areas in Fig.5.9 which is a screen shot of the FE
model geometry.
For completeness also the loads introduced by the yaw drive and other attachments into
the main frame have to be calculated. However, this might be separated from the main loads.
In order to quantify the loads and to get an impression of the size and dimension Fig.5.10
provides a schematics with distances in mm between key points of the hub nacelle structure.
Those key points are denoted as follows: R for hub center (rotating with the hub), N for
center of main bearing (ﬁxed to the nacelle), K for intersection between tower axis and rotor
axis (moving with nacelle), K2 center of yaw bearing (ﬁxed to tower top).
The hub center could also be an origin of non-rotating coordinate system, i.e., not ﬁxed to
the hub, but to the nacelle. The coordinate origin is denoted as RN and shown in Fig.5.11.
For the 2 MW wind turbine of this book the extreme dynamical loads with respect to this
coordinate system are given in Table5.2.
For each component the maximum loads are given in the matrix diagonal element. Lines
show the isochronous load of the respective other components. Altogether each line consti-
tutes a load case. DLC stands for Design Load Case and the acronyms in that row refer to
particular loads cases mentioned in the guidelines for the two different rotor diameters (93
and 87 m) used in the layout of this turbine. The last two columns refer to the pitch angle
and the wind speed at hub height, when the extreme event occurs.

In order to determine loads at the points of load introduction of the bearings of Fig.5.9
from the loads given at the hub center the later ones have to be rearranged to determine the
reaction forces at the bearings. For the 3-point suspension we have to take into account force
⃗F, bending moment ⃗M, and torque. To simplify this a little we leave away the torque for the
time being and come back to it in Sect.7.3. The situation is sketched in Fig.5.12. Force ⃗F
and bending moment ⃗M are given in term of components by
⃗F = Fz ˆez + Fx ˆex
(5.1)
⃗M = M ˆey
(5.2)
where we have chosen coordinate directions for convenience. In order to determine the
reaction forces ⃗F1 and ⃗F2 at bearings L1 and L2, respectively, we note that L1 is a spherical
roller bearing (ﬁxed bearing) and L2 which is inside the gearbox a ﬂoating bearing (ˆez axis
is unbound). Hence reaction force are
⃗F1 = F1z ˆez + F1x ˆex
(5.3)
⃗F2 = F2x ˆex
(5.4)
Balance of forces lead to equations for the components
Fz + F1z = 0
(5.5)
Fx + F1x + F2x = 0
(5.6)
In order to balance moments we introduce a arbitrary reference point z0 along the ˆez axis.
The balance of moments than reads
M + Fx(z1 −z0) + F1x(z2 −z0) + F2x(z3 −z0) = 0

where z1, z2, and z3 denote z coordinates at R, N(= L1), N3(= L2) respectively. For
deﬁniteness we choose the arbitrary reference point at the coordinate system N (main bearing
L1), i.e., z2 −z0 = 0 and ﬁnd
M −Fxa + F2xb = 0
(5.8)
where we have introduced a = z2 −z1 and b = z3 −z2. Utilizing also Eq.5.6 we can con-
vert to
F1x = 1
b (M −Fx a) −Fx
(5.9)
F2x = 1
b (Fx a −M)
(5.10)
and from Eq.5.5 we get F1z = −Fz that completely determines the reaction forces at bearing
L1 and L2. In a simpliﬁed example we use values for load components in the vicinity of
those given in Table5.2. Ultimate gravitational force (FXRN) is chosen Fx = 700 kN. Thrust
(FZRN) is chosen Fz = 650 kN. Bending moment (MYRN) is chosen My = 6000 kN. The
values for a and b can be read off Fig.5.10. We choose a = 2.0 m and b = 2.3 m to make
it simple. With these values components of the reaction forces are
F1z = −650 kN
(5.11)
F2x = 1
2.3 (700 · 2.0 −6000) kN = −2000 kN
(5.12)
F1x =
 1
2.3 (6000 −700 · 2.0) −700

kN = 1300 kN
(5.13)
Summarizing our sizing calculation we conclude
• From aerodynamic moments the machine frame receives sizable stress
• Those moments size the machine frame
• Reaction forces are much larger than gravitational forces
• Distance b is an important quantity as Fx ∝1/b
In both cases, with 3-point and 2-point suspension, the bending moment is supported by
a pair of radial forces. A large distance between the bearings, the parameter b in equation
above, reduces the radial forces. This situation is shown on the left side of Fig.5.13. What
happens if we use a moment bearing? In this bearing there are two rows of rollers very close
to each other. So the parameter b is small. On the other hand, the individual rows do not
support only a radial force but also forces in other directions. If the diameter of the bearing
is large enough the moment can be supported by a pair of horizontal forces with similar
magnitude as in the previous case. This is depicted on the right side of the Fig.5.13. This
leads to the ring-type geometry of the momentum bearing which makes it suitable for a
direct drive wind turbine that have generators with a large diameter.

5.3.2
Optimizing the Structure
Due to the complex load introduction and the design restrictions ﬁnding the optimal design
is not straight forward, in particular for the main frame. It needs insight and experience
to optimize a design with respect to minimize mass of the structure and costs. Typical
restrictions are related to geometry, stress, damage, deformation, frequencies, serviceability,
and maybe more features.
To start with the available space has to be ﬁlled with material in a smart way to fulﬁll
the restrictions and match the objective. Can this be automatized? The answer is yes, but
partially only, because the methods known are not yet fully developed. If the structure
can be optimized by considering, e.g., local stress then a method sometimes called “pixel
method” can be introduced. However, damage related to fatigue is not a local property but
needs analysis of the structure as a whole. Nevertheless, the pixel method is helpful to get
some insight into the stress distribution. The idea is to take out material, if the local stress
is below a certain limit. If fully automatized an algorithm depicted in Fig.5.14 (left side)
would lead to an optimized structure if the loop in the lower part of the diagram converges

and provided the above mentioned conditions (restrictions) are implemented correctly. As
already mentioned, no conclusive algorithm has been developed to date, hence the designer
has to intervene at certain stages of optimization in the loop. This is symbolized in Fig.5.14
(right side) by mentioning the “human interface”.
An example is provided in Fig.5.15. From top left (deﬁnition of geometry) to bottom
right (ﬁnal result) iterations according to the algorithm mentioned Fig.5.14 (right side)
are shown. The top left pair shows a reasonable starting point for a direct drive machine
frame. The green model provides the grid for FE analysis with a red area showing the load
introduction at the main bearing and the colored model to its left provides the analysis result.
Color coding for FE analysis is as follows: Blue means little stress, then green to yellow to
orange to red symbolizes gradually higher stress values. The second pair on the left shows
the (grayish) CAD model to the right and the respective (colored) FE analysis result to the
left. This is from a different perspective as the ﬁrst pair, but the same volume. The next pair
shows the ﬁrst iteration in the CAD model leaving out the parts that have small stress values
and so forth until the the ﬁnal result is seen in the bottom right pair of models. Additional
openings seen in the ﬁnal CAD model are due to necessity of a rotor lock and service access.
5.4
Generator Frame
The generator frame sometimes noted as auxiliary frame is mounted behind the main frame
and carries the generator and other utilities, e.g., switch boards or control cabinets as well as
power electronic equipment. Other than the main frame the generator frame has no structural
function with respect to the wind loads from the rotor etc. Hence requirements to structure
are less ambitious. Material choice could be steel, type S355, and due to simple geometry
the auxiliary frame is mostly realized as a welded structure. Besides structural stability to
carry the loads placed onto the generator frame, from a structural point of view, the most
important item is the connection between generator frame and main frame that is usually
realized by a bolted joint.
An example of a generator frame is shown in Fig.5.16 whereas the realization in the
assembly hall shown in Fig.5.17. The generator frame is already ﬁxed to the main frame.
The masses placed on the generator frame are, e.g., for the 2 MW wind turbine of
this book: Generator 7,400 kg, Cooler 400 kg, Controller cabinet 540 kg, Nacelle hous-
ing 3,000 kg. In order to get the loads those masses are subject to accelerations (forward-
backward and side-side acceleration) experienced by the wind turbine nacelle; up-down
movement are conﬁned due to mounting to the tower from below and can be neglected.
Including safety factors, ultimate accelerations found for the 2 MW wind turbine are about
3.5 m/s2 for side-side and about 4.7 m/s2 forward-backward. In addition also possible short
circuit in the electrical equipment has to be considered which could lead to a torque at the
high speed shaft of about 50 kNm (including safety factors).

Structural proofs will utilize FE techniques for generator frame as for the other structural
parts as well. For the bolt FE analyses are used to check sliding and gaping of the connection
between generator frame and main frame. Also here high quality bolts are needed with a
bolt grade 10.9.

Main Shaft
The purpose of the main shaft is to ﬁx the rotating hub to the ﬁxed main frame via the main
bearing. To this end, the main shaft of a wind turbine can have many different shapes. In
some designs it is just the inner ring of a bearing that is connected to the hub. In this section
we focus on a less compact realization of the main shaft suitable for the 2 MW wind turbine
used in this book and shown in assembly hall in Fig.5.18. A 3D model is shown in Fig.5.19.
5.5.1
Sizing and Analysis
To determine loads we utilize again Fig.5.12 for illustration and the results for F1 and F2
provided in Eqs.5.9 and 5.10. What is needed are the sectional loads along the rotor axis
z, i.e., Fx(z) and My(z). From the results previously obtained for the machine frame, we
obtain

(5.15)
In Fig.5.20 the sectional loads are shown with Fx neglected as the bending moment domi-
nates the main shaft design. The linear decrease of the moment motivates the geometry of
the shaft. As we will see below, at the rear end of the shaft it is the torque that sizes the
component. A side remark concerning alternative concepts may be appropriate at this point.
For two-bladed wind turbines teeter hinges between rotor and main shaft have been used.
One can imagine that for a large wind turbine the teeter hinge is a demanding concept. But
the effect would be that the bending moment that is sizing the machine frame, main shaft
and other components in the conventional design is largely decoupled from the structure.
Blades are still bent of course, but the resulting moment is not transferred to the shaft. This
would lead to a lighter main shaft.
Coming back to our concept, to determine the rough size of the main shaft at the main
bearing we ﬁrst consider the bending moment which we assume to be about M = 6000 kNm

for the 2 MW wind turbine. With a yield strength for material 34CrNiMo6 of Rp0.2 =
540 MPa the limiting yield is σmax = 491 MPa. Employing the section modulus of a circular

Concerning the loading by torque we have to analyze the shear stress, i.e.,
τ = Mtorsion/WP, wherein WP = 2W = π D3/16 denotes the respective section modulus.
Assuming Mtorsion = 2200 kNm we ﬁnd

the maximum shear stress is τmax ≈0.65 σmax = 320 N/mm2 (Wittel et al. 2021). In its
turn the minimum diameter can be calculated using Eq.5.19.

(5.20)
The geometry of the main shaft is much simpler than that of the main frame, however,
loads are still rather demanding. Hence material choice is usually high quality steel such
as 34CrNiMo6 and the main shaft is forged to withstand the loads. For the 2 MW wind
turbine of this book an overview drawing is shown in Fig.5.21 which also includes a cross
section (Sectional view A-A). The main shaft is hollow to allow for supply lines between
hub and nacelle. Also from structural point of view the inner part is not important because it
is close to the neutral axis. Results of an FE analysis for ultimate loads is shown in Fig.5.22.
Result of an FE analysis for fatigue damage is shown in Fig.5.23. Fatigue damage depends
on surface roughness Rz (sometimes Ra).2 Surface roughness is a source of micro cracks
that leads to larger damage the larger the surface roughness is. Damage values shown in
Fig.5.23 are for Rz = 100 µm. In order to improve resilience against damage, alternatively
to increasing the size or improve material quality, the surface can be smoothed at rather
reasonable expenses. The surface area in Fig.5.23 that is grayed has been treated to have a
surface roughness of Rz = 32 µm. The respective FE analysis for fatigue damage is shown
in insert of Fig.5.23.
2 There is a subtle difference between Ra and Rz, which is not elaborated here. Both deﬁnitions are
used in industry, hence care has to be taken, if one wants to compare results.

5.6
High Speed Shaft
The purpose of the high speed shaft is to transfer torque from gearbox to generator with
an alignment tolerance of about 1◦and a deﬂection tolerance of a few millimeter. Such a
tolerance is necessary, since the frames used to attach main shaft, gearbox and generator are
ﬂexible structures and may lead to misalignment of the mechanical drive train and additional
reaction forces. Due to gear ratio rated torque for a 2 MW wind turbine is about 14 kNm,
extreme torque about 32 kNm. In order to protect the gearbox against possible short circuits

106

in the generator (leading to instant high brake torque) high speed shafts usually have a torque
limiter, in this case a reasonable value would be about 50 kNm.
A high speed shaft employed in the 2 MW wind turbine is shown in Fig.5.24. Material
of the shaft besides steel is also glass ﬁbre plastics. In order to allow slight misalignment
the bearings on both sides possess a gimbal expansion joint.
5.7
Rotor Lock
The rotor lock is employed during service work to ﬁx the rotor at a certain position so that
hub and nacelle are form-closed and not moving against each other. In this case, the rotor
has to be moved into the proper position for locking. This can be achieved manually or
automatically. The rotor lock itself can be actuated hydraulically, electrically, or manually.
The rotor lock has to withstand loads occurring during maintenance (maintenance design
load cases). Since the loads are high for the 2 MW wind turbine of this book two rotor
locks have been installed, see Fig.5.25. Extreme loads only are considered. Fatigue life time
is not relevant, since the rotor lock is only used during maintenance. The extreme torque
including a safety factor of 1.5 is 1307 kNm. This should be compared to the extreme value
that occurs during operation of the wind turbine of more than 2000 kNm and a rated torque
of about 1300 kNm. Since there are two rotor locks installed a torque of 653 kNm has been
introduced to the hub ﬂange of Fig.5.26 that provides a simpliﬁed FE model of the situation
with only one rotor lock. Due to symmetry the result is also valid for the second rotor lock.
Most important is that no shearing-off happens, however, a slight plastic deformation is

High quality material of the bushing is 34CrNiMo6 with a tensile yield strength of
Rp0.2 = 700 MPa (same as main shaft) and for the pin 42CrMo4 with a tensile yield strength
of Rp0.2 = 650 MPa.

Nacelle Cover and Spinner
Nacelle and hub are covered by a housing. The purpose is to protect components and systems
inside the nacelle and hub against environmental inﬂuence like water, dirt and dust. In addi-
tion the housing also serves as lightning protection and protects people during maintenance
work. The housing for nacelle is usual called nacelle cover and for the hub spinner. Hubs of
some wind turbines go without a spinner. In this case the hub cast is already closed against
the mentioned inﬂuences.
The housing has to fulﬁll quite a few requirements which are more or less all related to the
loads that could occur during the life time of the wind turbine. Those loads are due to wind,
snow and ice as well as other live loads. Examples are loads related to safety equipment
(such as arrestors) or loads from a crane, if integrated into the nacelle housing.

5.8
Nacelle Cover and Spinner

5.8.1
Nacelle Cover
Most of the wind turbines use glass ﬁber reinforced plastic for nacelle covers, however, in
some cases also alternatives are used. Aluminum has been utilized, e.g., by Enercon. Also,
the housing could be integrated into the support structure. This was mentioned already for
the hub but is also possible for the nacelle and in this case steel is used as a material choice.
The laminate lay-out of a housing build of glass ﬁber reinforced plastic is provided in
Table5.3.
In Table5.4 a comparison of material properties between steel and typical glass ﬁber
reinforced plastic (GFRP) used for housing is provided.
An example of a nacelle cover is shown in Fig.5.29. It consists of three main shells.
A top cover encoded by brownish color and a bottom cover that is parted in the middle
and color coded as greenish and blueish in the Figure. This way it is easy to attach the
cover after assembly of the machine is completed. The yellowish pads seen at the cover are
reinforcements to ﬁx the shells to the support structure which shown in Fig.5.30. A drawing
of the housing is provided in Fig.5.31.
In order to estimate the loads from wind we utilize a reference wind speed of VRef =
50 m/s (i.e. wind class 1 according to IEC classiﬁcation). The maximum wind speed (gust)
is vmax = 1.4 VRef. The air pressure p due to this wind speed applied to the nacelle is

The nacelle size is approximately 4 m times 10 m which leads to a perpendicular force of
F⊥= 120 kN. This is quite large and requires a robust nacelle design.
Due to the different loading mentioned above, structural analyzes are rather complex.
They have to include stress analysis, buckling due to all load cases for housings, i.e., GFPR
coverfornacelleandspinner.Alsothesupportstructureitselfandalljointsbetweenhousings,
support structure and machine frame have to be considered. Typical load cases that need to
be considered are, e.g., wind loads from all sides for upwind (pressure), downwind (suction)
and lateral sides, live loads, snow and ice loads, dead loads of nacelle frame and crane, the

maximum crane capacity, gravity, to name a few. Not all loads act simultaneously, hence
one has to proof load combinations and in addition each particular design load comes with
a safety factor that vary from 1.5 up to 1.5 depending on the assumed uncertainty and the
appearance probability.
5.8.2
Spinner
Most of the modern hubs have a spinner to protect the interior of the hub. Nevertheless there
are also without spinner. This has the advantage of saving one additional component, i.e.,
the spinner, however, on he other hand maintenance work could more challenging, because
service personnel has to get outside. A picture of hub including the spinner is shown in
Fig.5.32 (left). The hub made of cast is blue and the spinner being glass ﬁber reinforced
plastic is white. In a maintenance situation the spinner is large enough to carry service
personnel. Hence to maintain the hub it is not necessary to leave the inner area, which
makes service more comfortable.
An FE model for the spinner is shown in Fig.5.32 (right). Besides wind loads also live
load of service personnel standing inside has to be considered for structural analysis. This
is indicated by the red arrow seen in Fig.5.32 (right).

Bearings
Awindturbineincludesanumberoflargebearings.Typicallythosebearingsarenotavailable
on shelf, but must be fabricated according to the speciﬁcation provided by the design house
or the manufacturer. Bearings to be considered are blade bearings connecting the blade to the
hub, main bearing that carries the rotor, and yaw bearing that enables alignment of nacelle
to the wind. In order to size bearings ultimate and fatigue loads are relevant.
6.1
Main Bearing
Main bearings are all rolling bearings, e.g., spherical roller bearings. Friction bearings (as,
e.g., used in propulsion unit of ships) are not utilized in wind turbines. The purpose of
the main bearing is to support the rotor and enable rotation. The 3D model of shaft and
bearing housing carrying the main bearing is shown in Fig.6.1. It carries aerodynamic loads
and weight of the rotor. Rotational speed of modern, large wind turbines is rather low, i.e.,
10 · · · 20 rpm. The bearing is chosen to ﬁt the rotor shaft. In other words the diameter of
the rotor shaft, which is designed to carry the rotor during life time under all circumstances,
dimensions the main bearing. Lubrication is mostly by grease, rarely by oil and in modern
wind turbines fully automated through a lubrication unit.
Bearing used for 3-point suspension are spherical roller bearings (SRB). Many wind
turbines use SRB. A bearing consists of two rings—outer and inner ring—and roller elements
in between. The roller elements can have a point contact with the raceway (like balls) or a
line contact (like a cylinder).
Spherical roller bearings used as main bearings should be self aligning. To this end the
raceway is double pitched and the rolling elements are slightly barrel-shaped. Hence the
raceway of the outer ring is concave, the inner ring has two raceways each shaped to match
the barrel-shaped rollers. In addition, the bore hole could be cylindrical or tapered depending
on the design of the local shape of rotor shaft. An example of a SRB arrangement is shown

Bearings
Fig.6.1 Main bearing at low speed shaft including main bearing housing
in Fig.6.2. Some companies that deliver such bearings also provide catalogs to determine
the preliminary dimension. These are helpful prior to contracting a particular company.
Nevertheless, ﬁnal sizing of the bearing will be done by the supplier based on the complete
loads to be provided by the designer.
When identifying relevant loads we distinguish between equivalent dynamic loads, equiv-
alent static loads and maximum radial loads. Input are radial Fr and axial Fa loads, for static
loads with maximum values denoted by F0r and F0a. The general structure of the formulas
used is
Fig.6.2 CAD model of a
spherical roller bearing

6.1
Main Bearing
115
P = X Fr + Y Fa
(6.1)
P0 = X0F0r + Y0F0a
(6.2)
wherein P(0) denotes the equivalent dynamic (static) load and X/Y(0) the radial/axial factors
of the bearing given in the catalogs. However, also a minimum radial load is relevant to keep
the rolling elements from sliding. The minimum radial load scales with the basic dynamic
load rating C, which is also indicated in the bearing catalogs. By use of the equivalent static
load and the static safety factor s0 the static load rating C0 is deﬁned by
C0 = s0P0
(6.3)
Guiding value for normal operation of a (spherical) roller bearing for structural safety is
s0 = 3.5. Finally, we consider durability equations. According to ISO 281 the nominative
lifetime in hours L10h is
L10h = 106 (C/P)p
60n
(6.4)
L10 = 106 (C/P)p
(6.5)
wherein the exponent p = 3 for point contact and p = 10/3 for line contact and n is the
rated speed in rpm, hence 60 n denotes the number of rotations in one hour. The second
equation then provides the number of turns to failure. The equation provides the lifetime
with failure probability of 10%.
To give an example we need to determine loads and the geometry of the shaft. The
geometry of the shaft is also determined by the loads, however, choice of material can change
the size. Since the shaft is highly loaded and the bearing costs are strongly increasing with
size, some optimal value has to be found. For the 2 MW sample wind turbine used in this
book, the size of the shaft requires a bore diameter of the bearing of 670 mm. The static loads
at the position of the bearing are F0r = 2000 kN, F0a = 600 kN for radial and axial loads
respectively. With this information we utilize the bearing catalog and ﬁnd a preliminary
bearing, e.g. by FAG with the designation “240/670-E1A-MB1” (FAG Schaefﬂer Catalog
2022). The catalog provides all needed data for preliminary calculation. i.e. Y0 = 2.34 for
static axial factor (the radial axial factor is always chosen X0 = 1.0), The basic load ratings
C = 10.5 · 106 N for dynamical loading and C0 = 21.1 · 106 N for static case. From Eq.6.2,
the equivalent static load P0 is then
P0 = 1.0 · 2000 kN + 2.34 · 600 kN = 3400 kN
Using a guiding value of s0 = 3.5 for normal rotating roller bearings and Eq.6.3 we get for
the actual basic load rating
C0 = 3.5 · 3400 kN = 11.9 · 106N < 21.1 · 106N

116
6
Bearings
which is smaller than the basic load rating and hence form static point of view the bearing
can be used.
To evaluate the dynamic load we utilize Eq.6.1, which refers to the number or rotations
that 90% of the bearing survive. The ratio of radial to axial forces is Fr/Fa = 600/2600 =
0.3 This value is larger than the design value e = 0.28 from the catalog table, which implies
factors of X = 0.67 and Y = 3.56, i.e., use of Eq.6.1 leads to
P = 0.67 · 2000 kN + 3.56 · 600 kN = 3476 kN
Using this value along with the basic dynamical load rating C in Eq.6.5 we ﬁnd for the
allowed number of rotations
L10 = 10.5 · 106
3.476 · 106 · 106 = 39.8 · 106
This has to be contrasted with the number of rotations during the 20 years lifetime of the
wind turbine. With rated speed of 15 rpm the maximum number of turns adds up to N =
15 · 60 · 24 · 365 · 20 = 158 · 106, which appears roughly 4 times larger than the allowed
value.
Note that so far we have assumed the ultimate value for P only. Instead of using one
value for 20 years only, we use a spectrum Fri for each time interval qi = t/20a. The idea
behind is that the load is not always maximum but varies from zero to maximum values.
The resulting histogram for the 2 MW wind turbine is a load duration distribution given in
Fig.6.3. The equivalent effective load Peff is given by

In this example Peff = 916 kN. This value is smaller, since during 20 years the wind turbine
load is not always a constant maximum value, but varies due to wind conditions. To ﬁnd
those quantitative values (of the histogram), we need to make a dynamical load simulation.
Depending on the basic dynamical load rating C we ﬁnd the allowed number of rotations
and the respective life time. They are shown in Table6.1.
Although preliminary sizing of bearings helps to speed up development process, ﬁnal
proof has to be performed by the supplier. To this end FE models are utilized modeling the
bearing including details of the roller bodies and in cases also the surrounding structure as
the vicinity is not rigid, but reacts elastically.
6.1.1
Bearing Housing
The main bearing is hold by a bearing housing that is ﬁxed to the main frame. The main
bearing housing attached to the main frame is shown in Fig.5.9. A drawing of the main
bearing housing for the 2 MW wind turbine of this book is provided in Fig.6.4.
For sizing, loads are introduced into the main bearing housing and analyzed by FE
methods. A result for extreme value analysis is provided in Fig.6.5. The machine frame
is cast from EN-GJS-350-18U-LT material. With a material safety factor of γM = 1.1 this
leads to an elastic strength of σR = Rp0.2N/γM = 200 MPa/1.1 = 182 MPa. As usual, for
ductile materials, the von Mises yield criterion can be used. The maximum stress appearing
in the analysis is 289 MPa which is above the yield value of 182 MPa. In this particular case
the ﬁnding is not critical, since all stresses above 182 MPa occur only in very small areas
with notches on single nodes. Therefore, these stresses will relieve due to plastiﬁcation of
the material and do not inﬂuence the durability of the structure.

Pitch Bearing
The blade or pitch bearing is the component between blade and hub which allows that the
blade can be turned around the blade axis. In early wind turbines the connection between
blade and hub was a ﬁxed connection, however, modern wind turbines usually have a bearing
for pitching the blade, e.g., if the power available in the wind becomes larger than the rated
power of the wind turbine.
In case of electrical pitch drive one of the bearing rings is geared, which is not necessary
for a hydraulic pitch drive. The bearing rings are ﬁxed via bolt connections to blade and hub
respectively. The blade bearing utilizes single-row or double-row ball-bearing slewing ring.
A sample is illustrated in Fig.6.6. Material for both bearing rings (with or without gear) of
the 2 MW wind turbine of this book is 42CrMo4V. Further parameters are listed in Table6.2.
Sizing of the blade bearing relies on loads at the blade root. The relevant extreme loads
for the 2 MW wind turbine are given in Table6.3.

Yaw Bearing
The yaw bearing is the component between nacelle and tower which allows that the nacelle
can be turned around the tower axis. The yaw bearing is a slow moving bearing, i.e., for
large modern wind turbines rotational speed is about 0.5◦/s. The purpose of yawing is that
the rotor can be aligned to the wind direction. Therefore the nacelle might turn several times
around the tower axis. In order to prevent damage from the electrical cabling system the
nacelle will stop after 2 · · · 3 turns, the wind turbine rotor will stop and the nacelle will turn
back into the original position while the power production is interrupted. To drive the system
one of the rings is geared. Besides single-row or double-row ball-bearing slewing ring along
with a braking system also friction bearings are utilized.
Material for both bearing rings (with or without gear) of the 2 MW wind turbine of this
book is 42CrMo4V. Further parameters are listed in Table6.4.
Sizing of the yaw bearing relies on loads at the tower top ﬂange (yaw bearing K2). The
relevant extreme loads for the 2 MW wind turbine are given in Table6.5.

Gearbox
Implementation of a gearbox into a wind turbine opens the possibility to utilize high speed
generators. High speed generators have the advantage that they are lightweight and can be
produced in a standard fashion. They are inexpensive to be fabricated, can be unitized and
easily exchanged in case of malfunction. The special challenges occurring in wind turbines
through high loading and high number of load cycles are then bound to the gearbox and its
integration into the rotor drive train and load ﬂow. There have been many gearbox failures
in the early history of utilization in wind turbines. However, by now, most of the challenges
are understood and solved. Nevertheless, in order to build a proper gearbox for any of the
concepts mentioned in this section, knowledge and experience within a manufacturer is a
mandatory prerequisite for a successful implementation into the whole structure. The load
situation for the gearbox is complex and need careful analyses in each case.
7.1
Gearbox Concepts
The purpose of a gearbox is to increase rotational speed, typically from about 10 . . . 20 rpm
which is the typical speed range of modern aerodynamic rotors to about 1000 . . . 2000 rpm
of the generator. In turn, the torque acting is reduced linearly with respect to the gear ratio
involved.
We distinguish two basic elements that are used to alter the gear ratio. One is by spur
gear the other by planetary gear. For wind turbine gear boxes these elements are combined
to optimize performance.
A spur stage inside a wind turbine gearbox consists, e.g., of two gear wheels, i.e., a drive
gear with large diameter and many teeth and a driven gear with smaller diameter and less
teeth. A sketch is shown in Fig.7.1. Sometime double helical gears are used, since they
produce less noise.

Fig.7.1 Sketch of spur gear
(left) and planetary gear (right)
A planetary gear is more complex. A simple sketch is shown in Fig.7.1 (right). It con-
sists of a drive wheel (green), so-called planetary carrier which carries several intermediate
pinions (blue), so-called planet pinions or simply planets. The blue wheels are kept in con-
currence by a ﬁxing outer ring gear (dark grey) and drive the central pinion (yellow) which
is the so-called sun-wheel. Alternatively, one could keep the green element ﬁxed to have
the planet wheels concur and use the dark grey ring gear as a drive gear. Also for planetary
gears helical gearing is utilized to reduce noise. Planetary stages realize a gear ratio of about
1:6.
Based on the power of the wind turbine a modern gearbox for rated power above about
2.5 MW mostly consists of two planetary stages and one spur stage. This concept is a result
of cost and efﬁciency studies.Total gear ratio is about 1:70 up to 1:110. Gear boxes for
smaller wind turbine predominantly consist of one planetary stage and two spur stages.
A schematic cross section of a gearbox with two planetary stages and one spur stage,
is shown in Fig.7.2. The ﬁrst planet carrier (green part) is connected to the main shaft via
a shrink disc. Also indicated are torque arms. The planet pinions are shown in blue and
the ring gear (dark grey) is connected to the gearbox housing. The sun pinion of the ﬁrst
planetary stage (yellow) constitutes the planet carrier of the second stage. The planet pinions
of the second stage are shown in green. The sun pinion of the second stage is the constitutes
the high speed gear driving the high speed shaft. This is connected to the generator with
a (preferably) ﬂexible coupling. Depending on the exact internal design high speed shaft
and low speed shaft may have different rotational orientation. This has to be checked before
adding the generator to complete the drive train.
An example of such a gearbox for a 2 MW wind turbine is shown in Figs.7.3 and 7.4.
This gearbox is for a 2 MW wind turbine and based on the three point bearing concept. It
utilized two planetary stages and one helical stage. With a mild redesign the helical stage
can be slightly adjusted to change the ﬁnal gear ratio. So the same concept can be utilized
for slightly different rotor speeds.
For the 2 MW wind turbine a top view of the outline of the gearbox with the relevant
components mentioned in this section is displayed in Fig.7.5. Total length given in the

7.1.1
Alternative Gearbox Concepts
Beside those mainstream gear boxes used many times in standard wind turbines there are
moreconceptsthatmeetchallengesandalsohavesomeadvantages.Nevertheless,production
has not yet reached industrial scales as is the case for the concepts mentioned before.
The fusion drive by Moventas utilizes two planetary stages to arrive at a medium gear
ratio. The respective generator built by TheSwitch is arranged around the second planetary
stage which then builds a very compact unit. The companies offers two versions one for
3 · · · 4.1 MW and one for 6 · · · 7.7 MW rated power output, depending on the actual rotor
size and hence rotational speed of the aerodynamic rotor. The diameter of the arrangement
is 2.3 and 2.8 m, which is rather small indeed, compared to direct drives.
Another innovative concept is provided by Voith, i.e. the Voith WinDrive. It utilizes a gear
box with two planetary stages and a planetary-type stage between gearbox and generator
wherein the ring gear is used to adjust the gear ratio to eventually keep the generator rotor
at constant speed. This is realized by a hydraulic torque converter that is driven by the same
sun wheel and drives the ring wheel. As a consequence the generator can be kept at constant
speed, even for variable speed of the aerodynamic rotor.
A further gearbox concept named AeroGears™was introduced by Renk for the Areva
offshore wind turbine. The basic concept was developed for a 1.5 MW machine. Integration
of this concept into the 5 MW Areva off shore wind turbine drive train is referred to as
the multibrid concept, which is highly integrated, uses a single stage planetary gearbox, a
medium speed generator and a single main bearing instead of a main shaft. This way tower
top mass is reduced. At times when is was build is was the lightest nacelle of 5 MW wind
turbine.
7.2
Shrink Disc
The purpose of shrink discs is to connect the low speed or main shaft to the gearbox entry
unit. The coupling has to be capable to withstand high torque. Method of choice in such
case is a frictional joint. Form-ﬁt joints, e.g., by bolts or tongue-and-groove joints are not
used for such high torque connections.
The rear end of the main shaft is positioned into a hollow entry shaft of the gearbox.
The hollow shaft of the gearbox is braced by a ring that can be tensed up and this way the
hollow shaft is pressed against the main shaft end. The ring is called shrink disc. A shrink
disc for this purpose is shown in Fig.7.6. The mode of action is demonstrated in Fig.7.7.
The red and blue rings are the main parts of the shrink disc. They are moved against each
other by tightening the bolts. Due to inclination between the red and blue rings the diameter
is diminished and as a consequence the hollow shaft is compressed. This is indicated by the
arrows pointing to the green area. Due to friction between the surfaces of main shaft (not
shown in the ﬁgure) and hollow shaft (green) of gearbox the joint is ﬁxed.

The shrink disc is sized by the maximum torque. An impression on dimensions can be
given through a preliminary sizing. To this end manufacturers provide torque tables along
with reasonable diameters and powers that could be hold by a shrink disc. E.g. rough values

total diameter of the shrink disc D = 1900 mm, bolt circle diameter A = 800 mm, total
length H = 430 mm, and a total possible length contraction of shrink disc e = 50 mm, to

name a few parameters. As a consequence the torque that can be hold by the shrink disc
is about 6800 kNm. Final sizing will be provided by the manufacturer based on a detailed
load simulation of the design house or/and OEM of the wind turbine.
7.3
Torque Support
The purpose of torque support is to keep the gearbox from rotation due to the torque imposed
to its entry shaft. Depending on the bearing concept, i.e., two bearing or three point support,
the torque support has additional tasks rather than just torque support. In the simplest case,
when the wind turbine rotor is carried by two bearings the gearbox is fastened to the main
shaft via previously mentioned shrink disk and the torque support just needs to cope for
the reactive forces induced to the gearbox by the torque. In case of three point concept
the torque support also carries off axial loading, which makes sizing more demanding. The
torque support is part of the main frame as shown in Fig.7.8. The gearbox carries pins that ﬁt
into the torque support, see, e.g., Figs.7.3 and 7.4. Pins and support are both made of steel and
an intermediate elastic material is used. This could be elastomers or a sandwich of several
steel shells and elastomers. The right choice is not so easy and requires some experience,
in order not to generate unnecessary resonances and/or constraint forces, depending on the
drive train concept. A detailed view of the bushing is provided in Fig.7.9.
Process of structural sizing of torque support uses ﬁnite element method and includes
the vicinity of the support as seen in Fig.7.10. To do so typical material properties for a 2
MW wind turbine are provided in Table7.1. Loads used refer to a 2 MW wind turbine with
three point support. The residual forces are provided in Table7.2. Vertical residual forces (x

direction) are generated by torque, horizontal perpendicular to the rotor axis (y direction)
are generated by the bending moment. The example is for two rotor diameter 87 and 93 m.
Results of the structural analysis (in this case van Mises stress) is provided in Fig.7.11.
Bolts are pre-tensioned and the load case for maximum vertical component on the right side
(FXNR) is applied. Equivalent (van Mises) stress is exceeding the allowed yield, hence in
this case equivalent plastic strain has to be analyzed. This is shown in Fig.7.12. The small
plastic deformation found are allowed in this case.
In case of rotor support with two bearings, loads are induced by torque only, since off
axial loads from the rotor are taken care of by the two bearing support. Hence layout of
torque support is less demanding. However, since the complete layout is statically indeter-
minate, additional loads are induced by reactive forces coming from elastic deformation of
the system. This is depicted in Fig.7.13. Due to deformation of the mainframe the rotor axis
pitches at the location of the torque support by amount , which amounts to a few mil-
limeters. Modulus of resilience of typical elastomer bushings is about 100 kN/mm. Hence

the reactive forces on the gearbox add up to a few 100 kN. Those reactive forces can be
reduced by employing hydraulic torque supports. The mode of action, e.g., as shown by
ESM Mitch GmbH, of a hydraulic torque support is demonstrated in Fig.7.14. Constraint
forces are annihilated due to use of hydraulic reservoir connected cross wise. Of course
elastomer elements for damping are still needed. However, the residual constraint forces are
much smaller.
7.4
Slip Ring and Rotary Union
“Slip ring” or “rotary union” is situated at the rear end of the low speed shaft of the gearbox,
see Fig.7.15. The purpose of the slip ring is to supply all components situated in the hub
and the blade with power and controller signals. The shaft is hollow to incorporate the
cables and/or pipes from slip ring to hub. Components in the rotor are electrical pitch drives
that need several kW of power, or in case that pitch is actuated via hydraulics, the hydraulic
medium is feed through the rotary union and pipes. Further on heating of blade needs several
10 kW power that will also be provided from the nacelle to the hub. Information signals
need a different cabling with rather low power level and could also be optical and contact
free.
Sizing of slip ring and number of ports have to be determined by the designer of the wind
turbine. Figure7.15 (left side) shows the ﬁnal position of the slip ring at the rear end of the
gearbox. The slip ring is a highly charged component as it is almost permanently running and
hence needs careful maintenance. On the other hand it is a relatively inexpensive component
that should be exchanged in case of malfunction, in order to prevent any more severe damage.

Bolt Connections
Bolt connections are substantial for wind turbines. In this chapter we focus on bolt connec-
tions between main structural components. These are joints between blade and hub, between
hub and rotor bearing, rotor bearing housing and main frame as well as main frame and tower.
Up to the bearing housing the mentioned connection are adjacent to rotary bearings and also
involve connections to the respective slewing rings. In addition there are bolts connecting
the tower sections.
8.1
Basics Concepts
Since the wind turbine is complex and hence addressed by many disciplines, as a conse-
quence, we are facing two ways of treating bolts inside a wind turbine structure.
Bolts treated according to mechanical engineering are all bolts inside the nacelle and the
connection to the tower top ﬂange. They are subject to small tolerances and their structural
proof is according to (VDI 2230) (or similar) addressing systematic calculation of high duty
bolted joints.
Bolts treated according to civil engineering are those of the tower (except the top ﬂange).
They allow for larger tolerances and proofs are done according to Eurocode 3 (2005) address-
ing the design of steel structures for buildings and other civil engineering works using the
limit state design philosophy.
Ultimate proof of bolts refer to compression strength and tensile strength. Bolts are not
allowed to exceed respective nominal stress values. High loading pressure of all participating
elementssuchasbolts,washers,nuts,ﬂangesshouldstaybelowthelimitingvalues.Slidingof
bolted connections is not allowed. In order to achieve proof against sliding surface treatment
is allowed, if necessary. Friction coefﬁcients can be enhanced by application of protective
coating, e.g., utilizing Interzinc™. Proof against shearing-off has to be provided as well.

Bolt Connections
Fatigue proof has to be done for the total life time of the structure, e.g., 20 or 25 years.
Damage should be <1. If the considered joint is not sliding (see previous paragraph) axial
loading is sufﬁcient for fatigue proof of bolts.
Loads for bolts are derived from the general load simulation and the respective load report
according to design standard. They are provided as sectional loads at certain key positions
of the wind turbine and hence need to be mapped to the exact position of the joint according
to the local geometry. This could be loads provided at the center of the bolt circle and hence
respective loads at bolt positions can be calculated from simple analytic formulas. However,
e.g., for the main bearing housing, geometry is more complex and hence ﬁnite element
methods are utilized employing a sufﬁciently detailed 3D model. In any case both, ultimate
and fatigue loads are needed to calculate stress and damage of bolts and its vicinity, i.e.,
thread, shaft, head, nuts, washer, and ﬂange. As mentioned in the begining of this section
guidelines to be used depend on the location of the bolts inside the wind turbine (nacelle or
tower).
An example of an FE model is shown in Fig.8.1. In case that the proof fails, one can
increase the number of bolts, the bolt circle diameter, or the size and strength of the bolts,
depending on design details.
From a modeling point of view, bolt connections can be considered as an arrangement of
springs. This is shown in Fig.8.2. Our description here is along the lines of the VDI guideline
(VDI 2230). On the left hand side bolts and plates are shown before assembly (initial state)
and right hand side shows the assembled state. Also the clamped parts due to their elastic
properties behave like springs. A volume near the bolt that is under pressure, the pressure
cone, determines the spring constant of the plates. In a well designed bolt connection the

pretension

spring constant of the clamped plates is much higher than the one of the bolts. The symbol
fP denotes shrinkage of the clamped parts due to FV , and fS denotes the elongation of bolts
due to FV .
The situation is illustrated in the so-called joint diagram Fig.8.3 where the length changes
due to FV are drawn in such a way that the curve meet in one point. The difference in slopes
reﬂects the difference in spring constants. With the elastic resilience δ the relation between
F and f reads
f = δF
(8.1)
It is one way to express the well known Hooke’s law.
What happens when an additional external (axial) load FA is applied to the joint? The
externalaxialloadleadstoalengthchangeofboltsandinturntochangeofplatecompression.
Length change of bolts is denoted by fSA and of plates by fP A. Both changes are equal,
fSA = fP A
(8.2)
as long as bolts are not elongated beyond the unloaded plate distance which means that
the bolt fall loose. Hence the residual clamp force FK R shown in Fig.8.3 should always be
larger zero.

138
8
Bolt Connections
The above mentioned changes of bolt length and plates compression due to operational
external loads FA can be allocated to respective forces FSA and FP A and used to (implicitly)
deﬁne the load factor  via
FSA = FA
(8.3)
FP A = (1 −)FA
(8.4)
Using Hooke’s law Eqs.8.1 and 8.2, the load factor can be related to the respective resilience
for bolts δS and plates δP
 =
δP
δP + δS
(8.5)
NumericalexamplesforresilienceareδS = 1.33 · 10−6 mm/N andδA = 0.21 · 10−6 mm/N.
Hence  = 0.14. This means that only 14% of the force FA is seen by the bolt.
Equation8.5 says that bolt and plates behave as parallel springs. When a force is applied
to this combination the weaker spring (bolt) experiences a lower force than the stiffer spring
(plates). This is the basic concept of a pre-stressed bolt joint. If the joint, for instance a ring
ﬂange with a number of bolts, is designed such that the pressure cones under the individual
bolts just touch each other, the complete assembly carries the load just as if it would be one
solid. Pivotal for the concept is the preload. Without it the bolt would just experience the
full FA. If the force is too strong, the preload will be lost. So a careful sizing of the joint
taken into account the loading, preloading and strength of components has to be done.
Improvement of bolted joints can be achieved by precisely adjusting the preload to an
adequate value. Also a larger δS/δP ratio can be achieved. E.g., resilience δS can be effec-
tively increased by increasing the length of bolts, i.e., clamp length. If plates have the same
size, this can be achieved by so-called anti-fatigue shanks or anti-fatigue sleeves. An exam-
ple for the latter is shown in Fig.8.4, where sleeves are used to attach the yaw drives to the
machine frame. Resilience δP can be decreased by full contact at the interfaces and/or by
optimizing the compression cone.
Finally, the ratio of L A referring to the length between basic solid and (idealized) load
introduction point in the connecting solid to clamping length L K . i.e., n = L A/L K , can be
decreased. This is illustrated in Fig.8.5 for anti-fatigue sleeves as an example and leads to
smaller effective load factor  →n.
In reality the loading situation is more complex. In most situations loading of the bolt
connection is not axial such that also a bending moment is applied. In addition the preload
also can be eccentric and thus cause more complex stress situation in the bolt. Such situations
are illustrated in Fig.8.6.

How is the preloading of the bolted joint carried out in the assembly process? A common
method is to apply a torque wrench. Although simple, for large highly loaded joints where
one seeks an economic solution this method is not sufﬁciently precise. In those cases a
more accurate method leading to precisely deﬁned preloads is by utilization of hydraulic
elongation of bolts. To do so, steps to follow are:
1. Preparation and Placement of tool
2. Elongation of bolt by hydraulic pressure
3. Fastening of nut (without additional effort)
4. Releasing the hydraulic pressure and dismantling of tool
5. Bolt in ﬁnal position
Special hydraulic tools are used for this process.

Preloaded bolt joints have to be checked on a regular base. There are processes that reduce
the preload like settlement behavior. This is a signiﬁcant share of the work when servicing
wind turbines.
8.2
Main Shaft to Hub
In the following we provide an example for a connection between main shaft and hub for a
2 MW wind turbine.
The main shaft to hub bolt connection consists of 58 bolts M36 × 335 of class 10.9
with standard metric thread. Thread length on both sides is 90 mm, shaft length is 155 mm.
Diameter of shaft is 31.1 mm. This connection is characterized as a tapped thread joint
with bolts screwed into the cast hub (material GJS-400-15) and the ﬂange of the rotor shaft
(material 48CrMo4) and the disc for locking the rotor (material S235 JRG1) are clamped.
This is shown in Fig.8.7 (left).
Structural proof of many-bolts connection can be reduced to the analysis a single bolt
of the joint. The single bolt connection consists of the bolt and the pressure cone generated
inside the clamped parts by the bolt. The distance of the bolts on the sphere with bolt diameter
is 81.2 mm. A sketch of the single bolt connection is depicted in Fig.8.7 (right).
Utilizing loads at the center of the ﬂange as provided through the load simulation the axial
FA and respective perpendicular forces F⊥can be calculated by the following formulas

Loads at the ﬂange center (F) can be calculated from the loads at the hub center (R).
For ultimate loads we ﬁnd load cases as provided in Table8.1 for the load simulation
to be considered in the proof. The analyses are performed against (1) slipping of joint, (2)

all involved components (such as washers) and (4) shearing of joint. As a result of analyses
for this particular joint the ratio of allowed limit stress to actual stress should be >1 and are
given in Table8.2.
For fatigue load analysis we utilize load spectra for the single bolt connection. In this
case only axial loads need to be considered. The load spectrum, i.e., histogram of load
cycles binned according to their occurrence is provided in Fig.8.8 (left). The proof utilizes
a reference stress curve according to (VDI 2230), which is a certain Wöhler line, dark black
line, in Fig.8.8 (right).

Main Bearing Housing
The main bearing housing holds the main bearing in the deﬁned position. It is connected to
the main frame by bolts. The geometrical situation is shown in Fig.8.9, which displays the
geometry for use in a ﬁnite element model. For proof all materials should be deﬁned. In the
sample case these are given in Table8.3. The relevant parameters for proof of this joint are
shown in Table8.4.
For this joint we only show the result of proof against slipping. The pictorial result in
shown in Fig.8.10. From inspection of the color coding, slipping is proven to be smaller
than 0.1 mm, which is sufﬁcient. Slipping is different at different places of the connecting
surfaces, since material is not stiff, but responses elastically to stress and connecting surfaces
can elastically and locally be deformed.

Tower Top
Connection between tower and nacelle is a slewing ring since the nacelle and hence the rotor
has to be aligned to the wind direction. A schematic drawing of the 2 MW sample turbine
is shown in Fig.8.11. The tower top ﬂange (yellow) is connected to the yaw bearing (red)
and the yaw bearing to the nacelle (purple). In addition, there might be a break disc (green)
clamped in either of the bolted connections, which is normally the one adjacent to the tower
ﬂange (yellow). Because of this complex mechanical functionality the tower top joint to the
nacelle is considered a topic of mechanical engineering rather than civil engineering which
is the case for the rest of the tower.
In fact, only one joint is symbolized by a bolt, i.e., the connection of the top ﬂange to the
outer ring of the yaw bearing. A bolt of the connection between inner ring of yaw bearing
and machine frame (main frame) is not displayed. The classiﬁcation of bolt in this joint is
given in Table8.5 for bolts on both, inner and outer rings.

Yaw and Pitch System
Yaw and pitch system are essential for the operation of the wind turbine. The pitch system is
also pivotal for the safe operation. Since they actively move other things, the yaw system the
nacelle and the pitch system the blades, they are also called actuators. Design of actuators
require knowledge in mechanical and electrical layout. In addition actuators are (mostly)
driven by closed loop control that are supervised by the wind turbine controller. Therefore
actuator systems are sometimes referred to as mechatronic systems. In the following two
sections we discuss different concepts for these systems and the route to the right sizing.
9.1
Yaw System
The yaw system is designed to keep the rotor, i.e., the nacelle of the wind turbine, aligned
to the wind direction. From control point of view only slow control is necessary for the
actuator, unlike, e.g. for the pitch actuator (see next Sect.9.2). In fact, two operational states
are distinguished: yawing and rest. During a lifetime one can assume that only 10% of the
time the wind turbine is yawing whereas for most of the time the nacelle is at rest and the
task of the yaw system is to keep the nacelle ﬁxed in the required position.
9.1.1
Layout
From mechanical point of view the yaw system includes a bearing consisting of a slewing
ring with one or two rows of roller elements. Yawing is performed by 2 · · · 8 drives. The
yaw motion during yawing is damped by brakes or by controlled interlocking some of the
drives. During rest the yaw system is kept in position by brakes. Brakes are either calipers
acting on a disc attached adjacent to the bearing or by brakes mounted inside the drives, or,

Yaw and Pitch System
Fig.9.1 Sectional drawing of yaw system carrier of the 2 MW GeoHo turbine
due to the high brake torque demand, by both. Also, if the number of drives is large enough
ﬁxing is also possible by complete interlocking the drives.
A modern yaw system is shown in Fig.4.8 for a 2 MW wind turbine. A respective
sectional drawing is shown in Fig.9.1. In this particular case the yaw drives are (almost)
equally distributed. Drives are mounted to the main frame and will turn the nacelle with
respect to the large gear ring seen in the lower part of Fig. 4.8. The gear ring will be ﬁxed to
the tower top ﬂange. Figure9.2 displays the same yaw system from below. In this case the
calipers of the yaw brake system and part of the brake disk can be recognized.
Alternatively to the above described yaw system, a friction bearing utilizing sliding
(brake) pads can be used. The sliding pads are pre-stressed and the drives need to overcome
the initial brake torque.
9.1.2
Sizing
The high and unsteady loads in different directions (bending and torsional w.r.t. the tower
axis) lead to high demands for the design of the yaw system. Utilizing a moderate damping

9.1
Yaw System
149
Fig.9.2 Yaw brakes of the 2 MW GeoHo turbine in assembly hall
by brake, when the nacelle is yawing, reduces small load amplitudes (all the ones that are
smaller than the brake torque) that would otherwise add to fatigue damage of the gear rim.
For sizing the yaw system the relevant load utilized is the torsion moment here denoted
by MXK2. Normally MXK2 is rather large during normal operation for wind speeds above
rated wind speed. In particular this quantity is used to size drives, brakes, gears, mounting
of drives, and bolting of bearings. The extreme (or ultimate) torsional load for the 2 MW
wind turbine is about 5800 kNm coming from normal operation at high wind speed.
Fatigue loads can be extracted from extrapolating design load cases to the design life time
of the wind turbine. To this end loads are binned into intervals and the respective exposure
time added. The result is known as load duration distribution shown in Fig.9.3. Note that
the distribution is given in a logarithmic scale.
In practice two operational variants have been utilized for yaw systems for the two
operational states.
Variant 1 consists of drives (D), motor brakes (B1) and mechanical brakes (B2). During
rest brakes B2 keep the nacelle in position up to a certain MXK2. If this value is exceeded
brakes B1 will add additional brake torque. During operation B1 will be released ﬁrst, then
B2 will be released up to a certain residual torque. The residual torque is useful in order
to suppress small movements of the nacelle due to back lash. The drives D will move the
nacelle against this residual torque. Drives D are sized such that they are able to move the
nacelle at all times up to few rare load peaks.

150

Yaw and Pitch System
Fig.9.3 Load duration distribution for torsional loads MXK2 around the tower axis of a 2 MW wind
turbine
Variant 2 consists of drives (D) with controllable torque and motor brakes B1. During
rest motor brakes B1 are engaged as well as drives are interlocked by using the brake torque
of the motors to keep the nacelle in position. During operation ﬁrst the motor brakes are
released and some part of the drives move the nacelle into the desired position whereas other
parts of the drives act against the movement to keep a small residual brake torque to damp
the small movements due to back lash.
Besides structural layout to secure mechanical integrity of the yaw system, also sizing
of the drives and brakes is necessary. This will be addressed in the following. In fact, the
operational strategy inﬂuences the sizing of those parts of the yaw system. We explain the
decisions to be made for the 2 MW wind turbine used in this book.
From inspection of Fig.9.3 we ﬁnd that MXK2 above, e.g., ±2500 kNm appear only few
hours during the design life time of the wind turbine. More precisely, by summing up all
the time bins above a limit of |MXK2| > 2,500 kNm we ﬁnd that the total time, where the
wind turbine experiences loads above this limit is roughly 11h in 20 years. Looking more
closely into the times series, we additionally ﬁnd that the events with loads higher than the
limit last few seconds only. This is generally the case and due to turbulence of wind. During
this time above the given limit the wind turbine can slip a few degrees which is acceptable.
Hence, we use the mentioned limit as a ultimate aerodynamic load assumption for sizing of
brakes and drives.
In addition to the aerodynamic load assumption mentioned before, the bearing also build
up a brake torque. This slewing torque can be calculated using an empiric equation usually
provided by the bearing manufacturer. As an example we show a formula originally provided

9.1
Yaw System
151
for the 2 MW turbine.
MXK2R = μ
2 (4.37 MBK2 + FXK2 D + 2.185 FSK2 D)
(9.1)
wherein D is the raceway diameter provided in Fig.9.1, μ = 0.006 the friction coefﬁcient,
FXK2 the axial force, FSK2 the radial force, MBK2 the residual bending moment and
MXK2R the resulting friction torque. The mean friction torque can be calculated by using
the mean values for the quantities on the right hand side. As an example we give results for
two different versions of the 2 MW turbine with 87 and 93 m rotor diameter in the Table9.1
Finally, for sizing the drives we need to include the residual brake torque engaged during
operation for reason mentioned above. A reasonable value for this wind turbine is 500 kNm,
however, the value might be slightly adjusted during initial operation of the wind turbine,
in case the brakes develop undesired sound during operation. The result for the 2 MW wind
turbine versions is shown in Table9.2. From a practical and commercial point of view one
would demand the same total drive torque for both variants which would be the maximum
of the design values found for the two variants.
In order to demonstrate how the previously mentioned slippage can be estimated prior
to operation, we use a simpliﬁed approach. In reality many factors inﬂuence slippage such
as inertia, deformation in the system, initial break loose torque, etc. To get an idea of the
order of magnitude, as a role of thumb, in a simpliﬁed approach, Newton’s law for rotating
systems can be used, i.e.,
M(t) = I ¨

where  is the yaw angle, I the moment of inertia of the rotor nacelle assembly around the
tower axis and M(t) the excess of the torsional torque MXK2 as provide by the design load
calculation. Since M(t) is given at discrete values for certain discrete time, the equation can
be integrated numerically and as a result we ﬁnd for the 2 MW wind turbine in question a
few degrees of possible slippage which is acceptable. As soon as the external torque M(t)
would be below the limit of |MXK2| = 2500 kNm the “uncontrolled” movement will stop.
Finally, the gear ratio has to be determined. One gear ratio stems from the gear rim of
the bearing w.r.t. the drive pinion and in addition a mechanical gearbox is needed, since
commercial drives usually operate at about 1500 rpm. The gear rim contains 211 teeth that
are driven by a pinion with 13 teeth. If we request a angular velocity of 0.5 ◦/s (or 1/12 rpm),
which is typical, an additional gearbox is needed with a gear ratio of about 1100.
9.2
Pitch System
The pitch system is located in the hub adjacent to the blade root. For safety reasons, modern
wind turbines have independent pitch systems for each blade, i.e., each blade has its own
drive, energy storage, and control. The pitch system allows to turn the blade around the
blade axis (pitch axis) and as such has several purposes
• Adjusting the global pitch angle
• Controlled start-up of the system with the help of pitching the blade from larger to smaller
angles
• Adjustment of pitch angle with a pitch speed of up to about 5 ◦/s during operation at
wind speeds v > vR to keep the rotor speed at rated speed
• In some cases adjustment of pitch angle below rated wind speed to optimize performance
or reduce loads (so-called ﬁne pitching)
• Perform normal and controlled (aerodynamic) stop with about 5 ◦/s
• Perform emergency stop with about 7 ◦/s as part of the safety system with the help of
energy storage, i.e., pressure storage for hydraulic pitch and batteries or capacitor storage
(so-called ultracaps) for electric drives.
9.2.1
Layout
A design example for electrical pitch is given in Fig.9.4. Position of electric drives inside hub
represents the most common arrangement. In few cases pitch drives are positioned outside
the hub, e.g., at blade root and hence the gear ring is not inside but outside of the bearing. If
the hub is large enough, maintenance appears more comfortable for the arrangement inside,
as shown in Fig.9.4.

pitch motor (3). Letters are referring to the rest of the drawing collection, not shown here.
The hub related to this drawing and ready for further processing during manufacturing of
wind turbine in the assembly hall is shown in Fig.9.6.
Since the blade pitch angle moves only within a quarter circle use of a pinion driven by
hydraulics is also possible. A design example for hydraulic pitch is shown in Fig.9.7. An
actuator of hydraulic pitch is shown in Fig.9.8.
For maintenance the pitch system should be equipped with a brake or lock to ﬁx the
blade angle at a certain position during maintenance (90◦or 0◦depending on maintenance
concept).
9.2.2
Sizing
For sizing the pitch system the relevant load utilized is the torsion w.r.t. to the blade axis
denoted by MXB. This quantity is used to size drives, gears and mounting of drives. The
extreme (or ultimate) torsional load for the 2 MW wind turbine is about 130 kNm coming
from normal operation at high wind speed with occurrence of gusts. This is about the load
expected once in 50 years, which is the event horizon for a wind turbine with a design life
time of 20 years.
For safe operation at all times the pitch drives have be designed such that this ultimate
torque MXB can be handled at all times.
Since the pitch system is decisive for the performance of the wind turbine, modern
simulation codes also include the pitch dynamically as, e.g., required by GL2010 guideline.
This means that in a simulation the blade turns to the new pitch position under inﬂuence

of external forces (in particular torque around the blade axis) acting on the blade and the
friction of the blade bearing (similar to the treatment for yaw bearing) as well as the inertia
of the whole system. In this case sizing of the drives can be done directly. In other words
a particular pitch system arrangement can be validated for the particular wind turbine in
question by simulation. In less sophisticated approaches that are still compatible to the IEC
61400 guideline the response of the pitch actuator to the pitch demand of wind turbine
controller is modeled by a PT1 element (ﬁrst order response). This means that the new pitch
position is reached in the simulation irrespective of control details and external forces with
a certain delay. From an academic point of view this is less desirable. From a practical point

156
9
Yaw and Pitch System
of view this requires some room for safety margins left to the experience of designers or
suppliers.
In practice only few types of electrical drives have been realized. Those are DC motors,
asynchronous motors, and servo motors. Since the pitch system is an important component
of variable-speed wind turbines, pitch speed and pitch angle must be precisely adjustable.
This qualiﬁes the drives to be used. In addition safety function, i.e., features of emergency
drive, must be reliable. Due to the complexity of the pitch system and its importance it
makes sense to engage experienced partners for design of pitch system for a wind turbine.
Partners that could also serve as system providers and have the necessary equipment, e.g.,
test facilities, to qualify the pitch system selected.
Since the pitch systems are independent of each other due to safety reasons, one could
as well provide individual pitch demands for each of the blades instead of one global pitch
demand provided by the main controller. Whereas the latter solution is well established and
widely used the individual pitch control (often abbreviated as IPC) is relatively new.
Individual pitch control utilizes measurements of the actual blade bending moments at
or close to the blade root, e.g., by ﬁber optic sensing or strain gauges. From the stress
data an algorithm determines an individual correction to the global blade pitch demand and
eventually correct the (global) pitch demand accordingly. This could be done independently
of the main controller.

10
Auxiliary Systems and Secondary Steel
Auxiliary systems are necessary to help the wind turbine being operated and maintained.
Example for auxiliary systems are mechanical brake and various cooling systems. Some
components such as fans are also consumers as they need power for operation. Auxiliary
systems may run permanently or occasionally. From an electrical point of view, in order to
dimension the transformer for the auxiliary systems this is recognized by partial average
load ranging from few percent (e.g., roughly 10% for the yaw system) up to 100% during
life time and on average. This information is needed to layout the auxiliary transformer used
to provide power to the consumers.
In this section we also include some remarks on secondary steel. Examples for secondary
steel are ladders and platforms inside the tower. The layout of secondary steel is also part
of the engineering process.
10.1
Mechanical Brake
Since the main brake system of modern wind turbines is based on aerodynamic brake by
pitching the blades, the mechanical brake system plays a supplementary role and is hence
sometimes just called parking brake. It is used during maintenance to hold the rotor in a
certain position or to align the rotor to the rotor lock device, since the hub can only be
entered, if the rotor lock is engaged. The mechanical brake is not sufﬁcient to secure the
hub. The second task is related to the safety chain or emergency stop of the rotor. At the
end of emergency stop case the rotor has to be brought to a complete standstill. The brake
is then activated, if the rotor speed is, e.g., below 0.5 rpm.
Only in design of some anterior wind turbines a mechanical brake was used as a main
brake system. Those brakes have been part of the safety system by “fail safe” layout. This
means that the brake are passively closed and opened actively. Hence in case any failure
occurs in the system leads to a sudden mechanical closing of the brake. Notably the structural

Auxiliary Systems and Secondary Steel
stress imposed to the drive train by this procedure is very high and therefore alternatives
have been developed.
10.1.1 Layout
The mechanical brake is normally positioned at the high speed shaft, after the gearbox.
Behind the gearbox the torque is reduced proportional to the gear ratio and hence the mechan-
ical brake can have a relatively small size. The mounting place for the calipers is shown in
Fig.10.1 and the complete mechanical brake integrated into the high speed shaft is shown
in Fig.10.2.
For direct drives, i.e., wind turbines without a gearbox, the mechanical brake can be
integrated at different places, e.g., adjacent to the main bearing or within the generator. The
operational concept is the same as before.
Mechanical brakes are usually operated by hydraulic pressure, however, also electrical
solution are utilized.
10.1.2 Sizing
Since the mechanical brake is not engaged during operation, but just used to stop the rotor
during idling or smaller rotor speed, the thermal and mechanical stress is rather low. Sizing
is according to design load cases occurring during maintenance. For a wind turbine with
Fig.10.1 Position of mechanical brake at the rear of gearbox

Fig.10.2 Mechanical brake mounted at high speed shaft and gearbox
gearbox the holding torque is about 10 kNm at the high speed shaft. The brake is closed
actively.
10.2
Meteorological System
Each wind turbine has a meteorological station to measure wind speed, wind direction and
ambient temperature. The meteorological station is normally placed on the roof top of the
nacelle, fairly behind the rotor. Examples are shown in Fig.10.3.
What is actually needed is the wind speed and the direction far in front of the rotor.
However, since obviously the rotor is the far most structure into upwind direction there
is literally no place for any component or system in front of the rotor. To compensate
the disturbance and the deceleration of the wind due to the rotating(!) rotor, signals from
the sensors behind the rotor need to be corrected. Compensation is an art by itself based
on parametric formulas where the parameters are mostly adjusted from experience and
separate ﬂow investigations. This will not be further addressed in this book. Since the
wind measurements (speed and direction) are not part of the (fast) control algorithm, but
merely needed for slower control (yawing) and/or operational alerts (cut-in, cut-out wind
speeds) placement of sensor behind the rotor is acceptable. Nevertheless, correction of
signals is important, in particular for aligning the rotor to the wind direction, and not to
reduce efﬁciency of energy yield of the wind turbine due to misalignment.

160

Auxiliary Systems and Secondary Steel
Fig.10.3 Examples of different realization of meteorological station on nacelle roof
In order to improve on that situation, what would be needed is knowledge of wind speed
and direction at some distance in front of the rotor. This is subject of ongoing research
and development and mostly based on utilizing Lidars.1 Such a Lidar might be placed on
the nacelle with beam directed into upwind direction. Since the blades are relatively small
free area between the blades appear to be enough space to detect the wind speed some
20 · · · 200 m in front of the rotor. There are quite a few challenges in utilizing such a Lidar

the speed of wind.

system in replacement of the standard MET system and therefore as of today, such a system
is not used in series production of wind turbines.
Temperature is also part of slow control and measured to check operation against allowed
upper and lower limits. In some cases temperature is also an ingredient to determine air
density to switch between different operational modes, if implemented and needed.
Finally, the roof top is also a suitable place for aviation lights as can be identiﬁed in
Fig.10.3 in the lower right picture.
10.3
Cooling and Heating
Cooling systems are required to cope with heat related to losses in the system. Losses occur
in mechanical and electrical components. They are unavoidable and the related energy is
eventually converted to heat. Total loss starting from aerodynamic power captured by the
rotor to electrical power delivered to the grid is about 10%. Wind turbines with a gearbox
have a little more losses and direct drive wind turbines a little less. In Table10.1 major losses
of components and systems are collected.
10.3.1 Basics Heat Exchange
Irrespective of details in layout, a heat exchanger brings two media close together, so they
can thermodynamically react to reduce their temperature difference and, due to heat transfer,
exchange heat. A rough sketch is provide in Fig.10.4. Heat ﬂow of a warm medium (w) can
be described by the following formula
˙Q = −ρw ˙Vw cp(w) (T1 −T2)
(10.1)
whereas the heat ﬂow to the cold medium (c) is
˙Q = −ρc ˙Vc cp(c) (T ′
1 −T ′

10.3.2 Layout
Layout of cooling systems are usually done by specialized companies according to the
requirements that have to be stated in the technical speciﬁcation.
10.3.2.1 Cooling of Gearbox
Primary cooling medium inside the gearbox is usually oil that is also used for lubrication.
This oil is cooled preferably through oil/air or alternatively by oil/liquid plus liquid/air heat
exchanger.
The oil/air heat exchanger is mostly situated above the gear box with pipes rigidly coupled
to the gearbox housing. The alternative cooling concept is used, if the outer cooler is at a
distance to the gearbox, e.g., roof top. However, it is obvious that though utilization of
two heat cycles this system is less effective. Simpliﬁed schematic diagrams are shown in
Figs.10.5 and 10.6.
10.3.2.2 Cooling of Generator
For cooling of generator we distinguish high speed generator (utilized with a gearbox) and
direct drive low speed generators.
The electrical structure of a high speed generator is preferably cooled by an air/liquid
plus liquid/ambient air heat exchanger or alternatively by a liquid/ambient air exchanger.
Heat transfer through the surface of the generator is rather small and simply taken care of
by the nacelle ventilation. Smaller wind energy converter up to about 500 kW rated power

are just equipped with cooling ﬁns and heat transfer is also into the nacelle. A simpliﬁed
schematic diagram is shown in Fig.10.7.
Due to the size of direct drive generators that are slowly rotating units cooling can be
realized by direct air cooling with puriﬁed ambient air. Such a solution needs ﬁlters to take
out dust and humidity. Such ﬁlters are widely used for gas turbines, even in an offshore
environment. No such ﬁlters are necessary for an air/ambient air heat exchange system as
the air inside the generator is not exchanged. Alternatively the generator is also cooled by
water and heat exchange is then via water/ambient air cooling system.
10.3.3 HVAC
HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning. Heating may be relevant for
cold climate conditions, ventilation and air conditioning is utilized inside the nacelle or other

closed rooms, such as tower basement, to provide a well deﬁned operational environment,
e.g., for the electrical and electronic components.
Nacelle ventilation is necessary to cope with the surface heat emerging from the various
components and systems in the nacelle, such as gearbox, generator, electrical cabinets, etc.
Ventilation is mostly passive through openings. In difﬁcult environmental conditions such
as dusty areas active ventilation is used to produce a slight overpressure in the nacelle by
using ﬁltered air intake. This way uncontrolled air intake via rotary junctions or leakage is
suppressed. Similar for offshore ventilation is active to keep salty air outside the nacelle as
part of corrosion protection measures.
Passive heat exchangers, e.g., for water/ambient air, are placed outside the nacelle on the
roof top. No vent is used, hence there is no additional energy consumption for this concept.
However, the system is subject to environmental effects. In particular, cooling capacity
increases with increasing wind speed, which is advantages. However, special care is needed
to secure corrosion protection. An example for passive cooling system is shown in Fig.10.8,
which shows the recent Nordex wind turbine N131.
Active cooling systems are more independent of the outer conditions. An vent is activated,
if necessary, which is also an additional consumer and potentially reduced the efﬁciency of
the wind turbine. Usually the cooling system is arranged in the rear part of the nacelle rather
than on the roof top. An older example of an active cooling system on the roof top was
used by Nordex up to about 2010 and shown in Fig.10.9 whereas a more recent solutions
of the same company with the cooling cabinet integrated in the rear of the nacelle is shown
in Fig.10.10.

Finally, there exist also solution with a primary passive cooling system supported by a
booster (active cooler) in case the passive cooling were not sufﬁcient.

Hydraulics
Hydraulics is an effective and inexpensive method to actuate pitch, brakes in drive train
and yaw system, and rotor lock. Hydraulics in wind turbines are useful, in case a linear
movement can be used for actuation. In this case large forces can be applied.

Hydraulic systems have quite a few advantages compared to alternative solutions, e.g.,
electrical brakes. Main advantage is the usually compact design compared to the large
forces transferred within limited space. The technology itself is very mature and total cost

level rather moderate. The obvious disadvantages is related to possible leakage and related
environmental damage.
An example of a hydraulic brake in a GE 1.5 MW wind turbine is shown in Fig.10.12
(left). Figure10.12 (right) shows a hydraulic brake including a view onto the adjacent brake
disc.

Tower Internals
The space inside the tower, close to the tower bottom, is widely used to place important
components such as converter cabinets, switch boards, control cabinets, transformers, etc.
In some wind turbines the mentioned components are located in part or all inside the nacelle.
A decision, where to place those components is usually due to superior business or technical
reasons.

Figure10.13 shows arrangements of the lowest section of the 2 MW wind turbine. On the
left side the cabinets are arranged on one platform at the tower bottom at the same level as
the door opening. Control cabinets are placed in the tower bottom to locally control the wind
turbine from the ground ﬂoor and to ease the interface to the outside world. Alternatively
cabinets can also be distributed across two levels. This is sketched in Fig.10.13 on the right
side.
Besides the cabinets in Fig.10.13 (left) also a ladder is shown opposite to a service lift.
Both equipment can be used to enter the nacelle. Power bars (alternative to power cables)
are also seen leading from the nacelle all the way down to the grid-side converter cabinet.
Due to the large weight of the components, the bottom platform is based on the concrete
foundation of the tower rather than connected to the tower shells. A second platform is about
1.5 m below the upper ﬂange of the section. This one is attached to the tower shell and used
for regularly maintaining the bolt connections and hence named service platform.
Generally tower shells are highly loaded structures and hence any attachment reduces
the load rating. Attachments have to be considered very carefully. There exist several pos-
sibilities to connect ladders, platforms etc. to the tower shell mentioned in the following
list.

• Since shell material is steel magnets can be used
• Brackets of platforms can be bolted to the ﬂanges
• Support of platforms in the tower bottom area can be done directly to the foundation, see
Fig.10.13 (right) for support of a second ﬂoor
• If brackets are welded to the tower wall, round bars or threaded rods are better than ﬂat
bars, in terms of resilience against fatigue loading
Note that as for the rest of the turbine, but also in particular for design and sizing tower
internals, HSE regulations must be taken into account, i.e., access widths, safety measures,
warning notices, etc.
This holds more so for service ladder and service lift. Service ladder should be equipped
with a fall arresting device. This can be seen as a center rail in Figs.10.14 and 10.15. Service
personnel has to carry personal safety equipment (PSE) with proper adapter to the local
system. Figure10.15 also shows the service platform from below with bars connecting the
platform to the tower shell. A service lift is shown in Fig.10.16. The platform opening has
to be secured by bars (left side). A typical lift by a supplier is shown on the right side of
Fig.10.16.
There are climbing alternatives to use of lifts and ladders which actively assist climbing
the ladder and are available, e.g., under the brand name “Highstep” or similar.

At the tower top the challenge is to lead the power cable from the nacelle to the tower
although the nacelle can be rotated around the tower axis. This is solved by using a cable
loop. This way the nacelle can be turned about 2 · · · 3 times before it has to be brought back
to original position by yawing the nacelle. A typical realization of the cable loop is shown
in Fig.10.17, in this case by Enercon.
