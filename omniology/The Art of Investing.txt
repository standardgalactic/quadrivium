The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
A
ccording to investing legend Warren Buffett, great investors are both 
born and made. Innate talent must be paired with hard work and 
honing investment skill to achieve truly outstanding results. One way to 
learn about investing is to study the backgrounds and strategies of some of 
history’s greatest investors. Sir Isaac Newton wrote, “If I have seen further, 
it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” In this course, we’ll examine 
the backgrounds and investment strategies of more than two dozen of 
the greatest investors who ever lived. By standing on the shoulders of 
the giants of the investing world, we will, at minimum, become more  
educated investors.
Personal background or history is important not only because it is 
sometimes fascinating, but also because it often plays a key role in 
the development of an investor’s philosophy. For example, Warren 
Buffett’s mentor, Benjamin Graham, lived through the Panic of 1907 
as a young child and The Great Depression as an adult. These 
experiences led him to become a pioneer in value investing, an 
approach that involves buying investments at a steep discount. These 
experiences also helped him formulate a core part of value investing: 
margin of safety, or protection against downside risk.
John Templeton traveled the world as a young man and saw an 
expanded set of investment opportunities, a mindset perhaps best 
encapsulated by one of his most famous quotes, “If you search 
worldwide, you’ll find more and better bargains than by studying 
only one nation.” This vision led Templeton to pioneer the field of

international investing and helped make investing in foreign firms 
almost as easy as it is to buy shares in Apple. Buffett, Graham, 
Templeton, and the many other great investors covered in this course 
developed an investment strategy based on their backgrounds, skill 
sets, resources, and personality types that ultimately led each of 
them to find enormous investment success.
This course will also serve as an educational primer on many different 
fields of investing, including stocks, bonds, commodities, mutual 
funds, hedge funds, and private equity. We’ll examine different 
techniques applied in each of these investment sectors. The topics of 
risk, return, and the different types of investments are of fundamental 
importance. But, the topic of investment is important far beyond the 
obvious notion of making money. To many, it is about freedom—
financial freedom. The freedom to live 
the life you want to live. The freedom to 
help your family, friends, community, and 
perhaps ultimately society.
We’ll wrap up with a case study that 
touches on many of the concepts 
discussed in the course and develop an 
investment checklist designed to help you 
ask the right questions about your personal 
approach to investing and craft your own 
investment philosophy. ■

Investing Skill, Strategy,  
and Temperament
W
hen asked if a great investor is born or made, Warren 
Buffett said he thought it was a little bit of both. He gave 
the example of Tiger Woods in his prime. He said Tiger Woods 
was born with an aptitude for golf, but that Tiger honed his craft 
by hitting 500 golf balls a day. Buffett and I both believe that 
investing is part art and part science. One way to learn about 
investing is to study the backgrounds and strategies of some of 
history’s greatest investors. Personal background or history is 
important because it often plays a role in the development of an 
investment philosophy.
Learning from Great Investors
>
>
For example, Warren Buffett’s mentor, Benjamin Graham, lived 
through both the Panic of 1907 and the Great Depression. These 
experiences led him to pioneer the investment approach known 
as value investing, which refers to buying sound investments at 
bargain prices. He learned to formulate a strategy called a margin 
of safety, or protection against downside risk.
>
>
From a macro perspective, the financial markets play an integral role 
in the world we live in by helping to raise money for growing firms.

○
Without financial markets, it would be almost impossible for 
a firm like Facebook to go from a startup run out of a dorm 
room to one valued at hundreds of billions of dollars in about 
a decade. 
○
○
Similarly, Home Depot, which pioneered the superstore home 
improvement concept and is one of the largest retailers in the 
world, started with two leased stores. Through the financial 
markets, it raised the money that enabled the company to 
open more stores and develop its concept. Today, Home 
Depot operates thousands of stores around the world, 
resulting in annual sales of about $100 billion.

There’s no single best way to become a successful investor, but 
many great investors follow several principles:
○
○
The great traders and investors in this course typically find a 
strategy that matches their skill set and personality type. 
○
○
They work extremely hard and usually love what they do. 
○
○
Nearly all of them continue to work well after the point at 
which they become rich. 
○
○
They don’t give up when things go wrong, and they learn from 
their mistakes.
Principles and Strategies
>
>
When you start investing your own money or have someone 
manage your money for you, you’ll have to ask yourself some 
tough questions. The first is whether you want to be an active 
investor, trying to outperform the market, or buy a handful of low-
cost index funds and try to make money passively.
>
>
Each approach has merit. Beating the market is tough, so buying 
and holding low-cost index funds that track the market as a 

5
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
whole—or special sectors, like health care or technology—makes 
sense for a lot of people.
>
>
The next question is what kind of asset you’d like to concentrate 
on. One approach is value investing: trying to buy stocks at a 
discount to their intrinsic value. Benjamin Graham developed this 
field of securities analysis during the first part of the 20th century.
>
>
Value stocks tend to sell at a discount to the market because of 
certain problems: A stock like Apple, for example, appeared to be 
on the verge of going out of business before Steve Jobs returned 
in 1997.
>
>
Another popular approach to picking stocks is called growth 
investing. Growth-oriented investors are less concerned about 
buying an asset at a discount. Instead, they seek leaders in an 
industry—the next Amazon. This school of thought was developed 
in the 1950s by Philip Fisher and Thomas Rowe Price.

6
Lecture 1 • Investing Skill, Strategy, and Temperament 
>
>
Growth and value are the main distinctions in strategy among 
stock investors, but other approaches are also available.
>
>
Before the Great Depression, publishing audited financial 
statements was optional for companies. Without hard data, most 
investors traded on rumors and hot tips or relied on a ticker-
tape machine that produced a thin strip of paper with a stock’s 
symbol, its price, and perhaps the number of shares traded. Some 
investors were really good at “reading the tape,” or figuring out the 
trend in security prices. Today, this approach can be viewed as an 
early form of technical analysis. 
>
>
Technical investors look for patterns in price and volume, believing 
that certain trends can be anticipated and will repeat themselves. 
Most believe in a phenomenon known as trend trading or 
momentum investing. If the trend is up, you’d buy. If the trend is 
down, you’d sell. 
>
>
Another way to differentiate stocks is by their size—that is, the 
amount you’d have to pay if you were to buy the entire firm, not 
simply one share.
○
○
Large companies tend to be more established, have a longer 
history, and may pay a dividend. 
○
○
Some companies generate more money than they can 
reinvest profitably. Giving a dividend to their shareholders is 
one way to use this excess cash. 
○
○
Dividend-seeking investors include many value investors and 
others who live off the income. 
>
>
Some analysts focus instead on small-capitalization, or small-cap, 
companies. Small-cap companies are usually valued at $1 billion 
or less.

7
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
○
○
Small companies typically outperform large companies by 
about 2% or 3% a year over time. They also introduce about 
50% more risk into your portfolio than their large counterparts. 
○
○
Risk refers to the volatility of returns in your investment 
portfolio, a statistical measure known as standard deviation. 
Small-cap stocks are also more volatile, and information 
about them may be scarce. 
>
>
The stock market gets most of our attention, but the bond 
market is much bigger. The bond market consists of government 
and corporate bonds as well as fixed-income securities tied to 
mortgages, student loans, and car loans. 
>
>
Most great investors tend to own concentrated portfolios of 
between 10 and 30 stocks. They tend to believe you can’t follow 
many firms in detail because of limited time and attention. If they 
are correct in their analysis, this method might be the best way to 
maximize returns. 
>
>
Other great investors favor a much more diversified approach. 
Successful quantitative investors run dozens, if not hundreds, 
of different investing models managed by quantitative analysts, 
or quants, who are the card counters of investing. They make 
many small bets with the odds in their favor, the results adding up  
over time.
>
>
Still other great investors use leverage, or borrowed money, as a 
key part of their investment strategy. 
Patterns in Investing Strategies
>
>
We can also discern other patterns in investing strategies: For 
instance, most investors tend to be focused on investments in 
their home country. Academics call this the home-country bias.

8
Lecture 1 • Investing Skill, Strategy, and Temperament 
○
○
Often, more information is readily available to us about our 
home country than about somewhere abroad. 
○
○
But the British-American investor John Templeton believed 
that chances to earn attractive returns increase with broader 
investment opportunities. 
>
>
At times, you can be your own worst enemy. Sometimes investors 
chase hot investments and buy near a peak. Then, when these hot 
investments cool off, they sell near the bottom, the classic misstep 
of buying high and selling low. 
>
>
A whole school of thought on the tendency of investors to make 
such mistakes is called behavioral finance. One investor, in 
particular, who made pioneering contributions in the field is David 
Dreman, known as a contrarian investor. He’s willing to buy 
what is out of favor—like tobacco stocks, when they were being 
investigated by the government—knowing that the bad times 
affecting a particular stock or industry usually don’t last forever.
Deeper Values
>
>
For many wealthy investors, transmitting values—the beliefs 
that generated their wealth, such as hard work, persistence, and 
integrity—is as important as passing on the value of their wealth.
○
○
Many of the great investors featured in this course have 
signed The Giving Pledge, a program set up by Bill Gates and 
Warren Buffett, under which the wealthy pledge to give away 
at least half of their fortunes. Among the signatories featured 
in this course are Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman, and Ray Dalio.
○
○
Warren Buffett, for instance, once purchased a farm for his 
son Howard but charged him market-rate rent. Buffett believes 
that just handing someone a big check is not a way to build 
character or achieve lasting happiness. 

9

>
Financial freedom means different things to different people, and 
it doesn’t have to include becoming a billionaire. A more modest 
goal to which nearly everyone aspires is a comfortable retirement. 
Becoming a more competent and knowledgeable investor will 
most likely help you in that regard and may also give you a greater 
sense of control over your financial future.
>
>
During one of my meetings with Warren Buffett, he discussed the 
increase in the standard of living around the world, in part because 
of the role of the financial markets in providing capital to innovative 
firms that need it to grow. He said the average American today 
lives better than John D. Rockefeller, because we have better 
technology, better health care, and a host of other advances that 
were not available more than a hundred years ago. Investing 
and the financial markets are about the impact that successful 
investing and innovative firms can have on our lives—and on the 
world around us.
>
>
Increasing your knowledge about investments is a way to increase 
your control of financial matters. It means being guided by 
wisdom, not fear, when bad things happen in the markets and in 
the economy.

Lecture 2 • Benjamin Graham and Value Investing

Benjamin Graham  
and Value Investing
B
enjamin Graham is known as the father of value investing, 
and he pioneered a rigorous, quantitative approach to 
security analysis. Graham started investing during the early 
1900s. The landscape then was very different. For example, 
investing was not considered a respectable profession. It was 
viewed more like astrology or a game of chance—run by crooks 
and people with inside information. Using inside information was 
legal at the time. His groundbreaking investment strategy had its 
roots in his own personal hardship.
The Graham Effect
>
>
Investors before Graham used an early form of technical analysis, 
making investment decisions based on stock price and volume 
changes. Before the days of Bloomberg terminals and Yahoo 
Finance charts, the ticker tape listed that information, which was all 
that many investors had with which to make an investment decision. 
>
>
Back then many investors viewed stock as little more than a 
vehicle to speculate. One of Benjamin Graham’s seminal insights 
for securities analysis was in viewing stock as the ownership of  
a business. 

11
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
>
>
The point is this: The difference between Graham’s strategies 
and some of the investment techniques used by his peers and 
predecessors is like the contrast between Babe Ruth and the 
home run hitters who came before him. It is not an exaggeration 
to say that Ben Graham changed the investing landscape forever.
Graham Mini-Biography
>
>
Benjamin 
Graham 
was 
born 
Benjamin Grossbaum in London 
in 1894. He moved with his 
family to New York when he was 
a year old. His father, Isaac, ran 
successful 
retail 
businesses 
selling 
high-end 
chinaware 
and figurines. The family led a 
comfortable life on Fifth Avenue 
in Manhattan. 
>
>
When Graham was 9 years old, 
his father died, and the business quickly went downhill. Then his 
mother, Dorothy, was wiped out trading stocks during the Crash  
of 1907. 
>
>
Graham was an excellent student and received a scholarship 
to Columbia University. After graduating second in his class in 
1914, his Wall Street career began with the firm of Newburger, 
Henderson and Loeb. He quickly rose through the ranks and 
made partner at the age of 26.
>
>
He left Newburger in 1923 to set up his own firm with business 
partner Jerome Newman. The investment vehicles related 
to this business agreement became known as the Graham  
Newman Partnerships. 
>
>
In 1928, he finally returned to Columbia to teach. His 1934 book, 
Security Analysis, which has since become known on Wall Street 
Benjamin Graham

Lecture 2 • Benjamin Graham and Value Investing 
as the bible of value investing, was created in large part from the 
lecture notes of his classes. 
Graham Investment Philosophy
>
>
One of Graham’s principles was that if you had the money, you 
shouldn’t buy a share of stock in a company unless you would be 
willing to buy the company itself. 
○
○
With that caveat, you would certainly be interested in the firm’s 
financials. Focus on the balance sheet, which lists assets on 
the left and liabilities and net worth on the right. 
○
○
You probably would also want a business that had stood the 
test of time. For example, you might want to make sure it had 
survived a couple of recessions. 
○
○
You probably would also like to buy the business at a discount 
to what you thought it was worth, just in case something went 
wrong or you miscalculated its value.
>
>
Graham summarized these ideas into the concept margin of 
safety. He phrased it this way: “To have a true investment, there 
must be present a true margin of safety. And a true margin of 
safety is one that can be demonstrated by figures, by persuasive 
reasoning, and by reference to a body of actual experience.” 
>
>
Graham focused on quantitative measures of value. He first 
looked at the value of existing assets, such as cash, inventory, 
and property, by examining a target company’s financial 
statements. Next, Graham looked at current earnings. Lastly, 
and only in rare circumstances, he considered future profits, but 
only in the core competence area of a firm with a sustainable  
competitive advantage.

13
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
Mean Reversion
>
>
The concept of mean reversion is a major underpinning of the value-
investing philosophy. It means that past winners often become 
future losers, while past losers often become future winners. 
>
>
Graham was also early to recognize the role of market psychology 
in investing. Today, the field of investor psychology is known by 
academics and practitioners as behavioral finance. 
>
>
Value investments often occur because of market psychology, 
with fear and greed moving prices away from their long run or 
equilibrium prices. 
Net–Net
>
>
One of Graham’s favorite value-oriented strategies to pick 
investments was to find companies selling for less than their cash-
liquidation value. He called this deep-value strategy Net–Net. 
○
○
Graham’s Net–Net calculation started with the cash and cash 
equivalents item on a firm’s balance sheet and then added 
a conservative portion of accounts receivable and inventory. 
Then he subtracted all liabilities. 
○
○
He compared this aggregate amount of cash and hard assets 
to the stock market value of the firm. If the company was 
selling for less than market value, Graham would consider it a 
bargain under his Net–Net deep-value approach. 
>
>
He estimated that his Net–Net strategy provided his partnerships 
with returns of approximately 20% a year, double the market’s 
historical return.

14
Lecture 2 • Benjamin Graham and Value Investing 
Northern Pipeline
>
>
The investment that put Graham on the map was known as the 
Northern Pipeline Affair, a Net–Net investment. Northern Pipeline 
Company was one of Standard Oil’s 34 spinoff companies. Its 
business involved transporting crude oil to a Standard Oil refineries.
>
>
After the Supreme Court decision breaking up Standard Oil, 
Graham combed through the forms that energy firms filed with 
the Interstate Commerce Commission. He found that Northern 
Pipeline had $95 a share in railroad bonds and other liquid assets. 
Yet the stock was trading for only $65 a share, and it paid a hefty 
9% annual dividend yield. 
○
○
In 1926, Graham’s partnership acquired roughly a 5% stake 
in Northern Pipeline, and he asked the company to distribute 
more cash to shareholders. Northern Pipeline’s management 
wasn’t pleased at being told what to do and actively avoided 
his requests.
○
○
In 1928, after contacting other shareholders and requesting 
their help, Graham put together proxies, or voting power, 
equal to 38% of Northern Pipeline’s shares and was able to 
get himself appointed to the firm’s board of directors.
>
>
Over time he persuaded the company to pay out $70 a share 
in special or extra dividends. Coming in the midst of the Great 
Depression, it was a very attractive return from Graham and  
his partners.
Government Employee Insurance Company
>
>
GEICO was Graham’s most famous investment. GEICO wasn’t 
Net–Net, but it had unique value, such as its superior business 
model of selling car insurance. Graham purchased almost half of 
the company for his investment partnerships in 1948, at a 10% 
discount to its book value. 

15
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
>
>
GEICO rode the wave of the post-World War II American 
automobile industry. Among its advantages was the clever 
business model of selling directly through the mail at discount 
prices. Drivers benefited from lower car insurance prices, while 
GEICO benefited from its lean infrastructure, avoiding the need to 
build a costly network of offices and salespeople. 
Seven Defensive Investing Strategies
>
>
Graham made a distinction between the enterprising investor and 
the defensive investor. The difference was based on the ability of 
the investor to put time and effort into the research process.
>
>
For the defensive investor, Graham suggested 7 factors in 
selecting a common stock. Unlike his Net–Net strategy, there will 
almost always be a fair number of firms that meet these 7 criteria. 
○
○
Adequate Size. Graham viewed adequate size in a target 
company as more than $100 million in 1971 dollars, or 
about $600 million today. He viewed traditional, government-
regulated utilities as safer than industrial firms, so you could 
cut the adequate size threshold in half for utilities. Graham 
reasoned that larger firms are less likely to go out of business; 
that they probably have resources, scale, and experience to 
weather any storm. 
○
○
Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition. Graham defined 
this term as current assets at least twice the size of current 
liabilities. He also thought total liabilities should not be 
higher than working capital (that is, current assets minus  
current liabilities). 
○
○
Earnings Stability. Graham defined earnings stability as positive 
earnings for at least 10 consecutive years. This rule eliminates 
many cyclical firms and those younger than 10 years.

16
Lecture 2 • Benjamin Graham and Value Investing 
○
○
A Strong Dividend Record. This criterion recommends 20 years 
or more of uninterrupted dividends. This rule eliminates most 
growth stocks, since the vast majority don’t pay dividends.
○
○
Organic Earnings Growth of at Least 33% over the Past 10 
Years. This hurdle is not huge since the United States’ Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) historically grew at about 3% per 
year. But it does eliminate businesses that are stagnant or 
shrinking, even if they pay dividends or generate a lot of cash.
○
○
A Moderate Price-to-Earnings Ratio. Graham defined this 
term to be the current price of the stock as not more than 15 
times its average earnings over the past 3 years. This number 
makes sense to many investors, since the long-term P/E ratio 
for U.S. stocks is about 15. 
○
○
A Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets. Graham defined a 
moderate price-to-assets ratio as a firm trading for less 
than 1.5 times its book value. Book value is also known as 
accounting net worth. It’s equal to all of the firm’s assets minus 
all of its liabilities. This factor of less than 1.5 times book value 
also rules out most growth stocks since they often trade at a 
high multiple of Price to Book.
>
>
In his later years, Graham suggested another simple value formula: 
Create a portfolio that consists of at least 30 stocks with P/E ratios 
less than 10 and debt-to-equity ratios less than 50%. Hold each 
stock until it returns 50%. If it doesn’t achieve a 50% return after 2 
years, sell it no matter what. Graham back-tested this formula and 
found it to earn about 15% a year over the previous half-century.
Graham’s Legacy
>
>
Benjamin Graham made seminal contributions to measuring 
value, viewing stock as the ownership of a business, and investing 
with a margin of safety. He made clear the distinction between 
speculation and investment: “An investment operation is one 

17
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and 
an adequate return. Operations not meeting the requirements are 
speculative.” 
>
>
Many of the most successful investors of the 20th and early 21st 
centuries were hugely influenced by his work.
>
>
Value investing requires analytical rigor, discipline, patience, and 
willingness to go against the crowd. Graham was able to follow 
this approach, and his investment firm posted annualized returns 
of about 20% per year from 1936 to 1956—roughly double that of 
the market.

Warren Buffett:  
Investing Forever
W
arren Buffett had success written all over him at a young 
age, but his investment strategy began to take shape 
only after he met the value investor Benjamin Graham. Buffett 
initially embraced Graham’s strict value investing strategy by 
looking at companies in a quantitative manner and trying to buy 
companies for the equivalent of 50 cents on the dollar. Buffett’s 
contribution to the concept of value investing was to find high-
quality companies selling at a discount and to let the moat 
around these companies protect his investment, enabling him to 
hold them for his favorite holding period—forever.
The Birth of Berkshire Hathaway
>
>
Warren Buffett always ranks near the top of Forbes’s list of the 
richest people in the world, and virtually all of his net worth has 
been generated by investing. As the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, 
his investment holding company, Buffett typically is paid $100,000 
a year; unlike many hedge fund managers, Buffett doesn’t skim off 
a large percentage of the investment profits he generates.

growing up in Omaha. While still in elementary school, he sold

packs of Wrigley’s gum and cans of Coca-Cola, both future 
investments for him. He bought his first stock at the age of 11 and 
filed his first tax return at the age of 13.
>
>
After finishing his undergraduate degree at the University of 
Nebraska, he applied to Harvard and was rejected. It turned out to 
be a blessing in disguise, because he was accepted at Columbia 
and studied under the man who would change his investing life, 
the pioneer of value investing Benjamin Graham.
>
>
When Graham decided to wind down his investment business, 
which Buffett had joined in 1954, Buffett set up his own investment 
business through a series of partnerships that were, in essence, 
hedge funds. In 1969, Buffett decided the stock market was 
overvalued and shut down the investment partnerships. He 
recommended 3 options to his partners at the time. 
○
○
Take the cash from the liquidated partnerships. 
○
○
Invest with his friend, the value investor Bill Ruane, of the 
Sequoia Fund. 
○
○
Take shares in a company he controlled—Berkshire Hathaway. 
>
>
Buffett acquired Berkshire shares in 1962, when it was a struggling 
textile maker. The textile business never turned around, but Buffett 
used the cash flow to acquire other businesses. One of Berkshire’s 
investing hallmarks was insurance, which historically accounts for 
the bulk of its profits. 
○
○
An insurer has the use of every insurance premium for a 
period of time—from a day to months to forever—before it 
has to pay a claim on someone’s behalf. This time-value of 
money, called the “float,” is a boon to an investor like Buffett, 
who can put it to good use.

Lecture 3 • Warren Buffett: Investing Forever 
The Moat as a Competitive Advantage
>
>
Eventually, Buffett moved away from Graham’s strict approach. 
He continued buying companies at a discount, but his focus 
shifted to high-quality companies, especially those with a durable 
competitive advantage—what Buffett called a moat—a buffer 
around a company’s core business that makes attack difficult 
for the competition. Two popular approaches to analyzing 
a company’s moat are Porter’s 5 Forces and Morningstar’s 
Economic Moat Framework. 
>
>
Michael Porter is a Harvard Business School economist who 
in the 1980s developed a framework to help explain the impact 
of industry structure on performance, generally referred to as 
Porter’s 5 Forces. 
○
○
The threat of new entrants. Certain businesses require 
massive capital to get started. The Boeing and Airbus 
commercial-aircraft manufacturing business is a case in point. 
The harder it is for a new firm to enter a market, the greater 
the competitive advantage of the firms already in that market. 
○
○
The threat of substitute products or services. Although some 
products have no substitute, most industries offer a variety of 
substitutes: Coke vs. Pepsi. The fewer substitute products or 
services, the greater the competitive advantage.
○
○
The bargaining power of customers. The Internet has given 
customers great power. Best Buy went from being a dominant 
company to one struggling to survive because customers 
could search for better prices on Amazon.com and other 
websites. 
○
○
The bargaining power of suppliers. The less a firm is impacted 
by its suppliers, the greater its competitive advantage. The 
De Beers cartel of South Africa controls about 35% of the 
diamonds produced in the world. De Beers has extraordinary 

21
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
bargaining power when dealing with jewelry merchants. 
Conversely, clothes can be manufactured fairly cheaply in 
many places around the world, so companies like Nike have a 
lot of power in their supplier relationships. 
○
○
The intensity of competitive rivalry. Firms in the airline 
industry, such as U.S. Airways, went bankrupt because of 
intense competition. Conversely, the less intense the rivalry, 
the greater the competitive advantage.
>
>
Morningstar, a firm known for its research on mutual funds, 
created a framework for its research rating based to a large extent 
on a company’s moat. Like Porter, Morningstar identified 5 factors. 
○
○
The first factor is the network effect. Why do people shop at 
eBay? Because millions of items are for sale. Why do people 
join Facebook? Because nearly all of their friends are on it. 
Why do people shop at Amazon.com? For the huge selection 
as well as the millions of reviews. Morningstar believes a 
network effect occurs when the value of a company’s service 
increases, as more people use the service.
○
○
The second factor is intangible assets. A patent is an 
intangible asset that provides legal protection lasting up to 20 
years. A brand name is an invaluable asset that can be hard 
to quantify, but easy to see in action. 
○
○
The third factor is cost advantage. The concept of a cost 
advantage can easily apply to many industries. For example, 
stories abound of Wal-Mart and Home Depot driving their 
smaller competitors out of business because they couldn’t 
match the larger firms’ low prices. Having a cost advantage 
also gives these companies the opportunity to raise prices 
without worrying about losing the bulk of their customers.
○
○
The fourth factor is switching cost. Imagine if you had a new 
alarm system installed in your house. It would be expensive to 

22
Lecture 3 • Warren Buffett: Investing Forever 
switch it for a new system, even if the new system had lower 
monthly fees. The same concept applies to other products. 
○
○
The fifth factor is efficient scale. Efficient scale relates to a 
niche market served by a small number of companies—in 
some cases, only one. For example, building a hospital is a 
massive undertaking, so there is likely to be only one in each 
town or county.
>
>
Buffett came to believe that a better approach to value investing 
would be to buy high-quality companies with a moat around 
their businesses. His 1963 investment in American Express was 
perhaps his first major purchase in sync with this philosophy. 
○
○
The story begins with salad oil. Though American Express is 
known today for its financial products, the firm has operated 
in a number of finance-related businesses. One was 
warehousing: Amex would lend money against the inventory 
of a company’s goods, stored in a warehouse that Amex’s 
employees could inspect.
○
○
Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation borrowed 
money against its inventory of salad oil. But the company 
committed fraud, filling huge barrels with water and sprinkling 
salad oil on top. Eventually, the fraud was uncovered, with the 
result that Allied Crude filed for bankruptcy. 
○
○
Amex was on the hook for $150 million, or about $1.5 billion 
in 2015 dollars. In the wake of the salad oil scandal, Amex’s 
stock fell 50%. Buffett thought this was a bad but temporary 
misstep and that the core business was intact and the damage 
to Amex’s brand name would eventually be repaired. 
○
○
Buffett bought 5% of American Express, 40% of his 
partnership’s assets at the time. The result was that Buffett sold 
his partnership’s shares in Amex about 5 years later at more 

23
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
than 5 times the profit. Berkshire has long since staked a new 
position in American Express and added to it over 25 years.
Boldness in a Crisis
>
>
The epicenter of the financial markets crisis was the housing 
industry and the subprime mortgages lent to people with poor credit 
ratings. Bank risk managers reasoned that if the borrower couldn’t 
pay the mortgage, they could simply take the house as collateral. 
They believed the house would rise in value so they wouldn’t 
lose on a diversified portfolio of these loans. When consumers 
defaulted on their loans and real estate prices crashed, excessive 
leverage (debt-to-equity ratio) on the part of both consumers and 
banks led to financial disaster. 

24
Lecture 3 • Warren Buffett: Investing Forever 
>
>
Purchasing a house with a 20% down payment results in leverage 
of 5 to 1; many banks were leveraged at a ratio of 30 to 1 or more. 
The investment bank Bear Stearns was one of the first casualties of 
the housing and financial markets crisis. It was sold to JP Morgan 
for $2 a share. Lehman Brothers, an investment bank that had been 
around since 1860, declared the biggest bankruptcy ever. 
>
>
In this financial environment in September 2008, Buffett had the 
confidence to invest in Goldman Sachs and General Electric 
Capital Corporation. Buffett invested $5 billion in Goldman and $3 
billion in GE convertible preferred stock with a 10% dividend. By 
March 2011, Buffett earned $3.7 billion in realized and unrealized 
profit on Goldman Sachs. By September 2011, he made at least 
$1.2 billion from his GE investment.
Some Losing Investments
>
>
But even The Oracle of Omaha can make blunders. Buffett often 
refers to Berkshire’s purchase of Dexter Shoe Company as one of 
his worst investments ever. In 1993, Berkshire paid $433 million for 
the Maine-based shoe company. Buffett’s biggest mistake wasn’t 
that Dexter’s shoe business deteriorated rapidly. It was that he 
paid for the deal in Berkshire stock, which has risen exponentially 
since the purchase. He has rarely used Berkshire stock in future 
acquisitions and had a successful investment in the dominant 
casual shoe company, Nike. 
>
>
His investment in IBM was also criticized by some investors, who 
viewed IBM as a dinosaur in a technology world dominated by 
Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and the like. Buffett first started 
buying IBM in the first quarter of 2011. He invested more than $13 
billion at a cost basis of $170 a share. Recently, IBM was trading 
at roughly $160 a share, resulting in a paper loss of more than 
$750 million.
>
>
In the end, the numbers speak for themselves. In the 50 years 
after Buffett took over Berkshire in 1965, the S&P 500 was up 

25
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
11,355%. In contrast, over the same period, Berkshire’s stock was 
up an amazing 1,600,000%.

Fisher and Price: 
The Growth-Stock Investors
P
hilip Fisher and Thomas Rowe Price Jr. are the two 
individuals most associated with growth investing as a valid 
and important investment strategy. In extreme cases, growth 
stocks have the potential to go up 1000% or more from inception. 
Occasionally, you’ll find a growth stock in the bargain-basement 
bin. But, usually, it’s up to you to make the assessment that a 
growth stock will keep growing, and that paying a somewhat high 
price today is a good gamble for a stock that is headed higher.
Growth Stocks 
>
>
A growth stock is like a first-round draft pick: A lot is expected and 
it is in great demand, so it usually sells at a high price. One reason 
is that a stock can split. 
○
○
You might own 100 shares of a stock trading at $50 a share, 
for a total of $5000. 
○
○
After a 2-for-1 stock split, you would now own 200 shares 
of the stock at $25 a share, but the aggregate value would 
remain the same: $5000. 

27
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
>
>
Relying on price alone might not be a meaningful way to 
differentiate between growth and value stocks. Thus, analysts look 
at other measures of valuation. The two most common are the 
price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and the price-to-book ratio. 
○
○
The P/E ratio is the price of a share divided by its annual 
earnings per share. If the P/E of the market is at 15, any stock 
with a P/E of less than 15 would be considered a value stock, 
while a stock with a P/E higher than 15 would be considered 
a growth stock.
○
○
The price-to-book ratio is the price per share of the stock 
divided by the book value—that is, the accounting value or net 
worth figure on the balance sheet—per share. 

28
Lecture 4 • Fisher and Price: The Growth-Stock Investors
○
○
A high price-to-book ratio suggests a growth stock: It’s 
valued in part on its future potential. A low price-to-book ratio 
indicates a value stock: It might be undervalued relative to its 
intrinsic worth.
>
>
Another way to differentiate growth from value stocks is the 
average valuation level of the market. Anything above the current 
market average is considered to be a growth stock, while anything 
below average is considered a value stock. 
Philip Fisher
>
>
Philip Fisher was born in San Francisco September 8, 1907. He 
attended Stanford University and earned a bachelor’s degree in 
economics. In 1931, he set up his own investment advisory firm, 
Fisher & Company, retiring in 1999 at the age of 91. 
>
>
For many years, Fisher taught an investments course at Stanford, 
and his location in the San Francisco and Silicon Valley area 
positioned him to become an early investor in several venture 
capital and private equity investments. 
>
>
Philip Fisher is probably best known for his bestselling book, 
Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, in which he lays out his 
investment philosophy.
Investment Strategy
>
>
As a growth investor, Fisher looked for companies with the 
potential to significantly grow sales for several years into the 
future. The quality of a firm’s sales force was one of the factors 
that Fisher assessed. A firm that grows sales at a faster rate than 
the industry is one sign of a good quality sales organization. 
>
>
Fisher was also one of the first investors to conduct rigorous 
fundamental analysis, which goes beyond looking at a company’s 

29
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
financials to include talking to management, competitors, 
suppliers, former employees, and others. 
>
>
Fisher looked at the integrity of a target company’s management. 
Signs of quality management included the following factors: 
○
○
Management talks freely to investors about its affairs when 
things are going well and when they’re not.
○
○
The firm is able to keep growing when a product has run its 
course. Can they come up with a new and improved version? 
Or pivot to selling a somewhat related product? 
○
○
The company’s research and development function, or R&D 
is robust. Does a significant part of a company’s sales come 
from new products? 
>
>
Profit margins differ dramatically by industry. For example, 
supermarkets might have profit margins in the low single digits, 
while software or pharmaceutical firms often have profit margins 
greater than 20%. Growth stocks typically have above-average 
profit margins. 
>
>
Fisher would often ask a company’s management what it was 
doing to maintain or improve its profit margins relative to its 
competitors, and he liked companies that had a focus on profits 
for the long term. 
>
>
Fisher advocated owning a relatively small number of investments 
in a portfolio—roughly 30. He felt that owning too many stocks 
made it impossible to watch all the eggs in all the different baskets. 
He felt that buying a company without a detailed understanding of 
the business could be riskier than limited diversification. 
>
>
Fisher also believed that when finding attractive investments 
is hard, the market as a whole might be overvalued; you should 
consider taking some money off the table.

T. Rowe Price

>
Thomas Rowe Price Jr. was born in born in Glyndon, MD, March 
16, 1898. He earned a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from 
Swarthmore. 
>
>
After a brief stint as a chemist at DuPont, Price realized that 
his passion was in the financial markets, and he joined the 
Baltimore brokerage firm of Mackubin Goodrich, today known as 
Legg Mason. He worked his way up to become the firm’s Chief 
Investment Officer, but he wanted to develop his ideas about 
growth stocks. 
>
>
After a disagreement with the other executives at the firm, he left 
in 1937 to set up T. Rowe Price Associates. He charged a fee for 
his investment services, in contrast to the commission approach 
that was widespread at the time. 
>
>
Price produced tremendous long-term returns. If you invested 
$1000 in his recommended stocks in 1934—with dividends 
reinvested—it would have grown to $271,201 by the end of 1972 
during which time $1000 invested in the market as a whole grew to 
only about $66,000. 
Investment Strategy
>
>
Price is probably best known for his life-cycle approach to 
investing. He felt that the risks of owning a stock increase when 
the industry it competes in matures. He wanted to buy stocks 
when earnings were increasing or accelerating. The industry life 
cycle typically has 4 stages. 
○
○
A period of rapid and increasing sales growth. For example, 
think about the early stages of the Internet, when many 
startups occurred and the aggregate industry experienced 
exponential growth. 

31
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
○
○
A period of stable growth. Consolidation tends to occur during 
this phase. Smartphones are one example. Even after cell 
phones had been around a while, the ability to turn a phone 
into a mini-computer with millions of apps resulted in stable 
growth with a limited number of firms capturing the lion’s 
share of the profits.
○
○
Slowing growth or maturity. Coca-Cola’s stock might be 
an example. Today, it might be too big and its market too 
saturated to consistently grow at double-digit rates.
○
○
Minimal or negative growth. The industry revenues and 
earnings are in relative decline. The railroads were an example 
of this factor after being eclipsed by the automobile, but they 
found a second life in transporting increased commodities, 
rather than people. 
>
>
Price’s preferred hunting ground was the stable growth phase since 
it is more predictable and less volatile than the startup phase.
>
>
Within the growth-stock universe, Price differentiated between two 
types of growth. The first is cyclical, where the magnitude of the 
industry’s growth is tied strongly to the economy. For example, 
during the 1950s auto sales grew sharply. 
>
>
The other type is stable growth. In this case, sales are not highly 
dependent on the specific phase of the economic cycle. For 
example, health care stocks can grow strongly during a recession. 
>
>
Price also looked at a range of criteria:
○
○
Superior research and development activities likely to spur 
future growth. 3M—a stock Price held for 33 years—is one 
company known for its R&D and innovation. 

32
Lecture 4 • Fisher and Price: The Growth-Stock Investors
○
○
Avoidance of cutthroat competition. Firms that engage in 
teamwork are more likely to be stable and around for the  
long term.
○
○
Relative immunity from government regulation. This criterion 
knocks out several industries, including utilities, financial 
services, and energy.
○
○
Low total labor costs but fair employee compensation. Costco 
made a reputation for generating great growth in its stock 
price while paying above-average wages to its employees 
relative to other firms in the industry.
>
>
Besides high growth in sales and earnings per share, Price also 
wanted stocks with at least a 10% return on invested capital. 
Return on invested capital can be calculated a few ways, but one 
popular approach divides net income by capital, basically the 
value on its balance sheet of its debt and equity.
>
>
Many industries are defined by a sort of Darwinian process 
of elimination for achieving high profits. Price recognized this 
dynamic and suggested finding the most promising company or 
companies in a growth industry. He also provided some insight on 
how to determine when a firm was losing its edge.
○
○
Companies lose patents and new inventions may make 
old inventions obsolete. For example, Pfizer’s stock price 
struggled for years after its best-selling cholesterol drug, 
Lipitor, went off patent. 
○
○
The legislative or legal environment can get worse for a firm, 
affecting its ability to grow. For example, defense firms are 
largely dependent on the federal budget. 
○
○
The costs of labor and raw materials also affect a firm’s 
profitability significantly. For example, the price of jet fuel is 
one of the largest costs to running an airline.

Conclusion
>
>
Philip Fisher and T. Rowe Price Jr. helped establish growth 
investing as a valid strategy, and their focus on the long term or, 
more accurately, the very long term, was novel at the time.
>
>
Fisher’s book, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, was 
one of the first bestsellers on the subject of personal finance and 
played a part in transforming the stock market from a playground 
for the rich into a legitimate arena for savings and investments. 
>
>
T. Rowe Price thought that investing in a leading company in a 
fast-growing industry was like sailing with the wind at your back. 
He fleshed out his ideas by carefully looking at sales growth, 
earnings growth, profit margins, and return on invested capital. He 
bought leaders and held them for long periods of time—several 
decades in some cases.
>
>
Price’s philosophy of putting customers’ interests first was a novel 
idea when he established his firm in the 1930s, and his method 
of doing business won out. His excellent investment performance 
added great value to his clients. And today his namesake firm, T. 
Rowe Price, manages roughly $750 billion.

Lecture 5 • Harry Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory

Harry Markowitz’s Modern 
Portfolio Theory
N
ot until the 1950s did we have a rigorous way of measuring 
risk. A young graduate student named Harry Markowitz 
published an article in The Journal of Finance related to his 
doctoral dissertation at the University of Chicago. Markowitz 
made the immense contribution of putting risk on equal footing 
with return. His work in this area won him a Nobel Prize in 
Economics. Before Markowitz, risk played second fiddle to 
return. People took kind of a shotgun approach when trying 
to reduce risks by diversifying across assets, companies, and 
industries, in an imprecise manner.
Developing the Markowitz Portfolio Theory
>
>
Modern portfolio theory has its roots in Markowitz’s work in the early 
1950s. It’s still called modern portfolio theory all these decades later 
because changes in investment thought over the past 50 years 
have been incremental or evolutionary, rather than radical.
>
>
Many great accomplishments in life start out with what appears to 
be a random series of coincidences. Markowitz was looking for a 
dissertation topic in the early 1950s. He was waiting outside his 
advisor’s office when he met a stockbroker. 

35
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
○
○
The broker suggested that Markowitz write his dissertation 
on something related to the stock market. Markowitz’s 
advisor thought the idea had merit and sent him to discuss 
possible topics with the dean of the business school, who 
recommended a book called The Theory of Investment Value, 
by John B. Williams. 
○
○
The essence of this book is still taught in finance classes: The 
price of a stock is equal to the value of its future dividends, 
adjusted for the time value of money. That is, a dividend of $1 
today is worth more than a dividend of $1 in the future. 
○
○
Markowitz concluded that if you followed Williams’s logic, 
you would wind up with a portfolio of a small number of 
stocks because everything else had an inferior return. But in 
practice, Markowitz knew, people diversified their portfolios 
fairly widely. 
>
>
The book, Introduction to Probability, by James Uspensky, 
profoundly influenced Markowitz’s thinking. Its formula for the 
variance of a weighted sum essentially is used to calculate the 
variance of a portfolio—a popular measure of risk. 
>
>
Markowitz also learned about the production possibility frontier 
concept, which posits that an economy makes tradeoffs in what it 
produces. It can produce a lot of one good and nothing of another 
or some combination. Markowitz now had the idea to create a 
frontier that made a tradeoff between risk and return.
 Variance and Correlation
>
>
Although there is no uniform way of measuring risk, many 
economists focus on measures of volatility. The standard deviation—
the square root of variance—is one widely used measure of volatility. 
Markowitz used standard deviation as his primary measure of risk, 
but he recognized the possibility of using other measures of risk as 
well, such as returns below a certain threshold.

36
Lecture 5 • Harry Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory
>
>
Markowitz had the further insight that the risk of a portfolio is 
primarily based on the interaction of the portfolio’s holdings, not on 
the risk of the securities individually or in isolation. He arrived at this 
insight, in part, from the formula on variance in Uspensky’s book.
○
○
According to Markowitz’s Portfolio Theory, two securities that 
are very risky in isolation—say a retail stock in Singapore and 
a health care stock in Brazil—might have less risk than two 
blue chip stocks in the United States because the U.S. stocks 
probably move in tandem because of their dependence on the 
U.S. economy. 
○
○
In contrast, retail sales in Singapore probably have little to do 
with health care in Brazil. One may zig, while the other zags. 
This lack of common movement reduces the overall risk of  
the portfolio.
○
○
The mathematical term for the way two assets move with 
or against each other is correlation, a number that ranges 
between negative one and positive one. Two securities with a 
positive correlation move in lockstep: When one goes up, the 
other goes up, and they have little diversification. The art of 
picking a diversified portfolio is to select securities that have 
low correlation and positive expected returns.
The Optimal Portfolio
>

Markowitz’s remaining challenge was to find the best portfolio for 
any particular person: an optimal portfolio. Markowitz returned 
to the notion of the production possibility frontier and imagined a 
graphed curve that shows the range of portfolios that maximize 
return for a given level or tolerance of risk. 
>
>
Markowitz called this curve the efficient frontier. Any portfolio 
below the efficient frontier is inefficient, and no rational person 
would select it because it would yield a lower return and/or higher 
risk than another possible portfolio.

Risk tolerance is estimated by an indifference curve that measures 
willingness to trade off outcomes—in this case risk and expected 
return. The optimal portfolio for you is the place where your 
indifference curve matches the efficient set of portfolios. 
William Sharpe 
>
>
What if all investors tried to maximize their returns according to 
their risk tolerance? William Sharpe set out to find the answer 
in his own Ph.D. dissertation. It described a way to simplify the 
calculation of efficient portfolios that were the output of Markowitz’s 
Portfolio Theory.

He continued to think about what prices would look like in 
equilibrium if everyone tried to maximize the returns for a given 
level of risk. Sharpe’s insight was that the only risk worth paying 
for is risk that can’t be diversified away—that is market risk, or 
what academics call beta.
>
>
Sharpe developed a model showing that the expected return on any 
risk asset is equal to the risk-free rate of interest plus the market risk 
of the asset (beta) times the market risk premium as a whole. The 
model is known as the Capital Asset Pricing Model or CAPM. 
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
>
>
The risk-free rate, say a fixed-income security issued by the 
government, is virtually free of default. It should be the minimum 
hurdle for any investment to pass. 
>
>
To this risk-free rate add beta. The average beta of the market as 
a whole is one. Therefore, stocks with a beta lower than one are 
less risky than the market. Stocks with a beta greater than one are 
riskier than the market. 
>
>
The market risk premium is the expected return on the market 
minus the risk-free rate. The market premium is tied to market 
psychology, so it can expand or contract. On average, it tends to 
be around 6% or 7%.
>
>
According to the theory, a portfolio of high beta stocks yields a 
high return. When the market goes up, such portfolios tend to 
outperform the market and low beta portfolios tend to underperform 
the market. But when stocks go down, portfolios of low beta stocks 
tend to lose less than high beta portfolios.
>
>
Sharpe published the Capital Asset Pricing Model in 1964, and 
since that time other academics have been finding chinks in its 
armor. Perhaps the most important paper published on this topic 
was by Eugene Fama and Ken French. 

39
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
○
○
They found that with data going back to the early 1930s, the 
CAPM worked pretty well. It showed a straight line relationship 
between risk and return, as predicted by the theory. 
○
○
But for the period from 1966 to the present, the theory held 
up less well. High beta stocks returned less than expected 
and low beta stocks returned more than expected. In some 
respects, the theory was turned upside-down: Many low-risk 
investments outperformed many high-risk investments.
>
>
Given these results, Fama and French set out to better explain the 
relationship between risk and return. They found two factors that 
mattered greatly: size and style. 
○
○
Size is the market value or market capitalization of the firm. It 
equals the stock price times the number of shares outstanding. 
Over long periods, small cap stocks outperform large cap 
stocks. This finding makes intuitive sense, since small firms are 
nimbler and can grow quickly from a smaller base. 
○
○
Style refers to growth or value. Value stocks historically return 
more than growth stocks over long periods because growth 
stocks tend to be glamorous, and investors often bid them up. 
Eventually, some run into competition or have missteps and fall 
back down to earth. Since not much is expected of value stocks, 
they often fix their problems and show a surprise upside. 
>
>
Professors Fama and French used the price-to-book variable to 
differentiate between growth and value. The price part of the ratio 
is the market capitalization that measures size. The book part of the 
ratio in the denominator is the net worth item on the balance sheet. 
○
○
Book value equals all the assets on a firm’s balance sheet 
minus all its liabilities. A firm with a lower than average price-
to book-ratio is considered to be a value stock, while a firm 

40
Lecture 5 • Harry Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory
with a higher than average price-to-book ratio is considered to 
be a growth stock. The historical average price-to-book ratio 
of the Standard and Poor 500 is about 2.5.
>
>
Combining the two factors results in the following historical results: 
○
○
Small cap value stocks usually have the best performance 
over long periods. 
○
○
Large cap growth stocks usually have the worst performance 
over long periods. In the short run, investors might gravitate 
toward the safety of large cap growth stocks, especially during 
times of market distress, but over the long term, fear usually 
fades, and these investments tend to provide lower returns.
Momentum and Liquidity
>
>
Momentum investors buy stocks that have been rising and sell 
or sell short investments that have been falling. In the short run, 
say a year or less, researchers have found that momentum works. 
High flyers keep flying and losers keep falling.
>
>
Liquidity refers to the ability to sell an asset quickly and at fair 
market value: Your house is probably not liquid, but blue-chip 
stock, U.S. Treasury bonds, notes, and bills are liquid. 
○
○
Researchers have found that over long periods, investors get 
paid to own illiquid assets. These assets are basically another 
type of risk.
○
○
During times of distress, the opposite usually holds. That is, 
people gravitate towards the safety of liquid investments.
>
>
According to the theories and empirical evidence, if you want to make 
the most money, buy illiquid, small cap, value stocks that have upward 
momentum. The stocks that tend to have the lowest return are the 
most liquid, large cap growth names, with downward momentum. 

41
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders

>
But if you follow this approach, be prepared to hold onto your hat 
when the market is falling, because in the short run you will lose 
the most money with this kind of security.

ndex funds are mutual funds that track the performance of 
specific index, like the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average. They’re not sexy, and they’re unlikely to help you get 
rich quickly, but today they account for more than 20% of all 
mutual fund assets. An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is an 
investment that is constructed like a mutual fund but trades like 
an individual stock. The theoretical underpinning of the value 
provided by index funds is intense competition. 
Making the Market versus Beating the Market
>
>
Because investors will act on important information when 
they come across it, market prices usually reflect all relevant 
information. Such a market is said to be efficient. An entire theory 
attaches to this thought process, called the efficient market 
hypothesis. Its roots go back to 1900 and the doctoral dissertation 
of French mathematician Louis Bachelier, who argued that prices 
typically follow a random pattern.
>
>
The concept of efficient markets is upsetting to many active fund 
managers. It basically says that a monkey throwing darts at the 
stock pages of The Wall Street Journal will select a portfolio 

43
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
that performs about as well as one chosen by professional fund 
managers. The reason is that investors compete intensely; over 
time, competition swallows all the easy money opportunities. 
Only new information impacts the price of a stock, and that is, by 
definition, unpredictable.
>
>
Noble laureate Eugene Fama breaks the efficient market 
hypothesis into 3 forms, or information sets: 
○
○
Weak-form efficiency, wherein investors can’t consistently 
beat the market using historical price and volume data. 
○
○
Semi-strong 
form 
efficiency, 
wherein 
investors 
can’t 
consistently beat the market using any public information; 
not only the historical price and volume information, but 
also a company’s financial statements, and whatever other 
information is available. 
○
○
Strong-form efficiency, wherein investors can’t consistently beat 
the market using any information, whether historical price and 
volume data; public information; or private, inside information.
>
>
The bulk of the academic studies of the efficient-market 
hypothesis find that the market is both weak form and semi-strong 
form efficient, but that the market is not strong-form efficient. 
Rather than citing a laundry list of academic studies, perhaps 
the best “proof,” of weak and semi-strong market efficiency is the 
performance of professional fund managers. Most can’t beat a 
simple index, despite their advantages. 
>
>
An index tracks a basket of stocks. The oldest is the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average, which tracks the performance of 30 blue 
chip stocks. Index funds have very low trading costs, since they 
essentially buy and hold forever. The typical cost of an index fund 
is about 0.2%, and sometimes much less. Some index funds 
charge no fee, with the sponsoring company hoping to make 
money by also selling the customer some other product or service.

An index fund helps answer at least two important questions. 
The first is, “How did the market do today?” You need to 
measure market performance to answer that question. 
○
○
The second is, “How is my portfolio doing?” To answer that 
question, you probably want to compare the performance of 
your portfolio to a benchmark like a market index such as the 
S&P 500.

A quantitative group within Wells Fargo created the first index 
fund in 1971. It was an equal-weighted index based on a group 
of large stocks trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Equal 
weighted means the price changes in the smallest stock have 
the same impact on the index returns as the price changes in the  
largest stock.
>
>
John Bogle, the founder and retired CEO of the Vanguard Group 
created the first index mutual fund in 1975. This landmark fund, 
based on the performance of the S&P 500, changed the financial 
landscape in ways that Bogle probably never imagined.

John Bogle
>
>
John Bogle was born May 8, 1929, in Montclair, NJ. His family, 
like many others at the time, lost most of their wealth during the 
Great Depression. Nevertheless, he attended the Blair Academy 
on a scholarship. He also worked at a series of jobs to help pay 
for school expenses. Bogle attended Princeton University, also on 
scholarship, where he studied economics. One afternoon, in the 
Princeton library, Bogle came across a Fortune magazine article 
titled “Big Money in Boston.” 
>
>
Mutual funds, as we know them today, had originated in Boston 
in 1924, and most of the funds at the time operated in that region. 
Bogle decided to write his senior thesis on mutual funds. His 
thesis found that the average mutual fund didn’t outperform the 
market, and he suggested that the industry would be best served 
by lowering sales charges and management fees. 
>
>
Princeton alumnus Walter L. Morgan—the founder of the 
Wellington Fund—read Bogle’s thesis and offered him a job. By 
the mid-1960s, he made it clear that Bogle was in line to run the 
firm. Bogle officially became president of Wellington in 1967 and 
CEO in 1971. Wellington was an actively managed investment 
firm—it did not follow the passive management strategy of index 
investing that Bogle prescribed—and it remains so to this day.
○
○
The late 1960s were a bull market in U.S. stocks, and the 
funds that did the best employed momentum and high turnover 
strategies. They owned names like Xerox, Polaroid, and IBM 
and other well-known growth stocks. The investment mindset 
at the time was that these companies were so strong that 
they could be successfully bought regardless of their price. 
The thinking, which was eventually shown to be flawed, is that 
these companies could grow their way out of any problems. 
○
○
Wellington’s performance in the mid-1960s was disappointing 
and, in 1966, Bogle made the decision to merge with Thorndike,

Doran, Paine and Lewis. The go-go stocks began to fall a short 
time later and ran into a terrible bear market during the 1973–
1974 period, when the S&P 500 fell by about half.
Vanguard
>
>
Vanguard was not organized as a traditional for-profit corporation, 
but rather as a mutual share company. Vanguard returns all its 
profits to the mutual funds it administers. This practice results in 
lowering expense ratios even beyond the relatively low costs of 
index fund-based investing. In a mutual form of ownership, the 
shareholders are the owners. 
>
>
Vanguard quickly expanded into running its own funds: first active, 
then passive (or index) funds and still offers many actively managed 
funds that account for about one-quarter to one-third of the firm’s 
assets. But even these are relatively low cost, and the net profits 
from the management fees of running the funds accrue to the 
shareholders of the funds. With about $3 trillion in client assets, 
Vanguard is a major presence in the mutual fund industry today. 
>
>
At the end of 1975, when Vanguard launched the first index mutual 
fund, some critics said that trying to market average returns 
was un-American. Bogle was hoping to raise $150 million at the 
launch, but raised only $11.3 million, and it would be another 
decade before the fund had any material competition in index 
based investing. But over time, people couldn’t argue with the 
fund’s performance, tax efficiency, and bargain-basement fees. 
Advice for Investors
>
>
John Bogle stepped down as CEO of Vanguard in 1995 and left 
its board in 1999. He has written about 10 books, in which he 
lays out his investment philosophy. Bogle cautions against paying 
a lot of money for financial advice. Although not denying that 
some investors could benefit from using advisors, for example, 

47
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
to prevent them from doing irrational things with their money, he 
questions how much value advisors can add to performance.
>
>
Bogle believes that past fund performance may offer some 
predictive value in establishing the risk of a fund, and its long-term 
consistency, but it should not be overrated or overemphasized. 
For example, a fund that owns mostly utility and consumer staples 
stocks is likely to have less risk than the market as a whole over 
long periods, assuming the fund doesn’t materially change its 
strategy or types of holdings.
>
>
Bogle also suggests that we be somewhat wary of star mutual fund 
managers. For every Peter Lynch or John Neff who consistently 
generate strong returns, many one- and two-hit wonders call a 
dramatic market turn and later badly underperform.
>
>
Bogle cautions awareness of the law of large numbers for actively 
managed funds. That is, the bigger a fund gets, the harder is it 
to outperform. One reason is that large funds are generally tilted 
towards large stocks that are widely followed; the manager is 
unlikely to uncover something unknown by the market, generally a 
precondition for outperformance. 
>
>
For nearly all investors, Bogle suggests a long-term buy and hold 
approach. He advises looking at your portfolio once a year so you 
can have the miracle of compound interest and returns work in 
your favor without the urge to make too many changes.
>
>
John Bogle and Vanguard also played a leading role in two other 
low-cost, index-oriented strategies. These are target (or horizon 
date) funds, and tax-advantaged funds.
○
○
The typical horizon-date fund looks at your planned retirement 
date. Let’s say you are 40 and plan to retire in 20 years. 
Because you still have a long time to retirement, your asset 
allocation in a horizon fund will consist mostly of equity index 
funds. As you gradually approach retirement age, the horizon 

48
Lecture 6 • John Bogle, Index Mutual Fund Pioneer
fund will increase your allocation to fixed-income index 
funds, because they tend to be steadier, and decrease your 
exposure to more variable equity investments.
○
○
If you have assets in a taxable account, it might be possible to 
get a slightly better outcome using tax-loss harvesting. Let’s say 
you have a diversified portfolio of investments, and one of your 
stocks is Goldman Sachs. Suppose Goldman Sachs’s stock is 
down 15% for the year to date. Tax-advantaged funds would 
look to sell Goldman Sachs when it was down, take the capital 
loss, and match it against capital gains in the same account or 
elsewhere. Estimates vary, but a rule of thumb is that the tax-
advantaged fund can add about 1% per year, on an after-tax 
basis, over a regular index fund held in a taxable account.
>
>
Index funds are best suited for people who don’t have a 
background in financial investments or who are too busy to devote 
time to picking individual securities or funds. The efficient market 
hypothesis is not set in stone. Examples of people and strategies 
that appear to outperform the market as a whole occur on a 
regular basis. But outperformance is hard to achieve and indexing 
is simple—and tough to beat.

Small-Cap Stocks:  
More Risk, More Reward
N
umerous academic studies have found that over long 
periods, small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap 
stocks by wide margins. That said, small stocks sometimes 
also experience huge volatility swings, especially in declining 
markets. A small-cap stock is generally held to be one valued at 
less than $1 billion. A stock with a market cap of less than $100 
million is called a micro-cap. A company with a market cap of 
less than $50 million is called a nano-cap.
Small-Cap Fundamentals
>
>
Studies find that small-cap stocks historically provide higher 
returns than large-cap stocks by an incremental 2 to 3 percentage 
points per year. Though it might not sound like much, these 
fractional gains can add up to very large differences over time. 
Small-cap stocks historically provide higher returns than large-cap 
stocks because, according to several measures, they are riskier.
>
>
The first measure is market risk, known as beta, which measures 
the risk of one investment against the market as a whole. Small-
cap stocks tend to be more volatile and usually have a higher level 
of beta than large-cap stocks. The small firms are generally less 

50
Lecture 7 • Small-Cap Stocks: More Risk, More Reward 
established, have shakier financials, and do not pay a dividend, 
and therefore exhibit higher market risks.
>
>
In addition, small-cap stocks have higher liquidity risk. A liquid 
asset is one that you can sell quickly and at fair market value. A 
liquidity risk entails the danger of trading into or out of an asset 
with a narrow investor base. 
>
>
Small-cap stocks also are under-followed by analysts and financial 
reporters. The lack of coverage means less information about 
these neglected stocks, which is a negative to investors who want 
some hand-holding. We can refer to this as information risk. Wall 
Street firms often have little incentive to follow small-cap stocks 
because bankers who employ research analysts typically get paid 
a percentage of the size of the deals they work on. 
>
>
These risks might be a negative from some perspectives, but they 
can also be positive. Higher risk investments generally result in 

51
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
higher realized returns, but capturing the extra risk premium often 
takes a long time, often more than a decade.
Passive Small-Cap Strategies
>
>
The easiest way to invest in small-cap stocks is through an index 
fund or an exchange-traded fund or ETF. The first small-cap index 
was created in 1984 by Frank Russell and Company and is known 
as the Russell 2000 Index. This index created an opportunity for 
investors to become active in the small-cap market without having 
to individually research and select small stocks.
>
>
It is the most widely followed small-cap index today. More than 
90% of small-cap investment managers use the Russell 2000 as 
benchmark. Standard and Poor, or S&P, also has a small-cap index 
of 600 names, but it hasn’t gained as much traction as Russell’s.
>
>
In the early 1990s, Eugene Fama and Ken French provided further 
insight into the large- versus small-cap performance discrepancy. 
They verified the finding that small-cap outperforms large-cap over 
long-periods. But they combined this finding with another, which is 
that value typically outperforms growth over long periods. 
>
>
Fama and French don’t view their findings as the Holy Grail of 
investing. Rather, they think small firms and value firms have 
higher risks, such as being more prone to bankruptcy, and that’s 
why they have higher returns. 
Warren Buffett Cameo
>
>
Warren Buffett is well-known for his investing prowess. But earlier 
in his career, Buffett managed much smaller amounts of capital, 
and had incredible success with small-cap stocks. He has often 
said that managing large sums of money results in a performance 
disadvantage. It forces him to hunt for large firms to have a 
meaningful impact on his portfolio’s overall performance. 

52
Lecture 7 • Small-Cap Stocks: More Risk, More Reward 
○
○
In one interview, Buffett said that if he were managing only a 
million dollars instead of tens of billions, he would guarantee 
returns of 50% a year because he would have no constraints 
on a target’s size and would not have to worry, when taking a 
position, about his investment’s impact on the price.
○
○
Buffett once was asked where individual investors should 
look for investments. Buffett replied that he thought small-cap 
stocks were great hunting grounds because large institutions 
can’t invest there, practically speaking. 
>
>
Buffett’s most famous small-cap investment was in Berkshire 
Hathaway. Today, Berkshire is one of the largest companies in the 
world, with a market cap in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but 
it started life as a textile maker. Buffett started buying Berkshire 
in 1962, at a price of $7.60 a share. Even then, Buffett could see 
that textile manufacturing was a declining business in the United 
States, but he saw value in the firm in the form of its working 
capital, real estate, plants, and equipment. 
>
>
Buffett paid $14.86 a share to gain control of Berkshire in 1965. 
At the time, Berkshire had net working capital of $19 a share plus 
valuable property. The genius of Buffett was to use its cash flow 
to help buy other companies—such as The Washington Post, 
See’s Candy, Coca-Cola, and GEICO insurance, a business that 
generated a lot of cash itself—either outright or in part through 
their stock. 
Peter Lynch Cameo
>
>
Another famous investor who did well with small-cap stocks is 
Peter Lynch. He turned Fidelity Investments’ Magellan Fund into 
the largest mutual fund in the world by the time he stepped down. 
A $1000 investment in Magellan when Lynch started there in 1977 
had turned into $28,000 by his retirement 13 years later.

53
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
>
>
A significant part of Lynch’s outperformance was due to his 
investment in small-cap firms. And even after Magellan became 
large—with an investment portfolio in the tens of billions of 
dollars—Lynch didn’t completely abandon small caps. 
>
>
Lynch coined the investment term tenbagger, which refers to a 
stock that increases 10 times or more from the original purchase 
price. Dunkin’ Donuts is one of Lynch’s most famous tenbaggers. 
The relevant point is that it is much easier for a small-cap stock to 
become a tenbagger than it is for a large one.
>
>
Lynch has shared his thoughts on the small-cap market in several 
of his books. He suggests that with small companies, you are 
better off to wait until they turn a profit before you invest. This point 
might seem obvious, but it’s important because small money-
losing firms sometimes go out of business. 
>
>
Lynch also suggests looking for niche companies. Many large 
companies today started out as niche players. Microsoft began as 
a firm that developed programs for the BASIC computer language. 
One of its first big breaks was creating the operating system MS-
DOS for the IBM personal computer. 
○
○
MS-DOS eventually came to dominate the operating system 
market. But Microsoft also expanded into the business-
software marketplace with MS-Office. The lesson from Lynch 
is that a small-cap company can eventually dominate its niche 
and expand to related fields.
○
○
One way to determine if a stock has been “discovered,” so 
to speak, is to look at the percentage of the stock owned by 
institutions. This statistic can easily be found at no cost on 
many financial websites. 
○
○
As a rule of thumb, if institutional ownership is less than 50%, 
the stock is not widely followed by larger investors such as 
mutual funds, hedge funds, and pension funds. A small-cap 

54
Lecture 7 • Small-Cap Stocks: More Risk, More Reward 
stock can quickly turn into a mid-cap stock when institutions 
get on board.
>
>
Lynch likes small companies that have proved that their concept 
can be replicated. Starbucks is a good example of what he means: 
○
○
Starbucks had a concept—a coffee shop that provides a 
unique experience. 
○
○
The concept began in Seattle, and was developed in one 
region, the Northwest, before being rolled out nationwide. 
○
○
If Peter Lynch saw a concept like this that could be replicated 
across the country—and the firm was profitable—he’d be 
inclined to invest in it.
>
>
Lynch thinks the opportunities abound to find small-cap investments. 
He says, “The average person is exposed to interesting local 
companies and products years before professionals.”
Michael Burry Cameo 
>
>
If you’ve read the book or seen the movie called The Big Short 
you probably recognize the name Michael Burry. He was one of 
the first to recognize the bubble that occurred in the U.S. housing 
market, and he made an enormous amount of money by betting 
that the housing market would collapse. He did so by using a 
complicated derivative instrument called a credit-default swap. 
>
>
Although Burry is most famous for that trade, a big part of his 
financial success can be traced to his investments in small-cap 
stocks.
>
>
Burry considers himself a value investor and a disciple of value-
investing pioneers Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. His 
investment in Hyde Athletic Industries back in 1997 is a good 
example of his approach to small caps. 

55
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
○
○
Hyde Athletic was a maker of athletic footwear. When Burry 
bought the stock it was selling at a deep discount and less 
than its net working capital—what Graham called a net-net. 
Furthermore, the company was growing rapidly. 
○
○
Burry bought the stock for around $5 a share, when its market 
cap was $31 million. But based on its net working capital 
alone, the company was worth at least $37 million. Hyde 
Athletic eventually changed its name to Saucony, its most 
popular brand, which today has a rabid following among 
runners. And Burry says he made a 50% return on this small-
cap investment.
Conclusion
>
>
Small-cap investing can offer excellent long-term investing 
possibilities. The easiest way to get exposure to small-caps is by 
investing in an index fund, which typically are well diversified and 
relatively inexpensive. You could also invest in one of the many 
actively managed small-cap mutual or exchange-traded funds. 
>
>
A common strategy is to invest in a basket of small, young firms 
in a rapidly growing industry and then, as the evidence becomes 
clearer, sell the laggards and put the sales proceeds into the 
winner—or winners. 
>
>
Buffett, Graham, and Burry focused on deep value. They reasoned 
that the deep value in neglected stocks would eventually be realized 
by the market. Or you could take the Peter Lynch approach, and 
focus on small companies that are profitable, have a niche, and can 
eventually replicate their product on a larger scale.

Many small and risky investments end up losing money, and going 
out of business. But those that turn out to be winners sometimes 
return multiples on the initial investment. In baseball a good hitter 
is one who can make a hit in 1 of 3 at-bats. In the same way with

John Templeton,  
Global Treasure Hunter
S
ir John Templeton, one of the pioneers of global investing, 
said, “If you search worldwide, you will find more bargains 
and better bargains than by studying only one nation.” And 
Templeton didn’t just speak these words, he lived them, traveling 
all over for most of his 95 years, in search of great opportunities. 
In his early twenties, Templeton was a Rhodes scholar. This 
opportunity gave him the chance to tour throughout much of 
Europe and planted some of the earliest seeds of his views on 
global investing.

John Templeton’s investment style did not fit neatly into a style 
box. He often talked about searching for bargains, which would 
indicate a value mindset. However, he called his original and most 
famous fund the Templeton Growth Fund, with an emphasis not on 
buying at a discount, as under-value investing, but rather investing 
in a company’s potential. 
>
>
Templeton was one of the early proponents of what is known today 
as socially responsible investing: That is investing in a way that 

58
Lecture 8 • John Templeton, Global Treasure Hunter 
is consistent with personal beliefs. Templeton avoided stocks that 
operated in the alcohol, tobacco, and gambling industries.
American Depository Receipt
>
>
A global fund refers to one that invests anywhere in the world. By 
comparison, an international fund is one that invests only outside 
your home country. 
>
>
In the United States, a particular type of security, called an 
American Depository Receipt or ADR, allows you to buy many 
foreign stocks easily. 
○
○
ADRs basically work like this. JP Morgan or Bank of New 
York—the two largest players in the space—buy Sony shares 
on the Nikkei stock exchange. They put the equivalent of a 
U.S. dollar wrapper around this block of Sony stock, such that 
it is priced in U.S. dollars, pays dividends in U.S. dollars, and 
is listed to trade on an American stock exchange. 
○
○
ADRs are negotiable certificates that represent an interest in 
the shares of a non-U.S. company, are deposited with a U.S. 
bank, and trade on the major U.S. stock exchanges. You trade 
it just as you trade IBM in your brokerage account. 
>
>
The Sony ADR tends to closely track the price of Sony stock in 
Japan, adjusted for currency differences. If any difference gets 
too wide, short-term traders, known as arbitrageurs, make the 
discrepancy go away. They buy the cheap security and sell or, 
more accurately, sell short its more expensive equivalent. 
○
○
Selling short is a way of making money if a security falls in 
price. The typical investor first buys and then sells. Selling 
short involves the same transaction but in the reverse order: 
The stock is sold first and purchased later—hopefully at 
a lower price. If you sold the stock short for $50, and then 
bought it back later for $40, you made a gross profit of $10.

The Rise of the Global Economy
>
>
U.S. stocks account for only about half of the value of global stock 
markets. Many products that we know and love are made by 
foreign companies. Nestle is a Swiss company. Novartis, another 
Swiss enterprise, is one of the largest pharmaceutical firms in 
the world. Toyota is a Japanese automaker. Daimler, the owner 
of Mercedes Benz, is a German company. All of these firms have 
ADRs that trade on American stock exchanges
>
>
By some estimates, China’s economy will be twice as big as that 
of the United States by 2050. That is, China will be as big as the 
United States and the European Union combined. Thus, investing 
only in the United States might seem a bit short-sighted. 
>
>
Wider selection is perhaps the most important benefit of international 
investing. But the increased diversification that results from 
international investing can also produce the extremely important 
benefit of lowering the overall risk of your portfolio because local 
economies around the world don’t move in complete sync. 
>
>
Of course, international investing has its share of risks, too. 
Perhaps the most obvious is currency risk. Most of Alibaba’s 
profits are from China. If China’s currency plunges versus the 

60
Lecture 8 • John Templeton, Global Treasure Hunter 
dollar, its profits will be lower for U.S.-based investors, potentially 
hurting the price of Alibaba on U.S. stock exchanges. The reverse 
could also be true. 
>
>
Some countries place capital controls on foreign investment, 
restricting the ability to move money into or out of the country. A 
worst-case scenario is a country expropriating or nationalizing 
foreign assets, but most countries are fairly stable and tend 
to respect foreign property rights, and the potential benefits of 
international investment outweigh the risks. 
>
>
Even so, most people suffer from what behavioral economists 
call the home country bias. Investors typically put roughly 90% 
of their investible assets in their home country. Some financial 
planners suggest placing a significant percentage of investible  
assets abroad. 
Templeton Background 
>
>
John Templeton was born in Winchester, Tennessee, in 1912. 
Following in his brother’s footsteps, he entered Yale in 1930, 
during The Great Depression. Shortly after, Templeton’s father 
told him he could no longer help to pay for his education, forcing 
the young man to work to supplement the two scholarships that 
defrayed his tuition. Templeton graduated near the top of his class 
and went on to win a Rhodes scholarship to study at Oxford
>
>
In 1936, he and a friend spent 7 months traveling to 24 different 
countries. Templeton knew he wanted to go into the investment 
business, and his education and travel provided him with a wealth 
of experiences that would ultimately be useful to him.
>
>
Although in later years he would avoid taking on debt, in 1939 he 
borrowed money to buy 100 shares in each of 104 companies that 
were selling at $1 a share or less (including 34 companies that 
were in bankruptcy). Only 4 turned out to be worthless, and he 
turned large profits on the others when U.S. industry rebounded 

61
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
as a result of World War II. His roughly $10,000 initial investment 
turned into about $40,000 4 years later.
>
>
In 1940 he purchased an investment firm that would become 
known as Templeton, Dobbrow & Vance and called himself 
an investment counselor. Templeton quickly realized that the 
economics of running a mutual fund were better than running an 
investment advisory firm; in 1954, he set up the Templeton Growth 
Fund and, in 1962, sold his stake in the traditional investment 
counseling business.
>
>
The mutual fund industry grew rapidly during the 1950s, and the 
Templeton Growth Fund expanded into an entire family of funds. 
With so many funds, usually at least one would be performing well. 
Templeton relocated to the Bahamas in the early 1960s, renouncing 
his American citizenship, and felt that the solitude of living there 
provided him with a competitive edge when picking stocks. 
Templeton’s Investing Philosophy
>
>
Templeton felt that the best performance is produced by a person, 
not a committee. Committees have a tendency to focus their views 
similar to a consensus, which Templeton believed would not result 
in market beating performance. At worst, it can result in groupthink, 
wherein a number of professionals working together and trying to 
minimize conflict make an irrational or dysfunctional, decision. 
>
>
As an investment advisor, Templeton followed what’s called the 
Yale method of asset allocation, a strategy of mean reversion 
or rebalancing by trimming winning asset classes and adding to 
underperforming asset classes. The Yale method that Templeton 
used is different from what is known today as the Yale Model 
employed by Yale University’s endowment. 
>
>
Templeton once said, “For all long-term investors, there is only 
one objective. Maximize total return after taxes.” This is an 
important point: Taxes are often the largest transaction cost for 

62
Lecture 8 • John Templeton, Global Treasure Hunter 
most investors. One way Templeton tried to reduce taxes was 
by holding his investments for the long term—about 4 years, 
representing investor turnover of about 25% a year—compared to 
an average holding period of about one year—100% turnover—for 
most actively managed stock funds today.
>
>
Templeton generally avoided stocks yielding the highest dividends 
because those companies often had problems, putting the 
dividend at risk of being cut. He preferred dividend growth over 
the absolute level of the dividend itself, and he thought stocks that 
paid no dividends had more upside potential. This view differs 
from that of Graham and other traditional value investors.
Templeton Preferences for Foreign Investment
>
>
Templeton preferred to invest in countries that exhibit the following 
characteristics:
○
○
Less government ownership. State-owned enterprises might 
have an advantage against stockholder-owned firms if the 
government makes the rules.
○
○
Less government regulation. He believed strongly in the 
efficiency of the free market system.
○
○
Less quarrelsome unions. Unions might be less efficient than 
the free market.
○
○
Lower taxes. They encourage investment, which should 
ultimately lead to growth.
○
○
Firms with higher research and development budgets. 
○
○
The ethic of the people is to be honest and reliable. Investing 
in a stock is the equivalent of trusting the firm with your 
money. Corruption results in inefficient markets.

63
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
○
○
The people are farsighted rather than short-sighted. 
Farsighted people often have better long-term results.
○
○
Citizens exhibit higher rate of savings. Savings often find their 
way into the stock market.
Conclusion
>
>
John Templeton changed the world of investing forever. He was the 
person likely most responsible for persuading many of us to invest 
on a global basis. He was also one of the earliest practitioners 
of socially responsible investing. He had an investment record of 
outperformance for more than 50 years. In this respect, perhaps 
only Warren Buffett can compare.
>
>
Templeton demonstrated that investors with a long-term focus 
don’t have to listen to the day-to-day noise that emanates from 
Wall Street. He was the epitome of a flexible investor, making 
money with value stocks, growth stocks, domestic stocks, and 
international stocks. He had the temperament to remain optimistic 
when it looked to others that the sky was falling.

David Dreman,  
Contrarian Money Manager
S
tudies by Dreman and others have found that professional 
research analysts frequently fall prey to what is now 
known as optimism bias. They tend to be too optimistic about a 
company’s prospects while failing to take into account what can 
go wrong, such as failure to execute or increasing competition. 
Dreman also came to believe that political and financial crises 
caused investors to sell stocks too hastily—what he considers 
is precisely the wrong reaction. Dreman advises buying during a 
panic, and not selling.
The Making of a Contrarian
>
>
David Dreman’s father, a commodities trader who operated a small 
brokerage firm, often told David that brokerage firms published 
flawed and incorrect research, possibly planting the seed for 
Dreman to become a wealthy and well-regarded contrarian—an 
investor who goes against the crowd. 
>
>
As a contrarian, Dreman bought tobacco stocks after the out-of-
favor industry agreed to pay the U.S. government $206 billion 
across 25 years. The agreement settled a series of lawsuits from 
the damage that tobacco products cause consumers and related 

65
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
health care costs incurred by the government. Dreman believed 
that people wouldn’t stop smoking, and the industry’s legal liability 
was now fixed at a finite (and affordable) cost. 
Investor Psychology
>
>
Security prices rarely move in a straight line. Instead, they may 
swing wildly because of the instability of market events and human 
emotions. In part, that’s because fear and greed are inextricable 
expressions of human nature, and human emotions are closely 
tied to what is known as bull and bear market behavior. 
○
○
Bulls fight with their horns—moving upward—signifying the 
market rising, usually at least 20% from a bottom. Bears fight 
with their claws—moving downward—representing the market 
falling, usually at least 20% from a peak. A market correction 
occurs when stock prices retreat about 10%.
>
>
Over a recent 20-year period, the average investor returned 2.5% 
a year, compared with 6% annual returns for bonds and 10% gains 
for stocks, according to a report J. P. Morgan and the research firm 
DALBAR. Two decades’ worth of data demonstrate that the average 
investor is beaten by the market every single year. The reason, 
stated plainly, is that the typical investor chases performance. 
>
>
If you look at individual stocks, you will periodically find examples 
of extreme price movements that can be explained principally by 
crowd psychology—sometimes leading to bubbles and busts—
and not necessarily from any rational movements in the securities’ 
intrinsic value.
Behavioral Finance

What if there were a way to profit from the mistakes of others? 
In the emerging field of behavioral finance—the name that 
economists give to market psychology—learning how to profit 

66
Lecture 9 • David Dreman, Contrarian Money Manager 
from the fallibilities of others is a primary objective. Another is to be 
more aware of one’s own failings and to limit them going forward. 
>
>
Few investors have done more to advance the field of behavioral 
finance than David Dreman, who has written 5 books on the 
topic and is the money manager at his own firm, Dreman Value 
Management. Dreman is also a cofounder of the respected Journal 
of Behavioral Finance, and for decades he’s written an investment 
column for Forbes magazine—appropriately titled “The Contrarian.”

The list of mistakes that investors seem to make regularly is long. 
One of the most common biases is the disposition effect. It means 
that typical investors hold onto losing investments long after they 
should: They want to at least break even, and they may feel that a 
paper loss is not the same as a realized loss. 
○
○
The flipside is that many investors sell their winning investments 
too soon. Imagine owning a young Microsoft and selling after 
a 50% gain. You would have missed out on a 10-fold gain or 
more. Microsoft had its initial public offering on March 13, 1986, 
at a price of $21 a share. The stock has split something like 9 
times and gone up more than 68,000% since.
○
○
One way to limit the impact of the disposition effect is to 
review certain fundamental measures of performance that 
may explain why a stock goes up or down—or be about to. 
If the fundamentals have changed for the worse, maybe you 
should consider selling. 
>
>
Investors tend to overreact to information. They often place 
more weight on what has happened recently and less on what 
happened in the more distant past. Mathematically, they weight 
things in a nonlinear manner. This behavior helps explain why 
many successful investors are contrarian in their outlook and 
strategy. They are willing to go against the grain and buy out-of-
favor investments if they see fundamental value underneath the 
bad news. 
>
>
Investors also tend to suffer from optimism bias. They believe they 
are better investors than they actually are. For example, investors 
tend to underestimate the role of competition on their investments. 
They also tend to trade too much—acting on information that is 
already widely known and unlikely to add much value. 
>
>
Another typical mistake is representativeness bias. Investors may 
confuse a good company with a good investment. It’s easy to say 
what a good company is. It’s one that consistently increases sales 

68
Lecture 9 • David Dreman, Contrarian Money Manager 
and profits. Saying it is a good investment is another story. A good 
investment goes up more than the market on a risk-adjusted basis. 
>
>
Most people are stubborn in their investment approaches. Once 
they’ve made up their minds about an investment, they tend to 
agree with information that supports their views and ignore 
information that conflicts with them. Economists call this behavior 
confirmation bias.
>
>
Studies find that the average investor feels that losing $1 hurts 
twice as much as gaining $1 helps them. Economists call this 
weighting the value of gains and losses function. The implication 
is that investors really hate losses and should hold well-diversified 
portfolios to reduce risk. It also suggests why, as humans, we 
have a proclivity to lean toward “star” stocks that are expensive 
by almost any valuation metric. Investors tend to fear value stocks 
because they have problems. They extrapolate into the future that 
the current good or bad news will continue. 
Dreman Strategy 
>
>
Some famous investors used price-trend analysis to time 
individual investments and the market. In contrast, David Dreman 
focuses on company fundamentals, such as valuation levels and 
industry standing, as well as on how other investors perceive the 
company’s stock. 
>
>
Nowadays a ton of information is available to consider: financial 
statements, analysts’ reports, press articles, bulletin board fodder, 
and so forth. We’ve all heard of the term information overload. 
Dreman says investors should respect the difficulty of working 
with a mass of undigested information because few can use it  
all successfully. 
>
>
Rather, he prefers the expression “in-depth profits”—knowing 
about a smaller number of companies in great detail: their product 
lineup, their ability to fend off competition, and their management 

69
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
team’s skill. When you are faced with too much information on a 
single company, focus most of your attention on the factors that 
drive sales, earnings, and profit margins. 
>
>
With regard to overcoming the tendency to harbor investment 
biases—most specifically, the optimism bias—and to make 
recurring investment mistakes, Dreman recommends making 
downward adjustments to analysts’ earnings forecasts for a 
company. That is, if the analysts’ consensus estimate for Coca-
Cola’s earnings is $2 a share, would you still want to buy the stock 
if it earned only $1.50? 
>
>
Because he is a contrarian, Dreman thinks that stocks everyone 
loves are more likely to run into problems: new competition, poor 
execution, or complacency. Conversely, if everyone hates a stock, 
maybe the firm can fix its problems. If it’s a bad business, maybe 
some of its competitors will be leaving, gradually turning the 
economics from unfavorable to favorable for the survivors. Still, 
Dreman cautions that market reappraisals of favored and out-of-
favor stocks tend to occur at a glacial pace. Thus, for a contrarian, 
an important personal characteristic is patience. 
>
>
As for the qualities that Dreman looks for in companies to invest 
in, he likes to buy solid or quality companies with high dividends 
and low price-to-earnings ratios, price-to-cash flow, and/or price-
to-book value—at least 30% less than the market as a whole. 
>
>
No uniform definition exists to describe a quality company, but 
it usually has several characteristics: It’s likely to have been in 
business for a while, to be profitable, to pay a dividend at least 
0.5% higher than the average for the market as a whole and with a 
history of rising payouts, and to have strong management.
>
>
Dreman prefers to hold a more concentrated portfolio than the 
typical mutual fund or index fund. He advises investing equally in 
20 to 30 stocks, diversified among 15 or more industries. In his 

70
Lecture 9 • David Dreman, Contrarian Money Manager 
opinion, this strategy balances diversification with his ability to 
follow the companies in detail.
>
>
While taking losses sometimes is unavoidable, you should also 
know when to take your winnings. The best poker players don’t 
stay at the table until their luck runs out. Dreman offers some 
advice on when to sell. 
○
○
He recommends selling a stock when its P/E ratio (or other 
contrarian indicator) approaches that of the overall market, 
regardless of how favorable its prospects may appear, 
replacing it with another contrarian stock. Dreman’s approach 
is always to be a disciplined value investor.
>
>
One of the largest firms that tries to systematically capitalize on 
investor mistakes is LSV Asset Management, based in Chicago, 
with more than $80 billion in assets under management. The 
principals state that the fundamental premise on which LSV’s 
investment philosophy is based “is that superior long-term results 
can be achieved by systematically exploiting the judgmental 
biases and behavioral weaknesses that influence the decisions of 
many investors…”
>
>
Another investment firm to rely on behavioral finance as a core 
component of its investment strategy is Fuller and Thaler in 
California’s Silicon Valley with about $5 billion under management. 
The firm is mid-sized but maintains important investment 
advisory relationships with much larger partners. Its founders 
are so committed to the ideas of behavioral finance that they’ve 
registered the trademark: The Behavioral Edge.
>
>
People have known about the impact of market psychology 
on security prices for a long time. For example, the economist 
John Maynard Keynes once described the markets as being 
moved by animal spirits and not by reason. But over the past few 
decades, the field of behavioral finance has made great strides in 

71
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
documenting the mistakes of investors. But not all investors make 
the same mistakes.
>
>
David Dreman recognized that being a contrarian was the best way 
for him to make money. But not everyone has the temperament 
to be a contrarian. One of the worst feelings is to be wrong and 
alone. If you’re wrong picking a stock that everyone loves, you are 
unlikely to get fired—even if that stock comes crashing down.

Peter Lynch:  
Invest in What You Know
P
eter Lynch managed Fidelity Investments’ Magellan Fund 
from 1977 to 1990. During his 13-year tenure, a $10,000 
stake in the fund would have grown to $280,000. Over the same 
period, the S&Ps 500 stock index roughly tripled, increasing 
214%. Under Lynch, the Magellan fund never lost money over a 
calendar year, and it beat the S&P 500 11 out of 13 years. During 
that time, the size of the portfolio he managed grew from $18 
million to $14 billion. Lynch was once the most successful mutual 
fund manager in the world, and then he retired at his peak.
The Investment Universe
>
>
A mutual fund is an investment managed for the mutual benefit of 
its shareholders. A mutual fund such as Magellan offers the same 
portfolio of investments for all its shareholders. Large investors, or 
institutions, usually belong to a class of shares paying lower fees 
than small investors do. These fees may include management 
fees, marketing fees, and administration fees. 
>

The expense ratio is the “all in” number that expresses the fees 
you pay as a percentage of your overall investment.

Research analysts often break the investment universe into 
different categories they call style boxes. The main distinctions are 
between growth, value, large cap, and small cap. 
○
○
Growth firms trade at above-average valuations relative to 
the market as a whole. For example, their price to earnings 
or price to book ratios may be higher than the S&P 500’s. By 
comparison, value firms trade at below-average multiples.
○
○
Growth investors are often trying to find rapidly growing 
smaller firms that have the potential to become large firms 
like the next Amazon. In contrast, value investors search 
for stocks trading at a low price relative to the company’s 
earnings or cash flow or paying an above-average dividend. 
○
○
Value stocks are companies that typically are growing sales 
and earnings more slowly than growth firms. They also might 

74
Lecture 10 • Peter Lynch: Invest in What You Know 
be going through some problems, explaining why they may be 
trading at below-average valuations.
○
○
Small-cap companies are valued at less than $1 billion. 
By comparison, large cap firms are those with a market 
capitalization—or 
market 
price 
times 
total 
shares 
outstanding—of $1 billion or more.
Lynch’s Background 
>
>
Lynch worked as a caddy to help support his family after his 
father’s death. He found that it paid better than delivering 
newspapers, and being a caddy provided him with his first real 
exposure to the stock market: Businessmen, doctors, and lawyers 
naturally discussed the stock market while they were out on the 
golf course. 
>
>
He joined Fidelity Investments in 1965 and became a full-time 
analyst in 1969, covering the metals and chemicals industries. In 
between, Lynch got his M.B.A. at the University of Pennsylvania’s 
Wharton School and served in the Army for 2 years before 
launching his storied career at Fidelity. Lynch eventually headed 
Fidelity’s research department before getting the chance to run 
Magellan.
Research Is Knowledge
>
>
Lynch gets upset when people say his strategy was to “invest in 
what you know,” as if that’s all there is to it. Research is essential. 
Lynch would follow up on his own common sense and instincts with 
rigorous fundamental analysis. That meant looking at a company’s 
financials, talking to management, and talking to competitors in 
the industry.

Listen to the quarterly earnings conference calls that firms 
host for analysts and investors.

Lynch rarely invested in a firm with a lot of debt. One of his 
maxims was, “Companies that have no debt cannot go bankrupt.” 
Of course, bankruptcy is the worst-case investment scenario for 
the buyer of a stock, since the stock price almost always goes to 
zero. A few ways of assessing the bankruptcy risk of a firm include 
the following: 
○
○
Look at a company’s credit rating. Standard and Poor, 
Moody’s, Fitch, and other credit-rating services evaluate the 
debt of most public companies. A bond rated below BBB– is 
considered high-yield or junk. If you are a stock investor, you’ll 
want to have a high level of conviction before investing in a 
company with a junk credit rating.
○
○
Look at a number of ratios that measure creditworthiness: the 
debt to equity, debt to assets, and debt to income ratios. You 
can find most of these ratios at popular financial websites.
>
>
Although Lynch didn’t like firms with a lot of debt, there were some 
exceptions. One of his biggest winners was buying Chrysler stock 
in 1982, as the automotive company teetered on the edge of 

76
Lecture 10 • Peter Lynch: Invest in What You Know 
bankruptcy. The stock was trading at $2 a share and it was losing 
money, but Lynch liked the product line. 
○
○
Chrysler invented the minivan, a huge hit. He was a fan of its 
CEO, Lee Iacocca, and he thought the rumors of Chrysler’s 
bankruptcy were greatly exaggerated, especially since the 
company had just sold its military tank division to General 
Dynamics, for $1 billion in cash. 
○
○
The U.S. economy was just then emerging from a deep 
recession so he thought the auto industry was headed for 
a cyclical upturn. Lynch turned out to be right, as the stock 
eventually went up more than 10-fold. That’s what Lynch calls 
a tenbagger. 
>
>
Lynch made money across the investment universe. When 
Magellan was small, he could count on small-cap stocks to help 
deliver outsized performance. Small-cap companies are valued 
at less than $1 billion. By comparison, large cap firms are those 
with a market capitalization—or market price times total shares 
outstanding—of $1 billion or more. 
>
>
Small stocks historically deliver higher returns than large stocks 
because they are riskier, but also because they are followed less 
intensively by Wall Street. You are more likely to uncover information 
on small cap firms that is not yet widely known by the market.

Yet Lynch’s superior performance continued even when Magellan 
ballooned in size, and he tilted towards larger firms: companies 
like IBM, Ford, Merck, and General Electric. Starting in the mid-
1980s, Lynch also invested about 10% to 20% of Magellan’s 
assets in international stocks, names like Unilever, Volvo, and 
Royal Dutch Shell.

Part of Peter Lynch’s mantra of investing in what you know is that 
you probably have some unique insights into the industry that 
you work in, or worked in. He says, “Your investor’s edge is not 

77
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
something you can get from Wall Street experts. It is something you 
already have. You can outperform the experts if you use your edge 
by investing in companies or industries you already understand.”
Buying in Bulk
>
>
Lynch had a portfolio liked to buy baskets of companies in an 
entire industry. His logic was that when you are looking at small 
firms or a new industry, you might not know which will emerge as 
winners. Therefore, if you are right on the industry at large—and 
buy a basket of its stocks—then the winners will go up in multiples; 
if you avoid borrowing, you won’t lose more than 100% of your 
investment in the failures.
>
>
Peter Lynch retired before the Internet boom, but as an example of 
investing in baskets of stocks, think about all the search engines 
that once existed: Alta Vista, Lycos, Infoseek, Yahoo!, and others. 
The eventual winner turned out to be Google, which came to be 
valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars. But if you’d bought a 
basket of all the leading candidates at the time, you would have 
wound up ahead even if all the other search engines went to zero.
>

Lynch generally avoided hot stocks in hot industries, preferring 
companies that appeared to be dull, mundane, or out of favor, 
or which hadn’t caught the fancy of Wall Street. He thought they 
shared several characteristics: 
○
○
They tended to be low-cost operators with penny-pinching 
managers in the executive suite. 
○
○
They avoided going into debt. 
○
○
They rejected the corporate caste system and didn’t pit white-
collar workers against blue-collar workers. 
○
○
Their workers tended to be well paid, with stakes in the 
companies’ future.

These kinds of companies seemed to find niches and grow faster 
than average.

>
Although not everyone has the resources that Peter Lynch had at 
Fidelity, he suggested a number of tips that the rest of us can use. 
○
○
He looked for companies that consistently bought back their 
own shares. If a company buys back its own shares, it tells 
the market that it thinks its stock is undervalued. 
○
○
A company buyback also tends to keep away short sellers 
who are betting the stock price will fall. Many companies 
also buy back stock to offset the shares given to employees  
as compensation. 
>
>
Look for companies that started out with little or no institutional 
ownership. If the amount of institutional ownership is less than 
50% of the total number of shares outstanding, the institutions 
haven’t piled in yet. Once the institutions pile in, the stock price 
can take off. 
>
>
Lynch viewed insider buying by management as a positive sign. 
Corporate insiders should know more about the firm than almost 
anyone else. Most corporate directors get the bulk of their 
compensation from their company’s stock. For them to buy on top 
of that sends a very strong signal. 
>
>
On the other hand, insiders sell for various reasons: to pay taxes 
or diversify their portfolios, for example. But if corporate insiders 
sell a large portion of their holdings, it may be cause for concern.
>
>
If you are getting nervous about a rising stock price, hold at least 
a portion of the stock if the business is still solid, even if you think 
it might be overvalued. Lynch believed in investing in companies, 
not in the stock market. He tried to ignore short-term fluctuations, 
viewing market declines as an opportunity to buy stock in 

79
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
companies he liked. In the long term, there is a 100% correlation 
between the success of a company and the success of its stock. 
>
>
Even so, you can’t simply invest in what you know. Successful 
investing requires research. Before buying a stock, look at a 
company’s financials, its competitive position in the industry, and 
its management. One of his rules is, “Never invest in anything that 
you can’t illustrate with a crayon.”

The Bond Kings: Bill Gross, 
Jeffrey Gundlach
T
he global bond market is more than twice as large as the 
stock market. It also plays a more central role in the lives of 
most people. The mortgage on your home, your student loan, 
your car loan are all tied to the bond market. Federal, state, and 
local governments finance themselves through the bond market. 
The assets in Social Security are tied to it, and the global 
economy almost melted down in 2008 because of the bond 
market—not the stock market.
Gross and Gundlach
>
>
Bill Gross was crowned a “bond king” because of his storied 
career with the Pacific Investment Management Company, better 
known as PIMCO. That is, until their well-publicized breakup. 
Gross managed the firm’s huge Total Return bond fund, which 
peaked with almost $300 billion in assets under management. In 
the more than 25 years that Gross ran the fund, it outperformed 
its benchmark by about 2% a year. That’s a big deal in the bond 
world—especially with a fund so large.
>
>
Jeff Gundlach earned his stripes as the top bond manager at Trust 
Company of the West, or TCW. Like Gross, Gundlach ultimately 

81
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
had a contentious departure. Under Gundlach, TCW’s Total Return 
Bond Fund finished in the top 2% of all funds in its class for the 10 
years before he left. Less than 7 years after starting over at his own 
firm, he had more than $100 billion in assets under management.
>
>
Bill Gross and Jeff Gundlach share a focus on 3- to 5-year 
investment horizons and top-down analyses that take the big 
picture of the economy into account. Bill Gross is adept at 
investing worldwide, while Jeff Gundlach has a special expertise 
in U.S. mortgage bonds and in relative-value analysis. 
Bonds and Risks
>
>
A bond is like an IOU backed by legal rights. The issuing party, 
typically a company or government entity, usually offers to pay 
interest, known as the coupon payment, in order to borrow money 
from investors. Eventually, it returns the money borrowed—known 
as the face, par, or principal value—along with interest. And since 
the amount and timing of the cash flows on bonds are usually 
known, they are called fixed-income securities. When investing in 
bonds, you should be aware of several important risks. 
>
>
Interest-rate risk. When interest rates go up, traditional bonds fall 
in value because the bond is viewed as riskier and is valued less. 
When interest rates fall, traditional bonds usually rise in value 
because the risk is perceived to be lower. 
>
>
Reinvestment rate risk. When rates rise, the coupons and 
maturing face value or bond principal can be reinvested at higher 
rates in newer securities, drawing investor interest away from the 
older instrument. 
>
>
Default risk. If a bond defaults, it may be forced into bankruptcy, 
and the bondholders may seize the assets of the issuer—often 
after a long and protracted bankruptcy court battle. 

82
Lecture 11 • The Bond Kings: Bill Gross, Jeffrey Gundlach
>
>
Liquidity risk. A liquid asset is one that can be sold quickly, and at 
fair market value. A U.S. Treasury Bill is very liquid. Your house is 
not. During times of market distress, such as the Great Recession 
in 2008, illiquid assets often take a big hit. In the bond market, 
they tend to be bonds that have less trading volume; bonds with 
low credit ratings; emerging markets bonds; and bonds with wide 
bid-ask spreads—the difference in price between when you buy 
and when you sell. 
Bill Gross 
>
>
Bill Gross was born April 13, 1944, in Middletown, Ohio. He 
wanted to go to college on the East Coast, and Duke offered 
him an academic scholarship. Gross majored in psychology and 
always had a knack for numbers. While in school, he was in a car 
accident. During his recovery, he read a famous gambling book 
titled Beat the Dealer. 
>
>
After graduation, he enlisted in the Navy, but first he went to Las 
Vegas for 4 months, where he made a living as a gambler, using the 
gaming strategy he’d read about. Gross would use many concepts 
from gambling, such as developing strategies for making decisions 
with incomplete information, in his future investment activities.
>
>
After the Navy, Gross went on for his M.B.A. Although he wanted 
to be a stock trader, he joined the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance 
Company as a credit analyst. A short time later, Pacific Mutual 
created a new firm to focus on mutual funds: Pacific Investment 
Management Company, or PIMCO. Gross joined the new unit and 
eventually took it over with a couple of business partners.
Gross’s Investment Strategy 
>
>
Gross believes that successful investment over the long run, 
whether in bonds or in equities, depends on developing a long-
term outlook and acquiring the right mix of securities within an 
asset class. In addition, he believes that 3- to 5-year forecast 

83
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
horizons force an investor to avoid the near-term fluctuations that 
lead to panic and bad investment decisions. This focus makes him 
a top-down investor. 
>
>
The expected return on a bond over its term should be pretty close 
to its yield to maturity—that is, the return from the coupon payment 
and the capital gain or loss on the instrument, together known as 
the bond’s total return. Gross focuses on yield-to-call estimates, 
as opposed to yield-to-maturity calculations, when estimating the 
most probable total return on a bond held until maturity. 
>
>
In the search for yield, Gross also suggests exploring international 
bonds, particularly in emerging nations. They may also provide 
additional diversification. But a word of caution: International 
bonds also have currency risk. If an American investor invests in a 
foreign bond the foreign currency falls versus the dollar over your 
investment horizon, you may lose money, on a total return basis, 
when you try to convert your investment back to U.S. dollars.
>
>
In short, Gross’s impressive record in the bond markets has not 
been achieved with a single strategy but rather by being flexible, 
global, and long-term oriented.
>
>
In 2000, the German insurance giant, Allianz AG paid $3.5 billion 
to acquire 70% of PIMCO, which had grown to be the largest bond 
shop in the world. But Gross butted heads with the other members 
of PIMCO’s management team. Compounding the infighting was 
the lagging performance of Gross’s main investment vehicle, the 
PIMCO Total Return Fund. 
Jeff Gundlach

>
Jeffrey Gundlach was born October 30, 1959, and grew up in a 
middle-class family near Buffalo. He was a strong student with 
near-perfect SAT scores, and he was admitted to Dartmouth 
College, where he majored in math and philosophy. Later, he 
entered Yale’s Ph.D. program in applied math. 

84
Lecture 11 • The Bond Kings: Bill Gross, Jeffrey Gundlach
>
>
Two years later, Gundlach disagreed with his advisor on the topic 
of his Ph.D. dissertation, dropped out of Yale, and headed to Los 
Angeles to be a drummer in a rock band. After a couple of years, 
he found himself broke and looking for a job when he saw a TV 
show that counted down the top paying jobs in the world and listed 
investment banker as number 1. Gundlach decided that he would 
be an investment banker.
>
>
Gundlach didn’t know the difference between an investment 
banker—who focuses on mergers and acquisitions and IPOs—and 
investment managers, who manage money on behalf of clients. 
But TCW hired him, thinking that his math background would 
provide a good foundation for him in the bond market. Gundlach 
was a quick study and thrived at TCW. He spent 24 years at the 
firm before being fired in 2009. 
>
>
His dispute was with TCW’s management and the French parent 
company, Société Generale. Among other things, the firm accused 
Gundlach of attempting to steal confidential client and trading 
information that he could use to launch his own firm. 
>
>
Gundlach went on to found Doubleline Capital with about 45 
former TCW colleagues who’d helped him run his funds at TCW. 
But, before his departure, Gundlach amassed one of the best 
bond records in the industry. Morningstar nominated him as Fixed 
Income Manager of the Decade. He lost out to Bill Gross.
Gundlach Investing Strategy

>
Gundlach believes that if you buy bonds during periods of 
illiquidity and drops in price, you are likely to profit after the fear 
subsides and normalized market-levels return. Gundlach has 
made money investing in all sorts of bonds and other financial 
instruments. But he is perhaps best known for his investments in  
mortgage-backed securities. 

85
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders

>
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored entities 
backed by the credit rating of the U.S. government and designed to 
facilitate the functioning of the mortgage market. In 1981, Fannie 
Mae issued the first mortgage-backed security. Think of it as a 
bond in which the cash flows are a group of individual mortgage 
payments rolled into a single security. 
>
>
Usually they trade at close to AAA or AAA- ratings while providing 
a slightly higher yield than U.S. Treasury securities. Gundlach 
specializes in buying securities that appear to give a higher return 
than their credit risk might indicate. 
>
>
Like Gross, Gundlach usually starts with a top-down view and 
sets a macroeconomic horizon of about 3 years when he enters 
a position. He is occasionally willing to make shorter term trades 

86
Lecture 11 • The Bond Kings: Bill Gross, Jeffrey Gundlach
with horizons of less than a year, and he gives careful thought to 
how he enters and exits positions. When Gundlach says that his 
firm is a liquidity provider, he means is that he’s a reliable buyer of 
certain bond instruments when the sellers have to sell. 
>
>
When conducting his top-down analysis, Gundlach looks at a 
few variables. One is the yield curve—a graph of the relationship 
between time to maturity and yield to maturity. The yield curve 
typically slopes upward, with long-term interest rates higher than 
short-term rates.
>
>
Gundlach also looks at what is happening in the economy. Gross 
domestic product growth might be a useful measure of how the 
economy is doing as a whole. But he also looks at the credit 
cycle, which refers to bank lending and customer-default rates. 
Historically, as the economy approaches recession, credit gets 
tight and defaults go up.
>
>
This top-down analysis—taking into account the general state of the 
economy, liquidity in the debt market, and borrower health—gives 
Gundlach a sense of the credit and interest rate risk in his portfolio. 
>
>
Then Gundlach and his team turn to a bottom-up analysis for 
bonds, which might include looking at loan-level details and 
specific geographic areas. They check relative value among 
different credit sectors in fixed-income, at horizons of about 3 
years and do a rich/cheap analysis on the various bond sectors, 
including emerging and foreign markets. 
>
>
Gundlach has one of the best batting averages in the investment 
world. He claims to be right about 70% of the time, which—if 
true—is phenomenal in a business where being right just over half 
of the time would make you an all-star.

Sovereign Wealth Funds: 
Singapore
W
hy should we care about sovereign wealth funds? The 
answer is because they control more financial assets than 
hedge funds and private equity funds combined, amounting 
to more than $7 trillion. Many governments view these funds 
strategically to help support their own political and economic 
agendas. As sovereign wealth funds grow in size and importance, 
they have come to play larger roles both in their own countries’ 
affairs and in market battles between traditional, independent 
companies and state-owned and -controlled companies. 
Sovereign Wealth Funds

On February 27, 1981, the deputy prime minister of Singapore—
Dr. Goh Keng Swee—announced a plan to establish a 
government-owned investment corporation for the benefit of the 
population of the island city-state. Its source of funds would be 
foreign-exchange reserves—reserves beyond what the central 
bank needed to manage the country’s exchange rate. Its objective: 
capital appreciation.

Today, dozens of countries, most of them commodity rich, are

unleashing new and sometimes conflicting forces in world markets.

Sovereign wealth funds have become increasingly popular and 
powerful on the one hand, and potentially controversial on the 
other. However, it’s important to underscore the fundamental 
tension between the public good that such funds were intended 
for and potential pitfalls, such as state interests over private needs 
and the designs of managed markets over free ones. 
>
>
The U.S. Treasury Department defines a sovereign wealth fund 
as “A Government Investment Vehicle which is funded by foreign 
exchange assets and which manages those assets separately 
from the official reserves of the monetary authorities, (the Central 
Bank and reserve-related functions of the Finance Ministry).” 
>
>
The distinction is intended to clarify the difference between official 
reserves managed by a country’s central bank, with short-term 
horizons, focused on liquidity and security, and the longer horizons 
associated with, for example, national pension systems.
>
>
Three main drivers behind the creation and growth of sovereign 
wealth funds are balance of trade, economic stability, and the 
desire of sovereign nations to diversify their assets.
>
>
The International Monetary Fund further classifies sovereign 
wealth funds in 5 categories, according to their form and function:
○
○
Stabilization funds are formed to insulate a state budget and 
economy from commodity price volatility and external shocks. 
These investments sometimes are designed to move in the 
direction opposite the commodity prices against which a 
government wishes to insulate its economy.
○
○
Savings funds are designed to transform nonrenewable assets 
into financial assets that can be shared across generations. 
Examples include the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. 

90
Lecture 12 • Sovereign Wealth Funds: Singapore
These portfolios are invested primarily in equities and other  
growth investments.
○
○
Development funds allocate state resources to high-priority 
socioeconomic projects such as infrastructure. 
○
○
Pension reserve funds, as in Australia, Ireland, and New 
Zealand, invest in equities and other investments to offset 
rising retirement liabilities.
○
○
Reserve Investment Corporations are more complex funds 
designed to earn higher returns on foreign reserves or to 
reduce the negative carrying costs of holding them. They 
may invest in equities and alternative investments to achieve 
higher returns.
>
>
Axiomatic in the United States and the United Kingdom is that the 
goal of an investment fund is to appreciate in value and maximize 
shareholder wealth. In other countries, other stakeholders also 

91
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
receive important consideration, including customers, employees, 
the local community, and the government itself. 
>
>
Many countries run budget surpluses that can come from taking 
in more in tax receipts and other revenues than what goes out 
in the form government spending or from trade surpluses. An 
international trade transaction—for example, the United States 
buys oil from Saudi Arabia—involves several components. 
○
○
The balance of payments includes all payments and 
obligations to foreigners balanced against all payments 
and obligations received from foreigners. The balance of 
payments must balance. 
○
○
If one country runs a persistent trade deficit with another, 
something must happen on the other side of the international 
ledger to square it away. The typical transaction of the country 
with the trade surplus is to invest trade proceeds in securities 
or some other asset. Thus a trade deficit is usually offset by a 
positive financial account—including holdings such as foreign 
investments in stocks, bonds, commodities and real estate—
or capital account balance including holdings such as foreign 
direct investment, which can include physical investments in 
equipment, buildings, and factories. 
○
○
The purchase of Saudi Arabian oil thus may be balanced by a 
purchase of U.S. Treasury securities. 
The Singapore Story
>
>
Though it has little in the way of natural resources, Singapore’s 
economy is diverse, with a strong position in technology-related 
firms, financial services, biotechnology, and chemicals. 
>
>
Per capita, it ranks among the 10 richest countries in the world; 
it is one of the few countries with a triple-A credit rating; and it 

92
Lecture 12 • Sovereign Wealth Funds: Singapore
routinely ranks near the top of surveys as the most pro-business, 
and least corrupt.
>
>
Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, conceived and first managed 
by Dr. Goh, played a key role in its growth from an emerging 
market to a developed market in a single generation. 
>
>
The monetary authority of Singapore is the Central Bank; one of 
its duties is maintaining the stability of Singapore’s currency, the 
Singapore dollar. This balancing act can best be achieved with the 
help of foreign exchange reserves. 
○
○
If the government wanted to support the Singapore dollar, it 
could sell some of its reserves of euros and Japanese yen to 
buy its dollars. 
○
○
If it wanted to weaken its currency to make domestic industry 
more competitive in foreign markets, it would sell its own 
dollars and buy foreign currencies.
>
>
A brief history of the fund described the idea as “far-sighted, 
original and bold.” Not only did it foresee that Singapore would 
have balance of payments surpluses for years to come; it broke 
with the convention of vesting reserves management solely in 
the Central Bank, and it conveyed confidence that Singapore 
would be able to overcome its lack of local expertise in global  
investment management.
>
>
Goh also saw that Singapore’s persistent trade surplus could 
be put to better use other than buying low-yielding government 
securities and gold. Thus, the Government of Singapore 
Investment Corporation, or GIC, was born. 
>
>
The real impact comes from what the country does with the returns 
on its portfolio. The Singaporean government is permitted by charter 
to take up to 50% of net investment returns to supplement the 
government budget. This figure amounts to more than $10 billion a 

93

year, or about 20% of the total budget, used to support the economy 
and for social purposes such as education and health care.
Sovereign Wealth Funds in Action
>
>
Offsetting all the good that well-run sovereign wealth funds are 
capable of doing for their constituent populations, some concerns 
remain prominent. In contrast to the relative transparency of public 
pension funds, sovereign wealth funds are opaque. They often will 
not show their holdings, and usually provide only a rough estimate 
of the assets they have under management. Yet nations may 
have good reason for wanting to keep secret the details of their 
sovereign wealth funds. 
○
○
For example, other investors might want to use that 
information against them when betting against a country’s 
currency, as George Soros did by shorting the British pound 
sterling in September 1992. Soros made $1 billion by getting 
that trade right. 
○
○
Five years later, speculators attacked Thailand’s Bhatt 
currency, causing it to lose 30% against the U.S. dollar. The 
Thai currency crisis spread to other Asian nations—it became 
known as the Asian flu—and to Russia, creating turmoil 
throughout the global financial system.
>
>
Another concern of some Western policymakers is the way 
sovereign wealth funds could use their assets to support critical or 
unfriendly agendas. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the largest in 
the world, decided on ethical grounds to divest its ownership of any 
company that derives more than 30% of its revenues from coal. 
>
>
China, in particular, has used state-owned companies and its 
sovereign wealth fund to acquire rights to natural resources abroad 
that might be useful to domestic industry and its own population. 

94
Lecture 12 • Sovereign Wealth Funds: Singapore
>
>
Broad concerns about the lack of transparency, potential control of 
foreign resources, and investment decisions based not entirely on 
for-profit grounds led several sovereign wealth funds to sign a set 
of 24 voluntary guidelines known as the Santiago Principles.
>
>
The Santiago Principles are partly designed by the International 
Monetary Fund; signatories include China, Qatar, Singapore, 
Russia, and the United States. The United States is represented by 
the state of Alaska Permanent Fund, which derives its endowment 
mainly from state oil revenue. Notably absent were Norway and 
Saudi Arabia.
>
>
Most large sovereign wealth funds are owned by commodity-
oriented countries. Saudi Arabia is a case in point about what 
happens when their resources, such as oil, run out. Oil accounts for 
90% of the country’s tax revenues and 85% of its export earnings. 
>
>
Because of the ineffectiveness of OPEC and the rise of non-OPEC 
oil and alternative energy sources, Saudi Arabia has lost pricing 
power over the global energy markets. A key part of Saudi Arabia’s 
proposed solution to this problem is to dramatically expand its 
sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund.
>
>
Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund has been estimated at about 
$150 billion, with plans for the fund to increase to $2 trillion or 
more. The plan for Saudi Arabia’s diversification is spelled out in 
Vision 2030. The centerpiece is the initial public offering of Saudi 
Aramco, which would allow the kingdom to monetize at least a 
portion of its vast energy holdings. Ownership of Saudi Aramco 
would be transferred to the Fund. The plan calls for roughly 50% 
of the assets to be invested internally, supporting areas outside 
the energy sector, like the defense industry, with growth potential. 
The remaining 50% would be invested outside of Saudi Arabia, 
with a global focus. 
>
>
This vision, if realized, raises an issue about the nature of 
competition as government-related entities play larger roles in 

95
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
global markets than in the recent past. Will the playing field be 
level and how effective can the government be in playing a role in 
private industry?
Conclusion 
>
>
In less than a decade, sovereign wealth funds doubled to 
more than $7 trillion, substantially enough to be recognized as 
investment behemoths in the financial markets.
>
>
With size comes influence. From this perspective, sovereign 
wealth funds might become like to activist hedge funds, but their 
motives may be different from those of activist hedge funds, whose 
goal is to maximize the stock price. 
>
>
These issues raise the question of how the global economy will 
evolve. Foreign governments are buying firms outside of their 
national territories. Yet cross ownership might also encourage 
nations to work together, taking the global economy to new 
heights—or to new conflicts.

he term “hedge” in a financial context means to reduce risk. 
Specifically, a hedge is an investment designed to reduce 
exposure to price movements by transferring risk. Although 
no uniformly agreed definition of a hedge fund exists, a good

two types of fees: an asset-based fee assessed as a percentage 
of assets under management and a profit-sharing or incentive 
fee taken from the fund’s earnings, if any.

Fashions in Forecasting,” is said to have spurred his interest in 
setting up his own money-management firm.
The Birth of the Hedge Fund?
>
>
That same year, Jones and 4 friends established A. W. Jones 
& Co. The firm started with $100,000 in capital. Jones put in 
$40,000, and was named managing partner. A. W. Jones & Co. 
was organized as a limited partnership rather than a mutual fund 
and thus was exempt from oversight by the SEC as long as the 
number of investors it served was limited to 99 or fewer and they 
were deemed to be affluent.

Most managed investment vehicles—including mutual funds 
and exchange-traded funds—charge asset-based fees. Actively 
managed stock funds usually charge about 1% per year. By 
comparison, index funds and exchange-traded funds charge much 
less: usually in the neighborhood of 0.1% per year. 
>
>
Hedge funds typically charge 1% or 2% of assets, plus a percentage 
of the profits they earn on your investment. The standard profit 
sharing fee is 20%, but some funds take as much as 50%. 
>
>
Jones consciously avoided regulation and took 20% of the profits. 
He also dynamically adjusted the long to short ratio of his fund, 
meaning that sometimes he would be more long than short, other 
times more short than long, and other times about neutral between 
his long and short positions.
>
>
These 3 characteristics—limiting regulation, taking 20% or more 
of the profits and dynamically adjusting the long to short ratio—
describe the bulk of hedge funds today. 
>
>
Hedge funds managers know that they have no idea what the market 
is going to do, but they have confidence that company A (let’s call it 
Ford) is better than company B (let’s call it GM). By buying Ford and 
selling GM short, they essentially remove the market effect on these 
stocks and keep only the company-specific effects. 
Leverage, Carry Trade, and Arbitrage
>
>
Small spreads between long and short positions can become large 
spreads through various strategies that hedge funds employ, like 
using leverage (or borrowing money) and the carry trade. 
>
>
Many hedge funds use leverage to increase risk and expected 
returns. The amount of leverage varies widely by the type of hedge 
fund, but it can be 30 to 1 or more. More typical is a leverage of 
2 to 1 or 3 to 1 in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when 

99
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
heavy borrowing from investment and commercial banks and 
magnified losses destroyed some firms.
>
>
The unit of investment and commercial banks that deals with 
hedge funds is typically called the prime brokerage unit. The prime 
brokerage unit wires the money and handles the trading back-
office functions when a hedge fund makes a trade. Since the prime 
brokerage unit is a source of funding or liquidity for hedge funds, 
especially during times of market distress, the funds have a strong 
incentive to maintain good relations with their prime brokers. 
>
>
Banks are leveraged by their very nature. A local bank is leveraged 
about 10 to 1. It can lend $9 or $10 for each dollar it has in capital, 
expanding credit in the economy. Some Wall Street investment 
banks used to be leveraged at more than 30 to 1 before the 
financial markets crisis of 2007–2009. After the crisis, Congress 
passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which reduced the leverage of banks 
by to a maximum of 15 to 1. 
>
>
Still, well-capitalized banks have plenty of leverage to offer hedge 
funds. From the bank’s perspective, if it lends money to the funds, 
the fund managers have to pay interest and they are likely to 
trade more, generating commissions for the bank. These loans 
are secured by the assets of the fund, so on balance they are  
pretty safe. 
>
>
In the carry trade, an investor seeks not only to borrow money, but 
to find the cheapest money available. A fund can then invest that 
borrowed money elsewhere at higher returns. 
>
>
Many hedge fund strategies also engage in a type of trade called 
arbitrage.
○
○
In this trade, you made 5% no matter whether the market went 
up or down—a strategy that tries to minimize market risk, but 
you still retain company-specific risk.

Arbitrage extends the law of one price to two different securities—
and even entire portfolios of securities—where both sides, the 
longs (the buyers) and shorts (the sellers) have the same general 
risk characteristics, but different expected returns. Arbitrage 
strategies always involve buying the cheaper item and selling 
short the expensive item.
A. W. Jones’s Strategy
>
>
If Jones’s investors gave him $10 million in capital and he had $20 
million in long investments and $5 million in short investments, the 
difference between his long and short assets would be a positive 
$15 million. This represents a net exposure ratio of 1.5 when 
dividing the positive $15 million investment position against his 
$10 million in capital provided by investors. In this example, Jones 
would be bullish on the market, and also leveraged on a gross 
basis of 2.5 to 1, signifying even greater conviction in his position. 
If Jones was $20 million short and $5 million long, this would result 
in a $15 million net short position. And it signifies a net exposure 
ratio of minus 1.5—and conviction for the bearish case. 
>
>
Jones dynamically adjusted his long and short exposure as well 
as his use of leverage regularly. Jones, like most hedge fund 
managers, tended to be more long than short. Part of the reason is 
that the market usually trends up. Most equity managers are short 
about 50 cents for each dollar that they are long. 
>
>
Fortune magazine’s Carol Loomis wrote an article many years 
ago, “The Jones Nobody Keeps Up With.” This profile, published 
in April 1966, also provided hedge funds with perhaps their first 
mainstream attention. It noted that Jones’s partnership returned 
a 670% profit to investors in the previous 10 years. The best-
performing mutual fund over the same period, The Dreyfus Fund, 
returned 358%.

Fund of Funds
>
>
A. W. Jones wasn’t known for his stock-picking ability per se, 
but he harvested ideas from a vast network of brokers and other 
investors, and he offered generous commissions as a way of 
getting good investment ideas. This flow of ideas was at least one 
reason for Jones’s strong investment performance.
>
>
Jones stopped running the fund according to its original approach 
sometime before or around 1984. By that time, the partnership had 
evolved into what is known as a fund-of-funds structure, which, 
instead of owning individual security positions, invests in other 
hedge funds. The fund-of-fund approach has its pros and cons. 
>
>
Perhaps the best attribute of a fund of funds is a diversified 
portfolio. Today, most hedge funds have a minimum investment of 
$1 million. Unless you’re a really rich person, it would be difficult to 
own a diversified portfolio of hedge funds. 
>
>
In contrast, most funds of funds require a minimum investment 
of $500,000 or less. The managers of a fund of funds typically 
also perform substantial research and due diligence on the 
external hedge fund managers they select. It would be hard for 
most individuals to replicate this research on their own. Funds of 
funds sometimes also advertise the ability to get investors into 
very selective hedge funds of top managers that might be closed  
to individuals.
>
>
The main disadvantage of a fund-of-fund structure is a second 
layer of fees. The most common fee structure for a fund of funds 
is 1% of assets and 10% of profits. So adding this to the common 
fee structure of the underlying hedge fund—that is 2% of assets 
and 20% of profits—results in a total fee structure 3% of assets 
and 30% of profits. It takes a very strong investment performance 
to overcome all these fees, and hedge funds can be tax inefficient 
because of the short-term capital gains they produce.

102
Lecture 13 • The First Hedge Fund: A. W. Jones  
Conclusion
>
>
Today, more than 12,000 hedge funds manage in excess of $3 
trillion. Hedge funds have become mainstream, at least for high 
net worth investors and institutions—including the pension funds 
of many rank and file workers. 
>
>
At the same time, since the financial markets crisis of 2007–2009, 
the SEC requires greater regulation of hedge funds. U.S. funds 
that manage more than $100 million must register with the SEC 
as registered investment advisors. Being a registered investment 
advisor subjects a firm to inspection and requires periodic 
reporting of its assets and client base. 
>
>
However, the SEC does not impose diversification and leverage 
limits on hedge funds, as it does for mutual funds and pension 
funds. In other words, hedge funds can still pretty much do what 
they want with their investments, as long as it is disclosed in the 
operating documents sent to their investors.
>
>
Jones had the foresight to realize that many investors disliked 
the wild gyrations of the stock market that are characteristic of a 
traditional buy-and-hold investment approach. Jones tempered 
market volatility by offsetting his long purchase positions with 
short sale positions, and he realized that he could even profit from 
a decline in the market if he were net short. 
>
>
Jones also added leverage to the equation, an aspect generally 
prohibited in mutual funds and pension funds except in small 
amounts. Leverage gives managers the ability to increase the 
amount of conviction to their investment ideas. And over more 
than a 30-year period, Jones’s partnership earned positive returns 
more than 90% of the time.

Lecture 14 • Activist Investors: Icahn, Loeb, Ackman

Activist Investors:  
Icahn, Loeb, Ackman
C
arl Icahn made activist investing famous years ago. Daniel 
Loeb, the founder of Third Point LLC, a hedge fund with $17 
billion or so in assets under management, is an activist investor. 
Bill Ackman is a part of a slightly later generation of activist 
investors. Activist investors frequently take a large stake in a 
particular company to get management’s ear—or a seat at the 
board table. They use their stakes to spur changes to increase 
the company’s stock price. Their demands might involve 
changes to corporate strategy or management; a dividend 
increase, buyback, or outright sale of the company.
Activist Investing 101
>
>
Activist investors get companies to do what they want, first, by 
talking to them. As you might guess, this tactic doesn’t always 
generate good results. Other times, the activist may publish a 
white paper detailing ideas to improve the company. Making these 
reports public puts pressure on management. 
>
>
Sometimes, the activist will issue a takeover offer for a firm that is 
viewed as mismanaged, or undervalued. As in the corporate raider 
days, the takeover offer may be financed all or in part with the 

105
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
target company’s borrowing power, sometimes in the form of junk 
bonds. In other words, an activist investor might offer to buy some 
or all of a company’s shares, to be paid for by borrowing against 
the company’s assets.
>
>
This offer might be at a premium to the current share price, but 
conditioned on the consent of 50.1% or more of the shareholders. 
The offer puts pressure on sitting management to improve the 
stock price, comparable with the offered premium: Many investors 
would prefer to pocket the short-term in the stock price rather than 
rely on management’s promises of long-term improvements. 
>
>
In some instances, the target firm might pay the activist to go 
away. This tactic is called Greenmail. The payment comes out of 
the company treasury, usually at a premium to the current market 
price. Since typically only the raider or activist gets this premium—
and other shareholders do not—the SEC largely outlawed the 
payment of Greenmail in recent years.
>
>
The most contentious and costly way for an activist investor to 
pursue changes at a company is by mounting a campaign for 
board seats through a proxy contest, wherein the activist attempts 
to persuade other shareholders to vote for the activist’s slate of 
board candidates. If successful, the new board will be likelier to 
implement the activist’s strategy. Sometimes, the new board will 
appoint a CEO handpicked by the activist.
>
>
Some firms defend themselves against hostile takeover bids with 
a strategy called a poison pill. The firm pledges to issue new 
shares to existing shareholders at a bargain-basement price with 
a view toward making the unsolicited takeover more expensive 
and perhaps less appealing.
>
>
Another defense strategy is to find a different partner—a white 
knight—friendlier to management. Warren Buffett is often viewed 
as a white knight because he usually leaves management alone 
when he buys or invests in a company.

106
Lecture 14 • Activist Investors: Icahn, Loeb, Ackman

Shark repellent is a defensive strategy that uses the corporate 
charter to make a hostile takeover difficult. One approach is to 
stagger the election of the Board of Directors so that directors 
come up for election in different years; as a result, corporate 
raiders have a hard time voting their preferred directors onto the 
Board all in one year. Another approach is requiring a 2/3 majority 
vote to remove a director. 
Carl Icahn
>
>
Carl Icahn was born February 16, 1936, in New York City and 
grew up in a middle class family. He went to Princeton and is said 
to have paid for part of his tuition with poker winnings. In 1961, 
he found his way to Wall Street. In 1968, he set up his own firm, 
which focused on options trading and arbitrage, a type of trade in 
which similar assets sell at different prices. The idea is to buy the 
cheaper asset and sell or short the more expensive one, profiting 
by the price difference.
>
>
The seeds of Icahn’s activist philosophy may have been planted 
when he was trying to arbitrage closed-end mutual funds, which 
usually reflect the net asset value of all securities in which they 
are invested. But sometimes the fund’s quoted price diverges from 
the collective value of its underlying stocks and bonds, creating 
an arbitrage opportunity. If a fund’s basket of securities exceeded 
the quoted value of the fund itself, Icahn would urge management 
to liquidate the securities and distribute the unrealized profit  
to investors. 
>
>
Icahn’s reputation as a corporate raider rests in part on his hostile 
takeover of Trans World Airlines. He reportedly made $469 million 
on the deal, and the company was saddled with $540 million in 
debt. TWA couldn’t handle the debt load and went bankrupt.
>
>
Another of Icahn’s higher profile investments was Apple. At the 
time Icahn disclosed his stake in April 2013, some investors were 
concerned that Apple would not be as able to innovate after Steve 

107
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
Jobs’s death. The market also fretted over gains made by some of 
Apple’s large competitors, such as Samsung and Google. 
>
>
But Icahn saw value, starting with Apple’s $100 billion plus pile 
of cash and a brand name that could be slapped on many new 
products. Apple was—and is—one of the most valuable companies 
in the world. So selling it to somebody else was probably not a 
realistic possibility. Instead, Icahn demanded that Apple use its 
cash balance to aggressively repurchase its own shares and 
increase its dividend. 
>
>
Apple eventually followed much of what Icahn proposed. It bought 
back its stock and increased its share dividend, and it experienced 
a resurgence in its core business. Resulting in more than $3 billion 
profit for Icahn and his investors. 
Dan Loeb 
>
>
Dan Loeb December 18, 1961, in California. His father was a 
partner at a Los Angeles law firm, and his mother was a historian. 
Loeb started investing in the stock market when he was in high 
school. He entered college at the University of California at 
Berkley in northern California. And, after 2 years, he transferred 
to Columbia, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics. 
After graduating, Loeb worked for several firms, both on and off of 
Wall Street.
>
>
Loeb began his finance career in 1984 at Warburg Pincus, a 
well-respected private equity firm. In 1991, he joined the Los 
Angeles branch of a traditional Wall Street firm, Jefferies—first 
as a research analyst, and then trading the securities of firms in 
financial distress. His last position before setting up his own hedge 
fund was at Citigroup, as a vice president of institutional sales in 
the high-yield bond area.
>
>
He started his hedge fund, Third Point, in 1995 with only $3.4 million 
under management. His Third Point fund averaged investment 

108
Lecture 14 • Activist Investors: Icahn, Loeb, Ackman 
returns of about 20% a year over a 20-year period. That roughly 
doubled the S&P 500 return during the same time. Loeb says that 
most of his investments share the following characteristics:
○
○
They have talented management teams. Over time, good 
management increases sales, earnings, profit margins, and 
stock prices.
○
○
They are businesses with strong and growing free cash 
flows. Free cash flow is money remaining after reinvesting in  
the business.
○
○
They are firms with a proven track record of capital allocation; 
that is, the company has invested its money wisely over 
the long term, whether in new projects or in mergers or 
acquisitions. Capital allocation also includes returning capital 
to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks or dividends. 
>
>
Loeb calls these firms value compounders. Loeb certainly has 
talent in identifying these types of companies, but his activist 
approach also often closes the gap between a stock’s lesser, 
unrealized value, and its higher potential.
Bill Ackman 
>
>
Born May 11, 1966, Bill Ackman grew up in an affluent family 
in Westchester County, New York, and attended Harvard for 
his undergraduate and M.B.A. degrees. Right after getting his 
M.B.A., he set up a hedge fund, Gotham Partners, with classmate  
David Berkowitz.
>
>
On balance, Gotham was successful, but it closed down because 
of litigation costs related to its trading practices. Ackman was 
found not to have committed wrongdoing and later resurfaced 
with his own hedge fund, Pershing Square, partly funded by the 
conglomerate, Leucadia National.

109
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
>
>
When Ackman talks about his investment strategy for common 
stocks, he sounds like a page from Warren Buffett’s book: Buy 
value stocks that you understand and that have a moat against 
competitors, and buy companies that can be acquired, especially 
if prodded by an activist investor. 
>
>
Like Loeb, Ackman prefers companies that generate a lot of free 
cash flow, an important and recurring concept. 
○
○
The cash-flow statement has 3 parts: cash flow from 
operations, generated by a company’s core business; cash 
flow from investing activities, which mainly refers to capital 
expenditures or long term investments; and cash flow from 
financing activities, relating to the issuance or repurchase of 
stock or debt. The net increase (or decrease) in cash is the 
sum of the 3 parts of the cash-flow statement. 
>
>
Ackman is ideally looking for a company that generates a great deal 
of cash after appropriate reinvestments in the business, giving him 
the flexibility to make his activist ideas more easily implemented.
Value Investing Philosophy
>
>
These 3 investors’ (Icahn, Loeb, and Ackman) addition of activism 
to the value investing approach is a major contribution to the 
philosophy of investing. Value investing is the investment strategy 
that selects stocks based on a belief that they trade for less than 
their intrinsic value. That is, value investors seek stocks they 
believe the market has undervalued. 
>
>
Sometimes stocks stay cheap for a long time, requiring a catalyst 
to push the market to revalue the firm. That catalyst could be a new 
product, new service, new management, or the pro-shareholder 
strategies recommended by an activist investor. 
>
>
A value investor’s worst fear is a value trap—a stock that appears 
to be selling at a discount but that keeps getting cheaper. Think 

110
14 • Activist Investors: Icahn, Loeb, Ackman 
Kodak, GM, Blockbuster, WorldCom, Enron, Lehman Brothers, 
and Radio Shack. The presence of an activist investor like Ackman 
might spur the firm to change its strategy or sell itself before its 
core business starts to slip away.
Conclusion 
>
>
Sometimes, activist investors are likened to corporate raiders, or 
the Darth Vaders of the investment industry, especially by target 
boards and management. In some cases, the negative description 
may be justified. During the initial large wave of activist investing in 
the 1980s, some raiders even tried to raid company pension funds. 

111
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
>
>
A more positive assessment of activist investors is that they help 
keep management on its toes while encouraging more independent 
boards, and putting firms back in the hands of their shareholders.

The Big Shorts:  
Livermore, Chanos
E
ven after the Crash of 1929, Jesse Livermore was said to be 
worth more than $100 million. This fortune and a smaller one 
he earned during the Panic of 1907 were built largely by selling 
short, a technique to profit from falling stock prices. Livermore 
relied on technical analysis, looking at past changes in price 
and volume, in an attempt to determine future price trends. By 
comparison, James Chanos helps us understand fundamental 
analysis: assessing the business prospects of an enterprise and 
digging into its financial statements.
Selling Short
>
>
Selling a stock in which you have no current position is called 
selling short: selling borrowed shares and hoping to buy them 
back later at a lower price. Brokerage firms often include in 
their account agreements a provision called a hypothecation 
agreement, which allows the firm to lend your shares to other 
investors, usually hedge funds. To help a client sell short, the firm 
borrows the shares from another client of the firm.
>
>
To engage in this kind of trading means establishing a margin 
account using borrowed funds. While you have the ability to buy 

113
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
and sell stocks on margin, custody remains with the brokerage firm 
until the transaction is complete and you’ve fulfilled your obligation. 
>
>
Margin trading and short selling also can wring out excesses in 
the economy. An example is a stock that is overvalued: Investors 
rightly expect to profit by selling it short, pocketing today’s price 
on the expectation the price will fall and completing the purchase 
after the price has dropped. 
>
>
Short selling is often considered a risky strategy. The market as a 
whole usually goes up over time, so short selling is trading against 
the long-term tide. But the main risk is that losses theoretically are 
unlimited. If the stock price keeps rising while you’re betting it will 
go down, you are on the hook to buy it at any price to replace the 
shares you borrowed.
>
>
Some market observers think short selling is un-American 
because its practitioners profit from the decline or destruction of a 
company’s stock. Occasionally, short sellers go well over the line 

114
Lecture 15 • The Big Shorts: Livermore, Chanos 
in attacking a firm and its management. But shorts can also serve 
a useful function, such as rooting out suspected financial frauds 
and limiting the size of speculative bubbles.
Jesse Livermore 
>
>
Jesse Livermore was born July 26, 1877 in Shrewsbury, MA, and 
started trading at the age of 14. Livermore initially traded in so-
called bucket shops. These were a cross between brokerage firm 
and bookie, and are now illegal. Bucket shops allowed people to bet 
on stock prices on the side, without the trades actually going to the 
exchange. They were mostly used by small investors and gamblers.
>
>
Livermore was a speculator—the kind of trader who stands in 
contrast with the traditional investment approach of a Benjamin 
Graham or Warren Buffett, who view stock as the ownership of 
a business. The way Livermore saw things, long-term investing 
was riskier than trading. At the same time, Livermore wasn’t what 
we think of today as a day trader. Instead, he generally held his 
positions from weeks to months. 
>
>
His views on trading versus investing were shaped in part by the 
Great Depression, when he saw a nearly 90% drop in the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average from peak to bottom. Livermore felt that 
if blue-chip stocks could fall by such a magnitude, then almost 
any company could go out of business over the long term, and 
therefore buying to hold it was risky.
>
>
Livermore believed nothing new happened in the stock market. 
The names might change, but price movements repeat, and we 
can learn and profit from these patterns. In this view, the Apple 
and Facebook of today might just as well have been the railroads 
and automotive companies of yesteryear. Livermore criticized 
traders who tried to get rich overnight, but he thought it was 
possible for good traders to make a lot of money relatively quickly. 
In Livermore’s day, an accomplished trader could earn 500% over 
a 2- to 3-year period, mainly through leverage.

115
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
>
>
Livermore didn’t trust inside information. He concentrated on the 
leading stocks of the day and maintained a very concentrated 
portfolio—typically 8 stocks. That is 4 industries, and 2 stocks per 
industry. Livermore also traded in commodities such as cotton, 
wheat, and corn. He felt that while individual stocks could be 
manipulated, basic commodities were influenced mostly by supply 
and demand.
>
>
Livermore kept a trading journal in which he kept track of price and 
volume statistics before making a trade and while invested in it. He 
would also jot down thoughts and ideas related to his positions, or 
the market as whole.
>
>
Livermore was a pioneer of the strategy that is today known as 
trend following or momentum—the trader’s equivalent of Newton’s 
First Law of Motion. According to Livermore, if a stock is moving 
in one direction, it will keep going in that direction until something 
changes it. 
○
○
Some people act on inside information and leave the 
equivalent of footprints with their trades. Others uncover—or 
become aware of—news before it is reported. In both cases, 
other investors try to piggyback on their trades. 
○
○
Momentum also works because of market psychology. 
Investors tend to trade in crowds, getting swept up by greed 
or fear. 
○
○
The biggest risk of momentum trading is a whipsaw: A stock 
goes up, then down, then up, and so forth. With this type of 
pattern, you could always be on the wrong side of the trade. 
>
>
When Livermore entered a position, he did it in stages. If he lost 
money on the first trade, he would not put any more money into 
that stock. The trade either had to turn profitable in the relatively 
near future, or he would cut his losses: Each succeeding purchase 
should be at a higher purchase price. If he were short selling, 

116
Lecture 15 • The Big Shorts: Livermore, Chanos 
each succeeding short sale should be at a lower sales price. He 
believed that if your trades showed a profit, it was proof that your 
analysis was right. 
>
>
Livermore’s biggest trading successes occurred during the Panic 
of 1907 and the Crash of 1929. The Panic of 1907 was set off by 
a group of investors trying to corner the stock in United Copper 
Company. This group used a lot of borrowed money, and when 
the stock fell they couldn’t repay the loans, leading to a run on  
the banks. 
○
○
Livermore noticed that credit conditions were getting tight. As 
the market started to fall, he thought margin calls would result 
in a wave of forced selling. J. P. Morgan personally implored 
Livermore to stop shorting during the ensuing panic, when the 
success of the strategy allowed Livermore to pour his trading 
profits into selling more stocks short. Stocks fell roughly 40% 
from March through October of 1907. Eventually he did stop 
shorting, and went long, after earning a profit of $3 million.
○
○
The Roaring ‘20s saw the U.S. stock market rise about 400% 
from 1926 to 1929. One high-profile stock, Radio Corporation 
of American or RCA, went from $2.50 a share to more than 
$500. Livermore recognized that excesses were building up, 
and when the market started to crack, he went short. He knew 
a panic would ensue. As stock prices kept falling, Livermore—
just as he had done in 1907—kept shorting, profitably.

The most famous short seller of recent times is, perhaps, 
hedge fund titan James Chanos, who runs a firm called Kynikos 
Associates. (The Greek translates into English as Cynic 
Associates). Chanos does not rely on momentum trading but 
rather looks deeply into the fundamentals of a company: its 
financials and business model.

Chanos was born in 1957 and grew up in a Milwaukee. His family 
operated a chain of dry cleaners. An excellent student, he enrolled 
at Yale and majored in economics and political science. He began 
his investment career at a now-defunct Chicago investment bank. 
A group of partners there split off to start their own firm, and the 
24-year-old Chanos went with them as an analyst.
>
>
His first high-profile “short” recommendation identified Cincinnati-
based Baldwin-United, a piano maker that had branched out into 
the insurance business. Chanos thought the company’s financial 
disclosures were confusing and received an anonymous phone call 
alleging management shenanigans. In the summer of 1982 Chanos 
issued a Sell recommendation on Baldwin-United’s stock. The share 
price quickly doubled, but the company soon began to unravel and 
declared bankruptcy in 1983. The Baldwin-United analysis gave 
Chanos the confidence to set up his own firm in 1985.
>
>
Chanos looks to short 3 types of firms: companies with a fad 
product, companies with too much debt, and companies with 
accounting problems.
○
○
Fads are products or behaviors that are the equivalent of 
bubbles. They become a craze and then die out. For instance, 
Chanos made money shorting the toy company Coleco, which 
marketed Cabbage Patch Dolls in the early 1980s. They 
were initially scarce, but eventually, anyone who wanted a 
Cabbage Patch doll was able to get one. Coleco ultimately 
declared bankruptcy.
>
>
Chanos’s most famous short is Enron. Enron started out as a 
traditional utility. In the 1990s, the power sector was deregulated 
and some traditional utilities began trading energy contracts, 
which became a huge part of the business at the Northern Natural 
Gas Company, which changed its name to Enron. 
○
○
Enron’s stock price soared, and the company was routinely 
lauded as one of the most-admired companies in America. 

118
Lecture 15 • The Big Shorts: Livermore, Chanos 
When Chanos analyzed Enron’s financials, he found that 80% 
of its reported profits were generated from energy trading. But 
they were earning only 7% on their trades, while their cost of 
capital was 10%. In essence, the firm was a house of cards 
being held up by some strange accounting. 
○
○
Further, he discovered that management used hidden off-
balance-sheet entities to mask the firm’s debt. Enron’s 
accounting misdeeds finally came to light, resulting in one of 
the biggest bankruptcies ever. 
>
>
In 2002, a Barron’s cover story dubbed Chanos “The Guy Who 
Called Enron.”
Conclusion
>
>
Livermore and Chanos both profited immensely from short 
selling, albeit by using different approaches. Livermore combined 
momentum with a keen understanding of the macro environment 
and investor psychology. 
>
>
Chanos believes fundamentals drive prices in the end, and he’s 
willing to wait years to see his bets proved correct. Chanos also 
views himself as something of a sheriff in the market, rooting out 
corporate misdeeds and popping bubbles. The Enron example 
proves that short sellers can act as powerful deterrents to unethical 
management behavior.

George Soros’s $10 Billion 
Currency Play
I
nvestment managers, primarily in the hedge-fund space, search 
for opportunities on a global basis. Global macro managers are 
just as happy to sell short as they are to go long, a bet that 
the asset price will rise. They might pick individual securities, 
but these are usually secondary to big-picture themes: which 
market to invest in; which currency to trade; where to borrow 
money at its cheapest cost; and how much leverage to use.
George Soros

George Soros didn’t aspire to be a financier. He wanted to be a 
philosopher, and to be recognized as a great thinker. He calls 
himself a failed philosopher. As it turns out, Soros did develop his 
own vision, which focuses on global macro investing. 
>
>
George Soros was born George Schwartz August 12, 1930, in 
Budapest, His father was a lawyer and his mother’s family owned 
a prosperous silk shop. The family changed its name in 1936 
to avoid rising discrimination against Jewish people at the time. 
When Germany occupied Hungary in March 1944, Soros very 
possibly saved his life by posing as the godson of an employee of 
the Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture. 

121

Three years later, he left the country to live with some cousins 
in London, and enrolled at the London School of Economics. 
There, he met the person who would have the greatest intellectual 
influence on his life: Karl Popper. Soros was chiefly intrigued by 
Popper’s application of the scientific method to the social sciences.
>
>
In 1956, Soros found his way to New York, joining the investment 
firm of F. M. Mayer and in 1959 joined Wertheim & Co. as a 
European securities analyst. After about 4 years of seasoning 
at this well-regarded bank, he moved again to begin a 10-year 
stint at Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder, today known as First Eagle 
Investment Management. It was here that he entered the hedge 
fund business through a fund called Double Eagle. In 1970, near 
the end of his time at Arnhold, he set up Soros Fund Management. 
The Theory of Reflexivity
>
>
In 1987, he wrote a book titled The Alchemy of Finance, which 
discusses some of his theories about the social sciences in the 
context of financial markets. Soros’s main concept is the Theory 
of Reflexivity.

His first insight was that applying the scientific method to the social 
sciences is problematic because, unlike a scientific experiment 
that replicates results, you might get a different result each time. 
○
○
Soros posits a feedback loop between prices and 
fundamentals—earnings, dividends, and interest rates—
wherein the price itself impacts the fundamentals. 
○
○
Soros’s investment thoughts were influenced in part by Werner 
Heisenberg, one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics, best 
known for the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which says 
that that the act of measuring influences the measurement. 
>
>
Soros’s theory of reflexivity states that the connection between 
participants’ thinking and the situation in which they participate 
reflects two functional relationships: cognitive and participating.
○
○
The cognitive function is the participants’ efforts to understand 
the situation.
○
○
The participating function is the impact of their thinking on the 
real world.
>
>
Because these two functions interact with one another in a 
recursive process, markets are rarely in equilibrium, or balance. 
And yet, equilibrium is one of the central concepts of economics. 
The market is prone to boom-and-bust cycles.
Boom and Bust
>
>
Soros has been able to capitalize on identifying these cycles and 
turning points, perhaps better than any other investor in history. 
Although no two markets are ever the same, Soros provides some 
guidance on how a boom-bust cycle usually plays out. He says it 
consists of 7 stages. 

123
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
○
○
Start with a trend that is not yet recognized by the public 
as a whole, such as the great returns realized by the early 
purchasers of Internet stocks. 
○
○
When the trend becomes broadly recognized, that recognition 
reinforces it; other people act on news and make the same 
trades. Soros calls this the initial phase.
○
○
Sometimes a surge in prices peters out. Price increases don’t 
always result in more increases. However, if the stocks that 
attracted attention survive this initial phase, they emerge 
strengthened. Soros calls this a period of acceleration.
○
○
At some point, a large gap emerges between public 
perceptions and a company’s fundamentals, and the market 
also recognizes this reality. For example, investors might 
realize the company cannot grow profitably or that its market 
value is out of sync with its potential profits. Soros calls this 
the moment of truth. 
○
○
Stocks can stay inflated for a long time. They might not 
immediately plunge in price just because they are overvalued. 
Soros calls this the period of stagnation, or twilight period.
○
○
Eventually, something causes a broad loss of belief in the 
stock. Perhaps the company announced an earnings warning 
or is met with increased competition. This widespread loss of 
belief causes a reversal in the popular buying trend. Soros 
calls this the crossover point.
○
○
Selling results in more selling, causing an accelerating 
downward trend. Soros calls this phase a crash. Stock prices 
fell about 50% between 2000 and 2002, and many Internet 
stocks fell more than 90% from top to bottom.
>
>
In his book, Soros discusses one boom-and-bust cycle 
specifically—the conglomerate boom Shorting the Pound.

124
Lecture 16 • George Soros’s $10 Billion Currency Play
>
>
Great Britain is not a member of the euro currency bloc; its 
currency is based on the pound sterling, not the euro. However, 
there was a time when it was on the path to joining the European 
Exchange Rate Mechanism, or ERM, created 2 decades before 
the formal launch of the euro.
>
>
The vision behind the creation of the euro was to coordinate fiscal, 
trade, and border policies. The idea was to have a currency bloc 
whose members would have a combined GDP roughly the size of 
the U.S. economy and to reduce the risk of another world war by 
linking member’s pocketbooks. 
>
>
As a condition of participating in the ERM, members agreed to fix 
their currency exchange rates within a band relative to the value 
of other participants’ national currencies. At the time, Germany 
had the strongest currency, so ERM members agreed to tie their 
currency to the Deutsche Mark within a plus or minus 6% band. 
>
>
Britain entered the ERM in October of 1990 at a rate of 2.95 
Deutsche Marks for each British pound. Using this ratio, Britain 
was obligated to keep the pound in a range between 2.78 and 
3.13 Deutsche Marks. 
>
>
For the first couple of years, the British economy performed pretty 
well. But by 1992, Britain was mired in a recession. Unemployment 
hit almost 13%. The typical remedy for unemployment is lowering 
interest rates, but lowering interest rates would have pushed the 
British pound lower, and the government had to stay within that 
6% ERM band.
>
>
Market participants knew Britain was caught between a rock and 
a hard place, and traders began to short the British pound. At 
first, the Bank of England tried to defend the nation’s currency, 
buying pound sterling on the open market, and increasing its bank 
interest rate—the rate the Bank of England charges other banks 
for overnight lending—from 10% to 12%. 

125
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
>
>
On the surface, increasing interest rates would attract foreign 
capital, helping to support the price of the British pound, but raising 
interest rates was also likely to make the domestic economy 
worse. It would be more expensive for British companies to raise 
capital, and approval for projects for individual companies would 
depend on higher projected returns; rising interest rates usually 
put the brakes on an economy.
>
>
Hedge fund sharks believed that Britain couldn’t afford to prop up 
the pound indefinitely, so betting against the British pound had 
almost no downside: The British currency would remain pinned to 
the lower end of its range with the Deutsche Mark. But the upside 
was large if the pound were revalued or if it exited the ERM entirely.
>
>
An article published in the Wall Street Journal on September 
16, 1992, acted as a catalyst. Because Germany was financially 
the strongest country in Europe, its Bundesbank was Europe’s 
most important central bank. The Journal article paraphrased 
the Bundesbank’s president as saying that 1 or 2 currencies in 
the ERM could come under pressure, a move that signals a 
devaluation. All eyes turned to England.
>
>
Soros’s chief investment officer, Stanley Druckenmiller, initially 
put a short position on the pound equal to $1.5 billion. But after 
Druckenmiller explained the logic of the trade, Soros told him 
to bet big, to the tune of $10 billion. Soros is known for saying, 
“There is no point in being confident and having a small position.”
>
>
On the same day that the Journal article appeared, Britain withdrew 
from the ERM, abandoning the commitment to keep the British 
pound within a narrow range. Market forces drove the pound 
sharply lower against most other currencies, especially the German 
currency. The British government lost more than ₤3 billion because 
it had been purchasing the pound, which now plummeted.

Lecture 16 • George Soros’s $10 Billion Currency Play
Conclusion
>
>
George Soros’s Quantum Fund, from its inception in 1973, 
provided investors with compound returns of about 20% a year. 
George Soros’s unique life experiences helped him to become a 
very successful global macro trader. His theory of reflexivity also 
provided him with a framework to identify boom-and-bust cycles 
ahead of the crowd. 
>
>
Soros came to believe that modern economic theory has a 
fundamental problem: that it is based on the assumption of a 
market usually in equilibrium, where fundamentals almost always 
drive prices. Soros believed the market is rarely in equilibrium, and 
he added an element of thinking previously all but unaccounted 
for in market dynamics. And that is that investors impact market 
fundamentals through the feedback loop of their own thinking and 
trading in the market. 
>
>
We can learn several lessons from Soros and his theories: 
○
○
First, have a global outlook. 
○
○
Second, try to understand how our own investing decisions 
are based on market movements and the actions of others 
and not simply on the market fundamentals. 
○
○
Third, be cognizant of the market’s tendency to gravitate 
toward boom-and-bust-cycles and the opportunities that these 
movements might afford. 
○
○
Fourth, if you are a trader, as opposed to being a long-term 
investor, be as willing to go short as you are willing to go long. 
○
○
And lastly—for the more adventurous and less risk averse—if 
you have high conviction in an idea, be willing to bet big.

R
ay Dalio has always worked for what he wants and not what 
others want of him. This principle left Dalio feeling that he 
isn’t forced to do anything—he is doing what is naturally in his 
self-interest. But part of his having confidence in an investment 
decision is to see it criticized by others, so he solicits the best 
independent opinions he can muster. If his argument still holds 
water afterward, he can have greater confidence in his choice. 
He calls this approach “stress testing” his opinions. Dalio 
remains wary about being overconfident, recognizing that all 
investments engender some uncertainty

Ray Dalio was born August 1, 1949, in Jackson Heights, Queens. 
He was an only child, raised by a stay-at-home mother and 
a jazz-musician father who played the clarinet, piccolo, flute, 
and saxophone. When Ray was 8, the Dalio family moved to 
Manhasset, Long Island.

Like many boys, Dalio shoveled snow and mowed lawns to earn 
extra money. At the age of 12, he used some of his earnings to 
buy his first stock, Northeast Airlines through his father’s broker. 

129
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
He got lucky when the company was acquired in short order, and 
he tripled his money. 
>
>
Dalio kept investing, and by the time he graduated from high 
school he had a portfolio worth several thousand dollars. But he 
wasn’t a great student, so when it came time to pick a college, 
he stayed close to home, attending Long Island University. There, 
Dalio branched out from stocks to trade futures contracts on 
commodities. Futures contracts offer investors the opportunity to 
trade with a lot of leverage.
>
>
Dalio managed to become a strong and focused student at Long 
Island University, which helped gain him admission to Harvard 
Business School. During the summer after his first year at Harvard, 
Dalio interned as a commodities trader at Merrill Lynch, and while 
finishing his M.B.A. program, Dalio and some friends set up a 
commodities trading shop called Bridgewater Associates. That 
venture never took off, but Dalio held onto the Bridgewater name.
>
>
After getting his degree, Dalio worked as a trader, first at a small, 
well-regarded, investment bank and then at Shearson Hayden 
Stone. Dalio didn’t like the corporate culture at Shearson and 
reportedly came to blows with his department head at a New Year’s 
Eve party. He left Shearson with some of his commodities trading 
clients in tow and launched Bridgewater Associates. He was 26 
years old. Today, Dalio runs the largest hedge fund in the world.
Bridgewater Strategies
>
>
Bridgewater’s focus is global macro- and multi-strategy. That 
is, the firm searches the world for investment opportunities and 
uses a range of strategies, both long and short, with a variety of  
financial instruments.
>
>
Dalio attributes at least part of his success to Transcendental 
Meditation, a discipline he claims to have practiced daily since 

130
Lecture 17 • Bridgewater’s Multi-Strategy Investing 
1968. He believes that meditation frees the mind and allows it to 
detach from emotion and perceive the environment more clearly. 
>
>
Dalio’s philosophy is spelled out in a self-published 100-plus 
page handbook called Principles, given to all new employees and 
available for download on the Internet. Bridgewater employees 
must be prepared to follow these more than 200 principles closely 
and be open to scab-picking reviews of themselves and their peers.
>
>
Bridgewater has two main funds: Pure Alpha and All-Weather. 
Alpha signifies superior performance on a market risk-adjusted 
basis or relative to a certain benchmark. All-Weather is designed 
to withstand any market environment.
○
○
Pure Alpha fund historically has provided a return of about 
13% per year after fees as compared to the S&P 500, which 
returned about 10% a year over a comparable period, with 
less risk compared to the market.
○
○
All-Weather strategy is divided into 4 quadrants, driven by 
growth and inflation. It is managed by using trading models 
that historically have worked in each of the 4 quadrants. 
Thus, regardless of the general state of the economy and 
financial markets, usually at least something is working well in  
this portfolio. 
>
>
Another unique factor at Bridgewater is that the firm lets its clients 
combine the Pure Alpha and All-Weather portfolios in custom-
tailored ways. Academics call the combination of alpha and beta 
strategies portable alpha, and it combines the best features of 
both efficient and inefficient markets. Clients can pick the beta 
exposure they want through the All-Weather strategy and combine 
it with the Pure Alpha strategy.
>
>
Bridgewater is a leader in an area of portfolio management known 
as risk parity. The standard institutional portfolio is about 60% 
stocks and 40% bonds. But more than 80% of the risk is tied up in 

131
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
stocks. Risk parity aims to level the risk of each asset class and 
can be applied to other asset classes on a global basis. The end 
result is a more risk-balanced portfolio. 
○
○
Giving stocks a smaller weight or hedging some of the equity 
exposure—either through derivatives or short sales—can 
lower equity risk. 
○
○
Borrowing or taking on more credit exposure could increase 
the bond-related risk. 
Dalio’s Principles
>
>
Employees are encouraged to engage in constructive criticism. 
Even a first-year analyst has the ability to constructively criticize 
Dalio—supposedly without fear of retribution. And virtually all 
meetings at Bridgewater are recorded, and freely available to all 
employees. Although the culture might work for Dalio and many 

132
Lecture 17 • Bridgewater’s Multi-Strategy Investing 
Bridgewater employees, it doesn’t work for everyone. About A 
quarter of Bridgewater’s new employees are reported not to make 
it to the 1-1/2 year point with the firm.
>
>
Dalio’s handbook, Principles, was originally meant for Bridgewater’s 
employees, but when the financial press heard about it and some 
stories started depicting Bridgewater as a hedge fund cult, Dalio 
responded by making Principles available to anyone via the Internet. 
He stresses that a fundamental principle of the firm’s culture is 
thinking for oneself—the opposite of cult-like behavior.
>
>
Dalio’s management principles revolve around a culture where it 
is acceptable to make mistakes but unacceptable to not identify, 
analyze, and learn from them, where opinions are stress-tested, 
and where reality is faced head-on. 
>
>
Bridgewater trades a large number of models across many 
different types of products and global markets, and some 
important information about investing can be gleaned from the 
way Dalio and his colleagues look at the markets. According to 
Dalio, Bridgewater’s trading system is 99% systematized, or 
model based. 
>
>
Neither Dalio nor his employees follow a discretionary approach, 
but he is a big believer in the idea of evolution. In the context of 
investing, his systems evolve as they gain experience, enabling 
Bridgewater to add or change rules. 
○
○
For example, Dalio looks at how changes in oil prices affect 
countries. Between the first and second oil shocks during the 
1970s, crude oil was discovered in the North Sea. Dalio noted 
that this oil find enabled the United Kingdom to go from being 
a net importer of oil to a net exporter. So his models would be 
updated when the facts change.
>
>
In Bridgewater’s early years, Dalio kept a journal of his trades, 
writing down his reasons for entering or exiting a position on a 

133
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
pad of paper. When he closed a transaction, he would look at 
what actually happened, and compare it with his reasoning and 
expectations when he put on the trade—an early approach he 
took to learning from his mistakes—but it is inefficient compared 
to what a computer can do with a process known as back testing. 
>
>
Back testing is testing an investment strategy against historical 
data on how it would have performed in the past. There are two 
potential problems with back testing. 
○
○
One is that when something new occurs, no historical data 
are available to use as a reference point. 
○
○
The second is finding patterns or rules that appear to work 
but are simply due to chance. Statisticians call this spurious 
correlation. Some techniques can reduce spurious correlation, 
but it can never be eliminated. 
>
>
In creating the Bridgewater system, Dalio and his team focus 
on models that they believe are universal and timeless. The firm 
tests these models over long periods—hundreds of years if the 
data are available—and across many countries, emerging and 
industrialized alike. 
>
>
Bridgewater’s computer models focus on fundamental analysis, 
rather than technical analysis. Fundamental analysis looks at 
financial ratios, valuation levels, credit spreads, inflation, central 
bank policy, and the like, while technical analysis looks at changes 
in price and volume data.
>
>
His Bridgewater strategies now have about 15 uncorrelated return 
streams Dalio believes that these streams can turn a profit no 
matter what happens to the overall market. Dalio focuses on the 
return streams, or drivers, first. He says that drivers are the cause, 
and that correlations are the consequence of observed actions.

134
Lecture 17 • Bridgewater’s Multi-Strategy Investing 
>
>
Two randomly selected U.S. stocks will correlate historically at 
about 60%, since both are probably tied to the performance of the 
U.S. economy. Dalio finds that a portfolio of about 15 strategies 
with close to zero correlation reduces portfolio risk by about 80% 
against a basket of U.S. stocks like the S&P 500.
>
>
Dalio and his team trade in about 150 different markets around the 
world. Markets to Dalio mean not only different asset classes—like 
stocks, bonds, currencies, and derivative exchanges—but also 
spread positions, long in one security and short in another.
>
>
The firm wants to be sure it’s not overweighted in any market. 
Therefore, it trades in virtually every liquid market available, and 
the amount it trades in each market tends to be small in relation 
to the total size of the market. Bridgewater generally holds its 
positions for a year to a year and a half, so that the firm can 
gradually enter and exit positions.
Conclusion 
>
>
One of the unique things about Ray Dalio is his intense focus on 
learning from his mistakes. He thinks that anyone who has made 
money in the markets has also experienced the tremendous pain 
of a terrible mistake and that pain can be a catalyst for growth: 
The same mistakes are then less likely to be repeated. 
>
>
Dalio’s focus on the macro helped him avoid losses during the 
Great Recession, and his focus on uncorrelated return streams is 
an important part of his funds’ risk-control process. Until recently, 
his Pure Alpha Fund had experienced only 2 down years in its 20-
plus years of existence.
>
>
Bridgewater’s culture very likely contributes to the firm’s 
stellar results. Dalio says the culture of the firm is to seek truth 
by encouraging independent thinking and innovation in an 
environment of radical transparency, meaning that people hold 

135

each other to high standards and are completely honest with each 
other while still being extremely considerate.

Paul Tudor Jones,  
Futures Market Seer
A
way to think about futures contracts is the hedging principle. 
If you own something—in the way that Exxon owns oil—you 
can hedge your ownership of the physical commodity by selling 
futures contracts against the same product, essentially locking 
in today’s value and protecting against any decline. Conversely, 
if you need something in your supply chain—like Starbucks 
needs coffee—you can hedge against a future price increase in 
the commodity, and therefore your cost of restocking, by buying 
coffee futures today.
Futures Fundamentals 
>
>
In the United States, futures markets emerged in the mid-1800s, 
mainly as a way to help farmers hedge their risks against the 
uncertainty of prices. A futures contract during the spring could 
lock in the price a farmer would get after selling his crops in the 
fall. Most futures contracts expire within 9 months. This is not a 
coincidence, as the agreements originally were closely tied to the 
farming cycle. 
>
>
Futures contracts tend to be very large; futures contracts on the 
S&P 500 are for 250 times the value of the index. Thus, if the 

137
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
S&P 500 is trading at a level of 2000, the face value of the futures 
contract is $500,000. Investors typically must put down a deposit, 
called margin, of between 10% and 25% of the face, or notional, 
value. The less volatile contracts, like Treasury bills, require a 
lower margin. The more volatile contacts, like oil and gas, require 
larger margins. 
>
>
Every day, the exchange and your broker update the market price 
of your investment and compare it to the margin, a practice called 
marking to market, to ensure that you have enough equity to 
maintain the contract. If the market goes against you, you receive 
a margin call, which requires additional contribution of capital to 
maintain the contracted margin. Otherwise, your position will 
automatically be closed.

The intermediary in the commodities exchange that makes sure 
the trading goes smoothly from start to finish is the clearinghouse. 
It guarantees that the contracts will be honored should an  
investor default.

Suppose you bought a futures contract for 1000 barrels of 
oil, and have no interest in taking physical delivery of the 
petroleum product. You could enter into another contract to 
sell 1000 barrels of oil on the same expiration date. Since 
your net purchase—or delivery—of oil is zero, the trade is 
settled according to the exchange.

When you enter into a futures contract, the price is locked in for the 
life of that contract. But the market price changes every day, so the 
potential profit on a long (or purchase) contract in the futures market 
equals the today’s price less the contracted price. If there are 
differences in the value of the contacts, they must settled in cash. 
>
>
Futures contracts, in aggregate, are informative about what 
the market thinks the price of commodities will be in the future. 
Mapping out the prices of all these different contracts on a graph 
produces the futures curve. Some other factors go into futures 
pricing, but the futures curve provides a good indication of the 
market’s expectations of prices in the future.
Paul Tudor Jones 
>
>
Paul Tudor Jones was born September 28, 1954, in Memphis. His 
father was a lawyer who attended the University of Virginia Law 
School and encouraged his son to attend UVA as well. He majored 
in economics. Two weeks after he graduated, an uncle introduced 
Jones to a legendary commodities trader named Eli Tullis, who 
had a special talent for the cotton futures market. 
>
>
Jones went to work for Tullis as a trading clerk in New Orleans. 
One lesson he learned under the older master was to stay calm. 
But New Orleans is, of course, also home to Mardi Gras, the New 
Orleans Jazz Fest, the Sugar Bowl, the New Orleans Saints, and 
the French Quarter of bars and restaurants. 
>
>
Jones enjoyed the nightlife of New Orleans a little too much. 
His job was to man the phones during trading hours and call in 

139
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
the cotton quotes he got from New York to Tullis’s office in New 
Orleans. But, after partying with his friends late one night, Jones 
said he fell asleep at work the next day. He recalls Tullis using a 
ruler to pry his chin off his chest, and when he woke up, Tullis said, 
“Son, you are fired.”
>
>
Though getting fired was a painful experience, Jones learned 
from it and developed a legendary work ethic. He routinely worked 
80 hours a week early in his career. He landed a job as a floor 
trader at the New York Cotton Exchange and then became a 
commodities broker for the Wall Street brokerage, E. F. Hutton. At 
age 25, he became the firm’s youngest vice president. 
>
>
He decided to begin trading full-time for his own account in 1980, 
when he formed Tudor Investment. Jones says he enjoyed 2.5 
very profitable years but got bored. He decided to build up his own 
firm, instead and, in 1983, he started managing other people’s 
money at Tudor.
Jones’s Trading Strategies
>
>
Jones made most of his money with technical analysis, which 
relies on historical patterns in price and volume data in the belief 
they have some predictive value. A simple technique that Jones 
uses is called a moving average, which averages a stock’s data 
over different time periods and has the benefit of smoothing 
out erratic data. A stock trading above its moving average is 
considered bullish, while a stock trading below its moving average 
is considered bearish. 
>
>
Jones uses the 200-day moving average of closing prices. By 
keeping an eye on the 200-day moving average, an investor can 
sell quickly if the trend is down. Jones advises never averaging 
losers. In other words, if a position starts losing money, either sell 
or wait for the trade to be profitable before adding more capital.

140
Lecture 18 • Paul Tudor Jones, Futures Market Seer 
>
>
In addition to technical analysis and his own personal investing 
principles, Jones also employs fundamental analysis: examining 
such factors as earnings, interest rates, and industry gossip. 
Keeping up with price and volume data helped Jones developed 
a keen understanding of his own personal psychology as well as a 
broader sense of market psychology. Jones also attributes a good 
part of his success to strong risk management. He says, “Every 
day I assume every position I have is wrong.” 
>
>
Jones says that a target investment’s low valuation (or price) is 
not, by itself, a sufficient risk-management technique to guard 
against losses. He uses a number of techniques to reduce risk. 
One is to make use of stop-loss orders. Rather than enter formal 
stop loss orders into a brokerage’s trading system—where they 
might be viewed by other investors—Jones uses mental stop-loss. 
If that number is hit, he gets out no matter what.
>
>
Jones also decreases trading volume when things are going poorly 
and advises others never to trade in situations where they have no 
control, such as trading in advance of a company’s earnings report 
or a Federal Reserve announcement. 
>
>
As his hedge fund got bigger, Jones also came to look closely at 
the liquidity of his positions. Large investors can move the market 
on their own with their buying and selling behavior, a dynamic 
called market impact. 
Conclusion 
>
>
Jones’s trade right before the stock market crash of 1987, when 
he shorted stock futures tied to the S&P 500 index, actually 
went against his main approach of following the trend, and it’s 
interesting from several perspectives. 
>
>
The stock market had traded sideways from 1968 to 1981 before 
moving into a long bull market for much of the 1980s. Then, in late 
1986, one of Jones’s colleagues—Peter Borash—superimposed 

141
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
a graph of the 1929 market atop recent market behavior. The 
patterns looked eerily similar. Jones was convinced that stocks 
were substantially overvalued. 
>
>
The market had more recently experienced a near-term peak in 
August 1987. Stocks were up 44% over the previous 12 months, 
and the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 index was a pricey 
23 to 1—well above its long-term average of 15. 
>
>
Then, on October 13, 1987, at the end of a long wave of mergers 
and acquisitions funded by low-grade corporate debt, known as 
junk bonds, the House Ways and Means Committee took up a 
major piece of financial legislation. The legislation proposed to 
limit interest deductions on debt that financed corporate takeovers, 
as well as other financial engineering, such as leveraged buyouts. 
>
>
Although potential explanations for the turn that the stock market 
was about to take were many, major stock indexes fell 10% over 
the next 3 days: Wednesday, October 14, through Friday, October 
16. That was the biggest 3-day decline since May 1940, when 
German forces broke through French lines.
>
>
Jones was particularly worried about an investment strategy 
called portfolio insurance, which was in wide use at the time. This 
strategy uses derivatives to help hedge the risk of a portfolio and 
includes a trend-following component. 
>
>
No news story or rumor had circulated on Friday, October 19—
or over the weekend—sufficient to rattle the markets. Even so, a 
great deal of anxiety permeated the markets, and while buyers and 
sellers alike believed the market was overvalued, they also were 
confident that they could predict—or stay ahead—of the market. 
>
>
On Monday, October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
plunged a record 508 points, or 22.6%, on the largest trading 
volume in history. (The Dow’s biggest drop previously had been 

142
Lecture 18 • Paul Tudor Jones, Futures Market Seer 
the 12.8% decline on October 28, 1929, known famously as  
Black Tuesday.) 
>
>
Jones made special efforts to safeguard, or conceal, his positions, 
but it doesn’t cost much to trade, and Jones would pay the 
transaction costs to safeguard the confidentiality of key trades. It’s 
been reported that he was up 62% in the month of October 1987.

uantitative analysts build financial models to estimate 
the value of security prices. This approach differs from 
fundamental analysis, which focuses on looking at a company’s 
financials, along with its management, and factors affecting 
the industry, and from technical analysis, which focuses on 
changes in security prices and their corresponding trading 
volume. Quants might look at price and volume data, but also at 
a host of other data—including interest rates, currency values, 
financial statement data, and much more—to create their own 
quantitative models.
James Simons
>
>
James Simons was born in 1938 in Newton, MA, a Boston 
suburb, and grew up in nearby Brookline. Simons demonstrated 
an aptitude for math at an early age, and he was drawn to the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which he entered in 
1955. Simons graduated 3 years later, with a bachelor’s degree 
in mathematics. He went on to get a Ph.D., also in math, at the 
University of California, at Berkeley. He was 23 years old. 

144
Lecture 19 • James Simons: Money, Math, and Computers

>
He was recruited to be a cryptographer by the Institute for Defense 
Analyses, a research group affiliated with the Department of 
Defense; the next year, the math department at the State University 
of New York in Stony Brook recruited Simons to be its chair. 
>
>
But soon, the urge to apply his math skills to the financial markets 
began to take hold. He departed Stony Brook to form an investment 
company, which evolved into Renaissance Technologies. 
>
>
Its research and investment staff consists almost exclusively of 
mathematicians and scientists. By design, very few Renaissance 
employees have academic backgrounds in finance. Simons didn’t 
want his quantitative analysts—or quants, as they are known on 
Wall Street—to be biased by conventional financial theories. 
Quant Basics
>
>
Almost all investment managers use some sort of quantitative 
analysis. Traditional fundamental managers use an investment 
screen to find fast-growing companies trading at reasonable 
valuations and with high profit margins. They might then look at 
the financial statements of these firms and try to meet with the 
management of the firms they like best before ultimately buying  
a stock.
>
>
No model for quantitative analysis is perfect, especially one that 
is based on historical data. Sometimes something new happens 
that has never occurred before. Nassim Taleb, the distinguished 
professor of risk engineering at New York University and a former 
derivatives trader, coined the term black swan to describe an 
unforeseen and perhaps unpredictable event. A Black Swan 
event occurred after the terrorist attacks on the United States in 
September 2011: When financial markets re opened several days 
later, stock prices plunged. So quant models may work, but they 
will never be perfect. 

145
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
>
>
One widely used technique is called a factor model, which estimates 
the relationship between two variables. Independent variables are 
used to help predict dependent variables, and it’s not uncommon for 
quant models to contain dozens of independent variables. 
>
>
Stocks go up or down for a variety of reasons, including for no 
reason other than general market movements. But stocks are also 
often impacted by specific actions, such as movements in interest 
rates. Rising rates, especially when they are unexpected, usually 
cause stock prices to fall. 
>
>
Quants often use dozens of factors in their models. Not only that, 
but when investing in stocks, the models may weigh these various 
factors differently, depending on the circumstances. Quants are 
also constantly updating their models with the latest data. The 
models make adjustments as they go along, changing to reflect 
this new information. 

146
Lecture 19 • James Simons: Money, Math, and Computers

>
Sometimes quants look for signals before making a trade, such as 
a spike in stock volatility, which might be indicative of market fear. 
○
○
The term risk off refers to an environment in which fear 
pervades the market, and investors are selling assets that 
are traditionally risky: such as stocks, high yield bonds, and 
emerging market securities. In a risk off trade, safe haven 
assets like U.S. Treasury notes or gold often outperform.
○
○
A positive signal might be triggered by a Federal Reserve 
announcement that is more welcome than expected. In that 
case, stock prices might rise as part of the risk on trade. 
>
>
The term risk on indicates that investors are willing to increase the 
risk of their portfolio by purchasing more volatile securities, which 
they deem to have significant upside. High yield bonds and the 
stocks of smaller or speculative firms may also do well in a risk  
on environment. 
>
>
Some quants engage in high-frequency trading, a computer-driven 
investment strategy that emphasizes high transaction volume 
along with extremely short-duration positions and automated 
algorithms that do the buying and selling. High frequency trading 
programs often transact on an electronic communication network, 
or ECN. ECNs are basically an electronic stock exchange. 
>
>
The big fear with the quants’ automated trading models is that the 
computer might act unpredictably and blow up the firm. And there 
have been instances when quant models wreaked havoc. 
○
○
On August 1, 2012, Knight Trading Group fired up a new, 
untested computer-trading program. While attempting to fill 
the orders of just 212 customers, it was unable to recognize 
that orders had been filled. And, in some cases, it entered 
orders more than 1000 times their intended amounts. 

147
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
○
○
The result was 4 million unintended trades across 154 stocks 
totaling 397 million shares. The firm lost $460 million in 45 
minutes. Knight’s stock crashed, and the company was sold 
to another high frequency trading firm at a bargain price.
A Cautionary Tale
>
>
Long Term Capital Management focused on arbitrage trades. The 
bulk of its assets were in 4 different types of trades: 
○
○
Convergence among U.S., Japan, and European sovereign 
bonds.
○
○
Convergence among European sovereign bonds.
○
○
Convergence between newly issued and previously existing 
U.S. government bonds.
○
○
Long positions in emerging markets sovereign bonds, hedged 
back to dollars. 
>
>
The differences in the expected returns between the two baskets 
for each of these trades was small, usually less than 1%. Thus, 
in order to get an attractive return, the firm had to use leverage. 
Long Term Capital began trading in 1994, and, for the first few 
years of operations its strategy worked like clockwork. Then, in 
August 1998, Russia defaulted on its debt, resulting in a worldwide 
financial panic. 
>
>
During times of market distress, the most liquid and highest-
quality assets usually perform the best. Unfortunately, Long Term 
Capital was short those assets that investors demanded most. The 
combination of illiquid assets and excessive leverage proved to be 
the downfall for Long Term Capital. On the hook for $30 for every 
$1 it had bet, a roughly 3% loss could have wiped out virtually all 
of the firm’s capital. 

148
Lecture 19 • James Simons: Money, Math, and Computers
>
>
The Federal Reserve, fearing that a forced liquidation of Long Term 
Capital’s portfolio would cause a meltdown in the global financial 
markets, orchestrated a meeting with some of the largest firms on 
Wall Street and the French banks Paribas, Credit Agricole, and 
the Société Generale. The Wall Street firms and the French banks 
collectively agreed to pool $3.625 billion in bailout funds to help 
Long Term Capital slowly unwind its portfolio and thereby limit 
broader damage to the financial markets. 
>
>
The enduring lesson of Long Term Capital is this: The smartest 
people on earth can lose all of their money—and their investors’ 
money, too—when greed, overconfidence, and excessive leverage 
collide.
James Simons Strategy
>
>
James Simon’s strategy at Renaissance Technologies managed to 
steer clear of calamities on the order of Long Term Capital. Simon’s 
Medallion Fund began trading in 1988. It did not immediately set 
the world on fire. Instead, it generated a peak-to-trough loss of 
30% by April of 1989. Simons shuffled the fund’s management 
team and made changes to its computer models to shorten the 
firm’s horizons. The average holding period switched from weeks 
or days to intraday. 
>
>
The changes worked. Incredibly, Medallion returned 98.2% in the 
peak financial crisis year of 2008, when the S&P 500 fell 37%, and 
these returns were net of Medallion’s hefty fees, which ranged as 
high as 5% of assets and 44% of profits. 
>
>
Medallion uses lots of models, and it trades across all asset 
classes, including stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and 
more. Diversification across models and asset classes is likely 
one reason for Medallion’s success. No other fund of has been 
able to replicate its performance. 

149
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
>
>
When Simons stepped down as CEO in 2009, he named two 
super quants to succeed him: the co-CEOs Peter Brown and 
Robert Mercer. Back in 1993, Simons himself had hired Brown 
and Mercer away from IBM, where they were in charge IBM’s 
speech-recognition group.
>
>
It turns out that speech-recognition software has a lot in common 
with quantitative stock analysis. Both tasks require getting signals 
out of noisy data. Speech-recognition software also tries to predict 
what will come next, using techniques from probability theory. This 
type of logic can be extended to predicting security prices, though 
with less precision. 
>
>
Besides the raw brainpower of the quants working at 
Renaissance—and the terabytes of daily data that the firm 
collects—Simons attributes much of the organization’s success to 
its work culture. When asked about the secret of his organization’s 
success, he once said, “Have an open atmosphere. The best way 
to conduct research on a larger scale is to make sure everyone 
knows what everyone else is doing. 
>
>
Quants make a living exploiting market inefficiencies, or strategies 
that appear to consistently offer superior profits. But those who 
benefit from exploiting market inefficiencies often become victims 
of their own success. 
>
>
Since trends seem not to last, quant firms are constantly trying 
to update their models and replacing models that have lost their 
effectiveness. These models may no longer work either because 
they never found a true anomaly or because they worked so well 
as to have arbitraged away their value.
>
>
As the Medallion fund got larger and better established, it became 
too big to produce the returns its investors were accustomed 
to. Management closed the fund to new investors, and today 

150
Lecture 19 • James Simons: Money, Math, and Computers
manages it mostly for insiders. However, Renaissance has 
developed a number of new funds for investors. 
>
>
These newer funds generally have a longer time horizon and 
can accommodate more investor capital. For example, the 
Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund, or RIEF, reportedly has 
the capacity to handle up to $100 billion in capital. 
>
>
From RIEF’s launch in September 2005, though September 2015, 
it returned 9.8% per year. This was better than the S&P 500 return 
of 6.7% per year over the same period, as well as the performance 
of most hedge fund indexes.

Distressed-Asset Investors: 
Tepper, Klarman 
T
he notion of investing in distressed stocks and bonds 
gives some investors the shivers. They would rather sell 
than buy, and move onto healthier firms. But therein lies the 
opportunity. Buying what others don’t want—and what they 
might indiscriminately sell—creates opportunity. That is, if you 
have the temperament to tread there and the ability to perform 
detailed analysis that differentiates a zero investment from a 
hero investment. Two of the best investors ever to set foot in the 
distressed-investing space are David Tepper and Seth Klarman.
David Tepper 
>
>
David Tepper was born in Pittsburgh September 11, 1957. His 
father was an accountant and his mother taught at a public 
elementary school. He bought his first stock, Career Academies, 
while still in high school. The stock traded at $2 a share, and 
Tepper bought one lot, or 100 shares. The company went bankrupt 
and Tepper lost all his money. It was a good reminder that just 
because an asset is cheap doesn’t mean it can’t go lower. That 
was a lesson Tepper never forgot.

152
Lecture 20 • Distressed-Asset Investors: Tepper, Klarman 
>
>
Tepper attended the University of Pittsburgh, paying for his 
undergraduate degree with a combination of student loans and the 
meager pay he made working at the school’s library. He also hit 
his stride, academically speaking, graduating with high honors and 
a degree in economics in 1978. Tepper was hired as a credit and 
securities analyst in the trust department of a local bank, which 
has since disappeared in a series of mergers. 
>
>
He left 2 years later to pursue his graduate degree in finance 
at Carnegie Mellon University and worked for 2 years in the 
treasury department at Republic Steel in Youngstown, Ohio. By 
this time, Tepper already had a lot of experience in evolving and  
distressed industries. 
>
>
In 1984, he joined the former Keystone Investments in Boston as 
a junk-bond analyst. Keystone was one of the nation’s first mutual 
fund companies until it, too, was merged out of existence. About a 
year after joining keystone, Goldman Sachs recruited him to work 
as part of its newly formed junk bond group. And, in short order, he 
became the head of Goldman’s junk bond trading desk. 
>
>
He considered himself one of the best traders at the firm, but 
repeatedly was passed over for partner; reportedly, he didn’t get 
along well with Jon Corzine, who was then head of fixed income 
trading at Goldman, and would go on to become CEO and then a 
U.S. senator and governor of New Jersey. 
>
>
Frustrated, he left Goldman in 1993 to set up his own hedge 
fund, Appaloosa Management. He was 35, and he started with $7 
million of his own money and $50 million from investors. In the 
years since, Appaloosa Management became one of the most 
successful hedge funds of all time, averaging about 27%, net of 
fees, a year over a period of more than 20 years. 
>
>
Although Tepper specializes in distressed assets—meaning 
damaged firms that are on the brink of, in, or recently emerged 
from bankruptcy—he starts with a global or macro view of the 

153
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
world, and then drills down to the micro to identify specific 
securities to trade.
Distressed Investing Background 
>
>
Any list of once-distinguished firms that have gone bankrupt 
would be quite long: General Motors, Kodak, Texaco. Some never 
come back. Others, like GM and Texaco, reorganize and continue  
to operate.
○
○
The billionaire investor, Bill Ackman, made one of his most 
famous bets on the firm, General Growth Properties, when it 
was severely distressed. General Growth is one of the largest 
mall owners in the United States. it went bust during the 
financial markets crisis of 2007–2009. Ackman helped steer 
the firm through the bankruptcy process and turned a $60 
million investment into $1.6 billion 2 years later.
>
>
The two types of bankruptcies for U.S. corporations are chapter 7 
and chapter 11. In a chapter 7 bankruptcy, the firm liquidates and 
shuts its doors. In a chapter 11 bankruptcy, the firm continues to 
operate while taking at least temporary protection from its creditors. 
>
>
One potential resolution may be for the reorganizing firm to issue 
new stock to its bondholders and thereby retire or defray its debt. 
In this case, the original shareholders might lose some or all of 
their equity investment in the company.
>
>
Who gets paid—and in what order—can be complex, in bankruptcy 
court. Employees, attorneys and firms that extend trade credit 
typically are paid first. If a fund or investor group controls more 
than a third of the debt, the entity can petition the court with its own 
restructuring proposal. Two-thirds of the creditors must approve 
any restructuring plan before it goes to the bankruptcy judge for 
final approval.

154
Lecture 20 • Distressed-Asset Investors: Tepper, Klarman 
>
>
For the firm’s security holders, the absolute priority rule determines 
the subsequent sequence. Debt holders are first, ranked by 
seniority. Then preferred stockholders are paid, followed by the 
original common stockholders of the firm. 
>
>
If the firm was considered investment grade before the bankruptcy 
filing, its bondholders can expect to get about 60 cents to 90 cents 
on the dollar. If the bonds were rated as noninvestment grade, 
or junk, before the filing, the recovery rate is usually much lower: 
typically, about 20 to 30 cents on the dollar. This payment is called 
the recovery rate.
>
>
Being a successful distressed-assets investor requires a unique 
combination of skills. The first is the temperament to invest in this 

155
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
risky area. Second is the ability to estimate the investors’ recovery 
rates and envision what a firm will look like post-bankruptcy. Large 
investors in this space also need the ability to create alliances with 
other interested parties in the bankruptcy proceedings to develop 
a reorganization plan that will be accepted by fellow creditors and 
the bankruptcy judge. 
>
>
David Tepper made a fortune by buying the debt and equity of 
bank stocks like Citigroup and Bank of America during the financial 
markets crisis. He correctly reasoned that these banks were 
too big to fail and would be bailed out by the U.S. government. 
Tepper’s funds netted $7 billion in 2009 alone. The example of 
distressed-bank securities makes clear that Tepper is not afraid to 
go where other investors fear to tread. 
Seth Klarman 
>
>
Seth Klarman, the other distressed-assets investor, was born May 
21, 1957, in New York. His family moved to Baltimore when he 
was 6. His father was an economist at Johns Hopkins University, 
and his mother taught English at a local high school. 
>
>
Klarman bought his first stock at the age of 10. It was a good one: 
Johnson & Johnson. Finding himself in regular need of Johnson & 
Johnson Band-Aids, Klarman was following what would become 
known as the Peter Lynch theory of investing in what you know. 
>
>
Klarman majored in economics at Cornell. After his junior year, an 
uncle helped him land a summer internship at the New York-based 
investment firm, Mutual Shares, which specialized in distressed 
and deep-value investing. It was run by two investing legends: 
Max Heine and Michael Price. Klarman said, “I learned the 
business from two of the best, which was better than anything you 
could ever get from a textbook or a classroom.” After graduating 
from Cornell with honors in 1979, Klarman joined Mutual Shares 
full-time as an analyst. 

156
Lecture 20 • Distressed-Asset Investors: Tepper, Klarman 
>
>
While he was earning his M.B.A. at Harvard, one of his professors 
there, William Poorvu, recognized Klarman’s potential and asked 
him to manage some money for him and friends. Thus, in 1982, 
Klarman launched his own firm, Baupost Group, right out of the 
classroom. Baupost is an acronym of the names of the 4 investors 
who seeded Klarman with $27 million. It now manages about $30 
billion and provided investors with a return of about 20% a year for 
more than 30 years.
Klarman Strategy
>
>
Klarman typically begins his investment analysis by looking for a 
margin of safety before entering a position. With bonds, it involves 
an assessment of the likelihood that a company can repay its debt. 
If the company is distressed, or bankrupt, the analysis will include 
detailed estimates of recovery rates. When looking at stocks, 
Klarman assesses various valuation metrics, including financial 
measures such as price to book, price to earnings, price to cash 
flow, dividend yield, and price to replacement cost. 
>
>
One example is Klarman’s investment in the debt of the former 
Enron Corporation while the disgraced company was in bankruptcy 
proceedings. Most investors wouldn’t touch Enron with a 10-foot 
pole, but Klarman analyzed Enron’s assets and liabilities and 
bought some of its debt for 10 to 15 cents on the dollar. 
○
○
Klarman’s analysis suggested the company’s debt was worth 
30 to 40 cents on the dollar. It took a few years to sort out, but 
Enron’s debt eventually traded at about 50 cents on the dollar.
>
>
A way of finding value is to seek for motivated sellers. Klarman 
cites several examples: One is buying a stock after it is removed 
from a leading market index. Index funds typically can’t own things 
outside the index they are formed to replicate: They have to sell 
non-index assets. This type of behavior may temporarily depress 
the because of the selling pressure, but it will eventually revert to 
its fair value.

Klarman also likes to invest in spinoff companies. Many investors 
will sell a spinoff, or divested asset, either because they don’t want 
it or because it constitutes too small a share of their portfolio to 
be worth monitoring. This selling pressure—independent of the 
fundamental value of the stock—may create opportunities.
>
>
Klarman also sees opportunities in an absence of buyers for 
otherwise attractive investments. The major Wall Street firms might 
see little advantage in making a market trading in a company’s 
stock. This lack of competition creates opportunities for investors 
like Klarman who are willing to value stocks independently and do 
original research. 
>
>
Klarman also looks for investing catalysts that are independent of 
the market, such as a company increasing its dividend payments 
or resuming dividend payments after having stopped them at 
some point in the past. The same thinking holds for investing in a 
distressed firm that resumes the payment of interest on its bonds. 
>
>
Klarman is a bottom-up investor who looks at the fundamentals 
of a stock and what it is worth. Macro issues are of far less 
importance to him. Klarman thinks it is easier to be correct about a 
single company than it is to forecast what is going to happen in a 
large and diverse economy.
>
>
Finally, patience is an important factor in Klarman’s success and 
that of most value and distressed investors. He is willing to hold onto 
investments for several years in order to achieve their full value.

ommodities trading in the United States began to take 
shape in the mid-1800s as railroads started to crisscross 
the country. Centrally located Chicago thus became home 
to many of the largest commodity exchanges. A farmer who 
plans to harvest a crop in the fall probably has no idea of what 
the market price will be several months out. Locking in the 
price before the fall harvest reduces downside risks, and this 
certainty improves expense planning. Commodities can be 
defined broadly to include metals, oil, gas, and food. Over the 
years, a large number of commodities came to be traded on  
organized exchanges. 
Commodities 
>

Time magazine once called Jim Rogers the “Indiana Jones of 
finance.” He is best known for bringing commodities such as 
precious metals and agricultural products to the broad investing 
public. Along with the billionaire George Soros, Jim Rogers 
was a cofounder of the hedge fund, The Quantum Fund. Over 
the decade he worked there, The Quantum Fund returned an 
incredible 42,000% to investors. 

160

Today, commodities trading can include livestock, energy (oil, 
natural gas), and metals (copper, aluminum, silver, and gold). Jim 
Rogers suggests 4 ways that commodities investing works:
○
○
Buy shares in companies that produce commodities or that 
provide services to those companies: mining companies, for 
example, or heavy-equipment manufacturers that support mines.
○
○
Invest in countries that produce commodities. Commodity-
rich countries include Canada, Argentina, Australia, and  
New Zealand. 
○
○
Invest in real estate in areas rich in commodities. Wealth is 
created in a particular country is often spent on real estate.
○
○
Invest in index funds, mutual funds, and futures contracts tied 
directly to commodities, though if you do trade futures, Rogers 
suggests exercising caution when borrowing to execute the 
transaction because there is no limit to your potential losses.
>
>
Jim Rogers himself created one of the first commodity indexes in 
1998, the Rogers International Commodity Index, which tracks 
a basket of global commodities. Rogers also set up a number of 
commodity-index investment funds. Today, most large money-
management firms offer their own commodity funds.
>
>
One of Rogers’s earliest experiences with the commodities market 
was his bullish call on oil in the early 1970s. Oil was trading for less 
than $4 a barrel. Rogers realized that oil and gas supplies were 
being depleted, and his research showed that gas pipelines had 
little in the way of reserves. In the early 1970s, the supply-demand 
balance tilted in favor of the oil producers. the Arab oil embargo 
specifically and the lack of readily available alternatives, generally 
no doubt played a role in oil’s massive price acceleration.

Jim Rogers 
>
>
James “Jim” Rogers was born October 19, 1942, in the small 
town of Demopolis, AL. His father managed a plant for Borden 
Chemical, which made Elmer’s Glue, among other things. Rogers 
went to Yale for his undergraduate degree and majored in history. 
While at school, Rogers landed a summer internship at the Wall 
Street wealth-management and investing firm of Dominick & 
Dominick, and by the end of that summer, he knew he wanted to 
try his hand at making his fortune on Wall Street.
>
>
Upon graduating from Yale, Rogers received a scholarship to 
study philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford. As a young 
man, he was influenced to travel in search of adventure by Charles 
Dickens’s novel, The Pickwick Papers. The fictional Pickwick Club 
of London forms a traveling society, in which 4 members journey 
about England, and report on their adventures. 
>
>
The two 6-week breaks a year Oxford offered gave Rogers the 
opportunity to travel throughout much of Europe, and these 
excursions planted the seeds for his future as a world traveler and 
global investor. After graduating from Oxford, Rogers served a 
2-year stint in the Army during the Vietnam War. His posting was 
to an Officer’s Club in Brooklyn, which he helped manage. He also 
began managing the investment portfolio of his superior officer—
which, during a bull market, did well.
>
>
In 1970, Rogers went to work for a well-regarded Wall Street 
investment bank known as Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder, which 
was known for its international brokerage operation. Today, the 
firm is known as First Eagle Investment Management. While at 
Bleichroeder, Rogers met his future business partner, George 
Soros, and the two men set up a hedge fund: The Double Eagle 
Fund. 
>
>
In time, Rogers and Soros left Bleichroeder to form the legendary 
Quantum investment fund, one of the best-performing hedge 

162
Lecture 21 • Motorcycles, Gold, and Global Commodities 
funds ever. At Quantum, Rogers was known for his rigorous and 
original research, while Soros was known for his trading ability and 
his willingness to use a lot of leverage. 
>
>
An early win for the pair at Quantum was seeing the changes 
underway in the trash-collection. Waste services were moving 
away from a municipal-collection model, often dominated by 
organized crime, and toward a more mainstream business run by 
publicly traded companies, like Waste Management.
>
>
The Quantum Fund was so successful that it afforded Rogers the 
luxury of retiring 3 years before he turned 40. He took to traveling 
extensively, taught security analysis for several years at Columbia, 
and wrote magazine articles and 6 books. All the while, Rogers 
expanded his interest in investing globally, with a particular 
emphasis on what he saw firsthand during his travels: emerging 
markets and commodities.
>
>
Fairly early on—and long before the idea registered broadly 
around the world—Rogers became convinced that the 21st century 
belonged to Asia generally and to China in particular. He saw a 
geopolitical reordering of countries and economies.
Investment Strategy 
>
>
Jim Rogers’s investment performance—including that incredible 
42,000% gain over the decade he was at Quantum—did not 
happen by accident or dumb luck. It is the result of enormous hard 
work. It’s said that he didn’t take a vacation for 10 years while he 
worked at the Quantum Fund. He regularly read 40 periodicals and 
8 trade journals. He also devoured hundreds of annual corporate 
reports each year. 
>
>
As an investor, Rogers takes a big picture approach that focuses 
on long-term trends—a macro strategy. Long-term trends analysis 
is also called secular analysis. For example, a secular trend would 

163
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
be high levels of student loan debt among many millennials, 
consequently shaping their spending habits.

reviews 
company 
insider-trading 
levels. 
Corporate insiders—management and board directors—typically 
know more about their companies than outside investors do. They 
are also often paid in stock. If they buy additional stock, it’s usually 
a bullish sign. 
>
>
Rogers also believes in investing only in things or companies that 
you know something about. He says, “Most people know a lot 
about something, so they should just stick to what they know and 
buy an investment in that area. That is how you get rich.” 
>
>
Like value-investing pioneer Benjamin Graham, Rogers likes 
to buy depressed assets with a margin of safety: that is, some 
downside protection to an investment. For example, the company 
might have a lot of cash on hand, or valuable assets that can be 
sold in a pinch. At the same time, Rogers also looks for positive 
changes taking place with the investment: what some analysts 
term a catalyst. A catalyst could be a new product or service or 
changes in government policy for example. 
>
>
Rogers’s favorite informational resources include the CRB 
Commodity Yearbook, an encyclopedia of commodities and pricing 
data published by the Commodity Research Bureau in Chicago, 
as well as reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
>
>
Because Rogers takes a long-term approach, he focuses on 
changes in supply and demand. If Rogers saw a sharp rise in the 
price of a commodity, he would do some digging to find out what 
caused it. The answer might be that aging production facilities 
reduced supply, or newly opened mines for metals increased 
supply, potentially pushing prices down. 
>
>
Rogers’s academic background and interest in history and politics 
help him connect the dots around the world to see how history 

164
21 • Motorcycles, Gold, and Global Commodities 
and events might affect securities prices on Wall Street or the 
commodities markets in Chicago. 
>
>
The fungible nature of commodities—that is, their relative 
interchangeability—shows why they are a cyclical asset class. 
○
○
In the high-price part of the cycle, farmers who may be 
receiving a relatively low price for wheat will shift production 
to a higher-priced crop: corn, for example. The corn supply 
will generally increase until its price settles at an equilibrium 
value, at which point a price-based incentive to switch from 
wheat to corn will no longer pertain. 
>
>
Rogers believed that full cycles in commodities tend to last, on 
average, 17 to 18 years.
>
>
Given his hedge fund beginnings, Rogers is as likely to go short 
on an investment as he is willing to go long. Rogers also takes 
pride in his contrarian streak. The crowd is influenced by mob 
psychology and usually overshoots on the upside or downside. 

165
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
The contrarian can often profit as the market pendulum reverts to 
fair value. 
>
>
In this regard, Rogers is not afraid to bet big on countries he 
considers under-followed, or even unpopular. If he believes in 
a market, he is willing to be the first—or one of the earliest—
investors in that market. This approach often enables him to get in 
at bargain prices. 
>
>
Rogers has 4 tests of what constitutes a good country to invest in.
○
○
Its market must be doing much better than it has done 
previously. This approach helps him avoid the scenario of 
catching a falling knife. one clue he looks for is whether the 
price of the market index holds its own in the face of bad news.
○
○
An out-of-favor national market with upside potential should 
be better off than is generally recognized, with the potential to 
provide a positive earnings or revenue surprise.
○
○
The national currency should be convertible. That is, the 
currency should be based on market prices and freely 
exchangeable into U.S. dollars, euros, Swiss francs, or some 
other widely traded currency. 
○
○
It must have well enough established markets for the investor 
to get in and get out easily. It must be liquid. A market that 
doesn’t trade much is illiquid, making exiting during periods of 
market volatility a challenge.
Conclusion 
>
>
Jim Rogers has lived the dream of many, becoming rich at a young 
age, and traveling around the world in search of knowledge and 
adventure, and he put his experience to good use. he was one of 
the first to invest actively in frontier markets—that is, an emerging 

166
Lecture 21 • Motorcycles, Gold, and Global Commodities 
market for emerging markets—and he is one of the strongest 
advocates of global investing.
>
>
He has done more to educate the average investor about 
commodities than any other person. His keen understanding 
of supply and demand and his relentless work ethic made this 
formerly obscure asset class more accessible to all of us in the 
general public.

Private Equity Innovators: 
KKR, Blackstone
P
rivate equity is the ownership of any company that doesn’t 
trade on a public stock exchange. In Wall Street terms, 
private equity refers to a specific niche of investing: leveraged 
buyouts (LBOs) and venture capital. LBOs involve buying out the 
existing shareholders of a publicly traded company and delisting 
the firm’s shares on the exchange where it formerly traded. The 
deal is usually paid for with debt—borrowing against the acquired 
company’s assets—hence the term “leveraged.” Venture capital, 
refers to investments in young growth companies. 
Private Equity Fundamentals
>
>
The two most prominent figures in the LBO world are Henry 
Kravis, the cofounder of the investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis, and 
Roberts; and Stephen Schwartzman, cofounder of the Blackstone 
Group. Both men became multibillionaires in the private equity 
market. The American Investment Council—the private-equity 
industry’s trade group—estimates that about 2600 private equity 
firms in the United States invest more than $300 billion in the 
United States alone.

Growth is nice, but cash is king in the leveraged-buyout business. 
Piling debt on a company requires cash flow to pay off the 
obligation. The amount of debt depends on the buyout target and 
the tightness of the credit markets at the time, but a rule of thumb 
is to borrow 3 to 4 times the amount of money that you plan to put 
up to complete a leveraged buyout.
>
>
Part of the debt might be obtained from a bank, while the rest is 
often raised by borrowing against the target firm’s assets. The 
more you borrow, and the more leverage you take on, the greater 
the investment risk. 

169
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
>
>
As a result, quite often in an LBO, the debt taken on is considered 
below investment grade—that is, junk bonds. As the name 
indicates, junk bonds have a high credit risk, and must offer 
investors higher yields than conventional debt. The LBO market 
and junk bonds grew up together during the 1980s. 
>
>
An ideal leveraged buyout target would be a firm with high free 
cash flow—that is, cash after expenses; a low debt-to-equity ratio; a 
strong competitive position in a stable industry; and a lot of cash on 
hand or assets that can be sold quickly, as needed to pay down debt. 
This kind of target acquisition leaves the buyer with opportunities 
both to profit on the purchase and to have an exit strategy.
>
>
The LBO market is robust, but it has not been without controversy. 
During the 1980s, Michael Milken helped turn the junk-bond 
market into a popular way for troubled firms and corporate raiders 
to raise large amounts of money for LBOs and other merger-
related activity when he was with the now-defunct investment 
banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
>
>
As the junk bond and merger and acquisition (M&A) markets 
galloped forward, Milken and others were accused by federal 
authorities of various securities-related violations, including 
concealing the true owner of a security, insider trading, and tax 
evasion. Milken pled guilty to 6 felonies, but not to insider trading. 
He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, later reduced to 2 years. 
He was permanently banned from the securities industry, paid 
investors back $400 million, and paid the Securities and Exchange 
Commission $200 million.
Henry Kravis 
>
>
Henry Kravis was born January 6, 1944, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. His 
father was an engineer who set up a successful energy consulting 
and engineering firm in Oklahoma’s oil patch. Kravis attended the 
prestigious Loomis Chaffee School in Connecticut, and Claremont 

170
Lecture 22 • Private Equity Innovators: KKR, Blackstone
McKenna College, which offered strong economics and political 
science programs, which Kravis wanted to study. 
>
>
During his Claremont years, Kravis worked at a number of 
summer jobs, including research and institutional sales positions 
at Goldman Sachs. He graduated in 1967 with an economics 
degree, and that summer worked as an intern for a mutual fund 
called Madison. 
>
>
Kravis then enrolled at Columbia Business School for his M.B.A. 
After Columbia, Kravis worked in the corporate finance department 
at Bear Stearns, a Wall Street securities firm that was a leader 
in the nascent LBO industry. Kravis joined Bear around the same 
time as his cousin, George Roberts. Both were successful there, 
each of them making partner while still in their early 30s. But while 
Bear’s leveraged buyout business was successful, they and their 
boss—Jerome Kohlberg Jr.—clashed with Bear’s CEO, Cy Lewis. 
>
>
These tensions led the trio to leave Bear Stearns in 1976 to set 
up one of the first firms focused solely on LBOs. They called it 
Kohlberg, Kravis, and Roberts, KKR, and their most famous deal 
was RJR Nabisco, notorious, not only for its size, but also for 
epitomizing the Wall Street greed and frenzy that enveloped the 
market at the time. 
>
>
Kravis and KKR first discussed the idea with its CEO, Ross 
Johnson. Under this arrangement, Johnson would reportedly 
pocket up to $100 million. But Johnson partnered instead with the 
rival investment bank, Shearson Lehman Hutton, under a deal 
to take RJR private for $17 billion—$75 a share. KKR upped the 
offer to $20.4 billion, or about $90 a share, but the board rejected 
both offers. 
>
>
In the end, the RJR board accepted KKR’s offer of almost $25 
billion. KKR ended up earning less than 1% a year on this 
investment, according to some estimates. Not a disaster, perhaps, 
but the deal tied up a huge amount of firm capital—not to mention 

171
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
management time and attention. Another 20 years would pass 
before Wall Street tried an LBO of that magnitude.
Henry Kravis’s Strategy
>
>
KKR’s funds historically delivered strong investment returns to 
clients and grew to manage more than $120 billion for investors, 
controlling more than 100 portfolio companies with revenues 
greater than $200 billion a year. A number of attributes define 
KKR’s success.
>
>
Kravis was a pioneer. KKR’s long history is not simply a 
track record, but a network of connections with companies, 
managements, investors, and financing firms that helps KKR find 
deals to which others do not have access. 
>
>
KKR focuses strongly on operational improvement at acquired 
properties, which often results in greater profitability at these 
companies. Improved profitability, in turn, increases the valuation 
multiple at which the acquired company can be ultimately sold. 
>
>
If a public company misses its quarterly earnings number, its stock 
gets crushed. This dynamic results in public companies sometimes 
overemphasizing short-term results. In contrast, private equity 
firms with a long-term focus, like KKR, may be in a better position 
to manage the firm for the long-term. 
Stephen Schwarzman 
>
>
Stephen Schwarzman was born in Philadelphia February 14, 
1947. He grew up in a Philly suburb called Abington and his father 
owned a dry-goods store that sold such products as drapery and 
linens. Schwartzman started working in the store on weekends 
when he was 15. The experience helped establish his work ethic 
and basic knowledge of business. It also taught him that he didn’t 
want to work in retail sales.

172
Lecture 22 • Private Equity Innovators: KKR, Blackstone
>
>
Schwarzman was his high school class president and went on 
to study psychology, sociology, and anthropology at Yale. Upon 
graduating in 1969, he found work as a securities analyst at the 
Wall Street brokerage firm, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. He left 
DLJ after less than a year to complete his obligation in the Army 
Reserves before heading to Harvard for an M.B.A.
>
>
After graduating from Harvard in 1972, Schwartzman joined 
the investment banking firm, Lehman Brothers. He was made 
a managing director by the age of 31 and head of mergers and 
acquisitions shortly thereafter. After a dozen years, Schwartzman 
arranged for Lehman to merge with the financial services company 
American Express: a combination that had the effect of forcing 
out Lehman’s CEO, Pete Peterson, who, until then, had been a 
mentor to Schwartzman. Both men decided to leave and form their 
own firm, which they named Blackstone. 
>
>
Blackstone started as a boutique investment bank, providing 
advisory services to corporations. And then, in 1987, the pair 
decided to focus on the LBO market. Blackstone raised $830 
million for its first leveraged buyout fund shortly before the stock 
market crashed in October of 1987. This good timing proved to be 
characteristic of the firm’s future success.
Schwarzman Strategy
>
>
Schwarzman is intensely competitive and known for outworking 
his competitors. His scrappy nature helped transform Blackstone 
from its startup stage to the largest private equity firm in the 
world, with more than $350 billion in assets under management. 
Schwarzman and Blackstone colleagues frequently seek buyers 
for the firms they acquire even before a deal is consummated. 
>
>
Schwartzman also controls his investment firm’s risk by imposing 
a breakup fee on the target company if the transaction doesn’t 
go through. If Equity Office Properties had walked away from 

173
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
the Blackstone deal, it would have had to pay Schwartzman’s 
firm $720 million. Schwarzman doesn’t hesitate to pressure the 
management and board of target companies to make a quick 
decision on his offers. 
>
>
Technology firms often are considered unsuitable LBO targets 
because their products may have a short life span, and 
technology-intensive industries generally require a lot of research 
and development and capital expenditures to keep the business in 
good shape. That said, Schwartzman will buy companies near a 
cyclical bottom in earnings. One of his most successful leveraged 
buyouts was the German chemical firm, Celanese. 
○
○
Blackstone offered to buy Celanese for $17 a share in 2004, 
but the company’s management kept asking for a higher 
price, eventually yielding an offer of $32.50 a share, or about 
$3 billion, including debt. The deal terms are said to have 
made Schwarzman nauseous, but he met management’s 
asking price. Schwartzman took some comfort that he was 
buying a solid company for less than book value, and believed 
that the industry would eventually rebound. Blackstone put up 
$650 million, and borrowed the rest.
○
○
About a year after taking Celanese private, the chemicals 
industry rebounded, and Blackstone cashed out by taking 
Celanese public again. The net result was about a 600% profit 
for Blackstone.
>
>
Private equity firms like KKR and Blackstone have diversified in 
more recent years into other types of alternative and nontraditional 
investments. For example, they are now active in the lending 
and credit markets. Blackstone itself is now the largest owner of 
real estate in the world, according to Schwartzman, and the firm 
remains heavily involved in the commercial real estate space.

Private equity and LBOs might seem to be part of the rarefied

stocks, bonds, and hedge fund investments.

Four Women Who Moved 
Financial Markets
W
omen, in aggregate, are better investors than men. they 
tend to be more patient, trade less, and have a greater 
focus on risk, all of which are important characteristics of 
successful investing, empirical studies show. Of course, not all 
women (or men, for that matter) invest in the same way. Four 
women renowned for their investing prowess are Hetty Green, 
Linda Bradford Raschke, Sonia Gardner, and Leda Braga. Each 
did it in her own unique way. 
Hetty Green
>
>
Hetty Green was once known as “the witch of Wall Street.” She’s 
also the first woman to be widely regarded for her investing skill. At 
the time of her death in 1916, she was worth between $100 million 
and $200 million—$2 billion to $4 billion today. 
>
>
She was born Henrietta Robinson November 21, 1834, in New 
Bedford, MA. Her father built a fortune in the shipping business. 
Hetty opened her first bank account at the age of 8. She was 
the family’s bookkeeper, and she read the financial section of 
the newspaper aloud to her grandfather. Her father died in 1865 
leaving her an inheritance of about $5 million.

176
Lecture 23 • Four Women Who Moved Financial Markets
>
>
When asked about her investing strategy Green once said, “There 
is no secret in fortune making. When I see a good thing going 
cheap because nobody wants it, I buy a lot of it and tuck it away.” 
>
>
Green avoided borrowing money or otherwise using leverage. Her 
discipline and fearlessness buying during panics—which occurred 
in 1857, 1873, 1893, 1901, and 1907—played an important role in 
her investing success. Green also amassed a real estate portfolio, 
acquiring 6000 pieces of property across 48 states. 
>
>
Notwithstanding her wealth, Green was known for her miserly 
behavior. She supposedly never turned on the heat or used hot 
water. She often wore the same clothes and dined on graham 
crackers, ham sandwiches, and small pies. Green also minimized 
the taxes she paid, routinely changing her residence so she 
couldn’t be found by tax collectors. Once, when her son injured his 
leg in a sledding accident, Green took him to a charity hospital for 
free care.
Big Picture

A brokerage account application includes various data points 
such as income, trading experience, gender, and marital status. 
University of California researchers Brad Barber and Terrence 
Odean, analyzed the trading records of a large discount brokerage 
firm between 1991 and 1997, reflecting the financial information of 
about 35,000 U.S. households.

The data revealed that women investors outperformed men 
by 1.4% annually on a risk-adjusted basis. How actively one 
traded played a key role in this result. The research found that 
men traded 45% more, on average, than women did. Barber 
and Odean attribute the higher incidence of trading to the men’s 
overconfidence in their trading ideas.

The results were even more pronounced among single men and 
single women. Single men traded 67% more often than single 
women did; and the women outperformed the men by 2.3% a year.

Another study found that hedge funds run by women outperformed 
the aggregate hedge fund index every year from 2007 to 2014. 
Woman-run hedge funds generated annual returns of 5.64% and 
a cumulative return of 59.43% compared to index returns of 3.75% 
annually and 36.69% cumulatively.
Linda Bradford Raschke

Linda Bradford Raschke was born in 1959 in Pasadena, CA, and 
as a child, she helped her father look for patterns in the charts 
of stock prices. She attended Occidental College in Los Angeles, 
where she double-majored in economics and musical composition. 
>
>
At Occidental, Raschke also became involved in a program in 
which students managed a trust fund set up by a school donor. 
After graduation she tried to get a job as a stockbroker, but was 
turned down by every firm she applied to. Eventually, Raschke was 
offered a position as a floor trader on the Pacific Stock Exchange 
for a 50/50 split of the profits she generated. 
>
>
Raschke is a short-term trader with a focus on technical analysis. 
She trades in 20 different markets and usually is active in about 
6 at any given time. She looks for patterns in security prices by 
analyzing historical price movements and trading volume data. 
Raschke believes that her most important skill is her ability to 
perceive patterns, an ability she attributes to her musical training. 
>
>
Discipline and concentration are related to patience, a skill 
Raschke believes is important for a trader. Raschke focuses on 
short-term strategies over periods of a couple of days to a couple 
of weeks. She says she believes short-term price swings can be 
predicted with some degree of precision because they are based 
on human behavior. 

178
Lecture 23 • Four Women Who Moved Financial Markets
>
>
Raschke especially likes one pattern based on contrarian 
psychology: If the price of a stock, bond, or commodity is trending 
up for several days in a row, then almost everyone likes it and it 
is ripe for a fall, so she will sell it short. Conversely, if the same 
asset falls for several days in a row, human psychology tends to 
be mostly bearish, and she may be inclined to step in to buy. This 
strategy is summarized in her statement that successful traders 
buy into bad news and sell into good news.
>
>
She helps fine-tune her exit and entry points on contrarian trades 
with a formula known as a McClellan oscillator, calculated by 
finding the numbers of advancing and declining stocks adjusted by 
a moving average of prices. It provides a measure of overbought 
or oversold positions and helps her determine if the pendulum has 
swung too far in one direction. 
>
>
One of the techniques Raschke uses is a matrix that contains 
probabilities on historical price patterns. The first dimension 
corresponds to the past behavior of the asset. The second 
dimension is what will happen to the stock price in the future. The 
items inside the matrix are the probabilities of transitioning from 
one dimension to the other.
>
>
Raschke’s number one rule is, “Don’t try to make a profit on a bad 
trade; just try to find the best place to get out.” She also advises, 
“Never add to a losing position.” 
Sonia Gardner
>
>
Another accomplished female investor is Sonia Gardner, who—
with her brother Marc Lasry—manages more than $10 billion 
through their New York hedge fund, Avenue Capital Group, which 
focuses on distressed assets. 
>
>
Gardner was born February 16, 1962, in Morocco. A few years 
later, her family moved to Milford, CT, where she shared a room 

179
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
with her brother and a younger sister. Their father was a computer 
programmer and their mother taught French at a private school. 
>
>
Gardner attended Clark University in Worcester, MA, majoring 
in philosophy and graduating in 1983 with honors. She went on 
to earn her law degree at the Benjamin Cardozo School of Law 
in New York. Lasry got a job managing about $50 million of the 
partners’ capital at the New York investment banking firm, The 
Cowen Group, and soon he needed a lawyer he could trust. 
>
>
During their time at Cowen, Gardner and Lasry met the reclusive 
Texas investor, Robert Bass, who hired them to manage a $75 
million portfolio of distressed assets for him. Bass also let them 
create a brokerage firm under the Bass umbrella, called Amroc 
Investments. Two years later, the pair left the Bass organization 

180
Lecture 23 • Four Women Who Moved Financial Markets
to run their own debt-brokerage firm, which kept the name Amroc 
and maintained an affiliation with the Robert Bass group. 
>
>
To diversify Amroc’s business, Gardner and Lasry formed the 
hedge fund management company, Avenue Capital Group, which 
they started in 1995 with $10 million in capital. Five years later, it 
had $1 billion under management. Gardner was initially a portfolio 
manager, instrumental in producing returns that enabled the firm 
to grow rapidly. Later, she transitioned to executive management, 
overseeing all operations. 
>
>
Avenue capital’s basic investment philosophy is to find good 
companies with bad balance sheets. Further, it looks to find firms 
with sustainable businesses and positive cash flow, but whose 
financial situation is distressed. 
>
>
Avenue Capital typically commits to about 50 investments at a time. 
It states that it avoids leverage, and tries to keep a cash cushion 
of about 10% to 20% to take advantage of new opportunities and 
to avoid a cash crunch when liquidity dries up. Avenue Capital 
suffered losses of about 25% during the 2007–2009 recession, but 
it bounced back so strongly that it was able to return $9 billion to 
its investors a few years later. 
Leda Braga 
>
>
Leda Braga is the founder and CEO of Systematica Investments, 
with more than $10 billion under management. She probably 
manages more money on a day-to-day basis than any other 
woman in the world. Braga was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1966. 
She earned a Ph.D. in engineering from Imperial College London, 
where she remained for 3 years afterward as a lecturer. 
>
>
Braga went on to join J. P. Morgan in London as part of its 
derivatives research team. When J. P. Morgan spun off part of 
the derivatives business into a firm called Cygnifi Derivatives 

181
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
Services, Braga joined as the head of valuation. When J. P. 
Morgan colleague Michal Platt cofounded the hedge fund, Blue 
Crest Capital Management, Braga moved to Blue Crest, where 
she was a star as it grew into the largest hedge fund in Europe.
>
>
Braga formed her own firm, Systematica, with Blue Crest initially 
retaining a 49% stake. Systematica trades in more than 150 
markets around the world—including equities, fixed income, 
foreign exchange, energy, metals and agricultural commodities. Its 
models look not only at price data, which can be used to evaluate 
trends, but also such information as interest rates, currency 
movements, and financial statements.
>
>
Price trend following seems to work, over time, for a number of 
reasons. Market psychology—be it fear or greed—tends to move 
in waves. Some investors extrapolate near-term to the long 
term, resulting in trend-following behavior. Often some investors 
uncover information before others and act on it, moving the 
price. Eventually the information becomes widely known, further 
reinforcing the trend.
>
>
Systematica’s models tend to be market neutral. That is, they try 
to be independent of the market movement as a whole. Generally, 
a portfolio can be made market neutral with offsetting hedge 
positions, such as shorting a market index or specific securities. 
Braga’s portfolios also aim to limit exposure to other factors, such 
as being too big in an illiquid market.
>
>
When a Newsweek reporter tried to speak with Braga awhile back 
for an article on women and investing, she declined to comment. A 
spokesperson said she preferred to speak about investing, rather 
than gender.

Becoming a Great Investor 
T
he challenge of developing your own investment philosophy 
and approach, as sketched by the models considered at in 
this course, should match your personality, skills, risk tolerance, 
and resources. You will need a high degree of self-knowledge 
and confidence to choose whether to be a growth or a value 
investor; whether you will actively manage your portfolio or turn 
it over to a professional advisor; whether to accept the risks 
of using leverage or avoid debt altogether. Whatever path you 
choose, continue to study and learn from the great investors 
who have gone before you. 
The Chrysler Story
>
>
Walter Percy Chrysler was born on April 2, 1875, and grew up in 
Ellis, IA, where his father was an engineer for the Union Pacific 
Railroad. Given his father’s profession, it’s no surprise that Walter 
Chrysler started his own career as a railroad mechanic and 
machinist before making his way into the automotive business. 
>
>
Over the next century, the Chrysler Corporation’s up-and-down 
fortunes taught us something about how to look at the stock 
market—or any investment. At one point or another, Chrysler 
has been all of the following: a growth stock, a value stock, a 
distressed asset, a mergers-and-acquisitions target, a bankruptcy, 

184
Lecture 24 • Becoming a Great Investor 
a government-owned corporation, a private equity asset, an 
international asset, a small-cap stock, and a large-cap stock.
>
>
The auto industry came to signify what growth investor T. Rowe 
Price called cyclical growth—that is, sensitive to the macro-
economy and each part of its cycle. The car makers’ momentum 
slowed substantially as oil prices quadrupled during, and after, 
the oil embargo of 1973–1974, when American automakers were 
caught flat-footed with fleets of gas guzzling models. 
>
>
Chrysler, in particular, was on shaky financial ground by the late 
1970s and hired a firebrand former Ford Motors president, lee 
Iacocca, to run the troubled company. Although Chrysler was 
losing money hand over fist—and on the verge of bankruptcy—
Iacocca persuaded Congress to support the company with a loan 
guarantee that kept the company afloat, at least temporarily. A 
new lineup of vehicles, led by the fuel-efficient K-car series and 
the newly invented minivan, is what really saved Chrysler. 
>
>
Peter Lynch started buying Chrysler stock in 1982, reasoning 
that the government loan guarantee insulated Chrysler from 
bankruptcy and that its cash position was markedly improved by 
the $1 billion sale of its military tank division to defense contractor 
General Dynamics. 
>
>
The next seminal moment in Chrysler’s history occurred when 
Germany’s Daimler-Benz acquired Chrysler for $36 billion in 1998. 
Nine years later, Daimler sold 80% of Chrysler for $7.4 billion to 
the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Cerberus 
thought it was buying an impaired firm at an attractive price, but 
the financial markets crisis and recession of 2007–2009 wiped out 
both Chrysler and GM, leaving them bankrupt and their common 
shares essentially worthless. 
>
>
Chrysler received another government bailout. Then, in a series 
of transactions, Fiat bought the U.S. government stake in Chrysler 

185
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
for $11.2 billion, resulting in a loss of roughly $1.3 billion for  
U.S. taxpayers. 
>
>
Several lessons are clear from Chrysler’s story. One is that picking 
a winner in a new and growing industry like automobiles can be 
very profitable, at least for a time. A second is the dynamic nature 
of companies and industries. Chrysler, a firm that helped usher in 
the golden age of automobiles, went bankrupt once—and almost 
twice. A third is the increasingly global nature of financial markets.
Investment Checklist
>
>
The first item on the checklist is risk. Everyone needs a strategy to 
deal with risk. One aspect of a risk-management plan is to identify 
how much you want to earn or how much you can afford to lose. 
What are your upper and lower boundaries, in terms of financial 
risk and reward? 
○
○
When you’re starting out in life, typically you can afford to 
take on greater financial risks, even with fewer assets, on the 
expectation that your nest egg will grow, and you will have 
time to overcome any losses.
○
○
Find a level of diversification consistent with your risk 
tolerance. Owning a portfolio of treasury securities is not 
very diversified but is considered low risk. Owning a portfolio 
of distressed assets is also not very diversified, and the risk 
might be quite high. If you combine lower- and higher-risk 
instruments—such as growth stocks, utility bonds, and other 
instruments—you can develop a portfolio that is custom-
blended for your personal risk tolerance.
>
>
The second item is investment approach. Active investing refers 
to a strategy that tries to outperform the market. Passive investing 
refers mostly to index funds, which mirror the performance of a 
widely followed market index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average or S&P 500. 

186
24 • Becoming a Great Investor 

187
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
○
○
Passive investing might also take a long-term buy-and-hold 
approach, even without trying to track an index. John Bogle, 
the founder of the mutual fund company vanguard, showed 
us that passive investing strategies often outperform actively 
managed mutual funds.
>
>
Third, you’ll need to know what types of financial securities you 
want to invest in and how actively you want to change your weights 
or allocations devoted to them. A wide range of investments is 
available for everyone—from the cautious and inexperienced 
to the expert and adventurous; from basic stocks and bonds 
to hedge funds, private equity, and even some very exotic  
derivative instruments. 
>
>
The rest of the questions on my checklist apply mostly to people 
who want to take an active role in managing their investments, 
rather than outsourcing the activity to a trusted advisor.
>
>
What investing edge might you possess? The former Fidelity 
Investments portfolio manager Peter Lynch says, “Invest in what 
you know.” If you think about it, you probably do know a lot about 
at least one slice of the investment universe—from your job, your 
school, your community, your family, and this knowledge might be 
your edge when it comes to investing.
>
>
Do you want to be a trader who buys and sells or an investor who 
buys and holds? A trader typically focuses on a time horizon of 
less than one year, while an investor maintains a horizon of a year 
or more. 
>
>
You should also ask yourself whether you are a growth investor or 
value investor, or some combination. 
○
○
Investors like Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett are 
value investors while Philip Fisher and T. Rowe Price are 
growth investors. In contrast, John Templeton, a pioneer 
of international investing, adopted a flexible approach that 

188
Lecture 24 • Becoming a Great Investor 
encompasses both, and he gave us the question: Should 
international securities be part of my portfolio?
>
>
Continuing, ask yourself: large-cap, small-cap, or both? Large-cap 
firms are generally more stable and often pay a dividend. Small-
cap firms often have less information available, but historically 
have had higher returns and higher risk over long periods.
>
>
A more difficult question, requiring some deeper expertise, is 
whether your approach will be mostly fundamental, technical, 
quantitative, or some combination. 
○
○
Seth Klarman is an example of a fundamental analyst who 
analyzes a firm’s financials and understands company 
operations, industry, and management in great detail. 
Alternatively, Jesse Livermore was one of the most successful 
practitioners of technical analysis; an approach that focuses 
on finding patterns in past price movements that could be 
useful in predicting future prices. 
○
○
Hedge fund managers James Simons and Leda Braga are 
quantitative investors. They don’t visit companies or even care 
what a company does, but rather spend their time building 
mathematical models that predict where security prices  
are going.
>
>
Ask yourself what investments mistakes you make or are 
susceptible to making. Market psychology, or behavioral finance, 
is the field of analyzing investor mistakes and tendencies—and 
profiting on them. 
○
○
The contrarian investor David Dreman is often willing to buy 
what the market seems to hate—like tobacco stocks, when 
they were being investigated by the federal government. 
○
○
Ray Dalio, who runs the world’s largest hedge fund, suggests 
keeping a trading or investment journal detailing the rationale 

189
The Art of Investing: Lessons from History’s Greatest Traders
for your investments and their outcomes, as one way of 
uncovering and learning from your mistakes.
○
○
By contrast, other successful investors, like Linda Raschke, 
harness the power intuition part of their trading or investment 
process. If you find your intuition to be associated with 
some of your better investment decisions, perhaps it can be 
incorporated into your investment philosophy.
>
>
Finally, ask yourself if you have the temperament to follow the 
rules you set up. Jesse Livermore, was a great trader, but he made 
and lost several fortunes over his lifetime. He said he lost money 
when he didn’t follow his own rules. Your investment philosophy 
and approach should match your personality, skills, risk tolerance, 
and resources. 
Conclusion
>
>
One final great investor is Joel Greenblatt, who might not be a 
household name, but he has one of the best investment track 
records of all-time. During the decade when Greenblatt ran the 
hedge fund Gotham Capital, he generated annual returns of 50% 
before fees. He ultimately closed the fund and returned the profits 
and original capital to outside investors, but he and his colleagues 
continued to manage their own money, with stellar results. 
>
>
Joel Greenblatt was born December 13, 1957, in Great Neck, Long 
Island, about an hour from Manhattan, and attended the University 
of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School ultimately earning an M.B.A. After 
one year in law school, Greenblatt realized he wasn’t interested in a 
legal career and took a job as a risk-arbitrage and special situations 
analyst at a startup hedge fund called Halcyon Investments. 
>
>
He was soon doubling his money trading in his personal account, 
so a friend put him in touch with Michael Milken, the junk bond 
king. Milken offered to put up the bulk of the money for a new fund 

190
Lecture 24 • Becoming a Great Investor 
Greenblatt wanted to manage, and he launched Gotham Capital in 
1985 with $7 million under management. 
>
>
Greenblatt’s most famous strategy revolves around finding good 
stocks that are also cheap. Greenblatt’s thoughts are deep, and his 
logic compelling. He outlines an investing approach that combines 
value investing with special-situations investing. Special-situations 
investing focuses on nontraditional investments like spinoffs, 
merger arbitrage, rights offerings, long-term options, and others. 
>
>
Greenblatt provides some specific advice to improve your results. 
He suggests looking for businesses that institutional investors—
such as pensions and insurance companies—don’t want, 
especially if they are too small for the big institutions to own. 
Greenblatt also says to look at the behavior of corporate insiders: 
whether they are buying or selling. They know the business best.
>
>
As we saw with both Walter Chrysler and Joel Greenblatt—
your investment philosophy and approach should match your 
personality, skills, risk tolerance, and resources.
