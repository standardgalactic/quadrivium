Week 11: Acid-Base Balance - General Concepts & Renal Tubule function
1. The major extracellular buffer in the body is:
 
A. hemoglobin
 
B. bicarbonate
 
C.carbon dioxide 
 
D. sodium
2. The dominant site for reabsorption of bicarbonate in the renal tubule is the:
 
A. Proximal convoluted tubule
 
B. Thin loop of Henle
 
C. Thick ascending loop of Henle
 
D. Collecting duct
3. In the peritubular capillary of the kidney, reabsorption occurs because:

B. the oncotic pressure equals the hydrostatic pressure.  
 
C. the oncotic pressure is greater than the hydrostatic pressure.
Correct Answer 1: B. bicarbonate
Correct Answer 2: A. Proximal convoluted tubule
Correct Answer 3: C. the oncotic pressure is greater than the hydrostatic pressure.
