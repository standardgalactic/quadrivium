Preface
P
Cs have evolved from obscure kits built by hobbyists to something found
in every part of people’s lives. PCs are now used for much more than
ofﬁce automation, but those applications require that you know something
about the inner workings of your computer to get the best results. The PC
Upgrade and Repair Bible will tell you about the computer hardware you need
to run today’s personal computer operating systems and Internet software,
and help you to ﬁgure out what conﬁguration of hardware is best for your com-
puting needs. The information inside will help you evaluate what you need to
run Windows or UNIX and what you need to access the Internet.
Tuning your hardware conﬁguration using the ideas in this book will help you
get more out of your computer. The current generations of Windows (Windows
2000 and Windows XP) can do more for you than their predecessors, but place
greater demands on your computer than those predecessors. Similarly, UNIX
(be it Linux, FreeBSD, or another version) can be a wonderfully low-cost and
stable network platform, but the resources it needs to respond well to an
onslaught of network trafﬁc can be large, too.
Whether you have thousands of machines on a corporate network, a few
machines in a small ofﬁce, or a machine at home shared between work and
family, a computer sized for what you do will give you the power you need to
get your work done. Using the latest operating systems, you can run more pro-
grams at once, access a greater variety of networks, and use new kinds of
hardware to the fullest extent. For most users, this increased capability will
expand what you do with your computer, which in turn might require more
hardware than before. Doing more with your computer makes you more pro-
ductive, but makes the computer hardware work harder.
Is This Book for You?
This book provides the information you need to make effective hardware
choices, including coverage of system components, upgrades, and new sys-
tems. It covers hardware for current and emerging technologies, including
wireless LANs, ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) and cable TV net-
works, and digital video.
This is a book both for people who will be opening up and working on their
computers and for people who want to understand what goes on inside a com-
puter. You’ll see what’s inside, what the pieces do, how they work, and how
they’re connected. You’ll learn what determines the performance of your com-
puter, what your options are for more performance, and how to add new capa-
bilities to your computer.

This book is for you if you want to
✦Evaluate the suitability of upgrading an existing computer
✦Determine the upgrades needed to make an underpowered machine
suitable for your speciﬁc purposes
✦Specify an effective new conﬁguration of an existing machine to meet
your requirements
✦Buy the right new machine
✦Build a new machine from components that precisely meet your needs
✦Integrate your PCs into local area networks and the Internet
✦Tune your computer system for peak performance
✦Install upgrades into an existing machine
There’s no real magic to working on the insides of your computer. However, it
can be complex, and you might encounter odd results that you have to diag-
nose and correct. If you’re comfortable working with Windows or UNIX when
things go wrong, you’ve got the most important prerequisite. If in addition to
that you can work successfully on small, delicate mechanical parts, this book
can teach you how to work inside your computer.
It’s not mandatory that you take apart your computer to get the most from this
book. If you understand how to use your computer but want to know what
goes on behind the scenes, read this book. We’ll show you what’s inside and
how it works.
What’s in This Book
We’ve organized this book into seven parts and a glossary:
✦Part I: Introduction (Chapters 1–3) — It seems obvious that not
everyone needs the same computer, but it takes some analysis to see
the details behind why that’s true. You don’t have to settle for a hob-
bled machine — not with the cheap, screamingly fast ones on the
market now — but you get the most value by thinking through what
you’ll really beneﬁt from. This part of the book looks at the problem
from high altitude: What can you tell about what you need from the
outside?
✦Part II: Processors and Motherboards (Chapters 4–5) — Part II
teaches you about the core of your computer, the processor chip and
the electronics that surround it. Everything you do with your com-
puter depends on and plugs into this core.
✦Part III: Video (Chapters 6–7) — Part III starts the explanations of
the key subsystems in your PC, covering your video card and moni-
tor. Nearly all your interaction with your PC is through the display,
and good display performance is critical for much of what you’ll do
with your PC.
x Preface

✦Part IV: Storage (Chapters 8–10) — Seemingly a dull area of com-
puter design a decade ago, the sizes of and options for computer
storage have exploded. Part IV covers how disks work and how to
integrate them, what you can do with CD and DVD, and the latest in
USB-attached external storage.
✦Part V: Networks and Communications (Chapters 11–15) — Part V
looks at networking, both LANs and the Internet. You’ll learn the
ways your PC communicates and how networks of computers work,
and understand how to set up wireless networks that give you ﬂexi-
bility while protecting your security.
✦Part VI: Multimedia and Peripherals (Chapters 16–20) — Part VI
covers one of the best outcomes from the amazing performance and
capacity you’ll get in even the least capable PC being made today,
which is what you can now do with sound, pictures, and video.
✦Part VII: Integration (Chapters 21–25) — Parts I to VI cover the indi-
vidual technologies and components surrounding your PC. In Part
VII, you’ll read about what’s involved in integrating those together,
including cases and power supplies, mobile computing, unusual
applications, diagnosis, and repair. With all that in hand, you’ll see
how to build your own quiet, very high performance PC.
You’ll ﬁnd a lot of black and white drawings and photographs throughout the
book. In addition, we’ve printed key photos in color toward the back of the
book so you’ll be sure to see what you need to.
Although later chapters do build on earlier ones, you don’t have to read the
book in sequence from cover to cover — you can dive into the parts that most
interest you. If you ﬁnd you’re not understanding what’s there, go back to the
relevant earlier chapters.
Navigating Through This Book
Every chapter in this book opens with a quick look at what’s in the chapter
and closes with a summary of the most important points in the chapter. You’ll
ﬁnd icons in the margins of the text to draw your attention to speciﬁc topics
and items of interest. Here is what the icons mean:
The Caution icon points out a common problem you’ll want to know about,
along with suggestions for what to do to avoid or ﬁx the problem.
The Cross-Reference icon indicates references to more information or more
detailed discussion elsewhere in the book.
The Note icon points out additional important information or an insight
related to the topic at hand.
The Tip icon highlights things you’ll want to do to make sure you get the
most out of your computer.
Preface xi

One further informational point: Throughout the book, we talk about both bits
and bytes (a byte is 8 bits), and about thousands, millions, and billions of
those. We use the notation in Table P-1 consistently. Lowercase b stands for
“bits,” and uppercase B stands for “bytes.”

in the next edition.
About the Fourth (Desktop) Edition
We’ve slimmed down this version of the PC Upgrade and Repair Bible to a
smaller, less expensive book, targeting it speciﬁcally at home, home-ofﬁce, and
small-ofﬁce users. What we eliminated was speciﬁcally the topics useful only in
large companies, along with some of the speciﬁc product photos and speciﬁca-
tions. What’s left is what you need to work with the current generation of tech-
nology and systems, to upgrade and repair them as necessary, or to make the
decision to replace a PC with a more suitable system. In these pages, we give
you the essentials of PC upgrade and repair.
When we wrote the ﬁrst edition of the PC Upgrade and Repair Bible, many people
were still running computers based on the Intel 486 processor, and upgrades to
those systems were an important topic. When we wrote the PC Upgrade and
Repair Bible, Professional Edition, the Pentium and Pentium Pro were thoroughly
entrenched; the Intel Pentium II and AMD K6 were just starting to penetrate the
market. The third edition saw the obsolescence of the Intel Pentium and its pred-
ecessors, as the Pentium II and K6-2 processors owned the industry.
The lifetime of products in the personal computer industry is often as short as
six months, so four years after the third edition, everything has changed once
again. The Intel Pentium 4 and AMD Athlon processors own the market, RAM-
BUS memory had its day and has been eclipsed by faster, less expensive prod-
ucts, Windows 9X is history, and Linux is important enough to be the subject
of questionable lawsuits about its ownership.
Still, our overall goal remains unchanged: to give you an understanding of what
the best of the industry has to offer and how to exploit it.

omputers are indispensable for much of the work
and play people do. After years of stagnation dur-
ing which people focused on ofﬁce automation and busi-
ness applications and asked where the value was in the
ever faster parade of new systems, PCs have crossed a
price and performance threshold. Systems you can buy
today for hundreds of dollars, not thousands, have the
power to make home movies, store and play your
music, serve as your home darkroom, and enhance a
home theater.
They still do ofﬁce automation, too.
As recently as when we wrote the third edition of this
book, a computer with that kind of power cost thou-
sands of dollars, and most people used a single PC. Four
years later, a PC costing less than $500 can handle
almost everything you might do, and a surprisingly
large number of homes have three or more computers
on a local area network. People’s priorities have shifted
to put stability and capability on par with minimum cost
and maximum value.
You Can Do What You Can
Imagine
Everyone does something different with their computer,
or does similar things in different ways. These differ-
ences lead to different answers to the question of what’s
the best computer for you.
You can start the analysis to answer that question by
thinking about these issues:
✦What do you use the computer for? What pro-
grams do you use, and how?
✦What are the beneﬁts you expect from your
computer? Will achieving those beneﬁts alter
the ways you use the computer?
✦If you upgrade, what will limit the perform-
ance of your computer?

✦If you buy new equipment, how much and what kind of equipment do
you need? What are the options in choosing that equipment? How
are you likely to want to upgrade that equipment in the future, and
what should you do now to make that easier?
✦For both upgrades and new purchases, what are the support and
maintenance requirements, and how can your decisions make getting
support easier when something goes wrong?
✦After you select a hardware conﬁguration, what are the growth
options during the life of the equipment, and what are the beneﬁts
those options can provide? What choices can you make early on to
reduce the cost of future growth?
The following pages expand on each of these questions to explain why they’re
important and how your answers affect your choices.
What do you do with your computer?
Different things you do create different amounts of work for your computer. The
typist using an ancient DOS version of WordPerfect places relatively small
demands on a computer. The host for a network game tournament needs some
memory, a decent processor (also called a central processing unit, or CPU), and
high-speed communications. The game player needs screamingly fast CPU and
video. The publisher assembling books from text, photographs, and graphics
needs it all — lots of memory, a fast CPU, high-resolution video, voluminous stor-
age, and good communications capabilities if ﬁles are transmitted electronically.
How you use your computer determines how great a workload you impose on
it, so we’ll discuss not only what you use the machine for, but also what pro-
grams you use and in what combinations you use them. These factors affect
how powerful a machine you need. For example, suppose you’re still running
the computer you bought in 1998. You might have an old version of Microsoft
Word on a machine with a Pentium II processor clocked at 266 MHz, 16
megabytes (MB) of memory, and a 4 gigabyte (GB) disk. You’re still running
Windows 95 on the machine, but your partner says that you’ll be fantastically
better off with Windows XP and the improved reliability of the more recent
versions of Windows. She convinces you to upgrade your software, but now
you ask “Will I have to upgrade my computer to run that new software?”
With a computer like that, the answer is Yes. You’ll need more memory, more
disk space, and a faster processor. We’ll look at how you can upgrade your
machine, and examine the possibility of replacing the main processor board —
the motherboard — as an alternative to piecemeal upgrades. We’ll also talk
about whether or not upgrading this machine makes sense compared to pur-
chasing a new computer — sometimes it’s far less expensive to get the same
capabilities with a new machine than by upgrading one you have.
We want to caution you to be hardnosed about upgrades because much of the
hype and noise you hear that computers are obsolete six months after you buy
them is driven by the notion that people always need the fastest, latest hard-
ware. That’s absurd. If your computer does what you want the way you want,
nothing forces you to upgrade your hardware or software. You may need
4 Part I ✦Introduction

upgrades to do new things, or to do the same things with new software, but
that’s an explicit choice you get to make.
Which operating system do you want, and why?
Upgrades that let you do more with your computer always seem better than
ones required just to run new versions of the same programs the same way as
before. Upgrades that increase capabilities and productivity create added
value; ones that just maintain existing functionality are little more than a sur-
charge on the cost of the software upgrade.
The hardware upgrades you need also reﬂect the operating system you decide
to run. For example, Windows 2000 and Windows XP are free from the resource
restrictions that plagued Windows 95 through Windows Me. Windows 2000 and
Windows XP can run more programs at the same time than their predecessors.
If you take advantage of this — say by keeping your e-mail, word processing,
and fax software open while you run a corporate order-entry application —
you will use more memory than before. You may also ﬁnd that you need higher
resolution on your display to keep all those windows visible at once. Greater
display resolution may in turn make you want to replace a 14- or 17-inch moni-
tor with a 19-inch one to keep the text legible.
If your computer is on a home or ofﬁce network, you may ﬁnd Windows’
improved capabilities invaluable when handling multiple forms of network
communication. You can work with ﬁle servers, printers, cameras, and other
devices at the same time that you search the Internet for the latest news. You
can let your coworkers pull ﬁles off your disks to combine with their own
work. As easy as this can now be, though, it means your computer is doing
more work. That means memory and processor resources are being used to
service the networking load. If you don’t have enough of those resources,
you’ll need to upgrade to keep working at full speed while these features run
behind the scenes.
Chapter 1 ✦Getting Ready 5
Less Than the Sum of the Parts
We recently decided to upgrade our daughter’s old computer because the old
600 MHz Pentium III in it was too slow to support the programming and other
schoolwork she was doing. We targeted a Pentium 4 at 2.4 GHz or faster, 512MB
or memory or more, and at least 40GB of disk, and we planned to install the
upgrades in her existing case.
Much to our surprise, that’s not how it played out. We check the Dell site now
and then to keep track of what’s new and where current prices are, and stum-
bled across a conﬁguration that was both signiﬁcantly faster than what we’d
planned and — including shipping — was about a hundred dollars less than we
would have paid for upgrades. That deal went away in a matter of days, but not
before we snapped one up. We couldn’t buy the upgrade parts for the same
price at which Dell could sell and ship the complete machine. It doesn’t happen
often, but it’s worth remembering.

If you’re deploying an Internet server, you’ll want to choose between Unix and
Windows NT. Both can host a full suite of services, but you’ll have to choose
among a wide range of choices that affect the hardware you need, the available
support, and the cost of software.
Gaining an understanding of your hardware requirements begins by estimating
the basic hardware you need to maintain your current capability. This book
shows you how to make those estimates and how to achieve a complete
understanding of your growth options.
Should you upgrade your computer?
The starting point for upgrades is always the existing computer. We’ll discuss
how to characterize the performance you can expect from that machine and
how to identify the components that limit the performance of your applica-
tions. Knowing that will let you predict if the machine’s performance needs to
be improved. You’ll see how to identify the “choke points” that limit perform-
ance, how to eliminate them, and how to decide which upgrade options make
sense. You’ll learn how to identify when it’s better to replace the entire com-
puter than to make incremental upgrades.
For example, suppose your company’s standard user workstation is a Pentium
III processor running at 933 MHz, hosting Windows 2000 in 256MB of memory.
You’ve been using desktop videoconferencing to talk to your children at col-
lege, but the video quality isn’t very good. Can you afford to ﬁx this? Perhaps.
You might need faster communications, might need more memory, or might
simply need to drop in a faster video card.
Or, suppose you have a Celeron 1 GHz processor with 128MB of memory, and
you want to know if you can use it to process photos from your new digital
camera. The analyses you’ll do with this book will show you that you can, but
you’ll want to upgrade memory to 256MB or 512MB, and may need to add disk
space too.
The process of analyzing upgrade options is very much like that of selecting
options to include in a new machine. We’ll look at a wide range of computer
components from the point of view of what each can do for you, examining the
characteristics of each and looking at how those characteristics affect the per-
formance you can expect. We’ll look at relative advertised prices to show the
relative cost of features and performance. The prices you’ll pay for equipment
changes as technology evolves, so we’ll use the comparisons to illustrate the
analysis rather than as the rigid basis for choice.
What new computer should you buy?
Buying a new computer is very much like a 100 percent upgrade of an old com-
puter; in fact, new computers are often bought as replacements for older ones.
Upgrading a machine constrains the choice of components in order to remain
compatible with surviving components, while conﬁguring a new computer
opens up all the technology options. The decision of what to buy is therefore
more complex for new computers, requiring you to weed through more choices.
6 Part I ✦Introduction

For example, suppose you’ve narrowed your selection to two models, one of
which uses what the vendor calls a 533 MHz front side bus and the other of
which offers an 800 MHz front side bus. The 800 MHz bus machine is more
expensive, so you want to know if the extra money is worth it. We’ll give you
the tools to decide by showing you what a front side bus is, why its speed is
important for some processors but not for others, and how to decide which
choice is your best option.
What about support and maintenance?
Whatever your demands on a computer, you’ll want to carefully consider the
support available from the suppliers you choose and the options you have for
maintenance when something fails. Both hardware and software are constantly
changing, and new versions will at times offer dramatically better performance
or brand-new capabilities. Different manufacturers have very different track
records for supporting their products as operating systems and hardware
evolve. Some vendors position their products for speciﬁc markets, and offer
support for some conﬁgurations but not others. We’ll look at what’s required
to support hardware and software fully and examine the issues of manufac-
turer support.
There’s a wide range of utilities speciﬁc to Windows that help automate some
of the critically important periodic maintenance items. We’ll look at what prob-
lems these tools can solve and what you need to do to be ready for disasters
beyond their reach.
What about future upgrades?
Knowing the relative costs and beneﬁts of upgrade options can help you make
new equipment choices that extend the equipment’s operating life. Choosing
technologies and components that allow low-cost, high-payoff upgrades later
requires some thought, but can help you use minor upgrades to put off the
next major upgrade for years. We’ll conﬁgure several sample systems and look
at what the options and costs are for future increased capability.
For example, the Universal Serial Bus (USB) can interface many different types
of equipment to your computer. You can connect disks, CD-ROMs, scanners,
cameras, speakers, and networks to a USB port without adding new cards
inside the computer. If you’ll be hooking in network, modem, videoconferenc-
ing, and sound cards later, saving slots (the places you put cards in a com-
puter) like this can be critical. Choosing whether to upgrade with USB 1.1 or
USB 2.0 becomes an important decision because some applications won’t run
with the older USB 1.1 hardware.
The organization of this book follows the ideas above. We’ll start by discussing
ways to understand how you use your computer and how much work you
make it do. A look at your operating system and what it can do for you helps
you expand your understanding of what you need from your computer. We’ll
take a computer apart after that, looking at all the pieces inside to understand
what they do. We’ll examine the features and characteristics of each element,
Chapter 1 ✦Getting Ready 7

learning to read manufacturers’ descriptions with an eye to making smart deci-
sions. We’ll look at how to decide what components can be upgraded to solve
performance problems, and make comparisons among competing upgrades.
We’ll use the same ideas to decide when a completely new computer is the
right idea. Finally, we’ll look at how to evaluate the growth left in a computer
and how to get the most out of what you have.
Basic Techniques
You have to do a few things right if you’re going to work on computer hard-
ware effectively. Here they are:
✦Control static electricity. You absolutely have to control static elec-
tricity (also called electrostatic discharge, or ESD). Voltages you can’t
see or feel can kill the chips in your computer.
✦Follow careful, well-deﬁned procedures. You get nowhere ripping
hardware or software apart and making random changes hoping
something will work. You have to have a carefully thought-through
sequence in mind. You’ll want to change only one thing at a time
(and test the result) so you can isolate what causes different results.
✦Use the proper tools. We’re as guilty as anyone of using vise grip pli-
ers as a universal tool, but that’s not the right way to go about work-
ing on computer hardware. The parts are relatively small and fragile,
so you must have tools appropriate to the job.
Static electricity
The hundreds of millions of transistors inside the chips in your computer are
fantastically small. Although the small size of the transistors makes the speed
and functionality those chips offer possible, that same small size reduces the
voltage the transistors can withstand. Here’s a typical warning about the maxi-
mum ratings on chips: 
Operating the device beyond the “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause
permanent damage. Exposure to stress beyond the “Operating Conditions”
limits speciﬁed for the device may affect reliability.
Typical signal and power level operating conditions for the largest chips in
new computers are no more than 3 volts, down from the 3.3 volts and 5 volts
used just a few years ago. You can’t feel static electricity at much below 30
volts, and you can easily generate thousands of volts without intending to. The
absolute maximum voltage rating for most chips is 6.5 volts; some are even
less. Because you’re not likely to feel less than 30 volts, you can destroy a chip
without even feeling a tingle. What’s worse is that you can weaken a chip
(priming it to fail a little later), damaging it just short of complete failure.
Ultimately, your feet scufﬁng on the ground, clothes rubbing on you, and a
multitude of other small things can generate the ammunition that kills a chip.
8 Part I ✦Introduction

Here’s the no-compromises plan to prevent static electricity problems:
✦Ground everything, including you. It’s not enough to simply touch a
piece of metal — static electricity can build back up simply from
your moving as you work. The best way to prevent a static electricity
discharge is to not let any charge build up to begin with. Grounding
everything — connecting you, your tools, and the equipment to a
good ground — takes care of this. A proper anti-static workstation
includes not only a grounded workbench, but also a ground mat, a
grounded wrist strap (which fastens securely around your wrist), and
foot straps. Grounds should connect through an unbroken wire to a
secure cold-water ground. (Be sure the pipe into the ground is an
unbroken length of metal, with no plastic sections.) If you’re going all
out, consider grounded tools and a humidiﬁer. Increased water in the
air helps static charges bleed off.
✦Avoid materials that build up static charges. Workbench tops
should be a conductive, anti-static material. Under no circumstances
should you work on a plastic, vinyl, carpeted, cloth-covered, ﬁnished,
or waxed surface. Parts should be stored in plastic bins or bags
made of conductive, anti-static material. Check bins and bags for
extraneous material that could cause static buildup.
✦Floors should be conductive tile. Avoid vinyl, carpet, ﬁnished wood,
sealed or dusty concrete, and ﬂoor wax. You can get carpet spray to
minimize static buildup, but it’s not really the right answer.
You’ll also want to keep static-building material out of your work
area. This includes most plastics, nylon, polyethylene, Styrofoam,
vinyl notebooks, cellophane, and adhesive tape. Clothing often
includes static-building material, so your best bet is to wear a con-
ductive smock.
✦Avoid other people. Onlookers are inevitable, but without their own
anti-static protection, they can destroy in a second what you’ve
worked to protect. Keep people without appropriate anti-static pro-
tection at least 3 feet away from the work area so they can’t touch
anything.
Obviously, you can work in a less protected environment, and realistically, a
work area like that is more than most homes and ofﬁces can afford. Many serv-
ice centers, operations that should take careful precautions, do with less pro-
tection than we’ve recommended above. Simplifying the protections increases
your risk, especially in a dry atmosphere, so we’ll cover what you should do
for sufﬁcient protection with minimum fuss.
Tools
Almost everything you need to do to a personal computer can be done with
just a few simple tools, such as screwdrivers, socket drivers, and pliers. You’ll
need some more-sophisticated tools if you’re making cables. (Of course, if
you’re making cables, you might need to have your head examined. Making
Chapter 1 ✦Getting Ready 9

cables takes lots of time, saves very little money — if any, and may actually
cost more — and is one of the most error-prone assembly jobs there are. If we
had a dollar for every screwed-up cable we’ve had foisted on us. . . .)
✦Screwdrivers — You’ll need both slotted and Phillips screwdrivers.
You’ll want a range of sizes from small to medium.
✦Socket drivers — Many of the screws used in personal computers
have heads that ﬁt hex drivers, which lets you avoid stripped heads
and makes it less likely that you’ll drop the screw where it doesn’t
belong. The most common sizes are 3/16, 7/32, and 1/4 inch. We’ve
seen Torx heads on screws in a few computers, but only rarely.
✦Pliers — The ones we use the most are a pair of very long needle-
nose pliers. They won’t exert much force, but they’ll handle small
parts and get into tight places.
✦Flashlight — You’ll want one of the compact, halogen bulb ﬂashlights
so you can get a lot of light in a small place. One you can make stay
put in small places is even better.
✦Mirror — You can’t always see what you need to directly. A small
mirror on a long handle can solve a lot of problems that otherwise
require you to disassemble more than necessary.
✦Multimeter — Some failures are best diagnosed with a multimeter.
We have a portable one from Heath we bought many years ago, but
you can get multimeters anywhere. You don’t need extreme accuracy
(which is expensive), but you’ll want to look for one that’s durable.
They have a habit of falling off workbenches and other places.
✦Soldering iron — If you know what you’re doing to the point where
you want to be able to repair connectors or remove and replace com-
ponents from circuit cards, you’ll need a soldering iron. Not a solder-
ing gun, and not the sort of iron Grandpa used to make tin cans with.
If you’re working on circuit card components, you want a grounded,
temperature-regulated unit that protects components from overheat-
ing and static electricity. If the cost of one of those seems too high,
think twice about whether you can afford to be without one, and
think three times about why you need to be soldering on a circuit
board at all.
You’ll ﬁnd most of these tools, if not all, in a compact tool kit for PC service.
They’re sold by a lot of companies. You don’t need the super-spiffy giant size.
Look for good quality tools, however — junk is too frustrating to bother with.
As important as these tools are, the most important tools you’ll have are your
eyes and ears, and some programs you’ll keep on disk. You provide the eyes
and ears; we’ll cover some of the programs later in the book.

our computer has about a dozen components you
need to consider, including the processor, mem-
ory, at least three buses, power supply, case, hard disk,
optical drive, display, network, modem, sound, and
printer. (Don’t panic — we’ll explain what each of those
is in later chapters.) Each of these components has a
handful of deﬁning characteristics, with each character-
istic having a range of choices. The result is hundreds
of possibilities for conﬁguring your computer, and a lot
of confusion for novices trying to ﬁgure out how to
upgrade or what to buy.
The performance you can get for each of those compo-
nents increases constantly, while the price of any given
performance level decreases at the same time and the
technology changes at a breathtaking rate. In the fall of
1995, for instance, a 133 MHz Intel Pentium was a very
fast processor for desktop computers. In spring of 1999,
a top-end processor was a 450 MHz Intel Pentium II. In
summer of 2003, the top-end processor was a 3.2 GHz
Intel Pentium 4. The MHz (megahertz) unit means mil-
lions of clock ticks per second, and GHz (gigahertz)
means billions of clock ticks per second, so, ignoring
the signiﬁcant internal changes between those proces-
sors, there’s been a phenomenal increase in the rate at
which they work. Figure 2-1 compares the clock rates
for these three processors, normalizing the rate against
that of the 133 MHz Pentium. The relative clock rate of
the Pentium is 1; the Pentium II is over 3 times faster
than the Pentium, and the Pentium 4 is over 24 times
faster.

Figure 2-1: Processor clock speed increases
The dashed trend line in Figure 2-1 emphasizes the fact that speed increases
aren’t constant. The rate at which computer speed increases is itself increasing —
something that will continue for years to come.
The underlying engine powering improvements in all electronic devices is
Gordon Moore’s empirical observation, validated over more than 30 years, that
the number of transistors in the highest density chips will double every couple
of years. The nearly straight line on the logarithmic plot in Figure 2-2 shows
how closely the prediction has come true.

accurately, including current-generation systems, and so is a reasonable esti-

Not everyone needs the fastest computer available, and the consequence of
the constant increases in top-end performance is that the low end of the mar-
ket ratchets up, too. That causes computer prices to fall for a machine of con-
stant features and performance; the least capable new PC you can buy now is
nevertheless capable of a great many things. (For example, at the same time
we drew Figure 2-1, the slowest desktop processor we found on the Dell Web
site was a 2.2 GHz Intel Celeron, which in Figure 2-1 would plot at over 16 times
the clock rate of the 133 MHz Pentium.) The power of even the slowest com-
puters now being sold, and of computers sold in the last few years, is so great
that they can do most of what people do with computers — word processing,
spreadsheets, e-mail, and simple photos. Because they’re so capable, it’s
important that you don’t overvalue change in computer technology. If the
machine you have does what you want, you can expect to use it until your
needs change, or until added features in new versions of your software are
compelling enough to make you upgrade to a version that no longer runs well
on your machine. When you become dissatisﬁed with the machine you have,
you’ll do the necessary upgrades and keep on working.
Chapter 2 ✦Why Isn’t the Same Computer Right for Everyone? 15

If you haven’t already, you’ll soon ﬁnd that different people hold very dif-
ferent opinions on what constitutes good computer hardware and on what
should be in a computer, holding those opinions with an intensity that eas-
ily approaches that of religious wars. We’re not as radical as that suggests,
but a number of our opinions are in this book. Most of our opinions are
based on the idea of computer upgrade and repair by mystic incantation —
that is, remember what worked well for you in the past and, unless you
have a good reason not to, keep doing it.
For example, we’re partial to certain products from Intel, Crucial, Seagate,
Kodak, and a number of other companies. Conversely, we won’t buy anything
made by some other manufacturers because we know from both experience
and insight into their operations that their products are bug-ridden and not
likely to get better soon. The end result of focusing on quality and weeding out
the garbage has been that we spend less time ﬁxing our computers than some
otherwise very competent people we know.
We suggest that you adopt the same approach — when you identify a quality
manufacturer, stick with them. If it becomes clear to you that a manufacturer’s
products are not well engineered and manufactured, shun them. Do this for
complete systems you buy as well as for upgrades.
Buying into a Moving Target
The wide range of possible options for conﬁguring computers is one reason
manufacturers offer preconﬁgured systems — standard system packages meet
the needs of most customers, and serve as a baseline the sales staff (or Web
site) can use to focus on the needs of customers with unique requirements.
How you use a computer and what you do with it, as well as what combina-
tions of technology make sense, will determine the choices you make. For
example:
✦A great machine for gamers would combine high-end video with a
fast processor and lots of memory.
✦A good conﬁguration for economy word processing would combine a
low-end machine with a midrange-capacity disk, a sharp monitor, and
a good quality ink jet printer.
Depending on your objectives, high-end performance may not require the most
expensive equipment. For example, 3D accelerated video cards can provide
blazing frame-update rates (the speed at which the game can update the
screen), but by avoiding the latest high-end versions, you can get good per-
formance at midrange cost.
Table 2-2 shows a range of complete, new desktop systems representative of
what you could buy in the spring of 2004. If the computer industry continues
at its current rate, the table will be obsolete before the next edition of this
16 Part I ✦Introduction

book can be published. Laptop and handheld computers present a whole other
set of issues that we’ll talk about later. Our strategy for categorizing the
columns in Table 2-2 is to examine what’s in new computers selling for under
$500 (low-end), approximately $1,000 (midrange), and $2,500 (high-end) or
more. We’ve indicated our minimum recommendations in boldface. The low-
end category in the table is above the minimum conﬁguration required to run
Windows and Linux. The features shown in the midrange and high-end
columns are representative of what you will want if you’re working with photos
or video, or if you’re playing games. Any speciﬁc system conﬁguration is likely
to have components from all three columns.

Although it’s the term used by manufacturers, the term low-end at the top of
the second column in Table 2-2 is incredibly misleading. A machine with a 2.5
GHz Celeron processor, 128MB of memory, a 17-inch monitor, and a 40GB disk
is classed as a low-end machine, but is terriﬁc for signiﬁcant word processing
and spreadsheets, and even for some games. You can buy a system like that,
with monitor, for around $500. It’s quick, if not fast, and very capable. To give
you an idea of how capable, consider that we chose to write this entire book
on a lesser machine, one with a 933 MHz Intel Pentium III, 512MB memory, and
80GB of disk. We didn’t give up anything important with that choice; a machine
with those speciﬁcations really can do a lot.
It’s because some conﬁgurations ﬁt certain applications better than others that
we chose the Pentium III computer over another PC we have, one with a 2.53
GHz Pentium 4, 512MB memory, and 60GB disk. The Pentium III machine has
two very large monitors — 21 and 19 inches — each running at 1600×1200 reso-
lution, versus a single 21-inch monitor on the Pentium 4. The additional screen
space on the second monitor makes it possible to put reference material and
calculations on one screen while keeping the chapter we’re writing visible on
the other. Working that way with two screens is far more efﬁcient for us
because the dual screen conﬁguration eliminates ﬂopping between programs.
Don’t infer, however, that ancient computers are just as useful as new ones,
because the minimum useful machine speciﬁcations do creep up over years.
That obsolescence happens both because new hardware doesn’t support the
older interfaces and because new, more powerful software runs too slowly
without increases in computing power. The machine on which we originally
started writing books was a 50 MHz Intel 486 with 16MB memory, 2GB disk
space, 1280×1024 resolution display on a 17-inch monitor, modem, and scan-
ner. You can’t load current versions of Windows on that machine anymore,
much less run a current-day word processor, causing more than a few people
to pine for the slimmer, more compact designs of yore, and ooze disdain for
modern bloated software. Our view is that the payoffs we realize from the
18 Part I ✦Introduction

newer machines, such as being able to keep our e-mail program open while we
write, access ﬁles on our ﬁle server and on Internet servers maintained by our
publisher, and compress an edited video stream to DVD in the background
while we work, is an enormous gain in productivity, one easily worth the few
hundred dollars the newer machine costs now. We used to have to mail chap-
ter text and drawings to the publisher; the advent of broadband networks and
more-capable software lets us now do all our work through the Internet. We get
work done faster, and with less effort.
You will make your own choices about your computer conﬁguration based on
your situation. A cramped ofﬁce or kitchen counter offers little room for a full-
size case. A two-machine network isolated from the Internet is simple to set up
with cables, while a wireless network lets you sit out on the deck while you
work and remain connected to both your other computers and the Internet.
Conﬁguring a machine to your exact speciﬁcations requires detailed research
and understanding; buying a prepackaged conﬁguration lets you choose based
on top-level parameters. Integrating a machine yourself lets you pick the exact
components it will contain; buying from a major vendor makes onsite service
available. Buying a complete machine from a vendor eliminates the headaches
of putting it together yourself.
Choosing an Operating System
Counting both systems and versions, you have many operating systems to
choose from. If you’re planning to run Microsoft Windows, you have to choose
which version, a choice with signiﬁcant technical and performance implica-
tions. If you’re planning to run Linux on your PC, you still have to choose
which distribution (essentially, which company’s enhancements to and packag-
ing of the standard Linux) and which version of that distribution. Linux isn’t
yet suitable for a beginner who doesn’t have a captive expert nearby, but it’s
made great strides in the last few years, and the day when a beginner can suc-
ceed unaided with Linux isn’t far off.
Windows
There are two technically distinct Windows architectures. One — what we’ll
call Win9X in this book — originated with Windows 95, a successor to
Windows 3.1 and ultimately DOS, and inherited both compatibility beneﬁts and
reliability problems from its parents. The other architecture originated with
Windows NT, and is available today as Windows 2000 or Windows XP. Windows
2000 and Windows XP are the most reliable versions of Windows, but are not
necessarily compatible with all the software and hardware built for Win9X.
Practically, however, there are only three useful versions of Windows: Windows
98 Second Edition (Win98 SE), Windows 2000, or Windows XP. No version of
Windows prior to Windows 98 Second Edition (Win98 SE) is more stable, and
SE includes Universal Serial Bus (USB) support without additional patching.
Windows Millennium Edition came after Win98 SE, but introduced many relia-
bility problems.
Chapter 2 ✦Why Isn’t the Same Computer Right for Everyone? 19

Our bias is to run Windows 2000. Windows XP is technically superior to
Windows 2000 and offers some very nice added features, but we prefer not to
deal with Microsoft’s Windows Product Activation (WPA). We properly license
every copy of all the software we run — it’s the right thing to do, and intellec-
tual property is what keeps authors fed — but there are enough documented
cases of WPA failing and shutting down properly licensed machines that we
choose not to deal with it. The machines we do work on run Windows 2000.
However, choosing between Windows XP and Windows 2000 is far less signiﬁ-
cant than choosing one of them over Win9X. Win9X is far less secure, and its
fundamental design creates inherent stability problems. Windows XP and
Windows 2000 are more secure, more robust, and more stable than any version
of Win9X can ever be. Unless you must run software that operates only under
Windows 98, you should use Windows XP or Windows 2000. Most software that
runs under Windows 98 will run under Windows XP or Windows 2000, even if
not explicitly labeled and supported by the manufacturer. If you can, try the
software to see. The most common limitation preventing you from using soft-
ware on the newer operating systems is hardware the manufacturer supports
only for Windows 98, in which case you might be stuck.
Linux and UNIX
The many varieties of UNIX are mostly used to run servers, computers used to
perform tasks remotely for you across a network. Of the nonproprietary ver-
sions of UNIX, the two best known are Linux and FreeBSD. Both are available
from a variety of companies; we use the Linux versions from Red Hat or
Mandrake, and the FreeBSD version from FreeBSD Mall (formerly Walnut Creek
CD-ROM). Linux is the most widely used version, but all versions of UNIX are
less common than Windows on desktop computers because of these factors:
✦Limited device support — Device drivers are not as widely available
for UNIX as for Windows. Manufacturers usually write Windows driv-
ers for new hardware ﬁrst and may never write drivers for any ver-
sion of UNIX. Independent programmers are typically left to write
those drivers, often without support from the hardware developer.
✦Relatively complex administration — Installing and conﬁguring
UNIX is more of a manual process than that for Windows, requiring
more knowledge of the operating system’s internal design. Users
without support from knowledgeable system administrators may not
be able to make the system do everything they want without invest-
ing a lot of time and effort. Linux developers in particular have
invested a great deal of effort in simplifying system administration in
recent years, but the task remains harder than it is for Windows.
✦Limited training — Windows has been the dominant operating sys-
tem for so long that nearly all computer users know something about
how to use it. Until recently, versions of UNIX — although similar in
some ways to Windows — were different enough that untrained users
would not be successful using the operating system. Realizing that
massive retraining is unlikely, Linux developers have attacked that
20 Part I ✦Introduction

problem by leveraging Windows know-how, writing software to make
Linux system administration tools and application programs more
like their Windows equivalents.
The UNIX community is investing a lot of effort into improving the tools for
managing and conﬁguring systems, to the point where it’s possible that within
a few years a naïve computer user will have the ability to successfully choose
UNIX instead of Windows or Macintosh.
What You Need to Run Windows
One of the most frequently asked questions about Windows is “What are the
minimum machine requirements?” As shown in Table 2-3, Microsoft says you
need a fairly minimal machine for Windows 98.
Table 2-3
Stated Minimum Requirements for Windows 98

Intel 486DX processor or better
16MB of memory, with more recommended to improve performance

Windows 2000 has larger stated requirements, shown in Table 2-4.

The requirements in Table 2-4 are for Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional.
Windows 2000 Server minimum requirements increase the minimum memory
and free disk space. Microsoft also states that system requirements for
Windows-based programs may exceed the Windows system requirements
themselves.
Table 2-5 shows the stated minimum requirements for Windows XP.

CD-ROM or DVD optical drive
Keyboard and mouse
In reality, the stated requirements are very low and, perversely, are more
suited for PCs running Linux. Windows will install and run minimally with
these resources, but unless you’re an extremely patient person, the perform-
ance will be unacceptably slow. Many of the features that would make you
want Windows in the ﬁrst place — great networking, multitasking, and multi-
media, for example — require additional resources. And, as Microsoft notes,
any major application you would want to run requires yet more resources.
You’ll see later in the book that the realistic minimum computer you need
really depends on what you want to do with the computer. Before that, though,
look at each of Microsoft’s recommendations.
✦Processor — Microsoft states that Windows 98 requires at least an
Intel 486, while Windows 2000 and XP require Pentium-class proces-
sors. Considering that processors as slow as the 233 MHz Pentium II
were introduced in 1997 and made obsolete by the Pentium III in
1999, the computers you’re likely to work with will be far faster than
the minimums.
✦Memory — As Microsoft notes, the minimum memory requirement is
for Windows by itself. Table 2-6 shows the minimum available mem-
ory required for a number of Windows programs under Windows XP.

If anything, the numbers shown in Table 2-6 are low and count only the
memory required by the application, not by other programs and not
by Windows itself. In practical terms, you’ll want more than the mini-
mum stated memory requirement. Our general total installed memory
recommendations are shown in Table 2-7. Speciﬁc applications can
increase these numbers (for example, the Windows 2000 machine we
use for image editing with Adobe Photoshop has 512MB; the Windows
XP machine you see how to build in Chapter 25 has 1GB).

The numbers in Table 2-7 incorporate the observations that memory
is incredibly cheap and that more memory drastically improves per-
formance on many systems. 
✦Hard Disk — The performance and size of the disk in your computer
are critical. If you’re still running drives smaller than 10GB, they’re
probably full, causing you to have to juggle what you store and what
you delete. If so, replace those disks because larger, faster disks are
low cost, and it’s not worth the time to agonize over what you can
afford to delete. Your Windows folder alone can be huge — the folder
holding Windows 2000 on the Pentium III PC we write on is 1.42GB.
Application software has grown in size, too. Our installation of
Microsoft Ofﬁce 2000 Professional plus Visio 2000 is 400MB, and
doesn’t include all the options.
If you upgrade a desktop computer, 40GB is the smallest disk you
should consider, and then only for cost-constrained situations. In the
summer of 2003, Seagate Technology offered only one drive as small
as 10GB. Half of the models they offer are 40GB or larger. The ready
availability and relatively low cost of large, high-performance drives
makes it impractical to waste time ﬁghting a too-small disk.
Table 2-8 shows, based on program size alone, why it’s so easy to
consume enormous amounts of disk space, listing the available disk
space requirements for the same programs listed in Table 2-6.

✦Display — Windows runs at either 640×480 or 800×600 resolution
with a basic Video Graphics Array (VGA) display adapter, although
640×480 is not supported beginning with Windows XP. No accelera-
tion is necessary to get instantaneous screen updates at those reso-
lutions unless you are playing 3D video games or doing real-time
video editing. You can work with a 14-inch monitor at 640×480 resolu-
tion, but you’ll be more productive with a bigger one. We don’t rec-
ommend anything smaller than a 17-inch monitor now, and suggest
19- or 21-inch units or LCD ﬂat panels, if possible.
Support and Maintenance Service
Computers break and have problems, so one way or another you’ll want sup-
port and maintenance service. If you have the know-how and the time (and
have that time no matter when things go wrong!), you may want to consider
doing support yourself or within your company; otherwise, you need to con-
sider where and how you get service and support.
✦The original manufacturer of your hardware may offer service and sup-
port. Most manufacturers will refer you to the software publisher for
support on programs you installed yourself. They may also decline to
support hardware additions to the machine you make yourself. This is
particularly true for the large nationwide computer manufacturers.
Chapter 2 ✦Why Isn’t the Same Computer Right for Everyone? 25

✦Many nationwide vendors offer you the choice of doing repairs your-
self according to their instructions (with component exchange by
mail), opting for mail-in repairs, or having onsite repairs performed.
Local stores generally offer a choice of walk-in or onsite repair.
✦Third-party repair companies ﬂourished and then died out in the
mid-eighties. The industry trend of outsourcing support operations
has once again created third-party companies that, if your business
or need is big enough for them to care, will contract with you for
service and support operations.
✦Many people have friends with good computer experience. If your
friends are sufﬁciently experienced, and are willing, they may be able
to do upgrades and repairs for you.
What you support yourself and what you support with outside help isn’t an all-
or-nothing decision. Many companies do in-house computer upgrades, leaving
repairs to others. Choosing your approach for maintenance and support need
not be a complex process — ﬁgure out what your choices are, weigh those
choices by your past experience and any current information you can get, and
pick. Don’t forget to account for the value of faster service (whether it’s in-
house or outside).
Summary
✦No matter what computer you buy, there’s a faster one coming soon.
✦The fastest computer might not be the one you need — you need the
one that does your work well at a price that ﬁts what you want to
invest.
✦The minimum requirements Microsoft states for Windows are unreal-
istically low.
✦Virtually any computer still running meets the minimum require-
ments for Windows and UNIX, but you may need more speed for spe-
ciﬁc applications.
✦You’ll end up wanting at least 20GB or more of hard disk space, and
probably much more.

PC Overview

our computer looks like a box accompanied by a
screen, keyboard, and mouse, but there’s a lot
hidden inside that box. You choose many components
located in the box when you buy a new computer, but
too many people do so based on speciﬁcations without
understanding what those components are and what
the speciﬁcations mean. This chapter is a tour of your
PC with the covers off, identifying the components
inside, what they do, and what their important charac-
teristics are.
What’s Inside Your
Computer?
Figure 3-1 shows the inside of a typical computer, and
identiﬁes each of the core components: processor, mem-
ory, bus, input/output (I/O), disk, display, and power
supply. The minimum set of components you need to
run instructions is a processor supported by memory
and a power supply. A power supply is necessary to
make the electronics work at all; the memory holds
instructions and data while the processor works execut-
ing instructions. The chassis holds all the components
together, protects them from damage, and provides
shielding to prevent interference with radios, televi-
sions, and other electronic devices.

A computer with nothing but a processor, memory, and power supply isn’t
very useful because it can’t communicate with you or with other computers.
Each of the other core components exist to either store information or let the
processor communicate:
✦Bus — Connects the processor to the memory, I/O channels, and 
display
✦I/O channels — Connects the bus (and therefore the processor) to
the disk, keyboard, mouse, network, and any other devices
✦Disk — Stores large amounts of information, retaining that informa-
tion even when the power is off
✦Display — Draws images and characters on a monitor, giving pro-
grams a way to output in a way you can read

28 Part I ✦Introduction

These components connect together through the bus as shown in Figure 3-2.
The bus stars out from the processor to everything else because all the infor-
mation ﬂows between the processor and the other components. The operation
of the components in your computer is very repetitive: the processor grabs an
instruction from memory, and decides what the instruction says to do. Based
on what the instruction requires, the processor grabs more information from
memory or disk, operates on it if ordered to by the instruction, and then
stores the data back in memory, on disk, or in the display card. The processor
does this basic cycle billions of times every second it’s turned on. Little
besides turning the computer off stops the repetitive sequence.
Figure 3-2: A computer consists of a processor plus components 
to store and communicate information.
A special signal inside the computer, called the clock signal (or just the clock),
synchronizes components in the computer, providing the cadence to which the
entire assembly marches. The clock times every action by the processor and
sets the synchronization requirements for all the other components. Every
instruction executed by the processor starts on the beginning of a clock cycle
and lasts for one or more clock cycles.

Processors and instructions
Figure 3-3 shows what a processor looks like, while Figure 3-4 shows what the
chip inside the package looks like.

When programs run, their instructions are stored in memory. An instruction
execution cycle starts when the processor reads the next instruction from
memory. The memory receives the read command over the bus and then one
or more clock cycles later returns the requested instruction back across the
bus to the processor. The processor decodes the instruction and decides what
has to be done to carry it out. If the instruction requires an operand from
memory, the processor calculates the address of the operand and commands
the memory to fetch the operand. The processor completes gathering the nec-
essary data after some number of clock cycles, computes the result, and if nec-
essary stores it back to memory, disk, or the display.
The length of each instruction execution cycle determines the performance of
the computer. If a computer running at a clock speed of 4 GHz can complete an
instruction every clock cycle (including reading the instruction and data, com-
puting the result, and storing back to memory), it will execute 4 billion instruc-
tions per second. If the average instruction takes two clock cycles, it will
execute 2 billion instructions per second, and no more. Each instruction oper-
ates on one or more pieces of information, the operands of the instruction. An
instruction might add or compare two numbers or might search a set of num-
bers for a speciﬁc value.
Executing instructions is the work the processor does. The tasks the processor
carries out — tracking actions you take with the keyboard, joystick, or mouse;
rendering and presenting the graphics on the display; moving information from
disk to memory and back; communicating with your network; running your
desktop accessories; or keeping the current print job going — each require
some number of instructions to complete. The number of instructions required
divided by the number of instructions per second determines how long each
task takes.
30 Part I ✦Introduction

Figure 3-4: The chip inside an Intel Pentium 4 processor

The actual number of instructions the processor executes per second is deter-
mined by a lot of factors, including:
✦How big the instruction is in memory, which in turn determines how
many clock cycles it takes for the memory to deliver the instruction
to the processor. Not all instructions are the same size.
✦How many operands the instruction has, and where they are located.
✦How long it takes the memory or I/O channel (and therefore the disk)
to deliver those operands to the processor.
Chapter 3 ✦PC Overview 31

✦How long the processor actually takes to manipulate the operands
and complete the instruction.
✦How long it takes to put the result where it belongs.
Adding the time each of a program’s instructions takes then tells us how long
the program takes to run, which is a measure of performance.
Buses
Buses are wires that computer chips operate according to an agreement (called
a protocol) for how every chip connected to the bus must behave. A bus con-
nects the processor to each of the other components, but there are other
buses elsewhere in your PC.
The bus wires themselves carry signals among the chips, communicating what
the other component should do, an address for where within the component the
function should be carried out, and the information being transferred. Because
bus cycles move information from one place to another, there are always two
players in every bus cycle, and the cycle itself is very much like a conversation.
Let’s listen in on one conversation between your processor and memory:
Processor: Memory, I’d like the number at address 77349.
(Pause while the memory works.) * * *
Memory: Here it is. The number stored there was 42.
That conversation represents the processor reading memory. The processor
can also write to memory, which involves a conversation like this:
Processor: Memory, store a number at address 77349.
Processor: Memory, the number to store is 100250.
(Pause while the memory works.) * * *
The memory is silent throughout that last conversation, never replying that it
has actually received the information and completed its work. The buses in
PCs rely on the assumption that the source will get the data there in time. If
not, the destination picks up garbage. Your computer crashes at best, but at
worst silently corrupts some calculation or stored value.
There are several distinct buses inside your PC, not just one, each designed for
a particular purpose:
✦Front side bus — The front side bus (FSB) connects the processor to
a chipset, one or two chips responsible for joining all the different
buses together. The two major processor manufacturers, Intel and
AMD, each use a different design for the FSB. Because of that, you
can’t directly plug an Intel chip into an AMD socket, and vice versa.
✦Memory bus — The memory bus connects the chipset to the mem-

implement the expansion bus, but within a few years, the newer PCI
Express bus will replace PCI.

Memory
PC memory comes mounted on printed wiring modules, as shown in Figure 3-6.

If you’ve ever seen one of the old pigeonhole desks with rows of compart-
ments to sort letters into, you’ve got a picture of how memory is organized in
your computer. Figure 3-7 shows the idea — a memory in a PC is a collection of
places to store numbers, each with its own unique address. Although every-
thing stored in memory is just a number, the interpretation of each number
depends on the program that owns the information. The number 42 stored in
address 3 in Figure 3-7 could be part of an instruction to the processor, part of
your address on a network, part of your address at home, a count of eggs you
own (meaning that you likely have more than enough in the refrigerator), part
of a bigger number that’s the cost of last night’s pizza, one dot in a drawing,
the character B in “HAPPY BIRTHDAY,” or a lot of other things. Memory loca-
tions don’t care what the meaning of the number they store is, only that the
number needs to be faithfully stored and retrieved on request.
Numbers stored in individual bytes in memory range from 0 to 255 (which is
what can be represented by the 8 bits in each byte). That’s not enough to do
everything you use a computer for. If the computer has to remember that you
have thousands of paper clips in inventory, it has to store that number in at
least two memory locations. Most PC processors are designed to operate on 4
bytes (32 bits) at a time, so programs for those processors store most num-
bers as 32-bit values. If the ﬁrst byte holding your paper clip inventory is at
address 102916, locations 102916 through 102919 hold the entire number. The
same idea is true for instructions, which can require 1, 2, or more bytes to
hold. Any time the processor references the ﬁrst byte of a number or instruc-
tion, it references all of them.
34 Part I ✦Introduction

Figure 3-7: Memory is a bunch of compartments. Each one stores 
a number.
Making the bus wider improves performance because the processor is likely to
read all 4 bytes of a number if it reads any of them. Strings — a group of char-
acters in order, one following another — are common exceptions to storing
information in 32-bit chunks, but because strings are so often at least several
characters long, very little of the effort in retrieving four characters (4 bytes)
at a time goes to waste.
Your PC uses memory modules made from several memory chips. It’s built
that way because memory chips themselves are commonly only a few bits
wide. The memory module operates the individual chips in parallel. The key
parameters deﬁning a memory module are these:
✦Capacity — A memory module holds a speciﬁed number of bytes,
with one address corresponding to each byte. The capacity of a
memory module is the number of bytes it holds.
✦Width — A memory module built from multiple chips in parallel can
be as wide as the module designer wants, with the width being the
number of bits (8 to a byte) that the memory accesses at one time.
Common widths for memory modules used in current computers are
32, 36, 64, and 72 bits, depending on whether or not your computer
checks data transfers from memory for reliability. Don’t confuse the
bit width of memory with the number of pins on the module because
there are also pins for power and control. Common pin counts are 30,
72, and 168.

Memory is a collection of places to
store numbers. Each place, called a
memory location, is one byte. One
memory location stores one value.
That value can be anything in the
range from 0 to 255.
Each memory location stores a
physically different number, although
the same value can be stored in
different locations any number of times.
Every memory location has an  
address, which is a unique number  
assigned to it and no other location.  
When the processor wants to read or  
write the value in a specific location,  
it tells the memory the address of the
location. Addresses usually start at  
zero and continue up from there.
Chapter 3 ✦PC Overview 35

✦Access time — There is a minimum interval the memory requires
from the time it’s told to read a number to the time when the number
is available for the processor to use. Smaller access times mean the
memory is faster and more expensive, but faster memory does not
make your computer run faster. The memory has to be fast enough
to keep up with the processor, but because the clock and the proces-
sor control speed, not the memory, faster memory than the system is
timed for has no value.
✦Cycle time — Another interval, the cycle time, speciﬁes the mini-
mum time from one memory operation to the next. The memory
requires a small delay for it to recover between when it transfers
data on the bus and when it starts the next operation. The cycle time
is the access time plus that small recovery delay.
The volume of information a memory can read and write per second — its
bandwidth — depends on its width, access time, and cycle time. Greater width
and faster times result in greater memory bandwidth. Memory width is rela-
tively easy to come by because all the engineer has to do is put more chips in
parallel. Access time and cycle time can be reduced by building faster chips,
but the cost of the memory goes up dramatically.

36 Part I ✦Introduction

Memory costs 150 to 200 times as much as the equivalent disk capacity, which
is why common memory sizes are 128MB to 1GB, while disks (also called ﬁxed
disks, hard disks, and hard drives) are commonly in the 40 to 250GB range.
This huge difference in size means that you can afford to store far more on
disk than in memory. Disks also have the nice characteristic of remembering
what you wrote to them after you turn off the power. There are computer
memories that can do that, too — the ﬂash memory you ﬁnd in cameras and
MP3 players — but it is signiﬁcantly more expensive than conventional com-
puter memory.
Although disks are inexpensive, they’re far slower than memory. Disk access
times are about 100,000 times slower than memory, far too slow for processors
to use for storing the instructions and data they are working on and still give
you good performance. That’s why your computer uses the disk for storing
programs and data when you’re not using them, but loads them into memory
when you’re actively working with them.
An I/O channel connects your disk (and other attached devices) to the com-
puter’s bus. We’ll use the more common term I/O bus later in the book instead
of I/O channel, but we’ve used I/O channel here to be sure that when we refer
to a bus there’s no confusion between the computer bus and the I/O bus. The
I/O channel receives requests from the processor over the bus, rearranges the
request if it needs to, and hands it off to the disk.
Disk is not only slower than memory, but it’s also harder to talk to. Instead of
having an array of electronic storage locations that are all equally accessible
(as a memory does), the physical construction of a disk has distinct major
structures that let a magnetic head move over a rotating magnetic platter. The
callouts in Figure 3-8 identify the parts inside a typical disk, including the spin-
dle, platters, heads, and positioning arm. The more complex characteristics of
these structures cause a disk to be much more complicated to use.
The disk is built from one or more platters, ﬂat metal or glass plates coated
with a magnetic oxide (like on video tape) that rotate on the spindle. Both
sides of the platter are used. Information is read and written on the platters by
heads, which are mounted on arms. The platters spin under the heads, so for a
given head position each head traces a circle over the platter beneath it. The
heads move together on the arm, so the set of heads traces a cylinder over the
platters. Each circle on one side of a platter under a head is called a track and
is divided into chunks called sectors. The sector is the smallest addressable
unit on the disk, speciﬁed by the combination of cylinder, head, and sector. All
the bytes in one sector get read or written at once.
Although PCs used to transmit the cylinder, head, and sector addresses to disk
drives directly, there were compatibility problems with that approach as disks
grew from the 10MB capacity of the original IBM PC/XT to the monster drives
of today holding 200GB or more. Computers now just send block numbers
(sometimes called sectors numbers), where the block number for a speciﬁc
sector is as follows:
Block number = cylinder number * head number * sector
number
Chapter 3 ✦PC Overview 37

The total capacity of a disk is the number of sectors times the sector size, or
Total size = Total sectors * 512
For example, suppose you have a disk guaranteed to have 234,441,648 sectors.
Multiplying times 512 bytes per sector shows that the disk contains
120,034,123,776 bytes. Disks are sold as if 1 gigabyte contains 1,000,000,000
bytes, so your 120,034,123,776-byte disk is sold as having 120GB capacity. In
Windows, however, 1 gigabyte contains 1,073,741,824 bytes, so in Windows
Explorer the disk is shown with a capacity of 111.79GB.
Aside from its capacity, the important characteristics of a disk all relate to per-
formance. The key disk performance characteristics are:
✦Rotation rate — Rotation rate is the speed at which the disk platters
turn under the heads, measured in revolutions per minute (RPM).
Rotation rates presently run from 5,400 to 15,000 RPM. Faster rota-
tion rates are better because they reduce the access time, and
because they increase the sustained data transfer rate.
✦Access time — Access time is how long it takes from when the
processor requests data from the disk until it’s available. The position
of the heads over the tracks and the current sector under the heads is
likely to be different than the processor requests, with larger differ-
ences causing larger access times because there’s more physical dis-
tance to cross getting to the destination. The variability of access
times means access time speciﬁcations are necessarily averages.
Access times are typically from 14 milliseconds (ms, one thousandth
of a second) down to 8 ms. Smaller access times are better.
✦Sustained transfer rate — The data transfer rate a disk can sustain is
the rate at which the combination of disk and I/O channel can, over a
period of time, maintain a data transfer. The transfer rate is typically
limited to the rate at which sectors sweep under the heads because
that determines how much data can actually be transferred onto or
off of the platters.
The rotation rate is set by the speed of the motor turning the disk. The faster
it turns, the faster sectors ﬂy past the heads. More sectors past the heads
means more bytes, so (assuming the data density is comparable) the sustained
transfer rate for a disk with a higher rotation rate will be higher. A higher rota-
tion rate also means that when the sector your processor wants is not right
under the head at the time of the request, less time will be required before the
sector rotates around to be read. Faster rotation rates, therefore, improve
access times, although head seek times are the major component of access
times. Faster rotation rates are more expensive, partly because the electronics
needed to handle the higher data rates on and off the disk are more expensive.
Access time is primarily determined by the speed with which the arms can
move the heads from one cylinder to another. A head positioning motor moves
the arms back and forth. Lower access times require more power and greater
accuracy from the head positioning motor, increasing its cost.
38 Part I ✦Introduction

Sustained transfer rates of 40MB per second are standard today. Rates of
100MB per second are possible with excellent equipment.
Video cards and monitors
A video card is a memory with some surrounding electronics. Figure 3-9 shows
what’s inside a video card from that point of view. Your monitor requires three
signals, one each for red, green, and blue. These signals are analog signals, like
what goes to the speakers in your stereo, not numbers. The digital-to-analog
(D/A) converters do the work of changing the numbers the processor puts in the
video memory into the signals the monitor needs. Your PC’s processor works
with the video memory and the graphics acceleration processor to put the infor-
mation in the memory that will result in the proper picture on the monitor.
Figure 3-9: All the interesting work in a display card centers around the memory.
If you look very closely at your monitor, you see thousands of tiny dots. Each
one of these dots is called a pixel and is represented by a number in the video
memory. The size of the pixel in video memory, ranging from 1 to 4 bytes,
determines how many different colors the pixel can display. More bytes per
pixel gives you more colors, but also requires more video memory and makes
the processor work harder to move more information into video memory.
Table 3-1 shows the minimum display memory your video board has to have
for many of the video resolutions supported by Windows. The resolution and
number of colors you use directly determine your minimum display memory
size. Video memory is relatively large — the table shows that the maximum

possible memory in the original IBM PC, 640KB or 0.625MB, would be enough
only for video memory in the smallest size, lowest number of colors mode in
the table. If you’ve ever wondered why a graphical operating system like
Windows or Linux with X Windows needs more power to run than DOS, here’s
a clear example how much more resources and work are involved.

Aspect ratio is the ratio of the display width in pixels to the height. The stan-
dard PC aspect ratio is 1.333:1, also expressed as 4:3. HDTV monitors use an
aspect ratio of 1.778, more commonly expressed as 16:9.
As the information to be displayed changes, your processor has to update the
contents of the video memory. How much work the processor does to do the
update is determined by how much video memory it has to update. Updating
every pixel of a display set for 1280×1024 resolution and 8-bit pixels (256 col-
ors) requires that the processor move 1.25MB of data into the display memory.
The processor executes a lot of instructions for every pixel, so in redrawing
the screen it executes hundreds of millions of instructions. If all the data the
processor needs is in memory, and if you’re running a processor capable of bil-
lions of instructions per second, the update is done in between ﬂickers of the
monitor, and you never see it.
40 Part I ✦Introduction

As computer capabilities go up, so do the computing requirements. Updating a
display set for 1600×1200 resolution and 32-bit pixels (about 4.3 billion colors)
requires that the processor move 7.32 MB of data to refresh the screen. That
same processor executing billions of instructions per second may now take
enough time that a slight ﬂicker is noticeable.
Display update performance is critically important to game players, particularly
those playing action games where the screen changes continuously, and 3D
computer-aided-design (CAD) designers doing three-dimensional ﬂy-throughs of
their design. Your eye sees motion on the display because it ﬁlls in the differ-
ences between the successive images (frames) it sees. As long as the frame rate
is high enough, you remain unaware of that process and perceive smooth
motion. If the frame rate gets too low, you become aware of successive frames
and the motion becomes jerky. Video update rates that are too slow give some
people headaches or make them dizzy, and many people complain about ﬂicker
on the screen at update rates of 60 times per second or less. A decade ago,
games used video resolutions of 320×240 at 256 colors to limit the work to
update the screen to what the processor, bus, and video card could achieve and
keep refresh rates up. Game designers today assume fast processors, fast
buses, and hardware acceleration in the video board, making it common to see
games running at 1024×768 or higher in 32-bit color. Table 3-1 shows that a
refresh rate of 70 frames per second at that resolution requires moving 3 × 70 =
210MB per second into the video memory. Not only is that 100 times faster than
the bus in the original IBM PC, it’s 3 times faster than what the PCI bus in every
PC built today can sustain, even though it can go faster for short bursts.
That level of required performance is why designers have created new buses
for video cards and why video cards themselves have onboard accelerators.
Ultimately, the rate at which information ﬂows into the display memory deter-
mines how happy you’ll be with video performance. Technologies that increase
that rate make motion-intensive programs work better and make other graphic
applications snappier, too. The approaches engineers use to get better display
performance include:
✦Get a bigger hammer — Increasing the performance of the path into
the display memory means you get more information in and out. The
highest-performance display cards today are ones using the 8X AGP
bus, which at peak rates can transfer a whopping 2133MB per second.
The 8X AGP standard replaced the 4X (1066MB per second), 2X (533MB
per second), and 1X (266MB per second) versions of AGP, which in turn
replaced the PCI bus (133MB per second peak) for video cards.
✦Delegate — All the performance numbers above assume that the
processor does all the work. For example, when a line has to go from
one place to the other, the processor has to individually draw every
dot that makes up the line into pixels in the video memory. The alter-
native is to put a specialized chip, called an accelerator, on the card
that can be told to do things the processor needs done. Instead of
drawing every pixel in a line, for instance, the processor can simply
tell the accelerator to draw the line. Instead of transferring hundreds
of thousands of bytes to draw all those dots, the processor transfers
a few bytes that give the accelerator the command.
Chapter 3 ✦PC Overview 41

What’s Outside Your Computer?
The key characteristic separating what’s outside your computer from what’s
inside is your need to access the elements outside the case. Components
inside the case don’t provide their own protection from handling, making them
less expensive but more fragile. Components outside the case have their own
cases, making them heavier and more expensive, but durable enough for you
to work with.
The distance separating components outside the computer from the proces-
sor, memory, and internal bus also limits the speed at which external devices
can communicate. The fastest connections inside your PC, those between
processor and memory, are at least 50 times faster than the fastest connec-
tions to the outside, those to an external disk or camcorder. The fastest con-
nections inside the PC can’t be longer than inches; the fastest ones outside the
PC can be several feet long.
Fortunately, most external connections don’t need the highest speeds. No mat-
ter how fast you type, for example, you’ll never type faster than the relatively
slow speeds of your keyboard cable.
Summary
✦The speed at which your computer performs a task depends on the
amount of information the computer has to handle and the rate at
which it can process that information.
✦The core of your computer includes the processor, bus, memory,
disk, video card, and monitor.
✦You can evaluate the performance of each of the core elements by
looking at how much information is handled, and how often.

he ﬁrst step in understanding the performance you
get from a processor and how the processor
relates to the bus and to memory is to look closely at
what the processor does, which is to execute instruc-
tions. Understanding the instruction execution cycle
leads to understanding what engineers have done to
speed up processors and to understanding why you
would choose one processor over another.
Executing Instructions
If you had an assistant who scrupulously carried out
your instructions but had no ability to think independ-
ently, you might give that person tasks by writing out
detailed lists of instructions. Each instruction would
have to be quite simple and would have to completely
specify what you want done. For example, a list of tasks
might include the following instruction:
Pick up the green box and put it on the
top shelf.
The microprocessor in your computer is very much like
this imaginary assistant. It carries out sequences of
instructions — programs — accurately, but without
understanding. Each instruction clearly and precisely
speciﬁes an action the processor is to take, leaving
nothing undeﬁned.
Here’s an instruction that might be executed on an x86-
architecture machine:
c7 05 42 01 15 71 01 00 00 00        mov
a,1

The instruction does a very simple thing — it takes the number 1 and stores it
in a chunk of memory. The portion of the instruction that you or I would be
most likely to understand is the part that says mov a,1. The same instruction
in a form the processor understands (obeying conventions deﬁned by Intel
when they created the 386 processor) is the sequence of numbers c7 05 42
01 15 71 01 00 00 00. Even the c7 value is a number to the computer. It
looks funny because it’s not in base 10; it’s in base 16 (where the digits are 0
through 9 and a through f).
The machine version of the instruction has the same three components as the
readable version, as shown in Table 4-1.
Table 4-1
Machine Instructions to Processors
Machine Version
Readable Version
Description
c7 05
mov
The operation code (opcode) for the
instruction is mov. The mov opcode 
tells the processor to read a chunk of
information from one place and write it
to another. The c7 05 code also tells the
processor that the chunks of information
it should move are 4 bytes long.
42 01 15 71
a
The destination for the move operation
is a location in memory we’ve named 
a. The processor doesn’t know or
understand that name — instead, it
knows that the memory location we
want to store into has the address
42 01 15 71.
01 00 00 00
1
The operand for the move — the value
we want to store in a — is the number 1.
That value is stored directly in the
instruction in the 4 bytes 01 00 00 00.
The processor does a lot of work to execute this simple instruction. Broken
down into the small steps that together store the number 1 into a, here’s what
happens:
1. Fetch the opcode from memory. This happens by telling the mem-
ory the address of the instruction, commanding a read cycle, waiting,
and pulling the memory result off the bus.
2. Examine the result from the memory (c7 05). Upon examination,
the processor decides that it needs to execute a move of a 4-byte
operand to a memory location. It also determines from that value
that the operand will immediately follow the instruction.
46 Part II ✦Processors and Motherboards

3. Ask the memory for the 4 bytes following the instruction (42 01
15 71). After those bytes are returned, the processor sets itself up to
use that value as the address where the result is to be stored.
4. Ask the memory for the 4 bytes (01 00 00 00) following the result
address. The processor stores those bytes in a temporary operand-
holding place inside the processor.
5. Tell the memory to store the operand in the destination. After all
that setup, the intended action ﬁnally happens.
6. Advance the next instruction pointer. The next instruction starts at
the ﬁrst byte past the operand fetched in Step 4. After advancing the
pointer, the processor starts the cycle again.
Done in the most straightforward way, the preceding sequence takes a long
time because the processor is idle while the memory works, and the memory
is idle while the processor works. Early microprocessors, such as the Intel
8088 used in the original IBM PC, operated just this way, but newer designs do
better. Seeing how those newer processors improve execution performance
requires that we look at a slightly more complicated program:
mov  a,1
mov  b,35
This program is almost the same. All we’ve done is to add a second instruction
that stores the value 35 into the memory location named b. The important char-
acteristic of the new program is that all of the steps the processor carries out to
execute the second instruction are independent of what it must do to execute
the ﬁrst instruction. The instructions are so completely independent that the
order in which they are executed makes no difference, which means that a smart
enough processor could choose the order itself. Nor does the processor have to
be constrained to execute one of the instructions ﬁrst — it works out the same if
the processor executes both instructions at the same time.
Overlapping operations, such as by running multiple instructions at the same
time or cycling the memory while the processor works, is at the core of how
processors gain speed beyond simply running at faster rates. The arithmetic-
logic unit (ALU) in the processor does the computational work, adding, sub-
tracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers, and carrying out other operations
required by programs. The bus interface communicates with the rest of the
computer through the bus, fetching and storing information as directed by the
ALU and control sections. The control section decodes instructions and tells
the other sections how to carry out the work each instruction requires.
Processors implementing parallel execution are designed like the drawing in
Figure 4-1. The functions of the processor are implemented by multiple units,
each of which operates independently. Several copies of the most common
units exist to allow multiple operations at the same time. An execution control
unit coordinates the operation of all the units.

current-generation processor
The point of adding all this hardware and complexity is speed. Adding parallel
hardware, increasing the clock rate, and requiring fewer clock cycles to exe-
cute each instruction all contribute to increased speed. In the process, how-
ever, the demands on the bus and memory for increased performance have
increased sharply.
Cache Memory
A Pentium 4 processor clocking at 3.2 GHz (gigahertz, or a billion cycles per
second) starts a clock cycle every 312.5 ps (picoseconds, trillionths of a sec-
ond). The memory technology that provides the hundreds of megabytes of
memory needed to run programs returns values nanoseconds after the proces-
sor makes the request, 10 to 100 times slower than the instruction issue rate.
The ability of the processor to execute so many instructions while waiting for
one value from memory means that, without some help, these screamingly fast
processors will do nothing but spend all their time waiting for data.
PCs do use the fastest memory technology available at a reasonable cost, but
in addition use these ideas to increase the volume of data available to the
processor:
✦Improve the combined interaction of the processor, bus, and mem-
ory. Changing the basic operation of the bus cycle allows the next
memory access to start while the prior one is still wrapping up and
runs the memory and processor in lock step, increasing the effective
rate at which the processor can access the memory.

✦Don’t access the memory so often. Inserting a smaller, faster memory —
a cache memory — between the processor and main memory to
remember what’s stored in memory locations the processor is likely
to need in the future reduces the rate at which the processor wants
memory access.
✦Organize the memory physically to allow parallel operation. You
can build more than one bank of memory, arranging the memory
banks so that they are accessed in rotation. This idea, called inter-
leaving, allows separate values to be returned to the processor at the
speed of the memory divided by the number of banks. For example,
if you have 10 banks of memory that can each be accessed every 100
ns, interleaving can provide a memory access as often as every 10 ns.
Interleaving requires that the order of access to memory — such as
always wanting the next higher address location — be known when
the memory is designed. Addressing the next sequential location is
very common for computer programs, but is not always the case.
When computer scientists look at the behavior of computer programs, they
ﬁnd that programs do not access all of memory equally often. Instead, loca-
tions in memory that the program has accessed recently are far more likely to
be accessed again in the near future. The processor can use a local, cached
copy of those recent instructions, in which case main memory accesses are
needed only the ﬁrst time the instructions are referenced. Much less storage is
required for this local copy than for main memory, and if the local copy is fast
enough, the processor never has to wait for memory.
Designers used to build cache memory from separate static random access
memory (SRAM) chips, but that approach isn’t fast enough any more. Memory
directly inside the processor chip can be made fast enough to keep up with
the processor, though, and the massive increase in number of transistors pos-
sible on the chip has let processor designers put two levels of cache onboard
with the processor:
✦L1 cache — The ﬁrst-level cache memory, internal to the processor,
is called Level 1 (or L1) cache. It is faster than all other memory, but
smaller — typically 8KB or 16KB. It handles very recently used val-
ues, as found in small, tight program loops.
✦L2 cache — The second-level cache memory, also internal to the
processor, is called Level 2 (or L2) cache. It handles values less
recently used than L1 cache.
Some systems use a third level of cache external to the processor. Multiple lev-
els of cache memory reduce the demand on main memory created by the
fastest processors to the point where affordable memories can be used and
record values being written by the processor to memory, delaying writing
them until some later time when the memory is not busy. Cache memory that
delays memory writes is called write-back cache, in contrast with write-through
cache, which simply handles read access but forces the processor to wait
while writes complete.
Chapter 4 ✦Processors, Cache, and Memory 49

Big, Fast Memory
Computer memory chips have a very simple, direct function — they remember
information you write to them and let you read it back later. Giving them a
huge capacity, good speed, and a low price, however, makes memory design so
difﬁcult that the newest chip technology almost always shows up ﬁrst in new
memory designs. All main memory uses dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) technology; the original IBM PC used chips holding 16 kilobits (Kb),
while chips holding a gigabit (Gb) are now available. Changes in the way the
processor and bus control the memory have at the same time increased the
effective speed, although not as dramatically as size has increased. There has
been an exponential growth in memory capacity, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2: Exponential growth in per-chip memory capacity
The inside of a DRAM chip is a square array of storage locations, as shown in
Figure 4-3. The memory breaks the address your processor passes it into two
halves, called a row address and a column address. Together, the two half-
addresses identify one bit in the memory.
The actual memory performance you get in a system results from the combina-
tion of how fast the chip itself responds and how the chip interacts with the
processor and bus. Nearly all PCs now use synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) 
memory. SDRAM technology couples the operation of the memory tightly to
the processor clock, reducing the timing tolerances necessary to coordinate
the operation of the processor and memory and increasing performance.
Enhancements to the basic SDRAM technology include double data rate (DDR)
SDRAM, which transfers two data cycles per clock, and dual channel architec-
tures, which interface two memory banks to the processor in parallel.

Figure 4-3: The memory is a square array inside the chip.
The driver behind these and all the other memory technologies PCs have used
has been the need to provide faster and faster memory access to increasingly
powerful processors. Memory access wasn’t much of a problem for the slow
8088 processors in the original IBM PCs, but as processor width went from 8 to
32 bits (with 64-bit processors now available), and processor speeds went
from 4.77 MHz to 3.2 GHz (with 4 GHz coming), change had to happen. The
inability of any memory technology to survive much more than 5 years has
been a measure of how fast processor design changes.
Motherboard Choices
Because it contains the processor, bus, and memory, the motherboard is the
core of your computer. All the parts of your computer need to be in balance. If
any one component is signiﬁcantly slower than the rest, it can slow down the
entire system, forming what’s called a choke point. Similarly, a component sig-
niﬁcantly faster than the rest of the machine will be restricted by choke points
elsewhere in the system and might not be able to deliver the performance it is
capable of.
The memory breaks apart
the location you ask for into
a column address here,
and a row address here,
together selecting one
location out of the
entire array.

Chapter 4 ✦Processors, Cache, and Memory 51

Dire as that sounds, however, current-generation PC components are typically
so fast that you really need to think through only a few key issues to avoid
choke points in all but the most specialized systems:
✦Processor and front side bus speed — The processor communicates
with memory through a data path called the front side bus (see
Chapters 3 and 5). Faster processors require faster memory access,
and therefore a faster front side bus. The motherboard limits the
maximum front side bus speed (and determines whether you’ll be
using an Intel or AMD processor), so you want to choose a mother-
board with enough room to grow.
✦Amount, type, and conﬁguration of memory — Motherboards have
only so many slots in which to plug memory modules. If you ﬁll
them, adding more memory to the system requires that you remove
some of the memory you bought previously. Faster processors also
beneﬁt from motherboards supporting multiple memory channels
and faster memory technologies.
Some motherboards limit the amount of memory you can install,
even if installing the additional memory is physically possible. Check
the manufacturer speciﬁcations.
✦Adapter card bus type — All PC motherboards built today provide
PCI bus slots, and provide one AGP slot unless the graphics function-
ality is built onto the motherboard. Having no AGP slot means you
can’t upgrade the system’s graphics performance. The PCI Express
bus will replace PCI within several years, but isn’t a factor in the mar-
ket yet.
✦Internal I/O ports — Parallel ATA (AT Attachment, for disk drives)
and ﬂoppy disk controller ports are universal on motherboards.
Some now provide Serial ATA ports.
✦External I/O ports — The Universal Serial Bus (USB, Chapters 5 and
10) is so widely used now that it’s very convenient to have many,
many USB ports built into the system. The PC you’ll see how to build
in Chapter 25 has eight USB 2.0 ports, six in back and two in front,
convenient for temporarily attaching USB ﬂash memory disks and
cameras. IEEE 1394 (FireWire, Chapter 5) is less common, but nice to
have on the front panel if you have a camera using that interface.
Motherboards also commonly offer options for audio and Ethernet.
Both can be added using separate PCI adapter cards.
Given that you make these choices well, most of the other choices you make
conﬁguring a PC are simple and much less expensive to change. Faster video is
a one-card change if you have an AGP slot, but impossible if you don’t. Greater
disk capacity is a plug-in operation if you have a spare port, or requires an
add-in controller if you don’t.
52 Part II ✦Processors and Motherboards

Intel: Celeron and Pentium 4 Processors
Ignoring processors for servers, Intel offers two processor families — the
Pentium 4 and the lower cost Celeron. Both families include lower power
mobile versions for laptop and handheld computers. Processor prices
decrease over time as new, faster ones come into production, so the important
things to keep in mind when you’re deciding what family and speed processor
you should buy are these:
✦You pay a deﬁnite premium for the bragging rights the fastest proces-
sors give you, with the price of newly-introduced high-speed chips
relatively higher than the speed increase would indicate. The Celeron
processors are less expensive than the Pentium 4, but offer some-
what lower performance. Celerons are also less demanding on the
motherboard and memory.
✦You pay a premium to upgrade. Replacing the processor to upgrade
it may require replacing the motherboard and possibly the memory,
and so may be more expensive than just swapping a chip.
Overall, you need to decide how much performance you need and what you’re
willing to pay for it. You’ll use the processor for several years, and you can
expect the demands your software will place on it to go up. Nevertheless, even
the slowest processors now in production may be faster than what you’ll ever
need. What you’re willing to pay should balance the immediate cost against
the length of time the processor will meet your needs.
Pipelining and superscalar execution
Although early transistor radios needed only a few transistors to receive radio
broadcasts, there are tens of millions of transistors in your PC’s processor. The
day isn’t that far off when there will be over 100 million, yet it doesn’t take that
many transistors just to fetch instructions and add numbers. Instead, chip
designers use the additional hardware to make processors faster in several ways.
Superscalar instruction execution is a way to get more work done at once by
having more than one instruction in progress at any one time. The Pentium
and Celeron processors implement superscalar execution using a pipeline in
the chip, which is much like the old ﬁreﬁghter’s bucket brigade. Figure 4-4
shows how pipelining works. When there’s just one unit to do all the work —
the equivalent of the top of the ﬁgure — it takes at least one clock tick to do
each step, and nothing happens in parallel. Firemen get more buckets in
motion with a bucket brigade, splitting the job up into multiple tasks that feed
forward from one to another. That’s what’s going on in the bottom of the
ﬁgure — the pipeline is the equivalent of a bucket brigade, where each row in
the diagram represents a separate, parallel element in the processor. Having
more parallel elements of the processor work on the job gets more work done
every clock tick.
Chapter 4 ✦Processors, Cache, and Memory 53

Figure 4-4: Pipelining for superscalar execution
Each of the units in a processor pipeline is called a pipeline stage. Each stage is
specialized to the work it has to do. The total work the pipeline does is the
same in every PC processor because they execute the same instructions, but
processors with more stages have to do less work in each stage. Pipelines with
stages that each do less work are simpler, which means they can run at higher
clock rates, but take longer to restart (such as when a program takes an unex-
pected jump). Intel’s designers have chosen to use simple, high-speed stages
and long pipelines; AMD’s designers have chosen more complex stages and
slower clock rates (discussed later in this chapter). The choice between the
two is so difﬁcult that, in practice, there’s no good way to know which will be
faster for the programs you run other than to test your software.
Dynamic branch prediction
Programs jump around and loop to accomplish their tasks — they’re not just
straight-line sequences of instructions. For example, suppose the processor
comes across an instruction sequence like this:
1. Load the value of COLOR.
2. Test if COLOR equals GREEN.
3. Store a new value in COLOR.
4. If the old value of COLOR was GREEN, the next instruction is number
1; otherwise, the next instruction is number 5. (An instruction like
this one is called a branch.)
5. (Do whatever comes next. . . .)

No pipelining – do all the work one step at a time (one instruction in five clock cycles)
Pipelining – each stage works in parallel
(complete one instruction every clock cycle)
54 Part II ✦Processors and Motherboards

Pipelining causes processors to load instructions well in advance of the cur-
rent instruction being executed. At the time the processor is doing the work
for instruction number one, for example, the pipeline might be loading instruc-
tion number four. The processor then does the work for instruction number
two and simultaneously wants to fetch the instruction that will follow instruc-
tion number four. Because the processor can’t know which instruction that is
until it executes instruction number four and makes the branch decision, the
pipeline doesn’t know what to do.
Some older processors with very short pipelines solved this problem by doing
nothing, allowing the pipeline to empty until they knew what instruction would
be next. In our example, three cycles would pass with no instructions being
executed (a pipeline stall) while the instruction after number four loads, is
looked at, and gets its operands. Processors with long pipelines lose too much
time during pipeline stalls for this approach to be workable, so instead they
implement a technique called branch prediction. The idea is that the processor
assumes that the next instruction is always the one immediately after the
branch. If this assumption is true, the processor loses no time. If it’s wrong,
the processor stalls for a number of cycles while it loads the right instruction.
A more sophisticated approach to branch prediction, however, is to recognize
that many branches are there to make the code loop, and so will be executed
over and over. This approach suggests that the most likely next instruction the
second time the branch is seen is the instruction that followed the branch last
time. The Pentium and Celeron processors all use this strategy and improve on
it by fetching both the instruction immediately after the branch and the one
that followed the branch the last time through the loop.
Dynamic execution
More than uncertainty, following a branch instruction can cause the processor
pipelines to stall. For example, look at this sequence:
1. Load the value of COLOR.
2. Load the value of SATURATION.
3. Multiply COLOR times SATURATION.
4. Store the multiplication result in COLOR.
The ﬁrst two instructions can be executed in parallel by the pipelines, but the
third instruction has to wait for the ﬁrst two, and the fourth has to wait for the
third. Adding more pipelines or more pipeline stages to the architecture won’t
make this sequence faster because of the dependencies among the instructions
that cause a conventional pipeline to stall, but more sophisticated analysis of
the instruction stream — a technology Intel calls dynamic execution — will.
Figure 4-5 shows how dynamic execution works. Instead of the simpler linear
pipeline structure in the bottom portion of Figure 4-4, dynamic execution uses
a more complex structure centered around an instruction pool. The processor
still executes instructions a pipeline stage at a time, but returns the result to
the execution pool between stages. Stages take the next instruction they can
work on at each clock cycle, even if the instruction taken is out of linear order.
Chapter 4 ✦Processors, Cache, and Memory 55

Being able to work on any instruction that’s ready to go means that the hand-
off between pipeline stages doesn’t have to be in rigid, linear lock step. The
control circuits for the instruction pool ensure that necessary dependencies
between instructions are observed, but otherwise allow for out-of-linear-order
instruction execution.
Figure 4-5: Dynamic execution centers on the instruction pool.
An extended version of the previous example illustrates the advantage of
dynamic execution:
1. Load the value of COLOR.
2. Load the value of SATURATION.
3. Multiply COLOR times SATURATION.
4. Store the multiplication result in COLOR.
5. Load the value of CHANNEL.
6. Add 1 to CHANNEL.
7. Store the updated CHANNEL in SURFCHANNEL.
Even though the instructions at Steps 3 and 4 will stall brieﬂy, the fetch/
decode unit will continue to ﬁll the instruction pool from Steps 5 through 7. At
the point the dispatch execution unit stalls at Step 3, the instruction at Step 5
will be available. The dispatch execution unit picks up that instruction and its
successors and keeps working. No cycles are wasted on pipeline stalls, so your
program runs faster.
Extensions to the instruction set
Some of the most demanding PC applications involve signal processing, such
as full-motion audio/video compression and decompression, speech recogni-
tion, videoconferencing, and image processing. Signal processing algorithms
often have characteristics different than those of more general purpose com-
putations, characteristics a processor can exploit for better performance.

56 Part II ✦Processors and Motherboards

Intel’s ﬁrst extension to the PC instruction set was the MMX technology,
shipped in late 1996. Software for those applications using the new multimedia
extensions (MMX) instructions registered performance gains of from 1.5 to 4
times the performance of a non-MMX processor. MMX provides additional
instructions that give the processor the ability to process parallel streams of
data, such as the values for left and right audio channels, with a single instruc-
tion stream. Combining stereo this way doubles the power of the individual
instruction because handling more data streams (such as red, green, blue, and
intensity for color images) with a single instruction stream gets more work
done per instruction executed. The ability for one instruction to handle sev-
eral data streams is called Single Instruction Multiple Data technology, or
SIMD. The MMX SIMD instructions work on integers only, though, and switch-
ing between ﬂoating point operation and MMX operation is time consuming.
The integer limitation is signiﬁcant, so Intel later added the streaming SIMD
extensions (SSE) and SSE 2, adding ﬂoating point capability similar to what
MMX delivered for integers.
The new instructions do more than handle multiple data ﬂows at once.
Suppose the range of values a program is working on runs from 0 to 255. If the
program scales a number up or down in that range, it’s entirely possible that
the value could go below 0 or above 255, creating what’s called underﬂow or
overﬂow, respectively. If you don’t limit the value to the range 0 through 255,
the results will be wrong. Without MMX or SSE, you’d have to test for
over/underﬂow and do the correction in software, including a time-consuming
jump around the instruction that corrects the error. With MMX or SSE, you just
use the new instructions providing range limited arithmetic. The values get
“clamped” at the extremes, and the program continues on — without a
pipeline stall — as if nothing special had happened.
Hyperthreading and multiprocessors
Building clever, faster processors is not the only way to make a faster
computer — adding multiple processors, called multiprocessing, is a relatively
inexpensive way to get more speed. You don’t need to add more disks or other
peripherals when you add another processor; you just need the additional
processor and its interface on the motherboard. You’ll need UNIX or Windows
NT/2000/XP to support multiprocessing. Windows 9X is exclusively a uniproces-
sor operating system and studiously ignores all those other processors.
The most recent Pentium 4 processors take multiprocessing one step further.
Intel observed that although the massive number of transistors they can now
fabricate in processors lets them build more functional units into the proces-
sor, creating the opportunity for more parallelism, those units are often idle
while other units work. Intel observed, however, that if they let the one proces-
sor look like two to the software, they could exploit the fact that PCs running
Windows or UNIX now run many programs at the same time. Arranging for
multiple programs or multiple threads of execution in the same program to
make use of those idle units, what Intel calls hyperthreading, incurs only a rela-
tively small hardware cost and lets the processor exploit all the work develop-
ers have done supporting multiprocessor systems.
Chapter 4 ✦Processors, Cache, and Memory 57

Expected performance gains
You don’t get two times the performance from a two-processor system, or n
times the performance from an n-processor system. The overhead of coordinat-
ing the operation of multiple processors, limitations on main memory, and limi-
tations on your software’s ability to keep multiple processors busy reduce the
payoff you get. Figure 4-6 shows the idea, although the actual shape of the
curve you get will vary depending on the system implementation and the soft-
ware you run. In all likelihood, you will see performance less than shown in the
ﬁgure. You’ll get much less than shown from hyperthreading, where perform-
ance gains from the added processor are typically in the 10 to 30 percent range.
Figure 4-6: Illustrative performance gain from adding processors
The only reliable way you can know the performance gain you get from a par-
ticular multiprocessor or hyperthreaded system is to measure performance
running your own workload. The behavior of multiprocessor systems is simply
too complex to allow accurate prediction (other than, perhaps, through simu-
lation). For example, consider the following factors:
✦Cache implementation and coordination — Multiprocessor systems
have to solve the problem of maintaining consistency among multi-
ple copies of a single value that might be multiply stored in the
caches. Figure 4-7 shows the problem.

Figure 4-7: Independent caches in multiprocessor systems
Suppose Processor 1 reads the value of COLOR from main memory,
and suppose the value is GREEN. A copy — GREEN — remains in
Cache 1. Later, suppose Processor 2 sets COLOR to BLUE. Cache 2 will
hold the value BLUE, and main memory will be updated to have BLUE
in COLOR, as well. The problem is that, unless something speciﬁc
happens, Cache 1 won’t have the news and will store GREEN. This
means that if a program runs on Processor 1, it will load the (incor-
rect) value GREEN from cache and not the (correct) value BLUE.
This problem is called the cache coherence problem. A cache coher-
ence protocol solves the problem, ensuring that when Processor 2
changes the value of COLOR, Cache 1 marks its copy as invalid and
throws it away. This process ensures that any later access to COLOR
by Processor 1 retrieves the correct value from main memory.
✦Bus performance — Although the front side buses in current-genera-
tion computers are fast enough for one processor, loading them with
multiple processors can create bottlenecks. Hyperthreaded proces-
sors use faster front side buses, while multiprocessor systems use
multiple bus architectures.
✦Multi-threaded software — Multiple processors won’t do you much
good if you have only one program running at a time, particularly if
the program does only one thing at a time. Server computers, such
as the ones used to support access to World Wide Web pages across
the Internet, can naturally have a copy of the server program running
for each user accessing a page, and so can beneﬁt from multiple
processors. Depending on how you use it, the computer on your
desk may not have much to do other than to run the program you’re

using. Unless that program breaks its work into several pieces that
can be run in parallel, or you run more than one program at once,
the second and other processors will sit idle. The most common
example of applications that exploit parallelism is the more powerful
image processing programs, which can dispatch processors to
crunch on different parts of the image.
Windows NT/2000/XP has had the ability to let programs run parallel
operations from the beginning. Windows 9X and its predecessors did
not. Because the market for Windows 9X programs was far larger than
that for Windows NT programs, software developers generally wrote
for the larger market and did not implement parallel operations.
If you actively use several programs at once, and if those programs take signiﬁ-
cant time to do things, you’ll also beneﬁt from a dual processor or hyper-
threaded system. In principle, a very fast processor can be shared among
several programs transparently; in practice, multiprocessor systems using
somewhat slower processors can feel more responsive than the faster
uniprocessor.
AMD
The Intel-compatible processor market is so large that it was impossible for
companies to resist building competitors to the Intel chips. AMD licensed
designs from Intel for a while, but moved on to design and build its own inde-
pendent designs. AMD has taken different design approaches than Intel, opting
for more complex pipeline stages that do more work per clock cycle, and intro-
ducing a 64-bit architecture extending the existing 32-bit standard. AMD’s strat-
egy results in processors that run at lower clock rates than the Intel ones, but
not necessarily ones with lower performance. The value of the 64-bit architec-
ture in anything but servers remains to be seen.
AMD has given its desktop Athlon processors, which compete with the Intel
Pentium 4, names that include numeric designators intended to suggest the
Pentium 4 clock speed at which the Athlon delivers equivalent performance.
Whether the processor is faster or slower depends on what you’re doing, so
inevitably you’ll want to research benchmarked performance or run your own.
The AMD processors are highly compatible with the Intel ones; the only down-
side you might see is that you’ll likely use motherboards built from third-party
chipsets. The rate of problems for those chipsets is somewhat higher, but if
you research the speciﬁc chipset and motherboard you’re looking at for
reported problems and stick with proven motherboard manufacturers such as
ASUS, you should be okay.
Courts have held that manufacturers can replicate Intel’s instruction set (often
called the x86 instruction set), but have imposed difﬁcult conditions for doing
so. The competitor can’t reverse engineer what Intel has done, taking apart the
Intel product to replicate what it does. Instead, they have to start with a speci-
ﬁcation of what the product has to do and create a new, independent design.
Engineering in compatibility starts very early in the design cycle, well before
ﬁrst chip production. It’s difﬁcult and expensive.
60 Part II ✦Processors and Motherboards

AMD approaches strict compatibility this way:
✦High-level compatibility model — Before AMD’s engineers design
the ﬁrst circuit in a new processor, they look at the architectural fea-
tures (like pipelines) they plan to use. The high-level compatibility
model allows them to understand how those features will perform
against the x86 instruction set. Design doesn’t continue until they
achieve a mix of features that in simulation provides the desired 
performance.
✦Register behavior model and logic model tests — As designers work
out ﬁner and ﬁner details of the design, these models help them ver-
ify that the design still meets the speciﬁcation. Getting errors out of
the design early is a big cost saver, so continuous modeling and sim-
ulation is essential to getting the product to market.
✦Hardware emulation — This is the ﬁnal veriﬁcation before building
chips. The actual chip hardware design is run on a computer designed
to simulate chip operation. The combination is fast enough to make
it practical to run real operating systems and application software,
greatly increasing the visibility into the operation of the chip and
helping to uncover subtle errors.
Chapter 4 ✦Processors, Cache, and Memory 61
Compatibility Above All Else
AMD has to provide complete compatibility with the Intel products because you,
as a purchaser, have to know that your software runs without problems on their
chips. If you couldn’t be sure of that, no amount of improved performance or
reduced cost could make the purchase worthwhile.
Compatibility is paramount. The old Intel 8080 processor, for example, did some
odd things with the status ﬂags that characterized the results of arithmetic
instructions. Some time after the introduction of the Intel 8080, a competing
manufacturer (not AMD) introduced an 8080 “replacement” that was signiﬁ-
cantly faster. Unfortunately, the manufacturer had “improved” Intel’s design to
correct the status ﬂag “ﬂaws.” Somehow, it didn’t seem important to the manu-
facturer that the change caused a lot of software programmed to work around
the supposed ﬂaws not to work. They probably sold some of those chips some-
where after this incompatibility came to light, but not very many. Speed always
takes second place to compatible operation, and few chip manufacturers since
then have dared to deviate from absolute equivalence to Intel’s documented
speciﬁcations.
In that light, AMD’s strategy to bring the 64-bit Opteron processor to market is
bold. The Opteron delivers excellent 32- and 64-bit performance, while Intel’s
64-bit Itanium is barely useful in its 32-bit compatibility mode. The two 64-bit
architectures are incompatible, too, so it will be interesting to see how the mar-
ket develops and which 64-bit architectures ﬁnally prevail. Intel’s announcement
in February of 2004 that they would ship processors compatible with the AMD
64-bit extensions validates AMD’s approach, but it remains an open question
which 64-bit architecture will ultimately dominate the market. 

✦System-level tests — Once chips come off AMD’s line, they go into
computers and begin an extensive test sequence to ensure that they
run Windows and other PC operating systems and applications; and
they also undergo a wide variety of specialized hardware and soft-
ware tests (including tests by independent laboratories).
Power Management
Power management started as a way to extend the battery life in laptop com-
puters because the less power the computer uses, the longer the battery lasts.
The initial standard for how Windows and the BIOS interacted to do this was
called Advanced Power Management (APM), but that approach has been
replaced by the more capable and reliable Advanced Conﬁguration and Power
Interface (ACPI) speciﬁcation. Power management reduces system-wide power
consumption in one or more of these ways:
✦Slow down or stop the processor clock — Because the power that
all the chips in your computer draw depends on how fast the chips
are running, slowing down or stopping the processor reduces not
only the power consumption by the processor but also the power
consumption of the cache and the main memory. You won’t notice
this happening — Windows knows when the processor is idle and
runs the processor at full speed at all other times. The processor
goes from stopped to full speed immediately, without a delay.
✦Set the display to low power or standby — Whether you have a
desktop or laptop computer, the display consumes a major portion
of the total system power. The picture tube and its supporting elec-
tronics consume most of the power in a monitor, and the lights for
the liquid crystal display (LCD) use most of the power in a laptop
display. Screen savers don’t affect power consumption directly; the
display consumes almost the same power whether the screen is all
black or all white.
The difference between low-power and standby modes in a monitor
is in how much gets turned off. Standby takes less power, but takes a
little more time to turn back on. LCD display lights are either on or
off, and since they generate more light after they get hot, there will
be some difference in the image you see when the lights go back on
until they are hot again.
✦Spin down the disks — The motor that rotates the disk spindle and
platters consumes most of the power in a disk drive. By keeping the
electronics alive but turning off the motor, disk drive manufacturers
reduce power consumption when the computer is idle. There’s an
irritating delay to spin the disk back to operating speeds, though, so
it’s important to strike a balance between power savings and operat-
ing convenience.
62 Part II ✦Processors and Motherboards

Power conservation is part of desktop computers as well as laptops, providing
features such as instant-on and making it ecologically reasonable to leave your
computer on all the time. Microsoft argues that Windows computers need to
be available on-demand — without a boot sequence — to do the work you
want. The idea is that the PC should always be on and ready, but like a televi-
sion, appear off when not in use. When you (or your network) want service,
the computer should wake up immediately, do the work, and then automati-
cally go back to sleep.
This isn’t a small goal. We’ve seen a surprising number of manufacturers rec-
ommend turning off power management features in the BIOS and in Windows
as one of their ﬁrst steps in troubleshooting erratic problems. Stopping a com-
puter in its tracks in a manner that lets it resume properly later is ﬁendishly
difﬁcult. If you have problems you can’t isolate any other way, you might tem-
porarily try turning off power management features yourself. You can always
turn them back on if the problem lies elsewhere.
Summary
✦Your processor executes instructions at a blindingly quick rate, but
each instruction does one literal, simple thing. It takes a lot of
instructions to do useful work.
✦Every instruction requires one or more memory references, so cache
memory that can provide high-speed memory access for some refer-
ences lets the processor run without waiting.
✦All of your computer components need to be in balance. Adding com-
ponents that upset the balance gets you less performance than you
paid for.
✦Hyperthreaded systems are becoming more and more common on the
desktop. You’ll need Windows XP to fully exploit those processors.

f you’re the type that takes apart electronic things to
see what’s inside, and if you’ve done that for the last
45 years or so, you’ve noticed a profound change in
how electronic systems are built. Forty years ago and
more, what you noticed ﬁrst were the tubes, transform-
ers, and other large components. Inside a box under
those components were some other components and a
whole lot of wires. Building anything this way took a lot
of labor to screw things together, cut wires, and make
connections, with a great deal of the labor simply in the
process of connecting wires to terminals.
Not too much later, electronics manufacturers switched
to using printed circuit boards, which are ﬂat pieces of
ﬁberglass or other stiff, non-conductive material. A
printing and etching process places strips of copper
(called traces) on and in the card, with areas at the end
of the strips called pads to which the manufacturer
attaches components. Printed circuits started out with
traces on one side, but rapidly evolved to traces on
both sides. Later versions laminated more than one
card together, providing many layers to hold traces. 
The reason for adding layers to the boards was that the
components had become more complex, with more con-
nections, and simple one- and two-layer boards could
not provide enough traces.
Every new layer on a printed circuit costs more money
to design and build. As the cost to make connections
grew, and as the number of connections outstripped
even very expensive multilayer boards, designers
started looking for ways to reduce the number of con-
nections (and so the number of traces and layers). One
very successful way has been to share wires among
more than two devices. Figure 5-1 shows the idea, using
the problem of connecting a processor to its memories
as an example.

Figure 5-1: Sharing wires to do more than one function is the idea 
behind the buses in all computers today.
The most straightforward design for connecting a processor to its memories
uses a separate wire for every connection (this is the drawing on the left in
Figure 5-1). Suppose that every memory chip had its own set of wires to con-
nect it to the processor. Using 512Mb (megabit) chips, a 1GB memory array
needs 16 chips. Each chip has in excess of 60 pins, so to connect up every chip
with its own wires, you need almost 1,000 wires. If you want to add memory,
you need over 60 more wires for every chip. You need even more wires to con-
nect to your disk, video, and other components. The processor talks to only a
few of the memory chips at once, however, so most of these wires are doing
nothing while a few do useful work. The wires are functional duplicates of one
another, serving the same purpose (such as conveying data signals) except for
the fact that they connect to different memory chips.
As connections became relatively more expensive and the cost of circuits built
out of transistors became very much cheaper, changes in design to substitute
cheap transistors for expensive wires became possible. The idea of a bus grew
out of this substitution.
Instead of using point-to-point connections, suppose that every memory chip
connects to the same set of wires (so you use the same 60 wires with all chips,
not 60 for each chip). You have to add a few new wires to identify which chips
should be active at any instant of time because the processor doesn’t talk to
every memory at once. The drawing on the right side of Figure 5-1 diagrams this

scheme, called a bus. A wire carrying a data signal, for instance, connects to the
processor and equally to all the memory chips. Using the same wire across all
the memory chips means that only one can use the wire at a time, but because
that’s how the processor works in the ﬁrst place, there’s no interference.
The ISA Bus: It’s Old and Slow, and
(Finally) Almost Gone
Buses have been in personal computers since the ﬁrst 8080-based designs in
the late 1970s. Computers prior to the PC used a variety of buses, with the
most common one being called the S-100 bus (after the 100 pins on its connec-
tor); the IBM PC introduced the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus. A
bus is deﬁned by a speciﬁcation, which usually includes all the elements
needed to ensure that products built to the speciﬁcation ﬁt into and work in a
computer built to the same speciﬁcation:
✦The physical speciﬁcation — A bus usually includes a backplane,
which is the circuit card all the other cards plug into, and those
other cards. If the base card has components on it, it’s frequently
called a motherboard rather than a backplane. The plug-in cards have
shape and size speciﬁed so they ﬁt into a standard-sized chassis. The
physical speciﬁcation details the connector(s) used between the
backplane and the cards, the distance between cards, the maximum
heat dissipation, and other mechanical issues.
✦The electrical speciﬁcation — Every active pin on a bus connector
carries a signal, power, or ground. The electrical speciﬁcation for the
bus deﬁnes what signal is on each pin on the connector and the mini-
mum and maximum speciﬁcations for each.
✦The bus timing and protocol — The behavior and timing of the sig-
nals that control the bus have to be very precisely deﬁned so that
everything plays together properly. Figure 5-2 shows the simpliﬁed
timing and protocol for the ISA bus. If this were the fully detailed
drawing, the minimum and maximum times between events would be
shown, and the exact signals making up each of the signal groups
shown would be identiﬁed. The top two lines in the ﬁgure show how
addresses go on the bus, the middle line the timing for read or write
commands, and the bottom two the timing for data being read or
written on the bus. The gray areas in the timing diagram represent
times when the signals are allowed to be changing; the white areas
are times when the signals must remain stable.
When a processor wants to communicate with memory or an input/output
(I/O) device over the ISA bus, it goes through these steps according to the tim-
ing of Figure 5-2:
1. Output an address onto the bus (“Address lines”) and assert the
“Address enable” signal so that cards on the bus know that there is
an address present they should look at.
Chapter 5 ✦Buses, Chipsets, and Motherboards 67

2. If this will be a memory or I/O write, output the data to be written
onto the bus (“Write data”).
3. Output the command to be performed by the cards onto the bus
(“Command”). The deﬁned commands include memory read, mem-
ory write, I/O read, and I/O write.
4. If this is a memory or I/O read, wait the required amount of time, and
after the data is stable, pull the data off the bus.
5. Remove the command from the bus.
6. Remove the address enable from the bus.
Amazing as it is that the ISA bus survived for nearly 20 years, there’s no longer
much of anything good to be said about the ISA bus. It’s slow — orders of mag-
nitude slower than the now-aging Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)
bus. It’s not as reliable as PCI because certain critical signals must be captured
at the point they change from high to low or low to high. (More reliable buses
allow devices to look for high or low status, not transitions.) It’s terribly con-
straining for software and for system conﬁguration because it can’t address
enough memory and doesn’t provide enough interrupt control signals. It’s difﬁ-
cult to work with because the vast majority of ISA cards and systems ever built
required the user to manually set addresses and interrupts, and to know what
addresses and interrupts will work.
Figure 5-2: The operation of the ISA bus is deﬁned by a simple set of signals 
and rules.
The one good thing to be said about the ISA bus was that, for a long time,
nearly every PC — Windows or otherwise — had one, and building cards that
work in an ISA bus machine was well understood. A manufacturer could sell a
card for the ISA bus knowing there were a tremendous number of machines

capable of hosting that card. A user could buy an ISA card and know that the
chances are good that it can be made to work.
For all that, however, few computers or motherboards are now built incorpo-
rating the ISA bus. It’s too slow for anything interesting any more, and caused
too many conﬂicts and conﬁguration problems.
PCI
Based on the experience of the ISA and several other less common buses, com-
puter designers realized a new bus was needed and that the new bus had to
meet these goals:
✦Provide increased performance — Target performance was upwards
of 100MB per second. Support for at least the full 32-bit address and
data width of Intel-compatible processors was required.
✦Support multiple bus masters — Allowing peripheral devices to con-
trol high-rate transfers independently ofﬂoads the processor, increas-
ing net system performance.
✦Enable automatic system conﬁguration — Incorrectly assigned
addresses and interrupts are the cause of far too many system prob-
lems. The bus had to establish the underlying structures and mecha-
nisms to allow the computer to assist the user with this problem.
✦Be processor independent — The cost of developing chips to sup-
port the bus and products that implement the bus is signiﬁcant to
manufacturers; the money spent on cards is of importance to users.
The bus needed to preserve those investments across generations of
processors.
✦Impose low implementation costs — The PC market is extremely
cost sensitive, so it was critical that the bus design not price systems
or cards beyond what the market will accept.
The Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus accomplished all this. The
PCI bus has supported the 486, Pentium through Pentium 4 and Celeron,
Athlon, Opteron, and many non-Intel compatible processors using the three-
tier structure shown in Figure 5-3. The fastest operations (including memory
and the AGP card interface) are on the host (or front side) bus, connected
through the Northbridge chip. The PCI bus once connected the Northbridge
and Southbridge chips, but has now been replaced by a faster proprietary bus
between the two, relegated to replacing the ISA bus for slower interfaces off
the Southbridge.
Transfers to devices not on the front side bus are detected by the Northbridge
chip and passed through the proprietary bus to the PCI bus below the South-
bridge chip. Transfers on the PCI bus occur at rates up to 133MB per second,
although sustained rates rarely go above 50 to 70 MB per second.
Chapter 5 ✦Buses, Chipsets, and Motherboards 69

Figure 5-3: PCI implements a three-tier structure for performance and 
compatibility.
PCI Express
PCI itself will be replaced in a few years by PCI Express, a faster interface capa-
ble of operation over longer distances. PCI Express will make possible, for
example, core processing boxes that reside on the ﬂoor out of the way and
communicate at PCI or faster speeds with desktop display and interface units.
Chipsets
Early on, the chips surrounding the processor in a PC were there to help it run
and to provide the minimal functions necessary for ISA bus support. The chips
you found on the motherboard included a clock generator (which was the part
of the processor that somehow never ﬁt on the chip itself), a direct memory
access (DMA) controller, an interrupt controller, a timer chip, the BIOS chips,
and some other small stuff. All those circuits are still required in your com-
puter, but (with the exception of the BIOS) they’ve been taken over by the
chips that support the much faster structures you now use, including the host
bus and the PCI bus.

70 Part II ✦Processors and Motherboards

Figure 5-4 shows how things started. Most of the chips on early motherboards
had to do with the care and feeding of the processor (like the clock generator),
and with helping the processor handle interfaces to the outside world (like the
DMA, interrupts, and timer chips). The simplicity of the bus interface — not
much more than chips to strengthen the signals from the processor — was
possible because the speeds of the processor and memory (on the ISA bus)
were reasonably closely matched. That match wasn’t an accident because the
ISA bus began as an extension of the bus on the Intel 8088 processor. The
placement of added memory, video, disk, and sound functions on the ISA bus
further simpliﬁed the motherboard design because all the complexity tended
to be on plug-in cards.
Figure 5-4: Chips on early motherboards
Processor speed increased faster than the speed of memory in the evolution of
the PC. System and processor designers responded with faster, more complex
designs that solved the resulting problems and exploited the additional power
possible in larger, faster chips dedicated to speciﬁc functions. In the case of
the logic that goes on a motherboard, the result was chipsets that encapsulate
nearly all the circuits surrounding the processor and controlling the host and
PCI buses.
The PCI bus is enormously more complex to implement than the ISA bus
because the speed gain that PCI delivers requireed sophisticated system 
and processor designs. Bringing that complexity to market at a low price
required that specialized chips encapsulate the complete front side bus and

PCI functionality. Elements of the chipset support the processor host bus, the
cache and main memory, the PCI bus itself, and integrated peripherals includ-
ing a PCI Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) disk controller. Some of the fea-
tures implemented in current motherboard chipsets include:
✦Synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) support —
The chipset provides the interface between the processor and main
memory. The capabilities in the chipset determine what conﬁgura-
tions your motherboard will handle.
✦IDE and Bus-mastering IDE — Most chipsets implement a parallel
IDE disk interface, enabling support for fast ATA disks using the Ultra
DMA IDE interface. You won’t see better disk performance from DMA
on the IDE ports, but you will see lower processor usage during disk
transfers.
✦Serial ATA — The shortcomings in the IDE interface, including the
lack of error checking and very limited cable lengths, lead to the cre-
ation of the faster, more reliable serial ATA speciﬁcation. Serial ATA
already runs at bus rates of 150MB per second, so it’s faster than PCI.
That speed mismatch makes it valuable to implement the serial ATA
ports directly on the motherboard where they can be connected to a
faster bus.
✦Peripheral support, including audio, USB, and Ethernet — The
newest chipsets add support for audio on the motherboard, elimi-
nating the need for a sound card, and support for the Universal
Serial Bus (USB) and Ethernet. Chipsets for low-cost machines
include built-in video card functions, eliminating yet another 
separate card.
PCs support a variety of other buses, depending on their use, sometimes by
additions to the chipset. The most common of those other buses are the PC
Card and IEEE 1394 interfaces.
Motherboards
If you open your computer, you’ll see a large board on the bottom or side of
the case, into which other boards are plugged. That large board is called the
motherboard and is the focus for the processor, memory, and buses. Many of
the motherboard characteristics you need to consider are prominently fea-
tured in computer system advertisements, including processor type, clock
speed, and bus. An equal number of key characteristics are often omitted,
such as onboard peripheral support, the range of processor speeds supported,
the maximum amount of memory, and the number of memory slots. These lat-
ter characteristics strongly affect your ability to upgrade the machine in the
future. Figure 5-5 is a typical example, showing the Intel D875PBZ motherboard
annotated to identify the major components. The features and layout of your
motherboard will vary somewhat, but the ideas are similar and the parts tend
to look much the same.

The components in Figure 5-5 are identiﬁed in the following list, starting with
the processor socket and going clockwise:
✦Processor socket — This motherboard accepts Intel Pentium 4
processors. The ZIF (Zero-Insertion Force) socket lets you easily
insert and remove the chip. Be careful to seat the processor in the
socket ﬁrmly before closing the clamp. If you don’t, some of the pins
may not make contact properly and the machine won’t boot. The

✦DIMM memory sockets — This motherboard uses PC2700 or PC3200
SDRAM memory on dual inline memory module (DIMM) strips,
depending on the speed of the processor’s front side bus (533 and
800 MHz, respectively). The faster memory works with the slower
bus, although the system won’t be any faster, letting you prepare for
future processor upgrades.
✦ATX power connector — The ATX power supply output wires termi-
nate in a single relatively large connector, plus a smaller connector
for added 12 V power.
✦Floppy connector — The ﬂoppy disk controller is on the mother-
board. You run a standard cable from the ﬂoppy disk drive in the
case to this connector.
✦Disk drive connectors — If you use an IDE (parallel ATA) disk or
CD-ROM, you’ll plug those devices into the IDE connectors. Use the
Serial ATA connectors for newer disk drives.
✦Northbridge chip — Although small, the support chip comprises the
bulk of the electronics surrounding the processor, including support
for the AGP and PCI buses, the disk controller, and other functions.
✦PCI connectors — Up to ﬁve PCI adapter cards plug in here and are
secured to the back of the case with a screw.
✦AGP connector — An AGP video card plugs in here.
✦Ethernet connector — Plug the PC into your local area network
(LAN) using this onboard RJ-45 connector.
✦Parallel port connector — You’ll plug an older printer into this con-
nector. Newer printers use USB or Ethernet.
✦USB connectors — Keyboards, mice, speakers, cameras, scanners,
and other devices plug into the USB ports. Unlike the PS/2 mouse,
keyboard, and parallel ports, you don’t have to turn off the computer
to attach and detach USB devices.
✦Serial port connector — Serial ports let you plug in modems and
other external devices.
✦PS/2 mouse and keyboard connector — These are standard mini-
DIN connectors that match the one at the end of your mouse or key-
board cable. Look for drawings near the connectors to determine
which is for the mouse and which for the keyboard.
✦ATX connector panel — All the external I/O connections from the
motherboard, including sound, game, serial, parallel, USB, Ethernet,
mouse, and keyboard ports, are directly attached to the mother-
board and mounted on the ATX connector panel.
Also on the motherboard is the basic input-output system (BIOS), the program
that starts up the computer when you turn on the power. A ﬂash memory chip
holds the BIOS code, even when the power is off. A special procedure allows
you to update the BIOS in the ﬂash with new code; you’ll get both the update
software and the new BIOS image from the PC or motherboard manufacturer’s
Web site.
74 Part II ✦Processors and Motherboards

External Buses
The external connections to your PC have evolved from simple single-point
connections, such as serial and parallel ports, to high-speed external buses
you can use to connect multiple devices.
Universal Serial Bus
The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is the most common external bus, used to con-
nect mice, keyboards, cameras, GPS receivers, handheld computers, disk
drives, serial and parallel ports, and more. We cover USB in Chapter 10
because one of its most exciting uses is for external, removable storage; how-
ever, you’ll want to keep in mind that the most convenient way to have enough
USB ports is for them to be provided directly by the motherboard. It’s best to
have USB 2.0 ports because they’ll operate at the highest 480 Mbps rate, yet
throttle down if you connect a slower USB 1.1 device.
IEEE 1394 (FireWire)
Another external bus is the one deﬁned by IEEE speciﬁcation 1394, popularly
called FireWire. Like USB (Chapter 10), IEEE 1394 is a serial bus, transmitting 1
bit at a time over copper wire with multiple devices cabled into a tree. IEEE
1394 is as fast as USB 2.0, being capable of rates from 100 to 400 Mbps. IEEE
1394 supports far more connected devices than USB, too.
Nevertheless, few products use IEEE 1394. Typical products that do are digital
movie cameras, digital still cameras, and digital VHS players.
PC Card
The PC Card (previously PCMCIA, or Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association) bus originated as a way to plug in modules to laptop
and smaller computers. PC Card devices are roughly the size of a credit card,
and from 3.3 to 10.5 millimeters thick. The initial PC Card products were add-
on memory and plug-in software, but manufacturers were quick to offer a wide
range of products:
✦Read/write and read-only memory
✦Hard disk drives
✦Modems (including Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and
Cellular data/fax)
✦Network adapters (including wireless and adapters combined with
modems)
✦Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) adapters
✦Sound adapters
Chapter 5 ✦Buses, Chipsets, and Motherboards 75

PC Cards plug into a 68-pin host socket. Three PC Card sizes exist, with a
fourth being debated.
✦Type I cards (such as memory) are 3.3 mm thick.
✦Type II cards (usually I/O devices such as modems) are 5 mm thick.
✦Type III devices (typically data storage or radio devices) are 10.5 mm
thick.
✦Type IV was intended to be an 18-mm slot for large-capacity hard
drives, but never made it to market.
A PC Card ﬁts in any slot either its own size or a larger size. For example, a
Type II modem ﬁts into a Type III slot.
Summary
✦Buses are fundamental to the organization of your PC’s electronics.
✦The primary buses inside your PC are PCI, AGP, and parallel or serial
ATA. The primary external buses are USB, IEEE 1394, and PC Card
(PCMCIA).
✦The key decisions about your computer — processor, cache, and
bus — primarily concern the motherboard. The choice of mother-
board drives everything else you do.

our monitor and video display board work
together as a pair, much like a disk and its con-
troller. The capabilities of the monitor must match the
needs of the display modes requested by your software
and output by your video card. To understand how the
monitor and video board work together and contribute
to the performance of your computer, we’ll start at the
monitor and work inward through the functions of the
video board.
A Computer Monitor Is Not
the Same as a Television
Although much of what a computer monitor does
appears similar to what a television does, the require-
ments on a computer monitor are much more stringent.
A television that meets the North American standard,
for example, displays roughly 525×700 pixels, with a
viewable area smaller than those numbers. The
European Phase Alternating Line (PAL) standard is a lit-
tle different at 625×833 pixels, but close to the same
size. The most basic computer monitor meeting the
Video Graphics Array (VGA) standard, however, dis-
plays no fewer than 640×480 pixels — all viewable —
with very high-end monitors capable of resolutions of
2,048×1,536 pixels and more. It is for this reason that
products that display television in a window on the
computer screen are fairly inexpensive and work well,
but products that display computer images on televi-
sions are limited to basic VGA resolutions — 640×480 is
common, although some products output up to
1,024×768 — and often smear the images.
If you look closely at the screen on a conventional moni-
tor or liquid crystal display (LCD) panel, you’ll see a
pattern of tiny colored dots that, when each is lit up at
the right brightness, forms the picture you see (moni-
tors using the Sony Trinitron tubes have vertical lines of
color instead). These dots are called pixels (picture ele-

and from there into the rest of the computer.
Figure 6-1 shows in more detail the process of drawing a picture by sweeping
the dots on the screen. One complete traverse of the screen starts at position
1 and moves to the right. At the end of the line (2) the beam turns off and rap-
idly moves down and to the left to 3 and the start of the next line. The sweep
of the second line takes the beam to the right, ending at 4. This process con-
tinues with the beam moving downward until the pattern ﬁnishes at 5. The
beam then turns off and moves back to 1 to repeat the process.
Figure 6-1: The picture on your screen is a swept array of red, green, 
and blue dots.
The changes in brightness the beam delivers while sweeping over the dots
determines the picture you see. For example, a completely blue screen results
if the beam is off for the red and green dots but on for the blue ones. The
brightness of the blue dots is controlled by the brightness of the beam when
it’s over blue dots. More complex pictures are simply combinations of red,
green, and blue dots at the right brightness. Your eye sees not the individual
dots but the composition of them into a complete image.
Because the timing of changes in brightness must be critically synchronized to
the position of the beam on the screen, the video board timing controls the
scan frequencies of the monitor as well as the operation of the board. All the
signal timing is ultimately related to the dot clock, which is a signal within the
video board that pulses once every time the beam on the screen passes a tri-
angle of red, green, and blue dots (one pixel). For example, if the display is set
to 640×480 resolution, the dot clock pulses 640 times as the beam traverses
once from left to right on the screen over the visible part of the image. The dot
clock continues to pulse as the beam makes its fast retrace from right to left
and then repeats the cycle for the next line. Ignoring overscan and retrace, the
dot clock frequency is the resolution of the screen times the number of frames
per second. For a display at 1,280×1,024 at 75 Hz, the dot clock runs at slightly
over 98 MHz.

The Video data path
A digital-to-analog (D/A) converter is a device that outputs a signal correspon-
ding to the number fed to the converter. If the converter receives a zero value,
it outputs a zero signal. If it receives a large number, it outputs a large signal. 
A video board has three D/A converters, one each for the red, green, and blue
signals sent to the monitor (Figure 6-2). The dot clock sets the timing of pixel
data from the display memory at the D/A converters, sending a new pixel value
for each clock pulse. At 1,600×1,200 resolution, there are (1,600 × 1,200) =
1,920,000 dots on the screen; if you conﬁgure the display for an 85 Hz refresh
rate, the dot clock runs at 1,920,000 × 85 = over 163 megahertz. In 32-bit color
mode, the display memory delivers over 622 megabytes per second in that
example, fetching 4 bytes per dot clock.
Figure 6-2: A video board lives or dies by how fast it moves data around.
The video bus delivers the data from video memory to the D/A converters.
Achieving a constant, high-speed ﬂow of data to the D/A converters across the
video bus led designers to many of the same techniques used in processor
front side and memory buses, including making the bus wider to get more out
of each bus cycle and using optimized bus cycles to speed access. It’s not mar-
keting hype that drove video cards to a 256-bit internal bus — making the bus
wider reduces the bus cycle rate.
Sixteen million is a whole lot of colors
There are three common Windows color settings. One-byte pixels can specify
256 colors. Two-byte pixels — called High Color — can specify 65,536 colors.
Four-byte pixels — called True Color — can specify 16,777,216 colors plus a
brightness channel in the fourth byte. (A 3-byte, 24-bit format is also available.)

“When you’re using 24 bits of color, most people can’t see the dif-
ference between two adjacent colors. It also becomes hard to name
them.” — Microsoft Beta Tester T-Shirt
Each of the three D/A converters (one each for red, green, and blue) accepts 
1 byte at a time, so some work is needed to be able to feed all three pixel for-
mats to the converters. Figure 6-3 shows the options. In 24- and 32-bit display
modes, 1 byte in a pixel goes to each of the three converters. In 16-bit modes,
the 16-bit value is split into ﬁelds (usually 5 bits for red, 6 for green, and 5 for
blue). The ﬁelds are extracted from the value and sent to the corresponding
D/A converter. The only difference between the two modes is the number of
bits used to store the color values.
Figure 6-3: Windows supports three primary pixel formats.
The 256-color mode is different from the other two, using 8 bits to store each
pixel. If the video card divided that 1 byte into ﬁelds as with High Color — say
with 3, 3, and 2 bits per color — the card could not provide good rendition.
Instead, the 8-bit value gets used as an index into a color palette with 256
entries, each holding a wider value that can be sent to the D/A converters.
Every pixel is therefore one byte, and as bytes are read from the display mem-
ory, they go through the color palette shown in Figure 6-3. Each of the 256 pos-
sible values in the byte corresponds to one entry in the palette. Each entry in
the palette contains a value for red, green, and blue, each of which are fed to
the corresponding D/A converter. The overall structure permits programs 
to choose a set of 256 possible onscreen colors from a much wider range of

The 256-color mode is a compromise for slow, limited capability computers,
but isn’t required any longer.
Video Buses
The enormous data rates between processor and video card required for high-
resolution, high-performance graphics exceed what’s possible with the
Peripheral Component Interface (PCI) bus. That problem led designers to cre-
ate the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), which started as a modiﬁed version
of PCI, to provide greater data rates between system and video memory.
Successive generations of the AGP speciﬁcation — 1X, 2X, 4X, and now 8X —
increased transfer rates to 2.1 gigabytes per second.
The 8x AGP technology will be the last revision. Succeeding generations will be
based on the PCI Express serial graphics speciﬁcation and should show up in
PCs some time in 2004 or later.
For conventional 2D displays, the data rates AGP makes possible are enough to
support several independent displays. ATI, nVidia, and Matrox all make video
cards supporting multiple independent monitors from the same card, and if
you’re willing to add PCI cards alongside the AGP card, Windows supports up
to nine monitors. Your desktop extends over all the monitors you have, creat-
ing a larger surface on which you can keep open applications.
What a 3D Video Accelerator Does
Three dimensional games, visualization, and virtual reality systems put you in
a simulated ﬁrst- or third-person world where you can move around in a highly
detailed environment. These programs work by maintaining a “wire-frame”
structure giving shape to the objects in the world (walls, ﬂoors, and ceilings),
and by painting the surfaces of the objects with colored patterns called tex-
tures, a process called texture mapping. Figure 6-4 is a three dimensional view
of a room; Figure 6-5 is the wire-frame view of the textured representation in
Figure 6-4. Everything you see in Figure 6-4 is the result of textures painted on
the ﬂoors, walls, and ceilings deﬁned by the wire frame.
A lot of work is required to create a 3D image. Overall, the sequence is what’s
shown in Figure 6-6, with each step moving the program’s model of what exists
in an imaginary world further from that model and closer to dots on your
screen. As the computations progress from left to right, there become more
objects to do computations for — objects transition to polygons which then
transition to texels — increasing the amount of work to be done in each block.

Figure 6-6: The 3D viewing and rendering pipeline transforms a program’s model 
of what exists into the image you see.
The details of each step in Figure 6-6 are:
1. Compute vertices — The processor computes the position of each
vertex of each object in the overall coordinate system.
2. Clip edges — Objects may extend past the edges of the visible area.
The overhang has to be eliminated, so the processor clips the edges
of objects against the drawing region boundaries, one polygon of an
object at a time.
3. Eliminate hidden surfaces — You want the ﬁnal display to omit hid-
den surfaces. The processor has to identify visible surfaces and elim-
inate back-facing surfaces.
4. Compute projections — The display is only 2D, as if a glass surface
is interposed between your eye and a 3D scene. Simulating this in the
computer requires computing 3D to 2D projections of the vertices of
each polygon.
5. Paint surfaces — Once you have a set of 2D polygons, you can paint
the surface of each one with a shaded, perspective-scaled texture map.

Chapter 6 ✦Video 85

A 3D hardware accelerator takes over operations on the right side of the
pipeline, freeing the processor for the work on the left. Simple accelerators do
only the polygon rendering and texture mapping; more capable accelerators
scoop up functions in prior blocks of the ﬁgure, such as by permitting the
“Compute Vertices” block to pass ﬂoating-point coordinates into the next
stage. All these hardware optimizations reduce the workload on the processor.
The most sophisticated accelerators move processing at the vertices, such as
lighting effects, into the accelerator by allowing the program to download sim-
ple programs into the accelerator that run for each vertex.
Texture mapping is more complicated than simply copying a patterned bitmap
to the screen because it requires dealing with the perspective effects in the
wire frame and with visibility of objects due to solid surfaces being in front of
one another. A rectangular pattern bitmap has to be distorted to ﬁt perspec-
tive changes. You can see this in Figure 6-4 on the walls that are not perpendi-
cular to your point of view. Surfaces like that have to recede along perspective
lines toward a vanishing point, requiring that the texture map be distorted to
be shorter and shorter as your eye moves back towards the vanishing point.
The calculations to do texture mapping and to decide which parts of what sur-
faces are visible are computationally expensive — they require a lot of work by
the processor. That’s the basic reason why real-time 3D rendering requires a
fast processor for good performance. Higher resolution screen formats require
signiﬁcantly more computation — 640×400 resolution takes 4 times the 
computation of 320×200, while 1280×1024 resolution takes over 16 times the
computation of 320×200. That increased computational load is why the higher
resolutions became common only with the more recent high-speed processors
and high-performance 3D accelerators.
Another key 3D rendering operation is polygon drawing, which is the most
common technique to represent moving objects. Textures drawn on the poly-
gons give the object a realistic look while retaining the advantages of fast 3D
views. Polygon drawing is similar to the process of covering arbitrary wire
frames with texture maps, but is restricted to ﬂat convex shapes to improve
performance. A mesh of triangles can be used to approximate any 3D surface,
which reduces the complexity of rendering the object onto the screen and
makes the operation faster. Because you can make objects arbitrarily detailed
by making the triangles smaller, there’s no necessary loss of visual quality.
Because the two most important operations for high-speed 3D graphics are
texture mapping and polygon rendering, you usually measure 3D software and
hardware performance in textured pixels (texels) per second and ﬁlled poly-
gons per second. Some of the most highly tuned 3D software is in games, so
those that report rendering performance measures sometimes make excellent
3D video benchmarks.

Video Compression
The data rates for digital motion video can become high enough to stress your
computer’s performance and take up a signiﬁcant amount of storage, as shown
in Table 6-1, which shows how many minutes of video you can store on a
650MB CD-ROM. MPEG 1 video is equivalent to the quality you get from a VCR,
which makes the most interesting point about the data in Table 6-1 — the fact
that it’s possible to compress video at a ratio of over 100:1 and still get useful
images on playback.

A variety of video compression technologies are used in personal computers
today, but all are related to the framework established by the Motion Picture
Experts Group (MPEG). The MPEG 1 and MPEG 2 standards deﬁne most MPEG
applications, but MPEG 4 is becoming widespread because of its ability to store
a full-length movie on a CD-ROM, albeit with quality less than that of a DVD.
The video you see on a television is really a high-speed succession of still
frames, each slightly different from the next. MPEG video compression exploits
the successive frame structure of video by using a combination of still image
compression plus algorithms to exploit the interframe redundancy.
The MPEG still image compression technology uses what’s called the Discrete
Cosine Transform, or DCT, the same approach used in JPEG image compres-
sion. The DCT is based on the idea that a time-varying signal — the sequence
of pixels in a line, for instance — can be represented by the sum of a number
of signals at different frequencies. Figure 6-7 sketches that idea. The upper
graph is a time-varying signal we made by adding two single-frequency signals
Chapter 6 ✦Video 87

together. We did a frequency analysis on the composite signal, which produced
the lower graph. The two blips in the lower graph occur at the points corre-
sponding to the two signals we added together, and show that one of the two
signals was signiﬁcantly stronger than the other.
Because you can reconstruct the time-varying signal (the image) from the
decomposed frequencies, the frequencies (and their amplitudes) are equiva-
lent to the image itself. You lose some still image quality if you omit the high-
est frequencies when you reconstruct the image, but omitting the
highest-frequency information (as JPEG compression does) drastically reduces
the size of the stored image, compressing it on disk or over a network.
Figure 6-7: Decomposition of a signal into signals of different frequencies
Figure 6-8 shows the intraframe compression process implementing those
ideas. The DCT algorithm compresses blocks in the image (rather than the
entire image at once) to simplify the computations. After conversion of the
image to DCT coefﬁcients, quantization limits the number of bits, exploiting
the fact that the eye is more sensitive to the effect of the low-frequency coefﬁ-
cients than the high-frequency ones.
I made up the waveform above to represent 
a time-varying signal, such as we might see 
in an image. Although there’s a certain 
regularity, it’s not clear what that regularity is.
The frequency analysis at the right 
reveals that the time-domain signal is 
really made up of two specific 
frequencies (the blips in the graph), 
with one much stronger than the other.
88 Part III ✦Video

Figure 6-8: MPEG compression discards high-frequency image information.
Manipulating the quantization process allows greater or lesser quality in the
compressed image, and in the process requires more or fewer bits in the out-
put data stream.
MPEG compression adds to the JPEG DCT compression by ﬁnding and storing
just the differences between successive frames. Figure 6-9 shows what happens.
The point of the frame structure shown in the ﬁgure is to allow the movement
of blocks (the same ones that were DCT encoded by intraframe coding) to be
speciﬁed. I-frames are completely intraframe coded. P-frames specify motion of
blocks from the preceding I- or P-frame. B-frames specify motion of blocks from
preceding or succeeding B-, P-, or I-frames.
It’s possible that a block in a frame can’t be found in a preceding or succeed-
ing frame. If so, the block is individually DCT-coded and transmitted in the out-
put sequence.

Television in a Window
We have to admit that when we ﬁrst saw a board that would let us turn part of
a computer screen into a television, we didn’t believe it. Fun’s fun, but we ﬁg-
ured we were better off working without television programs in the corner of
the screen. In the same way that we didn’t see the need to turn a computer
into a several-thousand-dollar boom box that plays CDs, we didn’t see any
point in turning it into an expensive television. In both cases, we were wrong.
We didn’t anticipate the value of an MP3 library holding literally thousands or
tens of thousands of songs, and didn’t realize how useful replacing the tape in
a VCR with the disk in your computer could be. Adding a TV tuner to your PC
lets you create the equivalent of a TiVo personal video recorder, which is the
best thing that happened to television since cable and satellite.
A TV tuner decodes the television signal to a video image, then overlays it
onscreen in a window. The ﬁrst TV tuner cards did this by overlaying the 
I-frames – 
intraframes – are 
compressed as self-
contained images 
using DCT 
techniques.
B-frames – bi-directional frames – code the differences from preceding or 
succeeding frames. The differences are presented as motion of a coded 
block from the referenced frame. These arrows show the possible B-frame 
dependencies. The precise I-/B-/P- frame sequence is determined by the 
encoder, and need not be the IBBPBBPBBP sequence shown here.

P-frames – interframes – code the differences from the previous frame, so they

how it has moved in the x and y directions. The arrows show the successive

analog video signal from the television image on top of the computer display
signal, but the products now on the market do the overlay work digitally, send-
ing the television signal out to the video board as a digital pixel stream. The
video board updates the video memory with the pixels from the television
board. The usual output and digital-to-analog conversion circuits on the video
board create the combined signal sent to the monitor. Compressing and writ-
ing the digital video to disk implements the video recorder function.
Choosing a Video Card
Choosing a video board is dependent on what you want from your computer
and on which manufacturers you have conﬁdence in. Even though video drivers
come with Windows, you may still be dependent on the board manufacturer.
(For example, we’ve seen a video board capable of 1600×1200 resolution that
was supported only in 1280×1024 resolution by the standard Windows drivers.
The manufacturer’s enhanced drivers were required to realize the full capabil-
ity of the board.)
Chapter 6 ✦Video 91
Matching Video Hardware and Software
Many 3D video games use the Microsoft DirectX technology to work with the
hardware on the video card. As of early 2004, the current version of DirectX was
9.0b, which was a signiﬁcant advance over earlier versions. Most signiﬁcant of
the features in DirectX 9 is the ability for developers to create small programs
that the video hardware executes for each vertex in the polygon model.
Not all video cards include the hardware and software drivers to support DirectX
9, but the most demanding PC video games (including Microsoft’s Halo and
Valve’s Half-Life 2) require it for the best appearance and performance. Use a
video card supporting only a lesser DirectX revision and you should expect poor
graphics and slower display rates.
That said, don’t forget that the PC video card market is intensely competitive,
with both ATI and nVidia doing everything they can to be the leader. Not all those
efforts work in your best interest. Manufacturers have been caught tuning their
drivers for improved benchmark performance, which has no beneﬁt for game
play. Eidos and Ion Storm have explicitly tuned Deus Ex: Invisible War for the
nVidia hardware, stupidly buying into an nVidia marketing program, and deliv-
ered a game that runs badly on ATI hardware. Worse, in the process, they failed
to test their copy protection adequately, and as of patch level 1.1, Eidos admits
they have bugs that cause the game to fail to run on the system that you see
how to build in Chapter 25.
Keep anti-consumer practices like that in mind when you buy hardware and 
software.

Video Drivers
Most problems with video cards arise from incompatibilities between the driv-
ers and your software. Although we strongly recommend not updating drivers
unless you have a good need to, video drivers are among the most updated
software there is.
The most direct way to get updated video drivers for Windows is on the Internet
from the card manufacturer’s Web site. There are many video card suppliers,
but often they just manufacture standard designs by ATI or nVidia. If you have
a card based on an ATI or nVidia design, you’re probably better off getting
drivers directly (www.ati.com and www.nvidia.com, respectively) than from
the actual manufacturer.
Manufacturers often don’t provide drivers for UNIX systems; contact your
UNIX vendor or, if you use a UNIX system with the XFree86 X Window system,
look at www.xfree86.org.
Because many video cards use their own specialized drivers, the ﬁrst thing to
do when you’re upgrading a video card is to undo anything that’s tied to your
existing card. In Windows, that means you’ll want to change your video driver
to the Standard VGA driver, which should work with both your old and new
cards. We’ve also seen driver updates that failed if the prior ones weren’t unin-
stalled, so check that in the Add/Remove Programs applet in the Windows con-
trol panel.
Summary
✦Video images are arrays of dots (pixels) output by the video board.
✦Higher resolution — more pixels — means closer dot spacing on the
monitor, and more work for the video board.
✦You get more possible colors by using more bytes per pixel, which
takes more memory and creates more work for the video board.
✦Hardware accelerators that take over the work of software can
improve video performance.
✦Realistic 3D displays on your screen require enormous numbers of
computations, leading to other opportunities for accelerators to
improve performance.

t’s easy to say what you want in a monitor. You want
it to be sharp, with bright, clear color. You want what
you see to ﬁll the screen, free of geometric distortions.
You want it to deliver all the capabilities of your 
video card.
Getting what you want is more complex. The technical
characteristics of your monitor determine the limits of
the display modes you can get on the screen. Dot pitch
and the horizontal and vertical frequencies or resolu-
tion are readily evident, but sharpness, color balance,
distortion measurements, and the rest of the character-
istics are harder to specify or measure. Some require
specialized test equipment or software to put up test
displays. Often you can ﬁnd information on those tech-
nical characteristics in product reviews and sometimes
in manufacturer data.
In a dramatic change from the past, there are now two
viable technologies for desktop PC monitors. Cathode
ray tube (CRT) monitors have been the technology of
choice for decades, but are now rapidly being displaced
by the same liquid crystal display (LCD) technology
found in laptop computers. The signiﬁcance of the
change in the market is so great that many companies
have completely abandoned manufacturing CRT moni-
tors, which are now commodity products, in favor of
LCDs. In this chapter, we look ﬁrst at the newer ﬂat
panel technology, then cover the characteristics of the
older CRT monitors.

Flat Panel Displays
A ﬂat panel display is the desktop version of the display you ﬁnd in laptop
computers. The advantages of a ﬂat panel are as follows:
✦Requires less space and less power than a CRT
✦Has no geometric distortion
✦May deliver a sharper image
You can build a ﬂat panel display in several ways, of which the most common
are plasma panels and liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Plasma panels are used
in the relatively large ﬂat televisions now available, while LCDs dominate com-
puter applications.
LCDs and active matrix technology
Most LCD panels use the active matrix technology, with three transistors at
each pixel to control colors and a backlight to illuminate the entire array.
Figure 7-1 shows how the technology works. When the active matrix transis-
tors are off, the liquid crystal material blocks the transmission of the incident
light at the back of the cell (upper drawing). Each transistor in the cell (one
per color) can be turned on independently. When a transistor is turned on, it
reorients the liquid crystal material and allows white light to pass. A colored
ﬁlter in front of the transistor blocks all but one color, creating the usual red-
green-blue triad making up one pixel (lower drawing).
The LCD panel itself requires very little power, but the backlight requires
enough power to be a signiﬁcant drain in laptop applications. The LCD
requires a backlight for operation, and the mean time between failures (MTBF)
of the backlight is around 20,000 hours. Backlights are not generally replace-
able by users. If you use a ﬂat panel display for long periods, it’s quite likely
you’ll have to have the light replaced.
Changing the image on the display requires physical changes in the cells con-
trolled by the active matrix transistors, changes that slow down and ultimately
stop if the panel gets too cold.
Keeping the LCD image sharp
Most desktop LCD panels come with a standard VGA port to interface to
standard video display cards. The signals at the VGA port are analog, how-
ever, with their per-pixel timing implicit in the dot clock operating in the
video card. That approach works relatively well for CRTs because mistiming
simply spills the beam over into the next pixel, but can cause fuzziness on a
LCD, which has to reconstruct the digital signal to switch the active matrix
transistors.
94 Part III ✦Video

Figure 7-1: An active matrix LCD
Recognizing this limitation, Intel, Compaq (now HP), Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard,
IBM, NEC, and Silicon Image formed the Digital Display Working Group (DDWG)
to standardize a digital interface between PCs, consumer electronic devices,
and digital displays. The result of that work is the Digital Visual Interface (DVI)
speciﬁcation. DVI includes the Plug and Play features of the Display Data
Channel (DDC) interface for analog monitors (see the section “Display Data
Channel,” later in this chapter) and can support ﬂat panel resolutions up to
1920×1080 with the basic interface cable deﬁned in the speciﬁcation.
In a CRT, low-resolution formats simply extend the timing of each dot, allowing
the beam to cover multiple pixels. In an LCD, however, the dots are in ﬁxed
positions, and digital processing is required to display an image of lower reso-
lution than the panel’s native size display. The two ways to do this are:
✦Use part of the panel — You can display the smaller image using just
part of the panel, centering the image with an unused border. Each
dot occupies just one pixel on the panel, so the image is as sharp as
possible, but many pixels remain unused.
✦Scale the image to ﬁt the panel — Alternatively, you can resample the
image to create more pixels, interpolating between dots to generate
the intervening pixel data. The resampling approach uses all the pixels
on the display, but leaves the edges in the image somewhat fuzzy.

Either way, the image won’t be as large and as sharp as an image displayed
at the panel’s native resolution. It’s for that reason that some laptops warn
you about a loss of sharpness when you change the display resolution
down from its maximum setting. If you’re reducing the resolution to make
the text on the display larger, try using Windows’ large fonts setting instead
(Control Panel ➪Display ➪Settings ➪Advanced ➪General; it’s the Font
Size drop-down list).

LCD monitors are typically speciﬁed in terms of viewable diagonal, interfaces,
brightness, contrast, and viewing angle. Buying an LCD panel is much like buy-
ing a monitor — see the unit in operation and (assuming they’re all optimally
adjusted) look for the ones that are sharp and bright, with good color and con-
trast. Software such as DisplayMate (www.displaymate.com) can help you
evaluate LCDs (and CRTs) before you buy and help you tune your system for
peak video quality.
The Samsung line of desktop LCDs illustrates what you can get as of late 2003.
You can get LCD panels with both analog (VGA) and digital (DVI) inputs from
15 inches viewable diagonal measurement to 24 inches, and resolutions from
1024×768 to 1920×1200, respectively; and if you’re not on a limited budget,
they have a giant 40-inch model, too. LCD pricing is driven by the number of
pixels in the glass more than the size of the panel; in late 2003, the sweet spot
was the 17-, 18-, and 19-inch displays with 1280×1024 resolution. Street prices
for those models at that time were from $580 to $610, which isn’t much of a dif-
ference. Those prices will move down further, and as production methods and
96 Part III ✦Video

volumes improve, prices for even larger, higher resolution LCDs will come
down, too.
CRT Speciﬁcations and Measurements
Although less expensive, CRT monitors are more complex than LCDs. The tech-
nical characteristics that deﬁne your monitor’s performance are focus and con-
vergence; color balance, tracking, purity, and saturation; ghosting; and
geometry.
Focus and convergence
A CRT monitor uses triangles of three-color dots ﬁlling the screen (or lines
grouped in tri-color sets in the case of monitors using the Sony Trinitron tube).
How the beams inside the picture tube illuminate those dots determines how
well the monitor can generate crisp edges on what it draws, rather than blobs
with colored halos at the edges. Figure 7-3 shows how this works. The phos-
phors on the cathode ray tube (CRT) surface — the red, green, and blue
dots — are in groups of three called triads. Each triad has one corresponding
hole in the shadow mask. The hole keeps the beam from an electron gun from
illuminating the wrong color phosphors.
Figure 7-3: The shadow mask
Three separate electron beams exist: one for red, one for green, and one for
blue. All three go through the same hole in the shadow mask for the same
triad; but, because the electron guns are offset in a triangle around the center-
line of the CRT, the pattern of the beams through the shadow mask — the
“shadow” — is itself a triangle. If the beams from the electron guns are pre-
cisely focused, they project dots onto the phosphor layer no bigger than the
dots themselves, and don’t overlap onto adjacent triads. Lining up the individ-
ual beams through the shadow mask is called convergence. If the aim of the
electron beams onto the phosphors, through the shadow mask, is precise,
each beam illuminates only its own color dot. Misconvergence shows up as
miscolored edges on lines and in areas.

Chapter 7 ✦Monitors and Flat Panels 97

You see poor focus on the screen as fuzziness because adjacent triads get
some illumination from the beam and light up. A poorly focused monitor can’t
form a one-pixel edge.
Misconvergence and poor focus most often show up at the corners and edges
of the screen, or in the center if the corners and edges are right. Figure 7-4
shows why this happens. The extensive bend required in the electron beam 
to reach the sides and corners of the tube tends to distort the beam, which in
turn requires the electronics to adapt to correct the distortion. If the electron-
ics do this badly, they distort the beam in the center and force you to compro-
mise by setting the controls for a place between the center and the outside. 
As a result, neither area ends up in focus or well converged on the monitor.
Figure 7-4: Shorter CRTs make the electronics design harder.
The ﬂat-face CRTs now available further complicate the electronics because
the focal length from the electron gun varies as the beam sweeps both verti-
cally and horizontally, requiring additional controls to modulate the focus coils
correspondingly.
Another cause of poor image quality can be poor design of the shadow mask.
The electron beam carries a certain amount of power, some of which is
absorbed by the shadow mask. The shadow mask heats up as a result, which
can cause it to distort if it’s not well constructed. This means you’ll want to
look at a monitor’s performance after it’s been on for a while as well as when
it’s cold, and also when you have the brightness and contrast cranked up
(which increases the heat load on the shadow mask).
To reach dots at the outside and
corners of the screen, the electron
beam has to deflect at a relatively large
angle.  Maintaining uniform focus and
convergence from low to high
deflection angles is difficult, and
requires careful design in the
monitor electronics.

The brightness and contrast your monitor delivers is the result of a balanc-
ing act with the sharpness of focus and accuracy of convergence. A brighter
image is the result of more power in the electron beam, which is harder for
the electronics to control. This means that you should check focus and con-
vergence with the brightness at its maximum useful setting. This doesn’t
mean all the way up; it means at the brightest point you’d actually set it to.
For many monitors, that’s the point just before the black areas start to turn
gray, with the contrast adjusted to its maximum useful point. That’s as dif-
ﬁcult as it’s going to get for the monitor, so if it handles well at that adjust-
ment, it should be okay at lower levels as well.
Another important element to check on the monitor is its antiglare treatment
because different monitors have different antiglare treatments. Some use coat-
ings on the face of the CRT, some use lenses, and some roughen the face of the
CRT. Most antiglare approaches degrade the sharp focus a little, so you’ll want
to see how the manufacturer balanced these elements.
Color balance, tracking, purity, and saturation
Your eye is sensitive to color relationships. Skin tones that are off-color draw
your eye. A monitor needs to achieve good color balance to look right. It has
to maintain the correct intensity relationship between red, green, and blue.
The characteristics of the electronics in the monitor are such that the color
balance tends to vary with brightness. Having the monitor balance on a bright
image doesn’t mean that it will remain balanced on dark ones. The electronics
may not maintain good color tracking as the brightness varies. Check for bal-
ance both on bright areas and in dark grays because of this limitation. Your
video card may have adjustments for color balance, but overall you want the
monitor to get the balance and tracking right. Color balance on the video card
is most useful for adjustments to get screen and printer colors to correspond.
If the monitor is off-balance, you may not have the necessary range of adjust-
ments available.
Good color saturation means that colors are neither too strong, with similar
colors being indistinguishable, nor washed out and faded. The difference is the
same as when you run the color saturation control back and forth on a color
television. At one end, colors wash out to black and white, while at the other
end colors are sharply deﬁned like those on a poster, with no intermediate
color tones.
Color purity means that the colors on the screen are uniform everywhere, with
no patches of odd color. The most common causes of purity problems are
unwanted magnetic ﬁelds deﬂecting the beams on their way to the shadow
mask, through the shadow mask, and to the phosphors. This can happen two
ways: a device outside the monitor can create a magnetic ﬁeld that reaches
into the tube, or the shadow mask can become partially magnetized.
Chapter 7 ✦Monitors and Flat Panels 99

Incident static magnetic ﬁelds
A surprising number of things can create static magnetic ﬁelds, including power
transformers, telephones, speakers, and (of course) magnets. Don’t forget that
magnets and power transformers can be inside other objects. Their magnetic
ﬁelds can extend through an unshielded or poorly shielded equipment case
and into your monitor. If they do, one of two consequences can happen: you
get local discolorations, or you get a ripple in the image on the screen.
If the problem is a static magnetic ﬁeld, such as from a magnet or a speaker
(which contains a magnet), it can slowly magnetize the shadow mask (see
Figure 7-5). The problem is that the permanent magnet must provide a strong,
stable magnetic ﬁeld for the voice coils to push against. If the speaker isn’t
shielded, or is shielded poorly, that magnetic ﬁeld reaches outside the speaker.
If the speaker is placed too close to your monitor, it can reach into the CRT.
When that happens, it starts to magnetize the shadow mask. Magnetization of
the shadow mask can distort the color and the focus in the affected parts of
the tube.
Figure 7-5: Magnets in speakers can discolor or blur your monitor.
A device called a degaussing coil inside the monitor is wound around the tube
and activated every time you turn on the monitor. This device tries to neutral-
ize residual magnetization of the shadow mask by these constant ﬁelds, but it’s
only so strong and can do only so much. Over time, the shadow mask can

100 Part III ✦Video

acquire a local magnetic ﬁeld that discolors the display in that region. We’ve
also had the combination of a ﬁeld from speakers and the action of the
degaussing coil combine to leave no residual ﬁeld, so that when we removed
the speakers, discolorations appeared in the corners of the display that had
been near the speakers.
Your options are to use well-shielded speakers, or to keep the speakers well
away from the front of the CRT. The safe distance depends on the speaker and
on the shielding in the monitor itself. Moving the speakers to the back of the
monitor helps, as well as spacing them laterally away from the monitor case.
You can check a monitor for color-purity problems by looking at a pure
white screen. (For example, set the document background color to white,
open an empty document in Word, and use the View ➪Full Screen com-
mand. More comprehensive tests are available in DisplayMate.) If you see
patches of faint color, the monitor may need to be degaussed with a strong
degaussing coil. Degaussing is an operation involving passing a strong
alternating magnetic ﬁeld past the entire screen. Over tens of seconds, you
slowly move the coil far away from the tube and then turn it off. You can
get degaussing coils at larger electronics supply stores, or on the Internet —
search Google for degaussing coil. Follow the directions that come with the
coil carefully because you can make things worse if you use it improperly.
Incident dynamic ﬁelds
Varying magnetic ﬁelds too near your monitor can cause the image to be wavy.
A common source of such ﬁelds is power transformers: devices that use mag-
netic ﬁelds to shift power from one form to another. If you ﬁnd one part of the
display vibrating back and forth on the screen, look for other electronic com-
ponents (wall transformers, uninterruptible power supplies, boom boxes,
neighboring monitors in a multiple-monitor setup, and so forth) that are close
to the monitor and see what happens when you move them away.
Ghosting
As the electron beam sweeps along a line, the video ampliﬁers in the monitor
have to pass an intensity signal to the beam so that each pixel is painted at the
right intensity. If the bandwidth the video passes is too small, the intensity sig-
nal can’t change fast enough, producing ghosts — shadows and streaking of
the on-screen image. The strength of the ghost image depends on how intense
the original image is. A small change may not create a noticeable ghost, but a
black-to-white vertical edge can create highly noticeable shadows.
The relevant capability of the video ampliﬁer is called the maximum video
bandwidth and is typically in the range of 50 to 150 megahertz (MHz). An
acceptable maximum video bandwidth is implied by a manufacturer spec-
iﬁcation that the monitor will handle the resolution you want. To be sure
that it does meet your requirements, look at a maximum-resolution display
with alternating black and white bars. If you see ghosting (and the monitor
cable hasn’t been extended), the video bandwidth is inadequate and you
should ﬁnd another monitor.
Chapter 7 ✦Monitors and Flat Panels 101

You can also cause ghosting by using a cable that’s too long or is of poor qual-
ity. Capacitance in the cable slows the rise and fall of the video signals, leading
to ghosts. Cables that are too long can have too much capacitance because the
effect increases with the cable length; poor quality cables (even short ones)
can have too much capacitance because every foot adds more capacitance
than for high quality ones.
Geometric distortion
For the image you see onscreen to look right, it has to be geometrically cor-
rect, straight, even, and ﬂat. Figure 7-6 shows the distortions CRT monitors are
prone to creating. (LCDs have the pixels in physically ﬁxed positions, so these
distortions can’t happen.) Each of the problems in Figure 7-6 can be corrected
with the right electronics and adjustments on the front of the monitor, but if
your monitor doesn’t provide the controls you need, you’re stuck with what-
ever it does on its own. Monitor test software like DisplayMate is useful for
adjusting geometric distortions because it displays test patterns that allow
you to see and remove these errors.
Figure 7-6: Geometric distortion
Controls
There’s no apparent consensus on what controls you really need on a monitor.
Some monitors have only contrast and brightness controls, and others have 
a complete set of controls letting you adjust everything. You can ﬁnd controls
with simple, clear layouts, and ones that would leave a genius hard pressed to
ﬁgure out how to use them. A great image is more important than great con-
trols, but the controls may be what you need to get the image you want.
Pincushion
Trapezoid
Rotation
Linearity
Pincushion distortion means the edges of 
the display image curve in or out, rather 
than being straight.
Trapezoid distortion means that the top and 
bottom of the display widths are not the 
same.
Rotational distortion means that the raster 
scan lines tilt up or down, rather than being 
flat.
Linearity means that pixels are evenly 
spaced and in the proper proportion. 
Circles will be circles, not ovals. 
Parallelogram
Parallelogram distortion causes the top and 
bottom edges of the raster to be laterally 
offset from each other. 
102 Part III ✦Video

A good monitor stores control settings independently for each resolution, so
you don’t have to keep readjusting the controls. The typical controls you ﬁnd
on CRT monitors include:
✦Horizontal size and position — This control adjusts the width of the
raster on the screen and lets you center the image laterally. You’ll 
ﬁnd that both the horizontal and vertical characteristics of the image
change as you change display resolution and refresh rate, so you need
these controls to compensate. You’ll also ﬁnd that the horizontal and
vertical settings interact with each other, so get them both close to
right before trying to set them to their ﬁnal positions.
✦Vertical size and position — These controls are similar to the ones
for horizontal size and position, letting you set the height and top-to-
bottom position.
✦Pincushion — A pincushion control lets you vary the bulge or tuck
at the side of the raster. The setting applies to all resolutions and
refresh rates. Be sure that you have the horizontal and vertical set-
tings right before you adjust pincushion; otherwise, you’re almost
guaranteed to get the setting wrong.
Be careful how you decide if the edges are straight. The bezel of the
monitor surrounding the tube is not always itself straight, so it may
not work well for this process. What you use can be as simple as a
piece of paper folded to make a straight edge. Be sure the image dis-
played on the screen completely ﬁlls the screen. A maximized win-
dow works because you can use the window frame as the reference
line that should be straight.
✦Tilt, rotation, and trapezoid — These controls work in the same way
as the pincushion control, but they relate to other distortions. The
same caution applies about getting the horizontal and vertical set-
tings right ﬁrst. You’re also likely to notice that the four settings
interact some, so you might have to adjust them several times before
you get it right.
✦Color temperature — If you’ve ever played with a light dimmer,
you’ve probably noticed that as the light gets dimmer, it gets redder,
and as it gets brighter, it gets bluer. This change in color, which
affects the perceived color of objects illuminated by the light, corre-
sponds to a change in the temperature of the ﬁlament in the light, or
what’s called the color temperature. Color temperature is measured
in degrees Kelvin — relative to absolute zero — with lower tempera-
tures giving redder colors. Monitors with color temperature adjust-
ments provide settings for several standard temperatures, such as
9300 and 6500 degrees Kelvin, and may provide a user-deﬁned set-
ting. The color temperature interacts some with color balance
(which you normally adjust on the video card, if at all) because the
effect is to alter the balance between red and blue.
The color temperature can be very important if you’re doing critical
color matching to make sure that the results you get on the screen
correspond to what you scan and what you print; otherwise, it’s a
matter of personal preference.
Chapter 7 ✦Monitors and Flat Panels 103

✦Brightness and contrast — Although most of the other controls on a
monitor correspond to those a service technician sets on a television,
the brightness and contrast are exactly the same as you’re used to.
The two controls interact somewhat and have limited range on some
monitors. It’s common to adjust the contrast at around 80 percent of
the full range (or more), with brightness just below the point where
the raster outside the image appears, but many people ﬁnd this set-
ting too harsh. The setting you use is personal preference, inﬂuenced
by the lighting and other characteristics of where you work.
✦Degauss — In the same way that magnetic ﬁelds from speakers and
transformers can leave the shadow mask with residual magnetism, so
can other weaker ﬁelds. Most monitors have a coil wound around the
tube near the front, called a degaussing coil, that is used to remove
these effects. When you turn the monitor on, a strong alternating cur-
rent in the coil produces a strong alternating magnetic ﬁeld that pen-
etrates the tube and slightly magnetizes the shadow mask, ﬁrst one
way and then the other. Over several seconds, the monitor reduces
the current, reducing the ﬁeld strength as it alternates back and
forth. By the time the ﬁeld reaches zero, the process leaves the
shadow mask completely demagnetized.
There’s a limit to the strength of the degaussing coil, partly due to
the relatively large current ﬂowing through it. That current generates
a lot of heat, too much of which will destroy the coil. For this reason,
if your monitor has a manual control to energize the coil, you don’t
want to use it too often. Waiting several minutes between activations
should be long enough. If the built-in degaussing coil can’t clear the
problem after a few tries, you probably need to go get a stronger coil.
Another useful control feature is the capability for the monitor to display the
current horizontal and vertical frequencies. Most current monitor designs will
blank when they see an invalid signal. Many units will also blank when they
see a signal they can’t handle. You want that feature to make sure a misconﬁg-
ured video card can’t damage the monitor.
Multimedia Monitors
It’s become fashionable to build speakers into monitors and offer them at
higher prices as multimedia products. The same strategy seems to apply to
power controllers (devices you put under the monitor that have switches to
control the power for different peripherals) and keyboards.
We don’t recommend buying these products. Packaging the speaker into the
monitor ensures that its magnetic ﬁeld is as close to the display tube as possi-
ble. Even if the manufacturer shields it well, you’re starting out with a difﬁcult
problem. Speakers in monitors tend to use smaller magnets and ampliﬁers, and
so have limited bass response. Speakers in power controllers and keyboards
suffer from limited size, making it hard to get good sound, too.
You can also get speakers that are designed to hang from either side of your
monitor. Mounting them there ensures they’re right where they can cause the
104 Part III ✦Video

most trouble, up near the shadow mask and as close as possible to the tube. 
If you need that arrangement to maximize desk space, make sure you choose
units that move the low-frequency drivers into a subwoofer you can put some-
where else. If you can’t do that, it’s better to space your speakers somewhat
away from and toward the back of the monitor (or on the wall).
Display Data Channel
The Display Data Channel (DDC) is a way for your computer to get information
about your monitor — CRT or LCD — and its capabilities. DDC-compatible
monitors can feed that information to a DDC-capable video card, which in turn
forwards the information to your operating system. Windows knows how to
use DDC information if you set up your monitor as Plug and Play compatible;
Linux may not. Plug and Play software can detect and conﬁgure your monitor
automatically, simplifying setup.
There are three levels of DDC implementation, DDC1, DDC2B, and DDC2AB, as
shown in Figure 7-7A through 7-7C, respectively. All three let the monitor send
data in a speciﬁc format to the computer, making it possible for Plug and Play
software to detect what the monitor is and conﬁgure the video card appropri-
ately. The DDC2AB version also lets the computer send commands to the mon-
itor, allowing software to set the monitor controls just as you would from the
front panel controls.
Figure 7-7: The three levels of DDC implementation
The DDCI interface lets the monitor
continuously transmit information about
its capabilities.  The data always comes
in a specific format — the computer
can't stop it or control it.
Monitor data
The DDC2B interface can't control the
monitor, but it allows the computer to
request one of two data formats for the
information continuously transmitted by
the monitor.  The data clock signal adds
this capability, and allows the computer
to control the data transmission from
the monitor.

Chapter 7 ✦Monitors and Flat Panels 105

Making DDC work requires both the monitor and video card to be DDC-capable,
but results in a fully Plug and Play video subsystem.
Choosing a Monitor
We recommend monitors 17 inches or larger. LCDs should have native resolu-
tion no less than 1280×1024; CRTs should have a dot pitch no greater than 0.28
millimeters. The added screen space you get from the higher resolution those
monitors provide lets you work more effectively. You can ﬁnd CRT monitors
with worse dot pitch, such as the 0.31 millimeter dot pitch 20-inch unit we once
saw advertised as a “corporate grade” unit. If you do the side-by-side compari-
son with higher-quality monitors, you’ll quickly see the loss of sharpness and
understand why working with one of these units can be uncomfortable.
People with vision impairments that require they use large screens in the
minimum possible resolution should use CRT monitors, not LCDs, because
a CRT gives you a sharper image at low resolutions.
Glare off the screen and directly in your eyes can make an image hard to look
at no matter how you adjust the display. Try to avoid the situations illustrated
in Figures 7-8A and 7-8B to keep glare to a minimum. Light shining directly on
the screen or in your eyes reduces contrast and can make working very
uncomfortable. Figure 7-8C shows more desirable arrangements.

This setup doesn't work either, because light
reflects off the monitor screen as glare.
Either of these two (window on
the left or right) can work,
depending on how bright the
light is, because the light is not in
your eyes, and when it reflects off
the monitor, the angles are such
that the reflection is not in your eye.
This setup doesn't work, because to
see the monitor you have to stare into
the bright light coming past the monitor.

Summary
✦LCD monitors need fewer adjustments than CRT monitors, but can
lose quality at lower image sizes than the native display panel size.
✦A monitor with a comprehensive set of controls can be made to per-
form better than the same monitor with few controls.
✦Most users will do well with a good quality 17- to 19-inch monitor.
Some types of work beneﬁt from larger monitors and, therefore,

any technologies go into building the high-per-
formance disk drives we use. They include the
magnetic effects that pack data onto the platters, the
design and construction of the heads themselves, the
precision with which the platters themselves are built,
and the electronics that turn small signals off the disk
heads into data for your computer.
As interesting as they are, however, these don’t matter
from the standpoint of choosing the disk products you’ll
put in your computer. What you really care about are
capacity, performance, reliability, and price. The large
volume of disks manufactured and sold to the personal
computer market ensures that you can base your buy-
ing decisions on actual ﬁeld experience, not projections,
so the underlying technology is less important than
what’s being delivered in users’ machines.
Disks all use a common geometrical layout, as in Figure
8-1. They record data on magnetized platters at pre-
cisely deﬁned head positions. At each position, each
head traces out a track as the disk rotates. Tracks are
divided into units of data, called sectors, that can be
individually read and written. All the tracks at a single
head position collectively form a cylinder.

Capacity is reasonably straightforward: It’s how many gigabytes the disk holds.
You have to be careful to look at the capacity of the drive after it’s been for-
matted (which is what most drive manufacturers specify). The formatting
operation eats up space for sector addresses, space between sectors, and the
like, and that’s space you can’t get at or use. Disk manufacturers most com-
monly specify capacity as the formatted capacity of the drive, but divide by
1,000,000,000 to convert to gigabytes, not 1,073,741,824 (1,024×1,024×1,024) as
do Windows and UNIX. A 200GB drive sold by the manufacturer will report as
186.26GB when you look at it through the operating system.
In case you’re wondering, the number 1,024 shows up in a lot of computer-
related places because it’s the power of 2 closest to 1,000.

Disk Drive Performance
The most important factor in disk drive performance is throughput on and off
the disk, as measured in your PC. That’s not possible for manufacturers to
measure, so they specify a number of parameters you can use to estimate the
performance you’ll see:
✦Sustained throughput — For reasonably large transfers, such as
loading programs from disk or reading/writing the swap ﬁle, disk per-
formance is limited by the sustained throughput onto or off the disk
itself. The rotation rate of the disk times the number of sectors per
track determines the sustained throughput.
✦Seek and rotational latency — For short transfers of data not in the
disk cache, the performance you get is determined by the time it
takes to move the head to the right cylinder and for the right sector
to rotate under the heads. A faster rotation rate reduces the rota-
tional latency.
✦Cache buffer size — The cache buffer on the drive can strongly
affect the performance you get. Predicting the effect of different
cache sizes is hard, but you can assume in general that a bigger
cache is better as long as you remember this is not always true.
The sustained throughput in bytes per second is the number of bytes in a sec-
tor times the number of sectors per track times the track rotations per second.
The data sheet for the 200GB Seagate Barracuda (which spins at 7,200 RPM)
explicitly speciﬁes the average sustained transfer rate, listing it as greater than
58 megabytes per second. That number is amazing when you consider that
only a few years ago you had to exercise care to get a disk fast enough for
video recording at 4 to 8 megabytes per second.
Disk manufacturers sometimes don’t specify the sustained throughput of the
disk explicitly, but if some other speciﬁcations are available, you can calculate
it. The average sustained transfer rate equals the rotation rate times average
sectors per track times 512 bytes per sector. Disk manufacturers put more sec-
tors on the outer tracks of the platter (because they’re larger and have more
space), so there’s no one number for sectors per track. You can use the mini-
mum number, the maximum, or the average. As long as you compare rates you
compute consistently, it doesn’t matter.
Chapter 8 ✦Hard Disks and Disk Arrays 113

For small transfers, the time to get the heads positioned over the right sector
is much larger than the time to actually transfer the data. The drawing in
Figure 8-2 shows the timeline for a disk access and, by the length of the seg-
ment, indicates that the positioning time can be enormously longer than the
actual transfer time. The average seek time is commonly speciﬁed by the disk
manufacturer and depends on the physical design of the heads and the actua-
tor mechanism that mounts and moves the heads. The lighter (and by implica-
tion smaller) the heads and mechanism, the faster they can start and stop
moving, and the smaller the seek time will be.
Figure 8-2: The time to transfer small data blocks is essentially 
the time to position the heads over the data.
The rotational latency isn’t always speciﬁed, but if you know the rotation rate,
you can calculate the delay. On average, the disk is positioned one half of a
revolution away from the data you want, in which case the average rotational
latency is one half of the rotation time. For a typical 7,200 RPM drive, the rota-
tion time is about 8.3 ms (calculated as the reciprocal of the rotation rate), so
the average rotational latency is half the rotation time, or about 4.2 ms in our
example. If the average seek time is 9 ms, the total average access time — the
time it takes from when the drive gets the command to read to when it starts
delivering data — is the sum of the two, or 13.2 ms.
The access time is a useful number because it lets you predict the random
access performance of the drive. The 13.2 ms access implies that you can do
about 76 random transfers per second because you have about 76 13.2 ms
intervals in 1 second, and you’re assuming all the time is taken by the seeks. 
If you’re transferring single sectors at 512 bytes per transfer, that’s a transfer
rate of only 38KB per second, which is pretty awful. Even though Windows
transfers a cluster at a time, which would typically be 4KB on a drive like this,
a database program might use only one sector in the cluster. If that’s true, the
additional data transferred is wasted, and the 38KB per second represents
usable data transfer.
This analysis shows why the operating system disk cache is so critical and
why the value of a disk cache goes up as the size of the reads your programs
do goes down. Operating systems dynamically size the disk cache in memory

based on disk activity and on how much memory your programs need. If pro-
grams need all the available memory, the cache can get too small, and per-
formance can drop precipitously. You have to have more memory than just
what your programs are speciﬁed to require if there’s going to be room for the
cache — that’s part of why more memory can provide a signiﬁcant perform-
ance boost to machines with limited memory.
Disk Drive Reliability
If you go looking at disk drive data sheets, you’ll see that manufacturers no
longer boast Mean time between failures (MTBF) speciﬁcations in the product
data sheets. Nevertheless, if you search their Web sites, you’ll see more detailed
product speciﬁcations and ﬁnd MTBF values from 500,000 to 1,500,000 hours. 
If you leave the drive powered up and running all the time, this is between 57
and 170 years.
No one is likely to use the same disk that long, so it’s worth asking why anyone
worries about disk failures. MTBF is really only a measure of the probability
that a device will fail, one you can use to estimate how likely it is that the
device will run for a speciﬁed amount of time without failure. The conversion
from MTBF to probability of failure is not an obvious computation; Figure 8-3
shows the probability a device will survive a stated length of time for different
MTBF values. For example, the probability that a disk with an MTBF of 1,200,000
hours will go 5 years without a failure is over 96 percent. Said differently, if you
have a large number of these drives, after 5 years you can expect nearly one
drive in 25 to have failed. In practice, you’ll probably do better than that
because these calculations assume the drive is powered on 24 hours a day.
Figure 8-3: The MTBF speciﬁcation lets you estimate the probability a device will last
a speciﬁed lifetime.

Chapter 8 ✦Hard Disks and Disk Arrays 115

If you conclude from this analysis that eventually you’re going to see a hard
disk failure, you’re undoubtedly right. (Yes, now might be a good time to go
back up your computer if you can’t remember when you did it last. Check that
your restores work, too.) Rare as they are, disk failures are some of the worst
computer failures from a lost time standpoint, because in addition to the time
it takes you to diagnose the problem and replace the drive, you have to ﬁnd
the backups, restore them, and worry about the data that wasn’t backed up.
If you knew a drive was going to fail, though, you could grab the important
ﬁles before it died. The Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology
(SMART) helps you do that, monitoring critical drive performance parameters
in the disk’s controller. When one of the parameters degrades past a threshold,
the drive reports out to your computer that a failure may be pending. That
report is your warning to back up data carefully and replace the drive. Figure
8-4 shows how a drive that monitors the height the head ﬂies above the platter
responds to variations in ﬂying height. If the height gets too high, the signal
the head generates weakens and the error rate off the drive skyrockets. If the
head gets too low, it hits the surface and damages the drive. The dotted lines
in the ﬁgure represent the alert thresholds, at which the drive reports it has a
problem.
Figure 8-4: Measuring variations in head 
ﬂying height helps predict disk failures.

Other typical characteristics SMART watches include data throughput of the
drive; time for the drive to spin up to operating speed; the number of sectors
declared defective during operation and remapped to other, good sectors; and
the frequency with which errors occur while the heads are seeking a new posi-
tion. SMART is not infallible — disk failures can occur on a SMART drive with-
out warning because there are both predictable and unpredictable failures.
Predictable failures are preceded by gradual degradation of some parameter
before the failure and are more common for mechanical failures in the drive.
According to Seagate, 60 percent of drive failures are for mechanical reasons,
so in practice, SMART gives good coverage of coming trouble.

Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks
(RAID)
Capacity, reliability, and performance are important for ﬁle servers or other
machines where you’re storing large or important ﬁles. Disk drives are vulnera-
ble to failure, though, and when they do fail, data written since the last backup
is lost. Disks have limitations on how fast they can go, although disk speed is
only a limitation for heavily loaded servers.
Suppose you, like us, make DVDs instead of video tapes of your favorite shows.
We record uncompressed video at about 13.5GB per 1-hour show, editing it
down to 9.5GB before compressing it onto DVD. The total space is therefore
23GB per hour. The biggest drives available always come at premium prices,
but you can buy 80GB drives readily at good prices. Unfortunately, you’ll get
less than 4 hours on an 80GB drive before you have to start making DVDs.
You can get much greater capacities, avoid losing data from disk failure, and
do all that at reasonable cost using a technology called Redundant Array of
Inexpensive Disks (RAID), invented at the University of California at Berkeley
by D. A. Patterson, G. Gibson, and R. H. Katz. The industry also uses the
phrase Redundant Array of Independent Disks, so you’ll probably see both.
RAID uses conventional disks with specialized host adapters to change how
data goes onto your disk.
What RAID does
The idea behind RAID is to take the conventional disks in personal computers
and gang them together in parallel. The resulting assembly gives you the low
cost of disks manufactured in high volume plus good reliability and a multi-
plier on the performance of individual disks. Figure 8-5 shows how this works.
The host adapter (frequently called a controller in RAID systems) sits between
one high-rate data stream (on the computer side) and several lower-rate
streams (on the disk side). When the computer writes to the disk, the host
adapter takes high-rate data and breaks it into multiple synchronized streams,
one for each disk, in a process called striping. Reads by the computer cause
the host adapter to take a data stream from each disk, multiplex the set of
streams into one stream, and send that resulting stream on to the computer. In
the example of Figure 8-5, the one high-speed stream splits into four separate
disk data streams at one-fourth the rate of the combined stream.
A RAID controller can also insert error correction codes. In an eight-disk RAID
system, for example, you can add a ninth disk to hold nothing but error correc-
tion information. Any of the disks in a system built that way can fail without
loss of data. When you replace the failed disk, most RAID controllers can recon-
struct the contents of the disk from the surviving ones. Until that process is
complete, however, your data is vulnerable to a second failure. Nor does RAID
eliminate the need for backup. RAID cannot protect you, for example, from a
catastrophic software (or user) error that destroys your ﬁle systems or deletes
important ﬁles. You need removable backup media as well as reliable storage
for irreplaceable ﬁles.
Chapter 8 ✦Hard Disks and Disk Arrays 117

Figure 8-5: RAID arrays can give you vast amounts of 
storage and great reliability.
RAID levels
There are six different levels of RAID functionality. The simplest RAID system,
RAID level 0, merely stripes the data onto multiple disks for better perform-
ance. There is no overhead for redundant data storage and no protection
against failure. The highest level is RAID 5, which provides both striping for
performance and redundancy for failure protection.
RAID level 0
RAID 0 was not part of the original RAID speciﬁcation by Patterson et al, but
instead was created by the industry to meet user needs. RAID level 0 spreads
the data stream across multiple disks, as in Figure 8-6. You can get a similar
effect to that of RAID 0 by having multiple disks and can use features in
Windows 2000 or Windows XP to simulate RAID in the operating system.
Suppose your computer sends a sequence of data to a RAID 0 host adapter con-
nected to two disks. The host adapter will interleave the data to the two drives,
sending odd blocks to one drive and even blocks to the other. The block size is
up to the host adapter and can be a byte, a sector, or some other size.
Because the data volume and rate to any speciﬁc disk is a fraction of the aggre-
gate, you get better capacity and performance from RAID 0 than from a single
conventional disk. There is no error correction or redundant data written to the
array, however, so RAID 0 cannot survive a disk failure. You would use RAID 0
only in situations where you needed the capacity or performance gain, but not
the enhanced data reliability. Be certain about the reliability issue, however —
suppose you have a RAID 0 array of four 80GB drives that’s full, and you lose one
of the drives. You haven’t lost 80GB of data; you’ve lost 320GB because your data
was spread across all four drives and you have no way to reconstruct the ﬁles.
Host adapter
118 Part IV ✦Storage

Figure 8-6: RAID 0 offers better performance than conventional disk setups, but
does not enhance reliability.
The performance of RAID 0 is usually better for long reads and writes than
short random requests because the rotation of the individual disks isn’t syn-
chronized. When the processor starts a read operation, for example, data can’t
start to arrive from the controller until all the disks rotate to the proper sector.
The access time is therefore not the average, but the worst case position of all
the disks in the array. A large cache memory on the RAID controller partially
masks the effect.
You’ll see in Chapter 25 how to set up a RAID 0 array in a desktop machine
using two serial ATA drives and hardware built into the Intel D875PBZ mother-
board. We’ve measured sequential read performance on that system in excess
of 60MB per second on that hardware, and sequential writes at over 70MB per
second.
RAID level 1
In the same way that RAID 0 focuses solely on capacity and performance with
no concession to reliability, RAID 1 focuses on reliable data storage with no
concession to capacity or performance. RAID 1, also called disk mirroring, uses
disks in pairs with both disks of a pair storing the identical data. The redundant
copy protects your data against hardware failures, but you’re still vulnerable
to user error deleting important ﬁles.
Figure 8-7 shows how RAID 1 works. Suppose your computer sends a sequence
of data to the RAID 1 host adapter connected to two disks. The host adapter
will write all the data to each of the two drives. The identical data is stored on
both drives, so if one fails, the data is still available. The operation completes
when both drives have written the data, so the write can take longer than for
one disk alone because of delays for unsynchronized rotation and for I/O bus
contention.
A smart host adapter can make RAID 1 faster for read operations than conven-
tional systems because it can read data from either disk. If the operating system
makes multiple read requests at the same time, the host adapter can have two
reads in process at the same time, allowing the seek and rotational latency of
the drives to overlap each other and delivering two operations worth of data
after a single latency delay.

Chapter 8 ✦Hard Disks and Disk Arrays 119

Figure 8-7: RAID 1 offers better reliability than RAID 0 or conventional disk setups,
but does not increase performance.
RAID 1 is also supported by software in Windows 2000 and Windows XP, using
a pair of disks as mirrors and doing all operations to both at the same time.
The load on the processor, memory, and bus is higher, but otherwise the two
approaches are very similar. Whether you implement mirroring in hardware or
software, you pay twice for the disk capacity you need.
RAID level 2, level 3, and level 4
RAID 2 adds one or more disks to hold an error correction code with which
lost data from a failed disk can be reconstructed. Figure 8-8 shows how the
data ﬂows in a RAID 2 system. When your computer sends a sequence of data
to a RAID 2 host adapter connected to two data disks and an ECC disk, the
host adapter interleaves the data to the two data drives. Odd blocks go to one
drive, and even to the other. The host adapter computes the error correction
code for the data written to the data drives and writes it to the ECC drive.
RAID 5 is invariably used instead of RAID 2, however, because it offers lower
overhead and better performance.
RAID 3 is the same as RAID 2, except that it uses a simpler code — parity
instead of ECC. RAID 3 has the same small-transfer performance limitations of
RAID 2, but less storage overhead.
RAID 4 is nearly the same as RAID 3, but instead of striping across disks at 
the byte level, it operates at the sector level. This makes RAID 4 like RAID 2 
(Figure 8-8) except that it uses parity rather than ECC, and it interleaves sec-
tors. RAID 4 therefore has good data reliability and storage efﬁciency, as do
RAID 2 and 3, and retains fast writes for large data blocks. RAID 4 does not
require synchronized spindles because it’s easy to buffer sectors and write
them out independently to all the drives. Multiple independent writes mean

the I/O operations are processed in parallel, which in turn means that small
writes can be faster. Unsynchronized rotation can slow reads for small data
blocks.
Figure 8-8: RAID 2 offers better reliability than RAID 0 or conventional disk setups,
and has a smaller storage overhead compared to RAID 1.
RAID level 5
RAID 5 is the same as RAID 4, except that instead of dedicating a single disk to
storing parity, the parity data stream is striped across all the disks along with
the rest of the streams. Figure 8-9 shows how this works. Suppose your com-
puter sends a sequence of data to a RAID 5 host adapter connected to four
disks. The host adapter interleaves the data to the drives, ensuring that no one
drive ever holds two blocks of a group protected by a parity block. The host
adapter inserts the new parity information in the data stream that it sends to
the disks, mixing the parity information in with the original data. As long as
there is at least one more disk than there are original data streams, the loss of
a disk can take out only one data stream, and so parity is enough to regenerate
the lost data.
There are other RAID levels deﬁned by speciﬁc companies, as well as combina-
tions of levels. RAID 0/1, for example, is striping (as with RAID 0) that is mir-
rored on a duplicate set of disks (as with RAID 1). This combination gives you
the speed of RAID 0 with the data reliability of RAID 1, but carries the high
storage overhead of RAID 1, too.

Adding a Disk Drive
The key to upgrading your computer by adding disk drives is planning —
thinking through the physical, electrical, performance, and software issues
before you order parts and pick up your tools.
✦Physical — The most basic decision is whether the drive will be
internal or external to your computer. ATA drives must be internal.
External USB drives are subject to getting banged around, but can be
readily moved from one computer to another if they’re all running
Windows 2000 or Windows XP. You may be constrained in connec-
tions to your host adapter — ATA cables, for example, can be no
more than 18 inches long (less for badly designed controllers that
don’t properly split the primary and secondary channels). We once
built a machine in a full-size tower case with a motherboard whose
IDE ports were in the middle of the motherboard. That positioning,
combined with the 18-inch cable limit, meant that we couldn’t put
IDE drives in the upper bays of the case.
If the drive will be internal, think about both cooling and cabling. If
you have the option, leave air space around the drive, and choose a
drive bay where it will be in the air ﬂow. For instance, some cases
have drive bays low near the air inlet. Putting the drive there should
give it the best cooling possible. If you’re concerned about heat, con-
sider sticking a CPU cooling fan on the drive. Be sure to mount the
drive so there’s solid metal contact between the drive bay and the
drive so heat has a good path away from the drive. Figure 8-10 shows
an internal drive installed in a 3.5-inch form factor mounting bracket,
using the lower position on the mounting bracket to ensure good air-
ﬂow over the top of the drive.

Figure 8-10: Position drives in mounting brackets so they’ll get good air
ﬂow and heat conduction.
You can see in Figure 8-11 that the drive is positioned in the case just
under the power supply, so the lower mounting position keeps the
drive away from heat coming from there. We also positioned the drive
as far into the bracket as possible to get the most metal-to-metal con-
tact and improve the bracket’s ability to conduct heat away from the
drive and keep the disk assembly and electronics cool. Don’t ever use
a non-metallic mounting bracket on a disk drive because you’ll lose
the cooling from conducted heat through the bracket. Some cases
work only with non-metallic brackets and therefore may have cooling
problems before you even start assembling a system into them.
Figure 8-11: Choose positions within mounting brackets to get the best
service access within the chassis.
Chapter 8 ✦Hard Disks and Disk Arrays 123

✦Electrical — You have to get power and the data cable to the drive. 
If you don’t plan both the sequence in which drives sit on the cable
and the routing of the power feed, you’ll end up with a rat’s nest that
makes working on the computer difﬁcult. Put the ATA master on the
end of the cable. Each parallel IDE port you use must have a master
and may have a slave. You can have a master on both ports and
slave on none, on either, or on both (see Table 8-2).
Table 8-2
Parallel ATA Master/Slave Combination Requirements
Primary
Secondary
Master
OK

✦Performance — You have two (primary and secondary) parallel ATA
channels on virtually all motherboards, letting you connect up to
four drives. Newer motherboards provide serial ATA, but typically
have ports only for two drives.
If you’re using parallel ATA and have only two hard disks, make each
one a master, putting one on each of the two IDE ports. If you have a
hard disk and a CD-ROM, make the hard disk the master on the pri-
mary IDE port and the CD-ROM the master on the secondary port. If
you have two hard disks and a CD-ROM, put both hard disks on the
primary port, isolating the CD-ROM on the secondary port. The gen-
eral strategy is to group faster devices together and away from slower
ones. The idea behind splitting two hard drives (if that’s all you’re
connecting) is that it gives the operating system the option to deal
with the two independently.
Unless your motherboard has speciﬁc restrictions, you can mix par-
allel and serial ATA. The two run independently.
✦Software — After you get the disk installed, you may need to tell the
BIOS about it. You’ll mostly want to use the automatic detection and
conﬁguration settings of the BIOS to set that up. After the drive is
recognized by the BIOS, you partition and format the drive from
within the operating system.
Top Disk Support Questions
Disks seem to generate more confusion than any other single part of a com-
puter. That’s probably because a lot of things come together on the disk drive:
the BIOS, the operating system, the bus, the host adapter, other drives, the
case, and the power supply. That leaves room for a lot of things to go wrong.
124 Part IV ✦Storage

Q: How should I set up my IDE drive?
A: The settings the BIOS offers differs among systems, but typically you’ll want
to set the BIOS CMOS Hard Disk type to “Auto Conﬁgured” and IDE Translation
Mode to “Auto Detected.” If there’s a choice, use “Large Block Addressing.”
After you do that, you should be able to boot and have the BIOS recognize the
drive with the correct capacity. You’ll then partition the disk using FDISK or
something like PowerQuest’s PartitionMagic if you’re working in Windows 9X,
or using the tools built into Windows 2000 and Windows XP. If you’re installing
a new drive, you should consider deleting any existing partitions and creating
a new partition to make sure things start clean and properly coordinated
between BIOS and drive. Remember that deleting partitions deletes all the data
they contain beyond recovery by normal means.
Q: What can I do to make my IDE drive (from an old system) work with my new
motherboard?
A: Many older PC BIOSes supported only the older cylinder-head-sector style
addressing for IDE disk drives, instead of large block mode, even if the IDE 
drive itself was capable of supporting the more advanced mode. When a more
advanced IDE drive is connected to a motherboard with a BIOS capable of 
supporting the more advanced mode, the drive will tell the system which 
translation modes it is capable of supporting. Unfortunately, the drive does not
tell the BIOS which mode was being used when the drive was originally format-
ted, just what it’s capable of. If a mismatch occurs between the old mode and
what the newer BIOS picks, the disk drive may exhibit problems when used
(including what looks like scrambled or missing data). There are two possible
solutions:
1. Force the new system to use CHS Translation Mode. To do this, set up
the BIOS Hard Disk type to “Auto Detected” and the IDE Translation
Mode to “CHS.” If your data is now present without corruption, you
should be okay; otherwise, you’ll need step 2.
2. Put the drive back with the old motherboard, back it up, connect it
to the new motherboard, and reformat the disk drive to use a more
advanced translation mode. All data on the hard drive will be lost
(which is the point of the backup — be sure to verify the backup
before you reformat).
Q: I installed a huge new ATA drive, but not all its capacity shows up, or I can’t
boot from it. Can’t I use a large ATA drive with my motherboard?
A: Older motherboards may impose ATA hard drive size limitations at several
capacity points. Connecting a drive larger than is supported to one of these
systems may cause the drive not to be recognized by the BIOS or by your
operating system’s partitioning utility. If the hard drive is a master in a master/
slave conﬁguration, the system may freeze during boot. Many hard drive manu-
facturers supply a utility (such as Seagate Disk Wizard, Microhouse EZ-Drive,
and Ontrack Disk Manager) that solves problems accessing the full capacity 
of the hard drive with Windows 9X. For systems running Windows 2000 or
Windows XP, you’ll probably need to either update the motherboard BIOS or
Chapter 8 ✦Hard Disks and Disk Arrays 125

see if the drive offers backwards compatibility jumper settings. Check the
capacity you get using compatibility jumpers because the older system simply
may not be able to see the entire disk.

ing to access large drives. Overall, you’re much better off with Windows 2000

completely different scheme to identify drives and the space on them). DOS
assigns drive letters to all primary partitions and then to all logical drives in
extended partitions. For example, suppose you have two drives set up as in
Table 8-4. The ﬁrst primary partition on the ﬁrst physical drive is C; the ﬁrst
primary partition on the second physical drive is D. Next, the logical drives are
labeled, covering ﬁrst the logical drives on the ﬁrst physical drive (E, F) and
then the logical drives on the second physical drive (G, H). Your CD-ROM and
any removable drives are assigned the next available drive letters after your
hard drive partitions.
Windows 9x follows the DOS scheme for drive letters. Windows 2000 and
Windows XP follow the DOS scheme by default, but in some cases let you use
the Disk Administrator tool to change the letter assigned to speciﬁc drives.
For any of these operating systems, you can use only drive letters from A to Z

Q: What will happen to my CD-ROM drive letter if I create a new partition or
add a new drive?
A: If you consume the drive letter previously assigned to the CD-ROM drive,
the CD-ROM gets assigned the next available drive letter after your hard drive
partitions. You can prevent the CD-ROM drive letter from changing in the
future by assigning it a higher drive letter to begin with (such as M or N), cre-
ating some unused letters between the last hard disk and the ﬁrst CD-ROM.
Q: Can I install Windows 9x on the same disk as Windows 2000 or Windows XP?
A: You cannot install Windows 9x in the same folder (directory) that holds
Windows 2000 or Windows XP, but you can install it to the same disk in a differ
ent partition or different folder. You’ll have to install to a different partition if you
have Windows 2000 or Windows XP in an NTFS partition, and if the NTFS parti-
tion is drive C, you’ll have to convert it to FAT because the Windows 9x boot 
code doesn’t understand NTFS. You’ll also want to look into products such as
PowerQuest’s PartitionMagic to simplify choosing which operating system boots.

ptical drives originated from the need for a high-
capacity, removable medium for multimedia and
software distribution. Inexpensive, high-capacity digital
technologies for distributing music and video from the
consumer electronics industry, including both CD and
DVD, met the requirement well. Other optical formats,
including magneto-optical drives, were popular for a
while before writable CD and DVD technologies
matured, but all of the others have essentially died out
in the face of the overwhelming manufacturing volume
pushing CD and DVD forward.
CDs provide a small, inexpensive, and rugged way to
hold about 650MB of data; DVD extends the CD technol-
ogy to provide far more capacity and greater data trans-
fer rates. This chapter covers how CD-ROMs and DVDs
work, how you can use CD-ROM and DVD drives in your
computer system, and how you can make your own
CD-ROMs. We’ll look at the newest technology and dis-
cuss what you can expect from a quality CD-ROM or
DVD drive. Chapter 17 covers how you can use writable
DVD and video hardware to make your own DVDs.
What Is a CD-ROM?
A CD-ROM most resembles the vinyl long-play records
still dear to the hearts of audio fanatics. On a record, a
single spiral in the vinyl winds from the outside to the
inside, with the analog signal encoded in the deﬂections
along the course of the groove. On a CD-ROM, a single
spiral encased in plastic winds from the inside to the
outside, with the digital data encoded by the presence
or absence of tiny optical pits. A record stores sound as
analog levels, which can degrade over time as the vinyl
wears or becomes dirty. A CD-ROM stores its data as
numbers, which never degrade unless the disk becomes
unreadable.
Figure 9-1 shows what’s inside CD media. In cross-sec-
tion, a CD is a layer of reﬂective aluminum with lacquer
on top and protective plastic underneath (recordable

instead of an aluminum layer). The zeroes and ones (transformed in a way that
makes the recording more reliable) get turned into ﬂats and pits on the surface
of the reﬂective layer when the CD is mastered. The layers include:
✦Spiral data track — The information on the CD-ROM is recorded in a
continuous spiral starting at the inside edge of the recorded area and
continuing to the outer edge of the disk.
✦Top surface — The top of the CD-ROM is lacquer over the aluminum
layer. The CD-ROM label is painted on top of the lacquer.
✦Reﬂective aluminum — A reﬂective aluminum surface carries the
ﬂats and pits that physically encode the information. The ﬂats and
pits, by reﬂecting light differently, enable the CD-ROM drive to read
back the information.
✦Plastic coating — The back side of the disk is covered by a plastic
coating that protects the aluminum layer.
Figure 9-1: The data spiral on a CD-ROM is nearly 3 miles long.
The CD mastering process is similar to the vinyl record-making process. A mir-
ror image of the disk, with all the pits and ﬂats, is used to stamp out the plastic
bottom of the disk with an accurate impression of the entire spiral. Aluminum
is then deposited on the plastic and covered with lacquer, resulting in the ﬁn-
ished disk. The accuracy required in the process is far greater than vinyl records
needed: Adjacent turns of the spiral along the disk are only 1.6 micrometers
apart, which means that there are nearly 16,000 of them every inch.

Mastering a CD is straightforward, if not easy. You feed data to the laser head
at a constant rate, turn the master disk at a constant rate, and sweep the laser
head from the inside to the outside at a constant rate. The laser burns pits into
the master as required. The end result is a precise, even spiral of pits and ﬂats.
Reading a CD from beginning to end — without pauses or other
interruptions — is straightforward, too. The read laser head sweeps the same
way the record head did when making the master, allowing light to reﬂect back
off the aluminum surface plated onto the CD, as in Figure 9-2. Light reﬂected
Chapter 9 ✦CD and DVD 131
Coding Data onto a CD-ROM
The ﬂats and pits on a CD-ROM do not directly correspond to the ones and
zeroes that eventually make it into your computer. Instead, the data stream is
coded in a particular way before recording, with the coding reversed when you
read back the disk to recover the original data pattern. The conversion from your
data to what’s recorded changes every 8 bits of your data into 14 bits that get
recorded, allowing the drive to compensate for limitations of the physical device.
The following table shows how that transformation works for some of the 256
possible 8-bit values. For example, if a byte value of 3 needs to be recorded, the
8-bit value would be 00000011. After that byte gets remapped for recording, the
result is 10001000100000.

The pattern of pits and ﬂats used on the CD to record the bits is interesting. A 1
is indicated by a change from a pit to a ﬂat (or a ﬂat to a pit). The length of the
subsequent pit or ﬂat (after the transition) indicates how many 0 bits follow the
1 bit before the next 1 bit occurs. If you look back at the table in this sidebar,
you’ll see that there is never a pattern in the 14-bit representation where two
ones occur together, which is necessary since you can’t put two transitions back-
to-back. The actual 14-bit code is more restrictive yet; a 1 will always be followed
by at least two 0s. This pattern limits the minimum size of the pits and ﬂats and
in turn allows designers to make decisions about the wavelength of the laser in
the drive and about the lenses used with the laser.
When the 14-bit codes are read back from the CD, the drive converts back to the
8-bit code the computer expects to see and (after passing the data through
some powerful error-correcting circuits) sends the data out onto the I/O bus.

from a ﬂat on the CD bounces back cleanly, sending most of the light back to a
photodetector in the drive. Light reﬂected from a pit on the CD is scattered by
the shape of the pit, sending most of the light away from the photodetector. 
A sensor converts the change in intensity of the reﬂected laser beam as the
beam sweeps from a pit to a ﬂat into the pattern of 1s and 0s for the 14-bit 
representation.
Figure 9-2: The presence and absence of reﬂected light, and 
the transition between them, indicate the pattern recorded 
on the CD to the drive.
As with magnetic disks, there’s more room per revolution of the disk to pack 
in data as you go farther out from the center. In the same way that magnetic
disks pack in more sectors at the outside, so do CDs pack in more pits and
ﬂats, and therefore more data.
The similarities between CD and magnetic disk don’t stop there. If you look at
the pattern
00000010001000000001001000010000001001000100000
you can’t necessarily tell where one bit pattern stops and the next one starts.
If, instead, we give you the same information, like this,
00000 01000100000000 10010000100000 01001000100000
you can tell that the sequence starts with the last part of a bit, followed by the
bits for the sequence 420.

The information that gives you the bit boundaries, and that divides the infor-
mation on a disk into sectors, is called framing. The framing information on a
CD doesn’t address the data as cylinder-head-sector (as on a magnetic disk)
because the spiral arrangement of the data means that there aren’t distinct
cylinders and because there’s only one head. The lack of those features makes
sector placement on a CD a little more complicated than on a regular disk. The
smallest unit above the byte is called a frame, containing 24 bytes. Frames are
grouped into blocks, which contain 98 frames (2,353 bytes). A CD-ROM actually
carries only 2,048 data bytes per frame — the remainder goes to added error
correction, synchronization, and addressing bytes.
When your computer asks the CD-ROM to read a speciﬁc frame, the sequence
of events is similar to that for a read from a magnetic disk. The head has to
move to the right place and pick off the data. Because the data is arranged in 
a spiral, though, this is a difﬁcult process. The controller in the CD-ROM uses
the following sequence:
1. Position the head as close as possible to where the frame should be.
2. Wait for the CD to turn enough for pits and ﬂats to spiral under the
laser beam, and start tracking outwards along the spiral.
3. Wait for synchronization with a frame, and read the frame address.
4. Adjust position based on how far the frame the head found is ahead
or behind the one you wanted.
Unlike CD-ROM drives, CD audio drives rarely change position to a speciﬁc
place — they do it only when you say to go to a speciﬁc track, which is almost
never on the computer time scale of billions of operations every second. In an
application like that, a few tenths of a second longer to ﬁnd the right place is
far less important than making the drive reliable and inexpensive. Because
computer CD-ROM drives were originally built from the CD audio technology, 
it was inevitable that the ﬁrst generation drives were slow to seek from one
place to another.
The sustained transfer rate off a ﬁrst-generation CD-ROM drive was also driven
by the capabilities of the CD audio equipment, which meant that the drive
transfers about 1.2 megabits per second (153.6K per second). Video compres-
sion technology gets pretty lousy below about 1.5 megabits per second, which
drove the industry to quickly develop the second, “double speed” generation
of CD-ROMs. Since then, CD-ROM manufacturers boosted performance to 4, 8,
16, 24, 32, and now 48 times the basic audio CD rate by spinning the disk faster
and building better drive mechanisms to hold or reduce the seek times. Table
9-1 shows what that means. Manufacturers have boosted the data transfer
rates up to 7.2 megabytes per second from the 150 kilobytes per second of the
original CD-ROM drives. The sustained transfer rates from CD-ROMs are now
as high as some economy hard disk drives.

Although they’re essentially a commodity item, CD-ROM drives do have differ-
ences besides transfer rate. Unless you’re simply buying a cheap drive you can
use to load software, look at the stated reliability of the drive. We’ve found all
the optical drives — both CD and DVD — to be some of the least reliable com-
ponents in computers, perhaps only exceeded in failure rate by fans and power
supplies.
Even ignoring copy protection schemes that embed errors into sectors on a
CD-ROM, you may encounter problems reading disks on some CD-ROM drives.
The major component of the problem is vibration from slightly out of balance
disks spun at high speeds, creating vibration in the laser that affects the signal
read off the disk. The problem started to be reported with 8X or faster
CD-ROM drives and has continued with faster units. The vibration problem is
more severe even than issues of tolerance in the manufacture of the CD-ROMs.
The vibration dampening built into the disk carrier and drive mechanism is
crucial — better-designed drives isolate the laser and pickup from vibration,
producing a cleaner and more reliable signal (all the more reason to buy from
quality manufacturers).
The importance of the speed rating of a CD-ROM drive is overhyped. If your
current CD-ROM works reliably, you’ll probably not beneﬁt from a faster
CD-ROM drive. Multimedia ﬁles don’t require the fastest drives, and soft-
ware loads are something you do once and forget. If your 8X or faster
CD-ROM is working reliably, consider keeping it.
134 Part IV ✦Storage

Hooking a CD-ROM onto the same ATA port as a hard disk is going to
reduce hard disk performance. If you can, keep the CD-ROM on the sec-
ondary port away from the hard disks.
CD-ROM drivers for ATA drives are built into Windows 9x, but if the drive is
on the secondary port, you may have to set up the driver manually. You can
do this with the Add New Hardware Wizard in the Control Panel. Windows
2000 and Windows XP should recognize drives on secondary ports auto-
matically.
Bootable CD-ROM
Until early 1995, you had no way to boot your computer from the CD-ROM
drive, which meant that if you built a new machine (or replaced the disk in an
old one), you had to boot from a ﬂoppy, install drivers, and build up the disk
contents from there.
The El Torito Bootable CD-ROM Format Speciﬁcation — standardized in
January of 1995 — changed that. (Legend has it that the name El Torito is from
the El Torito Mexican restaurant where the speciﬁcation was initially worked
Chapter 9 ✦CD and DVD 135
Keeping the Data Flowing at a Constant Rate
Older CD-ROM drives used the constant linear velocity (CLV) approach to read-
ing the disk, in which the rotation rate varies based on the distance of the head
from the center in a way that keeps the rate of travel along the data track con-
stant. Because the length of one rotation’s worth of the data spiral gets longer
as the head moves from the inside to the outside of the disk, the distance trav-
eled along the spiral per rotation gets longer. The size and spacing of the pits and
ﬂats remain constant, however, so more pits and ﬂats occur per rotation towards
the outside of the disk. If the rotation rate (in RPM) stayed constant, the
increased data content towards the outside would mean that less data ﬂowed at
the inside of the disk and more at the outside. Slowing the rotation rate at the
outside of the disk keeps the data rate constant.
Newer CD-ROM drive designs abandoned CLV for constant angular velocity
(CAV), in which the rotation rate is independent of the head position. CAV is the
same approach used in hard disk drives. CD-ROMs do still vary the rotation rate,
however, to help adapt to the transfer rate required by the computer. The reason
for the rate changes is that seeking to the correct block is time-consuming for a
CD-ROM, and if the computer can’t take data at full rate, the drive spinning at
full rate will move past the point the computer is reading. When that happens,
the drive has to seek back to the current read point — a slow operation. By slow-
ing the rotation rate to match the computer, the drive avoids the seek and gives
better performance. The drive avoids having to reposition the head backwards,
saving tens of milliseconds.

out.) Essentially, all systems now have BIOS support for El Torito, so if you
have a bootable CD-ROM, you can load the drive, start the machine, and have
it come up from the operating system on the CD-ROM. If you’re building a
machine up from an empty hard disk, the bootable CD-ROMs you get for
Windows, FreeBSD, and Linux let you start the install without shufﬂing ﬂoppies
or worrying about drivers. Bootable CD-ROMs are so successful and prevalent
that many manufacturers are dropping ﬂoppy disk drives from their systems,
relying on CD-ROM if an emergency boot is ever required.

What Are All Those CD-ROM Disk Formats,
Anyhow?
The more you look into how computers are built, the more speciﬁcations you
ﬁnd. That’s because manufacturers need precise deﬁnitions of what to expect to
build products that work with each other. A large pile of standards exists just for
CD-ROM alone. Here are some of the more important:
✦Red Book — The Red Book deﬁnes the physical format of audio CDs.
This is also called CD-Digital Audio, or CD-DA.
✦Yellow Book — The Yellow Book deﬁnes the physical format for data
CDs, so its purpose is similar to that of the Red Book. It’s possible to mix
audio and data on the same CD.
✦Green Book — The Green Book deﬁnes the physical format for CD-
Interactive, or CD-I, a format used in a game player from Philips.
However, having a CD-I compatible drive doesn’t mean you can do any-
thing with a CD-I disk on your PC. In general, you can’t without some
added hardware and software in the computer.
✦Orange Book — The Orange Book deﬁnes the physical format for record-
able CDs. There are two kinds — magneto-optical and write-once. The
CD-R is a write-once device. (Magneto-optical drives have remained
expensive and are not widespread.)
✦CD-ROM/XA — This stands for CD-ROM/eXtended Architecture and is a
combination of Yellow Book and Green Book. CD-ROM/XA has generally
superseded the Yellow Book.
✦CD Plus — Also called CD Extra, this is a speciﬁc combination of audio
and data on the CD.
✦ISO 9660 — Once called the High Sierra format, ISO 9660 deﬁnes the ﬁle
and directory layouts on a CD. Extensions such as Joliet and Romeo have
been deﬁned to handle Windows 95 and NT long ﬁle names.
Some of the other standards you’ll see referenced include single and multises-
sion Kodak Photo CD and Video CD.
The only time you’ll really need to worry about any CD standards is when new
ones emerge because the product you’re looking at may or may not support the
newer standard. Otherwise, the drive and software manufacturers tend to sup-
port them all to avoid being at a competitive disadvantage.

Recordable CD-ROMs
Recordable CD-ROMs (CD-R) are the least expensive option for ofﬂine data
storage. If you need archival copies of ﬁles — say, of work you’ve done and
can’t afford to lose, of critical audit data, or of original customer material —
CD-R is for you. CD-R works on the same pit and ﬂat principles as CD-ROM. The
difference is that a CD-R disk uses a different material for the reﬂective surface
that can be burned by a laser to form pits, and a CD-R drive includes a more
powerful laser to burn the disk.
Making your own bootable CD-ROMs lets you store both diagnostic soft-
ware and an archive of data to load onto an empty computer. Creating a
bootable archive CD-ROM means you can create and test a disaster recov-
ery disk, ensuring that it has everything you need to reconstruct your oper-
ation.
It used to be that CD-R was very picky about delays while burning, with any
interruption in the data ﬂow to the drive likely to ruin the disk you were
recording. The enormous increases in system speed since the advent of CD-R,
combined with improved interfaces into the CD-R drives, eliminated that prob-
lem, making CD-R creation so nearly foolproof that CD-R is even suitable for
writing out ﬁles stored on network drives.
Not all CD-R media is rated for the fastest rates recorders can operate at.
The faster the drive spins while burning, the less time the laser has on a pit.
Drives can compensate by boosting the laser power, but you should be
sure the blank disks you get are rated for the burn speed your drive is capa-
ble of. If the disks are rated for lower speeds, reduce the burn speed in your
software.
CD-Rewritable (CD-RW) is a variant of CD-R in which you can erase the content
of the disk and reuse the media. The CD-RW is a read/write optical disk, a remov-
able-media device holding 660MB. Not all CD-ROMs can read CD-RW disks, how-
ever, and not all software writes CD-RW in a format compatible across many
machines. The most reliable use of CD-RW is for ﬁle archiving on a single
machine; go beyond that boundary and you’ll risk compatibility problems.
DVD
With even small hard disks now in the tens of gigabytes, and with people ﬁlling
those disks with great abandon, it’s not surprising that interest developed in
creating a higher-capacity version of CD-ROM. The same DVD format that
replaced VHS videotapes provides that technology. (DVD used to stand for
Digital Versatile Disk and some other variants, but the “ofﬁcial” name is now
simply DVD.) Video drove the development of DVD — consider that the DVD 
of the movie The Lord of the Rings — The Two Towers has 7.29GB of ﬁles! Table
9-2 shows why the new format was required: You just can’t ﬁt a lot of high-
quality video on a CD-ROM with MPEG 1 or MPEG 2 compression (MPEG 4 
didn’t exist at the time), and if you add a high-quality stereo sound track, the
Chapter 9 ✦CD and DVD 137

situation gets worse. MPEG 2 data streams can run at a variety of data rates,
so in Table 9-2 we’ve included data for 4 and 10 megabits per second. MPEG 2
video at 4 megabits per second is about as low quality as you’d want to use,
while 10 megabits per second is fast enough to give the full video quality
MPEG 2 is capable of.

Both the consumer entertainment and the computer industry wanted a new,
higher-capacity format. The consumer entertainment companies wanted to
deliver over 2 hours of video disk-quality movie on a single, small disk. The com-
puter companies wanted to do that too — for training videos and games — and
also wanted to store greater volumes of computer data. The result was DVD.
Compared to CD-ROM, DVD is simply all-around better. DVD-ROM holds up to
25 times more data than CD-ROM (see Table 9-3), and over 4 times more on
recordable DVD. It uses high-quality MPEG 2 video compression, resulting in
near studio-quality pictures. It stores higher-quality sound with multiple chan-
nels. Its plastic disk is the same size as CD-ROM and should be as durable.
DVD drives can read CD-ROMs, letting you use either format in a DVD-
equipped computer.

As always, manufacturers took a while after the initial product introductions to
drive the cost of DVD drives down. DVD drives for computers initially shipped
at between $500 and $1,000, but came down in cost as manufacturers designed
for lower cost and achieved higher manufacturing volumes with later product
generations. In 2003, we found drives priced as low as $27 on the Internet, with
free shipping. Given pricing like that, we no longer build computers using
CD-ROM drives — we build in DVDs.
DVD uses a combination of improvements to outperform CD-ROM:
✦Smaller pits and ﬂats — Figure 9-3 shows that the geometry of the
pits and ﬂats, as well as the spacing between turns of the spiral, is
smaller on a DVD. The pits are less than one-half the length of those
on a CD-ROM, and the spacing along the spiral allows twice as many
turns.
✦Shorter wavelength laser — The laser in a DVD uses a higher-
frequency beam, resulting in a shorter wavelength that is better 
able to see the smaller pits and ﬂats. The lens for the laser is also
improved, creating a more tightly focused beam.
Figure 9-3: Compared to CD, DVD uses smaller pits and a more closely
spaced track.
✦Two-layer format — Figure 9-4 shows how a single-sided DVD disk
can deliver two sides worth of content. The key is a partially reﬂec-
tive, partially transmitting layer at the bottom of the disk, and a laser
that can focus on either the bottom or top data layer.
Although CD-ROM recording format standards deﬁne how ﬁles and ﬁle names
(and audio tracks) are stored, no standards for how video and other special-
ized ﬁles are compressed and stored on CD-ROM exist. For this reason, you
ﬁnd CD-ROMs with QuickTime, Video for Windows, and MPEG video. If you
don’t happen to have the magic decoder software, you can’t play the disk.

Although DVD designers had the wit to specify standard read-only disk and

supporting both write-once and rewrite operations, there are ﬁve distinct
writable DVD formats. Each has its own characteristics (Table 9-5), and its own
proponents. Some drives support only one set of formats (that is, DVD-R/RW,
DVD+R/RW, or DVD-RAM); others support multiple ones. For example, the Sony
DRU510a handles DVD-R/RW, DVD+R/RW, and CD-R/RW.

We’ve shown two write speeds in Table 9-5 for all but DVD-RAM, reﬂecting both
the original speeds of the formats and the faster speeds of the newer media
and drives. Older drives may have ﬁrmware upgrades available to write the
faster media, but likely at the slower speeds shown in Table 9-5. Be sure to use
blank media rated for the faster speed if you have a newer drive operating at
high speed.
✦DVD-R — There are actually two writeable DVD-R formats, both simi-
lar to the read-only DVD format — called authoring and general use.
The laser frequencies to write media are different for the two, so dif-
ferent equipment is required for each.
✦DVD+R — The writable DVD+R format is a variation of the DVD+RW
format and is broadly similar to the DVD-R general use format.
✦DVD-RW — Rewriteable DVD-RW media are available with a 4.7GB
capacity and, like DVD-R, contain technology to prevent copying
encrypted disks.
✦DVD+RW — The rewriteable format related to DVD+R also holds 4.7GB
and optionally supports defect management for better reliability.
✦DVD-RAM — DVD-Random Access Memory is a rewriteable format
designed speciﬁcally for data storage. DVD-RAM incorporates Defect
Sector Management (DSM) to improve storage reliability. However,
DVD-RAM media are incompatible with most DVD-ROM drives and
set-top video players. You can get both 4.7GB and 9.4GB media.
In practice, there’s not a lot of difference between the DVD+R/RW and DVD-R/
RW formats — it seems mostly like the unfortunate result of large companies
failing to cooperate in the consumer’s best interest. Many companies now ship
DVD writers able to handle both, making your life easier. The Sony DRU510a
we’ve designed into the desktop machine you see how to build in Chapter 25 is
an example of a multi-standard drive.

Top Support Questions
CD and DVD drives usually just work on newer systems running Windows 2000
and Windows XP. Windows 95 wasn’t as well developed, so you can encounter
problems if you’re still running that operating system.
Q: I added an IDE CD-ROM (or DVD) to my Windows 95 system, and it’s not
recognized. What’s wrong?
A: First, make sure your IDE controller itself is recognized by Windows 95 and
isn’t in compatibility mode. The drive connected to the controller can’t be seen
until that’s true. If the controller is seen and the drive isn’t, try detecting new
hardware (Start ➪Settings ➪Control Panel ➪Add New Hardware). If that doesn’t
work, try reinstalling Windows on top of itself. The reinstallation should preserve
most of your settings, and the more comprehensive detection should ﬁnally see
the drive. Your motherboard may also have what Intel calls a PIIX-4 IDE interface,
which requires a patch for Windows 95 or an upgrade to Windows 98.
Q: How long will CD-ROM and DVD disks last?
A: Properly made disks will last for a very long time, but poorly made ones can
have a very short lifetime. Key manufacturing issues include the purity of the
materials making up the disk, proper control of tolerances, and the integrity 
of the seal at the edges of the disk. There’s not much you can do to check the
materials. Imation suggests looking at the data side of the disk (the side with-
out the label) with a very bright light (the sun or an overhead projector)
behind the disk. Be careful not to look directly at the light. If you see a large
number of pinholes — bright points of light coming through the disk — or you
see the label through the metal, the disk is doomed. Look at the label, too — it
should be smooth and free of defects. If not, substances in the air and environ-
ment might attack the metal layer. Exposing disks to high temperature can
accelerate aging and cause failure, too.
142 Part IV ✦Storage
Blue Lasers — More Capacity on the Horizon
In the same way that a shorter wavelength red laser diode lets DVD use smaller
pits and ﬂats than CD-ROM, even shorter wavelength laser diodes allow even
denser structures and increased capacity. The target for designers was a blue
laser diode, with a wavelength as little as 60 percent that of the red diodes used
in CD-ROMs. Designers expect a fourfold increase in capacity.
Unfortunately, blue laser diodes were terribly hard to make, delaying when they
came to market. Most of the materials researchers tried required a lot of power to
generate the shorter wavelength light. Only some of the power turns into light,
though — the rest turns into heat, which causes the diodes to degrade. A material
made from Gallium Nitride ﬁnally proved successful, leading to blue LEDs and lasers
and opening up a wide range of applications. There’s more detail in the book The
Blue Laser Diode: The Complete Story by the inventor Shuji Nakamura, et al., (see
www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=3540665056/barrypressA/ref=nosim).

Q: My system pauses for a long time at boot after seeing my optical drive. Can
I stop it from doing that?
A: Your motherboard BIOS may be looking for a bootable CD-ROM in the drive
and taking a while to decide that there’s no disk there. You can keep a disk in
the drive or you can change the BIOS settings to disable booting from CD-ROM.
Q: My optical drive doesn’t work. How can I ﬁnd out what’s wrong?
A: Optical drives normally spin up the disk when it’s inserted, so you can ﬁnd
out if the drive is even minimally alive by inserting a disk, noting which way
the label is turned before you close the drive. Wait a while and then eject the
disk. If the label hasn’t turned, it’s likely the drive itself isn’t working. If the
label has moved, your problem could be operating system, BIOS, cabling, or
the drive. You could run a set of diagnostics or simply try a different drive.
Summary
✦If you want a DVD, or at least a CD-ROM, you’re better off with a CD
or DVD writer.
✦Use a recordable drive to make archival copies of relatively large sets
of ﬁles and to publish your ﬁnished work.

emovable storage has a long history in personal
computers, from early 8-inch, 160KB ﬂoppy disks,
through a limited selection of high-capacity removable
magnetic media, to the latest external disk drives and
ﬂash memory disks usable with virtually any recent vin-
tage PC. You’ll continue to see developments in remov-
able storage driven largely by new technologies for
digital cameras and other personal electronics.
Removable disks are also useful for backing up your
system. Good backup practice requires that you back
up to a removable medium (or to another computer
located somewhere else), and the speed and convenient
ﬁle access of removable disks make them very desirable
for this job.
This chapter covers magnetic and ﬂash memory
removable disks. You can ﬁnd the discussion of
optical removable storage in other chapters.
Speciﬁcally, you can ﬁnd CDs and DVDs discussed
in Chapter 9, and more on DVDs in Chapter 17.
Floppy Disks and
Competitors
Although they’re ﬁnally dying out, ﬂoppy disk drives
had one of the longest lifetimes for any technology in
computing. Floppy drives were exotic, new technology
in the late 1970s, but by now are barely still commodity
items built in huge quantities. Floppy disk drives are 
no longer sold with all current-generation PCs, having
fallen victim to what’s now itself a commodity item, the
CD-ROM, when the price of CD-ROM writers and blank
media became as low as those for ﬂoppy drives and
disks. At the end of the ﬂoppy’s lifetime, the 3.5-inch,
1.44MB ﬂoppy disk drive was a universal standard, with
5.25-inch and the older 8-inch ﬂoppies only distant
memories. Higher capacity ﬂoppy formats, including

both a 2.88MB format, developed by Toshiba and used by IBM, and the 120MB
LS-120 format, never sold in enough volume to matter.
Floppy drives were two-headed devices, recording information on both sides 
of a ﬂexible oxide-coated Mylar surface and using one head on each side of the
disk. Figure 10-1 shows the layout. The cross-section view shows the structure
of a ﬂoppy disk drive with a disk inserted. The heads are in direct sliding con-
tact with the disk (which is why computers turned off the drive motor when
not accessing the disk — it avoided excessive wear). Small gaps in the heads
conﬁne the magnetic image to the current track. Separate gaps on each head
assembly trailing the read/write head trim down the magnetic image, keeping
adjacent tracks from interfering with each other.
Figure 10-1: Floppy disk technology didn’t change much 
for years.
One contender to replace the standard ﬂoppy drive was the LS-120 format,
using devices that read both a 120MB disk and conventional 3.5-inch ﬂoppies.
Table 10-1 compares the LS-120 with a conventional ﬂoppy, showing that the
technology offered not only improved capacity, but also had nearly ten times
the data transfer performance.
Technical beneﬁts notwithstanding, the LS-120 drives and disks never had a
large enough installed base to be useful for ﬁle transport, the main application
for large ﬂoppy-like disks. The LS-120 format had a window of opportunity as
digital photographs and compressed music ﬁles became common because
ﬂoppy drives became too small to hold a useful amount of information.
Although incapable of reading ﬂoppy disks, the Iomega Zip drive was more

commonly used for carrying ﬁles around, and for a while seemed to be a
strong candidate to replace the ﬂoppy disk. The ﬁrst generation Zip drives
stored 100MB on a single removable disk, while later versions stored 250MB.
Even the Zip drive is becoming obsolete, however, eclipsed by the very low
costs for CD-R drives and media.

Universal Serial Bus
It used to be that connecting almost anything to your computer was a pain
because conﬁguration and setup was difﬁcult and because there just weren’t
enough total ports. Even years ago, it was reasonable to want to connect a
modem or two and a mouse, along with a joystick and a printer or two. Today,
you can add MP3 players, digital still and video cameras, personal digital assis-
tants, home automation controllers, GPS receivers, scanners, game pads, video
capture interfaces, and more to that list. If every one of those devices needed
its own parallel or serial port, or a card added inside the PC, and if every one
of them created its own set of compatibility and setup problems, you’d be
likely to have thrown the lot out a window before making it all work.
Manufacturers aren’t too keen on frustrated consumers because they stop buy-
ing, so a new technology to solve the problem was inevitable. The technologies
contending for the role were the Universal Serial Bus (USB) and the IEEE 1394
(FireWire) standards, with USB achieving the dominant market position for
nearly everything but video camcorders. USB operates at 1.5 or 12 megabits
per second for version 1.1 (depending on the device), and up to 480 megabits
per second for version 2.0. USB lets you connect microphones, speakers, cam-
eras, modems, telephones, mice, joysticks, printers, scanners, GPS receivers,
memories, and seemingly anything else to a simple, thin cable replacing the
mess of cables at the back of your computer. Instead of ﬁnding a free bus slot,
plugging in a new card, setting switches, and hoping everything still works,
you just plug the new device into a free USB port on your computer or on a
separate USB hub. You don’t have to crack open the computer case at all.
Chapter 10 ✦Removable Storage 147

Although the number of USB ports built into PCs is growing — we’ve seen as
many as eight — you’re likely to end up adding more either because you ran out
of ports or because it’s inconvenient to cable everything down to the ports on
your desktop computer sitting on the ﬂoor. The USB speciﬁcation supports hubs,
devices that expand one port to many and allow you to cable in a tree-like fash-
ion. Figure 10-2 shows how hubs expand the number of ports, including the capa-
bility to cascade hubs to expand the conﬁguration further than one hub allows.
You must not create loops in the tree, but otherwise you can plug anything into
anything else that has an empty socket. In Figure 10-2, you could equally well plug
the telephone into the monitor or the speaker into the keyboard. Some USB
devices have hubs built into them, as also illustrated in the ﬁgure.
Figure 10-2: The USB cabling scheme requires that you avoid loops, but otherwise
you can plug things in where it’s convenient.
If you have enough USB devices that you need to expand your system with 
a hub, be sure to get a powered hub. Unpowered hubs expect to get device
power from the computer or other source, but the computer itself is unlikely
to be able to supply the necessary power for as many devices as you can use
with a hub. Not enough power will cause erratic operation or failure. The pow-
ered hubs supply their own power and avoid that problem.
Operating system support for USB has been available in Windows since
Windows 98 and Windows 2000 and is available for Linux as well. You may
need to do some research (start at www.linux-usb.org) and conﬁguration
work, and you should be running a Linux kernel no older than version 2.5, but
the capability exists, supports dynamic device detection, and supports a wide
range of devices (see www.linux-usb.org/devices.html).

External USB Storage
Not only do recent versions of Windows include USB support, Windows 2000
and Windows XP include generic USB storage device drivers, which means you
can plug any USB-connected storage device into a USB port on a PC running
those operating systems and access its ﬁles. PC developers have been wonder-
fully inventive with the opportunity those drivers created, leading to the built-
in ability to access a variety of devices:
✦Cameras — Most digital cameras contain either a built-in memory, 
a socket for a memory card, or both. Socket formats typically are
Compact Flash, MMC and its successor Secure Digital, and the Sony
Memory Stick. These memories are most often built with ﬂash mem-
ory, which is random access memory able to retain its contents after
the power goes off. Disk drives are available in the Compact Flash
format, with capacities of at least a gigabyte. You can access the pic-
tures the camera stores on the memory through the Windows driver,
although you may not have access to camera settings.
✦Memory keys — Also called Flash Disks and a variety of other
names, these devices are simply ﬂash memory and a USB interface in
a package you can stick in your pocket or on a key ring (see Figure
10-3). Capacities of a gigabyte and more are available, making them a
great alternative to ﬂoppy disks and CD-R for carrying ﬁles around.

Chapter 10 ✦Removable Storage 149

✦External hard disks — At 60 megabytes per second (480 Mbps / 8),
USB 2.0 is fast enough that it’s effective for connecting hard disks to
your PC. Therefore, you can carry around a brick holding as much as
250 gigabytes (more as hard disks get larger), which is useful for very
large ﬁles and as a removable backup device. You can’t replace the
media in an external hard disk, but the ability to disconnect it from
the PC means failures and errors in the PC won’t damage the data
stored in the disconnected disk. The Seagate external drive in Figure
10-4 can connect via either USB 2.0 or IEEE 1394, and holds 160GB.
Figure 10-4: USB-connected external hard disk drive

✦External ﬂoppy drives — Although ﬂoppy drives have all but disap-
peared from packaged computers, at times a ﬂoppy disk is all you
have for ﬁle transfer. You can get USB-connected external ﬂoppy disk
drives for those times, with all the power necessary coming from the
USB port.
Small Scale File Transfer and Backup
It used to be that everyone who did ﬁle transfers or backups did them to
ﬂoppy disk because every PC had a ﬂoppy disk drive, the media were cheap,
and good software existed to stream backup ﬁles out to disk. With the large
ﬁles common today, and the large disks on PCs that easily store many large

ﬁles, however, ﬂoppy disk backup is impractical — you’d be looking at nearly
43,000 ﬂoppy disks to back up a full 60GB hard drive. Removable media alterna-
tives for backup today — ignoring the very high-capacity, high-speed Digital
Linear Tape (DLT) drives because they’re so very expensive — include CD-
R/RW, DVD-R/RW, Zip disks, LS-120, and memory keys. Hard drives dedicated to
backup are also a common choice because they’re big, fast, and inexpensive.
For ﬁle transport, only CD-R offers the combination of nearly universally read-
able media and very low media cost. The varying CD-RW formats are often
incompatible, and the other devices are not so common you can assume one’s
available on an unknown PC. USB ports to host memory keys are universal, but
PCs running Windows 98 or Windows Me won’t be able to read the drive without
installing device drivers you might not have. We recommend memory keys when
you know the receiving system has the necessary drivers, and CD-R otherwise.
You may be able to improve the performance you receive from a memory
key under Windows 2000 or Windows XP. Try reformatting the key with the
NTFS ﬁle system and enabling write caching on the device. You’ll lose any
chance at compatibility with Windows 9X systems and will have to be very
careful to stop the device before you unplug it, but the performance gain
could be dramatic. We recorded times to write hundreds of 1 to 2
megabyte ﬁles to the drive that were 37 percent less just by changing ﬁle
system type.
However, although the NTFS option is easy to get to in Windows 2000,
Microsoft didn’t make formatting a memory key with NTFS under Windows
XP straightforward. You’ll ﬁrst have to go into the Policies tab in the device
properties and change the setting from optimized for quick removal to opti-
mized for performance (turn on write caching while you’re there). After
that’s done, you’ll have to open a command window (the NTFS option isn’t
available with the graphical format dialog boxes) and use the format
command. On a drive with letter f:, for example, you could use format f:
/fs:ntfs /c /x, which not only formats the ﬁle system but also enables
compression and closes any open ﬁles. After you’ve formatted the memory
key with NTFS, any Windows 2000 or Windows XP system should recognize
it properly.
File backup is a different story. CD-R is relatively slow and holds only 650 to
700MB per disk, so a multi-gigabyte backup will take a long time and require
you to stay by the computer to feed disks. The net effect is that most people
won’t bother to take the time to do backups, which puts their data at risk. For
that reason, we recommend a separate hard drive for backup. You can use a
secondary drive directly installed into the PC if you must (and if you have the
discipline not to use it for ﬁle storage), but we like using an external hard drive
you can disconnect and put away for safekeeping when the backup is done.
Most systems can be conﬁgured in the BIOS to boot a specially formatted CD-
R. In some systems, you can boot the system from either an external drive and
or a memory key, too. Test boot your system from whatever external media
you want to use for emergencies before you need the capability.
Chapter 10 ✦Removable Storage 151

Backup with External Disk
Historically, individual backup media such as ﬂoppy disks, tapes, and CD-Rs
were signiﬁcantly smaller than the hard disks being backed up, so backup 
software had many tasks to manage, including the following:
✦Identify the ﬁles to be backed up
✦Determine what ﬁles would be backed up where
✦Provide options to minimize the total number of backup media 
consumed
✦Compress ﬁles as they are transferred to backup storage
✦Index what versions of what ﬁles were stored on what backup disk 
or tape
✦Provide mechanisms for restoring ﬁles from backup
The advent of huge, inexpensive hard disks, such as the Seagate external drive
pictured in Figure 10-4, made highly simpliﬁed backups possible. In particular:
✦Determine what ﬁles would be backed up where — Even the smaller,
160GB external drive is larger than most people’s drives, and much
larger than the actual data worth backing up, so only one backup
medium is necessary. Every ﬁle backed up goes to that one place.
✦Provide options to minimize the total number of backup media
consumed — The historically useful variations of a full backup (back-
ing up everything), differential backup (backing up everything since
the last full backup), and incremental backup (backing up everything
since the last backup of any sort) simply aren’t relevant.
✦Compress ﬁles as they are transferred to backup storage — The
backup medium is a fully capable Windows hard disk, and can be
compressed using features built into Windows. No action on the part
of the backup software is necessary.
✦Index what versions of what ﬁles were stored on what backup disk
or tape and provide mechanisms for restoring ﬁles from backup —
Because the disk is visible to Windows, users can simply browse ﬁles
on the disk. Mechanisms are required for full system restores, but
individual ﬁles can be retrieved using Windows Explorer.
All the backup software needs to know is the set of ﬁles to be backed up; it
then ensures that an image of those ﬁles exists on the external disk every time
it’s run. For efﬁciency’s sake, the software doesn’t bother to rewrite ﬁles that
haven’t changed, but that’s an implementation detail and not a deﬁning part 
of the process.
The BounceBack Express software comes with the Seagate drive to perform
backups. (If you’re not running Windows, you can do much the same thing as
the BounceBack software using the Unison File Synchronizer at
152 Part IV ✦Storage

www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison.) We reformatted the drive in
Windows to use the NTFS ﬁle system and to be compressed and then set up the
backup settings as in Figure 10-5. The “File Server” backup set runs overnight,
every night, and copies the entire contents of our ﬁle server (where we keep
all our data) to the external drive. You could do the same thing with your local
ﬁles if you don’t use a ﬁle server. The software runs the “Default Backup”
backup set every time you push the backup button on the front of the drive.
We’ve conﬁgured it to also back up the ﬁle server, but you could equally well
conﬁgure it to back up the project you’re currently working on.
Figure 10-5: BounceBack Express Settings dialog box
That’s literally all that’s involved. You don’t need to worry about what ﬁle is 
on what tape or CD — everything’s on the external hard disk. If you do have a
requirement to archive saved versions, there’s an upgrade version of the soft-
ware available that adds that and other features at www.cmsproducts.com/
seagate/upgrade.
Summary
✦Several removable disk technologies exist, each with its own combi-
nation of features.
✦USB memory keys offer a great combination of capacity, portability,
compatibility, and price.
✦You need to consider CD-R in addition to removable disks when eval-
uating your removable storage requirements.

here are many ways to connect to the Internet, but
all of them require a modem to send your data in
one form or another. Survey data collected in 2003 and
provided by Cisco Systems says nearly 60 percent of
U.S. households subscribe to Internet service, with 34
percent of those households having broadband service.
Most broadband subscribers used cable TV Internet
service, followed by DSL, with wireless at a distant
third. Nearly 70 percent of the homes with local area
networks also had broadband service.
These statistics are a signiﬁcant change from estimates
as recently as 2001, when U.S. broadband usage was a
mere 11 percent, surpassed only by South Korea where
a whopping 57 percent had broadband access. That
change accounts for the differences between this chap-
ter and the version in the previous edition of the PC
Upgrade and Repair Bible, in which we focused almost
to exclusion on dial-up analog modems and Integrated
Services Digital Network (ISDN). We’ve drastically
reduced the discussion of how analog modems work,
eliminated the discussion of ISDN, and added material
on broadband access technologies. (That said, take a
look at ISDN if you can’t get any other form of broad-
band access. It will give you 128 kilobits per second in
both directions and is very widely available.)

Signals and Very Long Wires
Modems are the underlying magic in computer communications and networks.
What makes them interesting (and difﬁcult to design) is that doing what a
modem does — pushing tens of thousands to millions of bits per second
across miles of distance despite really awful interference — can’t be done the
obvious way. The modem’s job is to overcome the limitations of wires, space,
and the rest of the communications systems.
The obvious approach to sending your data is to do what most of the signals
in your computer do: use one voltage level for a one bit and another for a zero.
On your motherboard, for example, a one is somewhere between 2 and 5 volts
(depending on your processor), and a zero is nearly 0 volts. On your com-
puter’s motherboard, signals like that go up and down hundreds of millions of
times per second, and (with careful design) it all works well. On a telephone
line, cable TV network, or radio wave, factors computer designers can’t elimi-
nate intervene to make this approach impossible.
The ﬁrst and most obvious difference between the wires on your computer’s
motherboard and an Internet connection is the length the signal must travel.
Wires on your motherboard are measured in inches; Internet connections are
measured in miles (well, kilometers, too). The difference in distance has differ-
ent effects depending on how you transmit your signal:
✦Wired — The wires used for telephone lines and cable TV networks
have a property called capacitance, which is the ability to store elec-
tricity. A short wire has almost no capacitance, while a very long
wire has signiﬁcant amounts. Capacitance is a problem because you
have to ﬁll the wire up with electricity before the change will show
up at the other end.
✦Wireless — Radio signals weaken over distances, increasing the
probability of errors in the reconstructed data stream. The faster the
transmitted data rate, the more signal power required at the receiver.
The second characteristic that distinguishes the wires on your computer’s
motherboard from a telephone wire is noise. Both wired and wireless signals
pick up noise from magnetic ﬁelds, sparks, lightning, and almost any other
electrical activity. Computer designers are very careful about keeping wires
away from each other to minimize noise, but neither telephone and cable TV
wires, nor radio signals, have that luxury. Wires are often strung along the
same poles as power lines for thousands of feet, guaranteeing they’ll pick up
noise. Antennas for wireless signals collect any noise from sources in their
ﬁeld of view. Both wired and wireless systems are out in the weather, too, sub-
ject to corroding connections, ﬁelds from lightning strikes, and other effects,
making the circuit as bad as it can be.
To see the problem transmission limitations create, consider the familiar tele-
phone line. Telephones are designed to send voices back and forth, not sym-
phonic music, which means the frequency response of a telephone circuit is
very limited. The lower frequency cutoff is about 150 Hz; the upper is less than
4 KHz. Figure 11-1 shows a typical telephone line frequency response. The
158 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

response changes somewhat from call to call because you’re likely to get a dif-
ferent connection through the switch each time, and the condition of each line
depends on its physical characteristics.
Figure 11-1: Your telephone line frequency response rolls off quickly as 
frequencies approach 4 KHz, which limits the achievable data rate.
What’s important about the graph in Figure 11-1 is the frequency response of
the telephone line rolling off badly at the higher end. The loss of high-frequency
response reduces the data rate any communications channel can support
because it restricts the bandwidth of the modulated waveform the receiving
modem can hear. Bandwidth limitations restrict the maximum data rate 
a modem can achieve for a given transmission power.
Dial-up Analog Modems
The word modem is really an acronym, formed as a contraction of MOdulation
and DEModulation. It’s been used so commonly, though, that it’s often no
longer capitalized as most acronyms are — it’s just a word now. The ﬁrst thing
that happens to your data as it goes out to the Internet is modulation —
changing your data into a signal that can be shipped over long distances.
(Demodulation is the job of undoing modulation — recovering your data from
the incoming modulated signal.) The fundamental job of a modem is to convert
the data stream into signals that can be transported within practical limits
imposed by the transmission system (as in Figure 11-1 for telephone lines). The
method the modem uses — its modulation technique — has to be standardized

between the sending and receiving modems so that what’s transmitted can be
reconstructed at the other end.
Modem standards are typically set by the International Telecommunications
Union-Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T, or more commonly
ITU) or the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), but in the
past have been set by the Consultative Committee for International Telegraph
and Telephone (CCITT) and the old Bell System.
More than enough different dial-up analog modem speciﬁcations exist to keep
anyone confused; Table 11-1 summarizes many of them starting with one of the
earliest dial-up modems, the Bell 103. The V.92 speciﬁcation is dominant today,
ISDN having failed to replace analog modems due to excessively high pricing
and egregious mishandling by the telephone companies. Many of the speciﬁca-
tions incorporate slower, fallback operation to handle poor line conditions.

The 56 Kbps V.92 and V.90 modems are not problem free, largely because some
telephone lines and switches can’t support the technology. The modem indus-
try estimates that perhaps 80 percent of telephone lines in North America can
operate with the new technology. These modems fall back to V.34 operation
when the lines can’t support the faster standard. In addition to bad telephone
lines, the issues with V.90 modems are these:
✦One analog hop — The 56 Kbps modem technology is very sensitive
to timing relationships, something that can be destroyed by multiple
conversions between analog and digital transmission systems. Your
telephone lines are analog; telephone company equipment changes
the signal to digital at the telephone switch or other equipment. The
signal must remain digital all the way to your Internet service
provider (ISP); if not, the modems revert to slower 33.6 Kbps V.34
operation.
✦No digital conversions — The digital voice transmission speciﬁca-
tions in North America are different than those elsewhere in the
world. The digital version of your 56 Kbps signal can’t survive trans-
lation between different digital systems, which means you likely
won’t be able to make international calls at 56 Kbps.
✦Asymmetric data rate — The upstream data rate (the rate out of
your computer) is less than 56 Kbps; it’s the rate into your computer
that’s 56 Kbps. Asymmetric operation works for Web access, but not
if you’re running a server or trying to upload ﬁles to another site.
✦Data rate limitation — In the United States, the Federal
Communications Commission has limited the signal power levels 56
Kbps modems can use to prevent signal crossover to adjacent lines
in wiring bundles. The limited signal power restricts the modems to
operation at 53 Kbps or slower.
Chapter 11 ✦Modems 161
How Many Characters Per Second?
Knowing that your modem transmits at 28,800 or 53,000 bits per second isn’t
as useful as it seems because nothing else in your computer involves single bits.
A far more interesting number is how many characters per second your connec-
tion transmits; however, even though there are 8 bits in a character, you can’t
send the 3,600 or 6,625 characters per second that simple division of 28,800 or
53,000 bits per second would suggest. The reason you don’t get that rate is that
your modem sends more than just your data bits — it sends additional bits to
indicate the start and stop of each character. These bits are, predictably, named
the start and stop bits. Current-day personal computer modems all use one start
and one stop bit. That means that every character requires sending 10 bits, so if
your 53,000-bits-per-second modem (that’s the most you get from a 56K
modem) keeps the telephone line completely full, you’ll send 5,300 characters
per second.

The other connection on your modem is the one to your computer. It’s called 
a serial port because, although it gets data from the computer 8 bits at a time,
it transfers bits serially — one at a time. The serial port is a connector on the
back of your computer if you’re using an external modem, but it’s buried in 
the circuits on the card if you’re using an internal one.
The serial port on the back of your computer follows the Electronic Industries
Alliance (EIA) speciﬁcation RS-232C, providing a number of signals:
✦Send and receive data — All the bits that actually go out the connec-
tor go on a single wire (plus a ground). There’s another one for data
from the modem back to the computer.
✦Control transmission — Two wires control when your computer is
allowed to send data to the modem: one to say the computer wants
to send, and the other to reply that it’s okay to do so.
✦Control reception — Two more wires control when the modem can
send data to the computer. The idea is the same as transmission con-
trol: one wire says the modem wants to transfer, and the other says
it’s okay to do so.
✦Monitor the connection — One more wire lets the modem tell the
computer when it has established a connection with a modem at the
other end.
A few more signals are deﬁned in the RS-232C speciﬁcation, but they’re 
rarely used.
You’ll ﬁnd two kinds of serial port connectors on the back of your computer.
The one originally deﬁned in the RS-232C standard has 25 pins in two rows.
Because only nine of those pins are used (except in very rare circumstances),
it’s possible to reduce the 25-pin connector to a 9-pin one. IBM did this initially
for the PC/AT, and most vendors followed this design because it saves space.
(For instance, you can put a parallel printer port and a 9-pin serial port on one
adapter card, but there isn’t room for the parallel port connector and a 25-pin
serial port in that space.) You can get adapters between the 25-pin and 9-pin
connectors in case you need to connect equipment that uses different forms.
The 9-pin version has been around for long enough that 25-pin serial ports are
relatively rare now on PCs.
The chip in your PC implementing the serial port, called a 16550, can stack
16 characters in either direction before overruns or underruns occur. That
cuts the processing load considerably, making serial communications far
more efﬁcient, but might cause erratic operation or other problems if you’re
connecting mice or other specialized devices to the port. If your mouse
won’t work, or if it works erratically, check the user’s manual for the device
to see if you need to shut off the ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out (FIFO) queue in the
16550, and for directions how to do that if it’s necessary.

If you’re connecting a dial-up modem directly to your computer, we recommend
using an internal modem in a PCI slot. Such modems will be automatically
detected by the computer and, if you bought from a capable manufacturer, will
install the drivers painlessly. Our preference for dial-up service, however, is to
use an external modem combined with a router, such as the 3Com OfﬁceConnect
56K LAN Modem. You avoid all issues of conﬁguring your computer to talk to the
modem — your PC just accesses a LAN that has an Internet gateway — and get a
Chapter 11 ✦Modems 163
Fax: Extending the Modem
Because communication is so valuable in your computer, it’s no surprise that
facsimile transmission (fax) and other extensions to pure data transmission have
migrated to your computer and its modem.
As the ﬁgure below shows, a standalone fax machine is really a very complex
device, including a scanner, compressor, modem, and printer. The scanner con-
verts the image into an array of pixels — a bitmap. The compressor uses a fax-
speciﬁc algorithm (called Group 3 compression) to reduce the size of the data
to be transmitted. The modem sends and receives the data stream. The decom-
pressor reconstructs the bitmap from the compressed data stream, and the
printer gives you the hard copy fax.
Most of the operations that a standalone fax machine performs can be dupli-
cated by your computer. Working from the right side of the ﬁgure, your modem
does the necessary data communications and fax compression. Your printer
handles the problem of creating hard copy. 
The only issue would seem to be the scanner, which isn’t as common as the rest
of the components. However, you might not always need a scanner. The scan-
ner’s job is to create the image you want to send, which in a standalone scan-
ner comes from a paper copy of the fax. In your computer, the material you want
to send is usually in the computer already, so printing it so you can scan it makes
no sense. Instead, fax software sets itself up to look like a printer. Instead of cre-
ating paper, it sends the resulting image to the modem.

and you have two telephone lines to spare, 3Com offers a dual-modem version
that can give you connections at over 100 Kbps.
DSL
There are ways to send digital data down a copper telephone line besides ana-
log dial-up modems. The most common broadband technology over telephone
lines is called Digital Subscriber Line (DSL). Table 11-2 shows some of the vari-
ants of DSL you might have available in your area.

Unlike cable TV, you can’t just go to a store and buy a DSL modem — be sure
to coordinate carefully with your telephone company and service provider.
Two-way DSL data transmissions share the telephone wires with your regular
telephone service — you don’t need a second telephone line, and callers won’t
get busy signals — letting you make telephone calls and send data at the same
time. Conventional ADSL technology requires a device called a splitter to be
installed where the telephone line enters the building so the ADSL signals can
be separated from the telephone voice signal. If you look at the ADSL entry in
Table 11-2, though, you’ll see mention of another technology — G.Lite — that
modiﬁes ADSL to eliminate the need for a splitter. No splitter means no service
call to the home or ofﬁce, so installation costs are less. G.Lite is slower than
164 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

ADSL, but for many people the loss in speed won’t be noticeable compared to
the gain in speed when you replace a slow modem.
ADSL works by forcing very high frequencies down the telephone line, frequen-
cies well above what you can hear and well above the frequencies shown as
usable in Figure 11-1. Figure 11-2 shows how that works. Transmissions from you
to your ISP use frequencies starting at 30 KHz and ending below the transmis-
sions from your ISP, which themselves occupy the range from 138 KHz to 1.1 MHz.
These frequencies are available because the 4 KHz limit in Figure 11-1 is really a
result of limitations in the telephone switch, not limitations of the copper wires
carrying your signals. The DSL equipment your telephone company runs splits
off the high frequency signals before they reach the telephone switch.
Figure 11-2: DSL spectrum occupancy
Telephone lines are noisy, however, and are more so at the higher frequencies
used for DSL. Noise can interfere with data, causing errors or blocking trans-
mission. Standards-based ADSL (what’s shown in Figure 11-2) combats noise
by dividing the available spectrum into subcarriers; it then shuts down trans-
missions in noisy subcarriers and diverts the corresponding data trafﬁc to sur-
viving subcarriers.
Most broadband Internet connections are always on as long as the power
and your computer are on. Being always on means other computers on the
Internet may be able to see your computer, even if you’re not actively doing
anything. You need to be aware of computer security if you’re going to use
broadband; see the discussion in Chapter 13.
Cable Television
Cable TV Internet service uses a combination of ﬁber optics and coaxial cable,
which are capable of a far larger frequency range than the telephone company
can use on their simpler twisted pair wires. Cable modems get only a small
fraction of the total bandwidth on the cable — typically the equivalent of one
TV channel — which limits the speed you get.

Cable modem service has become widely available, slowly growing to fulﬁll
some of the inﬂated hype cable operators generated in the mid-1990s. If your
cable TV network doesn’t offer cable modem service, it’s likely because your
cable system operates only in one direction, bringing signals from the cable
operator’s facilities (the headend) to you, as shown in Figure 11-3. Until the
cable operator upgrades the network for two-way trafﬁc, the only cable service
options are to provide no service or to provide service using your telephone
line and a modem for the return path back to the headend. Most operators
simply choose not to provide service.
Figure 11-3: Cable television network structure
In a sense, cable television data networks look like wireless radio networks
using a base station. The base station resides in the cable operator’s headend,
and transceivers (usually called cable modems) sit at each connected site.
Radio frequency signals traverse the cable between either end.
Cable television networks have a wider spectrum available for signals than free
space wireless systems because the cable conﬁnes the signals so that they
don’t radiate and interfere with other services. Most North American cable tel-
evision systems start the frequencies they use for transmission from headend

to user at 54 MHz, which is channel 2, and have an upper limit somewhere
between 200 and 750 MHz. Each television channel occupies 6 MHz of this
spectrum. (You can guess at the bandwidth of your system by taking the num-
ber of channels, multiplying by 6 MHz, and adding 54 MHz — see Table 11-3 for
some examples.)

Newer cable television systems — ones using ﬁber optics for the trunks out from
the headend — have greater bandwidth and better performance than older,
more restricted systems. Fiber-optic upgrades reduce the noise on the return
path between you and the headend, too, helping make the most of the band-
width you have from you to the Internet. Radio systems need a strong signal-
to-noise ratio to operate reliably, but the return spectrum on a cable system
(which starts at 5 MHz and extends to somewhere between 25 and 40 MHz
depending on the system) is a difﬁcult band to use. The ﬁrst 10 MHz (5 to 15)
are extremely noisy; the region from 15 MHz on up is merely noisy. The combi-
nation of limited bandwidth and noise restricts the available data rate, giving
cable modem systems the same asymmetric data rate characteristics as DSL
systems. In the forward direction from the headend to you, most modems use
a single 6 MHz channel and transmit at 4 to 25 Mbps.
Cable modem technology has another unavoidable problem, diagrammed in
Figure 11-3, which is that the cable, which runs from the ugly green boxes on
the street to hundreds of homes, is shared among all those homes. The cable
acts like a single LAN segment carrying TCP/IP broadcast and normal mes-
sages everywhere along the segment. Because broadcast messages are the
foundation of Network Neighborhood browsing in Windows, people on cable
television networks don’t necessarily even need network sniffer tools to ﬁnd
other computers — they might be able to simply use the tools built into
Windows and Linux. If you set up ﬁle sharing on your computers, your disks
are potentially visible to everyone on the same segment. A ﬁrewall will protect
your LAN; see Chapter 13 for how to set one up.
In many areas, you can go to a computer equipment store and buy a cable
modem built by Linksys, Toshiba, or other companies. You can do that
because of standards deﬁned through the work of CableLabs and many coop-
erating companies, cooperation that created competition in the market and
helped to lower the price you’ll pay for a cable modem.
Chapter 11 ✦Modems 167

Fixed Wireless and Satellite
Advances in component technology have made high-speed microwave radio
communications a strong competitor to wired technologies for Internet access.
Systems using terrestrial line of sight or satellite relay links offer broadband
access at prices competitive with cable or DSL, and without the requirement 
to be within a speciﬁc distance of a telephone switch or to rip up streets to
install new ﬁber-optic cables.
Terrestrial line of sight wireless uses one of several approaches. The service
once marketed by Sprint Broadband Direct, for example, adapted the
CableLabs cable modem standards for radio use. Figure 11-4 shows how the
Sprint service works — a site on a tower or mountain visible from a large part
of a city communicates with adapted cable modems tied to antennas on sub-
scribers’ roofs. The two-way Internet trafﬁc goes by wireless link to the tower
site and then by ﬁber-optic relay to the Internet backbone. Download speeds
(to your computer) can be as high as 8 megabits per second, but upload
speeds are generally limited to 128 kilobits per second. Latencies can be 200 
to 300 ms with little network activity, and around 3 percent packet loss is com-
mon, too, unless you’re actively sending or receiving data. With the network
loaded with trafﬁc, such as when you’re downloading a large ﬁle or playing on
Microsoft’s Xbox Live service (which has continuous trafﬁc for voice communi-
cations), latency can go as low as 20 ms, and packet loss goes to near zero.
Figure 11-4: Fixed wireless service using cable modems adapted for 
wireless
Across the city
168 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

The Sprint service requires a clear line of sight from homes to the tower, free
of trees, hills, buildings, and other obstructions.
Other services use the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN standard for neighborhood-
sized wireless zones, reducing line of sight problems, and use wired connec-
tions between those zones and the Internet. Figure 11-5 shows this architecture.
One home in a neighborhood has the central site, and is connected to the
Internet backbone through a wired connection that will be shared among all
subscribers. Wireless LAN equipment meeting the IEEE 802.11 standard (see
the next chapter) connects the subscribers to the central site and, hence, to
the Internet. Latency and packet loss can be very low assuming a good wired
connection to the central site, but are completely dependent on the speciﬁcs
of the individual system.
Figure 11-5: Fixed and mobile wireless service using IEEE 802.11
equipment
Wireless access doesn’t have to be line of sight. DirecTV, for example, offers
their Direcway Internet access service in the United States to anyone with a
clear view of the southern sky, delivering an advertised download rate of 500
kilobits per second. The system architecture is very much like the line of sight
system in Figure 11-4, except instead of communicating with a tower in your
city, you communicate with a satellite over the equator. You’ll still need line of
sight to the satellite, but it’s higher in the sky than a tower, eliminating many
visibility problems.
Across a few blocks
To the Internet
Chapter 11 ✦Modems 169

The most severe problems with satellite Internet access are speed, availability,
and latency:
✦Speed — Satellite power is limited, which restricts the data rate you
can receive with the relatively small antennas used by the satellite sys-
tems. That incoming data rate is shared among all users in a wide area,
too, so if there are a lot of people active, you’ll get less performance.
✦Availability — Weather effects between you and the satellite reduce
the signal power you receive, and attenuate your signal going back
up to the satellite. Solar storms increase the interference. Severe
weather and storms can cause you to lose the connection, making
the Internet inaccessible unless you have a dial-up connection for
contingency use.
✦Latency — Radio waves travel at the speed of light, but it’s 25,000
miles to the satellite and another 25,000 miles back down. It’s actu-
ally the round trip to the Internet and back you care about, so the
total distance is 100,000 miles. At the speed of light, that’s over one
half second travel time, all of which adds to the latency you see.
That’s an enormously long time; so long that you won’t want to use
satellite Internet access for Internet gaming or telephony.
All wireless access technologies have the same security problems as wired
ones because they can make your computer accessible to other people con-
nected to the network. Use a ﬁrewall to protect your computers (see Chapter
13 for how to set one up).
Choosing Your Internet Access
Broadband Internet access not only gives you a faster connection, it gives 
you a connection that’s always on. Only dial-up modems impose the wait for 
a connection so many people are used to — broadband modems are always
communicating, ready for anything you want to do. If you choose to keep your
computer on all the time — something the power management capabilities,
now in nearly all PCs, make a reasonable choice — there’s no wait for when
you want to ﬁnd something on the Internet. Firewall security is essential if you
keep your PC connected, but it’s cheap and reasonably effective.
The two most commonly used broadband technologies are cable modems and
DSL, but because broadband availability varies greatly by area, your choice
may be driven more by what you can get than by competition. For example,
although we live in a suburb of a large city, we happen to live in a broadband
black hole where neither DSL nor cable modem service is available. The tele-
phone company freely admits they have no current plans to upgrade the area,
and the cable company has been promising Internet service is coming in 2
years for the last 10 years.
If you do have a choice between cable and DSL, then despite our misgivings
over what passes for customer service with the cable companies, we recom-
mend cable modems because they’re signiﬁcantly faster than DSL and the
170 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

technology has proved to be reasonably reliable over time. If you can’t get 
one of those two, try www.dslreports.com/search or more pointedly
www.dslreports.com/prequal to ﬁnd out what you can get in your area.
The beneﬁts of broadband notwithstanding, you need to evaluate any commu-
nications technology on the basis of what it will do for you now and whether its
cost is justiﬁed by those capabilities. Cable and DSL modem equipment costs
may not be signiﬁcantly different than the cost for dial-up modems, including
external modems and routers, but the monthly fee is greater. Whether you’re
considering a 56 Kbps modem, cable, DSL, or some other technology, evaluate
it in terms of the data rates you can get and how the combined setup meets
your communications requirements. Don’t get caught in the trap of waiting for
tomorrow’s communication technology.
Another factor to consider is whether or not your communications link is the
choke point. In many cases, the limitation is the network or server and not
your computer or your communications link. For example:
✦Server overload — When a new version of a popular game goes on
the Internet, or when the next disaster strikes, it creates an immedi-
ate, enormous demand on download servers or news servers. If the
servers can’t keep up with the demand, or if the communications link
into the server can’t keep up, there’s nothing you can do at your end
to make things better.
✦Network overload — Even if the speciﬁc server you’re working with
has the performance and communications link necessary to give you
what you want at a high rate, the network connections between you
and that server may be overloaded to the point where you still see
poor performance. For example, we’ve played multi-player games
over the Internet at times when the response was as good as on a
local machine and at times when the remote players couldn’t move
responsively at all. The computers and communications links at both
ends were the same; all that changed was the performance of the
intermediate network connections.
Even if the servers and network you’re tied into can support you well, you can
then decide if the improved performance is worth the cost. Table 11-4 shows
how different connection speeds determine how long operations take for dif-
ferent kinds of data. Generally, tasks you do regularly that take more than a
minute or so are annoying. The table shows that large sound and video ﬁles
exceed that threshold, as do large software ﬁles. If you’re transferring large ﬁles
regularly, or if you use the Internet so frequently that the delay for modems to
connect is a nuisance, you’ll probably want to consider broadband.
Our experience, too, is that having computers always on and always connected
to the Internet encourages children to use the computers and use the Internet.
Our kids, for instance, have had computers available as readily as pencils since
before they can remember and use one as often as the other. Parents absolutely
have the responsibility to monitor what their kids are exposed to on the Internet,
and there’s no shortage of garbage and worse out there; however, there’s also
reason to think any successful approach to encouraging good computer and
Internet skills is worth thinking about.

Choosing a Modem
We should probably admit to some bias here — with the exception of comput-
ers with severe security requirements, we don’t understand why anyone would
have a computer that wasn’t in some way connected to the Internet. You are
bound to share work or personal interests with other people in the world, and
an Internet connection is one of the easiest ways to ﬁnd them. You need not be
a computer fanatic to get your computer connected, and it need not be com-
puters themselves you’re interested in.
Choosing a dial-up modem
If you’re running dial-up, the minimum modem you should install is a V.90 unit,
although if you’re buying a new modem you’ll want to get one implementing
the later V.92 standard. Modems meeting the V.90 and V.92 standards work for
connections using the V.34 standard at rates up to 33.6 Kbps and will connect
with all the major online services and Internet service providers. It’s more
likely you’ll ﬁnd a service with modems that don’t support 56 Kbps on their
end than one that a V.90 or V.92 modem can’t connect to.
Even if you don’t get the full 53 Kbps rate from a V.90 modem, you may never-
theless want one of the subtle beneﬁts from V.90 — if you play games over the
Internet, they will be more responsive with modems that have less transmission
latency. Table 11-5 shows the performance we measured for several modem
technologies. (Note, however, that a V.90 or V.92 modem connected to a V.34
modem will give you only V.34-class latency.)

The “Ping” values in Table 11-5 are the time it took for a low-level message 
to leave our computer, go through the modems, reach the nearest Internet
computer to us, and return. The round-trip times are higher inside games. For
fast-action games, a difference in faster response time can be the difference
between winning and losing. Table 11-1 shows that a V.90 modem connected
digitally will have response times 60 ms faster than an analog connection and
will deliver that faster response even if it’s running no faster than 33.3 Kbps.
Even though your dial-up modem and those at your ISP are capable of 56
Kbps connections, you might not get connections at that rate because
many telephone line problems make a consistent 56 Kbps connection dif-
ﬁcult. Speeds of 33.6 Kbps or faster require perfect line conditions along
the entire length of the connection. These modems are capable of pushing
the limits of analog phone lines, commonly offering connect speeds of
21600, 24000, and even 26400 bps or higher. Variations in line quality are
typically the cause of low connection rates, which is why you can some-
times get a bad connection, hang up and call again, and do better. If you
rarely connect at rates above 19200 bps, check that your computer’s serial
port is set for 38.4 Kbps or higher, and try dialing another number (ideally,
to another modem distant from the ﬁrst to see if the problem is at your end
or the other one).
Choosing an internal or external modem
There’s not a lot of basis on which to choose between internal and external
modems for desktop computers. If you’re using broadband Internet access, an
external modem is better because it simpliﬁes sharing the modem among sev-
eral computers, and simpliﬁes putting a hardware ﬁrewall between the modem
and your computers.
You have the option of internal or external if you’re using dial-up, however,
because dial-up is slow enough without sharing it among several computers
and because (unlike broadband connections) dial-up modems disconnect from
the Internet when you’re not using them. Here are the factors that should inﬂu-
ence your choice of an internal versus external dial-up modem:
Chapter 11 ✦Modems 173

✦Internal bus slots — An internal modem requires a bus slot, while an
external modem connects to a serial or USB port. If you get a USB
modem, or if the serial port for your external modem is provided
directly off your motherboard (as is often the case), the external
modem won’t consume a bus slot. There’s no difference in the I/O
port or interrupt usage unless you use USB — you have a serial port
on a conventional modem whether you use an internal or external unit.
✦Status lights — Some people ﬁnd the status lights on the front of an
external modem very useful. Among other things, they show you
when data is being sent or received.
✦Cost — Because an external modem has to include a case, power
supply, connectors, and lights, it has components an internal modem
need not have. That means it costs more.
✦Security — As we discussed in the section on dial-up analog modems,
equipment such as the 3Com OfﬁceConnect 56K LAN Modem com-
bines an external modem with a ﬁrewall. With the constantly increas-
ing number of worms, Trojans, and crackers prowling the Internet,
that security can bring you important peace of mind.
Summary
✦You should have an Internet connection, preferably broadband.
✦A 56 Kbps modem meeting ITU-T recommendation V.90 or V.92 is the
least you should have; we recommend cable TV, DSL, or wireless
broadband.
✦Good Internet security requires a ﬁrewall, something that’s much 
easier with an external modem.

etworking adds new technologies to the basics 
of personal computing, ones that let computers
communicate with each other. You need both hardware
and software to build your network; be prepared for the
fact that networking software is more complex than the
hardware.
A relatively small set of characteristics deﬁne network-
ing hardware:
✦Medium — A physical connection, a medium,
carries signals from one computer to the next.
That connection can be coaxial cable, twisted-
pairs of wires, ﬁber-optic lines, infrared light,
radio waves, or anything else that can carry
digital information.
✦Point-to-point or shared media — In a point-
to-point topology, the connections in a wired
computer network usually run between pairs
of devices, whether they be computers or net-
work elements. Wireless networks (and some
older cable technologies) typically share the
radio spectrum among several computers in a
shared media conﬁguration.
✦Baseband or modulated — The signals
between computers can be either baseband,
meaning that digital information is directly
impressed onto the transmission medium, or
modulated, meaning that the information is
impressed onto a carrier signal. Modulation
adds complexity, but helps signals carry
across difﬁcult environments.

✦Full- or half-duplex — Half-duplex connections permit transmission in
only one direction at a time. Full-duplex connections support simulta-
neous transmissions in both directions.
✦Access methods — If the media supports multiple computers on the
same physical pathway, a mechanism exists so that the computers
can tell when it’s okay to transmit versus when the pathway is busy.
Network Characteristics
If you’re going to network your computers together, you have to decide what
technologies to use. You should base that decision on what the competing
choices do well and what they do poorly. We start by looking at some of the
most important characteristics in networks and then look at speciﬁc technolo-
gies and how they relate to those characteristics.
Point-to-point or shared media
Depending on the communications technology, you can hook one device at
each end of a connection (typical of ﬁber optics) or many along the length
(easy with copper or wireless).
Point-to-point connections can still look like shared media. For example, twisted-
pair Ethernet connects ports on a hub to computers (or routers or other
devices). There is one device on each end of the wire, and nothing in the middle.
Because of the way the hub works, though, all the separate connections appear
to be a single wire.
Point-to-point connections have the advantage that when a problem occurs
with one computer’s connection, the others generally stay operational. Shared
media connections have the advantage that they don’t require all the wiring to
be collected at a central point. One connection can be strung from unit to unit
and return only one cable to a more central place.
Baseband or modulated
The technology a modem uses to transmit data down a phone line is an example
of modulated transmission. The digital information is impressed on a carrier
signal, which in turn moves the information across the media. In the case of a
modem, the carrier frequency is in the range of sounds you can hear. Here are
some other possibilities:
✦Fiber optics — The carrier is a light wave. The modulation is often
variations in the intensity of the beam.
✦Infrared — The carrier is a light wave, as with ﬁber optics, but the
medium is open air. The modulation is commonly a variation in the
intensity of the light wave.
✦Wireless — The carrier is a radio wave. The modulation can be varia-
tions in amplitude, frequency, or phase.
176 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

✦Power lines — You can send signals back over the power lines you
plug your computer into. A low-frequency radio wave could be the
carrier, likely using frequency or phase modulation.
✦Tin can and string — As silly as it sounds, you could make this work
at low data rates. You could let a standing vibration on the string be
the “carrier,” pulling more or less on the string to vary the frequency
(which would be the modulation). The point isn’t that this is realis-
tic, but that what might not come to mind today might be the trans-
mission technology of tomorrow.
Several of these media support baseband transmission, too, sending the signal
over the medium without a carrier. For example, you can use ﬁber optics and
infrared beams like Morse code, simply turning the signal completely on or off.
Wireless connections work for baseband transmission too, sending pulses that
vary the time between pulses to represent zeroes or ones.
No one scheme — baseband or modulated transmission — or even any speciﬁc
form of modulation is best all the time. Some are less expensive to implement
(copper), some are good for high rates and long distances (ﬁber optics), and
some are very easy to deploy (infrared). It’s typical, but not universal, to ﬁnd
baseband technologies in short-range applications and modulated technolo-
gies in longer range ones.
Full- or half-duplex
Connections can allow transmission one way at a time (half-duplex) or both ways
simultaneously (full-duplex). With the exception of telephone lines, full-duplex
operations generally require two independent half-duplex connections — one in
each direction. (Telephone lines use a special transformer called a hybrid to pre-
vent echoes and allow transmission both ways over two wires.)
Copper Ethernets either operate half-duplex (only one transmitter at a time) or
use independent pairs of wires, one in each direction.
Access methods
A shared-access medium requires a way for the transmissions of one computer
to be kept separate from those of the rest. There are four common ways of
doing that:
✦Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) —
As in Ethernet, a computer waits for silence on the wire. When it
hears no other transmissions, the computer transmits its own data.
When a collision occurs, each computer waits a random time and
tries again.
✦Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) — Each computer sharing
the medium can be assigned a time slot (in a rotation) according to a
clock shared by all the computers. So long as a computer stays in its
slot, it can transmit freely. Computers listen to all time slots except
their own.
Chapter 12 ✦Wired and Wireless Networking 177

✦Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) — Broadband systems
are frequently capable of supporting multiple transmission carriers
on different frequencies. If the frequencies are separated far enough,
ﬁlters can eliminate all but the one you’re interested in.
✦Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) — In the same way that pairs
of people can talk separately in a crowded room, listening only to each
other, computers can shut out other conversations on the same wire.
They do this by coding their data at the transmitter in a way known
only to the receiver, mixing it up with a high-speed series of random
numbers. The receiver applies the same code again to extract the data.
Receivers without the right code see only noise except for the signal
they’re supposed to see — the one for which they do have the right
code.
Each of these access methods has its advantages and disadvantages. CSMA/CD
requires only loose coordination between individual computers, and readily
takes advantage of having fewer machines on the wire. It’s more effective in
baseband systems (such as Ethernet) than in broadband ones; however, it’s
vulnerable to one computer failing and taking out communications for all the
computers on the same wire and tends to suffer when the trafﬁc on the wire
climbs to a signiﬁcant percentage of the raw capacity.
TDMA is common in telephone networks, being used to combine circuits into a
high-capacity connection. TDMA is also common in wireless systems because
it allows many users on a channel at relatively low equipment cost. It guaran-
tees a circuit a speciﬁed data rate, but limits ﬂexibility in changing the rate.
The time division structure has to be speciﬁed in advance, so there are likely
to be upper limits to how much of the total channel capacity a given circuit
can have. Synchronizing the timing among all the computers is critical,
because a mistimed transmitter can step on someone else’s interval, and a
mistimed receiver can get the wrong data.
FDMA is common in wireless systems because it simpliﬁes distinguishing one
signal from the others. It’s also used as a way to increase the data rate over
ﬁber-optic links. The electronics supporting the link can’t run as fast as the
ﬁber is capable of transporting, so rather than try to force them to run faster
(making them much more expensive), it’s easier to send several optical carri-
ers down the ﬁber at different frequencies. (This is called wavelength division
multiplexing when applied to ﬁber optics.) Filters at the receiving end split out
the beams and send each one to its own set of electronics.
Finally, CDMA is uniquely suited to noisy transmission channels. The proper-
ties that let it ignore other conversations also let it ignore noise, and give it a
degree of privacy (we pointedly said privacy and not security) not inherent in
the other technologies. The best CDMA implementations can carry as much or
more trafﬁc in a channel as other technologies; most CDMA systems carry
somewhat less.

Network Technologies
After you have a medium running from one place to another, you need to put a
network on top of it. There are many different approaches, the most common
of which is Ethernet. Most of the other network technologies have been devel-
oped to address one or another limitation of Ethernet — speed, distance, or
the need for a cable. Table 12-1 summarizes the key characteristics of the most
common local network technologies — Ethernet and wireless.

In addition to networks having overall characteristics, every network imple-
mentation has a speciﬁc medium it uses to transmit signals. Collectively, we’ll
call the network medium its cable (or cable type), ignoring the fact that wire-
less transmissions don’t have a physical cable.
Ethernet
Ethernet was among the earliest networks. The initial version of Ethernet used
a thick coaxial cable about 0.4 inches in diameter. Later copper-based versions
used a thinner coaxial cable, before the evolution to today’s twisted copper
pairs. For example, one of the oldest surviving variants of Ethernet, 10Base-2,
uses ﬂexible coaxial cable to carry the LAN signal, and makes connections with
a twist-lock BNC connector. Limitations on the transmission characteristics of
the 10Base-2 signal and cable cause restrictions on the way you use 10Base-2
to connect computers:
✦No external transceiver or AUI cable — The 10Base-2 transceiver is
built into the adapter card in your PC. A tee coaxial connector mounts
on the back of the board, and the cable attaches to both sides of the
tee. If one side of the tee has no cable attached, a terminator attaches
directly to the tee. You must not use a segment of cable to space the
tee away from the adapter card.
Chapter 12 ✦Wired and Wireless Networking 179

✦No spur directly connected segments — No branches off the 10Base-
2 cable are allowed — even to connect a computer to the associated
tee connector. The cable must run to the tee connector directly on
the adapter card.
✦Maximum transmission length — The maximum segment length is
185 meters (607 feet). You can attach up to 30 computers to a seg-
ment. There are no special spacing requirements between computers
except that the minimum spacing is 0.5 meters (1.6 feet).
If you open the coaxial cable at any point, the entire network segment goes down.
You can remove a computer from a 10Base-2 segment, but you have to do it by
removing the tee connector from the back of the computer. It’s very common to
use a short spur segment from the tee connector to the back of the computer,
but it’s a very bad idea. The spur causes signal reﬂections, degrading the signal
on the network and causing errors. The error rate goes up as the load on the
network goes up, and as the number of spurs (and their length) goes up.
If you have a 10Base-2 network, check the connectors, terminators, 
and especially the tees often. Cracked parts make your LAN unreliable or
inoperative.
By far the dominant Ethernet cabling technology is twisted-pair — a bundle of
four pairs of wires, each pair twisted together, and the entire set wrapped in an
outside jacket. There are two variants of twisted-pair network wiring, 10Base-T
(which runs at 10 Mbps), and 100Base-T (which runs at 100 Mbps). The two
variants are commonly termed 10/100Base-T when it doesn’t matter which one
you’re talking about.
10/100Base-T attaches only one computer to each wire segment, combining
segments to form the network. Each segment contains two twisted-pairs of
wire: one pair for transmitting and one for receiving. The wires have an RJ-45
modular connector (slightly larger than the usual RJ-11 connector on most
telephones) at each end (Figure 12-1). One end connects to the computer, while
the other connects to a device that joins all the separate segments together
(Figure 12-2). That device is called a hub or a switch, depending on its internal
characteristics. You can get hubs and switches to join from 4 to 24 (or more)
segments together and can join hubs and switches together to create even
larger networks. Ethernet switches increase twisted-pair network performance
by letting many computers transmit at the same time, separating the trafﬁc of
each computer pair from the rest.
Twisted-pair connections can be up to 100 meters (328 feet) long. If you allow
10 meters (total) for connections within a wiring closet and from the wall to the
computer, the in-wall wiring can be up to 90 meters. Both unshielded twisted-
pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP) are used, differing in that STP has
shielding wrapped around the conductors to minimize noise and interference.
Therefore, STP has better transmission characteristics than UTP, but twisted-
pair wiring is almost universally done with UTP. Twisted-pair wiring provides
separate wire pairs for transmitting and receiving. Twisted-pair can therefore
operate in full-duplex, which means that it’s possible for a computer to trans-
mit and receive simultaneously.

If any one wire goes down, the rest of the computers 
are unaffected.
In addition to the division between shielded and unshielded wire, there are cat-
egories of twisted-pair wiring, differentiated by their capability to transport the
network signal without distortions, called Category-3, -5, -5e, and -6. Category-3
is the usual voice-grade wiring that is commonly pre-wired in buildings.

Categories-5, 5e, and 6 use successively higher-quality cables and connectors.
If you ever plan to upgrade from 10Base-T to 100Base-T, you want to start with
Category-5, 5e, or 6. Your network runs no better than its worst wiring compo-
nent. In other words, use Category-3 connectors with Category-6 wire and you
have a Category-3 network.
Table 12-2 summarizes the twisted-pair wiring categories. You should avoid
Category-3, but any of the other three are suitable for home, home ofﬁce, and
small networks. If you’re building a large LAN, plan on using Category-5e or
Category-6.

Gigabit Ethernet networks (solid)
Ethernet cables in the walls typically terminate at RJ-45 jacks, and you use patch
cords to connect from the wall jacks to computers, hubs, switches, or other
devices. Patch cords have RJ-45 plugs at both ends. If you have the tools to
attach the modular connectors, you can make twisted-pair patch cables yourself.
If not, you’ll have to order them in the right length. Either way, if you make a
cable that reverses the transmit and receive pairs between the connectors — a
crossover cable — you can connect two computers directly, without a wiring hub.
Twisted-pair interfaces monitor the link status, and most provide a light to
indicate that the link is up. You have to check the lights at both ends, though,
because link status is based on the receive side only.
Ethernet is designed for shared media. Point-to-point wiring (such as twisted-
pair) connects the wiring segments together electrically in most cases, creating
a shared medium through the wiring hub. Similarly, Ethernet can be either half-
duplex or full-duplex, depending on the physical medium and attached network
devices. Ethernets use carrier sense with collision detection to support multi-
ple access. When any given transmitter has something to send, it listens on 
the network to try to verify that no other device is currently transmitting. If the
network appears idle, it starts to send. Because transmitters can be relatively
far apart, however, it’s possible for two transmitters to sense that the network
182 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

is idle and both start to transmit at roughly the same time. Ethernet trans-
ceivers detect this occurrence and schedule a retransmission. The time for the
retransmission is based on a random number to help the two colliding stations
avoid further contention.
The shared medium amounts to a “cloud” that interconnects all nodes on the
network equally. Addresses in each network message deﬁne both the source
and the destination of the message.
Keep in mind that an unencrypted shared medium (such as Ethernet) is
inherently insecure. On any one network segment, every packet arrives at
every transceiver, and a transceiver programmed to listen to all addresses
indiscriminately hears them all. This is useful for building network analyzers,
but it means that, with the right software, the trafﬁc from the executive suite
to marketing is equally visible to anyone else connected to the network.
Another downside of Ethernet has been its limitation to 10 or 100 Mbps on a sin-
gle segment. As fast as that seems, when you start to transfer huge ﬁles across
the network (such as raw video recordings) or connect tens or hundreds of
computers to a single segment, network performance accessing the ﬁle servers
quickly becomes intolerable. Gigabit Ethernet solves that problem, offering
full-duplex Ethernet operation on your existing unshielded twisted-pair wiring
at 1,000 Mbps.
Table 12-3 shows the variants of Gigabit Ethernet:

The compatibility with existing wiring simpliﬁes deployment, although distance
limitations may be a factor. The ﬁrst uses of gigabit Ethernet were to connect
servers to networks and to interconnect switches as the network backbone.
High-performance applications such as video editing are driving gigabit Ethernet
out towards individual computers. The need for gigabit Ethernet isn’t specula-
tion. A high-performance server can, today, generate sustained network trafﬁc
in the 300 Mbps and up range, so a highly loaded backbone with several servers
will beneﬁt from the performance boost. You could see performance gains in
the home or small ofﬁce too — for example, a 10GB video ﬁle that takes about
20 minutes to transfer between computers over 100 Mbps Ethernet would take
only a minute and a half over gigabit Ethernet.
Chapter 12 ✦Wired and Wireless Networking 183

Ethernet adapters are one of the products that we’re picky about. Networks
are difﬁcult enough to set up and keep running reliably; you don’t need extra
excitement on that front. We’ve found adapters from 3Com, Linksys, and NET-
GEAR dependable, as well as adapters built into the Intel motherboards, and
have the scars to prove that less expensive isn’t always better. We’ve thrown
away a network card that was a solid piece of hardware, for example, because
it had an admittedly buggy driver that the vendor never ﬁxed.
We recommend using motherboards with built-in Ethernet adapters, such as that
on the Intel D875PBZ motherboard (Figure 12-3). Otherwise, 10/100/1000Base-T
adapters — stay with the top manufacturers — are a commodity you can buy
based on price and availability. Either way, market price pressures have driven
the adapters to be integrated into little more than a single chip.

Gigabit Ethernet is new enough that it’s particularly important to use adapters
(and other network components) from ﬁrst-line manufacturers.
Wireless transmission
Wireless networks use radio or light waves to communicate between stations.
The frequencies for radio-based networks vary based on national licensing.
Systems in the United States often use bands designated by the Federal
Communications Commission for “unlicensed” operation, meaning that, after
Ethernet RJ-45 connector
USB 2.0 connectors
184 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

the manufacturer has qualiﬁed the equipment, the operator doesn’t need spe-
cial training or licensing. Optical systems often use infrared frequencies (light
waves just below the visible spectrum). Some of the key characteristics are:
✦Range — Radio systems have ranges up to tens of miles. Infrared 
systems are typically limited to a few hundred feet.
✦Blockage — Radio waves penetrate walls and ﬂoors with varying
degrees of success. Light waves require a direct line of sight between
the transmitter and receiver.
✦Data rate — Radio systems don’t always carry the usual 10 Mbps
Ethernet rate, particularly at longer ranges. Radio data rates vary
from 1 Mbps to hundreds of megabits per second, with the most
common variants running between 1 and 54 Mbps. Short-range
infrared systems tend to operate at speeds of 10 to 100 Kbps,
although some operate as fast as 4 Mbps.
Wireless networks can operate with point-to-point topologies, like twisted-pair
networks, or with shared access, like coaxial-cable networks.
Optical wireless and many radio wireless networks use a central node, called 
a base station, which corresponds to a wiring hub in a 10/100Base-T network.
Transmissions between computers go through the base station and are
retransmitted after reception if the destination is also on the wireless network.
(Base stations are commonly attached to a wired network as well, giving the
mobile units access to the wider network.) Networks organized with a base
station generally transmit out of the base station on one frequency and receive
on another; the computers reverse the frequency assignments. Radio networks
without a base station let all units transmit on the same frequency.
In either scheme, wireless networks require a method for collision detection.
The carrier sense/collision detection approach used in Ethernet doesn’t work
well on wireless networks because of the time delay between the start of the
transmission and when the receiver notices the carrier. The relatively long
latency while the receiver locks up on the signal creates too long a window in
which a second transmitter might start operations and step on the transmis-
sions of the ﬁrst one. That’s why many wireless networks use an access
scheme that positively identiﬁes the next station allowed to transmit.
Some radio networks use spread spectrum technology to isolate transmissions
from one another. Spread spectrum is an inherently noise resistant transmission.
There are two forms of spread spectrum: frequency hopping and direct sequence.
✦A frequency hopper divides the overall allocated spectrum into many
small bands, transmitting for only a brief moment in one before hop-
ping to the next. The hops are made in a predetermined sequence.
Frequency hoppers resist interference and jamming by either avoid-
ing the noisy channels or dwelling in them for a very short a time.
✦The second form of spread spectrum, direct sequence, enables all 
the transmitted signals to use the entire allocated band at once. The
greater the ratio of the available channel bandwidth to the data rate,
the more interference and jamming-resistant the signal will be.

The advantages that wireless networks have over wired ones are mobility and
not having to run wires (not as silly as it sounds). In addition to being able to
move around — useful if you’re taking inventory in a warehouse, for example —
a wireless connection can solve the problem of linking networks that have
physical barriers between them. Point-to-point wireless links can solve the
problem of how to cross roads and railways between building networks, or of
how to cross parts of a town without the expense of a leased telephone line.
Multidrop wireless networks can simplify linking stations on several ﬂoors of
the same building when it’s impractical to run wires between the networks.
Wireless networks are generally more expensive than their wired equivalents,
so you want to use them only where mobility or access is an issue.
IEEE speciﬁcation 802.11 standardizes the most common wireless LAN tech-
nologies. There are three variants, IEEE 802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g.
✦IEEE 802.11b — Also known as WiFi (for Wireless Fidelity), IEEE
802.11b networks run at rates from 1 to 11 Mbps over relatively short
ranges. You can run a WiFi network in ad hoc mode, in which two
computers talk directly among themselves, or in infrastructure mode,
in which the computers talk through a central wireless access point
(Figure 12-4). Access points are commonly packaged with routers to
create a device that interfaces both the wireless network and a LAN
together and to an external Internet connection. IEEE 802.11b net-
works operate at 2.4 GHz frequencies, a band shared by wireless tele-
phones, Bluetooth networks, and a variety of other equipment. IEEE
802.11b network installations have grown explosively in recent years,
and the equipment has become quite inexpensive.

Sharing Frequencies with Spread Spectrum
There’s an interesting operation computers do on numbers, called “exclusive or”
or “XOR.” The XOR operation is interesting because if you do it twice, you get
back your original number. For instance, if we compute
11001010 XOR 11111111
we get 00110101. All the bits in the initial number have ﬂipped. If we repeat the
operation on the result and do
00110101 XOR 11111111
we get 11001010 again. Now, suppose we take two digital signals: one a real
data stream and one a much faster stream of random numbers. If we XOR the
two streams together, we pretty much get garbage out, but we can throw away
the garbage and get back the data stream if we repeat the XOR using the exact
same random number sequence.
In a nutshell, that’s what direct sequence spread spectrum does. It combines
your data with a fast random number stream in the modulator and extracts it
back out from the random numbers in the demodulator. Of course, if you fol-
lowed that as well as we did the ﬁrst time someone waved the idea at us, you’ve
got a blank look and you’re thinking “So what?” (or worse) about now.
Here’s why this is really good. The frequency spectrum a signal takes up is pro-
portional to how fast the data goes. Double the data rate, and (everything else
being the same) you double the spectrum. If you keep the power level the same,
the power at any speciﬁc frequency is less because the total power is being
divided over a greater range of frequencies. In the transmitter, having the mod-
ulator mix the data with the random numbers widens the spectrum of the trans-
mitted result (because we use a fast random number stream).
Now, watch what happens in the receiver. You mix the random numbers back in
with the received signal, and two things happen: First, the actual signal gets con-
tracted back from its wideband spectrum to the narrower one needed for the
actual (slower) data rate. Second, the random number mix spreads out any
noise signals that the receiver happened to pick up. Unless they contain just the
right random number sequence (which they don’t), the mixing operation works
just like spreading data in the transmitter. The power of the data signal gets col-
lected back into a narrow range, and the power of the noise gets spread out into
a wide range. Signal power goes up and noise power goes down.
The best part of this is that lots of us can talk in the channel at the same time.
Your transmitter and receiver use a different random number sequence than
ours. Because we use a different sequence, my receiver doesn’t despread your
transmission; it stays spread out, so it remains low power noise. We simply don’t
hear you.

✦IEEE 802.11a — You won’t get the full (raw) data rate from a wireless
network, which means IEEE 802.11b wireless LANs (WLANs) are rela-
tively slow. They’re fast enough for surﬁng the Internet, but terrible
for ﬁle transfers and other operations on a LAN. Engineers developed
IEEE 802.11a in response, a WLAN speciﬁcation running in the 5.6 GHz
frequency band and operating at 54 Mbps. IEEE 802.11a equipment
never dropped in price enough for the standard to be used widely
because of the challenges its higher frequency band presented, and
has now been eclipsed by the IEEE 802.11g standard.
✦IEEE 802.11g — If you imagine (functionally) a hybrid with IEEE
802.11b frequencies (so it’s cheaper) and IEEE 802.11a speed, you
have the idea for IEEE 802.11g, which runs in the 2.4 GHz band at
speeds up to 54 Mbps. Standardized equipment only ﬁrst appeared
in 2003, but it entered the market at the then-current prices for IEEE
802.11b gear (which immediately dropped in price).
IEEE 802.11g runs at full speed in pure IEEE 802.11g WLANs, or can
throttle back somewhat to operate compatibly in IEEE 802.11b WLANs.
Unfortunately, the IEEE 802.11 designers were not experienced cryptologists,
and they inadvertently produced a system that was by default easily penetrated
and — even using what’s called Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) — relatively
insecure. It’s been demonstrated that, with the right equipment and software,
you can monitor WEP-encrypted WiFi trafﬁc and recreate the encryption key.
After you have the key, the network might as well have no security because
you’ll be able to use the network just as if you were authorized to use it. Worse
yet (or better, depending on which side you’re on), the more trafﬁc on your
network, the easier it is to penetrate, and you can penetrate a WEP network
anonymously.
IEEE 802.11g equipment offers a WiFi Protected Access (WPA), a newer,
stronger security technology. WPA is itself a subset of the yet more capable
IEEE 802.1x security standard.
Even if your equipment doesn’t support WPA or IEEE 802.1x, however, you can
(at the price of some one-time aggravation) make a WiFi network more secure.
Here’s what you should do:
✦Disable broadcast SSID — WiFi WLANs identify themselves with a
service set identiﬁer (SSID), which names the network and works
(loosely) like a password. Unfortunately, most wireless access points
transmit their SSIDs by default, which is pretty much like standing in
the street and shouting your bank card PIN. Unless you have equip-
ment that requires the access point to broadcast the SSID, turn this
feature off. If you do leave it on, change the SSID to something other
than the default.
✦Turn on WEP, and use 128-bit keys — You shouldn’t rely on WEP 
to be absolutely secure, but the cracker next door isn’t less likely to
have the tools, systems, or know-how to break it. WEP is a lot better
than nothing (unless you’re using 64-bit keys, which are far weaker
than 128-bit keys).
188 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

Access points and adapters typically let you set up the WEP key
either by typing a passphrase or by entering a hexadecimal (base 16)
value. We’ve had trouble making passphrases work across multiple
vendors’ equipment, so we recommend generating a hexadecimal
value using a long passphrase and then using the hexadecimal value
everywhere. Keep a copy of the key somewhere secure because you
can’t be sure you can regenerate it later.
✦Set MAC address restrictions — Most access points let you list 
the physical (Media Access Control — MAC) address of equipment
allowed to connect to your LAN. A typical MAC address looks some-
thing like 00-0C-38-55-F4-AD. You can use a MAC restriction list con-
taining all your devices to ensure only authorized devices connect,
although you can’t limit who might be able to listen.
Figure 12-5 shows the Microsoft model MN-700 IEEE 802.11g base station, which
incorporates a router, wireless access point, and a 10/100 Ethernet switch. You
control it through a Web browser, and can set it to act either as a wireless router
or a simple wireless access point. Having that choice is convenient because it
lets you add the unit to your existing LAN if you already have a working router
connected to the Internet.

surprising product in its line, too — the Xbox wireless adapter. What makes
the Xbox wireless adapter interesting from a PC point of view is what it will do
for your wired LAN.

Suppose you have several rooms each with their own wired LANs that you’d
like to connect together, but can’t run Ethernets between them. A wireless
access device connecting to a PC with USB is inexpensive, but connects only
one PC unless you then route out through the PC to the LAN. That takes a little
work (see the next chapter) and can prevent PCs on your other LANs from see-
ing the computers on the other side of the wirelessly connected PC.
You can do the job easily with the Xbox wireless adapter, and without any rout-
ing issues, because it acts like an access point that connects wired equipment —
PCs, printers, Xboxes, and more — to a wireless LAN. This application isn’t
documented or supported by Microsoft, but here’s what we did:
✦Set up the base station — Connect the base station to one of your
LANs, either as the Internet router or a wireless access point. Set up
at least the security controls for WEP.
✦Conﬁgure the Xbox wireless adapter — You need an Xbox for this
because the conﬁguration software comes as an Xbox game disk.
Connect the adapter to the Xbox, run the software, conﬁgure security,
190 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

and verify that the Xbox connects to the network (for example, 
check that it gets an IP address assigned through Dynamic Host
Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) — see Chapters 14 and 15).
✦Cable the Xbox wireless adapter to the LAN — All that’s left is to
hook the adapter to the uplink port on your hub or switch (or to a
normal port using a crossover cable). You have to disable the DHCP
server on that LAN if you have one because you want the DHCP
server on the other LAN instead. After you do, every computer on
the wirelessly connected LAN should connect over to the other LAN,
and (if you have a connection) out to the Internet.
Choosing Your Network Technologies
All local area network equipment decisions really boil down to how many com-
puters you have, what your bandwidth requirements are, and whether you
have mobile users. We recommend twisted-pair Ethernet — 10/100Base-T —
for nearly all applications, and gigabit Ethernet when you need even more
speed.
If you need to move around, or if wires are hard to run between computers, go
with IEEE 802.11g. Be sure to secure your network as tightly as you can if you
use a WLAN because most building walls won’t block radio waves. You can’t
know who’s listening in.
If you have a local area network and use an Internet (or other network) con-
nection extensively enough to have a broadband connection, you want to tie
that connection to your local area network. We show you how to do that in the
next chapter.
Summary
✦In most cases, you probably want twisted-pair wiring and 10/100
Mbps adapters.
✦Wireless LANs are a great convenience, both for mobility and to elim-
inate the need for wiring.
✦Wireless LANs, and any LAN connected to the Internet, require that
you plan for your network security.

fter you’ve put network and communications
equipment into your computer and set up your
network cabling, it’s time to connect it to a network.
You’ve got two levels of networking to think about —
how to build your local area network, and how to hook
up into wide area networks. We look at local area net-
work equipment and structures in this chapter.
Chapter 11 covers connecting your LAN to the
Internet.
Designing Small Local Area
Networks
Network design involves a lot of different (and some-
times conﬂicting) considerations, including:
✦Capacity — The rate at which information can
be sent over the network. You care not only
about the rate between pairs of computers,
but also about the aggregate rate among many
pairs of computers.
✦Security — How vulnerable your data and sys-
tems are to accidental or malicious damage
(or theft).
✦Scalability — Networks grow, and you’ll want
to be able to accommodate growth without
having to rip all your equipment out and start
over. You’ll need to think about connecting
more users, more sites, more storage, and
more capacity.

Larger networks require you think about the latency and jitter across your net-
work, and about both redundancy and uninterruptible power. You’ll no doubt
consider other factors speciﬁc to your situation, too, so rather than attempt 
to give you a step-by-step recipe for assembling a local area network — and
inevitably fail to cover your actual situation — we’ll start by describing a very
simple network, touching on the most important concepts, and then move on
to discuss more complex ones.
The simplest network is two computers connected back-to-back using Ethernet
network interfaces and a crossover cable rather than a standard straight-
through patch cable (see Chapter 12 for what those are). Figure 13-1 shows
what that looks like.
Figure 13-1: The simplest LAN uses a crossover cable 
between two PCs.
The performance you get from this simple LAN is better than almost any other
network you can make because with full-duplex–capable network adapters, it
runs at full speed both ways without any possibility of collisions. Using
100Base-T adapters, you see 100 Mbps both ways, or 200 Mbps total. That’s a
signiﬁcant speed advantage. For example, suppose you start transmitting two
large ﬁles, one from each of the machines in Figure 13-1 to the other. On a half-
duplex network, either one computer or the other — but not both — can trans-
mit. If both want to transmit (as is likely if both have large ﬁles to send), one
has to wait. The net effect is that the total bits per second you can transmit
over the network is substantially less than the raw rate of the cable — it’s the
raw rate less the time for a lot of things:
✦Time spent waiting to see if it’s okay to transmit
✦Time spent waiting to retransmit after a collision
✦Time lost because a transmission was garbled because of collision
✦Time lost retransmitting data that didn’t get to the destination
✦Time spent waiting for the destination to reply that it received the
transmission
The wasted time goes up as you attach more computers to the network
because it is likely that more than one computer will want to transmit at any
one time. The wasted time also goes up as the length of the cable (and there-
fore the end-to-end signal propagation time) increases because it is more likely
that two computers at either end of the cable may start to transmit within the
time window required for propagation along the length of the cable.
10/100/1000Base-T
194 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

Full- and half-duplex operation matters because it’s likely you want to have
more than two computers on your network. When that day comes, you need 
a hub or a switch to join all the network segments, as in Figure 13-2. You have
to replace the crossover cable when you add the hub or switch because the
topology in Figure 13-2 is designed for straight-through patch cables.
Figure 13-2: Adding a third PC requires joining the 
separate network segments with a hub or switch.
Whether you choose a hub or a switch to join the segments determines whether
your network runs half- or full-duplex, and so has a major effect on your network
speed. Both a hub and a switch connect all the connected network segments
electrically, but if you use a hub, you only get half-duplex operation. You need
a switch to run full-duplex.
Ethernet Switches
The reason a hub forces half-duplex operation is that, internally, it connects 
all the segments together all the time. That permanent connection forces the
independent physical network segments to look like one larger logical segment
on which only one computer can transmit at a time. An Ethernet switch changes
that, implementing the idea that connections between physical segments need
exist only when there’s network trafﬁc between those segments. Instead of a
single connection joining all segments, you use what’s called a switching fabric
(see Figure 13-3). The switching fabric is capable of connecting any one inter-
face to any other without involving the rest and can create many such connec-
tions at once.
The Ethernet switch’s capability to create independent pairwise connections 
on demand makes each computer-to-computer transmission look like the full-
duplex direct connection in Figure 13-1. Network packets entering the switch 
can go between ports A and D, for example, at the same time other packets go
between B and E or between any other pairing of the remaining ports. Because
of that, although a fully occupied, eight-port hub connecting 100Base-T segments
can transfer no more than 100 megabits per second over the entire LAN, a simi-
lar Ethernet switch can readily transfer up to 400 megabits per second because
it can support four paths independently, and if the full-duplex connections are
busy in both directions, it could transfer up to 800 megabits per second.

Hub
Chapter 13 ✦Hubs, Switches, Routers, and Firewalls 195

Figure 13-3: An Ethernet switch partitions your network 
into separate segments.
Expanding Your Network
Although you can get hubs and switches with tens of ports, you might ﬁnd —
say, for a LAN gaming party — that you need more ports than just one can pro-
vide. The normal ports on a hub or switch are made to connect to PCs, but you
can link hubs and switches together one of two ways. You can either use the
uplink port many hubs and switches provide, connecting an uplink port on one
to a normal port on another, or you can use a crossover cable to connect two
normal ports. (If you’re using crossover cables, we recommend getting them 
in yellow, and buying patch cables in any color but yellow. That way, you can
keep straight what cable does what.)
Figure 13-4 characterizes how you might connect a lot of computers together.
High-trafﬁc computers everyone needs to access might connect directly to the
core switch. Other computers or printers might connect directly, or might con-
nect through smaller attached hubs and switches. A tree architecture, as in
Figure 13-4, is best, and in any event, you want to avoid long strings of hubs.
Any path through a hub is half-duplex; paths exclusively through switches are
full-duplex if the network interfaces in the PCs support full-duplex.
If you have a mix of faster and slower Ethernet technology, the general strategy
is to use the fastest parts in the core of the network where the trafﬁc is greatest
(surrounding the central switch), and the slower ones out at the edges (con-
nected to the outer hubs and switches). Edge clusters with high trafﬁc loads
are candidates for the faster technology if you have enough units. If your net-
work gets large enough, or your trafﬁc is great enough (such as if you’re sling-
ing around raw video ﬁles that are tens of gigabytes long), even 100Base-T can
seem slow — you might selectively inject some gigabit Ethernet if that happens.

Figure 13-4: Cascaded Ethernet switches and hubs
As you add computers to your network, you probably want to use at least one
of them as a server, a computer used to provide network resources. The net-
work in Figure 13-2 with a ﬁle and print server might look something like the
one in Figure 13-5. The computers where you work are called client computers
(using the computer industry’s common client/server terminology).
Figure 13-5: Adding a ﬁle and print server
The advantage of setting up a server — even on a home network — is that it
keeps the resources you use available no matter what’s happening on any
other client PC. Your brother can be crashing his PC hourly, and no matter
what other PC you’re using, you need not care what he’s doing, because your

e-mail ﬁles and the printer are accessible through the server. So long as no one
sits down at the server and starts using it directly as a PC, it should stay stable
and reliable. Better yet, you can load the server up with huge disks and use that
storage from any PC on your network.
Routers
There comes a point when it’s neither practical nor desirable to keep connect-
ing networks together with Ethernet hubs or switches. You don’t want to con-
nect to a network that is not under your control without some safeguards, and
the connections from LANs to the Internet are rarely direct Ethernet feeds.
Instead, you want a way to link your network to other ones, exchanging mes-
sages when needed but otherwise remaining isolated.
Networks solve these problems using a set of conceptual layers, each serving a
different function. Figure 13-6 shows three layers from a larger structure called
the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) Reference Model. The layers shown in
Figure 13-6 are the bottom three of seven layers in the full OSI model:
Figure 13-6: The OSI Reference Model structures network 
systems design.
✦Network layer — The network layer tracks interconnected networks
and routes packets among them. The network layer operates inde-
pendently from the media technology layers below it.
✦Data link layer — The data link layer identiﬁes stations on the medium
and provides low-level control for transmissions between stations. In
an Ethernet network, the data link layer deﬁnes unique identiﬁers for
each station, deﬁnes the way in which stations ﬁnd out each other’s
addresses, and deﬁnes the mechanisms for handling collisions.
✦Physical layer — The transmission media — LANs most commonly
use twisted-pair cables and the electrical drivers for those cables —
form the physical layer. The physical layer converts data to signals
on the network cable and recovers signals from the network back to
data.
Network
The network layer knows about different
interconnected networks and how to route
among them.
Data Link
The data link layer knows how to transfer
data from one node to another.
Physical
The physical layer knows how to put data
on a medium and to recover the data from
the medium at the other end.
198 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

Figure 13-7 shows how two computers connected back-to-back (as in Figure 13-1)
communicate using the OSI Reference Model. A protocol stack implements the
network layers on each computer. Each layer in the stack interoperates as a
peer with the same layer on the other computer, so the network layer on
Computer A in Figure 13-7 communicates peer-to-peer with the network layer
on Computer B. The two network layers don’t connect directly, though — they
have to send messages back and forth through the data link layer. A lower
level peer relationship exists between the data link layers, which in turn com-
municate with each other by sending messages back and forth using the physi-
cal layer. It’s the physical layers that are actually connected, so they have a
real connection and do communicate directly. These three layers of the model
are just that, however, a model. Real networks correspond roughly to the
model, but have differences and make compromises so the overall system runs
efﬁciently and economically.
Figure 13-7: Peer layer communication in a network
The key characteristic distinguishing the network layer from the data link layer
is that the network layer is independent of the underlying media characteris-
tics. Devices operating at the data link layer, such as Ethernet switches, exploit
the physical characteristics of Ethernet (and the similarities among the many
versions of Ethernet) to do their work. Devices operating at the network layer,
called routers, transfer network data from one port to the next with no knowl-
edge of the underlying media connected to the interfaces.
Because networks operate at both media-dependent and media-independent
levels, it follows that your computer has both physical and logical (that is, 
network) addresses.
✦The physical address on an Ethernet (also called a MAC address, for
Media Access Control) is a unique number wired into your Ethernet
card by its manufacturer — the physical address for one of our com-
puters, for example, is 00-20-AF-F8-29-B4.

✦The network address is completely independent of the physical
address — if you change Ethernet cards, for instance, you change the
computer’s physical address but not the network address. Network
addresses for the Internet Protocol (IP) consist (today) of four num-
bers each from 0 to 255, such as 206.142.111.239. Future versions
of IP will add more numbers to those addresses, but the change isn’t
likely for several years.
If you have more than one network interface (a network card and a
modem connected to the Internet, for example), you will have more
than one network address. For example, 206.164.111.239 might be
a network address temporarily assigned to your computer by your
Internet service provider (and therefore assigned to your modem
port), while you might use 192.168.0.1 for your local area network.
To connect two different networks without merging them physically, you need
a device — a router — that joins networks at the network layer, not the data
link layer. Figure 13-8 shows these relationships. Routers contain network-layer
software that connects as a peer to the network software in your computer,
receives messages, decides which port leads to the message’s destination, and
sends the message down to the data link layer in the right protocol stack.
Figure 13-8: The network layer joins otherwise incompatible networks.
Suppose software on your computer needs to send a message to a computer
on the Internet. Your software passes the message to the IP network layer on
your computer, which ﬁgures out which of the data links on your computer
leads to the Internet. The message gets handed off to the data link layer for
that interface, passed to the physical layer, and sent down the wire. The physi-
cal layer in the router picks up the message and percolates it up through the
data link layer to the network layer in the router. That software in turn ﬁgures
out that the next data link to receive the message is the one leading to the
Internet, and sends it down the protocol stack and on its way.

200 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

The magic is that the IP network layer in the router allows the data link and
physical layers to need peer relationships only with compatible hardware and
software at the other end of a connection. The data link layer and physical
hardware in your computer — an Ethernet card — don’t know and don’t care
that the ultimate connection is out to the Internet, or that that connection is
through a modem and not the Ethernet. Similarly, the modem data link layer
and hardware don’t know and don’t care what your local area network looks
like. The network layer in the router is the only software that has any tie to
both links. This is weapons-grade magic because it means that, no matter what
kind of network you want to attach to your local area network, the right router
(meaning one with the right data link and physical interfaces) can do the job
without any change in your local network.
Transmission Control Protocol
Most of the time, you hear IP, the Internet routing layer, mentioned as part of
TCP/IP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The
reason for that is that very little software actually talks to IP directly because
IP itself leaves a lot of network-induced problems unsolved. Protocols above IP,
such as TCP, solve those problems.
The ﬁrst problem IP has that you need to solve comes from IP’s function, which
is to route information from here to there and back. IP doesn’t guarantee that
your messages will actually arrive at the destination, doesn’t guarantee that
they’ll arrive in the order you sent, and doesn’t give you any indication of
whether the network has the capacity to transmit as much data as you want.
Every one of these problems stems from the nature of the underlying network:
✦Unreliable delivery — Neither IP nor the Internet itself guarantees
that the data you send will get anywhere. Your Internet connection
could get dropped, the modem could garble the data, a communica-
tions link could be full to capacity, the computer at the other end
could mishandle the message, or a thousand other things could go
wrong. Any one of them can cause your message to get lost.
✦Out-of-order delivery — IP and the Internet don’t make any promises
about the order in which messages get delivered. Because it takes a
lot of messages across the Internet to do anything useful, they can
arrive in a sequence very different from the one in which they were
transmitted. Most programs send messages and replies in a tightly
deﬁned sequence, so out-of-order delivery would be very confusing.
It would be like getting the check in a restaurant before you’ve even
seen the menu.
✦Capacity limits — Getting your message sent through your modem
provides no assurance that it’s actually going anywhere. For instance,
suppose your message arrives at a router, but its destination circuit
is already full of trafﬁc. Your message can get dumped if the router
doesn’t have enough memory to hold the incoming messages until
they can get a turn on the output circuit.
Chapter 13 ✦Hubs, Switches, Routers, and Firewalls 201

Every one of these problems is solvable, and most of the time programs com-
municating on the Internet want them to be solved. It’s not efﬁcient to require
every program that communicates over the Internet to include code to solve
the problems independently — that would mean many, many different imple-
mentations, would increase software costs, and would make interoperability
among programs unlikely. Instead, a protocol layer on top of IP — namely,
TCP — provides these services to programs. A program hands data off to TCP
for transmission, and having done so can assume that the data will make it to
the other end intact and in order. If TCP can’t do that, it explicitly notiﬁes the
program. If there are no error notiﬁcations, the program can assume TCP did
its job.
The implementation of how TCP does what it does requires that programmers
handle a mind-numbing set of details, but the ideas behind TCP are pretty
straightforward:
✦Put sequence numbers in messages — Every message TCP sends
out onto the network gets a sequence number. By looking at the
sequence numbers of messages as they come in, the TCP receiver
can tell whether it has the next message yet, or whether it has to
wait for the network to deliver some out-of-order messages.
✦Tell the sender when messages arrive — The TCP receiver sends a
message (an acknowledgment) back to the sender when messages
arrive correctly and in sequence, telling the sender the sequence
number of the highest correctly received message.
✦Retransmit failed messages — The TCP sender keeps a timer for
every message it sends. If the receiver doesn’t acknowledge the mes-
sage within a certain interval of time, the sender retransmits the
message. This process keeps up until TCP has tried a speciﬁed num-
ber of retransmissions, after which it reports an uncorrectable failure
to your program.
✦Retransmit garbled messages — Even if your message gets to its
destination, it might have been corrupted in transmission. TCP uses
error detection codes it wraps around your message to know when
this has happened. When the TCP receiver detects a garbled mes-
sage, it explicitly sends a message back to the sender requesting
retransmission.
Only the garbled (or lost) messages are sent again. If other messages in
the sequence after the bad one arrive properly (even if that happens
before the bad one ﬁnally gets there), they don’t need retransmission.
✦Limit the number of outstanding messages — The TCP sender limits
the number of messages it sends before receiving an acknowledgment,
which has the effect of limiting the average data rate you need on the
connection between you and the destination. More than one message
can be outstanding, however, so in most cases the sender doesn’t have
to wait out the round-trip delay for an acknowledgment to arrive.
Sending multiple messages in advance of acknowledgment greatly
increases the amount of data you can get through the connection.
202 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

Don’t assume that when someone refers to TCP/IP (including in this book) that
the reference is exclusively to TCP and IP — it’s common usage to call the com-
plete set of Internet protocols TCP/IP.
User Datagram Protocol
The reliable transport services of TCP come at a price. In particular, the need
to wait for acknowledgment messages limits the data rate you can put into the
communications channel. This limitation (along with all the other work TCP
does) creates an additional processing load at both ends of the channel.
Some applications, including Internet phone and videoconferencing, and many
multi-player Internet games, can’t afford the overhead TCP imposes. The vol-
ume of data those applications send and their need for uninterrupted data ﬂow
make the waits TCP can impose for message acknowledgments unworkable.
Take Internet videoconferencing, perhaps using Microsoft’s NetMeeting, as an
example. If your data does get damaged in transit, the worst that’s likely to hap-
pen is that you’ll see a glitch in the video or hear noise in the audio. Slowing
the data transmission — one consequence of what TCP does to provide reli-
able delivery — reduces the frame rate and creates gaps in the sound. Because
your eyes and ears handle noise better than gaps, you’re better off with more
data, even if it contains a few errors.
The situation is about the same for multi-player games across the Internet. The
rapid, timely ﬂow of data between computers is more important than getting
every bit right — the programs mostly send updates to the same data over and
over, so even if you drop a message, it won’t matter.
The Internet protocols solve this problem by replacing TCP with the User
Datagram Protocol (UDP), which does none of the corrective things TCP does.
UDP does not provide in-order delivery, acknowledgments, retransmissions, or
ﬂow control. It’s relatively basic, but in exchange for that simplicity UDP gets
more data sent for a given link capacity and imposes less workload on the
processor.
Domain Name Service
A usable network needs to do a few more things than move messages around.
One of the most important is providing a way to translate the computer names
people deal with (for example, www.theonion.com) to the numbers computers
want to see (such as 66.216.104.235). The Internet function that does this
for you is called the Domain Name Service. Computers providing that service
are called domain name servers. Both phrases are abbreviated DNS.
Internet domains are a hierarchical structure based on the words you ﬁnd 
separated by dots in computer names. The last word in the computer name
(for example, com) is the least speciﬁc part of the domain name, called the 
top-level domain name. Common top-level domains include .com, .org, and
.net, plus ones for each country; there’s a reasonably comprehensive list at
www.norid.no/domenenavnbaser/domreg.html.
Chapter 13 ✦Hubs, Switches, Routers, and Firewalls 203

The word immediately to the left of the root is the domain name (for example,
idsoftware in www.idsoftware.com). Domain names are chosen by their own-
ers (for example, id Software). There are really no controls on who can register
a name, but a given name can be registered by only one person or organization
(so it’s unique on the Internet). The lack of controls has spawned some inter-
esting disputes after someone unrelated to a company registered the name the
company would most likely want (for example, disputes followed registration
of mtv.com and gateway.com because the companies you instinctively think
of weren’t who registered the names).
Finally, the rest of the words in the computer name are subdomains, with the
leftmost word being the computer itself. In the name www.idsoftware.com,
www is the computer name. Similarly, in the name clyde.isp.net, clyde is the
computer name. The complete name less the computer name (isp.net) is
commonly called the domain name, but in fact all the subsets (isp.net and
net in this case) are domain names, too.
Network Security and Firewalls
The analogy between the Internet and the real world is remarkably
complete — there are many good people in both, and enough losers to make
both the Internet and the real world places to be careful. As in the real world,
though, attacks and threats on the Internet don’t just occur randomly — they
happen in predictable ways. The seven layer OSI model, of which you saw the
lower three layers in Figure 13-6, gives you a good framework with which to
analyze Internet security. Figure 13-9 shows the complete seven layer model,
and describes the sort of attacks you can anticipate at each layer of the model.
Most of the attacks you’ll hear about in the media occur at the application
layer, going after Web servers, browsers, and the information they have access
to, but application layer attacks on unprotected or vulnerable services are
common, as are data link layer attacks on unprotected wireless networks.

Using only speciﬁc defenses against the many speciﬁc threats isn’t terribly
worthwhile because, like the sturdy but useless Maginot Line, the defense fails
the ﬁrst time an unanticipated threat shows up. You can, however, use an
understanding of attacks in terms of how they operate against the seven layer
model to deploy defenses against entire classes of threats at once. Two main
approaches are the most useful:
✦Packet ﬁlters — You can examine trafﬁc at the network layer, looking
at the source and destination addresses. The ﬁlter can disallow trafﬁc
to or from speciﬁc addresses and ports and can disallow trafﬁc with
suspect address patterns.
✦Firewalls — You can also examine trafﬁc as high as the application
layer, checking the internal content of speciﬁc application messages.
Trafﬁc that fails those tests can be rejected.
Hardware packet ﬁlters are simple, inexpensive, and can block many incoming
attacks. Hardware ﬁrewalls are more expensive; most home and small ofﬁce net-
works can use a combination of hardware packet ﬁlters and software ﬁrewalls.
Packet ﬁlters
Internet messages use an IP address to locate the speciﬁc machine, and a port
number to identify the program that will handle the message. The combined
address/port information is available in nearly every TCP/IP message and is
available for both the sender and receiver of the message. Packet ﬁlters look at
the TCP/IP addresses, and possibly the port numbers, although not the inter-
nal content of messages.
Packet ﬁlters generally operate using a top-to-bottom list of rules. For example,
a somewhat secure rule set might be the sequence, in order:
1. Permit all outgoing trafﬁc.
2. Deny new incoming connections.
3. Accept everything else.
This rule set improves your LAN’s security because it rejects unsolicited con-
nection attempts from the Internet to your computers. It explicitly protects
against unauthorized access to shared drives and ﬁles because it blocks
incoming trafﬁc using TCP. A ﬁlter using this rule set breaks the normal proto-
col between FTP clients and servers because normal FTP operation includes a
connection from the server into the client, but you can ﬁx that by reconﬁgur-
ing your FTP client to specify passive (or PASV) mode. Essentially all FTP soft-
ware today supports PASV mode.
You’d use this packet ﬁlter in a router connecting your computer to the
Internet, as shown in Figure 13-10. By placing the ﬁlter between the LAN and
the Internet, you’re guaranteed all Internet trafﬁc goes through the ﬁlter. If
your packet ﬁlter software is capable enough to examine the subnet of the
source address based on which physical port delivers the message to the
router, you can set up rules to avoid spoofed TCP/IP addresses (see the text in
Chapter 13 ✦Hubs, Switches, Routers, and Firewalls 205

Figure 13-10). Spooﬁng makes messages from the Internet appear to have origi-
nated on your LAN; the spooﬁng ﬁlter prevents this by rejecting messages
coming on a port with impossible source addresses. The anti-spooﬁng ﬁlter is
an important part of protecting machines on your network on which you’ve
installed ﬁlters to limit particular services to machines on your subnet.
Figure 13-10: Packet ﬁlter deployment
Network Address Translation
The inexpensive hardware routers now available, such as the Microsoft wire-
less IEEE 802.11g base station discussed in Chapter 12, improve your LAN
security by rejecting incoming packets that aren’t responses to requests from
your PC, but do it with a very different approach called Network Address
Translation (NAT).
The original impetus for the development of NAT was the problem of sharing a
single Internet IP address among several PCs. NAT maps normal network mes-
sages on your LAN, using individual IP addresses and standard port numbers
on all your PCs, to a single IP address and a large number of otherwise unre-
lated port numbers for transport out on the Internet. Your Internet IP address
will be assigned by your ISP; your LAN addresses will likely use one of the
three ranges of private IP addresses in Table 13-1 (more on private addresses
in the next chapter).
Messages from the LAN
to the packet filter must
have a source address in
the LAN subnet.
Otherwise, they have a
spoofed source address.
Messages from the
Internet to the packet
filter may not have a
source address in the
LAN subnet. If they do,
they have a spoofed
source address.

A pure NAT implementation rejects all unsolicited incoming messages because
it doesn’t know which PC is the intended destination. That’s the same effect as
the rule set mentioned earlier, but with the added beneﬁt that you need only
one live Internet address. That saves you money if your Internet access charges
more for additional IP addresses. However, at times, you want to accept incoming
trafﬁc, such as to access video from the home surveillance system on your PC. 
Chapter 23 shows you how to set up the surveillance, and the sidebar
“Cable/DSL Router Security and TrackerCam” shows you how to forward
selected incoming messages from the Internet to one speciﬁc PC.
Standalone ﬁrewalls
Packet ﬁlters and NAT reject incoming attacks, so they protect you from worms
and keep people from connecting to your shared disk drives, but don’t protect
you from messages you choose to receive, such as e-mail and Web pages.
Firewalls examine more information than a packet ﬁlter, so they can exercise a
ﬁner degree of control over what moves between your LAN and the Internet and
have the potential to identify e-mail viruses and other threats before they reach
their target application. Figure 13-11 shows an abbreviated sketch of the TCP/IP
packet headers, illustrating the difference between packet ﬁlters and ﬁrewalls by
highlighting what parts of a TCP/IP packet is examined by each. The ﬁrewall has
all the information available to the packet ﬁlter, but also examines the source
and destination port numbers and the content of the packet data.
That additional information gives a ﬁrewall far more power than the simpler
packet ﬁlter because the additional information gives the ﬁrewall the capability
to look all the way up the protocol stack to the application layers. Using that
information, a ﬁrewall can, in addition to controlling access to and from spe-
ciﬁc host addresses, do the following:
✦Allow or disallow speciﬁc application services such as FTP or Web
pages
✦Allow or disallow access to services based on the content of the infor-
mation being transferred (such as scanning for viruses and Trojans)
Combinations of these functions are possible too, such as only allowing incom-
ing FTP access from the Internet to a speciﬁc designated server.
Chapter 13 ✦Hubs, Switches, Routers, and Firewalls 207

Figure 13-11: Packet ﬁlter and ﬁrewall information sources
The capability to screen trafﬁc based on message content makes it possible to
create ﬁlters for objectionable content, such as sites inappropriate for minors
(although it’s very hard to deﬁne rules for that ﬁltering, which is why there are
companies whose business is to sell lists of sites you might want to ﬁlter for
various reasons, along with ﬁlter software to use based on those lists). Content
screening also makes possible defenses against speciﬁc attacks by looking for
telltale signatures in the incoming attacking packets. When the ﬁrewall detects
those signatures, it discards the packets and logs the events.
The most direct implementation of a ﬁrewall uses the same architecture shown
in Figure 13-10, but sites a ﬁrewall between the LAN and the ISP rather than a
packet ﬁlter. This is the most secure application of a single ﬁrewall because it
protects all the computers behind the ﬁrewall.
A problem exists with the Figure 13-10 architecture, however, because it provides
no good place to locate publicly accessible servers. You don’t want servers out
on the Internet in front of the ﬁrewall, where they’re unprotected, but you don’t
want them behind the ﬁrewall either because you have to create holes in the
ﬁrewall protection to permit access to the servers. A variant of Figure 13-10,
shown in Figure 13-12, is a good answer to this problem. The ﬁrewall router in
the ﬁgure has three ports, rather than the two on the earlier packet ﬁlter. The
third port connects to another LAN typically called the demilitarized zone
(DMZ). The idea is that the computers in the DMZ are less secure than those
back on the secure LAN, but in return those computers are accessible from the
Internet. You put Web and FTP servers in the DMZ, keeping all other computers
back on the secure LAN. The rules in the ﬁrewall prevent incoming trafﬁc to the
secure LAN, allowing only outgoing connections. The DMZ LAN is intentionally

less secure, but you should still restrict what can be done there. You should use
anti-spooﬁng ﬁlters, limit the allowable ports to those used by the servers on the
LAN, and disallow access from known attacking sites.
Figure 13-12: Demilitarized zone (DMZ) used with a ﬁrewall
We can’t recommend a hardware router running NAT highly enough as the ﬁrst
line of defense between your LAN and the Internet. Commercial Cable/DSL
routers with Ethernet interfaces are regularly advertised on sale for $30 or
less, and if you have both an old retired PC and some ability with Linux, the
Linux Router Project (LRP) has software you can use to convert that old
machine (see lrp.steinkuehler.net/DiskImages/Dachstein.htm) into a
ﬁrst-class router.
On-computer ﬁrewalls
Don’t think you’re defenseless without a hardware router or ﬁrewall between
your LAN and the Internet. Even if you use a product like Windows’ Internet
Connection Sharing to let one of your computers tie a modem to your LAN,
you can still improve your network security.
The firewall can implement  
a very strict security policy  
for the secure LAN, such as
permitting only outbound traffic.
A looser security policy
makes the DMZ LAN less
secure, but makes access
to the servers from the
Internet possible.

Start by analyzing the threats:
✦The PC hosting the modem, ICS, and the network interface card (NIC)
is vulnerable to attacks at all levels shown in Figure 13-9.
✦The LAN itself is reasonably protected from attack by the NAT layer.
The LAN uses private addresses not routable on the Internet itself.
Threats from servers back to client software are possible, as is
access to content you might choose to block in some circumstances.
The biggest threat is to the PC directly connected to the Internet; the answer 
is either to install a packet ﬁlter or ﬁrewall product directly on that computer,
or to have your ISP install packet ﬁlter or ﬁrewall protection for your access.
The latter isn’t widely available from ISPs; a more readily available solution 
is a PC-hosted solution such as Zone Labs’ ZoneAlarm. Combine that with
antivirus, anti-spam, and anti-adware software, and you’ll be reasonably well
protected. Don’t forget to check for and apply security patches to your soft-
ware as they are issued.
Summary
✦Consider individual and aggregate network capacity requirements in
designing local area networks.
✦Network performance is not uniform — it varies across physical
regions of your network.
✦As your requirements go up, you gain capacity by subdividing your
shared media segments into independent ones.
✦Hardware routers and ﬁrewalls can give your network better security
at low cost.

any people believe networks are simply incom-
prehensible. Networks are more complicated
than individual standalone PCs because you have to
deal with the interactions as well as the PCs themselves,
but networks are organized in a deﬁnite, hierarchical
way. If you work your way through that hierarchy, you’ll
understand there’s a consistency to them that makes
working with networks straightforward.
Network Protocols
Computers talk to one another only in very structured
ways. A computer has to identify itself and carry on a
“conversation” with another computer to cause that
remote computer to do some work. Because computers
lack the ﬂexibility of people, those conversations consist
of precisely formatted messages sent between the com-
puters following a strict, rigid pattern called a protocol.
The jobs protocols carry out on your network are typi-
cally some of these:
✦Exchange and forward messages
✦Ensure messages are received correctly, and in
the proper order
✦Identify other computers able to communicate
✦Interpret from human-readable computer
names to numeric addresses and back
✦Provide services to other computers and
access services on those computers
✦Examine credentials of users attempting to use
network resources
✦Provide secure message transmission using
encryption

The universal way people describe network layers is the Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) reference model. Figure 14-1 shows the layers in the OSI
model, from the hardware functions at Layer 1 to the application functions at
Layer 7. The annotations at the right of the ﬁgure name elements occurring at
each layer, including network interface cards that implement Layer 1 and the
TCP protocol that implements Layer 4.
Figure 14-1: The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model
The TCP/IP protocol suite, the backbone of the Internet, evolved from a proj-
ect to connect multiple networks together into a larger, survivable whole. The
predecessor of the Internet, what was called the ARPANET, used 50 Kbps tele-
phone lines for the network backbone and evolved to the multigigabit-per-
second ﬁber-optic backbone of the Internet today. Changes and extensions to
TCP/IP are managed by a volunteer organization called the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF). Anyone can propose changes or extensions to TCP/IP, but
nothing will happen unless the IETF agrees.
Inside the Network Pipes
We’ve said on many occasions that nearly everything involving a lot of
money — such as medicine, rocket engines, and networks — is ultimately
plumbing. Network plumbing makes the applications you use work, implement-
ing the transport between your computer and servers across the network.

Media and network addresses
You don’t need a map or street address to get to work or home because you
know physically where you’re going. However, a cross-country vacation drive
to Butchart Gardens (www.butchartgardens.com) requires ﬁnding the address
and looking it up on a map. You use the city to decide what highways to travel,
and use the street address to home in on the garden entrance. On the second
day, you know how to get there from your hotel using the physical location
you learned once you reached the gardens the ﬁrst time.
Networks follow the same model. The Media Access Control (MAC) address of 
a computer on a LAN is the equivalent of physical knowledge of where you’re
going, and is wired into the network interface card. The network address (most
often an IP protocol address) is the equivalent of a building’s mailing address.
MAC addresses are scattered randomly on networks, much like street
addresses in the real world; logical addresses follow a pattern determined by
network administrators and are stored in routing tables which are themselves
like street maps for your network. An upgrade is slowly rolling out across the
Internet to increase the number of logical TCP/IP network addresses, but the
current version of TCP/IP (called IPv4) will hold sway for many years to come.
IPv4 represents network addresses as a sequence of four decimal numbers,
each called an octet and ranging from 0 to 255. You write octets with a dot
between them, such as 19.38.40.206.
A TCP/IP message to a computer not part of your LAN goes to the computer
deﬁned as the default route. That computer (or router) has the responsibility 
to forward the message on a communications link leading to the destination,
using routing tables to identify the correct link. Default routing usually sends
messages from your LAN through a computer or router connected to your
Internet service provider (ISP). A chain of routers, starting at your ISP, cooper-
ates to deliver the message on the LAN hosting the destination computer.
A standard TCP/IP utility called traceroute (tracert under Windows) shows
you how a message routes from one computer to another. You can run tracert
in a Windows DOS window. Alternatively, graphical traceroute programs are
available over the Web, with versions available for your PC, too:
1. Assuming you have a computer hooked to the Internet, open a Web
browser and go to the address http://visualroute.visualware.com,
which is a public service maintained by the company that developed
the excellent VisualRoute traceroute program. You’ll have to register
by giving them an electronic mail address to use this server; if you
don’t want to do that, ﬁnd another server at www.traceroute.org.
2. Enter the destination TCP/IP address (216.234.247.68 in the earlier

lines 4 to 10 suggest the time difference between lines 3 and 4 is due
to a transport delay.
The protocol software in the operating system delivers arriving messages to
the software implementing the service requested by the sender. Port numbers
in messages tell the protocol software which message receiver on the machine
gets the message. A complete Internet address includes the port number and
the TCP/IP address. Most Web servers listen on port 80, for example, so con-
necting to the Wiley Web server on the computer www.wiley.com requires the
complete address 208.215.179.146:80. Your client software provides default
port numbers, which you can override.
Overall, network addresses have three levels:
✦Logical addresses route messages traveling to the destination across
wide area networks.
✦Physical addresses route messages on local area network physical
segments and, therefore, onto the destination computer.
✦Port numbers dispatch the message to the right software.

Domain Name Service and Address Resolution
Protocol
People don’t remember strings of arbitrary numbers well. You’re likely to have
to work to care about the Internet address 66.135.192.87, but you probably
know about www.ebay.com. Worse yet is that changes eBay makes in their
infrastructure could alter the numeric address of the computer, invalidating
the numeric address you ﬁnally memorized.
No one explicitly cares about MAC addresses. Wide area networks (WANs)
require logical network addresses, and the ways systems use MAC addresses
are all invisible. Indeed, even logical addresses are somewhat submerged
because people use names that the network converts behind the scenes to 
the logical addresses.
Two TCP/IP protocols do the name/address conversions:
✦Domain Name Service (DNS) — DNS converts between computer
names and logical addresses. Your computer queries a domain name
server, also called a DNS, and receives back the address. DNS trans-
lates from names to numbers or numbers to names, depending on
the request.
✦Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) — ARP translates logical to
physical addresses. There’s no ARP server; the collection of comput-
ers on the LAN cooperate through the protocol to provide resolution
services.
Computer names are organized hierarchically on the Internet. The root is
unnamed; immediately underneath are the top-level domains such as .com,
.org, .net, .jp (Japan), .uk (United Kingdom), and .au (Australia). The author-
ized set of top-level domains is maintained online by the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (IANA) at www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm.
People and organizations can register domain names (such as wiley.com)
under each top-level domain. The owners of speciﬁc names have the ability 
to use the names directly (you can send mail to addresses at wiley.com, for
example), or to further subdivide the domain with a ﬁner-grained structure
(www.wiley.com is the Wiley Web server within wiley.com).
Master domain name servers maintain the domain name search tree, with sub-
ordinate computers branching below the master servers to handle lower levels.
Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP)
Except for the fact that you have to assign a unique network address to every
computer and tell each computer its Internet gateway address to provide a
default route, TCP/IP is quite simple to use. Software implementing the Dynamic
Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) can make the address and gateway assign-
ment process automatic for standalone or connected networks, making TCP/IP
the right protocol choice for all LANs.
Chapter 14 ✦Conﬁguring a Windows Network 215

DHCP works in an incremental fashion to give a computer its address and 
gateway:
1. Find a DHCP server. The computer requesting an address assign-
ment starts with no address and no information about the LAN, so its
ﬁrst task is to ﬁnd a server. The computer does that with a broadcast
message, which is a message sent to any computer physically able to
receive it.
2. Ask for an address. Asking for an address is implicit in the broadcast
message looking for a server, but is a required function of the protocol.
3. Receive an address from the server. Servers receiving the broadcast
request message send back a message directly to the client with the
allocated TCP/IP address. The server replies using the MAC address
contained in the broadcast request because the destination machine
receiving the reply doesn’t have its address yet.
4. Accept and install the assigned address. The PC looking for an
address might receive assignments from several servers, so it sends
messages to one of the servers saying it accepted the address and
tells the rejected servers they can make the address available again.
The PC sets up its assigned address and joins the network.
DHCP does a few more things behind the scenes:
✦Netmask — TCP/IP addresses segment into both a network number
and the host number identifying the speciﬁc computer in the network.
A value called the netmask lets TCP/IP break the overall address apart.
A typical netmask value is 255.255.255.0, which identiﬁes the upper
three octets of the IP address as identifying the subnet and the lower
octet as identifying the computer itself. If you applied a netmask of
255.255.255.0 to the address 216.234.247.68, the subnet would
be 216.234.247.0, and the computer-speciﬁc identiﬁcation (or node
number) would be 68. Because DHCP delivers the netmask along with
the address, the partitioning of the overall address into network and
node subaddresses is dynamic and can be set to reﬂect the number of
computers on the LAN.
✦Default gateway — Typical computers on a LAN won’t know the
details of their default route to send messages to other subnets.
DHCP provides the default gateway address when it sends the
address assigned to the requesting computer.
✦Name server address — A computer requesting automatic TCP/IP
address assignment also isn’t likely to know the address of a local
domain name server, so DHCP responses include the DNS address
too. After it knows the DNS address, a PC can look up numeric
addresses for any name.
✦Address lease expiration — Computers get moved around and con-
nected to or disconnected from networks. They crash, too; all these
actions present the opportunity for TCP/IP addresses to fall out of
216 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

use. A DHCP server has a limited range of TCP/IP addresses it’s per-
mitted to hand out, so the protocol includes a timer that, when it
expires, causes the assigned address to become invalid and become
available for reassignment. In DHCP terms, assigning an address to a
client is called leasing the address to the client; when the timer runs
out, the lease is said to have expired. At that time the client is required
to request a new TCP/IP address from the server. There’s a provision
in the protocol to request the same TCP/IP address as the client had
before, so it’s possible for renewed leases to be invisible to computers
communicating with the DHCP client over a lease renewal.
If you don’t use DHCP, you can set TCP/IP addresses, netmasks, default gate-
ways, and DNS addresses manually on each PC. Regardless of how you assign
addresses, though, you have to decide what addresses to use. You have three
options:
✦Use assigned addresses — If your LAN is connected to the Internet,
you’ll be assigned a block of TCP/IP addresses by your Internet serv-
ice provider (ISP). You can conﬁgure those addresses into your PCs
along with the ISP’s DNS address and the address of the router the
PCs use to access the Internet.
✦Use arbitrary addresses — Standalone networks you will never 
connect to the Internet can use any TCP/IP addresses whatsoever.
Should you change your mind and go to connect to the Internet at
some later time, though, you’ll have to change the TCP/IP address of
every computer on your LAN. That’s easy if you’ve used DHCP, and
really tedious if you conﬁgured all the addresses manually.
✦Use private addresses — The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA) reserves three blocks in the TCP/IP address space for private
networks. You can use addresses from any of the three blocks, which
themselves differ in how many hosts they permit within a subnet. No
address in any of these blocks is directly routable across the Internet.
The IANA-reserved blocks are shown in Table 14-1. Legitimate TCP/IP
addresses formed from the subnet address in the second row would
be 172.16.0.1, 172.16.0.2, and so on up to 172.31.255.254.

Chapter 14 ✦Conﬁguring a Windows Network 217

The ﬁrst node address in Table 14-1 is reserved as part of the formal subnet
address, while the last node address is reserved as the broadcast address for
the subnet. Because those two addresses are reserved in every address block,
a block of 16 node addresses (for example) has only 14 usable addresses. The
Number of Usable Addresses column at the right of Table 14-1 shows the maxi-
mum number of addresses less two, so it’s the maximum number of computers
and other devices you could connect to one subnet in the block. You’re not
likely to ﬁll any of the blocks.
Routers commonly implement a technology called Network Address Translation
(NAT) that enables you to route from computers using these addresses to the
Internet. The individual computers can initiate transactions out to the Internet
through the NAT function, but computers on the Internet can’t see your com-
puters unless you make special provisions in the router. That invisibility pro-
vides additional security to your computers. See Chapter 13 for how to set up
routers and NAT and how to set up TCP/IP on your PC.
Conﬁguring TCP/IP
Windows 2000 and Windows XP provide a network properties dialog box you
use to install software components and conﬁgure settings for your LAN. You can
access the dialog box through Network and Dial-up Connections in the Control
Panel. Double-click on that icon, click the right mouse button on the LAN con-
nection icon in the resulting Windows Explorer display, and launch Properties
for the connection. Figure 14-2 shows the dialog box.
Figure 14-2: Windows 2000 and 
Windows XP network connection 
properties
218 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

Choose Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) in the list of components and then click on
Properties to bring up the dialog box in Figure 14-3. If you’re running a DHCP
server on your LAN (such as from a router connected to the Internet, as in
Chapter 13), the automatic settings shown for both the IP address and the DNS
server address are what you want. If you’re entering either the IP address or
the DNS address manually, select the appropriate option and type in the corre-
sponding numeric values (no names are allowed here). You’ll need the subnet
mask and default gateway address along with the IP address.
Figure 14-3: Use the TCP/IP Properties 
dialog box to set up network addressing.
The easiest approach, by far, is to run DHCP in a router. For manual address-
ing, if you have a standalone LAN or your router provides Network Address
Translation between the LAN and the Internet, you can use the addresses from
Table 14-1. If your LAN is directly routable to the Internet, with no NAT function,
you’ll need to use addresses provided by your Internet service provider.
You conﬁgure TCP/IP for Windows 98 in much the same way as we described for
Windows 2000 and Windows XP. You get to the Properties dialog box through
the Network applet in the Control Panel, leading to a dialog box much like that in
Figure 14-2. TCP/IP properties are organized differently in the Properties dialog
box for the protocol, but the information is essentially the same.
Conﬁguring File Sharing
Getting useful work done requires that you install software operating at Layers 5
through 7 — applications providing services on the network. Microsoft calls some
of the applications you’ll learn about in this section clients, reﬂecting the fact that
they are clients to servers on other computers. The clients, and the associated
servers, fall in the category of what we’re generically calling applications.
Chapter 14 ✦Conﬁguring a Windows Network 219

You’ll want to add both clients and servers on computers on your LAN. You
might choose to designate speciﬁc computers as ﬁle servers, as shown in
Figure 14-4, and at the same time you might use some of your computers to
provide shared access to your printers. File servers — at least, ones you’d put
on a LAN for home or small business — are simply PCs with a lot of disks
attached. File servers let you put large volumes of disk storage in a single
place rather than on many computers spread across the network. File servers
simplify looking for ﬁles, too, because if you put all your data ﬁles on a single
server, then the ﬁles you’re looking for are in speciﬁc places. When you make
all the computers on your LAN capable of ﬁle sharing, it’s harder to know
where to look for shared ﬁles.
Figure 14-4: File servers support shared access to ﬁles.
Making it a ﬁle server is one of the best things you can do with an old, spare
computer. Fill it with a lot of disk space and make it the place where you put
all the data ﬁles you work on. You want a ﬁle server to be a computer you 
put in a corner and don’t use directly because computers people leave alone
rather than use to run programs are less likely to crash. When your PC crashes,
though, the ﬁle server keeps on humming, storing the last ﬁle you saved with a
minimum of fuss and ensuring it’s still available even if your computer is thor-
oughly broken.
Windows 2000 and Windows XP
The items shown in the list in Figure 14-2 include the components you need to
let other computers share ﬁles and printers on your PC and to access ﬁles and
printers on other PCs. The key items in the component list in the middle of the
dialog box are Client for Microsoft Networks and File and Printer Sharing for
Microsoft Networks. They should be installed by default, but if not, use the
Install button to add them. Client for Microsoft Networks is a client, while File
and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks is a service.
File server

220 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

The two components have these functions:
✦Client for Microsoft Networks — The Microsoft network client soft-
ware enables you to ﬁnd computers on your network and access
shared ﬁles and printers on them.
✦File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks — The ﬁle and
printer sharing software is the server component corresponding to
the Microsoft Networks client, responding to requests from the client
for access to resources on the server computer.
After you have both running, share a disk or folder by opening Windows
Explorer and right-clicking the drive or folder you want to share. If you’re run-
ning Windows 2000 or Windows XP Professional, left-clicking Properties displays
the dialog box shown on the left in Figure 14-5. Clicking the Share this folder
control enables the lower controls in the dialog box, but might give a share
name such as E$. Use the New Share button to create a share with the right
name and then click the Permissions button to bring up the dialog box on the
right side of Figure 14-5. Verify that the names listed in the dialog box have the
right access permissions, but be careful not to be too broad with permissions
unless your PCs are behind a ﬁrewall.
Figure 14-5: Enable Windows 2000 and Windows XP Professional ﬁle 
sharing and set permissions with these dialog boxes.
Microsoft wrote Windows XP Home assuming home users can’t ﬁgure out the
dialog boxes in Figure 14-5, giving you instead the dialog box in Figure 14-6.
Check the “Share this folder on the network” control to enable read access to
the drive or folder; check “Allow network users to change my ﬁles” to enable
read/write access.

Windows 98
Windows 98 also uses the Client for Microsoft Networks and File and Printer
Sharing for Microsoft Networks components. Installing and conﬁguring those
components on Windows 98 is similar to the process for Windows 2000 and
Windows XP, but not identical. Start the Network control panel applet (Start ➪
Settings ➪Control Panel ➪Network) to begin the process. Windows will have
installed the Client for Microsoft Networks automatically when you added the
network adapter; if not, click Add, then Client, and then Add. That sequence
brings up the Select Network Client dialog box, where you’ll select Microsoft,
then Client for Microsoft Networks. Click OK and you’ll return to the Network
applet.
Click the File and Print Sharing button in the Network applet and then select
ﬁle and/or print sharing in the resulting dialog box to direct Windows to add
the server components. You have to reboot after you click OK all the way out
of the sequence of dialog boxes.
Conﬁguring Printer Sharing
The same server software we just described in the preceding section for ﬁle shar-
ing implements printer sharing, too. You share a printer in much the same way 
as a drive or folder — right-click the printer in the Printers section of the Control
Panel and then select Sharing. Under Windows 2000 and Windows XP, you’ll see a
dialog box such as in Figure 14-7. Select Share this printer, type in a share name,
and click OK. The printer will be visible to all computers on your LAN.
Windows 98 provides a similar dialog box you set up in much the same way.

Summary
✦Networks operate through layered, well-deﬁned, highly structured
conversations called protocols.
✦Protocols are implemented by software components you install into
the operating system and by applications embodying higher level
protocols.
✦Setting up your network software involves making sure you have the
necessary protocols installed and conﬁgured.
✦Old computers often make good ﬁle and print servers when they’re
no longer fast enough for direct use.

he protocols you learned about in Chapter 13 that
make the Internet work — IP, DNS, and their
friends — don’t themselves do work you care about
directly. All they do is transport messages from one
place to another. Programs that do work over the
Internet that you care about use protocols, too, but
more importantly use those protocols to access serv-
ices on remote computers. You’ll learn about Internet
protocols and services in this chapter, as well as about
the attacks directed at your PC across the Internet and
what you can do in defense.
Internet Services
Using an Internet service is very much like making a
telephone call. You start the program (pick up the
phone), choose which remote computer will handle
your request (dial the number), and wait for it to do
your work (your friend picks up the phone). A program
on the remote computer responds to your request for
service (answers the phone in our analogy). That pro-
gram sits in the server computer you connect to, waiting
for a message from your client computer to arrive.
Ping
The simplest client/server pair forms a service called
ping, which lets you ﬁnd out whether another com-
puter is reachable on the Internet and, if so, how long
the round trip to that computer and back takes in mil-
liseconds. The ping server software is really built into

the IP protocol software handling the server computer’s network trafﬁc — it’s
not a separate program. A typical invocation of ping (from a Windows DOS
window) looks like this:
Pinging wiley.com [208.215.179.146] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 208.215.179.146: bytes=32 time=206ms TTL=244
Reply from 208.215.179.146: bytes=32 time=225ms TTL=244
Reply from 208.215.179.146: bytes=32 time=190ms TTL=244
Reply from 208.215.179.146: bytes=32 time=223ms TTL=244
This output shows several things:
✦Decoding names to network addresses — A domain name server
(DNS) resolves machine names to numeric addresses. A single
machine can have many names, all of which resolve to the same
Internet address. In the example just given, the name wiley.com
resolves to the Internet address 208.215.179.146, but if you tried
it, so would www.wiley.com.
✦Round-trip response time — The parts of the replies that say things
like time=206ms show you how long it took from the time the client
machine sent out the ping message until a reply came back (1 ms is
1 millisecond, or one thousandth of a second). The variability in the
times you see reﬂects that networks don’t always respond identically.
Differing amounts of trafﬁc on the communication lines or differing
loads on the server are common causes.
You’ll see very different response times depending on the access
equipment you use. For example, we’ve measured typical ping
responses from a nearby server of 120 ms with a V.90 modem, from
20 to 300 ms with a wireless broadband router and modem, and
under 10 ms with Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL).
✦Routing hop count — The part of the replies that says TTL=244
tells you about the route the message took from here to there. The
acronym TTL stands for Time to Live, which is a measure of how
many reroutings from one point to another the packet has to go
before IP declares it undeliverable. The number following TTL (called
the hop count) is a number that usually starts at 255 and counts
down by one every time the message gets rerouted through an inter-
mediary computer.
ping is one of your most important tools in troubleshooting Internet problems.
It shows you whether the Domain Name Server is working, whether the com-
puter you’re trying to talk to is reachable, and how long it takes to get there. It
does this at a very low level — only the most basic Internet functions have to
be up and running.
World Wide Web
The Internet service you’re most likely to use (with the possible exception of
electronic mail) is the World Wide Web. Your computer runs client software
called a Web browser that talks to Web server software on the remote server
226 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

computer. Your messages are transported across the Internet using the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
The combination of a Web browser, HTTP, and a Web server is more complex
than many other protocols because in combination they do much more than
move information from one place to another. Additional functions the combina-
tion supports include the following:
✦Page formatting — Messages sent from the Web server to your Web
browser are coded in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which
deﬁnes an embedded structure and a set of codes that tell the Web
browser what the image it displays on your screen should look like.
✦Hypertext links — Links from one page in your Web browser to
another are identiﬁed by special codes in the message from the Web
server. When you click on a link, the Web browser sends a request to
the right Web server (possibly one you’ve not communicated with
previously) to send it the page data.
✦Image, movie, and sound links — Web pages can contain images as
well as text, using codes that specify from where to retrieve the image.
✦Forms — Web pages can contain forms that let you ﬁll in information
and send it out to the Web server. The source code of the Web page
speciﬁes how forms are deﬁned for display on your screen, how that
information gets to the Web server, and what processing software on
the server will do.
Even a single Web page may draw information from more than one Web server.
The Web uses a standard speciﬁcation for addressing servers and information
on those servers. A standard Web address is called a uniform resource locator
(URL). URLs (such as www.aros.net/~press/utilities/utilities.htm)
have three parts:
✦Protocol — The protocol used to access the referenced information
need not be HTTP. It is in the example in the preceding paragraph,
but can equally be other protocols such as FTP (for example, ftp://
ftp.aros.net/pub/users/press/bput95s.zip). The ﬁrst part of
the URL deﬁnes what protocol to use and is separated from the rest
of the URL by the :// characters.
Recent versions of both Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator
let you omit the http:// element from a URL, supplying it for you. If your
URL requires another protocol, you have to provide it.
✦Server — The second part of the URL is the name of the server 
computer holding the information or services you want. This is
www.aros.net and ftp.aros.net in the two preceding examples.
The computer name might be sufﬁxed with a port number to tell TCP
how to ﬁnd the daemon on the server. The default port for HTTP is
80, so www.aros.net is equivalent in a URL to www.aros.net:80.
The server computer name is the only part of a URL you have to sup-
ply with current Web browsers.
Chapter 15 ✦Internet Services, Antivirus, and Anti-Spam 227

✦File or service location — A forward slash separates the server 
computer name from the rest of the URL. Both the forward slash and
anything after it are optional, depending on what’s being addressed.
In an HTTP URL, the ﬁle or service location points to a ﬁle on the
server that is either sent back to you by the server or run as a pro-
gram on the server. In the latter case, the program creates output
dynamically and returns it to you.
File transfer
It’s common to want to retrieve ﬁles onto your computer from another, or to
send ﬁles from your computer to another. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
is the Internet standard protocol to do that, although Windows has its own
internal ﬁle transfer protocols, and Web browsers can use either FTP or HTTP
for the purpose. As with other Internet application protocols, FTP operates
between a client and a server. The FTP client is the program that initiates the
FTP connection; the FTP server is the program that receives the connection.
You can send ﬁles either way across an FTP connection, regardless of which of
the two computers is the client and which is the server.
Because it is speciﬁc to the problem of transferring ﬁles from one computer to
another, the primitive operations in FTP reﬂect the things you need to do:
✦Authenticate access — This being an imperfect world, it’s often nec-
essary to impose restrictions on who is allowed to connect to the
FTP server. FTP implements a username and password authentica-
tion scheme and refuses the connection without a valid login. It’s
common on many FTP servers to allow the username “anonymous”
to log in with any password whatsoever; it’s convention is to use
your e-mail address for the password. Files kept in an anonymous
login area are available to anyone with Internet access — this is the
basis on which much of the software downloaded across the Internet
is accessed.
✦Navigate the remote ﬁle system — In the same way that you need
mechanisms such as the DOS Change Directory (CD) command or the
Windows Explorer to move around as you use your computer, you
need the capability to ﬁnd ﬁles on the remote computer. FTP deﬁnes
commands and responses between client and server that report the
current directory (folder in Windows terms), change to a different
directory, and list the contents of the current directory.
✦Set the ﬁle type — Some operating systems, such as Linux (but not
Windows), distinguish between pure text ﬁles and ﬁles that contain
other information and alter the characters at the end of each line in 
a text ﬁle when sending and receiving. Altering line markers in ﬁles 
is a problem when you send a binary ﬁle (such as a program) because
every time a Linux computer sees an end-of-line character in the
binary ﬁle, it converts it to a pair of characters (carriage return and
line feed). That transformation is okay for text, but it completely 
228 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

corrupts programs, word processor ﬁles, spreadsheets, sound ﬁles,
photographs, and most everything else. FTP lets you control whether
ﬁles are transferred as text or binary, giving the remote system the
information it needs to do its job properly.
✦Send or receive ﬁles — This is, of course, the point of the protocol.
FTP can transmit ﬁles from the client or server and can send one or
many ﬁles at the same time.
Early versions of the FTP client — starting over 30 years ago — on a number of
different computer systems provided a command-line interface. The same FTP
client interface is standard in Linux and still available in Windows — try open-
ing a DOS window on a PC connected to the Internet and typing FTP. (Type
quit to exit FTP.) The command-line interface is much less convenient than
the graphical Windows interface provided by clients such as WS_FTP, but it’s
there. The commands you can enter into the command-line version are very
directly related to the primitive operations in the FTP protocol (such as open 
a connection to a server, enter username and password, change directory, set
the ﬁle type, send or receive ﬁles, and close the connection). The responses
from the server appear directly onscreen, interleaved with your commands.
Electronic mail
The Internet protocol for exchanging electronic mail is the Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP). As far as we know, there’s no Complex Mail Transfer Protocol,
but SMTP is quite complex enough. (It’s an Internet tradition to preﬁx Simple to
the name of protocols, displaying a cavalier disregard for the truth of the result-
ing phrase. One of the most complex Internet protocols is called the Simple
Network Management Protocol.)
SMTP itself allows you to exchange text mail messages with users on computers
connected to the Internet. Addresses you can mail to are typically like max@
acme.com — there’s the username, an at sign, and the name of the user’s mail
server computer.
Because electronic mail can be sent to you at any time, it’s best to have it held
at a computer that’s always on the Net (such as one at your Internet service
provider). After electronic mail for you reaches your mail server computer, it’s
common for you to retrieve it to your own computer using the Post Ofﬁce
Protocol (POP3 — there have been several versions).
SMTP includes primitive operations for the things involved with sending mail:
✦Validate recipient address — The server veriﬁes that the addressee
on the message exists.
✦Deliver to a user’s mailbox — One computer connects to another
and exchanges mail between the two.
✦Read receipt — You can request receipts when the recipient opens
the message you sent.
Chapter 15 ✦Internet Services, Antivirus, and Anti-Spam 229

Some SMTP mail servers support forwarding — you can receive mail on one
system and (transparently to the sender) forward it to a completely different
address on another system. For example, a message sent to max@acme.com
could be relayed by the acme.com mail server to sam@whizbang.ca. Though
the idea is useful, many servers implement forwarding without authenticating
the sender, giving spammers the opening they need. We talk about spam and
what you can do about it later in this chapter.
The worst thing about raw SMTP is that it accepts only text messages, not
binary ﬁles. People commonly want to mail arbitrary ﬁles, however, and send
text that includes fonts, colors, and other formatting. Three approaches to
handling this requirement are common: UUE, MIME, and HTML:
✦User-user encoding (UUE) — It’s possible to recast the binary data
stream you want to send differently. For example, you could take
every 6 bits (creating numbers in the range from 0 to 63) and remap
the resulting numbers onto the printable characters. This expands the
data stream, producing 8 bits from every 6, but it results in a new data
stream that contains nothing but text characters acceptable to SMTP.
This was the original way of sending binary data through SMTP on
the Internet — encode the data, mail the text, and decode at the
other end. Current-generation electronic mail client programs, such
as Windows Messaging, which is included with Windows, support
this transformation automatically.
✦Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) — Internet software
like Web browsers actively know what sort of data is stored in differ-
ent kinds of ﬁles — that EXE ﬁles are executables, ZIP ﬁles are com-
pressed archives, WAV ﬁles are sound clips, and so on. The MIME
coding standard for electronic mail allows the properties of ﬁles to
be sent along with the ﬁles themselves. Technically, MIME uses the
same approach UUE does, expanding a smaller number of bits to a
larger number that transforms strictly to printable characters.
✦Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) — You won’t send binary ﬁles
this way, but many electronic mail clients let you compose messages
as Web pages, and therefore let you format text and include pictures.
Not all Internet mail clients know how to automatically decode messages sent
using UUE, MIME, or HTML text. If you have one of those, the tip-off will be a
bunch of gibberish in the text.
Some Internet mail systems limit the maximum size of a mail message you can
send. We’ve seen limits as low as 1MB; you’ll undoubtedly encounter others.
This isn’t much of a problem for small text messages, but it’s easy to create
messages containing coded binary ﬁles that are that large. The effects you’ll
see if you exceed the maximum size limit are unpredictable — the most benign
thing we’ve seen is for the mail server to send back a message saying it won’t
deliver the mail. We’ve had messages silently disappear without notice, had
the mail server crash at one end or the other, and had our mail client crash.
Just keep in mind the most important rule of the Internet:
The Internet is not perfectly reliable.
230 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

That doesn’t mean the Internet’s not useful, and it doesn’t mean you can’t
depend on it. It means you have to assume that things will go wrong. It means
you have to have planned how you will detect when things fail and what to do
about it. In the case of large messages, for example, you could send a short
text-only message in advance stating the other message is coming, so that if
the recipient doesn’t get the large message, they’re likely to let you know.
Telnet
In the same way that you can connect a terminal program to your modem, you
can connect the equivalent program to the Internet and log in to remote com-
puters (or at least the ones you have an account on). Many Internet service
providers (ISPs) provide remote computer access to Linux or other UNIX
servers on that basis. The client program that lets you connect to a remote
computer is Telnet. If we log in to our Internet service provider, for example,
here’s a typical example of what we get in the Telnet window:
login: xxxxx

Our ISP runs the FreeBSD version of UNIX (see www.freebsd.org), but this
output is typical of what you get logging in to most UNIX computers. Telnet
provides a completely character-oriented terminal — the line at the bottom is
a command prompt to a UNIX command shell, which is analogous to COM-
MAND.COM in Windows 9X or CMD.EXE in Windows 2000 or Windows XP. UNIX
has commands comparable to ones in Windows, some of which are shown in
Table 15-1.
It’s also possible to connect to UNIX computers through a graphical interface
called X Window, using what’s called an XTerm. Telnet doesn’t do that — you
need more complex software. Telnet ships with Windows — simply run telnet
from Start ➪Run — but Windows does not include an XTerm.

Newsgroups
The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is the mechanism underneath a
worldwide Internet bulletin board covering nearly any subject you can think
of — the Usenet newsgroups. For example, if you’re a Quake player, you’ll ﬁnd
no fewer than ﬁve relevant newsgroups:
alt.games.quake
rec.games.computer.quake.announce
rec.games.computer.quake.misc
rec.games.computer.quake.playing
rec.games.computer.quake.servers
If you’re interested in barbequed food, you might look at the following:
alt.food.barbeque
Both moderated and unmoderated newsgroups exist. The protocol arranges to
distribute postings worldwide; in many ways the newsgroups are the broadest,
fastest medium yet devised for spreading information. (Newsgroups spread
viruses in ﬁle attachments, too. You should have your machine protected by
good antivirus software, and never open attachments you’re unsure of.)
You can access the general Internet newsgroups in two ways. If you want to
use a program local to your PC, you’ll need a newsreader client. Microsoft’s
Outlook Express functions as a newsreader and is included with Windows.
UNIX systems include a variety of readers. You’ll also need access to a news
server — see your Internet service provider for that.
232 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

Alternatively, you can search, read, and post to the newsgroups through the
Internet search engines. Using Google, for instance, go to www.google.com/grphp.
You can search many groups directly from that page, or you can use the links on
the bottom of the page to ﬁnd speciﬁc newsgroups. Newsreader clients are typi-
cally faster and more efﬁcient for reading trafﬁc in a speciﬁc newsgroup, so when
you ﬁnd a newsgroup and topic that’s interesting through a search engine, you can
then ﬁre up your newsreader and go look in depth.
Either way, you need to know two characteristics of newsgroups:
✦Content — The same widespread, often-uncensored characteristics
of newsgroups that make them valuable also make them a conduit for
information that might be unacceptable or offensive to some people.
You might want to supervise minors’ access to the newsgroups.
✦Signiﬁcance and accuracy — Don’t expect all the messages in a
newsgroup to be polite, accurate, or even interesting. In most news-
groups, the bulk of the messages (and people) are none of those.
Reading all the trafﬁc in even a small number of active newsgroups
can take hours, and you might not ﬁnd what you’re looking for when
you’re ﬁnished.
Time
One of the annoyances of life is that clocks are usually somewhat wrong. A
consequence of that fact is that the clock in your computer is probably wrong.
Worse, some motherboards are simply incapable of keeping time accurately.
For example, a computer we had for years gained more than a minute a day if
we let it. It wasn’t worth pulling out the motherboard and sending it back to
the manufacturer to repair it, and Internet software such as we describe here
kept the clock on track until we ﬁnally retired the old warhorse.
Very accurate clocks do exist, and some servers on the Internet are slaved to
them. An Internet protocol, the Network Time Protocol (NTP), lets your com-
puter get the current time from one of those servers, as do a number of other
forms of time servers.
Windows XP includes a built-in network time client (see the Internet time tab
in the Date and Time control panel applet), as does Linux (use the rdate
command). If you’re running earlier versions of Windows, a very convenient
program — Socket Watch (see www.locutuscodeware.com/swatch.htm) —
automates the process of keeping your computer clock accurate. You can con-
ﬁgure Socket Watch to start when you boot Windows, and it simply waits for
you to connect to the Internet. When you do, Socket Watch reaches out to the
time server you specify and updates your clock. Simple, and no effort on your
part. You can expect the clock in your computer to remain accurate to within
several seconds or less assuming you connect to the Internet periodically.
Chapter 15 ✦Internet Services, Antivirus, and Anti-Spam 233

Instant messaging
As useful as electronic mail is, it’s not interactive. You can carry on “conver-
sations” in extended time, but it’s not the same as spontaneous conversation.
Nor is the telephone always the answer; it’s expensive to carry on extended
group discussions at multiple sites using long-distance conference calls.
In the same way that Citizen’s Band radio allowed people access to low-cost
party lines, computer chat has grown to provide the same capability. There are
several Internet versions of chat, including both Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and
several proprietary messaging communities.
Internet Relay Chat
Internet Relay Chat works like this. You connect to an IRC server using IRC
client software, such as mIRC (www.mirc.com). When you connect, you choose
one or more channels you want to “talk” in. You can search for channels with
names containing a string you specify, but it’s somewhat hit-or-miss whether
you’ll ﬁnd the one you want. The last time we looked, the IRC server on our
Internet service provider handled over 17,200 channels. Newsgroups covering
your interests are sometimes a way to ﬁnd out about IRC channels, as are sites
such as www.irchelp.org/irchelp/chanlist. Closed, private IRC channels
exist, but IRC is mostly an open, public system with many people on a channel
at once. It’s like a public meeting.
Proprietary messaging
Several companies, including AOL with ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger,
Microsoft with MSN Messenger, and Yahoo! with Yahoo! Messenger, offer more
private instant messaging services, ones that make it convenient to carry on
conversations with people you know. Although trafﬁc goes through servers,
instant messaging appears to you to be between the client on your PC and the
one on the other person’s machine. You can have multiple conversations at
once, each in its own window.
Viruses and Worms and Trojans, 
Oh My!
The Internet, a creation of people, is a perfect mirror for the real world of peo-
ple. A seemingly inﬁnite number of people are online, ranging from altruists
with the best motives (www.toysfortots.org) to child pornographers des-
tined for their own special part of hell.
234 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

Somewhere between the two are those who would corrupt or break into your
computers, attacking your PC for their own amusement or other ends. Their
attacks take several forms:
✦Viruses — Much like their biological namesakes, computer viruses
infect parts of your computer, damage what they will, and spread
through those infections.
✦Worms — Worms are similar to viruses, but operate in a more stand-
alone manner, taking action on their own to spread to other computers.
✦Trojans — Trojans, like their Trojan horse namesake, are attackers
wrapped in something benign. Trojans typically open up a compro-
mised computer to later attack from outside.
✦Cracks — In addition to attacks through programs sent to your com-
puter in the hope you’ll run them, you’ll be subject to direct attack
by people looking for speciﬁc vulnerabilities in your software that let
them take control of your PC.
The rise of the Internet, and the corresponding decline in the exchange of ﬂop-
pies, has made the Internet the most common vector for attacks on your comput-
ers. All these types of attacks will come at you when connected to the Internet.
Viruses
Viruses can infect your computer several ways, the most popular of which are
through infected removable disks (such as ﬂoppies), programs, and documents.
A virus can infect any removable, bootable disk, even if there are no ﬁles on
the disk. The infection lies in what’s called the Master Boot Record (MBR), the
part of the disk used to start your computer well before the operating system
begins running. Reformatting the disk does not necessarily remove the infec-
tion, and merely inserting a ﬂoppy in an infected machine can spread the infec-
tion to the ﬂoppy. Antivirus software helps protect your PC from disks you
insert while the PC is running, but if you leave an infected ﬂoppy in your PC
and accidentally boot it when you turn on the computer, the virus can spread
before your antivirus software even loads.
The best way to protect against booting an infected ﬂoppy disk is to change
your BIOS settings so your PC won’t boot a ﬂoppy in the ﬁrst place. Figure 15-1
shows the boot sequence controls for a typical BIOS. Your BIOS is likely to be
different, so you’ll have to hunt around to ﬁnd the controls (be careful not to
change anything inadvertently). In the BIOS shown, you’d move the high-
lighted Diskette Drive line down to below the Internal HDD line by pressing d
(other BIOS setups will likely be different, so read the screen for instructions).
Alternatively, you could press the spacebar to disable the device from the boot
sequence altogether. This change is completely risk-free because if you ever do
have to boot from a ﬂoppy intentionally, you can just redo the BIOS settings.
Chapter 15 ✦Internet Services, Antivirus, and Anti-Spam 235

The most common path for viruses onto your computer, however, is the
Internet. Virtually any ﬁle someone sends you — attached to electronic mail, 
in a chat room, or as a Web site download — could be infected. If you never
download ﬁles and never open attachments to electronic mail, you’re relatively
safe, but that approach gives up some of the most useful functions of the
Internet. Instead, we recommend you understand and follow these guidelines:
✦Don’t open unexpected electronic mail ﬁle attachments — A very
popular approach for spreading viruses is to exploit the combination
of Windows’ support for long ﬁle names with embedded blanks and
some applications’ limitations on how long displayed ﬁle names can
be. For example, a program limiting ﬁle name display might show a
ﬁle name as cute puppy.jpg while the real ﬁle name is cute
puppy.jpg.exe. That latter ﬁle name is an executable program, so
instead of bringing up a photo like Figure 15-2, you’ll run a program
that infects your computer with whatever malicious garbage the
virus writer chose, something like deleting all your ﬁles or worse.
✦Run antivirus software — The section “Antivirus and anti-adware
software,” later in this chapter, discusses software you can use to
help recognize viruses trying to infect your computer and block
them. Use that software, and keep it up-to-date.
✦Block macro viruses in Microsoft Ofﬁce and other applications —
Viruses need not be executable programs; indeed, over half the dif-
ferent viruses cataloged by antivirus software developers reside in
application data ﬁles, exploiting the programming languages built
into the applications. Figure 15-3 shows the dialog box to use in
Microsoft Word, with the security level set to reject any macros not
from sources you know and trust. Be careful whom you trust, too,
because both friends and experts make mistakes.

what you’ll see.

Figure 15-3: Set application macro 
security to reject unknown macro sources.
Although Microsoft Ofﬁce is the most common target for macro
viruses, check every program you use for macro settings and restrict
what macros can do without permission if you can.
Chapter 15 ✦Internet Services, Antivirus, and Anti-Spam 237

Worms
Worms differ from viruses and Trojans in how they propagate. Although all three
favor the Internet for attacks, viruses propagate on contact, worms actively seek
to burrow into PCs, and Trojans seek to mimic something innocuous. Perhaps the
most common worm attack is to seek out vulnerabilities in applications and the
operating system, holes in the software that let the worm execute on the victim
machine. We recommend the following to defend against worms:
✦Actively check for and apply security patches — Every operating
system has ﬂaws an attacker can use. Whether you run Microsoft
Windows, Linux, or some other operating system, check the operat-
ing system manufacturer’s Web site periodically for security patches
applicable to your system. Microsoft implements a patch service at
windowsupdate.microsoft.com. You’ll usually want all the critical
updates and security updates they post; taking the recommended
updates and driver updates is entirely optional. Windows 2000 and
Windows XP offer an automatic update service that will notify you
when there are updates available. Figure 15-4 shows the dialog box
you use in Windows XP, which is part of the System control panel
applet. Windows 2000 has a separate Automatic Updates control
panel applet that looks much the same.
Figure 15-4: Automatic Windows updates 
notify you when updates are available.
We’re generally conservative about loading software onto our com-
puters, be it from Microsoft or anyone else, but the Windows security
updates and critical updates are deﬁnitely ones to keep on top of.
Both Microsoft and the maintainers of the FreeBSD operating system
maintain mailing lists to distribute security notices. Signing up for the
238 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

security mailing list for operating systems you use could give you a
few days head start on patching critical vulnerabilities before the more
mainstream patch sites have the update, and before the attacks begin.
✦Run hardware and software ﬁrewalls — There’s no good reason for a
computer on the Internet to contact your computer without permission,
so you should run a ﬁrewall to block inbound connection attempts. We
prefer hardware ﬁrewalls for that job. The best protection against worms
and Trojans also limits the programs that can connect to the Internet
outbound from your PC; we prefer ZoneAlarm for that protection. Both
hardware and software ﬁrewalls are covered in Chapter 13. If you have
one, don’t forget to secure your wireless LAN, too.
✦Check if your system is vulnerable — It’s not enough to install patches
and ﬁrewalls — you have to test them to know if you’ve done the setup
properly. The Gibson Research Corporation Web site (www.grc.com)
includes a test for open ports leading to incoming vulnerabilities (see
the ShieldsUP! tool) and for outgoing connections (see LeakTest), but
there’s no comprehensive test for all the patches you’ll install.
✦Set up Windows Explorer to always show ﬁle extensions — By
default, Windows Explorer eliminates the ﬁle extension for known ﬁle
types from its display, so the example we used above of cute puppy.
jpg.exe would display in Windows Explorer as cute puppy.jpg. If
you turn off the setting to hide ﬁle extensions, as in Figure 15-5, you’ll
always see the real story (unless your columns are too narrow, in
which case you’ll still see an ellipsis).
Figure 15-5: Clear the highlighted 
Windows Explorer setting to force ﬁle 
extension display.
Chapter 15 ✦Internet Services, Antivirus, and Anti-Spam 239

Once you’ve done that, be careful starting ﬁles with the extensions
COM, EXE, BAT, SCR, VBS, PIF, or CMD. They’re all executable under
some version of Windows. Don’t believe a program is safe just
because you recognize its icon.
Trojans
Trojans are programs that masquerade as other benign or desirable software,
but have unadvertised effects. One non-destructive example is the bundling of
the Gator advertising software in a variety of ﬁle-sharing applications. Those
programs typically state that you’re agreeing to the advertising Trojan in their
license agreement, so it’s conceivable what they do is legal. Far more insidious
are the Trojans that let people remotely spy on and control your PC. Three of
the most common are called Back Oriﬁce, SubSeven, and NetBus; let them on
your PC, and the remote attacker might as well be sitting at your shoulder
watching the screen, typing on the keyboard, and moving the mouse. Trojans
can arrive in electronic mail or be distributed in newsgroups and other ﬁle
download sources. Here’s how to reduce your vulnerability:
✦Run hardware and software ﬁrewalls — This is the same approach
we’ve suggested before, and by the time you’ve ﬁnished reading this
book, you’ll see it many more times. Even if you don’t have a spare,
unused PC (which could make the total cost zero), you can set up
solid hardware and software ﬁrewall protection for between $20 and
$100, completely blocking inbound attacks from the Internet with a
low probability of penetration from the outside.
✦Use security options in your Web browser — Web browsers offer set-
tings to control what Web sites are allowed to do, settings you can use
to restrict downloads and other behavior. Internet Explorer catego-
rizes Web sites into one of four zones, with the restricted zone being a
list of sites for which you want to enforce tighter security. It’s effective
to populate the restricted zone yourself, but unreliable in a security
sense because it’s difﬁcult to identify all the sites you want restricted
before you encounter them. You can preload the list from IE-SPYAD,
available at www.staff.uiuc.edu/~ehowes/resource.htm. Be sure
to read the readme ﬁle that comes with IE-SPYAD to ﬁnd out how you
can edit the list to remove sites you don’t want to restrict and enable
restrictions on sites that aren’t activated by default.
✦Lock down application security — Make sure your applications are
themselves as secure as possible. For example, patches for Outlook
on the Microsoft Web site block executable attachments in electronic
mail, and settings you can make in Outlook cause HTML formatted
messages to open as if they’re in Internet Explorer’s restricted zone
(see the Security Zones part of Figure 15-6).
✦Run antivirus and anti-adware software — Even though a hardware
ﬁrewall blocks most incoming attacks, and a good software ﬁrewall
detects and blocks outgoing connection attempts should a Trojan
ﬁnd its way onto your PC, you still want to try to block the Trojan
before it can activate. The antivirus and anti-adware software dis-
cussed later in this chapter help provide that protection.
240 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

to force HTML electronic mail into the 
restricted zone.
Cracks
Although many Internet attacks on your computers will be by virus, worm, and
Trojan programs based on others’ work and launched by people with little or
no skill of their own, some people have skills sufﬁcient to directly attack your
computer — an activity generally called cracking — using specialized tools to
analyze and penetrate your network. Attacks of this sort start by gathering
information, from your Web site if you have one, from newsgroup postings
you’ve made (remember, the newsgroups are searchable using Google and
other search engines), and by scanning your network using ping and related
tools that scan for open ports much like the tests at Gibson Research. We’re
not recommending you become an Internet hermit, sharing no information or
postings on the Net, but there are speciﬁc steps you can take to reduce your
vulnerability.
✦Consider what you publish — Before you’re done, look a second
time at electronic mail you send, Web pages you publish, and news-
group messages you post, reviewing them for what information
you’re revealing to a potential attacker. Think about both attacks on
your computers and the potential for identity theft when you review.
Posting that you’re running Windows 98 Second Edition on your PC is
bad enough because it helps a cracker know what attacks to direct at
your PC; posting the make and model of your hardware ﬁrewall is just
stupid — consider, for example, that a Google search for NETGEAR
vulnerability returns over 20,000 hits, while a search for Linksys vul-
nerability returns over 12,000. Firewalls don’t advertise their make
and model number to the Internet, so by giving out that information
you just make the cracker’s job easier.
Chapter 15 ✦Internet Services, Antivirus, and Anti-Spam 241

✦Use a hardware ﬁrewall and close all open ports — Not only
should you use a hardware ﬁrewall to protect your network from the
Internet, you want to make sure you conﬁgure it to block all incoming
ports so crackers can’t reach the computers on your network. Don’t
forget to make sure the ﬁrewall’s management tools are accessible
only from your LAN, denying the cracker the ability to reprogram its
conﬁguration. Do not rely on passwords for that purpose because
there are some very sophisticated password guessing and attack pro-
grams available.
✦Don’t run unnecessary services on your PC — Layered defenses
help protect you if your outer defenses — your ﬁrewalls — are
breached. Your inner defense layer is how you conﬁgure your PCs
themselves. Don’t run programs you don’t need, such as Web, FTP, or
Telnet servers, because they increase the number of points available
for attack.
✦Apply operating system and application security patches
regularly — As we described in the section on worms, get in the
habit of checking for and applying security patches for your software
regularly. Security patches ﬁx vulnerabilities in your software, reduc-
ing the footprint a cracker has to attack.
✦Back up your data and software — In the end, protecting your comput-
ers from attack is an arms race, not a sure thing. If you have backups of
all your data and programs, backups that you remove from the comput-
ers when they’re complete, then no attack can destroy everything.
Antivirus and anti-adware software
We think that nearly every computer should be connected to the Internet, but
we also think that every PC connected to the Internet should be protected by
up-to-date antivirus and anti-adware software. Firewalls help protect you from
attacks others initiate; antivirus and anti-adware software help protect you
from attacks piggybacking on electronic mail, in Web sites, and on disks you
bring in.
At a minimum, antivirus software scans ﬁles you read from disk, scanning 
program ﬁles every time a program launches, and (perhaps) data ﬁles every
time a program accesses them. Some antivirus software scans your e-mail as 
it arrives, too. We used to recommend a speciﬁc antivirus product, but after
severe, unresolved problems with that manufacturer and several others, we no
longer think any of them are particularly better than the rest. You can choose
software from Frisk Software International, F-Secure, Kaspersky Labs, McAfee,
Symantec, Trend Micro, and others; Freebyte maintains a list of free antivirus
software (see www.freebyte.com/antivirus).
Antivirus software works by scanning ﬁles, looking for patterns characteristic
of known viruses. Antivirus data ﬁles deﬁne the patterns of the software, so
you have to update the data ﬁles regularly to make sure you have the latest
242 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

patterns. (There’s a technique called heuristic scanning that looks for likely
virus indicators, but as delivered in current products it’s prone to both false
positives and to missing actual viruses.) You can conﬁgure most antivirus
products to update themselves regularly; we have ours set to update weekly.
Even if you do everything right, you’ll ﬁnd the virus writers still conspire to
cause you grief, and you shouldn’t be upset when that happens. For example,
Figure 15-7 is typical of a lot of electronic mail we received while the Sobig.F
virus was circulating on the Internet during the summer of 2003. The message
is from a site in Denmark, reporting to us that we’ve apparently sent them a
message infected with that virus.
Figure 15-7: You’ll be affected by viruses even when you do 
everything right.
Unfortunately, we never sent a message to eterra.dk, much less one infected
with Sobig.F. The virus scanner there detected the virus, which is good for the
protected site, and then sent us a completely useless electronic mail message.
Analyses of the virus on the Internet (for example, www.f-secure.com/
v-descs/sobig_f.shtml) report that the virus forges the sender’s address
using addresses found on the infected PC. It’s worse than merely ironic that
the virus scanner that sent us this e-mail is too stupid to know the virus forged
the sender’s address because the volume of electronic mail clogging the
Internet from this one virus was made worse by these useless messages.
The importance of installing and updating antivirus software notwithstanding,
a lot of virus hoaxes exist, too. You can ﬁnd catalogs of them on the Internet
(see www.datafellows.fi/news/hoax.htm and www.vmyths.com). In gen-
eral, keep in mind that any electronic mail that urges you to forward it to all
your friends is itself a hoax.
Chapter 15 ✦Internet Services, Antivirus, and Anti-Spam 243

For political reasons more than technical ones, antivirus software typically
doesn’t have the ability to scan for and reject adware, which includes ﬁles called
cookies that can help track your Web usage, software that displays advertising,
or programs that report information from your computer back to a server.
There’s a market for tools to help defeat those threats, however, leading to
both anti-adware programs and Web sites offering information and advice. We
recommend a combination of several approaches:
✦Run Ad-aware — Lavasoft (www.lavasoft.de) makes available its
Ad-aware tool in both free and paid versions. The free version scans
your PC on command; the paid version adds a component that stays
resident while your PC runs, blocking adware in real time.
✦Block suspect sites — Much of the adware on the Internet comes
from Web sites, either through opening windows hidden on your
desktop, you clicking yes on warnings about downloaded software,
or other means. The rest comes bundled in with software you inten-
tionally install. You can suppress much of the malign operations of
known adware sites by installing IE-SPYAD (www.staff.uiuc.edu/
~ehowes/resource.htm). Other forms of adware come in as add-ons
speciﬁcally programmed for Microsoft Internet Explorer; you can
block many of them with SpywareBlaster (www.javacoolsoftware.
com/spywareblaster.html).
Even if you don’t want to load the wholesale site restrictions these
tools provide, you can still build your own list in the Internet
Explorer restricted zone. Any time a site tries to install software —
watch for warning pop-ups, and read them all carefully — you can
add it to the list. We generally exclude all addresses at the site, so,
for example, after Gator tried to install its code on our PCs, we added
*.gator.com to our restricted sites list.
✦Read the newsgroups and reviews before installing software —
Search the newsgroups and any reviews on download sites (for exam-
ple, www.download.com) for information about adware bundled in
with programs. For example, if you went to the description page for
WeatherCast (download.com.com/3000-2054-10179240.html),
you’d ﬁnd out it comes bundled with a load of adware from WhenU.
Had you found the program by searching the site for weather forecast
and then merely clicked the Download link based on its relatively
large number of downloads, you’d have missed the warning.
✦Be careful where you click — Web sites have the unfortunate habit
of popping up intentionally confusing windows on your screen, and
it’s sometimes difﬁcult to know how to close them without activating
them. For example, despite having taught her what to look for, our 
12 year old was caught by a deceptive window and accidentally
installed some adware called Memory Blaster. Read what you see
onscreen carefully, and don’t click on windows blindly. We also rec-
ommend installing the Google toolbar (toolbar.google.com) and
activating its pop-up window blocker.
Ad-aware is good at removing adware. If you do end up infected with a worm
or virus, however, strong measures may be required. We’ll discuss what to do
in Chapter 24.

Dealing with Spam
Spam, or more formally unsolicited commercial e-mail, is electronic mail dumped
in your inbox you didn’t ask for and that, generally, comes from a source you
don’t know. Spam is the electronic equivalent of the junk mail that ﬁlls your
post box, only it costs the sender far less, clogs the Internet and your inbox,
and is quite often something you’d really rather not see. A sampling of the spam
we’ve received in one of our inboxes includes offers for automobile warranties,
debt reduction, adult videos involving barnyard animals, mortgage reﬁnancing,
get rich quick schemes, photos of singles we can date, adult videos without
the barnyard animals but with cheerleaders, male and female organ enlarge-
ment, health insurance, pheromones guaranteed to attract others, mail-order
Russian brides, low-cost travel, eBay training, Viagra, free money, more adult
photos and videos, improved Web site trafﬁc, billions of addresses to send
spam to, the fountain of youth, secret information on anyone, millions of dol-
lars to be exported from Nigeria, anti-spam tools, antivirus tools, university
diplomas, and worse.
Just so there’s no misunderstanding, it’s all a fraud. Only idiots conduct major
financial transactions with someone offering no mutual references and who can’t
spell well enough to graduate from sixth grade. We’re married and not really
good candidates for dating singles. eBay is too simple to need training to use,
we’re partial to the organs we have and want to keep them, and people falling
for the Nigerian spam (see www.snopes.com/inboxer/scams/nigeria.htm
and www.secretservice.gov/alert419.shtml) demonstrate the triumph of
human greed in the face of all common sense. Spammers selling anti-spam tools
have even more chutzpah than we can believe.
As of August 2003, 50 to 60 percent of the electronic mail on the Internet was
spam (depending on whose statistics you read). One of the best-known organi-
zations ﬁghting spam is The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email
(CAUCE). On their Web site (www.cauce.org) you’ll ﬁnd information about
spam, about legislation targeting spammers, and more.
Spam has proven almost impossible to stop despite many determined efforts,
both because it’s an escalating arms race between the spammers and the anti-
spammers and because of an unfortunate legacy from the early non-commercial
days of the Internet. When the Internet began, its users were typically either
government or companies and universities doing research for the government.
A culture of openness and sharing grew in that environment, including sharing
of resources to relay trafﬁc among the many computers at the time not directly
connected to the Internet. Prime among those relay functions was the sendmail
program, which for years was distributed with settings that by default allowed
anyone at all to relay electronic mail through a sendmail server. After a pair 
of lawyers invented spam (overlawyered.com/archives/02/mar3.html),
though, all those open relay servers were just what the spammers needed, and
far too many of them are still in operation all over the world.
An open relay server is spam heaven because of how electronic mail works. 
A spammer sends a message to an open relay, attaching a long list of blind 
Chapter 15 ✦Internet Services, Antivirus, and Anti-Spam 245

carbon copy (BCC) addresses. The transmission to the relay is one message,
requiring almost no network bandwidth. The relay then dutifully sends copies
of the message to every addressee, using up processing and network band-
width on the relay server. Those servers are often on high capacity network
connections, so the load may not even be noticed by lazy systems administra-
tors. Spammers harvest electronic mail addresses off Web pages and news-
groups, buy and sell lists of addresses, and launch their trafﬁc off any servers
they can exploit.
The open relays are slowly closing in response to anti-spam ﬁghters, and spam
filters are constantly improving, so spammers are constantly upping their game.
Some of the current spammer tricks include:
✦Infect PCs to use as spam relays — Suspicion is building that some
of the more recent Internet viruses, worms, and Trojans are not
designed to damage the target computers, but instead to exploit
their Internet connections by serving as spam relays. As the number
of open relays goes down, building armies of infected relays is a way
to build back the bandwidth needed to shovel out all the messages.
✦Disguise plain text with alternate encoding — Spam ﬁlters, including
ones you can set up in your electronic mail reader, commonly look
for key words in the message content to identify spam. (Chances are
good, for example, that any electronic mail the average person gets
mentioning Viagra is spam.) Many electronic mail readers support an
alternative text encoding using 6 bits per character instead of 8 that
makes the text impossible to read directly, and defeats the rules in
many readers.
✦Break up HTML text with comments to obfuscate the content, and
don’t include plain text along with the HTML — Spam is rapidly
moving to all-HTML messages. HTML encoding lets spammers break
up key words (Viagra) with comments (Via<!---comment--->gra) to
defeat keyword scanners, and lets them send the message only in
obfuscated form with no plain text equivalent. Misspellings are com-
mon too against keyword scanners (V1agra).
✦Eliminate all plain text in favor of graphics in HTML messages —
As anti-spam scanners became smarter about extracting obfuscated
text from messages, spammers retaliated by eliminating the text alto-
gether, replacing the text with images of text downloaded through
HTML links.
✦Include text stating you’ve signed up for the spam e-mail — Their
messages are frauds anyhow, so you shouldn’t be surprised that
spammers have precisely no compunctions about lying. One of the
most common lies is text such as “You are receiving this e-mail
because you have either signed up to receive messages from us or a
third party. If you would like not to receive further e-mails from us,
please follow the instructions at the bottom of this mailing.” There
are two lies there, one that you signed up, and the other that you
won’t receive further e-mails. You’ll get a lot more because by follow-
ing those instructions, you’re conﬁrming you have a live electronic
mail address and that you read spam.
246 Part V ✦Networks and Communications

Bad as it seems, not all is lost. Over time, you can radically reduce the volume
of spam you receive using these techniques:
✦Use spam blocking tools — If you can, ﬁlter your electronic mail 
for spam before it even reaches your mail reader. Our ISP offers
SpamAssassin (www.spamassassin.org), a wonderful anti-spam
tool. Not only does SpamAssassin use sophisticated spam detection
approaches that are constantly updated, but also it can wrap identi-
ﬁed spam in another message explaining why SpamAssassin classed
the message as spam. If you still want to open the message, it’s there,
but if you want to scrap it unread (and therefore bypass the tracking
links spammers put in many HTML messages), you can.
SpamAssassin also ﬂags the subject line with ***** Spam *****, so
you can also build rules in your mail reader to automatically divert
incoming spam to a folder for later disposal.
If your ISP won’t offer spam ﬁltering, consider getting another ISP. 
If that’s not practical, consider third-party ﬁltering services such as
those offered by SpamCop (mail.spamcop.net/individuals.php).
You can keep using your existing e-mail address if you want with
SpamCop’s service, which costs $30 per year. Other anti-spam tools
are listed at Tucows (www.tucows.com/spam95_default.html).
✦Don’t put your personal electronic mail address anywhere on the
Web, newsgroups, or chat rooms — Spammers run programs to
scrape electronic mail addresses off the Internet, searching Web
pages, newsgroups, chat rooms, and anywhere else addresses might
be recorded. Don’t give out your private address freely that way.
✦Use disposable e-mail addresses for ﬁlling out forms — There are
times when you have little choice but to give out an electronic mail
address to do business over the Internet. For situations like that, you
can create “disposable” addresses that forward to your real address
with limits you set. Spam Gourmet (www.spamgourmet.com) is a good
disposable address service, and is free. You can create any number
of addresses, and can limit how many messages can be sent through
the address before it starts rejecting everything.
Another way to create disposable addresses is to sign up for an
account at Hotmail, Yahoo!, or other free electronic mail hosting serv-
ices. Be sure you don’t let yourself be listed in their member proﬁles,
which the spammers scrape regularly. If you prefer using services
other than those two, there’s a free e-mail address directory you can
use to ﬁnd alternatives (emailaddresses.com/free_email.htm).
✦Never use “Remove Me” or “Unsubscribe” links or reply to
spam — Doing so just conﬁrms yours is a live address and will
attract even more spam.
✦Use rules in your electronic mail reader and don’t preview
spam — Most electronic mail readers offer rules to handle incoming
mail. A very simple rule is one that moves all mail where you’re not
in the To or CC ﬁelds into a spam folder. Most people don’t use BCC,
so the chances are any incoming mail where you’re not explicitly
named is spam.

his chapter looks at what sound is and how com-
puters create and reproduce sounds. Overall, your
PC represents sounds as a sequence of numbers that
represent the amplitude of the sound wave at points in
time. The numbers are sampled at regular, precise inter-
vals, and by playing them back at the same rate, your
computer can reconstruct the waveform. Figure 16-1
shows a sound waveform; if the sampling is done fast
enough and well enough, you can’t tell if the waveform
is the original or a reconstruction from its digital 
representation. 
What Is Sound?
Sound is vibration — alternating greater and lesser air
pressure — traveling through the air that is received at
your ears and heard by your brain. Many people can
hear sounds as low as 16 to 20 Hz (although you can
feel lower frequency sounds than that if they’re strong
enough). Some people can hear sounds as high in fre-
quency as 20 KHz.
How you perceive sound depends critically on the
shape of the waveform. Figure 16-2 illustrates both some
simple waveform shapes and (to the left of the basic
waveform images) decomposition of those waveform
shapes into frequency components. The top left wave-
form in Figure 16-2 is a sine wave, a smoothly varying
signal of a single frequency. The frequency analysis at
the top right veriﬁes this — there’s one frequency peak

in the graph. A sound system that reproduces that one frequency can accu-
rately reproduce the sine wave. The lower left waveform in Figure 16-2 is called
a triangle or sawtooth wave. The lowest, or fundamental, frequency of the saw-
tooth wave in the ﬁgure is the same as that of the sine wave, but the frequency
analysis at the bottom right of the ﬁgure shows many frequencies have to be
added together to reproduce the speciﬁc shape of the sawtooth wave. If a
sound system rolls off the high frequencies, the wave shape distorts. If the
sound system cuts off all the frequencies above the fundamental frequency,
the waveform becomes a sine wave like the one in the top left box of Figure
16-2, and on playback sounds quite different than the original sound.

The need for high frequency sound components to form complex signals is why
sound systems sound better when they support extended frequency responses.
The added frequencies enable sound systems to better reconstruct the complex
waveforms that make up the sounds you listen to.
The shape of the amplitude of a note is most of what distinguishes the sound
one instrument makes from another. (Timbre, which is the tone quality, is the
other key characteristic that distinguishes instruments.) Figure 16-3 shows the
leading part of a note, called its attack, followed by the decay, the sustain, and
the release. An acoustic guitar, for example, has a sharp attack, quick decay,
and medium length sustain. A ﬂute or clarinet has a slow attack, slow decay,
and long sustain.
Figure 16-3: Attack, decay, sustain, and release differentiate one instrument 
sound from another.
Old, slow PCs lacked the computational power, hardware, and software to digi-
tally sample and replay sounds, so they created musical instrument sounds by
manipulating attack, decay, sustain, and release with what was called a fre-
quency modulation (FM) synthesizer. Figure 16-4 shows how this works. One
or more waveform generators, providing the raw pitch and timbre, couple into
envelope shapers that provide the attack/decay/sustain/release amplitude pro-
ﬁle. All the separate signals then get combined in the summer, forming a single
instrument. That single instrument is called a voice. If you need to play multiple
instruments at one time (multiple voices), you need more than one of the com-
plete channels in Figure 16-4. Each distinct instrument in an FM synthesizer
uses a collection of generators, shapers, and a summer to create the output
voice. FM synthesizers typically have 4 to 32 voices.

Figure 16-4: FM synthesis uses relatively simple hardware to create passable music
effects.
Analog Audio
Faster, more capable PC hardware, beginning with the Creative Labs
SoundBlaster cards, works directly with sampled digital sound. Figure 16-5
shows how sound generation is implemented in most computers. Software run-
ning on a processor receives a request to make a sound, retrieves the neces-
sary data, and sends commands to the sound card. A small processor on the
sound card receives the command and data, and coordinates the operation of
specialized chips (including digital-to-analog converters similar to those in
your video card) to create sound waveforms. Those waveforms then pass
through ﬁlters (to eliminate noise and other effects) and ampliﬁers (to boost
the signal strength) and then show up at the output jacks on the card. You
connect those jacks to your computer speakers or stereo system, which adds
more ampliﬁcation, lets you control the bass and treble, and hands off to your
speakers. The speakers translate the electrical signal into a corresponding
sound pressure wave, which is what you hear.
Figure 16-5: Generating sound in your computer combines digital and analog
components.
Some sound systems alter this scheme to use the Universal Serial Bus (USB),
sending the digital version of the sound to the speakers and therefore moving
all the sound card functions out to the speakers. Those systems don’t need
separate sound playback hardware in the PC itself.

The analog components in a sound card, external ampliﬁer, and speaker
operate much the same way as a traditional stereo sound system. Because of
this similarity, the speciﬁcations for computer sound system analog compo-
nents are similar to those for stereos. Here are some of the more important
characteristics:
✦Output power — This is a measure of how strongly the ampliﬁer can
drive an output device, such as a speaker. Power is measured into a
load, which in the case of a speaker is typically rated at 4 ohms (the
measure of resistance). Just as with stereo equipment, the output
power has more to do with how things sound than how loud you can
crank it up. Signals with sharp attacks (drums, gunshots, explosions)
need a lot of power to move the speaker quickly even at moderate
volume, so larger output power speciﬁcations are better.
✦Frequency response — This is the measure of the range of frequen-
cies the components are capable of handling. Not all the sounds
you’ll put through the card actually use the full range, though, and
no amount of quality in the sound system can compensate for bad
sound recordings missing the high or low frequencies in the ﬁrst
place. A broader range of frequencies is better.
✦Total harmonic distortion — Frequencies that are multiples of a
base frequency are called harmonics. The sounds you hear are full of
harmonics because, as shown in Figure 16-2, harmonics are part of
the higher frequency components that give each signal its distinctive
shape. Ampliﬁers create harmonics that aren’t part of the original
signal through an effect called harmonic distortion. The transistor
ampliﬁers you ﬁnd in modern stereos and in sound cards produce
odd harmonics, which can be objectionable to listen to. The sum of
all the harmonic distortion your ampliﬁer produces is called its total
harmonic distortion, or THD. Smaller THD numbers are better.
Keep in mind that when you’re talking about computer sound cards, you’re not
talking about connoisseur-grade stereo. You’re talking about a card you’ll use
for presentations, accents in the user interface (the beeps, blurps, and other
noises Windows makes when it wants your attention), background music, and
games. You won’t get the same quality as in an exquisite stereo, and you prob-
ably don’t need that level of quality unless you’re a professional musician cre-
ating music with your computer.
Waveform Audio
So far in this chapter, you’ve seen two ways to create sound from your 
computer — playing back a sampled audio waveform and synthesizing wave-
forms from a sequence of timbre/attack/decay/sustain/release commands. These
two ways are both used in your computer. Sampled waveforms are in wave ﬁles
(which have the extension .WAV), while command sequences comprise MIDI
ﬁles (which have the extension .MID). This section covers waveform audio; the
Chapter 16 ✦Sound Cards, Speakers, Microphones, and MP3 Players 255

later section, “Musical Instrument Digital Interface,” covers MIDI. Waveform
audio, including its compressed version, such as MPEG Layer 3 (MP3), is over-
whelmingly the most common form.
Most sounds begin as live audio sounds in the real world. The fundamental
process for creating digital waveform audio from those sounds is shown in
Figure 16-6, in which the audio source gets conditioned, ﬁltered, and sampled by
an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. A sampling clock strictly times the action of
the converter so that measurements are taken at ﬁxed intervals. The sampling
clock has to run at twice the frequency of the highest frequency component of
the input signal to be able to reconstruct the signal faithfully, so to sample music
with a maximum frequency response of 22 KHz, the clock has to run at 44 KHz.
Figure 16-6: Digital audio sampling measures the amplitude of the input signal 
at ﬁxed intervals.
Many people believe that because the frequencies you can hear are limited,
sampling rates as high as 44.1 KHz, which are required to sample the 22 KHz
frequencies at the upper limit of CD reproduction, are excessive. It’s true that
telephones reproduce signals no higher than 4 KHz. The lowest A on a piano 
is 27.5 Hz, while the highest A is 3.25 KHz. A sound system limited to 4 KHz (a
telephone, for instance) sounds nowhere near as good as one that can extend
up to 20 KHz, though, because of the harmonics needed to reproduce the sound
of instruments accurately, to reproduce the speciﬁc wave shapes instruments
generate instead of a smooth sine wave. The added frequency range in better
sound systems reproduces higher frequencies precisely so that the system
faithfully delivers the recorded signal.
Each element in Figure 16-6 has a speciﬁc function:
✦The input pre-amp conditions the signal to the amplitude the A/D
converter wants to see, isolating it from the characteristics of the
audio source.
✦The low-pass ﬁlter removes frequencies over one half of the sam-
pling clock rate, ensuring that the digital samples will be ones that
accurately reconstruct the input signal.

✦The A/D converter measures the amplitude of the input audio signal
each time it is clocked. Each measurement produces a number corre-
sponding to the measurement. Stereo cards have two input pre-amps,
two low-pass ﬁlters, and two A/D converters.
✦The sampling clock triggers the A/D converter at regular intervals.
The faster the clock runs, the faster the A/D converter samples and
the higher the maximum frequency you can digitize.
Every time the A/D converter samples the waveform, it outputs the sampled
data to your processor, which typically writes it to a ﬁle. If you’re recording
stereo, there are two converters, each outputting at that rate. The high sample
rates are why wave sound ﬁles can get so large — Table 16-1 shows how
extreme the volume of data can get. Recording raw, uncompressed stereo
sound at 44 KHz (equivalent to what’s on an audio CD) takes over a gigabyte
for an hour’s worth of material.

A 74-minute CD holds around 660MB. CDs that extend the recordable surface
radius can extend that to 700MB and 80 minutes. Compression can be used in
waveform audio ﬁles, so the sizes predicted by Table 16-1 are upper bounds
for audio recorded as MP3 ﬁles and accurate for ﬁles recorded as audio
playable in a CD player.
Waveform audio hardware
Your PC implements wave audio input and output hardware on a card that ﬁts in
your computer, in chips on the motherboard itself, or in external hardware con-
nected to a USB port. No matter where the hardware lies, Figure 16-7 shows the
wave audio components involved. There are two parallel channels everywhere
for stereo, although they share a common sampling clock and bus interface. The
low pass ﬁlter on the output side, before the ampliﬁer, removes frequencies higher
than one half the sample rate (similar to those on the input side), ensuring that
you get a clean signal out of the digital-to-analog converters.
Chapter 16 ✦Sound Cards, Speakers, Microphones, and MP3 Players 257

Figure 16-7: Waveform audio components
The input and output sections of the sound hardware are independent of each
other, letting you run them at the same time in what’s called full-duplex operation.
Full-duplex is important for videoconferencing, voice-enabled gaming, and Internet
telephony applications because it lets you both speak and be spoken to at the same
time. Much of the fun in multi-player games is the conversation among players —
multi-player games don’t work anywhere near as well in private.
The hardware’s technical characteristics deﬁne the performance of the wave
audio section of your sound hardware:
✦Sampling rate — This is the clock rate at which the converters can
operate. A good typical sound card can sample at rates in the range
of 5 KHz to 44.1 KHz.
✦Bus interface — If not built into the motherboard or connected exter-
nally to the computer, your sound hardware will be built onto a PCI
bus sound card. Sound cards once had to be compatible with the
SoundBlaster hardware interface, including I/O addresses, interrupt
level, and direct memory access channels, but those requirements
have become unimportant as sound-enabled DOS programs and games
vanished in favor of newer ones using the Windows sound interfaces.
Sound cards typically provide bass and treble controls, mixers, input selects,
and volume controls. Software in Windows allows you to set these controls
onscreen.
The Turtle Beach Santa Cruz sound card (see Figure 16-8) is representative of a
PCI board you’d add to a PC to improve on the sound hardware built into the
motherboard. The Santa Cruz hardware supports six-speaker surround sound;
digital sound outputs; EAX, A3D, and DirectSound positional audio (and others);
and full-duplex operation.

The hardware acceleration on the card is particularly interesting in that it can
adapt its processing power for the tasks being performed, be they MP3 decod-
ing, 3D audio for games, or MIDI.
Audio compression
Because raw, uncompressed sampled digital audio takes so much space to
record, compressing the data for storage on disk is important for storing large
volumes of audio, such as you’d want to do if you’d rather play back music
from a large library on your PC than have to change CDs to ﬁnd the songs you
want. Compression also enables sharing recordings you’ve made with others
across the Internet, since it’s not terribly practical to send tens of megabytes
per recording down a telephone line.
Lossless compression — techniques that can reproduce the digitized data stream
from its compressed version without changing so much as a single bit — can’t
squeeze the information enough to be useful. Practical approaches use lossy
compression, meaning there’s some loss of quality in the reconstructed wave-
form when compared to the original digital source.
Many lossy audio compression technologies exist. Each uses different
approaches to making audio ﬁles smaller, but you can think of them all in
terms of how good they sound for a given degree of compression. Any speciﬁc
compressed data rate, 128 kilobits per second, for example, establishes a
compression ratio (about 11:1 for the 128 Kbps example) relative to the raw
CD audio rate of 1,411.20 kilobits per second. For the chosen rate, different
technologies offer better or worse sound quality; for a given sound quality,
Chapter 16 ✦Sound Cards, Speakers, Microphones, and MP3 Players 259

different technologies require a higher or lower data rate and, therefore, offer
better or worse compression.
The most popular audio compression technologies include:
✦Moving Picture Experts Group Layer 3 (MP3) — MP3 and the newer
MP3PRO format are without question the most common, most popu-
lar PC audio compression format because many free players and
compressors are available, because the format is not proprietary to
any one company, and because it does not impose digital rights man-
agement restrictions. MP3 players include not only software for your
PC, but also DVD equipment for your home stereo and portable
devices you can carry around with you. The MP3PRO format isn’t as
well known or supported, but offers better sound quality for a given
data rate.
✦Ogg Vorbis — Ogg Vorbis is a free, unpatented audio compression
technology offering better sound quality than MP3 for a given data
rate (or smaller ﬁles for the same quality). You can compare the two
at www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/listen.html. A limited amount of
hardware to play Ogg Vorbis ﬁles exists, including Digital Network’s
Rio Karma portable and some of KiSS Technology’s DVD players.
✦Windows Media Audio — WMA is a Microsoft-developed compres-
sion technology also with better sound quality than the older MP3
format. Microsoft has submitted their Windows Media Series 9 com-
pression to the Society of Motion Picture Television Engineers, but
how that plays out remains to be seen. The Microsoft technology
also includes provisions for digital rights management, which may
restrict what you can do with some sound ﬁles more tightly than
demanded by copyright law.
✦Real Audio — RA is an older compression format proprietary to Real
Networks and offering performance inferior to MP3 and its successors.
Real Networks at one time bundled spyware with their software, so
you might want to avoid them anyhow.
The popularity of sharing music ﬁles over the Internet, and the claimed monu-
mental impacts to the music publishing business, have made copyrights and
copy protection (euphemistically called Digital Rights Management, or DRM)
front-page news. The developers and promoters of DRM technology are far
more interested in restricting what you can do than preserving what rights you
have under the law, however, so we suggest this approach:
✦Comply with copyrights — What you can do with copyrighted mate-
rial is set by law and, in some cases, by license agreements. Ethically,
if you’re going to have the material, you should comply with those. In
our case, for example, we don’t download or upload music ﬁles on
the Internet; all the thousands of MP3 ﬁles we have are ones we
made and keep to ourselves.

Chapter 16 ✦Sound Cards, Speakers, Microphones, and MP3 Players 261
✦Refuse to accept DRM — DRM technology provides mechanisms to
control what can be done with protected information. Unfortunately,
implementing DRM implies decisions about who exercises that 
control — probably not you — and how much of your privacy you
give up so the information can be controlled. You don’t have to buy
products that include Digital Rights Management. That could well
mean you don’t buy the latest CDs if they’re copy protected, but the
history of copy-protected software says that if enough people reject
DRM, it won’t survive.
In the long run, DRM technology will start to show up not just in ﬁles or media,
but as mechanisms embedded into your PC itself. What that implies, and what
control over your PC you will lose, remains to be seen. The marketing spin has
been that DRM is better for the consumer; you owe it to yourself to research the
subject (start at www.eff.org/Infra/trusted_computing/20031001_tc.php)
and make your own informed decision.
Who Controls Your PC?
Don’t make the mistake of thinking digital rights management is some abstract
notion you don’t have to worry about. We state several times in this book that
we intensely dislike Microsoft’s Windows Product Activation (WPA). WPA is a
form of digital rights management, is a liability to you, and has no value to any-
one but Microsoft. Consider this sequence of events:
1. We upgraded a Dell machine that had been running for about a year to
Windows XP Professional from Windows XP Home. At the end of the
install, Windows said activation was required before we could log on.
2. We did the activation over the Internet, and the process completed nor-
mally. When we went to log on, however, Windows again said we had to
activate. A second Internet activation failed, but telephone activation 
succeeded.
3. Attempting to log on after the second dialog again produced the dialog
box stating activation was required.
4. We spent about 6 hours on the phone with Microsoft tech support trying
different things, with no success. Every attempt to activate produced a
dialog box saying Windows is already activated and activation isn’t neces-
sary, but every attempt to log on said logon could not proceed without
activation.
Ultimately, after being disconnected from tech support and refusing to yet again
wait for nearly an hour on hold, we gave up, reformatted the drive, and installed
Windows XP Professional onto the empty disk. We had backups of all the useful
data on the system, but should any of the other vendors of activation-locked soft-
ware on the system have refused to re-activate, we’d have lost that software.

Musical Instrument Digital Interface
The wider range of sounds possible with wave audio allowed sound cards such
as the Creative Labs SoundBlaster and its later competitors to replace older
synthesized audio designs. The newer cards didn’t eliminate synthesizers,
though — they’re alive and well in PC sound cards supporting the Musical
Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI, pronounced mih-dee), which is a standardized
way of telling a synthesizer what you want it to do. Although it can’t create all
the sounds that wave audio can, MIDI has the key advantage that it takes far
less data to represent things with MIDI than with wave audio. A typical MIDI
sequence may consume only 10KB per minute and, for things MIDI does well,
can sound as good as wave audio.
The most valuable application of MIDI is in recording, editing, and playing
music. A MIDI ﬁle is a sequence of commands — mostly notes — that you send
to a synthesizer. Because the ﬁle contains commands, not the music itself, you
can edit it, speed it up, slow it down, change the pitch and key of the music,
and change the instruments playing. A MIDI ﬁle plays against a set of instru-
ments. Each instrument being played is assigned a channel number; a MIDI ﬁle
contains interleaved messages for each instrument (“play this note this loud
262 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals

One of Microsoft’s responses to us during this episode was to say that ours was
an exceptional situation, whatever the cause. Our view is that perspective
ignores users and suggests it’s permissible for there to be more than zero WPA
failures. Six hours on the phone, lost data, and possibly lost software says to us
that the customer’s data, software, and system are secondary concerns to
Microsoft’s proﬁts. That’s particularly evident when you add in the fact that
Microsoft’s largest customers receive software not locked with product activa-
tion, just the customers without enough leverage to ﬁght it off.
This episode illustrates that smaller customer’s PCs and data integrity are all
potential victims of MS’s anti-piracy campaign. Microsoft has stronger digital
rights management technology in development, technology called Palladium
that isolates third-party software from anything you do to your PC’s hardware or
software. It won’t protect you from those third-party applications, though, so
there’s nothing to prevent, say, the RIAA (which has considered attacking the PCs
of consumers suspected of ﬁle trading) from creating an application you can’t
remove that summarily deletes any MP3 ﬁle found on your system, regardless of
its source. U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch said of destroying ﬁle traders PCs during a
hearing: “If that’s the only way, then I’m all for destroying their machines.”
If you’re unwilling to tolerate Microsoft’s point of view, that some losses due to
product activation are acceptable and that third parties can be given uncon-
trolled rights on your PCs, you should evaluate alternatives to Windows and
Microsoft Ofﬁce. Your options include Linux and OpenOfﬁce, alternatives that
have been written by people in some cases strongly opposed to the denial of
your legitimate rights in the name of commerce.

until I tell you to stop”), along with systemwide messages to set tempo and
other variables.
Two of the key measures for MIDI synthesizers are polyphony (the number of
notes the synthesizer can play at once) and timbres (the number of different
sounds or instruments it can play at once). The hardware on sound cards 
can be limited in the degree of polyphony and timbres available, but with the
advent of the incredibly fast processors now available, software synthesizers
can support 200 voices or more at once.
CD Audio and Line Interfaces
Most sound cards offer two other capabilities besides waveform audio and MIDI —
they can accept analog audio signals from your CD-ROM or DVD drive, letting you
play audio tracks through your computer’s speakers, and they can both accept and
output “line” audio signals (the sort that you get at the tape in and tape out jacks
on your stereo preampliﬁer). A device called a mixer goes in front of the waveform
audio input electronics on your sound card to implement these capabilities, as
shown in Figure 16-9. Each of the individual sources routes to the mixer, which
contains volume controls for each channel plus a master volume control on the
output channel. The mixer itself is controlled by the processor in your computer,
from which it receives messages to set the volume for each channel and the mas-
ter control. The processor can also mute any or all of the channels, so you can
suppress noise that may occur on channels you’re not using.

The mixer gives you more than volume control on multiple inputs; it lets you
do more with your sound card. For example:
✦Recording sound outputs — You can record the MIDI output from
your sound card or music from an audio CD in your CD-ROM drive.
✦Combining sounds — Suppose you want to build up multiple tracks
in a sound ﬁle. You can record the ﬁrst track, then play it back and
simultaneously record additional sound on top of it. Or, suppose you
want to record a voice and sound track to go with a presentation.
You can do that by pulling in CD audio or MIDI for the music and
adding the voiceover from the microphone input.
USB Audio
Computers using USB — a digital connection — between the computer and 
the speakers don’t require a sound card because most of the functions of the
sound card are moved to the speakers in a USB setup. Here’s what happens:
✦Wave audio — Digital audio streams from WAV ﬁles or from effects
embedded directly into programs require neither a sound card nor
synthesizer software if you’re using USB speakers. The digital stream
goes from the processor out the USB port to the speakers, where it
gets converted to analog audio and played.
✦MIDI audio — All PC processors since the 200 MHz Intel Pentium
MMX processor have been capable of doing the MIDI synthesis oper-
ation in software, which is all you need to support MIDI on a USB
speaker-based system. MIDI commands go into the synthesizer soft-
ware, which in turn outputs wave audio to the speakers.
✦CD-ROM or DVD audio — Some very old CD-ROM drives are inca-
pable of digitally transferring the data on an audio CD to your PC. 
If you have one of those drives, you’ll have to have a sound card to
input the analog audio signal and play audio CDs. (Of course, if you
really don’t have a sound card, it’s less expensive to replace the
CD-ROM drive with a new one than it is to add a sound card.)
The sound card manufacturers recognized the threat to their products from
USB speakers and responded by adding new technology such as 3D sound
effects to their cards.
Choosing Speakers
Choosing speakers for your computer is as easy — and as difﬁcult — as choos-
ing speakers for your home or car stereo. The speakers that come packaged
with computer systems are generally abysmal, not worth using even with the
264 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals

cheapest transistor radio. If sound quality matters to you, you’ll want better
speakers than come with most computers.
If you have an auxiliary or tape input on your stereo, you can ﬁnd out what a
good set of speakers can do for you by wiring your sound card over to your
stereo. Use your stereo pre-ampliﬁer and ampliﬁer to power the speakers, not
your sound card, because the sound card doesn’t have enough power to drive
the speakers properly. You’ll need a male mini phone connector on the com-
puter end, and male RCA phono jacks on the stereo end. If you get a cable set
up for stereo, you’ll hear both channels through the stereo. Be careful to make
sure the stereo volume control is all the way down when you power things up,
just in case the output level from your sound card is higher than your stereo
expects.
What you’re going to hear when you do this experiment is that there’s more,
tighter bass; clearer, cleaner treble; and overall much more appealing sound.
This will be true for playing audio CDs, for multimedia titles and presentations,
and for games. The difference will be even more dramatic if you have a sound
card able to exploit multiple surround sound speakers through your audio sys-
tem. Live with the difference for a while, and then reconnect your old computer
speakers. If you’re appalled by the difference, you’re in the market for new com-
puter speakers. It’s important to evaluate speakers both ways — how much bet-
ter the new ones sound and how much worse the old ones sound after you’ve
spent some time with the new ones. You hear differences one way that you
don’t with the other, so you need to do both to get a complete evaluation.
The kind of speakers you want depends somewhat on what you do. Action
games sound better with strong bass and do a far better job of localizing
sounds with speakers both behind and in front of you. You might want a more
full-range speaker for music, but can do well with a good budget speaker for
the voice tracks in a self-paced training presentation.
There are important differences between computer speakers and stereo speak-
ers you need to think about:
✦Magnetic shielding — Most speakers depend on strong electromag-
netic ﬁelds to provide a reference for the moving cone that actually
generates sound. Strong magnets help create better sound, but can
lead to problems with distorted images or colors on your monitor.
Good computer speakers are shielded to compensate for that sensi-
tivity of monitors.
✦Power ampliﬁers — Every sound system needs a power ampliﬁer
strong enough to drive the speakers. There’s one built into your
stereo, but not into your sound card. (More precisely, the one in your
sound card is usually too weak to do the whole job.) You need ampli-
ﬁed speakers to couple into your computer and provide good sound.
If you use speakers designed for a stereo, you’ll need a separate
ampliﬁer between the computer and the speakers.
Chapter 16 ✦Sound Cards, Speakers, Microphones, and MP3 Players 265

Be careful about ampliﬁer power ratings because they’re not all the
same. The ratings to look for are Root Mean Square (RMS) power,
which is the average power to a single speaker, and Total power,
which is the RMS power times the number of speakers. Ignore Peak
power ratings because they don’t relate much to the sound you’ll get
from an ampliﬁer.
✦3D sound — You need a capable sound card and additional speakers
to hear surround sound from your PC.
Surround sound requires additional speakers and connections to
those speakers from your computer. Few motherboard sound sys-
tems provide the multi-channel outputs, but many sound cards do.
The speaker conﬁgurations used with surround sound are the same
as used with home theaters and other surround sound systems.
Surround sound speaker layouts have names like 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, or 7.1,
meaning there are 4 to 7 separate audio channels, each with their
own speaker, plus one subwoofer channel for very low bass. Figure
16-10 shows a typical 5.1 setup. The subwoofer position is largely a
matter of convenience because the very low bass is not sensitive to
placement.

conﬁguration
The Acoustic Authority A3780 computer speakers are high-quality, general-
purpose desktop units. They’re analog speakers, not USB, but the combination
of a hefty power ampliﬁer, massive subwoofer, and huge magnets in the mid-
range drivers give them a great sound. They have a 2.1 conﬁguration — a sub-
woofer and two higher frequency satellite speakers — with a wired remote to
control power, volume, and bass (see Figure 16-11).

MP3 Players
MP3 compression lets you store audio tracks in a relatively small space. MP3
files compressed at 128 Kbps require less than a megabyte per minute, so one of
the commonly-available 256MB ﬂash memory cards can store well over 4 hours
of music. Nor do MP3-encoded ﬁles require much processing to decompress —
a relatively slow processor (so it requires little power) is enough. Those two
characteristics — small ﬁle size and battery-power-compatible decompression —
make portable MP3 players possible. In a box smaller than your hand you can
store many hours of music and the electronics necessary to play it back on
headphones. Use a tiny hard disk instead of ﬂash memory and you expand the
internal storage to gigabytes, approaching enough music to play all day with-
out repetition.
Figure 16-12 shows the ﬂow of music from different sources to your MP3 player.
You compress music from CD, the Internet, or recordings you’ve made to MP3
format using software such as Musicmatch. (Some CDs include varieties of copy
protection, taking away your right to make legitimate copies for your own use,
and likely no longer conform to the CD technical standards. Philips, the co-
inventor of the CD format, has threatened to sue companies calling non-standard
disks CDs, but has not followed through.) You then copy the MP3 ﬁles out to
the MP3 player.
Chapter 16 ✦Sound Cards, Speakers, Microphones, and MP3 Players 267

Figure 16-12: Getting music onto an MP3 player
If your MP3 player supports the common Windows USB storage interface, the
player looks like a disk drive to Windows, and therefore, what software you use
to download to the player is a matter of personal preference. If your player uses
a non-standard proprietary interface, as do some cameras that include an MP3
player function, you could be forced to use the manufacturer’s software. Being
forced to use speciﬁc software might in turn impose digital rights management
and restrict what you can do with your property, legal rights notwithstanding.
Other compressed ﬁle formats compete with MP3, but may or may not be 
supported on your player. Ogg Vorbis is an open source competitor, while
Windows Media Audio, RealPlayer, and others commonly use proprietary for-
mats to offer increased compression in exchange for accepting digital rights
management. MP3PRO is a higher compression extension to MP3, but not
widely supported.
Working with Microphones
Unless you’re doing high-quality professional sound recording, your applica-
tion for a microphone is likely to be one of these:
✦Voice annotation — You can record sound ﬁles and attach them
within documents in many applications, including Microsoft Word
and Excel.
✦Voice recognition — Software listening to your microphone can
match what you say to a vocabulary, giving your computer some
ability to react to what you say.

✦Internet phone — You can create a two-way voice connection across
the Internet, allowing conversation with people connected to the Net
and using compatible software.
✦Videoconferencing — Much the same as for audio with an Internet
phone, you can create a two-way voice and video connection across
the Internet.
You can choose the microphone you use to make these applications easier,
although for the most part you’re looking for one that stays out of the way and
delivers clear sound. You can get microphones built into webcams (such as
the Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000), ones that sit on your desk, and ones com-
bined with headphones in a headset.
Voice annotation
Windows includes a simple application called Sound Recorder that lets you 
record from a microphone (or any other source on your sound card); a variety of
third-party applications, of which we’re partial to GoldWave (www.goldwave.com),
offer that capability with far more control and features. Using any of these pro-
grams and a microphone connected to your sound card, you can record your 
comments and embed them into a document.
You can also simply record into a ﬁle, making your laptop a portable voice
recorder with very large capacity.
Reaching for a microphone every time you create an annotation is awkward.
That problem, combined with the problem of ambient noise in an ofﬁce, makes
the headsets telephone operators use (ones that combine a headphone with a
small microphone) very desirable.
Speech recognition
Speech recognition is terribly difﬁcult for computers to do well despite the
best efforts of brilliant researchers over many decades. Speech recognition is a
software-intensive process that tries to make choices to classify what the com-
puter recorded. Phonemes — the ﬁrst classiﬁcation applied in many recognition
systems — are the basic sound units in spoken language, covering voicing,
articulation, accent, and others. A recognition system simpliﬁes the speech
recognition problem by turning raw sound into phonemes, reducing the vol-
ume of data and the number of choices higher layers in the processor have to
examine. As the recognition process continues, it abstracts basic structures to
more complex ones — words, phrases, and understood concepts.
A microphone suited for speech recognition is essential for accurate results. A
speech recognition microphone will isolate sounds from the speaker, keeping out
background noise and the voices of other speakers. A directional microphone,
one on a headset, or even a throat microphone are candidates to consider.
After training, PC software can recognize speech in real time with accuracy of
about 90 percent or better. You’ll have to decide if that’s good enough, keeping in
Chapter 16 ✦Sound Cards, Speakers, Microphones, and MP3 Players 269

mind that 90 percent accuracy means on average one word out of every 10 will
be wrong and need to be corrected. You’ll also ﬁnd that dictation is very different
than writing — not everyone thinks in ways that lead to coherent dictation.
Whether speech recognition software is useful for you depends on what you
expect. We can both type between 50 and 100 words per minute, so there’s no
direct speed gain from dictation, and the time it takes to go back and correct
recognition errors makes recognition take longer than typing would have to
begin with. Some friends of ours, however, are hunt-and-peck two-ﬁnger typists
so slow it’s painful to watch and will do anything to avoid typing. They’re good
candidates for speech recognition.
Voice over IP and Internet phones
As recently as early 2000 when the third edition of this book was published,
broadband Internet connections were still relatively rare, and Internet teleph-
ony was most often a clumsy lash-up using programs like Microsoft NetMeeting.
The problem at the time was not only the availability of appropriate software,
but also that running real telephones over a computer network is hard —
telephones need a continuous, uninterrupted stream of data to give you con-
tinuous speech. If the transmission pauses even slightly, say due to congestion
in the network somewhere along the way, there’s a gap in the sound as the
supply of wave audio data runs dry. Moreover, you need to send 64 Kbps of data
each way to maintain a telephone connection, and you can’t do that through a
conventional modem. You either need to compress the data down to rates of
20 to 53 Kbps or less, or you need a broadband connection.
270 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals
It’s Hard to Do Recognition Well
We once tested some voice recognition software being developed by a major
software manufacturer for integration into other products. The software did word
recognition using menu commands in individual Windows applications along
with some built-in phrases as the range of what it would recognize.
The end result for us during testing was that the software wasn’t accurate
enough to be useful, correctly identifying only 50 to 80 percent of the words we
spoke. This isn’t good enough to replace keyboards, mice, and other input forms
because the effort to deal with the errors is much greater than the value of the
words it gets right. (Other recognition software is much more accurate than this.)
The episode that really tells us how hard recognition can be occurred with that
software. One of the commands it was always supposed to recognize was “Close
window,” which was supposed to do the obvious thing — close the active win-
dow. We spent about half an hour training the software to know voice and
speech patterns, and then tried to see if the computer would recognize the
phrase. After about 10 times with no results, and completely exasperated by
then, we said “Close the @#$% window.”
Of course, that worked.

The situation is completely different today.
The ﬁrst change since 2000 was the development of the Voice over Internet
Protocol (VoIP), which gives you the ability to run real-time voice data streams
over the Internet without constant pauses and hiccups. Equipment is available
to support VoIP, including gear that plugs into your broadband-connected LAN
on one side and your analog telephone equipment on the other. The Cisco ATA
186, for example, supports two voice ports, each with its own independent
telephone number, connecting the unit to your LAN through its 10/100Base-T
Ethernet port.
The second change is the emergence of telephone companies offering the equiva-
lent of conventional Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) using VoIP. One of the
best known is Vonage (start reading at www.vonage.com/learn_tour.php),
which offers a package of domestic U.S. local and long distance calls, and calls to
Canada for a ﬂat-rate price. (You pay for your broadband connection separately.)
The service includes the usual POTS feature set, including Caller ID, Call Waiting,
and voicemail. Because the service works over your broadband network, it travels
alongside your regular network trafﬁc without tying up a telephone line. The serv-
ice works no matter where you plug into an Internet broadband connection —
if you carry the equipment with you, you have your local phone service at hand
anywhere in the world you can get broadband. Better yet, you can install the
equipment behind your ﬁrewall (see Chapter 13), with only minor conﬁguration
required to forward UDP ports 5060 and 5061 to the Cisco ATA Vonage uses.
Picking a Sound System
The issues you need to think through regarding sound cards, speakers, and
microphones center around what kinds of sounds you expect to handle, how
much you care about the quality of sound reproduction you get, and how many
people you want to hear what you’re doing.
✦Kinds of sounds — The simple beeps and honks that punctuate the
user interface in Windows are simply attention-getters. They quickly
become part of the background — sounds you notice more by their
absence. Any combination of sound card and speaker that works reli-
ably will do. Although adequate sound hardware is almost universal,
games and presentations work much better with good speakers
instead of the paper-cup-sized ones sold as a package with many
computers.
The kinds of sounds you’ll play are different based on the applications
you run. Games stress impulsive sounds (good bass and high end),
while for presentations you’d want to have speakers that deliver
clear, understandable speech (which requires good mid-range with
good power handling). Never buy speakers whose performance mat-
ters to you without hearing them ﬁrst, preferably driven by the sound
card you expect to use.
Chapter 16 ✦Sound Cards, Speakers, Microphones, and MP3 Players 271

✦Sound quality — Beyond the minimum threshold that keeps sound
from being annoying, the sound quality you want really depends on
how closely you’re going to listen to it. Background noise has the
minimum requirement. Presentations, telephony, and videoconferenc-
ing require good intelligibility, but not necessarily good ﬁdelity. Casual
music requires good ﬁdelity. Critical listening to music requires you
abandon the computer and move to your high-quality stereo —
sound boards aren’t as good as a quality stereo.
Multimedia information, such as training sequences, falls into the
same category as presentations — it needs to be intelligible to every-
one listening.
✦Privacy and groups — You don’t want to impose your sounds 
on others in close ofﬁce environments. It gets irritating quickly.
However, you deﬁnitely want everyone to hear if you’re doing 
presentations.
Remember that — except for laptops — sound is relatively easy to upgrade.
Sound cards are relatively inexpensive, and simply plug in. Speakers can be
unplugged and swapped out, as can microphones. Business users may want to
consider headsets plugged into the sound cards rather than speakers. Small,
lightweight headsets can be plugged into telephones and computers, switching
between the two to answer the phone.
Top Support Questions
Troubleshooting sound problems is a little different than most other trouble-
shooting because the usual troubleshooting approach of stripping the PC
down to bare essentials often doesn’t apply. The following questions and
answers help highlight what can go wrong and suggest the approaches you 
can use to diagnose and repair the problem.
Q: I only hear sound out of one speaker. What’s happening and what can I do?
A: You can troubleshoot this by isolating the problem to the sound card/
computer, cable, or speakers. You can test your speakers on an alternate
source, such as a Walkman, portable stereo, or other audio source. If the test
works (and you used the same cable), the problem is probably in the computer
or sound card setup. If the test fails, try a different cable. If that works, the
cable is the problem; otherwise, you might have a problem with the speakers.
Check the cabling between speakers and make sure the balance control is set
properly. If your speakers have independent power sources, make sure both
are working (don’t forget that batteries fail).
Q: Why does the volume control on my speakers not work?
A: Your speakers require either an external power supply or batteries to power
the ampliﬁer, which is what implements the volume control. Make sure that
you have fresh batteries or the appropriate power supply and that the power
switch is turned on.
272 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals

Q: Why does the red light on my speakers not turn on when I turn on the
power switch?
A: Verify that you have fresh batteries or that you’re using a power supply for
the speakers and that it’s powered on. If the speakers plug in, make sure
there’s power at the wall outlet.
Q: Can I use any speakers with any subwoofer?
A: Not necessarily, because some speaker/subwoofer combinations have non-
standard connections. What you can do, though, is to cable the speakers as 
if there are two independent sets of speakers (the speakers themselves and
the subwoofer). You do that by connecting a “Y” adapter to your sound card.
Plug the tail of the Y into the computer and speakers into the branches.
(Alternatively, some subwoofers work when plugged into the line-out jack on
the sound card, eliminating the need to split the speaker-out jack connection.)
Q: I need to set up my computer for videoconferencing, but the noise is too
distracting to my ofﬁce mates. What can I do?
A: The best answer is the same solution as for noisy speakerphones — get 
a headset. You can get headsets that plug into your sound card speaker and
microphone jacks directly, giving you good sound quality, keeping background
noise out of your conversation, and keeping peace in your ofﬁce.
Q: There’s a microphone jack on the front of my speakers. Do I have to use it?
A: No. The microphone jack is strictly for convenience, as is the headphone
jack you might have on your speakers. A headphone jack on your speakers usu-
ally mutes the speaker itself when you plug in the headphones, so if you have
both microphone and headphone jacks, you can conveniently choose whether
you’ll use the speakers or a more quiet headset/microphone combination.
Q: I haven’t used my microphone in a while, and it’s stopped working. I
checked all the connections, and they’re okay. What happened?
A: Some microphones have small batteries inside that can drain over time. If
you have one of these, you may need to take the microphone apart and
replace the battery.
Summary
✦Computers produce sound using wave audio, FM synthesis, and MIDI
synthesis.
✦Wave audio can reproduce any sound. FM and MIDI synthesis mostly
reproduce music.
✦Computer speakers have important differences relative to conven-
tional stereo speakers, including shielding and built-in ampliﬁers.

you create that way can be immense and used to
require compromises to ﬁt within the limits of what a
personal computer can do. PCs are now so powerful
that the limits of what they can do with images and
video are virtually gone — even the major studios and
special effects houses now use farms of PCs to do much
of the behind-the-scenes work.
The improvements in digital still cameras have been
particularly dramatic. When we wrote the ﬁrst edition 
of this book in early 1996, we used a 35 mm Canon ﬁlm
camera for all the pictures we took because the avail-
able digital cameras couldn’t produce publication-
quality images. For over 5 years now, we’ve used digital
cameras exclusively for all the photographs we’ve
taken. The picture quality is good enough that we no
longer bother with ﬁlm.

Still Image Photography
Let’s start with a simple problem — taking a photograph and getting it into
your computer. For a long time, your only option was to literally take a photo-
graph, have the ﬁlm processed, and scan the picture. That process has the 
disadvantage that it’s slow. Unless you use something like a Polaroid instant
camera that develops the print while you wait, you have to go somewhere to
get the processing done. Even then, you have to go to where your computer
and scanner are before you have the digital result.
There’s another way. Building electronic sensors into a still camera —
substituting the sensor for the ﬁlm — creates a camera that records the 
electronic image directly. You can see the image in the viewﬁnder or down-
load it to a computer for viewing, printing, and further processing. Figure 17-1
shows what’s in a digital camera. The biggest difference between an electronic
camera and a ﬁlm camera is that, rather than focusing light through a shutter
on a strip of ﬁlm, the electronic camera focuses the image on a charge-coupled
device (CCD) or Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) array.
The body of the camera is ﬁlled with electronics and batteries, and an LCD
display (like in a laptop computer) serves as the primary or secondary
viewﬁnder. No shutter exists because the image sensor is constantly captur-
ing images.
Figure 17-1: A digital still camera substitutes an electronic
sensor for ﬁlm, recording the picture directly in memory.
Since you use no ﬁlm, the camera has to do something else with your picture
when you push the button. What it does is store it in memory.

Image resolution and memory
The amount of memory an image requires depends on its horizontal and verti-
cal resolution, in pixels, and on the size of each pixel (which in turn determines
the number of possible colors for each pixel). Using 24-bit pixels (over 16 mil-
lion colors), an image of 300×200 pixels requires less than 180K of memory. An
uncompressed image of 1,600×1,200 pixels (still in 24-bit color) requires nearly
51⁄2MB. Uncompressed images from the Kodak DX4530 we used for this book —
at 2,580×1,932 resolution in 24-bit color — consume 14.3MB. Compressed
images range from 500K to several megabytes. Professional digital cameras, at
resolutions as high as 4,536×3,024 pixels, require even more memory.
Figure 17-2 shows how good a picture from a digital camera can be (there’s 
a color version at the back of the book). Except for conversion to black and
white, what you see here is exactly as we received the ﬁle and has not been
retouched for publication. If you look carefully, you’ll see a level of resolution,
sharpness, and tonal gradation competitive with that of ﬁlm cameras.

also reproduced in color at the back of the book.

The number of pixels in the image, and therefore the amount of memory an
image occupies, is a critical issue for digital cameras. Consider what happens
when you want to print your photograph on your 1,200 dpi (dots per inch) color
printer, ﬁlling the entire page with the picture. Suppose we try to print a low-
resolution, 320×240 image onto a page. If the printable area on the page is 10×7.5
inches, then along the 320-pixel dimension we have about 30 pixels per inch —
1/400th of what the printer can do. Figure 17-4 shows different views of a digital
photograph we took to illustrate what can happen. The image on the left in the
ﬁgure is the complete photo, with good resolution — it’s 2,580×1,932 pixels, and
would print at nearly 550 dpi if reproduced full width on this page. We took a
small section of the image — including part of the dog’s right eye — and blew it
up on the right side of the ﬁgure to show the effects of pixel replication. The
image on the left is small but sharp, while the image on the right is larger and
unacceptably pixelated. This is the same effect that happens when you blow up
an image too far trying to make it ﬁt on a printed page. No matter how high the
printer resolution, it can’t make up for lack of detail in the source image.
The low-quality results you get from excessive pixel replication mean that —
depending on how far you’re going to enlarge your photo — you may not be
satisﬁed with the results from a low-resolution digital camera. Mid-range digital
cameras (such as the Kodak DX4530 we used for this edition) have resolutions
278 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals

approaching what you can get with 35 mm ﬁlm, though, so if you’re careful to
compose your photo so you ﬁll the viewﬁnder and don’t have to crop, you’ll
get excellent results.

Medium- and high-resolution digital photos come at a price, however, which is
that they require more memory to store in the camera. Flash memory in your
camera stores the photos you take, similar to ﬁlm in a conventional camera.
Uncompressed images on the Kodak DX4530 require 14.3MB, so if the camera
contains 32MB of memory, you can store only two images. A camera like that
would be useless, but there are two ways to solve the problem:
✦Image compression — The same lossy image compression technol-
ogy used as the basis for MPEG video compression (see Chapter 6) is
applied in JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) compression for
still frame pictures. JPEG compression reduces the 14.3MB images to
between 500K and 4MB, letting you store 8 to 64 photos in 32MB of
memory. Higher compression levels would let you store even more
photos, but you lose image quality at higher compression levels.
Many cameras give you the option to trade off fewer pictures in
memory for better quality, and some give you the option to reject
lossy compression altogether, using lossless compression or no com-
pression instead.
✦More storage — This is the “bigger hammer” idea. Flash memory has
gotten relatively large, and relatively inexpensive. After adding a
256MB Secure Digital card into the Kodak DX4530, for example, the
camera reports it can store over 160 photos.
There are, sadly, far too many memory formats used in cameras. Different cam-
eras have used ﬂoppy disks, CD-R, DVD-R, ﬂash memory and hard drives in
Chapter 17 ✦Digital Cameras, Video Capture, and DVDs 279

CompactFlash format, Multimedia Card (MMC) and Secure Digital (SD) ﬂash
memory, and the Sony memory stick. The proliferation of formats tends to
keep you from using old memory with new cameras.
A darkroom on your desk
You have to transfer the pictures from your camera to your computer before
you can do much with them. Nearly every camera you can buy today uses a
USB interface between PC and camera. Either Windows generic software or
software speciﬁc to your camera controls the process, pulling images from the
camera and storing them as ﬁles on your disk. Once you have ﬁles in a stan-
dard format, any image processing program can crop, recolor, and otherwise
reprocess the pictures for you, and can send the results to your printer.
Let’s do some calculations to analyze what resolution you want in a digital
camera. Guidelines from Kodak suggest you’ll want from 150 to 175 pixels per
inch in your prints; using 150 pixels per inch, Table 17-1 shows the minimum
number of pixels you’ll want in your camera for a variety of print sizes. Table
17-2 repeats the calculation using the assumption you’d want a higher 300 pix-
els per inch resolution.

There’s another conclusion you can draw from Table 17-1. Knowing that com-
puter monitors typically deliver 90 dots per inch or more (corresponding to
0.28 mm pitch or ﬁner), it’s apparent that even the least expensive digital cam-
era should have enough resolution for pictures destined for Web pages.
Ultimately, digital cameras are still cameras, so the issues that are important
for ﬁlm cameras are equally important for digital ones. You still care about the
focal length, resolution, contrast, and speed of the lens. You still have to have
enough light to form a picture, so the effective “ﬁlm speed” matters. You still
have to use a ﬂash in low-light situations, so the synchronization and control
of the ﬂash unit (and the time it takes to recharge) are important. You have to
worry about parallax between the lens and the viewﬁnder and may want fea-
tures like macro focus and a self-timer. These are cameras; only the “ﬁlm” is
different.
Choosing a digital camera
There’s more to choosing a digital camera than getting the greatest number 
of pixels you can afford. You can get over 5 megapixels in a reasonably priced
camera, enough to do an 8×10 print with good quality if you ﬁll the frame.
Getting a photo you’d want to print that size, however, requires you look at
some other factors:
✦Auxiliary lenses — Some cameras offer detachable lenses, or add-on
lenses you can slide over the standard lens. You can add telephoto or
wide-angle capabilities to your camera with auxiliary lenses, letting
you ﬁll the frame for shots you’d otherwise miss. Check how the
lenses ﬁt on the camera because some of them block the viewﬁnder
and leave you no choice but to frame the picture with the LCD panel.
✦Battery system — The power drain from a camera is relatively ﬁxed,
so the battery system in your camera determines how long you can
shoot before you have to recharge or change batteries. Cameras that
let you replace batteries with standard types let you keep shooting
when there’s no time to recharge.
✦Charging — Cameras with fast rechargers get you back in action
quicker if you can’t carry spare batteries. The worst combination is 
a proprietary battery with a slow recharger because there’s nothing
you can do but wait when you run out of power. Watch for rechargers
that don’t handle 120 to 240 V if you travel internationally, or you
could be stuck unable to recharge at all unless you can buy a power
converter.
✦Color rendition — Cameras render color with varying accuracy. 
The camera is only the ﬁrst step in the color rendering chain, which
includes your monitor and printer too, but bad color rendition by 
the camera makes everything else just that much harder.
✦Cycle rate — Many digital cameras can capture a freeze-frame
sequence of images in rapid succession. Some capture more frames
than others, and some capture at faster or slower rates. Few let you
control the frame rate.
Chapter 17 ✦Digital Cameras, Video Capture, and DVDs 281

✦Delay — Digital cameras impose a delay between when you push the
shutter button and when they actually shoot the picture. Much of
that delay is the time required for automatic focus operations, and
some cameras enable you to prefocus by pushing the shutter button
part way down. Too long a delay, and you’ll miss the action shot
you’re trying for.
✦Dynamic range — The sensor in your camera has limits to how
bright or how dim the extremes in your photo can be before they
wash out or fade out, respectively. Dynamic range refers to the differ-
ence between the brightest and dimmest areas, and the larger the
possible dynamic range, the more shots you can take with good
detail.
✦Exposure accuracy — The automatic exposure metering in your 
camera can operate from a single spot, multiple spots, an average of
the entire frame, or other measures. The metering the camera uses
needs to match how you use the camera — for close-ups, for distant
shots, or in other ways.
✦Feel — Different people expect cameras to ﬁt differently in their
hands, and expect the camera controls to fall to hand in different
places. Buying a camera before you’ve held it is asking to be 
disappointed.
✦Flash — Nearly all digital cameras include a built-in ﬂash, but some
lack the ability to choose ﬂash modes. You’ll want at least ﬁll ﬂash,
which ﬁlls in shadows, and automatic modes.
✦Focus — How the camera focuses determines what you can shoot
and how well. Close-up shots will be out of focus if the camera
chooses the wrong parts of the photo as the focus point.
✦Memory — How much memory comes with the camera determines if
you’ll need to add more. The type of add-in memory the camera
requires determines if modules you already own will work, or if you’ll
282 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals
I’ll Eat Onion Rings with that Battery, Please
A lot of electronics are packed into digital cameras, all of which want to eat
power from the batteries about as fast as you would chow down a carton of
onion rings. Because the batteries have to ﬁt in the camera (and the camera in
your hand), there’s a limit to how much power the electronics can use. Too much
power drain, and the batteries have a very short life — you’ll go through them
like fast food.
It’s a testament to the ingenuity of camera designers (and to improvements in
battery technology over the past several years) that their products can run as
long as they do on a handful of small batteries. The rate of improvement in bat-
tery technology has slowed, though, so it’s going to be a major challenge to con-
tinue to make signiﬁcant improvements in how many pictures you get from a set
of batteries (or from one charging). We use only high-energy lithium photo bat-
teries or rechargeable nickel metal-hydride (NiMH) batteries in digital cameras.

have to buy new ones. You don’t need a separate reader if the camera
uses USB to download images to your PC. No matter what memory
you use, it’s going to keep your pictures stored in the camera when
the camera is turned off.
✦Software — Cameras often include image-processing software in the
package. Some is good; some is junk. See if you can download and
try out the software before you ﬁnalize your choice. If not, look for
online or printed reviews.
✦Zoom — It’s pointless to buy a digital camera without optical zoom
because you won’t reliably be able to ﬁll the frame with the image
you want, which means you won’t get pictures as sharp and high-
resolution as you should. Cameras typically offer both optical and
digital zoom; you want optical zoom for as much of the total zoom as
possible to be sure you’re using the entire image sensor.
Of these factors, most important are dynamic range, zoom, color rendition,
and the battery system. It remains to be seen if the recent crop of printer
docks, which are small color inkjet printers packaged with a camera dock, are
useful. We don’t suggest printing without having ﬁrst enhanced the photos
with your PC, so it’s unclear if there’s any value to combining the printer with
the camera dock.
Keep an eye out for the low battery indicator while you’re using a digital cam-
era. We didn’t see it once and had the camera shut down while it was com-
pressing a shot to ﬂash memory. The memory was corrupted and had to be
reformatted, which caused us to lose all the shots it held.
Keeping track of hundreds of photos can be hard, and you won’t be able
to see them all onscreen at once. If you’re running Windows XP, navigate
in Windows Explorer to the folder with the photos you’d like to index and
right click in the folder. Choose to customize the folder, and set it up for
photos (use the one for fewer pictures). Turn off folder view if it’s on, and
then print the pictures from the task choices in the left pane. You’ll be able
to choose how many thumbnails print per page.
Video
If there’s any one thing you might want to do with your computer that has the
potential to overwhelm what even today’s fast, high-capacity computers can
do, it’s capturing and editing digital video. The problem with digital video is
that there’s so much of it — naively recording broadcast-quality video transfers
over 23MB per second onto disk. Here’s where that calculation comes from. 
A full video frame occurs 30 times per second, and contains (approximately)
512 pixels by 512 lines, for 30 × 512 × 512 = 7.8 million pixels per second. If we
record 3 bytes per pixel (24-bit color), that’s about 23MB per second, or 79GB
per hour. Practical video capture devices, such as the Pinnacle Systems Studio
Deluxe PCI video capture card, reduce that requirement down to about 13.5GB
per hour, but you’ll still need a lot of disk space to capture a signiﬁcant
amount of high-quality video.
Chapter 17 ✦Digital Cameras, Video Capture, and DVDs 283

You can capture lesser quality video, of the quality you’d use for videoconfer-
encing over a broadband Internet connection, from an inexpensive webcam.
The Microsoft NetMeeting software works between any two Windows PCs, giv-
ing you a full audio and video connection. Videoconferencing never worked
well over modems because they were too slow to give useful frame sizes and
frame rates, but broadband Internet connections at 256 Kbps and up work
quite well.
Video capture and editing
High-quality video capture and editing requires more and better hardware than
the simple webcams you’ll use for videoconferencing. You need a quality video
source, a well-engineered video capture card, a fast disk subsystem, and a
processor fast enough to keep it all running, but with today’s hardware, none
of that’s out of the ordinary.
If you have an IEEE 1394 or USB camcorder, you can dump video ﬁles directly
from the camera to disk. If you want to record live video, you’ll need a TV
tuner card (see Chapter 6). If you have composite video signals (that is, sepa-
rate video, left audio, and right audio channels), you can use either internal or
external hardware for your PC to capture the signals, digitize them, and store
them to disk. For internal hardware, we like the Pinnacle Systems Studio Deluxe.
If you’d rather not open your PC, and you have a USB 2.0 port, you can use the
Pinnacle Systems PCTV Deluxe, which includes the functions in Figure 17-5.
Software supplied with the PCTV Deluxe enables you to make your PC into 
a personal video recorder — like a VCR, only better — and enables you to
directly capture MPEG-2 compressed video from the tuner or from composite
video sources. The video quality is good, and if you also have Pinnacle
Systems Studio 8 (which will capture from the PCTV Deluxe), the combination
is quite capable.

284 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals

The combination of quality video capture hardware, video editing software
such as Studio 8 or Adobe Premiere, and a fast computer is more powerful
than you might expect. You can digitize from composite or S-video sources,
record clips to disk, then combine and edit clips to create a complete sequence.
When you’re done, you can output to a ﬁle for use on computers, or to video
for re-recording back to disk.
Although most any recent vintage PC is good enough for video editing, don’t
make the mistake of using an underpowered computer for rendering com-
pressed video ﬁles.
✦Processor — Compressing about an hour and a half of uncompressed
video onto a DVD with Pinnacle Systems Studio 8 takes about 10
hours on a 933 MHz Pentium III, but only about 5 hours on a 2.53 GHz
Pentium 4. The 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 we used in Chapter 25 should take
less than 4 hours. Any of those processors are fast enough for edit-
ing, but the compression speed difference is overwhelming unless
you plan to always let the run take overnight.
✦Operating system — The Windows NT File System (NTFS) used with
Windows NT/2000/XP has the ability to handle very large disks and
the huge ﬁles you’ll create with digital video, and is more reliable
than the FAT and FAT32 ﬁle systems used with Windows 9X. Windows
2000 and Windows XP have better graphics support (DirectX) than
Windows NT, making them the choice for video editing.
✦Memory — The same problem that makes a fast processor 
worthwhile — slinging around large quantities of data — makes it
useful to have a lot of memory for disk cache and program operations.
We consider 256MB a minimum for Windows 2000 and Windows XP;
bumping that ﬁgure to 512MB gives the software room to work,
caching video sequences and selected still images in memory. Ideally,
you’d have 1GB or more of memory.
✦Hard disk — At 13.5GB per hour, you’ll ﬁll a 160GB disk in less than
12 hours. You’ll need to store multiple copies of your work, too,
because you’ll have both the raw capture ﬁles and your ﬁnished out-
put. We suggest at least a 60GB drive if you’re doing video editing,
and much more if you’re serious about it. The machine you’ll see
how to build in Chapter 25 has 320GB of disk, which means you can
collect video for quite some time before getting around to editing
and compressing.
If you’re recording with the PCTV Deluxe, however, you’ll need far less
disk space because the unit will do DVD quality MPEG-2 compression
in real time. Recording at 6 Mbps (0.75 Mbps) translates to 2.7GB per
hour, which isn’t likely to stress any current-generation disk.
✦Video adapter and monitor — You’ll want good DirectX support in
your video card and an AGP interface to ensure all the features of
your video editing and mastering software work well. DirectX is par-
ticularly important so you can see the video in real time as you
record, and for smooth playback as you edit.
Chapter 17 ✦Digital Cameras, Video Capture, and DVDs 285

How high-resolution the display on which you edit depends on your
software. Pinnacle Systems Studio 8 doesn’t support windows bigger
than 1,024×768, but Adobe Premiere will use all the screen space you
have available, letting you show multiple control panes side-by-side.
✦Network — If you’re going to be moving large video ﬁles from one
machine to another on a LAN, you might want to consider gigabit
Ethernet for at least the machines involved in video. It takes over 20
minutes to move a 13.5GB ﬁle across an otherwise idle 100Base-T
network, but only 2.5 minutes on gigabit Ethernet.
Digital video cameras may connect through a USB or IEEE 1394 (FireWire) port.
Your PC will have a USB port already, but you may have to add the IEEE 1394
(FireWire) port. You’ll want a USB 2.0 port (with no USB 1.1 devices connected)
running at high speed to have enough bandwidth for high-quality video.
Making DVDs from video
Composing and editing video is somewhat different than handling digital still
images. We’ve used Pinnacle Systems Studio 8 as the basis for the following
example, but other video editing software does similar things. Here’s what
you’ll do:
✦Plan, set up, and shoot — You’ll do this if you’re making your own
movies, and what you do is straightforward — you ﬁgure out what
the end content is going to be, set up the different scenes you need,
and shoot. All the usual ideas (for example, storyboards, rehearsal,
and lighting) apply.
✦Capture the raw video and audio — You need to get the video into
your computer. You can record new footage directly into your com-
puter with a USB or IEEE 1394 camera, record directly using a con-
ventional analog video camera and a video acquisition card, or
record onto tape that you then play back into the video acquisition
card. If you’re using your PC to make DVDs, you’ll record live video
through the video capture card.
If you’re making a movie from new footage, you’re better off putting
each separate scene into a different ﬁle — you end up with smaller
ﬁles (which are easier to handle) and have more ﬂexibility to cut and
splice scenes. You can dub external audio — music, narration, or
other content — into your project; if you’re doing that, you’ll want to
record the raw audio as wave audio ﬁles.
We recommend making archive backups of all your clips for a given
sequence once you’ve recorded them so that they’re not lost if you happen
to make a mistake while editing. You can store the ﬁles elsewhere on disk
or can back up to your usual backup system.
✦Start a new project and import raw clips — Figure 17-6 shows a
screen shot from Pinnacle Systems Studio 8 in the middle of an edit-
ing session. There are three parts to the window: the segment edit
pane, the clip preview pane, and the timeline. The segment edit pane
286 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals

lets you work within a given video segment, including trimming the
segment at either end. The clip preview lets you play a segment or
several segments. The timeline lets you access all the clips you’ve
loaded into your project.
Figure 17-6: You want a high-resolution display card and large monitor for
digital video editing.
✦Edit the composite output — Once you’ve loaded your video clips,
use the timeline and segment editing window in Figure 17-6 to
remove extra scenes and, if you want, reorder the remaining scenes.
Making a DVD compatible with a DVD player gives you the opportunity to add
menus to your disk. Figure 17-7 shows the basic operation in Studio 8 — you
add menu segments to the timeline, and then link chapters in the menu to 
speciﬁc segments in your assembled timeline. Menus can link to other menus,
or to video segments. The thumbnail image displayed for a menu button can
be static or motion video.
Once you’ve edited your video segments and organized them with any menus
you want (the video will just play if there’s no menu), use the Make Movie tab in
Studio 8 to burn the video to your DVD writer. You’ll want to adjust the settings
for disk output to make a DVD and to use automatic quality selection, which
increases the compression level if necessary to ﬁt all your content onto the disk.

You’ll likely also want to make cover inserts for your DVDs; many DVD authoring
packages provide utilities for that purpose. You may want to grab still images
from the video for use on the covers, something Studio 8 does easily.
Summary
✦Digital still cameras let you get at your images faster, and without 
a scanner, but might not provide the resolution you need. The LCD
viewﬁnders on some models might be difﬁcult to use outdoors in
sunlight.
✦If you’re willing to pay what high-end digital still cameras cost, and
you’re a good photographer, you can get professional-quality photo-
graphs with a digital camera.
✦Data rates for raw, full-screen television video are easily within the
capability of most computers, although you’ll want to ensure you use
a fast enough interface (such as PCI or USB 2.0) and a good quality
video acquisition device. Make sure you have a lot of disk storage.

when you push the key and again when you release it.
Keyboard switches are subject to a wide range of force,
so their design is not as straightforward as you might
think. One of the most severe problems is that people
really hammer their keyboards at times, yet expect
them to survive for years. Figure 18-1 shows two key-
board switch designs. The one on the left in the ﬁgure
has an obvious design ﬂaw: letting the force directly
close the contacts. This design exposes the electrical
parts to physical damage under hard impact, eventually

resulting in unreliable operation. Better designs (such as the one on the right in
the ﬁgure) direct the force only to mechanical parts, allowing the switch designer
to control what happens to the contacts. No matter how hard you pound on a
keyboard using the right-hand switch design, the force on the contacts is only
that of the springs that support them. The base plate, not the contacts, absorbs
the key impact force.
Figure 18-1: Good keyboard switches protect the key contacts.
Keyboard switches need more than reliable contacts. People drop in paper
clips and food; spill coffee, wine, soda, and other sticky stuff; and generally
abuse the electronics terribly. The ﬁrst line of defense in a good keyboard is a
shield (see Figure 18-2) to keep debris and liquids out of the mechanism. The
ﬁgure shows not only how a shield can cover the circuit board that mounts 
the switches, but also how it can come up under the keycap to protect against
liquid spills. The debris and liquid shield completely covers the circuit board
holding the switches and extends up under the keycaps. Anything falling into
the keyboard gets caught by the shield and is kept out of the switches and
electronics.
If you do spill, the resulting stickiness can make a keyboard unusable. You
can shut down the computer, disconnect the keyboard, and then wash it
out with clean water. (Yes, you can shower with your keyboard.) Let it dry
completely, then try it out. If you’re lucky, everything will work as before.

This is the obvious way to design 
a keyboard switch, but it’s not a 
good idea. People pound on keys 
at times, and with this design, the 
switch contacts are forced to 
endure the entire impact. Over 
time, the contacts deform and 
start to malfunction.
This is a better way to design a keyboard 
switch. No matter how hard you pound on 
the keyboard, the force on the contacts is 
only that of the springs that support them. 
The key impact force is absorbed by the 
base plate, not the contacts.

and debris.
Don’t ever disconnect or reconnect a PS2 keyboard with the power on
(USB is designed to make that okay, however). It’s not dangerous to you,
but it could be lethal to your computer. We once ﬁxed a computer that had
been the victim of half a dozen disconnect/reconnect cycles in reasonably
close succession. The owner reported the machine had been operational
until the keyboard became erratic after being unplugged. After several
cycles it had started showing keyboard errors on boot, then more severe
boot errors, and then went completely dead. Our testing showed the moth-
erboard was completely inoperative. Because it was an older machine, the
parts necessary to restore operation included a motherboard, processor,
and memory.
People are often picky about the feel of their keyboards. Some like a distinct
click and tactile feedback, while others like soft resistance and a quiet key-
board. Springs and cams in the switches determine what the keyboard feels
like and are not something you can adjust. Try out any keyboard you’re inter-
ested in before you buy it to make sure it is one you’re willing to live with.

Chapter 18 ✦Keyboards and Game Controllers 291
Keyboard Controllers and Key Matrices
Your keyboard has a simple interface into the computer: Each key press and key
release results in a transmission from the keyboard that sends a code stating
what happened. The switches themselves can’t do that. They can only open or
close a single connection.
The ﬁgure in this sidebar shows how a small microprocessor in the keyboard
(called the keyboard controller) translates switch closings into the codes your
computer expects to see. Every key switch uniquely connects a pair of wires that
are part of a horizontal/vertical grid. The keyboard controller ﬁnds out which
switches are pushed down (closed) by looking at pairs of scan lines. It starts on 
Continued

292 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals
Continued
the top horizontal scan line, and looks at each vertical scan line. Every connec-
tion is noted. The controller then moves to the second horizontal line, and
again checks every vertical scan. It repeats this process until it has looked at all
combinations of horizontal and vertical scan lines. The code representing the
most recently pressed key gets reported to the computer when the key is
pushed.
The keyboard controller polls the scan lines looking for key pushes.
The keyboard controller has another critical job, which is to eliminate bounce
from the key switch contacts coming together or opening up. The key con-
tacts are springs, and like any other springs, bounce a little when they strike
or move away from another surface. This bouncing looks like multiple con-
nections and disconnections at the speeds computers run, but it occurs in far
less time than you could actually move the key. The controller exploits that
timing to decide if a contact opening or closing is something you did or a
bounce — if it happens a few milliseconds after the last one, it’s a bounce;
otherwise, it’s you.
The keyboard controller’s other job is to turn on the light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
on the keyboard — the ones for Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock — in
response to messages sent by the computer.
There are other ways to build keyboards than with switches. One way is to
include conductive membranes separated by an insulator with holes in it.
Membrane keyboards are used to withstand corrosive atmospheres and avoid
generating sparks, but they are less common in conventional systems.

Every switch in a keyboard connects between vertical and 
horizontal scan lines (wires) and a horizontal/vertical intersection, 
so each switch is uniquely addressed by a horizontal/vertical pair.

Keyboard layouts
Most keyboards use the standard QWERTY (or Sholes) key layout, meaning
that the alphabetic keys are arranged in the following pattern:
QWERT
YUIOP
ASDFG
HJKL
ZXCVB
NM
The QWERTY keyboard layout was devised by Christopher Sholes early in the
development of manual typewriters, with the objective of moving common
pairs of keys away from each other to reduce jamming in those early mechani-
cal keyboards. It’s commonly reported that Sholes intended the QWERTY layout
design to slow typists down to prevent jamming, but some studies indicate that
QWERTY is at least as fast as other designs.
The most common alternative keyboard layout is the Dvorak keyboard,
designed by University of Washington professor August Dvorak and William
Dealey in 1936. The Dvorak layout uses the following pattern:
PY
FGCRL
AOEUI
DHTNS
QJKX
BMWVZ
The idea behind Dvorak’s keyboard is that it’s more efﬁcient to put the most-
used letters on the home row (the one where your ﬁngers rest when you’re not
typing), to set up the key patterns so that your strongest ﬁngers do most of
the work, and to divide the letters so that the workload is balanced between
your left and right hands. Dvorak International reports that in QWERTY, 31 per-
cent of typing is done on the home row, compared to 70 percent for Dvorak.
The Dvorak layout has 35 percent more right-hand reaches, 63 percent more
same-row reaches, 45 percent more alternate-hand reaches, and 37 percent
less ﬁnger travel. Other studies seem to show a smaller difference. Dvorak
International further notes that Sholes himself devised another layout after
mechanisms improved, but it never caught on.
Ergonomics and repetitive stress
If you type at all quickly, you can easily perform thousands of repetitive
motions in a single hour of typing. Many sources, including the United States
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, state that such work can
contribute to repetitive strain injury. Most authorities recommend the follow-
ing preventative measures:
✦Placing equipment — It’s crucial that your equipment is designed
and arranged so that you can maintain good posture, with all parts of
your body in the proper position.
Chapter 18 ✦Keyboards and Game Controllers 293

✦Taking breaks — Periodically changing what you are doing to some-
thing other than working at your computer is important. Short, rela-
tively frequent breaks are worthwhile, particularly if you can stretch
a little at the time. The point isn’t that you have to stop working;
rather, it’s to recommend that you do other things besides work at
your computer from time to time in order to give your body a restful
change of position.
✦Knowing what to look for — If you do develop a problem, you’re
much better off dealing with it before it becomes severe. Speciﬁc
symptoms may arise in a number of ways, including tingling in the
ﬁngers; fatigue, numbness, and aching in the wrist and hand; and
eventually severe pain in the wrist and hand. In a larger sense,
though, if working at your computer leaves you sore and uncomfort-
able, you need to attend to the discomfort before it becomes serious.
Not all experts agree that typing causes repetitive strain injury. However, a
large majority of authorities assert long-term or frequent use of a keyboard can
cause problems. This is a medical issue, so if you experience pain or unusual
discomfort from typing at a computer, you should consult a medical authority
for information, diagnosis, and treatment.
Prevention is your best response to repetitive stress injury. Avoid the problem
in the ﬁrst place. Setting up your workplace so you maintain good posture is
your ﬁrst step. Here’s what to do:
✦Table and chair height — The relative height of your keyboard and
chair should be adjusted so that, with your hands on the keyboard,
your arms and legs are horizontal, and your back vertical.
✦Wrist angle — The table and seat height should combine so that
your hands rest on the keyboard with your wrists straight, not
angled either up or down. If the keyboard is too high, you’ll have to
bend your hands down; if too low, you’ll have to bend them up. Both
positions are bad.
The newer split keyboard design lets you keep your wrists straight
by angling the rows of keys so that you don’t have to cant your
hands outward to line up with straight rows of keys. Many of these
units also have a support that will raise the front of the keyboard to
eliminate any requirement to angle your hands upward. Whether you
use a support like that depends on your workstation. Your goal is to
keep your wrists comfortably straight.
✦Elbow angle — You can adjust either the table or chair height to 
get your arms parallel to the ﬂoor. Whichever you do, your position
needs to be relaxed and comfortable. At the same time, you’re better
off sitting straight with good back support, and with your feet ﬂat on
the ﬂoor.

board and mouse combination providing a split keyboard, wireless connec-
tions to eliminate cables and untether you from the computer itself, and

specialized keys you can dedicate to common functions such as reading e-mail
or opening a Web browser. A small receiver plugs into the USB or PS2 key-
board and mouse connectors at the back of your computer. Batteries power
the keyboard and mouse, with an expected lifetime of about three months.

board design and wireless connections to eliminate cable constraints.

If you do choose a wireless keyboard or mouse, however, be sure to consider
the possibility of interference from other nearby devices. Some manufacturers
have failed to design their products to operate in an environment where multi-
ple units are in close proximity, leading to both problems where either the
peripherals don’t work or inputs from one set of devices are received on other,
unintended computers.
There’s no consensus on the best furniture and equipment, or on the value of
split keyboards, wrist rests, and other products, but there’s a lot of information
available on this topic on the Internet. Search using keywords like repetitive
stress keyboard, or go directly to sites focusing on the problem. One excellent
starting point is “The Typing Injury FAQ” (Frequently Asked Questions) by Dan
Wallach at www.tifaq.com. This site addresses a wide range of issues and pro-
vides pointers to many other resources on the Internet.
Another key step in preventing a repetitive stress problem is to give yourself the
opportunity to recover. Many sources suggest you break up your typing with
frequent rest breaks, taking at least a one-minute break every 20 minutes or 5
to 15 minutes every hour. You can have your computer remind you to take breaks
using software such as WorkPace (Niche Software, Ltd., at www.workpace.com),
which combines education on exercises and stretching with monitoring and
reminders to take breaks.
Chapter 18 ✦Keyboards and Game Controllers 295

Impaired access
Beyond the facilities built directly into Windows, a large variety of products
and accessories are designed to facilitate ease of input from your ﬁngers to
your computer (for example, see the links at www.emr.org/linksA.html). 
In addition to alternative keyboard physical layouts, software is available that
is intended to simplify or accelerate your rate of typing. Few of these have
achieved widespread acceptance, perhaps because it’s difﬁcult to tailor them
for the wide range of things any one person may do with a computer. Even an
accessory as generic as the macro recorder — a program that could turn a
keystroke into an entire sequence of key and mouse operations — was so
unused that Microsoft removed it from Windows starting with Windows 95.
One important issue regarding computer keyboards is making them usable by
people with impaired mobility. Typing on the usual grid of closely spaced keys
is difﬁcult without reasonably precise accuracy, and more difﬁcult yet for peo-
ple who need to use a typing stick. The close proximity of the keycaps and 
the ease with which you can hit the wrong key (or multiple keys) increase the
error rate, requiring yet more keystrokes to correct. It can be difﬁcult to reach
the keys with your hands, and impossible with a mouth stick. Maltron
(www.maltron.com) makes a keyboard for these users with the key layout
optimized for distance, not two-handed typing. Using conventional keycaps —
not larger or smaller ones — the span of the keys from left to right on the key-
board is a mere nine inches.
Game Controllers
Devices specialized for the motions you need to make playing video games,
collectively called game controllers, are a big business because what you need
to do to control a game often requires different gestures than you make surﬁng
the Web or writing a report, and because in many games a split-second faster
response is the difference between winning and losing. The controller giving
you the best advantage is a matter of both personal preference and the type 
of game you’re playing:
✦First and third person shooters — Shooters are games where you
attack enemies from the player’s point of view (ﬁrst person) or a
point of view over the player’s shoulder (third person), typiﬁed by
games such as Quake, Halo, Half-Life, and Unreal Tournament. The
best players consistently use a keyboard and mouse for shooters,
using the mouse to shoot and look around the environment, and the
keyboard to move and control other game functions. Other con-
trollers have reached the market, but none have achieved close to
the dominance of the keyboard/mouse combination.
✦Flight simulators — Flight simulators let players take control of air-
planes and spacecraft, so joysticks — controls similar to what actual
pilots use — are often preferred.
296 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals

✦Driving simulators — Automotive racing games beneﬁt from steering
wheels, which sometimes include foot pedals for accelerating and
braking. Wheels work for watercraft and motorcycles, too, although 
if you spend much time in arcades, you’ve seen actual motorcycle
replicas built to let players lean into curves.
✦Other — Game consoles typically have a game pad with small joy-
sticks and many buttons and have shown these controllers to be use-
ful with virtually all game types.
Joysticks
It used to be that joysticks were connected to your PC with an analog interface
(see Figure 18-4) tied to some specialized circuitry usually found on the sound
card. The handle on an analog joystick was pivoted at the bottom, rotating on
the shafts of a pair of variable resistors. When you moved the handle, the shafts
rotated and changed the value of the resistors. The computer measured this
resistance change periodically and calculated the corresponding left/right and
forward/backward positions.
Figure 18-4: A joystick attaches variable resistors to a pivot, letting the computer
measure the angle of deﬂection in two directions.
The problem with this approach, which was used in nearly every joystick
made, was that getting an accurate, repeatable measurement took a relatively
long time, and during that interval the processor couldn’t do anything else,
including updating the screen, playing sound, or calculating. Ultimately, the
smoothness of movement suffered in highly interactive software.

Chapter 18 ✦Keyboards and Game Controllers 297

Joystick technology has evolved a lot in the last few years. Digital joysticks, typi-
cally connected to a USB port, replaced the variable resistors in analog joysticks
with digital optical position encoders, allowing your computer to simply be told
the stick position. Digital joysticks are quick and accurate, leading to smoother
game play and better responsiveness. Force feedback joysticks exploited the fact
that the digital interface can send information from the computer as well as to it,
adding motors that are commanded by the computer to push against your hand
through the stick. The Logitech Freedom 2.4 Cordless Joystick (see Figure 18-5)
is representative, using a wireless connection between the joystick and a small
receiver connected to a USB port. The digital interface makes a lot more
switches, buttons, and sliders available, too, putting more functions in reach
without resorting to the keyboard. The wireless link is particularly nice for get-
ting a little distance away from your big-screen TV, or for avoiding sweeping
things off your desk when you put too much body English on a move.

Game pads
Dedicated game consoles, such as the Sony PlayStation or Sega Dreamcast, use
a specialized controller, called a game pad, for input. Game pads typically have
a directional button capable of sensing input in one of eight directions, a pair
of joysticks, and a generous complement of buttons. Individual games assign
speciﬁc functions to most or all of the inputs.
Even though the controls on a game pad don’t mimic controls you commonly
use, as does a racing wheel, they’ve become ingrained in the user interface of
many role-playing and ﬁghting games and seem most natural to players accus-
tomed to that interface. The Logitech Cordless RumblePad (see Figure 18-6)
provides that standard interface, combining it with a wireless link and USB
connection for the receiver. The end result is that ports of console games to
the PC, along with PC titles themselves, can deliver the same enjoyable experi-
ence as on a dedicated console.
Figure 18-6: The Logitech Cordless RumblePad duplicates the familiar game 
console interface on PCs.

Wheels
Games bring perhaps the most unique environments to PCs, so it’s predictable
that games would lead to the development of specialized controllers. Two of
the most popular game-speciﬁc controllers are steering wheels (and pedals)
for driving games and game pads for ﬁghting and other games imported from
dedicated game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation 2 or Microsoft Xbox.
Figure 18-7 shows the Logitech Formula Force GP wheel. You mount the wheel
to the top of a table, in front of your monitor, and put the pedals on the ﬂoor.
The wheel connects to a USB port and controls your race car the way you’d
expect — turn left to go left, turn right to go right. Press the right pedal to
accelerate, the left to brake. Force feedback from the game through the wheel
gives you a feel for the road.

nitially, a well-equipped personal computer had a dis-
play, keyboard, and printer. The display gave you 25
by 80 characters, so moving the cursor from character
to character by pushing keys was reasonable. Life was
simple enough that you didn’t need a pointing device.
Life changed to put a lot more on the screen, however,
and to put it onscreen using high-resolution graphics.
It’s impractical to point at things on a graphics screen
by moving a pointer with the keyboard, so new technol-
ogy was required. Pioneering work by Doug Englebart 
at Stanford Research Institute in 1963 created what we
now call the mouse (along with the On-Line System and
some incredibly innovative ideas), and enabled the
pointing motions we all use in the graphical Windows
(and UNIX X Window) interface. Development by
Microsoft, Logitech, and other companies made the
mouse the most common pointing device on personal
computers, and as essential as a keyboard. Competitive
devices such as trackballs and touch-sensitive pads
have ﬂourished, but are nowhere as prevalent as mice.
This chapter speciﬁcally addresses pointing
devices. For information on keyboards or other
types of input devices, look in Chapter 18.
With the exception of the importance of rock-solid driv-
ers, the most important thing to keep in mind about
input devices is that there is an enormous number of
them, each suited to some things more than others.
This means that you can use a single one for everything,
or you can have specialized controllers each suited for
a speciﬁc task. A mouse is the most common input
device, and applicable to nearly everything you do with
your computer. A lot of people choose trackballs

instead of mice, so you’ll want to check that alternative for a general-purpose
pointing device. If you’re doing artistic or drawing work, you’re probably famil-
iar with tablets and will deﬁnitely want to consider one. It’s simply faster and
easier to draw with one.
Mice
Mice contain two kinds of input electronics. One part of the mouse detects move-
ment and reports it, while the other part detects button activity and reports that.
Switches (the buttons) are no problem; the trick is to convert movement into
electrical signals the computer can understand. The most reliable mice now use
optical sensors, but for decades nearly all PC mice used a mechanical ball. Figure
19-1 shows how a mechanical mouse works — the ball turns rollers inside the
body of the mouse, which themselves turn digitizers to separate out and sepa-
rately measure the left/right and forward/backward motion.
302 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals
Your Word Processor Is a 30-Year-Old Idea
For all of the power and features in the best word processors we have today,
many of the features they implement are decades old. In addition to inventing
(and patenting) the mouse, Doug Englebart created something called the On-
Line System (NLS) while at Stanford Research Institute, publicly demonstrating it
in 1968. The primitive terminals of the day couldn’t support the interactions
Englebart designed for NLS, so he invented a completely new terminal. In addi-
tion to the mouse, his terminal included a redesigned keyboard and a ﬁve-paddle
device that you played chords on to type letters (think of a ﬁve-key, one-handed
piano). Using the mouse with one hand and playing chords with the other, an
experienced user could control the system and edit text surprisingly quickly. The
combination of mouse and chords allowed operation without continually mov-
ing from keyboard to mouse and back, a problem we haven’t eliminated in
today’s systems.
Unlike today’s PC software that, until Windows 9x (and X Window under UNIX),
rarely used the second mouse button, Englebart’s mouse had three buttons that
were all used by NLS, as were all the combinations of mouse buttons. His soft-
ware allowed a seemingly inﬁnite set of views into your documents, foreshad-
owing the relatively simplistic outline views in today’s word processors. Running
on a Digital Equipment Corporation mainframe (a PDP-10), NLS included spell
checkers, text styles, group collaboration, and much more. In fact, it included so
many features that — like many of today’s word processors — it required some
intensive training and practice to use competently.
Like many other people, we have word processors that we like and ones that we
detest. NLS was one of the ones we really liked. NLS never made the transition
from the Digital Equipment Corporation mainframes Englebart used to PCs,
though, so only its concepts remain alive.

Figure 19-1: Your mouse is really two independent devices — one that reports 
motion and one that reports button actions.
Mechanical mice tend to ingest all matter of junk from your desktop, so they
require periodic cleaning, and cleaning the internal rollers can be difﬁcult.
Mechanical mice are prone to picking up dirt and debris off your desk, and
both gum and particulates from smoke from the air. When this happens, the
garbage from your desk often gets wound around the rollers and stops them
from rolling. That leads to “bumps” in the mouse movement or to situations
where the mouse simply stops moving in one direction. If that happens to you,
you’ll need to clean the insides of the mouse. There’s usually a panel that
rotates and lifts off the bottom of the mouse, allowing you to remove the ball.
Once you do, you can gently rotate the rollers and remove the dirt and lint.
Don’t use oil or grease in the mouse — it’ll just attract more dirt.
Optical mice replace all the moving parts in the motion sensing assembly with
a small image sensor — a camera — and enough processing to ﬁgure out which
way the mouse has moved from one picture to the next (see Figure 19-2).
Optical mice use motion detection algorithms, not unlike the motion compen-
sation algorithms used in MPEG 2 video compression, to see motion in an image
as you move the mouse across your desktop.
Be the mouse optical or mechanical, the motion reports it sends your computer
don’t contain absolute position information because the mouse has no idea
where it is on your desk. Instead, the mouse reports that it’s moved a speciﬁed
distance, measured in units called mickeys. One mickey is the least movement
that the roller and digitizer can detect. In the ﬁrst Microsoft mice, one mickey
was about one one-hundredth of an inch. The newer ones improved this resolu-
tion down to about one two-hundredth, and later to one four-hundredth of an
inch. Every time the mouse sends a message to the computer, it reports the
number of mickeys it has moved since the last message. Mickeys are reported

independently for each direction, and are used by your computer to update the
mouse cursor position onscreen.
Mouse buttons are simply reported to the processor as being up or down.
Mice had from one to three buttons, in part because Windows internally had
provisions for left, middle, and right buttons, but now can include at least ﬁve
buttons, thumbwheels, and more.
Figure 19-2: An optical mouse measures movement from one image to the next.
Mouse cursors
A key part of your mouse isn’t hardware at all — it’s the cursor the computer
draws on the screen to show you where you’re pointing. There’s no direct con-
nection between your mouse and the cursor position. Instead, Windows uses
the movement reports from the mouse to update the horizontal and vertical
position where it thinks the cursor should appear, erases the old drawing of
the cursor, and draws the cursor again at the new position.
The mouse cursor also gets erased and redrawn by Windows every time a pro-
gram draws on the screen near the mouse. (You can see this effect by starting
a video clip — an AVI, MPG, or MOV ﬁle — in Windows and then moving the
mouse cursor over the video playback window. Unless your video card has
special hardware for handling cursors, you’ll see the cursor ﬂicker on and off
or possibly disappear entirely until the video stops.)
Microsoft Intellimouse
We consider the Microsoft mice, in any of their serial, PS/2, or USB versions, the
standard of comparison for all other mice, primarily because of the stability of
the Microsoft mouse drivers and the durability of the units (see Figure 19-3).
We’ve also found the Logitech mice to be as well made. We’re fanatic about
driver quality. Creating drivers is some of the most difﬁcult programming peo-
ple do, and many companies have demonstrated their inability to get them

right. When you can, it’s the safe alternative to buy a product that’s completely
compatible with the Microsoft mouse and uses the Microsoft driver. If you can’t
do that, make sure of the quality of the drivers from the manufacturer you
choose. We very much doubt you’ll be happy about saving a few dollars after
you discover that the source of your crashes has been a buggy driver.
The Microsoft mouse had always been a two-button unit until 1996, when
Microsoft announced the Intellimouse — a new design that added the wheel
you see between the two buttons in Figure 19-3. The wheel combines with
changes introduced with Windows 98 and Windows 2000 to simplify scrolling
and zooming in documents, reducing the number of times you have to move
your hand from mouse to keyboard.
The interface you choose for your mouse depends on your system and the
other equipment you expect to use. The Universal Serial Bus is now common-
place, augmenting the more traditional choices you have:
✦Serial ports — Serial port mice are almost extinct, replaced ﬁrst by
PS2 mice and now by USB mice.
✦PS/2 mouse port — This is essentially a serial port, but at a different
I/O address and with a different IRQ. The interface is a dedicated
Chapter 19 ✦Mice, Trackballs, and Tablets 305
Feeding Your Mouse
A serial port on a PC conforms to the Electronic Industries Association RS-232C
standard, which deﬁnes both the electrical properties of signals at the port and
the way in which those signals are used. The RS-232C port of your PC uses volt-
ages to indicate logical states: a one bit is signaled by –3 V to –15 V on a pin,
while a zero is signaled by +3 V to +15 V. Plus and minus 12 V are typical.
None of the pins in an RS-232C port were intended to deliver power. When
Microsoft developed the serial mouse, though, they noticed that the typical out-
put line in an RS-232C port could supply a little bit of power — around ﬁve hun-
dredths of a watt. By using very low power electronics (and very little electronics
at all), they could keep power consumption below that limit and run the mouse
completely off the port.
That observation, and the engineering behind it, was a big part of making mice
a part of every computer. Eliminating the mouse card that had to go inside the
computer reduced cost and, perhaps more importantly, simpliﬁed installation.
No screws to remove, no slots to ﬁnd, no conﬂicts to solve. Plug it in and go.
Since then, electronics have become smaller, doing more in the same space and
requiring less power. You can get cordless mice and keyboards today that use
radio to communicate with your computer rather than the wire you’re used to.
By combining wireless links with gyroscopes or tilt sensors, companies have built
“air mice” — mice that you simply hold in your hand wherever you happen to be.
An air mouse is, for some people, a key element of a workable computer-based
presentation system. (For others, an air mouse can be completely confusing.
Rehearse with one before doing a live presentation.)

port that doesn’t consume a serial port and is pre-conﬁgured for
mouse support. If you have a PS/2 port on your motherboard, it’s 
a better choice than using a serial port because you don’t use up a
port you could use for some other purpose.
✦USB mouse — Like the PS/2 mouse port, a USB mouse port leaves
the serial port free for other uses. If you use a USB mouse, make sure
the BIOS in your computer offers Legacy USB Support, which means
that it can make the USB mouse look like a conventional serial mouse
for operation with the BIOS itself. You may have to explicitly enable
the Legacy USB Support feature. Hard-core gamers have another rea-
son, beyond convenience, to move to USB mice — fast reaction game
response. Your computer gets updates from a USB mouse nearly
twice as often as from a PS/2 mouse, leading to smoother, more
responsive play at expert levels.

Trackballs
One of the most common alternatives to a mouse is a trackball, which is basi-
cally a mechanical mouse turned upside down (although optical trackballs
exist that use optical sensors to detect rotation of the ball). You rotate the ball
directly while the body stays put. Figure 19-4 is a typical trackball, the Logitech
Cordless Optical TrackMan.
306 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals

Trackballs solve three problems inherent to mice:
✦Space — Only the ball moves in a trackball, not the body. By compar-
ison, mice take space to operate (and even then, you’ll end up pick-
ing up the mouse and moving it back on the desk when you run out
of room). In some situations — a computer built into a rack of equip-
ment, or most of the airline seats you’ll ﬁnd — you don’t have that
kind of space.
✦Staying put — You can attach a trackball securely to a computer
or shelf so it stays in one place. By comparison, a mouse won’t
stay where you left it if it’s being bounced around. Airline seats 
are like that, but so are boats, cars, and most any other moving
platform.
✦Fine control — The buttons on a trackball aren’t physically cou-
pled to the ball like they are by the body of a mouse. People tend 
to move a mouse a pixel or two when they push one of the buttons.
If you’re doing drawings or other very ﬁne work, that motion can
destroy the precision you need. You won’t have that problem with 
a trackball.
Unfortunately, trackballs have problems of their own, most prominent of
which is that your hand is always moving relative to the buttons, and you
may have to stretch quite a bit to reach the button you want. If you need to
hold the button down while you rotate the ball, this can turn into the com-
puter equivalent of patting your stomach while you rub your head. This prob-
lem has lead more than a few trackball manufacturers to add buttons to their
products that latch down when pushed, telling the computer they’re down
until you push them again and making it easier to drag the mouse cursor
while a button appears to be down. Movements like that are essential for the
drag-and-drop functions built into Windows and Linux. Some people never get
comfortable with a trackball, ﬁnding the movements awkward, while others
are fanatic about them.
Chapter 19 ✦Mice, Trackballs, and Tablets 307

Tablets
Yet another pointing device is the tablet, a ﬂat surface on which you can write,
draw, and trace. Tablets come in a range of sizes, from card-sized through units
several feet on a side. You can get ones with a corded or cordless stylus, and
ones with buttons and other controls.
The real advantage of a tablet is that it lets you use the drawing motions you’re
used to — the ﬁne arc around the heel of your palm and the stroke with your
elbow and shoulder. These motions are completely impossible with a trackball
or joystick, and unnatural and ineffective with a mouse. A tablet is the closest
computer approximation to a sketchpad, and so is commonly found in the
hands of artists.
While mice typically have resolutions of 400 points per inch or less, most
tablets have a resolution of at least 1,000 lines per inch. A 5-inch wide tablet
provides at least 5,000 lines of resolution, and for some tablets gives you as
many as 12,700 lines. This is far beyond PC monitor display screen capabilities,
and similar to the resolution of a printer for the entire page.
Not all software handles tablets equally well, so you’ll want to check and see
whether the tablet has drivers for the software you plan to use. You should
check what functions the software and driver support. Many tablets come bun-
dled with drawing software. If you choose one of those, check to see whether
the software does the things you need.
Some of the companies that make tablets (such as Wacom) also build their 
digitizers into transparent surfaces you can use as a touch screen. When the
user touches the screen, it sends a set of coordinates to the computer that
your program can correlate to areas of the screen.
Wacom has long been the best known manufacturer of graphics tablets. The
company has a range of products depending on what you do with a tablet.
Figure 19-5 is their Graphire3 tablet (www.wacom.com/graphire/index.cfm)
that combines a USB interface, high resolution, a pressure sensitive battery-free
pen with eraser tool, and a cordless mouse. Buttons on the barrel of the stylus
let you select objects in your software or choose special drawing functions.
Wacom’s stylus has an “eraser” on the top, letting you use the pad even more
like you would a pencil and paper. The eraser has the same pressure-sensitive
capability as the tip, so you can use it for shading, feathering, and other artistic
effects.
Wacom also offers the Cintiq series tablets that combine a color LCD display
and tablet. It’s expensive even if you include the price of an LCD monitor, but
for some artistic work, the ability to draw on a digital image is worth the cost.

Top Support Questions
Most of the problems you see with pointing devices are a result of underlying
problems with serial ports or driver software. Using dedicated PS/2 mouse
ports or USB connections and staying with the drivers that come with your
operating system (rather than those from third parties) can help eliminate
most of these problems.
Mouse
Q: My serial mouse isn’t detected by Plug and Play. Why?
A: Check if you’re using an adapter to connect a 9-pin serial mouse connector
to a 25-pin serial port. If so, it’s possible that some lines in the 9-pin connector
required by Plug and Play aren’t being bridged to the 25-pin connector. Try
using a 9-pin port, a different connector that you know bridges all 9 signals, 
or a manual installation of your mouse via Add New Hardware.
Chapter 19 ✦Mice, Trackballs, and Tablets 309

Q: My mouse doesn’t respond to double-clicks. Why?
A: If you can, try another mouse. If that works, the original mouse is probably
defective. If the second mouse doesn’t work either, check the speed setting for
double-clicks. If it’s set too high, it may be looking for the second click faster
than you can push the button. Slow down the double-click setting and see
what happens.
Q: My mouse jumps across the screen, or moves in bursts. Why?
A: Check if your mouse is connected to a serial port using the 16550 chip. If so,
verify that the 16550 hardware functions are disabled for that port — that the
chip is functioning as an older 8250 chip. Your BIOS may label the setting you
need as turning on and off the FIFO (ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out) hardware buffer.
Q: My mouse stops going in one direction sometimes. If I move it away and
then back, it continues past the sticking point. Why?
A: You probably have dirt in the mouse (on the rollers) or on the mouse ball.
Remove the ball and check carefully for dirt, cleaning out any you ﬁnd.
Tablet
Q: In my system with a tablet and mouse, the mouse has gone berserk, moving
erratically and leaping across the screen. What’s wrong?
A: If you have a tablet installed, check that the stylus hasn’t accidentally come
near the surface of the tablet, creating unintentional mouse motion inputs to
your system.

he once promised paperless society hasn’t yet hap-
pened, despite radio, television, and computers.
You’ll ultimately need to get some part of what you do
with your computer onto paper. That means you’ll need
a printer.
Printers: Getting the Ink
(Only) Where It Belongs
Computer printers for personal computers started out
as adapted typewriters. Instead of being driven by a
keyboard (although some had them), they received
instructions from the computer. Operation notwith-
standing, they remained typewriters inside.
The point of a printer isn’t to be a typewriter, of course;
it’s to get ink on paper in just the right amount and in
just the right place. The same technology that created
the microprocessors that drive your computer created
smaller microprocessors that could be built into print-
ers. When that happened, designers discovered that
they could abandon the typewriter-based approach and
build printers based on the job that needed to be done.
When they started looking at how to do high-quality
graphics along with text, they noticed that copiers and
monitors (that is, raster-based devices) were a better
starting point. The result was the laser and ink jet print-
ers you have today.

Ink jet printers
Ink jet printers are really high-tech versions of the older dot-matrix printers,
which used small pins to impact a ribbon and make character images from a
rectangular matrix of dots. An ink jet printer cartridge squirts a matrix of dots
a row at a time, using an ink reservoir, some circuitry, and tiny nozzles down at
the bottom of the cartridge (see the side view in Figure 20-1):
✦Ink reservoir — The reservoir has to ensure a continuous, uninter-
rupted supply of ink to the drivers and nozzles. It has to prevent
sloshing and foaming as the head moves. The ink composition is very
important — it has to ﬂow smoothly out of the reservoir, not clog the
tiny holes in the impulse drivers and nozzles, have enough surface
tension to avoid smearing as it is ejected from the nozzle, dry soon
enough to maintain the image, and avoid wicking out on the paper
ﬁbers (which would make the image fuzzy).
Figure 20-1: An ink jet cartridge 
contains all the high-precision parts of 
an ink jet printer in a disposable unit.
✦Interface circuit and impulse drivers — The printer electronics
command the driver behind each nozzle independently, so in a high-
resolution printer, you ﬁnd a lot of separate circuits. Each is termi-
nated at a connecting point on the side of the cartridge that lines up
with a corresponding pin on the print head. The interface circuit (a
ﬂexible printed circuit) routes these signals down to the impulse
drivers and nozzles at the bottom of the cartridge.
When activated, the impulse drivers force a small drop of ink
through the nozzle (one below each driver) and onto the paper that’s
in contact with the head. Impulse drivers work in two ways. Some

companies use a small piezoelectric crystal (one that expands when
hit with an electrical impulse); others use a small ball of vapor pro-
duced by heating a pocket of ink. Figure 20-2 shows the effect of the
driver — forcing a small, precisely measured drop of ink down
through the nozzle and onto the paper.
Figure 20-2: The impulse drivers create small bubbles, forcing drops of 
ink out from the nozzles.
The operation of the drivers and nozzles is shown by comparing the
leftmost nozzle in Figure 20-2 with the one next to it. In the leftmost
nozzle, the driver isn’t activated, so the surface tension of the ink
keeps it conﬁned to the nozzle. In the next nozzle, the driver has acti-
vated, ejecting the ink out of the nozzle and onto the paper.
✦Nozzles — The nozzles establish the precise position of the dots rela-
tive to one another and form the physical interface between the print
cartridge and the paper.
The print head positions the cartridge laterally along the paper. The nozzle
spacing positions the dots the printer puts on the paper perpendicularly to the
head movement, while the printer electronics time the signals sent to the car-
tridge with the head motion to position the dots laterally. The net result is that
ink jet printers — the modern version of the old dot matrix technology — can
today achieve a resolution of 2,400×1,200 dots per inch, a resolution competi-
tive with laser printers.
It’s relatively straightforward to create a color ink jet printer — you simply have
three or four heads (using the CMY or CMYK color model; see the “Scanners”
section later in this chapter for information on color models) and carefully
track the relative position of the heads among one another. Color ink jet print-
ers often use one or two cartridges to do this, with cyan, magenta, and yellow
in one and (optionally) black in the other. Some color ink jets use four separate
cartridges, one per color.

When there are multiple cartridges, a calibration process is required to make
sure they are physically lined up. Typically, the printer will output a set of test
patterns, requiring you to select the speciﬁc pattern that has the best alignment.
You can recycle ink jet cartridges. Details for Canon cartridges are on the Web at
www.ereturn.usa.canon.com. Recycling details for Hewlett Packard cartridges
are at www.hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/environment/recycle/
index.html and government.hp.com/products_planetpartner.asp.
Laser printers
Laser printers use ﬁne, dry ink particles (called toner) to create an image on
paper. This is the same process used in copiers. The key laser printer compo-
nents are shown in Figure 20-3. The process starts at the point between the
charging roller and the photoconductor drum. The charging roller imposes 
an electrical charge on the drum, which causes it to repel the toner particles.
The drum rotates under the laser (which sweeps back and forth in lines), and
everywhere the laser illuminates the drum, the charge dissipates. Those points
attract toner from the toner roller — the laser effectively draws black and gray
areas on the drum. The drum continues to turn, bringing the patterned toner
image into contact with the paper. The transfer roller attracts the toner to the
paper, where it sticks. The combination of the fuser roller and the backup
roller heat the toner, bonding it to the paper and making a permanent image.
Figure 20-3: The laser writes onto the photoconductor drum where 
the image should be dark, allowing the drum to pick up black toner 
particles.

The laser is under the control of the raster processor in the printer, which has
the responsibility of turning the codes sent from your computer into a bitmap
of the image to appear on the page.
The same arithmetic — counting pixels — that causes your video card to 
need a lot of memory causes your printer to need memory as well. The raster
processor generally can’t keep up with the photoconductor drum as it rotates,
and the drum can’t stop in the middle of a page (because the image would end
up distorted). That means that the entire image has to be in memory when the
drum starts to rotate to print the page. If we assume quarter-inch margins and
multiply out the number of pixels on a page at 600 dots per inch (a typical
laser printer resolution), we ﬁnd that we have nearly 32 million dots on an
8.5×11-inch page. If each pixel takes one bit in memory, we need nearly 4MB to
hold the entire page (more if we’re storing fonts as well).
Printers that enhance the apparent resolution of the image by controlling the
darkness of each dot may require even more memory — if the printer can
store four levels of intensity per dot, it needs nearly 8MB. Many printers are
starting to compress the raster image in memory, decompressing it on the ﬂy
as the laser scans the page. Using lossless compression, this technique can
reduce memory requirements by a factor of 1.5 or 2 to 1 or more.
You can get laser toner in different colors besides black (even for a black-and-
white printer). Color laser printers use four sets of toner to create the image, typi-
cally making four passes around the photoconductor drum (one for each color)
before imprinting the image on the paper. Because the image has to be rasterized
separately for each color, the printer’s memory requirements go up drastically.
It’s not unusual to require 32MB in a color laser printer (which, along with the
more complex mechanism and lower sales volume, is why they’re expensive).
Page description languages
Now that you have the means to put images where you want them on paper, you
need a way for your computer to tell the printer what to do. Think back to how
typewriters worked to get an idea of what you need to do with your printer:
✦Characters — For the most part, what you did with a typewriter was
print characters. The typewriter automatically moved from one char-
acter to the next, spacing them apart so the resulting text looked right.
✦Positioning — You deﬁned where you wanted the characters on the
page by moving the paper around in the typewriter. You could scroll
the paper up and down and move the print head back and forth.
✦Margins — You set margins with stops on the body of the typewriter
that limited the travel of the carriage. By coordinating the stops with
how you registered the paper in the carriage, you established the
margins where you wanted them on both the left and right sides of
the paper.
✦Font — Daisy wheel and golf ball typewriters let you change the font
you typed by changing the print element. You had to reach into the
typewriter, remove the old one, and put in the new one.
Chapter 20 ✦Printers, Scanners, and All-in-One Units 315

Early personal computer printers did basically these same four things based
on codes sent from the computer. Characters were sent as is, while the other
functions were indicated by special codes. The codes for printers from differ-
ent manufacturers were incompatible with each other, and each program had a
different set of printer drivers with those codes embedded. Worse, only print-
ers with tractor feeds (mechanisms that engaged the holes in tear-off strips at
the edge of the paper) could reliably move the paper backward as well as for-
ward, so most printers required that programs send commands in order from
top to bottom of the page.
As software became more capable — word processors, presentation graphics,
and page layout programs in particular — the mess surrounding printer con-
trol sequences became impractical. WordPerfect had a different set of drivers
than Microsoft Word, both of which had different drivers than other programs.
If you bought a new printer, you had to get new drivers from each of your soft-
ware vendors. If a vendor hadn’t developed the driver yet, or chose not to, you
had a problem. The software vendors had a problem, as well, because each of
them had to invest a lot of money in creating and maintaining their printer
driver libraries.
Windows eliminated this problem because it provided a printer-independent
interface between software and the printers. That interface communicates
through a printer-speciﬁc driver, which translates drawing commands into
what’s called a page description language. Two page description languages
dominate the industry: PostScript (developed by Adobe) and PCL (developed
by Hewlett-Packard). PostScript was originally developed for use with the
Macintosh computers, but has migrated to PC systems. The two have roughly
equivalent capabilities — you’d typically only explicitly choose one versus the
other if compatibility at the page description language level were important for
communicating with an outside service bureau.
The printer drivers also support monitoring to let you see what printers are
doing. You can expect good printer monitoring software to help you do things
like:
✦Status and resource monitoring — You should be able to ﬁnd out if
the printer is jammed or ofﬂine; if it needs paper, toner, or other sup-
plies; and what job it’s currently working on.
✦Conﬁguration — Your printer management software should identify
all the options attached to the printer and how each is conﬁgured.
You should be able to remotely change the conﬁguration, download
fonts, and enable or disable options.
You’ll want to be able to control how your applications print, no matter if the
printer is local or remote. You should be able to control any aspect of the
printer, including at least the following:
✦Print density — You can control the overall darkness of the print. If
you do a whole lot of large drafts before printing a ﬁnal copy, turning
316 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals

down the print density can reduce your costs and boost print speed.
You can reset to best quality when you’re ready for the ﬁnal copy.
✦Color or grayscale — Color printers usually let you specify that the
print should be grayscale only, turning off the color inks and reduc-
ing costs.
✦Duplex — Some printers offer the option to print on both sides of
the paper, either by feeding the paper in twice or directly using a
more involved paper feed path. Either way, you should be able to
turn the duplex print on and off to ﬁt your immediate needs and you
should be able to specify whether you ﬂip the page over on the long
edge (like a book) or the short edge (like a tablet).
✦Graphics resolution — Printers can’t always reproduce as many col-
ors or grayscale tones as are in your images. In that case, the printer
simulates the shade by a process called halftoning, which involves
using a grid of mixed colors of dots that, viewed from a distance,
blend to simulate the color you want. The resolution of the halfton-
ing process is often controllable from the device driver and can be
set to relatively low resolution to conserve memory or speed print
times. In high-resolution printers, the halftone patterning should be
unnoticeable when the driver does ﬁne-grained processing.
Some printers offer more basic resolution control, allowing you to
use less than the maximum resolution on the printer, which you
might want to use if you’re after a quick print and don’t care what
the graphics look like.
✦Paper size — Most printers can accommodate a range of paper sizes,
from envelopes through legal and European sizes. You should be able
to specify the paper you’ve loaded to the driver; even better is if the
printer can automatically tell your computer what paper is loaded.
You should also be able to specify which way the print is oriented 
on the page (portrait is with the long way vertical, while landscape 
is with the long way horizontal). For printers with unprintable areas
(due to the paper feed mechanism, for example), you should be able
to control the size of this area.
✦Paper source — If your printer has several paper trays, or has a
manual feeder in addition to the paper tray, you should be able to
specify from where you want paper to feed.
✦Other options — You should be able to control all the other features
and speciﬁcations of your printer, such as informing Windows how
much memory is installed or if an optional paper tray is installed.
Choosing a printer
The basic issues in picking a printer are how much you print, whether you
need color, what print quality you need, and what price range you’re in.
Ignoring specialized applications like phototypesetting, high-volume label
Chapter 20 ✦Printers, Scanners, and All-in-One Units 317

printing, or form printers, the most likely choice is a color ink jet printer. If you
do light faxing, but don’t want to tie up a PC as a fax machine, consider an all-
in-one multifunction unit (see the section “All-in-One Units: Combining Printing,
Fax, and Copying,” later in this chapter). If your printing load is more than light
duty, consider a black-and-white or color laser printer.
Printers come with a variety of interfaces, including serial ports (that’s right —
another thing to connect to those two solitary ports), parallel ports, USB, and
network. Most printers used to connect to a parallel port, but USB connections
are now both nearly universal and far easier to work with. Network interfaces
are commonly 10/100Base-T.
With resolutions up to 1,200×1,200 dpi, the HP Deskjet 5850 color ink jet
printer (see Figure 20-4) is a high-resolution printer. It prints from 1 to 21 pages
per minute depending on mode and includes a duplex unit for printing on both
sides of the paper. USB, Ethernet, and IEEE 802.11b interfaces are standard.

Scanners
Scanners do a speciﬁc, direct thing — they convert a printed image into an
image in your computer. The image comes in as a bitmap — a rectangular array
of pixels — from the scanner itself, so it doesn’t matter if you’re scanning pic-
tures, text, or a combination of the two. The HP Scanjet 3970 (see Figure 20-6) 
is a typical one-pass color ﬂatbed scanner with a high-speed USB 2.0 interface
offering 48-bit color and 2,400×2,400 dpi optical resolution. The scanner is only
$20 more than HP’s Scanjet 3670, but offers double the optical resolution.
The essential characteristics of a scanner that deﬁne what kind of work you do
with it are these:
✦Mechanism — Scanners pass your image by a sensor. The mecha-
nism that creates that movement can be one of several types, affect-
ing the precision of the results you get and the price you’ll pay for
the scanner.
✦Number and accuracy of colors — A scanner resolves colors into
separate intensities for red, green, and blue. The number of bits for
each color channel determines the number of colors the scanner can
resolve, while the color calibration quality determines how accu-
rately the scanner renders images.
Chapter 20 ✦Printers, Scanners, and All-in-One Units 319

✦Resolution — As with a digital camera, a scanner turns your image
into a bitmap. The number of pixels per inch in the bitmap — the res-
olution of the scanner — determines the quality of what you’ll see on
your screen or printer, and affects the accuracy of converting scanned
text into characters.
✦Interface — Scanners come with a variety of electronic interfaces,
ranging from serial and parallel ports to USB. The interface you use
determines how fast the image can get into your computer, and
whether or not you have a suitable port on your computer.
✦Software — More so than many other devices, scanners require
application software to really be useful, to let you acquire, edit, crop,
publish, and convert images to text.
The next sections take a look at each one of these characteristics.

Mechanisms
Most digital still cameras use a rectangular sensor array so that they can cap-
ture the entire picture at one time. Scanners are different — they use a line
sensor in conjunction with a mechanism that sequentially moves the sensor
relative to the paper to capture the entire image. Scanners used to use a vari-
ety of mechanisms to move the sensor, but essentially all of them now hold 
the paper stationary on the scanner and move the sensor (inside the scanner)
past the paper, which is what’s called a ﬂatbed scanner. As long as the sensor
mount and drive mechanism are designed well, this approach results in pre-
cise, accurate scans. The ability to close a door over the document retains a
closed light environment during the scan, allowing the device to control expo-
sure to what the sensor needs.
320 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals

If you’re feeding stacks of paper into the scanner to scan successive pages,
you’ll want to consider a document feeder. These are most often accessories
for ﬂatbed scanners, usually holding 10 to 50 pages and supporting automatic
scanning once you start the operation. (High-end production scanners can
hold far more than this, and can scan far faster than the rates of the units dis-
cussed in this chapter.)
Number and accuracy of colors
Scanners report intensity for each of the red, green, and blue color channels.
Even inexpensive, low-end scanners now use 16 bits per pixel per color, so a
color scanner reports 48 bits per pixel (16 bits per color for each of three col-
ors). That means the color scanner can resolve to one of over 280 trillion col-
ors. A color scanner can give you better scans of black-and-white copy, too,
because it can be used to drop out colors. Suppose, for example, that you have
copy that’s become discolored. If you can set up your scanner to scan with
only one color, then choosing a color that drops out the discoloration helps to
clean up the image even before you attack it with image processing software.
However, the number of colors a scanner resolves is independent of its color
accuracy. Matching colors from scanner to screen to printer is notoriously dif-
ﬁcult. The ﬁrst time you scan a color image, you’re likely to be in for a nasty
shock — the piece of paper in your hand isn’t likely to look at all like what you
get onscreen, and neither one is likely to look like what comes out of your
color printer. About that time you’re going to understand exactly what that
odd phrase “color matching” is all about.
From a hardware perspective, it’s not at all surprising that you get differing
results — in fact, it’s nothing short of a miracle if you get matching colors with-
out doing anything to make that happen. All your devices have independent
calibrations, use different color technologies, and in some cases even repre-
sent colors using systems different from the red-green-blue system we’ve
talked about (see the sidebar “RGB, CMY, and Some Other Alphabet Soup”).
Most products don’t include options supporting color matching, largely
because there’s been no industry standard for how to do this. Windows 95
introduced Image Color Matching (ICM), but even now there’s been little
improvement in coordination among products.
Resolution
We sometimes think that scanners are a lot like used cars because there’s a
very peculiar sort of speciﬁcation that’s become common for them, and you
have to be careful that you know what you’re getting. Speciﬁcally, scanner
manufacturers report one or both of two different resolutions:
✦Raw, or optical, resolution — This is the actual resolution produced
by the scanner sensor, in dots per inch. As with monitors and print-
ers, scanners have both vertical and horizontal resolution, and the
two numbers don’t have to be the same.
Chapter 20 ✦Printers, Scanners, and All-in-One Units 321

✦Interpolated resolution — This is the speciﬁcation that may or may
not give you what you paid for. Many scanners process the scanned
image, doing the work either in the scanner or in your computer to
compute more pixels than you actually read off the scanner. They do it
by assuming that the change between one pixel and the next is linear.
Figures 20-7 and 20-8 show the problem interpolation can cause. In Figure 20-7,
the actual image changes smoothly, and so calculating the interpolated pixels
based on the linear assumption works well — the added pixels correspond
well to what’s in the image.
322 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals
RGB, CMY, and Some Other Alphabet Soup
It’s not practical for scanners, monitors, printers, or other devices to directly sam-
ple every possible color — there are just too many of them. Even your eyes don’t
(the red-green-blue, or RGB, color model is patterned after the response of your
eyes to color). Instead, all these devices use combinations of a few colors, just
as children do with ﬁnger paints.
So the question really is, why is there more than one color model?
The most obvious reason is that two sorts of color mixing exist — transmitted
light and reﬂected light. These basic mixing approaches are called additive and
subtractive mixing, respectively. See-through ﬁlters and color monitors use addi-
tive mixing, which corresponds well to the RGB model. When a color monitor has
to create yellow, it turns on both the blue and green pixels. The light from both
combines to form yellow.
Now, imagine a red ﬁlter with a light shining on it. If you’re on the opposite side
of the ﬁlter, you’ll see red light transmitted through the ﬁlter. This is the same
thing that ﬁlters in a color LCD screen do. If you stand on the other side of the
ﬁlter, though, you’ll see not the transmitted light, but the reﬂected light. The
green and blue light that doesn’t get transmitted through the ﬁlter gets reﬂected,
and that’s what you see. Those colors combine to form yellow, so if you look at
light reﬂected off a red ﬁlter, you’ll see yellow. This doesn’t work if you put white
paper behind the ﬁlter, since the red then reﬂects back through the ﬁlter and
becomes visible.
This effect — that a red ﬁlter reﬂects yellow light — happens because the reﬂected
light from the ﬁlter uses a subtractive mixing color model. Subtractive mixing is
also what happens with images printed on paper. The primary colors for a sub-
tractive model aren’t red, green, and blue; they’re cyan, magenta, and yellow
(CMY). It’s hard to get good, saturated colors with only cyan, magenta, and yel-
low, so printers use a fourth color — black — forming the CMYK color model.
CMYK creates better colors, but not ones as good as spot color models (such as
the Pantone Matching System) that mix more than four colors.
Video has yet other color models because some camera technologies work bet-
ter with color sets other than RGB and because different video compression
technologies work better in some color models than others.

Figure 20-7: Interpolation of smooth intensity or color changes
In Figure 20-8, however, the assumption is a poor one because the real image
has sharp edges the interpolator doesn’t know about. Because the interpola-
tor’s assumption is bad, the “increased resolution” from the scanner does you
no good because the calculated data is bogus. Your scanned image doesn’t
faithfully reproduce the actual image at the enhanced resolution. At the mini-
mum, you’ll want to be sure to ﬁnd out the raw resolution of the scanners
you’re looking at. If you can’t ﬁnd out, ﬁnd another scanner.

Interfaces
Scanners typically interface into your computer through a serial port, parallel
port, or USB port (see Table 20-1). Most scanners now use USB, which is fast,
reliable, and convenient.
Table 20-1

Page scan times in the 15- to 30-second range are common, with the time being
primarily determined by the rate the sensor traverses the image. For a 25MB
image, you’ll want a full speed USB 1.1 or high speed USB 2.0 interface because
anything else is going to be ridiculously slow. We prefer USB scanners because
they are easier to set up and less prone to conﬁguration problems than ones
using serial or parallel ports. For most people, USB is the ideal scanner interface.
Software
You need two kinds of software to use a scanner:
✦Driver — A device driver communicates with the scanner, issuing
commands and reading back data. Most scanners now use a control
interface called TWAIN, which serves as a standard way for any
image-processing program to acquire data from an image source.
TWAIN decouples speciﬁc knowledge of how to drive the scanner out
of the image-processing software, making the application programs
device independent.
✦Image processing — Beyond the device driver, you need a program
to (at least) initiate the scan, receive the image, and store it to disk.
Programs like that come with every scanner we’ve seen, and are now
built into Windows. If you want to do anything other than look at (and
possibly print) the image, you’ll need a more sophisticated program
that can adjust colors, crop, and otherwise manipulate the image.
324 Part VI ✦Multimedia and Peripherals

In addition, you may want software that can convert scanned text images to
text. That conversion process, called optical character recognition (OCR),
matches pieces of the image with guidelines for what each character looks like,
and outputs a “typed” document. The good OCR programs (such as those from
Caere) are not only accurate, they can help you deal with pages that have com-
binations of text and graphics, can accommodate text wrapped in columns
throughout the page, and can output the page in your word processor’s format
with the necessary control codes included to make the text look like what you
scanned.
All-in-One Units: Combining Printing,
Fax, and Copying
In a way, scanners, printers, fax machines, and copiers are all different ways to
shufﬂe the same set of components. If you have an imaging device, a modem,
and a printer, you can do all four functions.
If you buy all four devices separately, you’ve duplicated hardware and cost —
you’ve bought three scanners and three printers. You can attach a scanner,
modem, and printer separately to your computer and use software to get all
four functions. This works, and is a good solution for many situations. But it
requires you to be involved in copy and fax functions, for the most part,
involvement that can interrupt what you’re doing.
Instead of doing a lot of busy work, you have the option of choosing a combi-
nation piece of hardware, one that includes all these components. We’ll call
these products all-in-one machines for lack of a better term. (Some companies
call them multifunction devices, for example — the terminology isn’t much bet-
ter, is it?) All-in-one machines are basically fax machines (which is the most
complex function) that you can access as components from your computer
when you need to, and can leave running independently as a fax and copier.
The advantage of an all-in-one machine is that you can leave it running unat-
tended for fax and copier applications, even if your computer is turned off.
Incoming faxes don’t interrupt what you’re doing with your computer (but are
accessible from the computer for printing, OCR, and retransmission). You
won’t want to do heavy-duty copying with one, but it’s sufﬁcient for small jobs.
Memory in the device buffers between faxes and printing, so no matter what
goes on, you don’t have to wait to get control back at your computer, and a
print job won’t cause you to lose an incoming fax.
The biggest problem with all-in-one machines is resolution and performance —
neither the scanner nor the printer offers the image quality or speed you can
get in more expensive separate units. If you can live with that limitation,
though, one of these can save you money. If you send and receive faxes often,
you might want to consider a standalone fax machine (instead of an all-in-one
Chapter 20 ✦Printers, Scanners, and All-in-One Units 325

machine) along with one or more fax modems. The printer in an all-in-one
machine may be too slow to really be of value other than, perhaps, as a color
supplement to a network laser printer. The scanners in all-in-one machines are
too low-resolution for publication work — they’re good enough for OCR and
presentations, but not for quality publication. The addition of one or two fax
modems into the conﬁguration allows you to do computer-based fax transmis-
sion and reception when you really need to do that, while the standalone fax
machine allows you to be independent of the computers for all fax services.
Laser-printer-based all-in-one machines are available too, such as the Canon
MultiPASS 730 and the HP LaserJet 3300mfp. You’ll get better print and scan
quality from the laser units in return for a slightly higher price and monochrome-
only operation.
Summary
✦Nearly all printing requirements can be met with ink jet or laser
printers, which are most of the units sold.
✦Printer drivers and software are at least as important as the printer
itself.
✦Interpolated scanner resolution isn’t the same as raw optical 
resolution — don’t get fooled by inﬂated speciﬁcations.
✦In some situations, an all-in-one machine can save you several 
hundred dollars in duplicated equipment.

he case and the power supply for a computer —
as basic as they might seem — are crucial parts 
of the system. The case and power supply might not 
be as ﬂashy a topic as some of the others we cover, 
but they’re vitally important. Poor choices of case and
power supply can shorten the life of other components,
make a system unreliable, and make upgrades expensive
or impossible. Good choices can improve the usability of
the system, simplify maintenance, and make the system
easier to live with.
Cases, Fans, and Cooling
Your computer case has to do a surprising number of
things:
✦Provide mechanical support and protection
for the components
✦Shield the computer (and your TV) from 
electromagnetic interference (EMI)
✦Display and control basic system functions
such as power on and reset
✦Give you access to components for mainte-
nance and repair
✦Keep everything cool
✦Sustain noise levels low enough to tolerate
The case houses the power supply, motherboard,
adapter cards, disk drives, and internal cables. The
mechanical relationships among the case, motherboard,
and cards are shown in Figure 21-1. The critical features
are that the case and mounts support the motherboard

in enough points to prevent ﬂexing, that the motherboard be properly
grounded, and that the adapter cards be properly supported and aligned with
the connectors on the motherboard.
Figure 21-1: The case supports the motherboard and cards, and provides 
grounding and shielding for the motherboard.
✦Printed circuit board — The motherboard and adapter cards are
each composed of a sandwich of layers of ﬁberglass epoxy and cop-
per conductors. Leads on some components are soldered directly 
to pads on the outer surface. Holes drilled through the board allow
other components and connectors to be soldered. Microscopic
cracks from ﬂexing the board can break the conductors or soldered
joints, causing a failure. That’s why it’s important that the case sup-
port the motherboard and why you have to be careful how you push
or pull on printed circuit cards.
✦Metal and nylon standoffs — At least two metal standoffs (see
Figure 21-2) support the motherboard and provide grounding
between the motherboard and the case. The case ground helps quiet
noise in the system, making signal transmission more reliable.
It’s important to have enough standoffs that all parts of the motherboard
are well supported because positive support for the motherboard (particu-
larly around the connectors for the adapter cards and the keyboard) is cru-
cial. Flexing the motherboard or wrenching an adapter connector can create
nearly invisible cracks in the printed wiring or the soldered connections that
cause the system to operate erratically or to fail altogether. The forces on
the connectors when you insert a card are in the tens of pounds, which can
easily destroy an improperly supported board.
✦Connectors — Bus slot connectors for the adapter cards are sol-
dered to the motherboard. Each connector contains many small
metal ﬁngers that wipe along matching metal pads on the card.
Keeping the cards vertical — lined up perpendicular to the mother-
board — when you insert and remove them is important to keep the
contacts secure and to prevent stressing the connector’s attachment
to the motherboard.

The connectors have to line up mechanically with the cutouts on the back
of the case. The easy way to mount a motherboard so the connectors line
up with the chassis is to put all the mounting screws into the motherboard
loosely, then put in one or two adapter cards. Screw the adapter cards
ﬁrmly to the case, which will set the motherboard into the correct align-
ment, then tighten the motherboard screws.
Drives come in 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch sizes (the numbers originally described
the size of the media ﬂoppy drives of that size used). The 5.25-inch drives are
5.875 inches wide by 1.625 inches high, while the 3.5-inch drives are 4 inches
wide by 1 inch high. The case usually provides spaces (called bays) for drives
of both 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch sizes. Hard and ﬂoppy drives ﬁt the 3.5-inch
bays, while most other drives use the 5.25-inch size.
Figure 21-3 highlights the parts of a computer case. Your computer case will
provide some bays that open to the front of the computer — called external
bays — and others — internal bays — that are accessible only from the inside
of the case. The external bays are most often for 5.25-inch drives (providing 
a 6-inch wide opening), holding CD-ROMs, DVDs, removable disks, tapes, and
any other devices that use removable media. External 3.25-inch bays (a 4-inch
wide opening) are for ﬂoppy drives and other smaller devices. You can use
external bays for hard disks, too — just put a cover plate over the hole in the
case — but you cannot convert an internal bay into an external one without
cutting metal or plastic. Internal bays are most often for hard disks.

Desktop PC cases come in a range of sizes, from small ones with limited expan-
sion capability to ﬂoor-standing monsters able to hold multiple systems. It’s
important to think through the expansion you might want to do before you
buy a new case or new complete system because it’s going to require drastic
measures if you want to exceed the space or cooling available in the case. The
size of the case also affects how hard the system is to work inside because
small cases are almost always cramped and hard to work with and tend to
force haphazard cable layouts that themselves complicate access and service.
Large cases are much easier to work with, have more expansion capability, and
have better airﬂow to aid cooling, but aren’t as easy to ﬁt into your ofﬁce,
home, or home theater.

Airﬂow and heat buildup
Airﬂow cools nearly every desktop computer sold today and is created by fans
in the case itself and in the power supply. How much air pressure the fans cre-
ate and how much air resistance the components and the shape of the case
create determines how effective the cooling will be. Very small cases with lim-
ited airﬂow may be incapable of cooling faster processors, video cards, and
disks that generate a lot of heat.
We measured the power consumption and temperature rise in three different
systems to see how effective their fans and cases were at removing heat. Table
21-1 shows the results of those measurements. System A was a full-size tower,
System B a mini-tower, and System C a full-size tower with auxiliary fans to
improve airﬂow. System D is the PC you’ll see how to build in Chapter 25.
Degrees per watt (the right-hand column in the table) is the measure of how
well a case cools the electronics inside, measuring how much the exhaust air
temperature of the case will climb over the inlet temperature per watt of
power dissipated inside the case.

Systems A and D consume the most power and therefore generate the most
heat. The airﬂow from the power supply fans is the only cooling Systems A and
B have, while Systems C and D both have an auxiliary exhaust fan in addition
to the power supply fan; System D controls the fan speeds based on measured
temperatures. The temperature rise from the System C or D inlet to exhaust is
less per watt than in Systems A and B because the cases are larger, with fewer
restrictions on airﬂow, and because the auxiliary fan helps move more air.
Cooling
All PC processors should have cooling fans on the chip. A processor cooling
fan assembly includes both a heat sink and a fan, as shown in Figure 21-4. The
processor cooling fan gets power from either the motherboard or from a tap
on a disk drive power connector. Heat created by the operation of the chip
Chapter 21 ✦Cases, Cooling, and Power 333

ﬂows from the chip to the surrounding chip package. The heat sink (a ﬁnned
structure clipped into close contact with the chip package) conducts heat
from the chip package, removing heat from the chip and keeping it cooler. Cool
air driven past the heat sink by the fan takes heat off the heat sink into the 
surrounding air. The ﬁns on the heat sink increase the contact between the air
and the heat sink, improving the rate of heat transfer. If the fan stops, however,
little or no air moves, and the rate of heat transfer slows greatly. The chip 
will get hotter until its maximum ratings are exceeded. At that point it will fail,
possibly permanently.

heat sink, cooling the ﬁns and heating the air.

Checking Your Processor Fan Installation
Here’s how to ﬁnd out if your processor cooling fan is working right, and if it’s
mounted on the chip properly. (Be careful about discharging static electricity;
see Chapter 1 for the right techniques.)
1. Turn off the computer, open it up, and unplug the processor fan.
2. Power up the machine and keep a ﬁnger on the fan’s heat sink. If the
chip and heat sink are in good contact, the heat sink will get very hot.
3. Quickly shut down the machine, reconnect the fan power, and start up
again. Let the chip temperature stabilize by waiting a few minutes, and
check the heat sink temperature with your ﬁnger again; you’ll see that
it’s a lot cooler.
Don’t leave the power on with the fan unplugged for more than a minute or so,
or you’ll cook the chip. Also, this test may not work with every motherboard,
because some boards detect low RPMs from the processor fan and refuse to
boot in that case.

Figure 21-5 is a close-up of the processor cooling heat sink and fan we used in
the high performance PC you can see how to build in Chapter 25. It’s rated to
cool even the 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 processor, and does so without creating a lot
of fan noise because of the large copper heat sink. The overall assembly
exceeds Intel speciﬁcations for maximum heat sink weight, however, so you’ll
have to take precautions if you intend to ship the computer after assembly.
Figure 21-5: Processor cooling heat sink and fan
©2004 Barry Press & Marcia Press
If you look at the speciﬁcations for commercial-grade chips, you’ll ﬁnd that they
are commonly rated for a “free-air temperature” of up to 70 degrees Celsius
(158 degrees Fahrenheit), far above the exhaust air temperatures in Table 21-1.
The limited airﬂow created by weak fans in most computers lets heat pockets
build up in the case, causing the air temperature in the vicinity of the pocket
to go well over the maximum ambient rating.
Figure 21-6 shows one way heat pockets come about. A stack of disk drives
and other peripherals is common in most computers. Each drive includes both
a drive mechanism and a board of electronics, both of which generate heat
that gets trapped in the pockets between drives and boards. Stacking drives
one on top of another tends to block the airﬂow, forcing most of the cooling air
to ﬂow around the sources of heat. This allows heat pockets to develop in the
stack, as shown in the exploded view of the ﬂoppy drive and CD-ROM drive on
Chapter 21 ✦Cases, Cooling, and Power 335

the right of Figure 21-6. If the air temperature in the pockets exceeds maximum
ratings, the drives will fail.
The example in Figure 21-6 happens all the time. You can solve the problem by
making sure the case you use has a metal cage surrounding the drives that
conducts heat away (plastic ones can’t do that) and by making sure the sides
of the drives have solid, metal-to-metal contact with the cage. If you mount 3.5-
inch drives in 5.25-inch bays, make sure the spacer brackets you use are metal
and themselves provide a good heat conduction path.
Figure 21-6: Trapped air in the case can overheat chips and cause 
failures.
Pockets of trapped heat can happen in a group of adapter cards plugged 
into the motherboard, too. Each card generates heat — graphics cards in 
particular — and the tight spaces between cards can impede good airﬂow.
Figure 21-7 shows the normal airﬂow pattern in a tower or mini-tower case —
the airﬂow runs from inlets on the front, past the motherboard and cards, and
out through the power supply and vents in the back. A little air comes in from
openings at the front of the drive bays and is drawn to the back, but not much
unless you explicitly use a drive fan with front inlets. The horizontal position-
ing of the adapter cards can trap heat too, so the relative position of cards is
worth some thought — you should leave gaps between cards to keep hot cards
away from each other if possible, and order cards to prevent having two hot
cards in adjacent slots.
Open space helps avoid blocked airﬂow. Bigger fans or more fans move more
air through the case, lowering the internal case temperature, which helps to
overcome blockages and heat pockets. Badly placed cables can block airﬂow.

The ATX form factor
The IBM PC/AT established a motherboard form factor that survived for over a
decade. As component technology and system designs evolved, though, prob-
lems with that design became more onerous. Four of the more signiﬁcant prob-
lems were as follows:
✦Processor positioning — The processor on an AT motherboard typi-
cally sits under the space reserved for some of the adapter cards.
Processor cooling fans would intrude into the space for the cards,
preventing full-length cards from being used in those slots.
✦Lack of low voltage power — The chips used when the AT mother-
board was designed all used 5 V power, and the AT power supplies
were speciﬁed for that interface. The small line widths now in proces-
sors and other chips require 3.3 V, 2.0 V, or less, because they can’t
withstand the higher voltages without conversion.
✦High voltage switching within the computer case — The PC/AT was
a desktop unit that positioned the power switch inside the power
supply, but on the side of the case at the back. That’s inconvenient
for tower cases, which led designers to move the high voltage power
switch to the front of the case. The presence of high voltage within
the case can be a hazard.

✦I/O port cabling requirements — The PC/AT had no I/O ports built
onto the motherboard. As the functions built onto motherboards
expanded to include serial, parallel, sound, mouse, Universal Serial
Bus (USB), and network ports, cables had to be built to route the sig-
nals from the motherboard to the front or back of the case. The labor
involved has led to the building and installing of those cables becom-
ing a noticeable fraction of the system cost.
The need to solve these problems in the AT motherboard form factor led to
the deﬁnition of the ATX form factor incompatible with the older AT layout.
The most apparent characteristic of an ATX case is the input/output (I/O)
panel at the top of the motherboard (see Figure 21-8).
Figure 21-8: The ATX form factor simpliﬁes internal cabling and improves 
component layout.
©2004 Barry Press & Marcia Press
The ATX form factor improved PC designs in several ways:
✦Processor positioning — The processor in an ATX case is behind the
I/O panel, out of line from the adapter cards. That repositioning pro-
vides clearance for fans above the processors. The memory sockets
have been relocated near the processor to simplify motherboard
design.
✦Lack of 3.3 V power — Initially, the power connector on an ATX
motherboard included 3.3 V along with the usual ±5 V and ±12 V 
supplies. As processor power requirements increased, the interface
expanded to include an auxiliary 3.3 V connector to provide addi-
tional power. Current generation processors require more current
than can reasonably be sourced directly from the power supply —
the 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 Processor Extreme Edition can consume 71.5 A
at 1.475 to 1.55 volts — and therefore use the modiﬁed ATX12V power
supply speciﬁcation, which adds a third motherboard connector sup-
plying 12 V to be stepped down on the motherboard.
338 Part VII ✦Integration

✦High voltage switching within the computer case — The power sup-
ply in an ATX system is more like an instant-on television than older
computer designs. The power connector to an ATX motherboard also
includes a low-voltage signal that gets routed to a power on/off button
on the front of the case. That signal tells the power supply to turn the
main supply lines on or off. As long as power is connected, though,
the motherboard receives a limited 5 V supply to keep standby func-
tions running.
Standby power makes it even more important to disconnect an ATX supply
from wall power whenever you’re working inside the case.
✦I/O port cabling requirements — The I/O port connectors are built
onto the ATX motherboard, terminating in a panel at the back. A
standard layout for the panel exists, ensuring cutouts in the case will
be in the right place.
Demand has lead to designs for smaller desktop PCs. The NLX form factor,
available in the late 1990s, made small boxes possible, but never caught on.
Later designs from Shuttle and Soltek have been well received, but used moth-
erboards and cases built to a proprietary form factor. The Intel BTX speciﬁca-
tion includes a proﬁle for a relatively small PC, but it’s as yet unclear if it will
supplant ATX and microATX.
Choosing a case
Although laptops and very small form factors leave few choices but proprietary
designs, keep in mind that, despite all the competition in the PC industry, need-
lessly proprietary designs remain a favorite tactic of companies hoping to lock
you in for expensive upgrades once you’ve bought their product.
Lots of companies use this tactic — a who’s who of the PC industry is full of
the guilty. You can rely on paying more if you get caught by one of these, and
on being at the mercy of the manufacturer when they decide to stop sup-
porting that model. You may not ﬁnd out about proprietary models until it’s
too late, unless you ask about compliance with industry-standard form factors,
interfaces, and software standards before you buy. Be sure to ask not only
about memory and disk, but also about the motherboard and power supply.
You’ve been warned.
If you buy a complete computer from a manufacturer, your choices in cases
are likely to be whether you want a tower, mini-tower, or desktop, or want it 
in blue. You might have an option for auxiliary fans available. If you integrate
your own machine, you’re in the market for a case and have a wide range of
options. Things that make for a great case include:
✦Gobs of room inside — We’re far more interested in a machine that’s
easy to work on, reliable, and upgradable than in its being tiny. Your
needs may well favor small size, but you’ll pay the price in compro-
mises. Having 10 external drive bays ﬁts our deﬁnition of upgradabil-
ity, for example, but having just one does not.
Chapter 21 ✦Cases, Cooling, and Power 339

✦Airﬂow to keep the electronics very cool — We like having lots of
fans. Motherboards ﬁnally have working technology to control fan
speed, meaning you don’t have to choose between cooling and noise.
✦Attention to detail — For example, you should look for heavy sheet
metal that provides good support, simple case opening mechanisms
that give you access to everything inside, and a lack of sharp edges
that could cut you and internal cables.
Cases have evolved considerably from the plain beige or black boxes you’re
used to. We show you how to build a very quiet, very high performance PC in
Chapter 25, but if your tastes run more to the visually extreme, the products
are available to open windows to the inside of your PC, paint or carve designs
into the case, and light it to show off your work.
Power Supplies
The power supply converts power coming into your computer from the wall
outlet to the forms usable by the electronics in the system. It changes incom-
ing alternating current (AC) at 120 or 240 volts to direct current (DC) at 3.3, ±5
and ±12 V. A good power supply does more than power conversion — it cleans
up the spikes, surges, and sags in the utility power. Motors, copiers, appliances,
and other electrical devices create noise in the power at your wall outlet, as do
lightning strikes and other effects farther away. If that noise gets through the
power supply into the electronics in the computer, it causes trouble ranging
from erratic operation to complete shutdown. A high-quality power supply will
be more resistant to these problems, giving you more reliable operation from
your computer.
You need to know four electrical terms to understand and compare power 
supplies — voltage, current, power, and frequency.
✦Voltage is the force pushing electricity through the wire. It’s like the
water pressure in your garden hose: More voltage is like more water
pressure. Voltage is measured in volts (abbreviated V). In North
America, common wall-outlet power is at 120 V. European power is
commonly 240 V.
✦Current is the amount of electricity ﬂowing through the wire and is
like the ﬂow of water through a hose. Current is measured in
amperes (or amps, abbreviated A).
✦Power is the product of voltage and current (voltage times current),
and is measured in watts (abbreviated W). If your computer draws 3
amps at 120 V, it uses 360 W.
✦Frequency is the rate at which the power alternates between positive
and negative voltages. Frequency is measured in Hertz (abbreviated
Hz); a Hertz is one cycle per second. North American power arrives
at 60 Hz; European power is mostly 50 Hz.
340 Part VII ✦Integration

Selecting good power supplies
A good power supply is easy to describe but very hard to design. It must be
reliable, and must deliver clean, stable power. The circuits in your computer
are terribly sensitive to variations in supply voltage, so the power supply has
to keep the voltage stable, ﬁltering out the ripples in the incoming AC power
and compensating for load variations from the computer circuits. Good power
supplies have a wide tolerance for both fast input power variations and for
ones over several seconds. By speciﬁcation, ATX12V supplies must keep all
voltages but the –12 V supply within 5 percent of nominal, and must keep the
–12 V supply within 10 percent. Some high-quality supplies can maintain their
outputs within 1 percent.
You do have a choice in how much power the supply can give the com-
puter. Computers with faster processors, more memory, and more drives
draw more power than smaller ones. You want to leave margin for adding
new hardware in the future, too, want to run the power supply at about 50
percent total load, and have to be careful not to exceed the maximum rat-
ing on any individual output (including the standby power outputs). In
addition to extending power supply life (by letting it run cooler), running
below maximum capacity helps extend the power supply’s hold-up time
during short AC power dropouts. We commonly use power supplies of
about 400 W capacity for high-performance desktop computers, such as
the 380 W unit we use in Chapter 25. There’s no loss in using a larger sup-
ply because the computer draws only what it needs — the power supply
rating is the maximum, not a constant ﬁgure.
Uninterruptible power supplies
The best power supply won’t help much when the AC supply goes out.
Admittedly, when you’re sitting there in the dark, the work you were doing might
not be your ﬁrst concern, but it’s likely to be something you worry about later.
Nor is a widespread power failure the only threat. We’ve seen computers taken
out by plugging a vacuum cleaner or coffee pot into the same circuit.
You don’t have to put up with losing your work. Once found only in major 
computer installations or alongside mission-critical systems, an uninterruptible
power supply (UPS) is now an inexpensive addition that can easily pay for itself
by saving hours of work.
A UPS consists of a power supply, a battery, and a reverse power supply.
Figure 21-9 shows how this works. The incoming power supply — similar to
what’s in your computer — creates the DC the battery needs whenever utility
AC power is available. The outgoing power supply does the same thing in
reverse: It converts battery DC to AC that your computer’s power supply can
use. The source of the DC power the outgoing supply receives is the incoming
AC supply (if it’s operating) or the battery. Either way, the AC output is stable,
with no interruption in output power as the input AC comes and goes.
Chapter 21 ✦Cases, Cooling, and Power 341

Figure 21-9: UPS schematic
The need to both charge the battery and run the output supply increases 
the load on the input supply, so it needs to be larger and more expensive.
Commercial UPS technology introduces a switch inside the UPS so the output
supply runs only when the input power fails, but also introduces a short gap 
in the output power during switchover.
The capacity of the output power supply inside the UPS determines how
big a computer (and how many other devices) it can support. The size of
the batteries in the UPS determines how long it can provide power during
an outage. You can’t exceed maximum ratings, so don’t buy a UPS that’s
too small and be sure to have extra capacity for expanding your systems.
The bigger battery in a larger UPS can hold up over extended outages.
Figure 21-10 shows the time/power tradeoff for two UPSs from American
Power Conversion (APC).
A UPS can be very inexpensive protection. Units that will keep a small computer
running for 15 minutes retail for less than $100. Putting your own computer on
a UPS protects your local data. Putting your ﬁle server on a UPS protects your
organization’s data. Putting the LAN equipment (hubs and switches, for exam-
ple) on a UPS protects your ability to connect from one computer to another.
Putting your communications gear (for example, routers and modems) on a
UPS protects your ability to interact with the Internet. Think about asking your
Internet service provider if all their equipment — servers, modems, routers,
everything — is on a UPS. If it’s not and you must have reliable access to the
Net, get another provider.

External Connectors
It can be traumatic to connect or disconnect all the cables at the back of your
PC if you’re not familiar with what each one is for and to what it connects.
Typical PC connectors have three important properties — type, gender, and
number of pins — that let you distinguish one from another.
✦Type is the kind of connector. The ones used for serial, parallel, and
video monitor ports are called D subminiature connectors. The one
for the keyboard is called a DIN connector and comes in two sizes
(regular and mini-DIN).
✦Gender speciﬁes whether the connector has sockets or pins. Serial
ports are male D subminiature connectors; parallel ports are female.
✦Number of pins is simply how many connections there are in the
connector. Serial ports have 9 or 25 pins. Parallel ports have 25.
Table 21-2 shows the characteristics of some of the more common connectors
you’ll encounter.

It’s easiest to apply Table 21-2 as you disconnect wires, but if you have an
unknown connector, the table is a starting point. The connectors in the table
are the ones at the computer — the ones at the other end of the cable might
be very different. For example, the connector at the printer end of a parallel
printer cable looks more like an old-style SCSI connector (they’re both
Centronics-type connectors; the printer connector has fewer pins). Here’s 
a little more information if some of those connectors seem unfamiliar:
✦D subminiature connectors are most common for cables to external
modems, but you’ll see them for printer ports, game controller ports,
monitor video ports, and Ethernet ports, too. They typically have
two or three rows of pins. They always have an odd number of pins
so that the connector outline is a trapezoid and ﬁts only one way.
✦DIN connectors are the round ones you typically ﬁnd on keyboards
and some mice. DIN stands for Deutsches Institut für Normung, which
in English is the German Institute for Standardization. DIN connectors
come in two basic sizes: the normal size you ﬁnd on older AT key-
boards and the small (mini-DIN) size you ﬁnd on PS/2 keyboards and
Chapter 21 ✦Cases, Cooling, and Power 345

mice now universal on ATX-style motherboards. Little plugs in the
connector and the pin layout limit the connector orientation to the
correct position. Don’t force it.
✦RCA connectors are the unthreaded kind you typically ﬁnd on the
back of your stereo, television, and VCR. Female RCA connectors are
about 1⁄4 inch in diameter, with a relatively large hole in the middle.
✦Mini headphone connectors are the small round connectors found
on headphones and on boom boxes and other audio equipment (for
connecting the headphones). Typical mini headphone connectors
have two or three wires connected through the one pin — if you look
closely, you’ll see rings of metal on the pin separated by thin rings of
insulation.
✦RJ-11 and RJ-45 connectors are the small modular telephone jacks
found all over North America since the old boxy four-pin connectors
went away.
✦F connectors are the threaded connectors used with coaxial cable for
televisions.
✦Centronics connectors are the ones found on printer parallel port
connections.
Summary
✦A well-designed case improves the maintainability, upgradability, reli-
ability, and serviceability of your computer.
✦Heat is the worst enemy your computer has. Excessive heat reduces
the life of every component in the machine.
✦Extra capacity in the power supply is inexpensive, creates reserve
for expansion, and helps the supply run cooler.
✦An uninterruptible power supply can save you hours of work when
the power goes out.
✦Knowing what each type of connector on your PC is for helps you
identify the components you’re working with and helps you connect
cables to the back of the system.

aptops — and now tablet PCs — are a breed apart.
The added constraints of minimum size and
extended battery operation change the design decisions
engineers make for mobile PCs, and raise the cost. The
convenience of using the same computer for both desk-
top and portable situations may save you some time, but
it may not save money, and indeed may not save time.
The problem is that when you’re traveling, you typically
want very different capabilities from those you prefer in
your home or ofﬁce.
Table 22-1 shows the problem — weight and size matter
most in a laptop. The farther you carry your laptop, the
more its weight approaches 20 tons. It’s reasonable to
make compromises in your laptop’s features and per-
formance to get the size and weight down because most
people don’t do things with a laptop that are as com-
plex as they might do with a desktop computer, and
they don’t do as many things at once.
Because your laptop’s portability is paramount, the
compromises you’re likely to make may limit its suitabil-
ity as a desktop machine — it may be short on memory
or disk, have a limited display, and may have a lesser
processor than you might want.
What’s in Your Laptop?
Like any other personal computer, a laptop or tablet PC
has the usual processor, disk, memory, display, and
communications. Some tablets now even have a key-
board, as do all laptops. Where these systems differ
from desktop machines is in the speciﬁcations for these
components to cope with limited size, weight, and
power. Reducing the power requirement is not only a

way to extend battery life, but also a way to limit the heat generated inside the
laptop case. This is a vital need because protecting the computer from shock
and damage requires that the electronics be tightly enclosed, which limits how
much heat can be dissipated.

Processor, memory, and bus
It’s difﬁcult to blow air through a laptop to cool it, which further limits heat
dissipation. The limited cooling capability restricts how much heat any one
device in a laptop can generate, because if the rate at which heat builds up
exceeds how fast it dissipates, the device temperature will increase until the
laptop fails. Because the heat a processor generates is directly proportional 
to its clock speed, designers commonly limit processor speed to control heat
generated in the chip.
348 Part VII ✦Integration

Nevertheless, the reduced power consumption made possible by advances in
chip-manufacturing technology means that current generation laptop and tablet
processors, running at full speed, clock at over a gigahertz, with the fastest
ones clocking over 3 gigahertz and including the same hyperthreading technol-
ogy found in the fastest desktops. Power management typically steps down the
clock rate when the added speed isn’t necessary to reduce heat dissipation.
Chapter 22 ✦Laptops and Handheld Computers 349
Evolution of the Laptop PC
Laptop PCs — notebooks — have changed substantially since the ﬁrst clumsy sys-
tems. Initial offerings were slow, with tiny screens and ﬂoppy disk drives. Later
systems added hard drives and bigger screens, but were large, heavy, and slow.
More recently very thin, very lightweight notebooks were popular because
they’re easier to travel with than more fully featured but larger and heavier units.
Relentless increases in capability — well beyond what’s required for a portable
secondary PC — opened up the possibility of using a laptop as your primary com-
puter. Manufacturers have supported that idea for many years with docking sta-
tions that let you park the PC at your desk and hook into a keyboard, monitor,
and the LAN, but it’s only in the past few years the machines had enough power
to make that realistic for all but the most forgiving users.
Reduction in size of the communications chipset has also led to laptops with
IEEE 802.11 networking integrated into the machine, with no external card or
antenna. Notebooks with integrated networking are literally useful while you
walk around, an application once the exclusive domain of Personal Digital
Assistants (PDAs).
The combination of thin, lightweight notebooks and embedded communications
led designers to create tablet PCs, which were initially the electronic equivalent
of a pad of paper. You write and draw on the display surface; your input is either
captured directly or interpreted and converted to text. Electronically, tablet PCs
were initially laptops with a touch-sensitive screen and no keyboard.
PDAs using the Palm operating system owned virtually the entire handheld com-
puter market. Like ﬁrst generation tablet PCs, the Palm handhelds had no key-
board, using the “Grafﬁti” writing system to let users write directly on the display
surface with a stylus. Windows PCs have had software support for handwritten
input for many years, but it’s been clumsy and not terribly useful.
The failings of handwritten input drove both PDAs and tablet PCs to add key-
boards. The Research in Motion Blackberry PDAs have had a keyboard from the
beginning; Palm PDAs added them as third-party and later ﬁrst-party accessories.
Tablet PCs added fold-away keyboards in later models. The most recent models
show the future of notebook PCs may be versions of tablets with keyboards.
Many notebooks now have displays that pivot axially, allowing the display to fold
down on the back of the keyboard. Users of such machines can use them as
writable tablets in that mode or can unfold the keyboard and use them as con-
ventional notebooks.

Intel targets two speciﬁc technologies at the mobile PC market:
✦Pentium M — A processor family distinct from the Celeron and
Pentium 4 (which you’ll also ﬁnd in laptops and tablets), the Pentium
M speciﬁcally targets low power consumption instead of maximum
performance to give much longer battery life.
✦Centrino — Intel markets a combination of the Pentium M processor
and an IEEE 802.11b wireless adapter internal to the notebook or
tablet as the Centrino product. (IEEE 802.11g will be added to the
product line.) The advantage Centrino brings, beyond lower power
consumption and wireless access, is good integration of the hard-
ware and software, making it simple to make the system connect in
almost any situation.
AMD has similar products but emphasizes performance in its mobile line with
versions of its 64-bit Athlon processor.
The memory and buses in laptop computers are typically somewhat different
from those in desktop machines; the highly constrained space in a laptop
doesn’t leave room for conventional packaging. Most common now is for the
electrical interfaces to be standard, such as use of the PCI bus, but the physi-
cal form to be smaller than the desktop version of the standard. The resulting
designs often don’t conform to any widespread industry standard, so produc-
tion volumes and sources of supply are less and upgrades are more expensive.
If you’re willing to pay the price in size, weight, power consumption, and cost,
however, you can get desktop-equivalent performance. For example, you can
get more memory than you’ll need for virtually anything you would do —
laptops that can handle up to 2GB of memory are available.
PC Card and PC CardBus
The exception to proprietary components in laptop computers is a standard
created speciﬁcally to allow modules to plug into laptops — the PC CardBus
and PC Cards. This standard was formerly known as PCMCIA (Personal
Computer Memory Card International Association). As is noted in Chapter 5, PC
Cards support read/write and read-only memory, hard disk drives, modems,
wired and wireless network adapters, sound adapters, GPS receivers, and more.
PC CardBus isn’t a cure-all. It’s limited to 2 Mbps, which is acceptable for all
these applications, although it’s not what you’d really want for disk or mem-
ory. The success of the PC Card is reﬂected in the variety of devices you can
buy. The most popular are communications interfaces and disks. The cards
have most of the features you’d expect in full-size units — the most likely rea-
son to compromise is that they’re expensive.
Be careful about cables or connectors for PC Cards. Because the card is
thin, the connectors can be fragile. (So can the card — more than one has
been destroyed when someone left it in their wallet and sat on it.) Check
with the manufacturer before you buy — we’ve seen situations in which
replacement cables were either not available or were so expensive that it
was cheaper to buy another card.
350 Part VII ✦Integration

Laptop displays
All laptops use liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Plasma panels competed in the
market for a while, but the much lower power consumption of LCD doomed
plasma. Current generation laptops and tablets use active matrix Thin Film
Transistor (TFT) panels, backlit by very bright LEDs, which offer lower power
consumption than ﬂuorescent lights. Active matrix is bright, sharp, and view-
able at almost any angle.
The largest laptop and tablet LCDs are over 15 inches diagonal with
1,280×1,024 resolution available. Video chips include full 3D acceleration,
although not as fast as what you’ll ﬁnd in the most powerful desktops.
Disk
Laptop disk drives, like desktop drives, have increased in size. You no longer
have to struggle to make all your applications ﬁt — you can get 20 to 80GB
drives, along with a DVD writer.
Besides capacity, the two biggest differences between laptop disk drives and
desktop disk drives are transfer rates and more aggressive power management.
Laptop disks are typically slow compared to desktop drives, and get powered
down after a short period of inactivity. The motors in the disks consume a sig-
niﬁcant amount of power, so this is an important measure. When your laptop
wants access to the disk, you’ll wait while the disk spins up to operating speed.
You have to make an important trade-off between memory and disk in a laptop
computer. If you have too little memory, your computer will go to the disk rela-
tively often for fragments of programs, requiring the disk to keep running (or
spin up) to satisfy the request. That activity keeps the disk running, drawing
power, and slows down operation. If you have enough memory in the laptop
(say, at least 256MB if you’ll be running only one program at a time), Windows
will use the extra memory as a large cache, reducing disk access and letting the
disk stay powered down. Your laptop runs faster and longer on each battery.
Few laptops or tablets include internal ﬂoppy disks any more (get a USB ﬂoppy
drive if you need to use ﬂoppies), but nearly all include CD-ROM drives, and
many include CD-RW or DVD±RW drives. Optical drives are particularly useful
if you take along programs such as DeLorme’s Street Atlas with a GPS
receiver — we print maps for the destination before ﬂying on business, but
with software and a GPS in your laptop, you have a navigator alongside you.
Communications and ports
Laptop computers commonly come with a serial port, parallel port, video port,
and docking-station port; far more useful, however, are USB and Ethernet
ports. You’ll want both a modem and a network interface because communica-
tions requirements with your laptop depend on where you are. If you’re in
your ofﬁce or a hotel with broadband access, you’ll probably want to tie 
the computer into the local area network (LAN) and may need a wireless 
Chapter 22 ✦Laptops and Handheld Computers 351

IEEE 802.11b connection for that. If you’re on the road with only a phone line,
you’ll want a modem to dial in with.
Be careful with built-in modems. It’s more common than you might think
to plug a modem into a wall jack in a hotel room, only to ﬁnd out that the
hotel’s telephone system is digital (or otherwise incompatible). You can
easily burn out the interface circuits in a modem this way. If the entire com-
puter has to go in for repair, you’re out of business.
You can have other modem problems traveling, too. We’ve encountered
telephone switches in hotels that wouldn’t deliver a dial tone to the laptop
modem (although they would to an analog phone) and needed a different
cable to connect to the phone jacks in the United Kingdom.
Batteries
Power management evolved in laptops to extend their battery life. The technol-
ogy transferred into desktop machines only when people noticed that reducing
the power consumption of hundreds of millions of desktop computers could
signiﬁcantly reduce worldwide power consumption.
Beyond power management (and low power consumption), the key power issue
for laptop computers is the battery. Tremendous progress has been made in
battery technology to power camcorders, laptops, and other portable electron-
ics, resulting in several competing battery technologies:
✦Nickel-cadmium — Nickel-cadmium (NiCad) batteries are being
phased out because of memory problems — the batteries “remem-
ber” when they’re only partially discharged and don’t recharge to full
capacity. Recharging a nickel-cadmium battery that’s not fully dis-
charged can keep the battery from ever being fully charged again
unless you go through a special discharge/recharge cycle.
✦Nickel–metal hydride — Nickel–metal hydride (NiMH) batteries have
an advantage over NiCad because they are not subject to the memory
effect when being recharged. The newest versions of nickel–metal
hydride batteries are claimed to have higher energy-density levels
than lithium-ion batteries and at less cost. Nickel–metal hydride bat-
teries have a short shelf life (they discharge in a few days), so be sure
to recharge them completely before you go traveling.
✦Lithium-ion — Lithium-ion batteries are a recent development, but
are now widely available. You can expect 20 to 30 percent longer per-
formance than with the older versions of nickel–metal hydride (possi-
bly as long as 7 hours’ operation) with a good shelf life. A lithium-ion
battery provides three times the voltage of a nickel-cadmium battery,
which lets designers reduce the number of batteries required. There
is no memory effect, and the battery has a life cycle of 1,200 charge/
discharge cycles. (Some sources dispute that lifetime estimate, 
352 Part VII ✦Integration

suggesting you’ll only get 300–500 cycles.) Lithium-ion batteries don’t
require environmentally polluting material (such as cadmium, mer-
cury, or PVC).
✦Zinc-air — Rechargeable zinc-air batteries can last up to 15 hours.
The battery is large (nearly the size of the laptop itself), heavy, and
expensive.
✦Lithium-polymer — Lithium-polymer batteries are still in develop-
ment. The battery looks like a sheet of plastic about the size of a
playing card, and can be wrapped around other components.
Projections are that the technology will weigh 75 percent less and
run four times longer on a single charge than a nickel-cadmium bat-
tery of similar weight. Lithium-polymer batteries can be molded into
any shape. The batteries support high-energy densities, do not have
memory-drain problems, and use environmentally safe materials.
However, lithium-polymer batteries presently have a limited life cycle
(about 175 hours) and may not be viable for several years.
Lithium-ion batteries are the technology of choice in laptops today because of
their high energy storage for the weight and lack of recharging memory effects.
Be careful how you store systems with lithium-ion batteries, though, because
the batteries go into thermal runaway above 60 degrees C (140 degrees F) and
can burn or explode. (For example, you probably shouldn’t leave a laptop,
tablet, or cell phone in a car trunk out in the sun.) Whichever battery technol-
ogy you have in your laptop, be sure to recycle any battery at the end of its
useful life. Some battery components are explosive in ﬁres, while others are
toxic and difﬁcult to remove from the environment. Check with your local recy-
cling company to ﬁnd out about safe battery disposal.
If you drive with your laptop a lot, or if you ﬂy a lot and can either upgrade
into ﬁrst class or book it directly, you can use a car/plane adapter from the
laptop manufacturer or a third party such as iGo (www.igo.com). (Check the
front of the seats on the airline you ﬂy for power connectors.) A setup like that
enables you to run your laptop indeﬁnitely off car or plane power, regardless
of how long your batteries would run by themselves.
Docking Stations
You may ﬁnd it unacceptable to have two computers (one for travel and one
for your desk). For example, if you use your laptop with a wireless network to
work while you walk around, having to switch constantly between a laptop 
and desktop machine is really an inconvenience. If so, you may want to look at
what are called docking stations — boxes that sit on your desk and into which
you can plug your laptop. The docking station provides additional resources,
such as power, a monitor, full-size keyboard, network interface, disk, hard disk,
or CD-ROM. The idea is that you don’t need those extras while you’re mobile,
but the docking station makes them available when you’re at your desk. The
added resources could be enough to let the one computer meet your ﬁxed and
mobile requirements while keeping the laptop itself small and light.
Chapter 22 ✦Laptops and Handheld Computers 353

Don’t assume you’ll save money with a docking station. The electrical interface
between laptop and docking station is a proprietary connector, and the physi-
cal ﬁt of the laptop into the docking station is unique to the speciﬁc model.
You’re likely to have only one source for the docking station, and you pay for
the privilege.
Handheld Computers
Not everyone needs a computer of heroic proportion to carry around with
them — it may well be you only need something that tracks your address and
telephone book, reminds you of appointments, lets you check e-mail, or plays
music. If that lesser list covers your needs, a handheld PC — a unit literally
about the size of your hand — may be sufﬁcient. In return for limited capabil-
ity, you get the advantages of a small, lightweight machine (also called a PDA,
or personal digital assistant) that runs for tens of hours on small batteries.
A wide range of options in handheld computing exists with greater or lesser
compatibility and interoperability with PCs:
✦Entertainment — You can get handheld music (MP3) and video play-
ers, storing songs and movies on a compact hard drive. You’ll down-
load content from your PC or, for some units, compress directly on
the player from a video source.
✦E-mail, calendar, and communications — The stereotypical PDA
includes at least a calendar and e-mail client. More useful ones
include a wireless data connection and may include a cell phone, too.
Ones using the Palm or Blackberry software typically provide Web
browsers, but won’t run Windows or Linux software, while ones from
HP and others run a variety of Windows tailored for the smaller hard-
ware environment. All have some way to interact with the calendar
and e-mail software on your PC, and possibly with your Internet serv-
ice provider (ISP).
✦Scaled down laptop equivalents — Handheld laptops do exist, full
PCs sized to ﬁt your hand. You sacriﬁce a lot in screen size and key-
board usability, and your ﬁnger isn’t very good as a mouse on the
small screen, but you can run any software that ﬁts on the hardware.
With a Web browser and the capabilities available through Web pages, you can
get at an enormous range of information including news, stock quotes, and
street maps. With e-mail software, you can connect to your Internet service
provider and both send and receive messages. A wireless cell phone or IEEE
802.11b interface lets you communicate on the go, while a GPS receiver lets
you navigate from stored maps.
Devices you plug into the PC Card slot can consume a lot of power, and
there’s little to be had. The batteries in handheld devices can be drained
quickly by power-hungry devices.
354 Part VII ✦Integration

Global Positioning System
Some of the most interesting applications of a PC are to navigate and to create
maps, survey property, and plot the location of pipes, roads, buildings, and
other objects. These applications are made possible by an inexpensive portable
receiver for the Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS works by measuring the
distance from you to a constellation of satellites, as in Figure 22-1. Your GPS
receiver can accurately measure the time it takes for a radio signal to travel
from each of the satellites to you (which, as a side beneﬁt, means that a GPS
receiver always knows the current time accurately). It uses that time — and an
accurate knowledge of the satellite’s position — to compute the distance you
are from the satellite. After doing those computations for the signals from a
number of satellites, it can compute the point that is simultaneously the right
distance from all the satellites, and that’s where you are.
Figure 22-1: GPS calculates the location that puts you at the right distance 
from all the satellites your receiver can see.
In Figure 22-1, the dashed-line arcs are (in two dimensions) the places at the
right distance from each satellite. The point labeled “You Are Here” is the point
at the right distance from both satellites. (Actually, there’s a point above the
top of the ﬁgure where the two arcs meet again. Factoring in measurements
from more satellites lets your receiver decide which of the two points is your
location.)
There are three spread spectrum signals transmitted from every GPS
satellite — the C/A code signal (for civilian users), the P code signal (much
more accurate, but restricted to military users), and the Y code signal
Measured

Chapter 22 ✦Laptops and Handheld Computers 355

(restricted to military users with the right decryption key). The position error
in three dimensions for the C/A code signal can be as great as 93 meters,
although it’s typically far less. Because mapping and other applications need
accuracy better than that, though, people have devised ways to get around the
errors introduced into the civilian C/A signal. In North America, the accuracy
enhancement approach of choice is the Wide Area Augmentation System
(WAAS), which uses a signal from another, geosynchronous satellite to correct
errors in the GPS calculations.
A GPS receiver is a good traveling companion for your laptop computer. The
DeLorme Earthmate USB receiver is the size of a matchbook and runs off
power supplied by the USB port. With the addition of a GPS receiver and GPS-
aware street map software, your laptop computer becomes a portable naviga-
tion system. If your mapping software lets you record positions, you can create
your own maps. A version of the software on a handheld computer makes an
ideal walk-around solution.
Communications Security
Your communications options traveling with a mobile computer are far more
restricted than in an environment you control, but the security challenges are
no less. You’re not likely to have a router with network address translation, or
a ﬁrewall, between you and the Internet, and any wireless networks you join
are unlikely to use any form of encryption. If you’ve shared any drives on your
PC, they’re exposed to attack on public networks. Worse yet, simple theft of
your mobile computer can leave all your data open for exploitation.
You should evaluate the threats you face and your security practices before
you travel. The following guidelines can help you build a good set of practices:
✦Share nothing — A mobile PC should have no shared disks or print-
ers. If you need to share data with someone, use a USB ﬂash disk to
transfer the data.
✦Keep current on patches — Windows, and to a lesser extent other
operating systems, have had many security vulnerabilities that can
leave your PC open to compromise. Keeping your mobile PC current
with security patches can reduce your exposure.
✦Use a software ﬁrewall — Software ﬁrewalls, such as ZoneAlarm or
the ﬁrewall built into Windows XP, can help lock out attacks.
✦Don’t leave the PC on and connected when not in use — You’re
more exposed to attack the longer you stay connected to an insecure
network. Shut down your PC or disconnect it from the network when
you don’t need the connection.
✦Password the BIOS and your Windows account — A password in
the BIOS keeps the PC from booting without the password unless the
attacker guesses the password or resets the BIOS, something casual
thieves may not be able to do. Using the NT File System (NTFS) and
passwording your Windows account keeps attackers out of the PC
356 Part VII ✦Integration

and out of the ﬁle system unless they know how to either boot from
a CD-ROM and use the NTFSDOS utility, or disassemble the computer
and hook the drive to another PC.
✦Use secure communications protocols — Many ISPs offer secure
Web pages to let you read your e-mail remotely. Use those services
rather than an unencrypted connection through Outlook, Outlook
Express, or other e-mail client. Similarly, use only secure protocols 
to connect into your corporate LAN.
✦Encrypt your disk or individual ﬁles — Windows XP provides an
encrypted ﬁle system capability for that purpose, although you’ll
need to get a public key certiﬁcate to enable it, and must be using
NTFS. Strong encryption will keep all but the most sophisticated
attackers out, but it will keep you out too if you lose the key.
Upgrades
You need to recognize that there are upgrades you can reasonably do to a 
laptop, and upgrades you can’t. You can add memory, storage, and anything
hooked to a PC Card or USB port. You can add batteries (at least as spares you
carry, if not in the machine). You’re not going to change the processor speed
or make the bus faster, and you’re not likely to change the display (although
we’ve seen manufacturers offer trade-in programs to improve the overall
machine).
Assuming the upgrade you need falls in the doable category, you’ve got two
options. You can upgrade with a PC Card or USB device, which means you can
buy in a competitive market with multiple manufacturers, or you can buy spe-
cialized devices designed for your speciﬁc laptop. The latter are likely to be
more expensive with fewer options available, but in the case of internal large
disks or CD-ROMs, high-speed memory or internal batteries may be your only
choice. They may be your best choice, too, because the software in the laptop
will be tailored to know how to adapt to the new devices.
Summary
✦You’ll get fewer features in exchange for the reduced size and weight
of a laptop, tablet, or handheld device.
✦Limited battery power and the limitations of rugged, small packaging
constrain how fast your mobile computer can be and how much it
can store.
✦Battery technology will continue to improve.
✦You should consider both physical and communications security
with mobile computing devices.
✦Upgrades using standard interfaces, such as USB and PC Card, are
less expensive and give you more options.

What follows is the chapter “Home Surveillance
with Internet Remote Access” from our book PC
Toys: 14 Cool Projects for Home, Ofﬁce, and
Entertainment (Wiley 2003). Prior editions of the
PC Upgrade and Repair Bible included descrip-
tions of interesting uses people have for PCs, but
those applications have become so diverse and

implement your ideas with products already on
the market.
You don’t put kids under surveillance: it
might frighten you. — Garrison Keillor,
“Easter,” Leaving Home
Friends of ours built a retirement home some years ago
and became concerned about theft and vandalism while
they waited in another city to sell their old house and
move in. Being the sort to use technology to solve prob-
lems, they installed a Black Box VueMate Hub (catalog.
blackbox.com), to which they connected closed-circuit
television cameras. A long-distance call from their PC to
the hub gave them access to the cameras, letting them
monitor the site whenever they chose.
The unfortunate part of this story is that the VueMate
Hub goes for close to $700, plus the cost of cameras.
The long-distance phone bills to actually use the system
seem like chump change in comparison, and despite
spending all that money, they could access the cameras
only from a PC with the necessary software loaded.

Never Be Out of Reach
As with seemingly everything else, the Internet has revolutionized what you
can build for remote surveillance and security. Low-cost video cameras, driven
by the market for desktop video conferencing and webcams, have improved 
to where they generate reasonably high-quality video and provide embedded
video compression. Broadband Internet access offers both speed advantages
and a permanent connection to the Net, making it suitable for remote monitor-
ing. The global reach of the Internet means that you can monitor your home
from Abu Dhabi, if you happen to be there.
One of the things that tends to raise the initial cost of the Black Box unit is its
ability to multiplex four separate cameras. This is an important feature because
it’s impossible to monitor your entire home from just one camera unless that
camera is quite a way above the house. You can also increase the coverage you
get from each camera with a motion sensor and tracking camera base. You’ll
see how to set up these features in this project, along with how to integrate
your surveillance system with the Internet and access it from any computer
with a Web browser.
Sensors and Alerts
Figure 23-1 shows the organization of the overall surveillance system. We used
video cameras because they are inexpensive and widely available and also
because video cameras are easier to interface to a PC than a still camera. Most
video cameras can take still images, too. The system looks simple, consisting
of only the camera(s), PC, and broadband modem, but is difﬁcult to implement
because of the mismatch between the data rate from the video camera and the
uplink rate through the broadband connection. You could see as much as 4
MBps (32 Mbps) from each camera, yet a typical uplink rate is only 128 Kbps.
That’s roughly a 30:1 differential, which means you’re not going to be pumping
broadcast-quality video out to the Internet.
You have many options for using the available Internet bandwidth. For example,
if you’re working with still photos, you can:
✦Transmit on command
✦Transmit at set intervals
✦Transmit at set intervals whenever there’s motion
The still photos can be large or small, and can be compressed with lossless or
lossy compression — such as JPEG — if you really need to make them small.
360 Part VII ✦Integration

Video is much like a rapid succession of still images, so choosing your resolution
still matters. The video frame rate is similar to the interval between still photos,
with slow scan video referring to video at only a few frames per second. If you
get the frame rate high enough so that motion compensation can compactly
encode object motion differences between successive frames, video compres-
sion technologies — such as MPEG 1, MPEG 2, or MPEG 4 — are useable.
Figure 23-1: Surveillance system block diagram
Building and Using Your Surveillance
System from Kits
Our baseline design for the surveillance system solves the bandwidth problem
by using compressed still images triggered by motion in the camera ﬁeld of
view, and minimizes the number of cameras needed by following moving
objects with the camera. A tracking camera detects movement at a distance,
then keeps the moving object in the ﬁeld of view as it gets closer; the result is
that you need fewer cameras to cover the surveillance area.
Parts list
We expected this to be a difﬁcult project when we started to design it, largely
because when we had last looked at webcams they did nothing but capture a
small video image — no zoom, no tracking base, and no triggering when there’s
motion. However, our Google search for pan/tilt camera mount turned up nearly
18,000 hits. SmartHome was the ﬁrst hit (www.smarthome.com/7742.html), but
at $399.99 for just the camera mount, their equipment was impractical for this
project. More reﬁned searching (pan/tilt camera mount motion tracking) turned up
the TrackerPod robotic camera base and TrackerCam software from Eagletron
that, together with a webcam like the Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000, gave us a low-
cost system with strong capabilities. The parts we used are shown in Table 23-1.

Figure 23-2 is an overview of how the TrackerPod and a camera combine into a
surveillance system. The camera and TrackerPod both have USB connections.
The camera interface carries audio and video to the computer, and zoom, reso-
lution, and image adjustment commands to the camera. The TrackerPod inter-
face carries position information to the camera and pan, tilt, and LED
commands to the servo base. Under control of the TrackerCam software, you
can point the camera, record video and stills, upload to Web sites, and monitor
or control the camera remotely.

Dismount the camera from the base, then use a screw-in mount supplied with
the TrackerPod to attach the camera to the motion base, and form the assem-
bly shown in Figure 23-3. Be sure to install the software before connecting the
camera and base to the computer because the software installation supplies
the necessary USB drives.
Chapter 23 ✦You’re Going to Put That Where? 363
Powering the TrackerPod
The TrackerPod requires power from the USB port to drive the motors in the
base. The Dell 4550 computer we used couldn’t supply as much power to the
USB port as our model of the TrackerPod wanted, causing the TrackerPod to con-
stantly reset and the TrackerCam software to lose control. Eagletron has auxiliary
power supplies for the early TrackerPods to work around this problem and added
current limiters to the motor base circuits in a revised version to reduce the peak
draw. The TrackerCam software detects when there’s a power problem, giving
you this dialog box:
You’ll need an auxiliary power supply if your computer can’t supply enough 
power at the USB port.
Click on the ﬁrst button to bring up a Web page from which you can order the
necessary power supply.

Working with the TrackerCam software
Once you install and start the TrackerCam software (you’ll have to work through
several conﬁguration dialog boxes; the one to go online/ofﬂine can be canceled
for now) and connect the camera and TrackerPod, you’ll see the display on the
right of Figure 23-4 labeled Initial TrackerCam window.

Click the button in the lower left to open the options window and use the 
button next to the right edge of the display pane to make the display window
larger (see Figure 23-5).
The window that opens when you click on Tuner in the TrackerCam window
(lower left of Figure 23-5) is the interface you use to set up the enormous num-
ber of settings for TrackerCam. The defaults are reasonable, for the most part,
with the exception of left/right directions. If TrackerCam is set up correctly,
clicking on a point in the video window should slew the camera to make that
point the center of the image. If the base goes the wrong way, reverse the con-
trol direction. Do that by bringing up the tuner (not to be confused with the
Conﬁguration Wizard, which is what TrackerCam opens as the tuner when it
ﬁrst starts up and asks if you want the tuner) and then in the Display and
Camera section selecting Specify Field of View. On that page, make the existing
value for Horizontal FOV negative, and the controls will reverse direction. Click
on Enter FOV Values, and then test your work in the video window.

Live Internet surveillance
The easiest way to set up surveillance with TrackerCam is to enable the
embedded Web server and access live video with a Web browser. Figure 23-6
shows what TrackerCam video looks like in a browser. The video display
updates at the rate shown in the lower left; you can use the tuner to adjust the
update rate. Using TrackerCam across a LAN permits the full 30 frames per
second (fps), while you’ll have to throttle down the rate across the Internet.
The requirement to run at slow frame rates across the Internet rules out video
compression like MPEG-1 or MPEG-2, so TrackerCam uses JPEG compression
on individual frames.
JPEG compression outputs variable image sizes depending on the image reso-
lution, scene complexity, and compression quality setting. A typical 320×240
image shrinks to 3KB after JPEG compression (24 Kb), so you’d need 24 Kbps
for 1 fps. The bandwidth requirement scales with frame rate, so you need 48
Kbps for 2 fps, 72 Kbps for 3 fps, and so on. You might get 2 fps through a 56K
modem if you get a good connection; the 128 Kbps uplink common to ISDN,
DSL, and some wireless systems may support 5 fps. You’re using 720 Kbps for
30 fps at 320×240 resolution.
The Communication pane in Figure 23-4 lets you access the controls to turn 
on the embedded server for live video. Click on the rightmost icon in the pane
to get the dialog box in Figure 23-7 and turn on Put Me Online and, optionally,
Guests Allowed. After you make sure the IP address in the lower right is cor-
rect, the URLs at the bottom can be copied and pasted into Web browsers for
remote access. Disable guests and create user accounts unless you want the
camera images open to everyone or unless you’ve taken other access security
measures.

Cable/DSL Router Security and TrackerCam
You already know that you’re vulnerable to attack any time your computers are
connected to the Internet. One of the best ways to protect your computers from
attack is to use an external hardware router providing Network Address
Translation (NAT) because most of those routers can be set up to allow no unso-
licited access to your computers from outside your LAN. That’s the approach we
use (which is why our IP addresses you see in this chapter are sequences like
192.168.1.109), and the logs we get from our router make it evident we’re being
probed constantly. The problem with routers like the Linksys we use, though, is
that it takes some work to permit outside access when you want it.
This screen shot from the browser interface to our router shows how we set it
up for remote access to both TrackerCam and HomeSeer. The idea is that any-
time an external network request to access one of the indicated ports or port
ranges arrives at our router, it’s diverted to the internal address shown. We
turned on both TCP and UDP access rather than researching whether UDP is
needed in addition to TCP, but if you’re even more paranoid than we are you’ll
try the software with only TCP enabled and see what happens.
Use port forwarding on your router to direct incoming requests to a speciﬁc
computer.
In practice, though, we don’t leave any of those ports open on a regular basis —
we open them when external access is required and close them again when the
need goes away. We get from tens to hundreds of probes of our network every
hour, so it’s just prudent to keep the ports closed if they don’t need to be used.

368 Part VII ✦Integration
Recorded Internet surveillance
The problem with live surveillance is that if something happens when you’re
not looking, you miss it. TrackerCam lets you record surveillance images on
disk and access those images either locally from a computer with local or
shared network disk access, or across the Internet using a Web browser. Set
up surveillance through the tuner (click on the Tuner button in the main
TrackerCam window, Figure 23-5, then pick Surveillance — Capture Stills,
found under Communications. The conﬁguration page (see Figure 23-8) lets
you choose how often you save an image, how much disk space surveillance
may use, and when surveillance is active.
Figure 23-8: Use the Surveillance — Capture Stills page to enable 
still photo surveillance, deﬁne how often to capture an image, control 
disk use, and set times.
You can do more than simply position the camera and have it snap images.
For example, from the tuner contents section, choose Viewpoint Order in the
Tracking section. Deﬁne a sequence of viewpoints (places at which the cam-
era points) on this page (see Figure 23-9), and let surveillance visit the view-
points in sequence. The grid you see is a plane in front of the camera, so by
choosing a box, you specify both pan and tilt. Deﬁne viewpoints by clicking 
in the box where the camera should point; if you clear all existing points, you
can simply click all the viewpoint positions in sequence to create the path. If
you name them using the pane on the right, those names will show up in the
remote browser window and can be selected to point the camera. You can
deﬁne the times at which viewpoints are active, too.

Figure 23-9: Set up viewpoints to have the camera scan an area 
under surveillance.
Motion detection and tracking
You can also set up your system to recognize motion and start collecting
images when motion is present. The TrackerCam software has algorithms built
in to detect and follow motion in the frames received from the camera. Figure
23-10 shows the motion detection algorithm in operation. The white bounding
box in the ﬁgure shows the area of the image in which it has identiﬁed motion,
in this case because the dog had just turned around. You can set the threshold
for motion detection to be more or less sensitive, depending on the size and
speed of the motion you want to see or exclude.
Once TrackerCam detects motion and establishes a bounding box, it can use
that detection to trigger snapping a still image or motion clip. Basing your 
surveillance on motion detection helps eliminate recording useless images.
TrackerCam can also slew the TrackerPod to follow the bounding box, keeping
in the ﬁeld of view as the object in the box moves. Test the motion tracking
not only for sensitivity, but to check the speed at which the TrackerPod
slews — too slow, and it can’t keep up.
Detailed settings for tracking and motion capture are in the Capture Motion
page under Communication, shown in Figure 23-11. The top part of the right
column lets you enable or disable motion tracking (which is the same as the
Track button in the main window), and set the detection threshold. The rest 
of the right column sets the parameters for motion-based video capture.

Videoconferencing
One of the problems with desktop video conferencing is that the camera is so
close that if you move to one side to do something you’re out of the picture.
The TrackerPod solves the basic problem by being able to track your move-
ments, but because there are so many videoconferencing applications (including
CUseeMe and Microsoft NetMeeting), it’s impractical for the TrackerCam soft-
ware to include the equivalent of all those programs. Instead, TrackerCam
implements a “pseudo camera,” interposing itself between the actual camera
and any application wanting access to video from a camera. This feature makes
the motion tracking functions that are available invisible to the other applica-
tion, which simply thinks it’s getting a video stream from a ﬁxed camera.
The left-hand icon in the Communication pane in the options window starts
your videoconferencing application. The ﬁrst time you click on the icon you’ll
get a dialog box used to identify the application; after that, the application sim-
ply starts. Figure 23-12 shows how this works. TrackerCam is running behind
NetMeeting, while the identical image in both the NetMeeting and TrackerCam
windows shows you that they’re getting the same video feed.

camera, and you’ll have motion tracking from within NetMeeting.

Building a Surveillance System 
to Your Own Design
There’s really no end to what you can do with a home surveillance system. You
can start with the basic system we describe and enhance it to meet your spe-
ciﬁc requirements, or you can start with entirely different equipment and soft-
ware. The driving factors are what you want to accomplish and how much
you’re willing to spend.
Multiple cameras
You will need more than one camera if your objective is to watch your entire
house. You can easily tie multiple cameras to your PC if they’re webcams with
USB interfaces, but if you’re using standard composite video, you’ll need a PC
interface able to accept and digitize the analog video signal. One possibility is
the Webcam Corporation Model WCSP100-4, a PCI board accepting four NTSC
or PAL analog video signals. The board includes software to monitor the cam-
eras and give you a combined quadrant display of all four (see Figure 23-13).
You can watch the video remotely with a Web browser, and you can set up the
software to initiate video recording when it detects motion and to send you an
e-mail alert.

Long cables and wireless cameras
For the same reason that it’s hard to put full-motion video onto the Internet —
it’s hard to transmit lots of bits a long distance — the camera’s data rate
makes it difﬁcult for you to set up your cameras a long way from your PC. You
don’t always have a choice, though, so you may need to design remote cam-
eras into your surveillance system. The following sections discuss some of
your options.
Long cables
Many webcams use a USB interface into the PC, which would normally limit you
to keeping the computer in the same room as the PC. Eagletron, the maker of
the TrackerPod we used in the baseline design, makes an adapter that will extend
USB cables as far as 200 feet. At $160 for the 150-foot version, those adapters
(secure.eagletron.com/TCam/purchase/cart.php?Item=H2002E150) are
expensive, so you’ll want to be careful where you use them.
Wireless
One possibility is a wireless pan/tilt camera, but these are expensive too. The
X10 Vanguard is representative ($799.99 list; $499.99 special offer in early 2003;
see www.x10.com/products/vanguard_sg1.htm). Equivalent cameras we
researched were even more expensive.
You also have the option of a stationary wireless camera, such as the X10
Xcam2 ($79.99 at www.x10.com/products/x10_vk45a.htm). It’s an order of
magnitude cheaper, but you’ll need more cameras to get full area coverage.
If you already have cameras that produce standard composite video,
RadioShack makes wireless audio/video senders (catalog number 15-2572 at
www.radioshack.com) for under $100. These units transmit the composite
video plus stereo to the paired receiver; if your requirements are within their
range, which is affected by walls, metal, people, and other interference, they’re
small and simple.
Integrated home automation
You can combine video surveillance with home automation. The X10 Floodcam
is an example (www.x10.com/products/x10_vt38a.htm); it combines a wire-
less camera, ﬂoodlights, and a motion sensor, and transmits the motion indica-
tion to your X10 system for further response. The camera can be turned on
and off from the X10 system, too.
On a simpler level, the power supply for the stationary X10 Xcam2 will
respond to your X10 controls, turning the camera on and off.
Chapter 23 ✦You’re Going to Put That Where? 373

Archiving to removable storage
Security installations in which permanent storage of what’s recorded is neces-
sary often record the video to videotape. You could do that, but it’s difﬁcult 
to do if you’re using the motion tracking features of the TrackerPod. Instead, 
if you have a CD-RW or DVD writer, you could dump the captured ﬁles to 
optical disk. You could use one of the many available programs to make your
optical drive work like a read-write drive, then either write a program to 
dump directories to disk or use something like the Unison ﬁle synchronizer
(www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison). If you need control over the times
at which the application runs, consider using a Windows scheduled task.
Summary
✦The essence of surveillance is making images of interesting events
available remotely. As you dig into building a surveillance system,
you’ll grapple not only with the camera issues of resolution, image
quality, and ﬁeld of view, but also system control and communica-
tions bandwidth.
✦You’ll need to strike a balance among those characteristics if you
want to keep costs within reason.

Diagnosis
and Repair
T
his might well be the chapter you turned to ﬁrst
because one of the most common reasons people
want computer hardware help is to ﬁx problems. You
can certainly ﬁnd no shortage of people with broken or
unreliable computers. No magic prescription for ﬁxing
broken computers exists, though — just plodding,
methodical analysis to eliminate what is working right
until what’s left is the problem. Nor are all the methods
we look at in this chapter painless. Some involve strip-
ping all your data and programs off the disk and starting
over from scratch; others involve substituting compo-
nents (which gets expensive if you’re wrong about what
the trouble is). If you don’t have good backups plus the
master copies of your software, you could be in trouble
when — not if — your computer goes down.
Repair isn’t a very pleasant subject. Unless the problem
is as simple as cleaning dust out of the machine (fairly
common, actually) or reseating cards and cables, you’re
going to be swapping components and working with
low-level software.
Don’t be misled by the term repair, either. Actually
repairing a broken motherboard, adapter card, or drive
in a personal computer is beyond the tools and skills 
of most people. If there’s really been a hardware failure,
repairing a personal computer requires that you replace
the broken part. You can sometimes test your diagnosis
by swapping in replacement parts from another com-
puter, but if you have only one computer, swapping
components means buying components.
The good news, if you can call it that, is that most often
problems in running computers are due to software
problems. Once you get things set up properly and are
past the ﬁrst few months of operation, personal com-
puter hardware is quite reliable. Failures happen, but
nowhere nearly as often as software conﬂicts and
crashes. We’ve focused on hardware problems in this
book, but the isolation techniques we’ll cover can help
you with software problems as well.

There’s a lesson in that last observation — the most reliable personal comput-
ers are ones that people use, not ones that people ﬁddle with. Once you get 
a computer to where it’s stable, it’s likely to stay that way unless you install
new software or hardware, or change settings on software you already have
installed. We’re not saying you should never install new things or make system
changes — we simply want to warn you that it’s those things that are most
likely to create problems.
Basic Techniques
You have to do three things if you’re going to work on computer hardware
without doing more damage than good:
✦Control static electricity — You absolutely must eliminate static
electricity — electrostatic discharge (ESD). Voltages you can’t see or
feel can kill the chips in your computer.
✦Follow careful, well-deﬁned procedures — You get nowhere ripping
hardware (or software) apart, making random changes in the hope
something will work. You must have in mind a carefully thought-
through sequence of tests and changes. You’ll want to change only
one thing at a time, so you can isolate what causes different results.
✦Use the proper tools — We’re as guilty as anyone of using a vise grip
as the universal tool, but that’s not the right way to go about working
on computer hardware (we usually reserve the Vise Grip for plumb-
ing). The parts are relatively small and fragile, so you must have
tools appropriate to the job.
We discussed both static electricity and tools in Chapter 1 because they’re
terribly important — we wanted to make sure you didn’t miss them. If you
did skip that part, please go back and read about them now.
Mechanical Procedures
With the exception of blowing dust out of the case (see Figure 24-1), or out of
optical or ﬂoppy drives, or connecting and disconnecting peripherals, hardware
work involves taking the case of your computer apart. We don’t recommend
taking apart monitors (because of the severe high voltage safety hazards and
because there aren’t any parts inside replaceable without specialized training,
parts, and tools) or other external devices (because there usually aren’t any
user-replaceable parts inside). You might want to avoid taking apart a laptop
computer, too (again due to lack of replaceable parts inside).

You have to judge for yourself whether or not you think you can take apart
and reassemble your computer. If you’re reasonably skilled at mechanical dis-
assembly and reassembly, you have a good chance of being able to put the
machine back together in no worse condition than when you started, even if
you’ve never taken one apart before. Here are some guidelines to consider:
✦Power supplies — You can do no repairs inside a power supply with-
out a good understanding of power conversion electronics. You can
create a safety hazard by doing the wrong thing inside a power sup-
ply, so unless you’re trained to do electronics repair, don’t disassem-
ble or stick anything inside the power supply. The voltages in there
can kill you.
Power supply replacement, however, is one of the easiest repairs you
can do.
✦Disk drives — Don’t ever take a disk drive apart (ﬂoppy disk, hard
disk, CD-ROM, DVD, or any other kind). Removing one from a com-
puter (or adding one in) is a possibility, but you can damage a disk
drive irreparably by taking it apart. Not even the manufacturers
repair disks — Seagate tests failed disks to see what happened,
records the results for future quality-control analysis, and then
scraps them.
Chapter 24 ✦Diagnosis and Repair 377

✦Processor — Replacing a processor is easy because they’re all
installed in sockets. The most complicated parts of replacing a
processor are getting the right part, making sure it’s aligned properly
in the socket, and making sure it’s properly sealed to the heat sink
and fan.
✦Memory — Memory is on plug-in modules and is straightforward to
insert or remove.
✦Adapter boards — Boards that plug into your motherboard are
straightforward to remove and replace. Accelerated Graphics Port
(AGP) video cards have a unique retention mechanism you have to
disengage to remove the card.
✦Motherboards — Physically replacing a motherboard is largely a
mechanical job. The hard part is ﬁguring out how to reconnect all the
cables that used to go on the old board onto the new board and how
to set up the new board to work with your adapter cards and with
your software. Have a motherboard replacement done for you unless
you understand why these points are issues and know how to go
about solving them.
✦Monitor — There’s nothing you can do inside a monitor, LCD, or CRT,
and the voltages in a CRT monitor can kill you well after you’ve dis-
connected the power. The only repair you’re likely to make is to repair
bent pins on the data cable or degauss the CRT.
Disassembly tips
In all cases, be sure to follow good ESD protection practice and make a draw-
ing or take photos of the assembly as you disassemble. The drawing has to be
good enough to enable you to put the machine back together exactly as you
found it. The following sections cover some details you’ll want to be careful to
note.
Which slot is the board in?
Not all slots are equivalent. Some old PCI motherboards require you to desig-
nate which PCI slots are bus masters, which ends up differentiating one slot
from another. The sequence of boards in slots can matter for PCI cards because
of cross-board compatibility problems. Cable length limitations may restrict the
slots a card can go in. Cables may be required between two cards.
What cables connect to the card?
You can’t depend on cables inside a computer being capable of plugging into
only one place because cables for different purposes sometimes have the same
connectors. If you plug a cable into a socket other than where it came from
(and is designed to go), the best you can hope for is that things won’t work
right. If you’re unlucky, you can destroy a drive, adapter card, or motherboard.
378 Part VII ✦Integration

Some cables connect to more than one device. The cable from the ﬂoppy disk
controller can connect to two ﬂoppy disks. A cable from an IDE host adapter
can connect to two disks, a disk and a CD-ROM, a CD-ROM and a tape drive, or
other combinations of two devices. Make sure you know which connector goes
to which device.
It doesn’t generally matter which power cable connects to which drive, as long
as you’re careful not to stretch them beyond their length. No cables should be
under tension.
Where is pin number one?
Connection orientation is vitally important. Not all connectors have notches or
irregular shapes to ensure correct insertion, so cables can often plug in either
of two (or more) ways. The same results are likely if you orient something the
wrong way as if you plug something into the wrong place: Either the connection
won’t work, or you’ll destroy something.
It’s extraordinarily important that you get the orientation right if you have a
motherboard that uses an internal cable from the motherboard to USB
connectors on the front or back of the case. Get the orientation wrong, and
you can destroy the motherboard the ﬁrst time you connect a USB device.
Problems like these are why everything that disconnects inside your computer
is marked, and sometimes keyed. Data cables — usually ﬂat, wide ribbons of
wires — have the wire at one edge marked with a stripe, a different color (usu-
ally red), or some other distinguishing feature. The marked wire goes to pin
one on the connector. The printed circuit card should have numbering on the
face near the connector. Sometimes only pin one is numbered, sometimes pins
at both ends are numbered, sometimes all pins are numbered, and sometimes
there’s an obscure mark for pin one. Don’t take the connection apart without
being sure you can identify how to put it back together. The technical manual
for your motherboard — check the manufacturer’s Web site — will usually dia-
gram the connections.
Power supply cable orientation matters, too. ATX power supply connections to
the motherboard are keyed. Connections to disk drives (other than serial ATA)
use a standard four-wire connection that is keyed, but sometimes difﬁcult to
make ﬁt. Connections to 3.5-inch ﬂoppy drives are smaller, and keyed only by
skirts that descend from the side of the power cable connector. The skirts on
those smaller connectors are easy to defeat if you happen to insert the con-
nector upside down, leading to misorientation and drive failure.
Processor chips have a unique mark in one corner, and usually one pin that’s
different in the array of pins on the bottom. Processors will only go in the
socket one way, and you’ll bend pins trying to force one in any other way.
Memory module orientation is keyed by keys on the socket and corresponding
notches on the module.
Chapter 24 ✦Diagnosis and Repair 379

A number of twisted-pairs of wires run from the chassis to the motherboard
and sometimes to adapter cards. These wires connect to the speaker, keylock,
reset button, disk activity indicator, ATX power and sleep switches, and other
controls on the front panel. The twisted pairs will have one color that’s com-
mon to all of them, and another color that’s unique. Some (but not all) of the
pairs have to be oriented the right way when plugged in; these include the
pairs that connect to indicator LEDs and that supply power to the front panel.
A lot of different schemes for marking the connectors that the wires plug into
exist, so you’ll need to make a very careful drawing (and check it twice) before
you unplug anything.
Top-level disassembly
Be sure to disconnect your computer from the wall outlet before you start 
taking it apart. Power line voltages are dangerous, and you don’t want to risk
coming in contact with them. You may see other sources (including some ver-
sions of the A+ Certiﬁcation exams) that recommend you turn the power off
but leave the cord connected so you maintain a ground path. This is a really
bad idea because ATX power supplies aren’t ever really off if they’re connected
to a power source — they provide a low power 5 V supply to the motherboard
even when the system is turned off. You don’t want to be working on the sys-
tem with any power present because in addition to the safety issue, you could
damage components when you connect or disconnect them.
Cases open in many ways. Some require you to remove screws and take off 
the cover; others simply snap or slide open. However the case opens, open it
slowly so you can watch for cables or other components inside the case that
might catch on the cover. (For that matter, be equally careful putting the case
back on when you’re done. Crimped wires can result in damaged insulation
and shorted connections.) When you’re working inside the computer, be care-
ful not to dislodge connectors by accidentally pushing or pulling on cables.
Familiarize yourself with what’s inside once you open the case; take detailed,
close-up photos of all the connections if you want a good, permanent record.
You can identify most of the adapter cards from what plugs into them. For
example, the monitor plugs into the video card, your disk drives plug either
into the motherboard or a host adapter, external speakers usually plug into the
sound card, and the telephone line plugs into a modem. A CD-ROM or DVD can
plug into the motherboard or a host adapter.
There’s no completely general procedure for disassembly. Adapter cards usu-
ally have one screw at the top of the bracket, and you’ll need to disconnect any
attached internal or external cables before you remove the card. Disk drives
typically have screws at the side.
Use the same screws when you re-assemble the machine, without mixing
them up. Disk drives in particular often have limitations on how long the
screws into the side of the drive can be. If you use a longer one, you risk
cracking a printed circuit board, damaging a component, or shorting out
wires inside the drive. Don’t expect that to be covered by warranty.
380 Part VII ✦Integration

Put circuit boards and disk drives in anti-static bags after you remove them.
It’s a good idea to keep the bags the boards were shipped in for this purpose.
As a matter of practice, use a minimalist approach to taking things apart.
Disassemble what you must, but leave everything else alone.
Isolation Procedures
The most irritating thing we ever hear from tech support representatives is
when we’re told — without having explained the problem and the steps we’ve
taken to isolate it — to remove and reinstall Windows and see if the problem’s
still there. The most annoying case of this we had was when we’d called merely
to ask if the company’s Web server had moved to another address. It had, but
the tech support representative had to work from a preset script and couldn’t
believe that it wasn’t our computer’s problem.
Nevertheless, an important concept underlies that standard silliness, which is
that because PCs are complex, it’s hard to isolate problems. You make it easier
to ﬁnd the problem by simplifying the situation as far as possible. Removing
those ﬁles and reverting to a brand-new Windows installation accomplishes
that, so it’s part of many standard tech support diagnostic scripts.
We’re going to restrict the isolation and diagnosis procedures in this book to
hardware-related issues because adding in software problems would expand
what we need to look at to another complete book.
Rules of thumb
Here are the three concepts we suggest should guide you when you’re working
on computer hardware:
✦Occam’s Razor — Named after the 14th-century English philosopher
William of Occam, Occam’s Razor says, “Do not proliferate theoreti-
cal entities unnecessarily.” In the context of PC repair, that means the
simplest explanation that accounts for all the evidence is the one to
try ﬁrst.
✦Be observant and precise — Look carefully to see everything that’s
going on, and don’t jump to assumptions or generalizations that
aren’t warranted by what you observe. Know the details of the error
messages you see, and look around the point of failure for other indi-
cations. Look for patterns, including what events trigger the failure.
✦Have speciﬁc failures in mind — When you try to explain the prob-
lems you see, remember that usually only one piece of hardware will
fail at a time. If your analysis requires two failures, you’re likely to
have violated Occam’s Razor.
Chapter 24 ✦Diagnosis and Repair 381

Something else to keep in mind is to try to identify the last thing you changed,
be it hardware or software. That change has a high likelihood of being part of
the problem.
Observation and low-level isolation
The ﬁrst thing to do is to simply step back and look at what’s going on. Does
the computer light up as if it has power into it? What about the monitor?
Personal computers have a typical set of sounds they make as they start to
boot, including the memory test count up, noises from the ﬂoppy disk, and a
beep right before the operating system starts. Different or missing sounds can
be a clue as to what’s malfunctioning.
If the computer or monitor seems completely dead, check to make sure that
it’s plugged in, turned on, and that there’s really power at the outlet. We’ve
ﬁxed more than a few “broken” computers that way. Remember that the outlet
might have a wall-mounted switch, a power strip might be between the wall and
the computer, extension cords can be disconnected, and power strip switches
might be turned off or circuit breakers might be popped.
While you’re at it, check that the computer cables themselves are all plugged
into the right places and are seated securely. We’ve seen computer systems
that color-coded the cables and sockets. You can write on the back of the com-
puter with a ﬁne-point Sanford Sharpie marker to label what goes where, or
can use masking tape to write on (so you can change things when you upgrade
the computer).
The ﬁrst thing you see on the monitor as the system boots might be the ver-
sion and copyright of the video card basic input-output system (BIOS), or it
might be the initial display from the motherboard BIOS. Two other alternatives
are:
✦Error codes — You may see an error code on the screen. A common
one is the number 103, which usually means a keyboard problem.
(You can generate a 103 error code on many systems just by pressing
a key before the computer ﬁnishes resetting.) Check with your sys-
tem (or motherboard or BIOS) vendor for the meaning of the error
codes.
✦Beeps — If not enough of the computer is working to allow a screen
display (such as a memory failure in the ﬁrst bank) or if the video
card isn’t working, you’ll get a series of long and short beeps. The
meaning of the beep sequence is speciﬁc to the system, mother-
board, or BIOS vendor. Some motherboard manuals include the
explanation of beep codes in an appendix; if yours doesn’t, you can
try the Ultra-X Web site at www.uxd.com/postcodes.shtml, the
manufacturer’s Web site, or the manufacturer’s technical support
line.
382 Part VII ✦Integration

System unresponsive
If there’s no video and no beep from the system during boot (and — if it’s 
separate — you’re sure the speaker is plugged into the motherboard), check 
to see if there’s power from the power supply. If you can hear the disk drives
and fans start to spin and can see LEDs lit on the front panel, it’s likely that 
the power supply is working. If you’re skilled with a multimeter, you can check
this at the connectors where the power cables come into the motherboard.
Relative to any of the black wires, the red wire should be at 5 V, the yellow at
12, the blue at –12, and the white at –5. You can do a simpler check on a disk
drive connector: Relative to either of the two middle ones, the yellow wire
should be +12 V, while the red one should be +5 V. You have to have a load
such as the motherboard or a disk connected to the power supply to do these
measurements with the power supply connected to the motherboard or a hard
disk.
If there’s no output from the power supply, and you know the power line is
feeding power to the system, check these items:
✦Fuse — Some power supplies have externally replaceable fuses
accessible from the back of the computer. After unplugging the com-
puter, check if the fuse has blown, and replace it if so. If the replace-
ment fuse blows, something’s drawing too much power inside the
computer. You might need to replace the power supply, but you
equally well might have a short circuit in the power wiring within the
computer.
✦Power switch — A signal from the motherboard turns on an ATX
power supply. That signal in turn derives from the power switch 
connected to the motherboard, but is also conditioned by tests for
processor and memory compatibility on the motherboard. Check 
the connection to the power switch. Check for additional power
switches, too — some power supplies have a power switch on the
back in addition to the system power switch on the front.
✦Memory and processor — The power supply won’t start up without
the processor seated in its socket, and in some cases won’t appear 
to start up with a processor incompatible with the motherboard, or
with memory incompatible with either the motherboard or proces-
sor. If this is a new system or an upgrade — and has never started up
before — check compatibility again, and check that the processor is
in the socket properly.
If the power supply appears operational, try (with the power supply discon-
nected from the power source) removing all the adapter cards from the moth-
erboard, disconnecting power from all the drives, removing the memory
modules, and disconnecting the keyboard and mouse. Only the motherboard
(with the processor) should remain connected to the power supply. The point
of disconnecting everything is to simplify the test — in that conﬁguration, only
three replaceable components (power supply and power switch, motherboard,
and processor) could have failed. We’ve assumed that the problem here isn’t a
conﬂict between two cards; such conﬂicts rarely cause the system to be com-
pletely unresponsive.
Chapter 24 ✦Diagnosis and Repair 383

If the system still generates no beeps to indicate the processor is running once
you apply power and start the system, you have a failed motherboard, failed
processor, or a relatively subtle problem in the power supply. Substituting a
known-good power supply or processor are the simplest tests; unless the system
has been subject to overheating, the power supply is the most likely culprit.
If the motherboard does respond with beeps, however, the problem is in one of
the components you disconnected. You can isolate which one by adding them
back one by one and retesting each time. The last one you added before the
system stops responding again is the culprit. Remember to disconnect the
power before removing or adding cards. Once you ﬁnd the failed component,
replace it.
Monitor unresponsive
If the system seems to be responding properly (such as the right sounds as 
it boots, disk activity, and the Windows start-up sound) but there’s no video,
look at the screen closely with the brightness and contrast turned up all the
way. A completely dark screen could indicate no power to the monitor or a fail-
ure within the monitor. A scrambled image on the screen (or no image but a
visible background raster present) could indicate a damaged cable or connector,
or a failure in either the monitor or the display card. In either case, you can
isolate the problem between the monitor and the computer by trying another
monitor. If that ﬁxes the problem, you’ll need to either replace the monitor or
have it ﬁxed. Check the cost of ﬁxing the monitor before you decide to have
the repair done; the cost of CRT monitors is so low that the repair cost might
not be much different from the replacement cost, if you can ﬁnd someone to
do the repair at all.
Video operational during boot
If you can get video during boot, the system can help you ﬁgure out what’s
wrong. If you get an error message before the actual operating system start-up
sequence, then you need to identify what component the message refers to.
You ﬁgure that out by seeing where in the boot sequence the message occurs
in addition to reading the text of the message. The typical boot sequence goes
like this:
1. Video BIOS start-up — Even though the motherboard BIOS is active
before video BIOS start-up, nothing can show up on the screen until
the video adapter BIOS initializes the card. A message from the BIOS
might identify the card and date of the video BIOS.
2. Motherboard BIOS sign on — The motherboard BIOS identiﬁes
itself, including version, and may provide some conﬁguration infor-
mation about the system.
3. Peripheral device initialization — The BIOS initializes the devices 
it controls. This includes the IDE disks and CD-ROM, keyboard and
mouse, and the ﬂoppy disk.
4. Adapter card initialization — There’s a BIOS on some other adapter
cards (such as network adapters). The motherboard BIOS calls the
384 Part VII ✦Integration

adapter BIOS for each card. Adapters might display a message identi-
fying the product and the BIOS version. Some, such as disk controller
adapters, search for and identify devices attached to the card, too.
5. Operating system start — This is signaled by the initial message
from the operating system (such as “Starting Windows 98”) or a
graphical splash screen.
6. Hardware conﬁguration check and device driver load — As the
operating system loads, it checks the hardware conﬁguration to see if
it matches what’s expected, and loads drivers to control the hardware.
You can get an idea of where the problem lies from what’s going on in the
boot sequence when the problem happens. For example, if the BIOS
expects to ﬁnd an IDE disk but the disk is not responding, the boot might
hang (or stop for a long time) after the motherboard sign-on message.
Some versions of the AMI BIOS display a “WAIT...” message at that point;
your BIOS might be different. Similarly, if an adapter card sign-on message
is followed by an error code, you know that the problem lies with that
adapter or something else in the boot sequence after that adapter but prior
to the next message you normally see. It really helps in troubleshooting to
know precisely what normal behavior should be!
If the machine initializes normally but won’t boot, saying that it found no oper-
ating system and that you should insert a bootable ﬂoppy, you have one of
three problems:
✦Failed disk or host adapter — On some systems, the boot sequence
continues even if the disk drive is inoperative. At the point when the
BIOS tries to ﬁnd an operating system, you get the message that no
operating system was found because the BIOS can’t read the disk.
Problems with the power supply or data cables to the disk could
cause this, too.
✦Corrupted disk — If the contents of the disk have been scrambled,
the BIOS might not be able to ﬁnd what looks like an operating sys-
tem. This is one of the situations in which you’ll either be thankful for
good backups or wish you had them. (Before you panic, though, try 
a reset or power off/on cycle — we’ve seen a number of cases where
the hardware, which was in a bad state, was easily cured this way.)
✦No active partition — Among the information that the disk partition
table keeps are an indicator of what type of ﬁle system each partition
contains and an indicator whether or not a partition is active (that is,
bootable). A common mistake when you initially partition a disk is 
to forget to mark the ﬁrst partition as bootable. After you format the
disk and try to make it boot, you get the “No operating system” error,
even though you just put it there.
If you can boot from a ﬂoppy or CD-ROM, you can start trying to ﬁnd out 
why the hard disk won’t boot. Check if you can hear the drive spinning and if
there’s an activity light on the disk. Be sure to check the activity light directly
on the disk if there is one, and not the one on the machine front panel,
Chapter 24 ✦Diagnosis and Repair 385

because the light on the front panel sees status from the host adapter, not indi-
vidual disks. If the front panel light isn’t working, you know the disk isn’t seeing
commands. If the disk is broken or the cable damaged, though, the front panel
light can be on while nothing is happening at the disk. If the disk is operational,
look for software-related problems such as a scrambled ﬁle system.
Memory failures
Another possibility is that either the Power-On Self-Test or parity testing hard-
ware detects a bad memory location. If you have more than one memory bank,
such as if your motherboard can accept one to three SDRAM modules, you
might have some options, as is discussed in the list that follows. Some higher
performance Pentium 4 motherboards (such as the Intel D875PBZ you’ll see in
Chapter 25) have two banks of modules, however, and if they’re used in paral-
lel, both parallel modules will have to work.
✦Failed bank zero — The computer won’t boot if the ﬁrst bank of
memory (that’s either bank zero or one, depending on how your
motherboard is numbered) is bad. If you have two banks, you can
swap bank zero and bank one (or bank one and bank two if your
numbering starts at one). If the memory was in fact the problem,
swapping the two banks should move the problem to a higher
address (corresponding to the higher-numbered bank) and allow 
the computer to boot.
✦Failed other bank — If other than the ﬁrst bank of memory has
failed, you might have two choices: leave it in or take it out. Many
systems detect the failed memory, complain (and possibly require
you to go into setup and conﬁrm the new limit), and run. If yours is
one of those, you can leave the failed memory in; otherwise, take it
out. If your computer has more than two banks of memory, you can
relocate the removed bank to the end, making the most of the mem-
ory you have left.
Diagnostics
Observation and replacement only go so far unless you have a really well
stocked parts bin. Ultimately, you’ll want the ability to run a comprehensive set
of diagnostics to help isolate what’s wrong. We prefer to run diagnostics with-
out the full operating system loaded (such as from DOS) so there’s no interfer-
ence from device drivers and other software in Windows. You’ll want to make
sure you have an emergency boot disk so you can start the machine without a
hard disk running. We like bootable CD-ROMs for this purpose, because if you
have CD-ROM drivers in the boot sequence, you can load megabytes of diagnos-
tics and other tools on the CD-ROM well beyond what ﬁts on a ﬂoppy.
You have a surprising number of choices for PC diagnostics, including AMIDiag
Suite by AMI, QA+Win32 by DiagSoft, and QuickTech PRO by Ultra-X. All three
will locate and diagnose most problems associated with the major components
of your PC.

Problems in Functioning Machines
It’s much harder to ﬁx problems in machines that mostly work because, in
many ways, a dead machine is the easiest to troubleshoot. The range of things
that can have failed in a dead machine is limited, it’s easy to replicate the
problem, and it’s easy to tell when you’ve ﬁxed it.
Ignoring software-related problems, you’ll face three other kinds of problems
in partly functional machines, all of which can be much harder to solve:
✦Conﬁguration — You may encounter conﬂicts among devices for
resources (interrupts, direct memory access channels, memory
addresses, or bus slots).
✦Incompatibilities — Some hardware simply doesn’t work properly
with other hardware, even if both are installed correctly and no
resource conﬂicts exist. Incompatibilities can lead to instability and
crashes.
✦Something doesn’t work right — Even if the machine is stable, some-
times the hardware doesn’t work the way it should.
The next sections suggest how to approach repairs.
Conﬁguration problems
Much of what goes wrong in hardware is the result of two or more devices
wanting the same resources. The conﬂict can be over an interrupt, a direct
memory access channel, a reserved memory address, or a physical bus slot
(or combinations of these). Autoconﬁguration in the PCI bus helps avoid these
conﬂicts. Your best tool for ﬁnding conﬂicts, assuming you can get Windows to
come up, is the Windows Device Manager. The device drivers in Windows 9X
and NT/2000/XP report the resources they have assigned. Cross-checking the
assigned resources lets Windows ﬁnd out about conﬂicts, reporting the results
in the Device Manager. When the Device Manager ﬁnds a conﬂict, it ﬂags the
device with a yellow or red warning symbol. You’ll want to check what prob-
lem Windows is reporting (it might be something besides a conﬂict) and
resolve it if you can.
The reverse of the conﬂict problem is the case where a card doesn’t have the
resources it needs. For example, without realizing what we had done, we once
installed a PCI network card into an older motherboard that was incapable of
assigning interrupts automatically to the PCI bus. Until we realized that the
card didn’t have an interrupt, we had the odd situation where Windows auto-
matically recognized the card and installed the necessary software, but the
network wouldn’t work. The card worked in another machine (one with a BIOS
that assigned PCI interrupts automatically). We discovered the problem by
noticing that the Device Manager had no interrupt assigned to the card; after
we assigned an interrupt to the right PCI slot, everything worked properly.
Chapter 24 ✦Diagnosis and Repair 387

Some other conﬁguration problems and troubleshooting assets are under the
Windows 9X Performance tab (to the right of that for the Device Manager) or
the Windows 2000/XP Performance Options (on the Advanced dialog box tab
in System Properties):
✦Virtual memory — You don’t want to disable virtual memory in
Windows. You don’t even want to run out of space for the swap ﬁle
Windows uses to implement virtual memory.
✦Graphics — The accelerators (or their drivers) on some graphics
cards can cause trouble. You can progressively disable more and
more of the accelerator functionality using the dialog box behind the
Graphics button on the Performance tab of the System Properties
sheet. If this ﬁxes an unreliable system, see if the card manufacturer
can help you restore accelerated functionality. If the vendor won’t
help, or can’t, consider another manufacturer.
It doesn’t work right
The ultimate simpliﬁcation of your Windows installation is to format the disk
and reinstall Windows from scratch. As obnoxious as that is, an unstable system
is really a prime target for such drastic treatment. Make sure you have complete
backups — and test the backup — before you reformat, and make sure you
have the installation master disks and installation keys (if required) for all your
software. At the point you’ve rebuilt Windows (but before you start reloading
software), you’re assured you won’t have software-related problems due to con-
ﬂicts among third-party programs or due to incorrect old settings for hardware.
If the system becomes stable at that point, you can reinstall the rest of your
software (not from the backup — from the original versions) and reload your
data from tape. Try to exercise the system carefully after adding back each
application so you’ll be able to identify a problem as soon as it happens.
It’s difﬁcult to carry out a from-scratch rebuild if you intermix data ﬁles with
application programs because it’s hard to know which ﬁles belong to the
program and which to you. We recommend trying to keep the ﬁles you cre-
ate and work with in a place separate from programs for just that reason.
Most often, a malfunctioning machine won’t have the grace to simply fail out-
right. Instead, just certain things won’t work, and either won’t work at all or
will work randomly or erratically. This category is an enormous catchall, of
course, but in a lot of cases what seem to be hardware problems are really
issues with device drivers.
Another of the most important lessons in trying to troubleshoot complex mal-
functions is to get the people using the computer to be as precise as possible
when describing the problem. A complaint of “the modem’s broken” might
more precisely be described as “I can’t get e-mail, and when I try I don’t hear
the modem dial.” That more precise description should lead you to initially
check the phone line, cable, and modem.
388 Part VII ✦Integration

Observation is still a powerful tool when you’re trying to isolate speciﬁc failures
in functioning machines. For instance, if the CD-ROM doesn’t work, try putting
a disk in the drive, waiting a while, and then ejecting it. If the disk hasn’t turned
from its initial position, the drive didn’t spin. If the drive has power and doesn’t
spin, you’ll have to replace it.
Network Diagnosis
Just as your computers will fail periodically, you can expect your network to
fail, too. Many network problems are due to misconﬁguration of the protocols,
routing tables, or other conﬁguration data. Although TCP/IP conﬁguration and
troubleshooting is a book entirely to itself, troubleshooting your network hard-
ware is fairly simple (although potentially tedious if you have a large network).
If you have a small network, the manual procedures we’ll look at in this section
are sufﬁcient.
Don’t overlook that network problems can cause machines to seem to mal-
function, and machine failures can take down a network.
The fundamental problem with broken network hardware is that some sec-
tions of your network become inoperative or unreachable. The strategy for
ﬁnding the failure is to identify the point in the network that can cause the
symptoms you see. If necessary, you can isolate down to ﬁner-grained
symptoms by partitioning the network in half, dividing the broken half into
smaller and smaller halves until you isolate the failed component. You 
may have to disconnect parts of the network physically to isolate halves, or 
you may be able to get the insight you need by using the ping and
traceroute programs.
By far, the majority of network failures are due to cabling problems — bad con-
nectors, and shorted or open cable.
✦10Base-2 — The terminators and tee connectors in a 10Base-2 net-
work are particularly vulnerable to damage. A cracked, shorted, or
open resistor inside a terminator is rarely visible, but can be caused
by things like whacking the terminator against a wall while you’re
pulling cable, or by kicking the cable. Cracked insulation in tee con-
nectors can be equally bad and might not be apparent even if you
remove and inspect the connector. It’s easy to destroy a tee just by
pushing the computer back into a wall. The only certain way to
check a tee or connector is to replace it with a known good one and
see if that ﬁxes the problem you’re having.
✦10/100/1000Base-T and other hub-based wiring — The hubs and
switches in your network usually provide indicators on their front
panels to indicate operational and faulted status of connections, as
do the ports on your PCs. Between those indicators and selective
disconnection to isolate suspect subnetworks, you shouldn’t have
much problem isolating what’s wrong. That and speed are really the
big advantages of 100/1000Base-T.
Chapter 24 ✦Diagnosis and Repair 389

Poor modem performance caused by a noisy telephone line can cause your
network to appear to have failed. If you can hear noise on your phone line
(pick up the receiver and dial one number — other than zero — to stop the
dial tone), so can your modem. If you’re using a local Internet service provider,
they might be able to tell you how many retransmissions you’re getting, and if
the number is higher than usual for your area. As with all other problems, the
troubleshooting approach is to think through how the components related to
the problem work, list the ways in which their operation could fail, and test
those ways one by one.
Viruses
The onslaught is so great that at some time you’re likely to have to clean up a
machine infected with a virus. The key to doing that is to have a boot disk —
we recommend a CD-ROM — you can use to start the machine, load antivirus
scanning and disinfection software, and clean up the infected disk. Your
antivirus software is likely to come with directions on how to prepare an emer-
gency disk, but there are three issues you should think through in advance:
✦Virus deﬁnition updates — The virus deﬁnition ﬁles you scan with
are likely to be somewhat out of date because those deﬁnitions
change rapidly and no one has the time to keep remaking emergency
disks. Instead, you need a way to get the current version and load it
on demand. A second, clean computer can do that for you.
✦Windows NT File System — We recommend using the Windows NT
File System (NTFS) with Windows NT/2000/XP because it’s more efﬁ-
cient, more reliable, and handles bigger drives than the Win9X FAT
and FAT32 ﬁle systems. You must not boot the infected hard drive
because you could be spoofed by the virus, so you must boot from
removable media. Unless your antivirus software vendor provides
the necessary tools, you’ll likely boot DOS from ﬂoppy or CD-ROM.
DOS-based boot disks can’t read NTFS, but if you have NTFSDOS
(NTFSDOS Professional works from DOS and is at www.winternals.
com/products/repairandrecovery) you can.
✦Test — It’s too late to test your emergency disk and ﬁnd out it 
doesn’t work when you need it. Test it when you make it.
No standard way to remove a virus from your system exists — check what
your antivirus software vendor says to do for the speciﬁc virus the antivirus
scanner says you have.
Case Study: A Dead Machine
At one point, an older machine of ours failed. We’ve described the sequence 
of events leading up to the failure in this section, along with the steps for 
troubleshooting and recovery. Every failure is different in some way, so it’s not
our intent to deﬁne a cookbook troubleshooting sequence here. Instead, this
390 Part VII ✦Integration

section is here to provide some insight into the thought processes that can
help you repair machines.
Well before the time of the failure, we’d upgraded the system motherboard in
the generic mini-tower chassis. The system had been in operation for about a
year following the upgrade and was very stable. The ﬁrst indication that some-
thing was wrong was that the machine started to lock up randomly, with the
lockups happening infrequently at ﬁrst, but then more often. We made copies
of critical ﬁles at that point — we weren’t convinced that the machine was 
stable enough to back it up entirely, but wanted to make sure that the most
volatile ﬁles were safe.
One of the ﬁrst things we tried to isolate the problem between hardware and
software was to reinstall Windows on top of itself. That kind of reinstallation
(as opposed to an install on a reformatted disk) is a pretty benign operation —
it doesn’t take too long, little gets changed, and in many cases the operation
restores altered or corrupted dynamic link library (DLL) ﬁles and ﬁxes prob-
lems in the Registry. It’s a reasonable thing to try when you can’t pin down a
problem to any set of programs or operations before you progress to more
drastic measures.
It’s not an easy analysis whether lockups are due to hardware or software
problems — particularly with Windows — but since we knew that the software
on the machine hadn’t changed, it was worth looking into hardware issues
when the problem persisted through a reinstall of Windows. One of the ﬁrst
hardware issues we look for when a computer starts to act up randomly is
excessive heat. Fans that stop working or blocked airﬂow can raise the temper-
ature inside chips to beyond their rated limits. When that happens, the least
that’s likely to happen is that the chip will operate incorrectly — signals take
longer to propagate through hot chips, so critical timing is more likely to be
missed.
The ﬁrst hardware check we did was to check the power supply air outlet 
temperature. Do this with the back of your hand close to the air outlet for the
fan in the power supply. Use the back of your hand simply because it’s more
sensitive to temperature and air movement than the skin on your ﬁngers. We
noticed that there was relatively little airﬂow, and that the air was warmer than
we expected. Looking at the fan showed it was running, so we went looking for
clogged air vents.
We’d never looked closely at the air inlets in that chassis. What we found when
we looked was both surprising and disturbing — the only air inlet was a single
very narrow slit across the front of the case. That meant that under the best 
of circumstances, only a restricted amount of air could get through the case.
What was worse was that the slit was almost completely blocked with dust, so
there was almost no air at all moving. Vacuuming the slit clean restored rea-
sonably cool airﬂow, so we started the system running a looping series of diag-
nostics to exercise it, and after it remained stable for a day, we put it back in
operation.
After two weeks of stable behavior, the system failed to boot one morning. 
We were making coffee as it started, but when we returned to the machine,
Chapter 24 ✦Diagnosis and Repair 391

Windows had started partially and then hung. We couldn’t see anything else
remarkable, so we reset the machine and let it reboot. Operation resumed nor-
mally, but we left a note for people to watch the machine more carefully again.
Nothing out of the ordinary happened for a few days, but then the machine
failed completely. Powering on the system resulted in the usual disk spin up
noises, the fan ran in the power supply, and with one exception, the lights on
the front panel looked normal. Nevertheless, the machine did not even start to
boot — no video, no beep codes, no nothing.
The one exception to the front panel lights looking normal is that the power
light blinked rather than remaining on steady, with the blink at a reasonably
constant rate. Nothing in the documentation for the motherboard described
this behavior, so beyond noting the difference, we had no diagnostic informa-
tion. (In retrospect, we’re suspicious that the blink is indeed a diagnostic indica-
tion Intel’s built into the motherboard logic.) Using the approach we described
previously in this chapter under the “System unresponsive” heading, we con-
cluded that at some level the power supply was working, since we had lights
on the front panel and could hear the disks spin. We removed all adapter cards
and memory from the motherboard, disconnected the disks, and tried the sys-
tem. We received the same response — lights, but nothing else. Given that, the
problem had to be the power supply, the motherboard, or the processor.
We had a spare power supply in stock, but not a spare processor or mother-
board. We therefore temporarily replaced the power supply and tested the 
system. Nothing changed — the system continued to be inoperative. That 
test showed the problem was either the motherboard or the processor — it’s
unlikely both would have failed. We had to make some choices about how to
proceed — we could either start exchanging parts with another machine, taking
it down for the duration of the test, or else take our best guess as to which had
failed and order a replacement part. We chose to disassemble the other, work-
ing machine and swap processors. The machine wasn’t busy at the time, so we
didn’t inconvenience anyone, and making the test allowed us to be sure which
component had failed. The processor from the failed machine did not work in
the good machine; the processor from the good machine brought the failed
machine to life. That was conclusive evidence that the processor itself had
failed. In the process, we had the opportunity to power up the failed machine
with no processor whatsoever, and noticed that the front panel power light 
continued to ﬂash. With a working processor, the light remains on steadily.
Processors that have been in operation for as long as this one had are very
reliable, so we thought some about why the chip had failed before we reassem-
bled the system (including changing the processor speed setup on the mother-
board). The most likely causes of computer failure are static electricity,
overvoltage, overclocking, and heat. Since we hadn’t disassembled the machine,
we could most likely rule out static electricity. We run computers on a UPS and
within clock speciﬁcations, so we could rule out overvoltage and overclocking.
That left only heat as a likely suspect, and we knew that the machine had cool-
ing problems sufﬁcient to cause random lockups only a few weeks before the
failure. We couldn’t prove the cause of failure without sophisticated analysis 
of the chip, which we’re unequipped to carry out, but we believe we had sufﬁ-
cient evidence to draw a conclusion safely.
392 Part VII ✦Integration

An implication of the argument that heat killed the old processor is that there
might have been enough heat buildup to damage other components. For that
reason, we didn’t return the machine to service immediately — we set it run-
ning an endless series of motherboard tests, logging the results, and left the
machine alone for a period of a week. When it completed that time with no fail-
ures, we checked the ﬁle system for corruption, reloaded the one bad ﬁle we
found from backup, and returned the machine to service.
Summary
✦Your best troubleshooting tool is a planned, methodical approach
and careful observation.
✦You’ll want a good (small) set of tools, including protection from
static electricity.
✦You shouldn’t have to force anything. The bigger hammer approach
doesn’t apply to computer disassembly and reassembly.

Building an

B
uilding a computer from components — building
a desktop computer — proceeds in three phases.
You need to plan what you’ll put in the machine, assem-
ble these components, and then install software.
Hardware Planning
Planning which components you’ll use in your computer
helps you develop a parts list. You’ll choose each of the
components based on what you’ll use the machine for,
what you want to pay for the components, and how long
you expect the machine to be in service. The machine
we describe building in this chapter has the parts list
shown in Table 25-1.
Our design goal was to build a very high performance
PC, one suitable for intense ﬁrst-person shooter gaming
and DVD production, as well as more general applica-
tions, that would be quiet enough to be in the room
where people are watching TV or talking. The parts 
list for the machine is signiﬁcant for what it doesn’t
include — there’s no modem and no ﬂoppy — as well as
what’s in there.
✦No modem — It used to be we recommended
every machine have a modem, but the real 
signiﬁcance of that recommendation was that
it’s valuable to be connected to the Internet.
Unless you just can’t get a broadband connec-
tion, we now recommend you use broadband
to connect to the Internet, using an Ethernet
port in your PC and a hardware router. That
combination makes a modem useless in a PC
unless you need it to receive faxes.

✦No ﬂoppy — There’s really little value to ﬂoppy drives anymore, par-
ticularly with the inexpensive availability of USB ﬂash drives, other
than perhaps for system setup and repair. Although we did need a
ﬂoppy temporarily to set up the RAID drivers for this system, we
chose not to include a drive in the case.
✦Quiet case, power supply, and CPU cooler — The main sources of
noise in a PC are fans moving air and the case conducting vibrations
from fans and disks. Using larger, slower fans reduces the air noise,
while rubber bushings between vibrating parts and the chassis 
surfaces suppress vibration noise. The Antec P160 case includes
vibration-damping mounts for the rear fan and hard disks, while the
Antec TrueControl power supply includes a control to reduce the fan
speed to just what’s needed to keep the supply within acceptable
temperature limits.
When the system is idle, the Zalman CPU cooler (they call it a CPU
noise reduction system) keeps the processor under 40 degrees C
(104 degrees F) with the system in 21 degrees C (about 70 degrees F)
ambient air without creating signiﬁcant noise. Under load, the
processor still remains at about 50 degrees C (122 degrees F). The
motherboard itself contributes to reducing the noise, making do with
entirely passive cooling for the chipset and voltage regulator.
The liability of the Zalman cooler is that it signiﬁcantly exceeds the
maximum CPU cooling system weight speciﬁcation for the Intel
Pentium 4 processor and motherboard. You should not move the PC
when it will be subjected to shock or vibration without taking precau-
tions to prevent motherboard damage from the weight of the cooler.
✦Power supply capacity — At 550 W, the Antec power supply is large as
well as quiet, giving you the capacity to drive the auxiliary power con-
nection on the video card along with a full complement of disks and
memory. The supply lets you adjust the output voltages to set them
precisely or, if you know what you’re doing, to overclock a system. (We
strongly recommend against overclocking because overclocked sys-
tems are likely to be less stable than ones run within speciﬁcation.)
✦Huge monitor — The Sony LCD is huge, and ridiculously expensive,
costing more than the rest of the PC, but it’s crisp and has a large
image.
The more general issues guiding our choices were these:
✦Chassis and motherboard form factor — Few useful alternatives to
the ATX form factor exist. The new form factors emerging for small
PCs limit the heat dissipation, and so aren’t ideal for a very high per-
formance machine.
✦Processor — As of January 2004, the 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 is the fastest
Intel processor available with the exception of the Pentium 4 Extreme
Edition (which has a much larger cache but is far more expensive).
The processor was expensive when initially introduced; you might
choose to save money by picking a processor a notch or two slower
than the fastest available. We chose the Intel processor both as much
396 Part VII ✦Integration

because of the reliability and speed of the D875PBZ motherboard as
because of the processor itself.
✦Memory — We consider 256MB of memory a ﬂoor for new machines,
but suggest at least 1GB for high-end PCs. We used two matched DDR
SDRAMs, one in each channel, to enable the fastest memory access by
the motherboard. The 800 Hz system bus requires PC3200 memory.
✦Disk and interface — We used a pair of serial ATA disks to exploit
the RAID 0 striping capabilities of the motherboard, using the parallel
ATA ports only for the DVD writer connection. We used a large pair of
drives at that — 160GB each — to create a large disk for video work.
✦Video — As of January 2004, the ATI Radeon 9800 XT was the fastest
video card available. There’s a constant battle for performance
supremacy between ATI and nVidia, with all the beneﬁts coming to
the gamer.
We chose the manufacturers of all these components based on reliable past
experience. There’s no question it’s possible to assemble a machine with
equivalent speciﬁcations at lower cost using other components; we’ll simply
note that in our experience, quality components pay off in better reliability
and fewer problems.

Preliminary Mechanical Assembly
First off, we’re going to remind you again about the importance of an anti-static
wrist strap — any time you touch a board with electronic devices on it, you
need to use effective anti-static protection. If you don’t, you could end up with
some very useless equipment.
The ﬁrst step in assembling a computer is to perform the gross mechanical
assembly, mounting the disk drives into the chassis. You mount the power 
supply at the same time if you received it separately from the chassis.
Chassis layout and assembly
The Antec P160 chassis follows the standard ATX layout, with the power sup-
ply at the top rear, external bays at the top front, internal bays at the bottom
rear, and motherboard at the bottom rear. The back of the case includes a
noise-isolated fan, and there are provisions for another fan on the front. The
motherboard mounts on a separate, removable tray to simplify installation and
maintenance.
398 Part VII ✦Integration

Figure 25-1 shows the drive mounting bays from the inside. External 5.25-inch
drives mount on slide rails, while internal 3.5-inch drives mount on grommets
in vibration-isolated carriers. The screws you use to attach internal 3.5-inch
drives have a longer unthreaded shank to space the drive away from and avoid
crushing the rubber grommets.

Remove the front panel from the chassis before you start working. It removes
from the bottom towards the top and might be difﬁcult the ﬁrst few times. The
wiring to the front panel lights goes to the connector visible on the right in
Figure 25-1; the connector at the end of the front panel wires can be removed
from the chassis front so you can set the front panel aside.
The power supply mounts in the back of the case, as shown in Figure 25-2. The
rails and sheet metal forming the case are designed to cradle the power supply
while you screw it in place, but you have to watch that you don’t accidentally
crimp an output wire between the supply and the chassis. The TrueControl
power supply has a voltage adjustment control panel you mount in a 5.25-inch
external bay; we used the bottom one and left the cover plate in place to keep
curious ﬁngers from making unfortunate adjustments.

The chassis rear fan mounts differently than most fans, in that it uses ﬂexible
plugs to secure it to the chassis instead of hard mount screws, reducing the
vibration transmitted to the sheet metal. Figure 25-3 shows the fan in place on
the chassis back panel.
Mounting the drives
The next step is to install the DVD writer and the power supply control. We put
the writer in the topmost external 5.25-inch bay, but you can use any of the
available bays in the chassis. You attach slides to the drive and then ease the
assembly into the chassis from the front.
After that’s complete, mount the disk drives in the vibration-isolating carriers
(make the screws snug in the grommets but not overly tight) and snap the car-
riers into the chassis (see Figure 25-4). We placed the drives in the middle two
slots so the airﬂow from the front of the chassis would ﬂow right over the drives
for cooling. The label on top of the drive may have important information — for
parallel ATA drives, for example, it’s likely to have all the information you need
to conﬁgure jumpers and ﬁgure out which end of the data connector has pin 1
(it’s often the one closest to the power connector).

Installing the Motherboard
The chassis provides a removable tray for mounting the motherboard. Take
the tray out of the chassis and then replace the generic ATX I/O panel supplied
with the chassis with the custom one that comes with the motherboard. The
removable motherboard tray really simpliﬁes assembling and maintaining the
system because you can get to the mounting positions without having the chas-
sis box in the way. ATX chassis secure the motherboard with threaded metal
clips or (better) solid metal standoffs that attach to holes in the tray. You want
to use a standoff in each hole in the tray that lines up with one of the metal-
rimmed holes in the motherboard (see Figure 25-5) — the Intel D875PBZ moth-
erboard uses 10 of them.

Figure 25-6 is an outline drawing of the Intel D875PBZ motherboard showing
the processor location and the internal power, data, and control interfaces.
There are no jumpers to set on the board because it detects and sets proces-
sor speed and voltage automatically. As it is, there is only one jumper on the
board to cause the BIOS to boot into a special conﬁguration mode, from where
you can set any of the BIOS parameters.

connectors to make sure the outside connector shield grounds to the chassis.
Some of the ﬁngers have to slide onto one side of the connector, such as the

Installing the processor
We recommend installing the processor on the motherboard after mounting
the motherboard in the chassis. For the Antec case, that recommendation
translates to mounting the processor after attaching the motherboard to the
tray, but before sliding the tray into the chassis.
The Intel D875PBZ motherboard comes with the heat sink bracket and proces-
sor socket attached. Figure 25-8 shows the processor socket — note speciﬁcally
the two missing pinholes in the upper-left corner of the photo. The processor
(see Figure 25-9) has corresponding missing pins so you know which way to
orient the processor when you place it in the socket. Installation consists of
raising the lever just visible at the top of Figure 25-8 so it’s straight up, drop-
ping in the processor, and closing the lever. The processor should drop in with
no force, and should be ﬂush against the socket on all sides. If not, then either
the lever’s not all the way up, you’ve turned the processor the wrong way, or
there’s a bent pin on the processor.

Chapter 25 ✦Building an Extreme Machine 405

Prepare the processor by spreading a very thin layer of thermal grease on the
top of the processor, as in Figure 25-11. Use a ﬂat, stiff edge, such as the edge
of a credit card, to spread and thin the thermal grease. Your goal is to have a
very thin, smooth layer — the grease just ﬁlls holes that block heat transfer. If
you get more than a very thin layer, or leave gaps, and you’re likely to impede
heat ﬂow and cook the processor.
Figure 25-11: Thermal grease on processor

Slide the spanning brackets supplied with the cooler in place between the
posts on the motherboard heat sink attachment bracket, then place the Zalman
cooler on the processor, and screw it down onto the spanning brackets (see
Figure 25-12). Use the inner two holes on the cooler itself to feed the screws to
the spanning brackets and tighten the screws on either side of the cooler alter-
nately until they’re snug.
We oriented the cooler so its fan wires pointed towards the edge of the moth-
erboard, then ran the wires counterclockwise around the base of the cooler,
and plugged them into the processor fan connector.

Inserting the memory
The last step before installing the motherboard tray back in the chassis is to
insert the DDR DIMM memory strips. The Crucial Web site has tools to help
you ﬁnd compatible memory, but you’ll nevertheless want to read your moth-
erboard documentation to see if there are restrictions on the order in which
you populate memory sockets and to make sure you use a memory conﬁgura-
tion that gives you maximum performance. In the case of the Intel 875 chipset
on the D875PBZ motherboard, using matched pairs of DIMM strips in both
memory banks takes advantage of the dual channel memory interface and
enables what Intel calls dynamic addressing mode, which gives you faster
memory access. Installing the pair of 512MB DIMMs we showed in the parts
list, one per channel, meets both criteria.

Figure 25-13 shows the DIMM strips installed in the D875PBZ motherboard, one
in slot zero of each bank. The sockets and DIMM strips are both keyed, so you
can insert the memory only one way into the socket. Be gentle inserting the
strips to minimize the stress on the motherboard itself.
Figure 25-13: DIMM strips in the memory sockets

Once you insert the DIMM into the socket, you’ll be able to close the latches
completely. If you don’t get the memory in the socket properly, the BIOS won’t
see it when you boot the computer. The latches should ﬁt all the way into the
notches on the DIMM strips.

Secure the motherboard tray back into the chassis. Fit an adapter card into 
the motherboard as a pathﬁnder, and screw it to the card bracket panel — the
card helps set the ﬁne position of the motherboard before you tighten the
motherboard mounting screws. We typically mount two cards, one at either
end of the slots, to avoid misalignment due to pivoting around a single card.
Once you’ve inserted the adapter cards and tightened up the card brackets,
gently tighten all the motherboard mounting screws.
Cabling in the power supply
Next, wire the power supply to the connectors on the motherboard. Figure 25-14
shows the main ATX power supply cable in place (the photo is not of the D875PBZ
motherboard). Plug in the ATX auxiliary 12 V cable, too, and then route them both
temporarily in the chassis to keep them out of the way while you work.
Figure 25-14: Main ATX power supply cable
©2004 Barry Press & Marcia Press
Chapter 25 ✦Building an Extreme Machine 409

The power supply includes — separate from the 12 V cable to the mother-
board — a fan output cable that has only 12 V (yellow and black) wired. Don’t
use it for anything but fans because disk drives, the video card, and other items
require the 5 V supply, too. The power supply also connects to the disks, the
chassis front panel via a disk-like connector, and (because it came equipped
with a disk drive–style power connector) the rear panel fan. The Antec power
supply doesn’t have serial ATA disk drive power connectors, so you have to
use adapters like the one shown in Figure 25-15.
The Antec TrueControl power supply includes a fan-like three-pin output con-
nector you can plug into the motherboard to let its fan speed sensors measure
the power supply fan speed. We connected it to the rear panel fan connector
on the motherboard.
Figure 25-15: Serial ATA disk drive power adapter
©2004 Barry Press & Marcia Press
Having made all the power supply connections, dress the wires out of the way
and secure them with cable ties. It’s mandatory that you keep the wires out 
of the airﬂow paths, and highly desirable that you keep the wires away from
where you need to be working. If you’re using a chassis with a transparent side
panel, you’ll want to make the wiring as invisible as possible.
410 Part VII ✦Integration

Wiring the chassis to the motherboard connectors
Now, wire the chassis to the motherboard connectors. Figure 25-16 shows part
of the motherboard, with callouts showing the front panel connectors. You’ll
wire up the power switch, reset switch, hard disk activity LED, and power LED
to the pairs of pins shown in the photo (the information about which pin does
what is stenciled on the motherboard near the header and is in the mother-
board manual). For each pair, the colored wire is usually the one to install 
closest to pin 1, although the orientation matters only for LEDs and not for
switches. You won’t hook up a speaker because there’s already a speaker-like
device mounted on the motherboard.

The wires from the front panel tie to connectors in pairs corresponding to the
pairs in Figure 25-16. Figure 25-17 shows the completed connections, along
with the USB front panel cable. The USB cable connector is one piece, laid out
to match the header on the motherboard, and keyed to keep you from turning
it the wrong way. If you’re using a different motherboard or case, check the
front panel USB wiring carefully because if you get it wrong you can damage
the motherboard.

Final Cabling
At this point, you’ve built up the chassis and drives, installed the processor
and memory, mounted the motherboard in the chassis, and cabled the chassis
to the motherboard. The only wiring that’s left is to hook up the data cables.
Figure 25-18 is a close-up of the ﬂoppy disk and IDE connectors on the
D875PBZ motherboard. If you look at the photo closely, you can see the labels
on the motherboard, such as the one for the primary IDE port. Pin 1 is on the
left for all three connectors. Set the jumper on the DVD writer to be the master
and then cable the primary IDE connector to the drive.

The serial ATA drives each connect directly to a port on the motherboard —
one drive ties to each port. It doesn’t matter which drive goes to which port,
since they’re the same. The serial ATA connectors are keyed so that you can’t
put them on backwards. Figure 25-19 shows the completed power and data
cable wiring near the motherboard.

issues from the video card.

Planning Your Software
You have four steps to accomplish to install software on your desktop com-
puter once it’s built. Here are the steps:
1. BIOS update and conﬁguration — You need to set up the BIOS to
reﬂect your hardware and OS and might need to update it to the
manufacturer’s latest version.
2. Disk conﬁguration — You then enable the RAID capability to
increase performance and make the pair of drives appear as a single
device.
416 Part VII ✦Integration

3. RAID drivers — You install Windows from CD-ROM, but the disk
doesn’t contain the driver you need for the RAID array, so you need
to have them ready to load separately.
4. OS installation — After all those preliminaries, you can install the
operating system.
We installed Windows XP Professional on this PC. We detest Microsoft’s
Windows Product Activation — and all Digital Rights Management (DRM)
schemes in general — because DRM assumes the consumer is a criminal and
takes away legal consumer rights. Nevertheless, we show you how to install
Windows XP on this PC because it manages the hyperthreaded processor and
RAID array better than prior Windows versions.
Conﬁguring BIOS
Hook up a keyboard, mouse, and display; plug in the computer and display
and power them on. We suggest you power the display on a minute before 
the computer so you’ll see everything on the display output by the computer.
Listen carefully to the computer as it powers up. Normal sounds include the
power supply and other fans, disks spinning up, and the starting beep from the
speaker. Abnormal behavior includes the absence of those sounds or the pres-
ence of beep codes from the speaker. Follow the instructions in Chapter 24 if
you don’t get the normal sounds, or if you don’t get a normal BIOS startup dis-
play on the monitor.
Once the BIOS shows onscreen, quickly push the F2 key to get the BIOS setup
screen. Other motherboards use different keys; Del (Delete) is common on
boards using the AMI BIOS. We’ve also seen systems using Control+Alt+S or
some other combination. The documentation that came with the computer 
or motherboard should tell you the combination if it’s not apparent onscreen.
Check the BIOS version, and if it’s not the current version from the manufac-
turer, update it now before you start conﬁguring and installing software. You’ll
have to use the standalone BIOS update (and a temporary ﬂoppy disk drive)
since you don’t have Windows running yet.
The Intel D875PBZ BIOS has fewer manual conﬁguration settings than many
other boards. Once you enter the BIOS, the top-level menu has choices for
Main, Advanced, Security, Power, Boot, and Exit. We describe the key BIOS set-
tings using notation like Main ➪Hyper Threading Technology to indicate the
path through the menus to the setting we’re describing. Here are the most
important settings:
✦Main ➪Hyper Threading Technology — The 3.2 GHz processor
implements hyperthreading, which lets it appear like two processors
and gives you as much as a 25 to 30 percent performance boost. This
setting has to be enabled to turn the second processor appearance on.
✦Advanced ➪Boot Conﬁguration ➪Plug & Play O/S — Turn this on
unless you’re running Windows NT 4 or another operating system
that does not support Plug and Play (PnP) device conﬁguration. The
Chapter 25 ✦Building an Extreme Machine 417

difference the option makes is to control whether the BIOS sets up
resources for PnP cards or leaves the work for the operating system.
✦Advanced ➪Drive Conﬁguration — On other motherboards, this is
where you’d conﬁgure IDE (parallel ATA) drives, although in nearly
all situations you’ll just use automatic conﬁguration. More important
for this machine is the Advanced ➪Drive Conﬁguration ➪ATA/IDE
Conﬁguration setting, which you have to set to Enhanced to enable
the serial ATA ports, and the Advanced ➪Drive Conﬁguration ➪Intel
Raid Technology setting, which you must enable to set up the two
serial ATA disks as one striped set. Once you enable that last setting,
a reboot will show the RAID conﬁguration BIOS screen.
✦Advanced ➪Video Conﬁguration ➪AGP Aperture Size — AGP
video boards get an address space allocated to them of up to 256MB,
the size of which is independent of the actual memory on the board.
Some boards give better performance with one setting than another.
The best way to determine the right setting is to check the video card
manufacturer’s recommendation. If you can’t ﬁnd one (check the
Web site, too), set it to the closest value to the actual video memory
on the card. If you have to guess, test video performance in several
3D applications or games for different aperture sizes and choose the
fastest one.
✦Advanced ➪USB Conﬁguration — You’ll want to make sure High-
Speed USB is enabled so you can use USB 2.0 devices. Also under
here is Legacy USB Support; be sure to enable that option if you have
a USB mouse or keyboard, so they’ll work if you boot into the BIOS,
an emergency recovery disk, or an operating system without USB
support. We left the USB 2.0 Legacy Support option at Full-Speed to
make sure the USB 1.1 keyboard and mouse we use have no conﬁgu-
ration issues.
✦Advanced ➪Fan Control Conﬁguration ➪Fan Control — Enable
this to let the system control fan speed as it manages temperatures.
✦Boot ➪Silent Boot — By default, the D875PBZ BIOS displays a
graphic logo instead of the more useful BIOS startup messages, even
though the F2 key still works to enter BIOS setup. Change this setting
to Enabled to see the boot messages.
Once you’ve ﬁnished setting up the BIOS, save your settings and exit. The sys-
tem will then reboot.
Conﬁguring the Disk and Installing
Windows
Upon reboot, you’ll see a new BIOS screen giving you the ability to con-
ﬁgure the serial ATA RAID capability. Press Ctrl+I to enter the RAID BIOS and
then choose to create a RAID volume. We simply chose to use all of both
installed serial ATA disks and took the recommendation for 128K blocks as
418 Part VII ✦Integration

being suitable for a workstation. Save the settings and exit, and the system will
reboot again.
You’re ready to boot the CD-ROM and start the Windows XP install at this point
with one exception, which is that Windows XP does not include the device
driver required to use the RAID array. Windows XP does, however, provide a
mechanism to load additional drivers as the installation CD-ROM starts up, but
is so brain dead that it can load those drivers only from a ﬂoppy. Because we
didn’t want a ﬂoppy drive in the machine, we temporarily cabled in one until
Windows XP ﬁnished installing and then disconnected it the next time we
turned off the machine. You tell Windows XP Setup to load the driver by press-
ing F6 (watch the message bar at the bottom for when), so Intel calls the driver
ﬁle you need the SATA RAID: F6 Driver Disk. You can download the ﬁle from the
Intel D875PBZ motherboard site, and speciﬁcally from www.intel.com/design/
motherbd/bz/bz_drive.htm. Download the ﬁle and run it on another PC (one
with a ﬂoppy) — the program unpacks the data, wipes the ﬂoppy you gave it
clean, and writes the necessary ﬁles. Insert that disk in your temporary ﬂoppy
drive when Windows XP Setup asks for it.
You’ll partition and format the hard disk as part of Windows XP Setup. Partitions
divide the space on the drive into areas where you can place ﬁle systems, most
always corresponding to drive letters for Windows. (UNIX doesn’t use drive let-
ters because it collects ﬁle systems on various partitions into named branches
rooted into a tree.) Windows NT/2000/XP work best using NTFS (NT File System),
so choose that when Windows XP Setup asks you what type of partition you
want to create. Continue to follow the rest of the Windows XP setup instructions
to complete OS setup.
Checking Your Conﬁguration
Select the Device Manager tab in the System applet, and look for yellow or red
icons that indicate problems. If you ﬁnd problems, check under the properties
of that device for clues as to what the problem is and what corrective action
you need to take. Devices you ﬁnd shown as unknown indicate that you proba-
bly need to install a manufacturer-supplied driver. Start with drivers unique to
your motherboard and then add drivers for adapter cards and other peripher-
als as required.
For each of your devices, check the manufacturer’s Web site for more current
drivers for your operating system. You’ll want to do that periodically, but be
sure to evaluate new drivers before putting them on machines used for pro-
ductive work.
Installing Applications
Once Windows is up and stable, you can go ahead and install applications, the
ﬁrst of which should be a good antivirus program. We usually let programs
install to their default directories unless that’s \windows, in which case we
Chapter 25 ✦Building an Extreme Machine 419

force the installation elsewhere to keep the application ﬁles separate. We
strongly recommend that you set up your applications (or discipline yourself
while you work) so that your data ﬁles are not in the same directory as the
application, because when you go to upgrade or uninstall a program, you may
ﬁnd that having the ﬁles intermixed with the application makes it hard to ﬁg-
ure out which ﬁles are yours and which are part of the program.
The ﬁrst thing to do once you have the bulk of your software installed is to
defragment the disk. You can access this function by choosing Start ➪
Programs ➪Accessories ➪System Tools ➪Disk Defragmenter. Windows will
likely complain that the disk doesn’t need to be defragmented, but force it to
run anyway. If you look at the detailed display from the disk defragmenter pro-
gram while it runs, you’ll see that a lot of empty space is interspersed with
your ﬁles. Although Windows is telling you that the ﬁles themselves are not
fragmented, which is probably true, it isn’t looking at how fragmented free disk
space is. By running the defragmenter now, you close up that empty space and
help keep the work you do later from fragmenting.
Summary
✦Assembling a computer in the right order makes things simpler and
avoids damage to more fragile components. Assemble the chassis,
drives, motherboard, processor, memory, and internal cables in that
order.
✦Depart from most computer users’ standard practice — read the 
documentation for your hardware components carefully, looking for
detailed steps you need to accomplish and for limitations on what
you can do.
✦Assembling a computer isn’t really that hard — planning what you’re
going to build, having a basic understanding of the components, and
taking a careful approach to component selection are the keys to 
success.
✦Check the Internet to be sure your device drives are the latest ones.
✦When things go wrong, use the basic troubleshooting pattern —
simplify and isolate.
