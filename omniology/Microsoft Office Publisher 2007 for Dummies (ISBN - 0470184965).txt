Authors’ Acknowledgments
Jim: I want to acknowledge the efforts of the many people who made this book
possible. In particular, thanks to Kyle Looper, for giving me the opportunity to
write this book, and to Paul Levesque, for taking my random jumble of
thoughts, words, and phrases and turning them into a real book.
A special thanks to Ric Caldwell for allowing me the flexibility in my schedule
to take on this project.
Jacqui: Working on this book has been very exciting and I especially thank
Kyle Looper and Paul Levesque for taking a chance on a relatively untested
writer. I also want to thank my managers and colleagues at my ‘day job’ for
their support and for giving me time to contribute to this book.
Thanks also to Tony (my dad) and Toni (my sister), to my husband Jay and

Introduction
W
elcome to Microsoft Publisher 2007 For Dummies. If you’ve never used
desktop publishing software and really aren’t much interested in
becoming an expert at it, congratulations! The book you hold in your hands is
an excellent choice: It can help you complete your current project quickly —
and with the least effort possible. (I’m pretty good at that “least effort possible”
stuff. Just ask our editors.)
Many computer users simply don’t have the time or resources to become
experts on all the complicated software programs they use. Oh, sure, some 
of you like to spend your spare time learning the most minute details about
the software you use — We won’t mention any names, Kevin — but most of
us are content to learn just enough to get the job done in an efficient manner. 
We don’t want to read page after page of esoteric information, presented by
some computer books, that doesn’t pertain to the job at hand. If you want 
to know a simple answer to a single question about desktop publishing with
Microsoft Publisher 2007, this book is for you.
Microsoft Publisher 2007, designed for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows
2003 Server (Service Pack 1 required), and newer operating systems, is an 
inexpensive desktop publishing program. In fact, if you purchased any of the
following versions of Microsoft Office 2007, you already own it: Microsoft 
Office Small Business 2007, Microsoft Office Professional 2007, Microsoft Office
Ultimate 2007, Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2007, or Microsoft Office
Enterprise 2007. You use this program to create professional-looking marketing
materials — brochures and flyers, for example — as well as Web pages.
Even though Microsoft Publisher 2007 is low priced ($169 for a full-package
version or $99 to upgrade from a previous version), it’s definitely not under-
powered. You can do things with Microsoft Publisher 2007 that a few years
ago would have made the big boys (you know, those expensive desktop pub-
lishing programs) sit up and take notice. For example, you can create publica-
tions automatically by using the wizards in Microsoft Publisher (something
that you can’t do with your Quirks and PageMonsters). You can freely borrow
any of the professionally designed templates from Microsoft Office online —
and customize it to your heart’s content. You can even personalize the con-
tents of your publications so that each of the 10,000 recipients thinks you 
created a document expressly for him or her.

We want to carry on with the For Dummies tradition and help you have fun
with Microsoft Publisher 2007 as you use this book. After all, if a 5-year-old
can find happiness with a set of crayons, you should be able to find bliss with
all the bells and whistles that you’ll uncover in Publisher 2007! We do have to
warn you that creating a wealth of publications might prove hazardous to the
front of your refrigerator, because you’ll want to share your artistic achieve-
ments with your significant others.
About This Book
You can read this book from cover to cover, but you don’t necessarily have
to; you can use it as a reference book. When you need to know something
about a particular aspect of Microsoft Publisher 2007, just jump to the appro-
priate section and read about it. And don’t worry that you’ll feel lost if you
start on page 231 rather than on page 1; most chapters are self contained, 
so you can dip your toes in at any point.
If you’re curious about what you might find, here are some typical sections
you might stumble across:
 You Want Fast? Well, Meet Mr. Wizard
 Things You Can Do with Files
 Keeping Good Margins
 Hide and Seek: Find and Replace
 Collecting and Using Type
 How Color Improves Your Page
 Printers and Output Quality
The information you need to know is in this book. Don’t bother memorizing
the contents, and don’t even think about using this book to learn Microsoft
Office Publisher 2007. What you find in this book is only the information that
you need to get your work done. Because we tend to babble on, from time to
time we post a Technical Stuff icon (which features the For Dummies guy —
check out the margin) to warn you in case you want to ignore our rantings.
Conventions Used in This Book
Because this book is a reference, you can look up a topic of interest in the table
of contents or in the index, in the back of this book. These tools refer you to
the sections that talk about that topic. If you need to know something specific
in order to understand a section’s content, we tell you so. We know that
2
Publisher 2007 For Dummies 

computer technology is loaded with confusing words and phrases and tech-
nobabble. (Sometimes we can’t avoid slinging this stuff about like a short-
order cook in a cheap diner.) But in some cases, we may send you off
elsewhere to help you figure out the confusing terms.
We like to give you examples of how to do something. Because Microsoft
Publisher 2007 is a Windows-based program, most instructions tell you to
“click here” or “click there” or to “choose File➪Print from the menu” or
“press Alt+F,P on the keyboard.” Notice two things about these instructions:
First, the File➪Print business is our shorthand way of saying “Open the File
menu and then choose Print from the choices that appear”; second, we show
you that you press and hold the Alt key while you press the F key, by placing
the plus sign (+) sign between them. Then you release both keys and press
the P key. This keyboard combination produces the same action as using
your mouse to choose the menu command. It’s all standard Windows fare.
If we want you to enter information from your keyboard, you may see a line
that looks like the following (this comes up just a few times):
ENTER THIS STUFF
In this example, you type the words ENTER THIS STUFF after the prompt and
then press the Enter key. Notice that we don’t use quotation marks around the
text (“ENTER THIS STUFF”) because we don’t want you to enter quotation
marks. We then explain why you do what we’ve told you to do and point out
what happens after you do, so don’t worry.
Desktop publishing can be a complicated endeavor, with many things that 
you may (or may not) want to know about. We include in this book a few sec-
tions on more advanced topics, such as selecting paper, working with outside
print services, and choosing color processes. Of course, if all you want to do
is create a greeting card or gift certificate and print the results from your
inkjet printer, you might not need to look at these topics. We try to warn you
when a section tends toward technical talk or is limited to specific interests.
But you can read these sections, and doing so will earn you a gold star in the
Desktop Publishing Hall of Fame (although that’s not what this book is meant
to do).
Foolish Assumptions
We make only three assumptions about you in this book. The first, we’ve
already stated: You don’t want to waste time studying useless trivia. You’re in
a hurry, and you want to get your work done.
Our second assumption is that you have a PC that has at least Microsoft
Windows XP installed — although Vista would be nice. Maybe you have 
3
Introduction

set up your computer, or maybe someone else has. But it’s working, and you
can get the help you need to keep it working.
Our third assumption is that you know your way around your computer’s
operating system well enough to perform simple operations in that environ-
ment. You already know how to move your mouse and stroke your keyboard.
You should know how to select a menu command, know how to work with
dialog boxes and windows, and be familiar with common desktop items, such
as the Recycle Bin. We cover some of these topics (when the discussion is
directly applicable to Microsoft Publisher 2007), but we don’t go into any great
detail.
By the way, if finding your way around your new computer or your operating
system is still one of the mysteries of life for you, check out the following
books, published by Wiley Publishing:
 PCs All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers
 Windows XP For Dummies, by Andy Rathbone
 Windows Vista For Dummies, by Andy Rathbone
How This Book Is Organized
Topics in this book are generally arranged as though we were directing you
through a desktop publishing project from start to finish. In the progression 
of topics, we try to address the issues you commonly tackle first, first, and the
issues that you tackle last, last. Clever, eh? This book has seven major parts;
each part has two or more chapters. (Our editors insist that each divided
topic should have at least two subdivisions, and we slavishly follow their
teachings.)
Aside from these considerations, you’ll find that most chapters stand by them-
selves. You can start reading at any section. Great teachers tell us, “Tell them
(the audience) what you are going to tell them.” So, we outlined the entire book
as follows.
Part I: Getting Acquainted 
with Publisher 2007
When you create a project in Microsoft Publisher 2007 to print something,
you’re doing desktop publishing (DTP). When you create a project to place on
the Internet, you’re Web spinning. Desktop publishing replaces technology of
past decades and centuries with something new and special. For many folks,
desktop publishing is the reason they bought computers. Part I tells you what
4
Publisher 2007 For Dummies 

desktop publishing is, how it came about, and where it’s going. Also in Part I, 
we give you the skinny on design issues and provide the nickel tour on the
basics that you need to know to run and use the program.
Part II: Mark This Page
Microsoft Publisher 2007, like most desktop publishing programs, uses the
metaphor of a pasteboard. In this part, you work on creating a page, defining
the layout, and then adding things to your page. You add objects to Microsoft
Publisher 2007 pages inside frames, which we tell you how to work with in
this part. (“We’re innocent, we tell ya. We’ve been framed!”)
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac
An important part of desktop publishing is marrying text and figures on a
page. In this part, you discover how to work with text on your page; not just
how to enter text into a text frame, mind you, but also how to select and work
with type. This part also guides you through the process of importing text
from Microsoft Word 2007 and including tables from Microsoft Excel 2007 and
Microsoft Access 2007 in your Microsoft Publisher 2007 publications. We’ll
leave you to figure out who the maniac is.
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95
A picture is worth a thousand words. That works out to be about $6.95.
Honest, we did the math ourselves! You always knew talk was cheap. Now
you know how cheap. Microsoft Publisher 2007 lets you enhance your page
with all kinds of pictures: drawings, images, and other forms of art, including
Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 slides and a chapter on using Microsoft Picture
Manager. In this part, we tell you what you need to know to create and work
with different kinds of pictures — and where to get help if you need it. We also
use a chapter to talk about the related topic of using color in your publica-
tions.
Part V: Proof Positive
This part contains a cornucopia of important fruits of knowledge for you to
nibble on. You see how to fine-tune your page: Edit copy, hyphenate, add flour-
ishes, and assemble your project. You also find a chapter in this part with a
discussion on paper, printing, and working with commercial print services.
5
Introduction

Part VI: Publishing on the Internet
Publishing on the Internet is almost a requirement. In this part, you learn how
to create and edit a Web site, including adding graphics and hyperlinks and
adding color and texture to the background. You also find tips on previewing
your Web site. Finally, we tell you how to publish your Web site.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Other people have their lists, and we have our lists. In this part, The Part of
Tens, you see lists of ten things on topics that you will want to know about. We
give you lists on design issues, printing, commercial print services, and other
topics. Have fun reading this part, and when you’re done, we will part.
Icons Used in This Book
You won’t find a lot of icons in this book, but you will find some. Here is what
they mean:
This information may appeal to the nerd in you. If it doesn’t, you can safely
skip it.
Tips are intended to save you time or help prevent heartburn. We think you
will find them worth the read.
Our friendly Design icon points out principles that you may want to employ.
These paragraphs point out tidbits of information that you should, well,
remember.
We point out some of the little “gotchas” that life (or Microsoft Publisher
2007) has to offer. (Hint: Don’t do this!)

Publisher 2007 For Dummies 

Where to Go from Here
You’re ready to use this book. Start by reviewing the table of contents to find
a topic of current interest to you. Then dive right in and read about it. Try
some of our suggestions in your work and experiment. Microsoft Publisher
2007 is a very friendly and forgiving program. (If you save copies of your 
publication as you go, little can go wrong that you can’t fix.)
When you find something that doesn’t work quite the way you expect or
something that you want to know more about, return to this book. Repeat 
the process. Finding out about Microsoft Publisher 2007 and Windows XP or
Windows Vista can and should be an exploration. Microsoft meant for these
programs to be a “discoverable environment” — that is, to be like a well-
designed computer game that you can figure out as you play. We’re here to 
get you past any bumps or tilts that you might encounter.
Desktop publishing is fun. That’s why so many people do it. And Microsoft
Publisher 2007 makes it easier to do than any other program we know of.

Getting
Acquainted with
Publisher 2007

In this part . . .
E
veryone wants to create publications that people will
read. The quality of your printed work can directly
inﬂuence your income, your career advancement, the list
of attendees at your parties, and more. Attractive résumés
open the door to interviews, attractive books get bought,
attractive birthday cards get picked up in the store more
often, attractive ads pull orders, and attractive people
date more often. (No, Microsoft Publisher 2007 doesn’t
make you more beautiful or handsome.) It’s fair to say
that the appearance of your designs affects what people
think of you as a person.
Some people are born designers; most people are not.
Microsoft Publisher 2007 lets you create professional-
quality publications and marketing materials easily, even 
if you’re not artistically inclined. You do need to know
something about the elements that separate good design
from poor design and enough about the technology to
create publications or page layout documents in Publisher.
That’s what Part I is all about. The chapters in this part
provide an overview of desktop publishing, tell you what
constitutes good design principles, and give you some
basic information that you need to know in order to get
started working in Microsoft Publisher 2007.

 Using Publisher templates
D
esktop publishing uses page layout software and a personal computer 
to combine text, type, drawings, and images on a page to create books,
newsletters, marketing brochures, flyers, greeting cards, and Web sites, for
example. Anything you can print on a page can be put into a page layout pro-
gram. Microsoft Publisher 2007 lets you place elements on a page, precisely
position them, modify them, and specify a print job by using techniques that
commercial printers require. Whether you print to your inkjet or laser printer,
run down the street to Quick Copy Shop, or send your files to a commercial
printer, Microsoft Publisher 2007 helps you prepare your work for that level 
of quality.
When Should You Use Microsoft
Publisher 2007?
Many programs let you design and print pages to various levels of sophistica-
tion. These programs include word processors such as Microsoft Word 2007
and Corel WordPerfect Office X3; graphics programs such as CorelDRAW and
Adobe Illustrator; and even low-end integrated packages such as Microsoft
Works and Broderbund ThinkFree Office 3. The program I use for writing,
Microsoft Word 2007, enables me to type text, format text, import pictures,
create drawings, and even work with images.
If you can do all that in Microsoft Word 2007, why do you need a desktop 
publishing or page layout program like Microsoft Publisher 2007? The short
answer is control. Microsoft Publisher 2007 lets you control these elements
with finer precision and also offers you many special tools.

So, if you just want to stick your company’s logo at the top of your letters 
and insert a copy of your scanned-in signature at the bottom, you don’t need
Publisher to do that. If you want to create a company logo by combining a
couple of graphics from different sources, write some text, add some color,
and then separate the output to give to a commercial print service to print,
Publisher is a better choice. If you want to create high-quality marketing
materials that will help you attract new customers and keep existing cus-
tomers, Publisher is definitely the way to go. It does these things well.
How Desktop Publishing Works
Page layout software combines various parts into a single document, or publi-
cation. The following list briefly covers the parts you can meld. In Figure 1-1,
you can see that I labeled a few sample elements.
Nearly all objects on a page are in frames or blocks that are created when
you import or create the object:
 Text: Okay, I know that you know what text is. Text is the stuff you type: all
those individual characters that form words, sentences, and paragraphs,
for example.
12
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 
What’s new in Microsoft Publisher 2007?
If you’ve used a previous version of Microsoft
Publisher you may be wondering why you should
bother with this latest version. Well, here is a par-
tial list of new features to be found in Microsoft
Publisher 2007:
 Apply your brand in one step: Microsoft
Publisher 2007 lets you easily apply and view
logos, colors, fonts, and other information in
one step.
 Search templates: It’s easier than ever to find
templates within Microsoft Publisher 2007, and
now you can even preview templates online.
Just point your Web browser to the Microsoft
Office Online Web site to access hundreds of
Microsoft Publisher templates — without ever
having to leave Microsoft Publisher 2007!
 Publisher Tasks: The new Publisher Tasks
pane in Microsoft Publisher 2007 provides
help with common publication creation and
distribution procedures.
 Reuse design elements: The Content Library
lets you store and reuse text, graphics, and
other design elements in any of your Microsoft
Publisher publications.
 Publish in PDF or XPS format: Download a
free add-in and you can save your Microsoft
Publisher 2007 files in PDF or XPS format.
 Create a new marketing campaign:If you have
Microsoft Outlook 2007 with Business Contact
Manager, you can create and track your own
marketing campaigns!

 Type: Man/woman does not live by text alone. Type and typography are
the various letter forms you can use to make your text more attractive.
Publisher lets you access WordArt, a text manipulation program that lets
you add fancy effects to your text.
 Picture: Computers make two kinds of pictures: drawn (vector, or object-
oriented) and painted (raster, or bitmapped) images. You can import both
types into a picture frame.
While Publisher doesn’t ship with a ton of clip art, you can go to the
Microsoft Office Web site to access a huge amount of clip art, including
thousands of clip art images, photographs, Web-related graphics, ani-
mated GIFs (those cute pictures that seem to wiggle around on Web
pages), and more! In fact the Microsoft Office Web site has more than
150,000 free images and sounds. Check it out at http://office.
microsoft.com/clipart.
 Drawn object: Publisher isn’t a drawing program, although some tools on
its Objects toolbar enable you to create drawn images, such as lines, ovals
and circles, rectangles and squares, and a whole bunch of custom shapes.
 Table: Although you can import tables from other programs as objects, as
either drawings or Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects managed
by other applications, Publisher has its own Table tool.

Chapter 1: Own the Printing Press

You can use Publisher to create these elements from scratch, or you can use
other programs to create the objects and then use Publisher to place them in
your publication.
If you have used a previous version of Publisher or Microsoft Office, most
things you see on the screen will seem familiar. However, if your first exposure
to Publisher and/or Office is with version 2007, you might need a brief tour.
The first thing you’ll probably notice is that the user interface in Microsoft
Publisher 2007 is quite a bit different from the rest of the Microsoft Office 2007
products. Microsoft Publisher 2007 utilizes the more traditional menu system
found in Microsoft Office 2003 and earlier. The “other” Microsoft Office prod-
ucts use Microsoft’s new Ribbon interface that is intended to make it easier
and faster to find the commands and features when you need them.
Let’s take a moment to get familiar with the Microsoft Publisher 2007 screen.
Figure 1-2 shows you Publisher with an open publication. If you look closely,
you’ll find the following:
 Title bar: At the very top of the Publisher window, you’ll find the Title
bar. The Title bar shows you the name of the current publication and
whether the publication is a Print Publication or a Web Publication.
 Menu bar: Just below the Title bar you’ll find the Menu bar. The Menu
bar contains, (yes, you guessed it!) the menus. The Menu bar gives you
access to all the features and functions of Publisher. Everything from
creating publications to specifying program settings to getting help.
Figure 1-2:

Publisher
2007 screen.
14
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

 Standard toolbar: This toolbar is located right below the Menu bar. The
Standard toolbar’s main job is to let you control the appearance of the
text in your publication.
 Publisher Tasks pane: This little guy likes to hang out on the left side 
of the screen just under the Standard toolbar. Although often hidden, it
expands to provide links that guide you through the steps necessary to
complete the design of your publication.
 Objects toolbar: This toolbar is located on the left side of the screen. It
has the tools to help you create Text boxes, Tables, Pictures, and the like.
 Publication workspace: In the middle of the screen you’ll see a large
white box. The shape of this box varies with the type of publication you
are creating. This white box represents the page upon which you create
your publication.
 Rulers: The rulers located above and to the left of the publication work-
space are provided to help you lay out and properly align objects on
your page.
 Scroll bars: On the right and bottom of the screens you see scroll bars
that let you scroll vertically and horizontally when your entire document
doesn’t fit on the screen.
 Page Selection bar: The Page Selection bar, located at the bottom left of
the screen, lets you quickly go to any page in your publication. This may
not seem like a big deal in a one-page flyer, but if you are working on a
300-page catalog, that feature comes in mighty handy.
The Design Process
Page design is an iterative process. You can always find a better way to make 
a point with design, to use type and color, or to refine a graphical image, for
example. You can always return to a publication later and find something you
could have done better. Like all creative endeavors, a well-designed publication
can be improved by planning before the fact, experimenting, and offering
thoughtful criticism at all stages. The sections that follow describe some 
methods that designers use to make their pages stand out from the crowd.
Storyboarding
To get a good start on the design process, you can block out the way you want
your publication to look. One block-out method is storyboarding. Storyboards
15
Chapter 1: Own the Printing Press

are like block diagrams. Cartoonists use storyboards to show a story’s pro-
gression. Movie designers use storyboards to illustrate key frames in a movie,
which enables them to present the movie in a preproduction form that others
can view and understand. You can use this same technique.
Many people like to mock up their design projects with pencil and paper.
They create a dummy of their publication and, when the publication spans
several pages, create storyboards. But this is all a matter of preference: The
important thing is to plan your publication before you create it.
I find Publisher so easy to work with that I prefer to create my dummies inside
the program. The tools for creating frames, lines, and boxes make these page
elements easy to create and modify inside Publisher. I also find that working
inside the program forces me to think, right from the start, about how I’ll break
apart a sample design and implement it.
Publisher has a collection of templates that help you create professional-
looking publications. When you first launch Publisher, you see the templates 
in the Catalog window as a collection of thumbnails showing sample docu-
ments you can create. The Publication Types pane on the left provides a list 
of the various types of publications that you can create with Publisher, while
the center pane shows a list of the most popular types of publications. When
you click on a type of publication in the Publication Types pane, the center
pane changes to show a list of thumbnail images that show you what the vari-
ous publications of that particular type will look like. (In other words, the list 
of available templates changes with the type of publication you choose in the
Publication Types pane.)
In effect, storyboarding is what the templates do when they create a publica-
tion for you. When you create a document by using the Publisher templates,
the result is a dummy of the document you’re creating. Figure 1-3 shows a four-
panel brochure created with one of the Brochures templates. The template
helps generate a sample document with a headline, graphics blocks, and text
frames with sample text. Each element on the page can be modified, but the
document’s overall look comes from using a particular Publisher template.
Your dummies, or mock-ups, should show similar use of text, graphics, and
overall design.
Try moving away from your design and looking at it from afar. (This trick works
well for many people.) Better yet, try zooming out so that you can see the over-
all layout but cannot read the text. Choose View➪Zoom from the main menu
and choose 33% or 25% from the submenu that appears. Determine whether its
purpose is obvious or whether clutter is obscuring its purpose. If you have too
many page elements, try eliminating some.
16
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

Assembling a page
After you block out a page design, you can replace the dummy text, pictures,
and other frames with the data you want to include on the page. This is 
the assembly stage of page composition. Depending on the type of object
frame (Publisher-speak for a text box or picture frame) or tool selected, you
can apply one of the Edit or Insert menu commands to bring the data into
Publisher. The basics of importing text are covered in Chapter 6. You can 
find the related topic of importing tabular data also in Chapter 6. For details
on bringing graphics into your publication, see Chapter 10.
Chances are great that after you compose and fill all the frames with real data,
the page will require more tweaking. Publisher contains a number of special-
ized tools for repositioning, resizing, and fitting objects on a page. Chapter 12
details the final steps in the assembly process. You also find information about
preparing a publication for output to an outside printer in Chapter 13.
Don’t be surprised if the assembly process is largely composed of the tweak-
ing phase of the project. Leave enough time to get this tweaking done the way
you want it. (Think of the builder who says that the house is 90 percent done
when only 50 percent of the allotted time is spent.)

Chapter 1: Own the Printing Press

Printing a page
After your page is composed the way you want it, you’re ready to print. You can
choose to print files to local printers and select from any of the print drivers
that came with Windows XP or Windows Vista. Printing to a local printer is no
different in Publisher than it is in most other Windows applications: You simply
choose File➪Print.
If you intend to have your publication printed by a commercial printer, you 
will probably want to send the entire Publisher file to the printer. The printer
then has the most flexibility to print your publication correctly. If your com-
mercial printer doesn’t have Publisher, you can send your publication as 
a PDF file. The commercial printer can then extract and modify images but
cannot make many other types of changes or corrections. See Chapter 13 
for details on having close encounters with printers of the third kind (human
ones, that is).
Getting Out of the Gate with Publisher
You start Microsoft Publisher 2007 in one of two ways:
 Double-click the icon for the program on the Windows desktop.
 Choose Start➪Programs➪Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office Publisher
2007, as shown in Figure 1-4. (Easy!)
Whichever way you start Publisher, you’re greeted by the handy Catalog
window you see in Figure 1-5. Your first glimpse of the Catalog window shows
templates for the most popular publication types — business cards, brochures,
and postcards, for example — but you can change the view by choosing other
categories from the Publication Types pane, on the left. (Anyone for paper 
folding projects?)
If you’re familiar with earlier versions of Microsoft Publisher, you may be
wondering what happened to its wizards. They have been replaced by
Publisher templates and the new Publisher Tasks pane.
Using a Publisher template is the easiest way to create a publication in
Microsoft Publisher 2007. After you select a publication type and choose 
a template from the Catalog window, the Publisher Tasks pane appears, pre-
senting you with a set of dialog boxes that leads you through the creation 
of a project based on selections you make.

Chapter 1: Own the Printing Press

If for some reason Publisher is already open and you’re working somewhere
else in the program, you can always return to the Catalog window by choosing
File➪New from the main menu.
The Catalog window is a modal dialog box, which means that you need 
to make a selection in it or dismiss it before you can go on. You can click 
and drag the Catalog window’s title bar as you would drag any window’s 
title bar.
I just made the assertion that using a Publisher template is the easiest way 
to create a publication in Microsoft Publisher. The next section is meant to
show you just how right I am.
Just the fax, ma’am: Creating a fax cover
sheet the quick and easy way
Microsoft Publisher 2007 has hundreds of templates for more than 25 types
of publications; if you look back at Figure 1-5, you can see the (rather long)
list of available publication types. Some of the more useful publications are 
in the Business Forms category, where you can find
 Expense reports
 Fax covers
 Inventory lists
 Invoices
 Purchase orders
 Quotes
 Refunds
 Statements
 Time billings
 Weekly records
The Fax Cover publication type provides a quick example of how to use a
Publisher template to quickly create a useful business publication:
1. In the Publication Types pane (the listing on the left side of the
Catalog window), click the Business Forms link.
20
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

The center pane of the Catalog window updates to show the available
Business Forms categories.
2. Scroll down to the Fax Cover section and then select one of the 35 
Fax Cover examples.
The selected Fax Cover sheet is highlighted, and a larger sample version
appears in the top-right portion of the screen.
3. Click the Create button located in the bottom-right portion of 
the screen.
Publisher creates (surprising, huh?) the Fax Cover for you and presents
you with the Publisher Tasks pane visible to the right of the publication,
as shown in Figure 1-6.
The Publisher Tasks pane stands ready to help you customize the publication.
Its main features include the ones in this list:
 The Page Options tab: This tab is a bit of a chameleon. It changes depend-
ing on the type of publication you are working on. If you are working on a
Fax Cover sheet, it might display a business logo that you can click and
drag onto your publication. If you are working on a newsletter, it shows a
Columns section that lets you change the layout of your publication by
changing the number of columns.
 The Options tab: From this tab, you can quickly and easily select a differ-
ent template to use and also change the paper size. (The name of this 
tab changes depending on whichever category you chose; in Figure 1-6, 
it appears as the Business Form Options tab because I chose the Business
Form category.)
 The Font Schemes tab: Change the font scheme for the entire publication.
Font schemes are collections of fonts that were created by armies of highly
paid design consultants to be pleasing to the eye (the fonts, not the con-
sultants). Selecting a font scheme instantly applies the new fonts to your
publication. Of course, you have the option of creating your very own font
scheme, too. Who’s to say that Old English Text MT and Bauhaus 93 don’t
go well together?
 The Color Schemes tab: On this tab, you can change the — you guessed
it — color scheme. Just don’t go thinking that the same group of highly
paid consultants who created the font schemes also created the color
schemes. We’re talking specialists here. As with the font schemes, you
also have the option of creating your own color scheme. Of course,
unless you and the person to whom you’re sending the fax have one 
of those newfangled color fax machines, you’re probably wasting your
time customizing the color scheme on your fax cover.
21
Chapter 1: Own the Printing Press

Fun facts about Publisher templates 
and the Publisher Tasks pane
You need to know few important points about the Publisher templates and
the Publisher Tasks pane; these tools are used to create new on-screen 
publications inside Publisher:
 The Print Preview feature lets you see how your document will look
when it is printed. Print Preview shows you your publication without
cluttering the screen with all those toolbars, menus, rulers, task panes,
etc. It even lets you view multiple pages at once (click the Multiple pages
button) or how the publication will look if printed on a monochrome
printer (click the Color/Grayscale button). Figure 1-7 shows the fax cover
through the “eyes” of Print Preview.
 Publications created with Publisher templates are composed of many
individual objects. If you click any part of a publication, selection handles
(little circles on the edges; see Figure 1-8) appear around the selected
area. With the help of these little guys, you can manipulate the size,
placement, color, and other properties of your publication’s parts.
 As handy as templates are, if you’re using templates only to create
documents in Publisher, you’re just scratching the surface of what you
can do with the program. I’m more than happy to present what’s under
the surface as you read through this book.

Meet the publication types
Each publication type can generate several versions of publications of 
the same class, depending on the selections you make. Publisher has 27 
publication types (28 if you count the Blank Page Sizes selection):
 Blank Page Sizes: Use these templates when you want to create a publi-
cation from scratch. You can choose the page size you want without
Publisher adding any sample pictures or text. You start with a clean slate.
 Advertisements: Use these templates to create advertisements for your
business. Figure 1-9 shows you the style affectionately referred to as 
The Works.
 Award Certificates: Choose from 22 different award certificates.
 Banners: This publication type offers eight types of banners:
Informational, Sale, Event, Welcome, Congratulations, Holiday, Romance,
and Get Well. You can set a height and width, and you can also decide
whether you want to have graphics and borders on your banner.
 Brochures: Four different brochure styles are offered: Informational,
Price List, Event, and Fund-raiser. Figure 1-10 shows previews of some
Informational brochures.
 Business Cards: Choose from more than 50 styles of business cards.
 Business Forms: You have ten choices: Expense Report, Fax Cover,
Inventory List, Invoice, Purchase Order, Quote, Refund, Statement, Time
Billing, and Weekly Record. As you click each type of business form in the
Publication Types pane, a picture of the default form appears on the right
side of the screen. Figure 1-11 shows you an Invoice form that uses the
Eclipse style.
 Calendars: Choose from 46 full-page and 3 wallet-size calendars.
 Catalogs: Create ten different kinds of catalogs to advertise your wares.
 E-mail: Use any of these ten e-mail templates to create targeted e-mail
marketing campaigns.
 Envelopes: The Envelopes templates create more than 50 envelope
styles that match the Letterheads and Business Cards styles. Publisher
remembers the style you used and asks whether you want to base your
next envelope on that style.
 Flyers: This publication type includes styles for Informational, Special
Offer, Sale, Event, Fund-raiser, and Announcement.
 Gift Certificates: Forge — er, I mean, create — your own gift certificates!
Choose from 35 gift certificate styles.

 Greeting Cards: Tired of paying $5 for a greeting card? You’ll love this
publication type. It offers 20 categories of cards. Each of these cate-
gories offers you many choices. Figure 1-12 shows you an example of 
a professional-looking thank-you card that you can create and send to
your clients.
 Import Word Documents: These templates let you gussy up text you
created in Microsoft Word 2007. Select from 36 different styles. This 
is a great tool if you have a Microsoft Word document that you want to
update so that it has the look and feel of other publications you have
created in Publisher. Have a report that you created in Microsoft Word
and you want it to look like that brochure you worked so hard to create?
Use the Import Word Documents templates.
 Invitation Cards: Having a to-do? These templates help you create invi-
tation cards for your party, theme party, holiday party, birthday party,
housewarming, shower, event, celebration, or fund-raiser.
 Labels: You can create labels in any of the following 11 styles: Mailing
Address, Shipping, Return Address, Computer Disk, Cassette, CD/DVD,
Video, Jar/Product, Binder, Bookplate, and Identification. All these labels
match standard Avery labels. The Avery number is provided after the
label name.

 Letterhead: The Letterhead templates offer you more than 50 styles of
letterhead that you can print. Figure 1-13 shows an example of a letter-
head using the Modular style. After you create a letterhead for your 
business or personal use, Publisher remembers the style you used and
asks whether you want to base your next letterhead on that style.
 Menus: If you have your own restaurant, the Menus templates let you
create Regular, Take-Out, Daily Special, and Wine/Dessert menus in a
variety of styles.
 Newsletters: Create almost 70 different styles of newsletters in a variety
of sizes and layouts.
 Paper Folding Projects: Build your own paper tiger air force! Afraid to 
fly? Create origami (the Japanese art of creating paper figures). The four
types range from easy to create (the Boat) to difficult (the Parrot). Still,
these items are fun to give, and they’re pretty when printed from a color
printer or on colored paper.
 Postcards: These templates create 13 categories of postcards:
Informational, Special Offer, Sale, Event, Invitation, Holiday Party
Invitation, Holiday Greeting, Holiday Thank You, Thank You, We’ve
Moved, Announcement, Reminder, and Tent Fold. Each category offers
several types of postcards.

 Programs: Create Music, Religious Service, and Theater programs with 
a few clicks of the mouse.
 Quick Publications: Use these templates when you want to create single-
page publications with a professional design and layout.
 Resumes: Choose from Entry Level, Chronological, or Curriculum Vitae
résumés with style!
 Signs: Create 40 single-page signs — everything from Authorized
Personnel Only to Lemonade for Sale to Wheelchair Access.
 Web Sites: Use these templates to create over 70 different multiple-page
Web sites quickly and easily.
 With Compliments Cards: Choose from 35 styles of With Compliments
cards. The cards come in handy when you have product samples and
freebies to give away and you want to make sure that the recipient knows
where they came from. Figure 1-14 shows a With Compliments card in the
Marquee style.
You aren’t limited to accepting whatever the templates give you. You can
replace one font with another, one picture with another, or one border with
another, for example. And, you can always use the Publisher Tasks pane to
make changes to the design of your publication. If the Publisher Tasks pane is
not visible, click the Publisher Tasks button on the Publisher Tasks toolbar to
display it. Knowing Publisher well helps you quickly modify these templates’
output and makes the result a document that you’re proud to show to others.

Success by Design
In This Chapter
 Knowing your audience
 Analyzing other people’s projects
 Discovering the keys to design success
 Publishing with style
 Working within a budget
W
e live in a fast age. Before, you had time to read the occasional ad 
or brochure that appeared in your mailbox; now, you may receive
dozens of mailings every day. We’re bombarded with so much stuff that we
tend to ignore most of it.
So here’s the deal. Your publication has five seconds to get someone’s atten-
tion. (Some design gurus claim that most pieces get about two seconds of
review before being tossed.) If your published piece doesn’t have something
that interests your audience and makes people want to explore it further —
poof! — it’s gone.
If you have only five seconds, you had better make sure that your primary mes-
sage is the first thing a reader sees. You have little room for error on this score.
Consider any design device that you can use to repeat — and build on — the
primary message.
This chapter shows you the design basics necessary to do your work in
Microsoft Publisher 2007 quickly and well.
Know Your Audience
The first step to creating a successful project is figuring out who your audience
is and how they will interact with your work. Knowing your audience helps you
refine your publication’s look and feel. In addition, it helps you determine your
writing style, which is essential for good communication.

You can learn a lot about successful design by studying the work of market-
ing gurus, particularly those who work in advertising. Advertising combines 
a creative art form with statistically measured results based on large popula-
tions of target markets. One of my favorite books on this topic is Design for
Response: Creative Direct Marketing That Works, by Leslie Sherr and David J.
Katz (published by Rockport Publishers).
While you’re designing your publication, show it to prospective members of
your target audience so that you can figure out what they need. If your target
audience is college students, for example, you might show your publication
to several college students and solicit their feedback before you go to the
trouble and expense of having it printed.
When you know your audience, you can create a publication that has the cor-
rect “voice” or “tone” for that group. For example, a typeface that looks like
lettering on a ransom note is inappropriate for business correspondence but
may be perfect for birthday party invitations. Publisher has thousands of pro-
fessionally designed templates, 50 font schemes (collections of fonts that look
good together in a publication), and more than 90 coordinated color schemes.
Finding one that’s appropriate to your audience shouldn’t be too difficult.
If you’re picky and you don’t like any of the hundreds of fonts that come 
with Publisher, you can always buy more. Some vendors sell type in packages
designed for specific uses. Their catalogs (which are works of art in them-
selves) describe the best uses for many typefaces and also suggest typefaces
that work well together.
Where Others Have Gone Before
When I start the design phase of a publishing project, I try to collect the best
examples of work in that area. I look at the overall design of any piece I collect
and look for style elements that I can use as a springboard to creating my own
style. Keep file folders of ads you like, marketing pieces you get in the mail, 
and other publications. Then, when you’re ready to create a piece, you can sit
down and peruse your samples. Invariably, you’ll find an idea or two to get you
started. If you don’t find anything that strikes your fancy, try one of the many
templates that Publisher provides.
Any artwork, images, templates, or designs you find in Publisher and its Design
Gallery are there for your use. The following list specifies, according to the
Microsoft Software License Terms (MSLT), what you cannot do with the media
elements (photos, clip art, fonts, and images, for example) in Publisher:
 Sell, license or distribute copies of the media elements on a stand-alone
basis or as part of any collection, product, or service where the primary
value of the product or service is the media element
32
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

 Use or distribute any of the media elements that include representations
of identifiable individuals, governments, logos, initials, emblems, trade-
marks, or entities for any commercial purposes or to express or imply
any endorsement or association with any product, service, entity, 
or activity
 Create obscene or scandalous works, as defined by federal law at the
time the work is created, using the media elements
 Permit third parties to distribute copies of the media elements except as
part of your product or service
Also, according to the terms of the license, you must
 Indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Microsoft from and against any
claims or lawsuits, including attorneys’ fees, that arise from or result
from the use or distribution of the media elements as modified by you
 Include a valid copyright notice on your products and services that
include copies of the media elements
You cannot and should not copy an entire design or image from someone
else. That’s illegal. Most designs are copyrighted by their authors. When you
use other people’s work, you can, however, adapt the designs you collect,
borrowing an idea here and an idea there.
Sometimes a fine line exists between adapting an idea and copying one. You
need to use good judgment. Note that the law in this area is volatile and sub-
ject to change. I recommend The Desktop Publisher’s Legal Handbook, by
Daniel Sitarz (Nova Publishing Company) as a good place to start learning
about these issues.
Another resource to use when beginning the design phase is a study of
before-and-after makeovers. You can find case studies in the design makeover
columns in desktop publishing magazines and in some specialized books on
desktop publishing. The following resources take this approach:
 Books:
• Looking Good in Print, 4th Edition, by Roger C. Parker and Patrick
Berry (published by Coriolis Group Books.)
 Magazines:
• Before & After (www.bamagazine.com), an online magazine that
tells you “how to design cool stuff”
• Communication Arts (www.commarts.com), the world’s largest
“magazine on creativity for graphic designers, art directors, 
copywriters, photographers, illustrators and multimedia 
designers.”

Chapter 2: Success by Design

The Keys to Design Success
Most design gurus agree that you can apply certain principles to your designs
to make them easier to understand and more attractive to the reader. Although
the exact terminology for these principles may vary, the set of principles is
nearly always the same.
When you begin to design a publication, you may not always analyze your
work in terms of these principles, but you should at least keep them in mind:
 Be consistent. Elements on a page should be repeated in appropriate
places. Consistency is particularly important in longer publications, such
as books. The more structured your design, the easier it is to produce
the piece.
The best way to enforce consistent design is to create a meaningful 
style sheet for your publication. A style sheet is a collection of styles that
allows you to keep your publication consistent and make quick changes.
Publisher can help you apply styles or formats to text, objects, tables, and
other page elements. Just as word processing documents can have style
sheets, Publisher can import or create text styles. You can put together
your Publisher project more quickly and more consistently if you use a
well-developed style sheet and template rather than simply develop on
the fly.
Keep in mind that using one of thousands of templates that Publisher
offers is a good way to ensure consistency. For example, you can create
a letterhead starting with a Publisher template and then customize the
letterhead to your liking. After you’re satisfied with the look of the letter-
head, you can click the Change Template button in the Publisher Tasks
pane and select Envelope to create an envelope with the same “look and
feel” as the letterhead.
 Put things where people tend to see them. People have a tendency to
view a page in a diagonal direction, from the upper left to the lower right.
Elements in the center of the page get the most attention; elements in the
upper-left and lower-right areas get the least attention.
Your design should treat a two-page spread as though it were a single
page because the entire two-page spread is the unit of design that 
readers see.
 Keep your message simple. To make your reader focus on your content,
follow these guidelines:
• Use white space. Many well-designed pieces have a white space
content of 50 percent.
34
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

• Limit yourself to no more than two fonts on a page. You may have
noticed that all font schemes in Publisher consist of two fonts.
• Be judicious with color — apply it as highlighting. You want to use
color to enhance, not distract from, the message you’re trying to
get across.
 Keep related or similar information on a page. Keep related information
close together or aligned.
You can create a block of related elements by separating them from other
elements on the page with rules (lines), frames (boxes), or white space.
Likewise, if a graphical image relates to a story, the image should appear
close to the story. Any caption for the image should appear close to it —
just like the graphics in this book.
 Align everything on a page with something. Create a grid and place
your page elements on that grid, as described in Chapter 4. Creating this
type of page grid for a layout is similar to creating an outline for a written
document.
The same page grid can produce order on pages without producing 
pages that look alike. For example, three- and four-column newspapers
and newsletters are common because you can produce many looks 
within those formats. You can have blocks in the grid that aren’t filled 
in, for example, and graphics that span multiple blocks. Figure 2-1 shows 
a four-column grid with three rows. This layout generates 12 blocks and
offers a lot of flexibility. Figures 2-2 through 2-4 show you three examples
that use this grid layout.
 Provide contrast to enliven your work. Balance consistency by doing
the unexpected.
 Use a page hierarchy. If you use a large headline, readers will probably
start reading the page there. You can use smaller headlines to divide a
page into sections. You can also use vertical and horizontal rules to break
your page into blocks and provide contrast. Emphasize important infor-
mation by making it look different, but don’t emphasize parts of your page
that have less importance.
The columns in your page grid don’t have to be the same width, and the pages
in a two-page spread don’t have to be balanced or symmetrical. Balanced
pages seem boring. I tend to vary the size and placement of graphics across
columns. I also favor the use of sidebars, pull-quotes (short statements that
summarize information on a page), large initial capitals, and column shadings
to break up the page.

Desktop Style Resources
Desktop publishing has turned millions of people into typographers and 
typesetters. Using type and working with typography aren’t skills that come
naturally to most people, however. The many rules and guidelines specific to
page layout don’t pertain to typewritten text or text prepared in word proces-
sors. The resources in this section can help you make the transition from 
text documents to desktop publications.
Two of the most accepted style guides for clear writing in the United States
for the English language are
 The Elements of Style, 4th Edition, by William Strunk, Jr., and E. B. White
(published by Longman)
 The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th Edition (published by University of
Chicago Press)
A number of texts specialize in the handling of type. In addition to The
Chicago Manual of Style, the following books are type-worthy additions to
your library:
 Words into Type, 3rd Edition, by Marjorie Skillin and Robert Malcom Gay
(published by Prentice Hall)
 New Hart’s Rules: The Handbook of Style for Writers and Editors, by R. M.
Ritter, ed. (published by Oxford University Press)
 Pocket Pal: The Handy Little Book of Graphic Arts Production, 19th
Edition, by Michael Bruno (published by International Paper Company)
The following two small texts are noteworthy for beginning users because
they deal with typographical issues in a friendly way:
 The PC Is Not a Typewriter, by Robin Williams (published by Peachpit
Press)
 The Desktop Style Guide, by James Felici (published by Random House
Information Group)
Desktop publishing has its own language. Each typography reference work
mentioned in this section helps you keep your picas separate from your
points, your en dashes from your em dashes, and your verso from your recto.
Everything Costs Money
Your budget can play a prominent role in the design of your publication. 
You don’t want to merrily design something only to be shocked by the sticker
38
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

price when you arrive at the printer. A good designer always asks up front
“How much were you intending to spend?” because it helps to ground the
project in reality. Perhaps good designers ask the question also because it
helps them set their pay scale.
Just because a project has a limited budget doesn’t mean that the publica-
tion has to be poorly designed. Publisher was created with the idea that you
can create professional-looking publications without busting your budget.
You must simply rely on techniques that not only enhance your work but also
stay within your budget. I have seen creative, effective, and attractive pieces
produced on limited budgets, and I have seen expensively designed pieces
that belong in the Desktop Publishing Hall of Shame. It takes experience and
good judgment to get the most out of what you have to spend.
Keep in mind that simpler usually translates into “less expensive.”
Monochrome printed on plain bond paper generally costs less than four-
color printed on specialty paper. The fancier you get, the more you’re likely 
to spend. Talk to the friendly folks at the print shop you plan to use. They 
can provide guidance on cost versus quality. Sometimes you get lucky, and
they can offer a premium-quality paper for a reduced cost because someone
else canceled an order.
Establish a good working relationship with the staff at your print shop. They
can help you in the early design phase by suggesting paper and color selec-
tions. Inquire about their price breaks for quantity printing. They can also
supply you with the correct printer driver to install so that your design is only
formatted correctly on your screen but also prints correctly to their printer.

Basic Training
In This Chapter
 Launching Microsoft Publisher 2007
 Touring the Publisher interface
 Getting help
 Customizing your options
 Shutting down safely
 Creating, finding, opening, and saving files
I
named this chapter “Basic Training” because I discuss things that you
need to know to get on with your work in Microsoft Publisher 2007. If you
make a mess, this chapter also tells you how to clean up after yourself.
If you know how to create, open, find, close, and save files, you can probably
get by without reading this chapter. Still, Microsoft Publisher 2007 offers you
new ways to perform these tasks. Chances are that by reading this chapter,
you’ll discover methods you didn’t know about. A few seconds saved here, 
a few seconds saved there, and before you know it, you have time to do all
sorts of things. This chapter should repay your reading time with improved
productivity.
Launch Time
When you install Publisher on your computer, the Installer creates an entry
on the Programs submenu of the Start menu. Although using the menus is
probably the easiest way to launch, or start, Publisher, the following list 
contains other methods you might want to know about:
 In Windows XP, choose Start➪All Programs➪Microsoft Office➪Microsoft
Office Publisher 2007, as shown in Figure 3-1.

 Locate the program icon, shown in the margin, and double-click it.
The program itself was installed in the Office 12 folder, located inside the
Microsoft Office folder, which in turn is located in the Program Files folder,
which you can navigate to by using Windows Desktop or Windows
Explorer.
 Double-click the icon for the Publisher file you want to open. (It has 
a .pub extension.) Publisher launches, with the Publisher file you
double-clicked open on the screen.
What’s All This on the Screen?
In this section, I show you the names and uses of all the buttons, bars, and
bows within Publisher. I don’t give you fine details here about all the interface
elements that are standard fare for Windows XP and/or Windows Vista. I
assume that you already know how to use the menu bar; title bar; scroll bars;
Minimize, Maximize, and Restore buttons; and mouse pointer. If you aren’t
familiar with standard Windows XP/Vista features, please refer to a beginning

text on Windows, such as Windows XP For Dummies, or Windows Vista For
Dummies, both written by Andy Rathbone (published by Wiley Publishing).
If you purchased Publisher as part of one of the many incarnations of Microsoft
Office 2007, notice the absence of the newfangled Office Ribbon. (It may be a
curse or a blessing, depending on your view of the Office Ribbon.) The bottom
line is that you just have to put up with the “old-fashioned” menus and toolbars
for now. (My gut tells me that Microsoft will update Publisher to the new 
interface in the next version.)
Time to start the tour! First and foremost, squirrel away the fact that Publisher
uses the term workspace to refer to the Microsoft Publisher 2007 window and
its customization options. Figure 3-2 shows a blank Publisher publication
within its workspace, with all the interface elements handily labeled.

Chapter 3: Basic Training

Publisher places the following interface elements on your screen:
 Standard toolbar: The toolbar, as shown in Figure 3-3, contains icons
that duplicate menu commands. When you move your pointer over each
button, a ScreenTip appears, to tell you which command the button 
represents. Depending on the program’s status, some buttons might 
be disabled.
If you select an object on your layout, you might see, below the Standard
toolbar (which is always on your screen) an additional Formatting tool-
bar for that object. For example, when you select a picture, you see the
Picture toolbar, which lets you format the picture and controls the way
it’s displayed in your publication.
If ScreenTips are distracting or you just plain don’t like them (I find them
helpful), you can easily turn them off in the Toolbar Options dialog box.
Choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize to open the Customize dialog box,
and then click the Options tab. Click to deselect the Show ScreenTips on
Toolbars check box. You can also show (or hide) ScreenTips for objects
and show shortcut keys in ScreenTips. Choose Tools➪Options to open
the Options dialog box, and then click the User Assistance tab.
You can customize the toolbars and rulers you see by choosing the appro-
priate commands from the View menu. I talk about these commands in the
following section.
 The Objects toolbar: The 14 buttons in the Objects toolbar (down the
left side in Figure 3-2) let you create objects or insert objects from other
sources. These buttons also display ScreenTips. The Pointer tool lets
you select objects on a page. When you create an object on your layout,
that object and the Pointer tool are automatically selected so that you
can work with your new object. (By the way, for those counting, the
right-pointing arrow at the bottom is Button # 14 — that’s the Toolbar
Options button.)

Here’s a good Objects toolbar trick: If you plan to use the same tool
repeatedly, double-click the tool. That tool stays selected until you click
another one.
 The rulers: The horizontal and vertical rulers help position objects on
your screen. You can move the zero point of the rulers by clicking and
dragging the intersection button or the ruler.
A guide is a dotted line that runs the length or width of your page and is
used to position objects on your page. To create a guide, hold down the
Ctrl key when you click and drag a ruler.
Guides are useful on their own, but an even more useful benefit is that you
can set the Snap to Guides feature by choosing Arrange➪Snap➪To Guides
(or Ctrl+Shift+W). Objects you create close to the guide automatically
move to align with the guide. You can also choose Arrange➪Snap➪To
Ruler Marks or Arrange➪Snap➪To Objects for corresponding kinds of
alignment. In Chapter 4, I have much more to say about the rulers, guides,
and methods you can use for accurately positioning objects on a layout.
 The page-navigation controls: The page-navigation controls are located at
the bottom of the screen, on the status bar. The pages in your publication
are represented by little page icons with numbers. The highlighted page
shows the current page. To move to any given page in your publication,
just click its icon. If you’re viewing your publication in Two-Page Spread
view, two page icons are highlighted.
You can also use the page navigation controls to rearrange pages within
your publication. Simply drag and drop any page icon to the place you
want it to appear.
 The Zoom indicator: The Zoom indicator is on the Standard toolbar. The
indicator’s text box shows the current magnification. You can click the
down arrow to open a drop-down list that lets you change your magnifi-
cation. You can also use the Zoom In (+) and Zoom Out (–) buttons next
to the text box to change your view.
 The scroll bars: Click the arrows at the ends of the scroll bars to move
incrementally; click the scroll bar itself to move a screenful; or click and
drag the button (some folks call it the elevator) on the scroll bar to move
your window view as much as you want.
 The status bar: Below the horizontal scroll bar, the status bar contains
information that changes along with your changing activities on-screen.
For example, if you select a layout object, the Current Position box shows
the object’s on-screen position; the Object Size box shows the object’s
dimensions. If you haven’t selected anything, the Current Position box
tracks your mouse pointer’s position on-screen, and the Object Size box
indicates the size of any area you dragged around (a selection rectangle).
Keep an eye on the status bar as you move. It features other helpful 
messages and is a most useful positioning aid.

Chapter 3: Basic Training

Right-click anywhere on the vertical scrollbar to access a context menu
that lets you quickly scroll one page up or down or to the top or bottom
of your publication. Right-click the horizontal scrollbar to quickly scroll
to the left or right edge or one page to the left or right.
The dimensions you see on the ruler and the status bar are shown 
in inches by default. You can set other units for dimensions and other
program preferences by making selections from the Options dialog box.
You open this dialog box by choosing Tools➪Options.
 The page: The white area where your page design appears is the page,
sometimes referred to as the printable area. Margins appear as blue
dotted lines. The stuff that appears outside the margin box is the 
nonprintable area. (It makes sense to me.)
 The work (or scratch) area: Although the gray area surrounding your
page looks dead and useless, it isn’t. The work area is a pasteboard 
that you can use to position objects you want to use later or to modify
objects without having to disrupt your layout. You can think of the
pasteboard as your scratch area, and you can use it for any purpose 
that comes to mind (well, almost).
 The Help system: I have some good news or some bad news. (It’s good
news if you found the Office Assistants annoying and distracting. It’s bad
news if Rocky the dog reminded you of the puppy you had as a child.)
Microsoft scrapped the whole Office Assistant initiative for a more 
traditional dialog box.
Publisher offers several sources of help. You can get help from the Help files
on your computer that are installed when you install Microsoft Office 2007 or
Microsoft Publisher 2007. You can also get help from Microsoft Office Online,
Microsoft Office’s home on the Web. If you see the words Connected to
Office Online in the lower-right corner of the Help window, as shown in
Figure 3-4, you’re searching the Help files located on the Microsoft Online
Web site. If, instead, you see Offline, you’re searching your local Help files.
How do you tell Publisher where you want to search for help? I was hoping
you would ask. First, choose Help➪Microsoft Office Publisher Help from the
Standard toolbar or press the F1 key. If you see Connected to Office
Online in the lower-right corner of the screen, any help you receive comes
from the Microsoft Office Online Web site. If you would rather not go online
for help, click the Connected to Office Online text to display the
Connection Status menu and then choose Show Content Only from This
Computer. The Connection Status menu changes to Offline. You can now
search for help on your local computer.
Type the word or phrase for which you want to receive help and then click
Search. Do you like to take the scenic route? Take a stroll through the table of
contents and click the topic you’re interested in. Drill down, or refine, your
search by clicking subtopics.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

Publisher’s excellent online documentation leads you to discussions on
topics by using keywords. As you navigate tasks, the How Tos Help system
screens give you step-by-step directions. Microsoft now uses this technique
to “write down” its manuals (and save trees).
The Help system has a number of features you might want to check out,
including Publisher Tutorials, keyboard shortcuts, technical support informa-
tion, a connection to the Microsoft Publisher 2007 Web site, and even an Office
Diagnostics feature, which attempts to fix Publisher if it starts misbehaving.
Some Publisher features help people with low vision, fine motor control
issues, and other disabilities more easily use the program. Use one of the
methods just mentioned to open the Help window and search for the word
accessibility. Alternatively, you can browse for the Accessibility topic in the
Help window table of contents.
For more information on the Help system, check out the “Help Yourself” 
section, later in this chapter.

much time on my hands. But now I have no extra time on my hands, and I rec-
ognize that spending a lot of time playing with a program’s options, although
sometimes entertaining, can be a real time waster.
Be that as it may, Publisher offers options you can set to change the way the
program works. You make your choices on the five tabs in the Options dialog
box, which you open by choosing Tools➪Options. The General tab, shown in
Figure 3-5, is the first of these tabs. (After you take a peek at all the tabs, I
highlight a few of the more helpful options you can set.)
When you click the Edit tab and the User Assistance tabs in the Options
dialog box, you get to see the dialog boxes shown in Figures 3-6 and 3-7,
respectively.
Clicking the Save tab in the Options dialog box brings forth the dialog box
shown in Figure 3-8. Figure 3-9 shows the Web tab, which gives you control
over the way Publisher handles Web sites you create.
I refer to the selections in the Options dialog box throughout this book when-
ever I discuss their related features. You can see a quick explanation of any
option by right-clicking the option and choosing What’s This? from the pop-up
menu. Alternatively, you can click the Help (?) button on the right end of the
dialog box’s title bar and then click a feature name to see the same explanation
(which is standard Windows behavior).
This list describes some of the more useful options that you might want to
reset in the Options dialog box:
Figure 3-5:

tab of the

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

 Measurement Units: On the General tab, choose inches (the default),
centimeters, picas, points, or pixels.
Inches and centimeters are probably familiar measurements. If you’ve
never worked with type, the Points, Picas, and Pixels options might be
unfamiliar:
• Point: The smallest unit of measure in typesetting. An inch consists
of 72 points; to demonstrate, draw a 1-inch line on-screen and
change the Measurement Units option to Points. Then you can
read the object’s new size on the status bar.
The use of points has a practical application in the design of com-
puter monitors. Most computer monitors create pixels at approxi-
mately 72 dots per inch so that type is represented well on-screen.
• Pica: Equal to 12 points, or approximately 1⁄6 of an inch. Specifically, a
pica measures 0.166 inch, making 30 picas equal to 4.98 inches. Most
page layout programs ignore this small differential, however, and 
set the pica to exactly 1⁄6 of an inch, as is the case with Publisher. (Be
grateful that Publisher doesn’t trouble you with ciceros, didots, and
other arcane typographical measurements.)
• Pixels: Short for picture elements, the little dots that comprise the
image on your screen. Pixels are the smallest element your monitor
can display. Setting the Measurement Units option to Pixels gives
you very fine control over the objects in your publication.
 Show Publication Types When Starting Publisher: Turn off this option
(it’s on the General tab) if you want Publisher to start with a blank 
publication every time you launch the program.
 Arrow Keys Nudge Objects By: You can specify, on the Edit tab, how 
far Publisher moves a selected object when you press an arrow key.
Figure 3-6:
The Edit tab

Options
dialog box.
49
Chapter 3: Basic Training

 Show Tippages: Located on the User Assistance tab, tippages are a set
of helpful hints and message boxes that can help you use Publisher
more effectively. Whenever you do something that Publisher thinks you
might be able to do more efficiently, it pops up one of these tippages.
For example, if you draw a straight line manually, a Publisher message
box tells you that you can constrain lines to the horizontal and vertical
directions by holding down the Shift key. To reset tips so that they show
up again when you’re using a feature you’ve already used, click the Reset
Tips button.
 Show ScreenTips on Objects: Whenever you place the mouse pointer on
an object and this option is enabled (on the User Assistance tab), a
ScreenTip appears and tells you which object you’re pointing at.
 Save Autorecovery Info Every X Minutes: You’ll love this option the
first time your laptop battery runs out in the middle of creating a publi-
cation. This option, found on the Save tab, automatically backs up your
publication every few minutes (10 by default).
 Organize Supporting Files in a Folder: Located on the Web tab, this
option puts into a single folder all the files you need when you create a
Web page so that you don’t have to go looking for them.
 Send Entire Publication Page As a Single JPEG Image: This option,
which is on the Web tab, is quite handy when you need to send a publi-
cation to someone who doesn’t have Publisher. Just keep in mind that
the JPEG image can be quite large and that many e-mail servers limit the
size of attachments. Note that this feature sends only the currently
selected page of your publication. If you need to send a multiple page
publication, this option won’t help you.

Other helpful options are on the Options tab in the Customize dialog box:
Choose Tools➪Customize and click the Options tab. Here are a couple of
options that I find useful:
 Show Standard and Formatting Toolbars on Two Rows: I like to leave
this option unchecked, to save some screen real estate.
 Large Icons: Leave this option unchecked unless you suffer from low
vision.
 Menu animations: This option lets you select the way menus appear
and disappear. Fade is my favorite.

Help Yourself
If you ask Microsoft what happened to the Office Assistants that lurked in
Microsoft Publisher 2003, you get a terse answer: “The online Help feature in
the 2007 Microsoft Office system has been completely redesigned, and the
new design doesn’t include the Microsoft Office Assistant.” (I heard a rumor
that the assistants were spotted at a theme park in central Florida. Personally,
I suspect foul play.)
So, you have no cute little animated characters to tell you how to do stuff.
Are you stuck? Not by a long shot.
To display the Help system, use any of these methods:
 Press F1.
 Type a word or phrase in the Search box, located to the right of the main
menu bar tool, and then press Enter.
 Choose Help➪Microsoft Office Publisher Help.
The Help system window consists of two panes (see Figure 3-10). You can use
the pane on the left, labeled Table of Contents, to search for a topic of interest.
Use the pane on the right, the Topics pane, to read what Publisher has to say
about the topic.
Figure 3-10:

52
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

You can manipulate the Help system, which shows up in its own window, just
like any other window, by resizing or moving it to your heart’s desire. After the
information you’re looking for is displayed in the right pane, you can choose
to hide the left pane by clicking the Close button in the Table of Contents pane
or by clicking the Hide Table of Contents button (it looks like an open book)
on the Help window’s toolbar. Use the Back and Forward buttons — the left-
and right-pointing arrows, respectively — to retrace the steps of your journey
through Help Land. The button that looks like a printer prints the contents of
the right pane. (I bet you already knew that!) The last button (the one that
looks like a push pin) forces the Help windows to remain on top of the
Publisher window. Click the button a second time to turn off the feature.
The Table of Contents pane lists a series of “books” containing information
about various topics. Click a book to open it and reveal its contents. Books
contain pages (no surprise there) and other books. Continue opening books
until you see the page that describes the subject you want help with. Click
the page to have its contents displayed in the Topics pane, on the right.
The Search box, located right above the Table of Contents pane, works just as
you would expect: Simply type your question in the Search text box and click
Search. In the list of results that appears to the right of the Table of Contents
pane, click the topic that most closely describes the task you need help with.
The Help information is then displayed in the Topics pane, on the right, replac-
ing the list of results. Click the down arrow next to the Search text box to
repeat a previous search.
The Help system isn’t context sensitive. That is, when the Help window opens,
you don’t simply jump to a topic of interest based on the program’s current
status or a selected feature. You can tell Publisher to jump to Help on a specific
topic, however, by either
 Selecting a topic in the Table of Contents pane
 Typing a word or phrase in the Search box, to the right of the menu 
bar, and pressing Enter
Click the drop-down arrow on the Search button to tell Publisher exactly
where you want to search for the answer to your question. Your online
options, as shown in Figure 3-11, are described in this list:
 All Publisher: Search all Microsoft Publisher 2007 online resources.
 Publisher Help: Search the Publisher online Help files.
 Publisher Templates: Search only in the online Publisher templates.
 Publisher Training: Search only in the Microsoft Publisher 2007 training
resources online.
 Developer Reference: Gain access to online information about developing
Visual Basic Applications (VBA) for Microsoft Publisher 2007.
53
Chapter 3: Basic Training

When you aren’t connected to the Internet, or when you have chosen to
search only on your local computer, your choices are
 Publisher Help: Search only the Microsoft Publisher 2007 help files on
your local computer.
 Developer Reference: Gain access to information about developing
Visual Basic Applications (VBA) for Microsoft Publisher 2007.
As you move from task to task in the Help window, the Help system remembers
the path you take. To return to a previous Help topic, click the Back button,
which appears on the toolbar just above the Search box. By doing so, you
retrace your steps in reverse order.
Finding a topic
The Help system works just like an Internet search engine. Type a word in the
Search text box and click the Search button or press Enter. The Help system
displays one or more results in the Topics pane. Click the link that most closely
matches the topic you’re looking for.
Figure 3-11:
Tell
Publisher
where to
search.
54
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

Notice that, under each link representing the results of your query, the Help
system shows the path you can follow in the table of contents to find your
answer. If you search for the term WordArt, for example, the first result dis-
played in the Topics pane is Add, Change, or Delete WordArt. Click the link to
display the topic you want. Under that link is the path Help➪General Graphics
and Objects➪Adding or Deleting Graphics or Objects. From the Help system’s
Table of Contents pane, you can select General Graphics and Objects and then
select the Adding or Deleting Graphics or Objects subtopic to reach the same
WordArt entry.
Try a synonym to find related instructions and explanations.
When you click anywhere outside the Publisher Help window, the Help
window disappears. Click the Publisher Help button on the Windows taskbar
to bring back the window. When you’re finished with the Help window, click
its Close button.
Inch by inch; step by step
When you click a topic in the Table of Contents pane of the Help window, the
Topics pane displays either a list of related topics or, sometimes, a list of num-
bered steps to achieve your goal. Figure 3-12 shows an example of step-by-step
instructions.

Chapter 3: Basic Training

The Topics pane can also display blue text, which Publisher underlines when
you point the mouse at it. Place the mouse pointer over the blue, underlined
text, and the pointer turns into a hand. The hand pointer indicates that you’re
pointing at a hyperlink. Click it to view information that’s relevant to the 
current Help topic.
Things You Can Do with Files
You use files to store your work or your data in a computer. I like to look at
my work, so I spend a lot of time staring at the Windows Explorer window.
Publisher files, or publications, have the .pub file extension. You can create
files, open and close files, modify files, and save the changes you make to
your files. You need to do most such file tasks from within Publisher, but you
can do some general housecleaning tasks on your files (tasks you probably
know about already just because you own a computer) from outside the pro-
gram. The following sections cover the “innie and outie” ways of dealing with
Publisher files.
Playing with files on the outside
The following short list describes the tasks you can do outside Publisher:
 Select a file (or files): Click the file on the Windows desktop or in
Windows Explorer, or click and drag a selection rectangle around a 
set of contiguous files. You can also hold down the Shift key and click
additional files to extend or reduce your range of selected files.
 Move a file: On the Windows desktop or in Windows Explorer, click and
drag the file to a new location.
 Copy a file: On the Windows desktop or in Windows Explorer, press Ctrl
and click and drag the file to a new location.
Okay, I realize that you can accomplish this task inside Publisher by using
the Save As command to copy a file, but this method is much, much faster
in the Windows interface.
 Create a shortcut file: On the Windows desktop or in Windows Explorer,
click and drag the file to a new location by using the right mouse button.
Choose the Create Shortcuts Here command from the context-sensitive
menu that appears. (If you aren’t sure what a context-sensitive menu
looks like, check out Figure 3-13. Notice that you can also use this menu
to copy and move files.)
 Delete a file: On the Windows desktop or in Windows Explorer, click the
file to select it and then press Delete on your keyboard. Or, click and
drag the file to the Recycle Bin.
56
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

One thing I love about Windows is that these actions are recoverable. If you
think that you made a mistake, you can choose Edit➪Undo or press Ctrl+Z in
your current Desktop folder or Windows Explorer, and the action is reversed.
Cool! If you make a mistake and delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete,
all is not (necessarily) lost. Open the Recycle Bin folder, select that file in the
list, and choose File➪Restore. Your file jumps back to its original location.
Your deleted file isn’t really in jeopardy until you give the Empty Recycle Bin
command or until the Recycle Bin fills up and needs the space. In that case,
the files are deleted by date (first in, first out — or FIFO). If the deletion was
made by using the menu command and not because of disk space require-
ments, you still might be able to recover your file: Restart your computer in
MS-DOS mode and use the Recover command to try to get your file back. Or,
buy a file utility program, such as Norton Utilities, that has the recovery func-
tion. The most important thing you can do if you empty the Recycle Bin and
need to recover a file is to refrain from performing any other file operations
in the meantime. That way, the file system is less likely to overwrite the disk
sectors that contain the information from the deleted file.
Always keep adequate copies and save your files by using the Backup option
described later in this chapter. You should never need to recover a publication
from the Recycle Bin.
Now that I’ve briefly described the things you can do with files outside
Publisher, I turn my attention to the operations you can do inside Publisher.
Starting a publication
Publisher prompts you to create a publication every time you start a session
(that is, launch the program). The first thing you notice is the Getting Started
with Microsoft Publisher 2007 window, which is divided into three main sec-
tions. The Microsoft Publisher Publication Types pane is displayed on the 
left side of the screen and lists all the different kinds of publications template
available — if you haven’t turned off that option. The center of the screen 
initially displays the Popular Publication Types pane. After you select a
Figure 3-13:

option.
57
Chapter 3: Basic Training

Publication Type from the list in the left pane, this center pane will show
thumbnails (little pictures) of the various styles of the selected Publication
Type. On the right side of the screen you see the Recent Publications pane.
If you’re already in a Publisher session, you can get to the Getting Started with
Microsoft Office Publisher 2007 screen (shown in Figure 3-14) by choosing
File➪New.
In the Publication Types pane, Publisher shows the list of publication types it
can help you create. From the Publication Types list, click the type of publica-
tion you want to create, select a design from the center pane, and then click
the Create button that appears in the lower-right part of the screen.
After you make your selections, the new publication opens in the window 
on-screen with the title Publication1 – Microsoft Publisher – Print Publication
on the title bar.
You can also open any Publisher publication and choose File➪Save As to
create a new publication. Now you can safely modify the new publication to
your heart’s content without altering the original.
Don’t forget to choose either the Save or Save As command to save your new
publication to disk; otherwise, it might exist only in your memory.

Opening remarks
When you launch Publisher, the program opens the Getting Started with
Microsoft Office Publisher 2007 screen so that you can create a new file. If
you really want an existing publication, though, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open from the main menu.
The Open Publication dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-15.
2. Click to select the publication of interest. (You might need to use the
Look In drop-down list to navigate to the correct folder for your file.)
You can look over the Publication Preview (a thumbnail image of the
first page of your publication) in the right pane of the Open dialog box
by clicking the down arrow on the Views button and selecting Preview.
(Refer to Figure 3-15.)
3. Click Open to open the publication.
After you’re in a Publisher session, choose File➪New to see the Getting
Started with Microsoft Office Publisher 2007 screen again. (Are you smiling
yet? What could be friendlier than this?)
The Open Publication dialog box is a standard Windows interface element,
only slightly altered to accommodate the capabilities that Publisher offers.
You locate files in the file hierarchy by clicking the Look In drop-down list or
the Up One Level button. The List button and Details button let you change
the way the list box displays the file contents for your current folder.
You can filter your view of the File list box contents by choosing the appropri-
ate filter from the Files of Type drop-down list. You can also click the down
arrow on the Open button and select Open Read-Only to open the publication
in read-only mode. You can then view a file, but you can’t make any changes.

Chapter 3: Basic Training

Feel free to open multiple publications simultaneously. After you open one,
just repeat the process to open additional publications. As for switching
among several open publications, you have these choices:
 Click the Windows Taskbar icon representing the publication you want
(the easiest method).
 Click the Window menu in Publisher, and then select the name of the
publication you want to see.
 Hold down the Alt key and press the Tab key until the publication you
want is highlighted. Then release both keys.
In some cases, having multiple publications open on your screen can be
useful. Because Publisher is drag-and-drop–enabled, you can click an object
or a frame and drag it to another publication to create a copy of that object.
Finding files
If you know you have a publication on your machine but aren’t sure where it
is, you can use Windows Desktop Search to look for it. Choose Tools➪Search
to see the Windows Desktop Search dialog box, shown in Figure 3-16. This
dialog box lets you search for Publisher files on any drive your computer can
see. Select a drive or folder to search by clicking the ellipsis (...) next to the
Folder text box. In the search text box, type *.pub and then click the Desktop
button. (The * is a wild card character that Windows interprets to mean “any
file name.”) Double-click a file in the Results pane to open it.
Use this button to set a
search location.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

Saving your files means never 
having to say you’re sorry
Publisher lets you save two kinds of files: Microsoft Publisher publication
(.pub) files and various forms of text files. For the most part, when you work
with page layout in Publisher, you’re interested in saving publication files.
Because you can create text in Publisher in the form of stories or stand-alone
text frames, Publisher lets you save your text in a number of formats: plain
text, interchange formats such as the rich text format (RTF), and any one of
several word processor formats. This feature lets you move your text back
and forth with agility between Publisher and any standard word processor.
File-saving formats
A .pub file is the proprietary Publisher format for saving layout information.
Other page layout programs may save to .pub files — but they aren’t Microsoft
Publisher 2007 .pub files. To use a .pub file inside Publisher 2007, you have 
to save a page layout file in another program as a Microsoft Publisher 2007
.pub file. And, if you decide to open in another program a .pub file created 
in Microsoft Publisher 2007, you need to save the file in a format that the other
program can read or you need a mechanism to convert the Microsoft Publisher
2007 .pub file format during the file opening process. Generally speaking, you
can’t work with .pub files between Microsoft Publisher 2007 and other pro-
grams, such as Quark XPress or PageMaker, because page layout programs
implement their page formatting in very different ways.
If you plan to share your publications with someone who has an earlier ver-
sion of Microsoft Publisher (Microsoft Publisher 2000 or Microsoft Publisher
98, for example) you can do so, but you have to save your publications in the
appropriate format.
Publications (well, all computer files) are quite unwilling to share their names
with another file in the same folder. Multiple files with the same name can exist
in different locations among your computer’s disks, however. If you try to 
save a publication to a folder in which a publication of that same name already
exists, Publisher opens a dialog box to warn you of the impending duel to the
death. Click the Yes button in this dialog box to overwrite the first file with
your new one. Click the No button to return to your publication, where you 
can come up with a new name that doesn’t inspire such territorial disputes.
Working with text is an entirely different matter. There’s a way of getting text
into and out of just about any word processor you want to work in. You can
save text to any one of these text formats:
 Plain text: This format saves text only as lower ASCII characters in a .txt
file — which means you get just plain text, with alphanumeric characters
and a few common symbols. All formatting and font information, in other
61
Chapter 3: Basic Training

words, is lost. Any word processor worth its salt can open .txt files.
Saving in this format, the lowest common denominator, doesn’t preserve
all your work.
 Rich Text Format: The .rtf format is an interchange format developed 
by Microsoft to let programs exchange text files that contain formatting
information. In the files, instructions on how to format specific characters
and paragraphs are contained in directions given as plain text characters.
Most word processors support opening and saving .rtf files.
 Word Processor Filters: Publisher contains filters to save text to 
specific file formats, including Word 2007, Word 97–2003, Word 6.0/95,
Word 97 and 6.0/95 RTF, and Word 2.x for Windows; Works 3.0 and 4.0 for
Windows; Windows Write; and WordPerfect 5.x, WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS,
WordPerfect 5.x for Windows, WordPerfect 5.1 or 5.2 Secondary File, and
WordPerfect 5.0 Secondary File. Microsoft Publisher 2007 can also save
to several Microsoft Word for Apple Macintosh formats.
Saving a Publisher document to one of the text formats mentioned above saves
only the text. The pictures and the layout of the document do not get saved.
Publisher can open and import from most file formats to which it can 
save text; that is, it can bring text files from these other formats into your
Publisher layout. I say more about this topic in Chapter 6. For the sake of
completeness, though, here’s the list of formats that Publisher can use to
import text files: Microsoft Excel Worksheet; Plain Text and Plain Text (DOS);
Recover Text from Any File; Rich Text Format; Windows Write; Word 6.0/95
for Windows and Macintosh; Word (Asian versions) 6.0/95; Word 97; Word 2.x
for Windows; WordPerfect 5.x and 6.x; and Works 3.0 and 4.0 for Windows.
I must say that if you can’t get your word processing files into and out of
Publisher by using this list of formats, it’s time to replace your word proces-
sor. Every word processor I know of can convert at least one of these formats.
File-saving mechanics
Here’s the deal about saving your files:
 Anything you see on your screen belongs to your computer.
 Anything you save to disk belongs to you.
It’s really that simple. If you forget to save your work and the power goes
out, your work is lost. On the Save tab of the Options dialog box, check
the Save AutoRecover Information Every x Minutes check box and enter
a time period in the text box. Publisher opens a dialog box telling you
that it’s time to save your work every so often (anywhere from 1 to 120
minutes). Get in the habit of clicking Yes.

Save early and often. When you create a new publication, it doesn’t really
exist until you save it to disk.
To save your file, choose one of these methods:
 Choose the File➪Save (or Ctrl+S) or the File➪Save As command.
 Click the Save button (shown in the margin) on the Standard toolbar.
For a new publication, the Save command is identical to the Save As com-
mand. If you choose either command, the standard Save As dialog box (shown
in Figure 3-17) appears. The dialog box prompts you to choose a Save In loca-
tion and to specify a filename. After you save the file once, any subsequent
Save command saves your changes without displaying the Save As dialog box
again. The Save As command enables you to create a new file or overwrite
your old one.
If you want to locate a folder in the file system, you can click the Up One
Level button (or press Alt+2) to move up the hierarchy or click the Save In
drop-down list box to move about any distance. If you want to create a new
folder, go to the folder where you want to store the new folder, click the New
Folder button (or press Alt+4), and enter a new folder name in place of the
highlighted name New Folder that’s in the text box.
You can change how files look in the file list box by clicking the Views button
located in the top-right of the Save As dialog box. Figure 3-18 shows you the
Save As dialog box in Details view, for example.
As you create a publication, save multiple copies of it as you progress. Then,
if you decide that you like the publication better in a previous state, you 
can return to it. You can never be too thin, have too much RAM, or have too
many backups.

Insurance, please
I can’t always count on a hard drive working, so I back up to another hard
drive, a CD, or a USB memory drive. And, I assume that my first backup will
fail, so I back up anything important again. (Have I told you that I’m para-
noid? Well, just because I am doesn’t mean that they aren’t out to get me!)
If you click the down arrow on the Save button in the Save As dialog box, you
see a Save with Backup option that does two things for you:
 Allows you to return (or revert, as it’s known in other programs) to the
last previously saved state of the file
 Protects you from file corruption by providing a backup to revert to.
Publications can become large and complex, which makes them more
susceptible to corruption than smaller files. (This statement is also true
of files that are used frequently, such as font files.)
Backup files don’t contain any changes you made to your publication since
you last saved the file. That is, if you save a publication three times during 
a session, the backup publication contains the file in the state it was in after
two saves.
You can recover from a computer disaster by reverting to a backup copy 
of a publication, one that contains the words Backup of in front of the file
name. You don’t see these files on the Recent Publications tab, so you will
have to open them from the Open dialog box. You can search for backup files
by using the phrase backup of * in the Find This File text box in the Find File
dialog box. (See the section Finding Files earlier in this chapter.) Double-click
the backup file of interest. It opens, and you can work in that copy and save it
Figure 3-18:

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

out to a new file with a name of your choosing. From then on, the backup file
is one of your choices in the Existing Publications tab.
A backup file takes the same name as your original publication but uses the
.bak extension. The only drawback to using the Backup option is that it 
doubles your disk space requirements.
Unless you’re hurting for space on your hard drive, hedge your bet and
always select the Backup option.
If you create backups, you can safely tell the dealer, “Hit me.”
Canning templates
You can think of a template as a piece of stationery containing all the content
and formatting that was in it when you saved the file as a template. Templates
provide a convenient starting place for your work and capture details that you
want to make sure not to change. Template files are stored as .pub files.
If you view a template’s properties, you see that a template is a file with the
Archive bit or file attribute set to On. Different programs use this setting for 
different purposes. You’re probably familiar with the use of the Archive bit 
to determine whether a file has been backed up. A backup program starts by
turning off all Archive settings and then turns them on individually as it per-
forms a backup on that file. Publisher uses the Archive bit to decide whether
the file is a template and cannot be overwritten (changed) by a Save command.
From a practical standpoint, a template lets you create a publication based
on that template. That file opens as an unsaved publication, without any
name. When you use a template, the program prompts you to use the Save 
As command to create a new file. The new file then behaves like any other
publication. If you try to save the file to the same location and with the same
name, Publisher opens a dialog box like the one shown in Figure 3-19. This
dialog box warns that a publication already exists and that you will overwrite
the existing file. You can overwrite the file with another template or with a
normal publication file.

Nag me
Many programs automatically save (autosave) changes for you every so
often. Page layout programs, because they involve artistic endeavors, do 
not, as a rule, perform autosaves. You must manually save your file along
with any changes you make to it that you want to retain. Publisher (because
it’s a do-bee, for those of you who remember Romper Room) saves your work
from time to time automatically.
You can change this behavior by disabling the option or changing the fre-
quency with which the program autosaves files. Choose Tools➪Options, and
then click the Save tab in the Options dialog box. At the bottom of this dialog
box, deselect the Save AutoRecover Info Every X Minutes check box or enter 
a new number in the Minutes text box. The number you type must be at least 
1 and no more than 120. This setting specifies the number of minutes that you
work inside Publisher before it autosaves your publication.
Another check box you might want to select on the User Assistance tab of the
Options dialog box is Show Tippages. This option posts a helpful message box
the first time you perform a particular operation and also when it detects an
operation that’s causing you difficulty.
Close calls
If you have no changes to save in a file, you can close your publication without
bother by choosing the File➪Close command. If you made changes, Publisher
opens a dialog box (shown in Figure 3-20) asking you if you want to save your
changes first before closing the file. Click Yes to save your changes (the
default), No to discard them, or Cancel to abort the Close operation and 
continue working in your publication.
I know of only four methods for closing a publication:
 Choose the aforementioned File➪Close command.
 Click the Close box in the Microsoft Publisher 2007 window, 
on the far right side of the title bar.
 Press Alt+F4.
 Choose File➪Exit to close the program.
Figure 3-20:
You want to
save that?
66
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Publisher 2007 

Shut Down without Crash-Landing
You should close Publisher whenever you finish using the program or you
finish your session and want to shut down your computer: Choose File➪Exit.
If you try to close Publisher without saving changes made to a file, a dialog
box asks whether you want to save your changes. If you have no changes to
save, the program closes directly, and the memory (RAM) used to store the
program is released for use by other programs.
To close Publisher, choose the File➪Exit command or press Alt+F4. Also, 
you can automatically close various programs when you use the Shut Down
command from the Windows Start menu.
So far, so good. Keep in mind, though, that you might not always be able to
close Publisher correctly — if a program freezes your computer or the power
goes out, for example. In either case, all your changes are lost. Your file saved
to disk is unaffected by the power outage. (Oh, did I mention that you should
save your work early and often?)

In this part . . .
T
his part shows you how to work with pages and
objects in ways that make your page layout both
faster and more precise. You also see how your selected
printer affects your design.
Microsoft Publisher 2007 has many aids to help you
design pages carefully, and many different page designs
are already built into the program for you. This part also
discusses frames and text boxes, which are the containers
for the various objects and elements you place on a page.

W
hen you start a publication, Publisher determines the publication’s
basic settings for you — the number of pages, the page size, and some
margin guides, for example. This default feature is all well and good if you like
the decisions Publisher makes, but what if you want to change a setting? You
may need to change the margins, for example, to accommodate your design
and the capabilities of your printer.
This chapter describes your publication’s basic element — the page — and
how to change your publication’s basic structure, from tasks as minor as
adjusting margins to more complex tasks, such as converting a three-fold
brochure into a 15-foot banner.
In the Beginning: The Page
The most basic element of a Publisher publication is the individual page. 
A page in the computer world isn’t much different from a page in the real
world — it’s just a chunk of words and pictures that, when printed, all fit 
on a single piece of paper.
Pages are designed singly or as part of a multipage spread. Publisher makes 
it easy for you to move between pages, look at pages in different views and
magnifications, and add or delete pages as needed to fit your goals.

Moving from page to page
The current page is the active page — the page on which your cursor is located.
At any time, only one page in your document is the current page, even when
you’re viewing more than one page at a time. The current page is indicated in
the page-navigation controls, located in the lower-left corner of the Publisher
window. The current page is the one represented by the buff-colored page. All
other pages are white. Figure 4-1 shows the page-navigation controls.
After you have more than one page in your publication, you can move to
another page in several ways:
 Choose Edit➪Go To Page from the main menu, and then type the number
of the page you want to work on in the Go To Page dialog box, shown in
Figure 4-2.
 Press F5 to open the Go To Page dialog box; Ctrl+PgDn to move to the
next page; and Ctrl+PgUp to move to the previous page.
 Press Ctrl+G to display the Go To Page dialog box.
 Click the page you want to go to in the page-navigation controls.

dialog box.

Part II: Mark This Page 

Scrolling within a page
You use the scroll bars, arrows, and boxes along the right side and at the
bottom of your screen to view different parts of the current page. Here’s 
what you can do with the various scroll bar parts:
 Scroll arrows: Click a scroll arrow to slide your view a little bit in the
direction of that arrow. If you press and hold down the mouse button,
the publication continues to scroll.
 Scroll boxes: Drag the scroll box (it slides like an elevator in a shaft) to
slide your view any amount in that same direction.
 Scroll bar: Click above or below the scroll box in the horizontal or verti-
cal scroll bar (the elevator shaft) to slide your view up or down a screen-
ful at a time.
These techniques affect only your view of the current page and do not move
between pages. They’re standard Windows interface techniques that work in
any Windows window.
In addition to using the scroll bars to move your view of a page in the
window, you can use these keyboard shortcuts:
 Press PgDn (Page Down) to move your view down one screenful.
 Press PgUp (Page Up) to move your view up one screenful.
 Press Ctrl+right arrow to scroll to the right.
 Press Ctrl+left arrow to scroll to the left.
By using the last two shortcuts on the list, you scroll an amount that varies,
depending on your current magnification and view.
If all this makes Publisher seem like a game of Motocross Madness or Microsoft
Combat Flight Simulator, that’s all good. These keystrokes save you a lot of time.
Changing What You See On-Screen
In precise page layout work, you want to move quickly between different
views and magnifications. The idea here is that you should be able to work
with a detail on your layout and then jump to a view that lets you get an
overview of your document to see how the change looks in context.
73
Chapter 4: Working with Pages

If you’re familiar with all the different views you find in a word processor —
for example, the Normal, Outline, and Page Layout views available in Microsoft
Word — you may be surprised to find that Publisher offers only one kind 
of view: a live, or editable, page preview. Why does it offer just one mode?
Because the purpose of a page layout program is to create and display a page
the way it will look when you print it.
Even so, Publisher gives you ways to change how your page looks on-screen.
Most of these ways reside within the View menu. You can choose to see a
single page or two-page spread, and you can change the magnification of the
page or pages you’re viewing.
Two-page spreads
Many publications, including this very book, are designed with pairs of pages
that form facing pages. Facing pages, also known as a two-page spread, are
what your readers see — and what you, as a designer, design for.
If you’re looking at a single page and want to see your layout as a two-page
spread (to see two facing pages side by side), choose View➪Two-Page Spread
from the main menu. Odd-numbered pages (1, 3, 5, and so on) are displayed
on the right side of the Publisher screen, whereas even-numbered pages 
(2, 4, 6, and so on) are displayed on the left side.
The standard setup for professional publications, such as this book, starts the
text on a right-hand page. Therefore, if your publication has an even number
of pages, the first page of the publication is displayed by itself in the middle
of the screen, and the last page is displayed by itself in the middle of the
screen. If your publication has only one page, that page is displayed by itself
in the middle of the Publisher screen.
After you choose the Two-Page Spread command, a check mark appears next
to the command on the View menu. Clicking the Two-Page Spread command a
second time returns you to the Single Page view at the current magnification.
Your publication doesn’t have to be a facing-page publication to take advantage
of Two-Page Spread view. Use this view at your convenience.
Whole Page and Page Width views
In addition to switching between one- and two-page views, you can view whole
pages at one time or view pages in the largest magnification that still shows
the entire width of the page or the two-page spread. Choose one of these
methods:
74
Part II: Mark This Page 

 Choose View➪Zoom➪Whole Page or press Ctrl+Shift+L to resize the cur-
rent page or two-page spread so that it appears at the largest possible
magnification to fill your screen. This view gives you an overview of
your layout.
 Choose View➪Zoom➪Page Width to switch to a view of your document
that fills the screen horizontally, whether you’re in Single Page view or
Two-Page Spread view. In this view, you probably have to scroll vertically
to see the entire document, but you don’t have to scroll horizontally.
Press the F9 key to toggle back and forth between the current view and the
actual size (100 percent) of your document.
If you select one or more objects before choosing the View➪Zoom command,
you see a new option on the Zoom submenu: Selected Objects. When you
choose this option, Publisher resizes your page to the largest magnification
that still shows the selected objects.
Figure 4-3 shows a single-page document in Whole Page view. Figure 4-4 shows
the same document in Page Width view.

Chapter 4: Working with Pages

Zooming around
The Zoom box, located on the Standard toolbar, indicates the current magni-
fication percentage; 100 percent is the actual size. To enlarge or reduce the
on-screen size of your publications — much as though you were holding one
end of a telescope to your eye while looking at the screen and then switching
to look through the telescope’s other end — click the down arrow in the
Zoom box to reveal the drop-down list, shown in Figure 4-5. If you have used
the Zoom feature in other Microsoft Office programs, you should feel very
comfortable with this feature in Publisher because it works the same way.
Figure 4-5:

76
Part II: Mark This Page 

If you can’t find the Zoom box, it’s probably because Publisher is displaying
both the Standard and Formatting toolbars on one line. To make Publisher
display the Standard and Formatting toolbars on two rows (and thus enable
you to see the Zoom box), choose Tools➪Customize from the main menu.
Click the Options tab and check the Show Standard and Formatting Toolbars
on Two Rows check box.
Some things to keep in mind when doing your zooming:
 The selections on the Zoom drop-down list are the same ones you see
when you choose View➪Zoom from the main menu.
 You see the Selected Objects command on the Zoom drop-down list only
when you have an object selected on the layout. This command magni-
fies the layout to the largest view that still contains the object, and 
centers the object on your screen.
 If you right-click anywhere on the layout, you see a context menu. This
menu contains the Zoom command which, when chosen, displays the
Whole Page, Page Width, and Selected Objects commands.
Lining Things Up
No matter how comfortable you are with your mouse, aligning things freehand
is tough work. I know because I have a cordless, optical, laser-precision mouse,
and I still have trouble getting things to line up without some help. Fortunately,
the Publisher electronic guidance devices can help to steady your trembling
hands so that objects fall into perfect place with ease. (Don’t confuse the
Publisher electronic guidance devices with those used in so-called “smart
bombs” developed for the military.) This section looks at layout guides and
ruler guides and then shows you how to activate the powerful Snap To com-
mands to get everything to line up neatly.
Margin and grid guides
Layout guides are an excellent way to determine where to place various
objects on each page. Layout guides don’t appear on your printout. On-
screen, however, these blue or pink lines provide visual references on every
page. Using the Publisher Snap To feature, you can almost magically align
objects with these blue or pink lines.
77
Chapter 4: Working with Pages

Publisher provides three types of layout guides:
 Margin guides define the boundary of your printable area.
 Grid guides let you set up a grid to make it easier to design your 
publication.
 Baseline guides help you align text across the columns of a multi-
column publication.
Margin guides appear automatically in every publication. Margin guides gen-
erally indicate where you should and shouldn’t plop objects; they also help
you align objects along the perimeter of each page. You’re free to put objects
anywhere you want, regardless of the margins, however. (Whether those
objects look good there and whether they actually print are other matters
altogether.)
Grid guides, like the lines on graph paper, are excellent tools for aligning any
and all objects that you don’t want to align to the margin guides. For exam-
ple, you may want to set a graphic in the direct center of the page. Grid
guides can help you do this.
Baseline guides help you align text in between text boxes in columns even
though the text boxes aren’t linked. (When text boxes are linked, text from
one text box automatically flows to the next text box when the first box 
fills up.)
If you don’t want your text to be aligned across columns, turn off the feature.
Choose Format➪Paragraph (for this to work, you must have text in a text box
selected). Then, on the Indents and Spacing tab, deselect the Align Text to
Baseline Guides check box.
Professional designers — whether they work on a computer or on paper —
generally lay out pages according to grids. For example, when creating a
three-fold brochure, they use a three-part grid to visually separate the three
panels of each page where that brochure eventually will be folded. Or, they
may divide nonfolding pages into a grid of rows and columns to see how dif-
ferent parts of the page visually relate to each other and to the page as a
whole. In this way, designers can ensure that their pages are readable, are not
crowded, and are visually appealing with appropriate spacing and correct
alignment.
When you use templates to begin a publication, Publisher sets up grid guides
automatically to save you the trouble of doing it yourself. Of course, you can
always change them, if you like. To set up or change layout guides, choose
Arrange➪Layout Guides. The Layout Guides dialog box, shown in Figure 4-6,
appears.
78
Part II: Mark This Page 

You set the margins for your printed page on the Margin Guides tab of the
Layout Guides dialog box. Different printers require different margin settings.
If you set margins narrower than your printer will print, your page doesn’t
print properly. Text and figures are cut off at the margins. (I discuss printing
in depth in Chapter 13.)

Chapter 4: Working with Pages
In the gutter
If you want different margin guides for left-
facing pages than for right-facing pages, be
sure to select the Two-Page Master check box
on the Margin Guides tab of the Layout Guides
dialog box. This option is important for facing-
page publications that will be bound, such as
books. When you select this option, the Left and
Right text boxes in the Margin Guides area
change to Inside and Outside text boxes. Any
change you make to the Inside setting affects
the right (inside) margin of left-facing pages.
The Inside setting also affects the left (inside)
margin of right-facing pages. The Outside set-
ting adjusts the outside margins — right mar-
gins on right-facing pages and left margins on
left-facing pages.
Facing pages typically have different internal
margins (gutters), to accommodate the publica-
tion’s binding. If you’re preparing facing pages
that will be bound, be sure to specify different
numbers in the Inside and Outside text boxes.
Generally, the inside should be larger than the
outside margins by the amount that the binding
will consume. The person who will bind the 
publication should provide you with this mea-
surement.
With this setup, you can easily create the extra
room necessary on each page to accommodate
the room that’s lost because of the binding.
Without this extra room, your pages can look
lopsided, and objects on those pages can get
buried in the gutter.
When your gutters are properly set, you can
spread objects across facing pages. Depending
on the target printer’s capabilities (how close to
the edge of the paper it’s capable of printing, for
example), the object might not print completely.
For objects for which the cutoff doesn’t matter
(patterns, spot color, and fills), this technique is
valuable.

On the Grid Guides tab of the Layout Guides dialog box, enter the number of
columns and rows you want. Grid guides evenly divide the space contained
by the margin guides. If you want to change the amount of space between the
columns or rows, use the arrows next to the respective Spacing boxes.
If you can’t see your layout guides after setting them, check the View menu to
see whether the View Boundaries and Guides command is hiding your guides.
If the View Boundaries and Guides command appears on the menu without a
check mark next to it, choose that command or press Ctrl+Shift+O. To hide
the guides again, reapply the View Boundaries and Guides command or press
Ctrl+Shift+O again. If you still can’t see your guides, they may be covered by
other objects, such as lines or a frame boundary.
Ruler guides
In addition to setting layout guides, you can set ruler guides anywhere on
your page. Ruler guides let you arrange elements on your page at any hori-
zontal or vertical position you want. You can create as many ruler guides as
you need. This list describes how to work with ruler guides:
 To create a vertical guide: Position the mouse cursor over the vertical
ruler until the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow. Then click and
drag from the vertical ruler right to the desired position on your layout.
A green dotted line appears and remains when you release the mouse
button.
 To create a horizontal guide: Position the mouse cursor over the hori-
zontal ruler. Then click and drag from the horizontal ruler down to the
desired position on your layout.
 To place a vertical guide in the exact center of your view: Choose
Arrange➪Ruler Guides➪Add Vertical Ruler Guide. Publisher places a
vertical guide in the exact center of the page.
 To place a horizontal guide in the exact center of your view: Choose
Arrange➪Ruler Guides➪Add Horizontal Ruler Guide. Publisher places a
horizontal guide across the center of the page.
 To move a ruler guide: Just click and drag it.
 To remove a ruler guide: Click and drag the ruler off the page.
 To remove all ruler guides: Choose the Arrange➪Ruler Guides➪
Clear All Ruler Guides command.

Snap to it!
Guides would be interesting visual aids but not generally worth the bother if
you couldn’t automatically align objects to them. Publisher (like most layout
and drawing programs) has a Snap to Guides feature, which directly aligns
objects you place close to a guide.
The Snap To commands make it appear as though the guides magnetically
tug at your objects as those objects draw near, just as Magneto might use his
magnetic powers to snatch the glasses from Cyclops’ head. With these “mag-
netic” forces in place, you can be sure that any objects you draw or drag near
a guide automatically align with that guide and with each other. You can also
make objects snap to the nearest ruler mark (increment), if you like. You can
even make objects snap to other objects.
Here’s how to toggle the Snap To commands on and off:
 Choose Arrange➪Snap➪To Ruler Marks to align with your ruler marks.
 Choose Arrange➪Snap➪To Guides (or press Ctrl+Shift+W) to align with
your layout guides.
 Choose Arrange➪Snap➪To Objects to align with selected objects on-
screen. See Chapter 5 for more about objects.
A check mark next to the command name means that the option is turned on;
click it to turn it off. The absence of a check mark means that the option is
turned off; click it to turn it on. For some reason, the Snap➪To Objects com-
mand has no check mark. When this command is turned on, you see a colored
background on the icon next to the command. When the Snap➪To Objects
command is turned off, the colored background goes away.
In my experience, the Snap➪To Guides command is so much more useful
than snapping to ruler marks. That’s why it gets the special Ctrl+Shift+W
shortcut. I find this command more helpful, in part because you can set up
your own guides (whereas you can’t control the ruler marks) and in part
because those rulers have so darned many marks.
Publisher offers other commands that help you precisely place objects on
your layout. (I discuss these commands in Chapter 5.) In particular, you may
want to explore the use of the Align or Distribute commands to precisely
align objects to your page. Publisher also has Nudge commands that let you
use your arrow keys on the keyboard to move your objects a very small
amount at a time in any direction. To set up the Nudge commands, choose
Tools➪Options from the main menu to open the Options dialog box, and
81
Chapter 4: Working with Pages

select the Edit tab. Then select the Arrow Keys Nudge Objects By check box
and type the amount to nudge the selected object by in the adjacent text box.
The minimum and maximum amounts you can enter into the Arrow Keys
Nudge Objects By text box depend on the selection you make in the
Measurement Units text box on the General tab of the Options dialog box.
 Centimeters: Type any number between 0.03 and 5.08. The default is
0.03 centimeters.
 Inches: Type any number between 0.01 and 2. The default is 0.13 inches.
 Picas: Type any number between 0.06 and 12. The default is 0.07 picas.
 Points: Type any number between 0.72 and 144. The default is 0.84 points.
 Pixels: Type any number between 0.096 and 192. The default is 1.12 pixels.
Using Virtual Rulers
You can use the status bar to determine an object’s position and size, or you
can use the on-screen rulers, located along the top and left edges of the scratch
area. The current position of the cursor is indicated by a sliding line that
appears on each of your rulers. To do fine measuring with the rulers, you can
enlarge them simply by zooming in on the page. As you magnify a page, the
rulers also grow larger.
The unit of measurement on each ruler is determined by the Measurement
Units setting on the General tab in the Options dialog box, opened by choos-
ing Tools➪Options. (See Chapter 3 for more on the Options dialog box.)
If the rulers aren’t shown, you can display them by choosing View➪Rulers.
An even more convenient approach is to right-click a blank area of the screen
and choose Rulers from the context-sensitive menu that appears.
To move a ruler, Shift+click and drag it to a new location. When you place
your mouse pointer over a ruler and hold down the Shift key, the cursor
changes to a two-headed arrow that points up and down if you’re pointing at
the horizontal ruler, or left and right if you’re pointing at the vertical ruler. As
you drag, an outline of the ruler accompanies your pointer. When you release
the mouse button, the ruler appears in its new location. To return a ruler to
its original location, just drag it back in place.
You can move both rulers simultaneously by clicking and dragging the Move
Both Rulers box at the intersection of the two rulers.
By default, the zero mark on each ruler is set to the upper-left corner of the
page or two-page spread. You may find it convenient to rezero a ruler: to
change the position of its zero mark, as though you were sliding the ruler end
to end over a page.
82
Part II: Mark This Page 

For example, if one object’s right edge ends at the 21⁄4 mark on the horizontal
ruler and another object’s left edge begins at the 55⁄16 mark, how much space
is between those objects? Is this math class? Who knows, and who really
cares? Wouldn’t it be easier to measure it if the horizontal ruler’s zero mark
aligned with one of those edges?
To move a ruler’s zero mark, simply point to a ruler, press and hold the Shift
key, and click the right mouse button to drag the zero mark to a new location.
The mouse pointer changes, as it does when you move a ruler, to a two-headed
arrow, pointing up and down if you’re pointing at the horizontal ruler or
pointing right and left if you’re pointing at the vertical ruler. As you drag, 
the ruler stays in place but a solid line follows your pointer. When you
release the right mouse button, the ruler rezeroes at that line.
To reset a ruler’s zero mark, double-click it. To rezero both rulers to the upper-
left corner of the page or two-page spread, double-click your left mouse button
in that blank box at the intersection of the two rulers.
When you’re working inside a text or table frame, a subsection of the horizon-
tal ruler automatically provides a special zero mark for just that frame or 
current table column. (I discuss text and table frames in Chapter 5.)
Creating Master Pages
When you create a multiple-page publication, you may want certain objects
to appear on all or most of the pages. These objects can include the publica-
tion’s title, your name, page numbers, a company logo or some other image, a
plea to send money — whatever. Publisher lets you create a Master page that
contains objects that appear on each page of your publication.
Master pages benefit you because they
 Eliminate the boring, repetitive work of placing and managing objects
that appear on every page
 Eliminate a source of bloated file sizes because information that needs
to be repeated is entered only once
 Enforce design consistency
To understand Publisher Master pages, imagine each regular publication (fore-
ground) page as a piece of see-through tracing paper laid over a cardboard
backing. You can see all the objects on the backing, along with the layer of
objects on the tracing paper. As you move from page to page, the tracing paper
changes, but the backing remains the same. If you change something on the
tracing paper, only the tracing paper changes. If you change something on 
83
Chapter 4: Working with Pages

the backing, however, that change affects the appearance of any tracing paper
laid over that backing. The Publisher Master pages work just like that card-
board backing; the foreground pages work like the pieces of tracing paper.
Any objects on a Master page are repeated on foreground pages throughout
the publication. Those Master page objects that aren’t obscured by objects
above them in the foreground print together with any foreground objects pre-
sent on each foreground page. To work with the Master page or any object on
it, you must first move the foreground pages out of the way, just as you would
lift tracing paper from a cardboard backing.
Mastering the Master page
To move to the Master page, choose View➪Master Page or press Ctrl+M.
The Ctrl+M shortcut derives from the word Master. Most page layout programs
let you create master pages.
Rarely does anything radical happen when you move to the Master page. Any
on-screen changes usually are very subtle, and the Master page may look like
just another blank publication page, sporting the same layout guides as your
publication’s foreground pages. One way to tell whether you moved to the
Master page is to look at the page-navigation controls in the lower-left corner
of your screen. If the page-navigation controls are still there, you’re in the
foreground. If the page-navigation controls have been replaced with one or
more Master page buttons that show letters rather than page numbers, it’s
proof that you successfully moved to the Master page. Perhaps the most
obvious clue that you have moved to the Master page is the sudden appear-
ance of the Edit Master Pages toolbar, shown in Figure 4-7.
To return to the foreground pages, click the Close Master View button on the
Edit Master Pages toolbar, choose View➪Master Page, or press Ctrl+M. (This
command toggles with the View➪Master Page command.) You return to the
last foreground page you were on, and the normal page controls return in 
triumph.
Figure 4-7:
The Edit
Master
Pages
toolbar.
84
Part II: Mark This Page 

Working with multiple Master pages
When you start a publication, Publisher creates just one Master page for you.
This strategy works fine for many publications, but sometimes you need a
little more flexibility. For example, you may want to create a newsletter that
has the same Master page elements (such as pictures or WordArt) on the
front and back pages but different page elements on the inside pages. For
this, you need to have more than one Master page (two, in this case).
To create a second Master page if you have only one, open the Master Page
view by choosing View➪Master Page (or pressing Ctrl+M). The Edit Master
Pages task pane, shown in Figure 4-8, lets you create new master pages. It
also displays a list of all the master pages that you have already created.
Click the New Master Page button, located at the bottom of the Edit Master
Pages task pane, and then click OK.
When you create a new background, the new Master page is blank. If you
want elements on the existing Master page to appear on the new Master
page, you have to put them there yourself.
Figure 4-8:
The Edit
Master
Pages 
task pane.
85
Chapter 4: Working with Pages

If you have more than one Master page and delete one (by selecting it in the
Edit Master Pages task pane and clicking the Delete Master Page button on
the Edit Master Pages toolbar — refer to Figure 4-7), Publisher permanently
deletes all objects on that Master page. (Fortunately, Publisher warns you
before deleting the Master page and informs you that it will apply the first
Master page to any pages in your publication that were using the deleted
Master page.)
If you delete a Master page (and all its objects) and later decide that you really
would rather not have done so, you can probably recover it by clicking the
down arrow on the Undo button on the Standard toolbar and selecting Delete
Master Page from the drop-down list. Of course, if you have saved the publi-
cation in the meantime, you’re out of luck.
To move between Master pages (if you have more than one of them), choose
one of these methods:
 Choose View➪Master Page from the main menu (or press Ctrl+M) and
then select a Master page in the Edit Master Pages task pane. (Refer to
Figure 4-8.)
 Choose View➪Master Page from the main menu (or press Ctrl+M) and
click the page-navigation control button (A or B, for example) that 
represents the Master page you want to view.
After you create your new Master page, you still have to tell Publisher which
pages should use it. Go to the page to which you want to apply a different
Master page and choose Format➪Apply Master Page. The Apply Master Page
task pane, shown in Figure 4-9, appears. In the Apply Master Page task pane,
select a Master page from the drop-down list under the page icon.
If you want to apply a Master page to a range of pages in your publication,
you can do so easily by using the Apply To section of the Apply Master Page
dialog box, shown in Figure 4-10, which appears when you click the Apply to
Page Range button in the Apply Master Page task pane.
If you’re creating a facing-page publication, such as a book or a newsletter,
and you want to have Master pages that mirror each other (that is, a graphi-
cal image close to the left margin on the left-facing page should show up
close to the right margin on the right-facing page), you don’t have to create
any additional Master pages. Go to Master Page view (choose View➪
Master Page or Ctrl+M) and place the elements you want on the Master page.
This page will become the right-facing Master page. In the Edit Master Pages
task pane, click the down arrow next to Master A and select Change to Two-
Page. Publisher automatically mirrors to the left-facing page everything you
have put on the Master page.
86
Part II: Mark This Page 

Adding Master page objects
Adding objects to Master pages is just like adding objects to foreground
pages, which I describe in Chapter 5. Because Master page and foreground
objects must share the final, printed page, however, you should consider a
couple of things before you add a Master page object:
 If you have only one Master page: Any object you put on it is repeated
on every foreground page.
Figure 4-10:

Master
page to a

Figure 4-9:
The Apply
Master
Page 
task pane.
87
Chapter 4: Working with Pages

 If you have two Master pages: Any object you put on the left Master page
is repeated on every left-hand foreground page; any object you put on
the right Master page is repeated on every right-hand foreground page;
and any object you put on both Master pages is repeated on every left-
and right-hand foreground page. You can eliminate all Master page objects
from specific foreground pages, however, as I explain later in this chapter.
Place Master page objects where they don’t interfere with foreground objects.
The easiest solution is to keep Master page objects near the margins. If you
choose to put an object in the middle of a Master page instead, it might get
covered up by a foreground object.
Also, try to add all Master page objects before you begin adding foreground
objects. Otherwise, you may need to rearrange the foreground objects to
make room for Master page objects.
Creating headers and footers
To Publisher, a header consists of stuff — text or graphics or both — that
repeats along the top of pages, whereas a footer consists of stuff that repeats
along the bottom of pages. (You’re probably already familiar with this con-
cept from your word processor, and it’s the same in Publisher.) Headers and
footers usually contain such boring and traditional information as the publi-
cation title, current chapter or other division title, author’s name, company
or publication-specific logo, and page number. Because headers and footers
are supposed to repeat on most or all pages, the Master page is the perfect
place for them.
To create headers and footers, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Header and Footer from the main menu.
Publisher displays a blinking cursor in the page header along with the
Header and Footer toolbar, as shown in Figure 4-11.
2. Type the text that you want to appear in the header.
The text you type appears in your header, at the blinking cursor.
3. Click the Show Header/Footer button on the Header and Footer tool-
bar to switch to the footer.
Microsoft Publisher displays a blinking cursor in the page footer.
4. Type the information that you want to appear at the bottom of 
every page.
The text you type appears in your footer, at the blinking cursor.
5. Click the Close button on the Header and Footer toolbar when you
finish adding text to your headers and footers.
88
Part II: Mark This Page 

Here’s a way to save yourself some work if you’re creating a facing-page pub-
lication with similar headers and footers: Set up the headers and footers on
the Master page before changing the Master page to a two-page spread.
Publisher automatically copies your headers and footers to mirrored posi-
tions on the new background.
Inserting page numbers
One of the most common uses for headers and footers is to hold page num-
bers. Publisher is more than happy to number your pages for you. (Nice 
program. Good program. Sit. Stay. Have a bone.)
To number pages, all you need to do is add a semisecret page-numbering code
(a page-number mark) to a header or footer. If your publication has two Master
pages and you want page numbers to appear on both the left and right pages,
you need to insert a page-number mark to the header or footer on both Master
pages.
Follow these steps to add page numbers to a header or footer:
1. Choose View➪Header and Footer.
Publisher displays a blinking cursor in the page header along with the
Header and Footer toolbar.
2. (Optional) In the header, type some identifying text at the blinking
cursor, such as the word Page.
3. Click the Insert Page Number button on the Header and Footer tool-
bar or press Alt+Shift+P.
The aforementioned semisecret page-numbering code — the page-
number mark — appears on the Master page. Although this mark
appears to be just a pound sign (#), it changes to the appropriate page
number on each foreground page. Honest!
4. (Optional) Select the page-number mark and format it as you would
format any other text.
Formatting text is covered in Chapter 7.
5. Click the Close button on the Header and Footer toolbar.
Figure 4-11:
The Header
and Footer
toolbar.
89
Chapter 4: Working with Pages

Don’t try to be sneaky and just type a pound sign from your keyboard to indi-
cate where you want page numbers to appear. Although it looks just like a
page-number mark, it produces only pound signs on your foreground pages.
In the foreground, each page proudly displays its own page number. By default,
Publisher uses only Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, and so on) for page numbering. If
you want to number your pages some other way, perhaps with small Roman
numerals (i, ii, iii, and so on) for the introductory pages of a book, you have to
open the Section dialog box, shown in Figure 4-12. Choose Insert➪Section from
the main menu. Then, in the Number Format drop-down list box, select the
number format you want to use.
If you’re desktop-publishing something that requires separate series of page
numbers, such as several report sections that will be printed with other
report sections, you don’t have to create each section of your publication in
a separate file to accommodate those separate series. Use the Section dialog
box (refer to Figure 4-12) to define sections. Open the Section dialog box by
choosing Insert➪Section from the main menu, and then select the Begin a
Section with This Page check box. You can then set the page numbers in each
section to continue from the previous section or to start at a number other
than 1 by changing the value in the Start At scroll box. You can also format
the page numbers in each section independently. In Publisher, you can use
any number up to 1,000.
The changes you make in the Section dialog box affect the page numbering
only for the current publication.
Getting a date
Placing dates and times in headers and footers isn’t much different from
putting page numbers there. Follow the procedure described in the preceding
section, but click the Insert Date and Insert Time buttons on the Header and
Footer toolbar rather than click the Insert Page Number button.
If want to choose a date and time in a format that’s different from the default
setting, you have to choose Insert➪Date and Time from the main menu.
Publisher opens the Date and Time dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-13. Click
Figure 4-12:
In the
Section
dialog box,
you choose
how to
format page
numbering.
90
Part II: Mark This Page 

to select a format, and then select the Update Automatically check box if you
want to create a placeholder that updates the date whenever you open or
print your publication. The program cleverly uses your computer’s date and
time. If you leave the Update Automatically check box deselected in the Date
and Time dialog box, Publisher simply inserts the current date or time and
doesn’t update it.
Suppressing Master page objects
Traditionally, headers and footers are left off a publication’s first page. In larger
publications, headers and footers are also usually left off the first page of each
chapter or other major division. The headers in this book are a prime example.
Go ahead: Flip through this book and you’ll see.
To hide all background objects, move to the foreground page for which you
want to hide Master page objects, and then choose View➪Ignore Master Page
from the main menu.
No ambiguity here — if you’re viewing a single page, the Master page objects
disappear. When you apply this command to a two-page spread, Publisher
opens the Ignore Master Page dialog box, shown in Figure 4-14, to ask you to
select which page you want to ignore — left page or right page or both.
Figure 4-14:
The Ignore
Master
Page 
dialog box.
Figure 4-13:
The Date
and Time

91
Chapter 4: Working with Pages

The Ignore Master Page command is one of those toggle commands: Issue it
once to turn it on, and issue it again to turn it off. If you’re viewing two pages,
the Ignore Master Page dialog box appears again. Just select or deselect one
or both boxes and then click OK.
Adding and Deleting Pages
Publisher offers you several ways to add pages — perhaps more ways than
you will ever need. And, if you end up with too many pages, you can, of
course, delete them.
Adding pages
When you create a blank publication or use the Quick Publication template,
Publisher creates only one page to begin with. (The other templates create a
number of pages, depending on the document type.) Regardless of how many
pages Publisher creates by default, you can always add more blank pages if
you need them.
New pages may not appear entirely blank. They may display the margin and
other layout guides that you set up to appear on every page of your publica-
tion. They may also display some Master page objects. (I discuss Master
pages and objects in greater detail in Chapter 5.)
Publisher provides an easy way to insert a blank page (or two) at the end of
your document: Just click the page-navigation control to advance to the last
page in your document, and then press Ctrl+Shift+N.
If you’re in Single Page view, Publisher inserts one new, blank page and moves
you to that page. If you’re in Two-Page Spread view, Publisher inserts two new,
blank pages and moves your view to those pages.
Oops. If you insert a page accidentally, you can choose Edit➪Undo Insert
Page, press Ctrl+Z, or click the Undo button on the Standard toolbar to
remove it.
You aren’t limited to adding pages to the end of your publication. If you
choose Insert➪Page from the main menu, you can insert any number of
pages before or after the current page, or, if you’re in a two-page spread,
between the current pages. You can add blank pages, add pages with a single
text frame, or even duplicate the contents of a single page.
92
Part II: Mark This Page 

Follow these steps to insert a new page or pages into your publication:
1. Move to the page or spread that you want to immediately precede,
follow, or flank your new pages.
2. Choose Insert➪Page.
The Insert Page dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-15. This dialog
box is one of the most useful ones you encounter, and its options for
page creation can save you a lot of time.
Although Ctrl+Shift+N is listed on the Insert menu as a shortcut for the
Insert➪Page command, Ctrl+Shift+N does not open the Insert Page dialog
box. Instead, it immediately adds one blank page (if you’re in Single Page
view) or two blank pages (if you’re in Two-Page Spread view) after the
current page or spread — no questions asked. I object to listing key-
strokes that don’t exactly issue menu commands, and I think it should
be considered a bug. (It quacks like a bug!) The same behavior existed 
in previous versions of Microsoft Publisher, however.
3. In the Number of New Pages text box, type the number of pages you
want to insert.
The default is 1 for Single Page view and 2 for Two-Page Spread view.
Inserting pages in even numbers is a good idea so that left-hand pages
don’t become right-hand pages and vice versa. This rule of thumb isn’t
as important at the initial stages of a publication, but inserting pages in
odd numbers can wreak havoc if you insert them after having laid down
some objects.
Because booklet pages print in groups of 4, Publisher displays a dialog
box and prompts you to add additional pages so your booklet publica-
tion will print properly.
4. Click the radio button that indicates where you want the new page (or
pages) to be inserted.
Your choices are Before Left Page, After Right Page, and Between Pages.
Figure 4-15:
The Insert
Page dialog
box for a
two-page
spread.
93
Chapter 4: Working with Pages

5. In the Options area, click to indicate which kind of pages you want to
insert:
• Insert Blank Pages: Inserts pages that have no objects of their own,
just like the pages that are added when you insert pages by using
page controls.
• Create One Text Box on Each Page: Places a blank text box on each
new page you create. Each text box matches your publication’s
margin guides. This option is an excellent choice for publications
such as books, which have page after page of (primarily) text.
• Duplicate All Objects on Page: Makes a copy of whichever objects
already exist on the page number you specify in the text box and
places those objects on each of the new pages.
6. Click OK.
If you accidentally insert pages, you can remove them by immediately choos-
ing Edit➪Undo Insert Page from the main menu.
If you want to duplicate objects on your new pages, you have to place the
objects on the source page before you choose the Insert➪Page command.
Even though you may be tempted to use the Duplicate option (Insert➪
Duplicate Page from the main menu) to copy objects that you want on every
publication page, such as headers, footers, and page numbers, don’t do it.
Doing so creates larger file sizes. Use Master pages instead. With a Master
page, a single instance of an object serves all your printed pages. See the 
section “Creating Master Pages,” earlier in this chapter, for more details.
If you’re importing a great deal of text and you don’t know how many pages
you need to fit that text, you can have Publisher automatically add the neces-
sary number of pages for you, create text frames on those pages, and then 
fill those frames with the text. Chapter 6 tells you more about this labor-
saving feature.
Deleting pages
Deleting a page, especially from Single Page view, can be frighteningly easy —
and shouldn’t be taken lightly. When you delete a page, it’s as though the page
you deleted never existed. No mourning. No nothing. No kidding. (Have I
mentioned backups recently? Like in the last page or two?)
When you delete a page, all the objects on that page are also deleted. Only
objects off the page, on the scratch area, remain untouched. Publisher then
automatically renumbers the remaining pages so that you don’t end up with 
a wacky page sequence.
94
Part II: Mark This Page 

Follow these steps to delete a page:
1. Move to the page you want to delete.
2. Choose Edit➪Delete Page from the main menu.
Note that this command isn’t available if you’re viewing the Master page
of your publication.
3. Respond to the Publisher prompts asking you to confirm your deletion.
You have two main choices:
• In Single Page view: When you choose the Edit➪Delete Page com-
mand, Publisher displays a confirmation box asking whether you
really want to delete the page if the selected page contains any
objects. Click Yes to delete the page. Click No if you’re having
second thoughts. Use this command with caution. Press Ctrl+Z if
you accidentally delete a page. If the page you select for deletion is
blank, you receive no warning before the page is deleted.
• In Two-Page Spread view: Publisher opens the Delete Page dialog
box, as shown in Figure 4-16. Click the radio button for the option
you want: Both Pages, Left Page Only, or Right Page Only.
4. Click OK.
Deleting pages, even with an alert box, is dangerous. Pay particular attention
to page deletions, because they’re an excellent method for losing work.
As with inserting pages, you should delete pages in even numbers so that your
left- and right-hand pages don’t get fouled up. If you delete just a left- or right-
hand page in Two-Page Spread view, Publisher opens a dialog box asking you
to consider deleting pages in even numbers instead.
Try as you might, and as much fun as it might be to do it, you cannot delete the
only page in a single-page publication. If you try, Publisher simply deletes any
objects on that page and leaves the page itself in place. The Master page isn’t
affected when you try to delete the only page in a single-page publication.

Chapter 4: Working with Pages

Modifying the Page Layout
Every publication you create, no matter how basic, already has a specific
page layout that determines each page’s physical size and orientation and
whether the paper requires special folding to create the individual publica-
tion pages. But just because the page layout is determined the moment you
start a publication doesn’t mean that you can’t change it later by choosing
File➪Page Setup.
Do you get the feeling that there’s nothing that can’t change later in a publica-
tion? I don’t think there is, but changing things — including page layouts —
exacts an increasingly heavier toll as you go along. For example, if you lay
down all the text and graphics in a 16-page pamphlet and then change the size
of the pages, you may create plenty of extra work to do just to get the text and
graphics to fit properly again. Making the correct choices early in your project
saves you considerable time later on. The time you spend fixing up your publi-
cation is time you don’t spend doing the creative work that makes desktop
publishing fun.
Always select your target printer, as discussed in Chapter 12, before you
spend any time adjusting the page setup.
To change the page setup of a document, choose File➪Page Setup. The Page
Setup dialog box, shown in Figure 4-17, appears.
You use the options in the Page Setup dialog box to change the page size 
of your publication. If you can’t find a page size from the hundreds of 
choices available, you can even create your own page size.
When the Page Setup dialog box opens, it displays the current design template
superimposed on the various page sizes from all the publication types. Your
design will fit on some page sizes better than on others. For instance, if you
start with a three-panel brochure, you can see from the Page Setup dialog box
that the publication will fit better on B4 (Landscape) than it will on any of the
business card sizes.
In addition to changing the size of the paper for your publication, you 
can change the way the publication prints to your printer. Choose File➪
Print Setup to display the Print Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-18.
You can select these options:
 The printer model
 The paper size the printer will print on
96

 The correct paper bin for the selected paper size
 Portrait or Landscape orientation
The Preview box in the Print Setup dialog box shows how your selections
affect the printed job.

Designated drivers
Perhaps the most common design mistake that
desktop publishing beginners make is doing
page layout with the wrong printer driver. This
mistake iseasyenoughtomake,evenforexperi-
enced desktop publishers who are aware of the
problem. A change in printers, the service
you’re using, or the specifications for the publi-
cation itself can result in having to change
printer drivers. And, you may not have control
over those situations.
If you lay out pages by using the wrong printer
driver, many of the page setup options you take
for granted might not exist when you send your
file to be printed. After all your hard work of
carefully nudging objects around the page, you
might find that objects are cut off, blurry, or
otherwise poorly printed. If your publication is
being printed by a printer service, discussing
the printer driver before you initiate a design
project can save you time. See Chapter 13 for
more detailed information about printing your
publication.
Make sure that you’re designing your page for
the correct printer as early in the project as 
possible.

Objects and Frames
In This Chapter
 Understanding frames (what they are and why you need them)
 Working with frames
 Giving yourself proper credit
 Creating and working with drawn objects
 Creating special effects with layers
 Making sure that your graphics play nicely with your text
 Using groups to speed up your work
I
n the language of Microsoft Publisher 2007, an object represents any publi-
cation design element: a text or graphic frame, a line, a circle, or some
other item on a page. Objects fall into different categories, and each category
has a set of properties. After you know how one object in a category works,
you can understand the behaviors and properties of related objects in that
category. If you have a good set of objects, you can conquer the world.
Chapter 4 discusses the basic elements of your publication’s pages. It’s now
time to add structure to your pages with frames and drawn objects. In this
chapter, I focus on how you use frames and drawn objects to create a design
framework into which you can add the content that makes each publication
unique.
This chapter focuses on two types of objects: those contained in frames and
those that aren’t. Frames are container objects into which you place the con-
tent of your publication. Text and graphics are two common examples of 
publication elements that require frames. You can also use frames to create
tables and special text effects.
Not all objects on a layout use frames, however. Some objects — such as lines,
circles, rectangles, ovals, and other shapes that you draw by using the tools
in the Publisher toolbox — are complete, in, of, and by themselves. You find
out how to create these types of objects in this chapter.

Being Framed Is a Good Thing
As I mention in the introduction to this chapter, frames are container objects
that hold your publication’s content. Frames have properties that you can
change — they have a size and shape, they can be resized and moved, 
they can be transparent or opaque, and they can have color or patterns
applied to them, for example. (Basically, frames have all the properties 
you associate with drawn objects.) Frames exist as separate objects, but you
can associate frames as a group by using the equivalent of electronic glue.
Frames also have special properties that aren’t common to objects in general.
For example, text frames can be linked so that the contents of one frame flow
into the next frame. This feature is particularly valuable for text in a long doc-
ument, where you may want an article to begin on one page and continue on
another.
Publisher provides four frame types:
 Text: A text frame is a container for text. Text frames can be linked to
create Publisher stories. In Publisher-speak, a story consists of all the
text that’s contained in one frame — or that continues to another, linked
frame.
Some text frames are part of a Business Information Set, which contains
information about you or your organization. See the section “Adding In
Your Business Info,” later in this chapter, for details.
 Table: This frame type is a container for (surprise!) tables. It helps you
arrange text in tidy rows and columns. Table frames are useful for pre-
senting large amounts of data in a clear, easy-to-understand format.
 Picture: Picture frames have special properties that let you modify the
way graphics look in them.
 WordArt: WordArt creates graphical objects based on type — the char-
acters and symbols you make with your keyboard. By using WordArt,
you can create many special text effects that are useful in headlines and
other places. 
Each of the program’s four frame types behaves a little differently. In addition
to holding different sorts of objects, each type varies in how you create,
delete, and otherwise manipulate it.
Creating frames
To create a frame, you select the appropriate tool on the Objects toolbar and
click and drag with the tool on your layout. Figure 5-1 shows you where each
tool is located on the Object toolbar. The tool you select determines the
100
Part II: Mark This Page 

frame’s type, whereas your drawing action determines the frame’s size and
position in the publication.
After you create a frame, you might notice a slight change in your toolbars.
For example, if you click a text box, the Formatting toolbar appears under-
neath the Microsoft Publisher 2007 Standard toolbar, with buttons that let
you change the format of your frame or the objects you put in it. For the most
part, these formatting buttons are duplicates of menu commands. Plenty of
formatting tools are available for the various frame types, although different
commands appear for each specific frame type.
Follow these steps to draw a text box or picture frame:
1. Click the Text Box tool or Picture Frame tool on the Objects toolbar.
2. Choose one of these options:
• Picture Frame: You’re treated to a variety of choices. If you choose
Clip Art Picture from File or From Scanner or Camera, you need to
either navigate to the location of the stored file or select the piece
of clip art or graphic that you want to insert. At this point, your job
is done, and you can sit back, relax, and admire the artwork that
now appears in your project.
• Text Box or Picture Frame Using the Empty Picture Frame
option: The cursor changes to a crosshair. Move the crosshair over
the publication page or scratch area. The sliding ruler lines and the
status bar’s position box show your exact position. Click and drag
to create the outline of your frame.
As you drag, the program draws a sample to show you the size and
shape of your new frame. The status bar’s size box indicates the
frame’s size.

OLE! OLE!
Publisher makes good use of Object Linking and
Embedding, or OLE, a special form of cut-and-
paste technology that enables you to incorpo-
rate into your layout many kinds of data that the
program doesn’t directly support or can’t
directly create. A WordArt frame would be
better termed an OLE frame, after the kind of
object that fills that frame. Although Publisher
incorporates WordArt directly into its package,
you can create frames by pasting in designs
from any software application that supports
OLE.
You implement OLE by choosing Edit➪Paste
Special from the main menu. You can create
either embedded OLE objects or linked OLE
objects. When you create an embedded object,
the object is placed and stored (embedded)
directly in your publication file, as is the infor-
mation that enables Publisher to link back to the
program used to create the object. With a
linked object, the only information that’s stored
in your publication file is the data needed to link
back to the original OLE server program.
Whether you create linked or embedded OLE
objects, you make any changes to them in the
OLE server program rather than in Publisher.
You can specify that you want the changed
objects to be updated either automatically in
your layout or manually, on a case-by-case
basis. Also, you can choose to apply changes
made to embedded data to the copy of the
object that exists only in your publication.
You choose the Insert➪Object command to
select an OLE server program and create an
OLE frame. Publisher ships with a picture
browser for the Microsoft Clip Gallery. Select
the OLE server (such as Microsoft Excel Chart
or Microsoft Word Document) from the Object
Type list box to choose from any OLE server reg-
istered with Windows.
Although OLE is nice to use in other kinds of pro-
grams, it’s an essential part of working in a page
layout program, such as Publisher. If you under-
stand this feature, it can save you time, hard
drive space, maintenance, and grief. I revisit
OLE throughout this book.
3. Release the mouse button to create the frame.
Publisher creates your text or picture frame and selects it (makes it
active) so that you can work with it further.
Figure 5-2 shows you a selected text box. Picture frames and text boxes look
the same except that text boxes can have buttons used to link frames for
automatic content flow control.
To draw a table, the steps are pretty much the same as for creating a text or
picture frame. (Okay, you do have to pick the Insert Table tool.) Just don’t be
surprised, after you release the mouse button to create the frame, when
Publisher opens the Create Table dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-3.

You then need to follow these additional steps:
1. Select the number of rows and columns you want in your table.
2. (Optional) Choose a format for your table.
If you’re just dying to get a feel for what the table will look like, you can
get a sneak preview by taking a peek at the Sample window.
3. Click the OK button.
Your table frame is now complete. A sample table frame is shown in
Figure 5-4.

Table 
dialog box.

Chapter 5: Objects and Frames

So far, so good. Although all three frames (text, picture, and table) that I dis-
cuss in this part of the chapter behave similarly, it turns out that the WordArt
frame is somewhat different. When you draw a frame for that object type, the
WordArt Gallery opens.
1. Select the WordArt style that appeals to your discerning eye and then
click OK.
The Edit WordArt Text dialog window opens. It looks just like the one
you see in Figure 5-5.
2. Type the text of your Word Art and then click OK.
If you’re feeling extra creative, you can change the font and its attributes
(size or bold or italics) before clicking the OK button.
3. (Optional) Continue formatting your WordArt.
Because the WordArt graphic is still selected, you notice that the
WordArt toolbar appears directly on top of your WordArt. You can use
the toolbar to do lots of cool things to your WordArt; find out more
about WordArt in Chapter 9. If you’re not happy with the words in your
WordArt, double-click the frame; when you do, the WordArt text box
opens on your screen, and you can make changes.
Figure 5-4:
A sample

104
Part II: Mark This Page 

After you draw a frame, Publisher automatically deselects whichever frame
tool you might have been using and then activates the Select Objects tool so
that you can manipulate your object. This feature is a pain to use if you want
to draw several frames of the same type one right after the other. To make a
frame tool stay selected, double-click the tool icon. When you’re done draw-
ing frames with that tool, deselect the tool by clicking any tool in the toolbox.
This technique works for any tool in the toolbox (for example, the Line, Box,
and Circle tools), not just for frame tools.
Selecting frames and objects
Before you can change a frame or an object in Publisher, you have to select it.
After you select an element, you can fill it, resize it, move it, delete it, or do
whatever your heart desires. You can also select multiple frames or any set 
of objects on a page, thus enabling you to perform the same operation on a
set of frames or objects simultaneously — as long as the operation is legal 
for the selected elements.
For example, if you select two text boxes, Publisher lets you add borders to
both of them at the same time. If you try to paste text from the Clipboard into
two selected text boxes simultaneously, however, the program gets confused
and creates a third text box with your text.
A frame is automatically selected after you finish drawing it, as shown earlier,
in Figure 5-2. You can tell that a frame is selected because it displays eight
little circles, or selection handles, around its perimeter. Some selected frames
display more than just selection handles. For example, a text box may display
a Go to Previous Text Box button or a Go to Next Text Box button; you find
out how to connect text frames and work with tables in Chapter 6.
Figure 5-5:
The Edit

Text 
dialog box.
105
Chapter 5: Objects and Frames

If you revisit a frame after creating it, you have to select it again. In Publisher,
you use the Select Objects tool to select (or reselect) frames and objects. You
can use any of these selection techniques:
 To select a single frame: Just click it. The frame — along with its contents,
will be selected.
 To select additional frames: Hold down the Shift or Ctrl key and click
the frames.
 To deselect one frame from a range of selected objects: Hold down the
Shift or Ctrl key and click the frame.
 To select multiple frames that are close to one another: Click and drag
around the frames. As you drag, Publisher shows you a selection box —
a dotted line that indicates the area you’re encompassing. When the
selection box surrounds all the frames (or objects) you want to select,
release the mouse button.
 To select everything on the current publication page (or pages) and
the scratch area: Choose the Edit➪Select All command or press Ctrl+A.
(You don’t need to select the Select Objects tool to perform this task.)
These selection techniques work for all types of objects, not just frames.
Figure 5-6 shows you several frames and objects selected on a layout. The
selected objects are (clockwise from the upper-left corner) an AutoShape, a
text frame, a rectangle, another AutoShape, and a table frame. Notice that
although you find a single bounding box (the rectangle that encompasses 
the selected items) around them, each object still has its own set of selection
handles. (The rounded-arrow shape isn’t selected with this range of objects.)
You can tell that this multiple selection is ungrouped because each object
retains its own selection handles. In the ungrouped condition, the objects
and frames retain their individual identities. (Publisher handles the objects
as independent entities unless they’re grouped; you find out about grouping
later in this chapter.) Because a multiple selection isn’t a single object, you
cannot resize the selection or any individual component, but you can move
the selection around and apply other commands, such as formatting. For
example, if you apply a border to the multiple selection, each component of
the selection takes on that border format.
Sometimes when you click a frame (or an object), you can’t select or modify
it. If this happens, check out these possibilities:
 The frame or object may be a Master page object. To select a Master
page object, you first have to move to the Master page by choosing
View➪Master Page or pressing Ctrl+M.
106
Part II: Mark This Page 

 The frame or object is grouped. Figure 5-7 shows you the same set of
objects shown in Figure 5-6, but this time they’re grouped together. You
can click the Group Objects button to ungroup a group; look for more
information about groups later in this chapter.
Figure 5-7:
A selected,
grouped set

Figure 5-6:

107
Chapter 5: Objects and Frames

If you can’t find the Group Objects button, look for the two small, overlapping
boxes. Grouping works as a toggle: Click it the first time, and your selected
objects are grouped, and the icon becomes a bit darker; click the button a
second time to ungroup the objects — rendering the icon a bit lighter.
After you’re done working with a particular frame or set of frames, deselect
them so that you don’t accidentally delete or change them in some way.
Selected frames can be frighteningly easy to delete. Many programs offer a
Lock command to freeze objects, to prevent you from accidentally moving or
deleting them. But Publisher doesn’t have this handy feature, so you must be
especially careful.
To deselect frames, click in a blank area of the publication page or scratch
area. Or, click a single frame or object to deselect every other frame and
select just that one.
Editing frames
Because frames can contain objects, you can make two types of deletions:
 Delete the entire frame itself, which also deletes all its contents.
 Delete the contents of the frame by selecting the contents themselves.
To delete a frame, you select the frame and choose Edit➪Delete Object from
the main menu. You can also select the frame and press Delete. In the case of
a table frame, you have a container with many “drawers”; you can delete the
contents of each cell in the table by selecting the contents of that cell and
pressing Delete. When you have selected text in a text frame or an insertion
point in a cell of a table frame, you can press Ctrl+Shift+X to delete the frame.
Using only the Delete key in those cases deletes the selected text or the 
contents of the current cell in the table.
In the case of text or table frames, you may notice that the commands Delete
Text and Delete Object appear on the Edit menu. These Delete commands
bypass the Windows Clipboard and simply remove the object from your
layout. If you want to make use of the Windows Clipboard, you need to use
the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands, which are also on the Edit menu.
The Windows Clipboard is a piece of computer memory (RAM) that can store
text, formatted text, graphics, and other objects. It’s sort of a temporary
holding tank where you can keep data that you want to use again. You can
use the Clipboard to work with frames and the contents of frames within
Publisher. The operations that I outline in the following bulleted list work
with frames and, generally, with objects of other types. When you use the
108
Part II: Mark This Page 

Clipboard between Windows programs, you can transfer only the contents 
of the Clipboard that the receiving program understands. For example, you
can’t paste a Publisher frame into WordPad, but you can move formatted text
between the two programs.
The Edit menu’s Cut, Copy, and Paste commands work as described in 
this list:
 Cut: Choose Edit➪Cut or press Ctrl+X to place the current selection on
the Windows Clipboard and remove it from your layout. The previous
contents of the Clipboard are lost.
 Copy: Choose Edit➪Copy or press Ctrl+C to make a copy of your selected
element and place it on the Clipboard. The selection remains intact on
your layout. The previous contents of the Clipboard are lost.
To quickly copy a selected frame or the selected object, press Ctrl within
the frame and drag the frame to a new location. Copying is a great time-
saver and an ideal way to make exact duplicates of frames you’ve already
drawn.
 Paste: Choose Edit➪Paste or press Ctrl+V to place the contents of the
Clipboard on your layout at your current position. The previous contents
of the Clipboard remain intact. You can apply the Paste command any
number of times you want.
Pasted text is placed at the insertion point. If Publisher finds no inser-
tion point, it creates a text box in the center of your screen and places
the text in it. If a cut or copied text frame is on the Clipboard, the Paste
command puts the frame back on the page at the position from which 
it came.
If an object such as a line is on the Clipboard, Publisher pastes that object
at a position that’s offset slightly from the originally selected object. If you
move to a new page after you place an object on the Clipboard, the object,
when pasted, is placed on the new page at the same position in which it
appeared on the original page.
When you flush the contents of the Clipboard, by either replacing them
(with another Cut or Copy command) or restarting your computer, the
contents are gone and cannot be restored.
The Cut, Copy, and Paste commands also show up on the context-sensitive
(or shortcut) menu that appears when you right-click a frame or an object.
Figure 5-8 shows you this menu for a text box. You can select the entire con-
tents of a page or publication and cut and paste it to another page or publica-
tion. You can also drag and drop text, frames, and other objects between
publications if you have two Publisher publications open on your screen.
109
Chapter 5: Objects and Frames

You definitely should explore the right-click menus for every frame and
object that Publisher creates. They offer many editing and modification 
commands that provide useful shortcuts.
The Edit menu also offers another Paste command: Paste Special calls up
objects that must be managed by outside programs through Object Linking
and Embedding, or OLE. Earlier in this chapter, in the “OLE! OLE!” sidebar, 
I discuss one example of OLE. Publisher can be an OLE client and use the 
services of any OLE server program that is recognized by Windows for a 
particular object’s file type.
Filling frames
Frames are so important to creating publications that I devote entire chap-
ters in this book to them. Mourn the trees! Chapters 6 and 8 offer more infor-
mation about text boxes, and Chapter 6 discusses table frames as well.
Because WordArt frames create special text objects that are really graphics, I
discuss them in Chapter 8, which talks about type and where the lingo flies
fast and thick. Chapter 9 covers picture frames.
Moving and resizing frames
For one reason or another, frames don’t always end up in the right size or
shape or at the place where you want them to be. Nobody’s perfect.
To move a frame or an object, move your pointer over the border or the
shape itself until the pointer turns into a four-point arrow. Then click and
drag the frame or object to a new location.
You can constrain a move to either the vertical or horizontal direction by
holding down the Shift key.
Figure 5-8:

sensitive

110
Part II: Mark This Page 

As you drag, a dotted outline of the frame follows your pointer. When the 
outline is where you want your frame to be, release the mouse button.
If you want to move a frame or set of frames to a different page within your
publication, drag the frame or set completely off the publication page and
onto the scratch area. Then move to the destination page and drag the frame
or set from the scratch area to that page.
Perhaps you need to make a graphic bigger or create more room for your
text. Rather than delete the frame and any work you’ve done on it, use the
frame’s selection handles to resize the existing frame. As you move the
cursor over the selection handles, the mouse pointer becomes a double
arrow. After the double-arrow pointer appears, you can
 Click and drag a selection handle to resize a frame horizontally, verti-
cally or diagonally.
 Hold the Ctrl key and drag a selection handle to resize both horizontal
or both vertical edges at the same time.
 Click and drag a corner selection handle to resize a frame both horizon-
tally and vertically at the same time.
 Hold down the Shift key and drag a corner selection handle to resize a
frame along its diagonal and retain the relative proportions of its height
versus its width.
 Hold down the Ctrl key and drag a corner selection handle to force the
frame’s center to retain its position on the page.
 Hold down the Shift and Ctrl keys together as you drag a corner selec-
tion handle to maintain a frame’s proportion and resize it around its
center.
 Click and drag the green circle attached to the frame by a short line to
rotate the frame in either direction.
You resize and move objects in the same manner as you do frames, by using
the selection handles on each object’s bounding box.
Many page layout programs offer features that enable you to resize a frame to
a specific dimension or to reduce or enlarge a frame by a percentage. Publisher
is no exception. Select a text box and then choose Format➪Text Box from the
main menu. The Format Text Box dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Click the Size tab. Using the drop-down lists in the Size and Rotate area, enter
a new height and width for the selected text box. (If you want, you can even
specify an angle of rotation by using the Rotation drop-down list.) Click the
Layout tab of the Format Text box (which you can see later in this chapter, in
Figure 5-24) and enter the exact position in the Position on Page area. Specify
whether the Horizontal and Vertical options are measured from the upper-left
corner, center, or upper-right corner of the page.
111
Chapter 5: Objects and Frames

To specify the size and location of a picture, choose Format➪Picture from the
main menu to open the appropriate dialog box. For an AutoShape, choose
Format➪AutoShape. If you want to resize or change the location of a table —
yessirree — choose Format➪Table.
Entering a negative number in either the Horizontal or Vertical position box
places the left edge of the object in the scratch area.
The way that resizing a frame affects its contents depends on the frame’s type.
Resizing a picture or WordArt frame changes the size of the picture or WordArt
object within that frame. Resizing a text or table frame, however, merely
changes the amount of area available for the text within the frame; the text
itself doesn’t change size but, rather, rearranges itself to fit the new shape 
of its home. However, if the text box is formatted for Best Fit or Shrink Text
on Overflow, the size of your font changes if you change the frame size.
If you want even more control over resizing the frames in your publication,
display the Measurement toolbar by choosing View➪Toolbars➪
Measurement. The Measurement toolbar appears, as shown in Figure 5-10.
This toolbar isn’t particularly user friendly, as you can plainly see. The
Measurement toolbar is divided into nine rows. The first two rows control 
the horizontal and vertical position of the object — its x and y coordinates.
The second two rows control its width and height. The next row controls the
object’s rotation. The next two rows control text scaling (horizontally) and
tracking, or the general spacing between characters. The last rows control
kerning and line spacing. Kerning is the amount of space between pairs of
characters, whereas line spacing is, well, the space between lines. In addition
Figure 5-9:

tab of the
Format 
Text Box
dialog box.
112
Part II: Mark This Page 

to resizing frames, you can move a frame as easily as you can slide a brand-
new playing card across a freshly waxed table. Swoosh!
In the spirit of giving you more options than you can possibly use, Publisher
provides four ways to move frames and objects: dragging, nudging, lining up,
and the ubiquitous cutting-and-pasting (discussed earlier in this chapter). I
cover the first three options in more detail in later sections of this chapter,
after I dispose of the details of working with drawn objects. Each method for
moving frames and objects has its own advantages, depending on where you
want to move a frame and how adept you are with using the mouse.
Adding In Your Business Info
After you get the hang of working with frames, you can start to explore some
of the time-saving features that Publisher has up its sleeve. A case in point is
adding in all your contact information.
To relieve you from the tedium of entering information about yourself, your
business, or your organization every time you create a publication, Publisher
provides Business Information Sets. Every publication you create has a
Business Information Set associated with it, although you don’t see the 
information unless you (or a design template) insert it into the publication.
After you create a Business Information Set and associate it with your publi-
cation, you can decide exactly which tidbits of information — if any — you
want to appear in your publication. Publisher lets you create as many Business
Information Sets as you like. When you create a publication, Publisher uses
for the new publication whichever Business Information Set you used last.
Each Business Information Set contains eight components:
 Individual name
 Job position or title
 Organization name
 Address
Figure 5-10:
The
Measure-
ment toolbar.
113
Chapter 5: Objects and Frames

 Tagline or motto
 Phone and fax numbers and e-mail address
 Logo
 Business Information Set name
Switching Business Information Sets
To create a Business Information Set, choose Edit➪Business Information. The
Business Information dialog box, shown in Figure 5-11, leaps to the screen.
Select one of the Business Information Sets from the Select Business
Information Set drop-down list. If you haven’t previously ventured into 
this area, you’re treated to the Create New Business Information dialog 
box. You can enter new information into the selected Business Information
Set, change any existing information, and even give the set a snappy new
moniker, if you want. Click the Update Publication button to apply your
changes and close the Business Information dialog box.
If you made any changes to the components in the selected Business
Information Set, be sure to save your publication before switching to 
a different Business Information Set, or else you lose any changes.
Inserting Business Information Set components
Each component of the Business Information Set can be inserted into a publi-
cation. Choose Insert➪Business Information from the main menu to display
the Business Information task pane, as shown in Figure 5-12. As you pass
your mouse over any of the components, a rather large down arrow appears,
just to the right of the component. Click the down arrow next to the name 
of the component you want to insert, and select Insert This Field from the
drop-down list. The Business Information Set component is inserted into the
publication with little round selection handles around its perimeter. With the
exception of the Logo component, Business Information Set components look
and behave just like text frames.
Figure 5-11:
The
Business

dialog box.
114
Part II: Mark This Page 

You can distinguish a plain-old text frame from a Business Information Set
component by pointing at the box with the mouse. (Pointing with your finger
would just leave smudges on the screen.) A Business Information Set compo-
nent has a dotted blue underline, and a circle with the lowercase letter i (the
international symbol for information) appears above it. This little guy is a
Smart Tag button. Clicking the Smart Tag results in a menu that lists the
options to edit or update your Business Information set.
Changing Business Information Set components
Publisher makes changing business information in your publication easy.
Choose Edit➪Business Information to open the Business Information dialog
box. Select the Business Information Set you want to edit, and then click Edit
to open the Edit Business Information Set dialog box. Make changes to the
Business Information Set and click Save. As an added bonus, you can click
Update Publication in the Business Information dialog box, and your newly
improved info magically appears in the current publication. That’s all there 
is to it!
If that method isn’t easy enough for you, try this: Edit the Business Information
Set component text just as you would edit any text in a text box. Then click
the Business Information Smart Tag button and select Save to Business
Business Information task pane
Figure 5-12:

Information Set from the menu that appears. Presto, change-o — all instances
of your Business Information in your current publication then change.
If the Business Information Set component you want to change isn’t in the
publication, you have to insert it before you can change it.
Removing business information
You can remove business information in two ways:
 Delete a Business Information Set component from the current publi-
cation but leave the Business Information Set unchanged. Click the
component you want to remove and press Ctrl+Shift+X. Poof! The com-
ponent is gone — but the Business Information is still available for your
future endeavors.
If you change your mind, just press Ctrl+Z to undo the deletion, or choose
Insert➪Business Information, click the down arrow next to the compo-
nent name, and select Insert This Field to reinsert it into the publication.
 Clear the information from the Business Information Set. Choose
Edit➪Business Information to open the Business Information dialog box,
select the Business Information Set from which you want to delete infor-
mation, and click the Edit button.
When you finish deleting, click Save and then click the Update
Publication button. The components you deleted from the Business
Information Set are also removed from your publication.
Drawing Isn’t Just for Preschoolers
Most Publisher users typically start out by creating frames. As I mention ear-
lier in this chapter, frames are an excellent way to get an idea of what your
final layout will look like. Sometimes, however, it becomes a question of which
comes first — the frame or the object inside the frame. If you’ve ever used a
drawing program, you’re probably familiar with basic drawing elements such
as ovals, lines, and rectangles. Publisher is nothing more than a fancy draw-
ing program. (Okay, it is more than just a fancy drawing program, but work
with me here, will ya?)
Earlier sections in this chapter explain how to create frames and then resize
them, move them, and delete them. Now comes the fun part — you can either
create a frame and plunk a drawing inside the frame, or you can create your
drawing without the benefit of a frame.
The drawing tools are located on the bottom half of the Objects toolbar; you
can see them labeled in Figure 5-13:
116
Part II: Mark This Page 

 Line tool: Creates lines on your layout. Click and drag a line from a start-
ing point (where you click and begin dragging) to an ending point (where
you release the mouse button).
 Arrow: Looks and feels pretty much like a line except it has a pointy
head on it!
 Oval tool: Creates an oval. If you want to create a perfect circle, press
the Shift key while you click and drag.
 Rectangle tool: Create a rectangle. Press the Shift key while you click
and drag to create a square.
In the language of object-oriented, or vector, programs (which is what
techies like to call drawing programs when they don’t want normal
people to understand what they’re saying), a basic shape is called a
primitive. Lines, circles, and squares are primitives. More complex
shapes (such as the custom shapes) that can be broken apart into unre-
lated line segments or that are a grouped set of shapes (such as those
you see in the Design Gallery) are shapes you can create for yourself in
Publisher. The AutoShapes and Design Gallery libraries exist to make
your task in Publisher easier.
 AutoShapes tool: Creates more complex shapes. I’m fond of this special
tool because it lets you easily create interesting shapes that you can 
use for captions, callouts, product bursts, and many other purposes.
Figure 5-14 shows you the Basic Shapes pop-up menu for the AutoShapes
Tool. Click to select the shape that you want from the menu and then
drag to create your object on the layout.

 Bookmark: With so many goodies to choose from, you might find that

Understanding object properties
Objects have some basic properties that you probably already know about.
This is head-banging stuff, but it lets me introduce some terms that are useful
in discussions to come. If the italicized words in this section are familiar to
you, you’re not a pilgrim, and you should mosey on.
Size and shape
The first thing you notice about an object is that it has a shape. (Strangely,
most people tend to notice that!) A shape is the actual defined area of the
object and is indicated in Publisher by its border. When you select a shape,
the shape is surrounded by the smallest rectangle that will encompass that
object — its bounding box. Figure 5-16 shows you a shape with its bounding
box. The bounding box has the properties of a frame, and when the encom-
passed shape has right angles (like a rectangle), the shape’s bounding box
and border coincide.
Use the selection handles on the bounding box to resize a shape or an object.
When a shape is irregular, you can see the bounding box and the border sepa-
rately. If you look closely at Figure 5-16, you notice that the lower-left vertex
of the trapezoid (the shape) displays a yellow, diamond-shaped handle. That
handle lets you reshape the trapezoid by changing its defining angle.
Borders, colors, and fills
Even if no border is applied to a shape, Publisher draws a dotted line so that
you can see the shape and work with it. If you don’t like this dotted line, you
can apply a border (technically called a stroke), to the shape. Publisher lets
you define a border thickness between 0 and 22 inches. (Only the author of
this book likes to work with invisible shapes and writes and talks to invisible
people.)
To apply a border to a shape, click the shape and then choose Format➪
AutoShape from the main menu. Astute reader that you are, you might be
wondering why you’re not finding options like Oval and Rectangle on the
Figure 5-16:
An object
and its
bounding
box.

Chapter 5: Objects and Frames

Format menu. Publisher simplified things a bit by adding the “one shape fits
all” AutoShape item to the menu. Regardless, the Format AutoShape dialog
box opens, as shown in Figure 5-17.
You can apply a weight to a shape’s line or stroke. Weight is a term used by
typographical folk to describe the thickness of a line. Usually, line weight is
measured in points, which is a common unit of measurement used in publish-
ing. Publisher gives you the option to define the thickness of a border in
inches, centimeters, picas, points, or pixels.
You can also apply a color and even a pattern to a border stroke. Or, described
another way, a stroke can have a fill and a fill effect. Using the term fill in this
way can be confusing, though, because it’s more commonly used to refer 
to the interior of a shape — the part surrounded by the stroke. Like a stroke,
the interior of an object can have a color and a pattern applied to it.
Publisher lets you apply BorderArt to further beautify the borders of your
frames and boxes. I tell you more about BorderArt in Chapter 9. Other, more
capable programs give you finer control and let you apply to a stroke any
attribute that you can apply to an object’s fill.
In addition to having fills and fill effects, lines can have arrowheads, in case
you’re not happy with the basic arrow tool. You open the Line dialog box by
choosing Format➪AutoShape or by clicking the Line/Border Style button on
the Formatting toolbar and choosing More Lines from the pop-up menu. This
dialog box lets you assign arrowheads, line color, and line widths to a
selected line.

The Format
AutoShape
dialog box.

Color is a broad subject and a very technical one for desktop publishers. I
tackle it in detail in Chapter 10. For now, just think of it as a basic property 
of an object.
To apply a color to the fill of a selected shape, you need to go to the Fill sec-
tion of the Format AutoShape dialog box. You can do this in two ways:
 Click the down arrow on the Fill Color button on the Formatting tool-
bar. On the pop-up selection menu, shown in Figure 5-18, display the
Colors dialog box by clicking the More Fill Colors option.
 Choose Format➪AutoShape from the main menu. In the Format
AutoShape dialog box that opens, on the Colors and Lines tab, select
More Colors from the Fill Color drop-down list. The much larger 
and more capable Colors dialog box, shown in Figure 5-19, appears.
To apply a pattern, shading, or gradient to the selected object’s fill, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Fill Color button on the Formatting toolbar to reveal the 
pop-up selection menu. (Refer to Figure 5-18.)
Figure 5-19:
The Colors
dialog box.
Figure 5-18:
The Fill
Color menu.
121
Chapter 5: Objects and Frames

2. From this pop-up menu, open the Fill Effects dialog box by clicking
the Fill Effects button.
3. In the Fill Effects dialog box, click the tab for the fill style you want 
to use.
Figure 5-20 shows the options available when you select the Gradient
tab.
4. Make your selections and then click OK.
In the vocabulary of color, a tint or shade is a mix of a color with white.
Patterns use a base color for the lines or dots and a background color — 
normally black and white, respectively. Gradients are effects in which the
color is varied in some manner and in a specific direction (for example, from
dark to light and outward from the center of the object). The effects you can
produce with gradients are cool!
Cool-looking gradients can use a lot of computer memory and create chal-
lenges for your printer. Make sure that the printer you select can handle
these large files. See Chapter 13 for more about printing.
Object transparency
Objects also have the property of being transparent (see-through) or opaque
(not see-through). Many fancy drawing and page layout programs let you
control the degree of transparency of an object and even the type of color
that shows through. Publisher lets you assign transparency to an object by
using a percentage of from 0 to 100. A clear object lets other objects beneath
it show through; for most desktop publishing purposes, this option is suffi-
cient. Set the transparency on the Gradient tab of the Fill Effects dialog box.
Figure 5-20:
The Fill
Effects
dialog box.
122
Part II: Mark This Page 

To make an opaque object or frame completely transparent, press Ctrl+T.
Press the keystroke again to make a transparent object or frame opaque — 
a technique that works less often because not all object types support it.
Relative positions
Another property that objects have in a layout is their position with respect
to one another. When you create an object, it’s placed on top of all other
objects created before it and in strict order, from back to front. You can change
this automatic order, often referred to as the layering order or stacking order,
by using a set of commands that I cover later in this chapter. You use these
commands to send objects backward or forward in the stacking order. 
You can also align objects with each other and create groups of objects that
behave like a single object. I talk about alignment and grouping later in this
chapter, too.
Using the Format Painter
When you set an object’s properties “just so,” you usually want to lock the
object and prevent it from being changed. This important command is, unfor-
tunately, missing in Publisher 2007, which makes it imperative that you delete
objects carefully. The program offers the Format Painter, however — a “just
so” command that lets you apply the same set of formatting from one object
to another object. The two objects don’t even have to be the same kind of
object.
You can copy an object’s format by selecting the object whose format you
want to copy. Then click the Format Painter button on the Standard toolbar;
the button looks like a paintbrush. Finally, click the object you want to
format.
If you want the Format Painter’s brush to stay “loaded” with your format until
you change it, double-click the Format Painter button. Now you can click as
many objects as you want, and the same formatting is applied to all of them.
Click another toolbar tool or click a blank area of the workspace to turn off
the Format Painter.
Aligning and positioning objects
The most natural method for moving an object or frame is to drag it. Dragging
an object is the electronic equivalent of using your finger to slide a playing
card across a table. In Chapter 4, I explain some of the tools used for pre-
cisely positioning objects and frames on a layout when you’re dragging them
into position: position measurements in the status bar, ruler marks, layout
and grid guides, and ruler guides.
123
Chapter 5: Objects and Frames

Ruler marks and guides work with Snap To commands, also covered in
Chapter 4, to help you position objects precisely. When you place an 
object’s border or center axis (either horizontal or vertical) close to a 
ruler mark or guide, it snaps into alignment with the mark or guide.
Three additional sets of commands, found on the Arrange menu, are used for
precise positioning or alignment:
 Align or Distribute: This command opens the submenu shown in 
Figure 5-21. Selected objects are aligned horizontally using the Align 
Left, Align Center, and Align Right menu options. Align your objects 
vertically by using the Align Top, Align Middle, and Align Bottom menu
items. You can set either or both of these alignment (horizontal or verti-
cal) options.
You can also align objects to the page margin. To have alignment take
effect, select the Relative to Margin Guides option, select the object that
you want to align and then choose the left or right align button. You can
also use the Distribute Horizontally or Vertically options to evenly
arrange the objects on the page.
 Nudge: Choose Arrange➪Nudge to access the Nudge feature. Nudges, for
those of you not in the know (nudge, nudge, wink, wink), are small move-
ments of an object in one direction.
Most programs give you a nudge. Some programs give you a swift kick in
the pants. Publisher gives you a submenu. The traditional way to imple-
ment nudges is to select an object and press the arrow keys. Each time
you press an arrow key, your object moves slightly in that direction.
Earlier versions of Publisher required you to hold down the Alt key and
press the arrow keys to perform this action. Now you can simply select
the object you want to nudge and press the up, down, left, or right arrow
keys.
You can specify the distance that an object moves each time it’s nudged,
by changing the Arrow Keys Nudge Object By setting on the Edit tab of
the Options dialog box. (Choose Tools➪Options from the main menu to
open the Options dialog box.)
 Rotate or Flip: Publisher offers five commands on the Arrange➪Rotate
or Flip submenu for rotating and flipping selected objects: Free Rotate,
Rotate Left 90°, Rotate Right 90°, Flip Horizontal, and Flip Vertical.
The Free Rotate command is interesting. You can place your mouse on
Free Rotate handle, which looks like a green dot connected to the object
by a short line and drag the object to whatever degree of angle you want.
The second and third commands rotate objects 90 degrees counterclock-
wise and clockwise with each application; the last two commands reflect
your selection through a horizontal and vertical mirror plane.
124
Part II: Mark This Page 

Building layers on top of your layers
The position that an object has on a page is uniquely defined by its layer. In the
natural creation order, the first object created is at the back, and the last object
created is at the front. It’s like football players diving for a fumbled ball: Who-
ever gets there first ends up on the bottom. Fortunately for your publication,
frames don’t suffer from broken bones and torn ligaments. Both the Master
and foreground pages have separate layer orders, and they can’t be mixed.
Grouped objects are considered to be in the same layer — until they’re
ungrouped. Then they return to their natural relative order, one ungrouped
object to another. You can defeat the natural layering by using a set of com-
mands on the Arrange menu. Layers have some important implications.
Opaque objects obscure any objects behind them. Text boxes, table frames
picture and WordArt frames are transparent by default.
No matter which order you use originally to layer objects, however, you can
rearrange these layers any way you want by using the four layering commands
on the Arrange➪Order submenu:
 Bring to Front: Choose Arrange➪Order➪Bring to Front, or press Alt+F6
to bring selected objects to the top layer.
 Send to Back: Choose Arrange➪Order➪Send to Back, or press
Alt+Shift+F6 to send selected frames to the bottom layer.
 Bring Forward: Choose Arrange➪Order➪Bring Forward to bring
selected frames up one layer.
 Send Backward: Choose Arrange➪Order➪Send Backward to send
selected frames down one layer.
Figure 5-21:
The Align or
Distribute
submenu.
125
Chapter 5: Objects and Frames

No matter how far down you send a frame or other object on a foreground
page, it always remains on top of any Master page object. And, no matter how
far up you bring a frame or other object on a Master page, it always remains
below any foreground object.
Layering, or adjusting the layers and transparency of objects so that other
objects either show through or are hidden, is one of the most important
design techniques you can apply to your publications. By using this tech-
nique, you can place text in front of a picture so that it appears to be part of
the picture, apply fills and patterns that the object doesn’t support by itself,
wrap text around a graphic (another layering technique discussed later), and
more. Figure 5-22 shows you an example of a layered starburst with a trans-
parent text frame on top.
Wrapping Text around Objects
Take a look at Figure 5-23, which shows you one of the most important types
of layering — text wrapping. This special layer effect is created with intelli-
gent frame margins. Notice how the text makes room for the graphic and
neatly wraps around it. (Is the text just well behaved, or did the graphic
forget to put on its deodorant this morning?)
Creating regular text wraps
In the bad old days of traditional publishing, wrapping text required pain-
staking hours of cutting, pasting, and rearranging individual lines of text. 
And pity the poor fool who suggested making a change to the text after the
wrapping was complete!
In Publisher, though, wrapping text is amazingly easy. Just place any type of
frame — even another text box — on top of a text box, and the text under-
neath automatically wraps around the frame above it.
Text doesn’t wrap if one frame is on a foreground page and the other is on
the Master page; both frames have to be on the same page, so to speak.
Although the program tries its best, it can sometimes wrap text too closely or
too loosely around a frame. (My wife has had occasion to declare that I am
not wrapped too tight.) Closely wrapped text can be difficult to read, whereas
loosely wrapped text can waste space and create big gaps on the page. With
all frames except table frames, you can easily change the amount of space
between the wrapping text and the box it wraps around by changing the mar-
gins of the wrapped-around frame.

Chapter 5: Objects and Frames

To increase the margins of a text box, click the text box and then choose
Format➪Text Box from the main menu. Make your selections from the Layout
tab of the Format Text Box dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-24. Turn off text
wrap by selecting None in the Wrapping Style area of the Layout tab. The
measurements in the Distance from Text area change the amount of space
between the text in a text box and the border of the text box.
To change the properties of a picture or WordArt frame, follow these steps:
1. Select a picture and then choose Format➪Object from the main menu.
If you’re formatting WordArt, you choose Format➪WordArt. If you’re a
right-clicker, you can also right-click the picture or WordArt and choose
Format Object or Format WordArt from the contextual menu.
2. Make your selections from the Layout tab of the Format Object or
WordArt dialog box.
It looks amazingly similar to the Layout tab of the Format Text Box
dialog box.
3. Adjust the way text wraps around a graphic or WordArt so that the
text wraps around the entire picture frame or just the graphic con-
tained therein.
See the example in the Wrapping Style section of the Format dialog box.
By default, Publisher wraps text in a rectangular pattern around the perime-
ter of a frame. (Refer to Figure 5-23.) If you’re working with a picture frame,
however, you can have your text wrap to the actual shape of the graphic
within that frame by the Tight option in the Wrapping Style section of the
Format dialog box. Figure 5-25 shows you an example. Very cool!
Fine-tuning text wraps
Picky, picky, picky. Some folks like their text wrapped around their graphics
“just so” — it’s very important to them. Depending on the justification you
use in your text, Publisher can do a poor job of wrapping text around a
graphic to match its shape, particularly when you use justified text. The pro-
gram wraps text around most of its own clip art because the text boundaries
are built in already. But Publisher can become mighty confused about the
shapes of “foreign” graphics and can be especially pitiful when it comes to
creating text boundaries for WordArt objects.
A couple of tools offer some help in this area. The first tool lets you create and
adjust an irregular boundary on your graphic to control how text wraps around
it. To create this kind of effect, select the graphic and then choose Arrange➪
Text Wrapping➪Edit Wrap Points from the main menu. Doing so adds reshape
handles for wrapping text to your graphic. Click and drag these handles
128
Part II: Mark This Page 

where you want them. You can also add a handle by holding down the Ctrl
key and clicking the point on the outline of the graphic where you want to
add a reshape handle. To remove a reshape handle, press Ctrl+Shift while
clicking the offending handle.

Chapter 5: Objects and Frames

Figure 5-26 shows you what Wrap Point handles look like “in the flesh.” The
topic “Fine-tune how text wraps around a picture” in the Publisher online
Help system gives you more information.
Grouping Objects
Some things in “the real world” just seem to go together: peanut butter and
jelly, macaroni and cheese, death and taxes. In your publications, too, some
things might belong together: several drawn objects that comprise a logo; a
graphic and its caption; a table frame and the picture frame you stuck behind
it to make text wrap the way you want.
When you want different objects on your layout to stay together and behave
as a unit, you can apply some electronic glue to stick them together in a
group. There, they can share their most personal problems: “Hi, my name is
Igor. I’m a picture frame trapped in a table frame’s body.”
Grouping tells Publisher to treat the collection of objects as a single object.
Thus, you can easily move or copy a group while keeping the objects in the
same positions relative to each other. You don’t have to worry about acciden-
tally leaving behind one line, box, or frame. You can also resize a group while
maintaining the same relative size and position of the frames within that group.
Trust me: This method is a heck of a lot easier than resizing and adjusting the
position of each object in a group individually and getting the same results.
To group two or more objects, use one of these methods:
 Select the objects that you want to include in your group by holding
down the Shift or Ctrl key while clicking each object, and click the 
Group Objects button, which appears in the lower-right corner of the
selection’s bounding box. The button changes to resemble locked 
puzzle pieces. You can even group groups.
 Select the objects and then choose Arrange➪Group.
 Select the objects and then press Ctrl+Shift+G.
To ungroup a group of objects, choose one of these methods:
 Select the group and click the Group Objects button again. You have to
click outside the grouping for your change to take effect.
 Select the group and choose Arrange➪Ungroup from the main menu.
 Select the group and then press Ctrl+Shift+G.
130
Part II: Mark This Page 

What you can do to an object in a group depends on that object’s capability.
Earlier in this chapter, you see how you can apply borders to several shapes
at a time in a group. You can also resize a group; if you do, each object resizes
proportionally. You can type text in a text or table frame that’s part of a
group; just click the frame and start typing.
It’s possible to modify a single object in a group without ungrouping it 
from the rest of the group. For example, to change the properties of one of
the objects in a group, simply double-click the object’s border; in a jiffy, the
Properties dialog box opens. Alternatively, you can right-click the object, and
again the Properties dialog window comes to life.

 Forming, reforming, and deforming stories

 Inserting Continued notices
 Working with table frames
I
n this chapter, I help you look closely at two frame types: text boxes and
table frames. You use text boxes to place and manage text in your publica-
tion. Microsoft Publisher 2007 has some special features to help you manage
text frames across pages: the capacity to make text flow automatically between
linked frames, and stories, which are just blocks of text managed as a single
entity. You can even place Continued notices (Continued on Page and
Continued from Page) in your publication to help readers follow a story 
that begins on one page and continues on another.
In addition to providing regular text boxes, Publisher 2007 has two other types
of frames for holding text: table frames and WordArt frames. If you’ve worked
in a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, or used a word processor
that offers a table feature, such as Microsoft Word, the table frames features
in Publisher 2007 should look familiar to you. If not, you can find out what
you need to know about table frames at the end of this chapter. You can also
create a shape, select it, and start typing. Like magic, your text then appears
in the shape.
WordArt frames enable you to create fancy text by using WordArt to manipu-
late type. I cover WordArt in Chapter 9 because this type of frame is more
commonly used for short pieces of decorative text, rather than for the longer
text that comprises most people’s publications.

Getting Into the Details of Text Boxes
If you’re accustomed to creating text in other computer programs, you may
find it odd that you can’t just begin typing right away in a Publisher publica-
tion. You must first create a text box to tell the program where to put your
text. Not that this is in any way a big deal — Chapter 5 shows you how easy
creating a text box is: You simply click the Text tool in the toolbox and then
click and drag to create the text box.
After you create a text box, you can fill it in one of three ways:
 Type text directly into the text box.
 Paste text from the Clipboard.
 Import text from your word processor or text file.
The next few sections give you a bit more detail on each technique.
Typing text
Publisher offers a complete environment for creating page layouts, so you
soon discover that you can write your text in text boxes with little trouble.
Admittedly, Publisher isn’t the most capable text creation tool, and it doesn’t
have all the bells and whistles you would expect to find in your word proces-
sor, but it has been updated to integrate more closely with the Microsoft
Office suite of applications. The idea is to let you leverage skills acquired
from other Microsoft programs, such as Microsoft Word.
If you acquired your copy of Publisher as a part of one of the Microsoft Office
2007 suites, you may notice big changes in the way most of the Microsoft
Office 2007 applications look and function. Microsoft replaced the menus and
toolbars in some (but not all) of the programs with the Ribbon, which is part
of what Microsoft has now named the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface.
The idea was to group the tools you use the most in an easily accessible place
(the Ribbon). If you have experience in using any of the previous versions 
of Microsoft Office, I have some good news: Many text editing features in
Publisher 2007 will look familiar to you:
 Menus and toolbars: You may recognize the File, Edit, View, Insert,
Format, Tools, and Help menus on the menu bar. Also, the New, Open,
Save, Print, Cut, Copy, Paste, Format Painter, Undo, Redo, Show/Hide ¶,
and Microsoft Publisher Help (it’s Microsoft Word Help in Word) buttons
from, say, Word 2003 should all seem familiar.
136
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

 AutoCorrect: This feature lets you automatically fix some common errors,
such as correcting two initial capitals or automatically capitalizing the
names of days.
 Spell Check: This feature automatically checks spelling as you type; it
flags any misspelled or repeated words by underlining them.
If you’re used to typing on a typewriter or in a word processor, you may be
used to doing some things that you shouldn’t do in Publisher — or in any
page layout program — when you enter text.
Here’s a list of things not to do when you’re entering text:
 Don’t press Enter to force a line ending. Pressing Enter tells the program
that you’ve reached the end of a paragraph. If you press Enter at the end
of every line, you cannot format the lines of your paragraph as a unit,
which can be a bad thing. When you get to the end of a line of text, let
Publisher word-wrap the text to the next line for you (which it does
automatically). Press Enter only to end a paragraph or a short, indepen-
dent line of text (such as a line in an address).
Note: If you need to force a line break without creating a new paragraph,
press Shift+Enter. This keystroke creates a soft carriage return (;) 
and places the symbol at the end of the line.
 Don’t press Enter to create blank lines between paragraphs. Publisher
2007 has a much better way to create spaces before and after paragraphs:
Choose Format➪Paragraph from the main menu and then adjust the
Line Spacing settings in the Paragraph dialog box that appears.
 Don’t insert two spaces between sentences. Use just one. It makes your
text easier to read.
 Don’t press the Tab key or spacebar to indent the first lines of para-
graphs. Instead, use the paragraph indent controls, explained in 
Chapter 7. These controls offer much more flexibility than tabs.
 Don’t try to edit or format your text as you go. It’s much more efficient
to complete all your typing first, your editing second, and your formatting
last.
In addition to all these don’ts, I want to add a definite do: Do turn on the Show
Special Characters command. Special characters are symbols that represent
elements such as spaces, tabs, and line endings. These symbols help you figure
out why your text appears the way it does. To turn on this feature, choose
View➪Special Characters or press Ctrl+Shift+Y. Better yet, click the Show
Special Characters button (the one that looks like a backward P) on the
Standard toolbar. Figure 6-1 shows a text block with special characters
turned on.
137
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

If any of the suggestions in this section seem new to you, I recommend that
you check out one of the typographical style books mentioned near the end of
Chapter 2, in the section about desktop style resources. I’m especially fond 
of The PC Is Not a Typewriter, by Robin Williams (Peachpit Press). If you’re
working in a specific word processing program, you may also want to pick 
up the For Dummies book on that program.
As you type, your text begins filling the text box from left to right and from top
to bottom. If the text box isn’t large enough to accommodate all your text, you
eventually reach the bottom of the text box. When you type more text than
can fit into a text box, the extra text moves into the invisible overflow area.
You can type blindly in that overflow area; the program keeps track of every-
thing you type. If you’re like most people, though, you probably want to see
what you’re typing as you type it.
The Text in Overflow indicator alerts you when you type more text than can
fit into the current text box. The indicator is located in the lower-right corner
of the text box. (Figure 6-2 shows you a text box with the Text in Overflow
indicator doing its thing.) If you see the indicator at the bottom of a text
frame, you know that the text box isn’t large enough to contain the text.
“Good enough,” you might say, but what can you do to be able to see what
you type again? You have several options, although the most straightforward
method is to simply enlarge the text box by clicking the text box to select it,
placing your mouse pointer on one of the round selection handles, and drag-
ging the cursor to enlarge the text box. (If you’re still confused, Chapter 5
explains this process in even more detail.) With a larger text box, the text in
the overflow area has room to spread out (and automatically appears). You
can also use the Create Text Box Link button to link text boxes for autoflow-
ing, as described later in this chapter, in the section “Autoflowing text.”
The first thing you may notice about text in a text box is that, in most views
that provide an overview of your publication, the text is much too small to
read. Do yourself a favor and press F9 to zoom in to view your text as you
type it into your text frame. Pressing F9 toggles the view between the current
magnification and 100 percent magnification.

Pasting text from the Clipboard
You can paste text into a Publisher publication by using the Windows
Clipboard. Here’s how to do it:
1. In Publisher, select the Text Box tool on the Objects toolbar and draw
a text box on the page (if you don’t have a text box created).
2. Highlight the text in the program containing the text that you want 
to use.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy or press Ctrl+C.
4. In your Publisher publication, click the Select Objects tool on the
Objects toolbar, and click in a text box to set the insertion point at 
the position where you want your text to be pasted.
Feel free to flip over to Chapter 5 to find out how to create text boxes.
5. Choose Edit➪Paste or press Ctrl+V.
If you didn’t set an insertion point in Step 4 or didn’t have a text box
selected, Publisher creates a new text box and imports the copied text
into that text box. In most cases, the text box that Publisher creates isn’t
the size and shape you want, and it isn’t in the place you want it to be.
Save yourself some time by creating the text box before you paste.
If you can copy formatted text successfully to the Windows Clipboard, the text
should be pasted correctly into your text box. For more information about
using the Windows Clipboard, see Chapter 5.
If the text on the Clipboard can’t fit in the text box you selected, the program
performs an autoflow operation. First, it displays a dialog box informing you
that the inserted text doesn’t fit into the selected text box and asks whether
you want to use autoflow. I talk about autoflow in more depth later in this
chapter, in the section “Autoflowing text.”

Chapter 6: Getting the Word

Importing text
As an alternative to using the Windows Clipboard to import text into a text
box, you can choose Insert➪Text File to move text between your word
processor and Publisher. (The process is rather more complicated than my
description here lets on — the text does a bit of a two-step, in that it first gets
converted to an intervening text file and is then brought into Publisher.)
If you haven’t typed your document in Microsoft Word yet, save yourself a
few steps and use Word to type and edit your text inside Publisher. I explain
this particular bit of magic a little later in this chapter, in the section “Using
Word to edit your text.”
Before you choose Insert➪Text File, you must save your text to a file by using
a format that Publisher can read. Fortunately, Publisher accepts many differ-
ent file formats, including the ones in this list:
 All Publisher files (No surprise here!)
 Plain text (ASCII) or plain formatted text (RTF)
Although most programs should at least be able to save text as plain, or
ASCII, text, ASCII should be your last resort because ASCII text uses no
formatting. If you save a text file in ASCII format, the file loses all format-
ting (such as bold, italic, or underlining). Try to avoid this option.
 Single File Web Page (*.htm, *.html)
 Rich Text Format, or RTF: In RTF (the Microsoft text-based, formatted
text interchange format), ASCII characters are saved in your file, along
with special commands to indicate formatting information — such as
bold, italic, or underlining. You don’t need to concern yourself with
these formatting commands; you need to know only that the RTF text
format saves formatting on text.
 Microsoft Word 2007 (and other versions for Windows or the Macintosh)
 Recover Text from Any File
 WordPerfect 5.x and 6.x
 Microsoft Works
If your word processor doesn’t save to one of these file formats automatically,
check to see whether it offers an Export command, which can translate your
word processor file into a form that Publisher understands.
Okay, you save whatever you want to import into your Publisher publication
to a file using an acceptable format. Now what? To import the text file into
Publisher, follow these steps:
140
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

1. Locate the text box into which you want to import the text, and then
position the insertion point inside the box where you want the text to
appear.
2. Choose Insert➪Text File.
The Insert Text dialog box, shown in Figure 6-3, appears.
3. Locate the file you want, highlight it, and then click OK.
After a moment, the text appears in the selected text box.
Here are some tips for using the Insert Text dialog box:
 If you can’t find your text file, make sure that you selected the correct
import filter from the Files of Type drop-down list.
 To see all files in a folder, select All Text Formats in the Files of Type
drop-down list.
 If the file still doesn’t appear, you’re looking in the wrong place. Use 
the Look In drop-down list, at the top of the dialog box, to switch to
another location.
 If not all the imported text can fit in the selected text box, the program
opens a dialog box asking whether you want to autoflow the rest of 
your text into other text boxes. (I present more information on autoflow-
ing text later in this chapter, in the section “Autoflowing text.”)
You can view the contents of a text file without importing the file into your
publication. Choose File➪Open (or press Ctrl+O) to access the Open dialog
box, click the down arrow next to the Files of Type text box, and select All
Text Formats. Find the file you want and click Open. Publisher opens the text
Figure 6-3:
The Insert

box displays

Chapter 6: Getting the Word

or word processor file as a full-page publication that offers the requisite
number of pages filled with full-page text boxes. Keep in mind that, depend-
ing on your computer and the size of the document you’re opening, this
process can take a while to complete.
As an alternative to using the menu commands, you can display context-
sensitive menus (see Figure 6-4) by right-clicking a text box. On the context
menu, select Change Text and then select Text File. The Insert Text dialog box
opens. You may find that using the context-sensitive menu for the Insert Text
task is easier than moving the mouse cursor to the top of the screen. (To me,
it’s six of one and half a dozen of the other.)
Exporting text
Hey, here’s something you already know how to do! Just as easily as you can
transfer text that’s created elsewhere into Publisher, you can also send text
out of the program so that other computer programs can use the text. (Isn’t it
nice when programs share? I feel like I’m back in kindergarten.) Just as bring-
ing text into Publisher is called importing, sending text out is called exporting.
Publisher provides two ways to export text:
 Choose Edit➪Copy to copy selected text from Publisher to the Windows
Clipboard, and then switch to another Windows program and choose
Edit➪Paste to paste it directly into that program. If the program you’re
pasting text into uses the Ribbon, choose Paste on the Clipboard group
of the Home tab.
Figure 6-4:

142
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

 Choose File➪Save As to send all text in a publication to a text file or
word processor file in one of the formats listed in the preceding sec-
tion. Publisher opens a dialog box informing you that the file type you
selected supports only text. Click OK to save it anyway.
It’s probably unfortunate that Publisher (still!) doesn’t have an Export com-
mand on its File menu, as other desktop publishing programs do. Then I
could make believe that there’s more to know about exporting text from the
program than there really is. It’s almost too easy.
Word up
In the past, the folks at Microsoft went to a lot of trouble to make typing and
editing text in Publisher as easy as typing and editing text in Microsoft Word.
One way they did that was by maintaining a remarkable similarity between
the toolbars in Publisher and in the available versions of Word.
My, how times have changed. Microsoft Word 2007 was released with its new
Ribbon feature, and now we have to unlearn the old way of doing things in
Word and learn the new ways. If you went to the trouble of learning them, 
you may want to stick with Word 2007 when you want to create and edit text,
rather than create and edit text within Publisher. I do. Let’s face it: Publisher
is an excellent publication design and layout program, but a word processor
it isn’t.
Inserting a Word document
If you have an existing Microsoft Word document that you want to include in
your publication, follow these steps:
1. Locate the text box into which you want to import the Word file, and
then position the insertion point inside the box where you want the
text to appear.
2. Choose Insert➪Text File.
The Insert Text dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 6-3.)
3. Select All Text Formats from the Files of Type drop-down list.
4. Locate your Word document, highlight it, and click OK.
After a moment, the text from your Word document appears in the
selected text box. Breathe a sigh of relief as you realize that you don’t
have to reformat all that text. Your Word document retains its formatting
when you import it into Publisher.
143
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

Using Word to edit your text
If, after bringing your Word document into Publisher, you need to make
changes, you don’t have to launch Word, open the Word document, save 
your changes, close Word, and import the document all over again. And, you
don’t have to edit the text in Publisher, either. Just tell Publisher that 
you want to use Word to edit the text contained in the current text box:
1. Click inside the text frame that contains the text you want to edit.
2. Choose Edit➪Edit Story in Microsoft Word.
Word leaps (or crawls, depending on your computer) onto the screen,
replete with your Publisher text.
3. Edit the text to your heart’s content.
4. Choose File➪Close & Return To <your publication name>.
If you’re lucky enough to have Word 2007 installed on your computer, you
may have noticed by now that it has no File menu. Just click the Office
Button, in the upper-right corner of the Word window. You see the Close
& Return To <your publication name> menu choice at the bottom of the
menu.
Word wanders off to whatever hiding place it occupies when you aren’t
using it, and your publication, including the edits made in Word, returns
to the screen. (Try to refrain from doing a victory dance if anyone is
watching.)
Using part of a Word document
The technique of inserting a text file works well for bringing an entire Microsoft
Word document into a publication, but what do you do if you want to use only
part of a Word document? You copy and paste, of course! Follow these steps:
1. Launch Word and open the document that contains the text you want
to place into your publication.
2. Use your favorite text selection technique to highlight some text.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy, press Ctrl+C, or click the Copy button on the
Standard toolbar.
If you use Word 2007, you can just click the Copy button in the Clipboard
section of the Home tab.
4. Switch to the Microsoft Publisher 2007 window by clicking its button
on the Windows taskbar.
If the Windows taskbar isn’t visible, you can switch applications by press-
ing Alt+Tab. Hold down the Alt key and press Tab until the Microsoft
Publisher 2007 icon is highlighted in the Cool Switch box that appears.
Release both keys.
144
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

5. Click in the text box at the location where you want to insert the text
from the Word document.
If the text box is empty, click anywhere inside the text box.
6. Choose Edit➪Paste, press Ctrl+V, or click the Paste button on the
Standard toolbar.
The text from the Word document appears in the selected text box as if
by magic. (Gotta love that copy-and-paste operation.)
Let Me Tell You a Story
In its simplest form, a Publisher story is a block of text that exists in a single,
self-contained text box. When you add large amounts of text to a publication,
you often have text that doesn’t fit in a single text box. In these cases, the tra-
ditional publishing solution is to jump (continue) each story to other pages.
Jumps are extremely common in newspapers and magazines: How often each
day do you see lines that read “Continued on page 3” or “Continued from
page 1”?
The capability to jump a particular story between text boxes and pages is one
of the best arguments for using Publisher rather than a word processing pro-
gram. Although most word processing programs deal with all the text in a file
as one big story, Publisher excels at juggling multiple stories within a single
publication. For example, you can begin four stories on page 1 and then jump
half those stories to page 2 and the other half to page 3. At the same time,
you can begin separate stories on pages 2 and 3 and jump each of those sto-
ries to any other page. If there’s not enough room on a page to finish a story
that you already jumped from another page, you can jump the story to another
page and then another and another. The sky (or maybe the forest) is the limit.
Forming, reforming, and deforming stories
To enable a story to jump across and flow through a series, or chain, of sev-
eral text boxes, you connect those text boxes to each other in the order that
you want the story to jump and flow. A chain of connected text boxes can
exist on a single page or across multiple pages. You can even connect text
boxes that are in the scratch area (the gray work area surrounding your page)
and then later move those text boxes to your publication pages.
Although you can use side-by-side connected text boxes on a single page to
create snaking columns, where text ends at the bottom of one column and
continues again at the top of the next (as you find in a newspaper or maga-
zine), you may find it easier to set multiple columns within a single text box
on a page.
145
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

How and when you connect text boxes depends on your situation:
 If you haven’t yet typed or imported text: You can manually connect
empty text boxes to serve as a series of ready-made containers for that
text. When you then type or import your text, it automatically jumps and
flows between text boxes, like water jumps and flows between the sepa-
rate compartments in a plastic ice-cube tray. (Just remember not to put
your Publisher files in the freezer.)
 If you’re typing text in Publisher and don’t know how much text you’ll
have: You can manually connect to new text boxes as you run out of
room in each current text box.
 If you’re importing text and there’s not enough room to fit it in the
current text box: You can use the program’s autoflow feature to help
connect your text boxes. You can even have Publisher draw new text
boxes and insert new pages as needed to fit all the text.
The next few sections show you how to best handle each of these situations.
Connecting text boxes
When you select a text box, you may see one of several items attached to 
the top or bottom of the text box. The Text in Overflow indicator (refer to
Figure 6-2) lets you know that the text doesn’t fit in the text box and has, 
well, overflowed. The appearance of either the Go to Next Text Box button or
the Go to Previous Text Box button is an indication that the selected text box
is already connected to at least one other text box. Clicking one of these but-
tons moves the insertion point to the next or previous connected text box 
in the chain.
Here’s how to connect a text box to another text box:
1. The easiest way to create linked text boxes is to create a series of text
boxes first. Select the Text Box tool on the Objects toolbar and draw
text boxes of the number and size that you estimate you need.
You might need to modify the number or sizes of text boxes later, but it’s
helpful to begin with a series already created.
2. Click a text box to select it.
The Connect Text Boxes toolbar appears next to the Standard toolbar.
If the Connect Text Boxes toolbar is being stubborn and doesn’t show up
when you click a text box, you can force the toolbar to appear by choos-
ing View➪Toolbars➪Connect Text Boxes from the main menu.
146
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

3. Click the Create Text Box Link button on the Connect Text Boxes 
toolbar.
The Text Box Link Button looks exactly like three links in a chain.
The mouse pointer changes from a standard arrow pointer to a cute
little pitcher pointer, bearing a downward-pointing arrow. As you move
over an empty text box, the pitcher tilts, and the arrow points to the
right. The metaphor that Publisher is using is that you’re pouring text
from one text box to another. (It could be worse. In earlier days, pro-
grams often used a loaded-gun icon.)
By the way, anytime you accidentally click the Create Text Box Link
button, you can press the Esc key or just click away from a text box to
get rid of the pitcher pointer.
4. After clicking the Create Text Box Link button in Step 2, click the empty
text box to which you want to connect the first text box. The text
“pours” into the text box, filling it until it overflows.
5. To link additional text boxes, click the Create Text Box Link button
again, and then click the next empty text box (even one on another
page) to which you want to connect in the sequence.
The pitcher pointer tips sideways, drains its text, and reverts to a normal
pointer.
The two text boxes are now connected; any text in the first text box’s overflow
area appears in the second text box. Also, as you type or enter additional text
into the first text box, it pushes extra text into the second text box. To create
a chain of more than two linked text boxes, repeat the preceding steps. If a
chain is empty, you can link another chain to its first text box to create the
combination of the two chains.
As you might guess, you can connect only text boxes. If you select a table
frame or a picture frame, you don’t see the Connect Text Boxes toolbar. Also,
you can’t connect a text box that’s already connected to some other text box
or a text box that has some text in it already. If you try to do this, Publisher
displays a message box informing you that the text box must be empty.
After you connect text boxes, extra buttons appear at the top and/or bottom
of each text box when the text box is selected. Figure 6-5 shows examples of
three connected text boxes on a page and in sequence. Notice that when the
middle text box is selected, two buttons are attached to it: the Go to Previous
Text Box button on top and the Go to Next Text Box button on the bottom.
Think of the text boxes in Figure 6-5 as three separate figures, though: If you
try to select all three text boxes at the same time on your screen, you see the
text boxes selected as a group with only a single Group Objects button.
147
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

Don’t worry too much about connecting text boxes in the proper order the
first time around. After you connect text boxes, you can disconnect and
rearrange them quite easily. Later in this chapter, the “Rearranging chains”
section tells you how.
Moving among the story’s frames
One of the first issues to consider when you work with multiple-text-box story
text is how best to move among the story’s text boxes — and how to know
which text box follows which! You can move easily and reliably between con-
nected text boxes by using either the mouse or the keyboard. Both methods
are easy.
Use one of these two methods to move between connected frames by using
the mouse:
 To move backward in the sequence: Click the Go to Previous Text Box
button.
 To move forward in the sequence: Click the Go to Next Text Box button.
These two buttons are shown in Figure 6-5. The arrow button at the top of 
the text box is the Go to Previous Text Box button; the arrow button at the
bottom is the Go to Next Text Box button. The first text box in a chain has no
Go to Previous Text Box button, whereas the last text box has no Go to Next
Text Box button.
You can also use the Go to Previous Text Box and Go to Next Text Box but-
tons on the Connect Text Boxes toolbar. They’re the second-to-last and last
buttons on the toolbar, respectively. Figure 6-6 shows the Connect Text Boxes
toolbar.
Use one of these methods to move between connected text boxes by using
the keyboard:
 To move to and select the chain’s next text box: Press Ctrl+Tab from a
connected text box (that’s selected).
 To move to and select the chain’s previous text box: Press
Ctrl+Shift+Tab from a connected text box (that’s selected).

148
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

If your connected text boxes are full of text, you can also use many of the key-
board shortcuts for navigating text (listed in Chapter 7) to move between
connected text boxes. If your insertion point is on the last line of text in a
connected text box, for example, you can press the down-arrow key to move
to (and select) the chain’s next text box.
Autoflowing text
Publisher uses an autoflow feature to help you fit long text documents into a
series of linked text boxes. This feature is handy for automatically managing
the flow of text among pages of your publication. To autoflow text into a set
of linked text boxes, you select the first text box in the chain. When you insert
(or copy) text into the text box, Publisher fills the connected text boxes,
beginning with the text box you selected, with the inserted text. If the inserted
text fits in the selected text box or chain of text boxes, you’re done.
If not all the text fits into the first text box or the set of linked text boxes,
Publisher displays the message box shown in Figure 6-7. Click Yes to autoflow
your text, or click No to put the text into the overflow area of the first text
box. Publisher then proceeds to the next text box in the sequence and again
asks your permission to autoflow text to that text box. Publisher continues
posting this message box with every additional text box it requires.
If you don’t have enough linked text boxes to take care of the incoming text,
the autoflow process continues: Publisher autoflows the extra text into the
first empty or unconnected text box it can find or, failing that, the first text

box of any empty, connected series of text boxes that exist in your publica-
tion. At each new text box, the program asks your permission to use that 
text box.
Wait — there’s more! If no empty text boxes are available, Publisher displays
a third message box that asks whether you want to create additional pages at
the end of your publication and fill those pages with full-page text boxes until
the imported text has been placed. If you click Yes, Publisher 2007 continues
flowing the story to the end, creating new pages and full-page text boxes as
required. At the end of this process, the program displays a dialog box that
tells you the number of new pages created and your current page location, 
as shown in Figure 6-8.
Publisher looks for text boxes from top to bottom, and then from left to right
and, finally, from page to page. The program even suggests empty text boxes
that it finds in the scratch area. If you want Publisher to connect text frames
in a different order, forget autoflow and instead connect the frames manually.
The autoflow process is a lot more complex to explain than it is to do. I find it
natural, efficient, and well thought out; I doubt that it will give you pause or
worry.
If text already exists in a text box but you still want to take advantage of
Publisher’s autoflow feature, click in one of the text boxes and press Ctrl+A,
and then cut and paste the story to your target text box. Publisher treats
pasted text just like it does inserted text, and initiates the autoflow process
described in this section.
Rearranging chains
When you rearrange a chain, you have to tackle two tasks: Temporarily break
the chain (disconnecting two text boxes in the chain) at the point at which
you want to begin rearranging, and then reconnect the text boxes in the
order you want.
Figure 6-8:

Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

Suppose that you have a chain, A-B-C-D, and you plan to add the text box X
between text boxes B and C, to make the chain A-B-X-C-D. Follow these steps
to rearrange the chain:
1. Click text box B to select it.
2. Click the Break Forward Link button (the second button from the left;
refer to Figure 6-6) on the Connect Text Boxes toolbar.
If the Connect Text Boxes toolbar doesn’t appear when you click text
box B, choose View➪Toolbars➪Connect Text Boxes from the main
menu. You now have two chains: A-B and C-D.
3. Click the Create Text Box Link button (the first button on the left;
refer to Figure 6-6) on the Connect Text Boxes toolbar.
Text box B is still selected, and the mouse pointer turns into that cool
pitcher again.
4. Click text box X.
Now you have chains A-B-X and C-D.
5. Click the Create Text Box Link button on the Connect Text Boxes 
toolbar.
Text box X is still selected.
6. Click text box C.
Now you have one chain: A-B-X-C-D.
Voilà — you’re ready to go into the chain-repair business!
If you don’t reconnect C-D to your chain but continue to add new text boxes,
eventually your story flows into your new additional text boxes. Text boxes 
C and D are still connected to each other; they just aren’t connected to your
linked chain.
Text box X in this example can be an empty, unconnected text box or an empty,
connected text box that’s the first text box in another chain — no surprise
there. Because you’re rearranging a chain, however, text box X also can 
be any empty text box that was, but is no longer, an original part of the cur-
rent chain. For example, if you disconnect text boxes B and C in the chain 
A-B-C-D, you can then click text box D to make it the third frame in the 
chain A-B-D-C.
If you try to type in an empty, connected text box that isn’t the first text box
in a chain, Publisher informs you that this text box is part of another chain
and asks whether you want to begin a new story at this point in the chain.
Click OK to have the program disconnect that text box from the preceding
text box in the chain. Any text boxes farther down the chain are now part of
the new story.
151
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

You can use this technique only when typing; it doesn’t work when you’re
importing or inserting a text file. To insert a text file into an empty, connected
text box that’s not the first text box in a chain, you must first manually dis-
connect that text box from the preceding text box in the chain.
After you know how to break a chain temporarily to rearrange it, permanently
breaking a chain is easy. Just select the text box that you want to be the last
in the chain and click the Break Forward Link button on the Connect Text
Boxes toolbar. All text that follows in the next text boxes disappears from
those text boxes and becomes overflow text for the last text box in the
sequence. You can place the text where you want it at a later time when 
you connect this last text box to another text box.
Deleting stories
Connecting text boxes makes accidental text deletions a little less likely.
Unfortunately, it also makes intentional deletions a little more difficult. 
Life is full of trade-offs!
When you delete a story’s only text box, the story text has nowhere else to
go, so it gets wiped out along with the text box. When you delete a text box
from a multiple-text-box story, however, the story text has somewhere it can
go: into the other text boxes in the chain. Publisher is also nice enough to
mend the chain for you. If you have the chain A-B-C and you delete text box
B, for example, the program leaves you with the chain A-C.
If you really want to delete multiple-text-box story text, follow these steps:
1. Click any text box in the story and choose Edit➪Select All or press
Ctrl+A.
2. Press the Delete or Backspace key.
The entire story is deleted without deleting the text boxes.
Editing story text
Cutting and copying connected text boxes and the story text within them
work similarly to deleting connected text boxes. If you cut or copy a con-
nected text box, the pasting action results in only an empty text box; the
story text in the original text box remains a part of the original story. To cut
or copy multiple-text-box story text, you must highlight the text itself.
Although editing and formatting multiple-text-box story text is much the same
as editing and formatting single-text-box story text, you can work yourself
into a lather trying to highlight text in multiple text boxes by dragging over 
152
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

it with the mouse. Save yourself a whole lot of grief: Use the Shift key together
with the keyboard-based movement techniques listed in Table 7-1 (over in
Chapter 7). For example, press Shift+Ctrl+End to extend your selection to the
end of the current text box, and then press Shift+right arrow to extend your
selection to the next text box in your publication. You also can select all text
in a multiple-text-box story by choosing Edit➪Select All from the menu bar, 
as mentioned in the preceding section or press Ctrl+A.
If your connected text boxes are full of text, you can capitalize on the Select
All command to zip to the beginning or end of a chain. Just choose Edit➪
Select All and then press either the left- or right-arrow key. This technique is
handy when you want to insert or delete text at the beginning or end of a story.
Select All is helpful for other processes too — for example, for deleting the
entire text in a story. (Maybe you want to place a new version of the story in
your publication.) Or, perhaps you want to edit your story in a word proces-
sor: You can use Select All to select the story and then export the story to a
text or word processor file, open your word processor, open the file, and
make your edits.
If you use Word, you can choose Edit➪Edit Story in Microsoft Word from the
Publisher main menu. (The command also conveniently sits on the context-
sensitive menu of the text box. Right-click a text box and choose Change Text
to see it.) This command launches the Microsoft Word OLE server and opens
the program with your story displayed in a document window, as shown in
Figure 6-9. When you finish making edits and close the Word window, you
automatically return to Publisher. Except for the title bar in Word, you would
never know that Publisher was the OLE client running the session. You just
can’t beat this kind of integration between these two programs.
Adding Continued notices
Publisher offers a feature to help readers locate the next and previous frames
in a story in your publication: Continued notices. Publishing professionals
sometimes refer to these handy guidance devices as jump lines. They come in
two types: a Continued from Page notice tells readers where the story left off;
a Continued on Page notice tells readers where the story continues.
Publisher manages Continued notices for you as an automated feature. You
must manually insert and delete Continued notices to get things rolling, but
after you set them up, Publisher keeps them up to date as your story grows
(or shrinks) to new pages. Publisher even keeps the Continued notices up to
date even when a text box is manually moved to a different page. To create a
Continued notice, just right-click a linked text frame, choose Format Text Box
from the context-sensitive menu, and select the Text Box tab in the Format
Text Box dialog box. Select or deselect the Include Continued on Page and
153
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

Include Continued from Page check boxes to turn the notices on or off,
respectively, for the selected text box. When you click OK, the program
places the notices in your text box. Figure 6-10 shows you an example.
Publisher displays Continued notices only when it makes sense to display
them. A Continued on Page notice is displayed only if the current story jumps
to another text box on another page. A Continued from Page notice is dis-
played only if the current story jumps from a previous text box on another
page. If you modify a story in such a way that a Continued notice no longer
makes sense, the program automatically hides that notice.

Story jumps can be distracting, and after readers jump to a new page, they
don’t often come back to the page from which they jumped. Use story jumps
as little as possible to increase reader comprehension.
When a Continued notice is displayed, it always contains the proper page 
reference. If you move or delete the next text box in a chain or add or remove
pages between connected text boxes, Publisher adjusts the page reference
automatically; it certainly is smart in its handling of Continued notices!
If you don’t like the wording of a Continued notice, you can edit it the same
way you edit any other text. For example, you can change a Continued on
Page notice to read “See page x” or “I ran out of room here, so I stuck the rest
of the story on page x.” You can even add multiple lines to a Continued notice
by pressing Enter while the insertion point is in the Continued notice, which
is an improvement over earlier versions of the software. If you pressed Enter
in a Continued notice in an earlier version, your computer just beeped at you.
And, although you can add multiple lines to a Continued notice, you have to
be careful not to type more than a full line of text on any of those lines. If you
add so much text to a Continued notice that it no longer fits on one line,
some of the text disappears.
If you accidentally delete a Continued notice’s page-reference number, you
can replace it by choosing Insert➪Page Numbers from the main menu. Or,
from the Format Text Box dialog box, turn off the Continued notice and then
turn the notice back on. Your notice is reinserted in the text box as good as
new. If you use this method, note that default text is used for the Continued
On and Continued From notices after they’re deleted and reinserted. If you
want to use your own text, you’ll have to retype it. (To open the Format Text
Box dialog box, right-click a linked text frame and choose Format Text Box
from the context-sensitive menu. You can also click inside the text box and
choose Text Box from the Format menu.)
Aligning Your Text with Table Frames
As you discover in Chapter 7, you can use tab stops and tabs in paragraphs to
create tables in text boxes. You can use a more elegant method, however —
table frames — to create a predefined grid of columns and rows that automati-
cally aligns your text perfectly, and keeps it perfectly aligned. Table frames
are so easy to create and manage that it makes little sense not to use them
throughout your publication whenever you need tabular displays.
Figure 6-11 shows you how a plain, unformatted table frame might look after
you create it. You can tell by the selection handles that the table frame is
selected.
155
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

Here are some important concepts to know about table frames:
 A table frame’s selection handles are displayed only when the frame is
selected — and they’re never printed.
 If you can’t see gridlines on-screen, choose View➪Boundaries and
Guides or press Ctrl+Shift+O. You can hide gridlines by choosing
View➪Boundaries and Guides again.
 If you choose a table format, elements that appear to be nonprinting
gridlines in your table frame may instead be cell borders that do print.
 If you choose to show special characters in your publication (which I
recommend), each cell also displays an end-of-story mark that looks 
like a small starburst. (You see these marks in text boxes too.) As with
other special characters, end-of-story marks are displayed only on-screen;
they aren’t printed.
Moving around in tables
Publisher has only two navigation techniques specific to table frames:
Figure 6-11:
A blank,
five-column
table.
156
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

 Press Tab to move to the next cell (to the right). If there’s no cell to 
the right, the next cell is the first (leftmost) cell in the row immediately
below. If you press Tab in a table frame’s lower-right cell, however, you
create an extra row of cells at the bottom of the table frame.
 Press Shift+Tab to move to the previous cell (to the left). If there’s no
cell to the left, the previous cell is the last (rightmost) cell in the row
immediately above. If you press Shift+Tab in a table frame’s upper-left
cell, nothing happens.
If the cell you move to contains any text, these movement techniques also
highlight that text.
Although pressing Tab and Shift+Tab can move the insertion point to any cell
in a table frame, you may find it convenient at times to use other movement
techniques. As with text boxes, you can move anywhere in a table frame by
simply clicking at that position. You can also use many of the same keyboard
shortcuts to move the insertion point around in tables. For information on
moving around in text boxes, see Chapter 7.
Creating a table frame
Chapter 5 briefly explains how to create a table frame: Click the Insert Table
tool in the toolbox and then click and drag the frame outline. Table frames
are different from text boxes in this respect: After you create a frame outline,
you have to make a selection from the Create Table dialog box that then
appears. (See Figure 6-12.)
You make three selections in this dialog box:
 Number of rows
 Number of columns
 Table format
Figure 6-12:
The Create
Table 
dialog box.
157
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

Publisher lets you create tables as large as 128 x 128 cells and offers 21 differ-
ent table styles, or formats. As you select a format, the program shows you a
sample of the format in the Sample area of the dialog box. The [None] format
displays a plain, unformatted table frame. When you click OK in the Create
Table dialog box, Publisher creates your table in the frame you drew. If the
size of the frame you draw is too small to contain the number of columns and
rows you chose, Publisher displays a message box asking whether you want
to resize the table to hold the selected rows. Click Yes to have Publisher
resize the table so that it’s larger; click No to reduce the number of rows and
columns in your table.
Each table format has a minimum default cell size. If you select a larger number
of cells than can be accommodated, Publisher displays a dialog box asking
your permission to resize the frame. If you click No, you return to the Create
Table dialog box, where you can then reduce the number of rows and columns
in your table. If you click Yes, you create a table with the number of rows and
columns you specified using the minimum cell dimensions.
Modifying tables
When a table is selected, the Table menu commands become active. This
menu, shown in Figure 6-13, contains commands you can use to modify the
appearance of the table. If you choose the Table AutoFormat command, the
Auto Format dialog box appears. (See Figure 6-14.) This dialog box is almost
identical to the Create Table dialog box, shown earlier, in Figure 6-12. The 
differences are that you can’t change the number of rows or cells, but you
can control some of the formatting options you apply to the table.
Although applying manual formatting is a good way to get your table frame to
look just the way you want, it sometimes can mean plenty of work. Rather
than manually format a table frame, use AutoFormat; it can do a lot of work
for you. The AutoFormat feature not only applies character and paragraph
formatting but also can merge cells and add cell borders and shading. Cell
borders overlay table-frame gridlines and, unlike gridlines, are printed. 
Cell shading, a color or pattern that fills the interior of a cell, is also printed.
Click the Options button in the Auto Format dialog box to open a list of for-
matting options, such as Text Formatting, Text Alignment, Patterns and
Shading, and Borders. You can select and deselect the options you want or
don’t want to apply.
Resizing tables, columns, and rows
The structure of a table frame truly differentiates it from a text frame. Whereas
a text frame is one big rectangle into which you dump your text, a table frame
is divided into a grid of separate text compartments (cells). After you create
a table frame, you’re not stuck with its original structure. You can resize the
158
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

entire table frame; resize, insert, or delete selected columns and rows; merge
multiple cells into one; and split a cell into separate cells. In short, you can
restructure a table frame in just about any way you want.
Here are some guidelines for resizing a table frame:
 You can click and drag any of its selection handles. Publisher automati-
cally adjusts the height of each row to fit each row’s contents.
 When you narrow or widen a table frame, thus decreasing or increasing
the available horizontal area in each cell, Publisher often compensates
by heightening or shortening some rows, thus heightening or shortening
the overall frame.
 When you shorten a table frame, Publisher reduces each row to only the
minimum length required to display the text in each row.
 Regardless of whether your table frame contains text, you can’t reduce
any cell to less than 1⁄8-inch square. You can heighten a table frame as
much as you want, however; and Publisher heightens each row by the
same proportion.
 If you choose Table➪Grow to Fit Text, the table’s row height expands to
accommodate the text you enter.
Figure 6-14:
The Auto
Format
dialog box.
Figure 6-13:
The Table
menu.
159
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

Here are some guidelines for resizing a column or row:
 Move the mouse pointer to the edge of a column until it becomes a
double-headed arrow. Then click and drag until the column or row is 
the size you want.
 You can’t shorten a row to a shorter length than is required to display its
text, and you can’t shrink any cell to less than 1⁄8 inch wide by 1⁄4 inch tall.
 By default, when you resize a column or row, Publisher keeps all other
columns and rows at their original size. Columns to the right are pushed
to the right or pulled to the left, whereas rows below are pushed down
or pulled up. The table frame increases or decreases in overall size to
accommodate the change.
 To keep a table frame the same size when resizing a column or row, hold
down the Shift key as you resize. You then move only the border between
the current column or row and the next one. If you enlarge a column or
row, the next column or row shrinks by that same amount. If you instead
shrink a column or row, the next column or row enlarges by that amount.
In either case, all other columns and rows remain the same size, as does
the overall table frame.
 If you use the Shift key while resizing, you face even more limits. Unless
you first lock the table frame (by selecting Table➪Grow to Fit Text from
the main menu), you can’t shorten the row below the row you’re resizing
to less space than that lower row requires in order to display its text.
And, you can’t shrink any adjacent column to less than 1⁄8 inch wide or a
row to less than 1⁄4 inch tall. In addition, even if you lock the table frame,
you can increase a column or row only by the amount you can take from
the next column or row.
 You can resize multiple columns or rows simultaneously. Just highlight
those columns or rows, point to the right or bottom edge of the selec-
tion bar button that borders the right or bottom edge of your highlight,
and then click and drag. Note that if you use the Shift key to resize, how-
ever, the program ignores your highlighting. You resize only the rightmost
highlighted column or bottommost highlighted row.
 If you resize an entire table frame after resizing individual columns and
rows, Publisher resizes the columns and rows proportionally. For exam-
ple, if the first column is 2 inches wide and the second column is 1 inch
wide, and you then double the width of the entire table frame, the first
column increases to 4 inches wide, and the second column increases 
to 2 inches.
Inserting and deleting columns and rows
You can insert and delete as many as 128 columns and rows apiece. If you
move to the last cell and press Tab, Publisher adds a new row at the bottom
of the table frame and places the insertion point in the first cell of that row.
You’re now ready to type in that cell. How convenient!
160
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

To insert rows elsewhere, or to insert columns anywhere, you need to do
only a little more work:
1. Place the insertion point in the column or row adjacent to where you
want to insert a new column or row.
2. Choose Table➪Insert.
Publisher displays the Insert menu, as shown in Figure 6-15.
3. Select whether you want columns to the left, columns to the right,
rows above, or rows below.
Even if a table frame is locked (refer to the section “Resizing tables,
columns, and rows,” earlier in this chapter), the program increases the
table frame’s size to accommodate the new columns or rows.
Deleting a column is easy. Follow these steps:
1. Highlight the entire column you want to delete by placing the mouse
pointer immediately above the column. When the pointer changes to
a bold, downward-pointing arrow, click to select the column.
You can click and drag to select multiple columns.
2. Choose Table➪Delete➪Columns.
Deleting a row is just as easy:
1. Highlight the entire row you want to delete by placing the mouse
pointer immediately to the left of the row. When the pointer changes
to a bold, right-pointing arrow, click to select the row.
You can click and drag to select multiple rows.
2. Choose Table➪Delete➪Rows.
Figure 6-15:
The Table
Insert
submenu.
161
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

The quickest way to delete a single row or column is to put an insertion point
in the row or column you want to delete, and select the option from the menu.
The row or column is now deleted, and you didn’t have to highlight or drag
over anything.
Before choosing the Table menu, decide how many rows or columns you want
to add or delete, and select that number of rows or columns in the table.
Then choose Insert or Delete from the Table menu. Choose Columns to the
Left, Columns to the Right, Rows Above, or Rows Below[0].
Merging and splitting cells
You may occasionally want to merge multiple cells so that they become one
cell. For example, you may want to merge cells so that you can center a head-
ing over multiple columns, as shown in Figure 6-16.
Keep these concepts in mind when you’re merging cells:
 To merge cells, highlight the cells you want to merge and then choose
Table➪Merge Cells. Your highlighted cells become one. Any text in the
individual cells moves into the single merged cell. You then can work
with this merged cell as you would work with any other cell.
 After you merge a cell, you can split it into individual cells again. Click
or highlight the merged cell and choose Table➪Split Cells. The merged
cell splits back into the original number of separate cells. The text, how-
ever, doesn’t return to the original, individual cells. Instead, all the text
moves intact to the leftmost and topmost cell.
The table’s context-sensitive menu contains commands for inserting and
deleting rows and columns and for merging and splitting cells. After you
right-click the table, choose Change Table to see them.
Figure 6-16:

162
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

In addition to being able to split cells horizontally, you can split cells diago-
nally in Publisher. Select the cells you want to split diagonally and choose
Table➪Cell Diagonals. In the Cell Diagonals dialog box, pick the type of 
diagonal you want (Divide Down or Divide Up) and click OK.
Working with table text
As with text boxes, you can fill a table frame by either typing the text directly
into the frame or importing existing text from somewhere else. Except for the
differences that I point out in the next two sections, the techniques for typing
and importing text into text boxes and table frames are pretty darn similar.
Each cell in a table frame works much like a miniature text box. For example,
when you reach the right edge of a cell, Publisher automatically word-wraps
your text to a new line within that cell. If the text you type disappears beyond
the right edge of the cell, you have probably locked the table. Choose
Table➪Grow to Fit Text to unlock it. If you want to end a short line within a
cell, press Enter. The easiest method is usually to fill in the table frame row
by row; when you finish one cell, just press Tab to move on to the next one.
I don’t know why you would ever need a tab mark in a table frame, but if you
do, press Ctrl+Tab.
There’s one important difference between typing in a cell and typing in a text
box: When you run out of vertical room in a cell, Publisher automatically
heightens that entire row of cells to accommodate additional lines of text. If
you later remove or reduce the size of some of that text, Publisher automati-
cally shortens that row. Compare this process to typing in a text box: When
you run out of room, the text box remains the same size, and the program
sticks the text into an overflow area or, if it’s available, a connected text box.
Importing table frame text
Just as you can do with text boxes, you can paste or insert a text file into a
table frame. Some important differences exist, however. If your text is arranged
in a table-like manner, such as in a spreadsheet or a word processing table,
Publisher senses the arrangement and imports that text across the necessary
number of cells in your table frame. If the text isn’t arranged in a table-like
manner, Publisher imports all text into the current cell.
If no table-like feature is available in your other program, you can use 
tab marks or commas (delimiters) to indicate column separations and 
paragraph marks (end-of-row markers) to indicate row separations.
Although you may be able to use the Insert➪Text File command to import
text into a table frame (as described earlier in this chapter), the Windows
Clipboard is much more reliable. Use it whenever possible.
163
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

Choose one of these two methods to paste or insert text into a table:
 Cut or copy the text to the Windows Clipboard; then click the cell that
will become the upper-left cell of the range and choose Edit➪Paste or
press Ctrl+V.
 Select a table cell and choose Insert➪Text File to import text into the
table frame.
When you import text into a table frame, Publisher overwrites (replaces) any
text that exists in the cells into which you import. To restore accidentally
overwritten text, immediately click the Undo button or press Ctrl+Z.
Here are some other important concepts to remember about bringing text
into your table:
 If the copied text is arranged in a table-like manner and the current table
frame doesn’t have enough cells to accommodate all the copied cells,
Publisher opens a dialog box to ask whether it should insert columns and
rows as necessary. Click Yes to make sure that you paste all your text.
 If you haven’t selected a table frame and the copied text is arranged in a
table-like manner, the program creates a new table frame and places the
copied text into that frame.
 Although a table frame can look much like a spreadsheet, Publisher
doesn’t have the power to calculate numbers. If you want to calculate
the numbers in a table, calculate them in a spreadsheet program before
importing. If you don’t have a spreadsheet program, pull out your 
calculator!
 You can also make objects inline to table cells or to the text in a cell. When
the object is inline to the text in the cell, the inline object moves with the
text. When the object is inline to the table cell, the object is embedded
in the cell and moves with the table. To make an object inline to a table
cell or to text, right-click and drag the object. Release the mouse button
where you want the object to land and then select Move Here or Move
into Text Flow Here.
Editing table-frame text is much the same as editing text-box text. You need
to know just a few extra procedures to efficiently highlight, move, and copy
table-frame text.
You can use all the same mouse techniques to highlight (select) table-frame
text as you use to highlight text-box text: drag, double-click, and Shift+click.
You can also highlight table-frame text by combining the Shift key with any
table-frame-movement techniques that I mention earlier in this section.
You also can highlight the contents of an entire cell by pressing Tab or
Shift+Tab to move to that cell.
164
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

When you highlight any amount of text in more than one cell, you automati-
cally highlight the entire contents of all those cells.
Here are some additional ways to select table-frame text:
 Select the entire contents of the current cell: Choose Table➪Select➪
Cell or press Ctrl+A (for All).
 Select every cell in a column: Choose Table➪Select➪Column.
 Select every cell in a row: Choose Table➪Select➪Row.
 Select multiple columns or rows: Click in any cell and drag across the
rows or columns you want to select. Then choose Table➪Select➪
Column or Table➪Select➪Row. Hold the Shift key and press the arrow
keys to expand the selection.
 Select every cell in a table frame: Choose Table➪Select➪Table.
Moving and copying table text
As with text boxes, you can use the Clipboard or drag-and-drop text editing
(see Chapter 7) to copy and move text within and between table frames. If
you like, you can even copy text between text and table frames.
Working in a table frame involves a very important difference, however: When-
ever you move or copy the contents of multiple cells into other cells, Publisher
automatically overwrites any text in those destination cells. To retain the
contents of a destination cell, be sure to move or copy the contents of only
one cell at a time. If you accidentally overwrite text when moving or copying,
immediately choose Edit➪Undo from the menu (or press Ctrl+Z).
Because of the way in which Publisher overwrites destination cells, rearrang-
ing entire columns and rows of text requires some extra steps. First, insert an
extra column or row where you want to move the contents of an existing
column or row. Then move the contents. Finally, delete the column or row you
just emptied. Repeat these steps for every column and row you want to move.
Two commands on the Table menu, Fill Down and Fill Right, enable you to
copy the entire contents of one cell into any number of adjacent cells either
below or to the right.
Follow these steps to fill a series of cells in a row or column:
1. Select the cell containing the text you want to copy and the cells to
which you want to copy the text.
To use the Fill commands, you must select cells adjacent to the cell 
containing the text to be copied.
165
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

2a. Choose Table➪Fill Down to copy the value in the topmost cell to the
selected cells in the column below it.
or
2b. Choose Table➪Fill Right to copy the value in the leftmost cell to
selected cells in the row to the right.
Formatting table text manually
You can format table-frame text manually to make that information easier to
read and understand. You can use all the character- and paragraph-formatting
options detailed in Chapter 7: fonts, text size, text effects, line spacing, align-
ment, tab stops, indents, and bulleted and numbered lists, for example. You
can even hyphenate table-frame text.
The key difference when applying paragraph formatting in table frames is that
Publisher treats each cell as a miniature text box. Thus, when you align text,
the text aligns within just that cell rather than across the entire table frame.
And, when you indent text, the text is indented according to that cell’s left and
right edges.
To improve the look of cells, you can also change cell margins, thus changing
the amount of space between a cell’s contents and its edges. To change cell
margins, choose Format➪Table and click the Cell Properties tab. The result-
ing dialog box is shown in Figure 6-17.

Using Excel tables
Publisher lets you create and edit tables in your publication. It even has that
cool Table AutoFormat command. However, if you’re a Microsoft Excel user,
you may find entering and formatting your tabular data in Microsoft Excel
more convenient. Maybe you already have a Microsoft Excel worksheet that
contains data you want to include in your publication. You don’t have to
waste time and risk data entry errors by retyping the information.
Importing an Excel worksheet
If you use Microsoft Excel and don’t want to remember all the instructions for
working with tables in Publisher, don’t. Use Microsoft Excel to enter and
format your tabular data and then import the worksheet into Publisher:
1. In Microsoft Excel, enter and format some tabular data.
2. Save the Microsoft Excel worksheet.
If you’re finished working in Microsoft Excel, you can close it.
3. Switch to the Publisher window by clicking its button on the Windows
taskbar.
If the Windows taskbar isn’t visible, you can switch applications by
pressing Alt+Tab. Hold down the Alt key and press Tab until the
Microsoft Publisher 2007 icon is highlighted in the Cool Switch box that
appears. Release both keys.
4. Choose Insert➪Object.
The Insert Object dialog box, shown in Figure 6-18, appears with the
Create from File radio button selected.
5. Click the Create from File radio button and then click Browse.
The Browse dialog box appears.
Figure 6-18:

167
Chapter 6: Getting the Word

6. Navigate to (and select) the Microsoft Excel file you want to insert into
your publication and then click Open.
You return to the Insert Object dialog box.
7. Click OK to insert the Microsoft Excel worksheet into your publication.
Figure 6-19 shows an example of an Excel worksheet inserted into a 
publication.
The Excel worksheet you insert into your publication isn’t really a table. I
know: If it looks like a duck, waddles like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it
must be a duck. Well, in Publisher, it isn’t a duck, er, table. It’s an object. If
you select the newly inserted Excel worksheet and choose Table from the
main menu, you notice that none of the Table commands is available.
Editing an Excel worksheet in Publisher
So you create a jazzy-looking worksheet in Microsoft Excel, save it to your
hard drive, and import it into Publisher. That’s great — until you realize 
that you spelled your company’s name incorrectly. Do you have to launch
Microsoft Excel, open the worksheet, correct the spelling of the company
name, save the worksheet, and import it into Publisher again? Yes.
Figure 6-19:

Okay, just kidding. You don’t have to do that. Just double-click the worksheet
to launch Microsoft Excel inside Publisher. Although the title bar still proclaims
that you’re in Publisher, the menu bar and toolbars change to those belong-
ing to Microsoft Excel. (See Figure 6-20.) In fact, because I created the sample
worksheet in Microsoft Excel 2007, when I edit the worksheet, the Publisher
menus and toolbars are replaced by the fancy new Excel 2007 Ribbon! Edit
the worksheet as you would edit in it Excel. When you finish making changes,
just click anywhere outside the worksheet. That’s all there is to it!
Accessing tables in Access
If you’re a database diehard who’s wondering whether you can use your
Microsoft Access tables in your publications, the answer is Yes. You can even
use your Microsoft Access query results. Essentially, you have two options
for getting data from your Access tables and query results into Publisher. 
You can import the entire table (or query results), or you can select part of
the table (or query results) to bring into Publisher.
Figure 6-20:

Chapter 6: Getting the Word

Follow these steps to import an entire table or query results:
1. In Microsoft Access, open the database that contains the table or
query you want to use in your publication.
2. Click the Tables button in the Objects pane of the Database window.
To import the results from a query, click the Queries button in the
Objects pane of the Database window.
3. Select a table or query and then click the Copy button on the
Standard toolbar. If you’re using Access 2007, click the Copy button in
the Clipboard section of the Home tab.
4. Switch to the Publisher window by clicking its button on the Windows
taskbar.
If the Windows taskbar isn’t visible, you can switch applications by press-
ing Alt+Tab. Hold down the Alt key and press Tab until the Microsoft
Publisher 2007 icon is highlighted in the Cool Switch box that appears.
Release both keys.
5. In the Publisher window, choose Edit➪Paste, press Ctrl+V, or click the
Paste button on the Standard toolbar.
Publisher creates a new table containing the records from your
Microsoft Access table or query.
Publisher creates an honest-to-goodness table from your Access table or
query. Format the table just as you would format any other Publisher table.
After pasting the table into Publisher, resize the table to your liking.
If you want to use only a portion of the records in your Microsoft Access

f you use a word processing or similar computer program, you know 
that editing (making changes to) text can be a breeze. Delete a word here,
insert a couple words there, rewrite a sentence, add a comma, and the pro-
gram takes care of the rest. The ease with which you can edit text in a com-
puter program is one of the reasons that typewriters are choking landfills
worldwide. My typewriter hasn’t seen the light of day in years. I keep it just
so I can say that I have one.
Editing text in Publisher is easy, too. Almost everything you know about edit-
ing text in a word processor applies to editing and formatting text in Publisher.
Although, admittedly, Publisher doesn’t have quite the editing muscle and
sophistication of some full-blown, word processing programs, it still does a
very respectable job.
Publisher is also more than a match for the formatting tools you find in any
word processor. Its many text-formatting features enable you to take control
of how your text looks, character by character, paragraph by paragraph, text
box by text box. You control the horizontal; you control the vertical.
This chapter focuses on editing and formatting text in Publisher. It focuses
specifically on working with text in text boxes, but you can use most of the
techniques shown here to work with text in table frames as well.

Tricks of the Editing Meisters
You’re probably an editing master already. If you’ve been banging away at a
word processor for a while, chances are that this section is a review for you.
In case it’s not, I want to mention some tricks you can use to edit text in a
text box.
To edit text, you first must position the insertion point in the text or highlight
(select) the text. If you position the insertion point in the text, you can press
Delete to remove any characters to the right of the insertion point or press
Backspace to remove characters to the left. You can place the insertion point
anywhere in a text box; when you do, Publisher also selects the text box 
for you.
If you select (highlight) text, any character you type replaces the highlighted
text. This process works the same way in Publisher as it does in other
Microsoft Office products. Be careful when selecting text: If you accidentally
replace some text, press Ctrl+Z right away to undo your last action. (Have I
mentioned backing up lately?)
If you haven’t purchased Microsoft Publisher 2007 yet, save yourself some
money and buy Microsoft Office Small Business 2007. In addition to buying
Publisher, you get these Microsoft applications:
 Microsoft Office Word 2007
 Microsoft Office Excel 2007
 Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007
 Microsoft Outlook 2007 with Business Contact Manager
 Microsoft Office Accounting Express 2007
Movin’ and groovin’
If you’re familiar with keys that move your insertion point in Microsoft Word,
you find that they all work inside Publisher. You can also reposition the inser-
tion point by using your keyboard’s movement keys: Home, End, PgUp, PgDn,
and the four arrow keys.
Some keyboards offer a separate bank of navigation keys, and some keyboards
place them on the numeric keypad, at the right end of the keyboard. To use
the keys on the numeric keypad as navigation keys, you must first turn off the
Num Lock key on the keyboard. If the Num Lock key is turned on, the keys 
display numbers rather than move your insertion point. Figure 7-1 shows an
ergonomic-style, 101-key computer keyboard.
172
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

Table 7-1 lists some common movement keys and describes what they do.
Notice that only the numbers on the numeric keypad (not on the main key-
board) move the insertion point. Turn off Num Lock on the keypad before
using these keys to navigate.

tion point at the beginning or end of the text and then removes the highlight-
ing (deselects the text).

Selection tricks
As I mention earlier in this chapter, before you can edit or format a piece of
text, you must highlight (select) it. The simplest way to highlight text is to
select the Select Objects tool in the toolbox and then drag the cursor over
the text you want to highlight. You also have a couple other choices for high-
lighting text:
 Double-click a word to select the word and any blank spaces following it.
 Click at one end of the text you want to highlight, press and hold down
the Shift key, click at the other end of the text, and then release the 
Shift key.
 Combine the Shift key with any of the movement techniques listed in the
preceding section. For example, to select an entire line of text, move 
the insertion point to the beginning of the line and then press Shift+End.
 Choose Edit➪Select All or press Ctrl+A (for all) to highlight all text in the
current text box and in any connected text boxes.
You can also use the Shift key in combination with clicking or any movement
technique to extend or reduce an existing highlight.
Drag and drop
Previous chapters in this book illustrate the use of the Cut, Copy, and Paste
commands in several different applications. The cut/copy/paste technique is
one of two ways to move text in text boxes. The other is drag and drop, which
sounds like a training seminar for airport baggage handlers. By using drag-
and-drop text editing, you can move and copy text within and between text
boxes located on any single page or two-page spread without following all the
steps of using the Windows Clipboard. I think of it as a direct form of cut and
paste (or copy and paste, if you hold down the Ctrl key as you drag and
drop).
To remove text from one spot and place it in another by using drag and drop,
first highlight the text. After you complete that task, click the highlighted text
and drag it to a new location. As soon as you release the mouse button, the
text is dropped into its new location.
In previous versions of Publisher, the insertion pointer turned into a T with
the word Drag next to it as soon as you moved it over your selected text —
indicating that you were set to drag and drop. Publisher doesn’t provide this
little visual clue. The best that you get is a little box that appears under the
arrow pointer when you click the selected text.
174
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

To copy text by using drag-and-drop, highlight the text you want to copy, press
Ctrl, and then click and drag the selection to a new location. A small plus sign
(+) shows up next to the arrow pointer, to indicate that you can now drag and
drop and copy the selected text.
If the insertion point doesn’t change to an arrow pointer when you place it
over selected text, you may have turned off drag-and-drop text editing,
although for the life of me I can’t think of why you would want to do that. I
love drag and drop. The Drag-and-Drop Text Editing check box on the Edit 
tab of the Options dialog box (it’s on the Tools menu) disables this feature
(which is turned on by default) in all your publications.
Drag-and-drop text editing isn’t for everyone. My daughter, Becca (she
prefers Warrior Princess), insists that the mouse pointer should turn into a
dragon pointer when performing this mystical feat. Still, if you’re mouse chal-
lenged, you might want to skip this feature.
Symbols
A big mistake that many new desktop publishers make is failing to use those
special typographic characters that are known in Publisher as symbols. If you
look carefully at this book, or any other well-produced publication, you can
see symbols all over the place. These special symbols, which include frac-
tions (such as 1⁄4); special quotation marks (" "); special hyphens, such as en
dashes (–) and em dashes (—); ligatures (Æ, œ, æ); and so on are a typogra-
pher’s stock-in-trade.
Publisher provides two ways to put appropriate typographical symbols in
your publications: automatically and manually. As you type, Publisher auto-
matically replaces inch and foot marks (" and '), also known as straight quotes,
with typographic quotation marks (“ ”, and ‘ ’), and double hyphens (- -) with
em dashes (—). (Typographic quotation marks are often called smart quotes
or curly quotes.) If you import text, punctuation marks in that text remain as
they were in your source document.
If Publisher doesn’t replace these marks for you as you type, you probably
turned off Publisher’s autoformatting features. Choose Tools➪AutoCorrect
Options and click the AutoFormat as You Type tab of the AutoCorrect dialog
box that appears. In the Replace as You Type area, select the Straight Quotes
with Smart Quotes check box and the Hyphens (-, -) with dash (—) check 
box to turn on these settings. They apply to all your Publisher sessions.
If you like to import text into Publisher from another word processing program,
try to set up that program so that it automatically replaces the text you type
with the appropriate typographical symbols. Microsoft Word offers this feature,
for example. Otherwise, you must search and replace the marks manually by
either choosing the Edit➪Replace command from the menu or pressing Ctrl+H.
175
Chapter 7: Editors Are Bought, Not Born

What if you want to type an inch mark or a foot mark? You must turn off the
Replace Straight Quotes with Smart Quotes option for a moment and then
type the inch or foot mark. Don’t forget to turn on the option again.
To insert a symbol manually into a publication, choose Insert➪Symbol and
make your selection from the Symbol dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-2.
The Symbol dialog box shows you all available symbols in your installed
system fonts. The current font appears, but you can switch to other fonts —
including Symbol. As you make your way through the various font sets, you
find en dashes, fractions, copyright and registration marks, foreign letters
and currency symbols, smiley faces, hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades, and
even the é you need in order to type résumé correctly. Many of the most com-
monly used symbols are on the Special Characters tab of the Symbols dialog
box. If you’re looking for a special symbol, check out the Symbol font by
selecting it from the Font list box. The Wingdings font is also a rich source 
of symbols, such as bullets, buttons, and bows.
Don’t bother to insert symbols one at a time to create bulleted lists like the
ones you see in this book. Instead, use the Bulleted or Numbered List feature
in Publisher to create this special format. Bulleted and numbered lists are
discussed later in this chapter, in the section “The Formatting toolbar.”

Tools of the Editing Meisters
Any good page-layout program comes with a set of basic text management
tools. Some of the heavyweight programs come with tools for formatting, 
text correction, seek and destroy, and other features that any word processor
would envy. These tools are important; they increase accuracy and make
your text more readable.
Publisher offers these tools:
 Search and replace
 A spell checker (including spell checking as you type)
 AutoCorrect
 Automatic hyphenation
Additionally, the Publisher Tools menu offers some other tools that aren’t
specific to text management. The Design Checker command looks at your
document for common printing problems, and the Design Gallery contains
such Publisher-designed objects as pull quotes, logos, calendars, and more
that you can use in your publication. I discuss the Design Gallery and Design
Checker in Chapters 9 and 12, respectively. The sections that follow examine
the text tools.
Hide and seek: Find and Replace
Any good word processor has a Find feature, a command that enables you 
to hunt down a specific word or phrase in your document. Okay, even poor
word processors have a Find feature. Publisher has a Find feature and even a
Replace feature, which enables you to search and replace one word or phrase
with another. If you need to correct text at story length, you just can’t get 
by without these Search and Replace features.
Here’s how to find text:
1. Select a text box in the story you want Publisher to search.
Before finding and replacing text, press F9 to view your text at a readable
size.
2. Choose Edit➪Find or press Ctrl+F.
The initial Find and Replace task pane, shown in Figure 7-3, appears.
177
Chapter 7: Editors Are Bought, Not Born

3. In the Find What text box, type the text you want Publisher to find,
using wildcard symbols, if you want.
If you ever worked in MS-DOS, you probably know about wildcards. One
wildcard, the question mark (?), works in the Find and Replace task
pane. If you use a question mark in your search criteria, any character
can be a match for the character in the question mark position. For exam-
ple, if you ask Publisher to search for the text no?, it finds the words not,
now, nod, and others. If you need to search for an actual question mark,
type a caret (^) before the mark, as in ^?. To find a caret, ask a rabet. No,
that’s not right. To find a caret, type ^^. Table 7-2 (appearing shortly)
lists codes you can use to find other special characters.
4. Select the Match Whole Word Only check box or the Match Case check
box, or both, if you want those options.
The Match Whole Word Only option finds any occurrence of your search
string that’s surrounded by spaces or punctuation marks. This option
ignores any matches that are part of larger words. With the option
selected, a search for publish, for example, ignores the word publisher.
The Match Case option searches your document for an exact match of
your search string’s characters, using upper- and lowercase characters
as filtering criteria. With this option selected and the Match Whole Word
Only option deselected, for example, a search for the word publish ignores
any occurrence of Publisher; a search for the word Publish, however, finds
Publisher.
Figure 7-3:
The Find
and Replace
task pane.
178
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

5. Select All, Up or Down in the Search drop-down list box to specify the
direction of the search.
If you choose the Up option, Publisher searches from the location of the
cursor upward to the beginning of the text box or story. If you choose
the Down option, it searches from the cursor location to the end of the
text box or story. If you choose the All option, Publisher searches the
entire publication.
6. Click the Find Next button.
Publisher scampers off to look for your text, and one of three things 
happens:
• The exact text you wanted is found and highlighted.
• Publisher finds an occurrence of your text but not the one you were
looking for. Click the Find Next button to continue the search.
• Publisher reaches the beginning or end of the text without a match
and opens a message box asking permission to continue looking
through the rest of the publication (including master pages). Click
Yes if you want to continue looking. If Publisher then searches the
entire story and comes up empty, it displays a message box saying
that no matching text was found. Sorry!
7. Click the Close button in the task pane to make the task pane run and
hide when you finish searching.
If you have used Microsoft Word, all this finding and replacing may look famil-
iar to you. The Find and Replace procedures work essentially the same way
in Publisher as they do in Word.
Publisher can’t find text in a WordArt frame.
Publisher can’t find the TV remote, your car keys, or your cellphone, either.
Sometimes, you may want to search for special characters, such as an end-of-
paragraph mark or a tab space. You can do so by entering the codes listed in
Table 7-2 into the Find What text box.

Having Publisher help you find text is helpful, but getting the program to
replace unwanted text is an even bigger labor-saving device. To find 
and replace text, choose the Edit➪Replace command. Here’s how:
1. Select the story containing the text you want Publisher to replace.
2. Choose Edit➪Replace or press Ctrl+H.
The Find and Replace task pane appears with the Replace radio button
selected (see Figure 7-4). It’s the same Find and Replace operation you
see taking place in Figure 7-3; the program remembers the last text you
typed in the Find What box during your current Publisher session.
3. Type the text you want to find in the Find What text box, and the text
you want to replace it with in the Replace With text box. Then specify
the Search option.
Publisher searches in only two directions while running Find and
Replace: Down and All. In this way, it’s different from the Find feature.
You can also set the same Match options described in the preceding set
of steps.
4. Click Find Next.
One of three things happens:
• A match is found. To replace the found text, click the Replace
button. Publisher then searches for the next occurrence of the text
specified in the Find What text box.
• A match is found but not the one you want. Click the Find Next
button to continue the search.
• Publisher reaches the end of the text without finding a match, so it
displays a message box asking whether to continue searching the rest
of the publication (including master pages). Click the Yes button to
180
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

continue the search, or click No to end the search. If Publisher still
can’t find your text, it displays a message saying that it has fin-
ished searching.
5. Click the Close button in the task pane to make the task pane disap-
pear when you finish searching and replacing.
If you click the Replace All button, Publisher replaces all occurrences of the
matching text with your replacement text in one fell swoop. Take care when
using the Replace All button: Unless you’re careful, you may replace matches
that you didn’t intend to change. Mistakes are hard to catch in large stories.
The Replace command is an excellent way to repair text that wasn’t prepared
in the correct typographical way. For example, you can use the Replace com-
mand to replace all double spaces with single spaces. You can also replace
other characters, such as double dashes and old-fashioned fractions, with
their correct typographic counterparts. Use the Symbol dialog box (refer to
Figure 7-2) to insert the correct symbol into your text. Cut or copy the symbol
to the Clipboard, choose the Edit➪Replace command, and type the old-
fashioned mark that you want to replace in the Find What text box. Then click
the Replace With text box and press Ctrl+V to insert the symbol there. The
symbol may appear as a bizarre shape totally unrelated to what you copied
from the publication, but don’t pay any attention to it. The symbol appears
correctly again after it’s back in the publication.
Figure 7-4:
The Find
and Replace
task pane

Replace
radio button

181
Chapter 7: Editors Are Bought, Not Born

Now you’re ready to replace at will. Just to be safe, however, always test your
replacement text by replacing a single match before using the Replace All
button to apply the replace universally.
Can you check my spelling?
There’s no doubt about it: Spalling errors make you look bad. To begin check-
ing your spelling, select a text box and then choose Tools➪Spelling➪Spelling
or press F7. Publisher immediately searches for the first word that it doesn’t
recognize; if it finds one, the Check Spelling dialog box, shown in Figure 7-5,
appears. Publisher places that word in the Not in Dictionary text box. You
can correct the word in the Change To text box, and the spell checker even
suggests close matches in the Suggestions list box.
Publisher can’t check spelling in WordArt frames.
The spell checker is one of those “shared tools” in the Microsoft arsenal.
(Know one, know them all.) Like other Microsoft programs with spell check-
ing capabilities, Publisher doesn’t find misspelled words per se: It compares
every word it comes across against its own 100,000-word electronic dic-
tionary. It considers any characters that appear between two spaces or 
similar delimiting characters to be a word. If a word doesn’t match, Publisher
points it out. That’s why the dialog box has a Not in Dictionary text box
rather than a Misspelled Word text box.
You have several choices for dealing with each word that Publisher flags:
 If the word is incorrect and you can find the correct word in the
Suggestions list box: Double-click the correct word.
Alternatively, you can single-click the correct word and then click
Change All to have Publisher automatically fix every occurrence of the
incorrect word as it finds it.
Figure 7-5:
The Check
Spelling
dialog box.
182
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

 If the word is incorrect and you can’t find the correct word in the
Suggestions list box: Enter the correct word in the Change To text box
and then click the Change or Change All button.
 If the word is correct but it’s not a word you use often: Click the Ignore
button to leave the word as is. Or, click Ignore All to leave every occur-
rence of the word that Publisher finds in this particular spelling check 
as is.
 If the word is correct and it’s a word you use often (such as your own
name): Click the Add button to add the word to the Publisher dictionary.
Be careful with this button, though, because if you add an incorrect
word to the dictionary, Publisher never points out the word again, in
this or any other publication!
After you tell Publisher what to do with the first word, the spell checker con-
tinues until it reaches the end of your highlighted text or the end of the story.
Publisher then asks whether you want to continue checking the rest of the
current story. If you have more than one story in your publication, Publisher
checks the current story first and then asks whether you want to check the
next story (unless the Check All Stories check box is selected, in which case
Publisher goes ahead and checks every story without asking).
Publisher checks spelling as relentlessly as my editor does. Eventually, though,
it runs out of words to check and displays a dialog box telling you that it 
has finished checking your spelling. Click OK to close the Check Spelling
dialog box.
If you typed a word but aren’t sure whether you spelled it correctly, double-
click the word and press F7. If Spell Check recognizes the word, a message
box says that the spelling check is complete. If Spell Check doesn’t recognize
the word, the Check Spelling dialog box appears and offers alternative
spellings. You can also right-click the word in question. Several alternative
spellings appear at the top of the context menu.
What are those squiggly red lines in the text box? Publisher can check your
spelling as you type. When you misspell a word, it’s marked by a squiggly 
red underline to let you know that you made a boo-boo. Choose
Tools➪Spelling➪Spelling Options and click to select the Check Spelling 
As You Type option. (This option is selected by default.)
A spell checker isn’t a substitute for proofreading. Don’t believe me? Ask my
editor. Just because all the words are spelled correctly doesn’t mean that
they’re the correct words. Did you know that spalling (which I misspelled for
spelling a couple of pages ago) is a real word? In case this is news to you (it
was to me), it means “to break up or reduce by chipping with a hammer” as
in “I’ll be out in the garage spalling the old computers, Honey. . . .”
183
Chapter 7: Editors Are Bought, Not Born

Hyphenation
To fit more text in a given space or to make justified text easier to read, you
can have Publisher hyphenate your text, by automatically breaking words in
two at line endings. This process is automated, so Publisher continually
removes and adds hyphens as needed as you type, edit, and rearrange text.
To have Publisher hyphenate your text automatically, follow these steps:
1. Select the text frame or story that you want to hyphenate.
2. Choose Tools➪Language➪Hyphenation or press Ctrl+Shift+H.
The Hyphenation dialog box, shown in Figure 7-6, appears.
3. Verify that the Automatically Hyphenate This Story check box is
selected and then click the OK button.
Your text is now hyphenated. If you later change the text in any way, Publisher
automatically re-hyphenates the text.
If you don’t trust Publisher to hyphenate your text for you or if you want to
manually control where a hyphen in a word occurs, you can click the Manual
button in the Hyphenation dialog box. Then, when Publisher finds a word
appropriate for hyphenating, it shows you that word and how it wants to
hyphenate it. You can either approve, modify, or reject the hyphenation. 
If you use this option, though, Publisher doesn’t re-hyphenate your text 
for you; you have to issue the Hyphenation command again.
Another control you have in adjusting hyphenation is the setting in the
Hyphenation Zone text box. The smaller the hyphenation zone, the more
hyphens Publisher uses and the more even the right edge of your text is.
To remove automatic hyphenation, choose the Tools➪Language➪Hyphenation
command again. Click the Automatically Hyphenate This Story check box to
deselect the option.
You can set up Publisher to hyphenate all text by default: Choose Tools➪
Options and click the Edit tab. Select the Automatically Hyphenate in New
Text Boxes check box if it’s not already selected (it’s selected by default), and
then change the setting in the Hyphenation Zone text box, if you want. For
any text box you now create in any publication, Publisher automatically
Figure 7-6:
The
Hyphenation
dialog box.
184
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

hyphenates the frame’s text. Publisher doesn’t change the hyphenation in
any existing text boxes, however.
Text Formatting
If you’ve worked in a word processor, you’ve formatted your share of text.
Perhaps you’re a text formatting meister. Even so, you may learn a trick or
two in the sections that follow. If you don’t, reward yourself with three gold
asterisks and move on down the line.
Modern word processors and page layout programs divide the formatting
that you can apply to text into three formatting levels:
 Character: You can apply this type of format to each character in your
text: type styles, fonts, sizes, and cases, for example.
 Paragraph: This default format applies to paragraphs. Some formats,
such as styles, you may be able to change. Others, such as line spacing,
may not be changed, depending on the program you’re using.
 Document: This type of format usually applies to the entire document.
Page margins are an example of a document format. Because Publisher
treats stories as though they’re documents, document formats apply to
text boxes and to connected text boxes with a story in them.
If you understand which formats belong to which category, you can quickly
apply the format you want in order to get professional results — and often
with dramatic time savings.
The Formatting toolbar
After you select a chunk of text, a Formatting toolbar appropriate to text for-
matting appears under the Standard toolbar. Figure 7-7 shows the Formatting
toolbar for text. Most of the toolbar elements should be familiar to you if you
have worked in a word processor.
This list describes the formatting options on the toolbar, from left to right:
Figure 7-7:
The
Formatting
toolbar.
185
Chapter 7: Editors Are Bought, Not Born

 Style list box: Enables you to choose a style and apply it to your selection.
A style is a set of formats that apply to a paragraph, as explained later in
this chapter.
 Font list box: Shows the current font and enables you to select a 
different one.
 Font Size list box: Displays the current font size and enables you to enter
a new one.
 Bold, Italic, and Underline buttons: Set the font style.
 Align Left, Center, Align Right, and Justify buttons: Apply text justifica-
tion, which is a paragraph-level setting.
 Line Spacing button: Controls the spacing between lines.
 Numbering button: Accesses a paragraph-level setting that enables you
to automatically number your paragraphs. (Great for creating numbered
Steps lists!)
 Bullets button: Applies a paragraph-level setting that enables you to
automatically place bullets at the beginning of paragraphs. (The Bullet
List look.)
 Decrease Indent button: Moves the selected paragraph to the previous
tab stop.
 Increase Indent button: Moves the selected paragraph to the next tab
stop.
 Decrease Font Size button: Changes the selected text to the next smaller
font size listed in the Font Size list box.
 Increase Font Size button: Changes the selected text to the next larger
font size listed in the Font Size list box.
 Fill Color button: Applies color to the background of a text frame.
 Line Color button: Opens the Color Selector pop-up menu, which enables
you to change the color of the selected line.
 Font Color button: Opens the Color Selector pop-up menu, which enables
you to change the font color of selected text.
 Line/Border Style button: Enables you to place borders around text
frames.
 Dash Style: Lets you choose the type of dashed line.
 Arrow Style: Allows you to choose the type of arrow.
 Shadow Style: Allows you to choose a shadow for the text box.
 3-D Style: Lets you choose a 3D style for the text box.
You must realize that the toolbar offers only highlights of what’s possible
format-wise. Many of the Format menu commands that the buttons duplicate
186
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

open dialog boxes containing lots of additional options. Still, the buttons are
a convenient, quick way to apply basic formatting.
Character formatting
Character formatting enables you to change the appearance of individual
characters. Character formatting is most often used for emphasis, to set text
apart from the text surrounding it. For example, words are often italicized to
make them stand out in a block of plain text.
One confusing aspect of text formatting is that you can format the text in
your paragraphs at the paragraph level and also format individual characters
in that paragraph any way you want. You can think of paragraph formatting
as a default format that you can override as needed.
Character formatting can make your text look great, but for even fancier text,
try out WordArt, as described in Chapter 8.
Choosing a font
Perhaps the most noticeable character format is the font of your text. The font
(or typeface) determines each character’s basic shape. Microsoft Windows
and Publisher together offer you lots of fonts. Text always uses one font or
another; by default, it’s Times New Roman. Some fonts, such as Vacation MT,
Webdings, and Wingdings, are symbol fonts and aren’t used for regular text.
As though the fonts that come with Publisher and Windows weren’t enough,
even more might be available to you: Other Windows programs might have
installed additional fonts on your computer, and your printer might have its
own set of built-in fonts. If you become a raving font addict, rest assured that
you can buy and install even more fonts.
As Roger C. Parker says in Desktop Publishing & Design For Dummies (Wiley
Publishing): “He who dies with the most fonts wins.”
Choose one of these two methods to change the font for selected text:
 Select the font name from the Font list box on the toolbar.
 Choose Format➪Font to open the Font dialog box, shown in Figure 7-8.
Click the font name in the Font list box.
If no font name appears in the Font box, you probably highlighted text
that’s formatted with more than one font. You can still use the Font list
box to apply the font you want.
187
Chapter 7: Editors Are Bought, Not Born

Press Ctrl+Shift+F to highlight the font in the Font list box and activate the
list box. Then press the up- or down-arrow keys to move to the font you 
want. Press Enter to select the highlighted font.
When you open the Font box’s drop-down list, you see an icon next to each
font name. The two Ts icon indicates that the font is a TrueType font, an out-
line font that any Windows program can use. The little printer icon indicates
that the font is a printer font, built in to the current publication’s target printer.
No symbol means that the font is a system font, one that Windows itself uses
to label windows, dialog boxes, and options, and other elements.
TrueType is generally the most hassle-free font type to use, but you may want
to go with printer fonts if you’re having a print service print your publication
printed. Many print services use Postscript fonts that require printer 
descriptions.
Note that if you do use printer fonts, those fonts may look bad on-screen.
Because Windows has only sketchy information about any given printer font,
your on-screen characters may be misshapen, and lines of text may appear
clipped off in certain views. Everything should look fine when you print your
publication, though. Chapter 8 explains fonts and typography in detail.
Changing the font size
There must be something about publishing professionals that makes using
standard English terms difficult for them. Even when they’re simply measur-
ing the size of text, they can’t stick with inches, centimeters, or any other
measurement that the rest of the world uses. Instead, they measure the height
Figure 7-8:
The Font
dialog box.
188
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

of text in points. A point is approximately 1⁄72 of an inch, and you can make text
any size from 0.5 point to 999.9 points, in 0.1-point increments. In inches,
those measurements translate from 1⁄14 inch to almost 14 inches high — that’s
quite a range! Unless you’re making banners, though, you probably will keep
your text somewhere between 6 and 72 points.
With typography, nothing is as simple as it seems. Even a standard point size
changes depending on the font that’s selected. These and other mysteries of
typographic life are explained in Chapter 8.
Choose one of these methods to change the size of selected text:
 Select the size from the Font Size list box on the toolbar or enter your
own size into the list box.
 Choose Format➪Font to open the Font dialog box (refer to Figure 7-8)
and enter the font size there.
If no font size appears in the Font dialog box’s Size list box, you probably
highlighted text formatted with more than one size. You can still use the 
Size list box to apply the size you want.
Press Ctrl+Shift+P to highlight the font size in the Font Size list box and acti-
vate the list box. Press the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the
font size, or type any size you want (between 0.5 and 999.9) and press Enter.
With TrueType fonts, you can enter any font size you want (in the allowed
range), even decimal numbers. Some printer fonts support only a limited set
of sizes, however. If you plan to use printer fonts, consult the printer’s docu-
mentation to see whether this limitation applies.
Applying a type style
The last important character format is type style, which Publisher refers to
as effects. If you want to make a word or two stand out, apply text effects
such as boldface, italics, or underlining. You can apply these effects to selected
text by using toolbar buttons or choosing options from the Font dialog box.
You can specify whether you want to underline all selected text or just indi-
vidual words and not the spaces between them. You can choose a double
underline, a wavy underline, or a dotted or dashed underline. Go ahead —
take a peek at the Underline list box in the Font dialog box. You can also create
superscript or subscript effects, all caps or small caps, or outline, shadow,
emboss, and engrave effects in the Font dialog box.
Here are some text-effect keyboard shortcuts — be sure that you know them
cold:
189

With the exception of Ctrl+spacebar, all these keyboard shortcuts are toggles:
Press the shortcut once to turn on the effect; press the shortcut a second
time to remove the effect.
As with font and font size, you can use either the toolbar buttons or the Font
dialog box (more generally) to make your type style selections. When you
select text to which the bold, italic, or underline effect has been applied, the
corresponding button on the toolbar has a pushed-in look. You can simulta-
neously select text that has one of these effects applied and text that does
not. When you do this, you may notice that the corresponding toolbar button
doesn’t have the pushed-in look. If you click the button once, you remove the
effect from all the highlighted text. Click again to apply the effect to all the
selected text.
Some fonts (not common Windows ones, though) don’t support boldface and
italics. For these fonts, the B (bold) and I (italic) buttons are useless. You can
click them all you want, but your text doesn’t change.
Getting the yearn to kern
If you’re really picky about how your text looks, you can even control the
amount of horizontal space between characters, either squishing text
together or spreading it apart. Publishing professionals call this effect kern-
ing. (Don’t confuse kerning with line spacing. Kerning controls the amount 
of horizontal spacing between characters, whereas line spacing controls the
vertical spacing between lines of text.)
By default, Publisher automatically kerns between relatively large 
characters — any text that’s 14 points or larger. To get Publisher to kern 
even smaller characters, choose the Format➪Character Spacing command
from the menu and change the setting in the Kern Text At scroll box. Publisher
then adjusts the spacing between letters based on a list of letter pairs that
are part of a font’s definition.
Publisher does a good job of automatic kerning, but if you have some specific
text that you want to kern manually, you have two choices, tracking or kern-
ing. First, choose Format➪Character Spacing from the menu. This command
opens the Character Spacing dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-9, where you
can adjust the spacing for large selections (Publisher calls it tracking) or fine-
tune the spacing between two characters (Publisher calls it kerning). Perfect
kerning is one of those power features that desktop publishers crave.
190
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

To quickly adjust the spacing of selected text, press Ctrl+Shift+[ to move
characters closer together or Ctrl+Shift+] to spread them apart.
Don’t bother spending much time kerning text in a smaller font. Kerning is
best done on large-font text, particularly headline text. Figure 7-10 shows 
you the difference between tight and loose kerning.
Paragraph formatting
Whereas character formatting enables you to control text one character at a
time, paragraph formatting controls entire paragraphs. Paragraph formatting
includes line spacing, alignment within a frame, tab stops, indents, and for-
matting text as bulleted or numbered lists.
You probably discovered in grade school that a paragraph is a group of sen-
tences that forms a complete thought. Well, forget it! In Publisher, regardless
of complete thoughts, a paragraph is anything that ends with a paragraph
mark (one of those special characters that you create every time you press
Figure 7-10:
Condensed
versus
expanded
kerning.
Figure 7-9:

Spacing
dialog box.
191
Chapter 7: Editors Are Bought, Not Born

the Enter key). Thus, if you type a three-line address and press Enter to begin
each new line, that address consists of three separate paragraphs. If you want,
you can format each of those paragraphs differently.
With character formatting, you must select all the text that you want to format.
But you don’t need to bother highlighting entire paragraphs to apply para-
graph formatting. To mark a single paragraph for paragraph formatting, just
click to place the insertion point anywhere in the paragraph or highlight text
anywhere in the paragraph. To mark multiple paragraphs for formatting, just
highlight some text in each of those paragraphs. Keep this in mind during the
next few sections whenever I tell you to mark a paragraph.
Here’s a weird tidbit: Publisher and word processors store in the paragraph
mark itself the paragraph format and any variation you apply to 
characters in that paragraph.
Adjusting line spacing
If you’ve done a decent amount of word processing, you know all about set-
ting line spacing within a paragraph — the old single-space-versus-double-
space dichotomy. You may not have known, however, that you can control
the amount of space that appears above and below each paragraph. This
option is important for making headings stand out and for many other 
purposes.
To change a paragraph's line spacing, follow these steps:
1. Select the paragraphs you want to affect, and then choose
Format➪Paragraph from the menu.
The Paragraph dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-11.
2. In the Line Spacing section of the dialog box, use the Before Paragraphs
drop-down list to specify the amount of space to appear before the
first line of each paragraph.
3. In the same section, use the After Paragraphs drop-down list to specify
the amount of space to appear before the last line of each paragraph.
The Sample box shows you the result of your settings.
4. (Optional) Specify the line spacing within a paragraph by using the
Between Lines drop-down list in the Line Spacing section of the
Paragraph dialog box.
Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+1 for single-spaced text; Ctrl+2 for
double-spaced; Ctrl+5 for 11⁄2 line space; and Ctrl+0 (zero) to remove 
the space before a paragraph.
192
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

It’s considered good typographical practice to set line spacing rather than
insert additional paragraph marks to create spacing. Then, if you decide to
change the spacing between the paragraphs later, you need to work with the
attributes of only the paragraphs that contain your content. You don’t need
to add or delete paragraphs you use as space holders.
You can specify any and all line spacing settings in terms of these 
measurements:
 in: Inches
 cm: Centimeters
 pt: Points
 pi: Picas
 sp: A special Publisher space measurement
One space in Publisher always equals 120 percent of the current text size —
an ideal size-to-spacing ratio for single spacing. If you use the sp measure-
ment (1 sp for single-spacing, 2 sp for double spacing, and so on), the line
spacing changes as the text size changes. If you use any other measurement,
the line spacing remains the same when you enlarge or reduce your text size,
even if the result is wildly squished or spaced-out text lines.
Figure 7-11:
Setting line
spacing 
in the
Paragraph
dialog box.
193
Chapter 7: Editors Are Bought, Not Born

You can enter any of the measurement units just listed into the Line Spacing
text boxes in the Paragraph dialog box. Publisher automatically converts the
units (except for the sp unit) to the default measurement units. You set the
default measurement unit in the Options dialog on the Tools menu.
Setting paragraph alignment
By default, Publisher lines up paragraphs along the left edge of the text frame
that holds them. Text aligned in this manner is said by typographers to be
ragged right, or left justified. To push text instead to the right edge (ragged left,
or right justified), to center it between the edges (fully ragged), or to stretch it
from edge to edge (fully justified), you change its alignment, also called justifi-
cation in publishing lingo.
Here are some ways to set paragraph alignment for selected paragraphs:
 The easiest way is to click one of the four alignment icons on the
Formatting toolbar (from left to right across the toolbar): Align Text 
Left, Center, Align Text Right, or Justify.
 Use the following keystrokes: Ctrl+L for left justified; Ctrl+R for right 
justified; Ctrl+E for center (think even!); or Ctrl+J for fully justified. 
Press Ctrl+Q to return your paragraph to the default format.
 Use the Alignment drop-down list on the Indents and Spacing tab of the
Paragraph dialog box.
Justified text can stretch your text out so far that it’s difficult to read. To
remedy this, try hyphenating the text, as described earlier in this chapter, 
in the “Hyphenation” section.
The justification, hyphenation, line spacing, and other paragraph-level for-
mats you use are important determinants in how your publication looks.
They “color” your text and make it either more or less readable. A full expla-
nation of this topic would require more space than I have available in this
book, but you should try to take the time to visit the style guides that I rec-
ommend at the end of Chapter 2. See Chapter 12 too, for more information 
on hyphenating and justifying text.
Setting tab stops
When you press the Tab key in a text box, Publisher inserts a tab mark. How
this special character affects the text following it depends on the tab stops
that are set for the paragraph.
By default, left-aligned tab stops are set every half-inch on the horizontal ruler.
(When you’re working in a text box, a special subsection of the horizontal
ruler measures distances from the frame’s left edge.) Thus, each tab mark
you create usually causes the text following the mark to left-align with the
194
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

next available half-inch mark. For example, if your text is 11⁄4 inch from the left
edge of a frame and you insert a tab mark before that text, the text left-aligns
with the 11⁄2-inch ruler mark.
By setting your own, custom tab stops, however, you can align tab marks in a
number of other ways. Publisher supports four different kinds of tab stops:
 Left: This setting is the default, and a tab moves text to the right of the
tab mark so that it aligns flush left to the tab stop.
 Center: A tab moves text so that it aligns centered on the tab stop.
 Right: A tab moves text so that it aligns flush right to the tab stop.
 Decimal: A tab moves text so that any decimal point aligns to the tab
stop. This tab is useful for aligning numeric data in tables.
You can quickly set a tab stop for selected paragraph (or paragraphs) by
clicking the Move Both Rulers button at the intersection of the two rulers
until the type of tab that you want appears. Then click the spot on the hori-
zontal ruler where you want the tab to be placed. To remove a tab stop you
set, simply drag it from the horizontal ruler.
Sometimes, you might want to use a tab leader, a set of characters that fill
any gap created by a tab mark. Publisher offers dots, dashes, lines, and bul-
lets as leaders. Dotted tab leaders are commonly used with right-aligned tab
stops in tables of contents (such as at the beginning of this book). The dots
connect the titles on the left with the page numbers on the right. In that case,
you need to set tabs by using the Tabs dialog box, as explained in these steps:
1. Select the paragraphs you want to affect.
2. Choose Format➪Tabs.
The Tabs dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-12.
If you know exactly where you want to place a tab, double-click the ruler
at that location. A tab stop is inserted, and the Tabs dialog box opens.
Figure 7-12:
The Tabs
dialog box.
195
Chapter 7: Editors Are Bought, Not Born

3. In the Tab Stop Position list box, specify a position for the tab stop in
the upper text field.
You can type any of the units of measurement that Publisher accepts in
the Tab Stop Position list box: inches, centimeters, picas, points, or pixels.
Publisher automatically converts the units to the current default mea-
surement units. (You set the default measurement unit on the Tools
menu in the Options dialog box.)
This position is the distance between the left edge of the text box and
the tab stop.
4. In the Alignment section, choose how you want text to align to your
tab stop.
5. (Optional) Set a tab leader.
6. Click the Set button.
Your tab-stop position now appears in the lower section of the Tab Stop
Position list box.
7. (Optional) Set additional tabs by repeating Steps 3 through 6.
8. Click the OK button.
After you set custom tab stops, the horizontal ruler displays those stops,
using symbols for the four kinds of tab stops. If you’re fairly adept with the
mouse, you can fine-tune the position of a tab stop by dragging it back and
forth on the ruler. Be careful to point directly to the tab stop you want to
move, however, or you might accidentally create a new stop.
Here are some helpful shortcuts for working with tab stops:
 To delete a tab stop: Drag it down and off the horizontal ruler. Or, use
the Clear and Clear All buttons in the Tabs dialog box.
Notice that the Tabs dialog box provides an option for changing the
Default tab stops from every half-inch to any other increment you like.
 To modify the alignment or leader of an existing tab stop: Open the
Tabs dialog box and click to select the stop you want to change in the
Tab Stop Position list box. Then set the alignment or leader (or both),
click Set, and click OK.
Remember that tab stops are paragraph specific. If you click or highlight text
in another paragraph, the horizontal ruler displays in that new paragraph any
custom tab stops that are set. If the tab stops on the horizontal ruler are gray,
you probably highlighted text in multiple paragraphs that use different tab
stops.
Tab stops can be a pain. If you get frustrated from working with them, remem-
ber that just about anything you can accomplish with tab stops, you can often
more easily accomplish with indents, table frames, and multiple text boxes.
196
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

Setting paragraph indents
Indents are like margins that affect only individual paragraphs. By default, all
indents are set to 0, which makes paragraphs align with the text box margins.
By increasing the indent setting, you can move paragraphs in from those 
margins.
If you want to move every line of text in a text box, you needn’t bother with
indents. Instead, just resize or move the text box.
To set indents, follow these steps:
1. Mark the paragraphs you want to affect.
2. Choose Format➪Paragraph from the menu.
The Paragraph dialog box opens. (Refer to Figure 7-11.)
3. In the Indentation section of the dialog box, choose the type of indent
you want from the Preset drop-down list.
• Flush Left: Aligns the entire paragraph with the left margin
• 1st Line Indent: Indents the first line of the paragraph by 1⁄4 inch
• Hanging Indent: Indents all lines except the first line of a paragraph
by 1⁄4 inch
• Quotation: Justifies the text so that it’s formatted into a block
quote
• Custom Indent: Allows you to create your own indent style
4. (Optional) Use the Left, First Line, and Right options to fine-tune the
preset indent.
The Left option indents the left edge of every paragraph line; First Line
indents the left edge of just the first paragraph line; and Right indents
the right edge of every paragraph line.
The Sample box shows the effect of your choices.
5. Click OK.
After you set custom indents, indent markers — those little black triangles on
the horizontal ruler — move to reflect the indenting. If you want, you can
change the indents by dragging the indent markers back and forth:
 The upper-left indent marker: Controls the left edge of the first line in
the paragraph
 The lower-left marker: Controls the left edge of every line in the para-
graph except for the first line
197
Chapter 7: Editors Are Bought, Not Born

 The right indent marker: Controls the right edge of every line in the
paragraph
 The rectangle under the lower-left marker: Controls both the first line
and left indents
Be careful to point the cursor directly at the indent marker you want to
move, however, or you might accidentally create a tab stop. If the indent
markers on the horizontal ruler are gray, you probably highlighted text in
multiple paragraphs that use different indents. You can still use the markers
to adjust your indents.
It’s considered good typographical practice to use a first-line indent rather
than tab marks to indent the first lines of paragraphs.
As an example of how indents are used, consider the hanging indent, as
shown in Figure 7-13. You create a hanging indent by setting the left indent
larger than the first-line indent.
Unlike some word processors, Publisher doesn’t allow you to set negative
indents. That is, your text can’t extend beyond the text box margins. You
might, however, be able to get text to move closer to the edge of a text box by
reducing the internal margins of the text box. To do this, choose the
Format➪Text Box command from the menu.
Using paragraph styles
You might not want to get into this subject, but many hard-core desktop pub-
lishers prefer to use text styles to apply text formatting. A text style is a named
set of attributes that you can apply to a paragraph. (If you’ve used a modern
word-processing program, you might already be familiar with text styles.)
I use text styles extensively because they are terrific labor-saving devices.
For example, if you want all your body text to be double-spaced, 12-point,
Arial italic text with a 1⁄4-inch first-line indent, you can create a text style that
contains all those formatting instructions. When you then apply that style to
a paragraph, all the text in that paragraph instantly takes on each formatting
Figure 7-13:
A hanging
indent.
198
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

option specified by the style. If you later decide to edit a text style, all para-
graphs that bear that style change instantly — it’s quite the timesaver! So,
most experienced authors, editors, layout artists, and publishers start the
text-formatting process by creating a style sheet of all allowed paragraph
types in their documents. Then they apply these styles to their work.
To create, change, rename, delete, and even import styles, choose Format➪
Styles from the menu. The Styles task pane, shown in Figure 7-14, appears.
Start the style creation process by clicking the New Style button, at the bottom
of the Styles task pane. Doing so leads to dialog boxes that direct you to the
various character and paragraph formatting dialog boxes I cover earlier in
this chapter. You can set the following properties as part of a text style:
 Character type and size
 Indents and lists
 Line spacing
 Character spacing
 Tabs
The Styles task pane lists the available styles — and shows you what the
available styles look like.
Figure 7-14:
The Styles
task pane.
199
Chapter 7: Editors Are Bought, Not Born

When you have your style looking exactly as you want it, give it its own name
and then save it. The style is then listed in the Style list box, ready to do its
thing for you at a moment’s notice.
Has that moment arrived? Well, then, to apply your new text style to selected
paragraphs, simply select the style from the Style list box at the left end of
the Formatting toolbar, or change the selection in the Styles task pane.
Press Ctrl+Shift+S to activate the Style list box on the Formatting toolbar, and
then press the up- or down-arrow keys to move to the style you want.
You might have noticed the Import Styles button at the bottom of the Styles
task pane. Now, I write almost all my work in Word and import the text into
Publisher. (Remember that you can also do editing-in-place with Word, as I
explain in Chapter 6.) With the help of the Import Styles button, I can import
any styles I might already have created in Word. Why duplicate work that
you’ve already done?
Using the Format Painter
Publisher — like many other Microsoft Office products — offers the Format
Painter feature. Format Painter enables you to copy the format of an object to
another object. This feature is particularly useful when it’s applied to text. It
works generally with any object, however.
To copy and paste the formatting of selected characters or a paragraph:
1. Highlight the text containing the formatting you want to copy.
You can select the characters or any part of a paragraph that contains
the paragraph mark.
2. Click the Format Painter button on the toolbar.
Your pointer turns into a paintbrush that looks like the Format Painter
button.
3. Click and drag the pointer over the characters or paragraph mark that
you want to change.
The formatting is transferred to the selected text.
To apply the format to multiple selections, double-click the Format Painter
button in Step 2. When you’re done applying the format to your text, click 
the Format Painter button again.
Text box formatting
Two text formatting features affect entire text boxes:
200
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

 Hyphenating text
 Arranging text in snaking columns
Because these features affect entire text boxes, it doesn’t matter whether you
highlight text before you apply them.
The Hyphenation section, earlier in this chapter, discusses the Publisher
Hyphenation feature. (Chapter 12 discusses this feature more fully.) In many
programs, hyphenation is done at the paragraph level, but in Publisher,
hyphenation is done an entire text box at a time.
In publications such as newsletters, text is often laid out in snaking columns,
where text ends at the bottom of one column and continues at the top of the
next. You can create snaking text columns by laying down text frames side by
side and then connecting those frames, as described in Chapter 6. But that’s
the hard way of doing things. If you wanted to do things the hard way, you
probably wouldn’t be reading this book.
The easy way to do this, because the steps are so simple, is to set up multiple
columns in a single text box (so that your text can snake through). To set
multiple columns within a text box, follow these steps:
1. Select the text box.
2. Choose Format➪Text Box and select the Text Box tab.
The Format Text Box dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-15.
Figure 7-15:
The Format
Text Box
dialog box.
201
Chapter 7: Editors Are Bought, Not Born

3. Click the Columns button.
The Columns dialog box appears.
4. In the Columns Number drop-down list, enter the number of columns
you want.
You can have up to 63 columns in one text box.
5. In the Columns Spacing drop-down list, specify how much space you
want between columns.
Publishing professionals call this space a column gutter. The Sample area
shows you an example of how your text box gets divided.
6. Click the OK button to close the Columns dialog box, and click OK
again to close the Format Text Box dialog box.
The text in your text box rearranges itself into multiple, snaking
columns.
Publisher automatically ends one column of text and begins the next after 
it runs out of room at the bottom of a text box. To lengthen a column, try
decreasing the top and bottom margins of the text box or resizing the 
text box.
To force Publisher to end a column before it reaches the bottom of a text 
box, place the insertion point where you want the column to end and then
press Ctrl+Shift+Enter. This keyboard shortcut is the same one that Word
uses to specify the end of a section, and this keystroke is imported from
Word as a column end.
For nonsnaking columns, as in this book’s tables, consider using table frames.

hoosing fonts for your publication is like decorating your house: It’s great

some people like Scandinavian and others like Southwest decor, different

purple velvet wallpaper (don’t look in my daughter’s room, please!) or alter-
nate orange and black paint on the bedroom walls, chances are that you want
to choose more conventional design themes. The same is true in your

In this chapter, I tell you how to buy (if necessary), install, and use fonts. Part

experts recommend, and some sections give you the technical details, such as
how to work with fonts, what font files are, and how best to use them.
About Type and Fonts
I was doing some consulting work at a client’s office recently when I saw the
most amazing sight: The client’s secretary was busy typing a letter on an old
IBM Selectric typewriter. Okay, I know — that isn’t so amazing. The amazing
part is that the typewriter was sitting next to his brand-new computer! Let’s

see . . . type a letter on this typewriter and choose any typeface as long as it’s
Courier, or type the letter on a computer and choose from hundreds of type-
faces? Tough call! Of course, I smugly informed him of the superiority of the
computer’s technology over the typewriter. His response? “That old typewriter
never locks up on me when the boss wants something typed in a hurry!”
Don’t get me wrong: I like Courier. The widespread use of this extremely
attractive font is a testament to its durability. I think that Courier’s main
problem is that it’s overused. And, certainly, using the same typeface every
day gets old fast, no matter how great the typewriter.
The point of this typewriter story is to introduce a basic typographic term:
font. A font is one typeface, in one style. The print ball for that typewriter
contained one font: Courier.
Of course, you can go out and buy other fonts for the typewriter I mentioned.
When you need another font in your document, you simply replace the ball at
that point and carry on. Compare that time-consuming process with creating
text on your computer: On a computer, you can have as many fonts as you
want, and switching to a different font is as simple as making a menu selec-
tion. Until you print your document, you can go back and reformat your doc-
ument to your heart’s content — something that you would need gallons of
correction fluid and unending patience to do on a typewriter. No wonder that
those old IBM typewriters have been relegated to museums.
Font styles
The fonts used today come in four main styles:
 Serif: A serif is a small line that hangs off the upper and lower ends of
the strokes that make up a text character. Serifs help guide the reader’s
eye, which is why serif fonts are typically used in body copy. (Body copy,
or body text, makes up the majority of the paragraphs in a publication.)
Examples of common serif fonts are Benguiat, Bodoni, Bookman, Courier
New, Galliard, Garamond, Goudy, Jenson, Palatino, and Times New Roman.
Many of these fonts are named after the designers who either created or
inspired them.
 Sans serif: Sans serif fonts don’t have serifs (sans is French for without)
and are typically square and plainer than serif fonts. In earlier days,
these fonts were described as either gothic or grotesque faces. They’re
more commonly used in headlines, in which a limited number of charac-
ters need to be read. Examples of sans serif fonts in common use are
Arial, Helvetica, Optima, Tekton, and Univers. (And, if you’re wondering,
it really is spelled Univers, without the e at the end.)
204
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

 Decorative: Decorative fonts are used to present letters in stylized form.
Usually, they’re thematic; a set of fonts may be created from pictures of
jugglers and clowns or use cowboy motifs, for example. These fonts are
appropriate for kids’ birthday party invitations, and not so appropriate
for your annual report to the Board of Directors.
 Symbol: This font style presents symbols as a character set. Chapter 6
shows examples of the Symbol and Wingdings fonts that are installed in
Windows XP and Windows Vista. Vendors also sell symbol sets for maps
(Adobe Carta) and for music (Adobe Sonata).
Fixed fonts
The first computer fonts emulated those found in older typesetting equipment
or in typewriters. Each font was a single typeface designed for a specific size.
Most of these fonts were designed as bitmapped descriptions (composed of a
collection of dots), so they were called bitmapped fonts. You could install
Courier 8, 10, and 12 on your computer in plain (roman), italic, bold, and bold
italic styles, with one font file apiece for your screen and for your printer. You
would therefore install 12 files altogether for these three sizes. What a mess!
As time went by, type vendors produced font descriptions that let you create
a fixed font in any size from a single description. Now the use of fixed fonts is
extremely limited.
Fixed fonts are usually sold in pairs that contain a screen font (used to display
the font on your computer screen) and a printer font (used to print your text).
In Windows XP and Windows Vista, an A icon in the Fonts folder indicates a
fixed font. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Fonts to see the fonts installed on
your computer.
When you use a fixed screen font at the size it was designed to be used, the
results look as good as with any font you can use. You get the added perfor-
mance advantage of not having to have the font description rasterized (con-
verted to a bitmap for display or output), which isn’t much of an advantage
in these days of very fast computers.
If you use a fixed font at a percentage that divides evenly into the size the font
was designed for — for example, at one-half or one-fourth size — you also get
perfect results. You can even get reasonable results when using a fixed font at
two or four times its intended size. Your screen font looks distorted at other
sizes, however, even though your printed material often looks perfect.
Some printers come with their own printer fonts. If Windows isn’t familiar with
your printer’s printer font, it substitutes another font to display the docu-
ment on-screen. Although you don’t see a realistic display of how your 
document prints, it prints just fine by using the fonts contained in the 
printer. Most people have given up on fixed fonts at this point.
205

TrueType fonts
TrueType is one of two popular font formats. (The other is PostScript, dis-
cussed in the next section.) Unlike fixed fonts and PostScript fonts, TrueType
fonts don’t require separate screen and printer font-description files —
Windows can use the same description file to display the font on-screen and
to print your publication. Because the font information is contained in one
file, you have half the file management chores as you do with fixed fonts and
206
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 
Sizing up your font
You can make a font virtually any size you want.
The size of a font is normally measured in points.
A point is approximately 1⁄72 of an inch but varies
somewhat from typeface to typeface. The
normal font size used in correspondence is 12
points, but 8, 10, and 11 points are also common.
Remember that the size of a point depends on
which font you’re using. The size of 12-point
type in one font can differ substantially from 12-
point type in another font, for example. (The
figure shows you samples in various faces at
the same size.)
Not only do fonts have different vertical dimen-
sions, but their widths are different as well. Font
height is usually gauged by the height of the
lowercase x, whereas the width is usually
gauged by the width of the lowercase m. For
this reason, a font’s vertical dimension is
referred to as its x-height, and its horizontal size
is referred to as its m-width.

PostScript fonts, which is a major benefit of using TrueType fonts. In Windows
XP, an O icon in the Fonts folder indicates a TrueType font. In Windows Vista,
an O icon in the Fonts folder indicates an OpenType font. OpenType fonts con-
tain TrueType and PostScript font data.
PostScript fonts
Adobe PostScript fonts have been available since the mid-1980s. Most print
services and professional designers favor PostScript fonts because of their
high quality and large library of available font descriptions. An estimated
10,000 typefaces are available in PostScript form. (Sorry, but my editor won’t
let me list them for you.)
PostScript fonts come in two types: Type 1 and Type 3. The difference between
the two types is that Type 3 doesn’t contain special instructions (hinting) —
that alter the appearance of fonts at small point sizes (11 point and smaller) to
make them more readable both on-screen (if you have Adobe Type Manager
installed) and in printed matter. Type 1 fonts (an TrueType fonts) come with
hinting built in to their descriptions.
PostScript fonts require a special font rasterizer to convert them to bitmaps
that can be displayed on the screen or printed by your printer. For a long
time, PostScript fonts required a PostScript printer in order to print properly.
PostScript printers contained a ROM chip which stored the PostScript inter-
preter that did the bitmap conversion for output. In 1989, under pressure
from other vendors who finally cracked the technology of Adobe hinting,
Adobe released Adobe Type Manager and published the specifications of
PostScript type encryption and hinting.
Adobe Type Manager (ATM) displays PostScript fonts well and makes print-
ing fonts to non-PostScript printers possible. Your computer’s processor
takes the place of the processor in a PostScript printer. Thanks to ATM, you
can get great-looking output even from inkjet printers.
Choosing between TrueType and PostScript fonts
In regard to performance and quality, no one has yet been able to show me to
my satisfaction that there’s much difference — or, in fact, any difference —
between TrueType and PostScript fonts. Of course, you get some TrueType
fonts for free with the installation of Windows and other Microsoft products,
such as Publisher. You can’t beat that.
Here’s the best advice I can give you regarding fonts: If you’re an occasional
desktop publisher, choose either TrueType or PostScript, but try not to use
both. If you use both, pay particular attention to making sure that you don’t
use a font with the same name in both styles. In other words, if you set cer-
tain body text in TrueType Times Roman, don’t set other body text in
PostScript Times Roman. (It’s easier said than done.)
207
Chapter 8: Vintage Type: The Corkscrew, Please

If you’re a professional desktop publisher, you might have no choice other
than to use both typeface descriptions (TrueType and PostScript). The
people who are my Gurus of Type favor PostScript type, largely because of
the extremely large library of high-quality fonts available in PostScript, the
fact that many print services prefer to work with PostScript, and the bias of
many years of use. Desktop publishing professionals collect type like some
people collect wine and toss around the same nonsense about flavor, bou-
quet, body, and other terms.
I remain unconvinced. I like the convenience of TrueType and think that
PostScript is not worth the additional trouble of installing and using Adobe
Type Manager or printing only to PostScript printers, except in those cases
where a typeface exists in PostScript and doesn’t exist in TrueType.
A primer on buying fonts
You buy fonts in sets. Fonts are sold, at minimum, as a single typeface, usu-
ally in different sizes and styles. Fixed fonts are sold as individual font files.
TrueType and PostScript fonts are sold without regard to font size.
Initially, font vendors sold fonts in a general package meant to serve a variety
of needs. The first Apple LaserWriter collection of 35 fonts in seven typefaces
was this kind of package. A movement has been afoot for the past few years
to sell fonts in related families for a related purpose. Now you can buy pack-
ages meant for newsletters, faxes, correspondence, or decorative purposes,
to name just a few. Typically, these packages offer three or four typefaces in
several styles. If you’re font-minded (and who isn’t, these days?), you can buy
many vendors’ entire font libraries on CD-ROM. The fonts on the CD-ROM are
usually encrypted, and you need to obtain a serial number from the vendor
to “unlock” the fonts so that you can install them. The vendor gives you the
serial number for a particular font when you buy that font.
Buying fonts in families is an effective way to add to a collection. Most design-
ers recommend that you be conservative in your use of fonts, so a collection
of fonts in the same family makes sense. It’s better to collect one typeface in
many styles — even to collect special character sets such as Small Caps for 
a font such as Times — than it is to have an incomplete collection of several
faces.
Without a doubt, font technology has undergone an explosion since the intro-
duction of the personal computer. More and better fonts have been created
in the past ten years than in all the previous five centuries of type design. I
won’t say that the best type designers are alive now, because that would be
presumptuous, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it were true. And, certainly, the
most prolific designers are now out there working in their studios.
208
Part III: 10,000 Words, One Maniac 

I want to mention some recent developments in font technology because
they’re important and valuable. First, several typefaces have been created
that contain both sans serif and serif members. My favorite of this ilk is the
Adobe Stone family, designed by noted type designer Sumner Stone.
Another development is the introduction of “intelligent font technology.”
Adobe has introduced the Multiple Masters typeface family. These fonts can
be varied infinitely over a range through three or four axes so that you can
have a single font description yielding plain, condensed, expanded, italic,
bold, or different-size characters. These fonts require Version 2.6 or later of
Adobe Type Manager.
Most computer stores and computer direct-marketing catalogs sell fonts in
packages from one vendor or another. What you can find in these mass-
market outlets are the most well-known and commercial font packages. These
sources are adequate for the occasional desktop publisher.
For more complete collections of fonts, contact the font vendors themselves.
Each vendor in the following list publishes attractive magazines with samples
of all their fonts. Adobe’s Font and Function appears quarterly, for example.
The magazines also highlight new fonts that appear:

search on the word fonts. You will find more font resources than you can
shake a stick at.

Selecting fonts in your publication
In Chapter 7, I explain that you set the attributes for selected characters and
paragraphs from either the Font drop-down list on the Format toolbar or the
Font dialog box (choose Format➪Font). Figure 8-1 shows you the Font dialog
box again with the Font drop-down list open.
Notice that when you select a TrueType font in the Font dialog box, it offers
you four different font styles:
Regular
Bold

The Bézier versus the spline
TrueType fonts are outline fonts based on 
the mathematical B-spline quadratic curve.
These curves are similar to the Bézier curves 
on which Adobe PostScript fonts are based.
Unlike PostScript fonts, TrueType fonts don’t
require separate screen and printer fonts. The
rasterizing software in Windows contains the
necessary interpreter to output the same file
description to your printer as it does to your
monitor — with excellent results to both. This is
TrueType’s major advantage; you have less file
management to worry about with TrueType
fonts.

You also have access to eight different effects:
Superscript
Emboss
Subscript
Engrave
Shadow
Small caps
Outline
All caps
And, you have 17 different underline options:
Single
Thick long dash
Words only
Dot dash
Double
Thick dot dash
Dotted
Dot dot dash
Thick dot
Thick dot dot dash
Thick
Wave

You can mix and match styles, effects, and line placement options. As you
might have figured out by now, the TrueType font rasterizer synthesizes
these various options from the single TrueType font description.
Typography 101
I don’t have room in this book to tell you everything about typography that
you probably should know. Typography is a huge topic and one with a fasci-
nating history. That history has generated more jargon than you can shake a
stick at, so to speak — far too much jargon for me to explicate in any great
detail. For now, though, a rundown of some basic terminology is in order.
Figure 8-2 shows you a sample font with some of its features called out.
Most designers recommend that you choose a serif font for body copy. You
can add some variety and visual interest to your pages by using sans serif
fonts for headlines and subheads. A classic combination is to use the sans
serif font Arial (also called Helvetica) for headings and the serif font Times
Roman for body copy. This pairing, however, has been overused (as Courier
has). For that reason, you might want to try other combinations.
211
Chapter 8: Vintage Type: The Corkscrew, Please

Consider using the 55 built-in Publisher font schemes for your publications.
Each scheme uses two fonts that are designed to work well together and
takes the guesswork out of it. Choose Format➪Font Schemes to open the
Font Schemes task pane.
The font you use for the body copy in a long story is of particular importance.
That font colors your work and affects readability. Serif fonts have letters that
are different sizes, which makes it easier for the human eye to recognize words.
For this reason, italics, script fonts (elegant fonts with flourishes), and sans
serif fonts are typically reserved for headlines or captions. Try taking a look 
at a page of body copy in several fonts to see which one works best with your
piece.
The typographical size of a font varies according to its design. If you need to
fit a lot of copy on a single page, select a compact font. Many leading fonts
were designed for these special purposes. For example, the omnipresent Times
New Roman font was created in the 1920s as part of a redesign of The 
Times of London. The intent was to make copy readable but very compact
(the better to sell advertising space, my dear). Other fonts, such as Bookman,
were created with a more open typestyle to make novels and other books
easier to read. Most font catalogs offer suggestions for how to best use par-
ticular fonts and recommend fonts that go well with them as body fonts or
display fonts, which are designed to grab readers’ attention.
The one overriding piece of advice that most designers give is to avoid using
too many fonts on your page. Too many fonts make publications seem cheap,
poorly designed, confusing, and hard to read. We’ve all seen those “ransom
note” designs, where each letter is in a different font. Most people’s sensibili-
ties are better than that — especially because we’ve been bombarded with
well-designed printed material for our entire lifetimes.
The best way to impose good type practice in a publication is to create and
manage your publication with styles, as described in Chapter 7. Or better yet,
use one of the many templates that Publisher provides to give your publica-
tion a consistent and professional look.

You have a lot of control over the way the type on your page looks. You can
use these strategies to adjust type characteristics that open up your text:
 Use bigger font sizes.
 Adjust letter spacing or kerning.
 Add line spacing.
 Add spacing between paragraphs.
 Use paragraph indents.
 Shorten the length of lines by adjusting the text box width.
 Change the justification of text boxes.
Left-justified text (refer to the last bullet in the list) is generally considered
the most readable text and is the most frequently used. Right-justified and
center-justified text are much less common and are generally used for special
purposes, such as headlines, captions, and pull quotes. Fully justified text
works reasonably well for line lengths of about 10 to 12 words and is commonly
used in dense newspaper or newsletter pages. These methods are discussed
in more detail in Chapter 7.
Display fonts are intended for limited use at larger sizes, to catch readers’
attention. Using display text for headlines is a great way to pull a reader’s eye
to a section of a page. Often, headlines use larger and bolder fonts, display
fonts, or some other special font treatment. Because the headline is the ele-
ment that most people see first on a page, be particularly attentive to the
selection of font and font size. Also, proper kerning of a headline is well
worth the additional effort. (See Chapter 7 for details on kerning.) Be sure to
adjust the line spacing of headlines so that the words clearly belong together.
I like to use mixed casing in headlines unless the headline is very short. In
that event, I sometimes use all caps or small caps. When I use script fonts
(elegant fonts with flourishes) in headlines (infrequently), I tend to use them
only in mixed case.
WordArt frames often give you an effective way of creating attractive head-
lines. (See the next section for more information.)
Another way to set off headlines and sections in your documents is to use
rules. Rules are lines, either horizontal (for headlines) or vertical (for columns).
The use of rules is very effective, and they don’t even have to be thick. A
single-point rule suffices in most cases except for separating the headline 
of your page. (Rules are also discussed in Chapter 5.)
No matter how much time you take in designing your publications, you can
always learn something from other people’s work. When you’re working on 
a project, take a look at the best examples you can find of similar pieces and
see which fonts were used, and how.

WordArt
Microsoft WordArt enables you to create especially fancy text objects, called —
pause for effect — WordArt objects. Publisher provides WordArt frames for the
very purpose of creating and holding WordArt objects.
To see how easy it is to create WordArt objects in Publisher, check out these
steps:
1. With your Publisher publication on-screen, click the Insert WordArt
tool on the Objects toolbar.
This step opens the WordArt Gallery dialog box.
2. In the WordArt Gallery dialog box, select a WordArt style and then
click OK.
This step opens the Edit WordArt Text dialog box.
3. In the Edit WordArt Text dialog box, type the text that you want to 
use as the WordArt object.
If you want multiple-line text, press Enter to create new lines.
Notice that the Edit WordArt Text dialog box lets you select the font and
font size and specify whether you want the WordArt text to appear in Bold
or Italic format.
4. Click OK to close the Edit WordArt dialog box.
The WordArt object on your publication page now displays the text you
typed, as shown in Figure 8-3.
5. Use any or all of the WordArt toolbar tools (see Figure 8-4) to “fancify”
your WordArt object.
As you use each tool, the WordArt object automatically changes to show
the effect you set.
This step closes WordArt and returns you to Publisher. The WordArt
toolbar disappears, Publisher takes back control of the menu bar and
the top toolbar, and the WordArt selection handles go away.
6. When your WordArt object looks the way you want, press Esc or dese-
lect the WordArt object.

If you inadvertently click in the publication (but not on the WordArt text or
any menu button or tool), the WordArt toolbar and the selection handles
around the WordArt object disappear. Just click anywhere on the WordArt
text to bring them back.
Be careful of your typing in WordArt. WordArt doesn’t have a spell checker,
and because Publisher treats a WordArt object as a picture rather than as
text, it doesn’t check the object’s spelling, either.
Other Special Text Effects
Many publications use special large letters to start a text block. When this
letter extends below the top line of the text, it’s a drop cap. A large letter that
appears above a line of text is a raised cap. Figure 8-5 shows you an example
of each letter: The top W is an example of a drop cap, whereas the bottom A
is an example of a raised cap.
Many people use drop caps in place of smaller headlines. Spread out these
effects on the page, and don’t put them on the same line as the headline.
Typically, I try to use only one of these caps on a page at a time.
To add a fancy first letter, follow these steps:
1. Click the paragraph that will contain the fancy first letter.
2. Choose Format➪Drop Cap.
The Drop Cap dialog box, shown in Figure 8-6, appears. Notice that the
styles under Available Drop Caps include drop caps and raised caps.
Figure 8-5:

3. Select the Drop Cap style you want and click the Apply button.
You can see the effect immediately because the choice you made is
applied to the selected text in your publication. Apply as many styles as
you want before making a final selection.
4. Click OK when you’re happy with your choice.
To create a Custom Drop Cap, click the Custom Drop Cap tab in the Drop
Cap dialog box to open that tab, as shown in Figure 8-7. Publisher offers
many options for creating your own drop caps, including font, font style,
and color; the size and number of letters you want to stylize; and drop
cap or raised cap options.

Creating an electronic watermark
If you hold up to a light some expensive typing
paper or foreign currency, you sometimes can
see a watermark, an almost transparent image
of a company logo, a dead king’s portrait, or
whatever. It’s a very cool effect!
You can use Microsoft WordArt to create a 
similar effect electronically. Use WordArt to
create an attention-getting message, such as
Confidential or Important Notice, and then
format the message the way you want. Then
click the Format WordArt button on the WordArt
toolbar. In the Format WordArt dialog box,
select the Colors and Lines tab. Set the trans-
parency to 70 percent or higher, depending on
how dark you want the watermark to be. (You
probably have to experiment with this setting. It
varies, depending on the WordArt style you
select.) Click OK to close the Format WordArt
dialog box. Lastly, right-click your WordArt text
and choose Order➪Send to Back. That’s all
there is to it! If you want the watermark to
appear on every page of your publication, you
can save yourself some time by creating the
WordArt text on the master page. Choose
View➪Master Page from the menu or press
Ctrl+M to view the master page. (If your publi-
cation has more than one master page, click the
one you want to use.) Now create the water-
mark as just described. Click the Close Master
View button on the Edit Master Pages toolbar
when you’re done.
If you do everything just right, you should be
able to see the electronic watermark behind
your other objects. Way cool!

A Picture Is 
Worth $6.95

In this part . . .
O
kay, maybe a picture isn’t worth thousands of dollars
(unless you’re Ansel Adams), but reading a publica-
tion without graphics or pictures is like listening to a
basketball game on the radio. Sure, it can be interesting,
but something seems to be missing. Microsoft Publisher
2007 lets you include graphical images in your pages to
make them more visually appealing and to convey your
message in a more compact form. In the three chapters
that comprise this part, you can see the various ways of
incorporating graphics as a design element in your publi-
cation. Publisher 2007 helps you import photographs,
drawings, paintings, and even animated GIF ﬁles and video
clips directly into your work with ease. You can also use a
library of clip art or work with a library of design elements
supplied by Publisher to create snappy, sophisticated lay-
outs. Publisher 2007 makes it easy, and you’ll ﬁnd it a lot of
fun to work with this aspect of the program.
Face it: Color sells. Color can highlight a section, set 
a mood, or perform any number of design functions.
Microsoft Publisher 2007 lets you work with spot colors
one at a time or create colors from the whole universe 
of colors on a full-color page. The second chapter in this
part is a primer on working with color. You can see what
colors are, how they’re represented, how to match colors,
and how to produce the best and most accurate output
from the colors you want.
The third, and last, chapter in this part gives you a brief
introduction to the Publisher 2007 Graphics Manager. 
You can use this feature to easily and efﬁciently manage
all the photographs and illustrations you use in your 
publications. Although it doesn’t let you create your own
graphical images for use in your printed or online publica-
tions, it does a great job of helping you keep track of them
and keep them current.

t the risk of repeating an old cliché, singing an old song, or seeing an old
saw, a picture really can be worth a thousand words. Why explain in
dozens of paragraphs what an Aurora X-100 looks like when you can just
show your readers a picture of one?
Although Publisher really isn’t the place to draw complex pictures, it’s mighty
flexible when you’re importing pictures created elsewhere. Some desktop pub-
lishers rely heavily on collections of electronic clip art and libraries of pho-
tographs, whereas others are daring enough to create their own pictures by
using specialized graphics programs. Whether you’re working from a clip art
collection or creating your own pictures, this chapter shows you how to get
pictures into and out of your publications and how to work with pictures after
they’re in Publisher.
This chapter also shows you how to use some tools that come with Publisher
and Windows. You find out how to use Microsoft Paint to create your own
drawings, use the Design Gallery to obtain publication elements, apply
border art, and even use your own scanner from within Publisher to bring
images directly into the program.
Understanding More about Picture Frames
Publisher uses picture frames to display graphics on a layout; a picture frame
can contain either drawings or images. The differences between drawings
and images are described later in this chapter.

You don’t create graphics inside a picture frame; they must be created else-
where. The graphic contained in a picture frame can be either a data file or
an OLE object that’s managed by another program.
You can create picture frames in two ways: Draw them yourself or have the
program create them for you when you insert or import a graphic. Which
method is best depends on your purpose:
 When you need to place a picture frame of a specific size at a specific
position in your layout: Draw the frame with the Picture Frame tool (in
the toolbox) and fill the frame with a picture manually.
 When the content and size of the graphic determine the size of the
frame: Have Publisher create the frame for you as you import the pic-
ture. You can always adjust the frame’s size and position later on.
Getting Yours
Publisher provides four ways to insert or import pictures:
 Copy a graphic from another Windows program to the Windows Clipboard
and then paste the graphic into a picture frame.
 Choose Insert➪Picture➪Clip Art to open the Clip Art task pane, which
provides easy access to these types of clip art:
• Thousands of pieces included with Publisher
• Clip art collections on the Internet
 Choose Insert➪Picture➪From File to import any picture that’s saved in a
format Publisher can recognize.
 Choose Insert➪Picture➪From Scanner or Camera to scan a hard copy of
an image or to capture an image from a digital camera.
If you don’t want to make a trip to the Insert menu to choose one of the com-
mands in the preceding three bullets, you can just right-click a picture frame
to display the context-sensitive menu shown in Figure 9-1. Point the mouse
cursor to the Change Picture option to see your choices. The context-sensitive
menu also offers the Windows Clipboard commands: Cut, Copy, and Paste.
I assume that you know how to use the Windows Clipboard (refer to the first
bullet in the preceding list), although you may want to know more about
which kinds of graphic formats the Clipboard supports. The other three
methods of importing pictures into a picture frame are discussed in the 
sections that follow.

No matter how you put a graphic into a picture frame, you can use any of the
methods just described to replace that picture.
Using the Clip Art task pane
You can use the Clip Art task pane to search for clip art on your local hard
drive, your local-area network, or on the Internet. Rather than choose the
Insert➪Picture➪From File command to insert a clip art file, which requires
you to remember the name and location of the picture file (files are stored in
the Clip Art folder), you simply click a miniature version of the picture in the
Clip Art task pane.
The clip art contained in the collection that Microsoft gives you are formatted
as either .gif, .jpg, or .wmf (Windows metafile). A metafile format lets you
save both drawn and painted images in the same file; .jpg and .gif are
painted (or rasterized) formats. For more information about picture formats,
see the section “Working with Different Picture Types,” later in this chapter.
To insert a picture by using the Clip Art task pane:
1. If you want to import the picture into a specific picture frame, select
that frame.
Note: You can create a blank picture frame by choosing Insert➪Picture➪
Empty Picture Frame.
Otherwise, make sure that no frame is selected. Publisher creates a
frame for you in this case.
2. Choose Insert➪Picture➪Clip Art or click the Insert Picture tool on the
Objects toolbar and choose Clip Art from the pop-up menu that appears.
The Clip Art task pane, shown in Figure 9-2, leaps to the screen.

Chapter 9: You Ought to Be in Pictures

3. In the Search For text box, type a word or phrase that describes the
clip art you’re looking for.
If your search doesn’t include searching online, the search returns fewer
results.
4. Choose a collection from the Search In drop-down list.
If you aren’t sure which collection to choose, pick Everywhere. It results
in the largest number of results.
5. In the Results Should Be drop-down list, choose the media file type or
types that you want to search.
Your choices are Clip Art, Photographs, Movies, and Sounds.
6. Scroll as necessary through the thumbnails in the main pane of the
Clip Art task pane and then click to select the picture you want.
This step inserts the Clip Art image into your publication.
7. Click the down arrow next to the clip art image to see more options
for working with clip art.
These options are covered later in this chapter, in the section “Using the
Clip Organizer.”
8. If you want to recover some desktop real estate, click the Close button
in the Clip Art task pane to close it.
If you draw a picture frame before you import a picture from the Clip Art task
pane, Publisher automatically resizes the frame to keep the inserted image in
proper proportion. After the image has been inserted into the frame, you can
resize it to your heart’s content.
Figure 9-2:

task pane.

You can very easily replace the picture from the clip art collection with
another picture: Just double-click the existing picture to reopen the Clip Art
task pane. Click to select a different picture and then choose Insert from the
clip’s drop-down menu. You also can replace an existing picture by using the
context-sensitive menu to open the Clip Art task pane: Right-click the picture
you want to replace and then choose Change Picture➪Clip Art from the menu
that appears. (I find that double-clicking the picture is much faster.)
If you have other Microsoft programs on your computer, such as PowerPoint
or other Office 2007 components, they share the Clip Art task pane that you
use in Publisher. (In fact, you can access clip art from almost any modern
Windows program, if you know how.) So, you might find more than just
Publisher pictures there; you might also find pictures installed by Word or
Excel or other programs.
Using the Clip Organizer
The Microsoft Clip Organizer tool is installed along with Publisher. The Clip
Organizer helps you, er, classify (you thought I was going to say organize!)
your clip art into collections. Two collections are created by default:
 My Collections: Stores any clip art collections you create
 Office Collections: Contains clip art and other media files included in
Office 2007
In addition, you might encounter two other collections in Clip Organizer:
 Shared Collections: Created by a network administrator and can be
shared by any user on the network. You see this category only if your
network administrator has set it up for you.
 Web Collections: Contains, as its name implies, the collections located
on the World Wide Web. Initially, the only collection in this category is
the Microsoft Office Online collection, which contains about 150,000 clip
art and other media files, free for you to use. Using the Web Collections
category requires that you have a connection to the Internet.
You can do a couple of cool things in the Clip Art task pane and with the
Microsoft Clip Organizer that many people never check out. One is to search
for pictures by description, collection, or media type. Click the Collection List
down arrow in the Clip Organizer and select Search. Now you can enter a key-
word or description, tell Clip Organizer which collections to search, and
specify the type of media you’re looking for (Clip Art, Photographs, Movies,
or Sounds, for example). You can even choose a file format for each of the
media types to search.
225
Chapter 9: You Ought to Be in Pictures

Here’s how to add pictures to the Microsoft Clip Organizer:
1. Select the image you want to add and copy it to the Clipboard.
You can choose Edit➪Copy from the menu, press Ctrl+C, or right-click
the image and choose Copy from the context menu that appears.
2. Click the Organize Clips link, at the bottom of the Clip Art task pane.
(Refer to Figure 9-2.)
The Microsoft Clip Organizer, shown in Figure 9-3, appears.
3. In the Collection List task pane, navigate to the collection that you
want to add the image to and click to select the collection.
If you don’t want the image to reside in any existing collection, create a
new one. Right-click any collection in the collection list and choose New
Collection from the context menu. Type a name for the new collection
and click OK.
4. Paste the image into the selected collection by using your favorite
paste method.
You can choose Edit➪Paste from the menu, press Ctrl+V, or right-click
the collection and choose Paste Clip from the context menu that appears.
Make sure that the collection is selected (highlighted) in the collection
list of the Clip Organizer before pasting the image.
Note: You aren’t limited to specific image formats; you can select files in
TIF, BMP, JPG, GIF, and other formats that Publisher understands.
The Clip Organizer adds your picture to the selected collection.
5. Using the Collection List task pane, navigate to the folder containing
the newly added piece of clip art and locate the piece.
6. Click the down arrow next to the newly pasted clip art and select
Preview/Properties to open the Preview/Properties dialog box, as
shown in Figure 9-4.
7. If you don’t like the caption and keywords you see in the
Preview/Properties dialog box, click the Edit Keywords button and
make any changes you want. Click OK when you’re finished.
8. Click Close to close the Preview/Properties dialog box.
You return to the Microsoft Clip Organizer window with your newly
imported image selected.
9. Click the Close button to dismiss the Clip Organizer.
It may seem like whimsy or technobabble to walk you through the process of
adding pictures to the Microsoft Clip Organizer. If you manage large numbers
of images, however, you’ll find this process valuable.
226
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95 

One other aspect of using the Clip Art task pane deserves mention: If the clip
art and images supplied on the Publisher 2007 CD aren’t enough for you, check
out the Microsoft Web site for even more. Click the Clip Art on Office Online
link, at the bottom of the Publisher Clip Art task pane. There, you find addi-
tional clip art images, sounds, videos, and photos — more than 150,000 items!
Any clips you select from this Web site can be added to the Microsoft Clip
Organizer. (Need I mention that you must have an Internet connection to use
this feature?)

227
Chapter 9: You Ought to Be in Pictures

By default, Clip Organizer and the Publisher Clip Art task pane offer only
those pictures that are installed with Publisher and other Microsoft pro-
grams. Thus, if you create a picture yourself or obtain it from some non-
Microsoft source, you don’t find the picture in Clip Organizer (unless you
place your picture in the Clip Organizer).
Inserting picture files
The Insert➪Picture➪From File command imports a picture stored on your
hard drive into your publication. The Insert Picture dialog box, shown in
Figure 9-5, shows the pictures in the selected folder. Use the Views button (in
the upper-right corner of the window) to decide how the pictures should be
displayed in the dialog box. Your options are Thumbnails, Tiles, Icons, List,
Details, Properties, Preview, or WebView.
You might occasionally run across an image format that Publisher can’t
insert, but it’s unlikely because Publisher supports many image formats.
To insert a picture by using the Insert➪Picture➪From File command, follow
these steps:
1. If you want to import the picture into a specific picture frame, select
that frame.
Otherwise, make sure that no frame is selected — Publisher creates the
frame as needed.
2. Choose Insert➪Picture➪From File.
The Insert Picture dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 9-5.)
Figure 9-5:
The Insert
Picture
dialog box 
in Preview
mode.
228
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95 

3. With the help of the Look In drop-down list, navigate to (and select)
the file you want to insert, and then click Insert.
The picture is inserted into your publication. If you select a picture frame
before importing a picture from a file, Publisher changes the frame to
maintain the picture’s correct proportions. You can always resize the
frame later, either manually or by using the Scale controls in the Format
Picture dialog box, described later in this chapter.
If you import a picture and later decide that you want a different one, just
double-click the existing picture. The Insert Picture dialog box reopens.
Select a different filename and then click Insert.
If Publisher doesn’t understand the format of the picture you’re trying to
import, it whines: Cannot convert this picture. If you have access 
to the program that created that picture, try saving the picture in a different
format. Or, if you can open the picture in any other Windows program, try
copying the picture to the Windows Clipboard and pasting it into your pic-
ture frame.
If you import a picture by using the Clipboard and later want to change inter-
nal components of that picture, try double-clicking it in your publication.
Depending on how your computer is set up, your double-click action may
load the program that created the picture. Make your changes in that pro-
gram and then close it. Your changes are displayed in Publisher.
Scanning pictures
Another way of importing a picture into Publisher is to scan the image into
your computer or capture the image with a digital camera. Of course, you
need a scanner or digital camera and some software to run it. Don’t have one
of these items? You can pick up a color flatbed scanner for around $50. Not
that long ago, a scanner with those specs would have cost hundreds of dol-
lars. (When I was a kid, I had to walk five miles through the snow, uphill both
ways, to get to school. . . .)
Where was I? Oh, yes — scanning pictures into your computer. Choose Insert➪
Picture➪From Scanner. Select the device (scanner or digital camera) that you
want to use in the Insert Picture from Scanner or Camera dialog box. If you
selected a scanner, click Insert to scan the image into your publication. If you
selected a digital camera, click Custom Insert. You can resize the scanned
picture just as you would resize any other picture in your publication. (For
more about scanning, see the appropriately named “More on Scanning” 
section, later in the chapter.)
229
Chapter 9: You Ought to Be in Pictures

Double-clicking an image that you scanned into your publication opens the
Insert Picture dialog box. To replace the image with a new scanned image,
click the picture frame and choose Insert➪Picture➪From Scanner or Camera.
(I discuss scanned images in depth later in this chapter.)
Modifying pictures
After you import a picture, you can adjust it in Publisher in several ways:
Resize it, crop it (chop off parts), and add some space between the picture
and its frame to create a border.
If you want to edit the internal components of a picture (for example, to change
a zebra’s black-and-white stripes to purple and green or to add extra hair 
to a digital photograph of yourself — not that I have ever done this!), forget
Publisher. You need to use a specialized graphics program instead. If you used
the Clipboard to import the picture, you might be able to load the appropriate
program just by double-clicking the picture. If that doesn’t work, try using the
Clipboard to export the picture to the graphics program, make your changes
there, and then import the picture again.
Try using Microsoft Paint or, better yet, Adobe Photoshop Elements to edit
your image. One of these two programs should enable you to open and
modify most images. If you know the picture’s file type, consult the section
“Reviewing File Formats,” the last one in this chapter, to find out which kind
of image it is.
Resizing a picture
To resize a picture, you resize its frame. By default, both the picture and its
frame are the same size and have the same proportions. You can resize a pic-
ture frame much as you would resize any other frame: by dragging any of its
selection handles.
To maintain the proportions of a picture and its frame, hold down the Shift
key as you drag a corner selection handle.
If Publisher distorted your picture when you imported it, holding down the
Shift key as you drag a corner selection handle simply maintains that distor-
tion. To “undistort” a picture, try using one of the Scale controls described
next. (Scaling in Publisher is just another term for resizing. Scaling in snakes
and pipes is another thing entirely.) The Format➪Picture dialog box is also a
way to resize a picture without using the mouse.
Here’s how to resize a picture by using the Format Picture dialog box:
1. Select the picture you want to resize or restore (or both).
2. Choose Format➪Picture from the main menu.
230
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95 

3. Click the Size tab.
The Size tab of the Format Picture dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 9-6.
You can use the same procedure to scale a WordArt object. Choose
Format➪WordArt from the menu and click the Size tab. The Format
WordArt dialog box appears; it works the same as the Format Picture
dialog box does.
4. Enter Height and Width values in the Scale section to set the percent-
ages to which you want to resize your picture.
These percentages vary according to the picture’s original file size. Use
the same percentages in the Height and Width boxes to retain the figure’s
proportions.
If you want your picture to scale proportionately while resizing, select
the Lock Aspect Ratio check box. Your pictures then scale proportion-
ally while resizing diagonally. Holding down the Shift key while dragging
a corner selection handle does the same thing as turning on this option.
If you resize horizontally or vertically, though, the picture doesn’t scale
proportionately.
To see the picture at its original file size, click the Reset button in the
Original Size section of the Size tab.
5. Click OK.
Both the picture and its frame are resized accordingly.

Chapter 9: You Ought to Be in Pictures

Don’t forget that resizing a bitmap graphic lowers the quality of the image.
You can, however, resize vector graphics (drawings) to your heart’s content
without doing any damage.
Cropping a picture
Publishing professionals who still assemble publications without using a com-
puter often remove unwanted edges of a picture by lopping off those edges
with a pair of scissors. In the publishing world, editing a picture in this way 
is called cropping. Why bother with scissors, though? You can use Publisher
to crop a picture electronically.
To crop a selected picture, follow these steps:
1. Click the Crop button on the Picture toolbar.
The Picture toolbar automatically pops up whenever you’ve inserted a
picture into a publication, but if for some reason the Picture toolbar isn’t
displayed, choose View➪Toolbars➪Picture.
2. Aim the mouse pointer at one of the picture frame’s selection handles.
The mouse pointer changes to a cropper pointer, showing the same Crop
icon as the Crop button on the Picture toolbar.
3. Drag inward until you exclude the part of the picture that you don’t
want, and then release the mouse button.
Cropping a picture doesn’t permanently remove any picture parts; it only
hides them from view. To restore a picture part that you cropped, repeat the
preceding steps but drag outward. Regardless of whether you cropped, you
can drag outward on any picture to reverse crop, thus adding space between
the picture and its frame. You can also use the Picture tab of the Format
Picture dialog box to crop images. Just specify the amount (in inches, by
default) that you want to crop in the Left, Right, Top, and Bottom controls. If
you want to add space between the picture frame and the picture, specify a
negative number in the Crop From controls!
Here are a few more cropping tips to keep in mind:
 To crop or reverse crop the same amount at each edge (thus keeping
the picture in the center of its frame): Hold down the Ctrl key as you
drag a corner selection handle.
 To crop in a more customizable, irregular manner: Click the Text
Wrapping button on the Picture toolbar and then choose the Edit Wrap
Points menu option to create or modify the adjustment handles. (By
default, Publisher enables you to crop in only a rectangular fashion.)
 To resize a picture immediately after cropping: Click the Cropping tool
again to turn off the cropping option. You can also turn it off by deselect-
ing and then reselecting the picture.
232
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95 

 To remove all cropping and reverse cropping from a selected picture
with the least amount of effort: Click the Reset button on the Picture
tab of the Format Picture dialog box and then click OK.
Working with captions
Sometimes, pictures aren’t enough. They require an explanation. You can
create captions for your pictures and have the captions move with their
respective pictures across your layout. Unlike high-priced layout programs,
Publisher doesn’t automate the process of creating and renumbering cap-
tions for you. But you already possess the skills required to create a caption
and attach it to a picture.
To create a caption, follow these steps:
1. Draw a text box and enter the text of your caption into it.
2. Move the text box next to the picture and select both the picture and
the text box.
You can select multiple objects by clicking and dragging the mouse
pointer to draw a box around them. Or, hold down the Ctrl key while you
click multiple objects to select them.
3. Choose Arrange➪Group or press Ctrl+Shift+G to lock together your
picture and its caption to create a group.
Figure 9-7 shows you an example of a figure with a caption.
Hey, that’s it! What do you think this is — rocket science? You can apply
another trick to make a caption even better. Select your text box and then
choose Format➪Text Box from the main menu. On the Text Box tab of the
Format Text Box dialog box, set all margins to 0. Then your captions can get
up close and personal with your graphics.
If you want a fancy caption, use a WordArt frame rather than a text box.
(WordArt is described in Chapters 6 and 8.)
Figure 9-7:

Chapter 9: You Ought to Be in Pictures

Applying borders and BorderArt
You can give your picture frame a border by using the Lines and Colors tab of
the Format Picture dialog box or the More Lines option on the pop-up menu
that appears when you click the Line/Border Style button on the Picture tool-
bar. If the picture frame is a regular rectangle, you can also apply BorderArt
to it. (You can’t apply this feature to irregular picture frames.) You can also
apply BorderArt to text boxes, table frames, and even WordArt frames.
Follow these steps to apply BorderArt to a selected text box or frame (or
frames):
1. Choose Format➪Picture.
The Format Picture dialog box appears.
2. In the Format Picture dialog box, click the Colors and Lines tab.
The Colors and Lines tab appears, as shown in Figure 9-8.
3. Click the BorderArt button, located in the Line section of the Colors
and Lines tab.
The BorderArt dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-9.
The BorderArt dialog box is one of those simple features that’s so well
implemented that using it is a breeze. Simply use the arrow keys to move
through the list of available borders in the dialog box. The up- and 
left-arrow keys scroll up; the right- and down-arrow keys scroll down. 
As you scroll through the list, the Preview section displays the borders.
This dialog box offers tons of fun borders for you to try, and you’ll defi-
nitely enjoy playing with it.
4. Make your selection from the Available Borders list box and then
click OK.
You return to the Colors and Lines tab of the Format Picture dialog box.
5. Adjust the thickness of the BorderArt border by changing the Weight
setting on the Colors and Lines tab of the Format Picture dialog box,
and then click OK to return to your publication.
Working with Different Picture Types
Computers use two types of graphics: drawn graphics and painted graphics.
The type of graphic you’re using determines many of the characteristics of a
graphical image displayed on your screen and the quality of its printed output.
The two types use different file formats and require different types of pro-
grams for creating and editing graphics. But Publisher can work with both
types of graphics, even in the same publication.
234
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95 

Painted versus drawn graphics
Painted graphics are also referred to as images or as bitmapped, or raster,
graphics. In painted graphics, the image is composed of a set of tiny dots
(pixels, or pels) that forms a mosaic. The image is two-dimensional, although
the manner in which the image is painted can give the effect of three 
dimensions.

Chapter 9: You Ought to Be in Pictures

A painted image is similar to a mosaic of tiles that you might see in a Roman
temple. The smaller the tiles, the more realistic the image looks. The size of
the tile — or in the case of a computer image, the size of the pixel — is the
resolution of the image. This value is often given in dots per inch, or dpi.
Because a bitmap is designed for a specific resolution, it looks good at that
resolution. It can also look good at larger or coarser resolutions (smaller dpi)
because you have more data than you need. Painted graphics don’t scale up
well, however. For example, a 72-dpi image that’s displayed perfectly on-
screen doesn’t print well on your laser printer at 300 dpi.
Programs that create painted images are either paint programs, such as
Microsoft Paint, or image-editing programs, such as Adobe Photoshop. I take
a look at Paint in a moment — because it comes bundled with Windows, it’s
there for you to use, gratis. At the highest end of the spectrum, images can be
photorealistic and can be rendered to show textures, reflections, and shad-
ings. The file size of a bitmap image is directly related to the size of the
image, its number of colors stored, and its resolution.
Drawn graphics are referred to as vector or object-oriented art. With a draw-
ing, the lines, arcs, and other elements that make up a graphic are stored as
mathematical equations. Because drawings are created in this way, they’re
resolution independent. They’re calculated to display or print at the best
capability of the output device — which is why they’re referred to as device
independent. This feature makes using drawings generally (but not always)
preferable to using paintings in desktop publishing applications.
Here’s an important point, though: Regardless of how a drawing is stored, it
must be converted to a bitmap when it’s printed or displayed on-screen. This
process, referred to as raster image processing (RIP), displays graphics to any
output device. When you “RIP” a bitmap image, the only conversion required
is the resampling of the bitmap to either throw away or interpolate data from
the bitmap.
When you RIP a drawing, the processing can be simple (for lines and simple
drawing primitives) to very complex (for sophisticated descriptions of fill
patterns). Thus, a complex PostScript drawing with many, many features and
complex fills and strokes may take a while to calculate and process. These
types of drawings may also require large file sizes — thus defeating their
advantage over painted images. The crossover point is reached when 
you attempt to create a natural image as a drawing. This type of graphic is
better stored as a bitmap.
Paint with Microsoft Paint
You can buy very expensive paint and image-editing programs as a supplement
to Publisher. Still, if your needs are reasonable, you can create attractive
bitmapped images (or edit the ones you have) in Microsoft Paint. Paint is one
of the Accessories programs installed with Windows XP and Windows Vista.
236

To create a Paint OLE object in Publisher, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Insert➪Object command from the menu.
The Insert Object dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-10.
2. Click the Create New radio button, select Bitmap Image or Paintbrush
Picture from the Object Type list box, and then click OK.
The Paint OLE engine opens on your screen, as shown in Figure 9-11.

3. Create your painting by using the paint tools in the toolbox on the left
side of your screen and the color palette at the bottom.
4. When you’re done, click outside the frame to return to Publisher.
The connection of your painted object to Microsoft Paint is an intimate one.
To edit the image in place again, simply double-click it. Because the image is
part of the Publisher file, however, it doesn’t have an outside, or indepen-
dent, existence. That is, you can’t open the image as a file from within Paint.
You often can use Paint to edit images from other sources. To do this, create
a Paint frame on your layout, by following Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding step
list. Then switch to the picture frame that contains your bitmapped image.
Copy that image and paste it into the Paint frame. When you double-click the
Paint frame now, it opens with your image in it.
Although Paint has many features and tools that I don’t have room to tell you
about in this book, you should know that it’s useful for adjusting image
colors. You might want to consult its online Help system for instructions.
Paint is based on an earlier version of ZSoft’s Paintbrush, which was one of
my favorite paint programs a number of years ago. If you open the Paint OLE
engine inside Publisher, you need never worry about file formats. If you take
the non-Publisher route to launch Paint, by choosing Start➪Programs➪
Accessories➪Paint, you’re limited to working with five (admittedly important
and common) bitmapped file formats: BMP (the Windows native format),
JPEG, GIF, TIFF, and PNG.
That makes Paint a good program to use to edit and print these kinds of
images.
Draw with Publisher 2007
I have almost no drawing talent whatsoever, so I avoid drawing programs like
the plague. I am, therefore, fond of clip art and choose collections such as the
one that comes with Publisher. If you, however, can draw a horse that looks
more like a horse than a cat, you might want to create your own pictures from
scratch. Although you certainly can go out and buy a full-blown professional
graphics program, Publisher has some helpful drawing features built in.
You use the Objects toolbar to create lines, arrows, ovals, and rectangles with
ease, by first selecting the corresponding tool and then clicking and dragging
in your publication. If that’s not enough firepower for you, turn to AutoShapes,
which are shapes that are ready for you to place in your publication. All you
have to do is click the AutoShapes icon on the Objects toolbar, choose an
AutoShape from the contextual menu that appears (see Figure 9-12), and then
click and drag in your publication to create the selected shape. You can then
resize it, color it, or fill it to your heart’s content.
238
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95 

The AutoShapes you can choose from are
 Lines
 Connectors
 Basic shapes
 Block arrows
 Flowcharts
 Stars and banners
 Callouts
If the list of predefined AutoShapes doesn’t have what you’re looking for, you
can click choose the More AutoShapes option from the menu and browse the
Microsoft collection of ClipArt AutoShapes. If you still can’t find the exact
shape you want, draw your own. Use the Freeform AutoShape tool in the
Lines category to draw lines that have both curved and straight segments.
Use the Scribble AutoShape tool to create a shape that looks like it was
drawn with a pen.
Say OLE!
This book has presented three examples of using OLE servers in Publisher:
WordArt (in Chapter 8), Clip Organizer (earlier in this chapter), and Paint. If
you’re reading the chapters in this book in order, you probably qualify as an
OLE meister. But these examples just scratch the surface of the programs
that are out there at your service. Many more OLE server programs get
installed when you install Windows or other programs.
Before you know it, you have sound servers, video servers, coffee servers,
and more. (More is the operative word here.) To see what you have installed
in your system at the moment, choose the Insert➪Object command from the
menu to access the Insert Object dialog box. The servers are listed in the
Object Type list box. You can then either create a new data object that will be
part of your Publisher publication or you can insert an object contained in a
data file. Typically, if you want other programs to access the data object, you
Figure 9-12:
The Objects
toolbar’s

menu.
239
Chapter 9: You Ought to Be in Pictures

should use the second option: the Create from File option. If you want to
manage the object inside your Publisher publication, click the Create New
radio button.
If you select the Display As Icon check box, as shown in Figure 9-13, you’re
telling Publisher to display the object as an icon instead of displaying the
object itself. If you insert a Microsoft Office Excel Chart object and select the
Display As Icon check box, for example, all you see in the publication is a
small box with the word Chart in it. If you insert a an Office Excel Chart object
and don’t select the Display As Icon check box, the Office Excel Chart is dis-
played in your publication in all its glory.
Microsoft Office Excel Chart is one of the OLE servers that you may find most
useful. It can take Excel spreadsheet data and create charts and graphs from it.
If you insert a Clip Organizer object in your publication, then insert a
Paintbrush Picture object, you notice that they behave differently. Whereas
the Clip Organizer opens in its own, separate window, the Paintbrush Picture
takes over the entire Microsoft Publisher window. The term open editing
describes how clip art gallery loads: Each program displays in its own window.
The term editing-in-place describes how Paintbrush loads: The object remains
in place while the original program’s window adjusts accordingly. In-place
editing is one of OLE’s newer features, so you see it more and more as you
begin to use newer programs on your computer.
We are at the beginning of the era of compound documents or rich data type
documents. Here, small programs manage your data within a file. Your publi-
cations will be all-singing, all-dancing wonders.
Using the Design Gallery
One feature you should definitely visit in your page layout work is the Design
Gallery. The Design Gallery isn’t a graphics creator per se, although it does
rely on graphics in many instances. The Design Gallery is a browser that 
Figure 9-13:
The Insert

Icon option
selected.
240
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95 

displays a collection of page layout parts you can use inside your document
to create even more compelling publications. The original categories of parts
you can use include Accent Box, Accessory Bar, Advertisements, Attention
Getters, Barbells, Borders, Boxes, Calendars, Checkerboards, Coupons, Dots,
Linear Accents, Logos, Marquee, Mastheads, Phone Tear-Off, Picture Captions,
Pull Quotes, Punctuation, Reply Forms, Sidebars, and Tables of Contents.
Then depending on the category you select, Design Gallery offers you many
different styles, including Arcs, Kid Stuff, Marble, Nature, and Waves.
Follow these steps to insert a Design Gallery object into your layout:
1. Click the Design Gallery Object button on the Objects toolbar.
The Design Gallery window appears, as shown in Figure 9-14.
2. Click a category in the left-most pane of the window.
Design Gallery objects from that category are displayed in the center
pane of the window.
3. From the center pane, click to select an object that you want to insert.
Depending on the category you selected, you may have options avail-
able to you, as displayed in the far-right pane of the Design Gallery
window.
4. With your object selected, click the Insert Object button or double-
click to have the object appear on your layout in a new frame.

Figure 9-15 shows you a sample pull quote from the Design Gallery placed on
a layout.
Using the Content Gallery
If you create something in your work or see something created by someone
else that you want to save and reuse, that’s easy to do. Just follow these
steps to add the item to what Publisher calls your Content Library:
1. Select the object or group of objects.
2. Choose Insert➪Add to Content Library.
The Add Item to Content Library dialog box, shown in Figure 9-16,
appears.
3. Type a name for your new item in the Title box.
4. Select the relevant category check boxes (Business, Personal, or
Favorites) and then click the OK button.
The object is added to the Content Library. Items stored in the Content
Library are available to insert into any publication.

After you have added objects to the Content Library, using them in the cur-
rent (or any other) publication is simple:
1. Click the Item from Content Library button on the Objects toolbar,
choose Insert➪Item from Content Library, or press Ctrl+Shift+E.
The Content Library task pane, shown in Figure 9-17 appears.
2. Select the item you want to insert into your publication.
You may have to scroll to find it.
3. Double-click the item, choose Insert from the item’s drop-down list or
click and drag the item onto your publication.
You can store as many items as you want in the Content Library (or as
many as the storage space on your computer allows). If you have more
than 20 or 30 items in the Content Library, you may want to use the
Search features in the Content Library task pane to help you find the
items you want.
The Search options offered in the Content Library task pane are shown
in this list:
• Category (the category the object is filed under): You can edit the
Category list by clicking the Edit Category List button in the Add
Item to Content Library dialog box and then add, delete, and
rename categories. The categories are None, Business, Personal,
Favorites, and any category you created.
Figure 9-17:

Chapter 9: You Ought to Be in Pictures

• Type (the type of item that’s stored): Select a type — All, Group,
Pictures, Shapes, Text, Text Boxes, Table, or Word Art.
• Additional Sort By options (with cool search parameters): Choose
from Most Recently Used, Date Created, Title, Type, Size
(Increasing), and Size (Decreasing).
4. Click the Close button to close the Content Library task pane.
Between the Clip Art task pane, the Design Gallery and the Content Library,
Publisher gives you three very powerful methods for managing a collection 
of graphics and page layout parts to speed your work.
Tracking Down Other Picture Sources
With Publisher, you have just scratched the surface of available picture
sources for your work. If you look on the Internet you discover an almost
unlimited number of images you can use. Many of these images are freely 
distributed and of high quality. Most user group bulletin boards, for example,
have graphics sections with images you can download. Many images that
aren’t free are very reasonably priced — or are free if you use them for non-
commercial work.
Make sure that you check any downloaded files with virus detection soft-
ware. Most services do a good job of checking files, but the Internet is wide
open to viruses.
You can also find many commercial sources for images. I am inundated with
e-mail from companies that want to sell me commercial clip art. Chances are
that if a company is in the business of creating the images, the images that
they sell are of high quality. If a company is in the business of harvesting
images from other sources, as you often find in low-priced CD-ROMs, you can
be less sure of quality.
Getty Images (www.gettyimages.com) has a tremendous collection of 
royalty free images. The Dover Publications image books (www.dover
publications.com) are also excellent sources of images that you can 
scan into your publications.
Try to buy your drawn graphics in WMF formats, as they are the easiest to
work with. If you need very high-quality drawn images, then use EPS graph-
ics. (See the “Reviewing File Formats” section, later in this chapter, for more
on these — and other — file formats.)
The New York Public Library Digital Gallery (http://digitalgallery.
nypl.org) offers more than 500,000 images, many of which are in the public
domain. For stock photographs, try FotoSearch (www.fotosearch.com) or
ShutterStock Photos (www.shutterstock.com).

Inserting PowerPoint 
Slides into Publisher
You created a killer slide presentation in Microsoft PowerPoint and now you
want to use some of the slides in Publisher. No sweat — follow these steps:
1. In PowerPoint, open the presentation file that contains the slide you
want to use in your publication.
2. Click the Slide Sorter button on the View Ribbon and then click the
slide you want to use in your Publisher publication.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy, press Ctrl+C, or click the Copy button on the
Clipboard section of the Home Ribbon.
4. Switch to the Publisher window by clicking its button on the Windows
taskbar.
If the Windows taskbar isn’t visible, you can switch applications by press-
ing Alt+Tab. Hold down the Alt key and press Tab until the Microsoft
Publisher 2007 icon is highlighted in the Cool Switch box that appears.
Release both keys.
5. In the Publisher window, choose Edit➪Paste, press Ctrl+V, or click the
Paste button on the Standard toolbar.
Your PowerPoint slide appears in your publication.
The slide you inserted can be moved and resized just like a picture frame. If
you want to edit the contents of the slide, just double-click it. PowerPoint
opens inside Publisher, complete with that new-fangled Ribbon interface!
Make any changes you want; then click outside the slide to close PowerPoint.
More on Scanning
If you can see it on paper, you can get it into Publisher. The ultimate way to
bring images into Publisher is by using a scanner. A scanner is a machine that
digitizes images into bitmapped files. You can buy scanners that can read film
or slides; you can also find related equipment for video digitization.
The most popular devices for desktop publishers probably are flatbed desk-
top scanners. You can get a medium-quality, full-color desktop scanner, such
as a Canon CanoScan LiDE70 flatbed scanner, for about $80. This type of
scanner creates files in 48-bit (full) color at 2400 x 4800 dpi. Images of this
type are adequate for medium-quality magazine work.
245
Chapter 9: You Ought to Be in Pictures

You can also rent scanners at print services or have the service scan your
images for you. In the latter case, the equipment that’s used may be high
quality, so expect the cost to be higher.
Scanners can create digital images in these four modes:
 Black-and-white: Creates images with only black or white pixels. This
mode is suitable for images that are predominantly white or black and
don’t have much detail, but not for art with patterns or textures you
want to preserve. This mode creates very small file sizes.
 Line art: Used for finely detailed artwork in black and white. Turn up the
brightness level when you scan line art.
 Grayscale: Preserves any shades of gray in a black-and-white photograph
or converts color values in a color image to shades of gray. This mode
gives results of photographic quality and preserves patterns and tex-
tures. File sizes can be large but are still only a third of the size of color
scan files.
 Color: Used to create images with pictures in full color. File sizes can be
extremely large. Pay particular attention to minimizing the file size when
creating these images and to making sure that the color fidelity is correct.
Many printed materials are printed as halftone images, in which black-and-
white images are created with spots, dots, lines, or other repeating patterns.
Because these images don’t offer true black-and-white, they scan poorly.
Scanner software often has special facilities to handle halftones in order to
get adequate scans. Chances are that scanned halftones will result in images
with moiré patterns (when two or more repeating patterns overlap each
other and produce a distorted effect), which are quite unattractive. Often,
you can avoid moiré patterns by reducing image size, positioning the picture
in your scanner at an angle, and applying filtering to the image in an image-
editing program. Then, if you’re lucky, moiré patterns don’t print. Your best
bet is to avoid scanning halftone images, if you can.
Because large scanned images can take a long time to display on your layout
and can make scrolling painful, Publisher has a feature that reduces the level
of detail in your pictures or hides from view the pictures on a layout. You can
also display pictures in a reduced form, which results in a slight improvement
in performance.
To hide pictures on a layout, choose View➪Pictures. The Picture Display dialog
box (shown in Figure 9-18) opens, where you can click the Hide Pictures radio
button.
When you select the Hide Pictures option, your picture frames have an X
through them, to indicate that they contain a picture. Frames without 
content appear without an X.
246
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95 

Scanners can be used to import not only pictures but also digitized images of
any object: paper, marble, or cloth, for example. You can produce attractive
and creative graphics by using scanned images in your work.
Scanning is a complex topic that requires specialized knowledge to get 
professional-quality scans. I recommend one outstanding book on the topic
of scanners and digital imaging technology: Real World Scanning & Halftones,
3rd Edition, by David Blatner, Conrad Chavez, Glenn Fleishman, and Steve
Roth (Peachpit Press). This well-written book is technically excellent and 
was written with a sense of humor.
The most important concept you can remember about the scanning process
is that you should scan images with the purpose of the image in mind. If you’re
scanning an image for screen display, a resolution of 72 dpi is sufficient. For a
laser printer, you don’t want to scan at more than 300 dpi; a higher resolution
is wasted and can’t be used. Similarly, although you can scan any image size
to great color depth and your image can be reduced, doing so is a waste of
resources. Use a color and an image size that are appropriate to your work.
For example, an 81⁄2-x-11-inch, 24-bit color image at 300 dpi (150 lines per inch,
or medium-quality magazine printing at full color) consumes about 25MB of
disk space! It pays to save.
For example, if you’re printing only in black and white, scan in black and white.
Or, better still, scan in shades of gray. You can create attractive results from
256 shades of gray, and create good results from 64 shades of gray, with enor-
mous file size reductions. You just have to know the intended use of the
graphics.
Publisher lets you directly incorporate scans by using software that supports
the TWAIN standard. (TWAIN is scanner driver software that’s installed on
the Publisher Insert menu as a set of menu commands when the scanner is
installed.) If your scanner doesn’t support this standard, the From Scanner or
Camera command on the Insert➪Picture menu is grayed out. Even if the com-
mand is grayed out, all is not lost. Many scanner manufacturers upgrade their
Figure 9-18:

dialog box.
247
Chapter 9: You Ought to Be in Pictures

software, and you can check with your scanner manufacturer to see whether
an upgrade is available. Also, third-party software that supports your scanner
might be available. For example, the highly regarded VueScan software sup-
ports many common scanners and offers advanced features.
Reviewing File Formats
Graphical image file formats are a rat’s nest of acronyms — a veritable alpha-
bet soup. Unfortunately, you have to know something about each format in
order to decide which one you want to import a file from. File formats come
in three basic types: paint (or bitmapped image) files, drawing (or vector
image) files, and metafiles, which let you store either type of picture. A file’s
extension tells you the format of the file. This section briefly describes the
file formats that Publisher can import.
The following list describes some of the bitmapped or painted-image file 
formats supported by Publisher:
 JPEG: Files in the JPEG format take the JPG file extension. These high-
quality color files offer advanced file compression techniques for reduc-
ing their image file sizes. Because JPEG is one of the best choices for
full-color images, most image-editing programs save to JPEG format. You
also find JPEG images in scientific work, and it’s used as a standard file
format on the Internet because the format is cross-platform.
 Tagged Image File Format 5.0: This format, also known as TIFF, is an
industry standard file format that creates files that use the TIF exten-
sion. This format, created by Microsoft and Aldus, is openly published
and supported. TIFF files are very high-quality images. All paint and
image-editing programs open in and save to TIFF format. TIFF is proba-
bly the most commonly used bitmapped file format for printing from
desktop publishing applications.
Several variations of TIFF exist, so you can have problems opening 
TIFF files.
Many programs, such as Photoshop, read one flavor of TIFF and save to
another. If you’re having trouble with a TIFF file, try converting it in a
program such as Photoshop or a file-conversion program.
 Windows Bitmaps: These files, which are painted images in the Paint
format, can be either black-and-white or color. You can open and edit
these files, which take the .bmp file extension, in Paint. BMP files are
simple files that don’t use compression, so the file size on a high-quality
image can be huge. They work well for lower-quality paint images but
aren’t commonly used for images.
248
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95 

TIFF, JPEG, and PNG files are the most commonly used high-quality image 
file formats.
You can import these two formats for drawn or vector images:
 Encapsulated PostScript: EPS files are written in the PostScript language,
using plain text to indicate graphics and text with formatting. EPS files,
which end with the EPS file extension, can be displayed but can be altered
only by the creator application. You need a PostScript printer in order to
print EPS files correctly.
Although EPS files are sometimes saved without a preview file when
they’re created, and therefore appear as a black or gray box in a picture
frame, they print correctly. EPS is a very high-quality format that many
print services favor. You often find high-quality clip art stored in this file
format. When you send an EPS file to a print service, it’s complete — that
is, it contains all the font information it needs and doesn’t require the
print service to set up its computer to print your EPS file.
 WordPerfect Graphic: This proprietary format is used for drawings
inside the WordPerfect word processor and related products from
WordPerfect (now owned by Corel). Otherwise, the WPG file format 
is infrequently used.
Publisher can import these three types of metafiles:
 Computer Graphics: This standard, which produces images with the CGM
file extension, is widely used for drawn images and almost never con-
tains bitmaps. CGM is used by many IBM PC clip art collections (and is
never used on a Macintosh).
 Windows: This native file format for the Windows Clipboard creates files
with the WMF file extension. Because WMF is specified by a single vendor
(Microsoft), you encounter few difficulties with it. WMF files are nearly
always drawings; rarely do you find a file of this type with a bitmap image
in it. Many PC clip art collections now use the WMF format because it
produces good results.
 Macintosh PICT: The PICT format is the native file format of the
Macintosh Clipboard. In earlier days, the Macintosh was the source 
of many illustrations used on the PC. PICT files often contain either
bitmaps or drawn images or both. Images are of moderate quality, and
PICT isn’t a commonly used high-quality format. The files take the PCT
file extension.
Phew! I told you that the world of file formats was a rat’s nest. Still, Publisher
is blessed with a large and varied collection of file format import filters. All
the popular ones are included, so you should have little trouble working with
images from outside sources.

Image ethics
Pay particular attention to the source of any
image you intend to use in your work. Someone
created the image, and someone owns it, and
the two “someones” aren’t always the same
person. Whoever the owner is controls the use
of the image and can let you freely use it, let 
you use it for noncommercial use, or charge you
a fee.
Don’t be fooled into thinking that just because
an image is a picture of something well known
in the public domain (for example, a picture of
the Statue of Liberty), it doesn’t belong to the
person who took the photograph. It does.
The Microsoft Publisher 2007 license allows you
to freely use its clip art in your publications for
your personal use. You cannot sell the clip art
electronically as software, either individually or
in a collection. Other companies let you freely
use low-resolution images but charge you for
the use of high-resolution images. You must
check out the license that comes with the
image. The problem, though, is that many
images don’t come with a license. In that case,
err on the side of caution and use an image
whose source and conditions of use are known.
Just to muddy the waters, an aspect of copy-
right law allows for the “fair use” of text and
images in some instances. If you’re using a
piece of a document or an image for journalistic
criticism, you’re free to use the work of others.
The restriction is that the piece you use must 
be a small part of the work and not something
central to the use of the work. For example, 
you could use a still-frame image (but not hun-
dreds of them) from a movie or a short video 
clip but not a long one. The fair use doctrine
hasn’t yet undergone long scrutiny of the law
(something that could be said of much of cur-
rent copyright laws). Each country also has its
own copyright laws.

olor sells. What once appeared to be dull, listless text looks like super-
text when you add color. Microsoft Publisher 2007 makes incorporating
color into your publications easy. Some of its features can help you create
effects close to those found in high-priced spreads you’ll find in the glossy
fashion mags.
In this chapter, I tell you how to use color in your publications. I also give you
theories on color use and enough information about color modeling to get
you started. I help you get more color in your publications for less money by
explaining how to apply color in a cost-effective way.
Understanding How Color 
Improves Your Page
Which would you rather look at: a black-and-white photograph or a color
photograph? A black-and-white movie or a color movie? Most people prefer
color, even though black-and-white has its artistic merit.
Color creates highlights, blocks sections of your page, and draws the eye to
important sections. Studies show that when color is used correctly, the aver-
age reader spends more time on a page and has a higher comprehension of
its contents. When color is used badly — an easy thing to do — the average
reader finds something better to look at. Studies show that, too.

Follow these keys to using color well:
 Don’t go overboard when using color.
 Choose complementary colors. (More about this topic later in this 
chapter.)
 Be consistent in your use of color in a publication; use the same color for
the same page elements.
 Create a color scheme — a set of colors producing the best impression —
and then stick to it.
By following these suggestions, you help readers stay focused on the content
of your page without being distracted by the color you put there. (If you think
that these suggestions about not overdoing it with color sound a lot like the
suggestions I made to not overdo it with type in Chapter 8, you’re right.)
Defining Color
In technical terms, color is a reaction of the receptors in the eye, the optic
nerve, and the human brain to different wavelengths of light. Color also has a
certain strength, measured by the amplitude of its wavelength. If a color has
no amplitude, it’s black and you can’t see it. Any color with a strong enough
amplitude appears white.
If you mix a color with black, that color darkens and the resulting color is a
shade. If you mix a color with white, the color lightens and the resulting 
color is a tint of your original color.
So far, so good. The color that an object appears to be is affected by whether
the object is a source of light and transmits light (such as a colored piece 
of glass), or whether the light is reflected from its surface (such as printed
paper). This feature affects not only the range of color but also its intensity.
Transmitted light has a greater range and is usually more intense than
reflected light. That’s why you can get better scans from slide scanners than
from desktop scanners that are scanning colored paper. It’s also the major
reason why output on your computer monitor looks great but printed output
sometimes doesn’t. Even great-looking printed output doesn’t hold a candle
to your computer monitor.
Color Models
I assume that your computer has a color monitor — a pretty safe assumption
these days. Because a color monitor has to do a lot of the same work you do
in trying to make your publication a smashing, colorful success (you know,
252
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95 

combining all those shades and tints and ranges and intensities into a pleas-
ing whole), it makes sense to take a look at how your monitor manages it all.
To check out how color gets handled by your color monitor, follow these steps:
1. Right-click your desktop and choose Properties from the pop-up menu
that appears.
This step opens the Display Properties dialog box.
2. In the Display Properties dialog box, select the Appearance tab and
then click the Advanced button.
The Advanced Appearance dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-1.
3. Click the Color1 button to display the Color sample box.
The Color1 button is located in the center-right area of the dialog box.
4. On the resulting pop-up palette, click the Other button.
The Windows Color dialog box appears, the holy grail of all color manip-
ulation. (See Figure 10-2.)
Now I can talk a little about color theory and the various models of color.
Anytime you select color in a Windows program, the Color dialog box shown
in the figure might open. Publisher tries hard to shield you from this mon-
strosity, but if you’re working on a publication and you click “More Colors!”
(as in “I must have more colors!”), eventually you open something that looks
similar to the Windows Color dialog box, or selector. Oh, well.
Figure 10-1:
The
Advanced
Appearance
dialog box.
253
Chapter 10: Color by the Numbers

To select a color in the Color dialog box, click the color you want or drag the
crosshair in the large pane on the right until you land on the perfect color.
Whichever way you select a color, you see the values change for a color’s 
hue (the Hue option) and saturation (the Sat option) in addition to all three
values for red, green, and blue. Hue is the name of the color; saturation is the
intensity of the color. The third value, which doesn’t change, is the luminos-
ity, or lightness. To change the luminosity value, you move the color on the
vertical bar to the right of the Color selector box.
In one model, the HSL color model, these three values — hue, saturation, and
luminosity — uniquely identify a particular color. In the second model, the
RGB model, any color is seen as a combination of three values of red, green,
and blue (the primary colors). Values in the RGB model can range from 0 to
255, thus describing 256 colors per primary color or 16.7 million possible
colors in the spectrum. The number 16.7 million is one that computer pro-
grams and manufacturers often toss about.
Remember the color wheel? It’s a representation of all the colors. (No, it
doesn’t show all 16.7 million of them.) Using the primary colors, the 
sequence around the wheel is red-orange-yellow-green-blue-violet.
You can describe four basic color schemes based on the position of the colors
on the color wheel, as shown in Figure 10-3:
 Monochromatic: A single color on the color wheel. Monochromatic
schemes appear uniform.
 Analogous: Colors that are close to each other on the color wheel. Ana-
logous colors create color schemes that are soothing and harmonious.
 Complementary: Colors that are directly opposite each other on the
color wheel. Complementary colors attract the most attention of 
all color schemes.
 Contrasting: Color combinations that consist of at least three colors that
are an equal distance from each other on the color wheel. Contrasting
colors are balanced.
Figure 10-2:
The
Windows
Color dialog
box.
254
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95 

I want to pass along some good recommendations for establishing color
schemes. When using one color, create a monochromatic scheme by using
that color’s shades or tints. When using complementary colors, use one 
dominant color and shades or tints of its complement. When using contrast-
ing colors, use the brightest color as a highlight and the palest color as the
background.
Here’s a piece of trivia about complementary colors. People who are color
impaired are most often color impaired in pairs of complementary colors:
Some people are red-green color impaired; others are orange-blue color
impaired.
The RGB color model represented by the values in the Windows Color dialog
box is a computer color model. That is, it represents color as though the human
eye were a perfect measurement device — but it’s not.
After having said all that about color, I suggest that you do yourself a favor
and choose one of the more than 90 color schemes that Publisher offers, as
spelled out in the next section. Microsoft spent a lot of money on talented
designer types to come up with these color schemes, so there’s no sense in
reinventing the (color) wheel!
Perhaps the most widely accepted perceptual model of color was developed
by the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) in the 1920s, based on
populations of people matching a color to mixtures of three primary colors.
The results of this model are probably the most accurate indication of true
perceived color that we now have. In the CIE space model, similar colors

appear near each other, and the CIE space looks like a set of hyperbolas with
white at the center. Any paint or ink vendor worth its salt calibrates colors to
one CIE space or another. Most advanced computer color-matching schemes
are based on CIE space as well.
Changing the Color Scheme
A color scheme is a set of colors associated with a publication. Publisher comes
with more than 90 color-coordinated color schemes. The easiest way to change
the color scheme is from the Publisher Tasks pane. If the Publisher Tasks
pane isn’t showing, choose View➪Task Pane from the main menu or press
Ctrl+F1 to display it. Click the Format Publication down arrow and select
Color Schemes from the list, as shown in Figure 10-4. As soon as you click 
on a color scheme, it’s applied to your publication.
If you don’t find any of the more than 90 color schemes to your liking, you’re
free to create one (or more) of your own. On the Color Schemes tab of the
Format Publication task pane, click the Create New Color Scheme link. In the
Create New Color Scheme dialog box, shown in Figure 10-5, select your
favorite colors. The Preview and Sample areas give you an idea of the poten-
tial impact of your new color scheme. Type a name in the Color Scheme
Name text box and click the Save button. Your new color scheme appears in
the color scheme list in the task pane.

Printing in Color
Printers can print color in one of two ways: by using a specific colored ink or
by creating a color using a mixture of other colors. To assign color in a com-
puter program, you specify a color as either a specific ink (spot color) or 
a process mixture (process color). You can use either, neither, or both in 
your work.
To print color correctly, you have to tell Publisher which print process you’ll
use — spot color or process color — and the printer you’ll use. Publisher lets
you print to a desktop color printer using a printer driver at any resolution
offered by the printer (600 dpi, or dots per inch, is common, but 1200 dpi is
probably more standard and even higher dpi (2400 dpi) is offered on some
desktop laser printers.)
If you’re creating a print-to-disk file for your local copy shop or commercial
printer, you need to find out whether the shop has any special requirements.
Ask your commercial printer to loan you a copy of its printer driver to work
with, if you don’t already have it. (Windows ships with many types of printer
drivers.) Printer drivers affect not only color fidelity but also margins and
other features. See Chapter 13 for more about printer drivers.
Publisher also has a Commercial Printing option. Using this option, you can
specify process color or spot color. Spot color can print at high resolution,
which can be 1,200 dpi or higher. (High-resolution image setters go as high as
2,800 dpi, and 2,400 dpi is common.) Process color, on the other hand, prints
at medium resolution. I have more to say on this topic in Chapter 13.
Figure 10-5:

Chapter 10: Color by the Numbers

Process color (full-color) printing
Publisher refers to process color printing as full-color printing and supports
output to color printers to any resolution offered by the printer. With process
color selected in the Color Printing dialog box (choosing Tools➪Commercial
Printing Tools ➪Color Printing gets you there), you see eight colors in the
Color palette of the Font Color, Fill Color, and Line Color toolbar buttons. If
that isn’t enough, you can click the More Colors button. The Colors dialog box
then appears with the Standard colors tab selected. In that mode, you see 12
shades of seven colors (purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red, and black).
Figure 10-6 shows the Standard color selections. If you use the Custom tab,
you see all the colors that Windows makes possible in Publisher, as shown 
in Figure 10-7.

You can create colors with gradient patterns (colors that vary from light to
dark or from one color to another in steps) by making selections from the
Gradient tab of the Fill Effects dialog box. Doing so creates striking results.
Because of imperfections in the properties of CMY (cyan, magenta, and
yellow) inks, they don’t blend to form black. Instead, you get a dark brown.
For this reason, and because this color, referred to as process black or com-
posite black, requires more ink than most papers can absorb, black ink is
used as a fourth color.
Process color can be applied in two ways:
 Inks are applied one on top of another and blended into a contone, or
continuous tone, image.
 Color spots are placed side by side to create a halftone pattern. With
well-crafted halftone patterns, the viewer’s mind blends the colored
spots to create the color.
Spot color printing
With the Spot Color option selected for an outside printer in the Color Printing
dialog box (choosing Tools➪Commercial Printing Tools ➪Color Printing gets
you there), you can see only black, shades of gray, and your selected spot
colors in the Color palette. (See Figure 10-8 for a view of the Fill Color palette.)
(Okay, you can’t really see the colors in the figures, but the top two rows are
blues, the next two are grays; the following are whites, and the bottom two
rows are shades of black.) Note that the same palette appears under the Font
Color and Line Color buttons on the toolbar. In either case, your selection 
of colors is always the same.
A spot color adds an additional color to the black ink that’s normally used in
printing. Adding a single spot color to black is referred to as two-color printing
because black ink is also a color. Some commercial print equipment can print
Figure 10-8:
The Fill
Color 
dialog box.
259
Chapter 10: Color by the Numbers

two, three, or four colors, including black, in a print run. You can specify any
number of spot colors, but because each color must be set up by your printer
service, it may be more cost effective at some point to switch to full-color (or
process color) printing. (Publisher recommends that you consider process
color at the two-color stage, which is probably too conservative.) The number
of copies being printed is also a factor in whether to use spot color or process
color. Discuss color options with your commercial printer for the best deal.
When you use spot colors, you have the opportunity to mix your color with
blacks (shades) or whites (tints) and thus extend the range of colors. You 
can also replace black ink with another color and use colored paper rather
than white to further introduce color into your work. Be careful, though,
because the color and quality of the paper affects the appearance of the
color of the inks.
One Publisher option lets you print color separations as proof pages that you
can hand to your printer when you use spot color. Proof pages serve as a
check to see that color is being applied to your document in the right places
for each colored ink; the term separations refers to the fact that each proof is
a separate color. Each spot color is printed as a separate sheet in black, as is
the color black itself. To enable this option, select Separations in the Print
Colors As drop-down list in the Advanced Printer Setup dialog box before a
print run.
To select Separations in the Print Color As drop-down list, you must have a
color PostScript printer selected and use the Commercial Printing option
with Spot Color selected.
Because of the high cost of full-color printing, I nearly always prefer spot
color to process color. You can get good results by printing spot colors at
high resolution and making good use of shades and tints. I often substitute
another color for black ink and use colored paper for an additional color.
Color Matching
Every device that can display color also has a range of colors, or color gamut,
it can create. Computer monitors have a color gamut, as do desktop scanners
and printers. Because color monitors emit light, their color gamut is larger
than the color gamut of printers. That’s why the color that prints on 
your color printer often doesn’t match the color you see on your color 
monitor. Color matching is a process that attempts to match the colors on 
one device to the nearest color available on another. The results are often
less than satisfying.
260
Part IV: A Picture Is Worth $6.95 

Matching process color
Your computer monitor likely displays fewer than 16.7 million colors, and
therefore, a number of colors are unavailable on your screen. Windows shows
an unavailable color as a dithered pattern of two colors in the Color sample
box in All Colors mode in the Color dialog box. The nearest pure color is dis-
played in the Solid color sample box. Dithered color happens quite a lot if
your system (like mine) has 256 on-screen colors.
When the object can be displayed in the dithered, or true, color you have
selected, Publisher does so. Colored text and objects with fill patterns cannot
use dithered color (the text and fill patterns would drop out — be invisible to
the eye); for those objects, Publisher uses the closest matching color.
In some printing processes, different-color inks are applied one on top of the
other to produce a color of any kind. Three inks are used to create process
colors: cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY). These complementary colors should
theoretically result in a process black (but don’t, as I noted earlier).
Even when the color values on a monitor exactly match what a printer is
capable of, printed color output often looks pale and washed out in compari-
son. Most times, special paper made for a particular printer dramatically
improves print quality. Ask your printer service what paper options you
might have.
Most print shops correct a publication for poor color, if you have made it
clear that color matching is important. You should have reasonable expecta-
tions, though.
Matching spot color
If you print a spot color, you see a color that’s uniform but perhaps not exactly
the color you intended. If you need to match a particular spot color 
exactly, you must specify it by using a color matching system, available 
with many computer programs.
Several color paint matching systems are in use; the best known is Pantone.
The Pantone company (www.pantone.com) produces about 1,100 standard
color swatches that printers can match their printing to. Many ink manufac-
turing companies match their inks to Pantone colors. Publisher includes a
Pantone tab in the Colors dialog box. The Pantone Color Matching system is
recognized all over the world as the standard for describing color. Using
colors from the Pantone tab of the Colors dialog box (see Figure 10-9) helps
ensure that colors you want in your publication are the colors your commer-
cial printer produces. I know that this concept seems simple, but keep in
mind that your idea of ‘blue’ may not coincide exactly with someone else’s.
261
Chapter 10: Color by the Numbers

You can buy a swatch book of Pantone inks at design retail stores and from
most desktop publishing catalogs. With swatch book in hand, you can select
the Pantone color you want and mark that color on each separation. Give
those marked pages to your printer, and that should do the trick.
When you specify that a color in a publication should be a Pantone match, the
printing service must match that color as part of its contract with you. 
The results vary, but not nearly as much as when you specify process color
printing. Expect to pay more for Pantone inks because of the extra care that’s
necessary in their preparation.
I prefer Pantone colors to custom colors that your printer can blend. Custom
colors are cheaper, however, and may be worthwhile if you don’t mind some
variance from print run to print run. Custom colors work best when you per-
form a single print run and don’t have to do any matching.
Pantone has created a computer matching system that breaks apart standard
colors into component inks so that they can be created with process inks. In
the past, some programs (such as Adobe Illustrator) could specify Pantone
inks in terms of their color values. Now Publisher offers the same functional-
ity. Pantone uses a mixture of as many as seven ink color components to do
its color matching. Pantone isn’t the only matching system, just the most
commonly used.

M
icrosoft Publisher 2007 provides a tool — the Graphics Manager task
pane — for managing all the pictures in your publication. You can use
the task pane to view a list of all publication pictures by name, page, file type,
or even picture status. If that weren’t neat enough, you can also use Graphics
Manager to convert a linked image to an embedded image. You can even save
an embedded image as a linked image and then save it as a new file.
Graphics Manager is pretty handy, but it can’t do everything. First and fore-
most, it doesn’t let you create pictures for your publication. If you used a pre-
vious version of Publisher, you might remember that the program used to
have the Microsoft PhotoDraw program, which, unfortunately, is no longer
available. Graphics Manager also doesn’t help you manage OLE objects
because OLE objects are now created and managed by other programs from
within Publisher. And, going down the list of Publisher objects, Graphics
Manager doesn’t help you with AutoShapes, WordArt, BorderArt, or pattern
fills, either.
Enough already with what Graphics Manager doesn’t do. Let’s take a look at
the things it does.

Summoning the Graphics 
Manager Task Pane
Bringing the Graphics Manager task pane to life isn’t difficult. Follow these
steps:
1. If the Publisher task pane isn’t visible, choose View➪Task Pane from
the main menu or press Ctrl+F1.
The Task Pane opens to the Format Publication task pane or to the task
pane most recently opened.
2. Click the down arrow in the upper-right corner of the task pane to
release the drop-down menu and then choose Graphics Manager.
The Graphics Manager task pane appears in Thumbnail view, as shown
in Figure 11-1.
After the Graphics Manager task pane appears, you can undock it from the
side of the screen by pointing the mouse cursor to the left side of the task
pane’s title bar. When the cursor changes to a four-way arrow, you can drag
the Graphics Manager task pane anywhere you want on the screen.
You can resize the Graphics Manager task pane when it’s undocked by first
pointing to any of the four sides and then dragging when the cursor turns
into a double arrow. (You can also resize the Graphics Manager task pane
when it’s docked, but the only side you can move is the right side.)
Figure 11-1:

When you’re finished with the Graphics Manager task pane, you can dismiss
it by clicking the Close button or pressing Ctrl+F1.
Pinpointing Your Pictures
Okay, finding pictures in your publication doesn’t sound like such a big deal.
Or is it? If your publication is only two pages long and has only a half-dozen
pictures, you’re correct. But what if your publication is a catalog that’s more
than a hundred pages long and has hundreds of pictures in it? And, what if
you need to find an image named widget137.tif? Sure, you can page
through the publication until you find it. (A better option is to have your
intern do it. They love that stuff — trust me.) The best option is to use the
Graphics Manager task pane to find it.
Here’s how a search works:
1. First, open the Graphics Manager task pane, as outlined in the preced-
ing section.
2. Choose All Pictures from the Show drop-down menu.
Your files are listed in the Select a Picture pane of Graphics Manager.
To view your pictures in Thumbnail view, select the Show Thumbnail
check box, below the Sort By options on the task pane. If you’re search-
ing through a large number of pictures, turn off Thumbnail view to
improve performance.
3. On the Sort By drop-down menu, select the best choice for searching
through your pictures.
The Sort By options are File Name, File Extension, File Size, Page Number,
and Status. File Name is probably the most commonly used search
options.
4. Scroll through the Select a Picture pane until you locate the filename
you want.
5. Click the down arrow next to the filename and choose Go to This
Picture from the pop-up menu that appears. Or, just click the picture.
Publisher opens the page containing the selected picture and highlights
the picture with selection handles.
Note that the down arrow doesn’t appear until you point the mouse
cursor at the filename.
Figure 11-2 shows the Graphics Manager task pane with pictures listed alpha-
betically by filename.

Embedding and Linking Pictures
You have essentially two ways to place a picture in your publication: Embed
the picture, which means that the inserted picture is part and parcel of the
Publisher publication, or link to the picture. When you link to a picture, your
publication contains only a pointer to tell Publisher where the picture file is
located and how to display it, which has the benefit of making your publica-
tion file smaller. The trade-off is that you have to keep track of that separate
picture file.
If you’re printing your publication with a professional printer, use linked pic-
tures. The printer can then make edits to the pictures outside of Publisher, if
necessary. You should insert pictures as linked pictures when you’re creating
this kind of publication. But, no worries! Publisher offers a way to change
embedded pictures to linked pictures.
You might also decide to use linked pictures if your publication is very large
because it contains numerous large images. If your publication is slow to load
or if navigating in the publication is slow because of having numerous many
large pictures, change embedded pictures to linked pictures.
To convert an embedded picture to a linked file, follow these steps:
1. Using the Graphics Manager task pane, navigate to and select the file
that you want to convert to a linked file.
Figure 11-2:
You can

2. Click the down arrow next to the filename and choose Save As Linked
picture from the pop-up menu that appears.
3. Using the Save In drop-down list, navigate to the folder where you
want to save your picture.
4. Type a name for the file in the File Name field or accept the name that
Publisher suggests, as shown in Figure 11-3.
5. From the Save As Type drop-down menu, select an appropriate file
format for your picture.
When you convert an embedded file to a linked picture, Graphics Manager
lets you choose the file type. Your options are .gif, .jpeg, .tif, .png,
.bmp, .wmf, or .emf.
6. Click Save.
If you’re tired of keeping track of all the linked picture files, you can change
the linked pictures to embedded pictures. To convert a linked picture to an
embedded picture, follow these steps:
1. Use the Graphics Manager task pane to navigate to and select the file
that you want to convert to an embedded file.
2. Click the down arrow next to the filename and choose Convert to
Embedded Picture from the pop-up menu that appears.
Graphics Manager embeds a copy of your picture into your publication.
It doesn’t affect the picture file on your computer.

Changing the Way Pictures Appear 
in Your On-Screen Publication
You probably have lots of pictures in your Publisher documents. A picture is
worth a thousand words, after all. But having many pictures in a document
can really slow things down, especially if you’re making a lot of changes to
the size or other properties of the pictures. Publisher lets you decide how
you want your pictures to be displayed on-screen by specifying settings in
the Picture Display dialog box. Settings in this dialog box don’t affect the way
a publication prints.
To access the Picture Display dialog box, follow these steps:
1. Call up Graphics Manager, as specified at the beginning of this chapter,
in the section “Summoning the Graphics Manager Task Pane.”
2. Click the Change Picture Display link, at the bottom of the Graphics
Manager task pane.
The Picture Display dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-4.
As you can see in this figure, you have these three display options:
 Detailed Display: Shows your pictures as they will print. Your pictures
will look terrific on-screen but might be slow to draw.
 Fast Resize and Zoom: Causes your pictures to be displayed faster but
possibly in a lower resolution. They will still print at full resolution.
 Hide Pictures: Does exactly what it says — hides your pictures, by dis-
playing an empty picture frame with an X through it as a placeholder to
show where your picture will appear. Your pictures print normally.

Do you ever want to know how large a picture is in your publication is?
Which graphic format it uses? Its effective resolution? Graphics Manager can
tell you all that information and more.
To open the Graphics Manager task pane, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Task Pane from the menu or press Ctrl+F1.
2. Click the Task Pane drop-down menu and choose Graphics Manager.
3. Click the down arrow next to the picture whose details you want to

fter your layout is complete, most of the hard work
is done. Many “gotchas” can crop up when you begin
to print your publication, however. Some are tiny errors
that seem to bedevil everyone, and some errors are of the
thorny, devilish type. In the chapters in this part, I discuss
the most common problems that appear in a publication
in its ﬁnal stages of production and tell you how to get rid
of them. If you’re like most people, you spend some time
tweaking your work to get it just right. It would be a

P
roducing quality desktop publishing means sweating the details. I’m not
talking about jumping up and down in your sweatsuit with the Richard
Simmons Sweatin’ to the Oldies video, but rather about getting absorbed in
the details of your publication before you send it to the printer — where real
money changes hands. In this chapter, I look at things you can do to make
sure that your publication reflects the care you took in designing it.
The Eyes Have It
The single best piece of advice I can give you about checking your publication
is this: Look it over in printed form. Publisher lets you create proof prints;
avail yourself of this opportunity. You should also create a proof for an outside
printer. The proof is your “contract” that tells the printer “This is what I want.”
You can’t (or at least you shouldn’t) expect to catch all the errors in your pub-
lication the first time you look at it. The more people you have look at your
work, the better chance you have of finding things that should be changed.
Spotting your own errors can be difficult. When possible, try to live with the
final design for a while before you commit to spending money for printing.
I highly recommend that you create a complete checklist of items you want to
check in your publication after you complete its design.

The Design Checker
The Design Checker, an automated tool in Publisher, attempts to find things
that are wrong with your publication. It catches many errors that you wouldn’t
be likely to catch until after the publication is printed, such as
 Empty frames
 Covered objects
 Text in the overflow area
 Objects in the nonprinting region
 Disproportional pictures
 Spacing between sentences
Follow these steps to check your design with the Design Checker:
1. Choose Tools➪Design Checker from the main menu or choose Design
Checker from the Publisher Tasks drop-down menu.
The Design Checker task pane appears, as shown in Figure 12-1.
2. Tell the Design Checker which type of design check you want to run
by selecting the appropriate check box:
Run General Design Checks: Checks for problems that would apply
to any type of publication, such as missing pictures or a story with
text in the overflow area.

Part V: Proof Positive 

Run Commercial Printing Checks: Checks for issues that can affect
your commercial printer’s ability to print the publication the way
you intend. Too many or missing spot colors are common problems.
Run Web Site Checks: In publications that you plan to publish on a
Web site, checks for missing (hyper)links and pictures that don’t
have alternate text.
Run E-Mail Checks: Checks primarily for problems that cause text
to be sent as an image in an e-mail message, causing large messages
(an object overlapping text or rotated text for example). It also
checks for issues (hyphenated text) that cause gaps to appear in
some e-mail viewers.
As soon as you select the type of check to run, the Design Checker starts
looking for problems and displays potential problems in the Select an
Item to Fix pane of the Design Checker.
3. Click an item’s down arrow in the Select an Item to Fix pane to see
options for resolving the issue.

Items check box is selected, items disappear from the list as they’re resolved.
On the General tab, you can also choose which pages to check. You can select
only the current page, all pages including master pages, or all pages not includ-
ing master pages.
Figure 12-3 shows the Checks tab of the Design Checker Options dialog box
with the Commercial Printing Checks option chosen in the Show drop-down

checks for a specified option. Just deselect the boxes in the Checks in This
Category list.
As one of your final checks, you just can’t beat running the Design Checker.
Word-Fitting Techniques
When you’re working with a layout to make it look exactly the way you want,
one of your hardest tasks is making the text fit into text boxes. If your layout
can’t be changed, the amount of text it can hold is set. Also, you might find
that the formatted text simply looks ugly.
A common problem in fully justified text is that there can be a large amount of
space between words throughout a text box — the text looks as though rivers
are running through it. You probably can’t change the justification of your text
boxes, but you can work with the hyphenation feature (see Chapter 7) to break
words and improve the look of your text. Even the automated hyphenation
tool isn’t perfect, so you might want to manually hyphenate justified text. In
the following sections, I describe this technique and others for making your
words fit into the text boxes in your layout.

Part V: Proof Positive 

Copyfitting
You can rephrase nearly every paragraph to reduce or add words without
changing the meaning of the text. (My editor does this to me all the time!)
People working with page layout generally don’t have the luxury of being 
able to edit text — that job belongs to the author or the editor. If you’re both
layout artist and author, however, you can copyfit your text by adding and
removing words.
Editing text written in short sentences or phrases is more difficult because
you have fewer words to work with. In those cases, a thesaurus can be your
best friend. To open the Publisher built-in thesaurus, follow these steps:
1. Select the word you want to look up in the thesaurus.
2. Choose Tools➪Language➪Thesaurus.
The Research Task Pane opens, and the word you selected displays in
the Search For text box. The Thesaurus is displayed as the reference
material currently in use in the Research Task Pane. A list of choices
from the Thesaurus is displayed in the Research Task Pane display pane.
The Publisher spell checker (see Chapter 7 for information on how to use it)
contains more than 100,000 words. The spell checker’s large dictionary doesn’t
help you if you use a valid word incorrectly — such as two rather than to.
Always proofread your text for errors caused by properly spelled but incor-
rectly used words.
If you’re working with Microsoft Word, you can use its grammar checker to
inspect your text. To open the grammar checker in Word 2007, click the
Spelling and Grammar button on the Review tab in the Proofing group 
on the ribbon. (To check the grammar in your story in Publisher, choose 
Change Text➪Edit Story in Microsoft Word from the context-sensitive menu
of a text box.)
Incorrect word usage is particularly difficult for authors to spot. The best way
to proofread is to have as many people as possible read your publication
before you commit to printing it. If your publication is important, you may
want to pay a professional proofreader to review it.
Adjusting spacing in headlines
Publisher gives you many ways to adjust the spacing in and between your
text frames. Use the ideas in this section as a reminder and check list.

Chapter 12: Final Checks

A common error in headlines is having too much spacing between letters and
between lines. Headlines nearly always benefit from proper kerning and from
reducing the default line spacing that Publisher applies to large letters. Kerning
is particularly important in headlines with serif fonts.
Figure 12-4 shows an example of a headline that dominates the page. In Figure
12-5, the headline’s spacing between characters (tracking) was changed from
very loose to normal, and the line spacing was adjusted to 1.25 sp. In addition,
the headline frame can now be reduced to make the headline less prominent.
Before you spend too much time formatting the tracking and line spacing of
your headlines, try using the AutoFit feature. Right-click the text box that con-
tains your headline and choose Change Text➪AutoFit Text➪Best Fit. You may
find that substituting a WordArt frame for a text box in headlines works well.
If a headline belongs with a block of text, leave more space above the head-
line than below so that readers have a visual clue that the headline applies to
the text that follows.
Another problem to watch for is a headline that breaks across lines in a way
that makes the meaning unclear to the casual reader. If you can improve the
readability of your headline by grouping phrases, do so. For example, in the
headline Gas Prices Top $4 Per Gallon, break the line in front of the word Top
rather than behind it. (Then go pull your bicycle out of the garage.)

Make sure that your headline placement matches the page numbering in the
table of contents (if your publication has one). Although many page layout
programs automatically renumber the table of contents, Publisher does not.
Also, if you use headlines as headers and footers and place these elements in
the background, make sure that they’re correct when you proofread the pages.
Getting words to fit in text boxes
One way to make text fit into a text box is to simply adjust the size of the text
box. This task is straightforward if only a single text box is on the page. With
several text boxes in a multicolumn page layout, however, resizing text boxes
can affect all columns simultaneously. One subtle way to work around adjusted
text boxes is to play with the lines and spacing in your headlines. If you made
the text boxes smaller and now have extra space on the page, you can add a
line to a headline or put in a secondary headline to occupy that space. If you
made the text boxes larger, you can remove extra headlines to provide more
room.
The amount of line spacing dramatically affects the amount of text you can fit
into a text box. You can adjust line spacing in
 A single text box
 All text boxes on a page
 All text boxes on a two-page spread
You also can change the spacing before, after, and between paragraphs. If you
adjust line spacing, you do so for the entire text box and, ideally, for all text
boxes on a page or a two-page spread.
You don’t have to make large changes in line spacing to get results. Check the
results on a printed page to see whether the adjustments you make are
acceptable; don’t rely on the way your page looks on the screen.
I also like kerning and tracking as a way to slightly alter text to make it fit cor-
rectly in a text box. (When you use kerning and tracking in this way, the change
isn’t obvious to a casual observer.) Chapter 7 tells you about various tech-
niques for adjusting the spacing between letters in your text.
Publisher refers to kerning as adjusting the spacing between two characters,
and tracking as adjusting the spacing between characters for a large selection
of text.
When you adjust text boxes, pay particular attention to preventing widows
and orphans. A widow is a short line at the top of a page or column; an orphan
is a word, or portion of a word, on a line by itself at the end of a paragraph.
279
Chapter 12: Final Checks

One common mistake to watch for is two spaces between sentences. This
practice is a holdover from the days when people used typewriters — the
extra space made sentences more obvious.
To check for extra spaces, search for two space characters and replace them
with one: Just type two spaces directly into the Find What text box in the
Replace dialog box and replace with one space. Be sure to run this search-
and-replace operation a second time, in case you typed three spaces between
sentences.
Hyphenating and justifying text
Another method for altering the way text fits in a text box is to change the
justification. Sometimes after a design is set, however, you don’t have the
flexibility to change the text justification. To fit the largest amount of text into
a text box, apply full justification and automatic hyphenation to the text box.
Remember, however, that you cannot use automatic hyphenation for only
part of a text box.
Whenever you use automatic hyphenation, you can no longer control the
location of line breaks. To regain control, turn off hyphenation; then turn it
back on and request to confirm each hyphenation as it occurs.
When you use right- or left-justified text (also called ragged text) as opposed
to full justification, you often make the text more readable even though you
can’t fit as much text in a column. To gain more space, hyphenate.
In ragged text, if you’re tempted to force a line ending by using a soft carriage
return (by pressing Shift+Enter), don’t do it! When you force a line ending,
however, you change the line endings of every line after that point. This situa-
tion isn’t a problem if automatic hyphenation is turned on, but it can cause
grief if you hyphenated the text manually. Therefore, forced line endings
should be your last resort.
You can also force a line ending at the position where the automatic hyphen-
ation tool places a hyphen. To do so, move the cursor to that position, click
and press Ctrl+- (hyphen). An optional hyphen shows up only when the entire
word doesn’t fit on the line. Therefore, optional hyphens aren’t affected by
soft carriage returns. If you want to make sure that a word is never hyphen-
ated (at the position where Publisher would hyphenate it), move the cursor to
that position, click and press Ctrl+Alt+- (hyphen). I recommend this safeguard
for a compound word that already contains a hyphen: for example, double-
barreled rather than double-barrel-ed. The common practice is to never end 
a column or text box with a hyphen.
Always use optional hyphens rather than regular hyphens to hyphenate text.
280
Part V: Proof Positive 

When you hyphenate text in a paragraph, try to have no more than two con-
secutive hyphenated lines. Hyphenated text is harder to read and understand.
For this reason, some page layout professionals avoid hyphenation, although
it greatly increases the amount of work necessary to fine-tune the layout.
Whatever you do, don’t hyphenate headlines; they must be readable at a
glance.
You can control the amount of hyphenation that Publisher uses by 
changing an option in the Hyphenation dialog box. Choose Tools➪
Language➪Hyphenation from the main menu and enter a smaller number 
in the Hyphenation zone text box to smooth out your ragged edge and to
reduce the amount of white space between words. To have fewer hyphens 
or to have fewer short syllables before and after the hyphen, make the
Hyphenation zone larger.
You can also open the Hyphenation dialog box by pressing Ctrl+Shift+H.
Page Improvements
People tend to read a page from the upper-left corner to the lower-right corner.
In a two-page spread, that principle applies to the upper-left corner of the left-
hand page to the lower-right corner of the right-hand page. Putting your most
important page elements along this diagonal path is good design practice.
One useful feature of page layout programs is that they impose a design struc-
ture on your pages. Readers should be able to instinctively find common ele-
ments, such as page numbers, on a page. I recommend setting common page
elements on master pages, one master page for all left-hand pages and another
master page for all right-hand pages. With these common elements in place,
you can move on to break up the tedium of your pages by having some ele-
ments stand out. The longer the publication, the more important it is to have
elements that draw the eye to specific sections.
Special page elements
Earlier in this chapter, I describe some techniques for breaking up a page and
drawing attention to various sections. The following useful techniques help
make your pages more interesting:
 Pictures: Pictures instantly attract attention. When you place a picture
on a page, it becomes a focus of attention. Putting pictures off the reader’s
diagonal path — in the lower-left or upper-right corner of a page or two-
page spread — creates an interesting effect. If you use too many pictures,
however, you greatly reduce their effectiveness.
281
Chapter 12: Final Checks

 Drop caps or raised caps: These design elements are an excellent way
to start a chapter or section, and they draw the reader’s attention
regardless of where they appear on the page.
 Rules and shaded boxes: I like rules and shaded boxes because they’re
particularly valuable for making headlines stand out. If you think that a
section of text is important, put it in a shaded box.
 Pull quotes or sidebars: A pull quote is a short section that highlights
the important point you’re making on a page. To make a pull quote stand
out, place it outside the text box. Sidebars are longer sections that you
want to make stand out. You can reserve sidebars for optional reading
or make them central to your text treatment.
Don’t forget that the Design Gallery comes with a selection of specially for-
matted headlines, coupons, pull quotes, sidebars, tables of contents, and
titles. If you create any design elements that you want to use elsewhere, create
your own category in the Design Gallery and save those elements under it. I
talk about the Design Gallery in Chapter 9, and I like it so much that I wish it
were greatly expanded. Figure 12-6 shows you the Design Gallery with the
Pull Quotes category selected.
Inserting an object from the Design Gallery is just the beginning. You’re free
to resize an object and to ungroup it so that you can work with its compo-
nents. You can also change the text in a Design Gallery object, and adjust
colors and shading.
Figure 12-6:

282
Part V: Proof Positive 

One interesting effect that you can make with shaded areas is a bleed, which
is a section of color that extends past normal margins all the way to the edge
of your page. You can use bleeds with single pages and to span the inside
margins of a two-page spread. If you use bleeds in your work, consult with
your printer shop to make sure that its presses are capable of printing bleeds.
Bleeds often require special treatment and cost more money, but their effects
can be worth the cost.
Drawn objects
Although most tools in the toolbox can’t draw objects for you, you can use
them to create interesting effects. You can also find special shapes on the
AutoShapes tool on the Object toolbar. Drawn objects don’t have to be small;
they can be major page elements as well. For example, if you’re creating a pub-
lication that includes a topic for discussion or the dialogue of a play, you can
use a cartoon balloon shape — which is ordinarily used to hold captions — as
your entire page frame. Be creative and have fun!
Also, you needn’t be constrained by the shapes that appear in the toolbox.
You can combine shapes to create other shapes, such as combining triangles,
circles, and lines to create a mountain landscape with the moon rising in the
background. When you combine shapes with colors, patterns, gradients, and
shadings, you have a wealth of tools at your disposal.
Borders and shading
Borders and shading are helpful ways of separating a section of your page. You
can place borders around pictures by using rectangles and circles or create a
matted-photograph look by putting colored frames in back of pictures. If you
try this technique, consider using bold colors to emphasize the picture.
When you use borders and shading with text, try to understate their presence.
If a shaded block is colored gray, keep the gray level at 10 to 15 percent. You
can overuse color on a page very easily. Similarly, if you use shading in back
of text, make sure that the shading makes your text more readable, not less.
As the shading gets darker, it’s more difficult to see black text but easier to
see white text. Note that white text, or reversed text, is generally less readable
than black text. It works well only in front of black backgrounds and in short
phrases, such as headlines.
Borders and shading are valuable when you create tables. The Publisher
table frame automatically creates shades and borders for you. If you create
an array of information without a table frame, consider adding these features
to your work.

Do you want to know the most readable color combination for text? Take a
look at the cover of this book. Surprise! It’s black type on a yellow back-
ground. To change the color of text, use the Font Color tool, which appears
on the Formatting toolbar when you have text selected.
Special symbols
If you use capitalization in a paragraph, you might find that using SMALL CAPS
looks better, particularly for a whole sentence of capitals. Also, changing a
line of capitals to small caps can shorten your paragraph measurably and
help you with copyfitting. If you have a paragraph that must be lengthened to
fit the text box, consider making the first sentence all caps — especially if the
first sentence makes the point for the paragraph or section.
Keyboards have feet (') and inch (") marks for single and double quotation
marks. Typographers prefer the use of stylized smart quotes instead: ‘and’ for
single quotation marks and “and” for double quotation marks. To automati-
cally insert these symbols into your text when you type single and double
quotation marks, choose Tools➪AutoCorrect Options to open the AutoCorrect
dialog box. Click the AutoFormat As You Type tab and select the "Straight
Quotes" with “Smart Quotes” check box, as shown in Figure 12-7. (This option
is set by default.) If you have text that needs straight single or double quota-
tion marks, you have to turn off the option temporarily. Don’t forget to turn it
back on when you finish. You can also use the Insert Symbol dialog box to
insert any of these characters.

Part V: Proof Positive 

Suppose that you want to align the first character of a headline or a pull quote
with the text frame that appears below or above it. A regular quotation mark
can disrupt that visual alignment and be distracting. Therefore, you might
want to use the hanging quotation mark typographical technique to put an
opening quotation mark to the left of the headline or pull quote.
Some page layout programs let you format a paragraph so that it has a hanging
quotation mark. In Publisher, follow these steps to create this effect manually:
1. Type a paragraph or pull quote with smart quotes at the beginning
and end of the text.
2. Create a small text box that’s large enough to hold the quotation mark.
3. Position the small text box to the left of the paragraph or pull quote
for an opening quotation mark or to the right for a closing quotation
mark.
Zooming in to see your text is helpful when placing the small text box.
4. Select (highlight) the quotation mark in the paragraph or pull quote
and then choose Edit➪Cut to cut it to the Clipboard.
5. Click an insertion point in the small hanging text box; then choose
Edit➪Paste to paste the cut quotation mark into the frame.
Unfortunately, because you have separate text boxes, the hanging quotation
doesn’t automatically follow the headline as it moves around on your page.
Therefore, group the hanging quotation mark text box with the headline or
pull quote text box. Other symbols that typographers use (which might be new
to you) are the en dash (–) and em dash (––) in place of two hyphens ( - -) and
three hyphens ( - - -), respectively. They’re named en dash and em dash because
they’re the width of a capital N and M, respectively, in the font that’s being
used. Many desktop publishing programs automatically substitute these 
symbols whenever you type two or three hyphens. Publisher, for example,
automatically substitutes the en dash when you type a space followed by 
a hyphen, and an em dash when you type two hyphens together.
Good typographical practice recommends using en dashes to indicate a range
of numbers (where you would normally put the word to) or when you have a
compound word, as in Barrington Smythe–Jones. Use an em dash to set off 
a parenthetical remark — as I do in this sentence — before you end your
thought and use up your brain cells.
If your en and em dashes don’t show up automatically, ensure that the
Hyphens (-,- -) with en/em dashes (—) option is enabled on the AutoReplace
Format As You Type tab of the AutoCorrect dialog box.
285
Chapter 12: Final Checks

If you look closely at the symbols in different fonts, you find that most fonts
contain typographer’s fractions. The 1⁄2 and 1⁄4 symbols appear to the right in
the Insert Symbols dialog box, one line down from where the en and em dashes
appear. Also, most fonts have characters for copyright (©), trademark (™),
and registration (®) symbols. These special characters are best used as
superscripts in the same font size. You also find various currency symbols 
($, £, ¢), accented characters (Á, ç, é, ô), and ligatures (Æ, æ), for example.
It pays to study the Insert Symbols dialog box to see which special characters
your current font offers.
You may require a special fraction beyond the ones offered in a standard
character set. Here’s how you create one:
1. In standard text, type the fraction you want, such as 3/8.
2. Format the numbers to the left and right of the division sign at about
60 to 70 percent of the text size.
For example, if you have 12-point text, use 8-point numbers.
3. Format the left number as a superscript and the right number as a
subscript by choosing Format➪Font from the main menu and clicking
the corresponding radio buttons in the Font dialog box.
Don’t forget that you can use non-integer point sizes (such as 11.5) if you’re
using TrueType fonts or Postscript fonts and Adobe Type Manager.
What if you need a superscript number, such as 28, or a subscript number, such
as H2O? You can apply these formats to selected text from the Character dialog
box or by pressing the Ctrl++ (plus) or Ctrl+Shift++ (plus) key combinations.
Press these combinations again to toggle the superscript or subscript back to
normal text.

om is a desktop publisher’s best friend. A desktop publisher’s next
best friend is the person responsible for printing his or her publica-
tion. You should call your mother at least once every week and send her flow-
ers on Mother’s Day. And you should talk to your printing professional before
and during the development of any desktop publishing project that you
aren’t printing yourself.
In this chapter, I consider how to work with professional print shops and other
outside printing resources. Specifically, I show you how to set up your publica-
tion for whatever printer you’re using, select paper, and take advantage of the
special paper (from PaperDirect) that Publisher lets you use. I also describe
common problems and concerns about using an outside printer. People some-
times find working with a professional printer for the first time to be something
of a mystery.
Printers and Output Quality
Print quality is determined by the printer engine (the mechanism that makes
the printer print). Typically, print quality is measured in the number of dots
per inch (dpi) that a printer can deliver to a printed page. That measurement
isn’t the whole story, however. The shape of the dots, their placement in rela-
tionship to a letterform, and the density of the dots can dramatically change
the perceived quality of a printed page.

For example, many printers, such as the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet series, use
resolution enhancement technology to improve print quality. (HP named its
technology REt; other vendors name theirs something else — Intellispot,
Varidot, Omnishade, PrintGear, or whatever their lawyers can trademark.)
When placing dots at the edge of a printed character, some laser printers
vary the size and intensity of the spot to better conform to the character’s
border. The net effect is that the printed text appears to be at a higher resolu-
tion and that halftones, which print with shades of gray — created by black
spots — appear to have more grays in them.
The following list briefly describes printer types and their common uses:
 Impact: Dot matrix and print wheel printers are included in the impact
printer category. This type of printer prints by striking a ribbon (like a
typewriter) and transferring the ink from the ribbon to the page. Some 
of these printers can print graphics, but as a group they aren’t used in
desktop publishing applications. The only reason I can think of for keep-
ing an impact printer around is for printing multipart forms. Although
impact printers aren’t suitable for desktop publishing, if you need one,
you can pick one up starting at about $150.
 Inkjet: An inkjet printer prints by spraying ink droplets under pressure.
The output quality of this printer type varies widely. Desktop inkjet print-
ers at the low end print up to 600 dpi in either color or black and white.
Print quality is moderate, but print speeds are relatively slow. Special
paper improves inkjet output. You can now buy very inexpensive — less
than $25 — inkjet printers that deliver impressive color output at medium
to high resolutions. What’s the catch? A color ink cartridge for that low-
cost printer costs nearly $40. There’s no such thing as a free lunch, er,
printer.
 Laser: Laser printers produce black-and-white grayscale (shades of gray)
and color output. You can find black-and-white laser printers for less
than $100. Color laser printers are now available starting at about $200.
When looking for a new laser printer, whether it’s black and white or
color, keep in mind that your major expense over the life of the printer is
the toner cartridges. It’s definitely worth your time and effort to find out
how much toner cartridges will cost for the printer you’re considering
buying. Common desktop laser printers print in the 600 dpi range,
although laser printers that print to 1200 dpi are becoming the new 
standard.
 Xerographic: Many copy shops and printer services have printers that
are essentially fancy copy machines. These xerographic printers offer
fast speed and moderate resolution (1200 dpi). In this category, the
Xerox DocuTech 6180 is a 180-page-per-minute (ppm) production 
scanner/printer.
288
Part V: Proof Positive 

 Dye sublimation: This type of printer works like an inkjet printer but uses
heads to sublime (vaporize and deposit) special dyes on paper. Some
printers in this category use crayons and waxes; others use low-melting
dyes or liquids. They’re used almost exclusively for color work. In most
cases, inkjet printers produce a halftone image, but dye sublimation 
printers can produce contone (continuous tone) images.
 Imagesetter: This high-resolution laser printer prints at 2000–3000 dpi.
The output it creates is printed paper or, more often, film that’s used in
turn to create printing plates. You can find imagesetters at print ser-
vices. They’re used in very low-volume printing to create original print
masters.
You might find any or all of these printers, except for impact printers, at a
copy shop or printer service.
Selecting the Target Printer
Each printer you use (whether in-house or in a professional print shop) offers
different capabilities: page sizes, minimum margin widths, and color options,
for example. When you print to your desktop printer, you set those options in
the Page Setup dialog box. If you’re using a printer that’s at a professional
print shop, you can install and use the printer driver (the interpreter that lets
your computer talk to the printer) for the print shop’s printer as the target
printer on your desktop computer. (Target printer is just a spiffy term for the
machine on which you intend to print a given publication.) Your target-printer
selection and setup are publication-level settings: They’re a part of your current
publication but do not affect any other publications.
Note that the target printer doesn’t have to be your printer. That is, although
you probably have your own printer attached to your computer, you might
not want to use that old banger. You might have access to an even better
printer that offers color, faster speed, the capability to print on bigger sheets
of paper, a slot that dispenses hot beverages while you wait, or whatever. If
this other printer is the one you intend to use to print the final version of
your publication, you should select it as the target printer.
Windows contains many printer drivers; some belong to expensive color
printers or imagesetters. If you can’t find the target printer that you intend 
to print to on this list, you can always ask your printer service to supply you
with the driver. Most will “loan” you their printer drivers for free. Printer dri-
vers are easily copied to CD or downloaded from a Web site and are installed
on your machine using the Windows Add Printer Wizard.

Follow these steps to select and set up a target printer:
1. Choose File➪Print Setup.
A Print Setup dialog box, like the one shown in Figure 13-1, opens with
your default printer listed. (Your printer might offer different options
from the ones shown in the figure.)
2. If you don’t want to use the default printer, choose a different one

The default printer is determined by Windows. To change the default
printer, choose Start➪Printers and Faxes, right-click the printer of choice
from the listing that appears, and select the Set As Default Printer com-

3. In the Orientation section, click to select a paper orientation, if it isn’t
already selected.
Your choices are Portrait (lengthwise) and Landscape (sideways).
4. In the Paper section, use the Size drop-down list box to choose the
size of paper on which you plan to print, if it isn’t already selected.
The selected printer determines the available sizes.
5. Also in the Paper section, use the Source drop-down list box to choose
the appropriate paper source for your publication, if it isn’t already
selected.
I’m not talking about the Hamilton Paper Box Company or Staples here.
The source refers to the part of the printer that has the paper you want
to print on. The selected printer determines its available sources. Some
printers have different trays, feeders, tractors, and other methods for
loading paper into themselves.

Printing Your Pages
The operations described in these sections are controlled by Windows;
Publisher uses the services of the operating system to print. You can print 
to a local or network printer, or you can set up to print to an outside printer
service. Often, you do both, by printing draft or sample copies on your local
printer for proofing and then receiving final output from a printer service.
Printing problems are legion with computers — if you’re having difficulties
printing, try getting help by selecting the Troubleshooting topic in the
Windows Help system. Use the Help command on the Start menu to access
the Windows Help system.
If your publication prints but doesn’t look the way you expected, search for
the word printer in Microsoft Publisher Help. Press F1 or choose
Help➪Microsoft Office Publisher Help and type printer in the Search box.
This command opens the Help system and shows you topics of interest in
solving printer problems.
To print to a local or network printer, called inside printing, you can use vari-
ous methods:
 Click the Print button on the Standard toolbar. Publisher immediately
begins printing your entire publication by using the current print
settings.
 Choose File➪Print or press Ctrl+P. The Print dialog box, shown in 
Figure 13-2, appears with the default printer selected. Make your 
selections from that dialog box and then click OK.
 Drag and drop a publication file to a printer icon or shortcut on the
Windows desktop or in Windows Explorer.

The Print dialog box contains these important features:
 The Printer Name drop-down list box: Select the printer you want to

to your printer.
 The Page Range section: You have three suboptions in this section:
• All Pages: Select this radio button to print all pages.
• Current Page: Select this option to print just the page in which
you’re working.
• Pages: To print a range of pages, select this radio button and enter
the number of the first and last pages you want to print in the
From and To text boxes.
 The Copies section: Specify the number of copies you want to print and
whether you want them to be collated.
 The Advanced Printer Setup button: This button, located on the Printer
Details tab, opens the Advanced Printer Setup dialog box, where you can
choose to print linked graphics in full or low resolution. You can also
decide not to print linked graphics. The specific printer model you’re
using determines whether you can specify the print quality, what to
print, the printing order (for labels), and other options.
The Print to File option prints to a file as a .prn or .ps file, rather than
printing to a printer. One main advantage of this is that you can “print to
file” from Publisher even if no printer is connected and later, when con-
nected to a printer, print the publication using just the captured file.

The capabilities you see in the Print dialog box and the Advanced Printer
Setup dialog box are determined to some extent by which printer you select.
Nearly all printers, however, allow you to select a range of pages to print and
to print multiple copies or copy a file to disk and have the file printed on
another printer. Many other capabilities — collating, color capabilities, two-
sided printing, and other options — are specific to each printer. Check out
the Properties dialog box by clicking the Properties button in the Print dialog
box to find out more about your printer’s capabilities. Also, your printer
manual is a good place to learn more about your specific printer.
When you accept the Print dialog box settings, Publisher creates a print job
and spools (sends) it to your printer. To see the print queue (the set of docu-
ments) sent to the printer, double-click that printer’s icon in the Printer folder.
A window opens, showing you the current print jobs and offering you the
commands necessary to modify your print jobs. You can delete print jobs,
suspend them, and move them around in the queue.
The Print Setup dialog box
If you’re printing to a desktop printer, you owe it to yourself to choose File➪
Print Setup and explore your printer’s Print Setup dialog box. It’s somewhat
deceptive because it hides the most interesting settings in the Properties
sheet. To access these settings, click the Properties button. You can then
control such characteristics as paper size, graphical resolution (the number
of dots per inch), and font quality.
Tips for printing
The Publisher Help feature includes some handy tips for printing your publi-
cation. To access this feature, open the Help window by choosing Help➪
Microsoft Office Publisher Help or pressing F1. If the table of contents isn’t
visible, click the Show Table of Contents button on the toolbar. In the table 
of contents, click Saving and Printing, click Printing, and then click Tips for
Printing Your Publication. One of the most valuable tips presented is a table
that can help you decide whether you should print the publication yourself
on your desktop printer, take the publication to a copy shop, or hire a com-
mercial printer to create the final output.
Using Outside Printing Services
Publisher lets you print to any common desktop printer that you can attach
to a PC. For low-volume output, a desktop printer is usually sufficient. You
may sometimes need to print in large quantities, however, or with capabilities
293
Chapter 13: Printing, Print Shops, and Paper

beyond those of most desktop printers (such as printing large jobs, printing
in high resolution, printing spot color jobs, or printing on a paper size that
your desktop printer doesn’t support). In these cases, visit a printer service,
copy shop, or commercial printer. Each of these establishments offers differ-
ent capabilities, and each one offers different degrees of hand-holding.
The following ideas can help you in your quest to select an outside printing
service:
 If you know people who use printing services, get their recommenda-
tions. If you don’t, let your fingers, er, mouse do the walking through the
Internet and try out a few services. Try searching for printing services
or commercial printing at your favorite Internet search engine. Ask to
see samples of a service’s work and get the names of other clients they
worked with. Good printers deliver quality work on time and on budget.
You’re paying good money for the work, and you should get good results.
 Know what you expect from your service. Use the Pack and Go Wizard,
(described in the next section) to ready your publication for the com-
mercial printer. By default, the wizard prints a composite and separa-
tions. The composite combines all the colors in your publication and
should well represent the final product. The separations show your
printing service how the colors are separated. Publisher prints one 
page for each color. Take the composite and separations with you to 
the printing service.
 Evaluate the printing quotes. If you need to print several thousand
copies of a publication, a commercial printer is the best choice — and
will likely save you money. Copy shops and printer services offer lower
pricing at volume levels, but commercial printers can lower the cost per
page even more.
 Ask about their policy on overage. Most printers, to be on the safe side,
print a specific number of additional copies of your print order. Some
charge for the overage — make sure that you know when they do. An
overage charge of more than 15 percent of the print price is excessive.
 Don’t pick a printer that offers the cheapest price. You usually pay
anyway for the money you save with longer print turnaround times and
less attention to your work. Printing is an extremely competitive indus-
try. After you calculate the cost of paper and ink, labor is the only
remaining variable.
Working with an outside service
Be sure that you understand what your outside printer service requires in
order to print your publication. An outside service is likely to ask that you
provide, at minimum, the following materials before it can complete your
print job:
294
Part V: Proof Positive 

 Page proofs of each page, with each spot color or process color separa-
tion printed as a proof
 A listing of your fonts, files, and printing directions
 The files themselves in Publisher 2007, Adobe PDF, or Postscript format,
with any needed font files and graphics files included
 Any original drawings or photographs that need to be scanned
Use the Publisher Pack and Go Wizard to ensure that you have everything
you need to take to the printing service. Follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Pack and Go➪Take to a Commercial Printing Service.
The Take to a Commercial Printing Service task pane appears — almost
as if by magic — as shown in Figure 13-3.
2. Choose Commercial Press from the How Will This Publication Be
Printed? drop-down list, if it isn’t already selected.
3. Click the Printing Options button.
Doing so displays the Print Options dialog box, shown in Figure 13-4.
The Print Options dialog box is the place to change the orientation of
the publication or choose which pages to include.
Figure 13-3:
The 
Take to a

task pane.
295
Chapter 13: Printing, Print Shops, and Paper

4. Confirm your print options and then click OK.
The Take to a Commercial Printing Service task pane returns to your
screen.
5. If any items remain to be resolved in the Select an Item to Fix section
of the task pane, click the down arrow next to each item and choose
how you want to address the issue.
Items you might see here include Publication in RGB mode (best for desk-
top printing, although you’re likely to choose spot or process colors) and
Story with Text in Overflow Area.
6. When all flagged issues have been resolved to your satisfaction, click
Save.
The first screen of the Pack and Go Wizard appears, as shown in 
Figure 13-5, prompting you to enter a location to save your files.

7. Click Browse to choose a folder in which to store your publication,
and then click Next.
The final screen of the Pack and Go Wizard appears, as shown in 
Figure 13-6, letting you know that your publication has been 
successfully packed.
8. Click OK to print a composite proof.
I recommend printing the composite proof but if you already have a copy
(or just don’t want to print it), clear the check box before clicking OK.
The Pack and Go Wizard creates a zip file containing all the files you need
to take to your commercial printer in the folder you chose. If the file isn’t
too large, you can e-mail it to the commercial printer. Otherwise, you can
copy it to a USB drive or create a CD.
Avoiding problems
Using special fonts can be the most troublesome aspect of working with an
outside printer service. The following list describes some of the troubles 
you can encounter:
 Many shops keep only a limited collection of fonts. In some cases, a busy
shop might simply hand you the output of your file with whichever font it
substituted for the fonts it doesn’t have.
 If you overload a document with fonts, you can overload an imagesetter’s
memory and create Postscript overflow errors that add to your costs.
 Using gradient fills can quickly overload an imagesetter’s memory, as
can special WordArt effects.
Figure 13-6:
You’re
packed and
ready to go!
297
Chapter 13: Printing, Print Shops, and Paper

Another troublesome aspect of working with outside printers is forgetting 
to include all the graphics files that your publication needs. Keep these 
concepts in mind:
 If you submit scanned graphics, make sure that the resolution of the scan
is appropriate to the kind of printing you’re doing.
 Try to use scanned graphics that are simply placed in your publication.
If you crop, rotate, or otherwise modify your scanned images, you create
large, complicated files.
Ensure that your printer service has the fonts you used in your publication.
Also, if you submit EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) files, make sure that the
printer service has the same creator application for your publication and its
components.
If you’re printing a costly print job, you might want to request a press check,
where you ask your printer to set up the printing press and run off sample
copies of the publication for you to check. The printer service is more likely to
be willing to do this if you’re on hand at the time that the shop runs your job.
Sit down and evaluate any print job that a printer returns to you. If you find a
problem, let the printer service know about it. And, don’t forget to let them
know when you’re especially happy with their work. My favorite way of letting
my service providers know that their work was good is to recommend them
to other people.
Setting Up for Outside Printing
The Tools➪Commercial Printing Tools➪Color Printing command lets Publisher
select a printer driver that’s best for the outside printing you’re likely to do:
black-and-white, full color, or spot-color printing. Figure 13-7 shows the Color
Printing dialog box.
To set up your publication for black-and-white printing, select Single Color.
Then click the down arrow of the Inks in Use color and click the Change
button to display the Change Ink dialog box. Click Black and click OK.
Avoid using two spot colors in gradient fills, in which the two colors are
blended. That configuration prints poorly, if at all. You can use a spot 
color blended with either white or black, however.
When you want to specify a print job to an outside printer, make sure that 
the Print to File check box in the Print dialog box is selected. The program
then prints to a disk file that you can take to your outside printing service.
Otherwise, Publisher uses this printer driver to try to print to your current
printer (which may or may not work, depending on its type).

Selecting paper
Selecting paper for your publication’s printing is a sensual experience that’s
rare in computer land. Paper has texture, heft, thickness, color, shine, bright-
ness (because of fluorescent chemicals), and even smell. I get excited just
thinking about it. (Some would say that it’s because I’ve been locked up in an
office writing this book, but I would disagree. I just love paper — especially
the green kind with presidents’ portraits on it.)
Paper makes up 30 to 50 percent of the total cost of a print job, depending on
the number of copies printed and the type of paper stock chosen. Therefore,
you can greatly affect the cost of printing your publication by carefully select-
ing print stock. Your outside printer service can be a big help in selecting the
right paper for your publication. Most printers keep sample stock around for
you to look at and, in some cases, to test print. Commercial printers have a
great deal of experience with using various types of paper and can tell you
how well a paper takes ink, folds, or reproduces graphics. Nearly all the
larger paper companies distribute sample paper stock kits or paper stock
selectors that are strips of sample paper.
Starting your own sampler collection isn’t a bad idea. PaperDirect (www.
paperdirect.com) will sell you a paper sampler for a $5 shipping-and-
handling fee and refund the money in the form of a coupon on your first
order. Other paper manufacturers might sell, or even give away, their sam-
plers on request.

Chapter 13: Printing, Print Shops, and Paper

Using paper as a design element
When you choose paper for your publication, you must match the paper’s
characteristics to your publication. Paper size, weight, and thickness — and
the methods of measuring these elements — vary with various types of paper.
A paper’s features related to color, texture, and finish are important to con-
sider when you’re deciding on your publication’s best presentation. Please
note that paper quality is a design element that makes a substantial impres-
sion on readers. Here are some guidelines for making a good impression:
 Buy heavier, better paper when your publication will be handled sev-
eral times. A company’s annual report is a good example. If your publi-
cation will be looked at briefly and then thrown away, however, you can
get by with a lightweight, cheaper paper.
 Choose paper color to enhance your publication. The most readable text
is printed on a soft, yellowish-white paper. For the best accuracy with
process colors, use neutral white paper. Brighteners added to paper stock
as fluorescent dyes also alter color fidelities. Be aware that the color of
the paper affects how your ink color appears on the finished product. To
avoid unpleasant surprises, you might want to test the way the ink color
you choose will look when matched with your paper color.
 Print on the side of the paper recommended by the paper manufac-
turer. Paper has a grain that makes one side better for printing; reams 
of paper have a grain indicator on their wrapping with an arrow to indi-
cate which side you should print on. When printing pages, try to keep
the grain parallel to the binding edge, to help readers turn pages and to
keep the pages lying flat.
 Choose paper stock weight and thickness that are appropriate for
your printing device. Laser printers typically have a limit of 60-pound
stock. If you put heavier paper through a laser printer, you can damage
it. Check your printer’s documentation for its requirements. If you’re
printing on two sides of the paper, make sure that your paper is heavy
enough that the type from one side doesn’t show through to the other
side. This bleedthrough can make your publication unattractive and 
difficult to read.
 Select a coated paper if you need a bit more opacity and better resolu-
tion for your printing. Coated paper costs a little more, but this sugges-
tion is particularly important if you’re printing in color or using
photographs. You can buy paper stock that’s coated on one side (C1S)
or on two sides (C2S). C1S is used for labels, packaging, and covers; C2S
is used in books and commercial publications. Coated paper withstands
higher ink coverage and results in blacker blacks, better color fidelity,
and higher resolution. Note that coated paper smudges more easily and
might require varnish to keep the color from coming off on readers’
hands. Also, note that coated paper exhibits less of the printed image
showing through to the opposite side of a page.

More Printing Resources
Printing is a big topic, and I only touch on the subject in this chapter.
Fortunately, some great resources are out there to help you. The best book
on working with the printing industry, how printers (both mechanical and
human) work, and the process of working with printers and graphic arts 
suppliers is Getting It Printed: How to Work With Printers and Graphic Imaging
Services to Assure Quality, Stay on Schedule and Control Costs, 4th Edition, by
Eric Kenly and Mark Beach (How Design Books). This book should be a stan-
dard reference for any desktop publisher.
Another place to read about printing is the more condensed (and dense) book
Pocket Pal: The Handy Little Book of Graphic Arts Production, 19th Edition, by
Michael Bruno (International Paper). You can buy this book at any graphics
supply house. This book gives you many pages of technical details on print-
ing, paper selection, printing inks, type, copy preparation, and dozens more
subjects. It’s particularly valuable for acquiring a detailed, high-level view of
the printing industry; I just couldn’t do without it.

In this part . . .
T
hese days, everyone seems to be talking about the
Internet. You rarely see a television commercial, 
magazine ad, or billboard that doesn’t have a Web site
address plastered on it somewhere (you know, www.send
meyourmoney.com). The two chapters in this part can
help you create a Web site of your very own and publish 
it on the World Wide Web. After all, if I didn’t help you

You don’t know how to write HTML code but you want to create profes-
sional-looking Web pages — Microsoft Publisher 2007 can help. In fact, if
you can click a few buttons, you can create some great-looking Web pages in
minutes! Read on.
Understanding What a Web Site Is
A Web site is a page or group of pages created and published to be viewed on
the Internet — specifically, the World Wide Web. A Web page is simply a docu-
ment encoded using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to describe its
appearance. An HTML document can have hyperlinks — graphics or text that
you can click to move to other documents or other parts of the current docu-
ment. The Web server on which a Web site is published is a computer con-
nected to the Internet running Web server software. For an informational,
step-by-step tutorial on creating Web pages, pick up a copy of Creating Web
Pages For Dummies, 8th Edition, by Bud Smith and Arthur Bebak (Wiley
Publishing).
Creating a Web site is only half the battle. If you want to see your Web site on
the Internet, you have to publish it to the Web. Chapter 15 discusses how to
publish your Web site.

Using the Easy Web Wizard
As I mention in Chapter 1, the easiest way to create a publication in Publisher
is to use a wizard. Creating a Web site is no exception. To use the Easy Web
Wizard, just click Web Sites in the Publication Types list of the Publisher
Catalog on the Getting Started screen. If the Catalog isn’t visible, you can
restore it by choosing File➪New. Figure 14-1 shows the Microsoft Publisher
2007 Catalog displaying Web Site templates, with the Use Easy Web Wizard
option selected in the Options task pane.
After you click Web Sites in the Publication Types list, Publisher offers you 72
styles of Web sites to choose from in the Web Sites pane. Scroll through the
Newer Designs and Classic Designs groups and select the style of the Web
site you want to build, and then click the Create button, in the lower-right
corner of the Microsoft Publisher Catalog dialog box. Be sure that the Use
Easy Web Wizard check box in the Options task pane is selected.
After your computer clicks and grinds for a few seconds (the duration
depends on the speed of your PC), Publisher creates the first page of your
Web site template and shows you the first panel of the Easy Web Wizard, as
shown in Figure 14-2.

Part VI: Publishing on the Internet 

The wizard uses this panel to politely ask which kinds of information you
want your Web site to provide. How nice! Notice that as you select the check
boxes, the wizard adds navigation buttons that represent the corresponding
Web pages. Your choices are
 Tell Customers about My Business
 Tell Customers How to Contact Us
 Sell Products
 Describe Services
 Display a Calendar or Schedule
 Display a List of Projects or Activities
 Display Employee Information
 Provide Links to Other Web Pages
After you select the types of pages to include (by selecting the check boxes),
click OK to have the Easy Web Wizard build your Web pages.
When the Easy Web Wizard finishes building your Web pages, it displays the
first page along with the Format Publication task pane. Click the Preview Your
Web Site link in the Web Site Options to open your Web site in your Web
browser. If you like the way the Web site looks, you’re done!
Okay, unless you really want visitors to your Web site to see the Publisher
2007 Easy Web Wizard placeholder text and graphics, you aren’t done. You
still have to edit the publication to include your information. But you don’t

Chapter 14: Weaving a Web Site

have to change the color scheme or add pages or make any other changes.
When you’re ready to edit the Web Wizard’s placeholder text and graphics
with your own text and graphics, see the section “Adding Text or Picture
Objects,” later in this chapter.
If you decide that you don’t like the template you selected when you started
the Easy Web Wizard, you can easily change it. (You think Staples has the
only Easy button? Publisher has plenty of them!) Follow these steps:
1. On the Web Site Options tab of the Format Publication task pane, click
the Change Template button.
The Change Template dialog box, shown in Figure 14-3, appears.
2. Pick a different template and then click OK.
Publisher displays another dialog box. This one, shown in Figure 14-4, 
is (oddly enough) also named Change Template. In this one, you get to
choose between applying the template to the existing Web site or creat-
ing a new one.
3. After you choose, click OK.
If you select the Apply Template to the Current Publication option,
Publisher applies the template to your publication. If you choose the
Create a New Publication Using My Text and Graphics option, Publisher
creates and opens a new publication. The other publication is still open
and unchanged. You can switch between the publications by using the
Window menu.

Part VI: Publishing on the Internet 

If you’re satisfied with your template choice but realize that you need to add
a page (or multiple pages) to your publication, click the Insert a Page link on
the Web Site Options tab of the Format Publication task pane. In the Insert
Web Page dialog box that appears (see Figure 14-5), select the Web page type
that you want to add. Make sure that the Add Hyperlink to Navigation Bars
check box is selected if you want Publisher to create a navigation button for
your new page, and then click OK.
You can quickly change the fonts used in your Web pages by clicking the Font
Schemes tab in the Format Publication task pane and selecting any of the
fonts in the Apply a Font Scheme list. Publisher instantly applies your choice
to each page in your Web.

Chapter 14: Weaving a Web Site

Changing the color scheme of your Web site is as easy as changing the font
scheme. Click the Color Schemes tab of the Format Publication task pane.
Publisher lets you choose from more than 90 professionally designed color
schemes. Microsoft paid big money to have these color schemes designed, so
it’s hard to go wrong when selecting one. Still, if you can’t decide which color
scheme looks best, stick with the default choice.
Figure 14-6 shows the Color Schemes tab of the Format Publication task pane
with the Verve color scheme selected.
Click the color scheme of your choice. Publisher automatically applies the
selected colors to every page in your Web site.
Navigation bars contain buttons that allow visitors to your Web site to access
the pages of your site. By default, the Easy Web Wizard creates both a verti-
cal navigation bar, usually located to the left of the page, and a horizontal
navigation bar, located at the bottom of the page. To change the type of navi-
gation bar that’s displayed on your Web site (or to remove them altogether),
you have to return to the Change Template dialog box. To do that, select the
Web Site Options tab of the Format Publication task pane and click the Change
Template button. On the Options pane of the Change Template dialog box
(refer to Figure 14-3), click the down arrow next to the Navigation Bar option
and choose the way you want the navigation bar to appear. Your choices are
 Vertical and Bottom
 Horizontal and Bottom

Click OK to display the second Change Template dialog box, and decide
whether you want to change your current Web site or create a new one. 
Click OK again to close the Change Template dialog box.
Unless you’re creating a single-page Web site, adding a navigation bar is a
good idea.
Adding Color and Texture 
to the Background
Template? Check. Color scheme? Check. Navigation bars? Check. Background
fill and sound? Background fill and sound? And you thought you were done!
You’ve seen Web sites with fancy textures or pictures as the page background
behind text. I like plain backgrounds because they make the text easier to
read. However, sometimes a more dramatic background is called for. If you’re
in one of those situations, I’m pleased to inform you that Publisher makes
changing Web page backgrounds a snap! (Well, maybe a click.)
To change the Web page background, click the Page Options tab of the Format
Publication task pane. Figure 14-7 shows what this tab looks like. Click the
Background Fill and Sound link to display the Background task pane, depicted
in Figure 14-8.
Click any of the background samples to immediately apply that pattern to the
Web page that’s displayed. To apply the background to all pages in your Web
site, hover the mouse over the background until you see the down arrow to
the right of the background. Click the down arrow and choose Apply to All
Pages. Click the no-fill background (the white box with the X in the middle) to
remove a background. You can modify the color of all gradient and pattern
backgrounds by selecting one of the Color Scheme colors at the top of the
Background task pane. The More Backgrounds link, at the bottom of the
Backgrounds task pane, gives you access to many more backgrounds.
I like fancy backgrounds with bright colors for Web pages that have just a
little bit of text, but a plain white background works best for Web pages 
with lots of text.

Chapter 14: Weaving a Web Site

While you’re looking at the Background task pane, I might as well tell you
about adding sounds. That way, I can check it off my list. Unless you have a
compelling reason to play a sound when your Web page is opened, I recom-
mend that you skip the sound. Sounds can take a long time to download over
slow dial-up connections, and looping sounds that play over and over can be
annoying. Nothing makes visitors want to move on to another Web site faster
than having to wait for an alma mater fight song to download.

If you’re determined to add a background sound, here’s how it’s done:
1. Click the Background Sound link, at the bottom of the Background
task pane.
This step opens the Web Page Options dialog box, shown in Figure 14-9.
2. In the Background Sound section, in the File Name text box, type the
full path and name of the sound file that you want to play each time
the Web page is opened.
If you don’t know the name and path, click the Browse button to open
the Background Sound dialog box, which you can then use to navigate to
(and select) the sound file you want. Click Open to return to the Web
Page Options dialog box.
3. Still in the Background Sound section, select the Loop Forever radio
button if you want your sound to play continuously. Or, select Loop
and specify how many times the sound should repeat.
Remember that just because you can have the sound repeat as many as
999 times doesn’t mean that you should.
4. Click OK to apply your choices and close the Web Page Options 
dialog box.
You should keep a couple of concepts in mind about Web page background
sounds (other than my recommendation against them). If you want the back-
ground sound to play on more than one Web page, you have to repeat the
preceding set of steps for each of those pages. Also, you can’t hear the
sounds in Publisher. View the Web page in a browser (make sure that your
sound is turned on) to hear the sound. Each time the page is loaded or
refreshed, the sound plays.

If you have an existing publication (a brochure or newsletter, for example)
that you want to place on the Web, you don’t have to re-create it as a Web
site. Open the publication and choose File➪Convert to Web Publication. The
first panel of the Convert to Web Publication Wizard, shown in Figure 14-10,
appears. Decide whether you want Publisher to save your publication before
converting it, and then click Next. In the second panel of the Convert to Web

Adding Text or Picture Objects
Adding text or pictures to your Web site is pretty simple. In fact, if you have
added text or pictures to a Publisher publication, you already know how to
add them to your Web site. If you used the Easy Web Wizard to create your
Web site, you probably have several text and picture frames in your publica-
tion. (Did I call your Web site a publication? I guess so.)
I strongly recommend that you use the Easy Web Wizard to create your Web
site. It’s much easier, in my opinion, to create the site by using the wizard and
change what you don’t like than it is to create the Web site from scratch.
Adding text
To change the placeholder text that the wizard put in your publication, just
highlight the text and start typing.
If you don’t have any text boxes or don’t want to change the text in an exist-
ing text box, just create a new one:
1. Click the Text Box tool.
2. Draw the text box.
3. Start typing.
The Easy Web Wizard does a reasonably good job of designing the Web page,
but feel free to add, delete, or move objects as you see fit.
Adding pictures
To change a picture on your Web page, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the picture.
The Clip Art task pane appears, and you can select a new picture for
your Web page.
2. In the Search For box, type a word or phrase that describes the clip
art you’re looking for.
3. Choose a collection, and then click a specific category in the list box
located to the left of the pictures, if you want.
If you aren’t sure which collection to choose, pick All Collections to
create the largest number of results.

Chapter 14: Weaving a Web Site

4. Scroll as necessary and then click the picture you want.
5. Click the down arrow next to the clip art image you want and choose
Insert from the menu that appears.
You return to your Web site.
The procedure for adding a new picture to a Web site is the same as the pro-
cedure for adding a new picture to any publication. Adding new pictures is
covered in detail in Chapter 9.
Adding and Removing Hyperlinks
Hyperlinks allow the person viewing your Web site to click an object (text or
a graphic) and jump to another document on your Web site or elsewhere on
the Internet, or to send an e-mail.
Adding hyperlinks
You can add a hyperlink to an object on your Web page in several ways: Add
hyperlinks to text, pictures, WordArt, and even the contents of table frames.
To add a hyperlink to text box or a table frame, you must first select the indi-
vidual text that you want to hyperlink. Selecting just the text box or table
frame doesn’t work.
Follow these steps to create a hyperlink:
1. Select the object to which you want to add a hyperlink.
2. Pick one of these methods: Choose Insert➪Hyperlink, choose
Hyperlink from the context menu, click the Insert Hyperlink button
on the Standard toolbar, or press Ctrl+K.
No matter which method you choose, the Insert Hyperlink dialog box,
shown in Figure 14-12, appears.
3. Select the type of hyperlink you want from the Link To section.
You can choose one of four types of hyperlinks:
• Existing File or Web Page: You need to supply the URL (Uniform
Resource Locator, or address) of the document the hyperlink 
connects to.
• Place in This Document: Select the appropriate page in your Web site.
• Create New Document: Choose to edit the new document now or later.
• E-Mail Address: Supply an e-mail address.

Part VI: Publishing on the Internet 

4. Depending on which type of hyperlink you choose, you may need 
to browse to the file you want to link to or type an address in the
Address box.
The Insert Hyperlink dialog box changes, depending on the type of
hyperlink you select in the Link To section.
5. After selecting the type of hyperlink you want and the location it
points to, click OK.
Removing hyperlinks
Removing a hyperlink from an object is a snap:
1. Select the object from which you want to remove a hyperlink.
2. Pick a method: Choose Insert➪Hyperlink, click the Insert Hyperlink
button on the Standard toolbar, or press Ctrl+K.
This step opens the Edit Hyperlink dialog box, which looks much like
the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.
3. Click the Remove Link button in the Edit Hyperlink dialog box.
The Hyperlink dialog box closes, and your hyperlink is removed.
If you’re a fan of right-clicking, you can right-click the hyperlink and choose
Remove Hyperlink from the context menu that appears.

In This Chapter
 Previewing a Web site
 Publishing your Web site
S
o you created a stunning Web site and you’re wondering what you
should do with it. You have come to the right place! In this chapter, I
describe how to preview your Web site in your Web browser and then pub-
lish your site.
Previewing Your Web Site
After you create your Web site, you have to preview it to make sure that it
meets your expectations before you go to the trouble of publishing it for 
the entire world to see. You also need to make sure that it looks the way 
you intended and that all the hyperlinks function correctly.
You must have Web browser software installed and configured in order to
preview a Web site.
To preview your Web site, choose File➪Web Page Preview or press Ctrl+
Shift+B. You can also click the Preview Your Web Site link on the Web Site
Options tab of the Format Publication task pane. Microsoft Publisher 2007
opens your default Web browser and displays the first page of your Web 
site. Click the hyperlinks to make sure that they function properly, and view
the other pages (if any) of your site. When you finish viewing your site, close
your Web browser. You return to Publisher.
Figure 15-1 shows a sample Web site being previewed in Internet Explorer.
Notice that the address in the Address box points to a file on a local drive.

Publishing Your Web Site
What’s the difference between previewing your Web site and publishing it?
When you preview your Web site, Publisher opens the site on your computer
and shows you how it will look when it’s published on the Internet.
Publishing a Web site entails copying it to a computer running Web server
software that’s connected to the Internet — it’s there for all the world to see.
Publisher gives you two options for publishing your Web site to the Internet:
 Publish to a location on the Internet.
 Publish with File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
Before publishing your Web pages for the entire world to see, run Publisher’s
Design Checker to find and fix any problems. Here’s how to open the Design
Checker:
1. Choose Tools➪Design Checker.
2. In the Design Checker task pane, select both the Run General Design
Checks and Run Web Site Checks check boxes. Deselect the Run
Commercial Printing Checks check box.
Figure 15-1:

a Web site

Part VI: Publishing on the Internet 

As soon as you select the type of check to run, the Design Checker starts
looking for problems and displays anything that it thinks is a problem in
the Select an Item to Fix box of the Design Checker.
3. Click an item’s down arrow in the Select an Item to Fix box to see
options for resolving the issue.
If you aren’t sure what the problem is with an item in the Select an Item
to Fix box, choose Explain from the drop-down menu. The Publisher
Help screen opens with detailed information about the problem item.
4. Click Close Design Checker when you’re finished.
See Chapter 12 for the complete run down on the Design Checker.
Publishing to a Web location
Publishing your Web site to a folder on your computer and copying it using
FTP software is the easiest way to publish to the Web. To publish your Web
site on the Internet, you must have Internet access. Most people access the
Internet from home by connecting to an Internet service provider, or ISP. If
you don’t have access to the Internet, you can still publish your Web site to a
local drive, which creates all the HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, doc-
uments and image files and allows you to copy the files to the Internet later.
Before using the following procedure, make sure that you have all the infor-
mation you need from your ISP. You need the URL, or address, where you can
save files. You also need a username and password.
To publish your Web site to a local drive, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Publish to the Web.
The message box shown in Figure 15-2 reminds you that you need to have
a Web site host in order to publish your Web site. Publisher provides a
handy link to a Web site that tells you how to find a Web host. If you
already have a Web host, feel free to select the Don’t Show This Message
Again check box.
Figure 15-2:
Reminder:
You need a
Web host in
order to
publish your
Web site.
321
Chapter 15: Getting Published (On the Internet)

2. Click OK.
The Publish to the Web dialog box, shown in Figure 15-3, appears.
3. Type the URL, provided to you by your Internet service provider, of
the Web site where you want Publisher to save your Web site files,
and then click Save.
4. If prompted, enter the username and password you received from
your Web host or network administrator.
This step connects you to your Web host server.
5. Select the folder that will contain your Web site and double-click the
file to open it.
6. Click Save.
Publishing your Web site 
by using an FTP location
FTP, in the Internet world, is short for File Transfer Protocol, a protocol for
exchanging files over the Internet. As I mention earlier in this chapter, pub-
lishing your Web site to a folder on your computer and copying it by using
FTP software is the easiest way to publish to the Web.
To save your Web site to the Internet using FTP, you must tell Publisher about
your FTP site:
1. Choose File➪Publish to the Web.
If a reminder about needing a Web host appears, click the OK button.
Otherwise, you see the Publish to the Web dialog box.
Figure 15-3:
The Publish
to the Web
dialog box.
322
Part VI: Publishing on the Internet 

2. Click the down arrow on the Save In drop-down list and choose
Add/Modify FTP Locations.
The Add/Modify FTP Locations dialog box, shown in Figure 15-4, appears.
3. Type the URL of your FTP site in the Name of FTP Site box.
Your Internet service provider or Web server administrator should be
able to furnish you with this info.
4. If necessary, click the User radio button, and type your username and
password.
5. Click Add to add the FTP site to your list of FTP locations.
The FTP site you added appears in the FTP Sites list.
6. Click OK to close the Add/Modify FTP Locations dialog box.
7. Click Cancel to close the Open dialog box.
After you add an FTP site, you can publish your Web site by using an FTP
location:
1. Choose File➪Publish to the Web.
If the reminder about needing a Web host appears, click the OK button.
Otherwise, you see the Publish to the Web dialog box.
2. Click the down arrow next to the Save In list box and choose FTP
Locations.
3. Double-click the FTP location and then double-click the folder in
which you want to store your Web site.
4. Click OK to have Publisher copy your Web site to the selected FTP
location.

The Add/
Modify FTP
Locations
dialog box.

Chapter 15: Getting Published (On the Internet)

The amount of time it takes to copy your Web site to your Web server depends
on factors such as the speed of your connection to the Internet, the number of
pages in your Web site, the number of pictures on those pages, and the speed
of the Web server. Try to be patient.
Now that you have published your Web site, you should take a look at it live,
over the Internet, to make sure that it looks the way you intended and that all
links and buttons function as expected. The URL of your Web site is the same
URL to which you published the Web site.
Publishing to a folder on your computer
You may want to publish your Web site to a folder on your computer in addi-
tion to publishing it to the Web, for these reasons:
 You can test your Web site by using the locally published files before
publishing to the Web.
 You keep a local copy of your HTML files as well as your Web publication.
To save your Web site to your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Publish to the Web.
If the reminder about needing a Web host appears, click the OK button.
Otherwise, you see the Publish to the Web dialog box.
2. In the Publish to the Web dialog box, navigate to a folder and click
Save.
When Publisher publishes your Web pages to the Internet, it creates a special
version of the files — smaller versions that load faster than typical Web page
files, which works well for everyone who visits your Web site. But because
the files are “special,” you cannot edit the copy directly. If you need to make
changes to the Web pages, you should open the original publication and
make your changes and then publish it to the Internet again.

Ten Great Design Ideas
In This Chapter
 Keep your design simple and consistent
 Draw attention with your use of graphics
 Create the best effect with text frames
 Get feedback
C
onsider these ten general design tips for all your publications.
Borrow the Best Ideas of Others
Ideas cannot be copyrighted, but designs can. The more people you borrow
from, the more original it makes you!
Design the Publication with 
Your Audience in Mind
Your audience is more likely to read your work if it’s relevant and appeals 
to them.
Use a Design Grid
Create a grid guide and align your page elements to it, to impose consistency
on your pages. See Chapter 4 for information on how to work with grids.

Use Pictures Well
Pictures are attention getters. If your picture tells your story, your readers
get the point more quickly if they see the picture. Give it an appropriate 
caption and group the two (picture and caption) together. It’s an excellent
way to get your story noticed.
Check Out the Design Gallery
The Design Gallery has many attractive page elements and other excellent
stuff you can use: headlines, sidebars, pull quotes, ornaments, and tables of
contents, for example, in several great styles. Use these elements and the
Drop Cap feature to break up pages and make them interesting. If you don’t
find what you like, create your own Design Gallery category and store your
own, favorite design elements. You may want to flip over to Chapter 9 for
more help in transforming your design into a masterpiece!
Use Master Pages
Put repeating design elements on your master pages. If you put items on the
master pages, you don’t have to repeat them on every page, and you can’t
mistakenly delete them or move them. Master pages help ensure consistency
throughout your publication and — more important — cut down on your
design time. Chapter 4 tells you how to make the most of master pages.
Keep It Simple, Silly!
KISS is a guiding design principle. Simplicity can be elegant, and it lets the
reader focus on your message. Make your design consistent and simple to
follow by using repetitive elements well.
Create Templates and Use Them
Any design that stands up to time deserves repeating. Save work you like as a
template, and then use templates as starting points. Microsoft spent lots of
time and money on professional designers to create the sample designs
included in Publisher. Make yourself look good — use them.
328
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Use Multicolumn Text Boxes
If you use multicolumn text boxes rather than lots of single-column text boxes,
you have fewer objects on your layout to worry about. Text autoflows easily,
columns align without strife, and your life flows as smoothly as water flows
downhill to the sea.
Live with Your Designs Awhile
Revisiting the scene of the crime is an excellent way of improving your publi-
cation: Go back and take another critical look at your work. If you can, show
your publication’s page proofs to others and get their comments.

Ten Design Blunders
In This Chapter
 Sending the wrong message
 Failing to communicate with your print service
 Creating underdone or overdone designs
 Printing too little or too much
 Going overboard on expenses
 Violating copyrights
B
e on the lookout for these ten design blunders in all your publications.
Not Designing Your Publication 
for the Right Audience
Not designing your publication for the right audience is the design-blunder
equivalent of sending an invitation to file your publication in the circular file
(the wastebasket). For example, if you’re creating a corporation’s annual
report, using the Zapf Dingbats font might be deemed an RGE (résumé-
generating event).
Not Communicating with Your Print
Service Early in the Project
You can prevent a whole range of design blunders by consulting with your
print broker or print service from the beginning of your project. For example,
some print colors may not be available from your print service.

Using the Wrong Printer Driver
Congratulations! Using the wrong printer driver during the design process
gives you the opportunity to reformat your entire document.
Using Too Little White Space
Well-designed publications leave 50 percent of the page for white space. Using
less makes your publication seem “busy” and hard to read. That amount might
seem like a lot of unused real estate, but it’s not, when you consider elements
such as margins and the gutter space between columns.
Making Your Publication 
Too Complicated
A “busy” page with many different design elements can distract readers from
the important points of your message. Highlight the important parts of your
publication so that readers look at what you want them to see. A common
problem is using too many fonts, which creates a “ransom note” effect on
your page.
Making Your Pages Too Boring!
Mama always told me that variety is the spice of life. Spice up your pages —
add contrast. Add graphics, drop or raised caps, color, rules, and other design
elements meant to break up a repetitive page design. This advice is particu-
larly important for long publications that use similar page styles. However,
Mama also told me that too much of a good thing is, well, too much of a good
thing! Publisher provides you with lots of cool design tools to use — just
don’t try to use all of them on any single page!
Printing Too Many or Too Few Copies
Printing too many or too few copies of your publication is easy to do, but
either case can cause you grief. Try diligently to print the appropriate
number of copies. Think hard about just how many copies of a publication
332
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

are required for your work. For example, try to calculate how many people
walking past your trade show booth are likely to pick up your flyer or how
many copies of the brochure you will mail out.
Designing a Publication 
That’s Too Expensive
It’s easy to overrun your publication’s budget. When you’re designing your
piece, try to substitute less expensive elements or processes. For example,
don’t use process color if you can’t afford it or don’t need it. Use spot colors
instead. If you’re not sure exactly what your final product will cost, you prob-
ably should discuss the various pricing options with your print service
before you get started rather than wait for your final bill to arrive!
Violating Copyright Laws
Know the source of your graphics, designs, and text, and know your rights to
use them. Feel free to use the Publisher templates and clip art in your publi-
cations; however, do not “borrow” graphics that appear on someone’s Web
site unless you have the owner’s permission to use them.
Scanning Your Files at 
the Wrong Resolution
Be resolution-appropriate. Don’t waste hard drive space and processing time
by scanning a graphic at a high resolution when you’re printing at a low reso-
lution. But don’t scan the graphic at a low resolution when you’re printing in
high resolution; the image will look coarse and inappropriate.

Check before Printing
In This Chapter
 Pack for the print service
 Run the Design Checker
 Verify the correct printer driver
 Keep your endings intact
T
o make your printing process roll smoothly, check out the following
advice before you try to print.
Give Color Separations 
to Your Print Service
Print a set of color separations for your publication and give it to your print
service. To do this, set up your publication to print to a print service and
choose File➪Print to open the Print dialog box. Click the Advanced Printer
Setup button on the Printer Details tab of the Print dialog box. On the
Separations tab, select Separations from the Print Colors As drop-down menu
and then click OK. Publisher prints one page for each color in your publication.
Show Your Publication Around
Show your publication to several people. The more eyes that see it, the
greater the chance that mistakes will get noticed.

Use the Pack and Go Wizard
You can use the Pack and Go Wizard to prepare your publication to take to a
commercial printer. You can choose to have the wizard embed TrueType
fonts and include your graphics so that you don’t forget to take them with
you. (Chapter 13 has more on the Pack and Go Wizard.)
Give Your Print Service 
All Original Materials
Make sure that you collect in your submission all the original materials your
publication needs. If your print service requires a photograph or drawing for
reference, don’t forget to include it.
Run the Design Checker
I don’t like hidden objects, empty frames, and other page elements that don’t
print properly. And, I have a devil of a time finding them without this useful
tool. Choose Tools➪Design Checker to run the Design Checker. It does an
excellent job of identifying problems in your publication and helping you 
fix them.
Specify the Correct Printer Driver
Ensure that you have specified the correct printer driver for your publication
and your printer. In other words, make sure that you’re submitting the print
job formatted for the printer that will print it. The current printer driver shows
up in the Name list box of the Print Setup dialog box.
Use Printing Marks on Master Copies
Make sure that your master copies have crop marks on them. Crop marks let
the print service know exactly where the paper will be cut. These marks help
immensely in preparing the final printed matter quickly and correctly.
336
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Check for the End of the Story
As you reformat text boxes, you can easily — and accidentally — move text at
the end of your story so that it’s out of view. To keep this situation from affect-
ing your final publication, ensure that all story endings are properly included
on their last connected text boxes. One way to do this is to check the continu-
ation mark on the last frame of a story. (And no, this is not the end of this
story.)

Ten Questions for 
Your Print Service
In This Chapter
 Establishing whether a print service can work with you
 Finding out timeframes and fees
 Getting references
A
sk the following questions as you screen and select a print service.
Do You Work with Microsoft 
Publisher 2007?
Publisher has been around for quite a few years now. Although it isn’t as 
popular as some of the more complex desktop publishing packages, it’s still
worth asking about. If your commercial print service uses Publisher 2007,
producing the output you expect will probably be a simple task. Just use the
Pack and Go Wizard and give the print service a copy of your publication.
How Do You Want to Receive My Files?
If your print service can’t work with Publisher files, does it need or want EPS
or PDF files? A service can work with Publisher files only if it has a copy of
the program on hand. Many print services don’t keep Publisher around.
Therefore, you can give shops without Publisher an EPS of PDF file that they
can print as is, without having the program on hand. The disadvantage of
using these files is that the print service cannot always make changes to the
file if a problem arises.

What’s Your Usual Turnaround Time?
When do you need your publication, and what will you be charged if you need
it quicker? This question helps you plan your production and submission
schedule.
What Kind of Imagesetter Do You Use?
This question tells you the particular printer driver to use. Publisher has a
generic imagesetter driver named MS Imagesetter. If you know the particular
imagesetter that your print service has, however, using the real printer driver
(for that imagesetter) produces superior results and fewer errors.
Which Kind of Equipment Do 
You Have in Your Shop?
Does the print service have a high-quality scanner, a Xerox DocuTech Publisher
high-volume printer, or a color laser copier? The type of equipment that the
service has available factors into the price and the kind of work that the print
service can do.
Do You Have the Fonts 
in My Publication?
If not, you need to supply the fonts or avoid using ones that the print service
doesn’t have. Without all your required fonts available, the print service may
give you printed output that has substitute fonts in place of the ones you
specified in Publisher.
Do You Have the Creator Applications 
for the EPS Graphics I Create?
Without the creator application (one that can create new EPS or PDF files),
your print service cannot correct any problems in your files. The printed
results are your responsibility.
340
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

How Much Do You Charge?
Get a quote in writing — it’s your insurance that you pay for what you get
and get what you pay for. Most print services print an overage, a specific
number of copies above your print order, to be on the safe side. Some services
charge for the overage — make sure that you know when they do. An overage
charge of more than 15 percent of the print price is excessive.
Can You Outsource the 
Work You Can’t Do?
If your print service works with commercial printers and other businesses,
you can use that single source to manage your entire print job and save you
hassles and headaches.
Can You Give Me Some References?
Who are the print service’s clients? Is the shop happy with the work? Ask to
see samples of the printed work.

Ten Ways to Save 
on Printing Costs
In This Chapter
 Find the right print service
 Get competitive bids
 Look for bargains
 Do as much of the work yourself as possible
L
ook over these money-saving tips for ideas to help you save on 
printing expenses.
Talk to Your Print Service
Printers know how to save you money. Specify your budget, and then ask
how to meet it. Also ask what else you can do to lower your costs.
Choose an Appropriate Print Service
Get recommendations for a print service from other people, and choose 
a service that’s appropriate to the kind of printing you do. Each printing
establishment specializes in a particular kind of printing. Some are good at
low- or high-volume printing; others specialize in careful color work. Select 
a print service accordingly.

Solicit Three Written Bids for a Print Job
Get competitive bids for your print job. Make the process meaningful by pro-
viding a complete disclosure of your printing requirements. Select the print
service whose bid seems the most reasonable, and get everything in writing:
deadlines, delivery, and storage costs, for example. Don’t necessarily select
the cheapest bid, but don’t overpay, either.
Make a Careful Paper Selection
You can find paper bargains out there if you try. Let your print service help
you make a paper selection.
Provide Your Print Service 
with Everything It Needs
The further you can go in the printing process, the less you pay and the 
fewer variables can make things go wrong. If you can, supply your commercial
printer with camera-ready art and copies of your fonts. If you’re using a custom
color, supply the Pantone color, too.
Ask for a Cash Discount
If you pay immediately with cash, you should pay less. Hey, it’s worth a try.
Don’t Print Close to Your Deadline
Don’t cut your deadline too close; leave some time for back-and-forth 
discussions between you and the print service. For example, if you have
enough time, you can request a press proof and examine it. That way, you 
see a sample printed with the inks and press that your service will be using
for your print job, and you can check it carefully for errors.
344
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Use Special Paper to Print in Color 
without Having to Print in Color
Although the paper from PaperDirect (www.paperdirect.com) is more
expensive than common stock, you can run its colored designs through an
inkjet or laser printer and do short-run printing. You can get outstanding
results, and only other desktop publishers will know that you did it. I won’t
tell — honest.
Use a Print Broker for Large 
or Expensive Print Jobs
Is your print job especially large, expensive, or complicated? Using a print
broker can save you money if your job falls into one of these two categories.
A print broker is a middleman who works between a customer and a print
manufacturer. Brokers work as free agents and have the flexibility to repre-
sent several companies for you. You would expect your rep to add value to
your print project through effective planning and management. You rely on
that person’s judgment on timing and knowledge of manufacturing materials
and processes and workflow issues.
Minimize the Amount of Setup 
Work Your Printer Must Do
If your printer has a three-color printing press, don’t use four colors. That
requires an extra print run and will cost you more money.
