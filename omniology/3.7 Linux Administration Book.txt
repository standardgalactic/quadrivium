Chapter#1 - User and Group Administration 
1. 
What is a user? 
 
In Linux user is one who uses the system.  
 
2. 
How many types of users available in Linux? 
 
There are 5 types of users available in Linux. 
(i)   System user   (Admin user who control the whole system nothing but root user). 
(ii)  Normal user  (Created by the Super user. In RHEL - 7 the user id's from 1000 - 60000). 
(iii) System user   (Created when application or software installed ). 
(In RHEL - 7 the System users are  
Static system user id's from 1 - 200 and   
(ii) Dynamic system user user id'sfrom 201 - 999). 
(iv) Network user   (Nothing but remote user, ie., who are login to the system trough network  
created  
in Windows Active Directory or in Linux LDAP or NIS). 
(v)  Sudo user   (The normal users who are having admin or Super user privileges)

3. 
What is user management? 
 
User management means managing user. ie., Creating the users, deleting the users and modifying  
          the users.

4. 
What are the important points related to users? 
 Users and groups are used to control access to files and resources. 
 Users can login to the system by supplying username and passwords to the system. 
 Every file on the system is owned by a user and associated with a group. 
 Every process has an owner and group affiliation. 
 Every user in the system is assigned a unique user id (uid) and group id (gid). 
 User names and user id are stored in  /etc/passwd   file. 
 User's passwords are stored in  /etc/shadow  file in an encrypted form. 
 Users are assigned a home directory and a shell to work with the O/S. 
 Users cannot read, write and execute each other's files without permission. 
 Whenever a user is created a mail box is created automatically in /var/spool/mail  location. 
 And some user environmental files like  .bash_logout,  .bash_profile,  .bashrc ,  ...etc., are also copied 
from /etc/skell   to  his/her home directory (/home/<username>). 
 
5. 
What are fields available in  /etc/passwd file? 
 
<user name>   :   x   :   <uid>   :   <gid>   :   <comment>   :   <user's home directory>   :   <login shell> 
 
(where   'x'   means link to password file ie.,  /etc/shadow   file) 
 
6. 
What are fields available in  /etc/shadow  file? 
 
user name : password : last changed : min. days : max. days : warn days : inactive days : expiry days :  
           reserved  for future  
 
7. 
What are the files that are related to user management? 
 /etc/passwd  -----> Stores user's information like user name, uid, home directory and shell ...etc., 
 /etc/shadow  ----> Stores user's password in encrypted form and other information. 
 /etc/group  ------> Stores group's information like group name, gid and other information. 
 /etc/gshadow ---> Stores group's password in encrypted form. 
 /etc/passwd-  ---> Stores the  /etc/passwd   file backup copy. 
 /etc/shadow- ---> Stores the /etc/shadow  file backup copy. 
 /etc/default/useradd  ----> Whenever the user created user's default settings taken from this file. 
 /etc/login.defs  ----> user's login defaults settings information taken from this file.  
 /etc/skell   ------> Stores user's all environmental variables files and these are copied from this directory 
to user's home directory. 
 
8. 
In how many ways can we create the users? 
 (i)   # useradd    - <options><user name> 
 (ii)  # adduser    - <options><user name> 
 (iii) # newusers    <file name>   (In this file we have to enter the user details same as /etc/passwd   file) 
 
9. 
What is the syntax ofuseradd command with full options? 
 
 # useradd  -u <uid>  -g <gid>  -G <secondary group> -c  <comment>  -d <home directory> -s <shell><user  
           name> 
 
Example :  # useradd  -u  600  -g  600  -G  java   -c  "oracle user"   -d  /home/raju   -s  /bin/bash    raju 
 
10. What is the syntax of adduser  command with full options?

11. What is the syntax of newuser command? 
 
# newusers   <file name> (This command will create multiple users at a time) 
* First we should a file and enter user's data as fields same as the fields of /etc/passwd file for how 
many users do you want to create and mention that file as an argument for newusers command. 
 
*   When we execute this command new users will be created but their environmental files like    
           .bash_logout,   .bash_profile,  .bashrc   and  .bash_history  files will not be copied from /etc/skell   
           directory. So, we have to  copied manually from  /etc/skell   directory. 
 
12. What is the syntax of userdel command with full options? 
 
# userdel     <options><user name> 
 
 *  The options are, 
   -f  ----->   forcefully delete the user even through the user is login. The user's home directory, mail and 
message directories are also deleted.

also deleted but the other files belongs to that user should be   deleted manually. 
 
13. How to check whether user is already created or not? 
 
We can check in different ways. 
 
(i)   # id   <user name> 
(It shows the user id group id and user name if that is already created) 
 
(ii)  # grep <user name> /etc/passwd 
 
14. How to verify or check the integrity of the password file?

      -r  ------>   read only  
                                   --s  ------>   sort the contents by uidin /etc/passwd and  /etc/shadow  files. 
 
15. How to verify or check the integrity of the group file? 
 
# grpck   <options>   /etc/group    or

consists  
 the user's environmental variables.  
.bashrc :  This file is used to create the user's custom commands and to specify the umask values for 
that user's  only. 
 
20. What is a group? 
 
The collection of users is called a group. There are two types of groups. 
 
Primary group : It will be created automatically whenever the user is created. User belongs to on group  
          is called as  primary group. 
 
Secondary group :  It will not create automatically. The admin user should be created manually and  
          users belongs to more than one group is called secondary group. A user can be assigned to max. 16  
          groups. ie., 1 primary group and 15 secondary groups.

24. What is syntax to delete the group? 
 
# groupdel     <group name> 
(to delete the group without options) 
 
# groupdel    -R    <group name> (to delete the group and apply changes to the root directory)   
 
25. How to assign the password to the group? 
 
# gpasswd     <group name> 
(to assign a password to the group without any options)  
 
# gpasswd     <options><group name>

26. How to check the integrity or consistency of the group? 
 
# grpck (it will check the integrity or consistency in  /etc/gpasswd   and   /etc/gshadow   files) 
 
27. How to restore  /etc/gshadow file if deleted by mistake? 
 
# grpconv 
(it creates the  /etc/gshadow   file  from   /etc/group   file) 
 
28. How to change the password aging policies? 
 
we can change the password policies in 2 ways. 
 
(i)  First  open the  /etc/login.defs   file and modify the current values. 
 
Example :  # vim /etc/login.defs 
min - 0  ----->   means the user can change the password to any no. of times. 
min - 2  ----->   means the user can change the password within 2 days. ie., he can change the  
 
  
 
            password after 2 days. 
max - 5  ----->   means the user should change the password before or after 5 days. Otherwise the  
             
                         password will be expired after 5 days. 
 
inactive - 2  ----->  means after password expiry date the grace period another 2 days will be given to  
 
     change the password. 
 
warning - 7 ----->  means a warning will be given to the user about the password expiry 7 days before  
 
   expiry date.  
 
(ii)  second by executing the   # chage  command. 
 
Example :  # chage   <options><user name> 
 
  
The options are,   -d   ----->   last day 
 
  
 
 
    -E   ----->   expiry date 
 
  
 
 
    -I    ----->   inactive days 
 
  
 
 
    -l    ----->   list all the policies 
 
  
 
 
   -m   ----->   min. days 
 
  
 
 
   -M   ----->   max. days 
 
  
 
 
   -w   ----->   warning days

Note :  Whenever we change the password aging policy using    
           # chage   command, the information is  
           will be  modified in   /etc/shadow   file. 
 
29. How add 45 days to the current system date? 
 
# date   -d    "+  45 days" 
 
30. Explain the sudo user? 
Sudoers  (nothing but sudo users)  allows particular users to run various root user commands without 
needing a root password.  
/etc/sudoers   is the configuration file for sudoers to configure the normal user as privileged user.  
It is not recommended to open this file using    # vim    editor because this editor cannot check the syntax 
by default and whatever we typed in that file that will blindly save in this file. 
So, one editor is specially available for opening this file, i.e.,   # visudo   and all normal users cannot 
execute this command. Only root user can run this command. 
Once this file is opened nobody can open this file again on another terminal because "The file is 
busy"message is displayed on the terminal for security reasons. 
 
31. How to give different  sudo permissions to normal users? 
 
Open the   /etc/sudoers    file by executing   
           #visudo    command and go to line no. 98 and type as  
 
<User name> 
<Machine>= 
<Command> 
 
       root  
      ALL=(ALL)         ALL 
 
      raju  
      All=  
        ALL 
 
----Save and exit this file. 
 
          Note :  When we trying to save this file if any syntax errors in this file, those errors are displayed with  
          line no's and   
 
          What you do ?  (will be displayed, here press  'e'  to edit this file and modify those errors or mistakes and  
          save this file. 
 
# su   -  raju 
(to switch to raju user) 
 
# sudo   useradd   <useradd> 
(The normal user raju can also add the users to the system) 
*  We can assign sudo permissions to  'n'  no. of users by specifying names separated by commas ( , ) 
or line by   line. 
 
*   Instead of giving all permissions to normal user we can give only some commands. 
 
 
  
Example :    student 
ALL=/usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/sbin/usermod 
 
  
        raju 
ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/sbin/usermod 
 
*   We can also apply to one group or groups as follows. 
*   First create the users, assign one group to those users and also assign the passwords for that users. 
 
 Open  /etc/sudoers    file by  executing the command   
 
  
 # visudo    and type as follows.

%<group name> 
ALL=ALL 
 
  
%oracle 
 
 
ALL=ALL   or  individual commands separated by commas, 
           *   We can also create one command alias and add some commands to that alias and mention that alias  
            to users as follows.  
 
 Cmnd_Alias 
NETWORKING=/usr/sbin/route, 
  /usr/sbin/ifconfig 
 
 <user name> <machines>=<command alias name> 
 
 raju 
 
ALL=NETWORKING 
          *   We can also create one user alias and add the users to that alias and assign some commands to that  
             alias as follows. 
 
User_Alias 
<user alias name>=<user1>, <user2>, <user3>, ..... 
 
Example : 
User_Alias 
OURTEAM=raju, shyam, ram, gopal 
OURTEAM 
ALL=ALL         
(to give all permissions of sudo) 
Defaults  timestamp_timeout=0      (whenever the sudo user executes any command then it will ask 
password every command) 
*  The above will apply to all users including root also. If we want to make it as only for normal users, 
then 
Defaults  :  <user1>, <user2>, <user3>  timestamp_timeout=0 
(the system will ask passwords for 
user1, user2, user3 to execute sudo commands)  
   
32. In which location the sudo  user commands history is logged? 
 
All the sudo users commands history is logged in   /var/log/secure   file to make a record of sudo user 
 
commands. 
 
# cat   /var/log/secure 
(to see the contents of this file) 
 
# tailf   /var/log/secure (to see the updates of this file continuously and press  ctrl + c to quit the tailf) 
 
33. How to assign the password to normal user by him whenever first login to the system? 
Whenever the user is created and that user is trying to login to the system, it will ask the password. If 
the root user is not assign the password to that user, then that normal user can assign the password by 
his own using the following commands. 
 
# useradd    <user name>  
(to create the user) 
          # passwd  -S   <user name> 
(to see the status of the password of that user. if root user is not     
                                                                 assigned the password then the password status is  locked) 
 
# passwd  -d    <user name> 
(then delete the password for that user) 
 
# chage    -d   0   <user name> 
(it will change the password age policy) 
          # su   -   <user name> 
 
(Try to switch to that user then it will display the following  
message) 
 
   Newpassword :  
 
(type new password for that user) 
 
   Retype password : 
 
(retype the password again) 
 
34. The other useful commands : 
 
#  w 
(this command gives the login user information like how many users currently login and full  
information ) 
 
# who 
 
(to see users who are currently login and on which terminal they login) 
 
# last    (see the list of users who are login and logout since the  /var/log/wtmp  file was created)

                                                                                 command) 
 
*  grep:   It is used to search a word or sentence in file (ie., inside the file) 
 
*  find :    It is used to search a command or file inside the system) 
 
# cat  /etc/shells   or   # chsh   -l   (to see how many shells that are supported by Linux)

40. What are the default permissions of a file and directory? 
 
The default permissions of a file = 6 6 6 
 
The default permissions of a directory = 7 7 7 
 
41. What is umask in linux? 
 

SUVEN IT        Linux Administration       -An Admin Choice
 
 
 
 
SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|12 
 
 
The user file-creation mode mask (umask) is used to determine the file permissions for newly created 
files or  directories. It can be used to control the default file or directory permissions for new files. It is 
a four-digit octal  
number.  The umask value for normal user is 0002 and the umask value for 
root user is 0022. 
 
So, the effected file permissions for normal users  = 6 6 6   -   0 0 2  =   6 6 4. 
 
The effected directory permissions for normal users  = 7 7 7  -  0 0 2  =  7 7 5. 
 
The effected file permissions for root user  = 6 6 6   -   0 2 2   =   6 4 4 
 
The effected directory permissions for root user  =  7 7 7  -  0 2 2   =   7 5 5 
 
# umask <value> 
 
(to change the umask value temporarily) 
# vim   /etc/bashrc 
 
(open this file and change the umask value to effect the whole system) 
 
# source   /etc/bashrc 
(to updated the source file) 
 
# vim  .bashrc 
 
(open this file in user's home directory and at last type as follows) 
 
  umask <value> 
(save and exit the file) 
 
# source   .bashrc   or  logout and login again  
(to the system to effect that umask value) 
 
*  If the/etc/login.defs    file is corrupted then new users will be added and can be assigned the 
 
                  passwords  but  
     users cannot login. 
 
*   If the   /etc/login.defs   file is deleted then new users cannot be added. 
 
42. How change the permissions using numeric representation? 
 
The values for  read = 4,  write = 2,  execute = 1  and  null = 0.  The total value = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 
 
# chmod    <no.><no.><no.><file name  or  directory name> 
Example :   # chmod   7 7 4    file1 
(to give read, write and execute to owner and read, write  
 and execute to     group and read permission to others) 
 
# chmod   6 6 0   file2 (to give read and write to owner and read and write to group and null (0)  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
      permission to others) 
 
43. Explain about set uid (suid)? 
 
If we plan to allow all the users to execute the root users command then we go for set uid (suid). 
 
It can be applied for user level and is applicable for files only. 
 
# chmod    u+s    <file name> 
(to set the suid on that file) 
 
# chmod    u-s     <file name> 
(to remove the suid from that file) 
# ls   -l (if   'x'  is replaced with   's'  in owner's  level permissions that means suid is applied on that  
file) 
 
   - r w s r w x r w x     <file name>     (here   's'   is called set uid or suid) 
 
 
Example :   # chmod    u+s    /usr/sbin/init 6 
(then any user can restart the system using this  
          command  
   #init 6) 
 
# chmod    u+s    /sbin/fdisk 
(then any user can run the fdisk command) 
 
# strings     <command name> 
(to read the binary language of the command ie., the string  
command converts the binary language into human readable language) 
 
# strings    mkfs (to read the mkfs command's binary language into human readable language) 
 
*   Normally set uid (suid) permission will be given on scripting files only. 
 
44. Explain about set gid (sgid)? 
 
If we plan to allow all the users of one group to get the group ownership permissions then we go for  

SUVEN IT        Linux Administration       -An Admin Choice
 
 
 
 
SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|13 
 
 
set gid     (sgid). 
It can be applied for group level and is applicable on directories only. 
 
Example:    # chmod     g+s    <directory name> (to set the sgid on that directory) 
 
  
# chmod     g-s     <directory name> 
(to remove the sgid from that directory) 
 
45. Explain about sticky bit? 
 
It protects the data from other users when all the users having full permissions on one directory. 
 
It can be applied on others level and applicable for directories only. 
 
 
Example :   # chmod    o+t    <directory name> 
(to set the sticky bit permission on that directory) 
 
  
# ls   -ld <directory name> 
 
  
   r w x r w x r w t 
<directory name> 
(where   't'  is called the sticky bit) 
 
46. What are the uses of passwd and shadow files? 
 
Passwd file : (i)   When we create the user one entry is updated in password and shadow files. 
 
(ii)   It represents and tell about that user login name , uid, gid, default home directory of the use and  
default   shell. 
 
(iii) So, using this file we can easily get users information. 
 
 
Shadow file :   (i)   This file tells about the login id, user's encrypted password,  password when last  
changed,  min. days the password valid, max. days valid, warning days, inactive days and expiry days. 
 
(ii)  If shadow file is missed or deleted we can recover those entries of shadow file using password file. 
 
(iii) We can change the users encrypted passwords with the permissions of the higher authorities in  
case of  emergency. 
 
47. What is the use of group? 
 
(i)   In an organization the whole work is divided into departments for easy maintenance and easy  
 
  
administration. 
 
(ii) For each department is also represented as group and that group having so many users to do  
different works. 
 
(iii) So, if we create one group and assign that group to all the users in that department, then we can  
easily identify which user belongs to which group. 
 
(iv) We can share files, directories and execute some programs to that group and also give permissions  
to that  group. So, each user of that group can easily share those directories and also can easily access, 
execute or even write in those shared files and directories. 
 
48. Can we login to the user without password? 
 
Yes, we can login. 
 
49. How to recover the root password if missed or deleted? 
 
RHEL - 6 : 
 
(i)   Restart the system. 
 
(ii)  Select  1st  option and press  'e'. 
 
(iii) Select 2nd option and press  'e'. 
 
(iv) At the end give one blank space and type  1  and press Enter key. 
 
(v)  Then press  'b'  to boot the system in single user mode.

(vi) Then prompt appears and type    # passwd root    command. 
 
  New password :  XXXXXX 
 
 Retype password :  XXXXXX 
 
(vii) Exit 
 
(viii) Then system starts as usual. 
 
 
 
RHEL - 7 : 
 
(i)   Restart the system. 
 
(ii)  Using arrow keys select  1st line and  press  'e'  to edit. 
 
(iii) Go to  Linux 16  line press End key  or  Ctrl + e  to go to the end of the line and give one space. 
 
(iv) Then type as   rd.break   console=tty1   selinux=0 
 
(v)  Then press    Ctrl + x   to start the computer in single user mode. 
 
(vi) After starting  we get  swith_root :/#   prompt appears and then type as follows. 
 
(vii) # mount   -o   remount, rw    /sysroot   and press Enter and then type as follows. 
 
(viii) # chroot   /sysroot    press Enter. 
 
(ix)  Then   sh - 4.2 #   prompt appears and type as  
 
(x)  sh - 4.2 #passwd root 
 
    New password :  XXXXXX 
 
    Retype password :  XXXXXX 
 
(xi) sh - 4.2 # exit 
 
(xii) switch-root :/# exit 
 
(xiii) Then the system starts and the desktop appears. 
 
50. How to restrict the users from login? 
 
(i)   By removing (deleting) the user we can restrict the user from login. 
 
(ii)  Put the user's hostnames as entries in  /etc/hosts.deny    file (applying TCP wrappers). 
 
(iii) #passwd   -l    <user name>   (by locking his password we can restrict the users). 
 
51. How to put never expiry to a user? 
 
# passwd     -x    -1    <user login name> 
 
52. Which one is the default sticky bit directory? 
 
/tmp    is the default sticky bit directory. 
 
53. What is the purpose of the profiles? 
 
(i)   Profile is a file to enter some settings about users working environment. ie., we can set user home  
            directory, login shell, path, ...etc.,  
 
Profiles are two types. 
 
(a) Global profile 
 
(b) Local profile 
 
 
Global profile : 
 
(1)  Only root user can set and applicable to all the users. 
 
(2)  Only global parameters can entered in this profile. 
 
(3)  The location of the global profile is   /etc/bashrc

SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|15 
 
 
 
Local profile : 
 
(1)  Every user has his/her own profile. 
 
(2)  The settings entered in this profile are only for that user. 
 
(3)  The location of the profile is   .bash_profile    (hidden file)  in that particular user's home directory. 
 
54. Can we mount/unmount the  O/S   file system? 
 
No, we cannot mount or unmount the   O/S   file system. 
 
55. How to find the users who are login and how to kill them? 
 
# fuser    -cu 
 
 
(to see who are login) 
 
#fuser    -ck    <user login name> (to kill the specified user) 
 
56. what is Access Control List (ACL)? 
       Define more access rights nothing but permissions to files and directories. Using Access Control list we  
       assign  
the permissions to some particular users to access the files and directories. 
 
ACL can cab be applied on ACL enabled partition that means you need to enable ACL while mounting  
          the partition. 
 
57. How to implement ACLs? 
          Create a partition and format it with ext4 file system. 
          Mount the file system with ACL. 
          Apply ACL on it. 
 
Create a partition using   # fdisk   command. 
 
Format the above partition with ext4 file system using   # mkfs.ext4    <partition name>   command. 
 
Create the mount point using    # mkdir    /<mount point>    command. 
 
Mount that file system on the mount point using # mount   -o   acl    <partition name><mount point>
 
command. 
 
Mount the partition permanently using    
             # vim   /etc/fstab   (open this file and make an entry as  below) 
 
<partition name><mount point><file system type>     defaults, acl      0    0 
 
Save and exit this file. 
 
If the partition is already mounted then just add    acl   after defaults in   /etc/fstab   file and execute  
the below command    
# mount    -o    remount    <partition name> 
 
58. How to check the ACL permissions? 
 
# getfacl     <options><file  or  directory name> 
 
   The options are,   -d   ----->   Display the default ACLs. 
 
  
 
-R   ----->   Recurses into subdirectories. 
 
59. How to assign ACL permissions? 
 
# setfacl     <options><argument> : <username>: <permissions><file  or  directory name> 
 
  The options are,   -m   ----->   Modifies an ACL. 
 
  
-x     ----->   Removes an ACL. 
 
  
-b    ----->   Remove all the ACL permissions on that directory.

-R    ----->  Recurses into subdirectories. 
 
The arguments are,  u  ----->  user 
 
  
 
  g  ----->  group 
 
  
 
  o  ----->  other 
 
60. What is the syntax to assign read and write permissions to particular user, group  and  other? 
 
# setfacl    -m   u : <user name> : <permissions><file  or  directory> 
 
# setfacl    -m   g : <user name> : <permissions><file  or  directory> 
 
# setfacl    -m   o : <user name> : <permissions><file  or  directory> 
 
60. What is the syntax to assign read and write permissions to particular user, group  and  other  at  a  
          time? 
 
# setfacl    -m   u : <user name> : <permissions>,  g : <user name> : <permissions>,  o : <user name> :  
 
<permissions><file  or  directory> 
 
 
Useful  commands : 
 
# setfacl    -x   u : <user name><file  or  directory name> (to remove the ACL permissions from the user) 
 
# setfacl    -x   g : <user name><file  or  directory name>(to remove the ACL permissions from group) 
 
# setfacl    -x   o : <user name><file  or  directory name> (to remove the ACL permissions from other) 
 
# setfacl    -b    <file  or  directory> 
(to remove all the ACL permissions on that file     directory) 
 
61. How will you lock a user, if he enters wrong password  3  times? 
 
pam_tally.so module maintains a count of attempted accesses, can reset count on success, can deny  
          access if  too many attempts fail. Edit /etc/pam.d/system-auth file, enter: 
 
(i)  
# vi /etc/pam.d/system-auth 
 
 Modify as follows: 
 
 auth required pam_tally.so no_magic_root 
 
  account required pam_tally.so deny=3 no_magic_root lock_time=180 
Where, 
deny=3 : Deny access if tally for this user exceeds 3 times. 
lock_time=180 : Always deny for 180 seconds after failed attempt. There is alsounlock_time=n option. It 
allow access after n seconds after failed attempt. If this option is used the user will be locked out for the 
specified amount of time after he exceeded his maximum allowed attempts. Otherwise the account is 
locked until the lock is removed by a manual intervention of the system administrator. 
magic_root : If the module is invoked by a user with uid=0 the counter is not incremented. The sys-
admin should use this for user launched services, like su, otherwise this argument should be omitted. 
no_magic_root : Avoid root account locking, if the module is invoked by a user with uid=0 
 Save and close the file. 
 
62. How to see the no. of failed logins of the users? 
 
# faillog    -u    <user name> 
 
 
(to see the specified users failed login attempts) 
 
# faillog    -a  
 
 
 
 
 
(to see failed login attempts of all users) 
 
# faillog    -M  <Max. no>    -u    <user name> 
 
(to set Max. login failed attempts to that user) 
 
# faillog    -M  5    -u    raju 
 
 
(to set Max. login failed attempts to 5 for user raju)

By configuring the disk quotas we can restrict the user to use unlimited space on the file system and  
also to restrict the unlimited files in the file system. We can configure the disk quotas in ways. They are, 
 
(i) 
user quotas 
 
(ii) 
group quotas 
 
 
Steps to enable : 
 
First check whether the quota package is installed  or  not  by

Chapter#2 – Managing Partitions and File Systems  
1. 
What is partition? 
 
A partition is a contiguous set of blocks on a drive that are treated as independent disk.  
 
2. 
What is partitioning? 
 
Partitioning means to divide a single hard drive into many logical drives. 
 
3. 
Why we have multiple partitions? 
 Encapsulate our data. 
 Since file system corruption is limited to that partition only. 
 So we can save our data from accidents.  
 We can increase the disk space efficiency 
 . Depending on our usage we can format the partition with different block sizes. 
 So we can reduce the wastage of the disk. 
 We can limit the data growth by assigning the disk quotas. 
 
4. 
What is the structure of the disk partition? 
The first sector of the O/S disk contains the MBR (Master Boot Record). The MBR is divided into 3 parts 
and it's size is 512 bytes. The first part is IPL (Initial Program Loader) and it contains the Secondary Boot 
Loader. So, IPL  is responsible for booting the O/S and it's size is 446 bytes The second part is PTI 
(Partition Table Information). It contains the number of partitions on the disk, sizes of the partitions and 
type of the partitions 
 
5. 
Explain the disk partition criteria? 
Every disk can have max. 4 partitions. The 4 partitions are 3 Primary partitions and 1 Extended partition. 
The MBR and O/S will install in Primary partition only. The Extended partition is a special partition and 
can be further divided into multiple logical partitions. 
 
6. 
How to identify the disks? 
 In Linux different types of disks will be identified by different naming conventions. 
 IDE) drives will be shown as /dev/hda, /dev/hdb, /dev/hdc, ...etc.,  and the partitions are /dev/hda1,  
/dev/hda2, /dev/hda3, ...etc. 
 
 iSCSI/SCSI  and SATA drives will be shown as /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, ...etc.,  and the partitions 
are /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, /dev/sda3, ...etc., 
 
 Virtual drives will be shown as /dev/vda, /dev/vdb, /dev/vdc, ...etc.,  and the partitions are 
/dev/vda1, /dev/vda2, /dev/vda3, ...etc., 
 IDE  ----->  Integrated Drive Electronics. 
 iSCSI  ----->  Internet Small  Scale System Interface. 
 SCSI  ----->  Small Scale System Interface. 
 FC -------Fiber Channel

7. 
What is file system? 
It is a method of storing the data in an organized fashion on the disk. Every partition on the disk except 
MBR and Extended partition should be assigned with some file system in order to make them to store 
the data. File system is applied on the partition by formatting it with a particular type of file system. 
 
8. 
What are the different types of file systems supported in Linux? 
 The Linux supported file systems are ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, vfat, cdfs, hdfs, iso9660 ...etc., 
 The ext2, ext3, ext4 file systems are widely used in RHEL-6 and xfs file system is introduced on RHEL7.  
 The vfat file system is used to maintain a common storage between Linux and Windows O/S. 
 The cdfs file system is used to mount the CD-ROMs and the hdfs file system is used to mount DVDs. 
 The iso9660 file system is used to read CD/DVD.iso image format files in Linux O/S.

13. What is mounting and in how many types can we mount the partitions? 
 
Attaching a parititon to a directory under root is known as mounting. 
 
There two types of mountings in Linux/Unix. 
 
 Temporary Mounting : 
In a temporary mounting first we create a directory and mount the partition on that directory. But this 
type mounting will last only till the system is up and once it is rebooted the mounting will be lost. 
Example:# mount   <options><device name><directory name (mount point)> 
 
 Permanent Mounting : 
In this also first we create the directory and open the /etc/fstab file and make an entry as below, 
<device name><mount point><file system type><mount options><take a backup or not><fsck value> 
Whenever the system  reboots mount the partitions according to entries in /etc/fstab file. So, these type 
of mountings are permanently even after the system is rebooted. 
# mount   -a          to mount the partitions without reboot) 
 
14. What are differences between the ext2, ext3, ext4 and xfs file systems?

15. Which files are related to mounting in Linux? 
 /etc/mtab  ---->  is a file which stores the information of all the currently mounted file systems 
and this file is    dynamic  and keep on changing. 
 /etc/fstab  ---->  is keeping information about the permanent mount points. If we want to 
make our mount point  permanent then make an entry about the mount point in this file. 
 
 
/etc/fstab  entries are: 
 
       1 
 
        2  
3 
            4 
 
     5 
 
 6 
 
device name     mount point       F/S type mount options Dump                    FSCK  
 
 
16. The partitions are not mounting even though there are entries in /etc/fstab. How to solve this 
problem? 
 
First check any wrong entries are there in /etc/fstab file. If all are ok then unmount all the partitions by  
 
executing the below command, 
# umount    -a 
 
Then mount again mount all the partitions by executing the below command, 
# mount   -a

17. When trying to unmounting it is not unmounting, how to troubleshoot this one? 
 
Some times directory reflects error while unmounting because, 
 
(i) you are in the same directory and trying to unmount it, check with # pwdcommand. 
 
(ii) some users are present or accessing the same directory and using the contents in it, check this with  
# fuser -cu  <device name>       (to check the users who are accessing that partition) 
# lsof  <device name>     (to check the files which are open in that mount point) 
# fuser   -ck   <opened file name with path>      (to kill that opened files) 
 
Now we can unmount that partition using   # umount     <mount point> 
 
18. How to see the usage information of mounted partitions? 
 
# df   -hT       (to see device name, file system type, size, used, available size, use% and mount point) 
 
19. How to see the size of the file or directory? 
# du   -h   <filename or directory  name>     (to see the size of the in that directory) 
# du   -h       (to see all the file sizes which are located in the present working directory) 
# du  .| sort  -nr | head  -n10      (to see the biggest files from current location) 
# du  -s * | sort  -nr | head  -n10     (to see the biggest directories from that partition) 
# ncdu     (to list biggest files and directories, we have to install the ncdu package  before executing this) 
 
20. How to assign a label to the partition? 
 # e2label   <device name or partition name><label name>      (to assign the label to that partition) 
 Example :    # e2label  /dev/sdb1  oradisk      (to assign oradisk label to /dev/sdb1 partition) 
 # mount   -l       (to list all the mounted partitions along with their labels) 
 
21. How to mount a partition temporarily or permanently using label? 
 # mount   LABEL=<label name><mount point> 
ex :  # mount   LABEL=oradisk     /mnt/oracle    (to mount the oradisk label on /mnt/oracle directory) 
 # vim  /etc/fstab 
 LABEL=oradisk /mnt/oracle 
ext4 
defaults 
0 
0 
 Esc+:+wq!    (to save and exit the file) 
 # mount    -a       (to mount the partitions) 
 # mount (to verify whether it is mounted or not) 
 
22. How mount the partition permanently using block id (UUID)? 
 # blkid   <partition name or disk name>       (to see the UUID or block id of that partition) 
 Example :  #blkid   /dev/sdb2       (to see the UUID or block id of the /dev/sdb2 partition) 
 Copy that UUID with mouse and paste it in /etc/fstab file and make an entry about that. 
 Example:  # vim /etc/fstab 
 UUID="{.......................}"   
/mnt/oracle 
ext4 
defaults 
0 
0 
 Esc+:+wq!      (to save and exit) 
 
23. What is the basic rule for swap size? 
 (i) If the size of the RAM is less than or equal to 2GB, then the size of the swap = 2 X RAM size. 
 (ii) If the size of the RAM is more than 2GB, then the size of the swap = 2GB + RAM size.

24. How to create a swap partition and mount it permanently? 
 # free   -m       (to see the present swap size) 
 # swapon  -s     (to see the swap usage) 
 # fdisk   <disk name> 
(to make a partition) 
 Example:  # fdisk   /dev/sdb 
 Command (m for help) :  n    (to create a new partition) 
 First cylinder :  (press Enter to take as default value) 
 Last cylinder :  +2048M   (to create 2GB partition) 
 Command (m for help) :   t     (to change the partition id) 
 Enter the partition No.:  2      (to change the /dev/sdb2 partition id) 
 Enter the id :  82    (to change the partition id Linux to Linux Swap) 
 Command (m for help) :  w    (to save the changes into the disk) 
 # partprobe  /dev/sdb        (to update the partition table information) 
 # mkswap  <device or partition name>     (to  format the partition with swap file system) 
 Example :  # mkswap   /dev/sdb2        (to format the /dev/sdb2 partition with swap file system) 
 # swapon    <device or partition name>     (to activate the swap space) 
 Example :  # swapon   /dev/sdb2       (to activate /dev/sdb2  swap space) 
 # free   -m       (to see the swap size) 
 # vim /etc/fstab    (to make an entry to permanent mount the swap partition)

25. What are the attributes of the file system? 
(i) 
Inode number 
 (ii)         File name 
(ii) 
data block 
 
26. What is inode number and what is the use of it? 
 
Inode numbers are the objects the Linux O/S uses to record the information about the file. 
 
Generally inode number contains two parts. 
 
 (a) Inode first part contains information about the file, owner, its size and its permissions. 
 
 (b) Inode second part contains pointer to data blocks associated with the file content. 
 
That's why using the inode number we can get the file information quickly. 
 
27. How to check the integrity of a file system or consistency of the file system? 
# fsck   <device or partition name>command we can check the integrity of the file system. 
 
But before running the fsck command first unmount that partition and then run fsck command. 
 
28. What is fsck check or what are the phases of the fsck? 
 
(a) First it checks blocks and sizes of the file system 
 
(b) Second it checks file system path names 
 
(c) Third it checks file system connectivity 
 
(d) Fourth it checks file system reference counts (nothing but inode numbers) 
 
(e) Finally it checks file system occupied cylindrical groups

29. Why the file system should be unmount before running the fsck command? 
If we run fsck on mounted file systems, it leaves the file systems in unusable state and also deletes the 
data.  So, before running the fsck command the file system should be unmounted. 
 
30. Which type of file system problems you face? 
(i) 
 File system full 
(ii) 
File system corrupted 
 
31. How to extend the root file system which is not on LVM? 
By using # gparted  
command we can extend the root partition, otherwise we cannot extend the  
file systems  
which is not on LVM. 
 
32. How to unmount a file system forcefully? 
 
# umount    -f    <mount point> 
 
# fuser    -ck    <mount point> 
 
33. How to know the file system type? 
 
# df   -hT       (command gives the file system type information) 
 
34. How to know which file system occupy more space and top 10 file systems? 
 
# df   -h   <device or partition name>  | sort   -r  |  head    -10 
 
35. What is the command to know the mounted file systems? 
 
# mount    or  # cat  /etc/mtab 
 
36. How to know whether the file system is corrupted or not? 
 
First unmount the file systems and then run fsck command on that file system. 
 
37. How to recover if a file system is corrupted or crashed? 
If the normal or not related to O/S file system is corrupted first unmount that file system and run fsck 
command on that file system and if the O/S related file system is corrupted then boot the system with 
CDROM in single  user mode and run the fsck command. 
If the normal or not related to O/S file system is crashed then restore it from the recent backup and if 
the O/S  
related file system is crashed then boot the system with CDROM in single user mode 
and restore it from the recent backup. 
 
38. How to create a file with particular size? 
 
# dd  if=/dev/zero of=/orafile   bs=1MB  count=500 (to create 500MB size  /orafile with 4KB blocksize) 
 
39. How to find how many disk are attached to the system? 
 
# fdisk    -l     (to see how many disk are attached to the system) 
 
40. What is journaling? 
It is a dedicated area in the file system where all the changes are tracked when the system crashed. So 
the possibility of the file system corruption or crashes is less because of this journaling  feature.

41. How to repair the Superblock of the file system? 
Whenever we want to store the data into the hard disk, if the input/output error occurs then the 
Superblock of  the file system may be erased or corrupted. So, we have to restore or repair that 
Superblock. 
 
# umount    <file system mount point> 
(to unmount the file system) 
  # dumpe2fs   </dev/vgname/lvname>  | grep  superblock    (to list the superblocks first primary  
       superblock and  then      secondary superblock and so on) 
 
# e2fsck   -b   <copy and paste the secondary super block from the above list></dev/vgname/lvname> 
 
  
(to restore the damaged superblock) 
 
# mount   -a  
(to mount the file system) 
 
42. How to create the file systems with the user specified superblock reserve space? 
 
# mkfs.ext4   -m  <no.><partition name> (to format the partition with <no.>% of reserve space to  
           superblock)  
           Whenever we format the file system, by default it reserve the 5% partition space for Superblock. 
 
 
43. How to modify the superblock reserve space? 
 
# tune2fs   -m  <no.><partition name> 
(to modify the  superblock reserve space to  <no.>%)  
 
44. Important Commands : 
# fsck   <partition name>  
(to check the consistency of the file system) 
# e2fsck  <partition name>  
(to check the consistency of the file system in interactive mode) 
# e2fsck   -p   <partition name>

Chapter#3 – Logical Volume Management and RAID Levels  
1. 
What is LVM and why we go for LVM? 
Lvm means Logical Volume Management. The combination of 2 or more physical disk in order to make a 
big  logical disk is called Logical Volume. If normal Linux partition is full and an application requires 
some more disk space, then normal partition cannot be extended for that application requirement. For 
this first we have to take a backup of that normal partition, delete that partition and again create that 
partition with more disk space, format and mount that partition and finally restore the application from 
the backup. This process requires down time. So, to overcome this problem  LVM  concept is coming into 
the picture. Using this LVM we can extend or reduce the file systems as per requirement without loss of 
any data. 
 
2.      What are the components of the LVM? 
Physical Volume (PV) 
Physical Extent (PE) 
Volume Group (VG) 
Logical Volume (LV) 
Logical Extent (LE) 
Physical Volume (PV) : 
It is the standard partition that we add to the LVM. Normally a physical volume is a standard primary or 
logical partition with the partition code as 8e. 
Physical Extent (PE) : 
It is chunk of disk space. Every physical volume is divided into a number of equal sized PEs. 
Volume Group (VG) : 
It is composed of a group of physical volumes and logical volumes. It is the organizational group of LVM. 
Logical Volume (LV) : 
It is composed of a group of LEs. We can format (make a file system) and mount any file system on the 
logical volume. The size of these logical volumes can easily be increased or decreased as per the 
requirement. 
Logical Extent (LE) : 
 
It is also a chunk of disk space. Every logical extent is mapped to a specific physical extent. 
 
3. 
How to create the LVM, make a file system and mount that permanently? 
(i)  Take two physical disks for example  /dev/sdb   and    /dev/sdc. if there is no second disk then   make 
the required partitions using  # fdisk command and change the partition code as 8e. 
(ii) Convert the Physical disk into physical volumes by, 
  
# pvcreate   /dev/sdb    /dev/sdc 
(iii) Then create the volume group by combining physical volumes by, 
 # vgcreate  <volume group name><physical volume names>   or 
 # vgcreate   -s  <PE size in MBs><volume group name><physical volume names> 
(iv) Then create the logical volume on the above created volume group by, 
 # lvcreate   -L  +<size in MBs>   -n  <logical volume name><Volume group name>  or 
 # lvcreate   -l   <no. of PEs>    -n   <logical volume name><volume group name> 
(v) Make a file system on the above created logical volume by,

(vi) Create a mount point to mount the above created LVM file system by, 
 # mkdir   /mnt/<directory name> 
(vii) Mount the LVM on the above created mount point temporarily by, 
 # mount   /dev/<volume group name>/<logical volume name><mount point>or 
 Mount the LVM on mount point permanently by,

7. 
How to extend the Volume Group? 
Extending the volume group is actually adding a new physical volume to the volume group. 
To extend the volume group we need to create a new partition using # fdisk command and make sure 
that it's partition id should be 8e, save the changes and update the partition table by # partprobe 
Create a physical volume on the newly created partition using # pvcreate command. 
Add the partition to the volume group using # vgextend command  
 
Example :  # fdisk   /dev/sdb 
 
  
Command (m for help) : n 
 
  
First cylinder : press Enter for default one 
 
  
Last cylinder : +500M           
(create 500MB partition) 
 
  
Command (m for help) : t    
(to change the partition id) 
 
Select the partition : type the partition number

# vgextend   <VG name>   /dev/sdb1 
 
# vgdisplay   <VG name> (to check the size of the volume group) 
 
8.     How to extend the logical volume and update it's file system? 
Sometimes the file system size may be full, so we need to increase the size of the logical volume to 
continue adding the data in it. 
The size of the logical volume can be increased online, no downtime required. 
Check current size of the logical volume by # lvdisplay  <LV name>and the size of the file system by        # 
df -hT  command. 
Increase the size of the logical volume by # lvextend or # lvresize commands. 
Then finally update the file system by # resize2fs or # xfs_growfs commands. 
 
Example :   # df   -hT 
 
  
# lvextend    -L   +<size in MB></dev/vgname/lvname>    or 
 
  
# lvresize   -L   +<size in MB></dev/vgname/lvname> 
 
  
# resize2fs    </dev/vgname/lvname> 
 
  
# lvdisplay   </dev/vgname/lvname> (to check the size of the logical volume) 
 
  
# df    -hT 
 
 
 
 
(to check the size of the file system) 
 
9.      How to reduce the logical volume and update the file system? 
Reducing the size of the logical volume is a complicated task and we have remember some points before 
reducing the logical volume, otherwise the file system may be damaged . 
Logical volume size cannot be reduced online and it requires downtime because we have to unmount the 
file system by # umount   <file system mount point>command. 
Check the consistency of the file system by # e2fsck   <device or partition name>  command. 
Reduce the logical volume by # lvreduce   -L   - <Size of in MB></dev/vgname/lvname> command. 
Then update the file system by # resize2fs    </dev/vgname/lvname> 
Finally mount the file system by # mount  -a  
 
Example :  
# umount    <file system mount point> 
 
  
# e2fsck   <device or partition name> 
 
  
# lvreduce   -L   -<size in MB></dev/vgname/lvname> 
 
  
# resize2fs   </dev/vgname/lvname> 
 
  
# lvdisplay   </dev/vgname/lvname> (to check the size of the logical volume> 
 
  
# mount   -a     
 
 
(to mount the file system) 
 
  
# df    -hT  
 
 
 
(to check the size of the file system) 
 
10. How to move or migrate the logical volume data from one physical volume to another physical  
          volume? 
There might be a situation where the physical volume might be failing and it is required to replaced. In 
such case, we need to migrate or move the logical volume data from the failed physical volume new 
physical volume and isolate (remove) the failed physical volume. 
First access the mount point of the failing physical volume and check the data in it.

SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|30 
 
 
Verify the size of the physical volume by #pvs   or   #pvdisplay   </dev/vgname/lvname>command. 
Unmount the file system of that physical volume by # umount   <file system mount point> 
Add a new physical volume and the size should be same size or higher than that failing physical volume. 
 Migrate the physical volume contents to the new physical volume using  # pvmove  <old PV><new PV> 
Mount back the logical volume, access the mount point and verify the data in it. 
Remove the failed the physical volume by #vgreduce   <vgname><pvname>  command. 
 
Example :  # cd   <file system mount point> 
 
  
# ls  
 
  
# pvs   <pvname>    or   # pvdisplay   <pvname> 
 
  
# umount   <file system mount point> 
 
  
# pvcreate   <device or partition name> 
 
  
#vgextend    <vgname><pvname> 
 
  
# pvmove   <old pvname><new pvname> 
 
  
# mount   -a 
 
  
# vgreduce    <vgname><failed pvname> 
 
  
# cd   <file system mount point> 
 
  
# ls 
 
11. How to delete or remove the logical volume? 
To delete or remove the logical volume, first unmount the file system by # umount   <mount point> 
Remove the entry in /etc/fstab file. 
Remove the logical volume by # lvremove    </dev/vgname/lvname>command. 
Verify whether the logical volume is removed or not by # lvs   or   # lvdisplay   command. 
 
Example :  # umount   <file system mount point> 
 
  
# vim /etc/fstab         
 
(delete the entry of the logical volume) 
 
  
Esc+:+wq! 
 
 
(save and exit the file) 
 
  
# lvremove    </dev/vgname/lvname> 
 
  
# lvs    or    # lvdisplay     
(to verify whether logical volume is removed or not) 
 
12. How to delete or remove the volume group? 
To delete or remove the volume group, first make sure that any logical volume should not be mounted 
because while removing a volume group it will delete or remove the logical volumes in that volume 
group. Then delete or remove the volume group by # vgremove    <vgname>command. 
Verify whether the volume group is remove or not by # vgs    or    # vgdisplay   command. 
 Example : # umount     <file system mount point> 
(to unmount the file system if there is any LV) 
  
     # vim   /etc/fstab  
 
 
 
(delete the entry of the logical volume) 
  
     Esc+:+wq!  
 
 
 
(save and exit the file) 
  
     # vgremove     <vgname> 
   
     # vgs     or     # vgdisplay 
 
(to verify whether volume group is removed or not) 
 
13. How to delete or remove the physical volume? 
Deleting or removing a physical volume is very simple and the only thing we should check that the 
physical volume we are going to delete should not belong to any volume group ie., we can only delete or 
remove the physical volume which is free. 
Then delete or remove the physical volume by # pvremove    <pvname>command.

Verify whether the physical volume is removed or not by # pvs    or     #pvdisplay    command. 
Example :  # pvremove   <pvname> 
                   # pvs    or     #pvdisplay 
 (to verify whether the physical volume is removed or not) 
 
14. How to restore the volume group which is removed mistakenly? 
First unmount file system by # umount   <file system mount point>  command. 
Check the volume group backup list by # vgcfgrestore    --list   <volume group name>command. 
Then remove the logical volume by # lvremove    </dev/vgname/lvname> command. 
Copy the backup file which is taken backup before removed the volume group from the above backup 
list and paste it in this command # vgcfgrestore    -f   <paste the above copied file name><vgname> 
The logical volume is created automatically after restoring the volume group but the volume group and 
logical volumes both will be in inactive state. So, check the state of the volume group by #vgscanand the 
logical volume state by # lvscan  commands. 
Then activate that volume group by # vgchange   -ay   <volume group name>commandand activate the 
logical volume by # lvchange    -ay   <logical volume name>command. 
Mount the logical volume file system by # mount   -a  command. 
 
Example :  
# umount    <file system mount point> 
 
 # vgcfgrestore    --list   <volume group name> (copy the backup file from the list) 
 
 # lvremove    </dev/vgname/lvname> 
 
 # vgcfgrestore    -f   <paste the above copied file><volume group name> 
 
 # vgscan  
 
 
 
 
(to check the status of the volume group) 
 
 # lvscan  
 
 
 
(to check the status of the logical volume) 
 
 # vgchange    -ay   <volume group name>(activate the volume group if it is in inactive state) 
 
 # lvchange     -ay   <logical volume name>(activate the logical volume if it is in inactive state) 
 
Note:  The option   a   means active VG or LV  and option   y   means  yes. 
 
 # mount   -a 
 
15. How to change the volume group name and other parameters? 
# vgrename    <existing volume group name><new volume group name>  (to rename the volume group) 
By default, unlimited logical volumes can be created per volume group. But we can control this limit by 
# vgchange    -l   <no.><volume group> (to limit max. no. of logical volumes to the specified number) 
Example :  # vgchange  -l  2  <vgname> (to limit max. 2 logical volumes cab be created in this volume 
group) 
# vgchange   -p  <no.><volume group>(to limit max. no. of physical volumes to the specified number) 
Ex: # vgchange  -p  2  <vgname>(to limit max. 2 physical volumes can be added to this volume group) 
# vgchange   -s  <block size in no.><volume group> 
(to change the block size of the volume group) 
 Example :  # vgchange   -s   4  <vgname> 
(to change the volume group block size to 4MB) 
 
16. How to change the logical volume name and other parameters? 
 
# lvrename   <existing lvname><new lvname> 
(to rename the logical volume) 
 
# lvchange   -pr  <logical volume> 
(to put the logical volume into read only mode) 
 
# lvs  
 
 
 
(to see the logical volume permissions) 
 
# lvchange   -prw  <logical volume> 
(to put the logical volume into read and write mode)

30. What is RAID? What is the use of the RAID and how many types of RAIDs available? 
 
RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. 
 
It provides fault tolerance, load balancing using stripping, mirroring and parity concepts. 
 
There are mainly two types of RAIDs available. 
 
(i)  Hardware RAID  (Depends on vendors and also more expensive) 
 
(ii) Software RAID  (Does not depends on vendors and less expensive when compared to  
          Hardware RAID and  also it is maintained by system administrator only. 
 
31. How many types of software RAIDs available and their requirements? 
 
(i)   RAID - 0    ---- Stripping    ---- Minimum 2 disks required 
 
(ii)  RAID - 1    ---- Mirroring   ---- Minimum 2 disks required 
 
(iii) RAID - (1+0)  --- 
Mirroring + Stripping ----  Minimum 4 disks required 
 
(iv) RAID - (0+1)  --- 
Stripping + Mirroring ----  Minimum 4 disks required 
 
(v) RAID - 5    ---- Stripping with parity ---- 
  Minimum 3 disks required

32. How to configure RAID - 0 in Linux? 
To configure RAID - 0, minimum 2 disks are required and the partition id is "fd". 
Reading and writing is very fast. So, it produces high performance. 
if one disk is failed we cannot recover the data. 
So, there is no redundancy and fault tolerance in RAID - 0. 
 Example :  For example if the data is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 then .... 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
     Disk - 1 
 
         Disk - 2 
 
If the Disk - 1 is /dev/sdb   and  the Disk - 2 is  /dev/sdc   then, 
 
# mdadm   -Cv  /dev/md0   -n  2   /dev/sdb    /dev/sdc   -l  0  
                                                                                                 (to create the RAID - 0 using disk - 1 and disk - 2) 
 
# cat  /proc/mdstat 
 
 
 
(to check the RAID - 0 is created or not) 
 
# mkfs.ext4   /dev/md0    
 
 
(to create the ext4 file system on the RAID - 0) 
 
# mkdir  /mnt/raid0 
 
 
 
(to create the RAID - 0 mount point) 
 
# mount   /dev/md0    /mnt/raid0 
 
 
(to mount RAID - 0 on the mount point) 
 
# mdadm   -D  /dev/md0  
 
 
(to see the details of the RAID - 0 partition) 
 
# mdadm    /dev/md0    -f   /dev/sdb 
 
(to failed the disk manually) 
 
# mdadm   /dev/md0    -r   /dev/sdb 
 
(to remove the above failed disk) 
 
# mdadm   /dev/md0    -a   /dev/sdd 
 
(to add the new disk in place of failed disk) 
 
# umount   /mnt/raid0 
 
 
 
(to unmount the raid file system) 
 
# mdadm   --stop   /dev/md0 
 
 
(to stop the RAID - 0 volume) 
 
# mdadm   /dev/md0   --add   /dev/sde  
(to add third disk to the RAID - 0 volume) 
 
# mdadm    --grow   /dev/md0   --raid_device=3 (to grow the RAID - 0 file system) 
 
33. How to configure RAID - 1 in Linux? 
To configure RAID - 1, minimum 2 disks are required and the partition id is "fd". 
In this the same data will be written on 2 disks ie., exact copy on both the disks. 
if one disk is failed we can recover the data from another disk. 
So, there is a high availability, redundancy and fault tolerance in RAID - 1. 
In this writing speed is slow compared to RAID - 0. 
 Example :  For example if the data is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 then .... 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
    Disk - 1 
Disk - 2 
 
If the Disk - 1 is /dev/sdb   and  the Disk - 2 is  /dev/sdc   then, 
 
# mdadm   -Cv  /dev/md0   -n  2   /dev/sdb    /dev/sdc   -l  1 
                               
(to create the RAID - 1 using disk - 1 and disk - 2)

34. How to configure RAID - 5 in Linux? 
To configure RAID - 5, minimum 3 disks are required and the partition id is "fd". 
In every disk approximately 25 - 30% of space is reserved for parity. 
Reading and writing is very fast. So, it produces high performance. 
This is used Stripping with parity concept. 
if one disk is failed we can recover the data using remaining two disks and parity. 
If two disks are failed, then we cannot recover the data. 
So, there is no redundancy and fault tolerance in RAID - 5. 
 Example :  For example if the data is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 then .... 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
     Disk - 1 
Disk - 2  
  Disk - 3 
 
 
If the Disk - 1 is /dev/sdb,   the Disk - 2 is  /dev/sdc  and  Disk - 3 is /dev/sddthen, 
 
# mdadm   -Cv  /dev/md0   -n  2   /dev/sdb    /dev/sdc   -l  5 
                                       (to create the RAID - 5 using disks - 1, 2  and 3) 
 
# cat  /proc/mdstat 
 
 
(to check the RAID - 5 is created or not) 
 
# mkfs.ext4   /dev/md0    
 
(to create the ext4 file system on the RAID - 5) 
 
# mkdir  /mnt/raid5 
 
 
(to create the RAID - 5 mount point) 
 
# mount   /dev/md0    /mnt/raid5 
 
(to mount RAID - 5 on the mount point) 
 
# mdadm   -D  /dev/md0  
 
(to see the details of the RAID - 5 partition) 
 
# mdadm    /dev/md0    -f   /dev/sdb 
(to failed the disk manually) 
 
# mdadm   /dev/md0    -r   /dev/sdb

35. What are the main advantages of RAID - 5 
RAID - 5 uses Stripping with parity and requires only three disks. Because of Stripping the data reading 
and writing will be fast.And by usingparity we can recover the data if one of the three disks failed. So, 
the main  advantage of RAID - 5 we can get fast writing, reading and also redundancy fault tolerance 
with less expensive. 
 
36. How will you troubleshoot if one of the eight disks failed in LVM? 
First umount the file system and add the new disk with same size of the failed disk to the volume group. 
Then move the data from failed physical volume to newly added physical volume and then remove the 
failed physical volume from the volume group. And finally mount the file system. 
 
37.  What is pvmove and when it is used in LVM? 
The pvmove command is used to move the data from failed physical volume to newly added physical 
volume. This command is used when one of the physical volume is failed in the LVM. 
 
38. How to inform the client and then troubleshoot if the disk is full? 
First check which files are accessing more disk space by #du -h  |sort  - r command. if any temporary and 
junk files are present remove them from the disk to make a room for new or updated data. Then inform 
the actual situation to the client, take the permission from the client to get the lun from storage and 
extend the file system by adding that lun to the LVM. 
 
39. Did you work on storage? 
Actually I did not work on storage but I know the procedure how to export the lun from storage to client 
using iSCSI target. Then scan that lun at cleint side and add the lun to the LVM. I also know the storage 
hardware from  Emc square, Netapp and others. And I am dreaming to work on storage, cloud and 
virtualization. 
 
40. I have four disks each 1TB in RAID - (1+0). So, total how much disk space can I utilize in that RAID   
(1+0)? RAID - (1+0) means Mirroring + Stripping. It requires 4 disks, ie., 2 disks for mirroring and 
remaining 2 disks for  stripping. And 5 - 10% disk space is used for superblock information. So, finally 
we can utilize 2TB - 2TB X 10%  disk space in that RAID - (1+0). 
 
41. If two disks failed in RAID - (1+0), can we recover the data? 
 
The RAID - (1+0) requires minimum 4 disks and it uses Mirroring + Stripping. If one disk is failed we can  
           recover the data, but if two disks are failed we cannot recover the data. 
 
42. How many types of disk space issues can we normally get? 
 
(i)   Disk is full. 
 
(ii)  Disk is failing or failed. 
 
(iii) File system corrupted or crashed. 
 
(iv) O/S is not recognizing the remote luns when scanning, ...etc., 
 
43. What is a link file and how many types? 
 
Link file is a short cut file to the original file. Creating and removing  (deleting)  inks  between two files is  
          known as managing links. There are two types of links files available in Linux. 
 
(i) 
Soft link 
(ii) 
Hard link

SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|37 
 
 
44. What is soft link and how to create it? 
Soft link is nothing but a short cut file. If original file is deleted, no use of short cut file. ie., we cannot 
access the original data  by selecting the link file. Soft link can be applied on both directories and files. 
These files can be stored in any of  
the file system. ie., the original file may be in one file system 
and the link file may be on another file system. If  
we edit any file, the link files are also updated 
automatically. When we create a soft link file, the permissions are  
full permissions. The soft link file 
and the original file inode no's are different. The size of the soft link file is same  
as the length of 
the original file name. The soft link can be created by 
 
# ln     -s      <original file  or  directory><link file  or  directorywith path>  
(to create a soft link) 
           # ln   -s   /root/script  /root/Desktop/script (to create a link file for the script and stored on root Desktop) 
 
45. What is hard link and how to create it? 
Hard link in nothing but a backup file. If the original file is deleted, there is no effect on hard link file. i.e., 
we can  access the original file data even though the link file is deleted. Hard links can be applied on 
files only not on  directories. Hard link files can be stored in the same file system. ie., original and hard 
link files both should be in  
the same file system not on different file systems. The  inode no's are 
same for original and hard link files. If the  
original is edited, the updations  are applied on both 
original and hard link files. The size of the hard link file is  
same as the size of the original file.  
 
46. What are the commands to search files and directories? 
 
To search files and directories there are two commands. 
 
(i) 
# locate 
 
(ii) 
# find 
 
47.     Explain the locate command and how to use it? 
locate always looks the locate database and not in a specific location. The data of the locate is stored in  
/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db     file. If the data is not updated in locate database or the locate database 
is available or locate database is deleted, we cannot locate the files and directories.  # updatedb  is the 
command to update the locate database. locate database cannot be find the newly created files and 
directories. It is not recommended to use on production servers because it impacts on performance of 
the servers. So, to overcome this problem we normally use   # find    command on production servers. 
 
# updatedb 
 
 
 
(to update the locate database) 
 
# locate     <file name/directory name> (to search the specified file or directory) 
 
48. Explain the find command and how to use it? 
 
find  command required the specific location. Without specific location we cannot find the files  or   
          directories. 
 
# find    <location><options><file  or  directory>  
(to find the specific file  or  directory) 
 
   The options are, 
-name     ----->     search files and directories 
 
  
 
-prem     ----->     search for permissions 
 
  
 
-size        ----->     search for sizes 
 
  
 
-user       ----->     search for the owner 
 
  
 
-uid 
 ----->     search for files/directories of uid) 
 
  
 
-gid 
 ----->     search for files/directories  of gid) 
 
  
 
-group    ----->     search for group owner

Chapter#4 – Networking Configuration and Troubleshooting  
1. 
What is Network? 
Combination of two more computers connected together to share their resources each other by means 
of communication like cable is called Network. 
 
2. 
What is Networking? 
It is a connection between two or more computers to communicate with each other. 
 
3. 
what are the basic requirements for networking? 
 
(a)   NIC  (Network Interface Card  or  controller) 
 
(b)   Media   (nothing but cables) 
 
(c)   Topology 
 
(d)   Protocol 
 
(e)   IP Addresses 
 
4. 
Explain about NIC card? 
A Network Interface Card  or  controller is hardware component that connects a computer to a 
computer network. Each NIC card will be having MAC  (Media Access Controller)  address to avoid 
conflicts between same  NIC adapters. In Linux these NIC adapter is represented by the word   "eth" . 
For example if two NIC cards are there in a system then it will be denoted as   "eho","eth1", .....etc., 
 
5. 
What is media? 
Media is nothing but cable to connect two or systems. Example :  RJ 45, CAT 5 and CAT 6, ....etc., 
 
6. 
What is topology? 
Topology is a design in which the computers in network will be connected to each other. Example for 
topologies are Bus, Ring, Star, Mesh, Tree topologies. 
 
7. 
What is protocol? 
A  Network Protocol  defines rules and conventions for communication between the network devices. 
Protocols are generally use packet switching techniques to send and receive messages in the form of 
packets. Example for protocols are   TCP/IP  (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol),   UPD  
(User Datagram Protocol)   and   HTTP  (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), ....etc., 
 
8. 
What are the differences between  TCP/IP  and UDP  protocols? 
 
TCP/IP 
UDP 
Transmission Control Protocol 
User Datagram Protocol 
It is connection oriented 
It is connection less 
Reliable 
Non-Reliable 
TCP Acknowledgement will be sent / received 
No Acknowledgement 
Slow communication 
Fast communication 
Protocol No. for TCP is  6 
Protocol No. for UDP is  17 
HTTP, FTP, SMTP, ....etc.,  uses TCP 
DNS, DHCP, ....etc.,   uses UDP

9. 
What is an IP address? 
Every Computer will be assigned an IP address to identify each one to communicate in the network. The 
IP address sub components are Classes of an IP address, Subnet masks  and  Gateway. 
 
Classes of IP address : 
The IP addresses are further divided into classes. The classes are  A,  B, C, D, E and the ranges are given 
below. 
 
Class Start 
End 
Default Subnet mask 
Classless Inter Domain 
Routing 
Class  A 
0.0.0.0 
127.255.255.255 
255.0.0.0 
/8 
Class  B 
128.0.0.0 
191.255.255.255 
255.255.0.0 
/16 
Class  C 
192.0.0.0 
223.255.255.255 
255.255.255.0 
/24 
Class  D 
224.0.0.0 
239.255.255.255 
 
 
Class  E 
240.0.0.0 
255.255.255.255 
 
 
 
10. What is loopback address? 
A special IP number  (127.0.0.1)  is designated for the software loopback interface of a machine. 
127.0.0.0 and 127.255.255.255 is also reserved for loopback and is used for internal testing on local 
machines. 
 
11. What is multicasting? 
Multicasting allows a single message to be sent to a group of recipients. Emailing and Teleconferencing 
are examples of multicasting. It uses the network infrastructure and standards to send messages. 
 
12. What is subnet mask? 
A subnet mask allows the users to identify which part of an IP address is reserved for the network and 
which part is available for host use.  
 
13. What is Gateway? 
 A Gateway is the network point that provides entrance into another network. On the internet a node 
or stopping point can be either gateway node or a host (end point) node. Both the computers of internet 
users and the computer that serve the pages to users are host nodes. The computer that control traffic 
within your company's network or at our local internet service provider (ISP)  are the gateway nodes. 
 
14. What are important configuration files in network configuration? 
# cat  /etc/sysconfig/network  
(This file keeps the information about the hostname assigned to the system  
 and if we want to 
change the hostname permanently, we need to change the hostname in this file) 
 
 
         # cat  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/    
         (This directory keeps the configuration of network devices connected  to the system.  
          Examples are  ifcfg-   eht0, ifcfg-eth1, ifcfg-eth2, .....etc.,) 
 
 
            # cat  /etc/hosts 
 
 (This file is responsible for resolving hostname into IP address locally. ie., local DNS if DNS server is not 
available)

          # cat  /etc/resolve.conf  
         (This file keeps the address of the DNS server to which the clients will be accessing to resolve IP address 
to hostname  and  hostname to IP address) 
 
15. What are the differences between MAC  and  IP addresses? 
MAC  Address 
IP  Address 
It is a permanent address. So we cannot change this 
address. 
It is a temporary address. So, we can change this 
address any no. of times. 
It stands for Media Access Control Address. 
Internet Protocol address. 
It is a physical address. 
It is a logical address. 
It is divided into 6 parts. 
--- : --- : --- : --- : --- : ---  (each 8 bits. So, 8 X 6 = 48 bits 
It is two types. 
IPV4 :(It is divided into 4 parts ) 
--- . --- . --- . ---    (each 8 bits. So, 8 X 4 = 32 bits 
IPV6 : ( It is divided into 16 parts ) 
--- . --- . --- . --- . --- . --- . --- . --- . --- . --- . --- . --- . --- 
. --- . --- . ---   (each 8 bits. So, 8 X 16 = 128 bits. 
 ifconfig            (to see the MAC address) 
# ifconfig             (to see the IP address) 
 
16. How many types of NIC cards available? 
 
(a) 
eth0 
(1st   NIC  card) 
 
(b) 
eth1 
(2nd  NIC  card) 
 
(c) 
br0 
(Bridge  ----->  used for communication from physical to virtual) 
 
(d) 
lo 
(loopback device name and IP address is 127.0.0.1) 
 
# ifconfig   
(to see all the NIC devices connected to the system) 
 
17. How many types of cable connections available? 
 
(i) 
Cross cable 
(to connect two systems directly) 
 
(ii) 
Straight cable (to connect more systems with the help of switch) 
 
# ethtool    <device name> 
 
(to check the network cable is connected or not) 
 
# miitool <device name> (It is also used to check the network cable but it will not supports RHEL - 7 
 
  
and only supports RHEL - 6 and it also works on physical system only not on virtual system) 
 
18. In how many ways we can configure the network? 
 
There are two ways to configure the network. 
 
(a) 
Static Network. 
 
(b) 
Dynamic Network. 
 
Static Network : 
In this way we assign the IP address and hostname manually. Once we configure the IP address, it will 
not change. 
 
Dynamic Network : 
In this way we assign the IP address and hostname dynamically. This means the IP address will change 
at every  boot.

# hostname    <fully qualified domain name> 
(to set the hostname temporarily) 
 
# vim   /etc/sysconfig/network 
 
 
(to set the hostname permanently) 
 
 HOSTNAME=<fully qualified domain name> 
 
 (save and exit this file) 
 
# service network restart  
 
 
(to update the hostname in the network) 
 
# chkconfig  network on  
 
 
(to enable the connection at next reboot) 
 
 
RHEL - 7 : 
 
# hostname    <fully qualified domain name> 
 
 
(to set the hostname temporarily)

(to enable the connection at next reboot) 
 
23. How to troubleshoot if the NIC is notworking? 
 
(a)   First check the NIC card is present or not by  # ifconfig    command.  
(b)   If present thencheck the status of the NIC  card is enabled or disabledby click on System menu on 
the status bar, then select Network Connections menu.  
           (c)   Click on IPV4 settings tab, select the device eth0 or any other and select Enable button,  
           then Apply, then  OK. 
(d)   Open  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0  file check  Userctl=yes or no. If it is yes make it as 
no, then check Onboot= yes or no. If it is no make it as yes and save that file. 
 
(e)   If not present thencheck the status of the NIC  card is enabled or disabled by click on  
           System menu on the status bar, then select Network Connections menu. 
 
(f)  Click on IPV4 settings tab,  select the device eth0 or any other and select Enable button,   
          then Apply, then OK. 
(g) Using  # setup (in RHEL - 6) or   # nmcli  (in RHEL - 7)  commands assign the IP address to the system 
and restart the network service by  # service  network  restart  (in RHEL - 6)  or  # systemctl  restart  
network  (in RHEL - 7)  commands  and enable the service at next reboot by  # chkconfig  network on  
(in RHEL - 6)  or    # systemctl  enable  network  (in RHEL - 7)  commands. 
 
(h) Then up the connection by  # ifconfig  eth0  up  (in RHEL - 6)  or

           # nmcli connection up  <connection name>  
commands. 
(i) Even though it is not working may be the fault in NIC card. If so, contact the hardware vendor by 
 taking the permissions from higher authorities. 
 
24. What is bonding and how to configure bonding? (from RHEL - 6) 
 
What is link aggregation or bridging or teaming and how to configure teaming? (from RHEL - 7) 
 
Bonding or Teaming  or Bridging: 
 
Collection of multiple NIC cards and make them as single connection (virtual) NIC card is called bonding. 
 
It is nothing but backup of NIC cards. 
 
In RHEL - 6  it is called as Bonding or Bridging. 
 
In RHEL - 7  it is called as Teaming or Link aggregation. 
 
There are 3 types of backup in Bonding or Teaming. 
 
(a) 
Mode 0   ----->   Round Robbin 
 
(b) Mode 1 
  -----> Activebackup 
 
(c) 
Mode 3   -----> Broadcasting 
 
Mode 0 : 
It provides load balancing and fault tolerance. 
Data will be shared by both NIC cards in round robbin. 
If one NIC card failed then another NIC card will be activated to communicate with the server 
So, there is a load balancing and fault tolerance features. 
 
Mode 1 : 
Activebackup means only one NIC card is activated at a time and another one is in down state. 
So, there is no load balancing. 
But if one NIC card is failed then another NIC card will be activated automatically. 
 
Mode 3 : 
In this mode broadcasting is done. 
In this the same data will be transferred through two NIC cards. 
So there is no load balancing. 
But if one NIC card is failed then second NIC card will be activated automatically. 
 So, all the 3 modes are supports only fault tolerance, but round robbin is the only one mode that 
provides load  
balancing. 
 
 
Requirements to configure : 
 
(i) 
Minimum two NIC cards. 
 
(ii) 
One  IP address. 
 
(iii) 
Connection type is  bond  (in RHEL - 6)  and   team  (in RHEL - 7)  not the ethernet type. 
 
Here no need to assign the IP addresses for  two  NIC cards and we are giving only one IP address  
           to bond or team. 
 
 
Bonding configuration : (in RHEL - 6) 
 
(i) 
# vim   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0 
 
 DEVICE=bond0 
 
 IP ADDR=<IP address> 
 
 TYPE=ethernet 
 
 NETMASK=255.225.225.0 or <IP address class netmask>

25.     What is the difference between TCP and UDP protocol? 
            TCP is a connection oriented protocol and contain the information of sender as well as receiver. 
Example : HTTP,  FTP, Telnet 
TCP is slower than UDP due to its error checking mechanism 
UDP protocols are connection less packets have no information to where they are going. These type of 
ports are generally used for broadcasting.  
For example :  DNS,  DHCP 
UDP are faster 
 
26.  What are the benefits of NIC Teaming? 
 
(i) 
 Load balancing 
 
(ii) Fault Tolerance 
 
(iii) Failover 
 
27.  Mention all the network configuration files you would check to configure your ethernet card? 
 
(i)    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth* 
 
(ii)   /etc/sysconfig/network 
 
(iii)   /etc/resolve.conf 
 
(iv)    /etc/nsswitch.conf 
 
28. What is the use of /etc/resolve.conf? 
It contains the details of nameserver,  i.e.,  details of your DNS server which helps us connect to Internet. 
 
29. What is the use of /etc/hosts file? 
To map any hostname to its relevant IP address.

35. What is a 3 way handshake protocol? Give an example of it. 
SYN - system 1 sends SYN signal to remote system. 
SYN-ACK - remote system receives the syn signal and sends ack signal. 
ACK - system again receives ack signal from remote system and connection is established. 
For Example: When you ping to a machine you are sending a SYN signal which is ACK by the remote 
machine then it sends a SYN ACK signal back to the host machine. Then the host machine receives SYN 
ACK and sends the  
ACK signal back to confirm the same. 
 
36. What are the possible ways to check if your system is listening to port 67? 
 
# nmap localhost | grep 67 
 
# netstat -ntulp | grep 67 
 
37. Explain about IPV6? 
It's  length is  128 bits. It's  netmask is  64 
# nmcli connection modify  "System eth0"  ipv6.addresses   2005:db8:0:1::a00:1/64 ipv6.method static  
  
 
 
     (to add the IPV6 version of IP address to the connection  "System eth0" ) 
# nmcli connection modify  "System eth0"  ipv4.addresses  '172.25.5.11/24  172.25.5.254'  ipv4.dns     
172.25.254.254   ipv4.dns-search  example.com   ipv4.method   static  ipv6. addresses  2005:ac18::45/64      
ipv6.method  static 
 
(to assign  ipv4  and  ipv6  IP addresses  to  "System eth0 connection) 
# nmcli connection  down  "System eth0" 
(to  down  the  "System eth0"  connection) 
# nmcli connection  up  "System eth0" 
(to  up  the  "System eth0"  connection)

38. How to troubleshoot if the network is not reaching? 
(i)  First  check the network cable is connected   or   not  by  # ethtool    <NIC  device name>   command. if 
connected then check the IP address is assigned or not by  # ifconfig    <NIC device name>   command. 
(ii  Then  check  the system  uptime  by  # uptime    command. 
(iii) Then  check the network services status  by  # service  network  status   and    
# service  NetworkManager   
status    commands. 
(iv)   Then  check the network service at Run Level  by  # Chkconfig     --list    network   command. 
(v)   Then check whether the source network and destination network are in the same domain  or  not. 
(v)   Then finally check the routing table  by  # route   -n   command. 
 
 
Other  useful  commands : 
 
# ping  <IP address  or  hostname> 
 
(to check the pinging) 
Normally the ping command pings continuously until a stop signal reaches by  Ctrl + c, so to avoid 
continuous pinging by  
 
# ping  -c  <number><IP address>  
 
(to ping upto the specified no of times) 
 
# ipcalc   -m   <IP address)  
(to find the subnet mask for that specified IP address) 
Normally IP addresses are assigned by  ISP (Internet Service Provider)  and  managed by  IANA (Internet 
Assign Number Authority) 
 
# ifconfig  
 
 
 
(to see or check all the NIC device names  and IP  addresses)

# nslookup   <IP address>  
 
 
(to resolve IP to name) 
 
# nslookup  <hostname>  
 
 
(to resolve name to IP)

Chapter#5 –Managing SELinux  
1. 
What is SELinux? 
It is a one type of security that enhances the security that allows users and administrators more control 
over which users and applications can access which resources, such as files, Standard Linux access 
controls etc., 
It is mainly used to protect internal data (not from external data) from system services. In real time 
SELinux is disabled and instead of this IP tables are used. It protects all the services, files and directories 
by default if SELinux is enabled. 
 
2. 
In how many ways we can implement the SELinux? Explain them. 
 
We can implement the SELinux mainly in 2 modes. 
 
(i)   Enabled  
 
(ii)  Disabled (default mode) 
 
Enabled : 
 
Enabled means enabling the SELinux policy and this mode of SELinux is divided into two parts. 
 
(a)  Enforcing 
 
(b)  Permissive 
 
Disabled : 
 
Disabled means disabling the SELinux policy. 
 
3.  
What is Enforcing mode in SELinux? 
Enforcing means SELinux is on. It checks SELinux policy and stored a log. No can access the services by 
default but we can change the policy whenever we needed. 
 
4. 
What is Permissive mode in SELinux? 
SELinux is on and it don't check SELinux policy and stored the log. Everybody can access the services by 
default and we can also change the SELinux policy. It is also called as debugging mode or 
troubleshooting mode. In this mode SELinux policies and rules are applied to subjects and objects but 
actions are not affected.  
 
5. 
What is Disabled mode in SELinux? 
SELinux is turned off and no warning and log messages will be generated and stored. 
 
6. 
What are Booleans? 
Booleans are variables that can either be set as true or false. Booleans enhance the effect of SELinux 
policies implemented by the System Administrators. A policy may protects certain deamons or services 
by applying various access control rules. 
 
7.  
What is SELinux policy? 
The SELinux policy is the set of rules that guide the SELinux security engine. It defines types for file 
objects and domains for process. It uses roles to limit the domains that can be entered and the user 
identities to specify the role that can be attained.

8. 
What are the required files for SELinux? 
 
#  vim  /etc/selinux/config 
 
-----> 
It is main file for SELinux. 
 
# vim   /etc/sysconfig/selinux 
-----> 
It is a link file to the above file. 
 
# vim  /var/log/audit/audit.log -----> 
SELinux log messages will be stored in this file. 
 
9. 
what is the command to see the SELinux mode? 
 
# getenforce 
 
(to check the SELinux mode) 
 
10. What is command to set the SELinux mode temporarily? 
# setenforce    0   or   1 
(to set the SELinux mode.  Where  ' 0 '  ----->   permissive  and ' 1 '  ----->  
Enforcing) 
Note :  (i)  To change the SELinux mode from Permissive to Enforcing   or  Enforcing to Permissive modes 
the system restart is not required. 
        (ii)  To change Enforcing mode to Disabled mode   or  Disabled mode to Enforcing mode the system 
  
restart is required. 
        (iii) The above commands are changed the SELinux mode temporarily only. To make the selinux 
changes permanently then open    /etc/selinux/config   and go to , 
  
SELINUX=Enforcing    or   Permissive   or   Disabled 
 
 
(save and exit this file) 
 
11. What is command to see the SELinux policy details? 
 
# sestatus 
 
 
(to see the SELinux policy details) 
 
Other useful commands : 
 
# ls   -Z    <file name> 
 
(to see the SELinux context of the file) 
 
# ls    -ldZ <directory name> 
(to see the SELinux context of the directory)

Chapter#6 – Booting Procedure and Kernel Parameters  
1. 
Explain the booting procedure? 
 
In Linux systems the booting is done in 6 stages. 
BIOS 
MBR 
GRUB 
Kernel 
Init 
Runlevel 
 
BIOS : 
BIOS stands for Basic Input and Output System. Whenever we power on the system , the system runs self 
diagnostic checks and detects all the connected input and out peripherals. This process is called POST 
(Power On Self Test). If any errors found it displays on the screen. Then BIOS locates the booting disk in 
the system and  locates and loads the Primary boot loader nothing but MBR (Master Boot Record) into 
the memory. So, in simple terms the BIOS loads the MBR into memory and executes the MBR. 
 
MBR : 
MBR stands for Master Boot Record. It is located in the  1st sector of the bootable disk (it may be  
/dev/hda  or   /dev/sda). The size of the MBR is 512 bytes and it contains three components. 
(i) 
Primary boot loader information and its size is 446 bytes. 
(ii) Partition table information and its size is 64 bytes. 
(iii) MBR validation check and its size is 2 bytes. Its main purpose is whether the MBR is valid  or  not. 
The primary boot loader contains the secondary boot loader nothing but GRUB  or  LILO (in old systems).  
Then primary boot loader locates and loads the secondary boot loader into memory. 
So, in simple terms the MBR loads and executes the GRUB boot loader. 
 
GRUB  or  LILO : 
GRUB stands for Grand Unified Boot loader. LILO stands for Linux Loader and is used in old Linux 
systems. If we  
have multiple kernel images installed in our system, we can choose which one to be 
executed. GRUB displays a splash screen, waits for few seconds. If we do not enter anything, it loads the 
default kernel image as specified in the grub configuration file. GRUB has the knowledge of the file 
system (the old LILO didn't understand the system). GRUB configuration file is  /boot/grub/grub.conf  
(/etc/grub.conf  is a link to this). This file contains kernel  and  initrd images. So, in simple terms GRUB 
just loads and executes kernel and initrd images. 
 
Kernel : 
Kernel initialises itself and loads the kernel modules and mounts the root file system as specified in the 
"root="  in grub.conf and then kernel executes the  /sbin/init  program. Since init was the 1st program 
to be executed by Linux kernel, it has the process ID (PID) of  1. We can see this id by   # ps   -ef  |  
grep  init    command. initrd  
stands for initial RAM Disk. initrd  is used by kernel as temporary file 
system until kernel is booted and the real root the file system is mounted. It also contains necessary 
drivers compiled inside which helps it to access the  
hard drive partitions and other hardware.

init  level : 
In this init program reads the  /etc/inittab   file and put the system into specified run level. init identifies 
the default run level from   /etc/inittab   file and we can change the this default run level whenever we 
needed. We can find the default run level  by   # grep   "initdefault"   /etc/inittab    command on our 
system. Normally the default run level  in Linux is  3 in CLI (Command Line Interface) mode and   5 in GUI 
(Graphical  User  Interface)mode. 
 
Run Level Programs : 
The following run levels are available in Linux systems. 
0     ----->     halt  or  shutdown the system 
1     ----->     Single user mode 
2     ----->     Multi user without  NFS 
3     ----->     Full multi user mode but no GUI and only CLI mode 
4     ----->     Unused 
5     ----->     Full multi user mode with GUI  (X11  system) 
6     ----->     reboot the system 
Whenever we start the Linux system is booting we can see various services getting started. Those 
services are  
located in different run levels programs executed from the run level directory as 
defined by our default run  
level. Depending on our default init level setting, the system will 
execute the programs from one of the  following directories. 
Run level  0     ----->     /etc/rc.d/rc0.d 
Run level  1     ----->     /etc/rc.d/rc1.d 
Run level  2     ----->     /etc/rc.d/rc2.d 
Run level  3     ----->     /etc/rc.d/rc3.d 
Run level  4     ----->     /etc/rc.d/rc4.d 
Run level  5     ----->     /etc/rc.d/rc5.d 
Run level  6     ----->     /etc/rc.d/rc6.d 
The above directories are also having symbolic links available for those directories under  /etc/rc0.d,   
/etc/rc1.d, ....etc.,  So, the   /etc/rc0.d  is linked to   /etc/rc.d/rc0.d 
 
Booting procedure in RHEL - 7: 
Upto kernel the booting process is same as the above.  /boot/grub2/grub.conf   is the GRUB 
configuration file in  
RHEL - 7. systemd  is the initial process in RHEL - 7 and its process ID  is 1. 
linux16  read the root ( / ) file system and then initrd16process will mount the root ( / ) file system in 
read & 
write mode and starts the systemdprocess.  And the systemd process will read the  /etc/fstab  
file and  mount all the file systems. Then it reads the file  /etc/systemd/system/default.target   file 
and brings the  system into the default run level according to the scripts the processes will start  or  
stop.

First open the   /etc/inittab   file by  # vim  /etc/inittab   command and go to last line change the run 
level  
number as we required and then reboot the system  by  # init 6   command. After rebooting the 
system check  
the current run level  by   # who   -r   command. 
 
4. 
How to start the graphical interface if the system is in run level  3  now? 
 
# startx     
(it changes the run level  3  to  5  and reboots the system) 
 
5. 
How to troubleshoot if the boot disk is not available? 
 
(i)  First check the hard disk is present in the system or not. If not present connect the hard disk  
           and restart the system. 
 
(iv) 
If the hard disk is present, then go to BIOS  and find the location of the hard disk. 
 
(v) Check the boot priority in the BIOS. If boot priority is not the hard disk then change it to hard  
disk and restart the system. 
 
 
 
          (iv) Even though the system is not started then boot the system with CDROM in single user mode  
and open the  /boot/grub/grub.conf  file and see the hard disk name and partition number.  Normally it 
should be /dev/hda1 (if the hard disk is IDE hard disk)   or   /dev/sda1 (if the hard disk is SATA  or  SCSI).  
If the hard disk name and partition number is different instead of the original then change them and 
reboot the system with hard disk. 
 
(v)If the  GRUB  is corrupted then reboot the system with CDROM in single user mode and restore the 
grub information from the recent backup and then restart the system with hard disk. 
 
6. 
How to reboot the production server? 
(i)  In general the production servers will not be rebooted frequently because the end users will suffer if 
the productions server are in down state. If any changes made to the system like grub, selinux policy, 
default run level is changed and if kernel patches are applied the system reboot is required. 
 
(ii)   If any inconsistency is root ( / ) file system, then take the business approval from higher 
authorities,make a plan for proper scheduleand also inform to the different teams like application team 
to stop the application, databaseteam to stop the databases, QC  team to stop the testing, monitoring 
people to ignore the alerts from thisserver and other teams if any  and then reboot the system 
withCDROM in single user mode and  
then run #fsck command on that file system. 
 
(iii)  If  O/S  disk is corrupted  or  damaged then, reboot the system temporarily with the mirror disk then 
fix that  problem and again boot the system with original disk. 
 
7. 
What is the difference between  # reboot  and  # init 6   commands? 
 
Both commands are used to restart  or  reboot  the system. 
 
# reboot   command will not send the kill signals to the system and it will kill all the running 
          processes  and services forcefully  and then restart the system. 
 
# init 6   command will send the kill signals to the system and it will stop all the processes  and  
           services one by one and then restart the system.

8. 
What is console port and how to connect to the console port? 
Console port is used to connect the system even though the system is not booted with the main  O/S. 
This port  is used to connect the system for troubleshooting purpose only.  We can connect the console 
port as same as  connect to systems LAN port and it is also having IP address, user name and password 
to connect to the console. 
 
There are different types of console ports for different types of servers. They are given below.  
 
Server Name 
Name of the Console port 
Expansion name 
DELL 
DRAC   or   i-DRAC 
DRAC  --->  DELL  Remote  Access  Controllers 
i-DRAC  --->  Integrated  DELL  Remote Access 
                                                               Controllers 
IBM  Power  series 
HMC 
Hardware  Management  Console 
HP 
ILO 
Integrated  Light  Out 
 
 
9. 
System is continuously rebooting. How to troubleshoot it? 
 
(i)   Connect the system through console port through putty by providing  IP address, user name  
          and password.   
(vi) At  console prompt and boot with CDROM in single user mode and mount the root ( /  --->  O/S) 
          file system on temporary mount point. 
(vii) Check any wrong entries in the cron jobs ie., crontab editor see any reboot scripts are there or not. 
If found remove those entries and reboot the system. 
 
(iv)  If the above is not resolved, then check the memory (RAM). 
(viii) If  RAM module is not working the system get panic and it may continuously reboots. 
(ix) If the RAM module is working then check the RAM size whether the sufficient RAM that requires 
                   to run the application is available or not. If not there then increasing the RAM size may be resolve  
                   this issue. 
 
(vii)   Check   "/var/log/messages"   file for any messages regarding continuous rebooting. 
(x) 
Even though there is a sufficient  RAM may be swap space is not sufficient to run all the  
services and  applications then system get panic and may continuously reboots. If so, then 
increasing the swap size may  resolve this issue. 
 
10. What is TCP handshaking? 
 
The procedure that takes place between two TCP/IP nodes to establish a connection. Known as the 
 
Synchronization, Synchronize-Acknowledgement  and  Acknowledgement  handshake.  
For example if computer A transmits a Synchronize packet to computer B, which sends back a 
Synchronize- Acknowledge packet to compute A. Computer A then transmits an Acknowledge packet to 
computer B  and the connection is established. This whole above said process is called the TCP 
handshaking. 
 
11. How many links will be created when we create the directory? 
 
Whenever we create any directory there are two links will be created. 
 
12. What are the differences between  run level 2   and  run level 3? 
 
Run Level 2 : 
(i) 
It supports multiuser operations.

SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|57 
 
 
 
(ii)        Multiple users can access the system. 
(iii) 
All the system deamons will run except  NFS  and some other network service related  
deamons. 
 
  (iv) 
So, without  NFS  we can use all other services. 
 
 
 
Run Level 3 : 
 
(i)        It is also supports Multi user operations. 
 
(ii)       Multiple users can access the system. 
 
(iii)      All the system deamons  including   NFS  and other network related service deamons will run. 
 
(iv)     So, we can avail all the services including  NFS  also. 
 
13. Server running in single user mode, can you login remotely and how? 
 
We can login to the system remotely in single user mode also but it is possible to connect to console 
instead of LAN port through putty tool by giving IP address, user name and password. Then console port 
appears and boot the system with CDROM in single user mode. 
 
14. How to check the present kernel version? 
 
# uname   -r  
 
 
(it displays the present kernel version) 
 
# uname   -a 
 
 
(it displays the present kernel version with other details) 
 
# cat  /boot/grub/grub.conf 
(in this file also we can find the kernel version) 
 
15. What is the command to see the system architecture? 
 
# arch 
or  
 
          # uname    -m 
(both commands gives the architecture of the system) 
 
16. How to check the version of the O/S ? 
 
# cat  /etc/redhat-release 
 
(gives the version of the O/S) 
 
17. How to repair the corrupted boot loader and recover it? 
This problems may be occur  if the GRUB is corrupted. So, we have to recover the GRUB. Basically the 
repairing of GRUB means installing the new grub on the existing one from RHEL - 6 DVD. The steps are 
given below. 
(i) 
Insert the RHEL - 6 DVD and make sure that system should boot from CD/DVD. 
(ii) Boot the system in Rescue Installed System mode. 
(iii) Select the language with which we want to continue and click on OK. 
(iv) Select the Keyboard type as  US  and click OK. 
(v) Select  Local CD/DVD  and click OK. 
 
(vi)  Move the cursor to NO to ignore the Networking. 
 
(vii) Move the cursor to  Continue tab  to mount the root ( / ) from  CD/DVD  and press  Enter key. 
(viii) Now the root ( / ) file system is mounted on  /mnt/sysimage, here  click on OK and  Press Enter to 
continue. 
 
(ix)  Select the  "shell  Start  shell"  option and click on OK, then shell will be displayed on screen. 
 
(xi)  At shell prompt  type as  # chroot   /mnt/sysimage   command,  press Enter.  
 
(xii) Check the  /boot   partition  by    
                  # fdisk   -l    command.

(xiii) Install the new grub on the boot device  ie., may be  /dev/sda2   by   
           # grub-install   <device name> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
command  (For example   
          # grub-install   /dev/sda2). 
 
(xiv) If it show no error reported that means we have successfully recovered the grub. 
 
(xv) Then type   # exit   command  and again type   
                  # exit   or  
                 # reboot   command  to reboot the system. 
 
18. What are Modules  or  Kernel Modules? How to find the Kernel Modules? 
The drivers is Linux system are known as Modules  or  Kernel Modules. These modules are assigned by 
kernel  
depending on the hardware. Hardware can only be communicated and can work efficiently 
when the proper  module is loaded in the kernel. we can find the kernel modules by  # ls  
/etc/lib/modules   command. 
All the kernel modules in the system will be ended with  " .ko "  extension. So, we can see all the modules 
in the  
system  by   # find   /   -name    *.ko    command. 
 
19. What other commands related to kernel modules? 
 
# lsmod  
 
 
 
 
(to list all the currently loaded modules) 
 
# lsmod  |grep   -i   <module name> 
(to check whether the particular module is loaded or not) 
 
# lsmod  |grep   -i   fat 
 
 
 
(to check the fat module is loaded or not) 
 
There might be a situation where our module is not working properly, in that case we have to  
           remove that module and re-install it again by, 
 
# modprobe    -r    <module name> 
 
 
(to remove the specified module) 
 
# modprobe    -r    fat 
 
 
 
(to remove the fat module) 
 
# modprobe     <module name>  
 
(to install  or  re-install the module) 
 
# modprobe     fat 
 
 
 
 
(to install  or  re-install the module) 
 
# modinfo 
<module name> 
 
 
(to see the specified module information) 
 
# uname  
 
 
 
 
(to see the which  O/S is present in the system) 
 
# uname    -s 
 
 
 
 
(to see which  O/S  kernel is this either Linux  or  Unix) 
 
# rpm    -qa    kernel      --last 
 
 
(to see the kernel installation date and time) 
 
# rpm    -qa    kernel* 
 
 
 
(to see how many kernels are there in the system) 
 
# ls   /proc 
 
 
 
 
 
(to see the kernel processes information) 
 
# ls   /boot 
 
 
 
 
 
(to see the present kernel version created time)
 
# ls   /etc/lib/modules 
 
 
 
(installed kernel module drivers) 
 
# ls   /usr/src 
 
 
 
 
(kernel source code location) 
 
# kudzu  
 
 
 
 
(to scan the new hardware in RHEL - 4) 
 
# depmod 
 
 
 
 
(to scan the new hardware from RHEL - 5, 6 and 7) 
 
# rmmod <module name> 
 
 
(to remove the specified module) 
 
# insmod <module name> 
 
(to install the kernel module without dependency modules)

# modprobe    -r    usb_storage  
(remove the USB module, if it is mounted it will not remove) 
 
# umount     /<mount point> 
 
 
(to unmount the USB if it is mounted) 
 
# vim   /etc/modprobe.d/blocklist.conf (it will open the blocklist.conf file, then put an entry of USB) 
 
     blocklist     usb_storage 
 
 
 
(after type this save and exit this file) 
 
22. What is " wait "  and where it is stored? 
 
(i)  If there is not enough memory to run the process, then it will wait for free space in memory.  
           That process is called  wait. 
(xi) wait is stored in buffer like cache memory. 
 
23. What is run level? 
 
(i) Run level  is nothing but to put the system in different levels to perform different maintenance modes. 
 
(ii) There are  7  run levels. Those are  0,   1,   2,   3,   4,   5  and   6. 
 
(iii) The above levels are used to put the system in different stages to avail different services. 
 
24. What is the default run level? 
 
(i) When we boot the server the system automatically go to one particular run level.  
           That run level is called the default run level. 
(xii) In Linux the default run level is  5  in GUI   and   3  in  CLI. 
 
(iii) We can modify the default run level by put an entry in  /etc/inittab   file. 
 
25. Which run level are you using? 
 
Run level  3. 
 
26. How to change the run level temporarily? 
 
# init    <run level no.> 
 
(to change the run level temporarily) 
 
Example :  # init 0   or    
                              #init 1   or   
                              # init 2   or  
                              # init 3   or     
                              #init 4   or     
                              #init 5    or     
                              #init 6 
 
27. Can I mount on two disks alternatively when booting? 
No it is not possible to mount on two disks alternatively when booting because we can specify only one 
disk as boot disk but not two disks as booting disks in BIOS settings.So, it is not possible to mount on two 
disks alternatively when booting.

Chapter#7 – Job Automation  
1. 
What is Job scheduling? 
The process of creating the jobs and make them occur on the system repeatedly hourly, daily, weekly, 
monthly  and yearly is called Job scheduling. In Linux and other Unix systems this process is handled by 
the cron service  or  deamon called  crondand  atd is the at jobs deamon  which can be used to schedule 
the tasks (also called as  jobs). 
 
2. 
What is the importance of the job scheduling? 
The importance of the job scheduling is that the critical tasks like backups, which the client usually 
wants to be taken in nights, can easily performed without the intervention of the administrator by 
scheduling a cron job. If  the cron job is scheduled carefully then the backup  will be taken at any given 
time of the client and there will be no need for the administrator to remain back at nights to take the 
backup. 
 
3. 
What are the differences between  cron  and  at  jobs? 
 
cron job : 
(i) cron  jobs are scheduling jobs automatically at a particular time, day of the week, week of the 
month and month of the year. 
(ii) The job may be a file  or  file system. 
(iii) We cannot get the information as a log file if the job was failed to execute ie., when it was failed 
       and where is was failed and also cannot execute automatically the failed jobs.  
 
 
at job : 
(iv) at  jobs are executes only once. 
(v) Here also we cannot get the information if the job is failed and it is also do not execute the failed 
jobs automatically. 
 
4. 
What are the important files related to cron and at jobs? 
/etc/crontab   ----->   is the file which stores all the scheduled jobs. 
/etc/cron.deny   ----->   is the file used to restrict the users from using cron jobs. 
/etc/cron.allow   ----->   is used to allow only users whose names are mentioned in this file to use  
                                          cron jobs and this file does not exist by default. 
/etc/at.deny   ----->same as cron.deny for restricting the users to use at jobs. 
/etc/at.allow   ----->   same as cron.allow for allowing users to use at jobs. 
 
5. 
What is the format of the cron job? 
 
# crontab    -e 
 
 
 
(to edit the cron job editor to create or remove the cron jobs) 
 
<minutes><hours><day of the month><month of the year><day of the week><job  or  script> 
 
(0 - 59)      (0 - 23) 
(1 - 31) (1 - 12  or jan, feb, ...) (0 - 6 or sun, mon, ...)

For allow 
For deny 
(i)   Open   /etc/cron.allow   file. 
(i)   Open   /etc/cron.deny   file. 
(ii)  Put the entries of the user names whom do we    
       want to allow the cron  jobs. 
(ii)  Put the entries of the user names whom do we    
       want to deny the cron  jobs. 
 
8. 
What is at job  and  atq  source? 
 
(i)  at  jobs are executes only once.

(export the defined  editor) 
(iv) # crontab   -e  
 
(to edit the crontab) 
 
11. How to troubleshoot if the  cron  job failed? 
 
(i)  See the crontab entries for syntactical errors. If there are any errors then correct 
           them, otherwise it will not execute.  
 
 
(ii)  Check whether the  crond  deamon is working or not. If it is running, then stop the deamon  
          and again start the deamon. Even though the problem occurs, then the  crontab  entries may be wrong. 
 
(v) 
If all the above are  ok, then see whether the user who executing  cron  job has permissions to 
execute the  cron  jobs  or  not ie., check the user entries in  /etc/cron.allow   and   /etc/cron.deny   
files. 
 
(vi)  If all are  ok, again put the job entry in crontab and execute it. 
 
12. How to schedule the cron task  or  job? 
 
(i)  Open one shell script file..

(ii) Enter all the commands which are required to complete the task  or  job. 
(iii) If the job requires more  CPU  and  more memory, then schedule those jobs at night time or non-
peak hours (generally night time is the non-peak time). 
 
(iv) Then open  crontab  editor by  
           # crontab    -e    <user name>   command and then put the entries as below, 
 
 <minutes><hours><day of the month><month of the year><day of the week><script name with path> 
 
(v) Save and exit from the  crontab  editor. 
 
13. How to add  at  job  and  delete the  at  job? 
 
Adding :  
(i) 
# at    <time>  
(to  enter the  at  job) 
(ii) 
Before that open a file  vim and enter the job commands in that file and save as  xxxx.sh  
            (some name with   
extension must be as  .sh) 
(iii) 
Enter the above saved file name within the  at  job editor. 
(iv) 
Press  Ctrl + d  to exit from the editor. 
(v) 
Then system will assign a  job  id  to that  job. We can see the list of at  jobs  by  # atq   command. 
 
 
Delete : 
(vi) 
See the  job  id  which job we want to delete by  # atq   command and note that  job  id. 
(vii) 
Then delete that  job  by   # at   -r    <job  id>   command. 
 
14. How to know currently scheduled  at  jobs? 
 
# atq 
 
 
 
(to see the currently scheduled  at  jobs) 
 
15. How to allow  or  deny  at  jobs for a user? 
 
For allow 
For deny 
(i)   Open   /etc/at.allow   file. 
(i)   Open   /etc/at.deny   file. 
(ii)  Put the entries of the user names whom do we    
       want to allow the  at  jobs. 
(ii)  Put the entries of the user names whom do we    
       want to deny the  at  jobs.

Chapter#8 – Administrating Remote Systems  
1. 
What is remote administration and explain it? 
 
(i)     Remote administration means administration of servers which are located in remotely. 
 
(ii)    Normally servers are placed in datacenters  like books arranged in a rack. 
 
(iii)   These datacenters are normally located in US, UK and Australia ... etc., 
 
(iv)   Generally we login as normal user in local systems and get the remote desktop or console  
                    using remote desktop tools like putty, VNC server,  ... etc., 
(vi) If it is through remote desktop, we can manage the servers using the GUI tools. 
(vii) If it is through putty, we can manage the serves using command line interface only. In both ways 
                   we should give server name or IP address, port no., user name and password. 
 
2. 
What is SSH and explain it? 
SSH  is stands for  Secure Shell. It was designed and created to provide the best security when accessing 
another computer remotely. Not only does it encrypt the session, it also provides better authentication 
facilities. On windows systems install the putty software and through putty we can access the remote 
system by configuring ssh. SSh is protocol which facilitates secured communication between two 
systems using  Client-Server  architecture and allows users to login to the server host systems remotely. 
It is used to connect to remote system and perform administrative task or jobs. By default  ssh takes 
password authentication mechanism and its port no. is  22. Through ssh the data will be transferred in 
encrypted format. 
 
3. 
What is telnet? 
Telnet is a mechanism to connect and to administrate the remote system from local system. This is the 
oldest program which is available on most network capable operating systems. Accessing a remote shell 
account through the telnet method is danger because in that everything that you send or receive over 
that telnet session is visible in plain text on your local network  and the local network of the machine you 
are connecting to. So, anyone can  sniff  the connection in-between can see our user name, password, 
email and other messages that we read and command that we run. For these reasons we need a more 
sophisticated program than telnet to connect to a remote host. 
 
4. 
What are the differences between Telnet  and  SSH?  
Telnet 
SSH 
(a) Through telnet we can connect the remote   
      system, but any network hacker may see the  
transferred data.  And the telnet  port no. is  23. 
(a) Through  ssh  also we can connect the remote   
      system, but nobody can see the transferred data. 
       And the ssh port no. is  22. 
(b) Data will be transferred in non-encrypted format. 
(b) Data will be transferred in encrypted format. 
(c) We cannot trust this telnet connection. 
(c) We can trust this  ssh connection. 
(d) We cannot give the trusting in telnet. 
(d) We can give the trusting in ssh.

(e) By snooping or sniffing technologies we can see  
      the data like system or hostname, login name,  
password and other data. 
      So, there is no security. 
(e) By snooping or sniffing technologies we cannot  
see the data like system name or hostname, login  
name, password and other data. 
      So, there is a security  
(f) # telnet<IP address of the remote system> 
         (provide login name and password) 
(f) # ssh<IP address of the remote system> 
          (provide login name and password) 
 
5. 
In how many ways we can connect the remote host through ssh? 
 
Through  ssh we can connect the remote host by two methods.  
 
(i) 
Command Line Interface  (CLI).   
 
 
Example :   # ssh   <IP address of the remote system>  (provide login name and password) 
 
(ii) Graphical User Interface  (GUI). 
 
 
Example :  open VNS server window and provide remote hostname, login name and password. 
 
6. 
What are the requirements for ssh? 
 
(i) 
Remote systems IP address. 
 
(ii) Remote systems user name and password 
 
(iii) A proper network ie., our local and remote systems should be in the same network. 
 
(iv) Open ssh package to configure the ssh. 
 
7. 
In how many ways we can connect the remote system? 
 
(i) 
telnet 
 
 
(ii)  ssh 
 
(iii)   rlogin 
 
 
(iv) rcp 
 
(v) ftp  
 
 
(vi) scp 
 
(vii) sftp  
 
 
(viii) tftp 
 
8. 
What is the syntax for ssh? 
 
# ssh    <IP address of the remote system>     -l     <user name> 
 
# ssh    <user name>@<IP address of the remote system> 
 
# ssh    <user name>@<remote hostname with fully qualified domain name> 
 
*   After executing any of the above commands, it may asks user name and password.  
          Then type user name and              
           passwords to connect the remote systems. 
 
9. 
How to configure the ssh with keybased authentication  or explain the ssh trusting? 
 
(i) 
SSH  keybased authentication is used to access the remote system without asking any passwords. 
 
(ii) For that, first we have to generate the public and private keys by executing   
                  # ssh-keygen   command on our  
system. Then the public and private keys are generated  
                 in   /home/<user name>/.ssh    location. ie., .ssh 
directory in users home directory.  
                 And the keys are   id_rsa (private key)  and   id_rsa.pub  (public key). 
 
(iii) Then copy the public key   id_rsa.pub   on the remote system by executing the below command. 
 
 
# ssh-copy-id    -i    <user name>@<IP address of the remote system> 
 
(iv)  Go to remote system and check whether the above key is copied or not by  # cat   /home/<user 
 
name>/.ssh/authorized_keys    file.  And the private key should be in our system. 
(vi) Whenever we are trying to establish a connection the public key on remote system should

SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|67 
 
 
         be   matched with  the private key on our system. otherwise there is no connection is established. 
(vii)  If both public and private keys are matched then connection will be established and first time it will 
ask the  
password. Once the connection is established, next time onwards it won't ask any 
passwords. 
 
 
# ssh    <user name>@<remote hostname  or  IP address>       (first time it will asks the password) 
(viii) The authentication is done through the public and private keys, so this type of authentication 
 is called  keybased  authentication. 
 
10. How to prevent the remote login  root user  or  how to configure the ssh to prevent the  
          remote login for root? 
 
(i) 
The location of the ssh configuration file is   /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
 
(ii) Open the configuration file by    # vim   /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
                ----->   go to line no.  42 (in RHEL - 6)  or 
                ----->   go to line no.  48  (in RHEL - 7)  PermitRootLogin     yes  and uncomment that line and type  
           as   " no "  in place of " yes " andsave and exit this file. 
 
(iii) Then restart the or reload the sshd deamon by   
 
# service  sshd  restart 
 
 
 
(to restart the sshd  deamon or service in RHEL - 6) 
 
# systemctl restart sshd  
 
 
(to restart the sshd deamon or service in RHEL - 7) 
 
# chkconfig  sshd  on 
 
 
 
(to enable the sshd deamon at next reboot in RHEL - 6) 
 
# systemctl  enable sshd  
 
(to enable the sshd deamon at next reboot in RHEL - 7) 
 
# service  sshd  reload 
 
 
 
(to reload the sshd deamon in RHEL - 6) 
 
# systemctl  reload  sshd  
 
(to reload the sshd deamon in RHEL - 7) 
 
(iv) Then no root user cannot access our system remotely through ssh service. 
 
11. How to allow the remote users to run GUI commands through ssh? 
 
(i) 
Open ssh configuration file by  # vim  /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
 
 
----->   go to line no.  109 in RHEL - 6  or  
 
 
----->   go to line no.  117 in RHEL - 7  X11 Forwarding   no 
 
 
            type as   " yes "   in place of   " no "   then save and exit this file. 
 
 
*   If it is  yes,  then GUI commands can be executed on the remote system. 
 
 
*   If it is no,  then GUI commands cannot be executed on the remote system. 
 
(ii) Then restart the sshd service or deamon to effect the above modification by 
 
# service  sshd  restart 
 
 
 
(to restart the sshd  deamon or service in RHEL - 6) 
 
# systemctl restart sshd  
 
 
(to restart the sshd deamon or service in RHEL - 7) 
 
# chkconfig  sshd  on 
 
 
 
(to enable the sshd deamon at next reboot in RHEL - 6) 
 
# systemctl  enable sshd  
 
(to enable the sshd deamon at next reboot in RHEL - 7) 
 
# service  sshd  reload 
 
 
 
(to reload the sshd deamon in RHEL - 6) 
 
# systemctl  reload  sshd  
 
(to reload the sshd deamon in RHEL - 7) 
 
(iii) # gedit 
 
 
 
 
 
(to open the gedit editor on remotely) 
 
12. How to allow empty password through ssh? 
 
(i) 
Open the ssh configuration file by  # vim  /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
 
 
----->   go to line no.  65 in RHEL - 6   or 
 
 
----->   go to line no.  77 in RHEL - 7      PermitEmptyPassword    no 
 
 
             type as   " yes "   in place of    " no "   then save and exit this file.

         *   If it is  yes, then the remote system will be allow the users with empty password ie., without password. 
 
 
*   If it is  no,  then the remote system will not be allow the users with empty passwords. 
 
(ii) Then restart the sshd service or deamon to effect the above modifications by 
 
# service  sshd  restart 
 
 
 
(to restart the sshd  deamon or service in RHEL - 6) 
 
# systemctl restart sshd  
 
 
(to restart the sshd deamon or service in RHEL - 7) 
 
# chkconfig  sshd  on 
 
 
 
(to enable the sshd deamon at next reboot in RHEL - 6) 
 
 
# systemctl  enable sshd 
 
 
(to enable the sshd deamon at next reboot in RHEL - 7) 
 
 
# service  sshd  reload 
 
 
 
(to reload the sshd deamon in RHEL - 6) 
 
 
# systemctl  reload  sshd 
 
 
(to reload the sshd deamon in RHEL - 7) 
          (iii) Now, the users who are having empty passwords are also access the remote systems through ssh. 
 
13. How to prevent the password authentication mechanism in ssh? 
 
(i) 
Open the ssh configuration file by  # vim  /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
 
 
----->   go to line no.  66 in RHEL - 6   or 
 
 
----->   go to line no.  78 in RHEL - 7      PasswordAuthentication    no 
 
 
             type as   " no "   in place of    " yes "   then save and exit this file. 
 
 
*   If it is  yes,  then the remote system will ask the password. 
 
 
*   If it is  no,  then the remote system will not ask any type of passwords. 
 
(ii) Then restart the sshd service or deamon to effect the above modifications by 
 
# service  sshd  restart 
 
 
 
(to restart the sshd  deamon or service in RHEL - 6) 
 
# systemctl restart sshd  
 
 
(to restart the sshd deamon or service in RHEL - 7) 
 
# chkconfig  sshd  on

(to reload the sshd deamon in RHEL - 6) 
 
 
# systemctl  reload  sshd 
 
 
(to reload the sshd deamon in RHEL - 7) 
 
   (iii) Now, we can access the remote systems through ssh without Password Authentication mechanism. 
 
14. How to allow  or  deny the uses or group to access the remote systems through ssh? 
 
(i) 
If we want to allow  or  deny the particular users then go to last line of the ssh configuration 
                   file and type as 
 
 
DenyUsers <user 1><user 2><user3>  ...etc.,  (these users will be denied the ssh service) 
 
 
AllowUsers <student><user 4><user 5> ...etc.,  (these users will be allowed the ssh service) 
 
 
DenyGroup <group 1><group 2><group 3> ...etc., (these group users will be denied the ssh service) 
 
         AllowGroup <group 1><group 2><group 3> ..etc., (these group users will be allowed the ssh service)

17. How to check whether the ssh is running or not on remote host? 
 
# nmap   -p  22    <IP address of the remote host>(to see the ssh is running or not on remote system) 
 
18. How to troubleshoot if the client has complain that I am not accessing the server using ssh? 
(i)   First check the pinging of the client system. If it is not pinging then check the IP address of the client 
system. If client system and sever system are in different domains or networks it will not ping. So, bring 
the client system into the network of the server system. Check the network is working or not and also 
check whether the network cable is connected or not. 
 
(ii)  If both systems are pinging then check whether the   openssh   package is installed or not. If not 
installed  then install that package and configure ssh on the client system and restart the sshd deamon.  
 
(iii)  Check the client  <IP address  or  hostname>  in   /etc/hosts.deny  files. If there is an entry of the 
client system in this file, then remove that entry and restart the sshd deamon.  
 
(iv)  Finally open the ssh configuration file  by  # vim  /etc/ssh/sshd_config    and  see any client user 
name is  present or not and check other lines for client entries in this file, if present remove those 
entries, save that file and restart the sshd service. 
 
(v)  Finally check whether the client user is there in the server or not, if not create the client user, assign 
the  password share those details to client. If user is there then check whether the client user's  
password is locked, account expired and any other or not, if locked then remove the lock, if client 
account is expired then  activate that account, assign the password and make the ssh trusting between 
client and server systems. 
 
19. How to copy the file from our system to remote system? 
 
# scp   <source file name with full path><IP address of the remote system>:<destination location> 
 
Example: ssh   /root/script1 192.168.1.1:/root/script1 (to copy /root/script1 file into 192.168.1.1 system) 
 
ssh   -r   /root/raju/    192.168.1.1:/root/raju/ (to copy /root/raju  directory to remote system) 
 
*  scp  means  secured copy  to copy the files  or directories from local system to remote system. 
 
20. What is rsync and explain it? 
rsync  is a very good program for backing up  or  mirroring a directory tree of files from one machine to 
another machine and for keeping the two machines  " in sync ". It is designed to speedup file transfer by 
coping the differences between two files rather than coping an entire file every time. 
If  rsync  is combined with ssh, it makes a great utility to sync the data securely otherwise by sniffing any 
one can see our data ie., no security for our data. 
 
21. A system is able to ping locally  but not out site. Why? 
 
(i) 
May be there is no access to outside. 
 
(ii) May be outside is in different network from the local. 
 
(iii)  May be permission is denied for that system to access outside. 
(iv)  If there is access, but router or modem or network switch or NIC may not be working to access the 
outside. 
 
(v) May be outside is not available temporarily.

22. A system is echoing the ping, but not able to login via telnet. Why? 
 
(i) 
Check telnet service is started or not. If not started, start the telnet service. 
 
 
(ii) May be telnet service is disabled, if so, enable the telnet service. 
 
(iii)  May be telnet port is blocked, if so, release that port no. 
 
(iv) May be telnet permission is denied, if so, change the permissions to allow the telnet service. 
 
(v) Check all the files whether the telnet service is blocked or not, if blocked remove those entries. 
 
23. How will you login  or  start the system in what mode if you don't know the root password? 
 
(i) 
If the user having sudo permissions, then login as sudo user. 
 
(ii) If no sudo permissions then boot with CDROM in single user mode and start the system.  
          Then provide the  root password to root user if there is no root password.  
 
(iii) Even though  if it is not possible then finally break the root password. 
 
 
 
         Other useful commands : 
 
# telnet   <IP address   or  hostname> 
 
(to connect the specified remote system through telnet) 
 
# ssh   <IP address   or   hostname> 
 
(to connect the specified remote system through ssh) 
 
 
Username : xxxxxx 
 
 
Password : xxxxxxx 
 
# ssh   <IP address>    -l   <user name> 
 
(to connect the remote system using user name)

# w   -f 
 
 
 
(to see all the users who are login to our system with other details) 
 
# ssh    <IP address>     (if we not specified the user name, then it will ask the current users password and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        search the current account in remote system) 
 
# cat  /root/.ssh/known_hosts 
        (to see the ssh trusting remote hosts finger print information)

Chapter#9 – Memory and Swap Management  
1. 
What is swap? 
Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of the Physical memory  (RAM) is full. If the system needs 
more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in the memory are moved from RAM to 
swap space. It helps the machines which are having small amount RAM and it should not be considered 
a replacement for more RAM. Swap is located on the hard disks which have slower access time than 
Physical memory. 
 
2. 
What is the recommended swap space? 
Generally the recommended swap space is double the RAM size, but the following table shows actual 
amount. 
Apart from the below recommendation a basic rule is applied to create the swap partition. 
*  If the RAM size is less than or equal to 2 GB, then the size of the swap = 2 X RAM size. 
*  If the RAM size is more than 2 GB, then the size of the swap = 2 GB + RAM size. 
Amount of RAM in the System 
Recommended Amount of Swap Space 
4 GB  or  less 
Min. 2 GB  
4 GB  - 16 GB 
Min. 4 GB 
16 GB - 64 GB 
Min. 8 GB 
64 GB - 256 GB 
Min. 16 GB 
256 GB - 512 GB 
Min. 32 GB 
 
3. 
Is it necessary to create the swap at the time of installation? 
Yes, swap space is compulsory to be created at the time of installation. But additional swap space can 
be created and deleted at any point of time, when it is required. Sometimes we need to increase the 
swap space, so we create additional swap space which will be added to the existing swap space to 
increase the size. 
 
4. 
What is swap-in  and swap-out  or  page-in   and   page-out? 
 
swap-in   or  page-out : 
 If we run  or  open any application, it requires some amount of memory to load its features. So, first it 
looks  or  occupy physical memory (RAM). If there is not enough space in RAM, the application's data is 
transferred  from RAM to swap space.  If the pages are moving from RAM to swap space, that is called 
swap-in  or page-out. 
 
swap-out  or  page-in : 
If older  or  previous application is closed, then the space occupied by those applications also cleared. ie., 
some of the space is available in RAM. So, automatically some data which is already occupied in swap 
space is also moved from swap to RAM.  If the pages are moving from swap space to RAM, that is called 
swap-out  or  page-in. 
 
5. 
How paging space is allocated? 
(i)  Paging means data transferred from RAM to swap space. 
ii) If we open  or  run any application, first it will occupy the required space in RAM. If there is not  

SUVEN IT        Linux Administration       -An Admin Choice
 
 
 
 
SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|73 
 
 
enough space in RAM, then some amount of application's data will be transferred from RAM to swap 
space. ie., swap space  
is allocated to that application. This allocation is called paging space  or  page-
out allocation. 
(iii)  paging will takes place in swap by blocks. First it will create the required no. of blocks in swap space. 
(iv)  If RAM space cleared by older or other applications, then swap occupied data is transferred from 
swap to  RAM. This is called page-in. So, that much amount of space is unallocated in swap ie., removed 
the created  
blocks in swap. 
 
6. 
How to create the swap partition? 
# fdisk   -l  
 
 
(to see the available disks in the system) 
# fdisk   /dev/sdb 
  
Command  (m   for   help) :  n  
(to create a new partition) 
  
First  cylinder :  
 
 
(press Enter key) 
  
Last cylinder : +2048M 
  
Command   (m   or   help) :  t 
 
(to change the hex code) 
  
Partition  no. (1-2) : 2  
 
(to change the partition number hex code) 
  
Hex code :  82  
 
 
(82  is the hex code for Linux swap) 
  
Command   (m   for   help) :  w  
(write the changes to the disk) 
# partprobe    or   # partprobe   /dev/sdb (to update the partition table information) 
# mkswap 
 /dev/sdb2 
 
 
(to convert the raw disk to swap file system) 
# swapon    /dev/sdb2 
 
 
(to turn on the swap partition) 
# vim   /etc/fstab  
 
 
(to make the permanent mount of swap partition) 
    /dev/sdb2 
swap swap defaults 
0 
0 
   (save and exit this file) 
# mount   -a 
 
 
           (to mount all the partitions which are having entries in  
/etc/fstab file) 
# df   -hT  
 
 
 
(will not show the swap size) 
# free   -m 
 
 
 
 
(to see the total RAM  and  swap size) 
 
7. 
How to remove the swap partition? 
 # swapon    -s  
 
 
(to see the swap partition names  or  disks) 
 # swapoff    /dev/sdb2  
 
(to turn off the swap space) 
 # vim  /etc/fstab 
 
 
 
(open this file and remove the swap partition entry) 
  
(after removing the swap partition save and exit this file) 
 # fdisk   /dev/sdb 
 
 
 
(to delete the swap partition) 
  
Command   (m  for  help) : d 
 
(d   for  to delete the partition) 
  
Partition no. (1-2) : 2 
  
Command   (m  for  help) : w 
 
(to write the changes into the disk) 
 # partprobe   or   # partprobe   /dev/sdb 
 # free    -m 
 
 
 
 
(to see the RAM as well as swap sizes) 
 
8. 
In how many ways can we create the swap spaces? 
 (i)  By creating a new swap partition on the disk. (separate  swap  partition) 
 (ii)  By creating swap file. 
 
9. 
How to create the swap space using the swap file?

Sometimes it is unable to create a swap partition because may be there is no disk space  or  may be the 
partition limit is already exceeded. So, in these scenarios we have to create only the space file. 
 # dd   if = /dev/zero     of = /root/linuxswap     bs = 1M    count = 2048 (to create 2048MB empty file) 
 # du   -  /root/linuxswap 
 
 
(to see the linuxswap size) 
 # mkswap 
   /root/linuxswap 
 
(to convert the existing file system to swap file system) 
 # swapon 
  /root/linuxswap 
 
(to turn on the swap file) 
 # vim   /etc/fstab 
 
 
 
(to make a permanent mount of swap space) 
   /root/linuxswap 
        swap 
swap      defaults  
0 
0 
     (save and exit this file) 
# mount   -a 
 
           (to mount all the partitions which are having entries in  /etc/fstab file) 
# df   -hT  
 
 
 
(will not show the swap size) 
# free   -m 
 
 
 
 
(to see the total RAM  and  swap size) 
 
10. What is virtual memory? 
 
The combination of Physical memory (RAM)  and  swap space  is  called the virtual memory. 
 
So, Virtual memory  =  Physical memory (RAM)  +  swap space. 
 
 
            Other useful commands : 
# swap    -s 
 
 
(to see how many swap partitions are there and with their names) 
# swapon    -a 
 
 
 
(to turn on all the swap partitions) 
# swapoff    -a 
 
 
 
(to turn off all the swap partitions) 
# cat   /etc/mtab  
 
 
(to see the current and temporary mount points) 
# mountpoint     <directory  or  mount point>  (to check the specified directory is a normal directory   or    
a  mount point)  
# df   -ih  
 
(to check how many inode numbers are available in the mounted partitions) 
 
11. What happens when the /usr is full? 
(i)   Users cannot login to the system. 
(ii)  If already login users not able to execute any command. 
 
12. What happens when memory ie., pagein  space is full? 
(i)  The new applications cannot load due to lack of memory. 
(ii)  So,  users cannot login to the application and cannot access the applications features. 
(iii)  So,  if we increase the swap memory to the required size then the problem will be solved. 
 
13. How to restore the data and upgrade your O/S ? 
(i)   We can restore the data from backup by,  tar,  cpio, dd, net backup  or  other tools. 
(ii)  If it is in mirror, we can sync the data from mirrored disk. 
(iii) We can upgrade the O/S  in two ways. 
a)  Online : 
          The  O/S  is upgraded from previous to present while the system is running.It is risky and takes long time. 
(b)  Offline : 
First take backup of all the system and then remove previous  O/S  and  install the present  O/S  and          
restore the backup from backup disks  or  tapes. So, it is very easy and non-risky job.

Chapter#10 – Software Management 
1. 
What is software? 
 
Software is  a collection of programs to perform some tasks or manage systems, applications, databases  
 
2. 
What is package and package management? 
 
Package is nothing but a software to perform some tasks. Software is the basic of any O/S allowing to 
install and use different utilities.  
 
Package management means installing, updating, querying, repairing and removing packages.  In Linux 
there are two tools to perform package management. 
 
rpm  ----->  redhat  package  manager    and    yum  ----->  yellowdog  updater  modifier. 
 
3. 
What is rpm? 
 
rpm  is a package managing system (collection of tools to manage software packages). rpm is a 
powerful  and most popular open source tool used for software management for installing, uninstalling 
(removing), verifying, querying and updating software packages. It is installed under  /var/lib/rpm  
database directory. It deals with .rpm   files, which contains the actual information about the packages. 
The rpm log messages will be stored in /var/log/yum.log   file. 
 
4. 
What are the draw backs of rpm? 
 
(i) 
rpm cannot resolve the dependency. It means, if we want to install any software, first the 
dependency  
packages should be installed. 
 
(ii) 
There is no configuration file for rpm. 
 
5. 
What are the basic modes of rpm commands? 
 
(i) 
Install   ----->   used to install rpm packages. 
 
(ii) 
Update   ----->   used to updated the packages. 
 
(iii) Troubleshooting   ----->   used to repair the packages. 
 
(iv) Remove   ----->   used to remove or uninstall the packages. 
 
(v) Querying   ----->   used to query (gather information)  on packages. 
 
6. 
How many types of packages are available in Linux? 
 
(i)  x86_64.rpm   ----->   64 bit package and can be install on 64 bit O/S  only. 
 
(ii)         x86.rpm   ----->   32 bit package and can be install on 32 bit   or   64 bit O/S  only. 
 
(iii)     i 386.rpm   ----->   32 bit package and can be install on 32 bit   or   64 bit O/S  only. 
 
(iv)     i 486.rpm   -----> 
 
 
" 
 
" 
 
(v)      i 586.rpm   -----> 
 
 
"

that  
package otherwise it will install as fresh package.

8. 
What is yum and explain the yum? 
 
yum stands for yellow dog updater modified.  yum is a package management application for computers 
running on Linux O/S.yum is a standard method of managing the installation and removal of software. It 
is from RHEL - 5 onwards. Packages are downloaded from collections called repositories, which may be 
online, on a network and or on installation media. yum is a front end tool for rpm. It is used to resolve 
the dependency which cannot be done by rpm. The yum command has access the repository where the 
packages are available and can install, update/upgrade, remove and query the packages automatically. 
 
9. 
What are the important files that are related to yum? 
 
/etc/yum.conf     ----->   is the yum configuration file. 
 
/etc/yum.repos.d    ----->   is the directory which contains the yum repository configuration file. 
 
/etc/yum.repos.d/xxxxx.repo     ------>   is the yum repository configuration file. 
 
/var/lib/yum     ----->   is the directory which contains the yum databases. 
 
/var/log/yum.log     ----->   is the file which stores the yum log messages.

SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|79 
 
 
 
(ii) If our server is registered and configured in RedHat network, then we will get the information about 
that updated kernel s information and then download that kernel updations. 
 
(iii) Every O/S patch is supplied with a document about pre-requisites to apply that patch. 
 
(iv) Check the pre-requisites, space requirements and others. if all are ok,  
 
(v)  Then we take the business approval and make CRQ's  (Change requests). 
 
(vi) Then the project manager will initiate the mail thread ie., sending the mail or messages to various 
teams who are dealing with that server. 
 
(vii) We get the response from different teams which are involving in this process.   
 
   (a)  For example Monitoring  team to ignore alerts from that server if the system hangs  or  rebooted. 
 
   (b)  DBA team if database stopped  or  crashed  or  system failed. 
 
   (c)  Application team if the application effects while patching. 
 
(viii) If the server is in cluster, then move the service group and resources to another systems manually 
called switch over. 
 
(ix)  Inform the Application team to stop the application  and  database team to stop the database. 
 
(x)  If the server is in cluster there is no need of reboot (no down time) else down time needed to reboot. 
 
(xii) If mirror disk is there, split the mirror disk from original disk and boot in single user mode and add 
the patch   by   # rpm    -ivh    <patch name>   command. 
 
(xiii) Then reboot the system and won't  attach the mirror disk to avoid any unexpected situations or 
problems and put that server under test upto  1week  or  10 days depending on the company's policy. 
 
(xiv) After the test period, if there is no problems raised then attach the system in live mode and also 
with  mirror disk to sync the data to update the system. 
 
(xv) Then we inform the Application, Database,  Monitoring  and  other teams who are dealing with that 
server to test application, database, monitoring and others  see the status.  
 
(xvi) Then finally close the issue  or  CRQ. 
 
17. After installation of package or patch if the package or patch is removed then what will  
          happened? 
 
(i)   If  kernel patch is removed, then the system will hang and for others there is no effect. 
 
(ii)  If package is removed then the application that belongs to that removed package  will effect. 
 
18. After applying the patch need to reboot the system or not? 
 
(i)  If the patch is kernel patch  or  clustered patch then only the system reboot is required. 
 
(ii) If the patch is  normal patch then there is no need of the reboot required. 
 
19. If the package is not installing. How to troubleshoot? 
 
(i)  Check the package pre-requisites to install the package. 
 
(ii)  If pre-requisites are not matched with our system, then the package will not be installed i.e., O/S  
 compatibility to install that package. 
 
(iii) If there is no sufficient space in the system, the package will not be installed. 
 
(iv) If the package is not properly downloaded, then the package will not be installed. 
 
20. If the patch is not applied successfully what will you do? 
 
(i)  Check whether the patch is installed properly or not  by  # rpm   -qa    <patch name>    command. 
 
(ii) Check the  /var/log/yum.log   file to verify or see why the patch is not successfully installed.. 
          If any possible to resolved those issues, resolve and remove that patch with

Chapter#11 – Backup and Restore  
1. 
What is backup and what is purpose of the backup? 
 
Copying files from local disk to any removable media is called backup. 
 
In information technology, a backup or the process of backing up is making copies of data which may be 
used to restore the original after an event of data loss. Backup has two distinct purposes. 
 
The primary purpose is to recover data after its loss due to deletion or corruption. Data loss is very 
common in IT industry. The second purpose of backup is to recover data from an earlier time.  
 
Backup is the most important job of a system administrator, as a system admin it is our duty to take 
backup of the data every day. Most companies have gone out of the market because of poor backup 
planning or policy. 
 
2. 
What is recovery or restore? 
 
Copying files from any removable media to local disk is called recovery or restore. Backup will be helped 
in hardware failure or software failure or system crashed. 
 
3. 
What are the backup tools available in the IT industry? 
 
Platform  
Backup Tools 
 
Windows  
ntbackup 
 
Linux 
 
tar, cpio, dd, dump, restore 
 
3rd party  
Veritas netbackup, Amanda and Tivoli 
 
4. 
What is tar and Explain it or how to take a backup using tar? 
 
Archiving means collection of files and directories and to make a single file nothing but compression. tar 
means tape archiving. It is an archive file. By using tar command we can take a backup of files and 
directories. It cannot support file systems backup and also not support for large files more than 80GB. 
tar will not skip any single file including bad blocks also. 
 
Full syntax of tar : 
 
# tar     <options><destination file name with path><source file or directory with path> 
 
The options are, -c   ----->   create 
 
  
 
-v   ----->   verbose 
 
  
 
-f   ----->   file name 
 
  
 
-t   ----->   listing 
 
  
 
-tv  ---->   long listing 
 
  
 
-x  ----->   extract 
 
  
 
-w  ---->interactive 
 
  
 
-C  ----->   specific location   (Capital  C) 
 
  
 
-u  ----->   update means adding new contents to the existing tar file 
 
  
--update    -----> 
 
" 
 
 
" 
 
  
--delete      ----->   deletes the contents from the tar file 
 
  
-p  ---->   preserve the old permissions of the files/directories when extracting the tar file 
 
  
-z  ---->   gzip (gun zip)  compression 
 
  
-j  ---->   bzip2 (bun zip) compression 
 
  
 
-J  ---->   xz  compression    (from RHEL - 7)

(to copy all the files and directories  from /etc  and make a 
single file   and place in the /root/etc.tar  file) 
 
# tar   -tvf 
  /root/etc/tar  
 
(to long listing the contents of the  /root/etc.tar   file) 
 
# tar   -xvf 
  /root/etc.tar  -C     /root1/ 
(to extract and copy the files in /root1/   location) 
 
# tar   -xf  /root/etc.tar  
 
(to list the contents of the tar file) 
 
# tar   -f  /root/etc.tar    --update   or   -u    <file name  or  directory>   (to add the new contents to the 
existing  tar file) 
 
# tar   -f /root/etc.tar 
--delete <file name   or   directory> 
(to delete the file from the tar)

(to add the  /var  contents  into the   /root/etc.tar   file) 
 
# tar   -cvf    mytar.tar  /  --xattrs  (to archive the  contents along with  SELinux  and  ACL  permissions) 
 
# du    -h     /root/etc.tar  
 
(to see the size of the tar compressed file) 
 
5. 
What are the compressing  &  uncompressing tools available for tar and explain them?  
 
Compressing  Tools 
 
 
Uncompressing  Tools 
 
# gzip   (.gz) 
 
 
 
 
# gunzip 
 
# bzip2   (.bz2) 
 
 
 
 
# bunzip2 
 
# xz    (RHEL - 7)  
 
 
 
# unxz 
 
# gzip    <tar file name>  
(to compress the size of the tar file and the output file is  .tar.gz) 
 
# gunzip < .gz  compressed file name>(to uncompress the compressed tar file and the output is  .tar only) 
 
# bzip2     <tar  file  name> 
 
(to compress the size of the tar file and the output is  .tar.bz2)   
 
# bunzip2  < .bz2  compressed file name>(to uncompress the compressed file and the output is  .tar only) 
 
6. 
What is scp, rsyncand how to use it? 
 
scp  means   secure copy. ie.,   ssh + cp  = scp  which is used to copy the files/directories  into remote 
system. scp will copy files/directories  into remote system blindly ie., if the file already exits, it will over 
write that file.So, scp will take more time to copy when compared to  # rsync  tool. 
 
# scp     <file name><user name>@ <IP address of the remote system>:<location to be copied> 
 
# scp   anaconda*    root@192.168.1.1:/root 
(to copy anaconda file into /root of the remote system) 
 
# scp   -r    /etc/ root@192.168.1.1:/raju 
(to copy   /etc/   directory into   /raju of remote system) 
 
#scp    -av    /raju root@192.168.1.1:/root 
(to copy    /raju   into   /root  of the remote system) 
 
# scp   -r    root@192.168.1.1 :/etc   /home (to copy  /etc  of the remote into  /home of the local system) 
 
rsync  is also used to copy files/directories  into remote systems. rsync tool will compare the new files or 
directories and copy only the changed or modified contents of the files into remote system. So, it takes 
less time to copy when compared to   # scp   tool. 
 
# rsync    -av     root@192.168.1.1:/etc    /home (to copy   /etc   directory  changed contents into   /home) 
 
rsync  options are,   -a     ----->     all  (copy the file with all permissions except  SELinux  and  ACL  
permissions)            -aA   ----->  synchronize   ACL  permissions 
 
  
 
-aAx  ---->     synchronize   ACL  and  SELinux  permissions  also. 
 
7. 
What is cpio  and how to take a backup and restore using cpio? 
cpio  means  copy  input  and output. It supports any size of the file system. It skips the bad blocks also. 
Syntax of  cpio with full options : 
# ls  <source file name> |cpio    <options>><destination file name> 
(to take a backup of the source 
  
 
 
 
 
directory and stored the backup into destination directory)

(to take a backup of root directory  and stored in /opt ) 
 # cpio   -iv    <   /opt/root.cpio  
 
(to restore the backup) 
 # ls   /etc  | cpio    -ov    >    /opt/etc.cpio (to take a backup of the  /etc  directory  and  stored in /opt)

(to remove all the contents from   /etc) 
 # cpio    -iv    <   /opt/etc.cpio  
 
(to restore the   /etc   contents  from the cpio backup) 
 
8. 
What is  dd  and how to take a backup and restore using   dd? 
dd   means  disk   to   disk   backup. Using   dd   command we can take a backup of the data from one 
disk to another disk. It copies the data in byte to byte. It can take a backup of the disk including bad 
blocks. 
# dd    if = <disk  1>    of =  <disk  2> 
(to take a backup from  disk 1  and stores in  disk 2) 
# dd   if = /dev/zero    of = /root/raju     bs = 1M    count = 2048  (to create an empty file with 2GB size) 
# dd   if = /dev/sda      of = /root/mbr.bak    bs = 1    count = 512 (to take the backup of  /dev/sda                        
Master  Boot  Record) 
 # dd   if = /root/mbr.bak    of = /dev/sdb(to restore the MBR  from backup to second disk  /dev/sdb) 
 # dd   if = /dev/sda1     of = /dev/sdb1 (to take a backup of the entire  /dev/sda1  disk partition) 
 # dd   if = /dev/sdb1     of = /dev/sda1 (to restore the  /dev/sda1  contents from the above backup)

(to take a backup of the entire /dev/sda  disk into /dev/sdb) 
 # dd   if = /dev/cdrom     of = /root/rhel6.iso 
(to create a ISO image file of the CD/DVD) 
 
9. 
What is dump and how to take a backup and restore using   dump  and  restore? 
 
dump  is a command used to take a backup of file systems only. We cannot take a backup of files and 
directories. We cannot take a  backup of disk to disk backup. It is not recommended to take a backup on 
mounted file systems. So, unmount the file system and then take a backup is recommended. By default 
dump is not available in the system. so, first install the  dump  package and then execute the dump  
# yum  install  dump*  -y  
 
 
(to install the dump package) 
The syntax for dump : 
# dump <options><destination file name><source file name>(to take a backup of the  file systems) 
 The options are,  -0----->full backup 
                                             -(1 - 9)    ----->     incremental  backups 
  
 
 
-u     ----->     update the  /etc/dumpdates   file after successful dump 
  
 
 
-v     ----->     verbose 
  
 
 
-f      ----->make the backup  in a file 
  
 
 
-e     ----->     exclude  inode number while backing up 
# dump  -0uvf  /opt/full.dump /coss  (to take a full backup of the  /coss file system and copied it in  /opt) 
# dump    -1uvf     /opt/full.dump /coss 
             
  (to take a backup modified files from the last full backup nothing     but incremental backup) 
# dump    -2uvf     /opt/full.dump /coss 
   
                          (to take a backup modified files from the last incremental level -1 backup) 
 The syntax for restore :

 # restore     <options><dump backup file> 
(to restore the backup contents if that data is lost) 
 The options are, 
-f     ----->     used to specify the dump or backup file 
  
 
 
-C    ----->     used to compare the dump file with original file 
  
 
 
-v    ----->     verbose 
  
 
 
-e    ----->     exclude the inode number 
  
 
 
-i     ----->     restore in interactive mode 
 The commands in interactive mode are, 
  
 
restore>   ls    ----->    list the files and directories in the backup file     
  
 
restore>  add  ---->    add the files from dump file to current working directory 
  
 
restore>  cd   ----->    change the directory 
  
 
restore>  pwd  --->    displays the present working directory 
  
 
restore>  extract  ---->    extract the files from the dump file 
  
 
restore>  quit  --->    to quit from the interactive mode 
 # restore     -tf     /opt/full.dump 
 
 
(to list the dump file contents) 
 # restore     -rf    /opt/full.dump 
 
 
(to restore the dump file contents) 
 
10. How many types of backup available? 
 
There are mainly three types of backups available. 
 
(i)   Full  backup   (Entire file system backup) 
 
(ii)  Incremental  backup   (backup from the last full backup  or  incremental backup) 
 
(iii)   Cumulative  or  differential  backup   (backup from last full backup  or  cumulative backup) 
 
11. What is the difference between incremental  and  differential  backup? 
Incremental backup : 
 
Taking a backup from the last full backup  or  last incremental backup 
 
Differential  backup : 
 
Taking a backup from last full backup   or  last cumulative  or  differential backup 
 
12. Which file will update when backing up with dump command? 
 
/etc/dumpdates     file will be updated when backing up with dump command. 
 
13. What are the dump devices? 
 
(i) Tape drives 
 
(ii) Disks  (local disks) 
 
(iii) Luns  (network disks) 
 
14. What is snap shot? 
 
(i) The point - in - time copy of the file system is called the snap shot. 
 
(ii) It provides online backup solution of the file system. 
 
(iii)  We can take a backup while the file system is mounted  and it is in multi-user mode. 
 
(iv)  It occupied only as much disk space as the file system  ie., being captured. 
 
(v)We can also create backup, delete, query temporary (read-only)snap shots using   fssnap   command.

15. What are the differences between   tar   and   cpio   commands? 
 
(i)  By   tar we can take backup upto 80GB size of file systems ,  but using cpio  there is no limit. 
 
(ii) In   tar  the backup is in archive format  ie., in compressed state,  but in cpio  there is no compression. 
 
(iii)  In both the types only the whole backup is possible. 
 
16. How to take a backup on production servers? 
 
(i)  Normally in backup environment we have 3 servers. 
 
  (a)  Master server  (production servers  --  1  or  2  no's). 
 
  (b)  Media server   (backup server --  1  or  2  no's). 
 
  (c)  Client server   (Normal system) 
 
(ii) Backups can be taken in types. 
 
  (a)  Application Backup  (Normally application users will take these types of backups) 
 
   (b)  File system Backup  (O/S  backup,  System Administrators will take these types of backups) 
 
  (c)  Database Backup  (DBA  users will take these types of backups) 
 
(iii) Normally backup is automated through some backup tools like Veritas Net backup, IBM Tivoli and 
Autosys. 
 
(iv) Using cron tool also we can take backup. But cron will not inform the failed backup. The other tools 
will inform by sending messages like why the backup is failed, when and where it is failed, ..etc.,  
 
(v) On production servers the backup will follow the procedure, 
 
  (a)  Master server deport from production. 
 
  (b)  Import the master server on Media server. 
 
  (c)  Then Master server will join with the Media server. 
 
 (d)  Sync the data with the Master server. 
 
 (e)  Take a backup from Master server  and store the copy on Media server. 
 
 (f)  Split the Master server from Media server. 
 
 (g)  Deport the Master server from Media server. 
 
 (h)  Import the Master server on production. 
 
 (i)   Join the Master server with production. 
 
17. What is your company's backup policy? 
 
(i) By   dump   command we can take backups on disks, tapes and takes full, incremental  and 
differential  or   cumulative backups. 
 
(ii)  level  0 --  Full  backup       
(monthly once) 
 
 level  3  --  Performed on every Monday   (Incremental  from last full or last incremental backup)  
 
 level  4  --  Performed on every Tuesday 
 
   (Incremental  from last level  3  backup) 
 
 level  5  --  Performed on every Wednesday 
   (Incremental  from last level  4  backup) 
 
 level  6  --  Performed on every Thursday 
   (Incremental  from last level  5  backup) 
 
 level  7  --  Performed on every Friday  
   (Incremental  from last level  6  backup) 
 
 level  8  --  Performed on every Saturday 
 
   (Incremental  from last level  7  backup) 
 
 level  2  --  Performed on every Sunday    (differential   or  cumulative  backup  from last full backup,  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        ie., from  Monday  to Saturday) 
18. What is the information is stored in  /etc/dumpdates  file? 
 
/etc/dumpdates file records the backup information if   -u   option is used with  dump  command to take 
a backup. In this file each line tells the file system that was backed up, last level  of backup, the date, 
day and time of the backup.

Chapter#12 – Managing Installed Services 
 
1. 
What is service  or  deamon? 
 
Service  or  deamon is program that stats at background and continuously run in the background. The 
service or deamon is ready for input or monitor the changes in our computer and respond to them. For 
example the Apache server has a deamon called   httpd   that listens on port no. 80 on our computer and 
when it receives a request for a page it sends the appropriate data back to the client machine. 
 
Example :  apache, samba,  NFS, FTP, ....etc., 
 
2. 
What are the commands used to control the services? 
 
service : 
 
This controls the starting and stopping the services during session and these settings will not be saved. 
We can start the Apache service in this way, but it will not start on booting time. Using this method the 
service will continue to run on upto next boot but from next boot the service will not be started 
automatically. 
 
 
chkconfig : 
 
This controls which services are set to start at boot time. These settings will be saved and applied at next 
boot. Changing these settings will not start the service immediately and it will just flag them to be 
started from the next boot. 
 
3. 
What are the differences between  RHEL -6  and  RHEL-7 services?  
RHEL -6 
RHEL -7 
(a)  The parent process  ie., the starting process is   
initd   and it's process id (pid) is  1. 
(a)  The parent process  ie., the starting process is   
systemd    and it's process id (pid) is  1. 
(b)  There two commands for starting the services .  
They are called   # service   and   # chkconfig 
(b)  Here only one command is used to start the  
service. That is   # systemctl 
(c)  # service command is used to start  or  stop the  
services  temporarily   and    # chkconfig   is used  
to start  or  stop the services at next booting time.  
(c)  # systemctl   is the command to start or stop  
the services  temporarily   or   next booting  
time. 
(d)  /etc/init.d   is the location for all the services. 
(d)  /usr/lib/systemd/system   is the location for  
all the services. 
(e)  # service    <service name> 
<start/stop/restart/reload/status > 
(e)  # systemctl   <start/stop/restart/reload/ 
status ><service name> 
 
4. 
What are the differences between   initd   and   systemd   deamons? 
Initd 
systemd 
(a)  It is the starting process  in RHEL - 4, 5  and  6. 
(a)  It is starting process  in  RHEL - 7. 
(b)  It's process  id (pid)   is   1.  
(b)  It's process  id (pid)   is   1.

(c)  It will take more time to the system  and  
       services. 
(c)  It will take less time to start the system and  
       services when compared to  RHEL - 6. 
(d)  It will start the services  one by one. 
(d)  It will start the services parallel not one by 
one. 
(e)  All the linux services are ends with letter  d. 
       Example :  sshd, httpd, crond, ...etc., 
(e)  All the linux services are ends with letter    
        d.service 
       Example :  sshd.service, httpd.service,  ...etc., 
 
 
5. 
How to make the computer to boot  fasterly? 
 
Many services are required to run all the time however many can be turned off  for both security reasons 
as running unnecessary services opens more doors into our computer but also for performance reasons. 
It may take much difference but our computer should boot slightly faster with less services it has to start 
on boot. So, one of the technique to start the system fast and maintain to improve security is turn off 
the unneeded services.  
 
6. 
What are masking  and  unmasking the services? 
 
Masking  the  services  means  hiding the services  and  unmasking  the  services means unhiding  the 
services. The masking and unmasking are the new commands in  RHEL - 7. If any two similar services (for 
example  ntp  and  chrony)  are there in a system, we cannot start the two services at a time. In these 
scenarios  we go for mask and  unmask  commands. 
 
# systemctl   mask  sshd  
 
                         (to hide the sshd service temporarily ie., we cannot start the services when we mask any service) 
 
# systemctl   unmask   sshd 
 
(to unhide the sshd service ie., we can start the service again) 
 
*  we can also use RHEL - 6 commands like as,   
          # service    and   # chkconfig , but these two commands will      
          internally call the   # systemctl   commands  only. So, in RHEL - 7  # systemctl   command is the 
recommended one. 
 
# systemctl     --failed     --type=service 
 
(to check all the failed services) 
 
# systemctl     --failed     --type=process  
(to check all the failed processes) 
 
*  In RHEL - 6 service names ends  with  'd' only, but in RHEL - 7 the service names ends with  d.service 
and these are all text files only. So, in RHEL - 7 we can open and see all the system services and read 
their contents. 
 
# ps 
 
(to see the active process in the system) 
 
# top 
(It will show a dynamic real-time view of a running system. ie.,  a summary of processes   or   
  
 
 
 
 
 
      threads currently managed by the Linux kernel) 
 
# kill 
 
(It sends the specified signal to the specified process  or  process group) 
 
# pkill 
(It will send the specified signal to each process instead of listing them on standard output) 
 
# pstree  
                           (to show all the running processes as a tree structure. The tree is rooted either  pid   or  init) 
 
# nice  
(to run a program with modified scheduling priority  ie.,  it  runs the process with an   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
            adjustable niceness) 
 
# renice  
(to alter the scheduling priority of one   or  more running processes) 
 
# pgrep  
(to list the process  id's  which matches with the pgrep  argument)

Chapter#13 – Managing Process  
1. 
What is process  and explain it? 
 
A process is a set of instructions which executes in the memory. It is created in the memory when a 
program  or  command is executed. Every process is identified by a unique no. ie.,  PID (Process  ID). 
Several processes are started at boot time and which are running at background called deamons. The 
Linux kernel is used to communicate with the processes by  their process ID's (PID's). Deamon is a 
process running in the background. These are handled by the system and process are handled by the 
users.  
The first process in RHEL - 6 is  initd  and it starts at boot time. It's process  ID  is  1 where as in RHEL - 7 
the first process  is  systemd  and it starts at boot time. To manage or to see the processes there are two 
commands. 
(i)   # ps    and   (ii)  # top    
# ps : 
It is just a snap shot of the current status of the processes. It gives only one terminal information not all 
the terminals information. 
# top : 
Using   top   command we can monitor the processes continuously. By default every  3  seconds it will 
refresh the data. 
 
2. 
How many process are run generally on Linux and explain them? 
 
There are generally three types of processes that run on Linux. They are, 
 
(i)   Interactive Processes 
 
(ii)  System Process   or  deamon 
 
(iii) Automatic   or  batch. 
 
Interactive Processes : 
 
Interactive processes are those processes that are invoked by a user and can interact with the user.  For 
example   # vi   or   # vim  are the interactive processes. Interactive processes may be run in foreground  
or   background. The foreground process is the process that we are currently interacting with and is 
using the terminal as its stdin  (standard  input)  and  stdout  (standard output). The background process 
is not interacting with the user and can be in one of two states,  ie.,  paused   or   running. 
 
System Processes   or  deamons : 
 
Deamon is refer to processes that are running on the computer and provides services but do not interact 
with the console. Most server software is implemented as a deamon. For example Apache, samba, sshd 
are the deamons. Any process can become a deamon as long as it is run in the background and does not 
interact with the user. 
 
Automatic processes : 
 
Automatic processes are not connected to a terminal and these are queued into a spooler area where 
they wait to be executed on a  FIFO (First  In - First Out)  basis. Such tasks can be executed using one of 
two criteria. At certain date and time : done using the   "at"   command.When the total system load is 
low enough to accept extra jobs : done using the  " cron "  command. By default tasks are put in a queue 
where they wait to be executed until the system load is lower than  0.8 and cron job processing is also 
used for optimizing system performance.

3. 
What is parent process? 
 
The process which starts   or   creates another process is called the parent process. Every process will be 
having a  parent process except  initd process. The initd process is the parent process to all the 
remaining processes in  Linux system because it is the first process which gets started by the kernel at 
the time of booting and it's  PID is  1. Only after  initd process gets started, the remaining processes are 
called by it, and hence it is responsible for all the remaining processes in the system. The parent process 
is identified by  PPID  (parent process  ID). 
 
4. 
What is child process? 
A process which started  or  created by the parent process is called  child  process and it is identified by  
PID. 
 
 
Useful    # ps   commands : 
 
# ps    -a  
 
 
(it displays all the terminals processes information) 
 
# ps    -au  
 
 
(it displays all the terminals processes information with user names) 
 
# ps    -aux 
 
(it displays all the terminals processes information including background  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
processes with user names) 
 
*   ?  (question mark)  if it is appeared at tty column,  it indicates that is a background process. 
 
# ps    -ef  
 
(it displays the total processes information  with parent process  ID (PPID)) 
 
# ps    -P   <process  id>  
(it displays the process name if we know the process  ID (pid))   
 
# pidof<process name>  
(to see the process  ID of the specified process) 
 
# pidof    initd 
 
 
(to see the process  ID of the  initd  process) 
 
# pstree  
 
 
(to display the parent  and child processes structure  in tree format) 
 
# ps   -u    <user name>  
(to display all the processes of the specified user) 
 
# ps   -u    raju 
 
 
(to display all the processes of the user  raju) 
 
# ps   -G    <group name>  
(to display all the processes that are running by a particular group) 
 
# ps   -o  pid,  comm,  %mem,  %cpu 
(to display process  id,  command,  %memory  and   %cpu   
utilization nothing but filtering the output) 
 
# ps   -Ao  pid,  comm,  %mem,  %cpu(to display the same information as above but including some more 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
             information) 
 
# ps   -o  pid,  comm,  %mem,  %cpu |sort  -k  <no.>  -r |head   -n  10  (to display which process is 
utilizingmore memory  or  cpu   in reverse order  where  -k  means  field,  <no.>  means  field  no.  and  -r  
reverse order) 
 
# ps   -o  pid,  comm,  %mem,  %cpu |sort  -k  3  -r |head   -n  10 (to display the process which occupies 
more  memory  and  cpu  utilization in reverse order) 
 
# ps   -aux |grep   firefox  
 
 
    (to check  whether the firefox is  running   or  not) 
 
# pgrep    -U    <user name> 
 
    (to display all the process  ID's  only for that user) 
 
*   To communicate with the processes    
           # kill   and   # pkill   commands are used. 
 
# kill     ----->    It will kill the processes  using   PID's. 
 
# pkill  ----->     It will kill the processes  using  process names. 
 
*   We can also give some signals while using the above commands and we get the signals information 
by 
 
# kill   -l   command. This command will list all the signals  with  no's  and there are 64 signals to pass.

5. 
What is signal in Process management? 
 
Signals are a way of sending simple messages  to processes. Most of these messages are already defined 
and however signals can only be processed when the process is in user mode. Every signal has a unique 
signal name. Each signal name is a macro which stands for a positive integer. Signals can be generated 
by the process itself  or  they can be sent from one process to another. A variety of signals can be 
generated   or delivered  and they have many uses for programmers. 
 
6. 
What are the important signals in process management? 
 
1. SIGHUP     ----->     to reload  (read the configuration and load) 
 
2. SIGINT     ----->     to interrupt from the keyboard  (nothing but  Ctrl + c) 
 
3. SIGQUIT   ----->     to quit the process from keyboard  (nothing but  Ctrl + l) 
 
9. SIGKILL     ----->     to kill the process forcefully  (nothing but unblockable) 
 
15. 
SIGTERM ----->     wait for completing the process and then terminate  (terminate  gracefully) 
 
18. 
SIGCONT ----->    to continue  or resume the process  if it is stopped 
 
19. 
SIGSTOP ----->     to terminate the process  (If it is not stopped the process we cannot continue 
or resume that process  by  Ctrl + c   or   Ctrl + z) 
 
20. 
SIGHTSTP ---->     to stop the process  (nothing but  Ctrl + z) 
 
*   But the most commonly used  signals are    1,    9,    15   and    20. 
 
*   The default signal is  15 (gracefully)  when we not specified any signal. 
 
# kill    - <signal><process  ID> 
 
 
(to kill the specified process using kill signal) 
 
# kill   -9    1291  
 
 
 
(to kill the process which has the PID as  1291) 
 
*   If we not specified the signal no.  then the default signal   15  will effect. 
 
# kill    1291 
 
 
 
 
(to kill the process  1291 with default signal) 
 
# pkill    -u    <user name> 
 
 
 
(to kill all the processes of the specified user) 
 
# pkill    -u   raju  
 
 
 
(to kill all the processes of the user  raju) 
 
# pkill    -9   firefox 
 
 
 
 
(to kill the firefox process) 
 
7. 
How many  process  states  are there? 
 
There are six process states and they are, 
 
(i)   Running process   (the process which is in running state  and  is indicated by  " r " ). 
 
(ii)  Sleeping process   (the process which is in sleeping state  and  is indicated by  " s " ) 
 
(iii) Waiting process   (the process which is in waiting state  and  is indicated by  " w " ). 
 
(iv) Stopping process   (the process which is in stopping state  and  is indicated by  " T " ). 
 
(v) Orphan process   (the process which is running without  parent process  and  is indicated by  " o " ). 
 
(vi) Zombie process   (the process which is running without child process  and is indicated by  " Z " ). 
 
8. 
What is  Orphan process? 
 
The processes which are running without parent processes are called Orphan processes. Sometimes 
parent process closed without knowing the child processes. But the child processes are running at that 
time. These child processes are called  Orphan processes. 
 
9. 
What is Zombie process? 
 
When we start parent process, it will start some child processes. After some time the child processes will 
died because of not knowing the parent processes. These parent processes  (which are running  without  
child processes)  are called  Zambie processes. These are also called as  defaunct  processes.

10. How to set the priority for a process? 
 
Processes priority means  managing processor time. The processor  or  CPU will perform multiple tasks 
at the same time. Sometimes we can have enough room to take on multiple projects and sometimes we 
can only focus on one thing at a time. Other times something important pops up and we want to devote 
all of our energy into solving that problem while putting less important tasks on the back burner. 
 
In Linux we can set guidelines for the CPU to follow when it is looking at all the tasks it has to do. These 
guidelines are called   niceness   or   nice value. The Linux niceness scale goes from  -20  to  19. The lower 
the number the more priority that task gets. If the niceness value is higher number like  19 the task will 
be set to the lowest priority and the CPU will process it whenever it gets a chance. The default nice value 
is  0 (zero).By using this scale we can allocate our CPU resources more appropriately. Lower priority 
programs that are not important can be set to a higher nice value, while the higher priority programs 
like deamons and services can be set to receive more of the CPU's  focus. We can even give a specific 
user a lower nice value for all his/her processes so we can limit their ability to slow down the computer's 
core services. There are two options to reduce/increase  the value of a process. We can either do it using 
the  nice   or renice  commands. 
Examples : 
# nice  -n  <nice value range  from  -20 to 19><command>(to set a priority to a process before starting it)  
# nice   -n   5   cat  >  raju  
 
 
        (to set the medium priority to cat command) 
# ps   -elf  
 
 
 
 
 
        (to check the nice value for that command) 
 *   To reschedule the nice value of existing process, first check the PID of that process by   
# ps   -elf   command and then change the niceness of that command by  
# renice  <nice value  (-20 to 19)>< PID >    command. 
# renice   10   1560 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(to reschedule the PID  1560) 
 
11. What is   top  command and what it shows? 
 
top  is a command to see the processes states and statuses information continuously until we quit by 
pressing    " q ". By default top command will refresh the data for every  3  seconds.  
 
When we need to see the running processes on our Linux in real time, the  top  command will be very 
useful. Besides the running processes the   top  command also displays other information like free 
memory both physical and swap. 
 
The first line shows the current time,  "up  1 day"  shows how long the system has been up for,  "3 user"  
how many users login,  "load average :  0.01,   0.00,   0.23"  the load average of the system   1,  5  and  
15  minutes. 
 
The second line shows the no of processes and their current states. 
 
The third line shows  CPU utilization details like  % of the users processes,  % of the system processes,  % 
of available CPU  and   % of CPU waiting time for  I/O (input  and  output). 
 
The fourth   and  fifth  lines shows  the total physical memory in the system,  used physical memory,  free 
physical memory,  buffered physical memory,  the total  swap memory in the system,  used swap 
memory,  free swap memory   and   cached swap memory, ... etc., 
 
From sixth line onwards the fields are as follows. 
PID 
 
Process ID 
USER 
 
Owner of the process  ie.,  which user executed that process 
PR 
 
Dynamic  Priority 
NI 
 
Nice value, also known as base value 
VIRT

12. How to solve the issue if the CPU utilization is 99% ? 
 
(i)  First check which process  and who executed that process  is consuming more CPU utilization  or  
memory  utilization by executing   # top   command.  
 
(ii) Then inform to those users who executed that process though mail,  message  or raising the ticket. 
 
(iii)  If those users are not available or not responding to our mail then we have to change the priority of 
that process using   # renice    command. 
 
(iv) Before changing  the process priority level , we have to get or take approval from our team lead  or 
project  manager. 
 
13. How to check the   wwn  no. of lun? 
 
(i)  First install   sysutils  package to execute the commands to know the   wwn  number by  executing 
command, 
 
# yum  install  sysutils   -y 
 
(ii) # systool   -c   fs_host    -v |grep   "port-name" 
 
(to check the   wwn   number)

(to remove the page caches) 
 
# sysnc ;    echo 3   >  /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches  
(to remove all types of caches like  dent  cache,  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
page caches   and   others) 
 
15. What is  "sosreport"  and how to generate it? 
 
Sosreport is a command in linux (RHEL / CentOS) which collects system configuration and diagnostic 
information of your linux box like running kernel version, loaded modules, and system and service 
configuration  
files. This command also runs external programs to collect further information, and 
stores this output in the  resulting archive. 
 
Sosreport is required when you have open a case with redhat for technical support. Redhat support 
Engineers  
will require sosreport of your server for troubleshooting purpose. 
 
To run sosreport , sos package should be installed. Sos package is part of default installation in most of 
linux. If  for any reason this package is no installed , then use below yum command to install sos 
package : 
 
# yum install sos  -y 
 
Generate the  sosreport : 
 
Open the terminal  and type sosreport command : 
 
# sosreport 
 
This command will normally complete within a few minutes. Depending on local configuration and the 
options  specified in some cases the command may take longer to finish. Once completed, sosreport 
will generate a  compressed a file under /tmp folder. Different versions use different compression 
schemes (gz, bz2, or xz). The  
file should be provided to Redhat support representative (normally as 
an attachment to an open case). 
 
Note:  sosreport requires root permissions to run. 
 
Different Options used in sosreport command : 
 
The sosreport command has a modular structure and allows the user to enable and disable modules 
and specify  
module options via the command line. To list available modules (plug-ins) use the 
following command: 
 
# sosreport -l 
 
To turn off a module include it in a comma-separated list of modules passed to the -n/–skip-
plugins option. For instance to disable both the kvmand amd modules: 
 
# sosreport -n kvm,amd 
 
Individual modules may provide additional options that may be specified via the -k option. For example 
on Red  Hat Enterprise Linux 5 installations the sos rpm module collects "rpm -Va" output by default. 
As this may be time-consuming the behaviour may be disabled via: 
 
# sosreport -k rpm.rpmva=off 
 
16. What is the command to see the complete information on virtual memory? 
 
# vmstat    is the command to the complete information on virtual memory like  no of processes,  
memory   
usage,  paging memory,  block  I/O  (input /output),  traps,  disk   and   CPU activity. 
 
# vmstat   2   10  
 
(It will give the report for every   2  seconds  upto  10  times) 
 
   The fields  are, r  
-----> 
how many waiting processes 
 
  
 
b 
-----> 
how many processes are busy 
 
  
 
swapd -----> 
how much virtual memory used

# iostat  
 
 
(to see the Input and Output statistics in the Linux system) 
 
* This command is used to monitoring the system  input, output statistics and processes transfer  rate. 
 
* It is also used to monitor how many kilo bytes  read per second  and how many kilo bytes read and 
write,  shows  CPU load average statistics since the last reboot in first line and  most current data is 
shown in the second line.  
 
18. How many  CPUs   are there in the system? 
# cat   /proc/cpuinfo    command will show  no. of  CPUs,  no. of cores, no. of threads,  no. of sockets  
and the     CPU architecture, ...etc.,  information. 
# nproc    command will give the no. of  CPUs present in the system. 
# lscpu    command will give the information the architecture of the CPU (x86_64  or  x86_32),  no. of 
cores,  no.   of  threads,  no. of sockets,  cache memory sizes (L 1,  L 2,  L 3, ...etc) ,  CPU speed  and the 
vendor of the CPU. 
 
19. How to send the processor into offline? 
 
# ls   -l    /sys/devices/system/cpu    is the command to see the no. of processors present in the system. 
 
# echo   0  >   /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu4/online   is the command to send the  CPU4  into offline. 
 
# grep   "processor"   /proc/cpuinfo   or    # cat  /sys/devices/system/cpu/offline     
                              are the command to see the  processor status whether offline.

# ls   -l    /sys/devices/system/cpu    is the command to see the no. of processors present in the system. 
 
# echo   1  >   /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu4/online   is the command to send the  CPU4  into offline. 
 
# grep   "processor"   /proc/cpuinfo   or    
          # cat  /sys/devices/system/cpu/online are the command to see the  processor status whether online. 
 
21. How to clear  /var  and  /tmp directories? 
 
(i)  Copy all the entries of those directories into a separate locations. 
 
(ii) Redirect the null values in  /var   and   /tmp  directories by executing the below commands.

22. How to troubleshoot if  df  -k  is giving error? 
 
(I) First check which file system is giving error by  # df   -k   command then see whether any files are  
opened or not.If opened then close those files by informing those teams which are using that file system. 
 
(ii) Unmount that file system by taking approval from higher authorities and run fsck on that file system, 
then normally it will be solved if we run fsck  command. 
 
(iii) If not solved even though we run fsck  then delete  or  remove that file system,  recreate that file 
system, mount that file system and restore the data from recent backup.  
 
23. What are the differences between  a  deamon   and  a process? 
 
(i)  Deamon is a service to provide some services to the users, where as a process is to do some 
particular tasks. 
 
(ii)  We can enable  or  disable the deamon,  but we cannot disable  or  enable the process. 
 
(iii)  We can do start  or  stop the deamon,  but  we cannot start  or  stop the process.  We only kill the 
process. 
 
(iv)  We can enable or disable to start the deamons at boot time as per our requirement, ie.,  on demand 
is possible,  but it is not possible if is a process. 
 
(v)  Deamon is a background process where as process is a foreground process. 
 
24. What is command to check the load average? 
 
# uptime   is the command to check the system  load,  present time,  from how many hours the system is 
running and load average. 
 
*   The load average shows three fields.  The 1st field shows the load average from  1 minute,  2nd field  
shows the load average from   5 minutes   and   3rd field  shows  the load average from   15 minutes. 
 
25. How to assign  or  shift the process to the particular CPU? 
 
(i)  First install  util-linux   package by  # yum  install  util-linux   -y   command. 
 
(ii)  Check the specified process is assigned to which processor ie., which CPU  by  # taskset    -p    <pid> 
 
 command. 
 
(iii) Then shift the process to another available CPU by   # taskset    -cp    <cpu -list><pid>   command. 
 
Examples: 
 
# taskset    -p   2125 
 
 
(to check which processor is assigned to that process  ID) 
 
# taskset    -cp    0, 4   2125 
 
 
(to shift the process to the CPUs  0 and  4) 
 
# taskset     0   firefox 
 
 
(to assign the firefox process to the  CPU  0) 
 
26. How to limit the CPU  usage of a linux process? 
(a)  First install the  cpulimit   package by   # yum  install  cpulimit   -y    command. 
 *   This package is not available in normal Linux packages and it is available in EPEL (Extra Packages 
for  Enterprise Linux). So,  first we have to enable the EPEL repository in our system by following steps. 
(i)   # yum  install  epel-release  -y 
 
 
(to install the epel-release package in  RHEL - 7) 
(ii)  # rpm  -Uvh   http://mirrors.kernel.org/fedora-epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm    
   (to install the EPEL  package in  RHEL - 6) 
(ii)  # rpm  -Uvh   http://mirrors.kernel.org/fedora-epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm    (to install 
the EPEL  package in  RHEL - 5) 
(iii) # rpm  --import  /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-5 
(to import the gpg key if it ask when  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
executing the above command in  RHEL - 5)

(iv) # rpm  --import  /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-6 
(to import the gpg key if it ask when  
  
 
 
 
 
 
            executing the above command in  RHEL - 6) 
(v) # rpm  --import  /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7 
(to import the gpg key if it ask when  
  
 
 
 
 
 
            executing the above command in  RHEL - 7) 
(vi) # yum repolist 
 
 
(to check EPEL repolist) 
(b)  # cpulimit   -p    <PID>    -l   10(to see the CPU  usage of that process  and limit the CPU usage to 10%)  
 (c)# cpulimit   -e   /usr/local/bin/myprog  -l   20(to limit the CPU usage of this command to  20%) 
 
27. How to capture the network traffic? 
# tcpdump   is the command to capture and  analyze the network traffic. By using this command we can 
also troubleshoot the network problems. 
 Examples : 
 # tcpdump 
 
 
 
 
(to capture and analyze the network traffic) 
 # tcpdump    -i     eth0 (to capture the network traffic from  eth0  continuously  and  Ctrl + c to exit) 
 # tcpdump    -c    30    -i    eth0     (to capture the network traffic from  eth0  upto  30 packets  only) 
 # tcpdump    -w   /root/tcp.pcap    -i    eth0 to capture the network traffic from  eth0 and write that in  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
/root/tcp.pcap   file) 
 # tcpdump    -t t t    -r    /root/tcp.pcap   
       (to read the contents of the above captured file) 
 # tcpdump    -i    eth0    port  22 
        (to capture the network traffic from  eth0 of ssh  traffic) 
 # tcpdump    -i    eth0    dst    172.25.0.11  and   port  22    
                   (to capture the network traffic  from  172.25.0.11  system  of  ssh  traffic) 
 
28. What is SAR utility  and  how to use it? 
 
SAR   stands for System  Activity  Report. Using  SAR we can check the information of  CPU usage,  
memory,  swap,  I/O,  disk  I/O,  networking  and  paging. We can get the information of the present 
status  and  post  status (history  using the data)  upto  last 7 days because  HISTORY=7   is there in the 
configuration file. The log  
messages are stored in  /var/log/sa/sa1,  /var/log/sa/sa2,  
/var/log/sa/sa3, ....etc., (where  1, 2, 3, ....etc., are  
dates). The  SAR  configuration  is  stored in   
/etc/sysconfig/sysstat   file. In this file the  HISTORY=7  default   option will  
be there.  So, we can 
change the default  7 days to our required value.   
 
Before using the  SAR  utility first we should install the  SAR utility package  by  # yum  install  sysstat*   -
y command. 
Examples : 
# sar    2    10 
 
 
  (It  will give the system report for every 2 seconds  upto  10 times) 
# sar   -p   2   10  
         (to see the CPU utilization for every 2 seconds  upto  10 times) 
# sar   -p  ALL   -f   /var/log/sa/sa25       (to check the CPU utilization on 25th day of the current month) 
# sar   -p  ALL   -f   /var/log/sa/sa10    -s   07:00:00   -e   15:00:00       (to check the CPU utilization on 10th 
day of the current month from  7:00  to  15:00 hrs.  where   -s  means  start time   -e  end time) 
# sar   -r   2   10  
 
  (to see the memory utilization for every 2 seconds  upto  10 times) 
# sar   -r   -f   /var/log/sa/sa14 
(to check the memory utilization on 14th day of the current month) 
# sar   -r   -f   /var/log/sa/sa10    -s   07:00:00   -e   15:00:00       (to check the memory utilization on 10th 
day of the current month from  7:00  to  15:00 hrs.  where   -s  means  start time   -e  end time) 
# sar   -S   2   10  
 
       (to see the swap utilization for every 2 seconds  upto  10 times) 
# sar   -S   -f   /var/log/sa/sa25       (to check the swap utilization on 25th day of the current month)

Chapter#14 – FTP(File Transfer Protocal) 
1 
What is FTP? 
 
FTP  stands  for  File  Transfer  Protocol used to transfer files from one host to another host over a  TCP-
based network.  
 
2. 
How  ftp works? 
 
FTP is built on client-server architecture and utilizes separate control and data connection between the 
client  and  server. FTP users may authenticate themselves using  a  clear-text  sign-in  protocol but can 
connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. 
 
Usually, the  FTP server, which stores files to be transferred, uses two ports for the transferring purpose.  
One port for commands  and  another port for sending and receiving data. Requesting from client 
computers are received at the port 21 of server. ie., it is exclusively reserved for sending commands, 
therefore it is called the Command Port.  Once an incoming request is received, the data requested or 
uploaded by the client computer is transferred through a separate port 22 and referred as Data Port. At 
this point, depending on the Active  or  Passive mode of the FTP connection,  the port number used for 
the Data Transfer Varies. 
 
3. 
What is Active FTP? 
 
In Active FTP connection, the connection is initiated by the Client, and the data connection is initiated by 
the Server. And as the server actively establishes the data connection with the client, hence it is called 
the Active FTP. Here the client opens up a port higher than 1024  and  it connects to the server through 
port 21. Then the server opens its port 20 to establish a data connection. 
 
4. 
What is Passive FTP? 
 
In Passive FTP  connection, both command  and  data connections are established by the client.  In this 
the server acts as entirely passive, that's why it is called the Passive FTP. Here the server listens for 
incoming requested connections from client through port 21 and the client also initiates the data 
connection  at port 20. 
 
5. 
What is the main difference between  the Active FTP  and  Passive FTP? 
 
The main difference between the Active FTP  and the Passive FTP is based on who initiates the data 
connection between the server and the client. If the data connection is initiated by the server,  that is 
called Active FTP  and if the data connection is initiated by the client, that is called Passive FTP. 
 
6. 
What is the profile for FTP server? 
 
(i) It is used for uploading and downloading the files  and  directories cannot be downloaded. 
 
(ii) The FTP server packageis  vsftpd. 
 
(iii)The FTP client packages are  ftp   and   lftp. 
 
(iv) The FTP server deamon  is  vsftpd   (Very  Secure FTP deamon) 
 
(v) The FTP scripting file is  /etc/initd/vsftpd 
 
(vi) Port numbers   20  for data connection  and  21  for  FTP  command connection. 
(viii) 
The document root for FTP is  /var/ftp

(viii) The FTP home directory is  /var/ftp 
 
(ix) The FTP configuration files  are, 
 
 (a)  /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf 
 
 (b)  /etc/vsftpd/user_list 
 
 (c)  /etc/vsftpd/ftpuser 
 
 (d)  /etc/pam.d/vsftpd 
 
7. 
How to configure the FTP server? 
 
(i) Install the FTP package  by  # yum  install  vsftpd*   -y   command. 
 
(ii) Goto  FTP document root directory and create some files by  # cd   /var/ftp/pub 
 
# touch  f(1..10} 
 
(iii) Restart the FTP service or deamon  by  # service  vsftpd restart   command in RHEL - 6. 
 
# systemctl  restart  vsftpd   command in RHEL - 7. 
 
(iv) Make the FTP service  or deamon  enable even after reboot the server  by 
 
# chkconfig   vsftpd  on   command in  RHEL - 6   and   # systemctl enable vsftpd   command in  RHEL - 7. 
 
(v) Add the FTP service to the  IP tables (RHEL - 6)  and   Firewalld  (RHEL - 7). 
 
 
RHEL - 6 : 
 
 
 
# iptables    -A   INPUT   -m   state   --state   NEW   -m  tcp   -p   tcp   --deport   21  -j    ACCEPT 
 
# iptables    -A   OUTPUT   -m   state   --state   NEW   -m  tcp   -p   tcp   --deport   21  -j    ACCEPT 
 
# iptables    -A   INPUT   -m   state   --state   NEW   -m  tcp   -p   tcp   --deport   20  -j    ACCEPT 
 
# iptables    -A   OUTPUT   -m   state   --state   NEW   -m  tcp   -p   tcp   --deport   20  -j    ACCEPT 
 
 
RHEL - 7 : 
 
# firewall-cmd     --permanent    -add-service=ftp   command  in RHEL - 7. 
 
# firewall-cmd     --complete-reload    command in  RHEL - 7.

*   ananymous_enable=yes 
     (by default) 
 
It means anybody can login to the FTP server without any username  and  password.  
 
If  ananymous_enable=no,  then we must provide the username  and  passwords when it prompts. 
 
(iii) Restart the ftp deamon  by   # service   vsftpd   restart    command in  RHEL - 6   or 
 
# systemctl   restart  vsftpd    command  in  RHEL - 7. 
 
(iv) Assign the  FTP user password  by   # passwd   ftp 
(type  and  retype  the  ftp  user password) 
 
(v)  Go to client side and connect the  FTP  server by  # ftp   172.25.9.11   command. 
 
10. How to configure the  FTP  server  to  upload the files feature? 
(i) Open the  FTP  configuration file  by  # vim  /etc/vsftpd/vdftpd.conf    command. 
(ii) Go to line no : 19  and  type as,    writable_enable=yes

(v) Change the group of the  upload  directory as  ftp  by  # chgrp  ftp  upload    command. 
(vi) Change the permissions of the  upload  directory  by   # chmod   775  upload    command. 
(vii) To permanently add the ftp service to SELinux  policy  by 
# getsebool     -a | grep   ftp 
 
 
(to check the  SELinux  Booleans  for  FTP service) 
# setsebool    -p   allow_ftpd_anon_write   on 
 # chcon   -t   public_content_rw_t    upload             (to add read-write context of the upload directory) 
# setsebool    -p   ftp    --full-access=1   command   or  # setenforce=0     command to disable the  SELinux. 
(viii) Restart the ftp deamon  by   # service   vsftpd   restart    command in  RHEL - 6   or 
# systemctl   restart  vsftpd    command  in  RHEL - 7. 
 
11. How to deny the particular system to use the  FTP  server? 
 
(i) Open the  /etc/hosts.deny   file  and put an entry of system which one to deny the ftp service. 
 
 # vim   /etc/hosts.deny  
 
(goto  last line and type as below) 
 
 vsftpd :    172.25.9.10  
 
(to deny  172.25.9.10 system) 
 
 vsftpd :    ALL 
 
 
 
(to deny  all the systems) 
 
 vsftpd :    ALL   EXCEPT   *.example.com   
                                               (to deny all the systems  except  example.com  domain  systems) 
 
 (save  and  exit  the file) 
(ii) 
Restart the ftp deamon  by  
(iii) 
 # service   vsftpd   restart    command in  RHEL - 6   or 
 
 # systemctl   restart  vsftpd    command  in  RHEL - 7. 
 
*  Now 172.25.9.10  system will not access the  FTP services. 
 
*   If we put an entry  in  /etc/hosts.allow    file as,  ALLOW   ALL  EXCEPT  172.25.5.10  then,  except   
 
172.25.5.10 system all the systems can avail the  FTP  service. 
 
12. How to change the ownership of the uploaded file in FTP? 
If  we upload  or  download any files the files  owner  and  group  are  ftp  only. We can change the 
ownership of the uploaded  or  downloaded files as follows. 
(i) Open the  FTP  configuration file by   # vim  /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf    command. 
(ii) Go to line no : 48  and  type as,    chown_upload=yes 
(iii) Go to line no : 49  and  type as,   chown_username=<user name>

 type as,    
ftp_banner=" Welcome  to  Hyderabad " 
 
 
 
(v) We can limit the  FTP  maximum connections  at a time  to  5  by put an entry in configuration file as, 
  
max_clients=5  
 
 
(save  and  exit  the file) 
 
 
(v) Restart the ftp deamon  by   # service   vsftpd   restart    command in  RHEL - 6   or 
# systemctl   restart  vsftpd    command  in  RHEL - 7. 
 
13. How to deny specific users to access the ftp services? 
 
(i) Open the  FTP  users  file by  # vim  /etc/vsftpd/ftpusers    command. 
 
(ii) Enter the user names whom to deny  FTP  services.  For example  as follows, 
 
 root 
 
 raju 
 
 junnu  
 
 
 
 
              (save  and  exit  the file) 
(ii) 
Restart the ftp deamon  by    
# service   vsftpd   restart    command in  RHEL - 6   or 
 
 # systemctl   restart  vsftpd    command  in  RHEL - 7. 
 
14. What is  LFTP  and  how to configure  LFTP? 
 
LFTP   is also used to upload  or  download the files.  But, by using  LFTP  we can login to the  FTP  server 
without password  because It will not ask any passwords. To use LFTP we have to install the LFTP 
package on server. 
 
(i)  Install  the  LFTP package  by  # yum  install  lftp*   -y   command. 
 
(ii) Restart the  lftp deamon  by   # service   lftpd   restart    command in  RHEL - 6   or 
 
 # systemctl   restart  lftpd    command  in  RHEL - 7. 
 
(iii) Go to client system and access the  LFTP server by, 
 
 # lftp   172.25.9.11 
 
(to connect the  LFTP  server) 
 
 lftp> cd  pub 
 
 
(to move to the pub directory) 
 
 lftp>  get   f1   
 
(to download the  f1  file) 
 
 lftp>  mget   f2  f3  f4  f5 
 
(to download the  f2  f3  f4  and  f5  multiple files  at a time) 
 
 lftp> put   f9 
 
 
(to  upload the f9  file) 
 
 lftp> mput   f10  f11  f12 
(to upload  the f10  f11  f12   multiple files  at a time) 
 
 lftp> quit 
 
 
(to quit the  ftp server) 
 
   *   In  LFTP  " Tab "  key works  as usual  but  in  FTP   " Tab "  will not work. 
 
15. How to allow the root user to access the  FTP  server? 
By  default root user is blocked to access the  FTP  server. To allow the root user to access the  FTP server  
follow the below steps. 
 (i)  Open  the  /etc/vsftpd/user_list   file by   # vim   /etc/vsftpd/user_list    command. 
 (ii) Go to  root user line  and  comment on that line.  For example   
    # root  
 
  
 
 
           (save  and  exit  the  file) 
 (iii) Open  the  /etc/vsftpd/ftpuser    file by   # vim   /etc/vsftpd/ftpuser    command. 
 (iv) Go to  root user line  and  comment on that line.  For example    
     # root  
(save  and  exit  the  file) 
(v) 
Restart the ftp deamon  by

# service   vsftpd   restart    command in  RHEL - 6   or 
 # systemctl   restart  vsftpd    command  in  RHEL - 7. 
 *   Even though  we changed the above, the  root  user cannot access the  FTP  server because the 
     home  directory context is not added. we can solve this as follows. 
 (vi) # getsebool    -a | grep   ftp  
  (to check the SELinux Boolean  of the root home directory) 
 (vii) # setsebool    -p   ftp_home_dir    on 
(to change the Boolean of the root home directory) 
 *   Now go to client system and try to login the  FTP  server as root user.  Here we can access the  FTP   
    server. 
 
16. What are the difference between  FTP  and  LFTP  servers? 
(i)The user name  and  password  are required to access the  FTP server but  LFTP does not requires  
passwords. 
(ii) In  ftp>prompt the  " Tab "  key will not work  but  in  lftp>   prompt  the  " Tab "  key will work  as 
usual.  
Other  useful  FTP   Commands : 
 
# ftp   172.25.9.11 
 
 
(to access the  FTP  server  provide  FTP user name  and  
password) 
 
ftp >  ls  
 
 
 
 
(to see all the files  and  directories in FTP root 
directory) 
 
ftp >  !ls  
 
 
 
 
(to see the local nothing present working directory files) 
 
ftp >  pwd 
 
 
 
 
 
(to see the  FTP  present working directory)

Chapter#15 – NFS(Network File System)  
1. 
What is NFS?  Explain it. 
 
NFS  stands for  Network  File  system  and  it is way to share the local hard drive files between  
machines which are  NFS  compatible. That means we share the files between Linux and Unix machines 
but not between Linux and windows systems. NFS  is used  upd  protocol. 
 
Normally the  NFS  server exports one or more directories to the client system  and  the client system 
mount one or more of the shared directories called mount points. After the NFS is mounted, all I/O 
operations are written back to the server,  and all the clients notice the change.  A manual refresh is not 
needed because the client access the remote file systems  same as local file system because access does 
not requires the  IP address,  user name  and  password. However we can provide the security using the 
kerberos security. 
 
2. 
What are the disadvantages of  NFS? 
 
(i)  NFS does not support cross plat forms. ie.,  it will not support the sharing the files between Linux and 
 Windows systems. 
 
(ii) NFS  does not support encryption of the data  and  it supports only plain text format.  
 
(iii)  NFS does not support  TCP Wrappers, ie.,  NFS  does not support  /etc/hosts.allow  and  
/etc/hosts.deny,  because there is no  libwrap.so  module is not loaded with NFS service. 
 
(iv) NFS  does not support authentication. So, to overcome this  problem  kerberos  security system is 
used. 
 
3. 
What is the profile of  NFS?

4. 
What are the background deamons for NFS  and  explain them? 
 
There are  6 background  deamons  for  NFS. 
(i) rpc . mountd : 
 
  
  
This  deamon is responsible for executing  mount  and  unmount  requests by the  client. 
 
(ii) rpc . nfsd : 
 
This  deamon  responds  to  clients requests for file access. 
(iii) rpc . rquotad :  
This  deamon  is  responsible  for enabling quotas  on  NFS shared devices. 
 
(iv) rpc . statd :  This  deamon  is used to see the statistics  about  NFS server  from  NFS  client when

           executing the  
commands   # netstat    or   # nfsstat (to see the  I/O  statistics  of  NFS)  
 
(v) rpc . lockd : This  deamon manages file locks  and  releases incase of client disconnected. 
 
(vi)  rpc . idmapd : This  deamon  is responsible for mapping  user id  and  group id  towards themselves. 
 
5. 
What are the difference between  NFS 3   and   NFS 4? 
 
In  NFS 3  there is no security to protect the data,  but in  NFS 4 there is a kerberos security to protect the 
data. 
 
In  NFS 3  there is no  ACL  permissions on the shared directory, but in  NFS 4 there is an  ACL  
permissions on the shared directory. 
 
6. 
In how many ways we can mount the NFS  shared directory? 
In order to access the  NFS  shared data, we have to mount that shared directory on local mount point. 
The mounting can be direct mount (manual mount)   and  indirect mount (auto mount). 
Direct mount : 
First create the local mount point and then mount that shared  NFS directory on our local systems mount 
point by   # mount    <server  host  name  or  IP address> : <shared directory with full path><mount 
point>     command. But this is temporary mount  and  we can mount it permanently by put an entry in  
/etc/fstab   file. 
Example : 
# mount    172.25.9.11:/product    /mnt/nfs        
                            (to mount the directory  /product  on  /nfs  mount point temporarily) 
# vim  /etc/fstab  
        (open this file and put an entry of mount point  to mount permanently) 
172.25.9.11:/product 
/mnt/nfs 
nfs 
defaults 
0 
0 
(save   and   exit this file) 
 
Indirect  mount : 
This method  is used to mount the NFS share by using the Autofs service. Autofs uses the automount 
daemon to manage our mount points by only mounting them dynamically when they are accessed. 
Autofs consults the master map configuration file /etc/auto.master to determine which mount points 
are defined. It then starts an automount process with the appropriate parameters for each mount point. 
Each line in the master map defines a mount point and a separate map file that defines the file systems 
to be mounted  under this mount point.  
 
For example, the /etc/auto.misc file might define mount points in the /mnt directory; this relationship 
would be defined in the /etc/auto.master file. 
Each entry in auto.master has three fields. The first field is the mount point. The second field is the 
location of the map file, and the third field is optional. The third field can contain information such as a 
timeout value. 
 
For example, to mount the directory /product on the remote machine server9.example.com at the 
mount  point /mnt/nfs on your machine, add the following line to auto.master: 
/mnt 
 
/etc/auto.misc      --timeout  60 
Next, add the following line to /etc/auto.misc: 
nfs 
 
-rw  
server9.example.com:/product 
The first field in /etc/auto.misc is the name of the /mnt subdirectory.

SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|107 
 
 
This subdirectory is created dynamically by automount. It should not actually exist on the client 
machine. The second field contains mount options such asrw for read and write access. The third field is 
the location of the NFS export including the hostname and directory. 
The directory /mnt must be exits on the local file system. There should be no sub directories on the local 
file system. 
To start the autofs service, at a shell prompt, type the following command: 
 # servive autofs restart 
 To view the active mount points, type the following command at a shell prompt: 
 # service autofs status 
 If you modify the /etc/auto.master configuration file while autofs is running, you must tell the 
automount  
daemon(s) to reload by typing the following command at a shell prompt: 
 # service autofs reload 
 
7. 
How to configure NFS server? 
 
(i) First  install the  NFS package by   # yum  install  nfs*    -y    command. 
 
(ii) Create the  NFS shared directory on server system by   # mkdir    /public   command. 
 
(iii) Modify  the permissions of the  /public   directory by   # chmod  777  /public   command.  (These 
permissions may be changed depend on it's requirement) 
 
(iv) Modify the SELinux context of the /public directory if SELinux is enabled  by executing the below 
command. # chcon    -t    public_content_t     /public 
 
(v) create some files in the  /public directory by   # touch    f{1..10}    command. 
 
(vi) Open the file  NFS  configuration file and put an entry of the NFS shared information by  # vim   
/etc/exports 
command and type as an entry like   <shared directory name> <to whom to export the 
shared directory> 
(<permissions>,  sync) 
 
For example, 
 
# vim   /etc/exports          /public *.example.com  
(ro/rw, sync) 
 
 
 
        
(save  and  exit the file)  
 
 *   Where  *.example.com  means  the shared directory can be exported to  all the systems of the  
      example.com  domain. 
 
 *   Permissions  like  ro (read only)  or  rw (read  & write)  and sync means  the data will always be 
synced. 
 
/public   
desktop9.example.com (rw, sync) 
(to export the /public to desktop 5 system only) 
 
/public 
*.example.com (ro, sync) 
    (export to the entire example.com domain with read only)  
 
/public 
172.25.0.0/24 (rw, sync) 
       (export to 172.25.0.0  network only with read and write) 
 
/public 
 
server [ 0 - 20 ].example.com  (rw,  sync)  
(export to server0  to  server20 in  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  example.com domain  with read and write) 
 
/public 
172.25.0.10 (rw, sync)  
     (export to 172.25.0.10  network only with read and write) 
 
 
Common Mount permission options : 
 
rw 
read/write permissions 
ro 
read-only permissions 
insecure 
Allows the use of ports over 1024

The following commands could be helpful for troubleshooting : 
# mountstats 
Shows information about mounted NFS shares 
# nfsstat 
Shows statistics of exported resources 
# nfsiostat 
Shows statistics of NFS mounted shares 
 
 
  
In  RHEL - 7 : 
 
# firewall-cmd     --permanent      -add-service=nfs 
 
(to enable the  nfs  service  at  firewall) 
 
# firewall-cmd     --permanent      -add-service=mountd  (to enable the mountd  service  at  firewall) 
 
# firewall-cmd    --permanent      -add-service=rpc-bind   (to enable the rpc-bind  service  at firewall)

(to reload the firewall) 
 
8. 
What are requirements for  NFS client? 
 
(i) NFS  server  IP address  or  hostname. 
 
(ii) Check  the  NFS  shared name. 
 
(iii) Create the  local  mount point. 
 
(iv) Mount the  NFS  shared name on the local mount point. 
 
(v) Go to mount point (local mount point)  and  access the  NFS  shared data. 
 
9. 
How to access the NFS shared directory from the client? 
(i)  On Client system,  install the   nfs-utils    package  by   # yum  install  nfs-utils*    -y    command. 
(ii) Check the exported  NFS  shared directory by  # showmount  -e  <IP address   or  hostname of the 
server> 
  
Example :  # showmount    -e    172.25.9.11     or     # showmount     -e    server9.example.com 
(iii)  Create one mount point to mount the  NFS  shared directory by   
# mkdir    /<mount point>   command. 
  
 
Example :  # mkdir    /mnt/nfs 
(iv)  Mount the  NFS shared directory on the above created mount point. 
  
 
# mount    <IP address   or   server hostname> : <NFS  shared directory><mount point> 
  
 
Example :  # mount     172.25.9.11:/public    /mnt/nfs     or     
  
 
 
     # mount     server9.example.com:/public      /mnt/nfs 
*   These are temporary mount only. ie.,  If the system is rebooted these are unmounted  automatically 
and we have to mount again after the system is rebooted. 
 (v) So, if we want to mount it permanently, then open   /etc/fstab   file and put an entry of the mount 
point. 
# vim   /etc/fstab 
 
 
 
 
 
(to open the file) 
 <IP address   or   server hostname> : <shared name><mount point><file system>    defaults    0  0 
  
 
Example :  172.25.9.11:/public    /mnt/nfs      nfs     defaults     0    0           ( or ) 
      server9.example.com:/public      /mnt/nfs      nfs      defaults      0     0           (save and exit the file) 
(vi) Mount all the mount points  as mentioned in the above   /etc/fstab   file by    # mount   -a     
command. 
(vii)  # df    -hT    command is used to check all the mounted partitions with file system types. 
 
10. Why root user cannot create the files in the  NFS shared directory  and  how to make him to  
           create the files?

SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|110 
 
 
The root user normally has all the permissions,  but in  NFS  root user is also becomes as  a normal  user.  
So,  the root user having no permissions to create the files on the  NFS  shared directory.  
The root user becomes as  nfsnobodyuser  and  group  also  nfsnobody   due to   root_squash   
permission is there by default.  So, if we want to make the root user to create file on the  NFS  shared 
directory, then go to server side  and  open the   /etc/exports   file and  type as below, 
 <shared  name> 
<domain  name or  systems names>(permissions, sync, no_root_squash) 
 Example :  /public 
   *.example.com(rw, sync, no_root_squash)  
 
     (save  and  
exit  the file) 
# exportfs    -rv  
 
 
 
(to export the shared directory) 
# service  nfs  restart 
 
 
 
(to restart the  NFS  service  in RHEL - 6) 
# systemctl  restart  nfs-server 
 
 
(to restart the  NFS  service  in RHEL - 7) 
 
11. What are the disadvantages of the direct  or  manual mounting? 
(i)  Manual mounting means, we have to mount manually, so it creates so many problems.  For example 
if  NFS service is not available then,  # df    -hT   command will hang. 
(ii) If the  NFS  server is down while booting the client, the client will not boot because it searches for  
NFS mount point as an entry in  /etc/fstab   file. 
(iii) Another disadvantage of manual mounting is it consumes more memory and   CPU   resources on 
the client system.So,  to overcome the above problems normally  indirect  or  automount  is used using  
Autofs tool. 
 
12. What is secure  NFS  server  and explain it? 
Secure  NFS  server means  NFS  server with Kerberos security. It is used to protect the  NFS  exports.  
Kerbebors is a authentication tool to protect the  NFS  server shares.  It uses the  krb5p method to 
protect by authentication mechanism and encrypt the data while communication.  
For this one key file is required and this should be stored in each and every client which are accessing the 
nfs secure directory. Then only Kerberos security will be available. This key file should be stored in  
/etc/krb5.keytab  file.  For example the following command will download and store the keytab. 
# wget   http://classroom.example.com/pub/keytabs/server9.keytab    -O  /etc/krb5.keytab  (where  O is 
capital) 
 
13. How to configure the secure  NFS  server? 
(i) Install the  NFS  package. 
 # yum  install  nfs*   -y 
(ii) Create a directory to share through  NFS  server. 
# mkdir   /securenfs 
(iii) Modify the permissions of shared directory. 
# chmod    777   /securenfs 
(iv)Change the SELinux  context of the directory if the SELinux is enabled. 
# chcon   -t   public_content_t     /securenfs 
(v) Open the  NFS  configuration file and put an entry of the shared directory. 
  
# vim   /etc/exports 
   /securenfs 
*.example.com(rw,sec=krb5p)  
 
 
       (save  and  exit  the file) 
(vi)Download the keytab and store it in  /etc/krb5.keytb    file. 
  
# wget   http://classroom.example.com/pub/keytabs/server9.keytab    -O   /etc/krb5.keytab

17. What are the advantages of  NFS? 
(i) NFS  allows multiple computers can use same files, because all the users on the network or domain  
can access the same data. 
 
(ii) NFS  reduces the storage costs by sharing applications on computers instead of allocating local disk 
space for  each user application. 
(iii) NFS  provides  data consistency and reliability, because all users can read same set of files. 
(iv) NFS  supports heterogeneous environments  which are compatible to NFS. 
(v) NFS  reduces  System Administration overhead. 
 
18. Remote user cannot mount the NFS shared directory. How to resolve this? 
 
(i) First check the user belongs to the same domain as the NFS shared  or  not. ie.,  the user's system 
domain  and  NFS  shared system domain should communicate. 
 
(ii) Check the user's system is pinging  or  not. 
 
(iii) Check the user's name is present,  not present  or  disabled  to access the  NFS server. 
 
(iv) Check the mounted file system is shared  or  not. 
 
(v) Check all the  NFS  server  and  client  deamons  are running  or  not. 
 
(vi) Check all the network connections are properly established  or  not. 
 
(vii) Check whether the  NFS service is running or not in server's current run level. 
 
(viii) Check whether the  NFS server is running  or  hung  or  shutdown. 
 
(ix) Check  both  NFS  server  and  NFS  client systems  network routers,  network connections  and  IP 
addresses. 
 
(x)  Check the mount point is correct  or  not,  paths  are  correct  or  not  and  files  are there or not. 
 
(xi) Check  the  NFS  shared directory  and  mount point  details  are correct  or  not  in  /etc/fstab   file. 
 
(xii) Check the keytabs are downloaded  and stored properly in  /etc/krb5.keytab  file  on both  NFS  
server  and   client. 
 
(xii) Finally  check whether the  NFS  port no. 2049 is running  or not  and  make sure that the IP tables  
or   firewall should not block the  NFS  service. 
 
19. NFS  server  and  NFS  client configurations are OK,  but at client it is not showing anything.  How  
          to resolve? 
 
(i)  The  rpcbind  may be failed. 
 
(ii) The server is not responding. 
 
(iii) NFS  client may be failed at reboot. 
 
(iv) The  NFS service is not responding. 
 
(v) The deamons on both systems may not be running. 
 
(vi) Network may be failed on both  server  and  client  or  any one system. 
 
(vii) May be  server  and  client are not in the same domain  or  not pinging. 
 
(viii) The server may be in hung  or  shutdown  state.

20. What is Autofs ? 
Autofs is  service that can automatically mount the shared directory on demand and will automatically 
unmount the shared directory if it is not accessed within the specified timeout period. The default 
timeout period is  5 minutes  or  we can specify the timeout period in  /etc/auto.master   file. 
 
21. What are the advantages of the  Autofs? 
(i)  Shares are accessed automatically and transparently when a user tries to access any files or       
directories under the  designated mount point of the remote file system to be mounted. 
(ii) Booting time is significantly reduced because no mounting is done at boot time. 
(iii) Network access and efficiency are improved by reducing the number of permanently active mount 
points. 
(iv) Failed mount requests can be reduced by designating alternate servers as the source of a file system. 
(v) Users do not need to have root privilegesto  mount   or  unmount  the mount point. 
(vi) We can reduce the  CPU and  memory utilizations because autofs  will not mount permanently. 
(vii) We can also reduce hard disk utilization because permanent mount points  occupies the hard disk 
space.  
 
22. What are the minimum  requirements for  Autofs? 
 
(i) autofs    package. 
 
(ii) autofs deamon. 
 
(iii) One shared directory. 
 
(iv) One mount point. 
 
(v) Two configuration files are, 
 
 (a)  /etc/auto.master 
 
 (b)  /etc/auto.misc 
 
23. How to configure  Autofs? 
 
(i) Install  the autofs  package  by   # yum  install  autofs*   -y    command. 
 
(ii) Open   /etc/auto.master   file by   # vim   /etc/auto.master  and  at last type as below. 
 
 < Client's  local  mount  point>  
/etc/auto.misc      --timeout=60 
         Example : 
 
/mnt 
 
/etc/auto.misc  
 
 
 
 
 
(save  and   exit  this file) 
 
( *  Where  timeout=60  means,  if the directory is not used  for 60 seconds then the shared directory is  
 
      unmounted  automatically.  And the default is  5 minutes.) 
         (iii) Open  /etc/auto.misc  file by  # vim  /etc/auto.misc  and types as below. 
       < Client temporary mount point >-<permissions><IP address or  hostname of the server> : <shared name> 
 
Example : 
 
nfs 
-ro  (or)  -rw 
 
classroom.example.com:/public 
 
(save  and  exit  this file) 
 
 ( *  where   -ro  means  read-only   and   -rw  means  read-write) 
 
(iv) Restart the  autofs  service in  RHEL -6  and  RHEL - 7. 
 
 # service  autofs  restart 
 
 
 
 
(restart the  autofs  service  in  RHEL - 6) 
 
 # chkconfig   autofs  on  
 
 
      (enable the  autofs  service at next boot  in  RHEL - 6) 
 
 # systemctl  restart  autofs 
 
 
 
 
(restart the  autofs  service  in  RHEL - 7) 
 
 # systemctl  enable  autofs 
 
 
      (enable the  autofs  service at next boot  in  RHEL - 7) 
   
(iv) Goto  the Client local mount point which is entered in  /et/auto.master   file by

24. What is  LDAP server? 
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a software protocol for enabling anyone to locate 
organizations, individuals, and other resources such as files and devices in a network, whether on the 
public Internet or on a corporate intranet.LDAP is lighter because in its initial version it did not include 
security features. 
 
25. What is LDAP client? 
LDAP Client is a network user creation and activity. LDAP user means network user. Network user means 
login the user through network. If a user wants to login to the remote system, the LDAP user should be 
created and login to the remote system through LDAP account. 
Upto  RHEL -5 for this NIS (Network  Information  System) is used.  From  RHEL - 6 onwards  LDAP is 
using. The main feature of the LDAP is to share the users information in network. 
 
26. What are the requirements of LDAP  and  explain it? 
 
(i) Packages. 
 
 (a)  authconfig-gtk  (to configure the LDAP client) 
 
 (b)  sssd  (system security service deamon) 
 
(ii) LDAP  client configuration file is  /etc/ldap.conf 
 
(iii) LDAP kerberos configuration file is  /etc/krb5.conf 
 
(iv) sssd  (systems security service deamon)  deamon. 
 
(v) LDAP  port no.  is  389. 
 
(vi) sssd  deamon responsibility is retrieving and caching the authentication information. 
 
(vii) The configuration file of  sssd  is  /etc/sssd/sssd.conf 
(ix) Through  NIS the data is transferred in plain text format.   
So, there is no security. But LDAP will transfer the data in encrypted format.  So, the data will be 
in secured way. 
 
(ix) LDAP is used by default  sssd  ie.,  kerberos. 
 
27. What  are  the requirements  for LDAP client? 
 
(i) dc  (domain  controller) 
 
 Example :   If the domain is  example.com  then  dc=example,  dc=com 
 
(ii) ldap  server 
 
 Example :  ldap://classroom.example.com 
 
(iii) Authentication certificate  (example-ca.crt)  is located in http://classroom.example.com/pub     
            directory.

28. How to configure the  LDAP client? 
(i) Create the  LDAP user. 
(ii) Configure the kerberos. 
(iii) configure the  NFS  automount to share the  LDAP  user's home directory. 
  
So,  LDAP + NFS + sssd   is the  LDAP  system. 
*   LDAP  is used share the user name and password to remote system. 
*   sssd   is used to authenticate in secured communication. 
*   NFS  is used to share the user's  home directory to remote system. 
Steps : 
 (i)  Install the  LDAP + kerberos  packages  by  the following commands. 
  # yum  groupinstall  directory*   -y 
 
 
 
 
 
(installation  in  RHEL - 6) 
 # yum  install  authconfig-gtk*   sssd*   -y 
 
 
 
 
(installation  in  RHEL - 7) 
 *   The LDAP packages are different  in  RHEL - 6  and  RHEL - 7 but, the configuration of  LDAP  is same  
    in  both the versions. 
 (ii) 
Create the  LDAP  users  and  passwords  in  the  LDAP  server. 
 (iii) Configure the  LDAP  user's  authentication by   # system_config_authentication    command in  
    Graphical user interface. 
 (iv) The above command will display the configuration window and in that select  and  type the option  
     as below. 
  
User  Account  Database 
=   LDAP 
  
LDAP  search  base  on  
=   dc=example,  dc=com 
  
LDAP  server 
 
 
=   ldap://classroom.example.com/ 
  
Enable  TLS  to  encrypt  
=   Click on  Download  CA  Certificate  button and then enter  
    the  url  as,    http://classroom.example.com:/pub/example-ca.crt 
  
Authentication  Method 
=   LDAP  Password 
            (then  click on  Apply button) 
 (v) Check whether the  LDAP  user is configured  or  not by  # getent  password  ldapuser9   command. 
 
29. How to mount the  LDAP  user's  home directory automatically when demand using  Autofs  tool? 
(i) Install the  autofs  package  by   # yum  install  autofs*    -y   command. 
(ii) Open the  /etc/auto.master   file by  # vim  /etc/auto.master   command  and  type as below. 
 /home/guests  
/etc/auto.misc  
 
 
 
 
(save  and  exit  this file) 
(iii) Open the  /etc/auto.misc   file by  # vim  /etc/auto.misc   command  and  type as below. 
 ldapuesr9 
-rw 
classrrom.example.com:/home/guests/ldapuser9 
(save  and  exit  this file) 
(iv) Restart the autofs  services. 
  
# service  autofs  restart 
 
 
 
(restart the autofs  service  in  RHEL - 6) 
  
# chkconfig   autofs  on  
 
(enable the autofs service at next boot  in  RHEL - 6) 
  
# systemctl   restart  autofs 
 
 
 
(restart the autofs  service  in  RHEL - 7) 
  
# systemctl   enable  autofs 
 
(enable the autofs service at next boot  in  RHEL - 7) 
(v) Check whether the  LDAP user is able to login  or  not. 
  
# su   -   ldapuser9 
 
 
 
 
 
       (to switch to ldapuser9) 
  
$ pwd  
 
 
 
 
          (to see the present working directory) 
  
   *  The output of the above command  is  /home/guests/ldapuser9 
  
$ ls 
 
 
 
 
     (to see the files in  LDAP  user's   home directory) 
  
$ exit  
 
 
 
 
           (to exit  or  logout  of the  LDAP  user)

Chapter#16 – Samba Server  
 
1. 
What is Samba  and  explain it? 
(i) An open source implementation of the SMB file sharing protocolthat provides file and print services to   
SMB/CIFS clients. Samba allows a non-Windows server to communicate with the same networking 
protocol as the Windows products. 
(ii) Samba allows Linux computers to share files and printers across a network connection by using  SMB 
protocol. Samba will support  DFS, NFS,  ufs  file systems to share files and directories. That's why  
Samba  is used to share files and directories between different platforms. 
(iii) Samba will support printer sharing and it requires authentication. 
 
2. 
What are the differences between  Samba   and  NFS? 
(i) Samba supports to all O/S  platforms,  whereas  NFS will support the same platforms only.  
(ii) There is a security in Samba because  Samba requires authentication,  whereas  in  NFS  there is no 
security if there is no kerberos because  NFS does not requires authentication. 
(iii) Samba will support printer sharing,  whereas  NFS  will not support printer sharing. 
 
3. 
What are the different file systems for sharing different  O/S? 
 
(i) 
Windows    ---   Windows   ----->   Distributed  File system  (DFS) 
 
(ii) 
Linux     ---  Linux   ----->   Network File system  (NFS) 
 
(iii) 
Unix     ---  Unix   ----->   Network File system  (NFS) 
 
(iv) 
Apple  MAC    ---   Apple  MACs   ----->  Apple  File sharing  Protocol  (AFP) 
 
(v) 
Windows    ---   Linux   ----->   Common  Internet  File  system  (CIFS) 
 
4. 
What are the requirements  or  what is the profile of  Samba? 
 (i) Packages

Chapter#17 – NTP (Netwotk Time Protocal)  
 
1. 
What is  NTP  and  Chrony? 
NTP stands for Network Time Protocol in  RHEL - 6  and  Chrony is also a Network Time Protocol in  RHEL 
- 7.These are used to synchronize the time on your Linux system with a centralized NTP  or  Chrony 
server.A local NTP  or  Chrony server on the network can be synchronized with an external timing source 
to keep all the servers in your organization in-sync with an accurate time. 
 
2. 
What are the differences between  NTP  and  Chrony? 
 
NTP 
Chrony 
This is used in  RHEL - 6. 
This is used in  RHEL - 7. 
Package is  ntp  or  system-config-date. 
Package is  chrony. 
It's  deamon is  ntpd  and  Port number is  123. 
It's  deamon is  chronyd  and  Port number is  123. 
We have to install the package manually. 
By  default  this package is installed. 
# ntpq   -p    (to check  ntp  is configured  or  not). 
# chronyc  sources   -v   (to check  chrony  is  
configured  or  not). 
Configuration  file  is  /etc/ntp.conf 
Configuration  file  is  /etc/chrony.conf 
Log  file  is  /var/log/ntpstat 
Log  file  is  /var/log/chrony 
 
3. 
How to configure the  NTP  and  Chrony  client? 
NTP : 
(i)  Install the  ntp  package by  # yum  install  ntp*  -y   or   # yum  install  system-config-date*    -y   
command. 
(ii) open the configuration file  by   
      # system-config-date    or   
      # vim   /etc/ntp.conf    command. 
   (# system-config-date   command is used to configure the  NTP  in graphical mode) 
 *   Make a comment on  line numbers  21,  22  and  23. Then  go to line number  24 and  type as below.

Chapter#18 – DNS (Domain Naming System)  
1. 
What is DNS? 
DNS  stands for Domain  Naming System. The DNStranslates Internet domain and host names to IP 
addresses. DNS automatically converts the names we type in our Web browser address bar to the IP 
addresses of Web servers hosting those sites. 
DNS implements a distributed database to store this name and address information for all public hosts 
on the Internet. DNS assumes IP addresses do not change (are statically assigned rather than 
dynamically assigned). 
 
2. 
What is DNS server and how it works? 
In any network, the hosts primarily communicate between each other through IP addresses. For 
example, if my  computer is doing a google search, my computer is actually communicating with the IP 
address of one of the  
web servers of google.com. However, even if the computer is efficient with 
numbers, humans on the other hand  
work better with names. For this reason, the TCP/IP protocol 
includes the Domain Name System (DNS)  to link  
between IPs and computer names i.e. 
hostnames. The DNS is a distributed database of computers that is  
responsible for resolving 
hostnames against IP addresses and vice-versa. 
Any DNS query involves two parts. 
(i)  The Resolver: The resolver forms up or initiates the query. The resolver itself does not run as a 
program.  /etc/resolve.conf is an example of a resolver. 
(ii) Name Server: The Name Server is the service running in the server that responds to the DNS query 
generated by the resolver i.e. answers to the question of the resolver. 
The working  DNS : 
(i)  The client initiates a query to find a domain  example.com. The client sends the query to the DNS 
server of the ISP. (The DNS Server IP in the client computer is set as the IP address of the DNS Server of 
the ISP) 
(ii) The DNS Server of the ISP first checks it's own cache to check whether it already knows the answer. 
But as the answer is not present, it generates another query. As the Top  Level  Domain of example.com  
is  .com, so the DNS server queries the  Internet Registration Authority to find who is responsible for 
example.com. 
(iii) The Internet Registration Authority  responds to the ISP by answering the query. 
(iv) Once the ISP DNS Server knows the authoritative name servers, it contacts the authoritative name 
servers to find out the IP address for www.example.com i.e. the IP address of host www in the domain 
example.com. 
 
(v) example.com responds to the ISP DNS Server by answering the query and providing the IP address of 
the web server i.e. www 
(vi) The ISP DNS Server stores the answer in it's cache for future use and answers to the client by sending 
the IP  address of the www server. 
(vii) The client may store the answer to the DNS query in it's own cache for future use. Then the client 
communicates directly with the www server of domain example.com using the IP address. 
(viii) 
The www server responds by sending the index.html page.

3. 
What is the format of the domain name? 
Like  a physical address,  internet domain names are hierarchical way. If the Fully Qualified Domain 
Name is  www.google.co.in ,  the  www  is the Hostname,  google  is the  Domain,  co  is the  Second  
Level  Domain  and in  is the  Top  Level  Domain. 
 
4. 
What are the files we have to edit to configure the  DNS? 
There are  four  files to edit to configure the DNS. They are  /etc/named.conf,  
/etc/named.rfc1912.zones,  Forward  Lookup  Zoneand  Reverse  Lookup  Zone.  DNS  provides a 
centralised database for resolution.  Zone is storage databasewhich contains all the records.  
Forward  Lookup  Zone  is used to resolveHostnames  to  IP addresses. 
Reverse  Lookup  Zone  is used to resolve  IP addresses  to  Hostnames. 
 
5. 
What are the DNS record  and  explain them? 
 (i) SOA  Record :  (Start  of  Authority) 
  
SOA  contains the general  administration  and  control  information about the domain. 
 (ii)  Host  A  Record : 
  
(a)  It  is nothing but aForward  Lookup  Zone. 
  
(b)  It maps  Hostname  to  IP address. 
 (iii)  PTR :  (Pointer  Record) 
  
(a)  It is nothing but a  Reverse  Lookup  Zone. 
  
(b)  It maps  IP address  to  Hostname. 
 (iv)  NS  Record :  (Name  Server  Record) 
  
It  stores the  DNS  server  IP addresses. 
 (v)  MX  Record :  (Mail  Exchange  Record) 
  
It  stores the records of the  Mail  Server  IP address. 
 (vi)  CNME  Record : 
  
It  is nothing but Host's  Canonical  name allows additional  names  or  aliases to be used locate a system.

Chapter#19 – DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocal) 
1. 
What is  DHCP  and  explain it? 
DHCP  stands  for  Dynamic  Host  Configuration  Protocol.  DHCP is a network protocol that enables the 
server to assign an  IP addresses to the clients in the network automatically from a defined range of IP 
addresses  ie., scope configured for a given network. DHCP  allows a computer to join in an IP-based 
network without having a pre-configured  IP address.  DHCP  is a protocol that assign unique IP 
addresses to devices,  then releases  and  renews those addresses as devices leave  and  rejoin in the 
network. Internet  Service  Providers  (ISPs) usually use  DHCP  to help customers join their networks with 
minimum setup effort required. Likewise,  home network equipment like broadband routers  offers  
DHCP  support to joining  home computers to  Local  Area  Networks  (LANs). In  simple terms  DHCP is 
used to assign the  IP addresses to the remote hosts  automatically. First client requests to the  DHCP  
server,  then  DHCP  server accepts the client's request  and  assign the next available  IP address to the 
requested  DHCP  client. 
 
2. 
How  the  DHCP  works? 
The  process of requesting the  IP address from the  DHCP  clients  and  assign the  IP address by the  
DHCP  server is called  "D O R A". 
(i)  When we switch on the system with  DHCP  client,  the client system sends the  broadcast  request    
looking  for a  DHCP  server to answer.  This  process is called  DISCOVER  or  DHCP DISCOVER. 
(ii) The  router directs the  DISCOVER  packet to the correct  DHCP  server. 
 (iii) The server receives the  DISCOVER  packet.  Based on availability  and  usage policies set on the 
server,  the server determines an appropriate address  (if  any) to give to the client. The server then 
temporarily reserves that address for the client and sends back to the client an  OFFER  orDHCP OFFER  
packet with that address information.  The server also configures the client's  DNS  servers,  WINS  
servers,  NTP  serves  and  sometimes  other  services also. 
(iv)  Then  the  Client sends  a  REQUEST  or  DHCP REQUEST  packet,  letting the server know that it 
intends to use the address. 
(v) Then  the  server sends  an  ACK  or  DHCP ACK  packet,  conforming that the client has been given  a  
lease on the address for a  server  specified  period  of  time. 
 
3. 
What is the disadvantage to assign the  Static  IP address? 
When  a  system uses  a  static  IP address,  It means that the system is manually configured to use a 
specific  IP address. One problem with static assignment,which can result from user error  or  inattention  
to detail,  occurs when two systems are configured with the same  IP address.  This creates a conflict 
that results in loss of service. Using DHCP  to  dynamically assign  IP addresses  to  avoid  these  conflicts. 
 
4.

5. 
How to configure the  DHCP  server? 
(i) Assign  a  static  IP address  to the  DHCP server. 
(ii) Install the  DHCP  package by  # yum  install  dhcp*   -y    command. 
(iii) Open the  DHCP  configuration  file by  # vim   /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf   command.  This file is empty  
and we  have to copy the sample file from  /usr/share/doc/dhcp-4.25/dhcpd.conf.example  to  the 
above location by  # cp   -p   /usr/share/doc/dhcp-4.25/dhcpd.conf.example    /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf     
(iv) Now  open the above  DHCP  configuration file by  # vim   /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf    command. 
  
*   Go to line number   47  and  edit that line as below. 
  
subnet     <DHCP  server  Network  ID>     netmask     <subnetmask  of the this network>   { 
  
 
range    <starting  IP address><ending  IP address>; 
default-lease-time    600;  
 
(the minimum  lease  time to the client  in  seconds) 
max-lease-time    7200;  
 
 
(he maximum  lease  time to the client  in  seconds) 
  
} 
  
Example : 
  
subnet     172.25.0.0    netmask    255.255.255.0   { 
  
 
range    172.25.9.50    172.25.9.100; 
  
 
default-lease-time    600;

6. 
How to configure the  DHCP  client? 
(i) Change the  IP addressing  from  static to  dynamic if it is configured as  static. 
  
In  RHEL - 6 : 
  
# setup 
    Network  Configuration   ----->   Press Enter   ----->    Device  Configuration   ----->   Select  eth0    -----> 
 Press Enter  ---->   Select  Use  DHCP   ----->   Press  Spacebar   ----->   OK   ----->   Save   ----->Save & Quit 
  
   ----->   Quit 
  
# service  NetworkManager  restart 
  
# service  network  restart 
  
In  RHEL - 7: 
  
# nmcli  connection  modify  "System  eth0"   ipv4.method    auto  or  dynamic 
  
# nmcli  connection  down  "System  eth0" 
  
# nmcli  connection  up  "System  eth0" 
  
# systemctl  restart  network 
 (ii) Open   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0    file  and  edit  the  BOOTPROTO  line. 
  
# vim   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0  
  
  *   Go to  BOOTPROTO   line  and  edit that line as below. 
   BOOTPROTO=dhcp 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(save  and  exit  this  file) 
 (iii) Get the  IP address  from the  DHCP  server. 
  
# dhclient 
  
# ifdown  eth0 
  
# ifup  eth0 
 
7. 
How to fix the IP address to the client every time it requests  or  how to configure the  MAC   
          binding? 
The  process  of  assigning the same  IP address  (fixed  IP  address)  to  the  DHCP  client  every time  it  
booted  is  called  "MAC  binding". 
(i) Open the file   /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf by   # vim   /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf    command. 
  
*   Go to line  number   76  and  77  and  edit those lines as below. 
  
host   <dhcp  client  hostname>    { 
  
 
hardware  ethernet 
<MAC  address  of the  Client's  NIC  card>; 
  
 
fixed  addresses 
<IP  address>; 
  
} 
  
Example : 
  
host    client 1    { 
  
 
hardware   ethernet    2015:ac18::55; 
  
 
fixed  addresses    172.25.9.150; 
  
} 
 
   
(save  and  exit  this  file) 
(ii) Restart  the  DHCP services  in  RHEL - 6  and   RHEL - 7. 
  
# service  dhcpd  restart 
 
 
(to restart the  DHCP  service  in  RHEL - 6) 
  
# chkconfig  dhcpd  on  
       (to enable the  DHCP service at next boot  in  RHEL - 6) 
  
# systemctl  restart  dhcpd 
 
 
(to restart the  DHCP  service  in  RHEL - 7) 
  
# systemctl  enable  dhcpd 
       (to enable the  DHCP service at next boot  in  RHEL - 7) 
 *   Then  the above  MAC  address of the system will get the same  IP  address  every time it booted.

What is Web  server  and  explain  it? 
A Web server is a system that delivers content or services to end users over the Internet. A Web server 
consists  of a physical server, server operating system (OS) and software used to facilitate HTTP 
communication. A computer that runs a Web site. Using the HTTP protocol, the Web server delivers Web 
pages to browsers as well as other data files to Web-based applications. The Web server includes the 
hardware, operating system, Web server software, TCP/IP protocols and site content (Web pages, 
images and other files). If the Web server is used internally and is not exposed to the public, it is an 
"intranet server"  and if the Web server is used in the internet and is exposed to the public, it is an 
Internet server. 
 
2. 
What is Protocol? 
A uniform set of rules that enable two devices to connect and transmit the data to one another.  
Protocols determine how data are transmitted between computing devices  and  over networks.  They 
define issues such as error control  and  data compression methods. The protocol determines the 
following type of error checking  to be used,  data compression method  (if any),  how the sending device 
will indicate that it has finished a message and how the receiving device will indicate that it has received 
the message. Internet protocols  include  TCP/IP  (Transmission  Control  Protocol / Internet  Protocol),  
HTTP (Hyper  Text  Transfer  Protocol),  FTP (File  Transfer  Protocol)  and  SMTP (Simple  Mail  Transfer  
Protocol). 
 
3. 
How  a  Web server works? 
(i) If the user types an  URL  in his browsers address bar, the browser will splits  that  URL  into a number 
of separate parts  including  address,  path name  and  protocol. 
(ii) A  DNS  (Domain  Naming  Server) translates the domain name the user has entered into its  IP 
address,   a numeric combination that represents the site's  true address on the internet.  
(iii) The browser now determines which protocol  (rules and regulation which the client machine used to  
communicate with servers)  should be used.  For example  FTP (File Transfer Protocol)  and  HTTP (Hyper  
Text  Transfer Protocol). 
(iv)  The server sends  a  GET  request to the Web Server to retrieve the address it has been given.  For 
example  when a user types  http://www.example.com/Myphoto.jpg ,   the browser sends  a  GET 
Myphoto.jpg command to example.com  server  and  waits for a response.  The server now responds to 
the browser's  requests.  It verifies that the given address exist,  finds the necessary files,  runs the 
appropriate scripts,  exchanges  cookies if necessary  and  returns the results back to the browser.  If it 
cannot locate the file,  the server sends an error message to the client. 
(v)Then the browser translates the data it has been given into  HTML and displays the results to the user. 
 
4. 
In how many ways can we host the websites? 
 
IP based Web Hosting :  IP based web hosting is usedIP address  or  hostname web hosting. 
Name based Web Hosting : Hosting the multiple websites using single  IP address. Port based Web  
Hosting : Web hosting using another port number  ie., other than the default port number. 
 
User based Web Hosting : We can host the Web sites using the user name  and  password.

5. 
What is Apache Web Server? 
Apache is a open source web server.  It is mostly used web server in the internet. httpd  is the deamon 
that speaks the http  or  https  protocols. It is a text based protocol for sending and receiving the objects 
over a network connection. The http protocol  is sent over the wired network in clear text using default 
port number 80/tcp. To protect the website we can use https web server for data encryption. 
 
6. 
What is the profile for  Web server? 
Package  
: 
httpd 
script 
 
: 
/etc/init.d/httpd 
Deamon  
: 
httpd 
Configuration file : 
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf   (for  http) 
  
 
 
/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf   (for  https) 
Document  Root : 
/var/www/html 
Log  files  
: 
/var/log/httpd/access_log 
  
 
 
/var/log/httpd/error_log 
Port  Number 
: 
80/http  and  443/https 
*   If we want to configure the httpd server,  we have to follow the  ISET  rules. where  I - Install,  S - 
Start,    
 E - Enable    and     T - Test. 
 *   To access the websites using the  CLI mode  e-links,   curl  tools   are used  and  to access the 
websites using  the browser in  Linux Firefox  is used. 
 
7. 
How to make the http web server available to the cleint? 
(a)  First  assign the static  IP address  and  hostname  to the server. 
(b)  Check whether the server package  by   # rpm   -qa    httpd*    command. 
(c)   If not installed,  install the web server package by   # yum  install  httpd*   -y    command. 
(d)  Start the web server  and  enable web server service at next boot. 
  
# service  httpd  start  
 
 
(to start the webserver  deamon  in  RHEL - 6) 
  
# chkconfig  httpd  on  
 
     (to enable the service at next boot  in  RHEL - 6) 
  
# systemctl  restart  httpd 
 
         (to start the webserver  deamon  in  RHEL - 7) 
  
# systemctl  enable  httpd 
 
     (to enable the service at next boot  in  RHEL - 7) 
(e)  Open the browser  and  access the web server document. 
  
# firefox 
 
 
 
 
 
      (to open the  firefox  browser)  
  
*   Then  in address  bar type as  http://localhost/manual   and  press  Enter key. 
 
8. 
How to configure the IP based virtual host Web server? 
(a)  First  assign the static  IP address  and  hostname  to the server. 
(b)  Check whether the server package  by   # rpm   -qa    httpd*    command. 
(c)  If not installed,  install the web server package by   # yum  install  httpd*   -y    command. 
(d)  Check the configuration file to configure the http web server by   # rpm   -qac   httpd    command. 
(e)  If required open the web server document  by   # rpm   -qad   httpd   command. 
(f)  Go to the configuration file directory  by   # cd   /etc/httpd/conf.d

10. How to configure the port based web hosting? 
 (a) 
Make a directory for port based hosting. 
  
# mkdir   /var/www/port 
 (b) 
Go to the configuration file directory  by   # cd   /etc/httpd/conf.d 
 (c) 
Create the configuration for  port based hosting. 
  
# vim   /etc/httpd/conf.d/port.conf 
  
<VirtualHost    <IP address of the web server> : 8999> 
  
ServerAdmin   root@<hostname of the web server> 
  
ServerName    <port based hostname of the web server> 
  
DocumentRoot    /var/www/port 
  
 
</VirtualHost> 
 
  
 
<Directory    "/var/www/port"> 
  
AllowOverride   none 
  
Require  All  Granted  
 
  
</Directory> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(save  and  exit  this  file)

 (d) 
Go to port based virtual directory  and  create the index.html  file. 
  
# cd   /var/www/port 
  
# vim   index.html 
  
 
<html> 
  
 
 
<H1> 
  
 
 
 
This is Port  based Web Hosting 
  
 
 
</H1> 
  
 
</html> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (save  and  exit  this  file) 
 (e) Generally port based web hosting requires  DNS  server.  So, we can solve this problem by the 
following way. For that open the   /etc/hosts  file  enter the server name  and  IP addresses  on both 
server  and  client. 
  
 
# vim   /etc/hosts 
  
 
172.25.9.11 
port5.example.com 
 
  
 
 
(save  and  exit  this  file) 
(f)  By default the web server runs on port number  80.  If we want to configure on deferent port 
number,  we have to add the port number in the main configuration file. 
  
 
# vim   /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 
  
 
*   Go to  Listen : 80  line  and  open new line below this line  and  type as, 
  
 
Listen : 8999 
 
  
 
 
 
(save  and  exit  this  file) 
(g) By default SELinux will allow 80 and  8080 port numbers only for webserver.  If we use different port 
     numbers other than 80 or 8080 then execute the following command. 
  
 
# semanage   port   -a   -t   http_port_t   -p   tcp   8999 
 (h) Restart the web server deamon. 
      
# service  httpd  start  
 
         (to start the webserver  deamon  in  RHEL - 6) 
  
# chkconfig  httpd  on  
 
     (to enable the service at next boot  in  RHEL - 6) 
  
# systemctl  restart  httpd 
 
         (to start the webserver  deamon  in  RHEL - 7) 
  
# systemctl  enable  httpd 
 
     (to enable the service at next boot  in  RHEL - 7) 
 (i) 
Add the service to the IP tables  and  firewall. 
  
In  RHEL - 6 : 
  
# iptables    -A   INPUT   -i   eth0   -p   tcp   -m   tcp   --deport    8999  -j    ACCEPT 
  
# iptables    -A   OUTPUT   -i   eth0   -p   tcp   -m   tcp   --deport    8999  -j    ACCEPT 
  
# service  iptables  save 
  
# service  iptables  restart 
  
In  RHEL - 7 : 
  
# firewall-cmd    --permanent    --add-service=http 
  
# firewall-cmd    --permanent    -add-port=8999/tcp 
  
# firewall-cmd    --complete-reload                                                                                                                 
  (j) Go to client system,  open the  firefox  browser  and  type as  http://port9.example.com  in address     
       bar and check the index page is displayed  or  not. 
 (k) We can also access the website using  elinks  CLI tool. 
     
# yum  install  elinks*   -y 
 
 
 
 
(install the elinks  package) 
  
# elinks    --dump   port9.example.com  
 
 
 
(access the index page)

11. How to configure user authentication based web hosting? 
It will ask user name  and  password to access this website.  So, we have to provide  http  password. 
(f) Go to the configuration file directory  by   # cd   /etc/httpd/conf.d 
(g) Create the configuration for  user authentication based hosting. 
  
# vim   /etc/httpd/conf.d/userbase.conf 
  
<VirtualHost    <IP address of the web server> : 80> 
  
ServerAdmin   root@<hostname of the web server> 
  
ServerName    <hostname of the web server> 
  
DocumentRoot    /var/www/html

(i) 
Restart the web server deamon. 
 
 
# service  httpd  start  
 
         (to start the webserver  deamon  in  RHEL - 6) 
  
# chkconfig  httpd  on  
 
     (to enable the service at next boot  in  RHEL - 6) 
  
# systemctl  restart  httpd 
 
         (to start the webserver  deamon  in  RHEL - 7) 
  
# systemctl  enable  httpd 
 
     (to enable the service at next boot  in  RHEL - 7) 
 (j) 
Add the service to the IP tables  and  firewall. 
  
In  RHEL - 6 : 
  
# iptables    -A   INPUT   -i   eth0   -p   tcp   -m   tcp   --deport    80  -j    ACCEPT 
  
# iptables    -A   OUTPUT   -i   eth0   -p   tcp   -m   tcp   --deport    80  -j    ACCEPT 
  
# service  iptables  save 
  
# service  iptables  restart 
  
In  RHEL - 7 : 
  
# firewall-cmd    --permanent    --add-service=http 
  
# firewall-cmd    --complete-reload        
 (k) 
Create the user  and  assign the http  password. 
  
# useradd  kvreddi 
  
*   Don't  give the normal password because this user requires the http password. 
  
# htpasswd    -c m   /etc/httpd/pass   <user name> 
  
Example :   # htpasswd    -c m   /etc/httpd/pass     kvreddi 
  (l) 
Go to client system,  open the  firefox  browser  and  type as  http://server9.example.com  in 
address bar and check the index page is displayed  or  not.  Then it asks password, so we have to provide 
http password. 
 (m)We can also access the website using  elinks  CLI tool. 
  
# yum  install  elinks*   -y

16. How to configure the web server to display the user defined home page not the index.html page? 
 
Normally Apache will look the index.html  as the home page by default.  If the name changed it will 
display the home page without configure that one. For that we can do the above as follows. 
(i) 
Go to configuration file directory by   # cd   /etc/httpd/conf.d   command. 
(ii) 
Create a userpage configuration file. 
 
 # vim    userpage.conf 
 
 <VirtualHost     172.25.9.11:80> 
 
 ServerAdmin    root@server9.example.com 
 
 ServerName    server9.example.com 
 
 DocumentRoot    /var/www/html 
 
 DirectoryIndex    userpage.html 
 
  
</VirtualHost> 
 
  
 
 
  
<Directory    "/var/www/html"> 
 
  
AllowOverride  none 
 
  
Require   All   Granted 
 
  
</Directory> 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
     (save  and  exit  this  file) 
(iii) 
Go to document root directory by   # cd   /var/www/html    command. 
 
(iv) # vim   userpage.html 
 
  
<html> 
 
  
 
<H1> 
 
  
 
 
This is userpage as home page web hosting 
 
  
 
</H1> 
 
  
</html> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
     (save  and  exit  this  file) 
 
(d)            Restart the web server deamon. 
 
 # service  httpd  start  
 
 
         (to start the webserver  deamon  in  RHEL - 6)

17. How to configure  CGI  based web hosting? 
CGI  content will change dynamically every time the client accessed it. Normal web server will not be 
used to support this type of web hosting. To access these dynamic pages,  we have to configure the web 
server as  ".wsgi"  server. The following steps will configure the  CGI  web  server. 
 (a) 
Install the  CGI  package by   # yum  install  mod_wsgi*    -y   command. 
 (b) 
Download  or  create the  CGI  script file in  web server's  document root directory. 
  
 
Example :   # cp   webapp.wsgi      /var/www/html 
 (c) Create  the configuration file for  CGI  based web hosting. 
  
 
<VirtualHost    172.25.9.11:80> 
  
 
ServerAdmin    root@server9.example.com 
  
 
ServerName    webapp9.example.com 
  
 
DocumentRoot    /var/www/html 
  
 
WSGIScriptAlias     /     /var/www/html/webapp.wsgi 
  
 
</VirtualHost> 
 (d) 
Restart the web server deamon. 
  
# service  httpd  start  
 
         (to start the webserver  deamon  in  RHEL - 6) 
  
# chkconfig  httpd  on  
 
     (to enable the service at next boot  in  RHEL - 6) 
  
# systemctl  restart  httpd 
 
         (to start the webserver  deamon  in  RHEL - 7) 
  
# systemctl  enable  httpd 
 
     (to enable the service at next boot  in  RHEL - 7) 
 (e) 
Add the service to the IP tables  and  firewall. 
  
In  RHEL - 6 : 
  
# iptables    -A   INPUT   -i   eth0   -p   tcp   -m   tcp   --deport    80  -j    ACCEPT 
  
# iptables    -A   OUTPUT   -i   eth0   -p   tcp   -m   tcp   --deport    80  -j    ACCEPT 
  
# service  iptables  save 
  
# service  iptables  restart 
  
In  RHEL - 7 : 
  
# firewall-cmd    --permanent    --add-service=http 
  
# firewall-cmd    --complete-reload                                                                                                                 
  (f) 
Go to client system,  open the  firefox  browser  and  type as  http://webapp9.example.com in 
 address bar and  check the  CGI  based web page is displayed  or  not. 
 (g) 
We can also access the website using  elinks  CLI tool. 
  
# yum  install  elinks*   -y 
 
 
 
 
(install the elinks  package) 
  
# elinks    --dump   webapp9.example.com

18. What is secured web server? 
Secured web server means  normal  Apache web server with  SSL  support.  In normal web server the 
data communication is done in plain text format.  So,  there is no security for data because everyone can 
access the data. If we want to provide security to the data, then we have to configure the web server 
with  SSL support.   
 
19. What is the profile of secured web server?

Chapter#21 – Mail Server  
1. 
What is mail server? 
A mail server (sometimes also referred to an e-mail server) is a server that handles and delivers e-mail 
over a network, usually over the Internet. A mail server can receive e-mails from client computers and 
deliver them to other mail servers. A mail server can also deliver e-mails to client computers. A client 
computer is normally the computer where you read your e-mails, for example your computer at home or 
in your office. Also an advanced mobile phone or Smartphone, with e-mail capabilities, can be regarded 
as a client computer in these circumstances. 
 
 
2. 
How many types of mail servers available in Linux? 
There are two types of mail servers. 
    (i) 
Sendmail server  (default  in  RHEL - 5,  available in  6  and  7) 
 (ii) 
Postfix  (default  in  RHEL - 6  and  7) 
These both mail server are used to send  and  receive the mails,  but we cannot used both mail servers at 
a time ie., we have to use only one server at a time. These mail servers are used as  CLI  mode.  Outlook 
express in windows is used to send  or  receive the mails.  Thunderbird  is used to send  or  receive the 
mails using  GUI  mode in  Linux.  # mail   is the command used to send the mails in  CLI mode. 
 
3. 
What  are  MUA,  MTA,  SMTP,  MDA  and  MRAs? 
MUA : 
 MUA  stands for  Mail  User  Agent. It is the e-mail client which we used  to  create-draft-send  emails.  
Generally Microsoft  Outlook,  Thunderbird,  kmail, ....etc.,  are the examples  for  MUAs. 
 
MTA : 
 MTA  stands for  Mail  Transfer  Agent.  It is used to transfer the messages  and  mails  between  
senders  and  recipients.  Exchange,  Qmail,  Sendmail,  Postfix, ....etc.,  are the examples for  MTAs. 
 
SMTP: 
 SMTP  stands for  Simple  Mail  Transfer  Protocol.  It is used to transfer the messages  and  mails  
between  the MTAs.   
 
MDA : 
 MDA  stands for  Mail  Delivery  Agent.  It is a computer software component that is responsible for 
the delivery of e-mail messages to a local recipient's mailbox.  Within the Internet mail architecture, 
local message delivery is achieved through a process of handling messages from the message transfer 
agent, and storing mail into the recipient's environment (typically a mailbox). 
 
MRA : 
 MRA  stands for  Mail  Retrieval  Agent.  It is a computer application that retrieves or fetches e-
mail from a remote mail server and works with a mail delivery agent to deliver mail to a local or 
remote email mailbox. MRAs may be external applications by themselves or be built into a bigger 
application like an MUA. Significant examples of standalone MRAs 
include fetchmail, getmail and retchmail.

Chapter#22 – iSCSI (Remote Storage)  
1. 
What is storage? 
 
The memory where we can store the data, such as files,  directories, ...etc.,  is called the storage.  
Storage is mainly two types.   (i)  Local  storage   and   (ii)  Remote  Storage. 
(i) 
Local  storage : 
 
 Local  storage is a storage which is directly connected to our system  and  ready to use. 
 
 Example :  Local hard disk,  local pen drive,  DAS (Direct  Access  Storage) ... etc., 
(ii) 
Remote  storage : 
 
 The storage which is not connected to our system directly but allotted some space to our system in 
remote  location is called remote storage. 
 
 Example :  iSCSI  (Internet  Small  Computer  System  Interface),  SAN (Storage Area Network),  NAS 
(Network Area Storage) 
 
2. 
What is iSCSI  and  explain it? 
 
iSCSI is a way of connecting storage devices over a network using TCP/IP. It can be used over a local area 
network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or the Internet. 
 
iSCSI devices are disks, tapes, CDs, and other storage devices on another networked computer that you 
can connect to. Sometimes these storage devices are part of a network called a Storage Area 
Network (SAN). In the relationship between our computer and the storage device,  our computer is 
called an initiator because it initiates the connection to the device, which is called a target. 
 
iSCSI  provides Remote Block  or  File Storage.  Most data centers keep their storage in centralised  SAN  
racks. iSCSI  provides  an  inexpensive alternative  to  proprietary  SAN  hardware. 
 
3. 
What is the terminology  of iSCSI? 
 
iSCSI  supports sending  SCSI  commands from clients  (initiators)  over  IP  to SCSI  storage  devices   
          (targets)  on remote  systems  (servers).  iqn  is  a iSCSI  qualified name  or  number.   
 
The format of  iqn  is  "iqn.yyyy-mm.<domain  name  in  reverse  order>label is used to identify  initiators  
           And targets  communicate through  port number  3260. 
 
4. 
What is the profile of  iSCSI? 
 
Package : 
iscsi*  (for  RHEL-6),  target*  (for  RHEL-7 server)  and  iscsi-utils* (for  RHEL-7 Client) 
 
Configuration  files:/etc/tgt/target.conf (for  RHEL - 6) and   /etc/target/saveconfig.json  (for  RHEL - 7) 
 
Deamons  
:   tgtd  (for  RHEL-6) and  target  (for  RHEL-7 server)  and  iscsi,  iscsid  (for  RHEL-7) 
 
Port number 
: 
3260 
 
5. 
How to configure the  iSCSI  server? 
 
(i)        Create one partition  and  create the LVM with that partition. 
 
 # fdisk   <device name> 
 
    :  n (new  partition) --->  Enter  --->  Enter  --->  Enter  --->  +<size in  MB/GB/TB>   --->   w  (write the 
  
 
      changes into the disk) 
 
 # partprobe 
 
 
 
 
 
(to write the changes into the partition table) 
 
 # pvcreate   <disk partition name> 
 
 
 
(to create the physical volume) 
 
 # vgcreate   <physical volume name>  
 
 
(to create the volume group)

Chapter#23 – MySQl Server or MariaDB  
1. 
What is MySQL  or  MariaDB? 
MySQL  or  MariaDB  is  a  database software  to create  and  maintain the databases. 
Upto  RHEL - 6 the database software is MySQL  and  from  RHEL - 7 onwards  the database software is  
MariaDB. If we want to do any transactions  or  database operations,  we have to open the  mysql > or  
mariadb > prompt. In  MySQL  or  MariaDB  all the database operation commands will end with a  " ; "  
(semicolon).

Chapter#24 – Log Server and Log Files 
1. 
What is log server? 
A log server represents a central log monitoring point on a network, to which all kinds of devices 
including Linux or Windows servers, routers, switches or any other hosts can send their logs over 
network. By setting up a log server, you can filter and consolidate logs from different hosts and devices 
into a single location, so that you can view and archive important log messages more easily. 
On most Linux distributions, rsyslog is the standard syslog daemon that comes pre-installed. Configured 
in a client/server architecture, rsyslog can play both roles; as a syslog server rsyslog can gather logs 
from other devices, and as a syslog client, rsyslog can transmit its internal logs to a remote syslog 
server. When logs are collected with syslog mechanism, three important things must be taken into 
consideration:  
Facility level: what type of processes to monitor 
Severity (priority) level: what type of log messages to collect 
Destination: where to send or record log messages 
 
2.

Example : 
*.* @172.25.9.11:514  
 
 
 
(save  and  exit  this  file) 
(iii) 
Restart  the  log server deamons  in  RHEL - 6  and  RHEL - 7. 
  
# service   rsyslog   restart 
 
       (to restart the log server deamon  in  RHEL - 6)

# systemctl   restart  rsyslog 
 
       (to restart the log server deamon  in  RHEL - 7) 
 
5. 
What is log file? 
Log  file is file that contains messages about that system,  including the kernel, services  and  
applications running on it, ....etc.,  There are different log files for different information. These files are 
very useful when trying to troubleshoot a problem with systems.  
Almost all log messages are stored in  /var/log   directory.  Only root user can read these log messages. 
We can use less  or  more  commands to read these log files. The messages will be generated only when  
rsyslog  service is running,  otherwise the log messages will not be generated. 
 
 The different types of log files  and  their locations : 
 /var/log/messages   ----->   System  and  general  messages  and  DHCP log messages. 
 /var/log/authlog   ----->   Authentication log messages. 
 /var/log/secure   ----->   Security  and  authentication  and  user log messages. 
 /var/log/maillog   ----->   Mail server log messages. 
 /var/log/cron   ----->   Cron  jobs  log messages. 
 /var/log/boot.log   ----->   All booting log messages. 
 /var/log/httpd   ----->   All Apache web server log messages. 
 /var/log/mysqld.log   ----->   Mysql  database server log messages. 
 /var/log/utmp   or   /var/log/wtmp   ----->   All  the user's  login  messages. 
 /var/log/Qmail   ----->   Qmail  log messages. 
 /var/log/kernel.log   ----->   All kernel  related log messages.

 # tailf   or  # tail   -f   /var/log/secure  
 
(to check  or  watch the log files continuously) 
 # vim   /etc/rsyslog.conf 
 
         (we can change the log messages default destinations) 
 *   Whenever we change the  contents of the  /etc/rsyslog.conf  file, then we have to restart the 
rsyslog service. 
 *   There are  7 types of priority messages. We can change the default destination of those log files.  
For that open  rsyslog  server configuration file  and  we have enter the rules as follows. 
 # vim   /etc/rsyslog.conf 
 <priority  type> . <priority  name> 
<new  destination  of  the log files> 
(save  and  exit  this  file) 
 # logger    <type  any  text> 
 
(to send that text into  /var/log/messages  files  and  to test 
whether logging  service is running  or  not) 
 # logrotate 
 
 
 
(to create the log files with datewise) 
 *   Generally  in log messages  the fields  are, 
 Date  &  Time  :  From  which  system  :  command  name  or  change  :  Execution  of  the command 
 # yum  install  tmpwatch   -y 
 
                                                                (to install the  tmpwatchpackage  to execute the below  command) 
 # tmpwatch 
 
 
(to monitor the  /tmp   directory) 
 # logwatch 
 
 
 
(to monitor  the  log  messages) 
 # yum  install  watch   -y 
 
(to install the  watch  package to execute the below  command) 
 # watch   <command>  
(to watch the specified  command results continuously) 
 # mkdir   mode=755   /ram 
(to give the permissions to the directory while creating that directory) 
 # journalctl 
 
(it tracks all the log files between two different timings  and  save by default  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          in  /run/log   location) 
 *   /run/log  is mounted on  tmpfs  file system ie., if the system is rebooted the whole information in     
that  location will be deleted  or  erased..

Chapter#25 – Configuring IP tables and Firewalls 
 
1. 
What  are  IPtables  or  firewalls? 
IP tables is a command-line firewall utility that uses policy chains to allow or block traffic. When a 
connection tries to establish itself on your system, iptables looks for a rule in its list to match it to. If it 
doesn’t find one, it resorts to the default action. IP tables almost always comes pre-installed on any 
Linux distribution. We can  update/Reinstall  the IP tablespackage  by   # yum  install  iptables*   -y   
command. 
 
2. 
What are the types of firewalls? 
There are four types of firewalls. 
 
(i) Packet  firewalls : 
It works atPhysical,  Data  Link  and  Network  Layers. 
It works  fast  and  efficiently. 
It treats each packet in isolation. 
 
Statefull  firewalls : 
It  identifies  a  packets  connection state. 
It maintains  packets history in the state tables. 
 
(iii) Application  layer  firewalls : 
It  inspects  and  filter  packets  on  OSI  layer upto  Application Layer. 
It  identifies  if  protocols  are being  misused. 
 
(iv) Proxies  firewalls : 
It  acts as an intermediary. 
It  operates  at  Application Layer. 
It  won't  allow direct  connections. 
 
3. 
What  are the tables maintained by  IP tables? 
Normally  IP tables maintain  3  tables. 
 
(i) INPUT  table: 
      This chain handles all packets that are addressed to your server  and also to control the behaviour  
      For incoming connections. For example, if a user attempts to SSH into your PC/server, iptables  
      will  attempt to match the IP address and port to a rule in the input chain.  
 (ii) OUTPUT  table : 
      This chain contains rules for traffic created by your server. This chain is used for outgoing  
         connections.  
         For  example, if you try to ping google.com, iptables will check its output chain to see what the 
          rules are regarding ping and google.combefore making a decision to allow or deny the connection 
          attempt.

 (iii) FORWARD  table : 
This chain is used for incoming connections that aren’t actually being delivered locally. Think of a 
router – data is always being sent to it but rarely actually destined for the router itself; the data is 
just forwarded to its target. Unless you’re doing some kind of routing, NATing, or something else on 
your system that requires forwarding, you won’t even use this chain.This chain is used to deal with 
traffic destined for other servers that are not created on your server. This chain is basically a way to 
configure your server to route requests to other machines. 
 
4. 
What are the meanings  of  REJECT,  DROP  and  ACCEPT ? 
 
REJECT : 
 
REJECT  means  server receives the  FTP  request  from the specified  IP address  and  rejects  that   
          request  and also  send the  acknowledgement. 
 
 
DROP : 
 
DROP  means  server receives  the  FTP requests  from the specified  IP address  and  drop the request 
          without sending any acknowledgement. 
 
 
            ACCEPT : 
 
  ACCEPT  means  server  receives the  FTP  requests  from the specified  IP address  and  allow that  
            system for  FTP  services. 
 
5. 
What is the configuration file of  IP tables  and  what are the options available in IP tables  
          command? 
 
/etc/sysconfig/iptables   is the configuration file of  IP tables. 
 
# iptables    <options><chain>   firewall-rule 
 
 
 
    (to execute the  IP tables) 
 
The  options  are  as  follows. 
 
 -A   ----->   Add  or  append  the rule. 
 
 -p   ----->   Indicates the protocol  for that rule  (tcp,  udp,  icmp, ....etc.;). 
 
 -s   ----->   Indicates the source of the packet  (IP address,  Network ID  or  Hostname). 
 
 -d  ----->Indicates the destination of the packet. 
 
 -j   ----->   'Jump  to  target'   indicates  the interface through which the incoming packets are coming  
                               through the  INPUT ,  FORWARD  and  PREROOTING  chain. 
 
 -o  ----->   'Output  Interface'   indicates  the interface through which the outgoing packets are sent  
                                through the  INPUT,  FORWARD  and  PREROOTING  chain. 
 
 -sport  or  -source-port   ----->   Source port  for  -p   tcp  or  -p  udp. 
 
 -dport  or  -destination-port   ----->   Destination  port  for   -p   tcp  or   -p  udp. 
 
6. 
How to allow a ping from  outside  to  inside  and  inside  to  outside? 
 
# iptables    -A   INPUT   -p   icmp    --icmp-type   echo-request    -j    ACCEPT 
 
# iptables    -A   OUTPUT   -p   icmp    --icmp-type   echo-reply    -j    ACCEPT 
 
# iptables    -A   OUTPUT   -p   icmp    --icmp-type   echo-request    -j    ACCEPT 
 
# iptables    -A   INPUT   -p   icmp    --icmp-type   echo-reply    -j    ACCEPT 
 
7. 
In how many ways can we protect the network? 
 
There are  4 ways to protect the network.

(i) SELinux 
 
(ii) IP tables 
 
(iii) Firewalld 
 
(iv) TCP  wrappers 
 
IP tables  and  firewalld both are used to protect our systems services from outside.  But  we can use only 
one way at a time.  
 
8. 
How to configure the firewalld? 
 
(i) 
Install the firewalld package by  # yum  install  firewalld*    -y   command. 
 
(ii) Check whether the firewalld  package is installed  or  not  by  # rpm   -qa   firewalld   command. 
 
(iii) Check the status of the firewalld  by executing the below  commands. 
 
# systemctl  status firewalld   or   # firewall-cmd     --status 
 
 
           Examples  of  IP tables  commands : 
 
# service  iptables  status  
 
 
 
 
 
 (to check the  IP tables  status) 
 
# service  iptables  start  
 
 
 
 
 
 
(to start the IP tables) 
 
# service  iptables  stop  
 
 
 
 
 
 
(to stop the IP tables) 
 
# service  iptables  restart 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(to restart the IP tables) 
 
# service  iptables  save  
 
 
 
         (to save the iptable rules permanently)

Chapter#26 – TCP Wrappers 
1.    Firewalld  will protect all the services. 
 *   TCP WRAPPER  will also protect the services,  but it can support for only limited services. And it can 
protect  the services  which are having the   libwrap.so  module is loaded for that service. 
 *   So,  TCPWRAPPER  does not support to protect all the services except   libwrap.so  module loaded. 
 # ldd 
 
      (this command is used to check the modules which are loaded for this services) 
 # ldd   <service  name  with  full  path> (to display all the loaded modules of the specified service)  
 # ldd   /usr/sbin/sshd  
 
      (to display all the loaded modules of the  sshd  service) 
 # ldd   /usr/sbin/sshd  | grep   -i   libwrap.so 
(to check whether  libwrap.so  module is loaded  or  not) 
 
2. 
To configure the  TCPWRAPPER : 
(i) Open  /etc/hosts.deny   or   /etc/hosts.allow  file  by   # vim   /etc/hosts.deny  or  hosts.allow  
commands. 
* The above files are to be edited  or  modified  to enable  or  disable  the  tcpwrapper  services the 
users. 
# vim   /etc/hosts.deny       
(Go to last line and  type as below) 
 sshd  :  172.25.9.11   or  system9.example.com 
(to deny  the  specified host or hostname) 
 
 
sshd  :  ALL 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(to deny all the clients) 
 
 
sshd  :  ALL  EXCEPT    *.eample.com  
 
   (to deny all the clients  except  
all the systems of example.com domain) 
 
(ii) 
save  and  exit  this  file. 
 
(iii) Open  /etc/hosts.allow  by   # vim   /etc/hosts.allow   command  and  go to last line and 
type as below. 
 
 
 sshd  :  172.25.9.11   172.25.6.11 
 
             (to  allow  2 systems  only) 
 
(iv) save  and  exit  this  file. 
 
*   If the client system's  entry is there in  both  /etc/hosts.deny  and   /etc/hosts.allow  files,  
then the  
TCPWRAPPER  will  look  /etc/hosts.allow  file  first.  Then it will look  /etc/hosts.deny  file.  If there is 
an  entry in both the files,  then it will allow the system because based on the above rule first  it will 
read    /etc/hosts.allow  file  and  allow the system.  It won't   read the   /etc/hosts.deny   file.

Chapter#27 – Virtualization  
1. 
What is virtualization? 
Virtualization allows multiple operating system instances to run concurrently on a single computer;it is a 
means  of separating hardware from a single operating system. Each “guest” OS is managed bya 
Virtual Machine  Monitor (VMM), also known as a hypervisor. Because the virtualization system 
sitsbetween the guest and the  hardware, it can control the guests’ use of CPU, memory, and 
storage,even allowing a guest OS to migrate from  
one machine to another.

Chapter#28 – RedHat Cluster  
1. 
How can you define a cluster and what are its basic types? 
 A cluster is two or more computers (called nodes or members) that work together to perform a task. 
There are four major types of clusters: 
Storage 
 High availability 
 Load balancing 
High performance 
 
2. 
What is Storage Cluster? 
Storage clusters provide a consistent file system image across servers in a cluster, allowing the servers to 
simultaneously read and write to a single shared file system.  
A storage cluster simplifies storage administration by limiting the installation and patching of 
applications to one file system.  
The High Availability Add-On provides storage clustering in conjunction with Red Hat GFS2 
 
3. 
What is High Availability Cluster? 
High availability clusters provide highly available services by eliminating single points of failureand by 
failing over services from one cluster node to another in case a node becomes inoperative.  
Typically, services in a high availability cluster read and write data (via read-write mounted file 
systems).  
A high availability cluster must maintain data integrity as one cluster node takes over control of a 
service from another cluster node.  
Node failures in a high availability cluster are not visible from clients outside the cluster.  
High availability clusters are sometimes referred to as failover clusters. 
 
4. 
What is Load Balancing Cluster? 
Load-balancing clusters dispatch network service requests to multiple cluster nodes to balance the 
request load among the cluster nodes.  
Load balancing provides cost-effective scalability because you can match the number of nodes according 
to load requirements. If a node in a load-balancing cluster becomes inoperative, the load-balancing 
software detects the failure and redirects requests to other cluster nodes.  
Node failures in a load-balancing cluster are not visible from clients outside the cluster.  
Load balancing is available with the Load Balancer Add-On. 
 
5. 
What is a High Performance Cluster? 
High-performance clusters use cluster nodes to perform concurrent calculations.  
A high-performance cluster allows applications to work in parallel, therefore enhancing the performance 
of the applications. High performance clusters are also referred to as computational clusters or grid 
computing. 
 
6. 
How many nodes are supported in Red hat 6 Cluster? 

SUVEN IT        Linux Administration       -An Admin Choice
 
 
 
 
SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|173 
 
 
 
A cluster configured with qdiskd supports a maximum of 16 nodes. The reason for the limit is because of 
 
scalability; increasing the node count increases the amount of synchronous I/O contention on the shared 
 
quorum disk device. 
 
7. 
What is the minimum size of the Quorum Disk? 
 
The minimum size of the block device is 10 Megabytes. 
 
8. 
What is the order in which you will start the Red Hat Cluster services? 
 
In Red Hat 4 : 
 
# service ccsd start 
 
# service cman start 
 
# service fenced start 
 
service clvmd start (If CLVM has been used to create clustered volumes) 
 
# service gfs start 
 
# service rgmanager start 
 
In RedHat 5 : 
 
# service cman start 
 
# service clvmd start 
 
# service gfs start 
 
# service rgmanager start 
 
In Red Hat 6 : 
 
# service cman start 
 
# service clvmd start 
 
# service gfs2 start 
 
# service rgmanager start 
 
9. 
What is the order to stop the Red Hat Cluster services? 
 
In Red Hat 4 : 
 
# service rgmanager stop 
 
# service gfs stop 
 
# service clvmd stop 
 
# service fenced stop 
 
# service cmanstop 
 
# service ccsd stop 
 
In Red Hat 5 : 
 
# service rgmanager stop 
 
# servicegfsstop 
 
# service clvmd stop 
 
# servicecman stop 
 
In Red Hat 6 : 
 
# service rgmanagerstop 
 
# service gfs2 stop 
 
# service clvmdstop 
 
# service cman stop

10. What are the performance enhancements in GFS2 as compared to GFS? 
Better performance for heavy usage in a single directory 
Faster synchronous I/O operations 
Faster cached reads (no locking overhead) 
Faster direct I/O with preallocated files (provided I/O size is reasonably large, such as 4M blocks) 
Faster I/O operations in general 
Faster Execution of the df command, because of faster statfs calls 
Improved atime mode to reduce the number of write I/O operations generated by atime when 
compared with GFS 
GFS2 supports the following features. 
extended file attributes (xattr) 
the lsattr() and chattr() attribute settings via standard ioctl() calls 
nanosecond timestamps 
GFS2 uses less kernel memory. 
GFS2 requires no metadata generation numbers. 
Allocating GFS2 metadata does not require reads. Copies of metadata blocks in multiple journals are 
managed by revoking blocks from the journal before lock release. 
GFS2 includes a much simpler log manager that knows nothing about unlinked inodes or quota changes. 
The gfs2_grow and gfs2_jadd commands use locking to prevent multiple instances running at the same 
time. 
The ACL code has been simplified for calls like creat() and mkdir(). 
Unlinked inodes, quota changes, and statfs changes are recovered without remounting the journal. 
 
11. What is the maximum file system support size for GFS2? 
GFS2 is based on 64 bit architecture, which can theoretically accommodate an 8 EB file system.  
However, the current supported maximum size of a GFS2 file system for 64-bit hardware is 100 TB.  
The current supported maximum size of a GFS2 file system for 32-bit hardware for Red Hat Enterprise 
Linux Release 5.3 and later is 16 TB.  
NOTE: It is better to have 10 1TB file systems than one 10TB file system. 
 
12. What is the journaling filesystem? 
A journaling filesystem is a filesystem that maintains a special file called a journal that is used to repair 
any inconsistencies that occur as the result of an improper shutdown of a computer. 
In journaling file systems, every time GFS2 writes metadata, the metadata is committed to the journal 
before it is put into place.  
This ensures that if the system crashes or loses power, you will recover all of the metadata when the 
journal is automatically replayed at mount time. 
GFS2 requires one journal for each node in the cluster that needs to mount the file system. For example, 
if you have a 16-node cluster but need to mount only the file system from two nodes, you need only two 
journals. If you need to mount from a third node, you can always add a journal with the gfs2_jadd 
command. 
 
13. What is the default size of journals in GFS? 
When you run mkfs.gfs2 without the size attribute for journal to create a GFS2 partition, by default a 
128MB sizejournal is created which is enough for most of the applications 

SUVEN IT        Linux Administration       -An Admin Choice
 
 
 
 
SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|175 
 
 
In case you plan on reducing the size of the journal, it can severely affect the performance. Suppose you 
reduce the size of the journal to 32MB it does not take much file system activity to fill an 32MB journal, 
and when the journal is full, performance slows because GFS2 has to wait for writes to the storage. 
 
14. What is a Quorum Disk? 
Quorum Disk is a disk-based quorum daemon, qdiskd, that provides supplemental heuristics to 
determine node fitness. 
With heuristics you can determine factors that are important to the operation of the node in the event 
of a network partition 
 For a 3 node cluster a quorum state is present until 2 of the 3 nodes are active i.e. more than half. But 
what if  due to some reasons the 2nd node also stops communicating with the 3rd node? In that case 
under a  normal architecture the cluster would dissolve and stop working. But for mission critical 
environments and such  scenarios we use quorum disk in which an additional disk is configured which is 
mounted on all the nodes with  qdiskd service running and a vote value is assigned to it. 
 So suppose in above case I have assigned 1 vote to qdisk so even after 2 nodes stops communicating 
with 3rd  node, the cluster would have 2 votes (1 qdisk + 1 from 3rd node) which is still more than half of 
vote count for a  3 node cluster. Now both the inactive nodes would be fenced and your 3rd node would 
be still up and running  being a part of the cluster. 
 
15. What is rgmanager in Red Hat Cluster and its use? 
This is a service termed as Resource Group Manager 
RGManager manages and provides failover capabilities for collections of cluster resources called 
services, resource groups, or resource trees 
it allows administrators to define, configure, and monitor cluster services. In the event of a node failure, 
rgmanager will relocate the clustered service to another node with minimal service disruption. 
 
16. What is luci and ricci in Red Hat Cluster? 
luci is the server component of the Conga administration utility 
Conga is an integrated set of software components that provides centralized configuration and 
management of Red Hat clusters and storage 
luci is a server that runs on one computer and communicates with multiple clusters and computers via 
ricci 
 
ricci is the client component of the Conga administration utility 
ricci is an agent that runs on each computer (either a cluster member or a standalone computer) 
managed by Conga 
This service needs to be running on all the client nodes of the cluster. 
 
 
17. What is cman in Red Hat Cluster? 
This is an abbreviation used for Cluster Manager.  
CMAN is a distributed cluster manager and runs in each cluster node.  
It is responsible for monitoring, heartbeat, quorum, voting and communication between cluster nodes. 
CMAN keeps track of cluster quorum by monitoring the count of cluster nodes.

19. How does NetworkManager service affects Red Hat Cluster? 
The use of NetworkManager is not supported on cluster nodes. If you have installed NetworkManager 
on your cluster nodes, you should either remove it or disable it. 
# service NetworkManager stop 
# chkconfig NetworkManager off 
The cman service will not start if NetworkManager is either running or has been configured to run with 
the chkconfig command 
 
20. What is the command used to relocate a service to another node? 
# clusvcadm -r service_name -m node_name 
 
21. What is split-brain condition in Red Hat Cluster? 
We say a cluster has quorum if a majority of nodes are alive, communicating, and agree on the active 
cluster members. For example, in a thirteen-node cluster, quorum is only reached if seven or more nodes 
are communicating. If the seventh node dies, the cluster loses quorum and can no longer function. 
A cluster must maintain quorum to prevent split-brain issues. 
 
If quorum was not enforced, quorum, a communication error on that same thirteen-node cluster may 
cause a situation where six nodes are operating on the shared storage, while another six nodes are also 
operating on it, independently. Because of the communication error, the two partial-clusters would 
overwrite areas of the disk and corrupt the file system. 
With quorum rules enforced, only one of the partial clusters can use the shared storage, thus protecting 
data integrity. 
Quorum doesn't prevent split-brain situations, but it does decide who is dominant and allowed to 
function in the cluster. 
quorum can be determined by a combination of communicating messages via Ethernet and through a 
quorum disk. 
 
 
22. What are Tie-breakers in Red Hat Cluster? 
Tie-breakers are additional heuristics that allow a cluster partition to decide whether or not it is quorate 
in the event of an even-split - prior to fencing.  
With such a tie-breaker, nodes not only monitor each other, but also an upstream router that is on the 
same path as cluster communications. If the two nodes lose contact with each other, the one that wins

SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|177 
 
 
is the one that can still ping the upstream router.That is why, even when using tie-breakers, it is 
important to ensure that fencing is configured correctly. 
CMAN has no internal tie-breakers for various reasons. However, tie-breakers can be implemented using 
the API. 
 
23. What is fencing in Red Hat Cluster? 
Fencing is the disconnection of a node from the cluster's shared storage.  
Fencing cuts off I/O from shared storage, thus ensuring data integrity.  
The cluster infrastructure performs fencing through the fence daemon, fenced. 
When CMAN determines that a node has failed, it communicates to other cluster-infrastructure 
components that the node has failed.  
fenced, when notified of the failure, fences the failed node.  
 
24. What are the various types of fencing supported by High Availability Add On? 
 
Power fencing — A fencing method that uses a power controller to power off an inoperable node. 
 
storage fencing — A fencing method that disables the Fibre Channel port that connects storage to 
                                          an inoperable node. 
 
Other fencing — Several other fencing methods that disable I/O or power of an inoperable  
                                          node, including IBM Bladecenters, PAP, DRAC/MC, HP ILO, IPMI, IBM RSA II,  
                                          and others. 
 
25. What are the lock states in Red Hat Cluster? 
 
A lock state indicates the current status of a lock request. A lock is always in one of three states: 
 
 
Granted — The lock request succeeded and attained the requested mode. 
 
 
Converting — A client attempted to change the lock mode and the new mode is incompatible with  
                                    an existing lock. 
 
 
Blocked — The request for a new lock could not be granted because conflicting locks exist. 
 
A lock's state is determined by its requested mode and the modes of the other locks on the \ 
          same resource. 
 
26. What is DLM lock model? 
DLM is a short abbreviation for Distributed Lock Manager. 
A lock manager is a traffic cop who controls access to resources in the cluster, such as access to a GFS 
file system.GFS2 uses locks from the lock manager to synchronize access to file system metadata (on 
shared storage) CLVM uses locks from the lock manager to synchronize updates to LVM volumes and 
volume groups (also on shared storage)In addition, rgmanager uses DLM to synchronize service states. 
without a lock manager, there would be no control over access to your shared storage, and the nodes in 
the cluster would corrupt each other's data.

Chapter#29 – Kickstart Installation  
 
1. 
What is  Kickstart installation? 
Installation of  RedHat  Linux in  non-interactive mode is called the Kickstart installation. 
Many system administrators would prefer to use an automated installation method to install  RedHat  
Enterprise  Linux on their machines. Using kickstart, a system administrator can create a single file 
containing the answer to all the questions that would normally asked during a typical installation. 
 
Kickstart files can be kept on a single server system and read by individual computers during the 
installation. This installation method can support the use of a single kickstart file to install RedHat  
Enterprise  Linux on multiple machines, making it ideal for network and system administrators.

What is  PXE  installation  and  what are it's  requirements? 
 
Automatic  Installation of  RHEL from the Network  is called  PXE  installation.  
          This is also called as  un-attended  
 
installation. The means  nobody interaction is required in the installation process. 
 
PXE  stands  for  Pre Execution.  The PXE does not requires  a  RHEL DVD  or  any boot.iso  image. 
 
 
         The requirements  for  PXE server : 
(i) Static  network  at server side. 
 
(ii)  DHCP server should be configured on the server. 
(ii) 
FTP server should be configured on the server.

Chapter#30 – Server Performance  
 
Examples of  top  command 
top is one of the tool for monitoring system usage and also to make any change for improving 
system performance. 
Introduction: 
The  top  program  provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system.  It can display system 
summary information as well as a list of tasks currently being managed by the Linux kernel.  The types of 
system summary information shown and the types, order and size of information displayed for tasks are 
all user configurable and that  configuration can be made persistent across restarts.

Generally we use top without any arguments, but the magic is mostly done from the top command line 
which must of us skip. Well before taking you to that part let me explain you the various system related  
features which  are shown by top command. 
 
NOTE: You can enable or disable the marked blue line by pressing "l" once top is running.

(ii)  If the situation is emergency, then we will call the data centre by phone. 
 
(iii) If the situation is non - emergency  then we will mail to the data centre people. 
 
19. What is server hardening? 
 
(i)   To checking our system is reaching to standards required by the organization. 
 
(ii)  That is minimum password length, minimum size of root partition. 
 
(iii) Minimum free space and password expiry and all other security standards. 
 
20. What are decommission and recommission? 
 
(i)   Normally servers should be changed every 5 - 6 years because of performance degradation as 
           per standards of the company. 
  
(ii) Decommission  means  the process  of  removing the old system  from the production environment          
and Recommission  means  the process  of  putting  the new system  into the production  environment. 
 
(iii) We are not dedicated for decommission.  We do decommission along with our routine work. 
 
(iv) Login as root though console. 
 
(v) First inform or raise the ticket to monitoring team to ignore the alerts. 
 
(vi) Stop the application and databases. 
 
(vii) Stop the cluster and Volume Manager. 
 
(viii) Unmount the file system. 
 
(ix) After that we should put the system for one week. 
 
(x) We will inform or raise the ticket to the network team to release the ports belonging to that system. 
 
(xi) Finally we inform to the data centre people to remove the cables from that system.  
 
21. Explain backup and what is your backup policy? 
(i)   Backup means taking a copy of the existing system and restore when the system is formatted  or  
crashed. 
 
 
(ii)  In backup environment normally we have 3 servers. 
 
 (a)  Master Server  (1  or  2  systems). 
 
 (b)  Media Server   (1  or  2  systems). 
 
 (c)  Client Server     (1  or  2  systems). 
 
 
          (iii) In our organization we used to take the backup in Media Server. 
 
(iv) Backup fails means production server may down or media server may be in down, file system may 
not be available or backup tool port number may be blocked. 
 
 
(v)  Backup can be taken in 3 types. 
 
 (a)  Application Backup (Application people will take). 
 
 (b)  File system  (O/S) backup  (System Administrators will take). 
 
 (c)  Database backup  (Database Administrators will take). 
 
 
(vi) Backup is automated though crontab or separate backup tools like Veritas Net backup and  
          Tivoli,    ....etc., 
 

SUVEN IT        Linux Administration       -An Admin Choice
 
 
 
 
SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|198 
 
 
(x) 
The crontab will not inform the failed backup. But Veritas Net backup and Tivoli tools will  
 send messages  about backup fails and why the backup is failed because these tools will generate the 
failed backup log files. 
 
(viii) If any files are open in the production server, the backup may be failed. So, check any files opened 
or not by  # lsof  or  # fuser   -cv    <file system>  commands. 
 
(ix)  Sometimes the script in Veritas Net backup or Tivoli  tools may be corrupted  or  not running, then 
restore  those scripts from backup  or  we need manually deport & import and take backup. 
 
(x)  Sometimes backup failed due to backup port no.  13782  may be not working or in blocked state. It 
can be   checked by   # netstat   -ntulp | grep  13782   command. 
 
(xi)  If the media server and production server are not in the same domain, then backup may be failed. 
(ie., production server domain name may be changed but no intimation to backup team about that 
change, so   media server is in another domain).  
 
 
Backup Procedure : 
 
 (i)   Deport the disk group on production server. 
 
 (ii)  Import the disk group on backup (media) server. 
 
 (iii) Join the disk group with media server. 
 
 (iv) Sync the data with production server. 
 
 (v)  Take the backup. 
 
 (vi) split the disk group from media server. 
 
 (vii) Join the disk group with production server. 
 
 (viii) Deport the disk group from media server. 
 
 (ix)  Import the disk group on production server. 
Backup policy : 
 
 (i)   Complete  (full)  backup  (every month ie., once in a month). 
 
 (ii)  Incremental backup   (Daily). 
 
 (iii) Differential   or   cumulative backup   (every week end). 
 
22. How to troubleshoot if the file system is full? 
 
(i)   First check whether the file system is O/S  or other than O/S. 
 
 
(ii)  If it is other than O/S, then inform to that respective teams to house keep the file system 
          (ie., remove the unnecessary files in those file system). 
 
 
(iii) If not possible to house keep then inform to different teams (raise the CRQ (Change Request)) 
           for increasing the file system. 
(a) 
 First take business approval and raise the CRQ to monitoring team to ignore the alerts from  
        the system,  stop the application team to stop the application and database team to stop 
        the   database. 
 
     (b)  Normally team lead  or  tech lead  or  manager  will do this by initiate the mail thread. 
 
      (c)  We will do this on weekend to reduce the business impact.

(iv)  First take a backup of the file system then unmount the file system. 
 
 
(v)  Remove that partition and again create that file system with increased size, then mount again 
           that file system and restore the backup. 
 
(vi) If the file system belongs to system log files or other log files and not to delete then they requested 
us to provide one Repository server (only for log files). Normally one script will do automatically redirect 
the log files to that repository server. 
 
 
           (vii) Sometimes we will delete file contents not the files to reduce the file sizes. For that we execute the 
 
 command  # cat   /dev/null   ><file name with path>  ie., nullifying the files. 
 
 
           (ix)  If it is root file system  or  O/S  file system, 
 
   (a)  may be  /opt   full    or    may be  /var   full     or    may be  /tmp  full  
 
 (b) In  /var/log/secure  or  /var/log/system  or  /var/tmp    files may be full. If those files are 
important then redirect them to other central repository server  or  backup those files and nullifying 
those files. 
(c)  If   /home   directory is present in  root ( / )  file system then this file system full will occur.    
Generally /home  will be separated from root file system and created as separate  /home  file system. 
If /home  is in root ( / ) as a directory then create a separate file system for  /home  and copy those 
files   and directories belongs to  /home  and remove that    /home  directory. 
(d)  If root ( / )  is full then cannot login to the system. So, boot with net  or  CDROM in single user 
mode and  do the above said.  
(x)  Normally if file system is other than O/S  then we will inform to that respective manager or owner 
and take the permissions to remove unnecessary files through verbal permission  or  CRQ . 
 
23. CPU utilization full, how to troubleshoot it? 
 
(a)   Normally we get these scenarios on weekends because backup team will take heavy backups. 
 
(b)   First check which processes are using more CPU utilization by  # top  and take a snap shot of  
                  that user processes and send the snap shot and inform to that user to kill the unnecessary process. 
(b) If those processes are backups then inform to the backup team to reduce the backups by  
stopping some backups to reduce the CPU utilization. 
(c) Sometimes in peak stages  (peak hours means having business hours) CPU utilization will full and  
get back to the normal position automatically after some time (within seconds). But ticket raised by 
monitoring team. So, we have to take a snap shot of that peak stage and attach that snap shot to 
the raised ticket and close  that ticket. 
(d) Sometimes if heavy applications are running and not to kill (ie., business applications), then if  
any spare  
processor is available or other low load CPUs available then move those heavy 
application processes to those CPUs. 
(e) If CPUs are also not available then if the system supports another CPU then inform to the data  
centre people  or  CPU vendor to purchase new CPU though Business approval and move some 
processes to the newly purchased CPUs. 
 
24. How to troubleshoot when the system is slow? 
 
(a)  System slow means the end users response is slow.

SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|200 
 
 
 
(b)  Check the Application file system, CPU utilization, memory utilization and O/S  file system utilization. 
 
(c) If all are ok, then check network statistics and interfaces whether the interfaces are running in  
                full duplex mode or half duplex mode and check whether the packets are missing. If all are ok from  
                  our side then, 
 
(d) Inform to network team and other respective teams to solve this issue. 
 
25. How to troubleshoot if the node is down? 
 
(a)   Check pinging the system. If pinging, then check whether the system is in single user mode or not. 
 
(b)   If the system is in single user mode then put the system in multi user mode ie., default run level by 
 
  
confirming with our team whether system is under maintenance or not. 
 
(c)   Check in which run level the system is running. If it is in init 1 it will not be able to ping. 
                  If it is in init s then it will ping. 
 
(d)  In this situation also if it is not pinging then try to login through console port. If not possible  
                 then inform to data centres people to hard boot the system. 
 
(d)  If connected through console port then we may get the console prompt. 
 
26. How to troubleshoot if the memory utilization full? 
 
(a)  Check how much memory is installed in the system by  # dmidecode   -t  memory   command. 
 
(b)  Check the memory utilization by  # vmstat   -v   command. 
(c)   Normally application or heavy backups utilize more memory. So, inform to application team  or    
backup team  
or  other teams which team is utilizing the more memory to reduce the processes by 
killing them or pause 
them. 
 
(d)  Try to kill  or  disable  or  stop the unnecessary services. 
(e)  If all the ways are not possible then inform to team lead  or tech lead  or  manager to increase the 
memory (swap space). If it is also not possible then taking higher authority's  permissions to increase the 
physical memory. For those we contact the server vendor  and co-ordinate with them through data 
centre people to increase the RAM size. 
 
27. How to replace the failed hard disk? 
 
(a)  Check whether the disk is failed or not by   # iostat     -En | grep    -i   hard/soft    command. 
 
(b)  If hard errors are above 20 then we will go for replacement of the disk. 
 
(c)  If the disk is from SAN people then we will inform to them about the replacement of the disk.  
           If it is internal disk then we raise the CRQ to replace the disk. 
 
(d)  For this we will considered  two things. 
 
 (i)   whether the system is within the warranty. 
 
 (ii)  without warranty. 
(f) We will directly call to the toll  free no. of the system vendor and raise the ticket. They will issue  
the case no. This is the no. we have to mention in all correspondences to vendor regarding this issue. 
(g) If it is having warranty they asks rack no.  system no.  and other details and replace the hard  
disk with co-ordinate of the data centre people. 
(h) If it is not having warranty, we have to solve the problem by our own  or  re-agreement to extend 
the warranty and solve that problem. 
 
28. How to replace the processor? 
 
(a) Check the processor's status using   # lscpu    or   # dmidecode    -t   processor   commands.

SUVEN IT, Edition NJ (USA) & Hyderabad(India), :info@suvenit.com, www.suvenit.com   pg|201 
 
 
 
(b) If it shows any errors then we have to replace the processor. 
 
(c) Then raise the case to vendor by toll free no. with higher authorities permission. 
 
(d) The vendor will give case no. for future references. 
 
(e) They also asks rack no.    system  no.  of the data centre for processor replacement. 
 
(f) We will inform to the Data centre people to co-ordinate with vendor. 
 
29. How replace the failed memory modules? 
 
Causes : 
 
 (a)  The system is continuously  rebooting . 
 
 (b)  When in peak business hours, if the heavy applications are running the system get panic 
               and rebooted.   This is repeating regularly. 
 
Solution : 
 
 (a)  First we check how much RAM present in the system with  # dmidecode    -t    memory   command. 
 
 (b)  Then we raise the case to vendor with the help of higher authorities. 
 
 (c)  Then the vendors will provide the case no. for future reference. 
 
 (d)  They will also asks rack no.   system no.  to replace the memory. 
 
 (e) we will inform the data centre people to co-ordinate with the vendor. 
 
30. What is your role in DB patching? 
 
In Database patching the following teams will be involved. 
 
 (i)   Database Administrator (DBA) team. 
 
 
 (ii)  Linux Administrators team. 
 
 (iii) Monitoring team. 
 
 (iv) Application team. 
 
 
(i) 
DBA team : 
 
 This is the team to apply the patches to the databases. 
 
 
(ii)  Linux team : 
This team is also involved if any problems occur. If the database volume is having a mirror we should 
first break the mirror and then the DBA people will apply the patches. After  1  or  2  days there is no 
problem again we need sync the data between mirrored volume to patch applied volume. If there is 
no space for  patch we have to provide space to DBA team. 
 
 
(iii)  Monitoring team : 
This team should receive requests or suggestions to ignore any problems occurs. After applied the 
patch if the system is automatically rebooted then monitoring team will raise the ticket "Node 
down"  to system  
administrators team. So, to avoid those type of tickets we have to sent 
requests to ignore those type alerts. 
 
 
(iv)  Application team : 
For applying any patches,  the databases should not be available to application. So, if suddenly 
database is not available then application may be crashed. So, first the application should be 
stopped. This will be done by application team.

31. What is SLA? 
A service-level agreement (SLA) is simply a document describing the level of service expected by a 
customer from a supplier, laying out the metrics by which that service is measured  and the remedies or 
penalties, if any,  should the agreed-upon levels not be achieved. Usually, SLAs are between companies 
and external suppliers,  but they may also be between two departments within a company. 
 
32. What is Problem Management? 
The objective of Problem Management is to minimize the impact of problems on the organisation. 
Problem  Management plays an important role in the detection and providing solutions to problems 
(work around& known errors) and prevents their reoccurrence. 
 
A 'Problem' is the unknown cause of one or more incidents, often identified as a result of multiple similar  
 
incidents.A 'Known error' is an identified root cause of a Problem. 
 
33. What is Incident Management? 
An 'Incident' is any event which is not part of the standard operation of the service and which causes or 
may cause, an interruption or a reduction of the quality of the service. 
The objective of Incident Management is to restore normal operations as quickly as possible with the 
least possible impact on either the business or the user, at a cost-effective price. 
Inputs for Incident Management mostly come from users, but can have other sources as well like 
management Information or Detection Systems. The outputs of the process are RFC’s (Requests for 
Changes), resolved and  closed Incidents, management information and communication to the 
customer. 
 
34. What is Change Management? 
Change management is a systematic approach to dealing with change, both from the perspective of an 
organization and on the individual level. change management has at least three different aspects, 
including  adapting to change, controlling change, and effecting change. A proactive approach to dealing 
with change is at  the core of all three aspects.In an information technology (IT) system environment, 
change management refers to a systematic approach to keeping track of the details of the system (for 
example, what operatingsystem release is running on each computer and which fixes have been 
applied). 
 
35. What is Request Management? 
service request management (SRM) is the underlying workflow and processes that enable an IT 
procurement or  service request to be reliably submitted, routed, approved, monitored and delivered. 
SRM is the process of managing a service request through its lifecycle from submission through delivery 
and follow-up. SRM may be manual or automated. In a manual system, a user calls a help desk to 
request a service, and help desk personnel create a service ticket to route the service request. In an 
automated system, the user submits a request through an online service catalog, and the application 
software automatically routes the request through the appropriate processes for approval and service 
delivery. These systems also typically enable users to track the status of their service requests, and 
management to monitor service delivery levels for quality control purposes. 
 
36. What is  grep? 
 
(i)  grep   means Globally search for Regular Expression.

(ii) Using grep we can filter the results to get a particular information. 
 
(iii) We can get only information about what string we have specified in grep command. 
 
37. What are pipes and filters in Linux? 
 
Pipes : 
 
(a) Pipes are nothing but adding two commands and make as one command. 
(b) Normally we cannot combine two commands, but using pipes we get one command by combining 
two commands. 
 
(c) So, we can get the results as what we required. 
 
Filters : 
 
(a) Filters are nothing but filtering the results what we required. 
 
(b) Using filters we can get exact results depends upon what we specified in the expression. 
(c) So, there is no wastage of time because it filters results what we specified in the command 
expression.

39. What is the command in sar to monitor NIC devices received/transmitted packets? 
 
# sar -n DEV 1 5  
 
This will show 5 consecutive output each with a time interval of 1 sec for all the ethernet devices 
 
40. What is Linux Kernel? 
It acts as an interpreter between Linux OS and its hardware. It is the fundamental component of Linux 
OS and contains hardware drivers for the devices installed on the system. The kernel is a part of the 
system which loads first and it stays on the memory. 
 
41. What  are the main parameters effect on server performance? 
 
The one of the most important task of any Linux Admin includes performance monitoring which includes 
 
parameter "Load Average" or "CPU Load". 
 
42. What is load average? 
 
Load Average is the value which represents the load on your system for a specific period of time. 
          Also it can be considered the ratio of the number of active tasks to the number of available CPUs. 
 
43. How to check? 
 
We can use either top or uptime command to view the output of the load average  as shown below. 
 
# uptime 
 
 00:07:00 up 4 days,  6:14,  1 user,  load average: 0.11, 0.14, 0.09

# top 
 
top - 00:07:12 up 4 days,  6:15,  1 user,  load average: 0.09, 0.13, 0.09 
 
44. What are the three values? 
 
As you can see three values representing the load average column. These show the load on your  
          system over a significant period of time (one or current, five and fifteen minutes averages). 
 
45. How do you know your system has a high load? 
 
The most important question as in most cases I have seen how do you determine your system has  
          high load.Does a high value represents high load average and that your system requires attention? 
 
What is the threshold value for load average? 
 
How can we conclude if the load average value is good or bad?  
 
A Central Processing Unit in earlier days used to be having only one processor and the core concept 
          was not their in those days. But with the advancement in technology and the urge of higher speed  
          to meet up demands of IT industry multiple processor were integrated in the same CPU making  
it multi-processor.   However increasing the no. of processor did increased the working speed of many 
tasks and performance but it also leads to increase in size, complexity and heat issues. So, in order to 
continue improvement of performance the core concept was introduced. 
Instead of having two CPUs and a motherboard capable of hosting them, two CPUS are taken together 
and combined to form a dual core processor which will utilize an individual socket using less power and 
size capable of performing the same amount of task as dual processor CPU. 
 Bottom Line is that Load value depends on the no. of cores in your machine. For example a dual core is 
relevant to 2 processor or 2 cores and quad core is relevant to 4 processor or four cores as the maximum 
value for load. 
 
46. How do I check the no. of cores on my Linux system? 
 
The information which you see under /proc/cpuinfo can be confusing at times. If you run the below command 
 
# less /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor 
 
processor       : 0 
 
processor       : 1 
 
processor       : 2 
 
processor       : 3 
 
processor       : 4 
 
processor       : 5 
 
 
So as per the above command my system has 16 processors in it. However it really has 8 processors with 
hyper threading enabled. The hyper threading presents 2 logical CPUs to the operating system for each 
actual core so it effectively doubles the no. of logical CPU in your system. 
 
47. How to find if hyper threading is enabled 
 
Look out for "ht" in the flags section inside cpuinfo with the below command 
 
# less /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags | uniq | grep -i  "ht" 
 
flags : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca  
    cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse  
sse2 ss ht tm syscall 
    nx rdtscp lm constant_tsc nonstop_tsc pni monitor ds_cpl vmx est tm2 
    ssse3 cx16 xtpr  sse4_1 sse4_2 popcnt lahf_lm. 
 
 
The fields we need to compare to find the no. of core are "physical id" and "core id".

# less /proc/cpuinfo | grep "core id" | sort|uniq | wc -l 
 
 4 
 
So the no. of cores would be 2x4 = 8 cores. 
 
48. What do you understand  the  Load Average? 
If the number of active tasks utilizing CPU is less as compared to available CPU cores then the load 
average can  
be considered normal but if the no. of active tasks starts increasing with respect to 
available CPU cores then the  
load average will start rising.For example, 
 
# uptime 
 
 00:43:58 up 212 days, 14:19,  4 users,  load average: 6.07, 7.08, 8.07 
 
49. How to check all the current running services in Linux? 
 
To find the status of any single service : 
 
# service vsftpd status 
 
   vsftpd (pid 5909) is running... 
 
To get the status of all the running services : 
 
# service --status-all | grep running 
 
 acpid (pid 5310) is running... 
 
 atd (pid  6528) is running... 
 
 auditd (pid  5012) is running... 
 
 Avahi daemon is not running 
 
 Avahi DNS daemon is not running 
 
 The Pegasus CIM Listener is running. 
 
 The Pegasus CIM Object Manager is running. 
 
 crond (pid  6242) is running... 
 
 dcerpcd (pid  5177) is running... 
 
 eventlogd (pid  5223) is running... 
 
In case you don't use grep you will be able to see all the services on your machine : 
 
# service --status-all 
 
 NetworkManager is stopped 
 
 acpid (pid 5310) is running... 
 
 anacron is stopped 
 
 atd (pid  6528) is running... 
 
 auditd (pid  5012) is running... 
 
 automount is stopped 
 
 Avahi daemon is not running 
 
 Avahi DNS daemon is not running 
 
 hcid is stopped 
 
 sdpd is stopped 
 
You can also check the active ports along with their services using : 
 
# netstat -ntlp 
 
Active Internet connections (only servers)

50. How do you check Linux machine is Physical or Virtual remotely? 
There is no hard and fast rule to check whether the machine is physical or virtual but still we do have 
some commands which can be used for the same purpose. 
The command used to view all the required hardware related information for any Linux machine is 
 # dmidecode 
 
But the output would be very long and hard to find out the specific details looking for. So,  
     let's narrow  it down. 
 
Physical Servers: 
 
# dmidecode -s system-product-name 
 
 System x3550 M2 -[7284AC1]- 
 
Now to get more details about the system 
 
# dmidecode | less (And search for "System Information") 
 
 System Information 
         
 
Manufacturer: IBM 
         
 
Product Name: System x3550 M2 -[7284AC1]- 
         
 
Version: 00 
         
 
Wake-up Type: Other 
         
 
SKU Number: XxXxXxX 
         
 
Family: System x 
 
Virtual Servers : 
 
# dmidecode -s system-product-name 
 
 VMware Virtual Platform 
 
# dmidecode | less 
 
 System Information 
         
 
Manufacturer: VMware, Inc. 
        
 
 Product Name: VMware Virtual Platform 
         
 
Version: None

On a virtual server running VMware you can run the below command to verify : 
 
# lspci | grep -i vmware 
 
 00:0f.0 VGA compatible controller: VMware SVGA II Adapter

51. How to find the bit size of your linux machine? 
 
 
# uname -m 
 
 i686 
 
# uname -m 
 
 x86_64 
 
 If we get i386, i586 and i686 that signifies your machine is 32-bit but if we getx86_64 or ia64 
              then  your machine will be 64-bit. 
 
# getconf LONG_BIT 
 
 32 
 
# getconf LONG_BIT 
 
 64 
(Here we  get an output of bit size either 32 or 64) 
 
52. How can you add a banner or login message in Linux? 
 
By editing these two files 
 
/etc/issue 
 
/etc/motd 
 
53. What is the difference between normal kernel and kernel-PAE? 
 
kernel in 32 bit machine supports max of 4 GB RAM, whereas 
 
kernel PAE in 32 bit linux machine supports till 64 GB RAM 
 
54. Tell me the command to find all the commands in your linux machine having only 2 words like 
           ls, cp, cd etc. 
 
# find /bin /sbin/usr/bin /usr/sbin -name ?? -type f 
 
55. Which file is generally used to configure kickstart? 
 
anaconda.cfg 
 
56. Which log file will you check for all authentication related messages?

An orphan process is a process that is still executing, but whose parent has died. 
 
62. What is a defunct process? 
          These are also termed as zombie process. These are those process who have completed their  
         execution but still has an entry in the process table. When a process ends, all of the memory  
         and resources associated with it are de-allocated so they can be used by other processes.After the  
         zombie is removed, its process identifier (PID)  
and entry in the process table can then be reused. 
         Zombies can be identified in the output from the Unix ps command by the presence of a "Z" in the "STAT"  
         column 
 
63. How do you limit maximum connections in your apache server? 
 
Change the below parameter value inside httpd.conf 
 
MaxClients 256 
 
64. Which command do you use to download a file from ftp or http website using CLI? 
 
# wget path_to_the_file 
 
65. What is the default port for ssh? How will you change it to some other random port no.? 
 
SSH port no. by default is 22. To change the default port no. we need make required changes  
          inside sshd_config 
file in the below mentioned line 
 
#Port 22 
 
(Uncomment the above line and define the new port no) 
 
Restart the services for changes to take effect. 
 
66. What is the difference between A record and CNAME record in DNS? 
 
A record : 
It is the Address records also known as host records 
Points to the IP address reflecting the domain 
Used for forward lookup of any domain name 
 
For example: 
Our website is configured on 50.63.202.15 IP so the A record of my domain name will point towards that 
IP. 
Every time a query for golinuxhub.com is made the internet will lookup for contents stored on the 
machine with  
50.63.202.15 this IP. 
 
 
CNAME Record : 
It is short abbreviation for Canonical Name 
Provides an alias name for same hostname 
Helps create subdomains 
 
 
NOTE: You cannot create a CNAME record for the domain name itself (it should be done with A record) 
 
 
           For example: 
 
golinuxhub.com is a domain name whereas www.golinuxhub.com is a sub domain name.
