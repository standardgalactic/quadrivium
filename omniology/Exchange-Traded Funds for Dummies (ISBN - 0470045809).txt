About the Author
Russell Wild is a Certified Financial Planner and a Registered Investment
Advisor. He is one of only a handful of wealth managers in the nation who is
both fee-only (takes no commissions) and welcomes clients of both substan-
tial and modest means. He calls his firm Global Portfolios to reflect his ardent
belief in international diversification — using exchange-traded funds to build
well-diversified, low-expense, tax-efficient portfolios.
Wild, in addition to the fun he has with his financial calculator, is also an
accomplished writer who helps readers understand and make wise choices
about their money. His articles have appeared in many national publications,
including AARP The Magazine, Consumer Reports, Details, Maxim, Men’s
Journal, Cosmopolitan, Reader’s Digest, and Real Simple. He also contributes
regularly to professional financial journals, such as Wealth Manager and
Financial Planning.
The author or coauthor of two dozen nonfiction books, Wild’s last work
(prior to the one you’re holding in your hand) was The Unofficial Guide to
Getting a Divorce, coauthored with attorney Susan Ellis Wild, his ex-wife —
yeah, you read that right — and published by Wiley. No stranger to the mass
media, Wild has shared his wit and wisdom on such shows as Oprah, The
View, CBS Morning News, and Good Day New York, and in hundreds of radio
interviews.
Wild holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree in interna-
tional management and finance from Thunderbird, the Garvin School of
International Management, in Glendale, Arizona (consistently ranked the #1
school for international business by both U.S. News and World Report and the
Wall Street Journal); a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in business/economics
magna cum laude from American University in Washington, D.C.; and a gradu-
ate certificate in personal financial planning from Moravian College in
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (America’s sixth oldest college). A member of the
National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) since 2002, Wild
is also a long-time member and board member of the American Society of
Journalists and Authors (ASJA).
The author grew up on Long Island and now lives in Allentown, Pennsylvania,
with his two children, Adrienne and Clayton, along with Norman, the killer
poodle. His Web site is www.globalportfolios.net.


Dedication
To the small investor, who has been bamboozled, bullied, and beaten up long
enough.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Although I’ve written many books, this is my first Dummies book, and writing
a first Dummies book is a bit like learning to ride a bicycle — on a very windy
day. If it weren’t for Joan Friedman, project editor, who kept a steady hand on
the back of my seat, I would surely have fallen off a curb and been run over
by a pickup truck flying a Confederate flag. Joan, hands down, is one of the
best editors I’ve ever worked with. She’s a very nice person, too.
Other nice people that I’d also like to tip my bicycle helmet to include
Marilyn Allen of Allen O’Shea Literary Agency (she calls me “babe,” just like
agents do in movies; I love that) and Stacy Kennedy, acquisitions editor at
Wiley. If these two gals hadn’t gotten together, I wouldn’t have had a bicycle
to ride.
Thanks, too, to Noel Jameson, technical editor, for making sure that this
remained strictly a work of nonfiction. And to Michael Pace, who double
checked.
I’d like to thank Morningstar, and particularly Sumita Ghosh, for extreme gen-
erosity in providing fund industry data and analysis.
I’d also like to thank Donald Bowles, my old professor of economics at
American University, for showing me that supply curves can be fun. Sorry we
lost touch, but I haven’t forgotten you.
I am indebted to Brenda Lange, my sage partner, for convincing me that I
should write this book. Truth is, when Brenda tries, she could convince me to
do just about anything.
And finally, I’d like to thank my old man, Lawrence Wild, both my most
beloved and most difficult client, who, if he told me once, told me a thousand
times: “Rich or poor, it’s good to have money.” It took me years to discover
the profound wisdom in that statement.

Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies

Introduction
E
very month, it seems, Wall Street comes up with some newfangled
investment idea. The array of financial products (replete with 164-page
prospectuses) is now so dizzying that the old lumpy mattress is starting to
look like a more comfortable place to stash the cash. But there is one rela-
tively new product out there definitely worth looking at. It’s something of a
cross between an index mutual fund and a stock, and it’s called an exchange-
traded fund, or ETF.
Just as computers, fax machines, and Humvees were used by big institutions
before they caught on with individual consumers, so it was with ETFs. They
were first embraced by institutional traders — investment banks, hedge funds,
and insurance firms — because, among other things, they allow for the quick
juggling of massive holdings. Big traders like that sort of thing. Personally, play-
ing hot potato with my money is not my idea of fun. But all the same, over the
past several years, I’ve invested most of my own savings in ETFs, and I’ve sug-
gested to many of my clients that they do the same.
I’m not alone in my appreciation of ETFs. They have grown exponentially
in the past few years — nearly 50 percent in 2005 — and they will surely
continue to grow and gain influence. While I can’t claim that my purchases
and my recommendations of ETFs account for much of the growing $300 bil-
lion ETF market, I’m happy to be a (very) small part of it. After you’ve read
Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies, you may decide to become part of it
as well, if you haven’t already.
About This Book
As with any other investment, you’re looking for a certain payoff in reading
this book that you’ve just purchased. In an abstract sense, the payoff will
come in your achieving a thorough understanding and appreciation of a
powerful financial tool called an exchange-traded fund. In a more concrete
sense, this book — by explaining how to use this powerful financial tool —
can help you make money.

What makes me think ETFs can help you make money?
 ETFs are intelligent. Most financial experts agree that playing with
individual stocks can be hazardous to one’s wealth. Anything from an
accounting scandal to the CEO’s sudden angina attack can send a single
stock spiraling downward. That’s why it makes sense for the average
investor to own lots of stocks — or bonds — through ETFs or mutual
funds.
 ETFs are cheap. Many ETFs carry total management expenses under
0.20 percent a year. Some of the larger ETFs carry management fees as
low as 0.07 percent a year. The average mutual fund, in contrast, charges
1.67 percent a year. Such differences, while appearing small on paper,
can make a huge impact on your take-home. I crunch some appropriate
numbers in Chapter 2.
 ETFs are tax-smart. Because of the very clever way ETFs are structured,
the taxes you pay on any growth are minimal. I crunch some of those
numbers in Chapter 2, as well.
 ETFs are open books. Quite unlike mutual funds, an ETF’s holdings are
readily visible. If this afternoon, for example, I were to buy 100 shares
of the ETF called the SPDR (pronounced “spider”) 500, I would know
that exactly 3.54 percent of my money was invested in General Electric,
another 3.52 percent was in Exxon Mobil Corp., and 2.26 percent was in
Microsoft. You don’t get that kind of detail when you buy most mutual
funds. Mutual fund managers, like stage magicians, are often reluctant
to reveal their secrets. In the investment game, the more you know,
the less the odds of you getting sawed in half.
And speaking of open books, if this open book — the one you’re now
reading — were like some (but certainly not all) mutual funds, it would be
largely unintelligible and expensive. (It might be doubly expensive if you
tried to resell the book within 90 days!) Luckily, this book is more like an
ETF. Here’s how:
 Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies is intelligent. I don’t try to
convince you that ETFs are your best investment choice, and I certainly
don’t tell you that ETFs will make you rich. Instead, I lay out facts and
figures and summarize some hard academic findings, and I let you draw
your own conclusions.
 Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies is cheap. Hey, top-notch invest-
ment advice for only $24.99 (plus or minus any discounts, shipping, and
tax) . . . Where else are you going to get that kind of deal? And should
you come to the conclusion after reading this book that ETFs belong in
your portfolio, you’ll likely get your $24.99 (plus any shipping costs and
tax) back in no time at all.
2
Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies 

 Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies is tax-smart. Yes, the money
you spent for this book, as all other outlays you make for investment
advice, may be deducted from your federal income taxes (provided you
itemize your deductions). Go for it!
 Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies is an open book. We’ve already
established that!
If you’ve ever read a book For Dummies before, you have an idea what you’re
about to embark on. This is not a book you need to read from front to back.
Feel free to jump about and glean whatever information you think will be of
most use. There is no quiz at the end. You don’t have to put it all to memory.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate this text as easily as possible, I use the following
conventions:
 Whenever I introduce a new term, it appears in italics. You can rest
assured that I provide a definition or explanation nearby.
 If I want to share some interesting information that isn’t crucial to your
understanding of the topic at hand, I place it in a sidebar, a gray box with
its own heading that is set apart from the rest of the text. (See how this
whole italics/definition thing works?)
 All Web addresses appear in monofont so they’re easy to pick out if you
need to go back and find them.
Keep in mind that when this book was printed, some Web addresses may
have needed to break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured
that we haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the
break. So, when using one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what
you see in this book, pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
When my computer is ill, and I call “Tom” (Dell’s man somewhere in the Far
East), all I want is for Tom to fix my problem, whatever that is. I’m not in
the market for explanations. On the ETF front, however, I really like knowing
all the technical ins and outs. That may not be your thing. You may be like
me with my computer problems: “Just tell me how to make money with these
things, and keep the technical stuff to yourself, Russ.” Okay, I do that. Sort of.
3
Introduction

Throughout this book, you usually find the heavy technical matter tucked
neatly into sidebars. But if any technicalities make it into the main text, I give
you a heads up with a Technical Stuff icon so you can skip over that section,
or just speed-read it if you wish.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume that most of the people reading this sentence know a fair amount
about the financial world. I think that’s a fairly safe assumption. Why else
would you have bought an entire book about exchange-traded funds?
If you think that convertible bonds are bonds with removable tops and that
the futures market is a place where fortunetellers purchase crystal balls, I help
you along the best I can in this book by letting you know how to find out more
about certain topics. However, you may be better off picking up and reading a
copy of the basic nuts-n-bolts Investing For Dummies by Eric Tyson (published
by Wiley). After you spend some time with that title, c’mon back to this book.
You’ll be more than welcome!
How This Book is Organized
Here’s a down-and-dirty look at what’s in store in the next 320 or so pages.
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs
Just what is an ETF, after all? The beginning of the book would seem like a
logical place to cover that topic, and I do. You also find out what makes an
ETF different — more sleek and economical — than a mutual fund. (Think
Prius versus Humvee.) This section of the book also begins the discussion of
how to actually buy ETFs — the very best of them — hold them, and, when
necessary, cash them out.
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity)
Side of Your Portfolio
You wouldn’t want a closet filled with nothing but black slacks or red
sweaters, and similarly, you don’t want a portfolio filled with, say, nothing but
4
Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies 

tech stocks (remember 2000–2003 when your tech portfolio suddenly went
poof?). ETFs are wonderful diversification tools, if used right. In Part II, I
show you how to mix and match your stock ETFs to build a portfolio that
will serve you well in both good times and bad.
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and
Other ETFs to Your Portfolio
In this part, I walk you through the construction of a portfolio beyond its
stock components. I introduce you to a bevy of bond, real estate (other-
wise known as REIT), and commodity ETFs, and I show you how to massage
those into your portfolio for maximum diversification. (Oh, have I not
mentioned that diversification is all-important?) Afterward, I discuss 
non-ETF investments (such as mutual funds and individual stocks) and
how to determine if those are appropriate and desirable additions to your
portfolio.
Part IV: Putting It All Together
Here, you find sample portfolios. You may find one that fits you like a glove.
Or you may find one that you can tinker with to make it your own. After that
business is done with, you enter a section of this book that I almost titled
“Zen and the Art of ETF Portfolio Maintenance.” After all, after you have
your ETF portfolio, you need to know how to maintain it, tweak it from
time to time, and use it to serve both your material and spiritual needs —
preferably with a cool head and calm spirit. Part IV helps you to address
those needs.
Part V: The Part of Tens
A classic feature in the For Dummies series, The Part of Tens offers concise
advice and food for extra thought, all in handy dandy list form.
Part VI: Appendixes
Here’s where you find a complete list of ETFs available as of this writing, Web
sites you can visit to get even more information about this investment tool,
and a glossary to help you navigate any ETF resource.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book, you find little globular pieces of art in the margins
called icons. These admittedly cutesy but handy tools give you a heads up
that certain types of information are in the neighborhood.
Although this is a how-to book, you also find plenty of whys and wherefores.
Any paragraph accompanied by this icon, however, is guaranteed pure, 100
percent, unadulterated how-to.
The world of investments offers pitfalls galore. Wherever you see the bomb,
know that there is a risk of your losing money — maybe even Big Money — if
you skip the passage.
Read twice! This icon indicates that something important is being said and is
really worth putting to memory.
If you don’t really care about the difference between standard deviation and
beta, or the historical correlation between U.S. value stocks and REITs, feel
free to skip or skim the paragraphs with this icon.
The world of Wall Street is full of people who make money at other people’s
expense. Where you see the pig face, know that I’m about to point out an
instance where someone will likely be sticking a hand deep in your pocket.
Where to Go from Here
Where would you like to go from here? If you wish, start at the beginning. If
you’re interested only in stock ETFs, hey, no one says that you can’t jump right
to Part II. Bond ETFs? Go ahead and jump to Part III. It’s entirely your call.

The ABCs of ETFs

In this part . . .
I
n these first few ground-laying chapters, you find out
what makes exchange-traded funds different from
other investment vehicles. You discover the rationale for
their being, why they are popular with institutional
investors, why they are rapidly becoming so popular with
noninstitutional folk, and why the author of this book likes
them almost as much as he does milk chocolate.
Although the art and science of building an ETF portfolio
come later in the book, this first part introduces you to
how ETFs are bought and sold and helps you ponder
whether you should even be thinking about buying them.

 Getting a handle on how they are administered
 Finding out how they are bought and sold
 Calculating their phenomenal growth
T
here are, no doubt, a good number of pinstriped ladies and gentlemen in
and around Wall Street who froth heavily at the mouth when they hear
the words exchange-traded fund. In a world of very pricey investment prod-
ucts and very lucratively paid investment-product salespeople, ETFs are the
ultimate killjoys.
Since their arrival on the investment scene in the early 1990s, more than 300
ETFs have been created, and they have grown faster in asset accumulation
than any other investment product. And that is a good thing. ETFs have
allowed the average American investment opportunities that do not involve
shelling out fat commissions or paying layers of ongoing, unnecessary fees.
And they’ve saved investors oodles and oodles in taxes.
Hallelujah.
SPDRs, DIAMONDS, Qubes . . . Why the plurals?
Many ETFs have names that end in an s. That can
be confusing. After all, you would never refer to
the Fidelity Magellan Fund as Magellans. So why
the plural when talking about a single ETF? The
convention is to refer not just to the fund but to
the components of the fund. Thus, DIAMONDS
refers to the 30 companies that make up the Dow
Jones Industrial Average index. Qubes refers to
the 100 companies that make up the NASDAQ-
100 Index. But rest assured that when brokers
talk about DIAMONDS and Qubes, they are talk-
ing about a single ETF.

In the Beginning
When I was a lad growing up in the ’burbs of New York City, my public school
educators taught me how to read, write, and learn the capitals of the 50 states.
I also learned that anything and everything of any importance in this world
was, ahem, invented in the United States of America. I’ve since learned that,
well, that isn’t entirely true. Take ETFs. The first ETF was introduced in Canada.
It was a creation of the Toronto Stock Exchange — no Wall Streeters were any-
where in sight!
I’m afraid that the story of the development of ETFs isn’t quite as exciting as,
say, the story behind penicillin or the atom bomb. As one Toronto Stock
Exchange insider once explained to me, “We saw it as a way of making money
by generating more trading.” And so, thus was born the original ETF known
as TIP, which stood for Toronto Index Participation Unit. It tracked an index
of large Canadian companies (Bell Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, Nortel, and
32 others) known as the Toronto 35. That index was then the closest thing
that Canada had to the Dow Jones Industrial Average index that exists in the
United States.
Enter the traders
TIP was an instant success with large institutional stock traders, who saw
that they could now trade an entire index in a flash. The Toronto Stock
Exchange got what it wanted — more trading. And the world of ETFs got
its start.
TIP has since morphed to track a larger index, the so-called S&P/TSX 60 Index,
which — you probably guessed — tracks 60 of Canada’s largest and most liquid
companies. The fund also has a new name, the iUnits S&P/TSX 60 Index Fund,
and it trades under the ticker XIU. It is now managed by Barclays, the British
financial powerhouse that has come to be the biggest player in ETFs in Europe,
Canada, and the United States. (Barclays has since introduced another ETF in
the United States that uses the ticker TIP, but it has nothing to do with the
original TIP. The present-day TIP invests in U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities.)
Moving south of the border
The first ETF didn’t come to the United States (oh, how my public school
teachers would cringe!) for three or so more years after its Canadian birth.
10
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

On January 29, 1993, the Mother of All U.S. ETFs was born on the American
Stock Exchange. It was called the S&P Depositary Receipts Trust Series 1,
commonly known as the SPDR (or Spider) 500, and it traded (and still does)
under the ticker symbol SPY.
The SPDR 500, which tracks the S&P 500 index, an index of the 500 largest
U.S. companies, was an instant darling of institutional traders. It continues
to be one of their darlings, but it is also a major holding in the portfolios of
many individuals.
Fulfilling a Dream
ETFs were first embraced by institutions, and those institutions very much
continue to this day to use ETFs for institutional use. They are constantly
buying and selling ETFs and options on ETFs for various institutional pur-
poses, which I touch on in Chapter 18. For us noninstitutional types, the
creation and expansion of ETFs has allowed for the construction of portfolios
of institutional-like sleekness.
Goodbye, ridiculously high
mutual fund fees
A mutual fund investor with a $150,000 portfolio filled with actively-managed
funds will likely spend $2,505 (1.67 percent) or more in annual expenses. By
switching to an ETF portfolio, that investor will incur trading costs (because
trading ETFs costs the same as trading stocks) of, oh, perhaps $100 or so. But
he can then lower his ongoing annual expenses to about $600 (0.4 percent).
That’s a difference, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, of $1,905, which is com-
pounded every year his money is invested.
Loads, those odious fees that some mutual funds charge for getting into or
out of the fund, simply don’t exist in the world of ETFs. 
Capital gains taxes, the blow that comes on April 15th to many mutual fund
holders with taxable accounts, hardly exist. In fact, here’s what my clients
and I have paid in capital gains taxes in the past three years: $00.00.
In Chapter 2, I delve much deeper into both the cost savings and the tax effi-
ciency of ETFs.
11
Chapter 1: The New Kid on the Block

Hello, building blocks for a better portfolio
In terms of diversification, my own portfolio and those of my clients include
large stocks; small stocks; micro cap stocks; English, French, Swiss, Japanese,
and Korean stocks; long-term bonds; short-term bonds; and real estate invest-
ment trusts (REITs) — all held in low-cost ETFs. I talk all about diversification,
and how to use ETFs as building blocks for a class A portfolio, in Part II.
Yes, you could use other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds, to create
a well-diversified portfolio. But ETFs make it much easier because they tend
to track very specific indexes. They are, by and large, much more pure than
mutual funds. An ETF that bills itself as an investment in, say, small growth
stocks is going to give you an investment in small growth stocks, plain and
simple. A mutual fund that bills itself as an investment vehicle for small
growth stocks may include everything from cash to bonds to shares of
General Electric. (No, I’m not exaggerating, and I give a specific example or
two in the next chapter.)
Will you miss the court papers?
While scandals of various sorts — hidden fees, “soft-money” arrangements,
after-hours sweetheart deals, and executive kickbacks — have plagued the
world of mutual fund and hedge fund investments, here are the number of
scandals that have touched my life or the lives and fortunes of any of my
clients: 0. That’s because ETFs’ managers, forced to follow existing indexes,
have very little leeway in the investments they choose or the proportions in
which they choose them. ETFs are closely regulated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which not all investment vehicles are. And ETFs trade
during the day, in plain view of millions of traders — not after hours, as mutual
funds do, which can allow for sweetheart deals when no one is looking.
I talk much more about the transparency and cleanliness of ETFs in Chapter 2.
Not Quite as Popular as the Beatles,
But Getting There
With all that ETFs have going for them, I’m not surprised that they have lately
begun to sell like wildfire. The Investment Company Institute, an organization
that obsessively tracks the whims of investors, tells us that from the beginning
12
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

of 2000, when there were only 80 ETFs on the U.S. market, to the end of 2005,
when there were over 200, the total assets invested in ETFs rose from $52 bil-
lion to $300 billion. At the time of this writing — several months into 2006 —
the total is $320 billion.
Certainly, $320 billion pales in comparison to the amount of money invested
in mutual funds: $9+ trillion. But if current trends continue, ETFs may indeed
become as popular as were John, Paul, George, and Ringo.
Part of ETFs’ popularity stems from the growly bear market of 2000–2003.
Investors who had been riding the double-digit-yearly gravy train of the 1990s
suddenly realized that their portfolios weren’t going to keep growing in leaps
and bounds, and perhaps it was time to start watching investment costs.
There has also been a greater awareness of the triumph of indexing — investing
in entire markets or market segments — rather than trying to cherry-pick
stocks. Much more on that topic in Chapter 2.

Chapter 1: The New Kid on the Block
The little kid is growing fast:
ETFs’ phenomenal growth
Following are a few facts and figures that indi-
cate how the ETF market compares with the
mutual fund market and how rapidly ETFs are
gaining in popularity.
The amount of money invested in ETFs and
mutual funds as of March 2006:
 ETFs: $320 billion
 Mutual funds: $9.2 trillion
The total number of ETFs and mutual funds
available to U.S. investors as of March 2006:
 ETFs: 203
 Mutual funds: 7,800
The number of ETFs available to U.S. investors
in recent years:
 2000: 80
 2001: 102
 2002: 113
 2003: 119
 2004: 151
 2005: 201
The amount of money invested in ETFs in recent
years:

 2001: $75 billion
 2002: $100 billion
 2003: $150 billion
 2004: $220 billion
 2005: $300 billion

Moving from Wall Street to Main Street
Investment trends work sort of like fashion trends. In the world of fashion,
trendsetters — movie stars, British royals, or Paris Hilton (wherever she
came from) — wander out into public wearing something that most people
consider ridiculous, and the next thing you know, everyone is wearing that
same item. It took from 1993 until about, oh, 2001 or so (around the time I
bought my first ETF) for this newfangled investment vehicle to really start
moving. By about 2003, insiders say, the majority of ETFs were being pur-
chased by individual investors, not institutions or investment professionals.
Today, Barclays, which controls about 55 percent of the U.S. market for ETFs,
estimates that approximately 60 percent of all the trading in ETFs is done by
individual investors. The other 40 percent is being done by both institutions
and by fee-only financial advisors, like me.
(Fee-only, by the way, signifies that a financial advisor takes no commissions
of any sort. It’s a very confusing term because fee-based is often used to
mean the opposite. Check out Chapter 20, where I talk about whether you
need a financial professional to build and manage an ETF portfolio.)
Actually, individual investors — especially the buy-and-hold kind of
investors — benefit much more from ETFs than do institutional traders.
That’s because institutional traders have always gotten, and continue to
get, the very best deals on investment vehicles. They often pay much less
in management fees than do individual investors for shares in the same
mutual fund. (Fund companies often refer to institutional class versus
investor class shares. All that really means is “wholesale/low price” versus
“retail/higher price.”)
Keeping up with the Vanguards
It may sound like I’m pushing ETFs as not only the best thing since white
bread but as a replacement for white bread. Well, not quite. As much as I like
ETFs, good old white-bread mutual funds still have their place in the sun. And
that’s especially true of inexpensive index mutual funds, such as Vanguard’s
and Fidelity’s. They still have very much to offer. Mutual funds, for example,
are clearly the better option when you’re investing in dribs and drabs and
don’t want to have to pay for each trade you make.
One of the largest purveyors of ETFs is The Vanguard Group, the very same
people who pioneered index mutual funds. In the case of Vanguard (and only
Vanguard at this point), shares in the company’s ETFs are the equivalent of
shares in one of the company’s index mutual funds. In other words, they are
different class shares in the same fund — the same representation of compa-
nies, but a different structure and slightly lower costs for the ETFs.

Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

Because Vanguard funds allow for an apples-to-apples comparison of ETFs
and index mutual funds, and because the company presumably has no great
stake in which you choose, Vanguard may be a good place to turn for objec-
tive advice on which investment is better for you. But rest assured — a point
that I’ll make again in this book — we’re not talking rocket science. For most
buy-and-hold investors, especially in taxable accounts of more than $50,000
or so, ETFs will almost always be the winners, at least in the long-run.
I look much more closely at the ETFs versus mutual funds question when I
design specific portfolios and give actual portfolio examples in Chapters 15
and 16.
Ready for Prime Time: Becoming
Household Words
One survey in the summer of 2005 found that only about one-third of
investors with at least $50,000 in investable assets said that they were very
or somewhat familiar with ETFs. My guess is that by the time Exchange-
Traded Funds For Dummies appears on bookshelves, at least half of U.S.
investors will be familiar with ETFs. And I believe that in a couple of years,
the vast majority of investors will be at least somewhat familiar with ETFs.
But will ETFs surpass mutual funds as the nation’s favorite investment vehi-
cle? They should. But they won’t.
People just aren’t that logical.
15
Chapter 1: The New Kid on the Block
The ripple effect: Forcing down prices on other
investment vehicles
You don’t need to invest in ETFs to profit from
them. They are doing to the world of investing
what Chinese labor has done to manufacturing
wages in the United States. In other words, they
are driving prices down. Thanks to the compe-
tition that ETFs are giving index mutual funds
(already ETFs have claimed one-third of the
$800 or so billion invested in such funds), mutual
fund providers have been lowering their
charges. Fidelity Investments, for example, in
2005 lowered the expense ratio on some of its
index funds from as much as 0.47 percent down
to 0.10 percent. With many mutual funds, how-
ever, you must keep a minimum balance.
Fidelity’s minimum for its lowest-cost index
funds is $10,000

Index mutual funds, which most resemble ETFs, have been in existence since
Vanguard rolled out the First Index Investment Trust fund in 1976. Since that
time, Vanguard and other mutual fund companies have created literally hun-
dreds of index funds, tracking every conceivable index. Yet index funds
remain relatively obscure. According to figures from Vanguard, index mutual
funds hold only a scant 3 percent of all money invested in stock mutual
funds; bond index funds represent less than 1 percent of all money invested
in bond mutual funds.
Why would anyone want to invest in index funds or ETFs? After all, the finan-
cial professionals who run actively-managed mutual funds spend many years
and tens of thousands of dollars educating themselves at places with real ivy
on the walls, like Harvard and Wharton. They know all about the economy,
the stock market, business trends, and so on. Shouldn’t we cash in on their
knowledge by letting them pick the best basket of investments for us?
Good question! Here’s the problem with hiring these financial whizzes, and
the reason that index funds or ETFs generally kick their ivy-league butts:
When these whizzes from Harvard and Wharton go to market to buy and sell
stocks, they are usually buying and selling stock (not directly, but through
the markets) from other whizzes who graduated from Harvard and Wharton.
One whiz bets that ABC stock is going down, so he sells. His former class-
mate bets that ABC stock is going up, so he buys. Which whiz is right? Half
the time, it’s the buyer. Half the time, it’s the seller. Meanwhile, you pay for all
the trading, not to mention the whiz’s handsome salary while all this buying
and selling is going on.
Economists have a name for such a market; they call it “efficient.” It means, in
general, that there are soooo many smart people analyzing and dissecting
and studying the market that the chances are slim that any one whiz — no
matter how whizzical, no matter how thick his Cambridge accent — is going
to be able to beat the pack.
16
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 
Can you pick next year’s winners?
Okay, study after study shows that most actively
managed mutual funds don’t do as well in the
long-run as the indexes, but certainly some do
much, much better, at least for a few years. And
any number of magazine articles will tell you
how to pick next year’s winners.
If only it were that easy. Alas, studies show
rather conclusively that it is anything but easy.
Morningstar, on a great number of occasions,
has earmarked the top-performing mutual funds
and mutual fund managers over a given period of
time and tracked their performance moving for-
ward. In one representative study, the top 30
mutual funds for sequential five-year periods
from 1971 to 2002 were evaluated for their per-
formance moving forward. In each and every
five-year period, the “30 top funds,” as a group,
did worse than the S&P 500 in subsequent years.

That, in a nutshell, is why actively managed mutual funds tend to lag the
indexes, usually by a considerable margin. If you want to read more about
why stock-pickers and market-timers almost never beat the indexes, I suggest
picking up a copy of the seminal A Random Walk Through Wall Street by
Princeton economist Burton G. Malkiel. The book, now in something like its
200th edition, is available in paperback from W. W. Norton & Company.
There’s also a Web site — www.indexfunds.com — run by something of an
indexing fanatic (hey, there are worse things to be) that is literally choked
with articles and studies on the subject. You could spend days reading!
The proof of the pudding
According to Morningstar analysis, the average annual return of all index
funds over the past 15 years has been 10.08 percent. Compare that number
with the average annual return for all actively managed mutual funds: 8.70
percent. That difference — 1.38 percent — is largely due to differences in
fees. It may not seem like a big number, but compounded over time, it is huge.
Let’s plug in a few numbers. An initial investment of $100,000 earning 10.08 per-
cent for 15 years will be worth $422,305 at the end of the day. An investment
of $100,000 earning 8.70 percent for 15 years will be worth $349,497. That’s
$72,808 extra in your pocket if you invest in index funds. And in fact, that figure
would likely be much higher after you account for taxes. (Taxes on actively
managed funds can be considerably higher than those on index funds.)
You may be thinking, “Well bully for index funds, but what does this have to
do with ETFs?” Index funds are the investment vehicles that most closely
resemble ETFs, and because index funds have been around a lot longer, we
have better data on them. I can’t yet tell you how ETFs perform over a 15-
year period. However, I do have some long-term data on the earliest ETFs to
be created:
 SPY: The very first ETF to enter the U.S. market, the SPDR 500 (SPY), has
seen an annualized return of 8.86 percent in the past 10 years. Over the
same period, the average return for actively managed large cap mutual
funds has been 7.94 percent. (I discuss large cap funds in Chapters 5
and 6.)
 MDY: The Midcap SPDR Trust Series 1 (MDY) has enjoyed a 10-year
annualized average return of 14.41 percent versus 12.11 percent for
all actively managed mid cap stock funds. In the case of the mid caps,
$100,000 invested 10 years ago would now be worth $384,273. That same
money invested in an average actively managed fund would now be
worth $313,649. That’s a difference of $70,624. And, depending on your
tax bracket over the years, the tax difference beyond that would be even
more substantial. You may easily have scored an extra $75,000 going
with the ETF over the actively managed mutual fund.
17
Chapter 1: The New Kid on the Block

By the way, the very first ETF — SPY — is still by far the largest ETF on the
market, with total assets of $54 billion. (In contrast, the largest mutual fund,
American Funds Growth A, has total assets of $78 billion.)

In Parts II and III of this book, I provide details about many of the ETFs that

gies. You will likely recognize a few of the names.

Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

Twist and shout: Commercialization
could ruin a good thing
Innovation is a great thing. Usually. In the world of ETFs, a few big players
(Barclays, Vanguard) jumped in when the going was hot. Now, in order to get
their share of the pie, a number of new players have entered the fray with
some pretty wild ETFs. (“Let’s invest in all companies whose CEO is named
Fred!”) Okay, I’m just kidding about the Fred portfolio, but if things keep
going the way they are going . . . I dunno.
I tend to like my ETFs vanilla plain, maybe with a few sprinkles. I like them to
follow indexes that make sense. And, above all, I like their expense ratios
looooow. At present, the average ETF carries an expense ratio of 0.40 percent.
Some of the newer ETFs have expense ratios edging up into the ballpark of
what you usually see for mutual funds.
I’m not saying that ETFs must follow traditional indexes. There may be room
for improvement. (Actually, when I think about it, some of the traditional
indexes, like the Dow, are darn dumb. I explain why in Chapter 3) But I do
hope the ETF industry can maintain its integrity and not go too far astray
into the field of high expenses and silly investment schemes. Future editions
of this book will tell the tale.

 Asking if ETFs are for you
B
anking your retirement on stocks is risky enough; banking your retire-
ment on any individual stock, or even a handful of stocks, is Evil
Knievel-jumping-Snake-River investing. Banking on individual bonds is typi-
cally less risky (maybe Evil Knievel jumping a creek), but the same general
principle holds. There is safety in numbers. That’s why teenage boys and
girls huddle together in corners at school dances. That’s why gnus graze in
groups. That’s why smart stock and bond investors grab onto ETFs.
The Nature of the Beast
Just as a deed shows that you have ownership of a house, and a share of
common stock certifies ownership in a company, a share of an ETF repre-
sents ownership (most typically) in a basket of company stocks. To buy or
sell an ETF, you place an order with a broker, either by phone or online. The
price of an ETF changes throughout the trading day, which is to say from 9:30
a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Wall Street time, going up or going down with the market
value of the securities it holds. (Sometimes there can be a little sway, but
rarely anything serious.)
Originally, ETFs were developed to mirror various indices:
 The SPDR 500 (ticker SPY) represents stocks from the S&P (Standard
and Poors) 500, an index of the 500 largest companies in the United
States.

 The DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (ticker DIA) represents the 30 underlying
stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index.
 The NASDAQ-100 Trust Series 1, otherwise known as Qubes (ticker
QQQQ), represents the 100 stocks of the NASDAQ-100 Index.
Since ETFs were first introduced, many others, tracking all kinds of things,
have emerged.
Knowing that not all ETFs
are created equal
Depending on the ETF, the component companies in the ETF portfolio usually
represent a certain index or segment of the market. That segment may be,
say, large U.S. value stocks, small growth stocks, or micro cap stocks. (If
you’re not 100 percent clear on the difference between value and growth, or
what a micro cap is, rest assured that I discuss each in Part II.)
Sometimes, the stock market is broken up into industry sectors, such as tech-
nology, industrials, or consumer discretionary, and there are ETFs that mirror
those sectors, as well as many others.
Choosing between the classic and the new
Some of the ETF providers (Vanguard, Barclays) tend to use traditional
indexes, such as those I mention earlier in the chapter. Others (PowerShares,
Rydex) tend to develop their own indexes.
For example, if you were to buy 100 shares of an ETF called the iShares S&P
500 Growth Index Fund (IVW), you’d be buying into a traditional index (large
U.S. growth companies). At about $61 a share, you’d plunk down $6,100 for a
portfolio of stocks that would include shares of Microsoft, Exxon Mobil Corp.,
Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, and General Electric. If you wanted to
know exactly how your money was being spent, the iShares prospectus (or
any number of financial Web sites, such as http://finance.yahoo.com)
would tell you specific percentages: Microsoft, 4.19 percent; Exxon Mobil
Corp., 3.92 percent; Procter & Gamble, 3.4 percent; and so on.
Many ETFs represent shares in foreign indexes. If, for example, you were to
own 100 shares of the iShares MSCI Japan Index Fund (EWJ), with a current
market value of about $13.50 share, your $1,350 would buy you a stake in
large Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi, Toyota, Sony, and Honda
Motors. I devote an entire chapter — Chapter 10 — to international ETFs.
22
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

Both IVW and EWJ mirror standard indexes: IVW mirrors the S&P 500 Growth
Index, and EWJ mirrors the MSCI Japan Index. If, however, you purchase 100
shares of the PowerShares Dynamic Large Cap Growth Portfolio, you’ll buy
roughly $1,600 of a portfolio of stocks that mirror a very unconventional
index — one created by the PowerShares family of exchange-traded funds.
The large U.S. growth companies in the index don’t include Microsoft or
Exxon Mobil Corp., but rather companies like UnitedHealth Group, Dell, and
American Express. PowerShares refers to their custom indexes as
“enhanced.”
The single largest controversy in the world of ETFs is whether the newfangled,
customized indexes of companies like PowerShares make any sense. Most
financial professionals are, frankly, nauseated by newness. We are a conserva-
tive lot. But I’m trying to keep an open mind. For now, let me continue with my
introduction to ETFs, but rest assured that I address this raging controversy
later in the book (in Chapter 3 and throughout Part II).
Other ETFs — a distinct but growing minority — represent holdings in valu-
ables other than stocks, notably U.S. Treasury Bonds, corporate bonds, gold,
or silver. I discuss these in Part III of this book.
Recognizing common elements
Regardless of what securities an ETF represents, regardless of what index
those securities are a part of, your fortunes as an ETF holder are directly tied
to the value of the underlying securities. If the price of Exxon Mobil Corp.
stock, U.S. Treasury Bonds, or gold goes up, so does the value of your ETF.
If GE stock pays a dividend, you are due a certain amount of that dividend. If
the price of gold tumbles, your portfolio (if you hold a gold ETF) may lose
some glitter.
ETFs are Preferable to Individual Stocks
Okay, why buy a basket of stocks rather than individual stock? Quick answer:
You’ll sleep better.
You may recall that in March 2004, the always fashionable Martha Stewart
was convicted of obstructing justice and lying in an insider-trading case
involving a small company called ImClone. Within hours, shares in Stewart’s
namesake firm, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, tumbled 23 percent.
Those sorts of things — sometimes much worse — happen every day in the
world of stocks.
23
Chapter 2: What the Heck Is an ETF, Anyway?

A company I’ll call ABC Pharmaceutical sees its stock shoot up by 68 percent
because the firm just earned an important patent for a new diet pill; a month
later, the stock falls by 84 percent because a study in the New England Journal
of Medicine found that the new diet pill causes people to hallucinate and
think they are Genghis Khan.
Compared to the world of individual stocks, the stock market as a whole is as
smooth as a morning lake. Heck, a daily rise or fall in the Dow of more than a
percent or two is generally considered a pretty big deal.
If you, like me, are not especially keen on roller coasters, then you are
advised to put your nest egg into not one stock, not two, but many. If you
have a few million sitting around, hey, no problem diversifying. Maybe indi-
vidual stocks are for you. But for most of us commoners, the only way to
effectively diversify is with ETFs or mutual funds.
ETFs Are Not Mutual
So what is the difference between an ETF and a mutual fund? After all, mutual
funds also represent baskets of stocks or bonds. The two, however, are not
twins. They’re not even siblings. Cousins are more like it. Here are some of
the big differences between ETFs and mutual funds:
 ETFs are bought and sold just like stocks (through a brokerage house,
either by phone or online), and their price can change from second to
second. Mutual fund orders can be made during the day, but the actual
trading doesn’t occur until after the markets close.
 ETFs tend to represent indexes — market segments — and the managers
of the ETFs tend to do very little trading of securities in the ETF. (The
ETFs are passively managed.)
 Although they require you to pay small trading fees, ETFs usually wind
up costing you much less than a mutual fund because the ongoing
management fees are typically much less, and there is never a load
(an entrance or exit fee, sometime an exorbitant one) as there is with
many mutual funds.
 Because of low portfolio turnover and also the way they are structured,
ETFs’ investment gains usually are more gingerly taxed than the gains on
mutual funds.
Table 2-1 provides a quick look at some ways that investing in ETFs differs
from investing in mutual funds and individual stocks.

Why the Big Boys Prefer ETFs
When ETFs were first introduced, they were primarily of interest to institu-
tional traders — insurance companies, hedge fund people, banks — who often
have investment needs considerably more complicated than yours and mine.
Trading in large lots
Prior to the introduction of ETFs, there was no way for a trader to instanta-
neously buy or sell, in one fell swoop, hundreds of stocks or bonds. Because
they trade both during market hours and, in some cases, after market hours,
ETFs made that possible.
Institutional investors also found other things to like about ETFs. For exam-
ple, ETFs are often used to quickly put cash to productive use or to fill gaps
in a portfolio by allowing immediate exposure to an industry sector or geo-
graphic region.
25
Chapter 2: What the Heck Is an ETF, Anyway?

Savoring the versatility
ETFs, unlike mutual funds, can also be purchased with limit, market, or stop-
loss orders, taking away the uncertainty involved with placing a buy order for
a mutual fund and not knowing what price you’re going to get until several
hours after market close. See the sidebar “Your basic trading choices (for ETFs
or stocks)” if you’re not certain what limit, market, and stop-loss orders are.
And because ETFs can be sold short, they provide an important means of risk
management. If, for example, the stock market takes a dive, shorting ETFs —
selling them now at a locked-in price with an agreement to purchase them
back (cheaper) later on — may help keep a portfolio afloat. For that reason,
ETFs have become a darling of hedge fund managers who offer the promise
of investments that won’t tank should the stock market tank. See Chapter 18
for more information on this topic.
26
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 
Your basic trading choices (for ETFs or stocks)
Buying and selling an ETF is just like buying and
selling a stock. There is really no difference.
Although there are all sorts of ways to trade, the
vast majority of trades fall into these categories:
 Market order: This is as simple as it gets.
You place an order with your broker or
online to buy, say, 100 shares of a certain
ETF. Your order goes to the stock exchange,
and you get the best available price.
 Limit order: More exact than a market
order, you place an order to buy, say, 100
shares of an ETF at $23 a share. That is the
price you will pay. If no sellers are willing to
sell at $23 a share, your order will not go
through. If you place a limit order to sell at
$23, you’ll get your sale if someone is will-
ing to pay that price. If not, there will be no
sale.
 Stop-loss (or stop) order: Designed to pro-
tect you should the price of your ETF or
stock take a tumble, a stop-loss order goes
into effect when your ETF falls beneath a
certain point. At that point (say 10 percent
below the current price), your order auto-
matically turns into a market order. Stop-
loss orders can serve to limit your exposure
to a falling market.
 Short sale: You sell shares of an ETF that
have been borrowed from the broker. If the
price of the ETF then falls, you can buy
replacement shares at a lower price and
pocket the spread. If, however, the price
rises, you are stuck holding a security that
is worth less than its market price, so you
lose.

Why Individual Investors are
Learning to Love ETFs
Clients I’ve worked with are often amazed that I can put them into a financial
product that will cost them a fraction in expenses compared to what they
are currently paying. Low cost is probably the thing I love most about ETFs.
But I also love their tax efficiency, their transparency (you know what you’re
buying), and a long track record of success for indexed investments.
The cost advantage: 
How low can you go?
In the world of mutual funds, the average management fee at present, accord-
ing to Morningstar, is 1.67 percent (of the account balance) annually. That
may not sound like a lot of money, but it is a very substantial sum. A well-
balanced portfolio with both stocks and bonds may return, say, 8 percent
over time. In that case, paying 1.67 percent to a third party means that
you’ve just lowered your total investment returns by about 20 percent.
On a bad year, where your investments earn, say, 1.67 percent, you’ve just
lowered your investment returns to zero. And on a very bad year . . . You
don’t need me to do the math.
I’m astounded at what some mutual funds charge. Whereas the average is
1.67 percent, I’ve seen charges 10 times that amount. Crazy. Investing in such
a fund is tossing money to the wind. Yet people do it. The chances of your
winding up ahead after paying such high fees are next to nil. Paying a load
(either an entrance or exit fee) that can total as much as 8.50 percent is just
as nutty. Yet people do it.
In the world of ETFs, the expenses are much, much lower, averaging 0.40
percent, and many of the more traditional domestic indexed ETFs cost no
more than 0.20 percent a year in management fees. A handful are under
0.10 percent.
Some fees, as you can see in Table 2-2, are so low as to be negligible. Each
ETF in this table has a yearly management expense of 0.12 percent or less.

Numerous studies have shown that low-cost funds have a huge advantage
over higher-cost funds. One study by Morningstar looked at stock returns
over the five-year period ended December 2001. In almost every category
of stock mutual fund, low-cost funds beat the pants off high-cost funds.
You think that by paying high fees you’re getting better fund management?
Hardly. The Morningstar study found, for example, that among mutual funds
that hold large blend stocks (blend meaning a combination of value and
growth), the annualized gain was 8.75 percent for those funds in the costliest
quartile of funds; the gain for the least costly quartile was 9.89 percent.
The reasons ETFs are cheaper
The management companies that bring us ETFs, such as Barclays and
PowerShares, are presumably not doing so for their health. No, they’re
making a good profit. One reason they can offer ETFs so cheap compared
to mutual funds is that their expenses are much less. When you buy an ETF,
you go through a brokerage house, not Barclays or PowerShares. That bro-
kerage house (Charles Schwab, Merrill Lynch, Fidelity, TD AMERITRADE)
does all the necessary paperwork and bookkeeping on the purchase. If you
have any questions about your money, you’ll likely call Schwab, not Barclays.
So unlike a mutual fund company, which must maintain telephone operators,
bookkeepers, and a mailroom, the providers of ETFs can operate almost
entirely in cyberspace.
To boot, ETFs are linked to indexes, which means they have to pay some kind
of fee to Dow Jones or Morgan Stanley or whoever created the index. But that
fee is nothing compared to the exorbitant salaries that mutual funds pay their
stock pickers, er, market analysts.
28
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

An unfair race
Active mutual funds really don’t have much chance of beating passive index
funds — whether mutual funds or ETFs — over the long run. Someone once
described the contest as a race in which the active mutual funds are “running
with lead boots.” Why? In addition to the management fees that eat up much
of any gains, there are also the trading costs. Yes, when mutual funds trade
stocks or bonds, they pay a spread and a small cut to the stock exchange,
just like you and I do.
It’s been estimated that turnover costs for active mutual funds typically run
about 0.8 percent. And active mutual fund managers must constantly keep
some cash on hand for all those trades. Having cash on hand costs money, too:
There’s an opportunity cost, estimated to be in the ballpark of 0.4 percent.
So you take the 1.67 percent average management fee, and the 0.8 percent
hidden trading costs, and the 0.4 percent opportunity cost, and you can see
where the lead boots come in. Add taxes to the equation, and while some
actively managed mutual funds may do better than ETFs for a few years, over
the long haul I wouldn’t bank on many of them coming out ahead.
Uncle Sam’s loss, your gain
Alas, unless your money is in a tax-advantaged retirement account, making
money in the markets means that you have to fork something over to Uncle
Sam at year’s end. That’s true, of course, whether you invest in individual
securities or funds. But before there were ETFs, individual securities had a
big advantage over funds in that you were only required to pay capital gains
taxes when you actually enjoyed a capital gain. With mutual funds, that isn’t
so. The fund itself may enjoy a capital gain by selling off an appreciated
stock. You pay the capital gains tax regardless of whether you sell and regard-
less of whether the share price of the mutual fund increased or decreased
since the time you bought it.
There have been times (such as the year 2000) when many mutual fund
investors lost considerable amounts of money in the market yet had to pay
whopping capital gains tax at the end of the year. Talk about adding insult to
injury! One study found that over the course of time, taxes have wiped out
approximately 2 full percentage points for investors in the highest tax brackets.
In the world of ETFs, such losses are very unlikely to happen. Because ETFs
are index-based, there is generally little turnover to create capital gains. To
boot, ETFs are structured in a way that insulate shareholders from having to
pay capital gains tax, as mutual fund shareholders must often do, when other
shareholders cash in their chips.

Chapter 2: What the Heck Is an ETF, Anyway?

No tax calories
The structure of ETFs makes them different than mutual funds. Actually, ETFs
are legally structured in three different ways: as exchange-traded open-end
mutual funds, exchange-traded unit investment trusts, and exchange-traded
grantor trusts. The differences are subtle, and I elaborate on them somewhat
in Chapter 3 and throughout Part II. For now, I want to focus on one seminal
difference between ETFs and mutual funds, which boils down to an extremely
clever setup whereby ETF shares, which represent stock holdings, can be
traded without any actual trading of stocks. In a way it’s like those Olestra
potato chips that have no fat calories because the fat just passes through
your body.
Perhaps a better analogy is to the poker player who can play hands all night
and, thanks to the miracle of chips, not have to touch any cash.
Market makers and croupiers
In the world of ETFs, we don’t have croupiers, but we have market makers.
Market makers are people who work at the stock exchanges and create (like
magic!) ETF shares. ETF shares each represent a portion of a portfolio of
stocks, sort of like poker chips represent a pile of cash. As an ETF grows, so
does the number of shares. Concurrently (once a day), new stocks are added
to a portfolio that mirrors the ETF. See Figure 2-1, which may help you envi-
sion the structure of ETFs and what makes them such tax wonders.
When a shareholder of an ETF sells shares, those shares are sold, through the
market markers, to other ETF investors. By contrast, with mutual funds, if
one person sells, the mutual fund must sell off shares of stock. If those stocks
sold in the mutual fund are being sold for more than the original purchase
30
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 
Capital gains, investor pains
If you hold a mutual fund, and that fund sells
shares for more than the purchase price of the
shares, you, as an existing shareholder, will likely
get slapped with a capital gains tax. How much
that tax will be depends on several factors:
 The 5 percent rate. Eligibility: You are in the
10 percent and 15 percent federal income
tax brackets, and the capital gains you’ve
incurred come from selling investment
securities held for more than one year.
 The 15 percent rate. Eligibility: You are in the
25 percent federal income tax bracket or
higher, and the capital gains you’ve
incurred come from selling investment
securities held for more than one year.
 Rates as high as 35 percent. Suckerability:
The capital gains come from selling invest-
ment securities held for less than one year,
in which case you will be taxed at the same
rate you are taxed for regular (job) income.

price, the shareholders left behind are stuck paying a capital gains tax. In
some years, that amount can be substantial. In 2000, for example, when lots
of people were cashing out of mutual funds, the average mutual fund holder
paid almost $7 in tax for every $100 invested.
In the world of ETFs, no such thing has happened or is likely to happen.
Because of ETFs’ poker-chip structure, Barclays, the biggest player in the
ETF arena, just claimed four years straight in which none of its 110 ETFs —
domestic or international — issued a single dollar in capital gains. That’s
not a guarantee that there will never be capital gains, but if there ever are,
they are sure to be minor.
Tax efficient does not mean tax-free. Although you won’t pay capital gains
taxes, you will pay taxes on any dividends issued by your ETFs, and ETFs
are just as likely to issue dividends as are mutual funds. In addition, if you
sell your ETFs and they are in a taxable account, you have to pay capital
gains tax (15 percent for most folks) if the ETFs have appreciated in value
since the time you bought them.
Taxes on earnings, of course, aren’t an issue if your money is held in a tax-
advantaged account, such as a Roth IRA. I love Roth IRAs! Much more on that
when I get into retirement accounts in Chapter 19.

Chapter 2: What the Heck Is an ETF, Anyway?

What you see is what you get
A key to building a successful portfolio, right up there with low costs and tax
efficiency, is diversification, a subject I discuss more in Chapter 4. You cannot
diversify optimally unless you know exactly what’s in your portfolio. In a
rather infamous example, when tech stocks (some more than others) started
to go belly up in 2000, holders of Janus mutual funds got clobbered especially
badly. That’s because they learned after the fact that their three or four Janus
mutual funds, which gave the illusion of diversification, were actually holding
many of the same stocks.
With a mutual fund, you often have little idea of what stocks the fund man-
ager is holding. In fact, you may not even know what kinds of stocks he is
holding. Or even if he is holding stocks! I’m talking here about style drift, the
mutual fund manager who portends to be aggressive and is conservative, or
portends to be conservative and is aggressive. I’m talking about the mutual
fund manager who says he loves large value but invests in large growth or
small value.
One classic case of style drift cost investors in the all-popular Fidelity
Magellan Fund a bundle. The year was 1996, and fund manager Jeffrey Vinik
reduced the stock holdings in his “stock” mutual fund to 70 percent. He had
30 percent of the fund’s assets in either bonds or short-term securities. He
was betting that the market was going to sour, and he was planning to fully
invest in stocks after that happened. He was dead wrong. Instead, the market
continued to soar, bonds took a dive, Fidelity Magellan seriously underper-
formed, and Vinik was out.
Style drift: An epidemic
One study by the Association of Investment Management concluded that a
full 40 percent of actively managed mutual funds are not what they say they
are. Some funds bounce around in style so much that an investor would have
almost no idea where her money was. The Parnassus Fund, for example, was
once placed by Morningstar in the small cap blend category. Then it moved
to small cap value. Later it moved to mid cap blend. Later yet, the fund was
reclassified as mid cap growth.
ETFs are the cure
When you buy an ETF, you get complete transparency. You know exactly what
you are buying. No matter what the ETF, you can see on the prospectus or on
the ETF provider’s Web site (or on any number of independent financial Web
sites) a complete picture of the ETF’s holdings. See, for example, either
www.etfconnect.com or http://finance.yahoo.com. If I go to either
Web site and type the letters IYE (the ticker for the iShares Dow Jones U.S
Energy sector ETF) in the box in the upper right of screen, I can see in an
instant what my holdings are. You can see too, in Table 2-3.

You simply can’t get that information on most actively managed mutual funds.
Transparency also discourages dishonesty
The scandals that have rocked the mutual fund world have left the world of
ETFs untouched. There’s not a whole lot of manipulation that a fund manager
can do when his picks are tied to an index. And because ETFs trade through-
out the day, with the price flashing across thousands of computer screens
worldwide, there is no room to take advantage of the “stale” pricing that
occurs when the markets close and mutual fund orders are settled. All in all,
ETF investors are much, much less likely to ever get bamboozled than are
investors in active mutual funds.
The index advantage
The triumph of indexed mutual funds and ETFs over actively managed funds
is also leading people to ETFs. Index funds (which buy and hold a fixed col-
lection of stocks or bonds) consistently outperform actively managed funds.
One study done by Fulcrum Financial tracked mutual fund performance over
10 years and found that 81 percent of value funds underperformed the
indexes, as did 63 percent of growth funds.
33
Chapter 2: What the Heck Is an ETF, Anyway?

Here are some reasons that index funds (both mutual funds and ETFs) are
hard to beat:
 They typically carry much lower management fees, sales loads, or
redemption charges.
 Hidden costs — trading costs and spread costs — are much lower when
little trading is done.
 They don’t have cash sitting around idle (as the manager waits for what
he thinks is the right time to enter the market).
Perhaps the greatest testament to the success of index funds is how many
allegedly actively managed funds are actually index funds in (expensive) dis-
guise. I’m talking about closet index funds. According to a recent report in
Investment News, a newspaper for financial advisers, the number of actively
managed stock funds that are closet index funds has tripled over the past
four years. As a result, many investors are paying high (active) management
fees for investment results that could be achieved with low-cost ETFs.
R squared is a measurement of how closely a fund’s performance correlates
with an index. It can range from 0.00 to 1.00. An R squared of 1.00 indicates
perfect correlation: When the index goes up x percent, the fund goes up x per-
cent; when the index falls y percent, the fund falls y percent. An R squared of
0.00 indicates no correlation. This measurement is used to assess tracking
error or closet index funds.
According to Morningstar data as interpreted by Investment News, nearly 28
percent of all large cap funds carry a three-year R squared of 0.95 or higher
relative to the S&P 500 stock index. That kind of R squared makes them
closet index funds. And if you look at the entire mutual fund industry, it is
apparent that the triumph of indexing is becoming well known. At year end
2004, the average large cap fund had an R squared of almost 0.90. That
number is up from 0.74 only four years earlier.
Getting the Professional Edge
I don’t know about you, but when I take the kids bowling and — as happens on
very rare occasion — I bowl a strike, I feel as if a miracle of Biblical proportions
has occurred. And then I turn on the television, stumble upon a professional
bowling tournament, and see guys for whom not bowling a strike is a rare
occurrence. The difference between amateur and professional bowlers is
huge. The difference between investment amateurs and investment profession-
als can be just as huge. But you can close much of that gap by using ETFs.
34
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

Consider a few impressive numbers
By investment professionals, Lord knows I’m not talking about stockbrokers
or insurance salesmen. I’m talking about the managers of foundations and
endowments with $1 billion or greater in invested assets. By amateurs, I’m
talking about the average U.S. investor with a few assorted and sundry
mutual funds in his 401(k).
Let’s compare the two: During the period 1984–2002, the U.S. stock market, as
measured by the S&P 500 Index, provided an annual rate of return of 12.2 per-
cent. Yet the average mutual fund investor, according to a study by Dalbar,
earned an annual rate of 2.6 percent over that same period, barely keeping up
with inflation. Why the pitiful returns? There are several reasons, but two
main ones:
 Mutual fund investors pay too much for their investments.
 They jump into hot funds in hot sectors when they’re hot and jump out
when those funds or sectors turn cold. (In other words, they are con-
stantly buying high and selling low.)
To give you an idea of the difference between amateurs and professionals,
consider this: For the period 2003–2005, during which the S&P provided an
annual rate of return of 14.38 percent, the average return of managers of foun-
dations and endowments with assets greater than $1 billion was 14.75 percent.
You can do what they do!
Professional managers, you see, don’t pay high expenses. They don’t jump in
and out of funds. They know that they need to diversify. They tend to buy
indexes. They know exactly what they own. And they know that asset alloca-
tion, not stock picking, is what drives long-term investment results. In short,
they do all the things that an ETF portfolio can do for you. So do it. Well,
maybe. . . . First read the rest of this chapter!
Do ETFs Belong in Your Life?
Okay, so on the plus side of ETFs we have ultra-low management expenses,
super tax efficiency, transparency, and a lot of fancy trading opportunities,
such as shorting, if you are so inclined. What about the negatives? In the sec-
tions that follow, I walk you through some other facts about ETFs that you
should consider before parting with your precious dollars.
35
Chapter 2: What the Heck Is an ETF, Anyway?

Calculating commissions
I talk a lot more about commissions when I compare and contrast various
brokerage houses in Chapter 3, but I want to give you a heads up here: You
have to pay a commission every time you buy and sell an ETF.
Here’s the good news: Trading commissions for stocks and ETFs (it’s the same
commission for either) have been dropping faster than the price of desktop
computers. What once would have cost you a bundle, now — if you trade
online, which you definitely should — is really pin money, perhaps as low as
$4 a trade. However, you can’t simply ignore trading commissions. They aren’t
always that low, and even $4 a pop can add up. In most cases, you shouldn’t
agonize over the cost of trading ETFs; merely keep an eye on them.
Moving money in a flash
The fact that ETFs can be traded throughout the day like stocks makes them,
unlike mutual funds, fair game for day-traders and institutional wheeler-
dealers. For the rest of us common folk, there isn’t much about the way that
ETFs are bought and sold that makes them especially valuable. Indeed, the
ability to trade throughout the day may make you more apt to do so, perhaps
selling or buying on impulse. As I discuss in detail in Chapter 17, impulsive
investing, although it can get your endorphins pumping, is generally not the
most profitable investing.
Making a sometimes tricky choice
In Parts II, III, and IV of this book, I give you lots of detailed information about
how to construct a portfolio that contains ETFs to meet your needs. Here, I
want to just whet your appetite with a couple very basic examples of deci-
sions you may be facing.
Say you have a choice between investing in an index mutual fund that
charges 0.15 percent a year and an ETF that tracks the same index and
charges the same amount. What should you invest in?
If your money is in a taxable account, go with the ETF, provided you are
investing at least a few thousand dollars and you plan to keep your money
invested for at least several years. If you’re investing less, and/or if you think
you may need to tap the money anytime soon, you are likely better off with
the index mutual fund.
36
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

But say you have, oh, $5,000 to invest in your IRA. (All IRA money is taxed as
income when you withdraw it in retirement, and therefore the tax efficiency
of securities held within an IRA isn’t an issue.) An ETF charges you a manage-
ment fee of 0.15 percent a year, and a comparable index mutual fund charges
0.35, but buying and selling the ETF will cost you $10 at either end. Now what
should you do?
The math isn’t difficult. The difference between 0.15 and 0.35 (0.20 percent)
of $5,000 is $10. It will take you one year to recoup your trading fee of $10. If
you factor in the cost of selling (another $10), it will take you about two years
to recoup your trading costs. At that point, the ETF will be your lower-cost
turtle, and the mutual fund your higher-cost hare.
In general, building an entire portfolio out of ETFs usually makes sense start-
ing in the ballpark of $50,000. Anything less than that, and you are most likely
better off with mutual funds or a mix of mutual funds and ETFs.
37
Chapter 2: What the Heck Is an ETF, Anyway?
The index mutual fund trap
Some brokerage houses, such as Vanguard and
Fidelity, offer wonderful low-cost index mutual
funds. But a problem with them is that you either
can’t buy them at other financial “supermar-
kets” (such as Charles Schwab or T. Rowe
Price), or you have to pay a substantial fee to
get into them. So building an entire portfolio of
index mutual funds can be tough. If you want
both Fidelity and Vanguard, you may be forced
to pay high fees or to open up separate
accounts at different supermarkets, which
means extra paperwork and hassle. With ETFs,
you can buy them anywhere, sell them any-
where, and keep them — even if they are ETFs
from several different providers — all parked in
the same brokerage house.

 Distinguishing between the exchanges
I
love to shop on Christmas Eve. It’s the only time the entire year when
men — husbands and boyfriends who finally realize that they need to buy
a gift, quick — outnumber women at the mall. I see these hulking figures,
some in bright orange hunting jackets, walking the halls of the Lehigh Valley
Mall, looking themselves like scared prey. “Where’s the lingerie?” they ask,
eyes to the ground.
Sometimes, when I suggest to a client that he buy a few ETFs for his portfolio, I
see the same look of dire trepidation. I need to reassure him that buying ETFs
isn’t all that difficult. In this chapter, I want to do the same thing for you.
This chapter is something of a shopper’s guide to ETFs — a mall directory, if
you will. I don’t suggest which ETFs to buy specifically (I will, I will — but
that’s for later chapters), but I show you where to find the good shops and
locate the best lingerie. I talk about the brokerage houses that allow you to
buy and sell ETFs; the financial institutions that create ETFs; the indexes that
the financial institutions model their ETFs after; and the exchanges where
millions of ETF shares are bought, sold, and borrowed each day.
Creating an Account for Your ETFs
You — you personally — can’t just buy a share of an ETF as you would buy,
say, a negligee. You need someone to actually buy it for you and hold it for
you. That someone is a broker, sometimes referred to as a brokerage house 
or a broker-dealer. Some broker-dealers, the really big ones, are sort of like

financial department stores or supermarkets where you can buy ETFs,
mutual funds, individual stocks and bonds, or fancier investment tools like
puts and calls. You’ll recognize, I’m sure, the names of such financial depart-
ment stores: Fidelity, Vanguard, TD AMERITRADE, and T. Rowe Price.
ETFs are usually traded just as stocks are traded. Same commissions. Mostly
the same rules. Same hours (generally 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Manhattan
Island time). Through your brokerage house, you can buy 1 share, 2 shares,
or 10,000 shares. Here’s one difference between ETFs and stocks: Although
people today rarely do it, you can sometimes purchase stocks directly from a
company, and you may even get a pretty certificate saying you own the stock.
(I think some companies still do that!) Not so with ETFs. Call Barclays or State
Street and ask to buy a share of an ETF, and they will tell you to go find your-
self a broker. Ask for a certificate, and . . . well, don’t even bother.
The first step then, prior to beginning your ETF shopping expedition, is to
find a brokerage house, preferably a financial department store where you
can keep all your various investments. It makes life a lot easier to have every-
thing in one place, to get one statement every month, and to see all your
investments on one computer screen.
Answering a zillion questions
The first question you have to answer when opening an account is whether
the account will be a retirement account or non-retirement account. If you
want a retirement account, you need to specify what kind (IRA? Roth IRA?
SEP?). I cover the ins and outs of retirement accounts — and how ETFs can fit
snuggly in the picture — in Chapter 19. A non-retirement account is a simpler
animal. You don’t need to know any special tax rules, and your money isn’t
committed for any time period unless you happen to stick something like a
CD into the account.
The next question you have to answer is whether you want to open a margin
account or a cash account. A margin account is somewhat similar to a check-
ing account with overdraw protection. It means that you can borrow from the
account or make purchases of securities (such as ETFs, but generally not
mutual funds) without actually having any cash to pay for them on the spot.
Cool, huh?
Unless you have a gambling addiction, go with margin. You never know when
you may need a quick (and, compared to credit cards, inexpensive) and
potentially tax-deductible loan. If you think you may have a gambling addic-
tion, read the sidebar “Don’t margin your house away!”
40
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

You’re also asked questions about beneficiaries and titling (or registration),
such as whether you want your joint account set up with rights of survivor-
ship. I’ll just say one quick word about naming your beneficiaries: Be certain
that who you name is who you want to receive your money if you die.
Beneficiary designations supercede your will. In other words, if your will says
that all your ETFs go to your spouse, and your beneficiary designation on
your account names someone else, your spouse loses; all the ETFs in your
account will go to someone else.
For more information on what happens to your assets when you die, I recom-
mend Estate Planning For Dummies by N. Brian Caverly, Esq. and Jordan S.
Simon (Wiley).
Finally, you’re asked all kinds of personal questions about your employment,
your wealth, and your risk tolerance. Don’t sweat them! Federal securities
regulations require brokerage houses to know something about their clients.
Honestly, I don’t think anyone ever looks at the personal section of the forms.
I’ve never heard any representative of any brokerage house so much as whis-
per any of the information included in those personal questions.
41
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Players
Don’t margin your house away!
I once had a client whose husband handled all
the finances. Then they divorced. Divorcing
couples usually split the family assets, but they
also split the liabilities. This woman had no idea,
until she divorced, that her hubbie had been
playing with stocks and ETFs, buying them on
margin. Suddenly, she inherited a rather enor-
mous debt. “Buying on margin” means that the
brokerage house is lending you money, and
charging you interest, so you can purchase
securities. Ouch. One of the often touted
“advantages” of ETFs is that you can buy them
on margin — something you often can’t do with
mutual funds. Margin buying is very dangerous
business. The fact that you can buy an ETF on
margin is not an advantage as I see it. The stock
market is risky enough. Don’t ever compound
that risk by borrowing money to invest. You may
wind up losing not only your nest egg but your
home. My client was able to save hers; not
everyone is so lucky.
Two things about margin you should know:
 The brokerage house can usually change
the rate of interest you’re paying without
notice.
 If your investments dip below a certain per-
centage of your margin loan, the brokerage
house can sell your stocks and bonds from
right under you.
It can be dangerous business. Margin only with
great caution.

Placing an order to buy
After your account is in place, which should take only a few days, you’re
ready to buy your first ETF. Most brokerage houses give you a choice: Call in
your order, or do it yourself online. Calling is typically much more expensive.
Being the savvy investor that you are, you’re not going to throw money away,
so place all your orders online! If you need help, a representative of the bro-
kerage house will walk you through the process step-by-step — at no expense
to you.
Keep in mind when trading ETFs that the cost of the trades, if substantial
enough, can nibble seriously into your holdings. Here’s how to avoid such
nibbling:
 Don’t trade often. Buy and hold, buy and hold, buy and hold! (See
Chapter 17.)
 Know your percentages. In general, don’t bother with ETFs if the trade
is going to cost you anything more than half of 1 percent. In other words,
if making the trade is going to cost you $10 (an average amount for an
online trade), you want to invest at least $2,000 at a pop. If you have
only $1,000 to invest, or less, you are often better off purchasing a no-
load mutual fund, preferably an index fund, or waiting until you’ve accu-
mulated enough cash to make a larger investment.
 Be a savvy shopper. Keep the cost of your individual trades to a mini-
mum by shopping brokerage houses for the lowest fees, placing all your
orders online, and arguing for the best deals. Yes, you can often negoti-
ate with these people for better deals, especially if you have substantial
bucks. Also know that many brokerage houses offer special incentives
for new clients: Move more than $50,000 in assets and get your first 20
trades for free, or that sort of thing. Always ask.
But wait just a moment!
Please don’t be so enthralled by anything you read in this book that you rush
out, open a brokerage account, and sell your existing mutual funds or stocks
and bonds to buy ETFs. Rash investment decisions almost always wind up to
be mistakes. Remember that whenever you sell a security, you may face seri-
ous tax consequences. (Vanguard offers a unique advantage here; see the
sidebar “The Vanguard edge” later in this chapter.) If you decide to sell cer-
tain mutual funds, annuities, or life insurance policies, there may also be
nasty surrender charges. If you’re unsure whether selling your present hold-
ings would make for a financial hit on the chin, talk to your accountant or
financial planner.

Introducing the Shops
I’ve read that the motorcycle industry boasts the highest level of consumer
loyalty in the United States. A Harley man would never be caught dead on a
Yamaha. Not being a motorcyclist, I have no idea why that is. In the world of
brokerage houses, after someone has a portfolio in place at a house such as
Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab, that client is often very hesitant to switch. 
I know exactly why that is: Moving your account can sometimes be a big,
costly, and time-consuming pain in the ass. So, whether you’re a Harley man
or a Yamaha mama with money to invest, it behooves you to spend some
serious time researching brokerage houses and to choose the one that will
work best for you. Perhaps I can help.
What to look for
Here are the some things you want from any broker who is going to be hold-
ing your ETFs:
 Reasonable prices
 Good service, meaning they pick up the phone without putting you
through voicemail hell
 A user-friendly Web site
 Good advice, if you think you’re going to need advice
 A service center near you, if you like doing business with real human
beings
 Incentives for opening an account, which can run the gamut from a cer-
tain number of free trades to laptop computers
 Financial strength
Financial strength really isn’t as important as the others because all broker-
age houses carry insurance. Still, a brokerage house that collapses under you
can be a hassle, and it may take time to recoup your money. See the sidebar
“Can you lose your ETFs if your brokerage house collapses?”
I give you my take on some of the major brokerage houses in just a moment,
but I first want to talk a bit about prices, which can be downright devilish to
compare and contrast.
43
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Players

A price structure like none other
Shopping for shoes? Beer? Pickled herring? Go to one store. Go to another
store. Or open up an issue of Consumer Reports. Compare the prices. Easy
business.
Comparing the prices at brokerage houses is anything but easy. Charles
Schwab, for example, may charge you $19.95 for an online trade, or it may
charge you $9.95 for the very same online trade, depending on how much
money you have in your account and how many trades you make per quarter.
At Fidelity, different criteria apply, including not only your portfolio balance
and number of quarterly trades but sometimes the number of shares you’re
trading at any particular point. At ShareBuilder, you can pay only $4 a trade,
but you need to commit to a schedule of regular trades that occur only on
Tuesdays. (That’s right, only on Tuesdays.) This is not easy business.
It would take me many pages to relay to you the complicated price structures
of the various brokerage houses. I’ll pass. Instead, in the following sections, I
give you a short summary of the pricing and then leave you to do some leg
work. Always look at the entire brokerage package. That includes not only
the price of trades but total account fees. You need to do some comparing
and contrasting on your own, but with the tools I give you in the following
sections, it shouldn’t take an eternity.

Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 
Can you lose your ETFs if your 
brokerage house collapses?
Brokerage houses, as part of their registration
process with the federal government, are auto-
matically insured through the Securities
Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Each
individual investor’s securities are protected up
to $500,000 should the brokerage house go belly
up. Larger brokerage houses generally carry
supplemental insurance that protects cus-
tomers’ account balances beyond the half-
million that SIPC covers. TD AMERITRADE, for
example, has insurance through Lloyd’s of
London that protects each customer’s account
up to $150 million.
Note: Neither SIPC coverage nor any kind of
supplemental insurance will protect the value
of your account from a market downfall! For
additional information on SIPC, you can order
the free brochure by calling 1-800-934-4448 or
checking out its Web site at www.sipc.org.

The Vanguard Group
I mention Vanguard frequently in this book for a number of reasons. For one, I
like Vanguard because of its leadership role in the world of index investing.
Vanguard is also the only investment house that serves as both custodian of
ETFs and is itself a provider of ETFs. (Okay, Fidelity has one ETF, but one
hardly counts.) There’s also “The Vanguard edge” (which I discuss in a side-
bar of that name later in this chapter). And — perhaps most important to the
theme of this book — Vanguard’s lineup of ETFs are top-notch products. But
more on that in a few pages. Right now, I’m here to discuss Vanguard as a
shop where you can buy and hold your ETFs.
Incidentally, buying and holding Vanguard ETFs at Vanguard offers no particu-
lar advantage over buying and holding those ETFs elsewhere. Vanguard the
shop and Vanguard the supplier should be assessed separately.
As for Vanguard the shop, the trading commissions are middle of the road,
and the service is middle of the road. What really shines about Vanguard is its
broad array of top-rate index mutual funds. I know, I know, this is a book about
ETFs. But index mutual funds and ETFs are close cousins, and sometimes it
makes a lot of sense to have both in a portfolio. (More on that in Chapter 15.)
If you do wish to hold Vanguard index mutual funds alongside your ETFs,
Vanguard is an awfully logical place to hold them because you can buy and
sell Vanguard funds, provided you don’t do it often, at no charge. At Fidelity, in
contrast, buying any Vanguard mutual fund will typically cost you $75.

Fidelity Investments
I like this brokerage house as well. In fact, I house my own ETFs at Fidelity.
The service, at least for me, is fabulous. (Okay, I admit it, I have a fair amount
of money there.) The price of trades at Fidelity is competitive. Like Vanguard,
Fidelity also has some excellent low-cost index funds of its own, which you
may wish to keep alongside your ETF portfolio. And the Fidelity Web site has
some really good tools — some of the best available — for analyzing your
portfolio and researching new investments.

Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Players

The last I heard, Fidelity was offering 25,000 miles on United Airlines to any
new customer opening a brokerage account with the company. By the time
this book appears in print, the company may be offering a year’s supply of
parsley, or Peter Lynch will come to your house and give you a leg wax, or
whatever.
Here’s a bit of insider information: The cost of Fidelity’s trades is based on
how much your household has invested at Fidelity. I have found Fidelity to be
quite liberal in its interpretation of household. If, for example, your parents,
your in-laws, your siblings, or your adult children have money at Fidelity, and
you ask a rep real nicely to include you under the same household, you may
be successful at saving some serious money. If he says no, call back the next
day, and hope to get another rep.

T. Rowe Price
This Baltimore-based shop has several claims to fame, including its bend-
over-backward friendliness to small investors and its plethora of really fine
financial tools, especially for retirement planning, available to all customers
at no cost. The price of trading is a wee bit higher than average. The service
is excellent (reps tend to be very chummy). If you decide that part of your
portfolio should be in mutual funds, you can do a lot worse than going with 
T. Rowe Price’s lineup of entirely load-free funds.

Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

TD AMERITRADE
For a number of years, TD Waterhouse and Ameritrade were known as the
discount kings of the brokerage biz. They recently merged into one company
called TD AMERITRADE. The trading prices at TD are just about middle of the
pack. Although I’ve never had occasion to work with TD, the service is reput-
edly quite high. The Web site has a very clean and crisp feel to it. On the
down side (in my opinion, of course), the TD culture and many of the articles
on the Web site promote frequent trading, as opposed to, say, Vanguard,
where the culture is decidedly more buy-and-hold. (The same two philoso-
phies exist among providers of ETFs, as I discuss shortly.)
At the moment I’m writing this sentence, if you invest $25,000 or more with
TD as a new customer, you qualify for a free Palm Treo 650 Smartphone and
25 free trades. I’m sure the freebies will come and go, but always be sure to
ask!

ShareBuilder
At an unheard-of $4 a trade, or even less if you’re willing to pay a monthly fee,
you can’t beat ShareBuilder for price. The catch is that you have to commit
to regular trades. You need to make trades (investing as little as $25) once a
week or once a month. And therein lies the problem.
If you’re putting in money once a week or once a month, chances are you’re
not putting in a whole lot. You’re a drib-and-drab investor, and drib-and-drab
investors, although certainly better off with ShareBuilder than most other
brokers, should be investing in mutual funds, not ETFs. Do the math. Even if
you are saving a very impressive $200 every week out of your paycheck, at 
$4 a trade, you’re losing 2 percent right off the top. That’s a chunk.
47
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Players

ShareBuilder, at the time of this writing, is offering seven free trades with
each new IRA account opened. As with the other brokerage houses, this deal
is subject to change, and probably will by the time you read this chapter. So
ask for the special deal of the day, whatever that may be.

Other major brokerage houses
The five houses I discuss in the previous sections aren’t the only players in
town. Here are a few more to consider:
 Charles Schwab: 866-232-9890; www.schwab.com. I’ve never liked
Schwab because of its high trading costs, but just as I was writing this
chapter, the firm lowered its fees across the board.
 eTrade: 800-387-2331; www.etrade.com. Not only can you house your
ETFs with eTrade, but you can refinance the mortgage on your house, as
well.
 TIAA-CREF: 800-842-2776; www.tiaa-cref.org. I’ve heard pretty good
things about TIAA, but I can’t work with them directly because I’m not a
teacher. This brokerage house works only with people who have chalk
under their nails. (If you’re married to someone with chalk under the
nails, you qualify, too.)
Presenting the Suppliers
There are dozens and dozens of mutual fund providers. Some of the firms
may offer just one fund, and they sometimes give the feeling that the entire
business is run out of someone’s garage. Not so with ETFs. There are only a
few providers, and they tend to be large companies. Why is that? In part
because the operating expenses are so low that a company can’t profit unless
it has the economies of scale and the multiple incomes that offering a bevy of
ETFs provides. Like your favorite professional sports team, clothing store, or
political party, each supplier of ETFs has its own personality.
48
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

It’s okay to mix and match
I want to emphasize that while picking a single brokerage house to manage
your accounts makes enormous sense, there is no reason that you can’t own
ETFs from different sources. A portfolio with a combination of Barclays,
Vanguard, and State Street ETFs can work just fine. In fact, I would recom-
mend not wedding yourself to a single ETF supplier but being flexible and
picking the best ETFs to meet your needs in each area of your portfolio.
(Note that brokerage houses typically do not sell all mutual funds. But I’ve
never heard of a brokerage house being picky and choosy about what ETFs it
will sell. The reason is simple: When you buy or sell an ETF, you pay a trading
fee directly to the brokerage house. Because brokerage houses are in the
business of making money, the more ETFs they can offer, the merrier.)
Table 3-1 offers a handy reference to the largest ETF providers, which I intro-
duce you to in a moment.

Check your passport
Just a quick word for you readers who live outside the United States: All ETFs
(and mutual funds) sold in the United States must be approved by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Other countries have their equivalent
governmental regulatory authorities. None of the ETFs listed in this section
or in Part II of this book are sold beyond the borders of the United States.
49
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Players

Some of the ETF providers mentioned — particularly Barclays — do sell ETFs
in other countries, but they go by different names (iShares in Canada are
known as iUnits), and they likely have different structures.
Barclays iShares
When I was a very young man traveling the world with my backpack and
sleeping bag, I always carried a packet of beautiful baby-blue Barclays
Traveller’s Cheques. When I returned home to the States, and for many years
thereafter, I hardly came across the Barclays name. Then along came ETFs,
and now Barclays is, once again, a part of my life.
With 116 ETFs for sale and $150 billion in ETF assets, Barclays Global
Investors is not only one of the largest investment banks in the world ($1.3
trillion in assets under management); it is far and away the largest player in
the ETF game. Barclays ETFs, known as iShares, offer the broadest selection.
You can buy iShares that track the major S&P indexes for growth and value,
large and small cap stocks. Other equity ETFs track the major Russell and
Morningstar indexes. You can also find industry sector ETFs from technology
and healthcare to financial services and software.
In the international arena, you can buy an ETF to track either an interconti-
nental index, such as the MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australia, Far East), or much
narrower markets, such as the Malaysian or Brazilian stock market. To date,
Barclays is the only supplier of fixed-income (bond) ETFs, with six offerings
ranging from long-term Treasury bonds to inflation-protected bonds (TIPS) to
corporate bonds.
Management fees vary from a low of 0.09 percent for the iShares S&P 500
(IVV) to a high of 0.75 percent for the MSCI Emerging Markets fund (EEM),
with an average of 0.30 percent.
Russell’s review: You can’t go too wrong with Barclays. My only beef is with
the price of some of the international funds where Barclays has thus far had a
monopoly. On the other hand, the firm has done an outstanding job of track-
ing indexes and offering variety. It has done a good job of maintaining tax effi-
ciency. I caution you, however, not to get sucked into the iShares candy store.
Some of the ETFs track very small markets and market segments and clearly
don’t belong in most people’s portfolios. I do not suggest, for example, that
you stock up on the MSCI Malaysia fund.

Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

State Street Global Advisers (SSgA)
streetTRACKS, SPDRs, and Dow Industrial
DIAMONDS
State Street’s flagship ETF, the first ETF on the U.S. market, is the SPDR 500
(SPY). Traded on the American Stock Exchange, it boasts almost $60 billion
in net assets, well more than twice the assets of any other ETF on the market.
I suspect that will change over time, but for now, SSgA’s pet spider gives it a
firm perch as the second-largest provider of ETFs. State Street’s ETFs follow
traditional indexes, carry reasonable fees, and are varied enough to allow for
a very well diversified portfolio, at least on the domestic equity side. All told,
SSgA’s 42 U.S.-based ETFs hold about $70 billion in assets.
Russell’s review: The management expenses — 0.27 percent on average —
are extremely reasonable, and I like the variety of funds except for the lack of
international and fixed income. The Select Sector SPDRs offer a very efficient
way of investing in various industry sectors (if that’s your kind of thing). The
Web sites are topnotch, and the SPDRs Web site in particular — www.spdr
index.com — offers some fabulous portfolio-construction tools, such as the
Correlation Tracker, which allows you to find ETFs that best compliment your
existing portfolio.
One drawback to SSgA’s offerings, however, is the legal structure of some of
its ETFs. The oldest ETFs, such as the SPDRs and DIAMONDS, are set up as
unit investment trusts rather than as open-end mutual funds as most ETFs
are. That means they can’t reinvest dividends on a regular basis, which can
create a cash drag, bringing down long-term total returns by a smidgen and a
half. (It’s hard to actually measure the impact.)
For more information, call 866-787-2257 or visit www.streettracks.net or
www.spdrindex.com.
PowerShares
PowerShares hesitates to call its 37 ETFs “actively managed” and instead
calls them ETFs with “enhanced indexes” or “strategy indexes.” Or, to use the
company’s own jargon, it calls them “Intellidexes.” The Intellidexes, custom-
made indexes produced jointly by PowerShares and the American Stock
Exchange, represent “a modified equal weight portfolio” that is “rebalanced
and reconstituted quarterly.”
51
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Players

Reconstituted. Hmmm. That means considerable turnover and some added
trading expenses. It also means that if you choose PowerShares ETFs to build
your portfolio, you are no longer an index investor, which (judging by wads
and wads of historical data) puts you at something of a disadvantage. 
The company has been quite innovative in its offering of market sectors.
Several are offered by no one else. The Water Resources ETF (PHO), for exam-
ple, allows you to invest in a “group of companies that focus on the provision
of potable water.” And the WilderHill Clean Energy Fund (PBW) allows you to
invest in “companies that focus on greener and generally renewable sources
of energy.”
Russell’s review: I’m not a big fan of active management, but if you insist on
going there, PowerShares ETFs may be a good option. Thus far, the firm has
been very good at avoiding capital gains taxes, and with average manage-
ment expenses of 0.60 percent, the funds are still cheap when compared to
actively managed mutual funds. Some of the market segments created by
PowerShares, such as the two mentioned in the previous paragraph, are
intriguing, especially if they prove over time to show limited correlation to
the rest of the stock market. Still, Water Resources should not make up the
lion’s share of anyone’s portfolio.
For more information, call 800-843-2639 or visit www.powershares.com.
Vanguard ETFs
It goes without saying that these people know something about index invest-
ing. In 1976, Vanguard launched the first consumer index mutual fund, the
Vanguard Index Trust–500 Portfolio. (Wells Fargo already had an index fund,
but it was available only to endowments and other such institutions.) In 2001,
Vanguard launched its first ETF. Why Vanguard wasn’t exactly in the vanguard
is anyone’s guess, but by the time Vanguard ETFs (which they used to call
VIPERs) were introduced to the market, Barclays had already taken a solid
lead. But Vanguard ETFs, largely due to their incredibly low costs, are quickly
moving up. As of this writing, the 24 ETFs hold $14 billion in assets — an
increase of 22 percent over the previous year.
How low is low? The lowest-cost Vanguard ETF — the Vanguard Total Stock
Market ETF (VTI) — sets you back 0.07 percent in total management
expenses a year. (That’s 70 cents per $1,000 invested.) As far as I know, that
may be the lowest cost noninstitutional investment vehicle anywhere in the
world.
52
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

Russell’s review: I love Vanguard’s low costs. (Who wouldn’t?) And their
lineup of ETFs, in line with Vanguard’s personality, is sensible and direct.
They use reasonable indexes, track them well, and take the utmost care to
avoid capital gains taxes and make certain that all dividends paid are quali-
fied dividends so they are taxed at a lower rate. My only problem with
Vanguard is the firm’s long-standing reluctance to do anything more than
dabble in overseas markets. But the few Vanguard international ETFs you can
choose from are excellent choices, and if that isn’t enough, there’s no reason
you can’t choose Vanguard ETFs for the domestic side of your portfolio and
Barclays for the international. (More on investing overseas in Chapter 10.)
For more information, call 800-992-8327 or visit www.vanguard.com.
53
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Players
The Vanguard edge
If you own a Vanguard mutual fund and you
want to convert to the Vanguard ETF that tracks
the same index, you can do so without any tax
ramifications. The conversion is tax-free
because you will actually be exchanging one
class of shares for another class of shares, all
within the same fund. You can do this only with
Vanguard ETFs. Vanguard actually has a U.S.
patent that gives it a monopoly on this share
structure.
For example, if you own shares in the Vanguard
Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX), and
you decide that you want to exchange them for
the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), you
can do so and not worry about having to take
any tax hit. You will, however, need to pay the
Vanguard conversion fee of $50. (This fee is
waived for Vanguard “Flagship” clients, those
with $1 million or more invested with Vanguard.)
So should you do it? The expense ratio on the
mutual fund is 0.19. The expense ratio on the
ETF is 0.07. If you have, say, $20,000 in the
account, moving from the mutual fund to the ETF
will save you $24 a year in management fees.
And the conversion may also possibly save you
a dollar or two a year in taxes. It would be worth
your trouble to make the exchange only if you
were looking to keep your investment for more
than a couple of years.
Note that the tax-free transfer works only the
one way. If you have ETF shares that have
appreciated in value, you can’t convert those
shares to mutual fund shares without incurring
a capital gains tax (unless you have them in a
retirement account).

WisdomTree
WisdomTree Investments out of New York, with some fairly big-gun backers,
issued 20 ETFs in June 2006. Rumor has it that the company has filed applica-
tions with the Securities and Exchange Commission to produce at least six
more. All 20 WisdomTree ETFs have the word dividend in them. You can buy
the WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend Fund (DLN), the WisdomTree SmallCap
Dividend Fund (DES), or the WisdomTree International Dividend Top 100
Fund (DOO).
Russell’s review: DOO? WisdomTree? It sounds like a remedial reading
course for middle-school students. And where does this dividend fetish come
from? I hope for this company’s sake that dividend investing proves prof-
itable moving forward, but I have my doubts. More on that subject in Chapter
11. My favorite WisdomTree ETF is the WisdomTree International SmallCap
Dividend Fund (DLS) because it opens up an entirely new asset class (small
international) to the world of ETFs. I haven’t used it in any portfolios yet, but
I well may. But would I ever build an entire portfolio of WisdomTree dividend
ETFs? Not likely. It would be a little like taking a remedial reading class and
studying only the vowels.
For more information, call 866-909-9473 or visit www.wisdomtree.com.
ProShares
ProShares offers 12 ETFs. The Short QQQ ProShares (PSQ) allows you to short
the NASDAQ-100: If the NASDAQ goes down 10 percent, your ETF goes up
(more or less) 10 percent. Of course, the inverse is true, as well. Other
ProShares offerings allow you to short the Dow, the S&P 500, or the S&P
MidCap 400. The Ultra ProShares are four ETFs that allow you to move with
the market at double the speed. Ultra QQQ ProShares (QLD), for example,
tends to rise 20 percent when the NASDAQ-100 goes up 10 percent and to fall
20 percent when the NASDAQ-100 goes down 10 percent. All these percent-
ages are rough approximations. In the real world, you’re going to get less
money than you bargain for and more risk than you hoped for.
Russell’s review: I’m not too hot on the strategies these ETFs employ, to say
the least. In short, selling short is akin to market timing, and market timing,
while loads of fun, isn’t often profitable. As for the less-than-double-your-
money, more-than-double-your-risk ProShares Ultra ETFs, well . . . excuse me
while I take a minute to scratch my head and try to figure out the logic in
that. See my discussion of both strategies in Chapter 11. 
For more information, call 866-776-5125 or visit www.proshares.com.
54
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

Rydex
With nine ETFs and a bunch more awaiting approval from the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Rydex is an interesting company with an unusual mix
of products. One company spokesperson describes his company as “oriented
toward tactical investors.” In other words, Rydex’s ETFs, which total about
$2.1 billion in net assets, are largely designed for people who are unhappy
buying the usual indexes and want to take something of a gamble on a partic-
ular equity style, such as large growth stocks. For such an investor, Rydex
offers its customized S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Growth ETF. Using a proprietary
seven factors to determine which stocks among the S&P 500 are the most
“growthy,” Rydex bundles them into a package that promises purity for the
gung-ho growth investor. They’ll do the same for you on the other side if you
are a gung-ho value investor. Heeeeyaaaaa!
If you want to gamble that the Euro is about to go on a tear, you can buy
Rydex’s Euro Currency Trust exchange-traded product — not quite an ETF,
but almost. And perhaps most intriguing of all Rydex’s investment products,
the firm offers an innovative Rydex S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), which,
just like it sounds, offers you an opportunity to invest in the S&P 500 with all
company stocks represented in equal allocations (as opposed to the more
traditional value-weighted method of allocation).
Russell’s review: At 0.30 percent as the average management expense, Rydex
funds aren’t all that pricey. So far, they’ve been relatively tax efficient, despite
fairly high turnover for ETFs. And the performance record has been impres-
sive for the short time that Rydex funds have been around. Nonetheless, I do
not like currency gambling, and gambling is what it is. There is simply no way
to know which way the Euro is going vis-à-vis the dollar. As for the “pure”
funds, I find them intriguing, but at the time of this writing, they’ve been in
existence only for several months, and I’d like to see some kind of track
record before recommending them. Even though Rydex caters to the “tactical
investor,” its pure funds may wind up being a good vehicle for long-term buy-
and-hold types like me. Time will tell. The S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is defi-
nitely worth some serious consideration, especially for smaller investors, and
I look at that much more closely in Chapter 5.
For more information, call 800-820-0888 or visit www.rydexfunds.com.
Other suppliers
Brokerage biggie Merrill Lynch produces Holding Company Depository
Receipts (HOLDRS). They aren’t ETFs per se, but they are so much like ETFs
that they may as well be. HOLDRS are baskets of stocks that Merrill says 
55
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Players

represent a certain industry, like pharmaceuticals or telecommunications.
HOLDRS are strange beasts that must be bought and sold in lots of 100
shares. They can also be very concentrated; in some cases, two or three com-
panies make up 50 percent or more of the net assets. For those reasons, I
don’t generally recommend HOLDRS for most investors. For more informa-
tion, visit www.holdrs.com.
HOLDRS shouldn’t be confused with BLDRS, which are true ETFs adminis-
tered by the Bank of New York. BLDRS — there are four of them — are collec-
tions of American Depository Receipts (ADRs), foreign companies whose
stock trades on U.S. exchanges. BLDRS are rather thinly traded (that’s indus-
try jargon for “they aren’t all that popular”), but, in fact, they should be con-
sidered as viable alternatives for the international equity side of your
portfolio. BLDRS trade on the NASDAQ, whereas most ETFs trade on either
the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange. For more
information, visit www.bldrsfunds.com.
Fidelity Investments is the number one or number two U.S. brokerage house,
neck-in-neck with Vanguard the past couple of years. However, it produces
only one ETF, the Fidelity NASDAQ Composite ETF (ONEQ), which tracks
companies listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market. For more information, visit
www.fidelity.com.
Familiarizing Yourself with the Indexers
At the core of every ETF is an index. The index is the blueprint upon which
the ETF is built. Some ETF providers use old, established indexes. Others
create their own, often in conjunction with seasoned indexers. (That associa-
tion helps them get approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.)
As a rule, for an ETF to be any good, it has to be based on a good index. On
the other hand, a good index doesn’t guarantee a good ETF because other
things, like costs and tax efficiency, matter as well. That being said, I turn
now to the five indexers that create and recreate the indexes upon which
about 95 percent of all ETFs are based.
Standard & Poors
Owned by publishing powerhouse McGraw-Hill, Standard & Poors is perhaps
best known for its credit rating services. The company also maintains hun-
dreds of indexes, including the S&P 500 (the one you’re most likely to see
flashed across your television screen at any hour of the day). Over $1 trillion
in investors’ assets are directly tied to S&P indexes — more than all other
index providers combined.
56
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

More ETFs are based on S&P indexes than any other. Those include the
Barclays broad-based international ETFs, the Select Sector SPDRs that 
track various market segments, and the iShares S&P Growth and Value series
of ETFs.
For more information, visit www.standardandpoors.com.
Dow Jones
If there were an index for the price of peanuts in Portugal, Dow Jones would
do it. The company, aside from publishing The Wall Street Journal and
Barron’s, develops, maintains, and licenses over 3,000 market indexes. Those
indexes include the world’s best known stock indicator, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, which, in my opinion, should have long ago gone the way
of the Edsel. (I explain why in Chapter 5.)
The iShares industry and sector ETFs are based on Dow Jones indexes, as are
the streetTRACKS large, mid, and small cap ETFs.
For more information, visit www.djindexes.com.
Morgan Stanley Capital International
With indexes of all kinds — stocks, bonds, hedge funds, U.S. and international
securities — Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), although not quite
a household name, has been gaining ground as the indexer of choice for
many ETF providers.
MSCI indexes are the backbone of both the domestic and international
Vanguard ETFs, as well as the Barclays iShares individual country ETFs.
For more information, visit www.msci.com.
Russell
The largest 1,000 U.S. stocks are in the Russell 1000, although that index
remains relatively obscure because the Dow Industrial and the S&P 500 hog
the spotlight when it comes to measuring large cap performance. The next
2,000 largest stocks on the U.S. market are in the Russell 2000. And the
Russell 1000 plus the Russell 2000 make up the Russell 3000. Those are
Russell’s more popular indexes, but there are plenty of others as well.

Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Players

A dozen of the iShares domestic ETFs are based on Russell indexes. So, too,
is the Rydex Russell Top 50 Index.

Lehman Brothers
Yeah, I know it sounds like a clothing shop in Brooklyn, but Lehman Brothers
is actually the world’s leading provider of fixed income benchmarks.
Barclays iShares uses Lehman Brothers indexes for five of its six fixed-
income ETFs.

Meeting the Middlemen
In the beginning, most ETFs were traded on the American Stock Exchange. In
July 2005, however, Barclays decided to move its primary listings for 81 of its
iShares to the New York Stock Exchange, citing superior technology. As a
result, about half of all ETFs today are listed on each of the two major
exchanges, with a small handful listed on the NASDAQ.
Does it matter to you on which exchange your ETF is listed? No, not really,
except to the extent that the stock exchanges love ETFs, and if you are an
ETF investor, they will love you. The reason is fairly obvious: The stock
exchanges make their money whenever there’s an exchange. Mutual funds,
per se, don’t exchange. ETFs do. And in order to promote ETFs, the stock
exchanges have some fairly cool stuff on their Web sites that you should
know about.
American Stock Exchange
The AMEX lists roughly 1,350 securities and has a daily trading volume of
about 83 million shares. This is the exchange that pioneered the creation and
sale of ETFs in the United States, and ETFs remain a big part of the
exchange’s business today. Even though in raw numbers the AMEX and the
New York Stock Exchange list about equal numbers of ETFs (about 100), the
AMEX is a much smaller exchange, and some of its ETFs — especially the
SPDR 500 (SPY) — are much bigger. As a result, the future of the American
Stock Exchange and the future of ETFs may be somewhat intertwined.
58
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

ETFs currently listed on the AMEX include the iShares Russell and S&P 
Global ETFs, as well as all the iShares fixed income ETFs. Nearly all offerings
by Vanguard, Rydex, and PowerShares are also listed on the AMEX, as well as
Merrill Lynch’s HOLDRS.
The Web site is www.amex.com. If you click on the ETF icon and then on
Research and Tools, it takes you to an ETF screener and several other poten-
tially helpful tools.
New York Stock Exchange
Tracing its origins to 1792, the New York Stock Exchange today lists nearly
2,700 securities and trades about 1.5 billion shares a day. Many of the
member companies are among the largest in the United States. All together,
New York Stock Exchange companies represent over three-quarters of the
total market capitalization in the nation.
ETFs listed on the New York Stock Exchange include all the Barclays iShares
sector funds and many of the broad domestic and individual country funds.
You’ll also find the streetTRACKS Gold Trust fund and the Rydex Euro
Currency Shares fund.
The Web site for the New York Stock Exchange is www.nyse.com. Unlike the
Web sites for the American Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ, there isn’t a
whole lot on it specifically about ETFs, but you will get the general scoop on
what’s happening in the financial world.

Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Players
“Listed” versus “traded”
Note that there is a difference between an ETF
being listed on, say, the American Stock
Exchange, and an ETF being traded on the
American Stock Exchange. In the very old days,
the terms were more or less synonymous.
Today, an ETF or stock that is listed on the
American Stock Exchange can — and usually
does — trade on any number of exchanges
simultaneously. In fact, the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 permits securities listed on any
national securities exchange to be traded by all
the other such exchanges.

NASDAQ
No bricks and mortar here. The NASDAQ, which lists over 3,200 securities
and trades about 2 billion shares a day, is a uniquely electronic exchange.
ETFs listed on the NASDAQ include the four international ETFs known as
BLDRS and two ETFs that track the stocks of the NASDAQ itself, the Fidelity
NASDAQ Composite Index (ONEQ) and the NASDAQ-100 Trust Series 1
(QQQQ). The QQQQ, on a typical day, is the greatest volume ETF and often
the greatest volume security traded in the world.
The acronym NASDAQ, by the way, stands for National Association of
Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation. Go to www.nasdaq.com, click on
ETFs, and you’ll find a number of very useful tools, including the ETF
screener and (awesome, indeed) the ETF “Heat Map,” which allows you to
see how 100 of the largest ETFs are faring on a particular day. I wouldn’t say
that feature has great practical value, but for an investment-world junkie like
me, it offers a good rush.
Meeting the Wannabe Middlemen
On January 24, 1848, James Marshall found gold at Sutter’s Mill, touching off
the California gold rush. About 150 years later, ETFs were the hottest invest-
ment product in the land, and so began the ETF rush. Everyone wants in on
the game. So we have our ETF providers, and the brokerage houses where
ETFs are bought and sold, and the exchanges where they are listed, and the
indexes upon which they are based. What else is there? Ah, we have our
wannabe middlemen: In the whole scope of things, they are as necessary as
forks in a soup kitchen, but rest assured that they will continue to try to
muscle in on the money.
Commissioned brokers
Most often, they call themselves “financial planners,” and some may actually
do financial planning. Many, however, are merely salesmen in poor disguise,
selling inferior investment products and living off the “load.” The load — or
entrance free — to buying certain investment products, such as some mutual
funds, most annuities, and life insurance products, can be ridiculously high.
Thank goodness they don’t exist in the world of ETFs — yet.
60
Part I: The ABCs of ETFs 

When first introduced, the PowerShares lineup of ETFs were originally
designed to be sold through commissioned brokers at 2 percent a pop. The
Securities and Exchange Commission killed the idea. But give it time: The
commissioned brokers will be back, lobbying in force.
Separately managed accounts
Otherwise known as SMAs, separately managed accounts have traditionally
been aimed at the well-to-do. Instead of buying into mutual funds, the wealthy
hire a private manager with Persian rugs in his lobby to do essentially what a
mutual fund manager does: pick stocks. But now many SMAs are billing them-
selves as “ETF SMAs.” Instead of picking stocks, they pick ETFs — at a price.
I don’t suspect that ETF SMAs that promise to beat the market through
exceptional ETF choices or market timing are going to do any better than
stock SMAs. That is to say that you should not hold your breath waiting for
these guys to usher you into billionairehood. Some SMA managers may be
very good at what they do. But much of what they do can be learned in this
book. If you want to hire someone to manage your ETFs, that’s fine, but if
they start talking about skimming 2 percent a year off your assets to buy
more Persian rugs, heck, you’ll do better on your own. Trust me.
Annuities and life insurance products
I’ve seen advertisements lately from a variable annuity company that features
ETFs in its portfolio. Great! That’s better than high-priced mutual funds. But
still, most variable annuities are way overpriced, carry nasty penalties for
early withdrawal, and prove to be lousy investments. Same for many life
insurance products other than simple term life. Investments in ETFs can
make these products better, but that’s a relative thing. As a very good rule, it
is best to keep your investment products apart from your insurance prod-
ucts. And never buy an annuity unless you are absolutely sure you know
what you are buying.
Mutual funds of ETFs
The term is “closet index funds,” and there’s an increasing number of them
out there, just eager to take your money and invest it in “hand-picked” portfo-
lios of stocks that strangely resemble the entire stock market. In the old days,
61
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Players

closet index-fund managers would actually have to wake up on Monday
morning to make sure their high-priced portfolios were in line with the
indexes. Today, they can sleep late because they’ve socked an indexed ETF or
two into their portfolios. You, the investor, get to invest in the ETF or two,
and the alleged manager of the mutual fund gets to milk you for all you’re
worth.
Any mutual fund that features ETFs among its top holdings isn’t worth hold-
ing. Any mutual fund — such as the Seligman TargETFund (cute, eh?) Core A
(SHVAX) — that charges a 4.75 percent load along with a gross expense ratio
of 1.93 percent to hold a bunch of ETFs for you is worthy of . . . well, I’ll con-
trol myself. But please don’t be a dummy.

Building the Stock
(Equity) Side of
Your Portfolio

In this part . . .
T
he S&P 500 (an index of large stocks) has enjoyed 
a 10 percent annualized return over the past 
75 years — a substantially greater return rate than bonds,
CDs, gold, silver, or even real estate. Small stocks have
done even better. Although history doesn’t always repeat,
it does often echo. And for that reason, most investment
advisors, including me, would recommend that a good
parcel of your long-term investments be put into stocks.
As fate would have it, about 95 percent of ETFs represent
stock holdings. So it’s appropriate that I now ask you to
turn your attention to how to use ETFs to invest in the
stock market. In the first chapter of this section, I look at
some basic concepts of equity investing, most notably
diversification and risk control. In the seven chapters that
follow, I guide you through a step-by-step exploration of
the world of stock ETFs. We examine which ETFs may
belong in your portfolio and how to best mix and match
them.

Mark Twain
A
peculiarly good writer, but also a peculiarly bad money manager, Twain
sent his entire fortune down river on a few bad investments. A century
and a half later, investing, especially in stocks, can still be a peculiarly dan-
gerous game. But today we have low-cost indexed ETFs and a lot more knowl-
edge about the power of diversification. Together, these two things can help
lessen the dangers and heighten the rewards of the stock market. In this
chapter, I hope to make you a better stock investor — at least better than
Mark Twain.

Risk Is Not Just a Board Game
Well, okay, actually Risk is a board game, but I’m not talking here about that
Risk. Rather, I’m talking about investment risk. And in the world of invest-
ments, risk means but one thing: volatility. Volatility is what takes people’s
nest eggs, scrambles them, and serves them with humble pie. Volatility is
what causes investors insomnia and heartburn. Volatility is the potential for
financially crippling losses.
Ask people (such as a good number of my present-day clients) who had most
of their money invested in tech stocks during the 1990s. For years prior,
during the heady years of the stock market’s longest bull run, they saw their
holdings grow and grow and grow. Pennies turned into dimes and then dol-
lars. Retirement was but a stone’s throw away. But then in April 2000 (yes,
April is one of those dangerous months), the bottom started to fall out of
tech stocks, and for three years the market continued its sad descent. Those
investors in formerly high-flying dot-coms saw their portfolios drop faster
than a barrel over Niagara Falls. Many lost 80 percent of everything they 
had — money they won’t see again for a very long time.
So is risk to be avoided at all costs? Well, no. Not at all. Risk is to be miti-
gated, for sure, but risk within reason can actually be a good thing. That is
because risk and return, much like Romeo and Juliet or Corona and lime, go
hand in hand. Volatility means that an investment can go way down or way
up . . . hopefully way up. Without some volatility, you resign yourself to a
portfolio that isn’t poised for any great growth.
In fact, if you are ever offered the opportunity to partake in any investment
scheme that promises you oodles and oodles of money with “absolutely no
risk,” run! You are in the presence of a con artist. Such investments do not
exist.
The trade-off of all trade-offs 
(safety versus return)
To get to the Holy Grail — to get a big, fat payoff from our investments — you
and I need to take on the Black Knight and the fire-breathing dragon. There
simply is no way that either of us is going to make money off our investments
without a willingness to deal with some volatility. The Holy Grail is not
handed out to people who stuff money in their mattresses or carry their pen-
nies to the local savings bank.
66
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

If you look at different investments over the course of time, you find an
uncanny correlation between risk and return. Safe investments — those that
really do carry genuine guarantees, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, FDIC-insured
savings accounts, and CDs — tend to offer very modest returns (often nega-
tive returns after accounting for inflation). Volatile investments — stocks,
“junk” bonds, and hedge funds, the kinds of investments that cause people to
lose sleep — tend to offer handsome returns if you give them enough time.
Time, then, is an essential ingredient in determining appropriate levels of
risk. If you are going to need cash within the next six months to a year, you
would be wise to keep that portion of your money you anticipate needing
soon either in a savings bank or possibly in an ETF such as the iShares
Lehman 1–3 Year Treasury (SHY), a short-term bond fund that yields a
modest return but is very unlikely to lose value. You should not invest that
portion of your money in any ETF that is made up of company stocks, such as
the popular SPY or QQQQ. True, SPY or QQQQ can (and should), over time,
yield much more than SHY, but they are also much more volatile. Unless you
are not going to need your cash for at least a couple of years (and preferably
not for five or more years), you are best off avoiding any investment in the
stock market, whether it be through ETFs or otherwise.
So just how risky are ETFs?
Asking how risky, or how lucrative, ETFs are is like trying to judge a soup
knowing nothing about the soup itself, only that it is served in a blue china
bowl. The bowl — or the ETF — doesn’t create the risk; what’s inside it does.
Thus stock and real estate ETFs tend to be more volatile than bond ETFs.
Short-term bond ETFs are less volatile than long-term bond ETFs (I explain
why in Part III). Small-stock ETFs are more volatile than large-stock ETFs. And
international ETFs often see more volatility than U.S. ETFs.
Figure 4-1 shows some examples of various ETFs and where they fit on the
risk–return continuum. Note that it starts with bond ETFs at the bottom (maxi-
mum safety, minimum volatility) and nearer the top features the EAFE (Europe,
Australia, Far East) Index and the South Korea Index Fund. (An investment in
South Korean stocks involves not only all the normal risks of business but also
includes currency risk, as well as the risk that some deranged North Korean
dictator may decide he wants to pick a fight. Buyer beware.)
Keep in mind when looking at Figure 4-1 that I am segregating these ETFs —
treating them as stand-alone assets — for the point of illustration. As I discuss
later in this chapter (when I discuss something called Modern Portfolio
Theory), stand-alone risk measurements are of limited value. The true risk of
adding any particular ETF to your portfolio depends on what is already in the
portfolio. (That statement will make sense by the end of this chapter. I promise!)
67
Chapter 4: Risk Control, Diversification, and Some Other Things

Smart Risk, Foolish Risk
There is safety in numbers, which is why teenage boys and girls huddle
together in corners at school dances. In the case of the teenagers, the safety
is afforded by anonymity and distance. In the case of indexed ETFs and
mutual funds, safety is provided by (limited) diversification in that they rep-
resent ownership in many different securities. Owning many stocks, rather
than a few, provides some safety by eliminating something that investment
professionals, when they’re trying to impress, call non-systemic risk.
Non-systemic risk is the kind of risk involved when you invest in any individ-
ual security, such as shares of Martha Stewart Omnimedia, ImClone, (remem-
ber Martha and ImClone?), Enron, or General Motors. It’s the risk that the
CEO of the company will be strangled by his pet python, that the national
headquarters will be destroyed by a falling asteroid, or that the company’s
stock will take a sudden nosedive simply because of some Internet rumor
started by an 11th-grader in the suburbs of Des Moines. Those kinds of risks
(and more serious ones) can be effectually eliminated by investing not in
individual securities but in ETFs or mutual funds.
Non-systemic risk contrasts with systemic risk, which, unfortunately, ETFs
and mutual funds cannot eliminate. Systemic risks simply can’t be avoided,
not even by keeping your portfolio in cash. Examples of systemic risk include
the following:
iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund (EWY)
iShares MSCI EAFE Index (EFA)
Vanguard Mid Cap ETF (VO)
SPDR 500 (SPY)
iShares Lehman 7-10 Year Treasury Bond Fund (IEF)
iShares Lehman 1-3 Year Treasury Bond Fund (SHY)
High Risk (and highest return potential)
Low Risk (with more modest return potential)

Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

 Market risk. The market goes up, the market goes down, and whatever
stocks or stock ETFs you own will generally (though not always) move in
the same direction.
 Interest rate risk. If interest rates go up, the value of your bonds or
bond ETFs (especially long-term bond ETFs such as TLT, the iShares 
20-year Treasury ETF) will fall.
 Inflation risk. When inflation picks up, any money you have in fixed
income investments (such as any of the bond ETFs) will suffer. Anything
you have in cash will start to dwindle in value.
 Political risk. If you invest your money in the United States, England,
France, or Japan, there’s little chance that guerillas will overtake the
government anytime soon. When you invest in the stocks or bonds or
stock or bond ETFs of certain other countries (or when you hold cur-
rency from those countries), you’d better keep a sharp eye on the
nightly news.
Although ETFs cannot eliminate systemic risks, you shouldn’t despair. For
while non-systemic risks are a bad thing, systemic risks are decidedly a
mixed bag. Non-systemic risks, you see, offer no compensation. A company is
not bound to pay higher dividends, nor is its stock price bound to rise simply
because the CEO has taken up mountain climbing or hang gliding.
Systemic risks, on the other hand, do offer compensation. Invest in small
stocks (which are more volatile and therefore incorporate more market risk),
and you can expect (over the very long term) higher returns. Invest in a
country with political instability, and (especially if that instability doesn’t
occur) you’ll probably be rewarded with high returns in compensation for
taking added risk.
In other words,
Higher systemic risk = higher historical return
Higher non-systemic risk = zilch
That’s the way markets tend to work. Segments of the market with higher
risks must offer higher returns or else they wouldn’t be able to attract capital.
If the potential returns on emerging market stocks (or ETFs) were no higher
than the potential returns on short-term bond ETFs or FDIC-insured savings
accounts, would anyone but a complete nutcase invest in emerging market
stocks?
69
Chapter 4: Risk Control, Diversification, and Some Other Things

How Risk Is Measured
In the world of investments, risk means volatility, and volatility (unlike angels
or love) can be seen, measured, and plotted. People in the investment world
use different tools to measure volatility, such as standard deviation, beta, and
certain ratios such as the Sharpe ratio. Most of these tools are not very hard
to get a handle on, and they can help you better follow discussions on portfo-
lio building that come later in this book. Ready to dig in?
Standard deviation: The king 
of all risk measurement tools
So, you want to know how much an investment is likely to bounce? The first
thing you do is look to see how much it has bounced in the past. Standard
deviation measures the degree of past bounce and, from that measurement,
gives us some notion of future bounce. To put it another way, standard devia-
tion shows the degree to which a stock/bond/mutual fund/ETF’s actual
returns vary from the average return over a certain time period.
In Table 4-1, consider two hypothetical ETFs and their returns over the last
six years. Note that both portfolios start with $1,000 and end with $1,101. 
But note, too, the great difference in how much they bounce. ETF A’s yearly
returns range from –3 percent to 5 percent while ETF B’s range from –15
percent to 15 percent. The standard deviation of the six years for ETF A 
is 3.09. For ETF B, the standard deviation is 10.38.

Predicting a range of returns
What does the standard deviation number tell us? Let’s take ETF A as an
example. The standard deviation of 3.09 tells us that in about 68 percent of
the months to come, we should expect the return of ETF A to fall within 3.09
percentage points of the mean return, which was 1.66. In other words, in
about 68 percent of the months to come, we should expect a return that falls
somewhere between (1.66 + 3.09) 4.75 percent and (1.66 – 3.09) –1.43 percent.
It also tells us that in about 95 percent of the months to come, the returns
should fall within two standard deviations of the mean. In other words, in 
95 percent of the months to come, you should see a return of between 
[1.66 + (3.09 × 2)] 7.84 percent and [1.66 – (3.09 × 2)] –4.52. The other 
5 percent of the time is anybody’s guess.
Making side-by-side comparisons
The ultimate purpose of standard deviation, the reason I’m describing it, is
that it gives you a way to judge the relative risk of two ETFs. If one ETF has a
3-year standard deviation of 12, we know that it is roughly twice as volatile as
another ETF with a standard deviation of 6 and half as risky as an ETF with a
standard deviation of 24. A real world example: The standard deviation for
most short-term bond funds falls somewhere around 0.7. The standard devia-
tion for most precious metal funds falls somewhere around 26.0.
Important caveat: Don’t assume that combining one ETF with a standard
deviation of 10 with another that has a standard deviation of 20 will give you
a portfolio with an average standard deviation of 15. It doesn’t work that way
at all, as you will see in a few pages when I introduce Modern Portfolio
Theory. The combined standard deviation will not be any greater than 15, but
it could (if you do your homework and put together two of the right ETFs) be
much less.
71
Chapter 4: Risk Control, Diversification, and Some Other Things

Beta: Assessing price swings 
in relation to the market
Unlike standard deviation, which gives you a stand-alone picture of volatility,
beta is a relative measure. It is used to measure the volatility of something in
relation to something else. Most commonly that “something else” is the S&P
500. Very simply, beta tells us that if the S&P rises by x percent, then our
investment, whatever that investment is, will likely rise by y percent. If the
S&P were to fall by x percent, beta tells us that our investment is likely to fall
by y percent.
The S&P is considered our baseline, and it is assigned a beta of 1. So if we
know that Humongous Software Corporation has a beta of 2, and the S&P
shoots up 10 percent, Jimmy the Greek would bet that shares of Humongous
are going to rise 20 percent. If we know that the Sedate Utility Company has a
beta of 0.5, and the S&P shoots up 10 percent, Jimmy would bet that shares of
Sedate are going to rise by 5 percent. Conversely, shares of Humongous
would likely fall four times harder than shares of Sedate in response to a fall
in the S&P.
In a way, beta is easier to understand than standard deviation; it’s also easier
to misinterpret. Beta’s usefulness is greater for individual stocks than it is for
ETFs, but nonetheless it can be helpful, especially when gauging the volatility
of U.S. industry sector ETFs. It is much less useful for any ETF that has inter-
national holdings. For example, an ETF that holds stocks of emerging market
nations is going to be volatile, trust me, yet it may have a low beta. How so?
Because its movements, no matter how swooping, don’t generally happen in
response to movement in the U.S. market. (Emerging market stocks tend to
be more tied to currency flux, commodity prices, interest rates, and political
climate.)
The Sharpe and Treynor ratios: Measures
of what you get for your risk
Back in 1966, a goateed Stanford professor named Bill Sharpe developed a
formula that has since become as common in investmentspeak as RBIs are in
baseballspeak. The formula looks like this:
(Total portfolio return – Risk-free rate of return) / Portfolio standard 
deviation = Sharpe measure (or Sharpe ratio)
72
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

The risk-free rate of return generally refers to the return you could get on a
short-term U.S. Treasury bill. If we subtract that from the total portfolio
return, it tells us how much our portfolio earned above the rate we could
have achieved without risking our principal. We take that number and divide
it by the standard deviation (discussed earlier in this section). And what that
result gives us is the Sharpe measure, which essentially gives an indication of
how much money has been made in relation to how much risk was taken to
make that money.
Suppose Portfolio A, under manager Bubba Bucks, returned 7 percent last
year, and during that year Treasury bills were paying 5 percent. Portfolio A
also had a standard deviation of 8 percent. Okay, applying the formula,
That result wasn’t good enough for Bubba’s manager, so he fired Bubba 
and hired Donny Dollar. Donny, who just read Exchange-Traded Funds For
Dummies, takes the portfolio and dumps all its high-cost active mutual funds.
In their place, he buys ETFs. In his first year managing the portfolio, Donny

Real-life examples of standard deviation and beta
Following are the (three-year) standard devia-
tions and the betas of several diverse ETFs.
Note that iShares MSCI Hong Kong (EWH) is
more volatile than iShares MSCI U.K. Index
(EWU) as measured by its standard deviation,
but EWH has a lower beta. That tells us that the
volatility of the Hong Kong market, however
great it is, seems to be less tied to the fortunes
of the S&P 500 than is the volatility of the U.K.
market.

achieves a total return of 10 percent with a standard deviation of 7.5. But 
the interest rate on Treasury bills has gone up to 7 percent. Applying the 
formula,
The higher the Sharpe measure, the better. Donny Dollar did his job much
better than Bubba Bucks.
The Treynor approach was first used by — you guessed it — a guy named
Jack Treynor in 1965. Instead of using standard deviation in the denominator,
it uses beta. What the Treynor measure shows is the amount of money that a
portfolio is making in relation to the risk it carries relative to the market. To
put that another way, the Treynor measure uses only systemic risk, or beta,
while the Sharpe ratio uses total risk.
Suppose that Donny Dollar’s portfolio, with its 10 percent return, had a beta
of 0.9. In that case, the Treynor measure would be
Is 0.033 good? That depends. It’s a relative number. Suppose that the market,
as measured by the S&P 500, also returned 10 percent that same year. It may
seem like Donny isn’t a very good manager. But when we apply the Treynor
measure (recalling that the beta for the market is always 1.0),
We get a lower number. That result indicates that although Donny earned a
similar return as the market, he did so by taking less risk. To put that another
way, he got more return per unit of risk. Donny’s boss will likely keep him.
A newfangled measure of risk
I’m sometimes astounded what some people give away for free on the Web. 
A group called RiskMetrics has a free Web site called www.riskgrades.com.
Go there! You can plug in either a single ETF, mutual fund, stock, or bond, or a
combination thereof, and RiskGrades will spit out a darned good assessment
of just how much risk you are taking. Like moving from Fahrenheit to Celsius,

RiskGrades provides a scale that just looks so much cleaner than what you’ve
ever seen before. The risk rating starts at 0 for an investment with no volatil-
ity (cash) and moves higher with added risk.
I plugged in several ETFs (and one individual stock, just for fun), and
RiskGrades provided the following risk grades:
iShares Lehman 1–3 Year Treasury (SHY): 9
iShares Lehman 7–10 Year Treasury (IEF): 22
SPDR 500 (SPY): 48
iShares MSCI EAFE Index Fund (EFA): 62
NASDAQ-100 Trust Series 1 (QQQQ): 73
Google (Goog)236
RiskGrades’ rating are similar to standard deviation, but they are much more
intuitive. An ETF with a standard deviation of 17.5 is obviously more volatile
than an ETF with a standard deviation of 8.4, but how much more volatile,
only a doctorate-level statistician can tell you. On the other hand, an ETF
with a RiskGrade of 30 has twice the volatility of an ETF with a RiskGrade 
of 15.
RiskGrades even allows you to build an entire portfolio online, and it will
show you how diversification helps to lower the volatility of the portfolio.
(That’s the subject we turn to in the next section.) Even though I found a few
bugs in the system (which I hope will be corrected before this book is pub-
lished), RiskGrades is a great tool, and I hope it remains free.
Meet Modern Portfolio Theory
For simplicity’s sake, I’ve talked so far of choosing one ETF over another
(SHY or SPY?) based on risk and potential return. In the real world, few
people, if any, come to me or to any financial planner asking for a recommen-
dation of one single ETF. More commonly, I’m asked to help build a portfolio
of ETFs. And when looking at an entire portfolio, the riskiness of each individ-
ual ETF, although important, takes a back seat to the riskiness of the entire
portfolio.
In other words, I would rarely recommend or rule out any specific ETF
because it is too volatile. How well any specific ETF fits into a portfolio — and
to what degree it affects the risk of a portfolio — depends on what else is in
the portfolio. What I’m alluding to here is something called Modern Portfolio
75
Chapter 4: Risk Control, Diversification, and Some Other Things

Theory: the tool I use to help determine a proper ETF mix for my clients’ port-
folios. You and I will use this tool throughout this book to help you determine
a proper mix for your portfolio.
Tasting the extreme positiveness 
of negative correlation
Modern Portfolio Theory is to investing what the discovery of gravity was to
physics. Almost. What the theory says is that the volatility/risk of a portfolio
may differ dramatically from the volatility/risk of the portfolio’s components.
In other words, you can have two assets with high standard deviations (and
high potential returns), and combined they give you a portfolio with modest
standard deviation but the same high potential return. Modern Portfolio
Theory says that you can have a whole slew of risky investments, but if you
throw them together into a big bowl, the entire soup may actually splash
around very little.
The key to whipping up such pleasant combinations is to find two or more
holdings that do not move in synch; one tends to go up while the other goes
down (although both holdings, in the long run, will see an upward trajec-
tory). In the figures that follow, I show how you’d create the fantasy ETF port-
folio consisting of two high-risk/high-return ETFs with perfect negative
correlation. It is a fantasy portfolio because perfect negative correlations
don’t exist; they simply serve as a target.
Figure 4-2 represents hypothetical ETF A and hypothetical ETF B, each of
which has high return and high volatility. Notice that even though both are
volatile assets, they move up and down at different times. This fact is crucial
because combining them can give you a non-volatile portfolio.

Figure 4-3 shows what happens when you invest in both ETF A and ETF B.
You end up with the perfect ETF portfolio — one made up of two ETFs with
perfect negative correlation. (If only such a portfolio existed in the real
world!)
Reaching for the elusive Efficient Frontier
When the U.S. stock market takes a punch, which happens on average about
one in every three years, most stocks fall. When the market flies, most stocks
fly. Not many investments regularly move in opposite directions. We do, how-
ever, find investments that tend to move independently of each other much
of the time, or at least they don’t move in the same direction all the time. In
investmentspeak, I’m talking about investments that have low correlation.
The best example is stocks and bonds.
Say, for example, you had a basket of large U.S. stocks in 1929, at the onset of
the Great Depression. You would have seen your portfolio lose nearly a quar-
ter of its value every year for the next four years. Needless to say, you would
not have been a very happy camper. If, however, you were holding high-
quality, long-term bonds during that same period, at least that side of your
portfolio would have grown by a respectable 5 percent a year. A portfolio of
long-term bonds held throughout the growling bear market in stocks of 2000
through 2003 would have returned a hale and hearty 13 percent a year.
(That’s an unusually high return for bonds, but all the stars were seemingly 
in perfect alignment.)

Chapter 4: Risk Control, Diversification, and Some Other Things

Correlation is a measurable thing, represented in the world of investments by
something called the correlation coefficient. This number indicates the degree
to which two investments move in the same direction or move apart. A corre-
lation coefficient can range from –1 to 1.
A correlation of 1 indicates that the two securities are like the Rockettes:
When one kicks a leg, so does the other. Having both in your portfolio offers
no diversification benefit. On the other hand, if investment A and investment
B have a correlation coefficient of –1, that means they have a perfect negative
relationship: They always move in the opposite directions. Having both in
your portfolio is a wonderful diversifier. Such polar-opposite investments are,
alas, very hard to find.
A correlation coefficient of zero means that the two investments have no rela-
tionship to each other. When one moves, the other may move in the same
direction, the opposite direction, or not at all.
As a whole, stocks and bonds (not junk bonds, but high-quality bonds) tend
to have little to negative correlation. Finding the perfect mix of stocks and
bonds, as well as other investments with low correlation, is known among
financial people as looking for the Efficient Frontier. The Frontier represents
the mix of investments that offer the greatest promise of return for the least
amount of risk.

The correlation of various ETFs
The following correlations of several of
Barclays iShares show to what degree different
ETFs moved in the same direction over a recent
three-year period. The lower the correlation, the
better from a portfolio-building point of view.
Low correlations reduce portfolio risk. High cor-
relations do not. Negative correlations are, alas,
not that easy to find in the real world, and port-
folio managers are forever looking.

Fortunately, ETFs allow us to easily tinker with our investments so we can
find just that sweet spot.
Mixing and Matching Your Stock ETFs
Reaching for the elusive Efficient Frontier means having both stocks and
bonds and having both domestic and international holdings in your portfolio.
That part is fairly simple and not likely to stir much controversy. (Although,
for sure, experts differ on what they consider optimal percentages.) But
experts definitely don’t agree on how to best diversify the domestic stock
part of a portfolio. Two competing methods predominate:
 One method calls for the division of a stock portfolio into domestic and
foreign, and then into different styles: large cap, small cap, mid cap,
value, and growth.
 The other method calls for dividing the portfolio up by industry sector:
healthcare, utilities, energy, financials, and so on.
My personal preference for the small to mid-sized investor, especially the ETF
investor, is to go with the styles. But there’s nothing wrong with dividing up a
portfolio by industry sector. And for those of you with good-sized portfolios,
a mixture of both, without going crazy, may be optimal.
Filling in your style box
Most savvy investors make certain to have some equity in each of the nine
boxes of the grid in Figure 4-4, which is known as the style box or grid
(sometimes called the Morningstar grid).
The reason for the style box is simple enough: History shows that companies
of differing cap (capitalization) size (in other words, large companies and
small companies) and value and growth companies tend to rise and fall in dif-
ferent economic conditions. I define cap size, value, and growth in Chapter 5,
and I devote the next several chapters to showing the differences between
styles, how to choose ETFs to match each one, and how to weight those ETFs
for the highest potential return with the lowest possible risk.
79
Chapter 4: Risk Control, Diversification, and Some Other Things

Buying by industry sector
A good number of investors of late, especially since the advent of ETFs, have
started using sector investing as an alternative to the grid. Examining the two
models toe-to-toe yields some interesting comparisons and much food for
thought.

One study on industry-sector investing, done by Chicago-based Ibbotson
Associates in 2003, came to the very favorable conclusion that sector invest-
ing is potentially a superior diversifier than grid investing because times have
changed since the 1960s when style investing first became popular.
“Globalization has led to a rise in correlation between domestic and interna-
tional stocks; large, mid and small cap stocks have high correlation to each
other. A company’s performance is tied more to its industry than to the coun-
try where it’s based, or the size of its market cap,” concluded Ibbotson.
The jury is still out, but I give an overview of the controversy in Chapter 9.
For now, I invite you to do a little comparison of your own by comparing the
charts in the sidebars “Investing with style” and “Investing by industry
sector.” Note that using either method of diversification, some of your invest-
ments should smell like roses in years when others stink.
Don’t slice and dice your portfolio to death
One reason I tend to prefer the traditional style grid to industry sector invest-
ing, at least for the non-wealthy investor, is that there are simply fewer styles
to contend with. You can build yourself, at least on the domestic side of your
stock holdings, a pretty well diversified portfolio with but four ETFs: one
small value, one small growth, one large value, and one large growth. With
industry-sector investing, you would need a dozen or so ETFs to have a well-
balanced portfolio. And that may be too many.
You don’t want to chop up your portfolio into too many holdings, or the
transaction costs (especially with ETFs that require trading costs) can start
to bite into your returns.

As a rule, if you have $10,000 to invest and you want ETFs, consider four or
five that can give you some diversification. (Perhaps start with the four
above and add in an international ETF. See my sample ETF portfolios for all
sizes of nest eggs in Part IV.) If you have $50,000, consider something in the
ballpark of a 10 to 15 ETF portfolio, and if you have $250,000 or more, per-
haps look at a 20 to 30 ETF portfolio. If you invest in many more ETFs than
this, the marginal benefits of added diversification will likely be outweighed
by the additional trading costs every time you attempt to rebalance your
holdings.

Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 
What creates returns, and what kind 
of returns will the future bring?
In the world of stock markets, with their by-and-
large juicy long-term returns, the juice comes
from three sources:
 Dividends
 Earnings growth
 Price/earning multiples (the measure of
market expectations), otherwise known 
as P/E
Dividends, it may surprise you to learn, account
for the lion’s share of stock market returns over
the past two centuries. The stock market has
given us roughly a 7 percent post-inflation rise
during that period. Perhaps three-quarters of
that 7 percent is attributable to dividends. That’s
history, of course. Today’s dividend yield on the
S&P 500, although it has grown in the past two
years, is not much more than 1.5 percent and is
very unlikely to exceed 5 percent ever again.
Instead of paying dividends, companies today
tend to funnel their profits into internal growth,
repurchasing shares of their own stock and
dishing out astronomical compensation for top
executives.
In the future, we may be looking at a 2 percent
dividend yield, tops, plus whatever good fortune
brings us in the way of earnings growth. The
price/earnings multiple — the factor by which
investors are willing to invest in stocks in hopes
of future earnings — soared wildly in the bull
market of the 1990s but has since shrunk to
pretty close to its historical norm (about 18). It
may grow again, or it may shrink. Who knows?
And whether earnings growth can take up
where dividend yield left off and provide
investors with 7 percent return after inflation —
that is a big unknown.
When I look into my crystal ball (I really try not
to do that very often), I can’t see what returns
will be, but I do know for sure that the stock
market will continue to be volatile, perhaps
even more so than it has been in the past. Many
investors may be throwing up on the side of the
ship long before they get to any port where
they’ll find the Holy Grail. Fortunately, with 
a well-balanced portfolio of ETFs, you may 
be chucking up fewer cookies than most 
passengers.
But don’t assume you can avoid all risk, don’t
assume that the future will mirror the past, and
don’t put everything you have into stocks.

P
ick up a typical business magazine and look at the face adorning the cover.
He’s Mr. CEO. Tough and ambitious and looking for acquisitions under
every rock, his pedigree is Harvard, his wife is the former Miss Missouri, his
salary (not to mention other perks) exceeds the gross national product of Peru,
and his house has 14 bathrooms. (Yeah, I know this seems like a stereotype,
but U.S. CEOs do tend to be a rather homogenous lot.) The title of the cover
story emblazoned across Mr. CEO’s chest suggests that buying stock in his
company will make you rich. Without knowing anything more, you can assume
that Mr. CEO heads a large growth company.
In other words, Mr. CEO’s company has total market capitalization (the value
of all its outstanding stock) of at least $5 billion, earnings have been growing
and growing fast, the company has a secure niche within its industry, and
many people envision the Borg-like corporation eventually taking over the
universe. Think Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, PepsiCo, Dell, Oracle, eBay, and
Cisco Systems.
In this chapter, I explain what role such behemoths should play in your port-
folio. But before getting into the meat of the matter, take a quick glance at
Figures 5-1 and 5-2. Figure 5-1 shows where large growth stocks fit into a well-
diversified stock portfolio. (I introduce this style box or grid, which divides a
stock portfolio into large cap and small cap, value and growth, in Chapter 4.)

Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

Style Review
In Chapter 4, I note that one approach to building a portfolio involves investing
in different styles of stocks: large cap, mid cap, small cap, value, and growth.
How did the whole business of style investing get started? Hard to say.
Benjamin Graham, the “Dean of Wall Street,” the “Father of Value Investing,”
who wrote several oft-quoted books in the 1930s and 1940s, didn’t give us the
popular style grid that you see in Figure 5-1. But Graham certainly helped pro-
vide the tools of fundamental analysis whereby more contemporary brains
could help figure things out.
In the early 1980s, studies out of the University of Chicago began to quantify
the concrete differences between large caps and small caps, and in 1992, two
economists named Eugene Fama and Kenneth French delivered the seminal
paper on the differences between value and growth stocks.
What makes large cap large?
Capitalization or cap refers to the combined value of all shares of a company’s
stock. The division lines between large cap, mid cap, and small cap are some-
times as blurry as the division lines between, say, Rubenesque and fat. The dis-
tinction is largely in the eye of the beholder. If you took a poll, however, I think
you would find that the following divisions are generally accepted:
 Large caps: Companies with over $5 billion in capitalization
 Mid caps: Companies with $1 billion to $5 billion in capitalization
 Small caps: Companies with $250 million to $1 billion in capitalization
Anything from $50 million to $250 million would usually be deemed a micro
cap. And your local pizza shop, if it were to go public, might be called a nano
cap (con aglio). There are no nano cap ETFs. For all the other categories,
there are ETFs to your heart’s content.
How does growth differ from value?
Many different criteria are used to determine whether a stock or basket of
stocks (such as an ETF) qualifies as growth or value. (In Chapter 6, I list “Six
Ways to Recognize Value.”) But perhaps the most important measure is the
ratio of price to earnings: the P/E ratio, sometimes referred to as the multiple.
The P/E ratio divides the price of the stock by the earnings per share. For
example, suppose the McDummy Corporation stock is currently selling for
$40 a share. And suppose that the company earned $2 last year for every
85
Chapter 5: Large Growth: Muscular Money Makers

share of stock outstanding. McDummy’s P/E ratio would be 20. (The S&P 
500 currently has a P/E of about 16.)
The higher the P/E, the more investors are willing to pay for the company
earnings. Or to put it in terms of growth and value,
 The higher the P/E, the more growthy the company: Either the company is
growing fast, or investors have high hopes (realistic or foolish) that it will.
 The lower the P/E, the more valuey the company. The business world
doesn’t see this company as a mover and shaker.
Each ETF carries a P/E reflecting the collective P/E of its holdings and giving
you an indication of just how growthy or valuey that ETF is. A growth ETF is
filled with companies that look like they are taking over the planet. A value
ETF is filled with companies that seem to be meandering along but whose
stock may be purchased for a bargain price.
Putting these terms to use
Today, all competent investment pros develop their portfolios with at least
some consideration given to the cap size and growth or value orientation of
their stock holdings. Why? Because study after study shows that, in fact, a
portfolio’s performance is inexorably linked to where that portfolio falls in
the style grid. A mutual fund that holds all large growth stocks, for example,
will generally (but certainly not always) rise or fall with the rise or fall of that
asset class.
Some research shows that perhaps 90 to 95 percent of a mutual fund’s or ETF’s
performance may be attributable to its asset class. I believe it. That’s why the
financial press’s weekly wrap-ups of top performing funds will typically list a
bunch of funds that mirror each other very closely. (That being the case, why
not enjoy the low cost and tax efficiency of the ETF or index mutual fund?)
Big and Brawny
Large growth companies grab nearly all the headlines, for sure. The pundits
are forever bestowing them with glory. The northeast corner of the style 
grid includes the most recognizable names in the corporate world. If you’re
seeking employment, I urge you strongly to latch on to such a growth com-
pany; your future will likely be bright. But do large growth stocks necessarily
make the best investments?
Er, no.
86
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

Contrary to all appearances . . .
According to Fama and French (who are still operating as a research duo),
over the course of the last 77 years, large growth stocks have seen an 
annualized return rate (not accounting for inflation) of about 9.5 percent. 
Not too bad at all. But that compares to 11.5 percent for large value stocks.
And what’s the relative volatility? Would you believe they’re about on a par.
Theories abound as to why large growth stocks haven’t done as well as value
stocks. Value stocks pay greater dividends, say some. Value stocks really are
riskier; they just don’t look it, argue others.
The theory that makes the most sense, in my opinion, is that growth stocks
are simply hampered by their own immense popularity. Because growth com-
panies grab all the headlines, because investors think they must be the best
investments, the large growth stocks tend to get overpriced before you buy
them. Think of how Google’s stock shot up like a rocket in a matter of weeks
after it hit the market. Weeks after that — after thousands and thousands of
investors jumped on board — the stock began to cool.
Let history serve as only a rough guide
So given that large value stocks historically have done better than large
growth stocks, and given (as I discuss in Chapters 7 and 8) that small caps
historically have knocked the socks off large, does it still make sense to sink
some of your investment dollars into large growth? Oh yes, it does. The past
is only an indication of what the future may bring. No one knows whether
value stocks will continue to outshine. In the past few years especially, growth
stocks have lagged value by a wide margin, so perhaps we’re going to see a
reversal.
(Don’t accuse me of market timing! I’m not saying that just because growth
stocks have been depressed they are due for a big comeback. I have no idea.
But to a small and limited degree, a little timely tactical tilting, I feel, is an
okay thing. That is, it does make some sense to tilt a portfolio gently toward
whatever sectors seem to be sagging and away from sectors that have been
blazing. If you do that subtly, and regularly, and don’t let emotions sway you,
and if you watch out carefully for tax ramifications and trading costs, history
shows that you may eek out some modest added return.)
Stocks of large companies — value and growth combined — should make up
between 50 and 80 percent of your total domestic stock portfolio. The higher
your risk tolerance, the more you should lean toward small cap.
Whatever your allocation to domestic large cap stocks, I recommend that you
invest anywhere from 40 to 50 percent of that amount in large growth. Take a
tilt toward value, if you wish, but don’t tilt so far that you risk tipping over.
87
Chapter 5: Large Growth: Muscular Money Makers

ETF Options Galore
The roster of ETFs on the market now includes about 30 broad-based domes-
tic large cap funds, of which about 10 are large growth. The remainder of the
broad-based (as opposed to industry sector or other specialized) large cap
funds are either blend (a growth and value cocktail) or strictly large value. 
As I emphasize throughout this book, each and every investment you make
should be evaluated in the context of your entire portfolio.
In this chapter, I’m focusing on large growth ETFs. But before you start shop-
ping for a large growth ETF, you need to ask yourself whether a large growth
ETF belongs in your portfolio. In a nutshell, it does, but only if your portfolio
is large enough to warrant division into various styles.
Strictly large cap or blend?
All things being equal, I’d like to see you invest in both large growth and value
stocks — separately. That approach gives you the opportunity to rebalance
once a year and, by so doing, juice out added return and keep risk to a mini-
mum. (More on rebalancing in Chapter 18.) But the profit you reap from that
tweak must exceed the transaction costs of making two trades (generally sell-
ing the outperforming ETF for the year and purchasing the underperformer).
If your portfolio isn’t big enough for the profit of the tweaking to outweigh the
cost of the trading, you’re better off with a blend of value and growth. If your
portfolio is so small that any tweaking is likely to be unprofitable, I would sug-
gest not only a blend of large value and growth, but a blend of everything. Keep
these parameters in mind as you read on.
“Everything” investment options
I don’t know where you park your money, and I don’t know exactly how much
you spend per trade, but I would say that if you have a portfolio of $10,000 or
less, you should probably be thinking mutual funds, not ETFs. Otherwise, the
trading costs could eat you alive. If, however, you are unlikely to do any trad-
ing in the next several years, an ETF portfolio may make sense. In that case,
consider a simple and all-encompassing “everything” (total ball of wax) ETF
for your domestic stock holdings.
Good options in the “everything” stock category include the iShares Dow
Jones U.S. Total Market (IYY), the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI),
and the streetTRACKS Total Market (TMW). Of the three, I have a slight pref-
erence for the Vanguard choice for its ultra-low cost (0.07 percent versus 
0.20 percent for either the iShares or the streetTRACKS).

Large and small cap blends
If you have more than $10,000 but less than $20,000 or so, and you’re willing
to invest it and keep it put for a good while, consider splitting up your domes-
tic stock portfolio into large and small cap. In this case, I’d recommend a
diversified small cap blend and a diversified large cap blend. Good options
among the large cap blends would include the Vanguard Large Cap ETF (VV),
the iShares S&P 500 (IW), the iShares Russell 1000 (IWB), and possibly the
unconventional and somewhat sassy Rydex S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP) ETF.
I discuss these options in detail in the upcoming section “Blended options for
large cap exposure.”
Large cap growth and value options
If you have a portfolio of more than $20,000, you should split up the large
caps into growth and value. Good large growth options would include the
Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG), iShares Morningstar Large Growth (JKE),
iShares S&P 500 Growth (IVW), streetTRACKS Dow Jones U.S. Large Cap
Growth (ELG), and possibly the Rydex S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG). See the
upcoming section “Strictly large growth” for details on these ETFs.
Blended options for large cap exposure
Among the blended (large cap value and growth) options for smaller portfo-
lios ($10,000 to $20,000), I feel comfortable recommending any of the four
ETFs I discuss below. Note that there are subtle differences between the first
three, while the fourth option — the Rydex baby — differs from the others 
by a good margin.
Please keep in mind that all the expense ratios, average cap sizes, price/
earnings ratios, and top five holdings for the ETFs I list here and elsewhere in
the book are true as of a certain date and are subject to change. You should
verify before making any purchase.
Vanguard Large Cap ETF (VV)
Indexed to: MSCI U.S. Prime Market 750 Index (750 corporate biggies from
both the value and growth sides of the grid)
Expense ratio: 0.07 percent
Average cap size: $44.8 billion
P/E ratio: 17.6
89
Chapter 5: Large Growth: Muscular Money Makers

Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil Corp., General Electric, Microsoft, Citigroup,
Bank of America
Russell’s review: The ultra-low cost, as with nearly all Vanguard offerings,
makes me want to stand up and cheer. The MSCI U.S. Prime Market 750, as
the name implies, encompasses a larger universe of stocks than the more
popular S&P 500, which translates to holdings with a somewhat smaller aver-
age cap size than you’ll find with the iShares options. The MSCI index is also
more “indexy” than the S&P 500: The choice of companies is purely quantita-
tive, whereas with the S&P, there is some human choice. Personally, I like the
hands-off approach. This ETF is an excellent choice for people with smaller
portfolios trying to limit the number of ETFs they have to manage.
iShares S&P 500 (IW)
Indexed to: S&P 500 (500 of the biggest and most stable U.S. companies)
Expense ratio: 0.09 percent
Average cap size: $47.0 billion
P/E ratio: 16.0
Top five holdings: General Electric, Exxon Mobil Corp., Citigroup, Microsoft,
Procter & Gamble
Russell’s review: I’m not all too crazy about the S&P 500 as an index; it’s just
too darned popular. That popularity may cost you a few cents here and there
thanks to speculators who dip and dive around the index. The cost of this fund,
however, is so delightfully low that it could help offset the speculation factor.
The average cap size is way big. The iShares S&P 500 fund is a more-than-okay
option, but I give a very slight preference to the Vanguard Large Cap ETF.
iShares Russell 1000 (IWB)
Indexed to: Russell 1000 (the largest 1,000 publicly traded companies in 
the land)
Expense ratio: 0.15 percent
Average cap size: $35.0 billion
P/E ratio: 16.2
Top five holdings: General Electric, Exxon Mobil Corp., Citigroup, Microsoft,
Procter & Gamble
90
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

Russell’s review: The cost isn’t high, but it is higher than the comparable
Vanguard fund. On the other hand, this ETF offers somewhat larger 
diversification — only a potential plus, really, if this is going to be a major
part of your portfolio. Given the exposure to smaller companies, this fund
may prove over the long run to be slightly more volatile but slightly more
rewarding than either the Vanguard or the other comparable iShares options.
Rydex S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP)
Indexed to: S&P 500, but each of the 500 companies in the index is given
equal weight rather than the traditional market weighting
Expense ratio: 0.40 percent
Average cap size: $11.5 billion
P/E ratio: 16.3
Top five holdings: 500 stocks share equal weights (each about 0.25 of the
portfolio)
Russell’s review: Equal weighting is a novel and controversial approaching to
investing. On one hand, it seems to make a lot of sense, offering perhaps better
diversification and a relative overweighting of “cheaper” companies. I’m not
crazy about the 0.40 percent expense ratio, which is considerably higher than
comparable funds. Still, I wouldn’t want to rule this fund out. If you decide
you want to own it, note the much smaller average cap size than the other
large blends. Arrange your other holdings accordingly to avoid a portfolio
too oriented toward smaller companies.
Strictly large growth
For large growth and large growth alone (complimented by large value, 
of course) — a position I much prefer for people with adequate assets
($20,000+) — the four options I list here all provide good exposure to the
asset class at very reasonable cost. You may also want to consider an offer-
ing from Rydex.
Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG)
Indexed to: MSCI U.S. Prime Market Growth Index (400 of the nation’s largest
growth stocks)
Expense ratio: 0.11 percent
91
Chapter 5: Large Growth: Muscular Money Makers

Average cap size: $41.8 billion
P/E ratio: 22.2
Top five holdings: Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Johnson &
Johnson, International Business Machines
Russell’s review: The price is right. The index makes sense. There’s good
diversification. The companies represented are certainly large. This ETF is
certainly a very good option, although I’d like it a wee bit more if it were a tad
more growthy. There’s also “The Vanguard edge” (see Chapter 3), which gives
this fund another advantage for those who may already own the Vanguard
Growth Index mutual fund.
iShares Morningstar Large Growth (JKE)
Indexed to: Morningstar Large Growth Index (105 of the largest and most
growthy U.S. companies)
Expense ratio: 0.25 percent
Average cap size: $30.75 billion
P/E ratio: 28.9
Top five holdings: Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Cisco Systems, Intel,
PepsiCo
Russell’s review: Nothing in life is perfect. This ETF offers the growthiness
that the Vanguard ETF lacks. The flip side is that the diversification leaves
something to be desired. Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson together make up
a tad more than 13 percent of the index; that’s a little more than I would like
to see. And perhaps because Morningstar indexes aren’t nearly as popular as
S&P indexes, this ETF is thinly traded, which could result in a larger spread
when you buy or sell. What tips the scales for me, however, and makes this
one of my faves is that Morningstar indexes are crisp and distinct: Any com-
pany that appears in the growth index is not going to be popping up in the
value index. Even though that crispness could lead to slightly higher turnover,
I like it.
iShares S&P 500 Growth (IVW)
Indexed to: S&P 500/Citigroup Growth Index (300 of the largest growth com-
panies in the land, chosen from the S&P 500 universe)
Expense ratio: 0.18 percent
92
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

Average cap size: $19.1 billion
P/E ratio: 18.3
Top five holdings: Microsoft, Exxon Mobil Corp., Procter & Gamble, Pfizer,
Johnson & Johnson
Russell’s review: The price is good, and the diversification is more than ade-
quate. My only beef — a small one — is that the selection could be growthier.
(A growthier approach, however, might entail more turnover.) One certain
plus: This ETF is the most popular among the large growth options, and
therefore the buy and sell spreads should be slightly less than with, say, the
Morningstar iShare or the Vanguard Large Growth.
streetTRACKS Dow Jones U.S. Large Cap Growth (ELG)
Indexed to: Start with the Wilshire 5000 (just about the whole shebang), and
select the 400 or so largest and growthiest companies
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average cap size: $61.0 billion
P/E ratio: 19.2
Top five holdings: Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Cisco
Systems, International Business Machines
Russell’s review: Nothing wrong here: reasonable ratios, rational index. I’m
not sure this would be my first choice, however; although the price is reason-
able, it is still almost twice what Vanguard charges.
Rydex S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG)
Indexed to: Approximately 140 of the most growthy of the S&P 500 
companies
Expense ratio: 0.35 percent
Average cap size: $23.4 billion
P/E ratio: 19.1
Top five holdings: International Game Technology, Nvidia, XTO Energy,
Forest Laboratories, Express Scripts
93
Chapter 5: Large Growth: Muscular Money Makers

Russell’s review: The promise here is one of “purity.” You wouldn’t know 
it by looking at the cap size and P/E ratio, neither of which make this fund
look especially more pure than any other large growth ETF. It is possible that
Rydex’s other selection criteria somehow add to purity. But is that purity of
style worth paying 0.35 percent for? Granted, that isn’t high by mutual fund
standards, but compared to the other large growth ETF options, it is pricey.
I’d like to see this fund prove itself. It can do that if it maintains extremely 
low correlation with its value counterpart. That proof will take years.
ETFs I wouldn’t go out of my way to own
None of the ETFs listed below is horrible — far from it. But given the plethora
of choices, barring very special circumstances, I would not recommend these:
 DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (DIA). Based on the index on which this ETF
is based, I basically don’t like it. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an
antiquated and somewhat arbitrary index of 30 large companies that
look good to the editors of The Wall Street Journal. That isn’t enough to
build a portfolio on.
 SPDR 500 (SPY). It’s the oldest and largest and perhaps even the cheap-
est (0.06 percent), but it’s not the best thing on the ETF market. The S&P
500, which the fund tracks, isn’t the greatest of indexes. The legal struc-
ture of SPY — unlike the vast majority of ETFs — does not allow for the
immediate reinvestment of dividends, which can create a cash drag.
 PowerShares Dynamic Large Cap Growth (PWB). This ETF doesn’t
make me recoil in horror; you could do a lot worse. But the high-by-
ETF-standards expense ratio (0.60 percent) is something of a turn-off.
And the “enhanced” index reminds me too much of active investing,
which has a less than gleaming track record. I may change my mind if
this new fund still shines after years on the market, but for right now, 
I’d shy away.

W
hy do American suburbanites gingerly cultivate their daisies, yet go
nuts swinging spades or spraying poison chemicals at their dande-
lions? Why is a second cup of coffee in a diner free, but they charge you for 
a second cup of tea? Some things in this world just don’t make a lot of sense.
Why, for example, would slower-growing companies (the dandelions of the
corporate world) historically reward investors better than faster-growing
(daisy) companies? Welcome to the shoulder-shrugging world of value 
investing.
I’m talking about companies you’ve probably heard of, yes, but they aren’t
nearly as glamorous as Google or as exciting as Cisco. I’m talking about com-
panies that usually ply their trade in older, slow growing industries, like
insurance, petroleum, and transportation. I’m talking about companies such
as Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Freddie Mac, American International Group (life
insurance, anyone?), and Excelon (providing electricity and gas to customers
in Illinois and Pennsylvania).

I see you yawning! But before you fall asleep, consider this: In the past 77
years, large value stocks have enjoyed an annualized growth rate of 11.4 per-
cent, versus but 9.5 percent for large growth stocks — with roughly the same
standard deviation (volatility). And thanks to ETFs, investing in value was
never easier.
In this chapter, I explain not only the role that large value stocks play in a
portfolio but why you may want them to be the largest single asset class 
in your portfolio. Take a gander at Figures 6-1 and 6-2. They show where 
large value stocks fit into the investment style grid (which I introduce in
Chapter 4) and the impressive return of large value stocks over the past 
eight decades.

Six Ways to Recognize Value
Warren Buffett knows a value stock when he sees one. Do you? Different
investment pros and different indexes (upon which ETFs are fashioned) may
use different criteria for making their selections of value stocks. But here are
some of the most common criteria:
 P/E ratio. As early as 1934, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd (in their
book with the gangbuster title Security Analysis) suggested that investors
should pay heavy consideration to the ratio of a stock’s market price (P)
to its earnings per share (E). Sometimes called the multiple, this venerable
ratio sheds light on how much the market is willing to cough up for a com-
pany’s earning power. The lower the ratio, the more “valuey” the stock.
 P/B ratio. Graham and Dodd also advised that the ratio of market price
to book value (B) be given at least “a fleeting glance.” Many of today’s
investment gurus have awarded the P/B ratio the chief role in defining
value versus growth. A ratio well below sea level is what floats a value

investor’s boat. Book value refers to the guesstimated value of a corpo-
ration’s total assets, both tangible (factories, inventory, and so on) and
intangible (goodwill, patents, and so on), minus any liabilities.
 Dividend distributions. You like dividends? Value stocks are the ones
that pay them.
 The cover of Forbes. Magazine covers are rarely adorned with photos
of the CEOs of value companies. Growth companies are followed more
by everyone, and that includes Wall Street as well as the talking heads
on CNBC. Value companies can be obscure.
 Earnings growth. Growth companies’ earnings tend to impress. Value
companies tend to have less than awe-inspiring growth in earnings.
 The industry sector. Growth stocks are typically found in adolescent
industries, such as computers, biotech, wireless, and biotechnology.
Value stocks are more often found in older-than-the-hills sectors, such 
as energy, banking, transportation, and toiletries.
Best Buys
Many academic types have looked at the so-called value premium and have
tried to explain it. No one can agree on why value stocks have historically
outperformed growth stocks. (A joke I remember from my college days: Put
any three economists in a room, and you’ll get at least five opinions.)
Some people say there is hidden risk in value investing that warrants greater
returns. They explain that although the standard deviation for the two asset
classes is about the same, value stocks tend to plummet at the worst eco-
nomic times. Others say that value stocks outperform growth stocks because
of the greater dividends paid by value companies. Growth companies tend to
plow their cash into acquisitions and new product development rather than
issuing dividends to those pesky shareholders.
Here’s the best explanation for the value premium, if you ask this humble
author: Value stocks simply tend to be ignored by the market — or have been
in the past — and therefore come relatively cheap.
Doing it right
Famous value investors, like Warren Buffett, make their money finding stocks
that come at an especially low price. They recognize that companies making
lackluster profits, and even sometimes companies bleeding money, can turn
98
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

around (especially when Mr. Buffett sends in his team of whip-cracking con-
sultants). When a lackluster company turns around, the stock that was for-
merly seen as a financial turd (that’s a technical term) can suddenly turn to
14-karat gold. It’s a formula that has worked well for the Oracle of Omaha.
Good luck making it work for you.
For every Warren Buffett, there are a dozen stock pickers, maybe five dozen,
who repeatedly take gambles on failing companies that continue to fail. I say
the best way to invest in large value is to buy the index. There is no better
way of doing that than through ETFs.
Making your selection
Of the 30 or so diversified large cap ETFs on the market, five are worth partic-
ular attention. The following offer good large value indexes at reasonable
prices: the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV), iShares Morningstar Large Value (JKF),
iShares S&P 500 Value (IVE), streetTRACKS Dow Jones U.S. Large Cap Value
(ELV), and Rydex S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV).
I suggest that you read through my descriptions in the following section and
make the choice that you think is best for you. Whatever your allocation to
domestic large cap stocks (see Chapter 16 if you aren’t sure), your allocation
to value should be somewhere in the ballpark of 50 to 60 percent of that
amount. In other words, I suggest that you tilt toward value, but don’t go
overboard.
The Large Cap Value Winners
The criteria you use in picking the best large cap value ETF should include
expense ratios, appropriateness of the index, and tax efficiency. Here’s how
some of the top contenders compare. Note that the expense ratios, average
cap sizes, price/earning ratios, and top five holdings are all subject to change;
you should definitely check for updated figures before buying.
Vanguard Value ETF (VTV)
Indexed to: MSCI U.S. Prime Market Value Index (400 or so of the nation’s
largest value stocks)
99
Chapter 6: Large Value: Counterintuitive Cash Cows

Expense ratio: 0.11 percent
Average cap size: $45.1 billion
P/E ratio: 14.6
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil Corp., Citigroup, Bank of America, Pfizer,
General Electric
Russell’s review: The price is right. The index makes sense. There’s good
diversification. The companies represented are certainly large. This ETF is 
a very good option, although I’d like it a wee bit more if it were a tad more
valuey. (However, making it more valuey could increase turnover, which
might increase costs.) All told, I like the Vanguard Value ETF. I like it a lot. 
If you already own the Vanguard Value Index mutual fund, and you’re con-
sidering moving to ETFs, this fund would clearly be your choice (see “The
Vanguard edge” sidebar in Chapter 3).
iShares Morningstar Large Value (JKF)
Indexed to: Morningstar Large Value Index (94 of the largest U.S. value
stocks)
Expense ratio: 0.25 percent
Average cap size: $37.6 billion
P/E ratio: 12.7
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil Corp., Citigroup, Bank of America, Pfizer,
Altria Group
Russell’s review: Nothing in life is perfect. This ETF offers a greater lean
toward value than does the Vanguard option. The flip side is that the diversi-
fication leaves something to be desired: Exxon Mobil Corp. alone makes up
over 10 percent of this ETF, and that, in my mind, is less than ideal. To boot,
Morningstar indexes aren’t nearly as popular as S&P indexes, so this ETF is
thinly traded, which could result in a larger spread when you buy or sell. On
the positive side, however, Morningstar indexes are neat boxes: Any com-
pany that appears in the value index is not going to pop up in the growth
index. I think that’s worth something, for sure.

Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

iShares S&P 500 Value (IVE)
Indexed to: S&P 500/Citigroup Value Index (355 large value candidates
plucked from the companies that make up the S&P 500)
Expense ratio: 0.18 percent
Average cap size: $15.7 billion
P/E ratio: 15.6
Top five holdings: Citigroup, General Electric, Bank of America, JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Exxon Mobil Corp.
Russell’s review: The price is good, and the diversification is more than ade-
quate. My only beef — a small one — is that the selection could be more
tilted toward value. On the other hand, this ETF is the most popular among
the large value options, and therefore the buy and sell spreads (a penny here
and a penny there, but it could add up) should be slightly less than with, say,
the Morningstar iShare or the Vanguard Large Value. All in all, the iShares S&P
500 Value is a winner.
streetTRACKS Dow Jones U.S. 
Large Cap Value (ELV)
Indexed to: Start with the Wilshire 5000 (just about the whole shebang), and
select out the 347 largest and most valuey companies
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Average cap size: $102.0 billion
P/E ratio: 13.4
Top five holdings: Exxon Mobil Corp., General Electric, Citigroup, Bank of
America, Pfizer
Russell’s review: Nothing wrong here: reasonable price, reasonable ratios,
good company producing the index, and an index that makes sense. I’m not
sure this would be my first choice, if only because the price could still be
lower, but it wouldn’t be a bad option for most.
101
Chapter 6: Large Value: Counterintuitive Cash Cows

Rydex S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV)
Indexed to: Approximately 150 of the most valuey of the S&P 500 companies
Expense ratio: 0.35 percent
Average cap size: $17.7 billion
P/E ratio: 30.9
Top five holdings: Ryder Systems, Dillard’s, United States Steel, Ford Motor
Company, Albertsons
Russell’s review: The promise here is one of “purity.” You wouldn’t know 
it by looking at the cap size and P/E ratio, neither of which make this fund
look especially more pure than any other large value ETF. It is possible that
Rydex’s other selection criteria somehow add to purity. But is that purity of
style worth paying 0.35 percent for? Granted, that isn’t high by mutual fund
standards, but compared to the other large value options, it is pricey. I’d like
to see this fund prove itself. It can do that if it maintains extremely low corre-
lation to its growth counterpart. That proof will take time.

O
nce upon a time in the kingdom of Redmond, there was a young com-
pany called Microsoft. It was a very small company with very big ideas,
and it grew and grew and grew. Its founder and its original investors became
very, very rich and lived happily ever after.
Oh, you’ve heard that story? Then you understand the appeal of small
growth companies. These are companies that typically have market capital-
ization (the market value of total outstanding stock) of under $1 billion. They
frequently boast a hot product or patent, often fall into the high tech arena,
and seem to be on their way to stardom. Some of them make it, and along
with them, their investors take a joy ride all the way to early retirement.
Unfortunately, for every Microsoft, there are a dozen small companies that go
belly up long before their prime. For every investor who gambles on a small
company stock and takes early retirement, 100 others still take their cars to
work every Monday morning.
Beep beep.

In this chapter, I ask you to take a ride with me through the world of small
cap growth stocks. I explain what role, if any, they should play in your ETF
portfolio. First stop along the ride: Figure 7-1, where you see how small
growth fits into the investment style grid I introduce in Chapter 4. Second
stop: Figure 7-2, which shows that small growth stocks, at least over the past
eight decades, haven’t exactly lit the world on fire.
Let’s Get Real
In the past century, small cap stocks have outperformed large cap stocks just
as assuredly as Honduras produces more Hondurans than the United States.
The volatility of small cap stocks has also been greater, just as assuredly as
the United States has more roller coasters than Honduras. In terms of return
per unit of risk (risk-adjusted rate of return), however, small caps are clearly
winners. And so it would seem that investing in small caps is a pretty smart
thing to do. But please know that not all small caps are created equal.
As it happens, the true stars of the small cap world have been small cap
value stocks rather than small cap growth stocks. (Take a look at Chapters 5
and 6 if you aren’t sure what I mean by those terms.) How slow-growing, often
ailing companies have beat out their hot-to-trot cousins remains one of the
great unresolved mysteries of the investing world. But the numbers don’t lie.

In fact, if you look at the numbers, such as those in Figure 7-2, you may be
inclined to treat small growth stocks as a pariah. Please don’t. They belong in
a well-diversified portfolio. Some years are clearly small growth years. The
best example is rather recent: 2003. In that year, small growth was the undis-
puted King of Return, clocking in at an astounding 50.37 percent. And who is
to say that the past wasn’t a fluke and that small growth may actually go on
to outperform all other asset classes in the next 20 years?
Your Choices for Small Growth
If you have a portfolio of under $20,000 or so, I recommend that you consider
a small cap blend fund, which combines small value and small growth stocks.
Small cap domestic stocks shouldn’t occupy more than 20 percent or so of
your portfolio (more on that in Chapter 16), and if you divide up 20 percent
of less than $20,000, the trading costs could seriously impact your returns. So
keep it simple until your portfolio grows to the point that you can start slic-
ing and dicing a bit more economically.

Chapter 7: Small Growth: Sweet Sounding Start-ups

If you have a portfolio of over $20,000 and you are a buy-and-hold kind of guy
or gal, I suggest you break up your small cap holdings into growth and value.
Given the dramatic outperformance of value in the past, I suggest that you tilt
in that direction — more so than you do with large caps. A reasonable tilt
may call for somewhere between 60 and 75 of your small cap exposure going
to value, and 25 to 40 percent going to growth.
Small cap blend funds
A bit of growth, a bit of value, your choice in small cap blend funds should
take into consideration such things as expense ratios, average cap size, and
P/E ratio (which I explain in Chapter 5). Keep in mind that these numbers 
are subject to change, so I recommend checking them before you make any
purchases.
Some pretty good ETF options for people with limited sized portfolios include
the Vanguard Small Cap ETF (VB), iShares Morningstar Small Core (JKJ), iShares
S&P Small Cap 600 (IJR), and streetTRACKS Dow Jones Wilshire Small Cap (DSC).
Vanguard Small Cap ETF (VB)
Indexed to: MSCI U.S. Small Cap 1750 Index (1,750 broadly diversified smaller
U.S. companies)
Expense ratio: 0.10 percent
Average cap size: $1.6 billion
P/E ratio: 23.8
Top five holdings: Western Digital Corp., Martin Marietta Materials, AMR
Corporation, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Oshkosh Truck Corp.
Russell’s review: The expense ratio is half that of any other offering in the
small cap ETF arena. The diversification is lovely. And Vanguard’s ETFs —
largely because they are pegged to indexes with little turnover — are
arguably the most tax-efficient of all ETFs. Those are the three positives. On
the down side, the P/E ratio is higher than that of the competitors (an indica-
tion of a greater orientation toward growth and away from value), and so too
is the cap size. On balance, this is a very good selection, but, as with all blend
funds, I’d scrap it for something more refined — a growth and value split —
as soon as your portfolio is large enough to allow for such refinement.
106
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

iShares Morningstar Small Core (JKJ)
Indexed to: 383 companies from the Morningstar Small Core Index that fall
somewhere between growth and value
Expense ratio: 0.25 percent
Average cap size: $865 million
P/E ratio: 19.8
Top five holdings: Integrated Device Technology, Walter Industries,
Manitowoc Co., Jones Lang Lasalle, Sierra Pacific Resources
Russell’s review: The diversification isn’t quite what you get with Vanguard,
but it’s adequate. The somewhat lower P/E could translate into slightly higher
returns over the long haul, but that may be offset by the higher expense
ratio. These Morningstar iShares aren’t heavily traded, so you could get
zonked with a larger spread when you buy and sell.
iShares S&P Small Cap 600 (IJR)
Indexed to: Roughly 600 companies that make up the S&P Small Cap 600
Index
Expense ratio: 0.20
Average cap size: $883 million
P/E ratio: 17.5
Top five holdings: Oshkosh Truck Corp., NVR, Cimarex Energy Co., Frontier
Oil Corp., Resmed
Russell’s review: This is a perfectly acceptable ETF for small cap exposure at
a fair price. Vanguard’s price, however, is even more fair. If you already own
this ETF, that’s not reason enough to switch unless you’re holding a rather
large position to minimize the trading cost. But if you’re starting from scratch,
I don’t know if paying double the fee of Vanguard’s would be warranted.
streetTRACKS Dow Jones Wilshire Small Cap (DSC)
Indexed to: Start with the Wilshire 5000 (just about the whole shebang), and
select out the 1,744 smallest companies
Expense ratio: 0.25 percent
107
Chapter 7: Small Growth: Sweet Sounding Start-ups

Average cap size: $1.8 billion
P/E ratio: 17.9
Top five holdings: Akamai Technologies, Glamis Gold Ltd., SL Green Realty
Corp., Terex Corp., Intuitive Surgical
Russell’s review: Great diversification — perhaps a little too good, as 
the selection of companies seems to edge into the mid cap area a bit. The
expense ratio is higher — not ridiculously higher, but higher — than some
others in this category. Still, you could do much worse.
Strictly small cap growth funds
If you have enough assets to warrant splitting up small value and small
growth, go for it, by all means. Following are some very good small growth
options from iShares, Vanguard, and streetTRACKS. In the next chapter, I pre-
sent small value options to serve as compliments to the funds presented
here.
Vanguard Small Cap Growth ETF (VBK)
Indexed to: MSCI U.S. Small Cap Growth Index (approximately 970 small
growth capitalization companies in the United States)
Expense ratio: 0.12 percent
Average cap size: $1.6 billion
P/E ratio: 28.8
Top five holdings: Western Digital Corp., AMR Corp., Vertex Pharmaceuticals,
Oshkosh Truck Corp., The Corporate Executive Board
Russell’s review: I’m not entirely sure why Vanguard charges 0.02 percent
more for this fund than it does for its small cap blend ETF, but, hey, that’s
only $2 a year for every $10,000 invested, and it’s still the best deal in town.
Add to that the wide diversification, tax efficiency beyond compare, and a
very definite growth bias, and I really have no complaints. The Vanguard
Small Cap Growth ETF offers an excellent way to tap into this asset class.
108
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

iShares Morningstar Small Growth Index (JKK)
Indexed to: Approximately 370 companies from the Morningstar Small
Growth Index
Expense ratio: 0.30 percent
Average cap size: $850 million
P/E ratio: 28.3
Top five holdings: Rambus, Silicon Laboratories, PMC-Sierra, Hologic,
Trimble Navigation Ltd.
Russell’s review: My only beef with the Morningstar indexes is that they tend to
be a bit too concentrated in the large cap arena. In small caps, that isn’t a prob-
lem. The largest holding here, Rambus, gets but a 1.1 percent allocation, which
is perfectly acceptable. The expense ratio, too, is acceptable, although higher
than some others in this category. I like that Morningstar promises no crossover
between growth and value. If you own this ETF along with the iShares Morning-
star Small Value Index, you should get pleasantly low correlation.
iShares S&P Small Cap 600 Growth (IJT)
Indexed to: Despite the “600” in the title, this ETF represents 354 holdings
chosen from the S&P Small Cap 600/Citigroup Growth Index
Expense ratio: 0.25 percent
Average cap size: $734 million
P/E ratio: 16.7
Top five holdings: NVR, Cimarex Energy Co., Global Payments, Frontier Oil
Corp., Resmed
Russell’s review: S&P indexes are a bit too subjective for me to really love
them. I’m also a slight bit baffled by the current P/E ratio of this fund, which
is actually lower than the iShares S&P Small Cap Value 600 Index fund (IJS). It
should be the other way around. (See what I mean about subjective?) Of
course, P/E ratios can fluctuate greatly from week to week, especially with
small cap funds. Nonetheless, this fund’s price is reasonable, and there’s no
reason to snub this iShares offering. Still, it isn’t my first pick.
109
Chapter 7: Small Growth: Sweet Sounding Start-ups

streetTRACKS DJ Wilshire Small Cap Growth (DSG)
Indexed to: Start with the Wilshire 5000 (just about the whole shebang), and
select out the 875 smallest and growthiest companies
Expense ratio: 0.25 percent
Average cap size: $1.8 billion
P/E ratio: 21.5
Top five holdings: Glamis Gold Ltd., Akamai Technologies, Fmc Technologies,
Intuitive Surgical, Western Gas Resources
Russell’s review: Sure, I could live with this ETF in my portfolio. I might 
even be happy. But is there any reason to pay 0.25 percent, when Vanguard 
is charging half that? Maybe, but it would take something more than I see to
convince me.
Rydex S&P 600 Small Cap Pure Growth (RZG)
Indexed to: Approximately 140 of the smallest and most growthy of the S&P
600 companies
Expense ratio: 0.35
Average cap size: $1.2 billion
P/E ratio: 27.5
Top five holdings: Coinstar, Biolase Technology, Ceradyne, Christopher &
Banks Corp., Odyssey HealthCare
Russell’s review: The price is higher than others in this category, and the
promise of “purity” is a big murky — especially if the quest for purity leads to
high turnover, which could reduce tax efficiency. Rydex also seems to cater
most to traders rather than buy-and-hold investors, and that gives me some-
thing of a feeling of discomfort. Traders usually trade themselves into losses.
Smaller than Small: Meet the Micro Caps
If you want to invest your money in companies that are smaller than small,
you’re going to be investing in micro caps. These are companies larger than
the corner delicatessen, but not by much. In general, micro caps are publicly
110
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

held companies with less than $250 million in outstanding stock. Micro caps,
as you can imagine, are volatile little suckers, but as a group they offer impres-
sive long-term performance figures. In terms of diversification, micro caps —
in conservative quantity — are a nice addition to most portfolios.
Micros move at a modestly different pace than do other equity asset classes.
It is generally theorized that because micro caps are heavy borrowers, their
performance is more tied to interest rates than are larger cap stocks. (Lower
interest rates would be good; higher interest rates would not.) Micro caps
also tend to be more tied to the vicissitudes of the U.S. economy and less to
the world economy than, say, the fortunes of General Electric or McDonald’s.
Given the high risk of owning any individual micro cap, it makes eminent
sense to work micro caps into your portfolio with ETFs. To date, but three
micro cap ETFs have been introduced. They differ from one another to a
much greater extent than do the larger cap ETFs, although all three are cer-
tainly acceptable options.
iShares Russell Microcap Index (IWC)
Indexed to: 1,240 of the smallest publicly traded companies, all culled from
the Russell 3000 Index
Expense ratio: 0.60 percent
Average cap size: $425 million
P/E ratio: 21
Top five holdings: Trident Microsystems, Brightpoint, Nuance
Communications, Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Stratasys
Russell’s review: There aren’t a lot of choices in this field, so I’m glad this 
is one of them. I’m not crazy about paying 0.60 percent, which is high for an
ETF, but there seems to be price collusion in the micro cap area, so what are
you going to do? (Personal note to ETF firms’ attorneys: Hey, I’m only kidding
about the price collusion, guys! It just seems that way.)
111
Chapter 7: Small Growth: Sweet Sounding Start-ups

PowerShares Zacks Microcap Index (PZI)
Indexed to: The proprietary ZAX Index, which includes roughly 400 micro
cap stocks chosen for “investment merit criteria, including fundamental
growth, stock valuation, investment timeliness . . . .” In other words, someone
behind the scenes is stock picking.
Expense ratio: 0.60 percent
Average cap size: $342 million
P/E ratio: 19.7
Top five holdings: Biogen IDEC, Applera Applied Biosystems, Gilead
Sciences, Sigma-Aldrich, Amgen
Russell’s review: I don’t like stock picking, and I don’t generally trust any
manager to know what qualifies as “investment timeliness.” Still, this ETF’s
selections yield an average cap size that makes it, in my mind, a serious con-
tender, despite the active management.
First Trust Dow Jones Select Microcap Index (FDM)
Indexed to: Dow Jones Select MicroCap Index, which contains about 280 of
the smallest stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American
Stock Exchange, and the NASDAQ
Expense ratio: 0.60
Average cap size: $622 million
P/E ratio: 20
Top five holdings: General Cable Corp., Brightpoint, Mobile Mini, Giant
Industries, Atlas America
Russell’s review: The price is competitive, and everything else looks okay,
but the cap size is considerably larger than the other two micros — and isn’t
smallness the whole reason to be in micro caps in the first place?

L
ook at the list of some the top ten companies represented in the
Vanguard Small Value ETF: Martin Marietta Materials, United Dominion
Realty, Federal Realty Investment Trust, Beazer Homes USA. These are not
household names. Nor are they especially fast-growing companies. Nor are
they industry leaders. Nor are they in exciting new industries poised for
potential huge growth. As you go further down the list of holdings, you’ll
likely find some companies in financial distress. Others may be facing serious
lawsuits, expiration of patents, or labor unrest. If you wanted to pick one of
these companies to sink a wad of cash into, I would tell you that you’re crazy.
But if you wanted to sink that cash into the entire small value index, well,
that’s another matter altogether. Assuming you could handle some risk, I’d
tell you to go for it. By all means. Your odds of making money are pretty
darned good. At least if history is our guide.
Don’t take my word for it; see Figure 8-2, which shows the enormous growth
of value stocks over the past eight decades. On the way there, see Figure 8-1,
which shows where small value fits into the investment style grid I introduce
in Chapter 4. And then, follow me as I explain the importance of small value
stocks in a poised-for-performance ETF portfolio.

It’s Been Quite a Ride
Small value stocks collectively have returned more to investors than have
either large value stocks or any kind of growth stocks. In fact, the difference
in returns has been somewhat staggering: I’m talking about an annualized
return of about 14.5 percent over the past 77 years for small value, versus
11.5 percent for large value, 9.5 for large growth, and 9.4 for small growth.
Compounded over time, the outperformance of small value stocks has 
been HUGE.
Latching on for fun and profit
To be sure, small value stocks are risky little suckers. Even the entire index
(available to you in neat ETF form) is more volatile than any conservative
investor would feel comfortable with. But as part — a very handsome part —
of a diversified portfolio, a small value ETF can be a beautiful thing indeed.

Source: Fama/French data provided by Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French
If we knew the past was going to repeat, such as it did in the movie Ground-
hog Day, there’d be no reason to have anything but small value in your port-
folio. But, of course, we don’t know that the past will repeat. Bill Murray’s
radio alarm clock may not go off at sunrise. And the small value premium,
like Bill Murray’s hairline, may start to seriously recede. Still, the outperfor-
mance of small value has historically been so much greater than that of small
growth that I favor a good tilt in the direction of value.
But keeping your balance
Whatever your total allocation to domestic small cap stocks (see Chapter 16
for advice), I recommend that anywhere from 60 to 75 percent of that amount
be allocated to small value. But no more than that, please. If the value pre-
mium disappears or becomes a value discount, I don’t want you left holding
the bag. And even if small value continues to outperform, having both small
value and small growth (along with their bigger cousins, all of which tend to
rise and fall in different cycles) will help smooth out some of the inevitable
volatility of holding stocks.

Chapter 8: Small Value: Diminutive Dazzlers

Good choices among small value ETFs include offerings from Vanguard,
iShares, and streetTRACKS.
Vanguard Small Cap Value ETF (VBR)
Indexed to: MSCI U.S. Small Cap Value Index (about 950 small value domestic
companies)
Expense ratio: 0.12 percent
Average cap size: $1.6 billion
P/E ratio: 20.1
Top five holdings: Camden Property Trust REIT, Conseco, Federal Realty
Investment Trust REIT, Harsco, Ryder System
Russell’s review: Low cost, wide diversification, tax efficiency beyond com-
pare, and a very definite value bias — what’s not to like? The Vanguard Small
Cap Value ETF offers an excellent way to tap into this asset class.
iShares Morningstar Small Value Index (JKL)
Indexed to: 338 of Morningstar’s Small Value Index
Expense ratio: 0.30 percent
Average cap size: $910 million
P/E ratio: 15.5
Top five holdings: Foster Wheeler Ltd., Trinity Industries, Ciena Corp.,
Brandywine Realty Trust, New Century Financial Corp.
Russell’s review: My only complaint with the Morningstar indexes is that
they tend to be a bit too concentrated in the large cap arena. In small caps,
that isn’t a problem. The largest holding here, Foster Wheeler Ltd., gets
slightly less than a 1 percent allocation, which is perfectly good. The expense
ratio, too, is acceptable, although higher than some others in this category. I
like that Morningstar promises no crossover between growth and value. If
you own this ETF along with the iShares Morningstar Small Growth Index, you
should get pleasantly low correlation.
116
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

iShares S&P Small Cap 600 Value Index (IJS)
Indexed to: 457 of the S&P Small Cap 600/Citigroup Value Index
Expense ratio: 0.25 percent
Average cap size: $592 million
P/E ratio: 19.1
Top five holdings: Commercial Metals Co., Shurgard Storage Centers,
Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co., Energen Corp., Standard Pacific Corp.
Russell’s review: S&P indexes are a bit too subjective for me to want to
marry them. I’m also a slight bit baffled by the current P/E ratio of this fund,
which is actually higher than the iShares S&P Small Cap Growth fund (IJT). It
shouldn’t be that way. (That’s what I mean about subjective.) Of course, P/E
ratios can change from week to week, especially with small cap funds. None-
theless, this fund’s price is reasonable, and there’s no reason to snub this
iShares offering. But you may do better elsewhere.
streetTRACKS DJ Wilshire Small Cap Value (DSV)
Indexed to: Start with the Wilshire 5000 (just about the whole shebang), and
select out the 876 smallest and most valuey companies
Expense ratio: 0.25 percent
Average cap size: $1.9 billion
P/E ratio: 15.9
Top five holdings: Allegheny Technologies, AMR Corp., LSI Logic Corp., Terex
Corp, SL Green Realty Corp.
Russell’s review: Sure, I could live with this ETF in my portfolio. I might even
be happy. But is there any reason to pay 0.25 percent when Vanguard is
charging half that for its small value offering? Maybe, but it would take some-
thing more than I see to convince me.
117
Chapter 8: Small Value: Diminutive Dazzlers

Rydex S&P 600 Small Cap Pure Value (RZV)
Indexed to: Approximately 180 of the most valuey and small of the S&P 600
companies
Expense ratio: 0.35
Average cap size: $590 million
P/E ratio: 43.2
Top five holdings: Alliance One International, Startek, Central Vermont
Public Service Corp., Planar Systems, Schulman A
Russell’s review: The price is higher than others in this category, and the
promise of “purity” is a bit murky, especially if that quest for purity leads to
high turnover and that blows the tax efficiency. Rydex also seems to cater
most to traders rather than buy-and-hold investors, which gives me some-
thing of a feeling of discomfort. Traders usually trade themselves into misery.
What About the Mid Caps?
In a word, my take on mid cap ETFs is . . . why? Yes, even as I’m writing these
words, mid cap stocks — investments in companies with roughly $5 to $20
billion in outstanding stock — have decidedly outperformed both large and
small cap stocks for the past 12 months. But such outperformance of mid cap
stocks is a fluke. So, too, is any underperformance.
If you look at the risk/return profile of mid caps over many years, you 
find that it generally falls right where you would expect it to fall: smack in
between large and small cap. Owning both a large cap and small cap ETF,
therefore, will give you an average return very similar to mid caps but with
considerably less volatility because large and small cap stocks tend to move
up and down at different times.
Other investment pros may disagree, but I really don’t see the point of shop-
ping for mid cap ETFs, even though there are many mid cap offerings. Keep in
mind, too, that most large cap and small cap funds are rather fluid: You will
get some mid cap exposure from both. Many sector funds — including real
estate, technology, and utilities — are also chock full of mid caps (see
Chapter 9).

In This Chapter
 Comparing sector investing to style investing
 Weighing the pros and cons of each
 Listing the ETFs that work best for sector investing

 Knowing how much to allocate
A
ny Star Trek fan (yeah, beam me up) knows that matter and antimatter,
should they ever meet, would result in an explosion so violent as to pos-
sibly destroy the entire universe or, at the very least, mess Donald Trump’s
hair. Despite the firm convictions of zealots on both sides, style investing
(large-small-growth-value) and sector investing (technology-utilities-healthcare-
energy) are not matter and antimatter. They can, and sometimes do, exist
very peacefully side-by-side.
In this chapter, I present the nuts and bolts of sector investing: how it can
function alone, or in conjunction with style investing, to build a well-diversi-
fied portfolio. Either way you decide to slice the pie — style or sector —
using ETFs as building blocks makes for an excellent strategy. (Hmm, am I
starting to sound like a zealot myself?)
Yes, there are now 70 industry sector ETFs. You can find one to mirror every
one of the major industry sectors in the U.S. economy, including energy, basic
materials, financial services, consumer goods, and so on. See the industry
sector map in Figure 9-1 for a bird’s eye view of the U.S. economy split into
industry sectors, each accorded its proper allotment.

Based on Morningstar data, this map reveals the size of 11 major industry
sectors of the U.S. economy. What you’re seeing is the total capitalization of
all public companies within each industry group.
Some of the newer ETFs mirror subsections of the economy, such as semicon-
ductors (a subset of computer technology) and biotechnology (a subset of
healthcare). In some cases, sectors of the economy you may not even know
exist — such as nanotech and water resources — are represented with ETFs!
A handful of the Barclays iShares, such as Global Healthcare and Global
Telecommunications, even allow you to invest in industry sectors abroad
(which are not represented in Figure 9-1).
Speculating on the Next Hot Industry
Is there a God? Does he have a long, white beard, and does he wear sandals?
Why do sector investors tend to be speculators, while style investors tend to
be buy-and-hold kinds of people? These are questions that sometimes keep
me awake at night. I won’t attempt to address the first two here. As for the
third . . . heck, I have no idea. But there’s little question that people who
divide their portfolios into large-small-value-growth are much more likely to
be long-term investors with long-term strategies than are people who buy
into sectors (often through ETFs). That’s just the way it is.

Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

Sizzling and sinking
Sector funds are often purchased by investors who think they know which
sectors are going to shine, and goshdarnit, they’re going to profit by it.
Unfortunately, they are often wrong.
I’m old enough to recall a day when environmental service companies, by
dint of the realization that pollution was becoming a serious problem, were
going to be a sure bet. But then, lo and behold, environmental service compa-
nies seriously lagged the overall market for years. Then it was computer and
Web technology that couldn’t possibly fail to outperform, yet for three brutal
years (2000–2002), the technology sector fell like hail. At the time of this writ-
ing, energy is the sector that people are pouring money into. Utilities are also
hot (just as they were prior to the stock market crash of 1929). By the time
this book comes out, well . . .
Momentum riders and bottom feeders
Interestingly, while most investors are momentum investors — they tend to
buy what’s lately been hot — other investors look for what’s been down, on
the theory that everything reverts to the mean. The two camps are forever
trading sector funds. Right now, the momentum investors are buying energy,
utilities, real estate, and precious metals; the bottom feeders (I’m not sure
what they call themselves) are buying technology and consumer goods.
Fortunately (or unfortunately), there is no dearth of ETFs to please both
crowds.
You can tell from my tone, no doubt, that I’m no big fan of sector speculation —
or speculation of any sort. But what about using sector ETFs as buy-and-hold
instruments? Even though few people do it, can a buy-and-hold portfolio be
just as easily and effectively divided up by industry sector as it can by invest-
ment style?
Choosing Sector Investing 
Instead of the Grid?
An in-depth study on industry-sector investing, done several years ago by
Chicago-based Ibbotson Associates (now part of Morningstar), came to the
very favorable conclusion that sector investing — because times have
121
Chapter 9: Sector Investing: ETFs According to Industry

allegedly changed — is potentially a superior diversifier than grid (style)
investing. (I discuss the style grid in Chapters 4 and 5.) Globalization has led
to a rise in correlation between domestic and international stocks; large, mid,
and small cap stocks have high correlation to each other. A company’s per-
formance is tied more to its industry than to the country where it’s based or
the size of its market cap, concluded Ibbotson.
The Ibbotson report didn’t end there. It also ballyhooed sector investing 
as a superior instrument for fine-tuning a portfolio to match an individual
investor’s risk tolerance. A conservative investor might overweight utilities
and finances (two less volatile sectors); a more aggressive investor might tilt
toward technology (whooeee).
That sounds like a good plan, although the lead author of that study once
confided to me that he has the bulk of his personal portfolio still broken up
into value, growth, large, and small — as do I. However, we both have some
industry sector ETFs (for fine-tuning), as well.
Doing sector investing right
If you are going to go the sector route and build your entire stock portfolio,
or a good part of it, out of industry sector ETFs, I suggest that before you do
anything, take a look at Figure 9-1. Make sure you have allocations to all 11
major sectors of the economy.
Some advisors would tell you to keep your allocations roughly in accordance
with each sector’s overall size. I dunno. Had you done that in 1999, your port-
folio would have been three-quarters technology, given the gross overpricing
of the sector at that point. And you would have taken a bath the next year. I’d
rather see a more even allocation.
Start perhaps with a roughly equal allocation as your home base, and then
start tweaking — not based on crystal ball predictions of the future, but
rather on the unique characteristics of each sector. What do I mean? Read on.
Seeking risk adjustment with high 
and low volatility sectors
Some industry sectors have historically evidenced greater return and greater
risk. (Return and risk tend to go hand-in-hand, as I discuss in Chapter 4.) The
same rules that apply to style investing apply to sector investing. Know how
122
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

much volatility you can stomach, and then, and only then, build your portfo-
lio in tune with your risk tolerance.
As far as historical risk and return, Figure 9-2 shows an approximation of how
the major sectors rank. Keep in mind that any single sector — even utilities,
the least volatile of all — will tend to be more volatile than the entire market
because there is little diversification. Don’t overindulge!
Also, keep in mind that your allocation between bonds and stocks will almost
certainly have much more bearing on your overall level of risk and return
than will your mix of stocks. In Part III of this book, I introduce bonds and 
discuss how an ETF investor should hold them.
Knowing where the grid comes through
There is nothing wrong per se with dividing up a stock portfolio into industry
sectors, but please, don’t be hasty in scraping style investing. I really believe
that if you’re going to pick one strategy over the other, the edge goes to style
investing. For one thing, we know that it works. Style investing helps to dif-
fuse (but certainly not eliminate) risk. Scads of data show that.
In addition, style investing allows you to take advantage of years of other data
that indicate you can goose returns without raising your risk by leaning your
portfolio toward value and small cap (see Chapters 6, 7, and 8). When you
invest in industry sectors through ETFs, you are investing the vast majority of

123
Chapter 9: Sector Investing: ETFs According to Industry

your funds in large caps, and you’re splitting growth and value evenly. That may
limit your investment success.
Another reason ETF investors shouldn’t scrap style investing: Style ETFs are
the way cheaper choice. For whatever reason — yes, another one of those
eternal mysteries that keep me awake at night — style ETFs tend to cost one-
half to one-third as much as industry-sector ETFs do. That’s true for the
Vanguard ETFs, the Barclays iShares, and the State Street Global Advisors’
SPDRs and streetTRACKS. Go figure.
And one final reason to prefer style to sector for the core of your portfolio:
You will require fewer funds. With large growth, large value, small growth,
and small value, you pretty much can capture the entire stock market. With
sector funds, well, you would need nearly a dozen to achieve the same effect.
Each sector fund, because the performance of all companies within an indus-
try sector tend to be closely correlated, offers minimal diversification.
Combining strategies to 
optimize your portfolio
There’s no point to having dozens of ETFs in your portfolio if they are only
going to replicate each other’s holdings. So if you already own the entire
market through diversified ETFs in all corner quadrants of the style grid —
large, small, value, and growth — why add any industry sectors that are 
obviously already represented?
Well, it would make sense to add, say, a peppering of semiconductor stocks
or utility stocks if you knew that semiconductors or utilities were going to
blast off. Of course, a rational investor would never say he or she knew any-
thing about the future.
And yet, taking on an added dose of semiconductors or utilities may still
make sense if that added dose of either industry sector somehow were to
raise your performance potential without raising risk. That could happen
only if you chose an industry sector that is loosely correlated to the majority
of the market.
124
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

Seeking low correlations 
for added diversification
Some sectors, even though they are part of the stock market, tend to move
out of lockstep with the rest of the market. By way of example, consider
REITs: real estate investment trusts. (If you look for REITs in Figure 9-1, you
find them buried under “Financial Services.”) I devote Chapter 13 entirely to
REITs, and especially REIT ETFs.
Another sector that fits the bill, at least of late, is energy. Yes, Exxon Mobil
Corp. and Chevron are part of the entire market, but they tend to zig when
everything else zags (probably because when the price of oil rises, these
companies profit more, while the rest of the economy, at least outside of
Texas, suffers).
For example, consider that in 2002, when the total U.S. stock market tanked
by almost 11 percent, REITs were up 31 percent. In 2001, when the total U.S.
stock market tanked by nearly 11 percent, REITs were up more than 12 per-
cent. The year 2005 was pretty lackluster for the total stock market, yet
energy stocks were up 31 percent.
Of course, there are years when it works the other way, and these sectors
may fall way short of the overall market. This year perhaps?!
In Chapter 16, where I draw up some sample portfolios, you’ll see more of
REITs and energy.
If you decide to build your portfolio around industry sector funds, I urge you
to at the very least dip into the style funds to give yourself the value/small
cap tilt that I discuss in the four chapters prior to this one. That’s especially
true if you use SPDRs or HOLDRS to build your sector portfolio. Those two
125

Newness is a red flag
At about 70 and counting, you can find an ETF to
mirror just about any sector or subsector of the
economy. The latest arrivals include a host of
commodity ETFs, including silver and oil futures.
And new ones are sure to arrive shortly.
Proceed with caution. New sector offerings
occur most often after recent run-ups in price.
The sector is hot. The public is buying. The
financial industry is accommodating. Everyone
is happy, for the moment. But there may be a
balloon about to burst.

fund groups are especially weighted toward large cap. Again, in Chapter 16, I
offer a few sample portfolios to illustrate workable allocations.
Sector Choices by the Dozen
After you decide which industry sectors you wish to invest in, you need 
to pick and choose among ETFs. Barclays iShares offers 20 selections.
PowerShares has 21. State Street offers a dozen SPDRs and a half dozen
streetTRACKS options. Vanguard has a dozen sector funds. And 16 Merrill
Lynch HOLDRS focus on industry groupings.
Begin your sector selection here:
 Do you want representation in large industry sectors (healthcare,
technology, utilities)? Your options include Vanguard ETFs, Barclays
iShares, and Select Sector SPDRs.
 Do you want to zero in on very narrow industry niches (insurance, oil
service, nanotech)? Consider streetTRACKS, PowerShares, and Merrill
Lynch HOLDRS.
 Do you want to keep your expense ratios to a minimum? Vanguard
ETFs and Select Sector SPDRs cost about half as much as PowerShares
and Barclays iShares.
In the following sections, I give you a more in-depth view of the sector offer-
ings available to you.

Fill your domestic stock portfolio with Vanguard’s 11 industry sector ETFs,
and presto! You’ve captured just about the entire universe of stocks. Granted,
that universe will be weighted in such a manner that you’ll have only token
representation of mid and small caps (although you’ll have more small cap
exposure than you would with either SPDRs or HOLDRS).
The one exception is the Vanguard REIT Index ETF (VNQ). Principally a mid
cap fund, VNQ is a prince among ETFs. With an expense ratio of 0.12 percent,
it is the least expensive of all industry sector ETFs. It is also well diversified
within its own real estate universe. If you’re going to own a REIT ETF,
Vanguard’s selection is an excellent choice. (See Chapter 13 for more on
REITs.) All other Vanguard ETFs carry an expense ratio of 0.25 percent — 
the same as most of the SPDRs.
In general, Vanguard ETFs, based on MSCI indexes, and the Select Sector
SPDRs, based on S&P indexes, are your best building blocks for a portfolio
sliced and diced by industry sectors. They are also excellent options for pep-
pering a grid-based portfolio with sector funds.

Overall, I put the Select Sector SPDRs on a par with the Vanguard sector
ETFs. The biotech, homebuilders, and semiconductor SPDRs will cost you
0.35 percent. The others — representing larger industry groupings — will
cost you the same as the Vanguard ETFs, either 0.24 or 0.25 percent. Those
nine others, however, are the ones that you most want if you wish to build a
domestic stock portfolio around industry sectors.
As the S&P indexes upon which the Select Sector SPDRs are built tend to rep-
resent mostly large cap companies, I urge anyone building a SPDR portfolio to
tap into small caps through some other means, such as buying into one of the
small cap ETFs discussed in Chapters 7 and 8.
If you’re going to invest in sector funds, know that the SPDRs Web site —
www.spdrindex.com — is full of fabulous tools. Check out especially the
Correlation Tracker, SPDR Map of the Market, and the Sector Tracker. (No,
you don’t have to be a SPDRs investor to use the tools.)

The three KBW Capital Markets Index offerings are simply too narrow indus-

Index is too expensive: 0.50 percent. And the streetTRACKS REIT index — at
0.25 percent — is, although perfectly acceptable an investment, twice as

As you may be aware by now, I like Barclays. I like their style funds. As I dis-
cuss in the next chapter, I like many of their international funds. As far as
bond ETFs, they are the only game in town, and they don’t abuse it. As for
industry sector funds, however, Barclays simply charges too much. With the
exception of the iShares Cohen & Steers Realty Majors Index (REIT) ETF,
129

which carries an expense ratio of 0.35 percent, all the other iShares sector
options are 0.50 or (in most cases) 0.60 percent. That’s more than double the
cost of either the Vanguard ETFs or Select Sector SPDRs.

On the down side, PowerShares charges 0.60 percent: more than twice as
much as Vanguard ETFs or Select Sector SPDRs. They are also “dynamic,”
which means that the indexes are actively managed (someone somewhere is
picking stocks). Many investors would see that as a plus; I don’t. It means
130
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

added expense (both upfront and behind the scenes) and a possible loss of
tax efficiency. On the up side, however, PowerShares’s selection of industry
groupings has been innovative, to say the least.
Whereas I wouldn’t suggest building an entire portfolio of PowerShares
sector ETFs, if you’re looking to sprinkle some noncorrelating holdings into
an otherwise well-diversified portfolio, PowerShares may have something to
offer. I’m especially intrigued with the WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW) and
the Water Resources ETF (PHO). Investing in companies that provide alterna-
tive fuels and companies that provide filtration and delivery of drinking
water, these two ETFs, so far, seem to have sweetly low correlations to the
broad market. I’m keeping an eye on them.

Chapter 9: Sector Investing: ETFs According to Industry

If it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck, goes 
the old saying — which happens to be wrong. Holding Company Depositary
Receipts (HOLDRS) look and quack just like ETFs, but technically, they’re
geese. They’re close enough to the target, however, that I include a discus-
sion of HOLDRS in the book. Ready? Here it comes.
You buy HOLDRS just like a stock or an ETF. But there’s a difference. You get a
basket of stocks — up to 20 — which you actually own. At any point, you can
redeem your HOLDRS shares for the stocks themselves. (You can’t do that
with ETFs.) The price is dirt cheap, but the payment method is a bit compli-
cated. Instead of a management fee, you pay $8 per HOLDR. Assuming you
bought 100 shares of a HOLDR with a market price of $100, the annual fee on
your $10,000 investment would be $8 (or 0.08 percent). That fee comes out of
dividends and cash distributions, and if there are no dividends or cash distri-
butions, you don’t pay a thing.
I can’t complain about any of the above, but what makes HOLDRS inappropri-
ate investments for most laypeople is their concentration. Some of the
HOLDRS have as few as a half dozen stocks. In some cases, such as with the
Biotech HOLDRS, two company stocks — Genentech and Amgen — make up
almost two-thirds of the value of the entire holdings. That isn’t diversification.
132

Unhealthy investments
Word on the street is that the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently sitting
on applications for a dozen new ETFs that would
track companies involved in treating specific
diseases. Soon, if the SEC allows it, you’ll be
able to invest in the Ferghana-Wellspring (FW)
Derma and Wound Care Index Fund, or the FW
Metabolic-Endocrine Disorders Index Fund, or
the FW Respiratory/Pulmonary Index Fund. The
firm has also applied to issue two Cancer Index
funds: one for large caps, and another for small.
I can think of no good reason to take a gamble
on such small market niches. Should a cure to
cancer be found, the company that nails it will
probably see its stock skyrocket, for sure. The
other however-many companies? Their stocks
may well plummet. If you’re holding the entire
basket, it’s a flip of the coin to say which way
your investment may head. If you like flipping
coins, fine, but please don’t bet your retirement
money on such foolishness.

f you were standing on a ship in the middle of the ocean (doesn’t matter
whether it’s the Atlantic or Pacific), and you looked up and squinted real
hard, you might see investment dollars sailing overhead. Of all the money
that U.S. fund investors added to their portfolios in 2005, an astounding 70
percent went to funds that invest overseas.
The reason for the rush is clear: Simply look at the recent returns of U.S.
stocks versus foreign stocks.
As of March 31, 2006, per Morningstar Principia, the three-year annualized
return for the SPDR 500 (SPY), an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 Index, was an
impressive 16.93 percent. The iShares Dow Jones U.S. Total Market (IYY) had
even better gains: 18.53 percent. But those numbers pale in comparison to
the 27.57 annualized return of the iShares S&P Europe 350 (IEV), or the 27.80
yearly return of the iShares MSCI Japan Index (EWJ). The average emerging
markets fund, the undisputed leader of the pack, returned an astounding
44.50 percent per year.

Yes, investors just love to chase hot money. And usually, I would caution
them not to. In this case, however, most Americans had been woefully under-
invested abroad, so I see the recent turn as a decidedly good thing. I’m glad
most investors have finally started to send their dollars abroad — even
though they’re doing it, by and large, for an entirely wrong reason.
In this chapter, I explain my love for international diversification and reveal
how you can accomplish it painlessly with ETFs.
The Ups and Downs of Different 
Markets around the World
If you expect international stocks to continue to clock such phenomenal
returns, you are sure to be disappointed. I do think you can expect that for-
eign stocks may do better than U.S. stocks in the coming decade or two. (If
you want the nitty-gritty of my reasoning, see the section “Why ETFs are a
great tool for international investing.”) But I certainly wouldn’t bet the farm
on international stock outperforming. Or U.S. stock. The difference in returns
in the future, as it has been in the past, is not likely to be all that extreme.
In all likelihood, international stocks will have their day. U.S. stocks will then
come up from behind. Then international stocks will have their day again.
And then U.S. stocks will get the jump. This type of horse race has been going
on since, oh, long before Mr. Ed was on the air. Take a look at Figure 10-1.
Note (as depicted by the hills and valleys in the chart) that over the past 30
years, outperformance by U.S. stocks versus non-U.S. stocks has been fol-
lowed quite regularly by years of underperformance.
The reason to invest abroad isn’t primarily to try to outperform the Joneses . . .
or the LeBlancs, or the Yamashitas. Rather, the purpose is to diversify your
portfolio so as to capture overall stock market gains while tempering risk.
You reduce risk whenever you own two or more asset classes that move up
and down at different times. Stocks of different nations tend to do exactly
that.
Low correlation is the name of the game
Why, you may ask, do you need European and Japanese stocks when you
already have all the lovely diversification discussed in past chapters: large,
134
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

small, value, and growth stocks, and a good mix of industries? (See Chapter 5
if you need a reminder of what these terms mean.) The answer, mon ami, mi
amigo, is quite simple: You get better diversification when you diversify
across borders.
Copyright 2006. T. Rowe Price. All rights reserved.
I’ll use several of Barclays iShare ETFs to illustrate my point. Suppose you
have a wad of money invested in the iShares S&P 500 Growth Index fund
(IVW), and you want to diversify:
 If you combine your large growth ETF with the large value counterpart,
the iShares S&P 500 Value Index fund (IVE), you find that your two
investments have a five-year correlation of 0.92 percent. In other words,
92 percent of the time over the past five years, the funds moved in 
the same direction. Eight percent of the time, they moved in opposite
directions.
 If you invest in the iShares S&P Small Cap 600 Growth Index fund (IJT),
you find that your two investments have hugged the same performance
line roughly 84 percent of the time in the past five years.
 If you invest in the iShares S&P Small Cap 600 Value Index fund (IJS),
your investments tend to move in synch only 78 percent of time. Not
bad. But not great.
But now consider adding some Japanese stock to your original portfolio of
large growth stocks. The iShares MSCI Japan Index fund (EWJ) has tended to
move in synch with large U.S. growth stocks only about 34 percent of the

time. That’s diversification. And that’s what makes international investing a
must for a well-balanced portfolio.
Remember what happened to Japan
To just “stay home” would be to exhibit the very same conceit seen among
Japanese investors in 1990. If you recall, that’s when the dynamic and seem-
ingly all-powerful rising sun slipped and then sank. Japanese investors, hold-
ing domestic-stuffed portfolios, bid sayonara to two-thirds of their wealth,
which, 16 years later, they have yet to fully recapture. It could happen here.
Or worse.
Finding Your Best Mix of Domestic 
and International
About two-thirds of the entire world stock market is now outside of the
United States. Should you invest two-thirds of your stock portfolio in foreign
ETFs? No, I think that may be overdoing it. Many financial experts say 15 
to 25 percent of your stock holdings should be international, which is woe-
fully underdoing it. I say 40 to 50 percent of your stock portfolio should be
international — and I feel rather strongly about that range.
Why putting two-thirds of your portfolio 
in foreign stocks is too much
First, when you invest abroad, you are usually investing in stocks that are
denominated in other currencies. I wish someone would offer a series of
dollar-hedged international ETFs, but such is not the case. And even in the
mutual fund world, dollar-hedged international stock funds are hard to find.
(The Tweedy, Browne International Value Fund was a good option, but the
fund is now closed to new investors.)
Because your foreign ETFs are denominated in either Euros, Yen, or Pounds,
they tend to be more volatile than the markets they represent. In other words,
if European stock markets fall and the dollar rises (vis a vis the Euro) on the
same day, your European ETF will fall doubly hard. If, however, the dollar 
falls on a day that the sun is shining on European stocks, your European 
ETF will soar.
136
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

Over the long-run, individual currencies tend to go up and down. It is unlikely
that the dollar (or Euro) would permanently rise or fall to such a degree that
it would seriously affect your nest egg. In the short-term, however, such cur-
rency fluctuations can be a bit nauseating. (See more on currency in the side-
bar “A pure [and purely silly] currency play.”)
Second, another risk with going whole hog for foreign stock ETFs is that to a
certain extent, your fortunes are tied to those of your home economy. Stocks
tend to do best in a heated economy. But in a heated economy, we also tend
to see inflation. Because of that correlation between general price inflation
and stock inflation, stock investors are generally able to stay ahead of the
inflation game. If you were to invest all your money in Europe, and should the
economy here take off while the economy there sits on the launch pad, you
could potentially be rocketed into poverty.
Third, in the world of ETFs, the really, really good buys are to be had on the
domestic side of the offerings. For whatever reason, global and international
ETFs are about twice the price as broadly diversified U.S. ETFs. For example,
while most Vanguard domestic ETFs carry management expenses of 0.11 or
0.12 percent, their foreign counterparts run anywhere between 0.18 and 0.30
percent. The iShares international ETFs run about 0.60 percent versus many
of the domestic offerings that run 0.30 percent or less.
Fourth, part of the reason that international stocks now account for about
two-thirds of the world stock market may simply be because they are over-
heated. The timing to delve deeply abroad could be all wrong. As you see in
the hills and valleys of Figure 10-1, periods in which foreign stocks beat the

Shares ETF (FXE). You may turn out to be right,
in which case, you’ll make money. But I wouldn’t
call that successful investing. You made a lucky
bet, not an investment. Currencies can move
like a trash-can top in a hurricane, and you
never know what direction they’ll follow. This
ETF (and about a dozen other currency ETFs
recently to appear on the market) may indeed
serve a purpose in the world of commerce
(such as manufacturers hedging against 
currency losses), but for the average investor’s
portfolio, FXE deserves no allocation. If 
you follow my advice and invest in international
stocks (and perhaps bonds, too, as I discuss in
Chapter 12), you will get plenty of exposure to
Euros (and Yen and Pounds) already — perhaps
too much. You don’t need any more.

pants off U.S. stocks are regularly followed by periods in which those 
foreign-made pants fall to the ground. We may be on the verge of a big U.S.
comeback.
Fifth, and finally, certain kinds of stock funds in the United States offer even
lower correlation to the rest of the U.S. market than do international stock
funds, and I suggest leaving room in your portfolio for some of those funds.
I’m talking principally about so-called market-neutral funds, which I discuss 
in Chapter 15.
Why putting one-fifth of your portfolio 
in foreign stocks is insufficient
Scads of research indicates that an 80-percent-or-so domestic stock/20-
percent-or-so foreign stock portfolio is optimal for maximizing return and
minimizing risk. But almost all that research defines domestic stock as the
S&P 500 and foreign stock as the MSCI EAFE. The MSCI EAFE is an index of
mostly large companies in the developed world. This analysis takes little
account of the fact that you are not limiting yourself to the S&P 500 or to 
the MSCI EAFE. You have the option of adding many asset classes to your
portfolio of U.S. stocks. And among your international holdings, you can 
have developed-world stocks in Europe, Australia, and Japan; emerging
market nation stocks; and large foreign stocks and small foreign stocks,
maybe broken out into growth and value stocks.
Many investment pros know well — and several have even told me — that
they favor a much larger international position than they publicly advocate.
Some may be afraid of seeming unpatriotic. Much more prevalent is a lemming-
over-the-cliff-cover-my-ass mentality. If I, as your financial advisor, suggest a
portfolio that resembles the S&P 500, and your portfolio tanks, you’ll feel a
bit peeved but you won’t hate me. That’s because all your friends’ and neigh-
bors’ portfolios will have sunk as well. Should I give you a portfolio that’s 50
percent foreign, and should foreign stocks have a bad year, you’ll compare
your portfolio to your friends’ and neighbors’ portfolios, and you’ll hate me.
You may even sue me.
I wouldn’t want that. Neither would most investment professionals. So most
err on the side of caution and give you a portfolio that’s more S&P 500 and
less foreign — for their own protection, not your best interest.

Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

Why ETFs are a great tool 
for international investing
By mixing and matching domestic and international — with 40 to 50 percent
foreign — you will find your investment sweet spot. In Chapter 16, I pull
together sample portfolios that use this methodology, using mostly ETFs and
a few mutual funds. Time and time again, I’ve run the numbers through the
most sophisticated (and perhaps most expensive) professional portfolio
analysis software available, and time and time again, the 40 to 50 percent for-
eign is where I find the highest returns with minimal risk. Oh yes, this range
has worked very well in the real world, too.
Although I try not to make forecasts because the markets are so incredibly
unpredictable, I will say that if you were to err on either side of the U.S./
foreign division question, I would err on the side of too much foreign. Even
though foreign stocks have lately been hot, hot, hot, the world economic 
and political climate is telling me that the U.S. stock market is on relatively
shakier ground. I could give you a long list of reasons (war in Iraq, raging fed-
eral deficit, trade deficit, aging population, healthcare crisis), but foremost,
what really scares me about the United States is the extent to which it is
becoming a nation of haves and have-nots. If history tells us anything, it is
that great inequality leads to great dissension and upheaval.
Me, personally, I have fully half of my own stock portfolio in foreign stocks —
the vast majority of it held in ETFs.
Not All Foreign Nations 
are Created Equal
At present, you have more than 60 global and international ETFs from which
to choose. (Global ETFs may hold U.S. as well as international stocks; interna-
tional ETFs are purely non-U.S.) I’d like you to consider the following half-
dozen factors when deciding which ones to invest in:
 What’s the correlation? Certain economies are more closely linked to
the U.S. economy, and therefore the stock markets of those countries
tend to be more closely linked to Wall Street. Canada, for example, offers
limited diversification. Western Europe offers a bit more. For the least
amount of correlation, you want Japan (the world’s second-largest 
139
Chapter 10: Going International: ETFs Without Borders

stock market, by far) or emerging market nations like Russia, Brazil,
India, and China.
 How large is the home market? Although you can invest in individual
countries, I wouldn’t recommend it. You can’t slice and dice your portfo-
lio to include all 35 or so ETFs that represent individual countries (from
Belgium to Austria and Singapore to Spain), so why try? Choose large
regions in which to invest. (The only exception is Japan, which has such
a large stock market that it qualifies, in my mind, as a region.)
 Think style. If you have a large enough portfolio, consider dividing your
international holdings into value and growth, large and small, just as you
do with your domestic holdings. Barclays iShares make the value/growth
part possible by offering value and growth international options. The
large and small part may have to be done outside the ETF universe
(using mutual funds) until more small cap international ETFs hit the
streets.
 Consider your risk tolerance. Developed countries (United Kingdom,
France, Japan) tend to have less volatile stock markets than do emerging
market nations (such as those of Latin America or the Middle East).
 What’s the bounce factor? As with any other kind of investment, you
can pretty safely assume that risk and return will have a close relation-
ship over the years. Emerging market ETFs will likely be more volatile
but, over the long-run, more rewarding than ETFs that track the stock
markets of developed nations. One caveat: Don’t assume that countries
with fast-growing economies are necessarily those that make for the
most profitable investments; see the sidebar “A boom economy doesn’t
necessarily mean a robust stock market.”
 Look to P/E ratios. How expensive is the stock compared to the earn-
ings you’re buying? You may ask yourself this question when buying a
company stock, and it’s just as valid a question when buying a nation’s
stocks. In general, a lower P/E ratio is more indicative of promising
returns than is a high P/E ratio.
Using ETFs as our proxies for world markets, we find that the Vanguard
Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) currently has a P/E of about 18; the
Vanguard European ETF (VGK) has a P/E of about 16; the Vanguard
Pacific ETF (VPL) has a P/E of approximately 20; and the Vanguard
Emerging Market ETF (VWO) has a P/E of roughly 13.5. The Emerging
Market ETF is therefore the “value stock” of the world, with European
stocks second on the value list.

Choosing the Best International 
ETFs for Your Portfolio
Although I’m (obviously) a huge fan of international investing, and I believe
that ETFs are the best way to achieve that end, there are only a dozen or so
foreign ETFs that I think really fit the bill for most portfolios. Following are
my favorites, along with explanations of why I like them.
Note that I’ve split them up into three major regions: European, Pacific
region, and emerging markets. For most people’s portfolios, a reasonable
split of your foreign stock holdings would be something in the ballpark 
of 40/40/20, with 40 percent going to Europe (England, France, Germany,
Switzerland), 40 percent to the developed Pacific region (mostly Japan, with 
a smattering of Australia and Singapore), and 20 percent to the emerging
market nations (Brazil, Russia, Turkey, South Africa, Mexico).
141
Chapter 10: Going International: ETFs Without Borders
A boom economy doesn’t necessarily 
mean a robust stock market
You would think that a fast-growing economy
would be the place of places to invest. And yet
there is more to stock returns than the growth
of a national economy. (Just ask those investors
who poured money into China several years
ago.) In fact, the mind-blowing conclusion of a
handful of recent studies is that the reverse is
true: If you look at the stock returns of various
national markets over the past 100 years, you
actually find an inverse relationship. Slow-
growing economies (such as India’s, whose
stock market has lately left China’s in the dust)
generally make for better stock investments!
Several possible explanations exist. Some
people say that rapid economic growth is attrib-
utable more to small, entrepreneurial busi-
nesses rather than to larger, publicly held
corporations. Another explanation is that the
fruits of economic growth may or may not go to
shareholders — and often don’t. Those fruits
may also go to labor, or consumers, or (the
United States is a prime example) top execu-
tives and option-holders. Another possible
explanation is that the prices of stocks in fast-
growing economies (just like domestic growth
stocks) often start off overpriced due to higher-
than-reasonable expectations. Stocks of slow-
growing economies (just like value stocks) may
tend to be underpriced.
The moral of the story is to spread your invest-
ment dollars around the world. Don’t think you
can pick countries that will outperform by using
projected growth rates as your crystal ball.

Three brands to choose from
All the ETFs I discuss here belong to three ETF families: Vanguard ETFs;
Barclays iShares; and BLDRS (pronounced “builders”), a small product line
issued by NASDAQ and the Bank of New York.
BLDRS stands for “Baskets of Listed Depositary Receipts,” which is a very
fancy way of saying “foreign stocks that trade on American stock exchanges.”
Vanguard and Barclays iShares foreign ETFs are also made up mostly of
Depositary Receipts (often referred to as ADRs — the A is for “American”)
but may hold other foreign stocks as well. For you, the investor, these
nuances don’t matter much, if at all.
For more information on any of the international ETFs I discuss below, keep
the following contact information handy:

A special word on BLDRS
The BLDRS indexes, restricted to American
Depository Receipts that trade on the NASDAQ,
have attracted some criticism for their appar-
ent randomness. In a way, the criticisms are
right. Building a European ETF out of only ADRs
that trade on the NASDAQ is a little like putting
together a football team of men whose first
names start with “R.” But my feeling is that all
indexes are somewhat random. Some are
weighted according to cap size; others are
equally weighted; yet others are weighted by
number of shares outstanding. In point of fact,
a team of football players named Robert, Rick,
and Raul are not necessarily going to be any
better or worse than a team with Clay, Dave,
and Sam. And so it is with BLDRS: Their perfor-
mance has been pretty much on a par with the
other ETF options of the same regions.

the United States and Japan, European stocks, as a whole, are seemingly low-
priced (low P/E ratio). Europe’s strengths include political stability, an edu-
cated workforce, and the recent confederation of national economies making
for the world’s largest single market. Europe’s great weakness is a seemingly
stagnant high rate of unemployment with a very rapidly aging population.
Vanguard European ETF (VGK)
Indexed to: Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Europe Index, which
tracks approximately 600 large cap companies in 18 European nations
Expense ratio: 0.18 percent
Top five country holdings: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland,
Italy
Russell’s review: This ETF has everything going for it: low cost, good diversi-
fication, and tax efficiency. You can’t go wrong (unless the European stock
market falters, which, of course, could happen). The mix of both many
nations and currencies (Euro, British Pound, Swiss Franc, Swedish Krona)
gives this fund an especially good balance and an especially good way to help
protect your portfolio from any single-country (or currency) collapse.
BLDRS Europe 100 ADR (ADRU)
Indexed to: The Bank of New York Europe 100 ADR Index, a market-weighted
basket of 100 European market-based ADRs trading on the NASDAQ, repre-
senting a total of 15 countries
Expense ratio: 0.30 percent
Top five country holdings: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland,
Netherlands
Russell’s review: Not as diverse as the Vanguard European ETF, but with 
100 stocks, plenty diverse enough. The yearly expense ratio is about midway
between the Vanguard European offering and the iShares Europe offering. All
told, the BLDRS Europe is a good choice, although it may not be the best
(that would be Vanguard). By the way, don’t assume that because this ETF
contains only NASDAQ listings it is in any way a technology-laden fund. Far
from it. Industry-wise, the top three components of this ETF are oil and gas
companies, banks, and pharmaceutical firms.
143
Chapter 10: Going International: ETFs Without Borders

iShares S&P Europe 350 (IEV)
Indexed to: Standard & Poor’s Europe 350 Index, a collection of 350 large cap
companies in 16 European countries
Expense ratio: 0.60 percent
Top five country holdings: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland,
Spain
Russell’s review: I really like iShares domestic offerings, and their foreign
ETFs aren’t bad products. Not at all. The diversification is excellent. The
indexes make sense. The tax efficiency is top notch. I only wish the darned
things didn’t cost so much. At roughly 3.3 times the cost of the Vanguard
European offering, IEV just isn’t, I’m afraid, anything to write home about.
Pacific region stock ETFs: From Mt. Fuji

Make wheat, not war
In the stock market Olympics of the past century
(1900–2000), the overall winner in terms of real
stock market return (return after inflation — 
the kind of return that really counts) was . . .
drumroll . . . the socialist, Volvo-producing, snow-
covered nation of Sweden. Sweden’s overall rate
of return from beginning to end of century was
7.6 percent. In second place was Australia with
7.5 percent. In third place was South Africa with
6.8 percent. The United States came in fourth
with 6.7 percent, and Canada was fifth with 6.4
percent. At the bottom of the world barrel, the
Belgian equity market returned only 2.5 percent,
with Italy, Germany, Spain, and France dragging
closely behind with respective 100-year annual-
ized post-inflation returns of 2.7, 3.6, 3.6, and 3.8
percent.
Here’s the conclusion of the authors who pulled
these numbers together, a group of distin-
guished professors from the London Business
School: “Generally speaking, the worst per-
forming equity markets were associated with
countries which either lost major wars, or were
most ravaged by international or civil wars.”
The best performers, point out professors
Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton, were “resource
rich countries.”

largest consumer, surrounding nations may bask in economic glory. On the
other hand, the threat of North Korea, the danger of avian flu, and the tension
between China and Taiwan loom like black clouds over the region.
Vanguard Pacific ETF (VPL)
Indexed to: Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Pacific Index, which
follows roughly 550 companies in five Pacific region nations
Expense ratio: 0.18 percent
Top five country holdings: Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, New
Zealand
Russell’s review: The cost can’t be beat. And 550 companies certainly allows
for good diversification. As with all Vanguard funds, tax efficiency is tops.
Japan — the world’s second-largest stock market — makes up 77 percent of
this fund, a bit more than the BLDRS Asia 50. I have a slight preference for
VPL over all other Pacific options.
BLDRS Asia 50 ADR (ADRA)
Indexed to: The Bank of New York Asia 50 ADR Index, a market-weighted
basket of 50 Asian market-based ADRs trading on the NASDAQ, representing 
a total of 8 countries (although Japan accounts for nearly two-thirds of the
money pot)
Expense ratio: 0.30 percent
Top five country holdings: Japan, Australia, Korea, Taiwan, China
Russell’s review: The cost is higher than Vanguard’s Pacific ETF, and you’re
tapping into fewer companies. Nonetheless, 50 companies isn’t bad diversifi-
cation. This fund also gives a bit more weight to non-Japan stock markets,
which may be a good thing. All in all, ADRA is a good investment, although if
you bent my arm to choose, I’d probably choose Vanguard.
iShares MSCI Japan (EWJ)
Indexed to: MSCI Japan Index, representing approximately 280 of Japan’s
largest companies
Expense ratio: 0.59 percent
Top five country holdings: Just Japan here
145
Chapter 10: Going International: ETFs Without Borders

Russell’s review: For the life of me, I can’t understand why Barclays doesn’t
offer a Pacific region ETF. If you want the equivalent of either the BLDRS or
Vanguard Pacific ETFs, you need to buy two iShares ETFs: the MSCI Japan and
the MSCI Pacific ex-Japan (EPP). That’s a doable option for larger portfolios,
but with a cost ratio of several times that of Vanguard’s, I’m not sure I see 
the point.
Emerging market stock ETFs: Well, 
we hope that they’re emerging
When economists feel optimistic, they call them “emerging market” nations.
But these same countries are also sometimes referred to as the Third World,
or, even more to the point, “poor countries.” The recent astonishing returns
of emerging market stocks are due largely to sharp increases in the price of
commodities, such as oil, which come largely from these nations. But com-
modity prices fluctuate greatly. And political unrest, corruption, and over-
population, as well as serious environmental challenges, plague much of this
part of the world.
On the other hand, emerging market stocks are perhaps still (despite their
recent rise) underpriced. Many of the economies (such as China’s) are grow-
ing rapidly. And — perhaps most importantly — these countries have many
children, children who will grow up to be workers, consumers, and perhaps
even investors.
Vanguard Emerging Market ETF (VWO)
Indexed to: The Select Emerging Markets Index, a custom index of roughly
750 large cap companies in 18 emerging market nations
Expense ratio: 0.30 percent
Top five country holdings: Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, South Africa, China
Russell’s review: There’s no better way that I know to capture the potential
growth of emerging market stocks than through VWO. The cost is the lowest
in the pack (equal to the BLDRS option), and the diversity of investments is
more than adequate.
146
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

BLDRS Emerging Markets 50 ADR (ADRE)
Indexed to: The Bank of New York Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index, a market-
weighted basket of 50 emerging market-based ADRs trading on the NASDAQ,
representing a total of 11 countries
Expense ratio: 0.30 percent
Top five country holdings: Brazil, Korea, Mexico, China, Taiwan
Russell’s review: Yeah, 50 companies falls way short of Vanguard’s 750, but
50 companies is really enough to give you pretty good diversification. I have
no problem whatsoever recommending this ETF as a way to tap into the
emerging markets, although I do have a wee preference, once again, for
Vanguard.
iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM)
Indexed to: MSCI Emerging Markets Index, a basket of approximately 270
large companies in 20 emerging-market nations
Expense ratio: 0.75 percent
Top five country holdings: South Korea, South Africa, Brazil, Taiwan, China
Russell’s review: Good fund. Good company. Good index. If it weren’t more
than twice the price of the other options in this area, I’d jump to recommend it.
iShares value and growth: Two special
ETFs for style investing abroad
Studies show that the same value premium — the tendency for value stocks
to outperform growth stocks — that seemingly exists here in the United
States exists around the world. (See the full value premium discussion in
Chapters 6 and 8.) Therefore, I suggest a mild tilt toward value in your inter-
national stock portfolio, as well as in your domestic.
You can accomplish this tilt easily by allotting a small percentage of your
international holdings to the iShares MSCI EAFE Value Index (EFV). For
smaller portfolios with limited room to slice and dice, an investor may want
to invest part of her holdings in EFV and part in the iShares MSCI EAFE
Growth Index (EFG). The division into regions can come as the portfolio
147
Chapter 10: Going International: ETFs Without Borders

grows. EAFE, by the way, stands for “Europe, Australia, and Far East” — in
other words, the developed nations outside of the United States and Canada.
iShares MSCI EAFE Value Index (EFV)
Indexed to: MSCI EAFE Value Index, which is made up of approximately 535
large value companies in 21 developed-world nations, with about half the
companies in either Japan or the United Kingdom
Expense ratio: 0.40 percent
Top five country holdings: Japan, United Kingdom, France, Switzerland,
Germany
Russell’s review: It’s the only fund of its kind, and I’m greatly appreciative
that it exists. My only beef is that at present, about 42 percent of the compa-
nies are concentrated in one industry: financials.
iShares MSCI EAFE Growth Index (EFG)
Indexed to: MSCI EAFE Growth Index, which is made up of approximately 550
large value companies in 22 developed-world nations, with about half the
companies in either Japan or the United Kingdom
Expense ratio: 0.40 percent
Top five country holdings: Japan, United Kingdom, France, Switzerland,
Germany

A word on foreign taxes
If you are buying both a foreign and a domestic
ETF, and you have room enough for only one in
your IRA, Roth IRA, or other tax-advantaged
retirement plan, choose the domestic fund and
plug the foreign fund into your non-retirement
account. That’s because many foreign countries
will slap you with a withholding tax on your div-
idends. Typically, such a tax may be 15 percent.
(If you invest, say, $30,000 in a foreign fund with
a dividend yield of 3 percent, you’ll be losing
$135 a year to foreign taxes.) If the foreign ETF
is in a non-retirement account, your brokerage
house will likely supply you with a year-end
statement noting the foreign tax paid. You can
then write that amount off in full against your
U.S. taxes. (See line 43 of your friendly 1040.) If
the foreign fund is held in your retirement
account, however, no year-end statement, no
write-off. You eat the loss.

Russell’s review: Like EFV, this international growth fund is the only one of
its kind. I’m grateful for its existence, and I’m grateful that Barclays hasn’t
taken advantage of its monopoly and has kept the expense ratio reasonable.
Small cap international: Yes, you want it
Small cap international stocks have even less correlation to the U.S. stock
market than do larger foreign stocks. The reason is simple: If the U.S. econ-
omy takes a swan dive, it will seriously hurt conglomerates — Nestle, Toyota,
and British Petroleum, for example — that serve the U.S. market, regardless
of where their corporate headquarters are located. A fall in the U.S. economy
and U.S. stock market is less likely to affect smaller foreign corporations that
sell mostly within national borders.
In the absence of a small international ETF until recently, I have been using
small and mid cap international mutual funds from Fidelity, T. Rowe Price,
Vanguard, Third Avenue, and Tweedy Browne. I discuss some of these funds
further in Chapter 15 where I talk about the role of non-ETFs in your invest-
ment mix, and again in Chapter 16 where I present model portfolios. Given
the recent popularity of these funds, a good number are closed to new
investors. Take heart: I’m sure we’ll see the introduction of a good number 
of small cap international ETFs before long.
For the time being, the only ETF offering that qualifies as small cap interna-
tional is from WisdomTree. The WisdomTree International SmallCap Dividend
Fund (DLS) is certainly a viable candidate to fill this slot in a portfolio.
Because it’s brand new, carries a fairly high expense ratio for an ETF (0.58
percent), and emphasizes dividends, I’m less than crazy about this fund. But
for now, it may be one of the best options.
Regardless of the investment vehicle you choose, I suggest that a good chunk
of your international stock holdings — perhaps as much as 50 percent, if you
can stomach a lot of volatility — go to small and mid cap holdings. Future
editions of this book will review and discuss whatever small cap international
stock ETFs exist at that point.

n this chapter, I introduce a few stock ETFs that don’t fit into any of the
categories I discuss in previous chapters. They are neither growth nor
value, large nor small. They are not industry sector funds, nor are they inter-
national. If ETFs were ice cream, the funds presented here would not repre-
sent chocolate and vanilla, but rather, the outliers on the Baskin Robbins’
menu: Turtle Cheesecake, Tiramisu, No Sugar Added Chocolate Chip, Pink
Bubblegum, and Wild ’N Reckless (a swirl of green apple, blue raspberry, and
fruit punch sherbets).
Wild ’N Reckless? I wouldn’t say any of these funds are necessarily wild or
reckless, but nonetheless, they are stock funds, and anything related to
stocks — trust me on this — carries risk. That being said, I present you with
two ETFs that bill themselves as socially responsible, a slew of funds that
focus on companies paying high dividends (they’re especially hot at the
moment), one that invests only in corporations that have relatively recently
begun selling shares to the public, and a few funds that go up when every-
thing else is going down (don’t get too excited; it isn’t as good as it sounds). I
also describe one hypothetical specialized stock ETF (see the sidebar “The
author’s pipedream”) that I wish someone would introduce.

Socially Responsible Investing 
for a Better World
An increasing number of people — both individuals and institutions — are
investing using some kind of moral compass. The investments chosen are
screened not only for potential profitability but for social factors as well.
Some screens, for example, attempt to eliminate all companies that profit
from tobacco or weapons of mass destruction. Other screens try to block out
the worst polluting companies or companies that use child labor in countries
that have no effective child labor laws.
The total amount of money invested in socially screened portfolios (which
include more than 100 mutual funds, certain state and city pension funds,
union and church monies, some university endowments, and — count ’em —
two ETFs) has grown from about $1 trillion in 1997 to over $2 trillion today.
Many of the funds that call themselves socially responsible not only invest,
but they also use their financial muscle to lobby companies to become better
world citizens. The movement seems to have had some impact on corporate
America, most notably by pushing certain auto, oil, and utility companies to
research ways to reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses. Other, smaller vic-
tories include a nearly nationwide ban on mercury thermometers and a
recent commitment from a major tech company to start a recycling program.
Investments to help you sleep well at night
Whereas investing in a socially responsible mutual fund or ETF may do the
world some good, the question remains whether it will do your portfolio any
good. Proponents believe that nice companies, like nice salespeople, will nat-
urally be more successful over time. Skeptics of investing with a social screen
not only scoff at the notion of good karma; they say that limiting a fund man-
ager’s investment choices could lead to lower performance.
So far, no solid evidence exists that either side is right — or wrong. Over the
past decade or so, the performance of socially responsible mutual funds has
been, as a group, very similar to that of all other mutual funds.
What about the specific performance of the two ETFs I list here? Well, neither
has been around long enough for its performance record to count for much.
And, of course, performance is only one factor I look at when deciding
whether to recommend an ETF.
152

Your two ETF choices
The two ETFs to use social screens introduced on the market thus far are as
different as night and day. The iShares Select Social Index Fund (KLD) is a
broad-based large cap blend (both value and growth) fund. The PowerShares
WilderHill Clean Energy Fund (PBW) is a narrow industry sector fund and a
style fund (overwhelmingly small growth) and — whew — something of a
global fund as well. (Approximately 16 percent of the holdings are non-U.S.)
Unlike my reviews of other kinds of ETFs (found in Chapters 5 through 10), I
review these two together. That way, I avoid repeating myself, for my feelings
about both are the same: I’m absolutely, positively, conclusively ambivalent.
My double-shot review follows a brief synopsis of the two funds.
The iShares Select Social Index Fund (KLD)
Based on the KLD Select Social Index, the fund starts with the 300 or so
largest U.S. corporations. Based on each company’s record for social justice
and environmental performance, it overweights purportedly ethical compa-
nies and underweights supposedly unethical ones while making sure that all
industries other than tobacco are represented. (Tobacco is totally snuffed.)
The resulting ETF looks like this:
Expense ratio: 0.50 percent
Top five companies: Wells Fargo, Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, General
Mills, American Express
Top five industries: Financials, technology, healthcare, consumer goods,
industrials
The PowerShares WilderHill Clean Energy Fund (PBW)
Based on WilderHill Clean Energy Index, the fund tracks three dozen compa-
nies that invest in solar energy, windmills, hydrogen fuel cells, rechargeable
batteries, and other forms of environment-friendly power.
The resulting ETF looks like this:
Expense ratio: 0.60 percent 
Top five companies (which you’ve probably never heard of): Active Power,
IMPCO Technologies, Ultralife Batteries, Mechanical Technology, Distributed
Energy Systems

Chapter 11: Specialized Stock ETFs

Top five countries: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Japan, China
Russell’s double-shot review: If you decide that you want to be a socially
responsible investor, you have many choices: There are now 110 mutual
funds that invest with some social screen. Some, like the iShares Select Social
Index Fund, cover a large swatch of the market. Others, like the PowerShares
WilderHill Clean Energy Fund, are more narrowly focused. The two ETFs,
although fairly pricey by ETF standards, cost less than half of what the aver-
age socially conscious mutual fund would cost. And that is certainly a good
thing. On the other hand, neither Barclays nor PowerShares promises the
same kind of shareholder activism that you get with some of the more aggres-
sive mutual fund companies. And that may lessen these ETFs’ desirability in
your eyes. The iShares Select fund is also quite liberal in its definition of
“socially responsible” and makes many compromises in its selection of
stocks. Certain socially conscious mutual funds have much tougher 
screening criteria.
From a strictly economic/diversification point of view, I like to see large cap
stocks split distinctly into value and growth. With the iShares Select Social
Index Fund, you get a mushier exposure to large caps. The PowerShares
option, again from a strictly economic/diversification point of view, offers up
a small sliver of the economy and, as such, involves considerable risk. On the
other hand, all energy stocks — both clean and dirty — have lately shown a
delightful lack of correlation to the market as a whole. I would caution you,
should you want to sink any money into energy right now, that the sector has
been one of the hottest, and what goes up sharply in the world of invest-
ments often comes down just as sharply. Be careful!
For more information on socially 
responsible investing
If you want to invest for a better world and a better portfolio, I suggest you
do additional research. One person’s idea of socially responsible may be 
very different than another’s. What works for one portfolio may not work for
another. There’s a ton of information on the Web site of the Social Investment
Forum: www.socialinvest.org.

Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

Dividend Funds: The Search 
for Steady Money
The check is in the mail. When you know it’s true (it isn’t always), there are
perhaps no sweeter words in the English language. To many investors, the
thought of regular payments is a definite turn-on. And so, willing to oblige,
the financial industry of late has been churning out “high dividend” funds —
both mutual funds and ETFs — like there’s no tomorrow.
The idea behind these funds is simple enough: They attempt to cull together
the stocks of companies that are either issuing high dividends, have high div-
idend growth rates, or hold forth the promise of future high dividends.
Your ETF options
On the ETF side, the oldest and largest of the dividend funds is the iShares
Dow Jones Select Dividend Index Fund (DVY). But you can also go with the
SPDR Dividend (SDY), the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG), the
First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (FDL), or any of a 
bevy of PowerShares selections. The PowerShares dividend ETFs include 
the PowerShares Dividend Achievers Portfolio (PFM), the PowerShares High
Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio (PEY), and the PowerShares High
Growth Rate Dividend Achievers Portfolio (PHJ).
Why three PowerShares domestic dividend ETFs? The first one (PFM) “seeks
to identify a diversified group of dividend paying companies.” The second
one (PEY) “seeks to deliver high current dividend income and capital appre-
ciation.” And the third (PHJ) “seeks to identify companies with the highest
ten-year annual dividend growth rate.”
If that weren’t a big enough choice, you could also go with the PowerShares
International Dividend Achievers Portfolio (PID), which “seeks international
companies that have increased their annual dividend for five or more consec-
utive fiscal years.” And if that weren’t enough choice, the newest kid on the
ETF block, WisdomTree, offers 20 other high dividend funds . . . with every
wrinkle imaginable.
In a way, seeking dividends makes sense. In another, larger way, the logic is
loopy. Let me explain . . .
155
Chapter 11: Specialized Stock ETFs

Promise of riches or smoke and mirrors?
Dividends! Dividends! On the face of it, they look like free money. But nothing
in life is quite so simple. Here are the typical arguments for buying a high div-
idend fund, along with my retort to each:
 Argument for dividends #1: Steady money is just like honey. Huh? Are
you crazy, Russell? Who in his right mind wouldn’t want dividends? Why
even ask? A stock that pays dividends is obviously more valuable than a
stock that doesn’t pay dividends. If I buy a high dividend ETF, every
month, my account balance will grow.
Retort: Suppose you own an individual share of stock in the McDummy
Corporation (ticker MCDM), and MCDM issues a dividend of $1. The
market price of your one share of MCDM, as a rule, will fall by $1 as soon
as the McDummy Corporation sends out the dividend. That’s because
the dividend comes from the McDummy’s cash reserves, and as those
cash reserves diminish, the value of the McDummy Corporation dimin-
ishes (just as it would if it gave away, say, 100 plastic pink flamingoes
from the front lawn of its corporate headquarters, or any other asset for
that matter). As the value of the company diminishes, so too does the
value of its shares. And the very same holds true for a basket of stocks
held in an ETF.
 Argument for dividends #2: They lower my tax hit. But . . . but . . .
Suppose I need a steady stream of income? Isn’t it better that I rely on
dividends, which are generally taxed at 15 percent, than rely on bond or
CD interest, which is taxed at my higher income-tax rate?
First retort: First, if you need a steady stream of income, nothing is stop-
ping you from creating artificial dividends by selling off any security you
like. You may pay capital gains tax, but that will be no higher than the
tax on dividends. In the end, whether you pull $1,000 from your account
in the form of recently issued dividends, or whether you pull $1,000 from
the sale of security, you are withdrawing the same amount. And what if
one month you find you don’t need the income? With a high dividend
ETF, you need to pay the tax regardless, but with a non high dividend
yielding ETF, you may pay no tax whatsoever. Of course, with an ETF,
you pay a commission to buy and sell, so if you’re regularly dipping 
in for small amounts of money, you may not even want an ETF in the 
first place.
Second retort: The special dividend tax break is set to expire at the end
of 2008. Then dividends will be taxed at ordinary income rates unless
Congress extends the break.
156
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

Third retort: If you’re really concerned about taxes, maybe you should
be investing in tax-free municipal bonds.
 Argument for dividends #3: Taxes, what taxes? Russell, what gives? If I
invest in an ETF, I won’t have to worry about taxes because, as you’ve
told us all along, ETFs are incredibly tax efficient.
Retort: ETFs are heads and shoulders above most mutual funds when it
comes to tax efficiency, but that tax efficiency is aimed at reducing capi-
tal gains, not tax on dividends. An ETF can’t do a whole lot to lessen the
tax hit from dividends. ETF or mutual fund, you’ll pay.
 Argument for dividends #4: It’s a new world! Russell, you sound like a
stick in the mud. This is an exciting new development in the world of
investments. These high dividend paying funds will kick ass, you’ll see.
Retort: New development? Really? Equity-income funds have been
around for years and years, and they haven’t exactly set the world on
fire. And consider the ages-old Dogs of the Dow strategy. Many people
have believed that if every year you purchase the ten highest-paying div-
idend stocks in the Dow (the so-called Dogs), you can rack up serious
returns. The strategy has been well-studied, and it clearly isn’t as power-
ful as the hype. The Dogs do seem to have some bark, but no more so
than any other similarly sized and similarly volatile stocks.
 Argument for dividends #5: Don’t you read history? Over the course of
history, Russell, much of the stock market’s returns have come from div-
idends. You should know that.
First retort: Yeah, so? During the longest bull market in history — the
1990s — stock market returns were running double digits a year, and
very little was being shelled out in dividends. A company that isn’t
paying dividends is either investing its cash in operations or buying
back its own stock. Either way, shareholders stand to gain.
Second retort: If you look at high dividend paying sectors of the 
economy — utilities is a perfect example — you don’t necessarily 
find that those sectors beat the broader market over long periods 
of time. The utilities sector certainly hasn’t.
 Argument for dividends #6: Dividends offer protection. Stocks that
pay high dividends are going to be less risky than stocks that don’t.
Those dividends create a floor, at least a psychological floor. High 
dividend paying stocks cannot become worthless.
Retort: You would think that high dividend paying stock ETFs would
likely fall less precipitously should there be a major downturn in the
stock market. On the face of it, your argument seems logical. In the real
world, however, studies of high dividend paying stocks reveal that they
actually tend to be somewhat more volatile than the broad market. Go
157
Chapter 11: Specialized Stock ETFs

figure. Besides, if your main goal is to temper risk, you have other, prob-
ably more effective, ways of doing that. (See Chapter 12 on bonds.)
 Argument for dividends #7: But still, it can’t hurt. All right, I concede,
maybe these funds aren’t the greatest thing since white bread. Still, can
it hurt to buy one? 
 Retort: Look, I don’t hate these funds. Far from it. If you want to buy one,
buy one. Put it into your retirement account, if there’s room in there, and
you won’t even have to worry about any tax on dividends. But don’t
assume that you’re going to beat the broad market over the long-haul.
And know that you are buying a fund that is mostly large value stocks,
typically within just a handful of industries (notably financial services,
pharmaceuticals, and utilities). Your risk may be greater than you think.
 Final argument: I want my dividends! I don’t care what you say. I’m
going to buy a high dividend ETF.
 Final retort: Fine. Consider the Vanguard option (VIG) or the SPDR
(SDY). At 0.28 percent and 0.30 percent, they are considerably less
expensive than the competition. The iShares option (DVY) isn’t too bad,
either, with expenses of 0.40 percent.
I’d steer clear of the PowerShares options. The expense ratios — 0.50
percent — are problematic enough. And quite frankly, having to choose
between “high dividend paying companies,” “high current dividend
income and capital appreciation,” and “companies with the highest 
ten-year annual dividend growth rate” is enough to give me a big, fat
headache. WisdomTree’s many, many dividend offerings, which tend 
to be even more pricey than PowerShares, make my head explode.
By the way, don’t forget Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs); several
ETF REIT options exists, which tend to pay twice the amount of divi-
dends as any of the high dividend ETFs. (Plenty more on REITs in
Chapter 13.)
Last but not least, if you’re not going to be using that dividend money right
away, make sure you have your ETF with a brokerage house that will reinvest
your dividends without charging you a commission. The vast majority will do
so, but not all.
A Fund for Initial Public Offerings: Google
It, and You’ll Discover FPX
Want to take a real joyride? In April 2006, First Trust Advisors introduced the
First Trust IPOX-100 Index Fund (FPX). You can now invest in an ETF that,
158
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

according to the prospectus, tracks the 100 “largest, typically best perform-
ing, and most liquid initial public offerings [“IPOs”] in the . . . U.S.” Just prior
to the introduction of the fund, the index on which it is based clocked a
three-year annualized return of 33.74 percent. Needless to say, with that kind
of return, this new ETF got the attention of a good number of investors. But I
wonder what’s in store for them in the future.
A brief recent history of IPOs
Yes, when times are good for small and mid cap stocks, as they were in the
three years prior to the launch of FPX, times are typically very good for IPOs.
But when times are bad . . . The index suffered terribly during the bear
market of 2000, 2001, and 2002, with annual returns, respectively, of –24.55
percent, –22.77 percent, and –21.64 percent. (If you started with $10,000, you
would have been left with a rather pathetic $4,566.04.)
A brief longer-term history of IPOs
But what about the long-term performance of IPOs? Jay Ritter, a professor of
Finance at the University of Florida, keeps studious records on the returns of
IPOs, and he asserts that collectively, they haven’t done all that well vis a vis
the larger market. But he hastens to add that the long-term performance is
dragged down by the smaller IPOs, and that larger IPOs — the ones included
in the IPOX ETF — as a group have modestly outperformed the market, albeit
with greater volatility.
Indeed. As the IPOX Index now stands, tech stocks make up 25 percent of the
roster, and the two top companies — Google and Viacom — together make
up 20 percent of the index. Do you really want that kind of volatility in your
portfolio, on top of an expense ratio of 0.60 percent?
You may, yes, especially if you buy the arguments of some IPO proponents
who say that recent laws (particularly the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, otherwise
known as the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection
Act of 2002) are likely to boost overall IPO performance. But if you are
inclined to take a gamble, please don’t do it with any more money than you
can afford to lose, and consider waiting a while. Buying into IPOX now, after
three glorious years of returns, may not be the wisest timing.

Chapter 11: Specialized Stock ETFs

Funds That Thrive When 
the Market Takes a Dive
In June 2006, an outfit called ProShares introduced eight new ETFs. Four of
the eight are designed to short the market. That is, these ETFs are designed to
go up when the market goes down. Your selection of ProShares includes the
Short QQQ fund (PSQ), which is betting against the NASDAQ-100; the Short
S&P500 (SH), the Short MidCap400 (MYY), and the Short Dow30 (DOG).
DOG indeed. If I were to devise a ticker for the entire lot, it would be HUH?
Entering an upside down world
In other parts of this book, I talk about correlation and how wonderful it is
when you can find two asset classes that go up and down at different times.
Heck, it would seem that the ProShares Short funds are the ideal addition to a
portfolio. Talk about diversification! Ah, but there’s one little hitch: When you
diversify, you want to find various asset classes that move out of synch but
that are all moving upward, making money for you. ProShares are destined to
go downward.
Sure, sometimes stocks decline. But over the long-run, they rise. They must
rise. If they didn’t, we wouldn’t have a stock market. Who would invest? So
over the long-run, you would expect ProShares Short funds to lose money.
The only way to make money with these funds is to time the market right: 
to jump in just as the market is about to dive and then pull out before the
market goes up. Good luck! Market timing, I’m not the first to say, is a 
fool’s game.
Boasting a track record like none other
Don’t take my word for anything I said in the previous section. Just check the
long-term performance records of ProFunds, the mutual funds produced by
the very same people who produce ProShares. The company’s so-called
Inverse mutual funds and the company’s Short ETFs are very similar.
Ready for some depressing numbers? See www.profunds.com/prices/
performance.asp.
160
Part II: Building the Stock (Equity) Side of Your Portfolio 

Here, for example, are the annualized return figures for the ProFunds
UltraShort OTC mutual fund, which has been proudly torturing investors
since June 2, 1998:
 One year: –1.08 percent
 Five years: –21.04 percent
 Ten years: –15.63 percent
 Since inception: –36.58 percent
Sure, over the next 10 or 20 years, the stock market could tumble, and 
you can make money with inverse or short funds such as you can get with
ProFunds or ProShares. But the odds are heavily, heavily stacked against you.
And to play the game will cost you: All the ProShares carry an expense ratio
of 0.95 percent, making them just about the most expensive ETFs on the
market.
Funds That Double the Thrill of 
Investing (for Better or Worse)
The other four ETFs introduced by ProFunds appeal not to market pessimists
but to extreme optimists. These are leveraged funds that include the Ultra
QQQ (QLD), which “seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses,
that correspond to twice (200%) the daily performance of the NASDAQ-100
Index,” and the similarly designed Ultra S&P500 (SSO), Ultra MidCap400
(MVV), and Ultra Dow30 (DDM).
You think the market is going to soar? These funds, which use futures and
other derivatives to magnify market returns, promise to make you twice the
money you would make by simply investing in the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500,
the S&P MidCap 400, or the Dow. Of course, you’ll have to accept twice the
volatility. It seems like a fair bet. But it really isn’t.
Suppose you invest in the Ultra S&P500 (SSO), as opposed to, say, the SPDR
500 (SPY). On a daily basis, if the underlying index goes up, your investment
will go up twice as much. If the underlying index goes down, your investment
will go down twice as much. Clearly the volatility is double. But let’s look at
the potential returns, as well.
161
Chapter 11: Specialized Stock ETFs

The SPY is going to cost you 0.10 percent in operating expenses. The SSO is
going to cost you 0.95 percent. That’s a difference of 0.85 percent a year, or
$425 on a $50,000 investment (which will be compounded yearly). You can
expect about 1.8 percent in dividends on SPY. Since SSO invests largely in
futures, you aren’t going to get much in dividends — probably less than 
half. That’s a difference, on a $50,000 investment, of about another $450 or
more. Already you’ve lost ($425 + $450) $875, regardless of which way the
market goes.
And again, let’s look at the long-term track record. ProShares Ultra funds, like
their Short funds, have mutual fund equivalents (issued by the very same
company) that have been in existence for many years. The UltraBull Fund, for
example, has been around since November 27, 1997. Just like SSO, it promises
you twice the punch of the S&P 500 and operates in much the same way. Let’s
see how well it has done.
Annualized return figures for the UltraBull Fund are as follows:
 One year: 9.32 percent
 Five years: 17.53 percent
 Ten years: –4.11 percent
 Since inception: –0.62 percent
How does this compare to SPY (inception date February 8, 1993)? Annualized
return figures for the SPDR 500 (SPY) are as follows:
 One year: 8.51 percent
 Five years: 1.87 percent
 Ten years: 8.16 percent
 Since inception: 10.33 percent
Twice the volatility. Considerably less than half the return potential. Doesn’t
seem like anything to write home about, does it?

Chapter 11: Specialized Stock ETFs
The author’s pipedream
Throughout this book, I mention a few ETFs I’d
like to see offered. In the area of specialized
stock ETFs, one that doesn’t exist is a
“Reasonably-Paid-Top-Executives ETF.” I might
buy into it if it did exist. It stands to reason that
when corporations pay their suits astronomical
amounts of money, shareholders may stand to
lose. After all, those millions and millions (some-
times billions) have to come from somewhere.
According to compensation researchers
Lucian Bebchuk of Harvard University and
Jesse Fried of the University of California at
Berkeley, the pay of top executives eats seri-
ously into U.S. corporate profits. In the period
1993–1995, public companies collectively paid
their top five executives the equivalent of 5 per-
cent of profits. By 2000–2002, that amount had
reached 12.8 percent of corporate profits. That
percentage declined but was still almost 10
percent in 2001–2003, the latest period of time
the two law professors examined.
Not too surprisingly (at least in my mind), one
study done by the Institute for Policy Studies
and United for a Fair Economy found that those
reduced profits are indeed hurting sharehold-
ers. The study looked at stock market returns
for major U.S. corporations between 1991 and
the end of 2004. Sure enough, the “Greedy CEO
Portfolio” — a portfolio of those corporations
that pay their CEOs the most — severely under-
performed the S&P 500. Hence, an ETF com-
prised of stocks in companies that curb
executive pay might be expected to outperform
the market.

Adding Bonds,
REITs, and Other
ETFs to Your
Portfolio

In this part . . .
T
he majority of ETFs — all those I discuss in Part II —
represent common stock holdings. In this part, I intro-
duce you to the minority: those two dozen or so ETFs that
represent bonds, real estate investment trusts (REITs),
and commodities such as gold, silver, and oil. Such hold-
ings have enormous diversification power — the power to
protect you if the stock market takes a big roll.
For sure, you have various means of owning such hold-
ings. You can buy individual bonds, investment properties
in Arizona (be careful not to step on a cactus), gold coins,
and silver bullion. Heck, you can fill your garage with bar-
rels of oil. But no method is as easy, efficient, and frugal as
holding them as ETFs.

I
love inline skating. Sometimes, I admit it, I take to the Pennsylvania hills a
bit too fast. There’s just something about the trees racing by and the wind
in my face that I can’t resist. Whoosh!
On occasion, I hit a bump, or some tiny woman in an SUV who can barely see
over the steering wheel (they’re all over my neighborhood) pulls out too fast
in front of me, and I crash to the pavement. But thanks to the heavy black
plastic armor that covers my knees, elbows, wrists, and head (just call me
the Black Knight of Wealth Management), I’ve never been seriously injured.
Bonds are your portfolio’s knee and elbow pads. When the going gets rough,
and you hit the big bump (remember April 2000?), you’ll be very glad to have
bonds in your portfolio.
Plain and simple, there is no time-honored diversification tool for your 
portfolio that even comes close to bonds. They are as good as gold . . . even
better than gold when you look at the long-term returns. Bonds are what may
have saved your grandparents from selling apples on the street following the
stock market crash of 1929.

The one thing that grandpa and grandma never had — but you do — is the
ability to invest in bond ETFs. Like stock ETFs, bond ETFs are inexpensive,
transparent (you know exactly what you’re investing in), and highly liquid
(you can sell them in a flash). Like individual bonds or bond mutual funds,
bond ETFs can also be used to produce a reliable flow of cash in the form of
interest payments, making them especially popular among grandparent types
of any generation.
Throughout this chapter, I discuss a few things about bond investing in gen-
eral. Then, without knowing the intimate particulars of your individual eco-
nomics, I try my best to help you decide if bond ETFs belong in your portfolio,
and if so, which ones. I also address that all-important and highly controver-
sial question of how to achieve an optimal mix of stocks and bonds.
The single most important investment decision you ever make may be in deter-
mining the split between stocks and bonds in your portfolio. No pressure.
Tracing the Track Record of Bonds
Bonds, more or less in their present form, have been used as financial instru-
ments since the Middle Ages. Then, as now, bonds of varying risk existed.
(See the sidebar “The three risks of bond investing.”) Then, as now, risk and
return were highly correlated.
For the most part, bonds are less volatile than stocks, and their returns over
time tend to be less. Over the past 80 years, the average annualized return of
the S&P 500 has been around 10.0, while the return of long-term U.S. govern-
ment bonds has been approximately 5.5 percent.
Comparing the real returns of stocks versus bonds (the return after inflation,
the return that really counts), stocks over the past 80 years clock in at about
7.0 percent and bonds at 2.4 percent — a huge difference. A dollar invested 
in the stock market in 1926 (ignoring all taxes, investment fees, and so on)
would today be worth $227.00. That same dollar invested in bonds would 
be worth about $6.40
These numbers may lead you to look at bonds and say to yourself, “Why
bother?” Well, in fact, there’s good reason to bother. Please read on before
you decide to forsake this all-important asset class.

169
Chapter 12: The (Limited in Number, But Still Very Important) World of Bond ETFs
The three risks of bond investing
When you play a stock, your risks are plenty:
The company you’re investing in may go belly
up; the public may simply lose interest in the
stock, sending the price tumbling; or the entire
economy may falter, in which case, your stock,
like most others, may start to freefall. In the
world of bonds, the risks aren’t quite so high,
and they tend to differ. Here are the three major
risks of investing in bonds or a bond ETF:
 Risk of default. A bond is a promissory
note. The note is only as good as the gov-
ernment, agency, or company that makes
the promise to repay. If you buy a bond from
ABC Corporation, and ABC Corporation
can’t pay, you lose. Risk of default is mostly
an issue with high-yield (“junk”) bonds.
Don’t invest in high-yield bonds unless
you’re willing to shoulder some serious risk.
Keep in mind when buying a high-yield
mutual fund that if the economy tanks and
shaky companies start to sink, you’ll possi-
bly lose both the income from the bonds
and the principal. And that could hurt. High-
yield bonds, for example, were little com-
fort to those who lost money in the stock
market in 2000; high-yields collectively lost
about 6 percent that year. No high-yield
bond ETFs exist, and none of the existing
bond ETFs carry any substantial risk of
default.
 Interest-rate risk. Suppose you are holding
a bond with a 5 percent coupon rate,
bought at a time when interest rates in gen-
eral were 5 percent. Now suppose that the
prevailing interest rate jumps to 10 percent.
Are you going to be happy that you’re hold-
ing a bond that is paying 5 percent? Of
course not. If you hold the bond to maturity,
there’s a great opportunity cost. If you try to
sell the bond before maturity, no one will
give you full price; you’ll need to sell it at a
deep discount and take a loss. The longer
the maturity of the bond, the greater the
interest-rate risk. For that reason, the
iShares Lehman 20+ Year Treasury Bond
Fund (TLT) carries substantial interest-rate
risk, while the iShares Lehman 1–3 Year
Treasury Bond Fund (SHY) carries very
little. All the other funds are somewhere in
between. (There’s a flip side to interest-rate
risk: If you are holding a bond with a 5 per-
cent coupon rate, and the prevailing inter-
est rate drops to 3 percent, your bond will
suddenly become a very hot ticket, selling
at a juicy premium.)
 Inflation risk. Plain and simple, if you are
holding a bond that pays 5 percent, and the
inflation rate is 8 percent, you are in trou-
ble. This is perhaps the biggest risk with
bonds, especially low-yielding bonds, such
as short-term and intermediate-term
Treasurys. (The iShares Lehman 1–3 Year
Treasury Bond Fund could very easily fall
behind the inflation rate.) The only bonds
immune to this risk are the inflation-pro-
tected bonds, which is why part of your
bond portfolio should be invested in the
iShares Lehman TIPS Bond Fund (TIP).
Inflation-protected bonds, however, do
carry interest-rate risk. And they also carry
a risk that no other bonds do: deflation risk.
If prices start to drop, your inflation adjust-
ment will be worth zero, and you’ll be left
holding the lowest yielding bond in the land.

Portfolio protection when you need it most
When determining the attractiveness of bonds, we need to look not only at his-
torical return but also at volatility: Long-term U.S. government bonds (which
tend to be rather volatile bonds) in their worst year ever — 1967 — returned
–9.2 percent. In their second worst year ever — 1958 — they returned –6.1 per-
cent. That’s a walk in the park compared to the worst stock market years of
1931 (–43.3 percent), 1937 (–35 percent), and 1974 (–26.5 percent).
As I note in the introduction to the chapter, during the Great Depression
years, bonds may have saved your grandma and grandpa from destitution.
The annualized real return of the S&P 500 from 1930–1932 was –20 percent.
The annualized real return of long-term U.S. government bonds during the
same three years was 14.9 percent.
There are two reasons that U.S. government bonds (and other high-quality
bonds) often do well in the roughest economic times: 1) People flock to them
for safety, raising demand; and 2) Interest rates often (not always, but often)
drop during tough economic times. Interest rates and the price of bonds have
an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, already-issued bonds (carry-
ing older, relatively high coupon rates) shoot up in price.
Bonds may similarly spare your hide should the upcoming years prove disas-
trous for Wall Street. (You never know.) Whereas international stocks, and
certain industry sectors, like energy and real estate, have limited correlation
to the broad U.S. stock market, bonds (not U.S. junk bonds, but most others)
actually have a slight negative correlation to stocks. In other words, when the
bear market is at its growliest, the complicated labyrinth of economic factors
that typically coincide with that situation — lower inflation (possible defla-
tion), lower interest rates — can bode quite well for fixed income. They cer-
tainly have in the past.
The way in which bonds and stocks tend to zigzag is beautifully illustrated in
Figure 12-1, provided by Vanguard Investments.
History may or may not repeat
Of course, as investment experts say again and again (although few people
listen), historical returns are only mildly indicative of what will happen in 
the future; they are merely reference points. Despite all the crystal balls, tea
leaves, and CNBC commentators in the world, we simply don’t know what the
future will bring.

Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

Although the vast majority of financial professionals use the past century as
pretty much their sole reference point, some point out that in the 19th cen-
tury, stocks and bonds actually had more similar — nearly equal, in fact —
return rates. And perhaps that may be true for the 21st century as well. Time
will tell. In the meantime, having both stocks and bonds in a portfolio would
certainly seem to be the most prudent measure.
Tapping into Bonds in Various Ways
Like stocks, bonds can be bought individually, or you can invest in any of
hundreds of bond mutual funds or a handful of bond ETFs. The primary
reason for picking a bond fund over individual bonds is the same reason for
picking a stock fund over individual stocks: diversification.
Like stocks, bonds can (and should, if your portfolio is large enough) be
broken up into different categories. Instead of large, small, value, and growth
(the way stocks are often broken up), bond categories may include U.S.
Treasury, corporate, international, and municipal bonds — all of varying
maturity dates and credit ratings. Unless you’re a billionaire, you simply can’t

effectively own enough individual bonds to tap into each and every fixed
income class.
Finding strength in numbers
To be honest, diversification in bonds isn’t quite as crucial as it is with
stocks. If you own high-quality U.S. government bonds or bonds from the
most financially secure corporations, you are very unlikely to lose your prin-
cipal, as you can with any stock. But there’s more to diversification than pro-
tecting principal. There’s also much to be said for smoothing out returns and
mollifying risk.
Bond returns can vary greatly. In 2000, for example, U.S. Treasury bonds with
maturities of more than one year returned over 13 percent. That same year,
both high-yield bonds and international bonds lost money. Compare that to
2003 when high-yield bonds returned roughly 29 percent and international
bonds almost 20 percent. U.S. Treasury bonds that year didn’t even keep up
with inflation.
By owning a handful of bond funds, you can effectively diversify across the
map. You can have Treasurys of varying maturities, corporate bonds of vary-
ing credit worthiness, and international bonds of varying continents and 
currencies.
Of course, just as in the world of stocks funds, all bond funds are not created
equal. Some Treasury funds are better than others. Some corporate bond
funds are better than others.
Considering bond fund costs
As far as how to pick a bond fund, low costs are even more essential than
they are in picking a stock fund. When (historically, at least over the past cen-
tury) you’re looking at maybe earning 2.4 percent above inflation, paying a
manager even 1.2 percent a year is going to cut your profits in half. Do you
really care to do that?
The most economical bond funds (like any kind of funds) are index funds,
and you have a number of excellent index bond mutual funds to choose from.
The bond ETFs, however, tend to be the cheapest of the cheap, which is a
reason to like them.
172
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

Although I’m a big proponent of ETFs, I must tell you that the ETF edge in the
fixed income arena isn’t nearly as sharp as it is in stocks. The tax efficiency of
a bond index mutual fund and a bond ETF are just about the same. The won-
derful structure of ETFs that I discuss in Chapter 2 simply doesn’t matter
much when it comes to bonds. Bonds pay interest — that’s how you make
money with bonds — and they rarely see any substantial capital gains. To 
the extent that they do have capital gains, however, the ETF fund may have
an edge over the mutual fund. But that’s no big deal.
Casting a wide net
In the next section, I provide a menu of bond ETFs. These are, by and large,
very good options for the fixed income side of your portfolio. If you have a
modest portfolio, they may be sufficient to fill the entire fixed income side 
of your portfolio. If you have a larger portfolio, or you are in a very high tax
bracket, you may need to look elsewhere. Only a handful of bond ETFs exist,
and they do not yet include international bonds, high-yield bonds, or munici-
pal bonds.
You may wish to consider various bond mutual funds to complement your
bond ETF selections. I discuss a number of bond mutual funds in Chapter 15.
I also use some of these non-ETF bond mutual funds to create sample portfo-
lios in Chapter 16.
Sampling Your Basic Bond-ETF Menu
Of all the ETFs available to U.S. investors, only six are bond funds, and all are
issued by Barclays iShares. The Securities and Exchange Commission, I
happen to know, is sitting on applications for others. But for the time being,
six is what we have to play with, so six is what I have to discuss in this chap-
ter. So be it.
In this section, I present the six bond ETFs. A discussion of the risks and
virtues of each leads us naturally to the ultimate question of whether you
should invest in them, and if so, how much?
Please note that with the discussion of each bond ETF, I include the current
yield — how much each share is paying as a percentage of your investment
on the day I’m writing this chapter. I do this only to give you a flavor of how
the yields differ between the funds. Current yield on a bond or bond fund,
especially a long-term bond or bond fund, can change dramatically from week
173
Chapter 12: The (Limited in Number, But Still Very Important) World of Bond ETFs

to week. So, too, can the difference in yields between the short- and long-term
bonds (known as the yield curve). You can check the current yield of any bond
fund, and the yield curve, on many Web sites, including www.etfconnect.
com and www.morningstar.com.
Tapping the three Treasurys: 
Uncle Sam’s IOUs
If the creator/issuer of a bond is a national government, the issue is called a
sovereign bond. The vast majority of sovereign bonds sold in the United
States are Uncle Sam’s own Treasurys. (Yeah, that’s how they’re typically
spelled. I don’t know why.) Treasury bonds’ claim to fame is the allegedly
absolute assuredness that you’ll get your principal back if you hold a bond 
to maturity. The United States government guarantees it. For that reason,
Treasurys are sometimes called “risk-free.”
Treasury-bond ETFs, thanks to Barclays iShares, come in a short-term, inter-
mediate-term, and long-term variety, depending on the average maturity date
of the bonds in the ETF’s portfolio. The longer the term, generally the higher
the interest rate, but the greater the volatility. Note that interest paid on
Treasurys — including Barclays three Treasury ETFs — is federally taxable
but not taxed by the states.
Following are detailed descriptions of the three Barclays iShare Treasury
ETFs, along with my reviews.
iShares Lehman 1–3 Year Treasury Bond Fund (SHY)
Indexed to: The Lehman Brothers 1–3 Year U.S. Treasury Index, an index
tracking the short-term sector of the United States Treasury market. The fund
uses a representative sampling — typically around 30 individual bond issues.
Expense ratio: 0.15 percent
Current yield: 3.96 percent
Average weighted maturity: 1.8 years
Russell’s review: This ETF is not a favorite of mine. Sure, it’s an ultra-safe
investment with little — almost no — volatility. And the yield is probably
better than you can get in your local savings bank. But still, is this really
where you want to stash your cash? Keep in mind that every time you make a
174
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

deposit or withdrawal, you pay a commission. You may do better keeping
your short-term money in a money market fund, a three- to six-month CD, or,
better yet, an Internet bank like EmigrantDirect or ING Direct. The latter two
options generally pay just as much as SHY, they are FDIC insured (making
them just as safe), and you won’t pay for each and every transaction.
iShares Lehman 7–10 Year Treasury Bond Fund (IEF)
Indexed to: The Lehman Brothers 7–10 Year U.S. Treasury Index, an index
tracking the intermediate-term sector of the United States Treasury market.
The fund uses a representative sampling — typically around 20 individual
bond issues.
Expense ratio: 0.15 percent
Current yield: 4.40 percent
Average weighted maturity: 8.4 years
Russell’s review: Expect modest returns and modest volatility. Of the three
kinds of Treasurys, the intermediate-term bonds make most sense for most
people’s portfolios, and IEF is an excellent way to invest in them. Whatever
your total allocation to fixed income, IEF deserves an allotment of perhaps
one-fifth to one-third of that amount. See how I work it into several model
portfolios in Chapter 16.
iShares Lehman 20+ Year Treasury Bond Fund (TLT)
Indexed to: The Lehman Brothers 20+ Year U.S. Treasury Index, an index
tracking the long-term sector of the United States Treasury market. The fund
uses a representative sampling — typically around 15 individual bond issues.
Expense ratio: 0.15 percent
Current yield: 4.73 percent
Average weighted maturity: 23.1 years
Russell’s review: Hmmm. I believe that Treasurys are perhaps the safest
investment in the land, but not entirely risk-free. I don’t mean to sound unpatri-
otic. I don’t mean to sound alarmist. But the steepness of this nation’s deficit
makes the hills of Pennsylvania look flat. It really scares me. The U.S. electorate
seems to barely take notice. I may consider a short-term Treasury bill risk-free,
but a 20+ year Treasury? Wag your flag all you like, but there is some risk of
principal. And given the maturity of the bond, there is certainly going to be a
175
Chapter 12: The (Limited in Number, But Still Very Important) World of Bond ETFs

heck of a lot of volatility. (If interest rates shoot up, the value of this fund will
shoot down.) Long-term Treasurys may deserve a modest allocation in your
portfolio, and this ETF is as good a way as any of getting it. But make sure that
any money allocated to this fund is money that you aren’t going to need to
touch for a number of years, just in case the bond market takes a hit.
Gas at $4.00 a gallon? Getting 
inflation protection in a flash
Technically, U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities are Treasurys, but
they are usually referred to as TIPS. I discuss them separately from the other
Treasury obligations here because they play a distinctly different role in your
portfolio.
The gig with TIPS is this: They pay you only a nominal amount of interest
(currently about 2.5 percent), but they also kick in an adjustment for inflation.
So, for example, if inflation is running at 4 percent, all things being equal, your
TIPs will yield 6.5 percent. The iShares TIPS ETF is a fabulous way to tap into
this almost essential ingredient in a well-balanced portfolio.
iShares Lehman TIPS Bond Fund (TIP)
Indexed to: The Lehman Brothers U.S. Treasury Inflation-protected sector of
the United States Treasury market. The fund uses a representative sampling
of roughly 15 bond issues.
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Current yield: 6.7 percent
Average weighted maturity: 10.5 years
Russell’s review: TIPS belong in your portfolio, and this fund is the best way
to hold them. You won’t get rich off this fund, and the volatility may be more
than you like. But if inflation goes on a tear, you are protected. Not so with
other bonds. Of course, if inflation doesn’t go on a tear, your money will get
sub-market returns. But that is a risk worth paying. Note that TIPS are notori-
ously tax inefficient, even when held in an ETF. Preferably, you’ll keep your
shares of TIP in a tax-advantaged retirement account. In general, whatever
your overall allocation is to fixed income (excluding short-term cash needs),
one-quarter to one-third of that amount could be put into TIP.

Banking on business: 
A corporate bond ETF
Logically enough, corporations issue bonds called corporate bonds, and you
can buy a dizzying array of them with varying maturities, yields, and ratings.
Or you can buy a representative sampling through the Barclays iShare corpo-
rate bond ETF. Corporate bonds typically pay higher rates than government
bonds, so you would expect the long-term payout from this ETF to be higher
than any of the funds I discuss in previous sections.
177
Chapter 12: The (Limited in Number, But Still Very Important) World of Bond ETFs
Understanding bond ratings
United States Treasury bonds are considered
the safest of all bonds because they are backed
by the U.S. government. Bonds issued by fed-
eral government-agencies (such as Ginnie
Mae) are typically one tiny step below Treasury
bonds in terms of safety.
Bonds issued by corporations and municipali-
ties (cities, counties, and their agencies) can
vary in safety from quite high to very low,
depending on the financial strength of the
issuer. (Corporations tend to default more often
than do municipalities.) The financial strength
of the issuer is judged by credit rating agencies,
such as Standard & Poors (S&P) and Moody’s.
Following are the ratings you most commonly
find.

In the area of corporate bonds, bond credit ratings are essential. Know that
the average bond rating of the GS $ InvesTop Corporate Bond Fund is A,
which means, more or less, that the bonds are issued by companies whose
solvency is fairly solid (although certainly not on a par with the United States
government). See the sidebar “Understanding bond ratings” if you wish to
know more.
iShares GS $ InvesTop Corporate Bond Fund (LQD)
Indexed to: The GS $ InvesTop Index — an index of bond issues sponsored
by a chorus line of companies rated “investment grade” (which means highly
unlikely to go bankrupt any time soon) or above
Expense ratio: 0.15 percent
Current yield: 5.33 percent
Average credit quality: A
Average weighted maturity: 9.7 years
Russell’s review: Investment-grade corporate bonds have done a pretty good
job of holding their own in bad times. You get a bit more return than you do
with Treasurys of equal maturity, although you pay state taxes on the divi-
dends from corporate bonds. If your portfolio is large enough, you want LQD,
as well as one of the Treasury ETFs and TIP. See how I include all three of
these winners in the sample portfolios presented in Chapter 16.
The whole shebang: Investing 
in the entire U.S. bond market
The broadest fixed-income ETF is an all-around good bet.
iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG)
Indexed to: The Lehman Aggregate Bond Index, which tracks the perfor-
mance of the total U.S. investment grade bond market, including both govern-
ment bonds and the highest quality corporate bonds. More than 6,000 bonds
are in the index, but AGG uses a representative sampling of roughly 120 hold-
ings. The average credit quality — AAA — indicates that there is very little
chance any of the bonds in the index will default. (Even if one or two did,
with 120 holdings, it wouldn’t kill you.)
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
178
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

Current yield: 4.6 percent
Average credit quality: AAA
Average weighted maturity: 6.9 years
Russell’s review: Where can you go wrong with the world’s largest ETF
provider tracking the entire bond market for you and charging you only one-
fifth of 1 percent? AGG makes an excellent building block in smaller portfolios
or for any investor seeking the ultimate in simplicity. For larger portfolios,
however, where you can afford to mix and match other bond funds of differ-
ing kinds, the need for AGG becomes less clear.
Determining the Optimal 
Fixed Income Allocation
Okay, now that I’ve talked about which bonds to buy, it’s time to tackle the
really tough question: How much of your portfolio should you allocate to
bonds? The common thought on the subject — and I’m not above common
thought, especially when it is right on the mark — is that the more conserva-
tive you want the portfolio to be, the higher the allocation to bonds.
But that answer begs the question, just how conservative do you want 
your portfolio to be? Different financial planners use different approaches 
to answer this monster question. And before I even start, let me say that I 
am about to oversimplify matters greatly for the sake of brevity.
Here’s my take: I reckon that stocks are very likely to continue outperforming
bonds into the foreseeable future. But as in the past, we will see up years and
down years in both markets. The down years in the stock market are the far
179
Chapter 12: The (Limited in Number, But Still Very Important) World of Bond ETFs
The ultimate in simplicity
Want real simple investing? Combine The
Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate (Bond) Index

ETF (VTI) and the iShares MSCI EAFE fund (EFA).
Presto! These three ETFs provide you with a

low price.

more dangerous. Bear stock markets, historically, don’t last for more than a
few years, although some have been particularly brutal and have lasted a
decade or more. (Think 1930s and late 1960s to mid 1970s.)
For most investors over the past 100 years, stocks have paid off handsomely.
So it’s a balancing act. Too much in the way of stocks, and, should the mar-
kets go sour, you risk quick poverty. Too much in the way of bonds, and,
should the general price level rise too much, you risk slow poverty as the
interest just barely stays ahead of inflation, and you eat into your capital to
pay the bills.
60/40? 50/50? Finding a 
split that makes sense
The balance point between stocks and bonds is usually expressed as the
equation stocks/bonds, so a 60/40 portfolio means 40 percent bonds. The
optimal balance point depends on many factors: age, size of portfolio, income
stream, financial responsibilities, economic safety net, and emotional ability
to deal with risk.
In general, I like to see investors hold three to six months’ living expenses in
cash (money markets or Internet savings accounts) or near-cash (very short-
term bond funds, short-term CDs). Beyond that, the portfolio should be allo-
cated to stocks and bonds, perhaps with a sliver to commodities.
In determining an optimal split, I would first ask you to pick a date when you
think you may need to start withdrawing money from your nest egg. How
much do you anticipate withdrawing? Maybe $30,000 a year? Or $40,000?
Whatever the number, multiply it by 20. That amount, ideally, is what I’d like
to see you have in your total portfolio, at a minimum, when you retire. Now
multiply the same number by 10; that amount, ideally, is what I’d like to see
you have in bonds, at minimum.
Meet Joe, age 64, with 
$600,000 in the bank
So let’s consider Joe. He’s a single guy with no kids who figures he’s going to
retire in one year. Joe has $600,000 in investments. He estimates that after
Social Security and his very decent government pension, he needs to pull
another $24,000 a year out of savings to pay all the bills. It seems to me that
180
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

Joe can do that and have a reasonable chance that his money will last as long
as he lives. But how much should be in bonds and how much in stocks?
As a ballpark figure, without knowing much more about Joe, and ignoring for
the moment such sticky things as present value and taxes and Joe’s expected
longevity, I’d start my portfolio construction with about $240,000 ($24,000 ×
10) in mixed fixed income that would almost certainly include the Lehman
7–10 Treasury ETF (IEF) and the Lehman TIPS ETF (TIP).
The rest of Joe’s money I would invest in a widely diversified portfolio made up
mostly of stock ETFs. Thus, Joe might be looking at an allocation of $360,000
stocks/$240,000 bonds, or a 60/40 allocation. Joe also might be a good candi-
date for an immediate fixed annuity that would guarantee him the $24,000 a
year. (Important note: Many annuities are financial dogs, and even the best
annuities aren’t for everyone. Please see my discussion in Chapter 15.)
A 60/40 allocation would generally be considered too risky for a 64-year-old.
Most retirement models would allocate more to the tune of 40/60. So might I
if Joe didn’t have the secure government pension. Note, too, that I would use
60/40 only as my starting point. After taking all aspects of Joe’s personal eco-
nomics into consideration, I could wind up suggesting a 40/60 portfolio, or
perhaps something in between the two, such as a 50/50 portfolio.
Meet Betsy and Mike, age 36, 
with $30,000 in the bank
Betsy and Mike are happily married. They both work and make decent
incomes — enough so that if they needed to, they could live on one income.
Betsy works in academia. Mike is a self-employed landscaper. They have no
children. They have no debt. They would like to retire by age 62.
Betsy and Mike obviously need to accumulate a lot more than $30,000 if they
want to retire by their early 60s. Their situation, I feel, warrants taking about
as much risk as any investor should take. I might suggest an 85/15 portfolio
or even (if Betsy and Mike were the type of people who could emotionally
handle the volatility) a 90/10 portfolio. The 15 or 10 percent in bonds —
$4,500 or $3,000 — I might allocate to The Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate
Index (AGG).
In Chapter 16, I bring Joe, Betsy, and Mike back to look at how their portfolios
might be broken up into various stock and bond ETFs. I also introduce you to
some of their friends of various ages and means and suggest specific stock
and bond ETFs for them, as well.

Why, land is the only thing in the world worth workin’ for, worth fightin’ for,
worth dyin’ for, because it’s the only thing that lasts.
Spoken by the character Gerald O’Hara in Gone with the Wind
W
hether you agree with Scarlett’s father or not, you’ve undoubtedly
noticed (gleefully) how the value of that little patch of land you call
home has appreciated over the past several years. Oh, the price may have
softened a bit lately, but still, you’ve done nicely. If you live in Boston, San
Francisco, or the New Jersey Shore, you’ve won the lottery.
The value of commercial real estate — just about anywhere in the nation —
has likewise been on the steep rise. And if you happen to own some, perhaps
through a real estate investment trust, you likely have made out like a bandit.
In a nutshell, real estate investment trusts, popularly known as REITs (rhymes
with “Pete’s”), are companies that hold portfolios of properties, such as
shopping malls, office buildings, hotels, amusement parks, or timberland. Or

they may hold certain real estate related assets, such as commercial mort-
gages. About 200 REITs in the United States are publicly held, and their stock
trades on the open market just like any other stock.
Via dozens of mutual funds, you can buy into a collection of REITs at one
time. Via a handful of ETFs (currently four), you can similarly buy a bevy of
REITs. And that may not be a bad idea. For the 20 years ended December
2005, the so-called NAREIT Composite Index has enjoyed an average annual
return of 13.8 percent. That outshines the S&P 500’s annual return of 12.7 per-
cent for the same timeframe.
Some holders of REITs and REIT funds believe (and fervently hope) that such
phenomenal performance will continue. Others argue that the glory of REITs
may already be gone with the wind. I argue that REITs deserve a permanent
allocation in most portfolios, and in this chapter, I provide you with several
reasons (in addition to the reason given by Scarlett’s dad).
Considering Five Distinguishing
Characteristics of REITs
You may wonder why an entire chapter of this book is devoted to REIT ETFs.
Why, you may ask, didn’t I merely include them in Chapter 11 with the other
specialized stock ETFs, like high dividend and socially responsible funds?
Good question!
I have five answers. Any one alone probably wouldn’t justify giving REITs a
chapter of their very own. All five together create a pretty good justification.
The first three answers are solid explanations why REITs deserve special
status in the world of investments. The final two answers are, well, a bit
wishy-washy, but many people make these arguments, which means you’re
likely to hear them.
Limited correlation to the broad markets
According to investment analysts Callan Associates, the FTSE/NAREIT Equity
Index, an index of U.S. REITs (similar to the NAREIT Composite Index I men-
tion in the introduction to this chapter), has evidenced a correlation of 0.43
with the S&P 500 over the past 20 years. That means the prices of an S&P 500
index fund and the share prices of a REIT index fund have tended to move in
184
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

the same direction less than half the time. The REIT index has practically no
correlation to bonds.
Having had 20 percent REITs in your portfolio over the past 20 years —
regardless of whether your portfolio was made up of mostly stocks or 
bonds — would have both raised your returns and lowered your volatility. 
It’s the Efficient Frontier (as I discuss in Chapter 4) in action.
Will REITs continue to work their magic? No guarantees, but there’s a pretty
good chance, yes.
Unusually high dividends
REITs typically deliver annual dividend yields of between 5 and 7 percent —
two to three times more than even the highest dividend paying non-REIT
stocks, and easily three times more than the average stock. (Many stocks, 
of course, pay no dividends whatsoever.) The cash usually keeps flowing
regardless of whether a particular REIT’s share price rises or falls, just as
long as the REIT is pulling in some money. That’s because REITs, which get
special tax status, are required by law to pay out 90 percent of their income
as dividends to shareholders. Cool, huh?
Different taxation of dividends
Because REITs are blessed in that they don’t have to pay income taxes, their
dividends are usually fully taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. In
other words, whatever dividends you get will be taxed at year-end according
to your income tax bracket. Few, if any, REIT dividends you receive will qual-
ify for the special 15 percent dividend tax rate. For that reason, your accoun-
tant will undoubtedly urge you to handle your REITs a bit carefully. I urge you
to do so, as well.
Special status among financial 
professionals
The vast majority of wealth advisors — whether they primarily use style
investing, sector investing, or astrology charts and tea leaves — recognize
REITs as a separate asset class and tend to include it in most people’s portfo-
lios. Is that distinction logical and just? Yes, but . . . I’ve asked myself, if REITs
185
Chapter 13: Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Becoming a Virtual Landlord

deserve that distinction of honor, what about some other industry sectors,
such as utilities and energy? After all, both utilities and energy have lately
shown less correlation to the S&P 500 than have REITs. Don’t they deserve
their own slice of the portfolio pie?
I don’t mean to slam REITs; I like REITs. But one possible reason they are seen
as a separate asset class (in addition to the three reasons I explain in the pre-
vious sections) may be that the REIT marketers are more savvy than the mar-
keters of utility stocks (which, in addition to having low correlation to the
broad market, also pay exceptionally high dividends).
Connection to tangible property
Some people argue that REITs are different from other stocks because they
represent tangible property. Well yeah, REITs do represent stores filled with
useless junk and condos filled with single people desperately looking for
dates, and I suppose that makes them different than, say, stock in Microsoft
or Procter & Gamble. (Isn’t toothpaste tangible?) But the reality is that REITs
are stocks. And to a great degree, they behave like stocks. If REITs are differ-
ent than other stocks, dividends and correlation are the likely culprits — not
tangibility.
Picking the Best REIT 
ETF for Your Portfolio
If you want REITs in your portfolio, you won’t get a whole lot of them unless
you purchase a REIT fund. For all the room they take up, REITs simply don’t
make up that large a segment of the economy.
If, for example, you were to buy an S&P 500 index fund, only about 1 percent
of that fund would be made up of stock from REITs. If you were to buy an S&P
mid cap index fund (most REITs would probably qualify as mid caps), you
would still be holding an investment with only about 4 percent REITs.
So if you want the diversification power of this special asset class, you need
to go out of your way to get it. But thanks to ETFs, doing so shouldn’t be
much of a hassle, your expense ratio can be kept to a minimum, and you 
get many of the other benefits that you do with ETFs.
186
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

The tax efficiency of ETFs will help cap any capital gains you enjoy on your
REIT fund, but it can’t do anything to diminish the taxes you’ll be paying on
the dividends. For that reason, all REIT funds — ETFs or otherwise — are best
kept in tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as your IRA or Roth IRA.
Currently, four REIT ETFs are available to U.S. investors, and I outline them
here. None are terrible investments — in fact, all are pretty darned good —
but each is different, and I do have my preferences.
iShares Cohen & Steers Realty 
Majors Index Fund (ICF)
Indexed to: Cohen & Steers Realty Majors Index, which tracks 30 of the
largest and most liquid REITs in the U.S. market. (Cohen & Steers is an invest-
ment firm that specializes in REITs.)
Expense ratio: 0.35 percent
Number of holdings: 31
Top five holdings: Simon Property Group, Vornado Realty Trust, ProLogis,
Equity Residential, Boston Properties
Top sectors: Retail, office buildings, and residential (accounting for 72 per-
cent of total assets)
Russell’s review: Of the four REIT ETFs, the Cohen & Steers offering is the
most selective in that it represents the largest REITs with the biggest volume
of stocks. As such, you could expect the volatility of this fund to be a tad less
than the others, which include smaller and less liquid REITs. You may also
expect the long-term return of this fund to be a smidgen less. The cost — 0.35
percent — is reasonable by any investment standard but is still twice that of
the cheapest REIT ETF. All in all, ICF isn’t a bad investment choice, but it may
not be optimal for all portfolios.
187
Chapter 13: Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Becoming a Virtual Landlord

iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real 
Estate Index Fund (IYR)
Indexed to: Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index, a subset of the Dow Jones U.S.
Financials Index that uses about 90 REIT stocks to track the U.S. commercial
real estate market
Expense ratio: 0.60 percent
Number of holdings: 88
Top five holdings: Simon Property Group, Equity Office Properties Trust,
Equity Residential, ProLogis, Vornado Realty Trust
Top sectors: Retail and office buildings (accounting for 43 percent of total
assets)
Russell’s review: The mix of investments is so close to the streetTRACKS
Wilshire REIT Fund (RWR) that the two funds are almost indistinguishable.
There’s nothing wrong with this fund — nothing whatsoever — but why pay
0.60 percent when you can pay 0.25 percent for the streetTRACKS brand? Or,
perhaps an even easier question to answer, why pay 0.60 percent when you
can pay one-fifth that amount for the Vanguard REIT fund (VNQ), which uses
a somewhat broader index?
streetTRACKS Wilshire REIT 
Index Fund (RWR)
Indexed to: Dow Jones Wilshire REIT Index, which employs roughly 90 
stocks — mid caps, mostly — to track the U.S. REIT market
Expense ratio: 0.25 percent
Number of holdings: 88
Top five holdings: Simon Property Group, General Growth Properties, Equity
Office Properties Trust, Archstone-Smith Trust, Equity Residential
Top sectors: Retail, office buildings, and apartments (accounting for 73 per-
cent of total assets)
188
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

Russell’s review: In essence, this is the same fund as the iShares Dow Jones
U.S. Real Estate Index Fund (IYR), or very close to it, at less than half the
price. If you wish to tap into the U.S. REIT market — which you should, for
dividends, growth, or diversification — RWR is one of your best options,
although I urge you to also consider the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ).
Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ)
Indexed to: The Morgan Stanley U.S. REIT index, which tracks roughly 105
U.S. REITs — representing about half of all publicly traded REITS and roughly
two-thirds the value of the total U.S. REIT market
Expense ratio: 0.12 percent
Number of holdings: 107
Top five holdings: Simon Property Group, Equity Office Properties Trust,
Equity Residential, ProLogis, Vornado Realty Trust
Top sectors: Retail, apartments, and office buildings (accounting for roughly
62 percent of total assets)
Russell’s review: Once again, Vanguard brings to market the most economi-
cal investment vehicle. You can’t find a better way to invest in the U.S. REIT
market than through VNQ. This is a broadly based ETF with an ultra low
expense ratio. Be aware, however, that even with all the advantages of an ETF
and the considerable tax-minimizing prowess of Vanguard, this ETF will repre-
sent something of a tax burden. For that reason, I recommend that you con-
sider purchasing an ETF as a long-term investment and keeping it in a
tax-advantaged retirement account.
Calculating a Proper REIT Allocation
You don’t really need REITs for the income that dividends provide. Some
people have this notion that withdrawing dividends from savings is somehow
okay, but withdrawing principal is not. Don’t confuse the issue, please. Do the
math: If you withdraw $100 from your account, it is withdrawn, and it doesn’t
matter whether it comes from cash created by dividends or from elsewhere.
189
Chapter 13: Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Becoming a Virtual Landlord

If you need cash, you can always create your own “artificial dividend” by sell-
ing any security you like (preferably one that has been appreciating). Not
that I have anything against dividends — they’re fine — but they shouldn’t 
be your primary reason for purchasing REITs.
Your primary motivations for buying REITs should be diversification and
potential growth. In the past, the diversification afforded by REITs has been
significant, as has the growth.
Judging from the past
If we could go back in a time machine 20 years, I’d have you put, heck, every-
thing in Microsoft. But REITs would not have been a bad option either. After
all, they’ve done fabulously, kicking the pants off the S&P 500 and most other
investments. Looking forward, of course, I don’t know what will be. However,
I think we can fairly safely assume that REITs will continue to move in some-
what different cycles from other stocks.
I think we can also fairly safely assume that REITs will not continue to out-
pace most other investments, for the simple reason that no investment does
so indefinitely.
Putting all factors together, I suggest that most investors devote 10 to 20 per-
cent of the equity side of their portfolios to REITs. If your portfolio is 50 per-
cent stock and 50 percent bonds, I might suggest that 5 to 10 percent of your
entire portfolio be devoted to REITs.
What if, like many people, your net worth is largely made up by the value of
your home? You may want to play it a little light on the REITs, but don’t let
the value of your home affect your portfolio decisions to any great degree.
(See the sidebar “Your residence, your portfolio.”)
Splitting the baby
You can certainly put most of your REIT allotment into one of the REIT ETFs I
discuss in this chapter. I suggest, however, that you also consider a position
in international REITs. As yet, no ETFs allow you to tap into international
REITs, so you’ll have to go the mutual fund route. If you have a very hand-
some portfolio ($500,000+), you may also want to consider a highly special-
ized REIT fund, such as a lumber REIT, which can sometimes zig when other
REITs zag.
190

Lumber on over to Chapter 15, where I discuss working non-ETFs into your
portfolio, and you’ll get all the specifics.
191
Chapter 13: Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Becoming a Virtual Landlord
Your residence, your portfolio
If you bought your home for, say, $130,000 some
22 years ago, and that home is now worth
$1,300,000, I say “Congratulations!” But don’t let
that bounty affect your portfolio decisions very
much. After all, you’ll always need a place to
live. Sell the house today, and you’ll presumably
need to buy another (made of similarly over-
priced bundle of tiles and plywood).
Of course, someday you may downsize, and you
will be able to allot part of the value of your home
to your portfolio. For that reason, and that reason
alone, you may want to consider that the value
of domestic real estate and the value of com-
mercial real estate, while two different animals,
are related. If your net worth is heavily into
home, and especially if you are approaching a
stage in life when you may consider downsizing,
you may want to play it easier on REITs than
would, say, an apartment dweller of similar
means. Or you may forget about U.S. REITs and
take a position in foreign REITs. (No foreign REIT
ETFs are available yet, but several mutual funds
exist, which I introduce in Chapter 15.)

and Other Commodities

 Assessing ETFs as a means to tap into commodity wealth
O
ne of my childhood passions was collecting coins from around the
world. Sometime during the Johnson administration, on my meager
allowance of $1 a week, I saved up for three months or so to buy myself a
gold coin: an uncirculated 1923 50-kurush piece from Turkey. Maybe you can
remember getting a shiny new bicycle for Christmas when you were 5 or 6.
Maybe, like Citizen Kane, you remember getting your first sled. My most
prized possession from childhood was that gold coin, smaller than a dime
but absolutely gorgeous.
I still have it.
I never thought of my piece of gold as an investment. But for many people,
gold is just that. Historically, the soft and shiny metal has been seen as the
ultimate hedge against both inflation and market turmoil. Most people
through the ages have bought gold just as I did: as coins, or sometimes in
bricks. Alternatively, in more recent decades, they may have invested in
shares of gold-mining companies.
Either way, investing in gold was always a pain in the neck. With shares of
gold-mining companies, you had to factor in other things beside the price of
pure gold. Political turbulence in South Africa, for example, or a fall in the
value of the rand might send your stock down the mines. Buying gold coins
involved (and still does) paying hefty commissions. Buying gold bricks also
meant (and still does) sizeable commissions and possible assaying expenses.
And both bricks and coins have to be stored and should be insured.

All that hassle changed with the introduction of the first gold ETF in
November 2005. Suddenly, it became possible to buy gold at spot price — in
an instant — with very little commission and no need to fret about storage or
insurance. Thanks to ETFs, you can now also buy silver in the same way.
Even crude oil, if that’s your cup of Texas tea, can be purchased (sort of) with
an ETF, as can coffee futures and contacts on wheat. In this chapter, I discuss
commodities, and especially the commodity ETFs, and whether they belong
in your portfolio.
Oh, by the way, I recently saw that a 50-kurush gold coin just like mine sold
online for $127. But I’m not selling mine!
Gold, Gold, Gold!
Stocks and bonds may rise and fall. Currencies may ebb and flow. Economies
go boom and then bust. Inflation tears nest eggs apart. And through it all,
gold retains its value. Or so goes the old yarn.
The primary reason for buying gold, according to the World Gold Council
(www.gold.org), is that
Market cycles come and go, but gold has maintained its long term value.
Jastram [1977] demonstrated that in inflationary and deflationary times, in
the very long term, gold kept its purchasing power. The value of gold, in
terms of real goods and services that it can buy, has remained remarkably
stable.
Hmm. I’m not sure who Jastram was, and I don’t know exactly what he means
by “very long term,” but I’ve done a bit of research on the subject. Although I
don’t claim that my research is exhaustive or in any way conclusive of the
investment value of gold, it does shed some doubt on the veracity of the
World Gold Council’s claim.
If you look at Table 14-1, you’ll see the price of gold for a sampling of years
between 1920 and 2006, the average price of a basic Hershey chocolate bar in
those years (which I found on a Web site called www.foodtimeline.org),
and how many Hershey bars you could buy with an ounce of gold. Note that
one ounce of gold in 1980 bought 2,460 Hershey bars, while 20 years later, in
2000, it bought a mere 558 bars. At today’s prices — about $680 for an ounce
of gold and about 75 cents for a Hershey bar — you’d get 906 chocolate bars
for the same nugget.

Midas touch or fool’s gold?
Okay, let’s give the World Gold Council the benefit of the doubt and assume
that gold, in the very long term, does maintain its purchasing power. Maybe
Hershey bars are an anomaly. Maybe the past couple decades are the anoma-
ly. Still, you would hope that your investments would do better than merely
keep up with inflation. If that is all gold can do, why hold it as an investment?
(After all, it is a nonproductive lump of metal, so what should you really
expect?)
Well, if you type “gold” into your favorite search engine, you’ll find 10,000
vendors selling it and 10,000 reasons, according to those vendors, why now is
the time to buy. (Um, excuse me, but if the price of gold “can only go up,”
why are you trying so hard to sell it?) Every day, I hear one explanation or
another as to why gold “must” go up from here on (India’s demand for gold . . .
dentists’ demand for gold . . . the mines are drying up . . . gold demand in the
tech industry . . . and so on and so on). These are the very same arguments
I’ve been hearing for years.
I really expect that the best you’ll do over the very long run, as the World
Gold Council puts it, is to maintain purchasing power. But, hey, even that isn’t
a bad thing when every other investment is tanking. Gold, as it happens, does
show little long-term correlation to other assets. And when the going gets
really rough, or seems rough, and people run from more active kinds of
investment, they often turn to gold. Then, as a self-fulfilling prophecy, the
price rises. That’s possibly what’s been happening in the past years since
9/11, the war in Iraq, the growing deficit, and what have you.
195
Chapter 14: All That Glitters: Gold, Silver, and Other Commodities

In the final analysis, if you want to hold gold, it probably wouldn’t hurt. But
please don’t buy the nonsense that gold “must go up.” It will go up. It will go
down. It will go up again. Have a ball. But don’t bank your retirement on it, okay?
(Personally, I don’t own shares in either gold ETF, but I’m not ruling it out.)
If you allot a small percentage of your portfolio to gold — no more than, say,
5 percent please (actually make that 5 percent total precious metals) — and
keep that percentage constant, you’ll likely eek out a few dollars over time.
Every year, if the price of gold falls, you buy a bit; if the price rises, perhaps
you sell. That strategy is called rebalancing, and I recommend it for all your
portfolio allocations. (See my discussion of yearly portfolio rebalancing in
Chapter 18.)
And if all goes to hell in a hand basket, your gold may offer you some 
protection.
A vastly improved way to
buy the precious metal
When, in November 2005, State Street’s streetTRACKS introduced the first
gold ETF, it was a truly revolutionary moment. You buy a share just as you
would buy a share of any other security, and each share gives you ownership
of one-tenth of an ounce of gold held by the fund. Yes, the gold is actually
held in various bank vaults. You can even see pictures of one such vault filled
to near capacity (very cool!) on www.streettracksgoldshares.com.
If you are going to buy gold, this is far and away the easiest and most sensible
way to do it.
You currently have two ETF options, the original from State Street — the
streetTRACKS Gold Trust (GLD) — and a second introduced months later
from Barclays — the iShares COMEX Gold Trust (IAU). Both funds have
expense ratios of 0.40 percent. Both funds are essentially the same. Flip a
coin (gold or other).
The tax man cometh
Strange as it seems, the ownership of gold, according to the Internal Revenue
Service, is considered ownership of a collectible. A share of either IAU or GLD
is considered the same as, say, a gold Turkish coin from 1923 and, therefore,
is treated as a collectible. (Don’t ask.) So what? As it happens, the long-term
capital gains tax rate on collectibles is 28 percent, and not the more favorable
15 percent afforded to capital gains on stocks.
196
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

Holding the ETF should be no problem as far as taxes (gold certainly won’t
pay dividends), but when you sell, you could get hit hard on any gains. Gold
ETFs, therefore, are best kept in tax-advantaged accounts, such as your IRA.
Silver: The Second Metal
Talk about a silver bullet. After years of lackluster prices, in the early part of
2006, the price of silver suddenly, within three short months, shot up 67 per-
cent. Why? Largely, it was a testimony to the growing power of ETFs!
The price jump was in anticipation of the introduction of Barclays iShares
Silver Trust (SLV) ETF. The fund, introduced in April 2006, works much the
same as the iShares COMEX Gold Trust (IAU). When you buy a share of SLV,
you obtain virtual ownership of 10 ounces of silver.
To provide you with that ownership, Barclays had to buy many ounces of
silver (initially 1.5 million), and that pending demand caused the silver
market to bubble and fizz. Within several weeks after the introduction of the
ETF, the price of silver continued to rise, reaching a 23-year high in May 2006
($14.69 an ounce) before tumbling double digits in the following weeks.
Quick silver on the move
To say that silver is volatile is a gross understatement. In 1979, the price of
silver was about $5 an ounce. In early 1980, the infamous Hunt brothers cor-
nered the silver market (before they were caught), and the metal was briefly
selling for $54 an ounce. Then it fell again. Hard.
If there is any reason to stomach such volatility, it is the fact that silver has a
very low correlation to other investments. For the past five years, the price of
silver has had very, very little correlation to stocks, no correlation to bonds,
and a modest correlation (0.66) to the price of gold.
If you must . . .
If you’re going to take a position in silver, the iShares ETF is the way to go.
The expense ratio of 0.50 percent will eat into your profits or magnify your
losses, but it will still likely be cheaper than paying a commission to buy
silver bars or coins and then paying for a good-sized lockbox.
197
Chapter 14: All That Glitters: Gold, Silver, and Other Commodities

In the very long run, I don’t think you’re likely to do as well with silver as you
would with either stocks or bonds. After all, you will be buying a lump of
metal that will sit in a vault. It isn’t a productive asset like you get when you
buy ownership in a company. In the short run, who knows? Silver could be a
good hedge. But I would urge you to invest very modestly; no more than 5
percent of your portfolio should be allocated to precious metals.
Keep in mind that the same strange tax law pertains to silver as to gold. Any
capital gains will be taxed on the “collectibles” rate of 28 percent. You may
want to keep your silver shares in a tax-advantaged account.
Oil: The Liquid Commodity
The United States Oil Fund (USO) opened on the American Stock Exchange
on April 10, 2006. Even though the fund is technically not an ETF but a very
close cousin called a commodity pool, in my mind, that date marks a sort of
end to the Age of Innocence for ETFs. The United States Oil Fund, as official
as that sounds, is run by a group called Victoria Bay Asset Management,
which I will return to in just a moment.
Don’t mistake this fund for something like the Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) or
the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) funds, both of which invest in oil compa-
nies, like Exxon Mobil Corp. Don’t mistake this fund for something like any of
the precious metal commodity funds discussed in this chapter thus far.
Victoria Bay, wherever that is, is not filled with oil. Whereas Barclays and
State Street maintain vaults filled with gold and silver, Victoria Bay deals in
paper: futures contracts, to be exact.
In other words, they use your money to speculate on tomorrow’s price of oil.
If the price of oil goes up 10 percent in the next several weeks, you should,
theoretically, earn a 10 percent profit minus the fund’s expense ratio of 0.85
percent. The price of oil and gas, as everyone knows, has been on a tear
lately. And so this fund promises to give you a piece of that action, perhaps
offering warm comfort every time you pull up to the pump and have to yank
out your credit card.
Oily business
Yes, you may profit if you buy this ETF and the price of oil continues to esca-
late. Then again, is there reason to believe that the price of oil will continue
to escalate? The famed economist John Maynard Keynes in 1930 theorized
that commodity futures, over time, will offer compensation above and
beyond any rise in the price of a commodity. He speculated that speculators
will somehow be rewarded for taking the risk of future price uncertainly.
Keynes’s theory is unproven and very controversial.
198
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

But even if Keynes proves right, why pick one single commodity to invest in?
Why not diversify your risks with a variety of commodities? Several ETFs
already attempt to do that, and others are on the way. (I discuss these just as
soon as I’m done with USO.) I equate the arrival of USO with the end of an
Age of Innocence because it clearly, in my mind, is pandering to recent head-
lines about high oil prices and people’s disgust at the pumps.
No experience necessary
In addition, the issuer of the USO fund is not a major investment bank but
rather Victoria Bay Asset Management, LLC, “a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Wainwright Holdings, Inc., a Delaware Corporation . . . that also owns an
insurance company organized under Bermuda law.” The fund’s prospectus,
especially the part about the management of Victoria Bay, makes for very
interesting reading.
Two of the top people running the fund also manage a mutual fund called
Ameristock, and a third, Malcolm R. Fobes III (no relation to Malcolm Forbes),
is the founder of the Berkshire Focus Fund (no relation to the fabulously suc-
cessful Berkshire Hathaway.) Both Ameristock and Berkshire Focus (both
with Morningstar one-star ratings) have track records that would probably
make you cringe.
But the part of the prospectus that really raises an eyebrow is where it
explains that “the managing and directing of day-to-day activities and affairs
[of the fund] relies heavily on . . . Mr. John Love,” who, we later learn, is not
only employed by Ameristock but also “holds a BFA in cinema-television from
the University of Southern California. Mr. Love does not have any experience
running a commodity pool.” His experience: “from December 2000 to
February 2001 [sic], Mr. Love was employed by Digital Boardwalk, Inc.”
Even if John Maynard Keynes was right, no one running this fund seems
nearly as smart as J.M. Keynes — or Jed Clampett. I would not invest in this
fund; neither should you.
(Somewhat) Safer Commodity Plays
Just as diversification works to dampen the risk of stock investing, it can 
similarly smooth out — to a degree — the ups and downs of investing in 
commodities.
199
Chapter 14: All That Glitters: Gold, Silver, and Other Commodities

General commodity funds
Make no mistake, the Deutsche Bank Commodity Index Tracking Fund
(DBC), issued in February 2006, is one volatile investment. Rather than a true
ETF, this fund (like the USO) is a commodity pool that deals in commodities
futures.
Unlike the USO, or the gold and silver ETFs, the Deutsche Bank offering has a
bit of diversity to protect you if one commodity suddenly goes way south.
That diversity, alas, is limited. It entails six commodity classes: crude oil (35
percent), home heating oil (20 percent), aluminum (12.5 percent), corn (11.25
percent), wheat (11.25 percent), and gold (10 percent). The expense ratio —
0.68 percent — isn’t outrageous but is still high by ETF standards.
I like the idea of a general commodity fund, although I’m not wild about DBC.
As it happens, in June 2006, Barclays issued two ETFs that offer perhaps the
best option yet for investing directly in commodities.
Just like the Deutsche Bank fund, the Barclays offerings aren’t true ETFs;
Barclays calls them ETNs for exchange-traded notes. They are the iPath GSCI
Total Return Index ETN (GSP) and the iPath Dow Jones-AIG Commodity
Index Total Return ETN (DJP). These are, in fact, very different from
Barclays iShares ETFs. They are actually debt instruments, more like bonds
than anything else. By buying them, you are lending Barclays your money,
and you are counting on Barclays to give it back. (If Barclays were to go
under, you lose.) That’s not the case with iShares or any other ETF, where the
ETF provider is acting more as a custodian of your funds than anything else.
If it were any other company but Barclays, I might worry. But Barclays is
rated a very stable company, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it going
under. Your bigger worry is the future of commodity prices. Barclays
promises to use “any tool necessary” to use your money to track commodity
prices. Presumably, it works something like the Deutsche Bank fund in that it
uses primarily futures contracts. But Barclays won’t say. ETNs are not trans-
parent like ETFs. You don’t know exactly what you’re holding.
So why do I like these funds more than the Deutsche Bank fund? It isn’t the
expense ratio. At 0.75 percent, the Barclay’s funds are actually a tad more
expensive. Here are the three reasons I prefer the Barclay’s funds:
 I have a good amount of faith in the company; it’s huge, it’s well-
managed, and it’s profitable.
 The Barclays funds, by promising to curtail capital gains and dividends,
will likely be much more tax efficient than the Deutsche Bank fund.
200
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

 The Barclays ETNs offer somewhat better diversification. Both ETNs
invest in a number of commodities, from oil and natural gas to gold and
silver to cocoa and coffee.
Of the two new funds, I prefer the iPath Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index
Total Return ETN (DJP) for its well-established index and the balanced
weightings of its holdings: energy (30 percent), livestock (9 percent), pre-
cious metals (9 percent), industrial metals (21 percent), and agriculture (31
percent). Still, even when diversified, commodities are volatile, and their
long-term returns are not as well established as the long-term return on
stocks and bonds.
If you buy into a Barclays ETN, you should do so for the right reason: lack of
correlation. Both the iPath funds have shown almost no correlation to either
stocks or bonds. For more information on these funds, Barclays has a special
Website: www.ipathetn.com.
As with precious metals funds, devoting 5 percent of your portfolio to either
of the iPath funds would be plenty. No more than that, please. Oh, one little
caveat: The IRS isn’t entirely certain how it will be taxing these new funds yet.
If you’re not going to stash them into a tax-advantaged retirement account,
you could be in for an unpleasant surprise.
Tapping into commodity companies
Another option for hitching your star, or part of your star, to commodities is
to invest in commodity providing companies. There are perhaps a dozen
ETFs that allow you to invest in oil and gas company stocks. Among them are
 Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE)
 Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE)
 iShares Dow Jones U.S. Energy Index (IYE)
 PowerShares Dynamic Energy & Exploration (PXE)
 iShares Dow Jones U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration/Production Index 
Fund (IOE)
 iShares Dow Jones U.S. Oil Equipment & Services Index Fund (IEZ)
 iShares S&P Global Energy Index Fund (IXC)
They all sound different, but when you look at the roster of companies, they
are all actually quite similar, and I feel equally lukewarm about all of them.
201
Chapter 14: All That Glitters: Gold, Silver, and Other Commodities

Keep in mind that the energy sector, unlike something like REITs (see Chapter
13), is a large sector of the U.S. economy. Energy companies make up about
10 percent of the capitalization of the U.S. stock market. So just being
invested in the market, you have some decent exposure to energy already.
If you really want to grab any profits ensuing from rising demand for com-
modities and would rather not invest directly in commodities, a better fund
may be the iShares Goldman Sachs Natural Resources Index Fund (IGE). Like
all the other funds I list in this section, the fund invests in oil companies, but
it invests in other commodity providers, too. Unfortunately, the fund is so
heavy in energy (57 percent oil and 19.50 percent oil services) that its perfor-
mance will match all the other energy funds rather closely. (Other than
energy, the fund offers very limited exposure to metals and mining compa-
nies, and paper and forest firms.)
Tapping into commodity countries
As commodity prices go, so often go the stock markets of countries that pro-
vide the world with much of its commodities. By and large, those nations are
the emerging market nations.
Although they can be just as volatile as commodities themselves, you can
invest, through Barclays iShares, in the stock markets of nations such as
gold-rich South Africa (the iShares MSCI South Africa fund [EZA]), timber
giant Brazil (iShares MSCI Brazil [EWZ]), or mineral-laden Malaysia (iShares
MSCI Malaysia [EWM]).
I would suggest, however, that your play in emerging markets be diversified
through one of several ETFs that allow you to invest in a broad array of emerg-
ing market nations. Those include the iShares MSCI Emerging Market fund
(EEM), the BLDRS Emerging Markets 50 ADR (ADRE), and the Vanguard
Emerging Market ETF (VWO). I discuss these funds in some depth in Chapter 10.

Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

Chapter 15
Working Non-ETFs into Your
Investment Mix
In This Chapter
 Incorporating ETFs into an existing portfolio of mutual funds or individual securities
 Spotting holes in an ETF portfolio
 Choosing investments that best complement your stock ETFs
 Constructing the fixed income side of your portfolio
A
s new ETFs spring up, it has become easy to build a universe of invest-
ments using these low-cost vehicles. With 240 and counting, you can
now invest in just about any area of the market. You’ve got your option of
large company stock and small stock ETFs, various industry sectors, interna-
tional stocks, Treasury bonds and corporate bonds, commodities, and more.
And yet, for all their variety, ETFs also serve up a lot of repetition. Count ’em:
There are no fewer than 30 broad-based large cap U.S. stock ETFs, for example.
Plus, for all the variety, the ETF universe still has some black holes. You can’t,
for example, buy an ETF that gives you exposure to either tax-free municipal
or high-yield bonds. Or international bonds. Or international REITs. Well, at
least as I sit down to write this chapter, these asset classes are not yet avail-
able in ETF form. That situation will surely change. Just as I was finishing up
this book, WisdomTree issued the first ever small international stock ETFs.
For the time being, you have to look elsewhere to tap into several asset
classes. This chapter serves as a quick guide to doing so.
This chapter also serves as a reference for those of you who already have
non-ETF portfolios in place and want to keep them more or less intact.
Perhaps you have huge unrealized tax gains and don’t care to donate to the
IRS just yet. Or your investment options may be limited by your employer’s
401(k) plan options. Or you may be happy with your indexed mutual funds,
which is fine.

For some of you — ah, yes, I know you’re out there — no amount of cajoling
will ever convince you to index your investments. You fervently believe that
by picking stocks (or hiring someone to do so for you), you can clobber the
market. So be it. I can still urge you to consider investing in an ETF here and
there.
So, without further ado, I now give you my take on how ETFs and non-ETFs
can get along in peace and harmony.
Tinkering with an Existing Stock
or Mutual Fund Portfolio
Alright. Maybe you’re intent on staying put with your existing portfolio. I
understand that. But even you can benefit from an occasional ETF holding. (And
I’m sure you know that, or else you wouldn’t be reading this page right now.)
Improving your diversification
I’ll start by assuming that you are invested in individual stocks and bonds,
saving mutual funds for the next section.
Unless you are really rich, like Warren Buffett rich, you simply cannot have a
truly well-diversified portfolio of individual securities — not nearly as well-
diversified as even the simplest ETF or mutual fund portfolio. Where would
you even start? You’d have to hold a bevy of large company stocks (both
growth and value), small company stocks (again, both growth and value), for-
eign stocks (Asia and Europe and emerging markets, growth and value, large
and small), REIT stocks, and, of course, fixed income investments.
Get real. Examine your portfolio. If you, like so many U.S. investors, have the
large majority of your equity holdings in large company U.S. stocks, you can
diversify in a flash by adding a small cap ETF or two (see Chapters 7 and 8)
and a couple international ETFs (see Chapter 10). If you, like so many
investors who lost their shirts in 2000, are heavily invested in exciting but
somewhat perilous technology companies, you may balance that off by pur-
chasing a few ETFs in boring but less jumpy sectors like utilities or consumer
staples (see Chapter 9).
204
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

Minimizing your investment costs
Now, let’s assume you’re basically a mutual fund kind of guy or gal. You’ve
been reading Money magazine and Kiplinger’s for years. You believe that you
have winnowed down the universe of mutual funds to a handful of winners,
and goshdarnit, you’re going to keep them in your portfolio.
You may have heard the term core and satellite. It refers to an investment
strategy that has been very much in vogue lately. Core and satellite calls for a
portfolio core of basically the entire market, or close to it. Then, you have
your satellites: smaller investments designed to outdo the market. It isn’t
such a bad strategy.
Suppose you have four mutual funds that you love: one tech fund, one health-
care fund, one energy fund, and one international growth fund. Each charges
you a yearly fee of 1.67 percent (the mutual fund average). And suppose you
have $250,000 invested in all four. You are paying ($250,000 × 1.67 percent) a
total of $4,175 a year in management fees, and that’s to say nothing of any
taxes you’re paying on dividends and capital gains.
Consider trimming those investments down and moving half the money into
an ETF. Turn your present core into satellites, and create a new core with the
Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI). It carries an expense ratio of 0.07 per-
cent. Your total management fees are now ($125,000 × 1.67 percent) +
($125,000 × 0.07 percent), or $2087.50 + $87.50, which totals $2,175. You’ve
just saved yourself a very nifty $2,000 a year, and you’ll likely save consider-
able money on taxes, too.
Using ETFs to tax harvest
Regardless of whether you hold individual stocks or mutual funds, you
should hope for nothing but good times ahead but be prepared for something
less. Historically, the stock market takes something of a dip in one out of
every three years. In those years, ETFs can help ease the pain.
Say it’s a particularly bad year for tech stocks, and you happen to own a few
of the most beaten down of the dogs. Come late December, you can sell your
losing tech stocks or mutual funds. As long as you don’t buy them back for 31
days, you can claim a tax loss for the year, and Uncle Sam, in a sense, helps
foot the bill for your losses. Ah, but do you really want to be out of the
market for the entire month of January (typically one of the best months for
stocks)? You don’t need to be.
205
Chapter 15: Working Non-ETFs into Your Investment Mix

Buy yourself a technology ETF, such as the Technology Select Sector SPDR
(XLK), and you’re covered should the market suddenly take a jump. Although
I’d much rather you simply hold onto your ETF as a permanent investment, if
you wish, at the end of 31 days, you can always sell your ETF and buy back
your beloved individual stocks or mutual funds.
I believe that tax harvesting has its value, but it is by and large an overvalued
and overdone strategy. After all, there are costs involved whenever making a
trade. With ETFs and stocks, you pay a commission when you buy or sell.
With any security, there is a spread. You can’t just buy and sell without some
middleman somewhere taking a small cut. Many investors cling to tax har-
vesting religiously. All I’m saying is please discuss the strategy with your tax
adviser (or clergy) before proceeding next year, okay?
Building the Equity Side of 
Your New ETF Portfolio
In this section, I address those of you who are convinced that ETFs are the
best thing since the abolition of pay toilets. You’re ready to build a portfolio
of ETFs but are concerned about those black holes I mention in the introduc-
tion to this chapter.
Unlike the bond side of your portfolio, where the ETF options are meager, you
have many, many stock ETFs to choose from. It really doesn’t take much out-
side of the ETF world to build a very well-diversified stock portfolio. A few
minor asset classes are missing, which would be nice to have in larger portfo-
lios but certainly aren’t necessary. These include non-U.S. real estate and
timber.
For those asset classes not yet represented by ETFs, you’ll have to go the
mutual fund route. I suggest that you read the latest edition of Eric Tyson’s
Mutual Funds For Dummies (Wiley) and investigate mutual fund options on
www.morningstar.com or http://finance.yahoo.com. The options I
give in the following sections are some of the mutual funds that I have used
personally or in client portfolios. They are all no load (meaning you’ll pay no
commission), have reasonable management expenses, and are run by mutual
fund companies with reputations for honesty. I include Web sites and tele-
phone numbers in case you want to go directly to the fund provider. Please
read the prospectus before purchasing any mutual fund.
206
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

International small cap
Once upon a time, the diversification afforded by investing in foreign compa-
nies like Toyota, Sony, Volkswagen, and British Petroleum was a beautiful
complement to your domestic investments in Ford, General Electric, General
Motors, and Texaco. Lately, however, the world has become a smaller place,
and the fortunes of international conglomerates are arguably more bound to
the world economy than to the economy of any nation.
As such, large international companies just don’t offer the diversification
power they once did. But small international companies — those that cater
more to their own home markets than to an international audience — still do.
I’m talking about businesses such as a bank in Tokyo that lends money to
local firms, a company in the U.K. that delivers natural gas to British house-
holds, and a German construction and architectural firm. The correlation of
small international stocks to the U.S. stock market has recently been, accord-
ing to good a number of studies, perhaps half that of large international
stocks.
If you can take some serious volatility, I suggest that of whatever you allocate
to foreign stocks (preferably 40 to 50 percent of your total allocation to
stock), one-third to one-half be allocated to foreign small and mid cap. In
other words, if you have a $250,000 portfolio and you’ve decided to allocate
$150,000 to stocks, consider allocating perhaps $20,000 to $37,500 to small
and mid cap international funds.
WisdomTree came out with a handful of small international stock ETFs in
June 2006. These include the WisdomTree International SmallCap Dividend
Fund (DLS), the WisdomTree Europe SmallCap Dividend Fund (DFE), and the
WisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend Fund (DFJ). All carry expense ratios of
0.58 percent.
Of the three, my favorite would be the broader International SmallCap
Dividend Fund (DLS), which I may very well begin using in my portfolios
soon. As you may have read in Chapter 11, I’m generally not too crazy about
dividend funds, but for the moment, this is all that is available ETF-wise in 
the world of small cap international. For more information, see www.wisdom
tree.com.
If DLS doesn’t float your boat, I suggest looking into the following no load,
well-managed, reasonably priced mutual funds. I’ve used all these for either
my own portfolio or those of clients:
207
Chapter 15: Working Non-ETFs into Your Investment Mix

 Fidelity International Small Cap Opportunities Fund (FSCOX):
800-544-8888; www.fidelity.com
 Third Avenue International Value (TAVIX): 800-443-1021; 
www.thirdavenuefunds.com
 T Rowe Price International Discovery (PRIDX): 800-225-7720;
www.troweprice.com
 Tweedy, Browne Global Value (TBGVX): 800-432-4789; 
www.tweedybrowne.com
 Vanguard International Explorer (VINEX): 800-662-7447; 
www.vanguard.com
The Tweedy, Browne fund (funny name, I know) is a mid and small cap inter-
national fund with a value tilt, meaning you get more value stocks than you
do growth stocks. It is also the only international stock fund that is dollar-
hedged: If the dollar goes up or down vis a vis other currencies, it won’t affect
your balance. The Tweedy, Browne fund reflects only the value of the foreign
markets themselves. That little feature removes half the volatility of investing
abroad and, in a way, almost creates a separate asset class. I use Tweedy,
Browne for roughly half my allocation to foreign small and mid cap stocks
and may continue to do so even after the introduction of more small cap
international ETFs. Unfortunately, the Tweedy, Browne Global Value fund is
currently closed to new investors, but it could possibly reopen.
International REITs
Real estate investment trusts, or REITs (see a full discussion in Chapter 13),
offer sweet diversification to any portfolio. Foreign REITs offer even more
diversification. After all, what could be more local than real estate?
The international REIT market is still in its adolescence. Australia and the
Netherlands have had REITs or REIT-like structures since the early 1970s,
Belgium and Canada since the early 1990s. In none of those countries, how-
ever, does the market cap for such securities even touch the market cap of
U.S. REITs ($250 billion or more). The room for growth in such nations is
enormous.
In other countries, including Japan, France, and Korea, REITs or REIT-like
trusts are much more recent inventions. There, too, the market can seem-
ingly only grow. And in the case of Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom,
nothing quite resembling REITs yet exists, but plans are on the drawing
board. (Other kinds of real estate securities are presently available in those
countries.)
208
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

With the growing availability of foreign REITs, as well as other publicly traded
real estate securities, a handful of firms now offer global real estate funds to
U.S. investors. And a number of others have such funds currently in develop-
ment. Unfortunately, I know of no such ETF in development, so you’ll have to
go with a mutual fund to tap into this asset class.
Whatever your allocation to small and mid cap international stocks, I suggest
that perhaps one-fifth to one-quarter of that amount be allocated to either of
the following two funds:
 Alpine International Real Estate Equity Fund (EGLRX): 885-558-8875;
www.alpinefunds.com
 Fidelity International Real Estate Fund (FIREX): 800-544-8888;
www.fidelity.com
Be aware that foreign REITs, like other foreign stocks, tend to move up and
down in accordance with currency flux, as well as with the value of the
underlying securities. Therefore, you may see the value of your holding move
considerably. If the past is any guide, however, you should do well. Both of
these funds have thus far rewarded their investors richly.
Timber REITs
Real estate comes in many forms, from shopping malls to condos to office
buildings. A handful of REITs own timberland — gazillions of acres of trees.
The land under which the trees are grown tends to rise and fall in value along
with the going price for timber. Therefore, these special REITs behave almost
as a separate asset class. There are days and weeks when most REITs go one
way and timber REITs go another. For that reason, if I have a client with a
fairly large portfolio, I may take a percentage of the U.S. REIT allocation and
move it into timber.
Alas, no timber REIT ETFs exist yet. No timber REIT mutual funds are avail-
able either. For that reason, I buy individual REIT stocks. Two of the largest
timber REITs are the following:
 Plum Creek Timber Company (PCL): 800-254-4961;
www.plumcreek.com
 Rayonier Timber (RYN): 904-357-9155; www.rayonier.com
Keep in mind that these are individual company stocks. Throughout this
book I say that you really shouldn’t invest in individual companies, but I’m
making a small exception here for timber. Individual stocks can be volatile
and sometimes awfully capricious. I suggest limiting your allocation to
absolutely no more than 5 percent of the equity side of your portfolio.
Perhaps take that 5 percent and split it between PCL and RYN.
209
Chapter 15: Working Non-ETFs into Your Investment Mix

Just like all REITs, timber REITs must distribute 90 percent of their income as
dividends. And those dividends will be taxed. Keep your timber REITs, if pos-
sible, in a tax advantaged retirement account.
Where few investors have 
gone before: DFA funds
Perhaps you’ve never heard of the mutual fund company called Dimensional
Fund Advisors, or DFA. For the ultimate in slicing and dicing a portfolio, no
fund company compares. Only through DFA can you, for example, find a fund
that allows you to invest in emerging markets small cap, emerging markets
value, and U.K. small company. All of DFA’s funds are expertly managed index
funds with reasonable expense ratios.
The only problem with DFA is that you can invest in their funds only if you
are an institution with huge bucks, or if you go through a fee-only wealth man-
ager (meaning he takes no commissions). The problem with that, of course, is
that you have to pay the fee-only wealth manager. Since you are reading this
book, you are probably a hands-on, do-it-yourself kind of investor, and you
may not want to pay someone to manage your money.
If, however, you have a handsome portfolio, and if you can find a fee-only
wealth manager who charges you a reasonable amount (try The National
Association of Personal Financial Advisors, www.napfa.org), by all means,
consider DFA (www.dfaus.com). What I’d really love to see is DFA get into
the ETF business!
Building the Fixed Income Side 
of Your New ETF Portfolio
A much as I enjoy in-line skating, I recognize that it does not make for an
entire fitness program. So I accompany my in-line skating with other activi-
ties, like a kick boxing class and lots of walking. With that kind of cross train-
ing, I manage to stay in pretty good shape.
And to keep the fixed income side of my clients’ portfolios in shape, I cannot
rely entirely on bond ETFs. Not yet, at least. For right now, the only kinds of
fixed income represented by ETFs are Treasurys, TIPS, and investment-grade
corporate (see Chapter 12). These three categories do not provide the diver-
sity within fixed income that I would like to see. So for the time being, I would
ask you — especially if you have a portfolio of $50,000 or more — to comple-
ment your bond ETF holdings with one or more of the following other kinds
of fixed income.
210
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

Tax-free glory: Municipal bonds
If the creator of the bond is a city or perhaps a municipal authority, the issue
is called a municipal bond or muni. Interest income from munis is exempt
from federal income tax and, in many cases (especially if you live in the state
that issued the bond), state and local taxes as well. For that reason, the inter-
est rate you get on munis is typically lower than you would get on a taxable
bond of similar maturity.
A simple formula allows you to compare the return you’ll get on a muni to the
return you’ll get on a taxable bond. Here’s the formula: Subtract the federal
marginal tax bracket percentage from the number one, and divide that
number by the tax-free rate.
For example: Assume you are in the 25 percent tax bracket and are consider-
ing a 5.00 percent tax-free bond. You divide 5.00 by 0.75 (1 less 0.25) and find
that the taxable-equivalent yield is 6.67 percent. In other words, you would
need a taxable bond to pay 6.67 percent to match the return on the 5.00 per-
cent tax-exempt.
Got that? Good! Now forget it! Unless you are in an exceptionally high tax
bracket, I urge a position in munis for the diversification power, even if the
simple formula tells you that you’re going to get a lesser return. Munis tend
to move in cycles somewhat different from most taxable bonds.
To date, no ETF allows you to invest in munis, but I have little doubt that one
will appear before very long.
In the meantime, consider the following municipal bond funds. (Note: The fol-
lowing funds are federally tax-free but not state tax-free. If you live in a state
with a high income tax, you may want to investigate munis that are exempt
from both federal and state taxes. You’ll find many offerings at both Vanguard
and Fidelity.)

www.fidelity.com
 Vanguard High-Yield Tax-Exempt (VWAHX): 800-662-7447; 
www.vanguard.com
This fund is somewhat more volatile than the Vanguard Intermediate-
Term Tax-Exempt but should yield a higher return over time.

Maes and Macs: Agency bonds
with a break on tax
Bonds issued by U.S. government-sponsored organizations, such as the
Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), Student Loan
Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), Federal National Mortgage Association
(Fannie Mae), or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac),
are called agency bonds. They are usually exempt from state and local taxes.
Unlike munis, however, they are not exempt from federal tax. Agency bonds
usually fall somewhere between Treasurys and corporate bonds on the
risk/return continuum.
Following are several more-than-acceptable agency bond funds:
 American Century Ginnie Mae (BGNMX): 800-345-2021; www.american
century.com

 Vanguard GNMA Fund (VFIIX): 800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com
I Bonds: An Uncle Sam bond with a twist
Like TIPS (see Chapter 12), I Bonds are inflation indexed. Unlike TIPS, they are
available as individual bonds in very small denominations — as small as $25.
On the upside: The interest earned tends to be greater than TIPS. The corre-
lation to inflation is also more closely matched, as I Bonds change their infla-
tion adjustment every six months. And — a potentially very sweet bonus if
you have young ones — if you use the I Bonds for higher education expenses,
that interest, along with any inflation adjustments, may be yours to keep and
spend tax-free.
On the downside: You must hold I Bonds for at least one year, and you forfeit
three months’ interest if you redeem them before they mature in five years.
You can buy I Bonds by calling 800-722-2678 or visiting www.treasury
direct.gov.
Le bond du jour: International 
fixed income
Foreign bonds make up more than 75 percent of fixed-income opportunities
worldwide, yet the asset class remains largely snubbed by U.S. investors.
212
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

That’s a shame, because the world of international bonds offers many possi-
bilities all the way up and down the risk/return ladder. They present another
asset class to add to a portfolio, lending yet greater diversification. Just as in
the world of stocks, some years are better for international bonds, some are
better for U.S. If you have both, you’ll enjoy a smoother ride on the road to
accumulating wealth.
Morningstar currently lists 79 bond mutual funds categorized as either inter-
national or global. (No ETFs are available yet, but I’m certain they’re coming.)
I suggest that international bonds play a modest role in the portfolio of any
investor with $50,000 or more in fixed income. For those with even larger
fixed income positions, I may suggest both a dollar-hedged and unhedged
position in foreign bonds. The dollar-hedged funds are less volatile. The
unhedged funds offer greater growth potential. (Hedged means that the
exchange rate between the dollar and other currencies is corrected for.
Unhedged means that the return you get on your investment will depend in
part on which way the dollar blows.)

Hold on tight: Junk city
You’re undoubtedly familiar with the term high-yield bond, otherwise known
(when we’re being honest) as a junk bond. A high-yield bond — one that
yields high dividends to compensate for the shaky nature of the bond — can
be sovereign (think Latin American countries), corporate (think General
Motors), or muni (think California). No high-yield bond ETFs exist . . . yet.
Of all the different kinds of high-yield bonds, my favorite are emerging market
bonds issued by governments of countries like Brazil, Venezuela, Korea, and
Russia. If you’re going to have only one kind of junk bond, this is probably the
one to have. Reason: Emerging market bonds have no correlation to U.S.
stocks or bonds. On the other hand, U.S. junk bonds, especially corporate
213
Chapter 15: Working Non-ETFs into Your Investment Mix

junk, tend to correlate with the stock market. When things get rough, they
may not offer much protection the way, say, Treasurys would.
Consider a position in junk, especially emerging market bonds, but don’t allo-
cate it to the fixed income side of your portfolio. Allocate it to the stock side.
Even though junk bonds aren’t stocks, the potential return and volatility are
closer to stocks than to most other bonds. Take, for example, the ten years
ended December 31, 2005. Emerging market bonds during that period saw an
average annual return of 13 percent, with a standard deviation of 14.18 percent.
As for U.S. junk, I generally suggest buying into the asset class — believe it or
not — in more conservative portfolios, where I may substitute U.S. stock for
high-yield bonds. It’s my way of shooting for a fairly good return with limited
risk. In a sense, I see U.S. junk as a hybrid of sorts. Not quite stock; not quite
bond; somewhere in between on both risk and return.
Following are several U.S. high-yield bond funds to consider:

Market-neutral mutual funds
By no means are so-called market-neutral funds bond funds of any sort, but
permit me the literary license to discuss them here. The reason: Unlike junk
bonds, which are bonds but should be allocated to the equity side of your
portfolio, market-neutral funds are actually stock funds that I’d like you to
allocate to the fixed income side of your portfolio. That’s simply because
they tend to behave more like bonds than stocks: The return is somewhat
predictable like bonds, and the volatility is limited.

Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 

Market-neutral funds use vastly different strategies to meet their ends. The
goal of most is to produce long-term returns that are more similar to bonds
than stocks (perhaps a tad higher than bonds) while having no correlation to
either the bond or stock market.
Some market-neutral funds use a long–short strategy. That is, they buy stocks
to enjoy the potential appreciation. They also short stocks (often stock ETFs)
to make money when the market is going down. It’s a tricky business, and
you want to find an experienced manager who has been doing it for a while.
Another strategy involves investing in companies very short-term just on the
cusp of their merging with other companies.
Here are a few market-neutral funds worthy of investigation:

Fixed immediate annuities
For older people especially, and almost definitely for those with no heirs, an
annuity — either a fixed annuity or a variable — can make enormous sense.
With an annuity, you abandon your principal, and in return you enjoy a fully
insured yield typically far greater than you would likely get with any other
fixed-income option.
There are many horrible annuities out there. I can’t tell you how often a new
client walks into my office, throws his annuity papers on the table, and says,
“Why did I ever buy this stupid thing.”
If you are interested in an annuity, start with Charles Schwab, Raymond
James Financial, or Vanguard. In general, brokerage houses offer much, much
better deals than insurance companies. Their annuity products tend to be
cheaper, less complicated, and easier to back out of should you change your
mind:

216
Part III: Adding Bonds, REITs, and Other ETFs to Your Portfolio 
A few odd ducks
I talk in this chapter about mutual funds, indi-
vidual securities (stocks or bonds), and annu-
ities as possible alternatives to, or complements
to, ETFs. But the investment world offers other
options as well. Here are a few of the less
common kinds of investments, some of which
may be worth consideration for your portfolio:
 Closed-end mutual funds: Just as the word
burger without any qualifiers is usually
understood to mean hamburger — not
veggie burger or turkey burger — so are the
words mutual fund usually understood to
mean open-end mutual fund. The vast
majority of mutual funds are open-ended.
That means that the fund has no set limit of
shares. As more investors buy into the fund,
the fund grows, acquiring more securities
and issuing more shares.
Closed-end funds, on the other hand, are
created with a certain amount of shares,
and they forever retain that same amount of
shares. If any new investors want to buy in,
they must buy shares from existing
investors. For that reason, closed-end
mutual funds, unlike open-end mutual
funds, may sell shares at a premium or a
discount. (ETFs may also trade at a premium
or discount, but it tends to be negligible.
Closed-end funds may sometimes be
bought or sold for 50 percent more or less
than the value of the underlying securities.)
Closed-end mutual funds tend to be more
volatile than open-end mutual funds, and
the management fees tend to be higher.
 Unit investment trusts: Some ETFs, espe-
cially the older ones such as the QQQQ
(Qubes) and SPDR 500 and SPDR 400, actually
are unit investment trusts (UITs). However,
not all UITs are ETFs.
A UIT is a fixed portfolio of stocks or bonds
generally sold to investors by brokers. The
UIT is usually sold through a one-time
public offering. It has a termination date,
which could be anywhere from several
months to 50 years down the road. Upon
termination, the UIT dissolves.
In the case of ETF/UITs, however, it’s a
slightly different story. When the first ETFs
were created, there was an original termi-
nation date of 25 years hence. But as the
ETFs grew in popularity, ETF providers peti-
tioned the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) to make an exception,
which the SEC did.
 Hedge funds/Limited partnerships: Hedge
funds — funds that promise insurance
against bad markets — come in many dif-
ferent flavors and use any number of strate-
gies to achieve (or try to achieve) their
objective. Of late, a number of mutual funds
have been billing themselves as hedge
funds. No ETFs have done so to date, but the
time is coming, I’m sure. Traditionally, how-
ever, most hedge funds are neither mutual
funds nor ETFs; rather, they are organized
as limited partnerships. Limited partner-
ships are largely unregulated, fees tend to
be high, and liquidity (the ability to get your
money out if you need it) can be very lim-
ited. Proceed with great caution.

I
f there is such a thing as a personal hell, and if, for whatever reason, I piss
off the Big Guy before I die, I’m fairly certain that I will spend eternity in
either a Home Depot or a Lowe’s. The only real question I have is whether His
wrath will place me in plumbing supply, home décor, or flooring.
I’m not the handyman type. Even the words “home renovation” are enough to
send shivers up my spine. The last thing I built out of metal or wood — a car-
shaped napkin holder — was in shop class at Lincoln Orens Junior High
School. I brought the thing home to my mother, and she said, “Oh, Russell,
um, what a lovely birdhouse.”
And yet, despite my failed relationship with power tools, there is one kind of
construction that I absolutely love: portfolio construction.
I enjoy crafting portfolios not only because it involves multicolored pie charts
(I’ve always had a soft spot for multicolored pie charts) but because the
process involves so much more than running a piece of wood through a jigsaw
and hoping not to lose any fingers. Portfolio construction is — or should be —
a highly individualized, creative exercise that takes into consideration many
factors: economics, history, statistics, and psychology among them.
The ideal portfolio (if such a thing exists) for a 30-year-old who makes
$70,000 a year is very different from the portfolio of a 75-year-old who makes
$30,000 a year. The optimal portfolio for a 40-year-old worrywart differs from
the optimal portfolio for a 40-year-old devil-may-care type. The portfolio-of-
dreams following a three-year bear market may look a wee bit different than a
prime portfolio following a ten-year bull run.

Every financial professional I know goes about portfolio construction in a
somewhat different way. In this chapter, I walk you through the steps that I
take and that have worked well for me. I don’t mean to present my way as the
only way, so I also mention an alternative strategy (see the sidebar “Dividing
up the pie either conservatively or aggressively by industry sector”).
Needless to say (since this is, after all, a book about exchange-traded funds),
my primary construction materials are ETFs, as I believe they should be for
most, but not all, investors. My building tools involve some sophisticated
Morningstar software, my HP 12C financial calculator, a premise called
Modern Portfolio Theory, a statistical phenomenon called reversion to the
mean, and various measures of risk and return. But rest assured that this
isn’t brain surgery, or even elbow surgery. You can be a pretty good portfolio
builder yourself by the time you finish this chapter.
So please follow along. I promise you that nothing you are about to see will
resemble either a napkin holder or a birdhouse!
So, How Much Risk Can You Handle
and Still Sleep at Night?
The first question I ask myself — and the first question anyone building a
portfolio should ask — is this: How much volatility can the portfolio-holder
stomach? So few things in the world of investments are sure bets. One thing is
a sure bet: The amount of risk you take or don’t take will have a great bearing
on your long-term return. You simply are not going to get rich investing in
bank CDs. On the other hand, you aren’t going to lose your nest egg in a
single week, either. The same cannot be said of a tech stock — or even a bevy
of tech stocks wrapped up in an ETF.
A well-built ETF portfolio can help to mitigate risks, not eliminate them.
Please forget the dumb old rules about portfolio building and risk. How much
risk you can or should handle depends on your wealth, your age, your
income, your health, your financial responsibilities, your potential inheri-
tances, and whether you’re the kind of person who tosses and turns over
life’s upsets. If anyone gives you a pat formula — “Take your age, subtract it
from 100, and that, dear friend, is how much you should have in stocks” —
run away! It isn’t nearly that simple.
220
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

A few things that just don’t matter
Before I lay out what matters most in determining appropriate risk and
appropriate allocations to stocks, bonds, and cash (or stock ETFs and bond
ETFs), I want to throw out just a few things that really shouldn’t play into your
decision, even though they play into many people’s portfolio decisions:
 The portfolio of your best friend, which has done great guns.
 Your personal feelings on the state of the economy, the current adminis-
tration, where the Fed stands on the prime interest rate, and exchanges
rates between the dollar, the Euro, and the yen.
 The article you clipped out of Lotsa Dough magazine that tells you that
you can earn 50 percent a year by investing in . . . whatever.
Listen: Your best friend may be in a completely different economic place than
you are. His well-polished ETF portfolio, laid out by a first-rate financial plan-
ner, may be just perfect for him and all wrong for you.
As far as the state of the nation and where the Dow is headed, you simply
don’t know. Neither do I. The talking heads on TV pretend to know, but they
don’t know squat. Nor does the author of that article in the glossy magazine
(filled with ads from mutual fund companies) that tells you how you can get
rich quickly in the markets. The secrets to financial success cannot be had by
forking over $3.50 for a magazine.
(Whenever I read some prognosticator suggesting a handful of stocks or
mutual funds for the coming year, I Google his name to see what projections
he made a year prior. Then I check to see how his picks have done. You
should do the same! Inevitably, my dog Norman, the killer poodle, could do a
better job picking stocks.)
The stock market over the course of the past century has returned about 10
percent nominally (7 percent or so after inflation). Bonds have returned
about half as much. A well-diversified portfolio, by historical standards, has
returned something in between stocks and bonds — maybe 7 to 8 percent (4
to 5 percent after inflation). With some of the advice in this book, you should
be able to do that, and maybe even a wee bit better. But don’t take inordinate
risk with any sizeable chunk of your portfolio in the hope that you are going
to earn 50 percent a year after inflation — or even before inflation. It won’t
happen.
On the other hand, don’t pooh-pooh a 7 to 8 percent return. Compound inter-
est is a truly miraculous thing. Invest $20,000 today, add $2,000 each year,
and within 20 years, with “only” a 7.5 percent return, you’ll have $171,566. (If
inflation is running in the 3 percent ballpark, that $171,566 will be worth
about $110,000 in today’s dollars.)
221
Chapter 16: Sample ETF Portfolio Menus

The irony of risk and return
In a few pages, I provide you with some sample portfolios appropriate for
someone who should be taking minimal risk as opposed to someone who
should be taking more risk. At this point, I want to digress for a moment to
say that in a perfect world, those who need to take the most risk would be
the most able to take it. In the real world, sometimes sadly ironic, those who
need to take the most risk really can’t afford to.
Specifically, a poor person needs whatever financial cushion he has. He can’t
afford to risk the farm on emerging market or high tech ETFs. A rich person
has plenty of financial cushion and can take out a chunk of discretionary
money to invest in emerging market stocks and high tech ETFs, but he really
doesn’t need to because he’s living comfortably and can do without the
potential high return. It just isn’t fair. Yet no one is to blame, and nothing can
be done about it. It is what it is.
Let’s move on.
The 20x rule
Whatever your age, whatever your station in life, you probably wouldn’t
object if your investments could support you. How much do you need to
have your investments support you? That’s actually not very complicated
and has been very well studied: You need about 20 times your annual
expenses to live off your investments and not have the principal start to 
disappear.
That is, if you need $30,000 a year to live — in addition to Social Security and
any other income — you should ideally have $600,000 in your portfolio when
you retire. You can have less, but you’ll have to eat into principal. Eating into
principal may be perfectly appropriate, especially after a certain age, but to
play it safe, I’d like for you to at least aim to retire with 20 times your annual
expenses in your portfolio.
(Factor in the value or partial value of your home only if it is paid up and if
you foresee a day when you can downsize.)
If you are still far away from that 20x landmark, and you are not in debt, and
your income is secure, and you have enough cash to live on for six months,
then with the rest of your loot, you should probably err toward the riskier
ETF portfolio (mostly stock ETFs). You need the return.
If you have your 20 times annual expenses already locked up or are close to
it, you should probably err toward a less risky ETF portfolio (more bond
ETFs). After all, you have more to lose than you have to gain. (See the sidebar
222
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

“Russell’s ‘today and tomorrow’ portfolio modeling technique” for my sugges-
tion on how you should have not one, but two portfolio models: one for right
now, and one for the future.) You do need to be careful, however, that your
investments keep up with inflation. Savings accounts are unlikely to do that.
If you have way more than 20 times annual expenses, congratulations! You
have many options, and how much risk you take will be a decision external to
any material needs. You may, for example, want to leave behind a grand
legacy, in which case you may want to shoot for higher returns. Or you may
not care what you leave behind, in which case leaving your money in a tired
savings account wouldn’t make much difference.
Other risk/return considerations
I doubt I can list everything you should consider when determining the
proper amount of risk to take with your investments, but here are a few addi-
tional things to keep in mind:
 What is your safety net? If worse came to worst, do you have family or
friends who would help you if you got in a real financial bind? If the
answer is yes, you can add a tablespoon of risk.
 What is your family health history? Do you lead a healthy lifestyle?
These are the two greatest predictors of your longevity. If Mom and Dad
lived to 100, and you don’t smoke and you do eat your vegetables, you
may be looking at a long retirement. Add a dollop of risk — you’ll need
the return.
 How secure is your job? The less secure your employment, the more
you should keep in nonvolatile investments (like short-term bonds or
bond funds); you may need to pull from them if you get the pink slip
next Friday afternoon.
 Can you downsize? Say you are close to retirement, and you live in a
McMansion. If you think that sooner or later (sooner, if necessary) you
can sell the McMansion and buy a smaller place, you have some finan-
cial cushion. You can afford to take a bit more risk.
Why not just fill out an online 
risk questionnaire?
Yes, I give my clients a risk questionnaire. And then I go through it with them
to help them interpret their answers. Lots of Web sites offer investment risk
questionnaires, but instead of having anyone interpret the answers, a com-
puter just spits out a few numbers: You should invest x in stock and y in
bonds. Yikes!
223
Chapter 16: Sample ETF Portfolio Menus

Please, please, don’t allow a computer-generated questionnaire to determine
your financial future! I’ve tried dozens of them, and the answers are consis-
tently wacky!
For example: One of the questions that appears on nearly all the Web ques-
tionnaires is this: Please rate your previous investment experience and level of
satisfaction with the following six asset classes. And then they list money
market funds, bonds, stocks, and so on.
I had a client named Jason who was a 30-year-old with a solid job and no kids.
After taking an online questionnaire, he was told he should be nearly all in
money market accounts and bonds based on his previous “very low” satisfac-
tion with stocks and stock mutual funds. This young man definitely should
not invest in any foreign stocks or bonds, the computer-generated program
told him, because of his “very low” satisfaction with foreign funds he had
invested in previously.
Oh, jeesh. The reason Jason had “very low” satisfaction with stocks and for-
eign funds is because in 2004, he got snookered by some stock broker
(posing as a “financial planner”) into buying a handful of full load, high
expense ratio, actively managed mutual funds that (predictably) lost him
money. That experience should have no bearing on the development of this
young man’s portfolio, which should have the lion’s share in stock ETFs or
mutual funds.
What I’m saying is that after reading this book, if you aren’t too certain where
you belong on the risk/return continuum, perhaps you should hire an experi-
enced and impartial financial advisor — if only for a couple of hours — to
review your portfolio with you. I write more about seeking professional help
in Chapter 20.
Keys to Optimal Investing
When you have a rough idea of where you should be riskwise, your attention
should turn next to fun matters such as Modern Portfolio Theory, reversion
to the mean, cost minimization, and tax efficiency. Please allow me to explain.
Incorporating Modern Portfolio Theory 
into your investment decisions
The subject I’m about to discuss is a theory much in the same way evolution
is a theory: The people who don’t believe it are those who decide to disre-
gard all the science. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) says that if you diversify
224
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

your portfolio — putting all kinds of eggs into all kinds of baskets — you
reduce risk and optimize return.
You get the most bang for your buck, according to MPT, when you mix and
match investments that have little correlation. In other words, if you build
your portfolio with different ETFs that tend to do well (and not so well) in dif-
ferent kinds of markets, you’ll have a lean and mean portfolio.
Lately, MPT has been the source of a lot of controversy. It hasn’t been 
working as well as it did in the past. At times in the past few years, there have
been stretches of days, even weeks and months, when different asset classes —
U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate — have all
moved up and down nearly in lockstep.
While correlations can change over history — and lately the major asset
classes have shown alarmingly high rates of correlation — you shouldn’t
simply scrap the idea that diversification and the quest for noncorrelation
are crucial. However, you may want to be cautious of too much reliance on
diversification. Yes, you can diversify away much risk. But you should also
have certain low-risk investments in your portfolio, investments that hold
their own in any kind of market. Low-risk investments include money market
funds, short- and intermediate-term high quality bonds (especially Treasury
bonds), and bank CDs.
Maximizing the importance 
of cost minimization
ETFs are cheap, which is one of the things I love about them. The difference
between a typical mutual fund that charges 1.6 percent and a typical ETF that
charges 0.2 percent adds up to a lot of money over time. One of my favorite
financial Web sites, www.moneychimp.com, offers a fund-cost calculator.
Invest $100,000 for 20 years at 8 percent and deduct 0.2 for expenses; you’re
left with $449,133. Deduct 1.6 percent, and you’re left with $345,806. That’s a
difference of over $100,000.
Because the vast majority of ETFs fall into the super-cheap to cheap range
(generally 0.1 to 0.6 percent), the differences won’t be quite so huge. Still, in
picking and choosing ETFs, cost should always be a factor.
Of course, with ETFs, you pay a small trading fee every time you buy and sell.
That too should be examined and minimized. Do all your trades online, and
choose a brokerage house that gives you the best deal. If you’re going to
make frequent buys and sells, perhaps ETFs aren’t for you; rather, you should
build your portfolio with mostly low cost, no-load index funds.
225
Chapter 16: Sample ETF Portfolio Menus

Striving for tax efficiency
Keeping your investment dollars in your pocket and not lining Uncle Sam’s is
one big reason to choose ETFs over mutual funds. ETFs are, by and large,
much more tax efficient than mutual funds. But some ETFs are going to be
more tax efficient than others. I cover this issue in-depth in Chapter 19 where
I talk about tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as Roth IRAs.
For now, let me say that you must choose wisely which ETFs get put into
which baskets. In general, high dividend and interest paying ETFs (REIT ETFs,
bond ETFs) belong in tax-advantaged accounts.
Timing your investments (modestly 
and conservatively)
If you’ve read much of this book already, by now you realize that I’m largely
an efficient market kind of guy. I believe that the ups and downs of the stock
and bond market — and of any individual security — are, in absence of true
inside information, unpredictable. (And trading on true inside information is
illegal.) For that reason, I prefer indexed ETFs and mutual funds over actively
managed funds.
That being said, however . . .
I also believe in something called reversion to the mean. This is a statistical
phenomenon that colloquially translates to the following: What goes up must
come down; what goes waaaay up, you need to be careful about investing too
much money in.
At the time I’m writing this, for example, energy stocks, commodities, and
small international stocks have been flying high for years. As far as all three
of these kinds of stocks are concerned, I like them. I think they can be won-
derful diversifiers. But I’m holding back, keeping my exposure to these asset
classes a bit in check.
I’m not suggesting that you go out and buy any ETF that has underperformed
the market for years, or sell any ETF that has outperformed. But to a small
degree, you should factor in reversion to the mean when constructing a 
portfolio.
226
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

For example, say you decide that your $100,000 portfolio should include
$15,000 of the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), and large growth stocks
have for years seriously underperformed large value, small stocks, and just
about every other asset class. You may want to allocate, say, $16,000 or per-
haps as much as $17,000 to IVW. If you would normally invest $10,000 in the
Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), and that ETF has outperformed the broad
market by leaps and bounds for the past several years, you may wish to allo-
cate, say, only $9,000.
Please don’t go overboard. I’m suggesting that you use reversion to the mean
to very gently tweak your portfolio percentages — not ignore them!
Finding the Perfect Portfolio Fit
Time now to peek into my private world, as I reveal some of the ETF-based
portfolios I’ve worked out for clients over the years. You should look for the
client that you most resemble, and that example will give you some rough
idea of the kind of advice I would give you if you were a client. All names, 
of course, have been changed to protect privacy. For the sake of brevity, I
provide you with only a thumbnail sketch of each of my client’s financial 
situations.
Considering the simplest of the simple
Before I get into anything complicated or present any real client portfolios, I
want to introduce an easier-than-easy ETF portfolio. What I’ve constructed is
a perfectly fine, workable investment model with decent (although not great)
diversification. It may be enough for anyone with limited funds (say $30,000
to $50,000), but funds they are willing to plunk down and leave put. (For less
than $30,000, or for a portfolio that is likely to see a good amount of buying
or selling, an entire ETF portfolio probably isn’t going to make sense because
the trading costs will gobble up too much.)
I’ve thrown in (in order of appearance) large cap stocks, small cap stocks,
international stocks (EAFA stands for Europe, Australia, and Far East index),
and bonds.
This portfolio can be tailored to suit the aggressive investor who can deal
with some serious ups and downs in the hopes of high long-term returns, the
conservative investor who can’t stand to lose too much money, or the
middle-of-the-road investor. Keep in mind that you should always have three
227

to six months living expenses in cash or near-cash (money market, short-
term CD, Internet banking account, or very short-term high-quality bond
fund). You should also have all your credit card and other high-interest debt
paid up. The rest of your money is what you may invest.

Racing toward riches: A portfolio that 
may require a crash helmet
High-risk/high-return ETF portfolios are made up mostly of stock ETFs. After
all, stocks have a very long history of clobbering most other investments — if
you give them enough time. A high risk/high return portfolio should have a
good percentage of small cap stocks and a good chunk of international,
including emerging markets. If the portfolio is diversified into industry sec-
tors (an acceptable strategy, as I discuss in Chapter 9), a high risk/high
return strategy would emphasize fast-growing sectors, such as technology
and healthcare.
Let’s consider the case of Jason, a single, 30-year-old pharmaceutical sales-
man. Jason came to me after getting burned badly by several high cost, load
mutual funds that performed miserably over the years. Still, given his steady
income of $90,000 and his minimal living expenses (he rents a one-bedroom
apartment in Allentown, PA), Jason has managed to sock away $165,000. His
job is secure. He has good disability insurance. He anticipates saving $20,000
to $30,000 a year over the next several years. He enjoys his work and intends
to work till normal retirement age. He plans to buy a new car (ballpark
$30,000) in the next few months but otherwise has no major expenditures
earmarked.
228
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Jason can clearly take some risk. Following is the ETF-based portfolio that I
designed for him, which is represented in Figure 16-1. Note that I had Jason
put four to six months emergency money, plus the $30,000 for the car, into a
money market account, and that amount is not factored into this portfolio.
Also note that although this portfolio is mostly made up of ETFs, I do include
a few no-load mutual funds to gain access to asset classes not yet repre-
sented by ETFs. These are the Fidelity International Small Cap Opportunities
Fund (FSCOX) and the Vanguard High-Yield Tax-Exempt bond fund (VWAHX),
which makes particular sense for Jason because he is currently earning a
high income and has no appreciable write-offs.

Sticking to the middle of the road
Next, I present Jay and Racquel, who are ages 58 and 54, married, and have
successful careers. Even though they are old enough to be Jason’s parents,
their economic situation actually warrants a quite similar high-risk/high-
return portfolio. Both husband and wife, however, are risk-averse kind of
people.
Jay is an independent businessman with several retail properties (valued at
roughly $1.6 million); Racquel is a vice president at a major publishing house.
Their portfolio: $800,000 and growing. Within several years, the couple will
qualify for combined Social Security benefits of roughly $42,000. Racquel also
will receive a fixed pension annuity of about $30,000. The couple’s goal is to
retire within five to seven years, and they have no dreams of living too lav-
ishly; they should have more than enough money. The fruits of their invest-
ments, by and large, should pass to their three grown children and any
charities named in their wills.
Being risk-averse, Jay and Racquel keep 30 percent of their portfolio in high-
quality municipal bonds. They handed me the other 70 percent ($560,000)
and told me to invest it as I saw fit. My feeling was that 30 percent high-quality
bonds was probably overkill in terms of safety, so I saw no need to add to
their bond position. I therefore constructed a portfolio of largely domestic
and foreign stock ETFs. The size of their portfolio, versus Jason’s, warranted
the addition of a few more asset classes, such as international Real Estate
Investment Trusts (REITs), an alternative energy fund (PowerShares
WilderHill Clean Energy), a couple of market-neutral mutual funds (Hussman,
Merger), and holdings in two large timber REITs. At the couple’s request, I
also invested a small amount in two commodity ETFs.
I did not include any U.S. REITs other than the timber REITs, given that so
much of the couple’s wealth is already tied up in commercial real estate.
Figure 16-2 represents the portfolio breakdown, which I detail here.

Russell’s “today and tomorrow” 
portfolio modeling technique
Career coaches constantly tout the importance
of having a career plan; I’m going to tout the
importance of having a portfolio plan. Times
change; circumstances change. Your portfolio
needs to keep up with the times. Suppose you
are 45 years old and saving for retirement. Using
the 20x rule I discuss in this chapter, you decide
that your goal is to someday have a portfolio of
$1.2 million. Your current portfolio has $600,000,
so you have a ways to go. To get where you
want, you realize you need to take some risk,
but when you start to approach your goal, you
want to lower your risk. After all, at that point,
you’ll have more to lose than gain with any
market swings. You should model your portfolio
today but also have a picture of what your port-
folio may look like when you reach, say, $1.0 mil-
lion . . . whenever that is.
Your picture may look something like this:

your picture of what it may look like tomorrow,
you’ll always know where you’re heading. Trust
me, it makes sense. Or trust Yogi Berra, who

may wind up someplace else.”

Taking the safer road: 
Less oomph, less swing
We financial professional types hate to admit it, but no matter how much we
tinker with our investment strategies, no matter how fancy our portfolio soft-
ware, we can’t entirely remove the luck factor. When you invest in anything,
there’s always a bit of a gamble. (Keep all your money in cash, stuffed under
the proverbial mattress, and you’re gambling that inflation won’t eat it away
or that a house fire won’t consume it.) As such, sometimes the greatest
investment advice ever given probably comes from Kenny Rogers:
You got to know when to hold ’em, know when to fold ’em
Know when to walk away and know when to run.
The time to hold ’em is when you have just enough — when you’ve pretty
much met, or have come close to meeting, your financial goals.
I now present Richard and Maria, who are 65 and 58, married, and nearing
retirement. Richard, who sank in his chair when I asked about his employment,
233
Chapter 16: Sample ETF Portfolio Menus

told me that he was in a job he detests in the ever-changing (and not neces-
sarily changing for the better) newspaper business. Maria was doing part-
time public relations work. I added up Richard’s Social Security, a small
pension from the newspaper, Maria’s part-time income, and income from
their investments, and I told Richard that he didn’t have to stay at a job he
hates. There was enough money for him to retire, provided the couple agreed
to live somewhat frugally, and provided the investments — $700,000 — could
keep up with inflation and not sag too badly in the next bear market.
For a couple like Richard and Maria, portfolio construction is a tricky matter.
Go too conservative, and the couple may run out of money before they die.
Go too aggressive, and the couple may run out of money tomorrow. It’s a deli-
cate balancing act. In this case, I took Richard and Maria’s $700,000 and
appropriated 25 percent — $175,500 — to a Vanguard immediate fixed annu-
ity, inflation adjusted. (The annuity was put in Richard’s name, with 50 per-
cent joint survivorship for Maria.) The rest of the money — $525,000 — I
allocated to a portfolio of largely ETFs. Figure 16-3 illustrates the portfolio
breakdown, which I detail here.

Dividing up the pie either conservatively or
aggressively by industry sector
In Chapter 9, I talk about sector investing
(investing by industry sector), as opposed to
grid
investing (splitting your equity into
large/small/value/growth). If you want to use
sector investing (I have no major problem with
that), know that various sectors fall in different
places on the risk/return continuum.
According to the people at State Street Global
Advisors (SSgA), purveyors of Select Sector
SPDR ETFs, with the help of Ibbotson

the most appropriate for the U.S. equity piece of
your portfolio.

N
ow, dear reader, we get to the part of this book you’ve been waiting for:
How to get rich quick using ETFs! The trick is understanding charting
patterns.
Let me explain what I mean.
The chart in Figure 17-1 captures a hypothetical daily pricing pattern for a
hypothetical ETF that we will hypothetically give the hypothetical ticker
symbol UGH. What you see at point A is a major reversal pattern known to
technical analysts as the “Head-and-Shoulders.” Notice that as the price dips
below the “Neckline” and then rises with simultaneous “Increased Volume”
that the “Reversal” of the “Trend” begins to manifest. Time to sell! Within a
short time, however, as you can clearly see at point B, a “Minor Top” forms
indicating an “Upward Trend” reinforced by the classic “Inverted Triangle.”
Time to buy! Two minutes later, at point C, where volume increases and the
price again rises a point, we see a “Breakaway Gap.” Time to sell again!

In the next chart (see Figure 17-2), we examine the daily pricing patterns of a
hypothetical ETF that we will hypothetically call DUM. You can make millions
overnight if you truly understand this charting pattern!

Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Unless you are totally humor challenged, by now you see that I’m not being
entirely serious. Many, if not most, day-traders (who tend to love ETFs)
believe in something called technical analysis: the use of charts and graphs to
predict movements in securities. Much of the language I used to explain
Figure 17-1, as well as the basic idea behind the charts, comes from a best-
selling book on technical analysis.
I once had the honor of interviewing one of the biggest names in technical
analysis. This guy writes books, gives seminars, and tells everyone that he
makes oodles and oodles of money by following charting patterns and buying
and selling securities accordingly. At the time I interviewed him, I had been a
journalist for 20 years, writing for many of the top U.S. magazines, covering
many topics. If you develop one thing being a journalist for two decades, it is
a very well-honed bullshit radar. I can tell you after spending an hour on the
phone with this “expert” that he is perhaps making of oodles and oodles of
money with his books and seminars, but he is not making oodles and oodles
of money with his charts. And neither will you.
The key to success in investing isn’t to do a lot of trading based on formulas
every bit as fruitless as alchemy. The key is to keep your investment costs
low (ETFs will do that for you), diversify your portfolio (ETFs can do that,
too), and buy and hold (that part’s up to you).
In this chapter, I present the evidence to back up my contention that buying
and holding is the thing to do. You will see that buyers and holders are the
true champions of the investing world. And you will discover the difference
between hypothetical investing and investing in the real world.
It’s huge.
The Tale of the Average Investor 
(A Tragicomedy in One Act)
I talk a bit in this book about correlation, the tendency for two things (such as
two ETFs or other investments) to move in the same direction. A correlation
of 1.0 indicates a perfect correlation: think Lucille Ball in the mirror imitating
Harpo Marx. Another perfect correlation is the correlation between stock
prices and the public’s willingness to purchase those stocks. 
For some strange reason, the market for stocks (and stock funds, such as
ETFs) does not work the same way as, say, the market for cars or refrigera-
tors. With most products, if the sellers drop the price, the public is likely to
increase consumption. With stocks and stock funds, when the price rises, the
public increases consumption.
239
Chapter 17: Buying and Holding: The Key to ETF Investment Success

For example, after tech stocks had their fabulous run in the 1990s, only then —
in the latter part of the decade — did money start pouring into tech stocks.
As soon as the bubble burst and tech stocks were selling cheaper than tar-
nished dirt, people were selling right and left, and no one was buying.
Today, everyone is rushing into small international stocks, commodities, and
emerging market stocks. As soon as the bubble bursts, well, it’ll be red tag
sale day once again.
Returns that fall way short of the indexes
One 2003 study by the investment research group Dalbar found that the aver-
age stock mutual fund investor between January 1984 and December 2002
earned just 2.57 percent annually — not even keeping up with inflation.
During that same timeframe, the S&P 500 enjoyed an average annual return of
12.22 percent. During the very same period, bond fund investors earned a 4.2
percent annualized return, lagging well behind the 5.5 percent annualized
gain for Treasury bills.
How to explain such lackluster returns? In part, the culprit is the average
investor’s inclination to invest in pricey and poor-performing mutual funds.
Another problem is that the average investor jumps ship too often, con-
stantly buying when the market is hot, selling when it chills, and hopping
back on board when the market heats up again. He is forever buying high and
selling low.
ETFs solve the first part of the problem. They are not pricey. They are not
going to underperform the indexes because they by and large mirror the
indexes. As for the second problem, however, the jumping in and out of the
market, I fear that ETFs can actually exacerbate the problem.
ETFs can make failure even easier!
ETFs were first brought to light by marketing people from the Toronto Stock
Exchange who saw a way to beef up trading volume. Unlike mutual funds,
which can be bought and sold only at day’s end, ETFs trade throughout the
day. In a flash, you can plunk a million in the stock market. A few seconds
later, you can sell it all.
Yipeee!
240
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

In other words, the next time Dalbar does a 20-year return study, after ETFs
have really caught on with the average investor, I fear that their findings may
be even more dismal. Remember: Just because ETFs can be traded through-
out the day doesn’t mean you have to or that you should!
The vast majority of ETF trades are done by institutional investors: managers
of mutual funds and multibillion-dollar endowments and pension funds.
These are highly trained, incredibly well-paid professionals who do nothing
all day but study the markets. When you go to buy, say, the ETF QQQQ (rep-
resenting the top 100 stocks that trade on the NASDAQ), you are betting that
the price is going to go up. If you are day-trading, you are betting that the
price will go up that day. If you are selling, you are betting the price will fall
that day. Someone, most likely a highly educated financial professional, is on
the other end of your transaction. As you sell, he is buying. Or, as you buy, he
is selling. Obviously his vision of the next few hours is different than yours.
Let me ask you a question: What makes you think you are smarter than he is?
Obviously, lots of ETF traders think they are pretty smart, because ETFs are
among the most frequently traded of all securities — see the sidebar “The ten
ETFs that day-traders love the most.” Also see the sidebar “An author’s con-
fession (and a few rules if you are going to day-trade)” for an inside view into
a repentant day-trader’s mind.
The lure of quick riches
If you jump onto the Internet, as I just did, and type in the words “Market
timing success,” you will see all kinds of Web sites and newsletters offering
you all kinds of advice (much of it having to do with reading charts) sure to
make you rich. Add the initials “ETF” to your search, and you’ll quickly see
that an entire cottage industry has formed to sell advice to wannabe ETF 
day-traders.
According to these Web sites and newsletters, following their advice has
yielded phenomenal returns in the past. (They’ll give you specific BIG num-
bers.) And following their advice in the future (after you’ve paid your hefty
subscription price) will likewise yield phenomenal returns.
If you’re wondering, by the way, who regulates investment Web sites and
newsletters and the performance figures they publish, wonder no more. No
one does. The U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1985 that, just as long as a
newsletter is providing general and not personal advice, the publisher is pro-
tected by First Amendment rights.
241
Chapter 17: Buying and Holding: The Key to ETF Investment Success

John Rekenthaler, a VP at Morningstar, once told me (and I love how he put
this): “Investment newsletter publishers have the same rights as tabloid pub-
lishers. There’s nothing illegal about a headline that reads ‘Martian Baby
Born with Three Heads!’ and there’s nothing illegal about a headline that
reads ‘We Beat the Market Year In and Year Out!’” Both should be read with
equal skepticism.
The Value Line Paradox
Perhaps the most popular purveyor of market-timing and stock-picking
advice — though not the worst offender, by far — is Value Line. It’s a house-
hold name. Not only are the Value Line people now offering advice on picking
ETFs as well as stocks, one ETF — the PowerShares Value Line Timeliness
Selection (PIV) — actually mirrors the advice given by the famed Value Line
newsletter. Although the PowerShares folks don’t exactly call the ETF
“actively managed,” that’s pretty much what it is.
Don’t jump to buy PIV.
Some things — Robert E. Lee’s march into Pennsylvania, the Titanic — look
fabulous on paper but, when translated into reality, reveal some rather
tremendous flaws.
Paper versus practice
Using a proprietary system more secretly guarded than the recipe for Coke,
the Value Line newsletter’s performance track record has been nothing short
of eye popping. On paper, at least.
From the Value Line Web site:
A stock portfolio of #1 Ranked stocks for Timeliness from The Value Line
Investment Survey, beginning in 1965 and updated at the beginning of
each year, would have shown a gain of 19,715% through December 31,
2004. This gain would have beaten the S&P 500 by more than 15 to 1 for
the same time span.
These are numbers to kill your mother for, but just how accurately do they
reflect the return of real investors in the real world who subscribed to Value
Line and put the newsletter’s advice into action?
242
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Ah, there’s the rub.
As I scroll further down Value Line’s Web site, I see that the company offers
not only the newsletter but a few mutual funds — ergo real investors in the
real world. The flagship Value Line mutual fund (VLIFX), which, according to its
prospectus, taps into the very same wisdom that guides the newsletter, has not
exactly set the world on fire. The fund has beaten the S&P 500 only two out of
the last ten years. According to Morningstar Principia, the fund’s ten-year
annual return as of May 30, 2006 was 5.96, compared to 8.94 for the S&P. Going
back 15 years, the fund’s return was an annual average of 9.09 compared to
10.90 for the market. Not only would you have earned lackluster returns, but
VLIFX’s volatility was substantially greater than that of the S&P 500!
The lesson to be learned
How can the mutual fund that tracks the allegedly super-successful newslet-
ter be such a flaming dud? There are a number of possible explanations. One
is that the return numbers given by Value Line are a bit, um, off. (In fact, inde-
pendent research has come up with far, far lower return figures.) Or perhaps
the managers of the mutual fund can’t follow the advice given in their own
newsletter. Perhaps trading costs ate up all profits — and then some.
Whatever the explanation, I don’t see why the new Value Line ETF should do
much better over time than has the long-lived mutual fund.
But my point in sharing the Value Line paradox isn’t so much to steer you
away from any single ETF. My point is to steer you away from thinking you
can trade in and out of ETFs, stocks, bonds, or anything else successfully. It’s
not nearly as easy as many people (such as the Value Line editors) make it
seem.

“Investment Pornography” in Your
Mailbox (and Mine)
Investment Web sites and newsletters are part of a phenomenon that finan-
cial journalist Jane Bryant Quinn once called “investment pornography.”
Many newsletters, magazines, newspaper columns, books, and television
shows exist to titillate and tease you with the promise of riches. Achieving
those riches with ETFs is only the latest gimmick.
On the day I am writing this chapter, a glossy consumer finance magazine just
arrived in the mail. I have it sitting in front of me at this moment. An attrac-
tive woman is walking along the beach. She holds a purse in her hand. (Why
is she carrying a purse on the beach?) I am told by the caption under her left
foot that the attractive woman earned 40 percent return in one year.
I turn to page 65 of the magazine, and there she is: a single woman! She
earned her 40 percent by investing (“on the advice of a friend”) in the Hodges
mid cap mutual fund. Mid caps have happened to kick ass in the past 12
months. What the article doesn’t tell you is that the Hodges fund has an
expense ratio of 2.0 percent and — no big surprise here — a ten-year return
that trails the S&P MidCap 400 Index by almost 2.0 percent.
Welcome to the wild, wacky 
world of investment advice
In 1999, a very popular book entitled Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for
Profiting from the Coming Rise in the Stock Market gave readers 300 pages of
in-depth explanation why the Dow Jones Industrial average, at that time
riding around 10,000, was destined to more than triple in value. “The case is
compelling that 36,000 is a fair value for the Dow today. And stocks should
rise to such heights very quickly,” wrote James K. Glassman and co-author
Kevin A. Hassett. Of course, as soon as the book came out, advising people to
pour money into stocks, the Dow proceeded to tumble to less than 8,000 over
a three-year bear market.
Where do you suppose that James K. Glassman is today? Why, he’s writing an
investment advice column, of course.
Before Glassman, there were the Beardstown Ladies. In 1983, 16 women in
Beardstown, Illinois, started an investment club. In 1994, claiming a 23.4 per-
cent annualized ten-year return, they wrote a book called The Beardstown
244
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Ladies’ Common-Sense Investment Guide. It became a huge bestseller. Oops. It
turns out, upon further inspection, that the Beardstown Ladies overstated
their returns. Their actual return was 9.1 percent a year, considerably less
than the stock market.
What happened to the good Ladies of Beardstown? Why, they went on to
write five more investment books, of course.
E caveat emptor: ETF-trading 
Web sites for suckers
I share investment horror stories so you don’t wind up a player in any future
ones. One way to make sure you don’t is to be on the lookout for ridiculous
claims. Market timing services are popping up all over the Internet. Why not?
ETFs are hot. They are in the news. They sound so impressive. And there is a
sucker born every minute.
Please, please, don’t fork over your money assuming that you’re going to get
the secrets to instant wealth by trading ETFs. It won’t happen.
Following are just a few examples of the countless Web sites hoping to lure
you in with big promises. I can’t possibly list them all, so be wary:

also reviewed and the final result, when employing the complete set of
revised rules, was an astonishingly smooth and linear curve representing
some 100-fold compounding of an investment made in August 2000.
Russell says: Such impressive big words! My favorite word is “hopefully.”
Indeed.
Patience Pays
The flip side of flipping ETFs is buying and holding them, which is almost
guaranteed, in the long run, to bring results far superior to market timing. It’s
the corollary to choosing ETFs over stocks. Study after study shows that the
markets are by and large very efficient. What does that mean? So many smart
players are constantly buying and selling securities, always on the lookout
for any good deals, that your chances of beating the indexes, whether by
market timing or stock picking, are very slim.
One of the more recent studies on the subject, “The Difficulty of Selecting
Superior Mutual Fund Performance” by Thomas P. McGuigan, appeared in the
February 2006 issue of Journal of Financial Planning. McGuigan found that
only 10 to 11 percent of actively managed mutual funds outperform index
funds over a 20-year period. (Active managers are professionals who try to
pick stocks and time the market.)
246
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

We can probably safely assume that the professionals do better than the ama-
teurs, and even the professionals fail to beat the market over 90 percent of
the time!
Talk about unpredictability
Timing doesn’t work because markets are largely random. The unpredictabil-
ity in the stock market (or bond market) never ceases to amaze me. Just
when things seem certain to take off, they sink. Just when things seem cer-
tain to sink, they fly.
I recently had a client, a 52-year-old allergist in Allentown, PA, who read up on
avian flu and became so concerned with what a pandemic might do to the
stock market that he urged me to take his $500,000 portfolio and put every-
thing in cash. We set up a meeting in his office, and I was able to temper his
desire to cash out. (However, we did move his portfolio to a somewhat more
conservative position.)
Prior to our meeting, I sent the client the following e-mail, which I would like
to share with you:
Dear Tom,
Since your initial e-mail on this topic, I’ve done a fair amount of reading,
and you have reason, for sure, to be concerned. I am, too. (Author’s note: I
was being truthful here, although my concern is more a health concern
than a financial one.)
Holding some cash and gold wouldn’t be a bad idea. (If we had a real
economic crisis, you would want small gold coins . . . 1/10 ounce.)
But don’t assume that pandemics, or any other crisis, necessarily result in
stock market crashes.
Keep in mind that 1918, the year of the worst pandemic in world history,
was a good year for stocks: http://www.econ.yale.edu/
~shiller/data/chapt26.html.
1962 (Cuban Missile Crisis) was a very good year. 1942 (Japan attacked
Pearl Harbor; Hitler marched across Europe) wasn’t too bad, either.
In contrast, let’s look at the worst years of the stock market. In 1929, nothing
catastrophic was going on. Ditto for 1987. Ditto for 2000.
I can’t explain the incredible unpredictability of the markets. I can only
share these historical truths.
Yours,
Russell

A short history of the market’s resiliency
The Dow fell 200 points today. Nearly all my ETFs lost money. Some of the
more volatile ones, such as the iShares Russell Microcap Index (IWC), lost a
bundle. Am I happy? No, of course not. Am I panicking? Nope.
The Dow is now at roughly 11,000, so a 200-point fall represents a loss of
about 1.8 percent. Recent history has seen much, much bigger losses, and
somehow, the market keeps coming back.
Remember September 11, 2001? Following the destruction of the World Trade
Center towers, the Dow immediately dropped 7.13 percent. Six months later, the
Dow was up by 10.47 percent. Years prior to that, on September 24, 1955,
President Eisenhower’s heart attack led to a one-day drop of 6.54 percent. Six
months later, the Dow was up 12.48 percent. I could give example after example.
That’s not to say that the market will always come back. One of these days . . .
well, even Rome eventually fell. But history shows that the stock market is a
mighty resilient beast. I suggest that you build a portfolio of ETFs — including
stock and bond ETFs — and hang tight. Sooner or later (barring some truly
major economic upheaval), you will very likely be rewarded.

The author’s confession (and a few rules 
if you are going to day-trade)
Um . . . er . . . I don’t know quite how to say this,
but, despite all my talk in this chapter and
throughout this book about buying and holding,
and the futility of day-trading, yes — YES! YES! —
I’ve done it. I admit it! I’ve bought and sold ETFs
within the same day in the hope of making a
quick gain! I’ve done it with the QQQQ (an ETF
that tracks the NASDAQ) and with EEM (an
emerging markets ETF).
What can I say? Gambling (and that is what
such short-term forays into the market are) can
be fun. Not only that, but the odds of making
money by gambling on an ETF are much greater
than they are by, say, playing the horses or
shooting craps. After all, the “house” takes only
a small cut when you play the markets. And time
is on your side.
Have I made any short-terms gains? Sure. I’ve
also lost some money. On balance, over the
years, I’ve probably just about broken even . . .
or maybe earned ten cents an hour for all my
efforts. But it has been fun!
I am sharing this with you because I know that
some of you are going to occasionally have that
feeling in your gut that you “know” some secu-
rity is going to go up (or down, if you’re into
short selling), and you may take a stab.
Okay, go ahead if you must; I’ll just ask you to
play by a few rules.

249
Chapter 17: Buying and Holding: The Key to ETF Investment Success
Rule #1
Separate investing from gambling; have a fixed
(small) amount of money with which you gamble
on the market. Take it from cash. Don’t sell your
buy-and-hold investments to support your 
gambling.
Rule #2
If you find that you are getting fixated on your
wins or losses, quit. If it isn’t fun, don’t do it. If
you find that you are spending an inordinate
amount of time playing the markets, quit. There
is more to life.
Rule #3
Don’t buy on margin. If you are borrowing
money from the brokerage house to trade, that
could spell big trouble. Margin money usually
costs much more than you think. I hold Fidelity
Investments in high regard, but I really don’t like
their recent full-page magazine advertisements
offering low rates for margin borrowing. If you
read the very small print at the bottom of the page, it
explains that the advertised rate pertains only
to margin loans over $500,000. Small players —
like you and me — pay much more.
Rule #4
Ask yourself what you’re going to do if you get
stuck. Have an exit plan. What if you buy EEM
on an exceptionally volatile day, and you expect
it to rise 3 percent, but instead it falls 4 percent?
Are you going to hold it until it climbs back up?
Are you going to cash out and take the hit?
Rule #5
I doubt that you do, but even if you find that you
have a superhuman ability to time the markets,
ask yourself if that is really what you want to do
for a living. Day-trading isn’t exactly a career
that benefits the community or grows your con-
sciousness. I’ve known a good number of day-
traders; most seem like shallow, unhappy
people.

W
hen I was a kid, long before online banking, I would often pedal my
metallic blue three-speed Schwinn bicycle to one of the local savings
banks on Long Island to deposit my allowance money. In those days, if you
opened a new account, you were often given a free gift: a toaster, clock radio,
leather wallet, crystal candlesticks, or such. This was a great encouragement
to switch banks, and I did so with some regularity.
Today, I don’t generally take my bicycle to the bank. I don’t think they even
make three-speeds anymore. And most neighborhood banks no longer give
away toasters or clock radios. Times change! Still, however, it sometimes
makes sense to switch your investments around.
In the previous chapter, I talk of the virtues of a buy-and-hold approach to
ETF investing. But that doesn’t mean you purchase a bunch of ETFs and
never touch them. Switching from one ETF to another won’t get you a clock
radio or a leather wallet, but there can be other benefits, for sure.
In this chapter, I discuss certain circumstances where it makes sense to trade
ETFs, rather than buy and hold. For example, you need to rebalance your
portfolio on an annual basis to keep risk in check, and on occasion you may
want to swap ETFs to harvest taxes at year end. I also discuss the ways in
which life changes may warrant tweaking a portfolio. And finally, I introduce
you to the world of ETF options, where frequent trading is a way of life.

Rebalancing to Keep Your Portfolio Fit
I have a client whom I’ll call Jonathan. A 55-year-old chemical engineer,
divorced for several years, Jonathan got clobbered during the three-year bear
market of 2000–2002. Part of Jonathan’s problem, and a problem for so many
other investors back at the turn of century, was that he forgot to rebalance.
Jonathan jumped onto the tech-stock gravy train in November 1997 with the
purchase of two high-flying tech mutual funds. He invested $60,000 in each
for a total of $120,000, which, at the time, was about half the balance of his
401(k).
By March 2000, Jonathan’s investment in information technology had grown
from $120,000 to just about $400,000. Meanwhile, the other half of his nest
egg, invested in less glamorous bonds and non-tech stocks, grew from
$120,000 to a mere $130,000 during the same two-and-a-half year span. His
total 401(k) portfolio, by March 2000, was a very handsome $530,000. But
instead of having a portfolio of 50 percent tech stocks, he then had a portfo-
lio of more than three-quarters tech stocks.
In April 2000, the gravy train came to a screeching halt. Jonathan decided to
grit his teeth and hold onto his two mutual funds. By the end of the year, they
lost 45 percent. One year later, by the end of 2001, they had lost another 30
percent. And by the end of 2002, they dropped yet another 38 percent.
Jonathan’s tech stock mutual funds were now worth only $95,480. His entire
portfolio, which had a balance of $240,000 in 1997, was now, five years later,
worth barely over $200,000.
To add insult to injury, both mutual funds experienced heavy turnover, and
even though Jonathan lost a bundle, he still had to pay the IRS a small capital
gains tax. That really hurt.
When I finally met him in 2003, Jonathan needed to see his portfolio grow 265
percent to get back to where it was at its peak.
How rebalancing works
I put Jonathan into a well-diversified portfolio of largely ETFs, and despite a
number of very good years, he’s still not quite back to where he started
before his exciting ride to riches and back.
252
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

What happened to Jonathan can be avoided! How? The answer is fairly
simple: Don’t allow any one slice of your portfolio to overtake the rest.
Periodically pull your portfolio back into balance.
To illustrate, I’ll use a very simple middle-of-the-road ETF portfolio that I
introduce in Chapter 16. At the start of the year, the portfolio is just where
you want it to be: 70 percent diversified stocks, 30 percent bonds. But it turns
out to be a banner year for stocks, and especially for small cap U.S. stocks. At
the end of the year, as you can see in Table 18-1, the portfolio looks quite dif-
ferent than it did at the beginning.

What to do? Bring things back into balance, starting with the bond position.
That’s because the split between stocks and bonds has the greatest impact
on portfolio risk. In this example, you need to increase the bond allocation
from 26 percent back up to 30 percent. If you have a year-end portfolio of
$100,000, that means you’ll buy $4,000 of AGG to bring it up 4 percentage
points.
253
Chapter 18: Exceptions to the Rule (Ain’t There Always)

Where will the $4,000 come from? That depends. You could sell off part of
your stock position, if necessary. Or, you could take the money from your
cash position. Since you must pay a commission to trade an ETF, the fewer
trades you make, the better. Therefore, I prefer to allow the cash position to
build up — either with fresh deposits or with dividends and interest earned —
and use that cash for rebalancing.
How often to rebalance
The question of how often to rebalance has been studied and restudied, and
most financial professionals agree that once a year is a good timeframe.
Anything less, and you increase your risk as positions get out of whack.
Anything more, and you may lower your returns by interrupting rallies too
often.
Ah, but ETFs involve trading costs, and sometimes you may have to weigh
the cost of trading into the rebalancing decision. Tweaking a portfolio by sev-
eral dollars here and there to achieve “perfect” balance may not make finan-
cial sense. 
A rule I give myself is to never pay more than one-half of 1 percent to make a
trade for rebalancing purposes. In the example in the previous section, a
trade of $4,000 of AGG is going to cost you $15, so you are forking out only
0.37 percent of $4,000; make the trade.
If, however, your bond allocation had dipped to only 28 percent, necessitat-
ing a purchase of $2,000 to get it in balance, I don’t think I’d opt to spend the
$15 to make the trade. Rather, I’d wait another year (or perhaps less if I
sensed that a major shift had occurred) to make the rebalance.
Harvesting Tax Losses, and the IRS’s 
Oh-So-Tricky “Wash Rule”
So you had a bad year on a particular investment? You had a bad year on
many of your investments? Allow Uncle Sam to share your pain. You only
need to sell the investment(s) by December 31st, and you can use the loss to
offset any capital gains. Or, if you’ve had no capital gains, you can deduct the
loss from your taxable ordinary income for the year, up to $3,000.
254
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

But there’s a problem. Because of the IRS’s “wash rule,” you can’t sell an
investment on December 31st and claim a loss if you buy back that same
investment or any “substantially identical” investment within 30 days of the
sale. You may simply want to leave your takings in cash. That way, you save
on any transaction costs and avoid the hassle of trading.
On the other hand, January is historically a very good time for stocks. You
may not want to be out of the market that month. What to do?
ETFs to the rescue!
What the heck is “substantially 
identical” anyway?
The IRS rules are a bit hazy when it comes to identifying “substantially identi-
cal” investments. Clearly, you can’t sell and then buy back the same stock.
But if you sell $10,000 of Exxon Mobil Corp. stock, you can buy $10,000 of an
ETF that covers the energy industry, such as the Energy Select Sector SPDR
(XLE) or the Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE). Not the same thing, for sure, but
either one will give you some exposure to Exxon Mobil Corp. (and its com-
petitors as well) for the 30 days that you must live without your stock.
I, of course, would prefer that you keep most of your portfolio in ETFs. If you
follow my advice, and one year turns out to be an especially bad year for, say,
large cap value stocks, no problem. If you are holding the iShares S&P 500
Value Index (IVE) and you sell for a loss, you can buy the Vanguard Value ETF
(VTV), hold it for a month, and then switch back to what you had if you wish.
Two ETFs that track similar indexes are going to be very, very similar, but not
“substantially identical.” At least the IRS so far has not deemed them substan-
tially identical. But the IRS changes its rules often, and what constitutes “sub-
stantially identical” could change tomorrow or the next day. It’s a good idea
to consult with a tax professional (which I am not) before proceeding with
any tax harvesting plans.
As always, consider cost
I’ll remind you again that trading an ETF requires you to pay a trading com-
mission to a brokerage house. To harvest a tax loss generally requires four
trades. (Sell the original holding, buy the replacement, sell the replacement,
buy back the original holding.) If you’re paying $15 a trade, that adds up to
255
Chapter 18: Exceptions to the Rule (Ain’t There Always)

$60. Plus, you lose a bit of money on each trade with the spread (the differ-
ence between the ask and bid price on a security). If you are in the 25 percent
tax bracket, that tells me your loss on a particular investment should be at
least $300 or so before you bother with tax harvesting in an ETF portfolio.
Revamping Your Portfolio with Life
Changes: Marriage, Divorce, and Babies
Rebalancing to bring your portfolio back to its original position isn’t the only
occasion to buy and sell your ETFs. Just as you may need a new suit if you
lose or gain weight, sometimes you need to tailor your portfolio in response
to changes in your life.
As I discuss in Chapter 16, the prime consideration in portfolio construction
is whether you can take risk in the hope of garnering high return or whether
you must limit your risk with the understanding that your returns will likely
be modest. (Diversification can certainly help to reduce investment risk, but
it can’t eliminate it.) Certain events may occur in your life that warrant a
reassessment of where you belong on the risk/return continuum.
A single woman (or man), walks into my office and asks me to help build a
portfolio, and one of the first questions I ask is, “How’s your love life?” A mar-
ried couple walks into my office, and one of the first things I take note of is
how close they sit together. And if the woman has a swollen belly, I really take
notice.
No, I’m not being nosy. Marriage, divorce, and the arrival of babies are major
life changes and need to be weighed heavily in any investment decisions. So
too are the death of a spouse or parent, a child’s decision to attend college,
any major career changes, or a big purchase such as a new car.
Betsy and Mark: A fairly typical couple
Betsy and Mark are engaged to be married. They don’t have a lot of money.
But both are young (early 30s), in good health, gainfully employed, and with-
out debt. They plan to merge their savings of roughly $33,500 and ask me to
help them invest it for the long haul.
The first thing we do is decide how much money to take out for emergency
coverage. Given their monthly expenses of roughly $3,500, we decide to earmark
256
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

five months’ of living expenses — $17,500 — and plunk that into a money
market account. That leaves us with $16,000 to spare.
Normally, I wouldn’t look at an ETF portfolio for $16,000, but this is money
they tell me they aren’t going to touch until retirement. I urge them to each
open a Roth IRA. (Any money you put into a Roth IRA grows tax-free for as
long as you wish; more on retirement accounts in the next chapter.) I ask
them to divide the $16,000 into the two accounts. Since they can both con-
tribute $4,000 for each year, I have them both make double contributions —
one for the past year (for example, you can make your 2007 contribution until
April 15, 2008), and one for the present year.
To save on transaction costs, I limit the number of investments and give each
partner a “partial” portfolio. Neither account alone is well-diversified, but
together, they are.
Betsy’s Roth IRA
Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)
$5,000
iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG)
$3,000
Mark’s Roth IRA
iShares Morningstar Small Core (JKJ)
$4,000
iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA)
$4,000
As Betsy and Mark’s portfolio grows, I would plan to add other asset classes
(real estate investment trusts, foreign small cap stocks, high-yield bonds, and
so on) and other accounts.
One year later
Betsy is pregnant with twins! The couple is saving up for their first home,
with a goal of making that purchase within 18 months. Although the Roth IRA
is normally not to be touched (without stiff penalty) before age 591⁄2, an
exception is made for first-time home purchases. Betsy and Mark could take
out as much as $10,000 without penalty.
I’d rather they leave their Roth IRA money untouched, but the couple inform
me that they think the money may need to be tapped. By this point, the
money in the Roth IRA has grown from $16,000 to $18,000 (for illustration
purposes, I’m pretending that each investment grew by an equal amount),
257
Chapter 18: Exceptions to the Rule (Ain’t There Always)

and the couple can each contribute another $4,000, bringing the total of both
accounts to $26,000. Since there is a possibility that $10,000 will need to be
yanked in one year, I earmark any fresh money to a non-volatile short-term
bond ETF.

Yet one year later
The twins (Tyler and Tucker) have arrived! Much to their surprise, Betsy’s
parents have gifted the couple $10,000 for the purchase of the home. The
Roth IRA money needn’t be touched. At this point, I would sell the short-term
bond fund and add to their existing positions. Also, provided the couple had
another $4,000 each to contribute, I’d begin adding asset classes to the mix,
perhaps starting with Vanguard Emerging Markets ETF (VWO), the Vanguard
REIT ETF (VNQ), and the PowerShares WilderHill Clean Energy Fund (PBW).
Hopefully, Betsy and Mark (and Tyler and Tucker) will have many happy
years together. And with each major life event, I would urge them to adjust
their growing portfolio appropriately.
Are Options An Option for You?
Beyond the world of exchange-traded funds, an entirely different universe is
filled with things called exchange-traded derivatives. A derivative is a financial
instrument that has no real value in and of itself; rather, its value is directly
tied to some underlying item of value, be that a commodity, a stock, a cur-
rency, or an ETF.
258
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

The most popular derivative is called an option. Think of an option as sort of
a movie ticket. You give the cashier $7.50 to see the movie, not to hold some
dumb little piece of cardboard. Certainly the ticket itself has no intrinsic
value. But the ticket gives access (the option) to see the movie.
Most options in the investment world give you the right to either buy or sell a
security at a certain price (the strike price) up to a certain specified date (the
expiration date). Options are a prime example of a leveraged investment. In
other words, you can leverage a little bit of money to win big money — or
(unfortunately) lose big money.
Lately, options on ETFs have been hot, hot, hot . . . and growing hotter.
Options on certain ETFs, most notably the QQQQ (which represents the 100
largest company stocks traded on the NASDAQ), typically trade just as many
shares on an average day as the ETF itself. (See the sidebar “QQQQ, SPY, and
IWM are the options champs.”) On most days, options on ETFs like the QQQQ
and SPY (representing the S&P 500) trade more shares than any other kind of
options, including options on individual stocks, commodities pools, and such.
You see, ETFs provide traders with the opportunity to trade the entire stock
market, or large pieces of it, rather than merely individual securities. In the
past, this was doable but difficult. You cannot trade a mutual fund on the
options market as you do an ETF.
Much of this often frenetic trading in ETF options is being done by specula-
tors, not investors. If you have an itch to take huge amounts of risk and
gamble in the hopes of hitting it big, options may be for you. In that case, I’ll
refer you to Futures & Options For Dummies by Joe Duarte, M.D. (Wiley). Dr.
Duarte will warn you, as I am warning you, that successful option trading
takes an iron gut, a lot of capital, and a lot of expertise. And even if you have
all that, you may still lose your shirt!
Understanding puts and calls
All kinds of options exist, including (sort of) options on options. The deriva-
tives market almost seems infinite — as do the number of ways you can play
with derivatives. But the two most basic kinds of options, and the two most
popular by far, are put options and call options, otherwise known simply as
puts and calls. I’m going to take just a moment to describe how these babies
work.
259
Chapter 18: Exceptions to the Rule (Ain’t There Always)

Puts: Options to sell
With a put option in hand, you may, for example, have bought yourself the
right to sell 100 shares of the QQQQ (currently trading at $40) at $35 (the
strike price) a share at any point between now and December 15th (the expi-
ration date). By December 15th, if the QQQQ has fallen to any price under
$35, you will likely choose to sell. If the QQQQ is trading above $35, you’d be
a fool to sell. Your option will simply expire, unused.
Calls: Options to buy
With a call option in hand, you may, for example, have bought yourself the
right to buy 100 shares of the QQQQ (currently trading at $40) at $45 (the
strike price) a share at any point between now and, say, December 18th (the
expiration date). If the QQQQ rises above $45, you would, of course, take the
option and buy the 100 shares at $45. After all, you can then turn around and
sell them immediately on the open market for a nifty profit. If, however, the
price of the QQQQ does not rise to $45 or above, you are not going to exer-
cise your option. Why in the world would you? You can buy the stock
cheaper on the market. In that case, your option expires worthless.

QQQQ, SPY, and IWM are the options champs
“ETFs are a huge part of the options market,”
says Jim Binder, spokesperson for the Options
Clearing Corporation, the world’s largest clear-
ing organization for options. According to
Binder, of the top six most commonly traded
options on U.S. exchanges, three are ETFs.
(These are subject to change, of course.) Here
are the top six:

Using options to make gains without risk
Those people who use calls as an investment (as opposed to gambling) strat-
egy are assuming (as do most investors) that the market is going to continue
its historical upward trajectory. But instead of banking perhaps 60 or 70 per-
cent of their portfolio on stocks, as many of us do, they take a much smaller
percentage of their money and buy calls. If the stock market goes up, they
may collect many times what they invested. If the stock market doesn’t go
up, they lose it all — but only a modest amount. Meanwhile, the bulk of their
money can be invested in something much less volatile than the stock
market, such as bonds.
Zvi Bodie, Professor of Finance and Economics at Boston University School of
Management, wrote a book with Michael J. Clowes entitled Worry-Free
Investing: A Safe Approach to Achieving Your Lifetime Financial Goals (Prentice
Hall) in which he suggests an investment strategy using long-term stock
options and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). If you have
$100,000 to invest, says Bodie, you might consider putting roughly 90 percent
of it into TIPS. (A very convenient way to do that would be to purchase the
iShares Lehman TIPS Bond Fund ETF.) That way, he asserts, your principal is
protected.
To shoot for growth, says Bodie, take the other 10 percent or so and invest it
in long-term call options (otherwise know as Long-Term Anticipation Securities
or LEAPS), going about three years out. If the market soars, you take home
the bacon. If, however, the market sinks, your call options merely expire, and
you still have your TIPS, which by this point, three years later, have grown to
match your original $100,000.
It’s an intriguing strategy that just may make sense, especially for older
investors tapping into their savings who can’t wait for the stock market to
come back after a serious bear market.
Interestingly, a similar kind of “worry-free investing” may be achieved by
owning all stocks (or close to it) but using put options to protect yourself
from the downside.
Insuring yourself against big, bad bears
The put option is an option to sell. This investment strategy allows you to
have money in the stock market (all of it, if you so desire), but you carry
insurance in the form of puts. If the market tumbles, you’re covered.
261
Chapter 18: Exceptions to the Rule (Ain’t There Always)

Suppose you want to invest everything in the NASDAQ index through the ETF
QQQQ. Normally, an investor would have to be insane to bet everything on
such a volatile asset. But with the right put options in place, you can actually
enjoy any explosive growth but limit your losses to whatever you wish: 5 per-
cent, 10 percent, 15 percent.
With a pocketful of puts, you can laugh a bear market in the face. If the QQQQ
drops by, say, 50 percent in the next week, you will have checked out long
before, smiling as you hold your cash.
Seeming almost too good to be true
So options allow you to capture the gains of the stock market with very lim-
ited risk. They allow you to invest in the market and not have to worry about
downturns. What’s not to love about options?
Whoaaa. Not so fast! You need to know a couple little things about options:
 They are expensive. Every time you buy either a put or a call, you pay.
The price can vary enormously depending on the strike price, the expi-
ration date you choose, and the volatility of the ETF the option is based
on. But in no case are options cheap. And the vast majority of options
reach their expiration date and simply expire.
So, yes, options can save you in a bear market, and they can help you to
capture a bull market, but either way, you’re going to pay. Free lunches
are very hard to come by!
 If you happen to make a gain on an option, the income will usually be
considered a short-term gain by the IRS. As such, you may pay twice
the tax on it that you would on the long-term appreciation of a stock.
Weighing options strategies against 
the diversified ETF portfolio
Don’t misunderstand me. I’m not saying that the price you pay for options
isn’t worth it — even with taxes included. Options do provide a viable strat-
egy for investing. The real question, though, is whether using puts and calls
makes any more sense than investing in a well-diversified portfolio of low-
cost ETFs. Most financial professionals I know are skeptical. And that
includes several who have traded heavily in options only to learn the hard
way that it is very tricky business.
262
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

To be sure, if I knew a bear market was coming, I would definitely buy myself
a slew of put options. If I knew a bull market was coming, I would certainly
buy a fistful of call options. But here’s the problem: I don’t know which way
the market is going. And if I buy both puts and calls on a regular basis, I’m
going to be forever bleeding cash.
Not only that, if the market stagnates, then both my puts and calls will prove
worthless. In that case, I’m really going to be one unhappy camper.
So here’s the way I look at it: The chances of success with a steady call strategy
are one in three: I win if there’s a bull market; I lose if there’s a bear market; I
lose if the market stagnates. Ditto for a put option strategy: I win if there’s a bear
market; I lose if there’s a bull market; I lose if the market stagnates.
With a well-diversified portfolio of low-cost ETFs — stock, bond, REIT, and
commodity ETFs — I reckon my chances of success are more like two in
three: I lose if there’s a bear market; I win if there’s a bull market; in the case
of a stagnant stock market, something in my portfolio will likely continue to
make me money anyway.
You may recall I said earlier in the chapter that the derivatives market almost
seems infinite, as do the number of ways you can play with derivatives. If you
wish, ETF options strategies exist that allow you to make money in a stagnant
market, too. The most common such strategy is called alternatively a buy-
write strategy or selling a covered call. I explain how that strategy works (but
don’t necessarily advocate it) in the sidebar “How to profit with ETF options
in a stagnant market.”
Factoring in time and hassle
One final (but fairly large) consideration: Options trading generally requires
much more time and effort than does buy-and-hold investing in a diversified
portfolio. Let me ask you this: Would you rather be tinkering with your
investments on weekends, spending hours at your computer, or would you
rather be sailing?
263

Part IV: Putting It All Together 
How to profit with ETF options 
in a stagnant market
Selling a covered call is a traditional way that
many people get started in the world of options,
says Jim Bittman, an instructor with the
Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Options
Institute. “You can take a non-dividend paying
ETF and turn it into an income-generating
asset,” he says.
Here is how selling a covered call, otherwise
known as a buy-write strategy, works:
You buy, say, 1,000 shares of the NASDAQ-100
(QQQQ). Let’s assume that the current price is
$38 a share. You’ve just spent $38,000 (plus a
small trading commission of perhaps $15 or so,
which, for simplicity’s sake, we’ll ignore for the
moment).
Now you sell your covered call. In other words,
through a brokerage house, you offer someone
else the right to purchase your shares at a cer-
tain price in the future. You may, for example,
offer the right to purchase your 1,000 shares at
$40 (the strike price) within 90 days (the expira-
tion date). For selling this right, you get paid. In
this scenario, you may get paid something in the
ballpark of 75 cents a share for a total of $750
(roughly 2 percent of your original investment).
If, in the next 90 days, the QQQQ stays between
$38 and $40 (the market is relatively flat), your
covered call expires. You walk away with your
$750, and life is good. (However, you will have to
pay the IRS a short-term capital gains tax on
that money. The short-term capital gains tax is
usually the same as your marginal income tax
rate. In many cases, that will be about twice as
high as the tax you would pay cashing out on a
long-term investment.)
But now suppose that the market tanks: You are
left holding 1,000 shares of the QQQQ that may
be worth much less than $38,000. And suppose
the market soars: You just lost out, too. The
QQQQ may be selling at $60 a share, but the guy
who bought your contract can buy them from
you (and certainly will buy them from you) at the
agreed-upon price of $40 a share. In that case,
you’ve just suffered an opportunity loss of
$20,000.
And there’s the catch. I’ve known a good
number of investors who rave about their expe-
riences with covered calls . . . as long as the
markets are relatively stagnant. As soon as
there is major movement either up or down,
they stop raving and start ranting.

Using ETFs to Fund Your 
Golden Years
In This Chapter
 Differentiating various retirement account options
 Knowing which ETFs to sock into which accounts
 Figuring out what to do if your employer’s 401(k) plan stinks
 Calculating how much money you need to retire
 Planning your cash flow needs after the paycheck stops
I
have this imaginary script that often runs in my head when a client asks
me to look at his or her 401(k) plan. In this make-believe play, the benefits
manager at my client’s place of employment is speaking with a representative
of an investment company that runs retirement plans.
Benefits manager: Our employees work hard, and we really don’t ever
want to lose them.
Investment company rep: No problemo! We offer a retirement plan so
incredibly bad that those employees of yours will never be able to retire!
Just take a look at this array of some of the most expensive and poorly
performing mutual funds available on the market today. That’s what we
offer!
Benefits manager: Good. Good. And what about portfolio diversification?
Investment company rep: None. Four of the nine mutual funds under our
umbrella are large U.S. growth funds. We offer no small cap. No interna-
tional anything. Just large U.S. growth, a few ridiculously expensive and
volatile bond funds, and a lifestyle fund similarly overpriced with wholly
inappropriate allocations for employees of all ages.
Benefits manager: Excellent! Will the fees wipe out any potential gains?

Investment company rep: Absolutely! Each mutual fund in the plan charges
at least a 5 percent load, a good chunk of cash each year beyond that in
operating fees, and then we slap on yet another high fee on top of it all!
And did I mention that several of the mutual fund companies we use have
recently been involved in legal scandals? I can almost guarantee you that
your employees’ investments won’t earn squat, and they’ll be working for
you forever.
Benefits manager: You’re hired!
Okay, maybe this is a paranoid fantasy on my part, but I’m not so sure. Many
of the 401(k) plans I see — and I see many — are so manifestly terrible, so
ridiculously designed and priced, and so poorly managed that you can’t help
but imagine that someone set out to make them as horrible as possible.
And that makes me sad. The traditional company pension — grandpa’s retire-
ment plan that provided him with a steady paycheck from the day he retired
till the day he died — is disappearing from the land. Social Security typically
provides a modest income, and no more, and even that is at risk. That leaves
the omnipresent 401(k) plan (and the lottery ticket) as many working
people’s last hope for a comfortable retirement.
My advice? Read this chapter. It’s about . . . you guessed it . . . ETFs, potential
financial knights in white armor.
ETFs alone are not going to allow everyone everywhere to retire to the golf
course or the home in the mountains. But they could take you a very long
way in that direction. In this chapter, I discuss how you should be using your
ETFs in tax-advantaged retirement accounts to get the most bang for your
investment buck. I offer advice for those of you stuck with crappy 401(k)
plans at work. (Hint: Corner that benefits manager by the water cooler and
hand him this book.) And I escort you into your retirement years to see how
an ETF portfolio may provide you with the income you need to replace your
current paycheck.
Setting the Stage for Economic 
Self-Sufficiency
I’ve got all the money I’ll ever need — if I die by four o’clock this afternoon.
Henny Youngman
How much you need in your portfolio to call yourself economically self-
sufficient (“retired,” if you prefer to call it that) starts off with a very simple
formula: A × B = $$$$.
266
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

A is the amount of money you need to live on for one year. B is the number of
years you plan to live without a paycheck. $$$$ is the amount you should
have before bidding the boss adieu. There you have it.
Of course, that is waaay oversimplified. You also need to factor in such things
as return on your future portfolio, inflation, Social Security, and, for the very
lucky, any potential inheritances. For a more detailed reckoning of how much
money you should be looking to save, I’ll refer you to some fairly decent
online retirement calculators; see the sidebar “How much is enough?”
267
Chapter 19: Using ETFs to Fund Your Golden Years
How much is enough?
A reasonable accumulation goal for most fami-
lies is 20 times the amount you spend in a year.
To reach that goal, most families have to put
away a minimum of 15 percent of their salaries
for a minimum of two to three decades. For
more accurate (but still ballpark) numbers, I can
refer you to a number of retirement calculators
on the Web.
Good (and very quick!):
 www.moneychimp.com/calculator/
retirement_calculator.htm
Better:
 www.dinkytown.net/java/
RetirementIncome.html
 https://flagship4.vanguard.
com/VGApp/hnw/Retirement
Savings
Best (but not perfect):
 www.fireseeker.com
Note: If you use any of the first three calcula-
tors, be realistic about your expected rate of
return. (Fireseeker will help figure out a realistic
rate of return for you.)
If you do use fireseeker (fire stands for “financial
independence/retire early”), please take note:
Although I love this guy’s free Web site (please
contribute a few dollars to it as I have), I disagree
strongly with his assertion that all you will need
to live on in retirement is “30 – 50% of current
gross.” I understand the man’s reasoning. And
maybe that 30 to 50 percent of gross would hold
true for Canadians and Brits, but most people in
the United States are likely going to be shelling
out small fortunes on healthcare in their older
years. (According to a recent study from Fidelity
Investments, a 65-year-old couple retiring today
should have at least $190,000 saved just to cover
out-of-pocket medical expenses during the
retirement years. For people ages 60, 55, and 50
planning to leave the workforce at 65, the num-
bers jump to $260,000, $370,000, and $530,000,
respectively.) That makes it very likely that your
current expenses are not going to decrease, or
decrease by much.
One more bit of advice for getting the most out
of the fireseeker calculator: When the program
asks you for the total annual investment
expenses (as a percentage of total value), type
in 1.67 percent if you currently have most of your
money in mutual funds. If you intend to follow
my advice in this book and move to a portfolio
of ETFs, you can lower that to, oh, let’s say 0.30
percent. Note how much of a difference that
alone can make in your retirement projections!

Taking the basic steps
Whatever the amount you set as your goal, you need to do three basic things
to achieve it:
 Perhaps obvious, although most people prefer to ignore it, you have to
save and save some more. A retirement portfolio doesn’t just pop up out
of nowhere and grow like Jack’s beanstalk. You need to feed it. Regularly.
 You need to invest your money wisely. That’s where a well-diversified
portfolio of ETFs comes in.
 It behooves you to take maximum advantage of retirement plans such as
your company 401(k) plan — even if it’s sub par — IRAs, and (my
favorite) Roth IRAs. If your 401(k) plan offers only pitiful options, you
need to do the best you can. I provide some specific advice on that situ-
ation later in this chapter.
Choosing the right vessels
If you will, try to think of your retirement plans — your 401(k), your IRA — as
separate vessels of money. How much your nest egg grows depends on not
just how much you put into it and which investments you choose, but also
which vessels you have.
There are three basic kinds of vessels. (I’m big into three’s all of a sudden.)
 First are your basic vanilla retirement plans, such as the company 401(k),
the IRA, or, for the self-employed, the SEP-IRA or Individual 401(k). These
are all tax-deferred vehicles: You don’t pay taxes on the money in the year
you earn it; rather, you pay taxes at whatever point you withdraw money
from your account, typically only after you retire.
 Next are the Roth IRA and the 529 college plans. Those are tax free: As
long as you play by certain rules (discuss them with your accountant),
anything you plunk into these two vehicles (money you’ve generally
already paid tax on) can double, triple, or (oh please!) quadruple, and
you’ll never owe the IRS a cent.
 Third is your non-retirement brokerage or savings bank account. Except
for certain select investments, such as municipal bonds (“munis”), all
earnings on your holdings are taxable.
Why your choice of vessels matters — a whole lot
How much can your choice of vessel affect the ultimate condition of your
nest egg? Lots. Even in a portfolio of all ETFs.
268
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

True, ETFs are marvelously tax-efficient instruments. Often, in the case of
stock ETFs, they eliminate the need to pay any capital gains tax (as you
would with most mutual funds) for as long as you hold the ETF. Still, there
may be taxes to pay at the end of the game when you finally cash out. And
in the case of certain ETFs (such as any of the bond ETFs) that pay either
interest or high dividends, you will certainly pay taxes along the way.
Suppose you’re an average middle-class guy or gal with a marginal income
tax rate of 30 percent (federal + state + local). Next, suppose that you have
$50,000 that you’ve already paid tax on, and you’re ready to squirrel it away
for the future. You invest this money in the iShares GS $ InvesTop Corporate
Bond Fund (LQD), which yields (hypothetically) 6 percent over the life of the
investment, and you keep it for the next 15 years. Now, if that ETF is held in
your regular brokerage account, and you have to pay taxes on the interest
every year, at the end of 15 years you’d have a pot worth $92,680. Not too
shabby. But if you hold that very same $50,000 bond ETF in your Roth IRA
and pay no taxes each year nor any taxes at the end, after 15 years you’d
have $119,828 — an extra $27,148.
Unfortunately, the amount of money you can put into retirement accounts is
limited, although the law has allowed the sum to grow in recent years. For
example, as I write this book, the maximum annual contribution amount in
the most commonly used retirement accounts for the self-employed, the IRA
and the Roth IRA, is $4,000 if you’re under 50 and $5,000 if you’re above 50.
(The amount is subject to change each year.) Other retirement plans, such as
the 401(k), SIMPLE plan, or Keogh, may have higher limits, but there is
always a cap. (You need to talk to your accountant about these plan limits;
the formulas can get terribly complicated.)
What should go where?
Given these investment limitations, which ETFs and other investments
should get utmost priority and go first into your retirement accounts, and
which are best left out? Follow these four (yeah, I’ve given up on three’s) pri-
mary principles, and you can’t go too wrong:
 Any investment that generates a lot of taxable income, you want in
your retirement account; any investment that throws off little or no
taxable income, you don’t. Any of the bond ETFs, the REIT ETFs, or the
high-dividend ETFs are probably best held in your retirement account.
 Keep your emergency funds out of your IRA. Any money you think you
may need to withdraw in a hurry should be kept out of your retirement
accounts. Withdrawing money from a retirement account can often be
tricky, possibly involving penalties if before age 591⁄2, and often triggering
taxation. You don’t want to have to worry about such things when you
need money by noon tomorrow.
269
Chapter 19: Using ETFs to Fund Your Golden Years

 House those investments with the greatest potential for growth in
your tax-free Roth IRA. This may include your small-value ETF, micro
cap ETF, or emerging markets ETF. Roth IRA money won’t ever be taxed
(assuming no change in the law), so why not try to get the most bang for
your ETF buck?
 Foreign stock ETFs are perhaps best kept in your taxable account.
That’s because the U.S. government will reimburse you for any taxes
your fund paid out to foreign governments, but only if you have that
fund in a taxable account. Over the long-run, this “rebate” can add about
half a percentage point a year to your returns; it doesn’t sound like a lot,
but that amount can add up over time.
Before you decide where to plunk your investments, refer to the following
two sections for the basic rules.
Caveat: Tax laws change all the time. For example, the lower rates on capital
gains and dividends, unless Congress steps in to intervene, will revert in 2009
to pre-2003 levels. Because of the constant change, I advise you to review
your portfolio every year or two to make sure you have your assets in the
right “containers.”
Retirement accounts
First are ETFs and other investments generally best kept in a retirement
account:
 Bond ETFs. Examples include
• iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG)
• iShares Lehman 7–10 Treasury Bond Fund (IEF)
• iShares Lehman TIPS Bond Fund (TIP)
 ETFs that invest in real estate investment trusts (REITS). Examples
include
• Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ)
• iShares Cohen & Steers Realty Majors Index Fund (ICF)
• streetTRACKS Wilshire REIT Index Fund (RWR)
 High-dividend ETFs. Examples include
• PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio (PEY)
• SPDR Dividend (SDY)
• iShares Dow Jones Dividend Index (DVY)
 Actively managed mutual funds.
270
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Taxable accounts
Next are ETFs and other investments generally best kept in a taxable account:
 Cash reserve for emergencies.
 Stock ETFs, except for the highest dividend-paying funds. Examples
include
• Fidelity NASDAQ Composite (ONEQ)
• iShares Morningstar Large Growth (JKE)
• streetTRACKS Dow Jones U.S. Small Cap Growth (DSG)
 Foreign stock ETFs. Examples include
• iShares S&P Europe 350 (IEV)
• Vanguard Pacific (VPL)
• BLDRS Emerging Markets 50 ADR (ADRE)
 Municipal bonds.
Curing a Seemingly Incurable 
Case of the 401(k) Blues
Got one of those plans at work that I describe in the intro to this chapter, cer-
tain to eat you up alive in fees, about as well-diversified as a lunar landscape?
Don’t despair. All is not lost. Here is what I suggest:
 Take the boss’s money with a smile. Make a big effort to shovel in at
least the minimum you need to contribute to get your full company
match (which will differ company to company). If you do not contribute
enough to receive your employer’s full matching contribution, you are, in
essence, leaving free money on the table. Even if the investment options
are horrible, you’ll likely wind up well ahead of the game if your employer
is kicking in an extra 25 or 50 percent.
 Invest the best you can. Among the horrible choices, pick the least hor-
rible. Choose those that will give you exposure to different asset classes.
Choose index funds if available. Strongly favor whichever funds are least
expensive. Avoid load (fat commission up front) funds!
If you need help understanding the different offerings in your 401(k) plan,
ask someone in the human resources department, or the plan administra-
tor, to help you. If you can’t get a clear answer (you very well may not),
you may wish to hire a financial planner for at least a short consult.
 Argue for better options. Tell the human resources people (diplomati-
cally, of course) that their plan is a dog. They should look for another
271
Chapter 19: Using ETFs to Fund Your Golden Years

plan that includes either ETFs or (sometimes just as good) low-cost
index funds. Not sure what to say or where to send them? Specific
advice is coming in the next section.
 Check your statements. It doesn’t happen often, thank goodness, but
yes, sometimes employers steal from their employees’ retirement funds.
Check your statements with some regularity, and make certain that the
money you are contributing is being registered in your account.
 Plan your rollover. If you leave your job, you may have the option of
keeping your 401(k) plan right where it is. HA! Ninety percent of the
time, you will do much better by rolling your 401(k) into an IRA and then
building yourself a well-diversified ETF portfolio.
One important caveat: You can’t withdraw IRA money without penalty
until you are 591⁄2, whereas some (but not all) 401(k) plans allow you to
withdraw your money penalty-free at 55 if you decide to retire at that
point. Don’t be too quick to initiate a rollover if you think you may need
to tap your funds in the years between 55 and 59⁄2.
If you do initiate a rollover, and you have your own company’s stock in your
401(k), you may want to leave just that part behind. You’ll get a nice tax break
at retirement.
Lobbying the benefits 
manager at the office
Okay, you have a 401(k) plan. The plan is so bad you want to cry. Your first job
is to educate the benefits manager as to why. Don’t assume that the people in
HR have any more knowledge of personal finance than you do. If you have a
lousy 401(k) plan, chances are they don’t have a clue. Chances are good that
they were bamboozled into accepting a high priced, poorly constructed plan
by a fast talking sales rep from a financial institution (often a large financial
institution with a well-known name) that specializes in milking the public.
I started this chapter with a hypothetical dialogue between the benefits man-
ager of your company and a representative from a financial institution look-
ing to sell its crappy retirement plan. Here I present a hypothetical dialogue
between you and your benefits manager:
You: Hey, Joe!
Benefits manager: Hey, _____! What’s that black and yellow thing in your
hand, a copy of Goldbricking For Dummies? (Har har har.)
You: Actually, Joe, this is a book called Exchange-Traded Funds For
Dummies, and I’ve been meaning to share it with you.
Benefits manager: Whoa! Exchange-traded whaa?
272
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

You: Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies. It’s all about exchange-traded
funds — they’re the hottest thing on Wall Street. They’re basically like
index mutual funds that trade like stocks, and they are very inexpensive
and have many other benefits for the investor. In fact, I’ve done a little bit
of calculation, and I believe that we could slash the expenses on our com-
pany’s 401(k) plan by as much as three-quarters, while giving partici-
pants an opportunity to build much better diversified portfolios than
they can under the present plan.
Benefits manager: [Mouth open wide, bit of coffee dribbling down the side
of his chin.]
You: Here, take this, Joe. [You pass him this book.] I want you to read
especially Chapter 19, and particularly the sidebar “ETFs and 401(k)
plans,” where the author gives specific advice for where really sharp and
industrious HR managers like you can turn for more information. Oh, see
the sidebar “What a 401(k) plan can look like,” too.
Introducing the Roth 401(k)
On January 1, 2006, a new kid on the retirement block came into being: the
Roth 401(k). While you’re chatting with your benefits manager, you may want
to bring this subject up, too.

Chapter 19: Using ETFs to Fund Your Golden Years
ETFs and 401(k) plans
Not many companies offer 401(k) retirement
plans with ETF offerings, but the market is
“exploding” according to one industry insider.
You’d think that would make me — great lover
of ETFs that I am — jump for joy.
I’m not jumping.
The problem with ETFs in 401(k) plans isn’t what
you may think. Even though you may be making
weekly contributions, the trading fees can
easily be overcome in an employee retirement
plan. By making all the employee’s trades
together, the plan sponsor can actually cut the
trading costs down to almost nothing.
No, the problem is that from what I’ve seen,
many 401(k) plan sponsors are packing their
ETFs into nonsensical allocations and slapping
on charges (as high as 2 percentage points!)
that pretty much outweigh the benefits of the
ETFs.
Why do they do that? Because ETFs are hot, and
they make for a good sales presentation, but the
plan sponsor’s bottom line may be making
money for itself — not for you.
There are exceptions, however. One company
called Invest n Retire, LLC, based in Portland,
Oregon (www.investnretire.com) puts
together ETF-based 401(k) plans with decent
allocations and a total cost to the participant of
less than one-half of 1 percent. Tell your human
resources people to contact this company! The
number is 503-419-2894. The address is 506 SW
6th Avenue, Suite 1200, Portland, OR 97204.

Part IV: Putting It All Together 
What A 401(k) plan can look like
Most of the 401(k) plans I see are horrible: high
expenses, hidden expenses, impossible to prop-
erly diversify. A few companies, however, have
begun to offer excellent 401(k) plans built of ETFs.
Invest n Retire, LLC of Portland, Oregon uses
mostly ETFs to build its 401(k) plans. Following is
a sample of such a 401(k) plan. The asset allo-
cations here, designed by Darwin Abrahamson,
a personal financial planner and CEO of Invest n
Retire, represent both a conservative portfolio
and a “growth” (higher risk/higher potential
return) portfolio.
The total fees for the actual ETFs run 0.23 per-
cent for the conservative allocation portfolio
and 0.31 percent for the growth portfolio. The
total costs to the employee for such a plan
(depending on the employer) would typically run
about 0.57 percent. In contrast, the average
401(k) plan charges 1.6 percent, with some fees
running 3.0 percent.
What’s the difference between a retirement
plan that charges you 0.57 in management fees
and a plan that charges you 3.0 percent? Start
with $10,000, then invest $6,000 a year more for
15 years in a plan with the lower expense ratio,
and, assuming an 8 percent return on your
investments, you’ll have a pre-retirement 401(k)
worth $185,164. Invest the same amount for the
same period of time in a plan that charges the
higher (3.0 percent) expense ratio, and you’ll be
left with $150,261. That’s a difference in the size
of your nest egg of $34,903.

To date, a minority of companies (but a growing minority) has started to offer
Roth 401(k) plans to employees. This type of plan is similar to the existing
Roth IRA in that the money you put in is after-tax money. In other words, you
won’t get a tax deduction up front, as you do with your existing 401(k).
So why do it? There are two main reasons:
 First, you aren’t going to have to pay any income tax when you withdraw
the money in retirement, as you will with your existing 401(k).
 Second, you aren’t going to have to sweat about taking minimum
required distributions starting at age 701⁄2 like you do now with a 401(k).
You can keep the money in the Roth as long as you wish. Or you can
leave it as an inheritance to your heirs, tax-free.

If you are currently in a low tax bracket, I’d say the Roth 401(k) will prove to
be the better long-term option. (My own personal bias may be coming out
here. I feel that with the federal deficit as huge as it is and growing, sooner or
later, the government will have to raise tax rates. At that point, even though
you are retired and living off a fixed income, you may be paying a higher rate
than you do today.)
On the other hand, if you are currently in a high tax bracket and expect to be
in a lower tax bracket in the future, the Roth may not make sense. If you are
single and make over $75,000 a year, or if you and your spouse together make
over $100,000, I suggest talking to your financial planner or accountant to find
out which plan is best for you.
Unfortunately, as with many 401(k) plans, your investment options may not
be the best. If you leave the company, I suggest that you take your 401(k)
Roth and roll it into a Roth IRA.
Strategies for the Self-Employed
Although the self-employed have several retirement plan options, the two
most popular, by far, are the traditional IRA and the Roth IRA. (Company
employees can also contribute to these plans, but few do, and the deductibil-
ity of an IRA becomes a complicated matter if you have a retirement plan at
work.) Let me compare the two different IRA options.
The traditional IRA versus the Roth IRA
The traditional IRA currently allows you to sock away $4,000 a year if you’re
under 50 and $5,000 if you’re over 50. The money you put into a traditional IRA
is generally tax-deductible. You can’t touch that money without paying a
penalty until you turn 591⁄2. At that point, you can start to withdraw it, but you’ll
need to pay income tax on both the principal and any growth in the account.
The Roth IRA is available to people with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of
less than $110,000 a year. It allows you to sock away the very same amount as
the traditional IRA, but the Roth allows your money to grow tax-free. You will
never have to pay taxes on any of the money you put into your Roth or on
any of the gains. You don’t, however, get any deductions on the money you
contribute to the Roth.
If your income is very low, like under $25,000, you may qualify for a tax
credit of up to $1,000 regardless of whether you choose the traditional or
the Roth IRA.
276
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Taxes now or taxes later?
So . . . do you want to pay your taxes on the money now and not have to
worry about taxes when you retire? (You want a Roth.) Or do you want to
hold off paying the taxes now and pay them after you retire? (You want a tra-
ditional IRA.)
Which is the better option depends on a few things, but foremost is the size
of your income and your income expectations for whenever you plan to with-
draw the funds. If you expect that your income will be less in retirement (pre-
sumably moving you into a lower tax bracket, although tax brackets can
certainly change), you are likely better off with the traditional IRA; take the
deduction now. If you are currently in a low income tax bracket and think (or
pray) that you may be in a higher bracket in years to come, go with the Roth.
If it seems like a toss-up, choose the Roth. That’s because the Roth offers cer-
tain non-tax advantages. With a traditional IRA, for example, you need to start
withdrawing the money at age 701⁄2. But with a Roth, you’ll be able to keep
your money growing tax-free for as long as you are still breathing.
Ushering Your Portfolio into 
Retirement Readiness
A fellow fee-only financial planner and member of NAPFA, William P. Bengen,
CFP, wrote a book for financial planners called Conserving Client Portfolios
During Retirement (FPA Press). Bengen did an enormous amount of number
crunching, reviewing historical return figures going back to 1926. He and his
computer played out scenario after scenario: If you retired in year X, and you
took out $Y for Z years . . . that sort of fun analysis. His conclusion: The con-
ventional wisdom is both right and wrong. Right, stocks drive a portfolio.
Wrong, once you retire, you should live off bonds.
15+ years and counting
If you have 15 years or more to go until retirement, the money in your retire-
ment account should — if history is our guide — be all stock, or pretty close
to it. Looking back over the many years, your odds of coming out ahead in
any 15-year period are pretty close to a certainty. Forget the bonds. (Of
course, the future may not be like the past, so maybe put a little bit into
bonds, just in case.)
277
Chapter 19: Using ETFs to Fund Your Golden Years

Less than 15 years to retirement
For each year less than 15 years to retirement, says Bengen, you may want to
shave 2 percentage points off your stock investments and allocate the differ-
ence to bonds. So if you have, say, 10 years till retirement, you may want 90
percent stock and 10 percent bonds. At 5 years till retirement, you may be
looking at 80 percent stock and 20 percent bonds.
After you get to retirement, assuming you’re looking at a 30-year lifespan or
so at that point, you should be thinking not about the conventional mostly-
bonds retirement portfolio but, rather, ballpark 60 percent stocks and 40 per-
cent bonds. With that mix, your portfolio has the best chance of being
around as long as you are.
Throughout his book (as I do throughout this book), Bengen urges investors
not to be “wooden” and not to adhere to any strict formulas. The percentages
I note here can, and should, bend with circumstance.
I also urge you to think of stocks and bonds in the broadest sense of “growth
investments” and “security investments.” Growth investments may include
commodities or real estate as well as stocks. Security investments may
include a fixed annuity or a market-neutral mutual fund (with a proven track
record), as well as government and corporate bonds. Of course, both your
stock and bond positions can — and likely should — be held in ETFs.
Withdrawing Funds to Replace 
Your Paycheck
How much can you withdraw from your retirement funds each year and have
a good chance of not running out of money? That, of course, is one of the
biggest financial questions retirees have. According to Bengen, the answer is
somewhere around 4 to 5 percent of your portfolio, depending on your age,
your investment choices, market conditions, the rate of inflation, your tax hit,
and how much you want to leave behind for those rotten children of yours
who never come to visit anymore.
I say, go with Bengen’s rough estimate of 4 to 5 percent and use some of the
retirement calculators I mention in the sidebar “How much is enough?” to
smooth out the estimate a bit, but do plan to sit down with a financial plan-
ner at least once to get some better idea of where you stand. You don’t want
to run out of money!
As far as withdrawing funds from an ETF portfolio, in the following section, I
offer a few special words of advice.
278
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Don’t obsess about maintaining principal
or drawing from dividends
I’m not quite sure where it got started, this absurd division of the nest egg
into principal and interest. It’s a form of almost mass hysteria that began
many years ago.
Listen: If you have an account with, say, $100,000, and you withdraw $5,000,
how much do you have left? The answer is $95,000. The answer will always
be $95,000. It doesn’t matter in the slightest whether that $5,000 comes from
principal or whether you took it out of recently received dividends or inter-
est. (There may be a tax difference in a nonretirement brokerage account, but
in a retirement account, there is absolutely no difference.)
So what does this mean in terms of withdrawing funds to live on in retirement?
The best way to achieve that end is to rebalance your portfolio with some
regularity (perhaps once every six months), tapping into whichever funds
have done the best and creating your own “artificial dividend.”
For example, say you have an IRA with a balance of $100,000. The money is
invested (for simplicity’s sake) into three ETFs and a cash position. It looks
like this:
 Cash: $5,000 (5 percent)
 Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI): $25,000 (25 percent)
 iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA): $25,000 (25 percent)
 iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG): $45,000 (45 percent)
You determine that you will need to withdraw the $5,000 in cash plus another
$5,000 over the next 12 months. Your portfolio master plan calls for only 40
percent bonds, and (because it has been a horrible year for stocks and an okay
year for bonds) your bond allocation is now 45 percent. The source for your
$5,000 is clear: Take it out of the bond ETF. Doing so will not only generate the
cash you need but will also bring your portfolio into balance at the same time.
Fast-forward to one year later . . .
Stocks have suddenly been on a tear, and the “principal” you now have
invested in stocks has grown, thanks to capital appreciation, considerably.
Your Aggregate Bond fund has also grown (from its starting position of
$40,000), due mostly to earned interest, which has been reinvested into the
ETF. Your bond fund is back where it started the year, with $45,000.
279
Chapter 19: Using ETFs to Fund Your Golden Years

Your portfolio, even though you withdrew $10,000 in cash during the year, is
now worth $125,000. It now looks like this:
 Cash: $0
 Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI): $40,000 (32 percent)
 iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA): $40,000 (32 percent)
 iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG): $45,000 (36 percent)
Nothing has really changed in your life (except that you are now a year older
and a year grayer), so you determine that you don’t need to shake up your
original target portfolio allocation: 40 percent AGG, 30 percent VTI, and 30 per-
cent EFA. You figure that you are going to need another $10,000 for the coming
year. Do you take it out of the bond fund because the growth is due to interest
rather than growth of principal, as was the case with the stock funds? Many
people would, yes. Mass hysteria, as I said. That makes no sense.
In this case, I would ask you to take the money from your two stock ETFs:
$5,000 from each. That leaves you with a portfolio of $115,000, invested as
follows:
 Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI): $35,000 (30.4 percent)
 iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA): $35,000 (30.4 percent)
 iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG): $45,000 (39.1 percent)
You have provided yourself with the $10,000 you need, and you’ve brought
your portfolio back into near-perfect balance.
As always, watch the fees
In the scenario in the previous section, to withdraw your $10,000 cash need,
you sold off bits of two ETFs. That means paying two commissions. That
means (if you trade online, which you certainly should do) a total trading
cost of perhaps $30. (If you’re paying more than $15 a trade, you are with the
wrong brokerage house.) In my eyes, that’s perfectly acceptable. If you are
withdrawing only several hundred dollars at a time, or even just a couple
grand, however, you may want to be in no-load, transaction-free, indexed
mutual funds rather than ETFs. You’ll need to work the numbers.
In general, I’d say you never want to spend more than one-half of 1 percent
on a trade, and — on the other side of the equation — you never want to let
your portfolio get too out of balance. Another rule: If your biggest allocation
factor — stocks versus bonds — is out of whack more than 5 percentage
points (bonds should be 40 percent, but instead they’ve dipped to 35 percent
or risen to 45 percent), you need to make a move.
280
Part IV: Putting It All Together 

Make your minimum required distributions
After you turn 591⁄2, you can start taking money out of your 401(k) or tradi-
tional IRA. (You can do so before that age, but you usually pay a stiff penalty
or have to go through a lot of song and dance with the IRS.) When you turn
701⁄2, you must start taking money out of your 401(k) or traditional IRA (but
not your Roth IRA). If you don’t take out at least the minimum required distri-
bution (MRD), you pay a very nasty penalty. The MRD is based on your port-
folio total and your age. There are MRD calculators all over the Web; simply
Google the words “minimum required distribution calculator,” and you’ll have
many to choose from. Unlike some other calculators, the MRD calculators are
all essentially the same.
IRA, 401(k), or regular (taxable) 
brokerage account: Which to tap first?
For those of you over 701⁄2, your cash needs will come first from Social
Security, any pension you may have, and the minimum required distribution
on your traditional IRA or 401(k). Beyond that, you may have a choice as to
which account to pull the money from. For those of you over 591⁄2 but not yet
701⁄2, the choice is all yours. Most money managers suggest pulling money
from your taxable accounts first, and then and only then from your tax-
advantaged accounts. I dunno.
Sure, keeping your money as long as possible in a tax-deferred account will
keep this year’s taxes to a minimum. But if you care about what you’re leav-
ing behind to heirs, the IRA is going to be a pain for them to inherit, for they
will have to pay income taxes on the money. For most families, it may make
the most sense to pull more or less equally from both accounts: tax-deferred
and taxable. But there are so many factors involved, it would be worth your
while to discuss the matter with your financial planner, accountant, and
estate attorney.
Caveat: From my experience, accountants sometimes tend to focus a wee bit
too much on your present taxes; estate attorneys focus a tad too much on
your inheritance. These are justifiable biases; just be aware of them.

T
ime now to wrap up this book with some practical tips
(just in case I haven’t provided you with enough in
previous chapters). I begin by answering the ten most
common questions I get about ETFs. That is followed by a
discussion of the ten mistakes that most investors — yes,
even smart ETF investors! — often make. And finally, I
could hardly call myself a financial professional unless I
(like seemingly all other financial professionals) made
some predictions! And so, I end Part V by pulling out my
crystal ball and making ten forecasts about the future of
ETFs. Only time will tell if I am right.

Chapter 20
Ten Most Commonly Asked
Questions about ETFs
In This Chapter
 Assessing risk
 Considering professional help
 Figuring out which ETFs make sense for you
O
h, it’s been fun writing a book about exchange-traded funds! Every time
someone asks me what I’m working on, and I say, “Exchange-Traded
Funds For Dummies,” I see the eyes glaze over, and then, inevitably, I’m asked
what the heck an ETF is. And so I explain (essentially reading them, from
memory, a few lines from this book’s Introduction). The next question I’m
asked is invariably one of the following.
Are ETFs Appropriate for
Individual Investors?
You bet they are. Although the name exchange-traded funds sounds highly
technical and maybe a little bit scary, ETFs are essentially friendly index
mutual funds with a few spicy perks. They are more than appropriate for
individual investors. In fact, given their low expense ratios, high tax effi-
ciency, and the ease with which you can use them to construct a diversified
portfolio, ETFs form the perfect building blocks for just about any individual
investor’s portfolio.

Are ETFs Risky?
That all depends.
Some ETFs are way riskier than others. It’s a question of what kind of ETF
we’re talking about. Most ETFs track stock indexes, and some of those stock
indexes — such as individual sectors of the U.S. economy, like technology
stocks, or the stock markets of emerging-market nations — can be extremely
volatile. Others track broader segments of the U.S. stock market, such as the
S&P 500. Those can be volatile, too, but less so. And yet others track bond
indexes. Those tend to be less volatile (and less potentially rewarding). One
ETF (ticker symbol SHY) tracks short-term Treasury bonds, and as such is
only a little bit more volatile than a money market.
Always remember when putting together a portfolio that a diversity of invest-
ments can temper risk. Although it seems freakily paradoxical, you can some-
times add a risky ETF to a portfolio (such as an ETF that tracks the price of a
basket of commodities, or the stocks of foreign small companies) and lower
your overall risk! How so? If the value of your newly added ETF tends to rise
as your other investments fall, that will lower the volatility of your entire
portfolio. (Financial professionals refer to this strange but sweet phenome-
non as modern portfolio theory.)
Do I Need a Financial Professional to Set
Up and Monitor an ETF Portfolio?
Do you need an auto mechanic to service your car? I don’t know. It depends on
both your particular skills and your inclination to spend a Sunday afternoon
getting greasy under the hood. Setting up a decent ETF portfolio, with the aid
of this book, is very much doable. You can certainly monitor such a portfolio,
as well. A professional, however, has special tools and (I hope) objectivity to
help you understand investment risk and construct a portfolio that fits you like
a glove, or at least a sock. A financial planner can also help you properly esti-
mate your retirement needs and plan your savings accordingly.
Do be aware that many investment “advisors” out there are nothing more than
salespeople in disguise. Don’t be at all surprised if you bump into a few who
express their disgust of ETFs! ETFs make no money for those salespeople who
make a living hawking expensive (often inferior) investment products. Your
best bet for good advice is to find a fee-only (takes no commissions) financial
planner. If you are more or less a do-it-yourselfer but simply wish for a little
guidance, try to find a fee-only who will work with you on an hourly basis.
286
Part V: The Part of Tens 

How Much Money Do I Need
to Invest in ETFs?
You can buy one share of any number of ETFs for as low as the price of a
share. But since you pay a commission to trade (I’d say the average trading
commission is about $15), buying one $20 share (and thus paying a 75 per-
cent commission) would hardly make good sense. Starting at about $3,000
perhaps, it may be worth investing in ETFs, but only if you plan to keep that
money invested for at least several years. Smaller amounts of money are best
invested in mutual funds (preferably low-cost index mutual funds), money
markets, or other instruments that incur no trading costs.
With Hundreds of ETFs to Choose
From, Where Do I Start?
The answer depends on your objective. If you are looking to round out an
existing portfolio of stocks or mutual funds, your ETF should complement
what already exists. Your goal is always to have a well-diversified collection
of investments. If you are starting to build a portfolio, you want to make sure
to include stocks and bonds and to diversify as much as is practical within
each of those two broad asset classes.
There is not much in the world of stocks that can’t be satisfied with ETFs.
Try to have both U.S. and international stock ETFs. And within the U.S. stock
arena, shoot to have large cap growth, small cap growth, large cap value,
and small cap value. (I explain these grid terms in Chapters 5 through 8.)
You can also diversify your ETFs by industry sector: consumer staples,
energy, financials, and so on. (See Chapter 9 for a discussion of sector
diversification.) Generally, I wouldn’t attempt to do both grid diversification
and sector diversification. That would call for an unwieldy number of holdings.
Although all ETFs are somewhat reasonably priced, some are more reasonably
priced than others. If you are going to pay 0.60 percent a year in operating
expenses for a certain ETF, you should have a good reason for doing so. Many
ETFs are available for under 0.30 percent, some for even less than 0.10 percent.
On the bond side of your portfolio, you can fill most of your needs with
Barclays iShares fixed-income ETFs. For certain kinds of bonds, such as 
tax-free munis and international bonds, you have to go with mutual funds or
individual securities — at least for now. I’m sure those ETFs will eventually
hit the market, too.
287
Chapter 20: Ten Most Commonly Asked Questions about ETFs

Where Is the Best Place
for Me to Buy ETFs?
I suggest setting up an account with a financial supermarket, such as Fidelity,
Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Charles Schwab, or TD AMERITRADE. Each of these
allows you to hold ETFs, along with other investments — such as mutual
funds or individual stocks or bonds — in one account.
Different financial supermarkets offer different services and charge different
prices depending on how much you have to invest, how often you trade, and
whether you do everything online or by phone. You need to do some shop-
ping to find the brokerage house that works best for you. I provide more sug-
gestions for shopping financial supermarkets in Chapter 3. You’ll find contact
information there; you’ll also see a listing of Web sites in Appendix B.
Is There an Especially Good
or Bad Time to Buy ETFs?
Nope, not really. Studies show rather conclusively that the stock and bond
markets (or any segment of the stock or bond markets) is just about as likely
to go up after a good day as it is after a bad day (week, month, year, or any
other piece of the calendar). Trying to time the market tends to be a fool’s
game — or, just as often, a game that some like to play with other people’s
money.
Do ETFs Have Any Disadvantages?
Because most ETFs follow an index, you probably won’t see your ETF (or any
of your index mutual funds) wind up number one on Wise Money magazine’s
list of Top Funds for the Year. (But you probably won’t find any of your ETFs
on the bottom of such a list, either.) The bigger disadvantage of ETFs is the
cost of trading them, although that cost should be minimal.
Building a well-diversified portfolio of ETFs — stocks, bonds, large cap, small
cap, U.S., international — may also seem to have the disadvantage that in any
year, some of your ETFs are going to do poorly. Just remember that next year
those particular investments, the ones that look so disgustingly dull right
now, may be the shiniest things in your portfolio.
288
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Does It Matter Which Exchange
My ETF Is Traded On?
No. The vast majority of ETFs are traded either on the American Stock
Exchange or the NASDAQ. It doesn’t matter in the slightest to you, the indi-
vidual investor. The cost of your trade is determined by the brokerage house
you do business with. The spread (the difference between the ask and buy
price) is determined by the volume of the ETF being traded. Regardless of
which exchange the ETF is being traded on, if the volume is small (such as
would be the case for, say, the iShares MSCI South Korea Fund), you may
want to place a limit order rather than a market order. I explain the different
kinds of orders in a sidebar in Chapter 2.
Which ETFs Are Best in My IRA, and
Which Are Best in My Taxable Account?
Generally, those investments that generate income — either interest or 
dividends — are best kept in a tax-advantaged retirement account, such as
your IRA or 401(k) plan. That would include any bond, REIT, or high-dividend
paying ETF. You’ll eventually need to pay income tax on any money you with-
draw from those accounts, but it is generally better to pay later than sooner.
In the case of a Roth IRA, which is often the best case of all, you will never
have to pay taxes on the earnings, the principal, what is in the account, or
what you withdraw. Try to put your ETFs that have the greatest potential for
growth into your Roth IRA.
Since retirement accounts generally require you to keep your money put until
age 591⁄2, anyone younger than that would want to keep all emergency money
in a non-retirement account.

Ten Mistakes Most Investors
(Even Smart Ones) Make
In This Chapter
 Paying and risking too much
 Selling too frequently
 Saving too little and expecting too much from the market
 Ignoring inflation and IRS rules
R
emember that personal investing course you took in high school?
Of course you don’t! Your high school never offered such a course. Chances
are that you’ve never taken such a course. Few have. And that lack of 
education — combined with a surfeit of cheesy and oft-advertised investment
industry products, plus an irresponsible and lazy financial press — leads
many investors to make some very costly mistakes.
Paying Too Much Money for
an Investment Product
Most investors pay way, way too much to middlemen who suck the lifeblood
out of portfolios, leaving many investors with little to show for their invest-
ments. By investing primarily in ETFs, you spare yourself and your family this
tragic fate. The typical ETF costs a fraction of what you would pay in yearly
management fees to a mutual fund company. You never pay any loads (high
commissions). And trading fees, as long as you’re not dealing in dribs and
drabs, should be minimal.

Failing to Properly Diversify
Thou shalt not put all thy eggs in one basket is perhaps the first commandment
of investing, but it is astonishing how many sinners there are among us. ETFs
allow for easy and effective diversification. By investing in ETFs rather than
individual securities, you have already made a great step in the right direc-
tion. Don’t blow it by pouring all your money into one ETF that represents a
single hot sector! To the extent possible, invest in the entire market: value,
growth, small cap, large cap, U.S., and international (see Part II). ETFs make
such diversification easy.
Taking on Inappropriate Risks
Some people take way too much risk, investing perhaps everything in highly
volatile technology or biotech stocks. But many people don’t take enough
risk, leaving their money to sit in secure but low-yielding money market funds
or, worse, in the vault of their local savings and loan. If you want your money
to grow, you may have to stomach some volatility. In general, the longer you
can tie your money up, the more volatile (risky) your portfolio can be. A port-
folio of ETFs can be amazingly fine-tuned to match your particular appropri-
ate level of risk and return.
Selling Out When the Going Gets Rough
It can be a scary thing, for sure, when your portfolio value drops 10 or 20 per-
cent. But if you invest in stock ETFs, that scenario is going to happen. It has
happened many times in the past; it will happen many times in the future.
That’s just the nature of the beast. If you sell when the going gets rough (as
many investors do), you lose the game. The stock market is resilient. Hang
tough. Bears are followed by bulls. Your portfolio — as long as you are well
diversified — will bounce back, given enough time.
Paying Too Much Attention
to Recent Performance
Many investors make a habit of bailing out of whatever market segment has
recently taken a dive. Conversely, they often look for whatever market seg-
ment has recently shot through the roof, and that’s the one they buy. Then,
when that market segment tanks, they sell once again. By forever buying high
and selling low, their portfolios dwindle over time to nothing.
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

When you build your portfolio, don’t overload it with last year’s ETF super-
stars. You don’t know what will happen next year. Stay cool. You may notice
that in this book, I do not include performance figures for any of the ETFs dis-
cussed (except in one or two circumstances to make a specific point). That
omission was intentional. Most of the ETFs I discuss are only a few years old,
and a few years’ returns tell you nothing. On the other hand, the indexes
tracked by certain ETFs go back decades. In those cases, I do provide
performance figures.
Not Saving Enough for Retirement
As opposed to spending, saving isn’t a whole lot of joy. But you can’t build a
portfolio out of thin air. If your goal is to one day be financially independent,
to retire with dignity, you probably need to build a nest egg equal to about 20
times your yearly budget. (More on that subject in Chapter 19.) Doing so
won’t be easy. It may mean saving 15 percent of your paycheck for several
decades. The earlier you start, the easier it will be.
Savings comes from the difference between what you earn and what you
spend. Remember that both are adjustable figures. One great way to save is
to contribute at least enough to your 401(k) plan at work to get your
employer’s full match. Do it! Another is to remember that material goodies do
not buy happiness. Honest. Psychologists have studied the matter, and their
findings are rather conclusive.
Having Unrealistic Expectations
of Market Returns
One reason many people don’t save enough is that they have unrealistic
expectations; they believe fervently that they are going to win the lottery or
(next best thing) earn 25 percent a year on their investments. The truth: The
stock market, over the past 75 years, has returned about 10 percent a year
before inflation and 7 percent a year after inflation. Bonds have returned
about half as much. A well-balanced portfolio, therefore, may have returned 7
or 8 percent before inflation and maybe 5 percent or so after inflation.
Five percent growth after inflation — with interest compounded every year —
isn’t too shabby. In 20 years time, an investment of $10,000 growing at 5 per-
cent will turn to $26,530 in constant dollars. With a very well-diversified portfo-
lio, leaning toward higher-yielding asset classes (see Part II), you may be able
to do a tad better. If you want to earn 25 percent a year, however, you are going
to have to take inordinate risk. And even then, I wouldn’t bank on it.
293
Chapter 21: Ten Mistakes Most Investors (Even Smart Ones) Make

Discounting the Damaging 
Effect of Inflation
No, a dollar certainly doesn’t buy what it used to. Think of what a candy
bar cost when you were a kid. Think of what you earned on your first job.
Remember when gas was 32 cents a gallon? Now look into the future, and
realize that your nest egg, unless wisely invested, will shrivel and shrink.
Historically, certain investments do a better job of keeping up with inflation
than others. Those investments, which include stocks, tend to be somewhat
volatile. It’s a price you need to pay, however, to keep the inflation monster at
bay. The world of ETFs includes many ways to invest in stocks. You may also
consider a position in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). The
iShares Lehman TIPS Bond Fund (TIP) tracks an index of TIPS. You can read
about TIPS in Chapter 12.
Not Following the IRS Rules
When they leave their jobs, many employees cash out their 401(k) accounts,
thereupon paying the IRS a stiff penalty and immediately losing the great ben-
efit of tax deferral. The government allows certain tax breaks for special
kinds of accounts, and you really need to play by the rules or you can wind
up worse off than had you never invested in the first place.
People over 701⁄2 must be especially careful to take the Minimum Required
Distributions from their IRAs or 401(k) plans. Calculators are available online;
simply type “MRD calculator” into your favorite search engine. Unlike a retire-
ment calculator, based on all kinds of assumptions, the MRD is a straight-
forward equation. Any online calculator can take you there. Or ask your
accountant.
Failing to Incorporate Investments
into a Broader Financial Plan
Have you paid off all your high-interest credit card debt? Do you have proper
disability insurance? Do you have enough life insurance so that, if necessary,
your co-parent and children could survive without you? A finely manicured
portfolio is only part of a larger picture that includes issues such as debt man-
agement, insurance, and estate planning. Don’t spend too much time tinkering
with your ETF portfolio and ignore these other very important financial issues.

Ten Forecasts about the Future of
ETFs and Personal Investing
In This Chapter
 Expecting slowed growth of the ETF market
 Anticipating more ETF products
 Fearing higher fees
 Considering the U.S. economy
I
try not to watch any of the investment shows on television. Stock
“Expert” Number One gives his prediction of the future. Then “Expert”
Number Two gives her (often contradictory) opinion. Viewers may be
amused by the heated debate but never know what to do in the end.
I also usually try not to make predictions about the future, but I’ll ask you to
please indulge me now. I can’t resist. It just seems like sooo much fun!
Here are my predictions, for whatever they are worth, about the world of ETFs.
ETFs Will Grow for Another Couple Years
Most people should be investing most of their money in index mutual funds
or ETFs, but I don’t see that happening — not now, not ever. The recent popu-
larity of ETFs is due largely to the interest of educated institutional investors
and a minority of savvy individual investors, like you.
The vast majority of investors will never, never give up their belief that they
can beat the market. They’ll try any which way they can. They will attend
pricey workshops that promise to teach them how to double their money
overnight. They will subscribe to newsletters and magazines telling them

which stocks or mutual funds to buy this week for sure-fire rapid apprecia-
tion. They will buy high-priced mutual funds and will actually pay a fat com-
mission for the honor of doing so.
That’s their problem, not yours.
More Players Will Enter the
Field, But Only a Few
Barclays, State Street, and Vanguard got the jump on ETFs, with others, like
PowerShares, Rydex, and WisdomTree, riding close behind. Other investment
houses will offer ETFs in time. Unlike the world of mutual funds, however, the
profit margin on ETFs is small, so I don’t think we’ll see hundreds of issuers
of ETFs, as we do mutual funds.
Investors Will Have More,
and Better, Options
There are currently black holes in the ETF universe: entire asset classes
unrepresented. I’m quite eager to see those holes filled, and I’m certain that
will happen before long.
By the time I write the second edition of this book, I suspect that we will see
an ETF for tax-free municipal bonds; several market-neutral ETFs (meaning
that, like hedge funds, they have little to no correlation to the broad stock
market, even though they may invest in stocks); at least a handful of small
cap international ETFs; international bond ETFs; a few more commodity
ETFs; and, in time, perhaps some asset classes that don’t even exist yet.
(Shuttlecraft and warp-drive production ETFs?)
Investors Will Get Suckered into
Buying More Bad Products
Alas, good ETFs can be turned into bad financial products. It’s already happen-
ing with some of the ETF offerings in 401(k) plans. In that case, perfectly good
ETFs are packaged in such a way that the investor (trapped like a fly in a bowl
of milk in his company’s plan) is paying as much as 3 percent in management
296
Part V: The Part of Tens 

fees. I’m sure that good ETFs will similarly pop up in crappy annuity plans, 529
college plans, and other investments where someone somewhere stands to
make a big buck off the small investor.
Brokers Will Find a Way
to Slap Loads on ETFs
They’ve tried before (with PowerShares), and they’ll try again. There’s nothing
as succulent to a broker as a fat upfront commission. The financial world will
not allow this juicy source of revenue to dry up as more people invest in ETFs.
The Markets Will (Unfortunately)
See Greater Correlation
As the world continues to become a smaller place, and the economies of
nations become yet more interdependent, so too will stock and bond markets
around the world tend to move up and down in unison. This is not a good
thing for investors because it lessens the power of diversification to mollify
risk. Investors will find a growing need to tap into alternative investments,
such as market-neutral funds. An expanded menu of ETFs will become an
important part of an alternative investment strategy.
Asset Class Returns Will Revert
Toward Their Historic Means
Astronomical rises in the price of energy (and oil company stocks), certain
commodities (silver, copper, gold), and residential real estate (San Francisco,
Long Island) cannot and will not continue. Neither will the seemingly perma-
nent leveling off in the sad price of large U.S. growth stocks. Or the pitiful
recent performance of long-term bonds. Large growth stocks will rise, and
commodities and energy stocks will fall, as we see these asset class returns
revert to their historical norms.
In terms of an ETF portfolio, this may be a good time to slightly underweight
energy and commodities and overweight large growth stocks. (Tilt your port-
folio oh-so-slightly because these are only one man’s predictions!) By the
time this book appears in print, of course, anything could have happened.
297
Chapter 22: Ten Forecasts about the Future of ETFs and Personal Investing

Taxes Will Rise
Let’s see . . . The United States has a raging federal deficit; an aging popula-
tion; a medical “system” (if you can even call it that) that has left millions
unable to pay for their doctor, dentist, and hospital bills; a sagging Social
Security system; and a seriously challenged public school system. Despite
huge tax cuts (mostly for the wealthy), these problems persist and worsen.
Sooner or later, something has to give.
I believe that future administrations will have no option but to raise taxes on
everyone. I advocate squirreling as much of your ETF portfolio into a tax-free
Roth IRA as you can. (And then pray that Congress doesn’t change the rules
on Roths.)
Inflation Will Remain Tame
Although I’m certainly concerned about inflation and recognize that it can
devastate a paycheck or a portfolio, I’m not too worried about a return to the
double-digit inflation of the 1980s. There is a reason that we saw double-digit
inflation back then: The United States decided to abandon the gold standard in
the 1970s, and the new monetary system was walking on its baby legs. I antici-
pate that inflation in the next decade or two will be similar to what it has been
in the past decade or two: somewhere in the ballpark of 3 percent. Protect
yourself with a good helping of stock ETFs (stocks have a pretty good track
record of keeping up with inflation) and a position in the iShares Lehman TIPS
Bond Fund (TIP), which tracks an index of U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities.
The Shelves of Bookstores Will
See More Books on ETFs!
Of all my predictions, this is the one I’d put money on.
I’m already seeing magazine articles with headings such as “Build Instant
Wealth and Retire Early with ETFs!” It’s only a matter of time before someone
decides to spin off one of these articles into a book. I suspect titles such as,
“Beat the Market with ETFs!” and “You Can Make a Killing in ETFs!” One of
them may become a bestseller, which means that it will make a lot of money
for someone — but not for the readers.

Great Web Resources to
Help You Invest in ETFs
You can find anything on the Web: gob and gobs of information — and
misinformation. And in the world of finance, there is more misinforma-
tion than information. If you pressed me, I’d put the ratio at 7:2. Following are
some Web sites you can trust to keep you informed about ETFs and other
investment issues.
Independent ETF-Specific Web Sites
www.etfconnect.com: Quotes, yields, and ETF nuts-n-bolts information
(expense ratios, performance records). A search function allows you to rum-
mage through the world of ETFs to find one that fits whatever criteria.
www.etfguide.com: A good, quick summary of the entire ETF world.
Contains a complete listing of all ETFs available, along with ticker symbols.
(The same list appears in Appendix A, although, naturally, the Web site’s will
be more up-to-date.)
www.etftrends.com: A gossip column of sorts for ETF enthusiasts. There’s
chit chat about new ETFs on the market, ETFs pending approval of the SEC,
behind-the-scenes industry workings, and rumors.
http://finance.yahoo.com/etf: Features a search function with inti-
mate details on individual funds, an ETF glossary, and regularly updated
news and commentary.
www.indexuniverse.com: See “Breaking News” for the most up-to-date
information on ETFs and index mutual funds. See the “Data” section to help
screen for ETFs of your liking.

www.morningstar.com (Click the ETF icon on blue bar at top of screen):
Thorough information on individual funds, along with Morningstar’s trade-
marked rating system. (One star is bad, five stars is grand.)
www.nasd.com: The National Association of Securities Dealers. “Mutual Fund
Expense Analyzer” is a great tool that allows you to see the impact of operat-
ing fees on a fund’s total return over time.
Web Sites of ETF Providers
Ninety-nine percent of all ETFs come from one of the following ten product
lines.
The biggies
www.ishares.com: Barclays iShares. The British-based company dominates
the ETF market, especially in the international stock and fixed-income arenas.
www.spdrindex.com: The SPDRs are issued by State Street Global Advisors
(SSgA) and track broad indexes as well as industry sector indexes.
www.streettracks.com: SSgA’s sister ETFs.

ETFs.
Smaller players
www.bldrsfunds.com: Inexpensive, straight, and simple international 
offerings.
www.holdrs.com: Industry sectors galore.
www.powershares.com: A host of unusual indexes, for better or worse.
www.proshares.com: ETFs for a wild ride.

you didn’t realize it, there is an entire movement out there devoted to finan-
cial independence. Use this Web site as your entry point. You find what is
arguably the best retirement calculator on the Web, along with an Early
Retirement Forum where other Fire fans passionately discuss their strategies.

www.vanguard.com: Or telephone Vanguard at 1-800-662-7447.
Stock Exchanges
www.amex.com: Almost half of all ETFs are listed on the American Stock
Exchange (AMEX). It’s a bland Web site, but it provides all the ETF basics.
www.nasdaq.com: Despite the fact that not many ETFs are listed on the
NASDAQ, the Web site has some very cool ETF-related things. Check out
especially the “ETF Dynamic Heatmap.”
www.nyse.com: Those ETFS that aren’t listed on the AMEX are by and large
traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Surprisingly, there isn’t a lot of ETF
information on the Web site, but there is a wealth of general information
about the world of finance.

Appendix C
Glossary
I
f you’re going to be an ETF investor, you need to know the lingo. If you’re
not going to be an ETF investor, you can still use the following phrases to
impress at cocktail parties and Republican fundraising events. Please note
that any word in italics (except for the word italics) appears as its own entry
elsewhere in the glossary.
Active investing. Ah, to beat the market. Isn’t it every investor’s dream?
Through stock picking or market timing, or both strategies, active investing
offers hope of market-beating returns. Alas, it sounds a lot easier than it
really is. Compare to passive investing.
Alpha. Given a certain level of risk, you should expect a certain rate of
return. If your stock/fund/portfolio return exceeds that expectation, 
congratulations! — you’ve just achieved what people in the finance world 
call “positive Alpha.” Pass the caviar. If your stock/fund/portfolio return falls
shy of that expectation, you are in the dark and depressing land of “negative
Alpha.” Pass the herring.
Ask price. It’s the rock-bottom price that any stock or ETF seller is willing to
accept. If any buyer is willing to fork over that amount, a sale is made. If no
buyers are willing to match the ask price, gravity will eventually start to drag
down the price of the stock. Compare to bid price and spread.
Asset class. To build a diversified portfolio (meaning not have all your eggs in
one flimsy straw basket), you want to have your investments spread out
among different asset classes. An asset class is any group of similar invest-
ments. Examples may include small value stocks, utility stocks, high-yield
bonds, Japanese small company stocks, or Rembrandts (paintings, not the
toothpaste).
Beta. A common measurement of the volatility of an investment. If your ETF
has a beta of 1.5, it tends to move up 15 percent whenever the market as a
whole (usually represented, somewhat clumsily, by the S&P 500 Index) goes
up 10 percent. If the market as a whole goes down 10 percent, your ETF will
fall 15 percent. Note that beta is a relative measure of risk, while standard
deviation (a generally more useful tool) is an absolute measure of risk.

Bid price. The highest price that any buyer is willing to spend to purchase
shares of a stock or ETF. Compare to ask price and spread.
Cap size. A less fancy way of saying “market capitalization.” It refers to the
size of a company as measured by the total number of stock outstanding
times the market price of each share. In general, stocks are classified as
either large cap (over $5 billion), small cap (under $1 billion), or mid cap
(anything in between).
Closet index fund. A mutual fund may call itself actively managed and may
charge you a boatload of money, but it may be, in essence, an index fund.
Shhhhhh. The manager doesn’t want to come out of the closet, lest he lose
his excuse for charging you what he charges you and be forced to surrender
the keys to the Mercedes.
Correlation. The degree to which two investments — such as two ETFs —
move up and down at the same time. A correlation of 1 means that the two
investments move up and down together, like the Rockettes. A correlation of
–1 means that when one goes up, the other goes down, like two pistons. A
correlation of 0 means that there is no correlation between the two, like the
price of bananas and the Philadelphia Eagles.
Diversification. It means dividing your investments into different asset
classes with limited correlation. Diversification is good. Very good. ETFs make
it easy. Did I already mention that diversification is good?
EAFE index. EAFE stands for Europe, Australia, and Far East. This index is
often used (incorrectly) to represent foreign stocks. What it really tracks are
large cap stocks of developed foreign nations.
Emerging markets. This is a common euphemism for “countries where most
people live on rice and corn.” People who invest in emerging markets hope
that these nations (mostly in Africa, South America, and Asia) are, in fact,
emerging. No one knows. The fortunes of emerging market stocks are closely
tied to the markets for natural resources. Emerging market ETFs tend to be
rather volatile, but offer excellent return possibilities.
Expense ratio. Sometimes referred to as the “management fee,” this is a
yearly bill you pay to a mutual fund or ETF. The money is taken directly out of
your account. The expense ratio for ETFs is usually much, much less than
that of mutual funds. If the expense ratio for your entire portfolio is more
than 1 percent, you’re paying too much.
Fundamental analysis. If you’re going to be picking stocks, it makes sense, 
I suppose, to do some fundamental analysis: an analysis of the company’s
profitability both present and future. Just know that fundamental analysis is
an awfully fuzzy science. And, ironically, the strongest, fastest-growing com-
panies don’t always make for the most profitable stocks. See value premium.

Part VI: Appendixes 

Growth fund. A fund that invests in stocks of companies that have been fast-
growing and are expected (by fundamental analysts) to continue to be fast-
growing. In its day, Enron was a growth stock. You never know . . .
Indexing. This term is synonymous with passive investing. Index investing
has been around for a good while; ETFs simply make it easier, less expensive,
and more tax efficient.
iShares. This is the brand name for ETFs issued by Barclays, the largest pur-
veyor of ETFs in the world. Roughly half the money invested in ETFs is
invested in iShares.
Liquidity. A liquid asset can readily be turned into cash. Examples include
money market funds and very short-term bond funds. Illiquid assets are trick-
ier things to turn into cash. The classic example of an illiquid asset is the
family home.
Load. A wad of cash that you need to fork over in order to purchase certain
mutual funds. Study after study shows that load funds perform no better than
no-load funds, yet people are willing to pay rather huge loads. Go figure. ETFs
never charge loads. Gotta love that about them.
Modern Portfolio Theory. It says that a portfolio doesn’t have to be exces-
sively risky, even if its separate components are riskier than skydiving with-
out a parachute. The trick is to fill your portfolio with investments that have
low correlation to one another. When one crashes, another soars — or at
least hovers.
Passive investing. You buy an index of stocks (preferably through an ETF),
and you hold them. And you hold them. And you hold them. It’s as boring as
a game of bingo in which none of the letters called are the ones you need.
And yet passive investors beat the pants off most active investors, year in
and year out.
Price/earnings ratio (P/E). Take a company’s total earnings over the past 12
months and divide that by the number of shares of stock outstanding. The
resulting number represents earnings, the lower number in the equation.
Price — the upper number — refers to the market price of the stock. The P/E
is the most common way in which stocks are identified as either value stocks
or growth stocks. High P/E = growth. Low P/E = value.
Qubes. A nickname for the QQQ, an index that tracks the top 100 companies
listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. QQQQ is the ticker for the most popu-
lar ETF that tracks the QQQ. Why QQQQ and not QQQ? I don’t knowww.

Appendix C: Glossary

REIT stock/fund. A stock or fund that invests in a company or companies
that make their money in real estate — most often commercial real estate,
such as office buildings and shopping malls. REIT funds tend to be interest-
rate sensitive and often have limited correlation to other funds.
Risk. When we investment types talk of risk, we generally mean but one
thing: volatility, or the unpredictability of an investment. The higher the risk,
the greater the potential return.
R squared. This measurement shows how tightly an investment hugs a cer-
tain index. An R squared of .90 means that 90 percent of a fund’s movement is
attributable to movement in the index to which it is most similar. For an
index fund or ETF, an R squared of 1.00 is usually the goal. For an allegedly
actively managed fund, an R squared of 1.00 (or anything higher than .85 or
so) means that you have a closet index fund, and you are being ripped off.
Sector investing. If you break up your stock portfolio into different industry
sectors — energy, consumer staples, financials — then you are a sector
investor, as opposed to a style investor.
Sharpe ratio. A risk-adjusted measure of fund performance. In other words, it
measures a fund’s average historical return per unit of risk. The higher the
number, the happier you should be.
Sophisticated investor. Often mistaken for someone who trades every day
and is constantly checking his account balance. Or someone who uses 
charts and graphs and tries to time the markets. In the real world, such
“sophisticated” investors rarely do as well as the “dummy” who builds a 
well-diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds (such as ETFs) and lets it 
sit undisturbed.
SPDRs. This is the nickname for most of the ETFs issued by State Street
Global Advisors (SSgA), the second-largest purveyor of ETFs after Barclays.
(SSgA also issues streetTRACKS ETFs.)
Spread. The difference between the ask price and bid price for a stock or ETF.
Standard deviation. The most used measure of volatility in the world of
investments. The formula is long and complicated with lots of Greek symbols.
Suffice to say this: A standard deviation of 5 means that roughly two-thirds of
the time, your investment returns will fall within 5 percentage points of the
mean. So if your ETF has an historical mean return of 10 percent, two-thirds
of the time you can expect to see your returns fall somewhere between 5 per-
cent and 15 percent. If your ETF has an historical mean return of 5 percent,
two-thirds of the time you can expect your return to be somewhere between
0 percent and 10 percent.
322
Part VI: Appendixes 

streetTRACKS. The name of one of two lineups of ETFs issued by State Street
Global Advisors. (The other is SPDRs.)
Style investing. If you divvy up your stock investments into large, small,
value, and growth, you are a style investor, as opposed to a sector investor.
Which is better? Hard to say.
Style drift. It’s 11 p.m. Do you know where your investments are? A manager
of an active mutual fund tells you that her fund is, say, a large growth fund.
And perhaps it once was. But lately, this gal has been loading up on large
value companies. Is she a growth investor or a value investor? Only she
knows for sure. Investors, meanwhile, get stuck with her style drift and aren’t
sure exactly what they are holding. See transparency.
Tax efficiency. ETFs are often praised for their tax efficiency. That means the
funds generate little in the way of capital gains, so you pay only taxes on divi-
dends until such time as you actually cash out. With many mutual funds, you
can wind up paying taxes at the most inopportune moments.
Tax-loss harvesting. Late in the year (most often), you can sell off a losing
investment in order to claim a loss on your taxes. You can usually use tax
losses to wipe out capital gains of the same amount. If your losses exceed
your gains, you can generally take the loss to wipe out ordinary income, up
to $3,000. In effect, Uncle Sam is helping to share the burden of your woes.
Technical analysis. The use of charts and graphs to try to predict the stock
market. Some people take it very, very seriously — despite a lack of any evi-
dence that it works.
Ticker. The two- to five-letter symbol used for a stock, mutual fund, or ETF.
Examples include SPY, QQQQ, and EWJ. Heck, there’s even one called DOG
(but none yet with the ticker GOD).
Transparency. ETFs are beautifully transparent, which means that you know
exactly what stocks or bonds your ETF holds. The same is not always true
with mutual funds, hedge funds, or your spouse’s safe deposit box.
Turnover. The degree to which a fund changes its investments over the
course of a year. A turnover rate of 100 means that the fund starts and ends
the year with a completely different set of stocks. Turnover generally creates
unpleasant tax liabilities for investors. Turnover, almost always, also involves
hidden trading costs.
Value fund. A mutual fund or ETF that invests in companies whose recent
growth may be less than eye-popping, but whose stock prices are believed to
be cheap in comparison to the prices of stocks of other like companies.
323
Appendix C: Glossary

Value premium. Over the past century or so, ever since the birth of orga-
nized stock markets, value stocks have performed much better than growth
stocks, with relatively the same degree of risk. Theories abound. But to date,
economists can’t seem to agree why this apparent value premium exists, or
whether it is likely to continue.
Volatility. Whoooeee. What goes up fast often comes down just as fast. A
stock or ETF that gained 40 percent last year can lose 40 percent this year. It
is volatile. It is risky. It can bring you great joy or great misery. Hope for the
former, but be prepared for the latter.
Yield. This term is most often used to mean the income derived from an
investment over the past 12 months, as a percentage of the total investment.
Income may come from dividends (most often the case with stocks or stock
ETFs) or interest (from a bond or bond ETF). If you sink $10,000 into an ETF
and it generates $500 in yearly income, your yield is 5 percent. If it generates
$600, your yield is 6 percent, and so on.
YTD. Year-to-date return, or the total return (dividends plus any rise in the
price of the stock or ETF) from January 1 of the present year until today —
whatever day today is.
