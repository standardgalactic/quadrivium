Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 

Introduction
D
o-it-yourselfers are a new breed of smart people who like to do it them-
selves. Picking up this book includes you in the breed and makes you one 
of those smart people. In this case, you’re interested in doing your own painting.
We already know that as a do-it-yourselfer, you’re brainy, and you have a can-do
attitude and a strong desire to save time, money, and energy doing it right the first
time. We’re here to help by offering you solid advice, showing you instructional
photos, and cheering you on as you strive toward your goal.
This book gives you the best info in easy-to-get, can’t-go-wrong bytes. We want you
to get the best, professional-level outcome the very first time you take a roller to the
wall. To that end, we give you all the basics from deciding what, when, and where to
paint to finding out how to fix your projects when things go wrong. In no time at all,
you’ll be able to tackle any painting project in this book with efficiency, accuracy,
and confidence.
About This Book
Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies is here to help you make your living space 
look like it received a makeover. Whether you’re looking for a subtle makeover to
enhance what you already have, or an extreme makeover to show the world a totally
new look, you can find something to suit your style in this book. We show you how
to prep your painting surface, and we give you the best in painting basics. Then we
give you plenty of ideas for your walls, floors, and ceilings. A great color here, a little
pattern there, and a whole lot of best practice painting techniques help create the
ideal backdrop for your lifestyle.
This book breaks the projects down step by step and shows you the painting tech-
niques that produce the best results. The stepwise approach is what sets this (do-it-
yourself how-to) apart from the pack. Stepwise keeps your tasks on track.
You’ve heard the expression that a picture is worth a thousand words. To that end,
we include more than 400 photographs and illustrations in this book. Seeing is
believing — that sounds familiar, too — and it’s also the quickest way to convey the
most information. People learn well by observing, and we believe it’s a better way
than trial and error. If you want the positive reinforcement of living in a nicely
painted room and not the punishment of smudges, drips, and ugly surfaces, read on!
We share the expert experience that we acquired while on the job in our own homes,
in clients’ homes, on movie sets, and in photography studios. We did the trial-and-
error work so that you don’t have to. In this book, we help you pick the right colors
and the right tools for the job. We show you how to use the proper techniques so
that you don’t have to undo and redo. Your results, we can say with assurance, will
meet and maybe even exceed your expectations.

Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
To make reading this book as easy as possible, we use the following conventions:

We italicize new terms and provide a definition for them.

We use monofont to identify all Web sites and e-mail addresses.

We bold the keywords in bulleted lists.

In Chapter 1, we introduce and describe all the tools you need for all the
projects in this book. Flip to Chapter 1 whenever you need to know a tool’s
purpose, how to use it, or what it looks like, and for any cleaning or mainte-
nance tips.

We include extra tips and other interesting information in shaded sidebars
throughout the chapters. This information is typically related to the step-
by-step instructions for a nearby project.
Foolish Assumptions
We know what they say about making assumptions, but we made a few about you,
the reader, before we started writing this book. We assume that you’re a smart
person who wants professional-level know-how without spending a whole lot of
time, effort, and money to learn. Can you see yourself in one of the following groups?

First-time painters. Never picked up a brush or roller in your life? Find out
which brush or roller you need, how much time you’ll have to spend, and
what to expect from the painting process.

Timid painters. Sure, you can paint any room a solid neutral color. But
you’re not so confident about painting bold colors or using faux finishing
techniques. Glance at the photos in this book — is one of those exciting
projects calling your name? We take the mystery out of using rags, sponges,
colorwashes, glazes, and more, and you end up releasing your timidity and
getting a fresh new look for your favorite rooms.

Do-it-yourselfers seeking better information. You’ve painted. You’ve gotten
less than stellar results. You realize that you just need to keep on painting.
But, wait — you also realize that maybe you need a little more information
about better techniques, top tools, and marvelous materials to make your
next painting project outstanding.
If you fit into one of these groups — or if you’d like to fit into one of these groups —
this book is for you! You’re the do-it-yourselfer we had in mind as we painstakingly
chose the projects for this book, wrote the text, took the photos, and put it all
together. And now the finished product is in your hands just waiting to be read,
broken in, and most likely spattered with paint.

How This Book Is Organized
We organize the chapters in Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies into four parts. Each
part deals with a broad phase of painting, and each chapter targets specific informa-
tion in detail.
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project
Always be prepared. Hey, that may not be the most original advice you’ve ever
heard, but what does it take to be prepared? Here’s the skinny on how to plan your
design, pick paint, buy your brushes and supplies, and plan out your job. We walk
you through taping, priming, and everything else you need to do to prepare your
room. We show you how to make repairs so that you’re painting on the best possible
surface, and — if you’re tired of drips and other mishaps — we give you a quick tour
through the painting basics.
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro
Have you ever walked into a house, taken a look at the paint on the walls, and won-
dered, “How’d they do that?” If you’re ready to move beyond a basic, solid paint
color for your walls, this is the section for you. We show you how to use everyday
items like rags, bags, and sponges to create a unique finish on your walls. If you’re
interested in stripes, stencils, or blocks of colors (in random or checkerboard pat-
terns), we give you step-by-step instructions to liven up your living space. In no
time, you’ll be painting your walls like a pro.
Part III: Covering Other Areas of Your Home
When you master the art of painting your walls, you may be ready to focus your
attention on other areas of your home. Check out our tips on painting your ceiling,
improving the look of your wood floors, and sprucing up your trim.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Want to know more? Ten things more to be exact? This part includes all those tips
and pointers that can make a difference in your painting project. The Part of Tens
gives you quick and easy advice on choosing great colors and making your project
perfect.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
As you read through the book, you’ll see icons — little pictures in the margins —
that alert you to important information. Whenever you see an icon, look and learn!
The Tip icon flags bits of time- and hassle-saving information.
This sign reminds you to take a mental note.
This emblem lets you know what and where the pitfalls are.
Where to Go from Here
If you’re the kind of person who reads every book cover to cover, get started! If
you’re the kind of person who just wants to get to the good parts, feel free to peruse
the projects that interest you. This book is designed to be a resource, almost like an
encyclopedia or a dictionary. You can go straight to the part that’s most relevant to
you. You can flip to a topic that you want to know about. You can scan the table of
contents to find a section, or go to the index to find out about one item. If you’re not
sure what tools you need to do the job, start with Chapter 1. If you need to brush up
on painting basics, head to Chapter 4. And if you’re looking for inspiration, check out
any chapter in Parts II and III. No matter where you go, enjoy the painting process
and the excellent results you’re sure to get!

Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 

Part I
Preparing for Your 
Painting Project

In this part . . .
You’re probably eager to get started on one of the
painting projects shown in this book. You may even
be tempted to skip over this part and focus solely on the
fun stuff. Wait! Before you flip toward the later sections in
this book, you need to go over the important points in this
part. Trust us, putting a lovely coat of paint or a faux finish
on an ill-prepared wall isn’t what you want.
In this part, we give you the basic info on the tools you
need to have on hand before you get started. We show you
how to prep your room or surface before painting, and we
walk you through those necessary repairs. Finally, we go
over the painting basics — refer to them early and often
for best painting project results.

Chapter 1
Gathering What You Need
In This Chapter
 Gathering the tools you need
 Selecting the best paint for your job
 Figuring out how much paint you need
Y
ou’ll save time and energy if you assemble the essential tools for your paint
project before you crack open a paint can. Nothing’s worse than leaving a
partially wet wall, for instance, to get a tool you forgot. That’s especially true if
you’re using latex paint (formulated to dry quickly and often within an hour)
because when you get back, you won’t be able to blend your next brush strokes
with the dry paint, and those transitions will be obvious when you finish the job. 
To ensure that you don’t find yourself in that position, make a list of everything 
you need — tools, paint products, cleanup supplies, and so on — and gather it all
before you begin.
This chapter makes the task easy by listing and describing tools for safety and for
prepping and repairing your project. We also tell you what to think about when
selecting sealer, primer, and paint, including information on basic painting tools,
such as brushes, rollers, and roller covers, and specialized tools for decorative paint
finishes. In addition, you can find items to help make cleanup much more simple.
Assembling a Painter’s Toolbox
A carpenter wouldn’t start a job without having a saw, hammer, level, and other
tools on hand. Likewise, you can eliminate frustration and delays while you’re work-
ing if you assemble the right stuff ahead of time. These sections list all the tools and
supplies you’ll need, whether your paint project is simple or complex. And while
you’re making that list in preparation for the shopping trip, think about what you
already have at home or what you have access to — at your parents’ and friends’
houses, for example.
Consider which items will likely serve you time and time again, such as putty knives,
levels, stud finders, paintbrushes, and rollers, to name a few. It makes sense to look
for quality when you’re buying those multi-use tools. Quality doesn’t necessarily
mean paying top dollar either. Home improvement stores stock quality tools and sell
them at a range of moderate prices. Your best bet is to buy the best one that you can
afford.

8
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
Tools for safety
When you’re working on household projects, such as painting a room, the old maxim
“Better safe than sorry” is a good rule to follow. Preventing an accident or avoiding a
health hazard is easier than recovering from it. So resist the temptation not to pur-
chase safety equipment just to save money. Some safety tools, such as a ladder and
scaffolding, are a long-term investment. Buy the best equipment that you can afford
because you’ll be using these items over and over again. For your overall health, and
especially if you have allergies or are sensitive to strong chemicals, you won’t want
to skimp on the low-cost items either. See the following list and Figure 1-1 for details
about safety items:

5- or 6-foot stepladder: For working on or near the ceiling

Breathing mask: Blocks dust and fumes from getting into your lungs

Goggles: Keep paint, chemicals, dust, and dirt out of your eyes

Kneepads: Think 40 years down the line — your knees will thank you then

Latex gloves: Prevent contact allergies and speed up the cleanup process —
they also protect your nails

Long-sleeved, loose fitting shirt and jeans or slacks: Keep chemicals and
other irritants off your skin

Painter’s cap: Protects your hair

Scaffolding: Not essential for an indoor project, such as painting a room,
but nice to have, especially when you’re painting vaulted ceilings or giving
the walls a faux finish (see the nearby sidebar on scaffolding for more 
information)
Figure 1-1: These safety items are essential for a do-it-yourselfer.

Tools for prep and repairs
Improvising and doing your project with items you have around the house may be
possible. But tools designed for the task make the job easier and more time efficient.
You can find the items you need for prep and repair work at hardware stores, home
improvement centers, and discount stores, mostly for a relatively low cost. You may
want to consider borrowing or renting more expensive items, such as a wallboard
saw and wallboard screw gun.
The following tools come in handy when you’re ready to prep your room prior to
painting:

Chemical stripper: This product removes old, damaged paint.

Denatured alcohol: Use this product to clean up oil-based paint.

Electronic level: Use this level to help you find plumb lines when you’re
painting stripes on a wall or straightening pictures.
9
Chapter 1: Gathering What You Need
Ladder safety
The best, sturdiest ladders will send you
tumbling to the ground if you don’t follow
these basic safety precautions when you’re
using one:
 Never, ever lean out to the side or try to
brush some paint on a spot you missed
that’s just out of reach.
 Don’t climb up onto the top rung or step.
The top rungs are meant for handholds,
not feet.
 If the ladder feels unstable, have a
buddy hold it steady for you.
 Never step on the drop-down shelf on
stepladders; the shelf is designed for
holding paint buckets and tools, not
people.
Scaffolding: Buy, rent, or make your own
When you’re painting a ceiling or doing faux
finishes, scaffolding is great. With a scaffold,
you can move around much more easily
because you don’t have to climb up and
down a ladder to move it a foot or two. You
don’t have to worry about falling off a step
or constantly moving tools or paint supplies
on and off the drop-down shelf. You can
build scaffolding by placing a 12-inch wide
plank on two sawhorses or stepladders (just
be sure to allow enough overhang on each
side as a precaution to keep the plank in
place). Or you can buy a scaffold that has
hinges and folds up on itself for easy stor-
age. If you don’t think you’ll use the scaffold
often enough to justify the expense, con-
sider borrowing or renting one. Most hard-
ware and home improvement stores have
all kinds of rental equipment available for
do-it-yourselfers working on home improve-
ment projects.


Etching acid: Use this acid to prep the surface of concrete floors for 
painting.

Large bucket: Fill with water and detergent for scrubbing surfaces.

Laundry bleach: Bleach removes mold and mildew spores from your walls
before you paint.

Primer: This is a good undercoat for paint.

Screwdriver: As always, you need one for fastening screws.

Sealer: Use this item when you want to keep damaged areas from bleeding
through your paint finish.

Sponge: When you’re scrubbing surfaces, you’ll need a sponge. You also use
them to create several faux finishes.

Sponge mop: Use this tool to clean floors before painting them.

TSP cleanser: This heavy-duty cleanser cleans surfaces without leaving
residue.

Utility knife: This knife is also known as a razor knife. You can use it for 
cutting wallpaper, scoring walls, cleaning up ragged edges on drywall, 
and dozens of other tasks. As the blade dulls, simply replace it with another.
Just keep the knife and blades where children won’t find them — they’re
super sharp. (See Figure 1-2 for an example.)

Vacuum cleaner and brush attachment: Try this tool for an easy way to
remove dust and debris.

Wallpaper remover solution: This solution loosens glue from the wallpaper
backing and from the wall.

Sometimes you need to repair your walls before you can prep and paint. In those
instances, you may need the following tools:

Broad knife: When you’re patching plaster, try a broad knife. Unless you
plan to patch walls and ceilings throughout your home, borrow a broad
knife from a family member or a friend. If that’s not possible, go ahead and
buy one. They aren’t expensive, even if they sit on a shelf for the next 50
years. (See Figure 1-3 for a picture of a broad knife.)

Figure 1-3: A small putty knife and a broad knife are good repair tools.

Drywall mud and tape: Use these two items to seal seams between patches
and the wall.

Electric mixer: Not just for baking; use just one beater for mixing plaster
when you’re repairing small cracks and holes.

Masonry chisel: This tool helps you repair cracks in plaster or take grout
from between tiles. (Refer to Figure 1-2 to see an example.)

Patching compound: Use this compound to fill in holes and dents.

Putty knife: Use this knife to apply patching compounds. A small putty
knife can be used for so many tasks — other than putty — that it should be
a household staple. (Check out Figure 1-3 to see how this knife compares to
a broad knife.)

Sandpaper/sanding block: Whenever you use patching compounds to fill in
holes or have imperfections or blemishes on an area, you have to make the
surface smooth again before painting. Various grits of sandpaper will do the
trick. A sanding block isn’t necessary, but using one makes the job easier 
on your fingers and hands. One block will last forever. (See Figure 1-4 for a
sanding block with sandpaper.)
Figure 1-4: Steel wool pads, sanding block with sandpaper, and a tack cloth.

Chapter 1: Gathering What You Need


Steel wool pads: Like sandpaper, this tool also works to smooth a surface.
Because steel wool has a variety of uses, such as cleaning a grill, keep a
supply on hand. (Figure 1-4 shows you an example of steel wool pads.)

Tack cloth: This tool wipes up dust without scattering it and removes other
residue when you’re done with a project. (Refer to Figure 1-4 for an example.)

Trim shellac or sealer: Use these materials to keep wood stains from bleed-
ing through new paint.

Wood filler: This filler is handy for patching holes and imperfections.
Tools for basic painting
A brush is a brush, and a roller is a roller, right? Not quite. Paintbrushes come in var-
ious sizes and shapes, and with different handles. You also have to decide what kind
of bristles you want and at what cost. Roller cages (the skeletal frame that includes
the handle and “ribs” that rotate) and their covers come in several lengths. You have
to select the length of the nap on covers and what it’s made of. You find helpful infor-
mation about selecting the right tool for your project on the packaging, and you can
ask a salesperson for help. And check out the overviews of paintbrushes and rollers
in this chapter.
You can choose the size of a brush and its shape, such as tapered or flat-bottomed,
according to the job it’s designed for. The smaller brushes, called trim or sash
brushes, come in 1- to 3-inch widths. They’re intended for use in small, tight spaces,
and if the bristles are tapered, you can expect them to get into corners and grooves
much more easily than a flat-bottomed brush of the same size. Likewise, wider
brushes (called paint or wall brushes) come in 3- to 5-inch widths and are designed
for painting large flat surfaces. As you increase the width of the brush, you compro-
mise control and precision. Handles are made of wood or plastic and have different
shapes. Get a handle that feels comfortable in your hand. If you’re using latex paint,
select a brush that has synthetic bristles. Listed here are some of your choices (see
Figure 1-5 for examples):

1-inch angled sash brush: Choose one with a stubby handle to paint edges
and trim. They’re also available with flat ends and longer handles.

2-inch angled sash brush: This brush is used for cutting in corners and
edges, and painting narrow window sashes and sills.

3-inch flat bristle sash brush: We recommend the regular handle; use it for
wide trim and sashes.

3-inch wall brush: Use this one for floors, walls, and ceilings.

Small chip brush: Use this brush to get paint into tight corners and spaces.

Chapter 1: Gathering What You Need
Figure 1-5: A 2-inch angled sash brush, a small chip brush, and a 3-inch flat sash brush.
Rollers are available in mini to 12-inch (and bigger) sizes. The mini (or trim) rollers
are good for painting woodwork and other small areas. To work on walls and ceil-
ings, choose a 9-inch roller; the larger sizes are heavier and will make you tire more
quickly. A roller cage with plastic ribs holds up better than cardboard cages. Plastic
can be cleaned, and it lasts longer than a cheaper version. As with bristles on a
paintbrush, roller nap is made from natural or synthetic fibers. Nap is available in
various lengths, so use the one recommended for the surface you’re painting. In gen-
eral, the longer the nap, the more paint it will hold. See Figure 1-6 to see some differ-
ences among rollers, and as a guideline, use

1⁄4-inch nap for smooth or fine surfaces, such as new walls, ceilings, wood
doors, and trim

3⁄8-inch nap for smooth to light-textured walls

1⁄2-inch nap for most walls and medium rough surfaces, such as textured
plaster, and concrete

3⁄4-inch nap for rough surfaces, such as textured walls and ceilings, textured
plaster, and concrete
If you want a general-purpose roller cover, select a 3⁄8- or 1⁄2-inch nap.

Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
Selecting the best sealing and priming products
Sometimes sealing and priming isn’t an
either-or choice; your project may require
both coats. People often use sealer and
primer interchangeably, but they don’t do
the same job. Go to a paint specialist and
explain what you want to do and any prob-
lems you have with the surface. Ask 
for advice and a low cost solution. In the
meantime, here’s the essential information
about sealers, primers, and sealer/primer
combinations.
Sealers keep stains, smoke, and soot on
previously painted walls from bleeding
through freshly applied paint. They seal the
surface of soft and hard wood trim, hiding
knot holes and stains. They also prevent tex-
tured ceilings from soaking up too much
paint. Sealers are formulated for many dif-
ferent surfaces and to handle specific prob-
lems, so you have to find the right one.
Prices vary depending on the formula. 
You may be able to opt for a combination
sealer/primer, as we explain later in this
sidebar.
It takes two coats of paint to make your
walls look best. Use a primer as the first
coat. Primers coat surfaces — walls, wood-
work, trim, ceilings — so that the finish
coats of paint adhere to the surfaces. They
enhance the paint by providing a toothy sur-
face that paint can stick to, helping to ensure
even and smooth finish-coat coverage.
Previously painted walls can act as a primer,
but don’t rely on the old paint if it’s marred
or if it’s glossy paint and you want to use a
latex eggshell or flat finish. On unpainted
walls — plaster, Sheetrock (also called dry-
wall), wood — the first coat soaks in and the
second coat gives the wall the richness it
deserves in the color you expect. You can do
the wall twice in the finish coat, but that
entails needless expense since finish paint
costs more than primer. So use a primer for
the first coat, and then paint over it with one
coat of quality finish paint.
Even if you’re working on a previously
painted surface, you may need to prime,
especially if bright or dark colors (think
bright reds, black, and some shades of
green) have been used. Primers can be
tinted to provide a helpful color base if
you’re going over bright or dark colors. You
can add mildewcides and moldicides to
primers when you’re painting high-moisture
areas, such as bathrooms, kitchen back-
splashes, laundry rooms, or even condo
hallways in hurricane-prone areas.
When you go to the store to get your mate-
rials, let the salesperson know if you plan to
do more than one thing — such as walls and
woodwork — and ask whether a universal
primer or combination sealer/primer would
work best. Purchasing just one product
reduces cost and eliminates the potential of
storing several half-empty cans on a shelf.
A combination sealer/primer may be more
expensive than getting an inexpensive can
of sealer and a cheap primer, but you’ll save
time.

The brush and roller are the most obvious tools you need for basic painting. But the
following items are also helpful:

1-quart plastic paint bucket or container with lid: Use one of these to mix
and store paint. Smaller paint buckets or containers that have lids come in
handy for storing leftover paint. 

1- or 2-gallon household bucket: Use these buckets to mix acid and water
to etch concrete floors. If you’re doing a faux finish, these buckets are great
for mixing paint and glazes.

5-gallon bucket with a roller screen: You can use this item for distributing
paint on the cover rather than constantly refilling a flat roller tray. 

5-in-1 tool: This tool has a variety of uses. Use the blunt edge to open paint
cans or as a flat-head screwdriver. The sharp edge is good for stripping or
scraping paint. The pointed edge gets into grooves so that you can remove
dirt, debris, or excess paint. With the back end, you can drive in nails or
close paint cans. The curved side is handy for scraping off excess paint
when you’re cleaning the roller. And with the bonus “tear drop” in the
center, you can remove nails that have small heads. (See Figure 1-7 if 
you’re wondering what this tool looks like.)

Blue painter’s tape: This tape, available in an assortment of widths, pro-
tects edges from unwanted spatters and splotches. The tape has a waxy
coating that doesn’t allow paint to penetrate, and paint can’t seep under
tape pressed firmly in place. Best of all, if you remove it at the right time,
this tape won’t damage freshly painted walls. Taping edges takes time, but
the reward is taking the tape off and seeing that you have crisp lines where
ceilings meet walls and between walls and trim. (Check out this item in
Figure 1-8.)

Clean, dry rags: Keep these on hand for cleanup and to spot-clean drips of
paint.

Disposable liners: Use these liners in your paint tray to reduce cleanup
time. (Figure 1-10 shows you the liners and the paint tray.)
Figure 1-7: Wooden stir stick, a 5-in-1 tool, and a paint can opener.
15
Chapter 1: Gathering What You Need

Figure 1-8: Blue painter’s tape and a dropcloth keep your workspace tidy.
Figure 1-9: Roller cages, extension handles, paint trays, and liners come in handy.

Dropcloths: Use these plastic sheets to protect floors and furnishing. (This
item is shown in Figure 1-8.) Newspapers work in a pinch.

Extension handle: These extensions screw into the handle of roller cages
and come in 4- and 8-foot lengths. They let you get into hard-to-reach places
and speed up painting flat surfaces, such as walls, ceilings, and floors. You
get more control with the shorter length, but you’ll have to use a ladder to
reach the ceiling or top of walls. (Figure 1-9 shows you this tool.)

Paint can opener: You want to use a paint can opener because it won’t dent
the paint can and the lid — a screwdriver or another makeshift opener
might. If the can or lid is damaged, the can won’t seal properly and the
product can dry out or form a surface skin. (Figure 1-7 shows this tool.)

Paint tray: Use a paint tray to load paint onto a roller. Paint trays have wells
for holding paint and ribs for distributing and removing excess paint from
the roller. Durable metal trays will last for years if you clean them thor-
oughly. Alternately, you can use inexpensive, disposable plastic liners inside
your tray to lengthen its life and for quick cleanup. (See Figure 1-9.)

Permanent black marker: Keep one handy to write on the lids of the con-
tainers you use for storing paint. Write the date, the name of the paint,
where it was used, and the mixing formula.
16
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 


Plastic spray bottle and water: Use this combo to clean up latex paint
splotches.

Roller cage: You need this tool to support the roller cover. (See Figure 1-9
for an example.)

Supply of old newspapers: This supply comes in handy as dropcloths or
additional protection on furnishings and floors, but note that they don’t pro-
tect as well as plastic dropcloths. You can also “paint” them to get excess
paint off brushes and rollers when you’re cleaning them.

Wood stir sticks: You need them for mixing paint. Paint stores routinely
hand out stir sticks when you buy paint. Even though the paint is well
shaken at the store, stir the paint again each time you open the can. 
(Check out Figure 1-7 to see stir sticks.)
Tools for decorative painting
Faux finishes and other decorative paint applications use special tools and glazes as
well as the more common tools mentioned earlier in this chapter. Often, specialized
tools aren’t used for other faux finishes. Paint stores and home improvement centers
carry most of the specialized tools. For some finishes, you need only tools you
already have — pencils, rulers, yardsticks, and so on. A word of advice: Hang onto
those old plastic and paper grocery bags. You can use them to create some finishes.
Also keep a good supply of torn or stained t-shirts and cut them up for rags to use
while you’re painting or cleaning up.
A lot of the projects in this book ask you to apply paint or glaze with these fairly tra-
ditional brushes, rollers, and other applicators:
17
Chapter 1: Gathering What You Need
Selecting a quality brush
If you’ve ever painted anything with a cheap
brush, you know that the bristles come off.
You find them floating in the paint and stuck
on the walls. The bristles on a cheap brush
are stiff and very likely to leave bristle marks
on wet surfaces. A quality brush has flexible
bristles that don’t fall out. It costs much more
than a cheap brush, but it’s worth every
penny because you don’t get frustrated by
debris left on the wet paint and you don’t
have to waste time picking it out. And the flex-
ible bristles allow you to use the brush at any
angle. A quality brush is easier to clean and
can be used repeatedly if you clean it thor-
oughly and hang it up while the bristles dry.
You can choose from natural and synthetic
bristles. Synthetics — such as nylon or a
nylon/polyester blend — can be used with
latex, oil-based, or alkyd paints, and all
types of varnishes. They’re easy to clean; the
bristles don’t get soft or misshapen while
you’re working. Never use a natural bristle
brush with latex paint; natural fibers soak up
water, and latex has a water-based formula.
Natural bristle brushes, usually hog bristles
or ox hair, are soft and spread oil-based
paint smoothly and evenly.


2-inch angled sash brush: Use this brush for leather, stripes, and clouds.

2-inch flat sash brush: This is the brush you want for glazed finishes.

3-inch flat sash brush (or colorwashing brush): Use this brush for color-
washing and stippling finishes.

3-inch paintbrush: Use this versatile brush for suede finishes.

3-inch wallpaper brush: Use it to drag glaze off your base coat. You can
substitute a dragging brush or wood graining comb if your project has a
dragged finish. (See Figure 1-10 to look at this brush.)

4-inch flat sash brush: Use this brush for a gradient finish.

12-inch wallpaper brush: This brush creates chambray, dragging, and metallic
finishes. (Figure 1-10 shows this brush as well as a smaller version.)
Figure 1-10: Two wallpaper brushes, a colorwashing brush, and a stippling brush.

Artist’s brushes: These brushes come in small, medium, and large sizes.
You can choose narrow and round bristled brushes. Select one of these
brushes for faux finishes such as stenciling.

Mini-roller: Use the 4- or 6-inch size for dragging, stripes, bagging, checker-
board, and harlequin finishes. If a finish calls for one of these mini-rollers,
you need the roller cage and a cover. Don’t try to make do with a 9-inch
roller because it can’t reach into small, tight areas. Bonus: After you use this
roller for a specialty project, you have just the right tool for getting into cor-
ners on routine paint projects. (Figure 1-11 shows a mini-roller on a cage.)

Sea sponges: Use these sponges for the sponging off and sponging on proj-
ects. Sponging with a sea sponge creates a much more realistic look than any
synthetic sponge can provide. (See Figure 1-12 for a glimpse of a sea sponge.)


Sheepskin pad: This tool is your best bet for creating a cloud finish. Don’t
improvise — you can’t create the same look with other tools. (Figure 1-12
shows this natural tool.)

Shower squeegee: Notch the squeegee and use it as a guideline in marking
the wall for a wavy stripe finish. (Check out Figure 1-12 for details.)

Small artist’s liner brush: Use this brush for fine detailing in stencil fin-
ishes. (See Figure 1-13 for one of these brushes.)
Figure 1-12: A sheepskin pad, a sea sponge, a shower squeegee, and a large steel trowel.

Chapter 1: Gathering What You Need
Selecting a quality roller cover
Along with selecting the right depth of the
nap for the project, choose a quality roller
cover to get a satisfying finish. A lambskin
cover works best if the surface is smooth
and when you’re using an alkyd or oil-based
paint. If you’re applying primer, glossy
paint, or enamel, look for a mohair cover.
For gloss and semi-gloss paint and clear
finish coats, a foam rubber cover also does
a good job. Foam rollers are easy to use and
clean, but if you load too much paint on one,
it drips. A roller’s ability to hold paint and
apply it evenly depends on the density of
the nap. Because inexpensive rollers tend to
get matted, paint will look uneven or patchy
if the roller sheds lint that sticks to the paint,
even if you’re using quality paint.

Figure 1-13: Use a small artist’s brush or a stencil brush for detail work.

Small chip brush: Use this brush for stippling, bagging, and colorwashing
finishes. You should also try this brush when you need to get paint into
tight areas or fill voids in the colorwashing and stippling finishes.

Small wiz roller: This roller is best for ragging. It has numerous tiny pieces
of cloth that flap onto the surface you’re finishing. It’s a lot like a mini ver-
sion of what you see in a car wash.

Steel trowel: Use this tool to apply Venetian plaster to your walls. (Figure
1-12 shows you an example of this tool.)

Stencil brush: Naturally, you want to use one of these when you’re stencil-
ing. This brush helps you pounce the stencil pattern onto your wall. (Figure
1-13 shows this brush.)

Stippling brush: Use this brush dry on your finish coat to create a multi-
tude of tiny points of base color. It’s also your best bet for stippling and col-
orwashing finishes. You can use a dry 3-inch flat sash brush as a substitute.
(Flip back to Figure 1-10 for a look at this brush.)

Suede roller: Use this specialized roller only with suede paint to create a
suede finish. (See Figure 1-11.)
Some of the tools you need for decorative painting are everyday items that you
wouldn’t necessarily associate with painting. You probably have lots of the items 
in this list already, and the ones you don’t have are easily obtainable:

Blank newsprint: You can pick up this material at an office supply store; it’s
used in flip charts. Use it when you’re doing a frottage finish.

Brown paper bags or heavy-weight brown mailing paper: Use either of
these for the frottage technique.

Clean rags and terry cloth towels: You use these for almost all paint fin-
ishes. Recycle old t-shirts by turning them into clean rags and keep a good
supply on hand. (They make great dust cloths, too, if you dampen them
slightly with water.) The terry cloth towels are used for colorwashing, rag-
ging off, and glazing techniques.

Disposable plastic plates: These everyday items are perfect disposable
paint palettes.
20
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 


Heavy-weight plastic bag: This is another tool you can use for the frottage
finish.

Heavy-weight sheet of solid plastic: Use this tool to encourage your inner
artist and create your own stencil design.

Hobby knife: Use this knife to cut out stencils. A utility knife works well too.

Level: Use a level when you’re creating pattern finishes, such as stripes,
stencils, color blocks, checkerboard, harlequin, and for dragging (including
grasscloth, denim, and linen) finishes.

Pencils: Make sure you have both plain and colored pencils for marking pat-
terns and lines before you start painting.

Plain white tissue paper: This is a key tool if you want a crumpled tissue
paper finish on your walls.

Plastic grocery bags: This tool gives the bagging technique its name.

Plastic wrap: Use this as an alternate for grocery bags in the bagging 
technique.

Scissors: For cutting sponges and paper patterns for stencils.

White poster board: Use this for trying out paint and glaze combinations
and practicing finishing techniques before you start any of the projects.

Yardstick, tape measure, and ruler: For measuring patterns and marking
walls so that you know where to apply certain finishes and colors.
If you’re interested in a faux finish or other decorative techniques, you may need
some of the following glazes, varnishes, and adhesives. Water-based latex glazes can
be used only on top of latex paint. However, oil-based glazes can be used on both
latex and alkyd paint. Because oil-based glazes dry slower than latex glazes, you
have more time to work on complex finish designs. Oil-based glazes generally have a
rich, warm hue and therefore aren’t well suited to finish white or pastel colors.

Acrylic glaze: Provides a transparent, slightly tinted finish pattern over
latex base paint. This glaze, like the latex paint, is water-based.

Acrylic gloss varnish: Water-based varnish provides a hard, non-yellowing,
glossy seal coat on latex glazes. Use it to keep finishes from being chipped or
scratched.

Acrylic spray varnish: Spray this water-based sealer on porous or large sur-
faces, such as the top of a table or chest of drawers, to give them a durable
finish. Use with latex glazes to prevent water marks, chips, and scratches.

Crackle glaze: Using a glaze that’s one shade off the base color gives the fin-
ished surface a subtle crackled effect.

Matte acrylic varnish: When you don’t want a shiny surface that reflects
light, using this product gives you a subtle, yet hard, protective coat. It
intensifies dull colors and isn’t removable.

Metallic glaze: Metallic finishes give base coats a soft, radiant glow. You can
get an elegant patina, a brushed metal finish, or a naturally weathered look
that you’d find on cast iron furnishings and accessories.
21
Chapter 1: Gathering What You Need


Ready-to-use wallpaper adhesive: Use this roll-on adhesive to seal tissue
paper finishes to the wall.

Spray adhesive: This adhesive holds the stencil pattern in place while you
paint the designs on the wall, and then releases the pattern easily. You may
see it labeled as stencil spray adhesive.
Tools for cleanup
No one enjoys cleaning up after a paint project, but manufacturers have designed
products to take some of the burden off cleaning up brushes, rollers, and paint trays.
Supplies that will help you with the cleanup chore include

Krud Kutter: This product is a cleanser that works well on latex glaze
cleanup.

Mild liquid soap: Use the same stuff you use in the kitchen to clean up latex
paint.

Mineral spirits or paint thinner: When you’re ready to clean up alkyd or oil-
based paint and varnish finishes, use mineral spirits or paint thinner. You
can also prep your roller cover with thinner when you’re using oil-based
paints. Both mineral spirits and paint thinner do the job well, but a con-
tainer of mineral spirits is kinder to your wallet.

Paint strainer or cheesecloth: Either of these tools helps you strain debris
out of leftover paint. You’ll want to do that before you reuse the paint for
touch ups or other projects.

Rubber mallet: Use this tool to close paint can lids. A regular hammer will
do if you tap gently.

Small empty paint cans: Recycle your empty paint cans by using them to
store excess paint in an airtight container. Dab a dot of paint on the lid, and
write the color and mixing code on the lid with permanent marker. Then
you know what’s in the paint can without opening it and exposing the paint
to air. A small lidded plastic bucket works as well.

Wire brush or comb: These items remove excess paint from a paintbrush
before you clean it.
Extras worth considering
Some other tools aren’t required but can make paint projects much simpler.
Consider the following tools before you start your next paint job:

Brush and roller spinner: These tools are great for cleaning up latex paint
and then for removing excess water from your brushes and rollers after you
clean them. (See Figure 1-14.) Spin brushes and rollers into a large card-
board box or bucket to contain any spatter.
22
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 

Figure 1-14: A pour spout, squirrel attachment, brush and roller spinner, pad painter, and paint guard.

Electric finishing sander: Use this tool to smooth surfaces quicker than you
can with elbow grease.

Foam pad painters in various shapes and sizes: Whether washable or dis-
posable, these foam pad painters come in handy when you need to paint
into tight corners. The smaller pad is best for those corners, while a larger
pad is great for painting paneled doors. Whatever size you choose, the pad
painter looks like a paintbrush whose bristles have been replaced by a foam
sponge.

Liquid chemical deglosser: This product dulls the surface of glossy paint;
use it before applying latex paint over a glossy paint.

Metal paint guard: This tool guarantees that when you’re painting edges on
the wall, the brush won’t smear paint on the ceiling, floor, or trim by acci-
dent. (Check out Figure 1-14.)

Pour spout for paint can: A pour spout makes pouring paint into a roller
tray or bucket less messy and can prevent unwanted spills. (Figure 1-14
shows this handy tool.)

Squirrel paint mixer electric drill attachment: If you have a drill, this
attachment helps mix paint to avoid settlement. If you don’t have one, 
use a stir stick. (See Figure 1-14 for a look at this attachment.)
Narrowing Down Your Paint Options
All paint products have one of two common bases — water or oil. The base gives paint
particular characteristics that come into play when you’re selecting a finish, getting
the right brushes and rollers, and cleaning up afterward. The following sections give
you the pros and cons of latex and alkyd paint, and tell you about all the various
sheens you can choose from when you’re selecting the best paint for your project.
23
Chapter 1: Gathering What You Need

Deciding on latex or alkyd
Latex paints are now formulated to dry within as little as an hour, which homeown-
ers like because they can put the room back together much more quickly. But when
you’re painting, you have a smaller window for taking breaks because of the quick
drying time. And washing latex may cause the finish to look streaky or uneven when
it’s dry. Water-based latex paint is also popular with do-it-yourselfers because you
can clean brushes, rollers, and paint trays quickly with common household prod-
ucts; all you need is a mild dishwashing detergent and water. You can remove unin-
tended splotches of paint as you work by wiping them off with a damp cloth. Latex
provides a flat, dull surface that can look sophisticated and elegant, unlike the shine
of glossy oil-based paint. But dry latex finishes aren’t as easily cleaned or scrubbed
as oil-based paint.
Oil-based and alkyd paints dry slowly — in 12 or more hours — and have much
more sheen or gloss than water-based paint gives you. They’re durable, sanitary,
and have a hard finish that can be scrubbed and cleaned without worrying about
leaving streaks. You need paint thinner or mineral spirits to clean up mistakes, and
to clean up the brushes and rollers you use to apply alkyd or oil-based paint. That’s
not so bad when you’re dipping a paintbrush into a can filled with paint thinner, but
removing paint from a roller and cover is messy.
Most homeowners, therefore, prefer latex paint for most projects. They can use one
of the finishes that has enough sheen to be cleanable. (See the next section for a dis-
cussion on sheen.)
Selecting a paint sheen
The sheen — how bright or shiny the paint looks when it dries — varies according
to different paint products. Latex paint looks dull in comparison to shinier oil-based
paints because latex paint tends to absorb light while glossy paint reflects it. Along
with the way the finished project looks, sheen determines how well the finish holds
up to finger marks and crayon, and how easily it shows imperfections. It determines
the ambiance of a room, whether it’s sophisticated and elegant or utilitarian in
appearance. The look, durability, and ambiance you want generally determine which
particular paint is best for you.
Just because oil paints are naturally shinier than latex paints, however, doesn’t 
mean that you can’t get a nice sheen with the more user-friendly latex paint.
Manufacturers give latex paint varying grades or levels of sheen — those levels 
also determine how cleanable the paint is. The following list tells you more about
some of the sheens, and Figure 1-15 shows you some of the different sheens side by
side. Note: Names and choices may vary, depending on the manufacturer.

Flat latex paint has an opaque finish that looks elegant on interior walls and
ceilings. It’s also the most dense, or most light absorbing, of all the paint
choices. It doesn’t clean well and isn’t suited for kitchens, baths, or chil-
dren’s bedrooms. If you have children in the house, just know that the only
way to get rid of finger marks and scribbles on this finish is to paint over
them.


An eggshell finish provides a low luster on interior walls and is used for
many decorative finishes. It cleans up better than matte and flat paint, but
we recommend more sheen in the paint you use in kitchens and bathrooms.

Satin finish, which has more sheen than an eggshell finish, cleans even
better than the finishes that make up the beginning of this list. It’s a good
choice for woodwork, walls, doors, and hallways. You can use it in a bath-
room or kitchen if you prefer not to use a glossy paint — but satin isn’t as
scrubbable as the glossy paints.

Semi-gloss paint gives a shiny look to a room, but it’s not as shiny as a 
high-gloss paint. It’s scrubbable and good for moldings, doors, windows,
kitchens, and baths.

A high-gloss finish reflects the most light and definitely shines. But it’s also
stain resistant and scrubbable, which makes it a good choice for kitchens
and baths — the areas of a home that get the most wear and tear. When you
use this finish, you don’t have to worry about a tomato (whole or in
ketchup form) crashing to the floor and spraying up on the wall, and even a
cola or wine stain will clean up easily.
One caveat: When you’re deciding on which sheen you want to use, remember the
higher the sheen, the darker and more intense the color will be.
Figure 1-15: Compare the various sheens and decide which works best for you.
Determining How Much Paint You Need
Whether you paint an entire room, a single wall, or a section (or all) of your floor,
you want to make sure that you have enough paint to finish the project you start.
Figure out how much paint you need by using the formulas in this section.
Determining the amount of paint you need before you start is especially important
for larger rooms. You want each gallon you purchase to be consistent in color; this
consistency is easier to achieve if you purchase all your paint at the same time. Use
the handy table on the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book to keep track of how
much paint you need.

Chapter 1: Gathering What You Need

You get what you pay for. If you want to cover your walls with just one coat, pur-
chase quality paint even though it costs more than some brands on the market. If
you choose a cheaper option, you may find that, ultimately, you have to purchase
several gallons of paint and go over the walls several times to get good coverage.
For walls
You usually can’t return unused cans of custom mixed paint, so if you buy too many,
you have to store the excess, paint another room the same color, give away what
you don’t use, or hope your local store will let you exchange the unopened paint
cans for another color. At the same time, having a partial gallon sitting around is
nice — you can later use the paint to touch up marred walls. Just make sure you
accurately estimate how much you need so you aren’t surprised when you have too
much, or too little, paint.
To determine what it will take to coat the walls once, use the following formula:
1. Add together the length of each wall.
For example, 16 + 16 + 20 + 20 = 72 feet
2. Multiply the total length of walls by the total height.
72 feet × 9 feet = 648 square feet
3. Subtract 20 square feet per door and 15 square feet per window.
648 – 20 – 20 – 20 – 15 – 15 – 15 – 15 = 528 square feet
4. Divide the answer by 350 (the estimated coverage/gallon) for smooth walls;
divide by 300 for rough or textured walls, which soak up more paint.
528  350 = 1.5 gallons for smooth walls
528  300 = 1.76 gallons for rough/textured walls
For floors and ceilings
If you’re painting a smooth ceiling or floor, all you have to do is calculate the square
footage of the surface. Note that rough surfaces, however, reduce the square footage
covered by a gallon of paint. Read the information provided by the manufacturer to
determine how much paint you’ll need for a rough surface. Just follow these steps to
determine how much paint you need for smooth floors and ceilings:
1. Multiply the length of the floor or ceiling by the width of the floor or ceiling.
For example, 16 × 20 = 320 square feet
2. Divide your answer by 350 (estimated coverage per gallon).
320  350 = 0.914 gallons

P
reparing a room or surface for painting isn’t brain surgery
— it’s just good common sense. Preparation can involve a
number of tasks from patching peeling paint to sealing and prim-
ing the surface. Approaching these tasks fully prepared to do
them well ensures that the painting job will go smoothly and that
the results will be rewarding. 
Other than the essential tools (which we list for you in a quick and
easy checklist at the start of each project), the only key compo-
nent you need is patience. Even though you may be chomping at
the bit to pull out your paintbrushes, remember: Failing to prop-
erly prepare is not a shortcut, but an invitation to disaster.

Painting over wallpaper
Sometimes painting over a wallcovering is
the right — and only — thing to do, and
you’ve probably seen plenty of decorating
shows on television do it. So when is 
it okay to paint over wallpaper? In these 
circumstances:
 When the paper was hung ages ago
 When the paper was installed over
unprimed drywall
 When the paper hides holes
 When you don’t have the time or energy
needed to do the massive fixes
If you decide to paint over paper, you need
to prepare before you roll on your finish
coat. Follow these steps:
1. Make sure seams are snug.
2.Smooth out the surface and give it 
some tooth by sanding it with 150-grit
sandpaper.
3.Dust (or vacuum) the surface.
4.Brush on two thin coats of oil-based
sealer.
After you follow these steps, you’re ready to
roll on your finish coat.

Safeguarding the Area
An ounce of prevention truly is worth a pound of cure! For example, it’s
far easier to throw a protective dropcloth over a velvet sofa and floors
than to try to remove a paint spatter from the upholstery and carpet.
Similarly, taping is the easy way to mask off any surface that needs to
be protected from paint from a wayward brush or roller or spillover of a
cleaning liquid. Areas generally taped off are baseboards, ceiling mold-
ings, window and door frames, and electrical switches and outlets. If
you’re painting trim, tape off edges of surrounding walls to avoid having
to touch up the wall or repaint the entire room.
Here’s a cool tip: Mover’s coasters are handy tools; place them under
the feet of a piece of furniture in order to make it slide easily.

1.
Remove furniture from the room. If you can’t
remove some heavy or bulky pieces, cluster
them in the center of the room, leaving space to
walk around (and through the furniture cluster
if you plan to paint the ceiling).
2.
Cover the furniture with one or more plastic
dropcloths (plastic because it’s paint-resistant).
Using painter’s tape, tape the dropcloths in
place, either to the back of furniture or to the
floor.
3.
Cover the floor with one or more plastic
dropcloths. Tape it down with blue painter’s
tape to avoid slippage.

4.
Use a screwdriver to remove all window treat-
ments, including draperies, rods, shutters,
blinds, shades, and all hardware. Place the hard-
ware in a zip-top bag for safekeeping.
5.
Starting at one corner of the top of a window or
door frame, align a piece of blue painter’s tape
with the edge or strip of the molding that meets
the wall.
6.
Bring the tape across the window or door
frame, pressing it into place as you go. Tape
all around the frame.
7.
Repeat Steps 5 and 6 around all window and
door frames in the room as well as along any
trim and baseboards.

Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
8.
Switch off lights in the room and then
unscrew and remove all electrical face-
plates — switches and outlets. Place the
screws and coordinating faceplates in a 
zip-top bag.
10. If you’re painting a ceiling, make sure ceiling-
hung light fixtures and overhead fan
switches are in a closed position, and then
cover the fixture with a piece of plastic 
dropcloth that you’ve cut to fit and taped in
place.
11. Depending on the time of year, turn down the thermostat
for heat or raise the setting for air conditioning to kick on
in order to reduce the amount of air and dust circulating
through ducts. The dust can cling to wet paint.
12. Cover the thermostat with blue painter’s tape to keep it
paint-free.
If it’s necessary to protect the face (front) of a window frame (or perhaps a mirror in a bathroom), tape newspa-
pers or a sheet of plastic over it.
Don’t be tempted to use masking tape instead of blue painter’s tape. Paint can bleed under masking tape
because it doesn’t stick to the taped surface as well as painter’s tape.And you may not realize it until after you
pull the masking tape off.
9.
Cover exposed outlets and switches
with blue painter’s tape. Tape wall
switches in a closed position so that
no one inadvertently turns on the
overhead fan or light.

Chapter 2: Readying Your Room and Surface
Removing Scrubbable Wallpaper
Wallpaper that’s hung well is hung to stay, or so it seems when you try
to take it down! Ease of removal depends on the type of wallpaper
you’re dealing with. For example, some types of wallpaper, such as
vinyl, are easy to pull off walls but that’s only the top layer. They leave
behind a paper lining and glue residue that you have to spend some
time scrubbing off. Scrubbable wallpaper, which is covered in this proj-
ect, is a common wallcovering with a coating that requires the addi-
tional step of scoring for removal.
If you have vinyl wallpaper, skip Steps 3 through 7. Instead, look for a
loose corner seam or gently insert the edge of a putty knife under a lower
corner at the seam to lift the edge of the vinyl paper. Be careful that you
grab the finish layer, leaving the paper backing on the wall. Gently lift the
wallpaper strip up and out. Don’t yank the paper off; if you do, you may
tear off the paper backing and parts of the wall. Use the putty knife, if
needed, to separate the finish layer from the backing. Continue these
steps until you remove all the strips, and then head to Step 8.
The time needed to complete this project depends on several factors,
including the size of the room, the number of wallpaper strips you need
to remove, and the stubbornness of the wallpaper glue. Remove the
first strip of wallpaper and then estimate the total time needed for the
rest of the project.

2.
Cover the floor with plastic dropcloths, and use a screw-
driver to remove faceplates and outlet covers (turn the
power off first to be safe).
If the faceplates are covered with wallpaper, drop them
into a bucket of water to soak while you remove paper
from the wall.
1.
Test whether the wallpaper is scrubbable by spraying an
area with water. If the water beads up and runs down the
wall, your paper is scrubbable and you need to use the
scoring or perforating tool.

32
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
3.
Score the wallpaper with the scoring or perforating tool,
using a circular or twisting motion of your hand so that
the cutting edge penetrates the paper. Take care not to
press down too hard, especially if the scoring tool has
spikes; you may puncture the wall and have to repair it.
Work up and down or across the paper, getting in close 
at corners.
4.
Prepare the wallpaper remover solu-
tion according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions, and then spray
on the remover solution or use a
sponge and bucket to wet the sur-
face of the wallpaper. The scoring
from Step 3 allows the solution to
penetrate the paper and soften the
glue.

33
Chapter 2: Readying Your Room and Surface
7.
When all the strips are down, go over the
wall again with the wallboard knife to
remove any torn fragments of paper.
Some wallpaper glue can be especially stubborn. If you can’t dissolve yours, sand the walls with 220-grit sand-
paper to remove the glue, and then wash the walls down with a TSP solution (see Chapter 1).
If the manufacturer’s instructions on the wallpaper removal solution say to wipe off the product and paste with
a damp sponge, be careful not to get the wall too wet.The wall must be completely dry before you paint it.
5.
When the adhesive has softened, which should
take 15 to 30 minutes, start at a seam, with a
wallboard knife in one hand, and pry the paper
loose from the wall. Pull the paper up gently
with the other hand as you go. You may have to
work the knife under the edges to loosen them.
8.
Remove all traces of paste using a damp sponge and either a TSP or TSP-PF solu-
tion or wallpaper removal product (most types dissolve the paste, but you should
check the manufacturer’s instructions to be sure).
6.
Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you remove all strips of wallpaper.

Repairing Peeling Paint on Woodwork and Trim
Stuff You 
Need to Know
You can find peeling paint on woodwork throughout the house, and
baseboards are no exception. Children and pets can damage the paint
on your baseboards without much effort; they don’t mean any harm,
but you’re left with flaking paint that needs to be fixed. 
Another common cause of peeling paint on your woodwork — particu-
larly windowsills — is moisture. If your woodwork has water damage,
make sure you find the source of the problem first. Tackle that prob-
lem, and then sand or strip the trim down to the bare wood. Prime and
paint the wood following the directions in the projects on priming and
painting baseboards, molding, and trim (see Chapter 9).
2.
Use a hook-type paint scraper or 5-in-1 tool
to gently scrape away loose, chipping paint.
Use very light pressure, taking care not to
gouge the wood surface, and scrape down to
the bare wood if necessary.
3.
If water has raised the grain of the wood
underneath (you can tell because the wood
will be bumpy), take off enough paint to
expose adjacent undamaged wood. Use 
180-grit sandpaper to sand the damaged
spot until the wood itself is smooth.
1.
To avoid getting paint chips and dust on your floor, tape a
dropcloth below the baseboard. Or you can vacuum up any
debris after Step 5 and Step 8.

35
Chapter 2: Readying Your Room and Surface
4.
Feather the edges of adjoining paint 
with sandpaper so that the painted and
unpainted areas feel even and smooth.
5.
Wipe off dust with a tack cloth or damp rag,
and vacuum any paint chips that are on the
floor.
6.
If the wood has any gouges or dented areas,
fill them with wood filler and let it dry.
7.
Sand dry wood filler with sandpaper until
the surface is smooth.
8.
Wipe off dust with a tack cloth or damp rag.
9.
Seal, prime, and paint the wood, following the directions in the projects on
priming and painting baseboards, molding, and trim in Chapter 9.

Stripping Paint from Wood Trim
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Stripping paint can be a very satisfying project because you see almost
instantaneous results. But it’s important to take precautions when
working with strong chemicals such as strippers. Always work in a well-
ventilated room, keep doors open, and even on a cold day, crack open a
nearby window for a source of fresh air. A breathing mask cuts down on
the fumes you’re exposed to, but you should also ventilate the space.
Before you begin, open the windows and doors of the room you’re
working in. Don goggles, a breathing mask, and protective gloves so
that you can safely handle chemicals.
1.
Tape the walls above and around the trim. You
may also want to protect your floor with a thick
layer of newspapers.
2.
Read the directions on the container of chemical
stripper that you’ve selected to use. Following
the product directions, use an old paintbrush to
apply the stripper to the surface of painted trim.
Work in a small section of trim to get a feel for
the amount of time it takes for the paint to lift
and peel off easily; you can increase the size of
the section as you proceed around the room. 

37
Chapter 2: Readying Your Room and Surface
3.
Let the stripper set according to the package instruc-
tions or until you see the paint beginning to bubble up.
(If you let the stripper set too long, it will dry on the
trim and be unworkable.) After the paint has bubbled up
and while the stripper is still wet, use a putty knife or a
plastic scraper to scrape the paint off the surface. Take
care not to gouge the scraper into the softened wood.
5.
Clean up paint that didn’t come off by wiping
the stripped area with steel wool and/or a
stiff toothbrush.
6.
Dip a fresh, paint-free piece of steel wool into
denatured alcohol and rub the area again to
remove all traces of paint.
7.
Wipe down the paint-free wood trim with a
damp sponge.
8.
Repeat Steps 2 through 7 on all trim in the room.
4.
If the trim has layers of paint on it, repeat Steps 2 and 3 as
many times as necessary in order to get down to the wood.
Make sure that the trim is completely dry before painting or staining it.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Regardless of whether your ultimate goal is to paint it, stain it, or leave
it au naturel, old, scarred wood shouldn’t pose a problem. Cleaning and
repairing dinged or otherwise damaged woodwork — whether it’s
stained or painted — is an easy project for which you need only some
basic skill, tools, and materials. This project focuses on eliminating
scratches and dings.
1.
Rub steel wool gently over superficial
scratches, following the grain of the wood as
shown here. For deeper scratches and dings,
sand the area with 220-grit sandpaper, fol-
lowing the grain of the wood.
2.
Use a rag to rub the area with mineral 
spirits.

39
Chapter 2: Readying Your Room and Surface
3.
Use your fingertip to fill a scratch or ding
with premixed wood filler that matches the
stain on the rest of the wood.
4.
Allow the filler to dry, and then use 220-grit
sandpaper to sand the filled area.
5.
Wipe down the area with a damp rag or tack
cloth to remove dust.
When it dries, wood putty doesn’t absorb stain evenly, which means that tinted, premixed wood filler is the best
choice for spot repairs on woodwork.
6.
Refinish the wood as described in the projects on priming and
painting baseboards, molding, and trim.

It always seems as if the smallest nails leave big holes in drywall. The
good news is that getting rid of them is simple. Follow these easy steps
and you’ll be ready to paint the room and rehang the pictures for a com-
pletely fresh look in your home.
1.
Use your fingertip to dab a bit of patching
compound into the nail hole.
2.
Use a putty knife to scrape the patching
compound smooth and flat with the sur-
rounding wall. Let it dry.

41
Chapter 2: Readying Your Room and Surface
3.
Sand the compound area lightly using fine-
grit sandpaper and a circular motion until
the patch blends in smoothly with the wall.
You can test whether it’s smooth and even
with your fingers.
4.
Vacuum the sanded area to remove dust.
5.
Wipe the area lightly with a damp sponge,
and let the patch dry completely before
brushing on primer.
Removing mildew
Mildew stains are caused by airborne mold
spores that flourish wherever there’s mois-
ture, darkness, and little air movement. In
order to get rid of the stain, you have to kill
the spores. You can use any of a number of
commercial mildewcides available from
home improvement or hardware stores, or
you can opt for a common home remedy
that involves washing the stain with
common household laundry bleach.
If you want to try the home remedy, don
your rubber gloves and mix a solution of
equal parts water and laundry bleach. Wash
the stained area with the solution. Wait 30
minutes, and wash it again. If that doesn’t
do the trick, try a solution of TSP or TSP-PF.
Wear protective clothing and goggles, and
read the manufacturer’s instructions. Make
sure you thoroughly sponge your walls
with clean water after using the TSP or TSP-
PF. Any residue will prevent paint from
bonding to the surface.
Finally, when the area is completely dry and
stain-free, apply a sealer or primer that con-
tains mildewcide, and then paint it.

Cleaning Surfaces
Stuff You 
Need to Know
The only grease that a surface needs before you paint it is elbow grease!
Well-washed walls that are free of grease and grime and smooth as silk
are an absolute must for ensuring that your paint project proceeds as it
should and you get the results you want and expect. Trisodium phos-
phate (TSP) — or TSP-PF in communities where phosphates are prohib-
ited — is a favorite chemical for washing walls because it gets the job
done without creating suds.
1.
While wearing protective clothing, gloves,
and goggles, dilute the TSP or TSP-PF in
water according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2.
Dip a sponge into the bucket of TSP solution, squeeze
out excess water, and start washing the walls from the
bottom up to avoid streaking.
If you have allergies or are sensitive to strong chemicals, ask your paint dealer to recommend a TSP substitute.
TSP contains sodium meta-silicate, which may cause burns or irritation and is harmful if swallowed. It’s not rec-
ommended for use on glossy paint or enamel, and it can darken oak, mahogany, and other woods. If you decide
to use it, follow the manufacturer’s directions carefully and keep powder and solution out of reach of children.
3.
Thoroughly rinse the TSP from the bucket and sponge, and then fill the
bucket with clear, warm water.
4.
Sponge the walls thoroughly with clear water. You want to remove all
traces of TSP because any residue will prevent paint from bonding to the
surface.

Priming Baseboards, Molding, and Trim
Stuff You 
Need to Know
3.
In addition to using a paint guard (see Step
5), you can tape the walls adjacent to trim
with blue painter’s tape (refer to taping
instructions earlier in the chapter) to pro-
tect them from unintended spatters and
brush strokes. If you’re painting a base-
board, you can also tape a dropcloth below
the board to help keep paint off your floor.
Before painting, you need to prime all trim; a coat of regular wood
primer helps paint adhere whereas a combination sealer-primer keeps
stains from showing through and provides an undercoat for the paint.
The priming step is especially necessary for trim that has been stained
previously or has problems such as knots or discoloration. For new,
unfinished wood, you can prime and paint the trim on sawhorses before
installing it.
1.
Lightly sand the entire surface using
220-grit sandpaper and long, even
strokes. Use smaller pieces of sand-
paper to get into more ornate or
carved surfaces.
2.
Wipe off any residue with a clean, damp rag
or tack cloth and follow up with a dry rag.
Vacuum any dust or debris.

44
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
4.
Dip one-third of the sash brush’s bristles
into primer. Tap the brush handle on the
side of the can or container to cast off 
extra primer.
5.
Hold a paint guard in one hand, and cover
the wall or floor adjacent to the trim you’re
working on. Brush primer on the woodwork
using long strokes.
6.
Repeat Step 4, and start the next stroke by
overlapping the edge of the one you just 
finished. Blending the edges of wet primer
gives you a smoother, more even result.
7.
Check periodically for drips. Gently “tap” up
any drips by holding the bristle end of a dry
brush on the drip, just lightly touching the
drip. (The drip will flow — or tap — back into
the bottom of the brush.) Don’t push the bris-
tles any lower than the surface of the drip.
8.
Allow the primer to dry for 24 hours or according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Remove any tape from the walls.

Applying Sealer and Primer
To enhance the beauty and durability of freshly painted walls, prep
work is necessary. After you clean the walls, as we explain in the
“Cleaning Surfaces” project, your next step is to apply a sealer and/or
primer. This project tells you how to apply sealer to a water-stained
area of a wall or wood trim and how to prime the walls. If you’re using a
sealer to cover a water stain on a wall or ceiling, make sure that the
source of the water (like condensation from an air conditioner, leaking
pipe, or hole in the roof) has been repaired and that the stained surface
is dry and firm. If you don’t need to seal anything, follow Step 1 and
then skip to Step 6.

4.
Sand sealed surface with 180-grit sandpaper
until smooth, feathering out edges. This is
especially important with water stains
because as water soaks in, it expands dry-
wall, and on wood, moisture leaves a rough
surface after drying. You also want the sur-
face smooth before applying finish paint.
5.
Use the brush attachment on your vacuum
cleaner to vacuum away any dust and
residue from the stained area.
6.
Start applying primer in a 3 to 4 foot section
of the wall by cutting in the corners with a
21⁄2-inch brush.

8.
Wipe up any drips as you go along by 
wicking up excess primer with a clean, dry
brush — just lightly touch the end of the
brush to the drip. You can also use a clean
dry rag to wick it up; just twist a small area
of the rag and lightly touch it to the drip.
9.
Continue painting around the
room, section by section, work-
ing primer from dry areas into
wet ones.
7.
Roll on primer. Start in the corner and roll an
“M” (this roller technique is described in
Chapter 4).

48
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
10. Wait for the primer to dry (it can take any-
where from one to several hours; read the
manufacturer’s instructions), and then sand
any imperfections, such as dust or a drip
that has dried, off the wall. Sand lightly with
180-grit sandpaper. If you don’t remove
imperfections before adding the finish paint,
they will be visible until you redo the room
again.
If you want to spot prime a surface, don’t create a square or circular patch because it will be noticeable after you
paint the wall. Feather out the primer and the paint. Likewise, if you have to prime multiple spots, prime those
spots, and then paint the whole wall.
11. Use the brush attachment on your vacuum cleaner to vacuum the wall to clean
up any sanding dust. If you leave dust on the surface, it will show through the
finish coat.

Y
our paint job is only as good as your prep work. And when
you’re painting walls, the most important prep work you
can do is to fix the dings, dents, and other flaws that can’t be cam-
ouflaged with paint; these flaws can include anything from a small
nail hole to a fist-sized hole.
Even though fixing these things may actually take more time than
painting does, a few hours spent righting the wrongs will pay off in
a perfect paint job. Fortunately, you don’t have to be a craftsman 
to tackle minor repairs to either of the two most common wall 
surfaces:

Drywall (sometimes referred to as Sheetrock): The most common wall type
in housing today, drywall consists of gypsum, a chalky rock, sandwiched
between paper. Drywall is sturdy when nailed into place, but it’s vulnerable
to nicks and knocks. Repairing, happily, requires only basic skills.

Plaster walls: Typically found in pre-WWII homes, plaster walls consist of
three layers of plaster applied over lath (strips of wood). Although repairing
major cracks and large holes in plaster walls requires a professional plas-
terer, patching small cracks and holes calls only for basic skills, the proper
materials and tools, and a fair bit of patience.
With a little know-how and easy-to-follow instructions, you can get your walls in
prime shape for painting. The projects in this chapter tell you how.

Repairing Holes in Drywall
Fixing holes and shallow dents or scratches in drywall with drywall
mud creates an even, like-new surface for painting. The tricks are to
apply several thin layers of drywall mud into the hole or scratch and 
to sand them lightly to blend out the edges of the patch and ensure a
smooth, even surface. This project addresses both small holes about 
1 inch or less in diameter and medium holes about the size of a fist.
Anything larger than a fist-sized hole needs to be patched with a new
piece of drywall cut to fit the void. But the job isn’t necessarily one that
should send you to the phone book to find a handyman or contractor.
See Home Improvement for Dummies by Gene Hamilton and Katie
Hamilton (Wiley) for more info on fixing large holes.

2.
If the hole is deep or goes all the way
through the drywall, stuff a piece of fiber-
glass mesh tape into the hole to provide a
base for the drywall mud. Place the mesh
over the hole with edges slightly overlapping
undamaged drywall.

53
Chapter 3: Making Necessary Wall Repairs
3.
Using a broad knife or your finger (depend-
ing on the size of the hole), smooth on about
1⁄4 inch of drywall mud with a downward
stroke. Use the broad knife to swipe off any
excess mud. (A thin layer of drywall mud
dries faster, gives you better control over
the repair, and reduces the amount of sand-
ing needed.) Let the patch dry completely.
4.
Repeat Step 3 two more times or until the
patch is level with the wall, taking care to
keep each layer thin.
5.
Using a 120-grit sanding block, smooth the
patch with downward strokes. When the
patch is smooth, sand it again using a gentle,
circular motion to blend the patch into the
rest of the wall.
The process of fixing a dent or nail hole in drywall is essentially the same except that you don’t need to use
mesh tape because even though it’s dented, the drywall backing is still there (and nail holes are usually pretty
small).
6.
Vacuum the patch to remove dust, and prime the patch before painting.

Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
Repairing Cracks and Small Holes in Plaster
Few new homes have plaster walls anymore because installation
requires skilled labor and because the settling and drying out that
occur as a home ages cause plaster to crack. If you live in an older
home that has plaster walls, the good news is that you can easily repair
small holes and cracks yourself. The bad news is that you have two
choices when it comes to large cracks and holes: Call a specialist to do
the difficult repairs, or replace the plaster with drywall.
You can buy plaster patching compound in 3- to 5-pound boxes, which
is likely to be enough for your project, but don’t worry if you have to
buy more than that. The powder will keep for years if it’s not exposed
to moisture; store it in a tightly covered container or zip-top plastic bag.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Use a masonry chisel and hammer
to pick at the hole and make it
larger. A larger hole takes more
patching plaster, which helps it
adhere better.
2.
Scrape damaged and loose plaster away
from the hole with the tip of a screwdriver.

55
Chapter 3: Making Necessary Wall Repairs
3.
In a bucket or small tub, mix powdered plas-
ter patch with water according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Use either an electric
hand mixer and one beater or a power drill
with a mixer attachment, depending on 
what you have. Don’t worry — the plaster
patch is water-soluble and washes off easily.
Remember: When it’s exposed to moisture,
the patching compound hardens within a
couple hours, so mix small quantities sev-
eral times rather than one big batch.
4.
Using a broad knife, fill the crack or hole
with the patching compound, and smooth
the compound with the flat edge of your
knife. (A broad knife works better than a
wide-blade putty knife because its sharp
edge removes excess plaster and smoothes
the patch better.)
5.
After the patch is dry, sand it with 180-grit
sandpaper, using a circular motion, until it
feels smooth and totally flush with the wall.

56
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
Spot priming and painting works well on ceilings, but not as well on walls because the repaired patches stand
out. Plan to repair plaster cracks when you intend to repaint the entire wall.
If you have more than a couple cracks or small holes to repair, mix a small batch of patching compound and
repair only two or three of the bad spots.That will give you an idea of how long it takes to do the repair and
how long it takes for the compound to harden.And if you find that you work slowly, you won’t waste as much
compound as you would if you mixed a large batch.
6.
Wipe the patch with a damp rag to remove
dust, and let it dry completely before apply-
ing primer and paint.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Everyone living with drywall knows about popped nails. Those pesky
fasteners make their presence known because the compound covering
the nail fails or the head of the nail pokes out above or through the dry-
wall. These faults can occur when a building settles, when nails don’t
attach to studs, and sometimes just when people walk through a room
with bouncy floors. Don’t despair if you have popped nails; the repair is
fairly simple and makes it easy to give your home a new look without
the apparent flaws.
1.
Use an electronic stud finder to locate the
stud placement around a popped nail. Mark
the wall with a pencil when you find a stud.
Or you can find the stud by inserting a screw
into the wall; if it doesn’t hit a stud, move the
screw 1⁄4 inch at a time until you do. (Don’t
worry about multiple holes; you’ll patch
them later.)
2.
Use a screwdriver to fasten drywall screws
through the drywall and into the stud
slightly above and below the popped nail.
Insert the screw far enough that the head 
is below the wall’s surface. Take care not 
to break through the paper covering the
wallboard.

8.
Apply primer and paint to the patches.
58
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
3.
Place the pointed tip of a screw on the head of
the popped nail and gently tap the head of the
screw with a hammer. The tapping should
dimple the popped nail, sending the head below
the surface of the wall. (If you accidentally mar
the wall with the hammer, you’ll fix it later.)
4.
Use a putty knife to spread patching com-
pound over the dimpled nails and screws
and unwanted screw holes or marred walls,
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Let the patches dry completely.
5.
Repeat Step 4 if needed, and let the patches
dry thoroughly.
6.
Use 220-grit sandpaper to sand the patches
with a circular motion until they feel smooth
and level with the wall.
7.
Vacuum the patches to remove dust.

T
ime-honored, good old-fashioned painting basics still apply
today. The choices, quality, and results you can expect from
a can of paint have improved tremendously over the years. But
prepping the surfaces to be painted hasn’t changed. If you want
the finished product to look good, the paint still has to be applied
to clean, smooth surfaces. So take the time to repaint and wash
them well.
“Don’t cut corners” is good advice for prepping, but don’t mix it up
with “cutting in corners,” the most difficult, frustrating task
painters face. In this chapter, you discover ways and products to
make these chores easier. The old standards — water and water-
based products to clean up latex paint, and paint thinner or min-
eral spirits to remove alkyd paint — still hold true. But this chapter
also has a few new timesaving ideas that reduce your cleanup time.
Lots of people store half-empty paint cans because they know
they’ll use them for touch ups later. But when they open the can,
they see rust on the lid and around the rim. Find out how to elimi-
nate rust and store paint for years — or until you change your
color scheme.
In this chapter, you get how-to info for creating flawless finishes, as
well as practical techniques for prepping, cleaning, and storing paint.

Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
Prepping Multiple Cans of the 
Same Color Paint
You’ve donned your paint duds, done your prep work — repairing,
cleaning, sanding, taping, and draping — and now you’re ready to 
paint. Get your paint project off to a good start by prepping your 
paint properly.
Paint can vary slightly from can to can, so if you plan to paint a large
surface that requires more than one can of paint, ensure color unifor-
mity by boxing your paint, the fancy way of saying mixing all the paint
together.
Toolbox:
 Dropcloth
 5-in-1 tool or paint can
opener
 Paint (more than one can
in the same color)
 5-gallon bucket
 Stir sticks designed for
5-gallon buckets
Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Cover your work area with a drop-
cloth, open all your paint cans
using a paint can opener or 5-in-1
tool, and then pour the paint into
a 5-gallon bucket.

61
Chapter 4: Brushing Up on Painting Basics
2.
Use a large stir stick to stir the paint
clockwise for 15 to 30 seconds and then
counterclockwise for 15 to 30 seconds.
If paint still isn’t mixed well enough, stir
the paint from front to back for 15 to 
30 seconds.
3.
To make it more manageable to
pour into containers or roller trays,
pour the boxed paint from the
bucket back into the individual
paint cans. Seal all but one can by
covering the lids with a rag and
tapping around the rim of the lid
with a rubber mallet.
4.
Pour about 1 inch of paint from the open can
into your portable paint container if you’re
cutting in with a brush or 2 inches of paint in
the well of a roller tray if you’re ready to roll
on paint.
Paint settles rapidly, so whether you box your paint or not, or whether you just had it stirred at the store, you still
need to stir it well before you use it every time.
5.
Put the lid back on the remaining open can
to avoid any accidental spills.

Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
Making old paint useable again
If your paint has been in storage for a year
or more, it may have separated, and lumps
may have formed. Even so, you can 
still save the paint. To do so, you need to
remove the lumps and condition the paint.
Conditioners (sold at paint stores) slow
down drying and improve the paint’s flow,
adhesion, and coverage.
Follow these steps to make your old paint
useable again:
1. Skim off any thickened skin on top with
an old knife and discard the skin by
wrapping it up in newspaper.
2. Stir the paint well or use a paint mixer to
break down lumps and mix pigments
and other ingredients.
3. Pour paint through a paint strainer or
cheesecloth and into a bucket to remove
any remaining lumps or debris.
4. Add conditioner to thin the paint and
make it spread better and more evenly;
conditioner also slows down the quick-
ness with which paint dries. Follow the
manufacturer’s directions on the condi-
tioner packaging.
5. Stir the paint thoroughly before and
while you’re using it to keep pigments
and other ingredients from separating. If
you don’t stir, you risk ending up with an
uneven appearance on the finish coat.
Voilà! Old paint with new life.
Keeping your can clean
Paint keeps well when it isn’t exposed to air.
You can keep air exposure to a minimum
while you’re working. Just pour the approx-
imate amount of paint you need for an hour
or so into a smaller container or your roller
tray, and put the lid back on the paint can.
Some do-it-yourselfers like to get a number
of smaller plastic containers; they can be
used for mixing paint and as the bucket you
dip your brush into.
Air also causes metal paint cans to deterio-
rate, and that oxidation eventually causes
the can to rust. But you can keep the can
handy while you’re working without buying
a gallon’s worth of plastic containers. Here
are some ways to make paint can prep
easier:
 To ease opening: Use either a 5-in-1 tool
or a paint can opener to gently pry up
the lid. A paint can opener — a long,
narrow stem with a flat, slightly curved
edge on one end, and an oval or round
head on the other — often is free when
you buy paint. Don’t use a screwdriver
or pointed bottle opener — they could
deform the lid, thus making a tight seal
impossible. Keep your paint can closed
as much as possible while you’re paint-
ing. And make sure it’s tightly sealed
overnight or in storage. These steps will
keep paint from drying out, prevent
lumps, stop a skin from forming on the
surface, and keep air from oxidizing the
paint can.
 To make pouring paint easier and
cleaner: Either hammer small holes
around the metal rim so that paint drips
back into the can, or snap a “duck bill”
shaped paint dispenser onto the rim of
the can. You can purchase these dis-
pensers wherever you buy paint.
 For convenience and to avoid messes
with the lid:When you first open a paint
can, slip the lid into a plastic baggie
(medium-sized, zip-closure baggies tend
to work best), and put the lid — baggie
and all — back onto the paint can until
you need to pour more paint. It keeps
the paint in the can from drying out and
prevents the lid from dripping. When
you need to open the can again, just lift
the lid by the edge of the plastic baggie.

Cutting In Paint with a Brush
Toolbox:
 Paint
 Small paint container
 2-inch angled sash brush
Time Needed:
Less than half a
day
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Use brushes to cut in areas that are too tight for rollers (such as at the
ceiling line, in corners, and along baseboards and trim) and to apply
alkyd paints (brushes tend to leave marks on large surfaces brushed
with fast-drying latex paints). See Chapter 1 for a complete discussion
of brush types, sizes, and uses.
Prevent trouble before it starts by loading your brush and applying
paint the proper way. These simple instructions can help prevent drips
and spatter, save your brush for future paint jobs, and produce great-
looking results.
1.
Pour about 1 inch of paint into
your paint container.
2.
Hold your brush properly to pre-
vent muscle fatigue in your hand,
wrist, and arm. When cutting in,
use the pencil grip, which allows
for a lot of control. Simply cradle
the brush handle between the
thumb and index finger of your
dominant hand. Rest your index
finger on the narrow edge of the
brush, and position your thumb on
one side and your remaining fin-
gers on the other side of the
brush’s metal band.

64
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
3.
Dip your brush bristles straight
down into your paint container. The
paint should cover only the first
third of the bristles. Gently swish
and wiggle the brush back and
forth in the container to load the
brush with paint.
4.
Gently tap each side of the brush
against the paint container to shake
off any excess paint.
5.
Make a downward brushstroke on
the wall about 2 inches away from
the area you want to paint; this
placement deposits the excess paint
in an open area, making it easier for
you to manage, be more precise in
the corners, and create a finer line.

6.
Turn the brush so that the narrow
edge is up, and paint a downward
stroke up to 12 inches long in the
corner. Applying too much pres-
sure will glop on the paint and
make a big drip, so go with a light
touch. For long expanses along the
ceiling or baseboard, use a horizon-
tal stroke up to 12 inches long.
65
Chapter 4: Brushing Up on Painting Basics
7.
Erase brush marks by turning the
brush back so that the wide edge is
up, and gently sweeping the brush
back over the painted area using
light pressure.
8.
Repeat Steps 2 through 6, working from dry areas to wet areas and gently
overlapping the two sections to avoid marks.

66
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
Applying a Base Coat with a Roller
After you cut in your paint (see the previous project), make fast work of
completing your base coat with a roller. Prepping your roller before you
douse it in paint ensures even coverage and faster painting — and it
saves paint. Properly loading and unloading the roller cuts down on
spatter, drips, and spotty coverage. And optimal application tech-
niques, including proper stance, mean fewer touch ups and reduced
muscle fatigue.

1.
Put your roller cover on the cage. Stir your
paint thoroughly with a stir stick, and pour 
it into the paint tray. You should have only
about 1⁄2 inch of paint in the well.
2.
Dampen the roller cover. For latex (water-
based) paint, mist your roller cover with a
spray bottle filled with water, or dampen it
under a faucet of running water. For alkyd
paints, roll the alkyd-appropriate roller
cover in a tray of paint thinner. Scrape off
excess water or thinner with a 5-in-1 tool.

67
Chapter 4: Brushing Up on Painting Basics
3.
Roll the roller down the slope of the paint
tray (called the rake) and into the paint well.
4.
Evenly distribute the paint on the roller by
lifting it up out of well, placing it at the top of
the rake, and rolling it downward toward the
well but not into it.
5.
Repeat Step 4 to evenly load the roller. Take
care not to let the roller spin or you’ll create
spatter. And don’t lift the roller out of the
tray if any paint is dripping from it.

68
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
7.
Keep the roller cover from flying off the
handle by positioning the roller so that the
open end points in the direction you’re
painting. Use a long, slow, upward diagonal
stroke to unload the first part of the “M” dis-
tribution pattern.
8.
In a continuing motion, follow the first
upward stroke with a long, slow stroke
downward at a diagonal.
6.
Hold the roller in your dominant hand. If
you’re using an extension pole, place your
dominant hand toward the bottom for con-
trol and your nondominant hand at the
middle position for leverage and pressure.
Stand in front of the wall with your feet
shoulder-width apart and your roller directly
in front of you for control.

69
Chapter 4: Brushing Up on Painting Basics
9.
In a continuing motion, use another long,
slow, upward diagonal stroke and another
long, slow downward diagonal stroke to
finish the “M” pattern.
10. Distribute paint with a series of horizontal
strokes starting at the bottom of the “M” and
working toward the top.
11. Smooth out the section by rolling vertically
downward from top to bottom. At the bot-
tom of each stroke, lift the roller up and
return it to the top.
12. Repeat the process of loading the roller and painting, working in
sections of three or four roller widths. Move from dry areas to wet
ones, overlapping the wet edge each time you start a new section.
Always use a roller cover with the correct nap length for the job. Luckily, manufacturers put nap length and 
purpose information right on the package. For example, you usually see 3⁄8-inch nap roller covers indicated 
or smooth surfaces and 1⁄2-inch nap roller covers for rough surfaces.

Good brushes can last for years and years. Keep them serviceable by
cleaning them properly. Start this task as soon as you’re finished with a
paintbrush to keep it in the best possible shape.
1.
Hold just the paintbrush, and
drag it across the top of the paint
can, scraping the excess paint
back into the can. Reseal the can
when you’re done.
2.
Put the brush under warm running
water to rinse out the loose paint.
Spread the bristles of the brush to
get down into the heel (near the
metal band) to clean any paint that
may be down there.

71
Chapter 4: Brushing Up on Painting Basics
3.
If any paint remains in or on the brush, use 
a paintbrush comb or soft scrub brush to
remove it. Continue holding the brush under
the warm running water while you use this
tool.
4.
Continue to milk the brush from the heel to
the end of the bristles. Spread the bristles
occasionally until all the paint is gone from
the brush and the water coming out of the
brush is clear.
5.
When the brush is paint-free, take it in one
hand and tap the heel of the brush against
your other hand repeatedly. This step
knocks the water from the brush.
6.
Hang the clean, damp paintbrush on a peg-
board or place it on a flat surface to dry.
When it’s dry, place the brush back into its
case and store.
If you’ve waited several days to clean a brush, try soaking it in warm, soapy water for about 30 minutes before
beginning the cleaning process covered in this project.You can also check a paint or home improvement store
for products specifically designed to clean dry, hard brushes.

Hoping to use old-fashioned soap and water to get the paint out? Sorry,
alkyd paint comes out only with solvent. To keep from making a mess 
in your sink, use this three-can method instead. Working in a garage or
outdoor area is best, but anywhere is fine as long as you protect the
area and make sure you have proper ventilation.
Before you begin, put on your gloves and goggles, and find a work area
that’s well ventilated and away from any heat source or open flame. Lay
down newspaper or dropcloths to protect your work surface.

towels. No paint should appear on the
paper towels, all having been removed
from the brushes.
5.
Repeat Steps 3 and 4, putting the brushes in the second container of paint thinner.
6.
Put the brushes into the third container, and let them soak for three minutes. 
Wiggle them once or twice. The liquid should be clean.

Cleaning Latex Paint from Roller 
Covers and Cages
If you don’t plan to reuse your roller cover, simply place it inside a plas-
tic grocery bag, pull it off the metal roller cage, and toss the bag and
roller cover in the trash. Clean the roller cage, and you’re done! If your
philosophy is “waste not, want not,” you can clean both items and use
them again. All you need is soap and water to rid rolling equipment of
latex paint. Just make sure your roller cover has a plastic core that will
stand up to water.
Toolbox:
 Rubber gloves
 5-in-1 tool
 Used roller cover and
cage
 Paint container
 Mild liquid soap
 Newspaper
 Wire brush
 Paper towels
Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Put on rubber gloves to keep your hands
clean. Use the curved side of your 5-in-1 tool
to scrape off any excess paint from the roller
cover into the paint container. You may need
to scrape for a minute or two to work out as
much paint as possible.
2.
Working over your paint tray, pull the roller
cover off the cage; set the cage aside for
now. Rinse the cover under warm running
water, massaging it from top to bottom with
either your 5-in-1 tool or your hands until
the water runs clear.

76
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
3.
Fill the sink with warm water and mild liquid
soap. Wash the cover in the sudsy water,
rubbing it with your hands to work the
soapy water well into the fibers.
4.
Drain the sink, and then rinse the roller
cover until the water runs clean. Squeeze
out excess water with your hands by encir-
cling the roller cover with your fingers and
thumb and sliding your hand in one direc-
tion. It may take several passes to get all the
water out.
5.
Stand the roller cover on its end atop some
newspapers to dry. When dry, store it on a
shelf on its end.
6.
Wash the metal roller cage in the sink with
mild liquid soap. Use a wire brush to work
off any dried paint that isn’t released by
soap and some elbow grease. Rinse the cage,
pat it dry with a paper towel, and store it.
To get the most water out of a wet roller cover, place the roller cover on the clean cage, take it outside, and spin
the roller as fast as you can to expel the water from the roller.

Cleaning Alkyd Paint from Roller 
Covers and Cages
Alkyd paint doesn’t come off with soap and water. You need to use paint
thinner and the three-can method instead. Lambswool roller covers are
probably worth saving, but if you’ve worked with alkyd paint, consider
tossing the synthetic kind. Just slip a plastic grocery bag over the
cover, slide it off the metal cage, and toss it in the trash. If you want to
clean and reuse your rolling equipment, this project’s for you.

4.
Working over your paint tray, slip the roller
cover off the cage. Lay it in one of the con-
tainers of paint thinner, and set the cage
aside. Let the cover soak for five minutes,
wiggling it around periodically to loosen the
paint.
5.
Remove the cover from the first container,
scrape off excess liquid with the curved side
of a 5-in-1 tool, and then wipe off the cover
with paper towels. (Wiping at this stage
helps to remove some of the diluted paint
and/or mineral spirits.)

9.
Repeat Step 5, and then stand the roller
cover on its end atop a stack of paper
towels to dry. (If you stand the cover on
newspaper, you could reactivate the ink
in the paper and ruin your cover.)
10. Let the roller cage sit in the first container
of paint thinner for two minutes. Remove
it and wipe it with paper towels to remove
loose paint.
11. Repeat Step 10, let the roller cage dry completely, and store it.
6.
Lay the cover in the second container of paint thinner. Let it soak for
three minutes, and then wiggle it around to remove more paint.

Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
Fixing problems after the fact
No matter how much you try to focus on
your painting and the job at hand, some
problems reveal themselves only after the
paint dries and you think the project’s fin-
ished. The most common problems you find
afterward are listed here. Although the prob-
lems themselves are different, the fix is
essentially the same: Prep the surface (see
Chapters 2 and 3) and apply another coat of
paint using the same roller or brush that you
used the first time around (see Chapter 4).
 Uneven coverage: White specks in the
painted surface are primer or undercoat
showing through and an indication that you
need another coat of paint. Dark splotches
are an indication that you didn’t stir the
paint thoroughly in the can before using it.
 Uneven paint finish: The problem may
just be the lighting in the room. Adjust
the light in that particular area by chang-
ing the direction of the light, changing
the bulb, getting a new fixture, or adjust-
ing window coverings and the level of
sunlight on the surface. If you still see a
mix of finishes, the problem may be that
you mixed up your paints, accidentally
touching up a matte finish with semi-
gloss or vice versa. Use 220-grit sandpa-
per to sand the uneven area until the
paint is dull. Then use a hand vacuum to
remove any residue, and repaint the area
with the correct paint.
 Damaged paint: Over time, your paint
job may suffer scrapes, dings, or even
lose its luster thanks to overzealous
cleaning. Before you repaint the dam-
aged area, scrape away loose paint
using a 5-in-1 tool, sand the area with
220-grit sandpaper, and wipe or vacuum
away any residue.
 Drips: Drips are likely the result of over-
loading your brush or roller and apply-
ing too much paint. To erase a dry drip,
use 220-grit sandpaper to sand down-
ward over the drip, working in only one
direction. You want to sand away only
the drip and spare the surrounding paint.
Wipe or vacuum any residue from the
area, and touch up the paint using a trim
brush and a light stroke.
Cleaning paint spills and spatters
The best advice for cleaning up spills and spat-
ters is to paint carefully and clean up as you
go. If you find paint on your skin, clothes, or
elsewhere, this list tells you how to remove it:
 Cleaning paint from your skin: Latex
paints come off with soap and water. Use
a soft nylon brush and gentle soap — both
should be made for use on skin — and
rinse with warm water. Don’t use thinner
or other chemicals — they’re toxic and
can make you sick. For hard-to-remove
substances, such as alkyd or oil-based
paints, pick up specialized skin cleaner
from your home improvement store
(auto parts stores sell it, too).
 Cleaning paint from clothes: Most latex
paint washes out with warm water and
detergent. Pretreat the stained area with a
solution of detergent and water. Wash on
the longest cycle possible. Repeat as
needed. Never dry clothes that have stains
because the heat sets the stain. For alkyd
paint, dab some paint thinner on the spot
and rinse well in water. Wash separately.
 Cleaning paint from carpet: Use a damp,
not wet, sponge and gently blot to lift
latex paint. You may have to repeat this
step several times. You can also find
commercial products for cleaning dry
latex paint at your hardware store. Clean
alkyd paint drips immediately — don’t let
them dry. Repeatedly dab a clean rag
dipped in mineral spirits on the paint spot.
It takes time to get all the paint out, but it
should clean up. If the paint dries, you can
only scrape the drip gently and hope that
you’ll remove some of the paint.

Storing Paint
Toolbox:
 Newspaper
 Leftover paint
 Paintbrush
 Small empty paint cans
 Paint strainer or 
cheesecloth
 Permanent marker
 Towel or rag
 Rubber mallet
Time Needed:
Less than an hour
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Properly saved paint can last up to three years, so you should definitely
save your leftover paint for touch ups. The trick is to minimize the 
air — the enemy of paint — inside the can. For example, if you finish
your project with about a quart of paint left and you store it in the
gallon-sized container that it came in, all the excess air in the can will
dry out the paint. Buy extra gallon- and quart-sized cans to hold your left-
overs. Empty paint cans cost only a dollar or two and are well worth it.
1.
Cover your workspace in newspaper, and
then pour the leftover paint from roller trays
and containers into the original paint can (so
that it’s easier to pour into the strainer after
all the paint has been collected). Use a paint-
brush to sweep out all excess paint that may
have collected on the sides and bottom of
the containers, getting as much paint as pos-
sible back into the original can.
2.
Set up the new can with a strainer on top.
Strain all the debris that may have been 
left behind by brushes and rollers by pour-
ing the paint into the new can through a
strainer. Let the strained paint run into the
smallest can that will hold it all.

82
Part I: Preparing for Your Painting Project 
3.
Put a dot of paint on the lid, and use a per-
manent marker to write all the paint informa-
tion on the can. Include the manufacturer,
paint name, type of finish, date of purchase,
and place of purchase.
4. Place the lid on the can, cover it with a
towel or rag, and tap it shut using a rubber
mallet to keep from distorting the lid. Tap
only around the perimeter of the lid, not in
the center (that will bend the lid and hinder
its ability to seal correctly). If you don’t have
a mallet, place a piece of wood over the lid
and use your hammer to tap the wood.
5.
Store the paint in a cool, dry place.
You should always store paint away from heat, which means away from water heaters, clothes dryers, dishwash-
ers, direct sunlight, and anything that may raise the ambient temperature or create a spark. If you wish to dis-
pose of paint or other toxic chemicals, you must contact your local waste disposal site. Paint is toxic to plants,
pets, and people.Treat it as hazardous waste and don’t pour it down a drain or dispose of it in a landfill.
Recording paint information on the can is important because if you need to purchase more paint or if there’s a
problem with the paint, the paint store will have all the information needed to either make more or fix the prob-
lem.

Part II
Painting Walls 
Like a Pro

In this part . . .
You can probably tell at a glance whether a paint job
was done by a child or an adult. But is it so easy to
tell whether a room was painted by a professional or an
amateur? It depends on how much know-how that amateur
has. In this part, we give you what you need to up your
game to the professional level.
Faux finishes and impressive effects take center stage in
this part. Leaf through the pages to see what you can
achieve with paint, glaze, the proper tools, and the two
things no painter can do without: patience and persever-
ance. Follow the photos and read through the step-by-step
instructions to make these fun decorative techniques
come to life in your own home.

F
aux finishes (pronounced foh, French for false) are paint tech-
niques that make a painted wall look old when it’s new, rough
when it’s smooth, or like some other material — such as leather or
silk — when it’s not. By adding dimension and drama to otherwise
plain surfaces, they give you lots of decorative bang for the buck
just for the price of the paint and your time.
A common mistake that amateur painters make on faux finishes is
banding the corners. Avoid this mistake by working on two oppos-
ing — not adjacent — walls on the first day of your weekend proj-
ect. On the second day, mask off the walls you did the previous day
with delicate stick tape. If you do only two opposing walls each day,
you can mask off the opposite walls and work up to the tape. This
trick helps you avoid an odd line around the room and keep corners consistent without affecting
the look of walls that are next to each other.

Measure twice, paint once 
Shapes and patterns may give the impres-
sion that they’re random. But, in fact, you
have to measure, level, and figure if you
want to do several of the designs in this
chapter. If you paint vertical stripes on the
wall without penciling in the stripes and
without using a plumb line, you quickly real-
ize that two walls don’t always meet at a
precise 90-degree angle.
Create a plumb line by hanging a weighted
string on a nail at the top of a wall — use a
string that reaches from the ceiling almost
to the floor. When you’re painting stripes,
measure them from this exact vertical line.
Follow these steps to mark off the place-
ment of your first stripe:
1. Put a yardstick right on top of the plumb
line and measure off where the first
stripe will start.
2. Mark the spot by making a small mark
with your pencil.
3.Move the yardstick to another spot on
the plumb line, and make another pencil
mark.
4.Repeat until you have enough pencil
marks to draw a straight line from the
ceiling to the floor.
5.Follow all the steps again to mark off the
other side of your first stripe.
Use these steps to measure and pencil in
each stripe along one wall. Then rehang the
plumb line on another wall and start all over
again. For best results, do some calculating
ahead of time so that you don’t run out of
space for the square or stripe you want to
end up with.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Stripes can be horizontal or vertical, thin or thick, simple one color or
trickier two (or more) colors, precisely or imprecisely edged. You also
can alternate the widths of your lines or make the spacing consistent.
Whether you use semi-gloss and flat sheens of the same color or
sharply contrasting colors, stripes are lively and work well for dining
rooms, hallways, and powder rooms. Generally, your base color should
be lighter than your stripe or stripes. 
1.
Prep the room according to the instructions in Chapter 2. Paint on the base
color (see Chapter 4) and let it dry for at least 4 hours. You can paint over
a pre-existing base coat as long as it’s eggshell, satin, or semi-gloss.
2.
Determine the width of the stripes. Measure
each wall with a tape measure and divide the
length of your wall by the width of your
stripe to figure out how many stripes you’ll
have. Plan out the stripe pattern so that you
don’t end up with any partial stripes in awk-
ward places. Example: If your wall is 10 feet
wide and you want your stripes to be 6
inches wide, you can place 20 stripes on the
wall. (Convert 10 feet to 120 inches, and then
120 inches  6 inches = 20.)

87
Chapter 5: Faux Finishes with Shapes and Patterns
3.
Pace off horizontal spacing between stripes.
Start at eye level in the most inconspicuous
spot (at a corner near the door) and meas-
ure off the inches according to your plan.
Marking every 4 to 5 inches creates a tradi-
tional wide stripe. Mark the stripe spacing
with a colored pencil that closely matches
the stripe paint.
4.
Repeat Step 3 both above and below your
first set of marks (like at the ceiling and at
baseboard level) so that you have three
marks for each line.
5.
Use a level to draw a vertical line down
from each mark at the ceiling toward the
floor, using your colored pencil. Use light
pressure to make marks, and use all the
marks as guidelines.
6.
Mask off every other stripe with blue
painter’s tape. Burnish the tape by running 
a plastic putty knife or credit card over it 
in both directions to make sure the tape is
pressed tightly against the wall and the paint
won’t bleed under it.

88
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
7.
Mark the stripes that you’re not going to
paint with pieces of tape. You may want to
put Xs on them to indicate that you don’t
paint those stripes.
8.
Paint the stripes onto the wall with your
mini-roller. Roll over the tape to prevent
working it off the wall and creating seepage.
9.
Pull the tape off the wall as soon as possible
after completing each stripe. Pull off the tape
as you work around the room. If you peel off
the tape and notice seepage and bleeding,
clean off the paint with a damp sponge. If it’s
too late, you’ll have to repaint the base color
stripes. Use a paint guard and 2-inch angled
sash brush to touch up, or wait until the
other stripes are dry before masking the
areas off and touching up.
Using metric measurements is a lot easier than using inches (and fractions!) when you’re spacing out your
stripes.You don’t have to wear out your brain trying to interpret what those little lines mean or keep a lot of
strange numbers in your head long enough to write them down. In the long run, you’ll make fewer mistakes.
If you’ve ever seen professional painters on decorating shows scratching their heads in confusion as they try to
figure out a two-tone pattern, you know the danger of skipping Step 7! Don’t do it! Any extra time you spend
marking sections to paint is worthwhile because you end up making fewer mistakes in the long run.

89
Chapter 5: Faux Finishes with Shapes and Patterns
Putting on Horizontal Stripes
For a contemporary look, create three equal horizontal bands of graduated
color with the darkest color on the bottom. The effect, created by Miami
designer Alfredo Brito, makes low-ceiling rooms look less squatty. From a
paint strip, pick a dark, medium, and light color. Grays, browns, and neutral-
ized colors work best.

Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
2.
Measure the height of your wall with a tape
measure and divide it into three sections
(top, middle, and bottom). Mark off the three
sections using a level and a pencil. Follow
these lines horizontally around the room.
3.
Use painter’s tape to prep the middle of your
three sections. Mask off the top section by
placing the tape just above the pencil line.
Mask off the bottom section by placing the
tape just below the pencil line.
4.
To prevent seeping paint under the tape, use
a horizontal motion to score the top of the
tape that’s above the bottom section with a
utility knife.

91
Chapter 5: Faux Finishes with Shapes and Patterns
5.
Use your roller to paint the middle strip 
with the medium paint color. Let it dry for 
4 hours, and then remove the tape.
6.
Mask off the middle section by placing tape
on top of the bottom edge of the middle sec-
tion. You don’t want any space between the
middle and bottom sections. You don’t need
to score this tape line.

92
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
7.
Use your roller to apply the dark color all
the way to the floor (painting over any base-
boards; see Chapter 9 for trim painting tips).
8.
Remove the tape.
If you remove the tape and you notice that the line isn’t straight, you can use an artist’s brush and the appropri-
ate paint color to clean up the edges.
If you’re using this technique on the entire room, mark all the walls with the carpenter’s level (or laser level) and
a pencil first. Mask off the middle stripe all the way around the room, paint all the middle stripes, and let them
dry. Use a 2-inch angled sash brush to cut in corners. Mask for the bottom sections all the way around the room,
and paint all the bottom stripes at the same time.

Decorating with Stencils
You can use stencils to create allover, random, or discrete patterns and
decorative borders horizontally at the ceiling or chair rail level of a wall
or vertically on a wall. This project guides you through the application
of a horizontally aligned stencil using two colors.
Precut stencils in every architectural and decorative style are widely
available at arts and crafts, home improvement, and paint stores. For a
unique style statement, make your own stencils by cutting out a design
with a hobby knife from a sheet of Mylar plastic. For unexpected flair,
layer two or more stencils to create a custom design. (Simply proceed
around the room with one stencil, let the paint dry for at least an hour,
and then go back around applying paint with the other stencil.)

2.
Dust any debris off the stencil with a clean

Place the top of the stencil at the height you
want it on your wall in an inconspicuous
corner of the room. Place your level along
the bottom of the stencil, and make neces-
sary adjustments for level.
4.
Tape the stencil in place with a small piece
of blue tape on each of the four corners.
5.
Find one of the stencil’s four registration
points (found in the four corners), and lift
one corner of the stencil away from the wall.
Place a small piece of blue painter’s tape on
the wall under the stencil at the registration
point. Put the corner back down.

95
Chapter 5: Faux Finishes with Shapes and Patterns
6.
Use a pencil to mark the registration hole on
the blue tape. Repeat this process with the
other three registration points on the stencil.
7.
Remove the stencil from the wall and place it immedi-
ately to the right of its previous placement, aligning the
left registration points with the right ones that you
marked with blue tape in Steps 5 and 6. Tape the stencil
in place.
8.
Lift one of the right two corners of the stencil, place a
piece of blue tape under the registration point, put the
corner back down, and mark the registration point on
the tape with a pencil. Repeat with the other right
corner.
9.
Repeat Steps 7 and 8 all the way around the room. The last stencil probably
won’t be a complete pattern, which is why you should always start and end
in an inconspicuous corner.
10. Put on your latex gloves, and prepare your
paint by shaking or stirring up the paint or
paints you’re using with your stencil. Pour
some of each paint onto a plastic plate.

96
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
12. Place the stencil on the wall, aligning the
four registration points on the stencil with
the points on the blue tape, and press it into
place. To make sure the stencil doesn’t move
around on the wall, you may want to tack
each corner with a bit of blue tape.
13. Load a brush with paint by gently dipping
the tips of the brush in the paint.
14. Blot off excess paint by tapping the bristle
tips on a paper towel in a straight, vertical
motion. The brush is ready to go when the
bristles look almost dry.
11. In a well-ventilated area, lay down newspa-
per and place the stencil facedown on top.
Spray adhesive on the back of the stencil
and let it set until tacky to the touch.

97
Chapter 5: Faux Finishes with Shapes and Patterns
16. Use the same pouncing action and clean
brushes to apply a second highlight or low-
light color to the stenciled design as desired.
17. To reposition the stencil farther along the wall, lift the
stencil off the wall with one clean motion, and align the
registration points with the ones you marked on blue
tape on the wall. You don’t need to reapply adhesive as
you move around the room.
Note: As you work your way around the room or sur-
face, clean the paint off the stencil periodically to pre-
vent bleeding and seepage. Lay the stencil on a flat,
protected surface, and use a damp paper towel to wipe
off excess paint.
15. Starting at the outer perimeters of the stencil,
lightly pounce color onto the wall by quickly
touching the bristles to the wall and pulling 
the brush straight away. Stencil the design by
working from the outside of the stencil to the
inside.
The pouncing motion is done perpendicular to the wall surface. Don’t stroke your brush from side to side or up
and down or you’ll end up working the paint under the stencil and losing the definition of the design.

Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
18. To stencil in a corner, use gentle pressure to
hold the stencil in place, and apply paint in
the same pouncing manner. Be careful not to
use so much pressure that you bend the
stencil and distort the design. If you’re
having trouble, use a drywall spackle knife
to hold the stencil in place; line up the sten-
cil’s registration points and then gently
press the knife (vertically) straight into the
corner.
19. After you stencil your design all around the
room or space that you’re working in, go
back and fill in blank spots and gaps with 
an artist’s small liner brush and very little
paint. Blot excess paint on a paper towel,
and make sure that the brush is almost dry
before you touch up the stencil.
If your design involves using a second overlay stencil, complete one wall or section before going back over 
the design with the overlay stencil. Match up the registration marks on the overlay, and repeat the steps in 
this project.
Some stencils look best if the paint coverage has variation whereas others look better if the coverage is even
and complete. Experiment first on a piece of poster board to find the look you like. For uneven coverage, vary 
the angle of the brush. For even coverage, go over the stencil pattern a second time.

Creating Cloudy Skies
Big fluffy clouds are easier to create with paint than you may think. Use
them on bathroom ceilings and children’s rooms or anywhere else you
want a bit of peaceful whimsy. A great thing about clouds is that they
don’t have to cover every surface — paint them above a chair rail, on
the top third of each wall, or on only one focal wall or the ceiling.
The key to pretty, realistic clouds is layering glazes in lighter and darker
blues, white, and even a little pink. Because you work with a number of
paint colors and different tools, take your sky and clouds on a trial run
by painting them on poster boards.

1.
Sketch a scaled-down version of your
fluffy clouds on a piece of paper.
(One sheet of 81⁄2-x-11-inch paper
neatly accommodates a plan for one
8-x-10-foot wall.) Cloud formations
should overlap and vary in length,
height, and fluffiness. For inspiration,
look at some of your own photo-
graphs as well as photography books
or Web sites.
3.
Mix three glazes in the buckets: one for the white
clouds, one for the cloud lowlights, and one for the
cloud highlights. Check the glaze manufacturer’s 
instructions for paint-to-glaze-to-water ratios. 
Increase the amount of glaze for greater translucency.
Stir each glaze mixture thoroughly with a stir stick.
2.
Prep the room according to instructions in Chapter 2, and paint on the sky
blue base color (see Chapter 4 for info on painting a base coat). Let the
base coat dry at least 4 hours to overnight. Leave up any tape or 
masking.
4.
Float your first cloud by using a 2-inch flat
sash brush to paint a long, irregular streak of
white glaze at the visual center of your focal
wall.

101
Chapter 5: Faux Finishes with Shapes and Patterns
5.
Tap the streak gently with the large sheep-
skin pad to remove excess paint and fluff out
the cloud. Take off more paint toward the
edges of the cloud so that it appears to grad-
ually blend into the blue sky.
6.
Refer to your sketch for the placement of
your next cloud, and repeat Steps 4 and 5,
applying paint and blending it with the
sheepskin. Repeat for all the other clouds 
on the wall.
7.
To make the clouds more realistic and dra-
matic, use the purple-blue glaze toward the
upper region of your sky and overlapping
some of the clouds. Apply wavy strokes of
purple-blue glaze with a 2-inch flat sash
brush.

8.
Dampen a clean rag, wring it out well, and
wad it up. Use the rag to dab the purple-blue
glaze, blending it into the white clouds and
the blue sky at the edges.
9.
Use a 2-inch flat sash brush to add streaks 
of pink glaze highlights to the crests of the
clouds.
10. With the sheepskin pad, tap and pounce the
pink glaze to blend it in with the surrounding
colors.
Cloud painting kits are widely available at home improvement, paint supply, and craft stores.They come with the
tools needed for the job, and some even include paints or at the very least recommendations of specific paint
colors.
If a cloud or two looks too heavy after the glaze dries, use a small sponge to pounce on sky blue glaze. Mix the
glaze in a small container with a ratio of 1⁄2 cup glaze to 1⁄2 cup paint.

Color Blocking
If you can put tape on a wall, you can color block. This super-simple
technique is great for creating a high-impact wall (but resist the tempta-
tion to overdo it by using the technique on every wall in a room), and
it’s a great way to draw eyes to framed photos or artwork.
Make sure you burnish the painter’s tape, which means that you run a
plastic putty knife or a credit card over it in both directions. If you don’t
get a tight seal from your tape, the paint is likely to bleed and you lose
the sharp lines you’re aiming for.

After you settle on the design you want, begin measur-
ing off the squares. Use the level to make sure your
lines are straight, and mark the design with a pencil
along the yardstick.
1.
Prepare the room and walls according to the instructions in Chapter 2.
Cut in and roll on your base coat (see Chapter 4 if you need help paint-
ing a base coat). Apply a second coat, if necessary, and allow the base
coat to dry completely, preferably overnight.
Use a computer word processing program to experiment with color combinations and color-block arrangements.
Microsoft Word has an “AutoShapes” function that allows you to easily create boxes, fill them with color, move
them around, and change their dimensions.

Select one of your darker, coordinating paint
colors. Pour the paint into the tray and pre-
pare your smooth-surface paint roller by
loading it with paint.
5.
Use the roller to apply paint inside the tape
lines for every shape that you want to paint
this color. If you’re using another darker,

Crafting a Tone-on-Tone Checkerboard
A pattern of matte and semi-gloss paint squares gives a wall a cool, con-
temporary look that’s high-impact without taking over the room. You use
one color in two finishes to paint a clean, tone-on-tone checkerboard 
pattern.

1.
Prep the room according to the instructions in Chapter 2, and
paint on the eggshell finish base coat (see Chapter 4 for more
on painting a base coat). Let the base coat dry at least 4 hours
to overnight. Leave up any tape or masking.
2.
Measure the length and height of your wall
to determine the size squares (or rectangles,
if necessary) that will best fit. You want the
squares to be at least 12 inches on each side.
For example, if your wall is 9 feet tall by 15
feet wide, 18-inch squares fit evenly into the
space; this is the size square used in the
remainder of this project.
3.
Using the yardstick and colored pencil, tick
off 18-inch increments across the wall. Use
the yardstick and small level side by side to
draw straight vertical lines on the wall.

106

4.
Using the yardstick and colored
pencil, tick off 18-inch increments
from top to bottom along the wall.
Use the yardstick and level side by
side to draw straight horizontal lines
on the wall.
5.
Place a piece of blue tape in the
center of every other square, alter-
nating in each row so that you mark
off a checkerboard pattern. These
are the squares that will remain in
the eggshell finish.
6.
Apply blue painter’s tape to the 
penciled lines on either side of the
squares marked in Step 5. Start with the
row closest to the ceiling, and tape off
alternating squares in every other row.
Burnish the tape by running a plastic
putty knife or credit card over it in both
directions to make sure the tape is
pressed tightly against the wall and the
paint won’t bleed under it.

107

7.
Put on latex gloves, and use a stir stick to thoroughly
stir the semi-gloss paint. Pour some into a paint tray.
8.
Use a mini-roller to paint the untaped
squares with semi-gloss paint.
Remember: You’re painting the
squares not marked with tape in Step 5,
and you’re painting alternate squares
in every other row. Let the paint dry
completely before carefully removing
the tape.
Disposing of paint and cleanup liquids
Paint is toxic to plants, pets, and people.
Treat it as hazardous waste and don’t pour it
down a drain or dispose of it in a landfill. If
you do, it may eventually leach into and
contaminate the groundwater. Here are
some ways that you can be green:
 To clean brushes and rollers: Use your
handy 5-in-1 tool to scrape off all excess
paint from rollers and brushes into paint
cans. Or you can use a spinner to spin off
the excess paint into a container —
either a cardboard box or 5-gallon paint
bucket lined with a trash bag — and then
take the trash to a disposal site for haz-
ardous waste. After you get rid of the
excess paint, you can clean your rollers
and brushes as normal (see the projects
in Chapter 4 that tell you how to clean
paint from roller covers and cages for
details).
 To dispose of cleanup supplies: Put all
your cleanup liquids into a 5-gallon
bucket and store the covered container
in a cool, dry place. Collect all your sol-
vent-soaked rags and toss them into a
bag. Do the same for all your old paint
cans (make sure lids are shut tight). You
can then take them to a hazardous waste
disposal site or the site your community
designates.
Remember: If you don’t know your commu-
nity’s policies on disposing of chemicals,
contact your local government. (Most towns
have a Web site with this info.) Don’t forget
to ask your homeowners association about
disposing of paint — some associations
have stringent guidelines.

A harlequin pattern looks great but can be maddening if you try to
apply it to big spaces or around corners. That endeavor requires a level
of math and measuring that we can’t recommend in good conscience.
So we suggest that you use a harlequin pattern instead in a nook or as a
backsplash. Or apply it as a border, on one narrow wall, or above a
chair rail.
2.
Plot diamonds on the wall in whatever size
you want. Diamonds should be about
twice as long as they are wide. Use the
yardstick and level to ensure that your
diamonds line up vertically and horizon-
tally, and mark the points in colored
pencil.
1.
Prep the room according to instructions in Chapter 2, and paint on your desired
base color (see Chapter 4 for more on painting a base coat). Let the base coat dry at
least 4 hours to overnight, and then apply a second coat for good coverage if desired.
Leave up any tape or masking.

109
Chapter 5: Faux Finishes with Shapes and Patterns
3.
Using the yardstick and colored pencil, 
draw diagonal lines connecting the points 
to create the diamond shapes.
4.
Place a piece of blue tape in the center
of every diamond in every other row.
(If you look at the wall from an angle, it
should look like a checkerboard pat-
tern.) These are the squares that will
remain in the base coat color.
5.
Starting with the row closest to the ceiling,
apply blue painter’s tape to the penciled
lines on either side of the diamonds marked
in Step 4. Tape off all the diamonds in this
row, and burnish the tape by running a plas-
tic putty knife or credit card over it in both
directions to make sure the tape is pressed
tightly against the wall and the paint won’t
bleed under it.

6.
Repeat Step 5 in every other row (the dia-
monds marked with tape in the center) to
the bottom of the wall.
7.
Put on gloves, and use a stir stick to stir the second (accent)
color of paint thoroughly. Pour some into a paint tray.
Turn a hair dryer on the lowest setting and wave it over the tape before you remove it to loosen the adhesive
and to help make sure that the paint doesn’t come up with the tape.
If the points of your diamonds don’t quite match up, use a small square or circular stamp to apply a third color
at the joints.This accent easily covers the rough joints without detracting from the design.
9.
Let the paint dry completely (about 4 to 6 hours) before carefully removing the tape. 
Let the paint dry overnight.
8.
Using a mini-roller, apply the accent paint
to the untaped diamonds.

F
aux finishes, like the ones in this chapter, generally call for a
base coat and one or more glaze coats or other specialized
pearl, opal, metallic, or sandy-texture paints. Think of the base
coat as the fresh paint you just put on your walls — the final coat
when you don’t plan any special wall treatments. When you’re
tackling the special treatments in this chapter, the base coat
serves as the undercoat for glaze. But remember that the base
coat contributes color to the overall effect of the faux finish, so
you want to select a base coat color that’s compatible with your
color scheme. You can apply the base coat anywhere from 4 hours,
absolute minimum, to 7 days before you apply the glaze. But don’t
wait too long to glaze or you’ll need to clean your walls (and then
wait for them to dry) before you faux.
You have two choices in selecting paint for a base coat. The first is
to choose any latex satin or semi-gloss paint. That gives you an
opportunity to create your own color palette and make sure it coor-
dinates with the furnishings in your home. The other option is to
go to the paint store and purchase products sold exclusively as base
coats and coordinating glazes. These products come in various
colors. Look for the informative pamphlets; they have color photos showing how
each finish will look if you use a different glaze or technique. And they tell you what
tools you need.
If you want to create your own palette, just make sure that you have latex satin or
semi-gloss paint for the base. (Your walls don’t have to be freshly painted, but make
sure you wash them thoroughly before you get started.) The paint store or home
improvement center will tint a transparent glaze to your specifications; don’t worry
about pigmentation — the store takes care of that too.
If you’re adventurous enough to tint your own glaze, read the manufacturer’s
instructions first. Most manufacturers say to use one quart of your color with a
gallon of glaze, but directions may vary from brand to brand. And buy quality glaze.
It pays off in ease of use and the pattern and texture of the finished product.
Always use a paint that has some sheen as a base coat. Eggshell will work, but satin
or semi-gloss interior latex paint is preferred. Matte paint won’t work — it’s porous
and dull.
After you put down the base coat and let it dry, you’re ready to apply the glaze coat.
Glazes are either added or taken away with one of these two basic techniques:

Positive/additive: Techniques that call for applying glaze to select areas
over the base coat are called positive or additive techniques because glaze is
added only where you want it. Additive techniques allow most of the base
coat to show through.

Negative/subtractive: Techniques that call for removing select areas of an
allover glaze applied over a base coat are called negative or subtractive tech-
niques because portions of the glaze are lifted off. Negative techniques
cover most of the base coat and therefore emphasize the glaze color.
Creating faux finishes can be a lot of fun. To make sure that your faux finish experi-
ences are good ones, experiment! Follow these tips:

Always practice on cardboard or poster board first to test the technique
and your color choices. Try out various color combinations, using hues that
coordinate with your furnishings. The poster board gives you a chance to
experiment with the amount of glaze to use and how to use different tools.
Use glaze in a combination of colors and reverse the order in which they’re
applied to find out which one you like most. Try putting a medium glaze on
the base color, and then adding a lighter glaze. Glaze another section that
has the medium glaze on top.

Vary the way in which you hold equipment. For instance, change the angle
of a brush or use each side of a sea sponge to give glaze different effects.
Pick the one you prefer before starting the project.

Don’t limit yourself to tools just for faux painting. Whisk brooms, dust mops,
squeegees, and ordinary sponges (all new, naturally) create different looks.

For more complex finishes, layer additive and subtractive techniques, using
different glaze colors for each step.

Have two (or more) sets of finishing tools — one for working with the first
section (or couple of sections) and another one for subsequent sections.
Your sponges, rags, and other tools for fauxing can become too saturated
with paint to maintain the integrity of your desired effect. Clean off oversat-
urated brushes with damp rags and sponges, or give them a quick rinse and
spin dry for use on other areas.

After you finish your project, brush on a clear sealant, such as polyurethane
or a protective coating put out by the manufacturer. Seal the finish espe-
cially when it’s in a high traffic area or to protect flat surfaces on desks,
tables, and dressers.
When you’re applying glaze, speed — not accuracy — is the issue. Although you
(usually) don’t have to thoroughly cover an area with paint or leave clean edges, you
do need to work with glaze while it’s wet. Work with a partner when you have a lot to
do, the surface is large, or the day is hot and dry (glaze dries quicker on these days).
To help you work quickly, section your wall off mentally before you start glazing.
Work in a 4-by-4-foot space, staring an adjacent section while the glaze is still wet.
After you glaze one section of the wall, finish it with your sponge (or other finishing
tool) almost to the edge, leaving a wet border. Then, without putting more glaze on
the border, glaze another complete section. When it’s wet, go back to the border 
and sponge it, working your way across the new section. But stop in time to leave
another wet border on the edges, and then start sponging again. Repeat glazing and
finishing, section by section, until you complete the wall.

Chapter 6: Faux Finishes Using Glaze
Colorwashing
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Colorwashing creates glowing
color and great depth that calls to
mind the ambiance of a country
villa. It’s a perfect visual disguise
for uneven walls, but it looks great
on smooth ones, too. Colorwashing
calls for using two strongly related
glaze colors — one medium and
the other a deep variation — over a
neutral base coat to create a dis-
tressed, time worn, old-world
finish. Any neutral or neutralized
color works well as a base coat.
You can stay within the color
family by using the lightest value of
your glaze color palette. Or you
can use white.
To create the look, use a big brush
to apply and blend out the deep
color over your medium
midground hue. Change the posi-
tion of your wrist and arm often,
switch directions frequently, and
stand back to take a look after you complete a section. You can fix what
doesn’t look quite right as long as you work quickly, before the glaze dries.
Practice this technique on a piece of poster board first to see how subtle
or dramatic you want your finished wall to look.

coat of paint). Let dry at least 4 hours to overnight. (You can color-
wash over an existing base coat as long as it isn’t matte — it has to
have some sheen.)
2.
According to the manufacturers’ instructions,
combine glaze with the light and dark paints
in two separate buckets or paint containers.
Stir thoroughly with stir sticks

114
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
3.
Use a 3-inch flat sash brush to stroke on the
first glaze from your paint container in an
“X” starting near the ceiling.
4.
Use your other 3-inch flat sash brush to
stroke on a second “X” with the second glaze
next to the first “X”. You’re making a
checkerboard pattern, slightly overlapping
the two glaze colors. Be careful not to have
too much paint on your brush — you don’t
want to create a blob effect on the wall.
Working in a 3-by-3-foot section at a time is
easiest.
5.
After completing each 3-by-3-foot section,
take a terry cloth towel and blot over the
top of the X’s in order to soften the look.
Stand back and take a look after you com-
plete a section. Does the brushwork look
random? If not, you can “erase” an area
with a damp cloth and rework. Does it
look too definite? Then blot over some
brush lines with a soft, dry rag.
For foolproof colors, pick two variations of a shade from a paint strip. Many strips have three to five tints (white
has been added) or tones (black has been added). Make sure that the values (the degree of light versus dark)
are distinct so that the effect is satisfactory to you.The farther apart the colors are in tonal value, the more dra-
matic the effect.You can also create a simplified colorwash by dabbing and brushing only one shade of glaze
over a white or neutral background.

115
Chapter 6: Faux Finishes Using Glaze
6.
Take a small chip brush with some glaze on
it and push the glaze into any voids near the
ceiling.
7.
Move down the wall to the next 3-by-3-foot
section and repeat Steps 5 and 6. Always
work from a dry undone area back to a wet
area.
8.
Use a terry cloth towel to blend the sections
together as you complete them. You can use
your small chip brush to push glaze into the
base of the wall and corners.
9.
Continue working until you finish the wall,
and then go around the room.

This wall finish is an easy way to give a casual and relaxed feeling to a
room. You don’t have to gather many materials, and the project can be
done in one or more layers. Start this project by examining your base
color. You can glaze over what’s already on your wall, or choose a base
color in an eggshell finish to ensure the easiest and best results. Choose a
glaze color that’s a darker shade than your base color. Ask the retailer to
tint it for you.

3.
Dip the 2-inch flat sash brush into the glaze, and
cut in at the upper corner and the ceiling.
4.
Dip a damp rag into the glaze and apply it to
the wall next to the area you glazed in Step
3. Begin wiping in a small circular or squiggly
motion. Blend into the corner and work the
glaze out (horizontally) and down (verti-
cally) from the corner until you have no
glaze left on the rag. Working in 3-by-3-foot
areas is easiest.
2.
Fill one bucket with glaze (check out the

and fill the other bucket half full with water.

118

7.
After the walls are completely dry (in general,
let it dry overnight), spot touch any light spots
by using the same blending technique.
If you’re satisfied with the look, you’re done. Or you can wait until the glaze is dry to add another layer of a dif-
ferent color.This second layer gives the glaze a deeper shade and has a softer and more blended appearance.
5.
Start a foot or so away from the wet glaze,
and follow Step 4 again, this time blending
into the wet area and farther down toward
the floor.
6.
Continue working wet into wet in blended patches until you finish one wall;
continue at the top of the next wall, moving around the room. Be sure to use
the brush to cut in at all woodwork.

Dragging is a paint technique that involves applying a base coat and a
glaze and then dragging over the glaze to subtract some of it and partially
reveal the base coat. It can be used to create a number of looks, including
strié (from the French word for “striate” or “stripe”), grasscloth, denim,
and linen.
Ideally, dragging is easiest when you have two painting partners working
together: One applies the glaze, and the other does the dragging with a
brush or comb. Use a poster board to experiment with the type of bristles
and brushes you have on hand to create the desired effect.
As with any of the faux effects, subtle neutrals produce a refined, low-key
look whereas bold hues create a casual, high-energy style. For dragging,
you can use two related colors, such as pale yellow over gold, or two con-
trasting colors, such as pale blue over buff. For ideas, check out the many
brochures available in home improvement or paint stores. Some paint
manufacturers have already worked out fail-safe color combinations that
you may want to consider.

1.
Prep the room according to the instructions in Chapter 2, and apply a base
coat of satin finish latex paint (see Chapter 4 for base coat how-to informa-
tion). Let it dry at least 4 hours to overnight. Leave on any blue painter’s
tape, and tape any additional areas such as the ceiling, tops of door casings,
or bottoms of window casings as needed.
2.
Start in one corner of the room and use the 4-
foot level to measure over 3 feet horizontally.
Starting at the ceiling and going down toward
the baseboard, make a perpendicular reference
line from the 3-foot point and mark it approxi-
mately every 2 feet with blue painter’s tape.
Repeat this process all the way around the
room, making sure that your lines are level.
3.
Put on latex gloves. In a bucket, combine
glaze with the other paint color (follow the
manufacturer’s instructions). Stir well with a
stir stick, and pour the glaze mixture into a
roller tray.
4.
Starting in the most inconspicuous corner
and up near the ceiling, cut in using your
mini-roller; roll glaze along the ceiling line,
down the corner, and across the top of the
baseboard (cut in about 11⁄4 to 2 feet). Work
in a 3- to 5-foot wide section. Note: It may be
necessary to use a small chip brush to work
glaze into tight corners.

121
Chapter 6: Faux Finishes Using Glaze
5.
Working quickly and with a zigzag motion,
roll on the glaze using your mini-roller in the
area you cut in. There’s no need to be pre-
cise with the rolling; the important part is to
keep the glaze wet so that you can create the
best effect.
6.
Starting at the top corner near the ceiling,
place the tips of a clean 3-inch dragging
brush (or comb) on the wall. (Use a pencil-
grip, mentioned in Chapter 4, if you want
maximum control over speed and pressure.)
Drag the brush down the wall in one continu-
ous stroke, keeping in line with your marked
level lines.
For stronger lines, use more pressure; and for
softer lines, use less pressure.
7.
Clean off the brush at the end of the pass by
wiping it on a clean rag.

122
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
10. Repeat the application of glaze (cutting in and rolling on) and drag-
ging off in 3- to 5-foot wide sections of wall.
For more complexity, place the brush at the ceiling line and drag downward to the halfway point. Clean off the
brush with a dry rag.Then place the cleaned brush at the baseboard and drag upward to meet the downward
lines at the halfway point. For visual variety, you can also stagger the points where the two directions meet.
For linen and denim effects, drag the brush through the glaze vertically. Let it dry for 20 minutes, and then apply
a second coat of glaze. Drag the glaze off horizontally.Wipe the brush off on a clean rag after each pass.
8.
Repeat Steps 6 and 7, dragging over the area cut in and rolled in Steps 4 and 5.
Switch to a clean rag when the one you’re using can no longer remove the
excess paint from your dragging brush.
9.
When you come to the edge of the rolled sec-
tion, place your cleaned-off brush at the ceiling
line with a 1- to 2-inch overlap onto the wet
edge of glaze. Drag the brush down the wall in
one motion.

Dragging is a paint technique that involves applying a base coat and a
glaze and then dragging over the glaze to subtract some of it and par-
tially reveal the base coat. Dragging on wavy lines is the same as basic
dragging (see the previous project in this chapter), but it creates a
more whimsical look that may be appropriate for nurseries or children’s
rooms.
1.
Prepare your room according to the instructions in Chapter 2.
Apply a base coat of satin finish latex paint (see Chapter 4 for base
coat how-to information). Let it dry at least 4 hours to overnight.
Leave on any blue painter’s tape, and tape any additional areas
such as the ceiling, tops of door casings, or bottoms of window cas-
ings as needed.
2.
Lay the rubber blade of the shower squeegee
against a ruler and use a pencil to mark off the
placement of notches as desired for your
design. You may want small notches for very
fine lines, or you may want to mark wide,
widely spaced notches for bolder lines.

124
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
3.
With the squeegee blade flat on a cutting
surface, use a utility knife to cut notches out
of the blade where you marked it in Step 2.
4.
Put on latex gloves. In the bucket, combine
latex satin finish paint for glaze with the
glaze (follow manufacturer’s directions). Stir
well with a stir stick, and pour the glaze mix-
ture into a roller tray.
5.
Starting in the most inconspicuous corner and
up near the ceiling, cut in using your mini-
roller; roll glaze along the ceiling line, down
the corner, and across the top of the base-
board (cut in about 11⁄4 to 2 feet). Work in a 3-
to 5-foot wide section. Note: It may be neces-
sary to use a small chip brush to work glaze
into tight corners.
6.
Working quickly and with a zigzag motion,
roll on the glaze using your mini-roller in the
area you cut in. There’s no need to be pre-
cise with the rolling; the important part is to
keep the glaze wet so that you can create the
best effect.

125
Chapter 6: Faux Finishes Using Glaze
7.
Drag the squeegee over the glaze in
the desired pattern, wiping it on a
clean rag after each pass on the wall.
For example, you may want wavy ver-
tical lines, in which case you start at
the ceiling and drag the squeegee
down. Or you may want to drag the
squeegee across the glaze in a scal-
loped or swirled pattern.
8.
Repeat the application of glaze (cutting in
and rolling on) and dragging off with the
squeegee in 3- to 5-foot wide sections of wall.

Faux Leather Wall Finish
This classic finish creates a warm and interesting backdrop for any
room, traditional or contemporary. For a traditional leather look, use 
a rich camel beige for your wall paint and a dark brown for the glaze
layer. For a nontraditional look, try red and black, as shown here. You
can actually use any color combination — just choose a lighter tone for
the base color and a darker tone for the glaze. Make sure that the tones
you choose coordinate with the fabrics and other furnishings in the
room. Note that the glaze takes a long time to set up, but when it does,
it’s very durable. Still, you need to allow 24 hours for dry time at the
end of this project.

When you’re ready for the glaze layer,
unwrap one of the plastic drops and set it
aside. Put on the latex gloves and pour
about 2 cups of glaze into the roller tray.
1.
Prep the room according to the instructions in Chapter 2. Cut in and roll on
the eggshell finish base color (see Chapter 4 if you have any questions about
painting a base coat). A second coat may be necessary if the walls have light
spots or an uneven color tone. Let it dry completely, overnight if possible.

127
Chapter 6: Faux Finishes Using Glaze
3.
Doing only one wall at a time, paint on the
glaze just like you did the paint. Cut in the
edges with the 2-inch angled sash brush, 
and then use the roller for the rest. Make
sure that you blend out any roller marks.
4.
Pick up the 9-foot end of one of the plastic
drops. Keep the bulk of the drop behind
your body. Starting at an upper corner, press
the plastic onto the wet wall with your hand.
Don’t pull it tight and flat; let it be a bit
bunched up and wrinkled.
5.
Continue along the ceiling until the top 1 to 2
feet of the plastic is loosely stuck to the wall.
Be sure to keep the bulk of the drop away
from the wall.

128
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
8.
Using the clean roller, start at the top and roll
out all the puffed out spaces in the plastic to
press the plastic completely to the wall.
9.
If any plastic is flopping around in the corners,
cut it off or just tape the excess onto the plastic-
covered wall to keep it out of your way.
6.
Loosely press the plastic onto the wall here and there all the way
down to the floor. After the plastic touches the wall, don’t pull it
back off.
7.
If your wall is wider than the plastic sheet,
continue with another sheet of plastic cut to
fit. If you have spaces that you didn’t cover,
don’t try to re-position the plastic. Cut
pieces of plastic that can be patched over
those spots.

129
Chapter 6: Faux Finishes Using Glaze
10. Allow 2 to 4 hours for the plastic to slowly bond to the
glaze. In the meantime, repeat the process on the next
wall. Each wall should cure for the same amount of time.
12. After you remove all the plastic, check for
any missed spots. Fill in the spots with glaze.
If you have a small spot, just dab on some
glaze to take care of it. If you have a large
spot, patch it with plastic and allow it to
cure.
13. If you’re using an oil glaze, wipe off any bleeds or drips before they dry by
using some mineral spirits on a rag. If you’re using a latex glaze, use a damp
rag with a little bit of Krud Kutter on the rag.
When you’re selecting glaze for this project, consider oil glaze, which allows for a longer window of work time,
or latex glaze, which is more user-friendly when it comes to cleanup and odor.We tell you to use tinted glaze for
convenience, but you can also tint the glaze yourself by mixing paint with glaze to get your desired color.
11. When the plastic peels off with some resist-
ance, it’s ready to come off. Pull off the plas-
tic and, as you pull, roll the plastic into a ball
so that the glaze is inside. This technique
contains the sticky side and the mess.

Ragging On
Rag rolling creates a textured look from only two colors. The two methods
of ragging are positive (or ragging on), which we talk about here, and nega-
tive (or ragging off), which we discuss in the next project. For positive rag-
ging, or ragging on, you apply glaze with a specialty roller or a rag to create
your desired look. Basically, you soak a rag in glaze, wring it out, and then
roll it over a base coat. Some people like to simply roll up the rag. Others
like to wrap the rag around a roller and secure it with a string. Still others
prefer to use a specially designed rag roller.
Try out your method, technique, and color combination on a test piece of
poster board before committing to the real deal. If you’re working alone,
you have to work fast in order to achieve good results. As always, it’s easier
and faster to have your partner perform one function, such as rolling on
the glaze, while you do another, such as ragging on.
To maximize your weekend project, do two opposing walls one day and the
opposite walls the next day.

6.
While the glaze is still wet, stand back and
examine the wall after completing one sec-
tion. Does it seem too skimpy? Simply apply
the rag where you need more color. Too
much? Use a damp, clean rag to blot off the
excess. Trying to fix a wall after the glaze
dries can cause problems.
Ragging on can be very messy, so you should do the protective prep work covered in Chapter 2 as well as keep
lots of rags on hand for cleanup.
5.
Start in the least conspicuous area of the
room, at the bottom of the wall, and roll
upward. Roll the rag from your fingertips to
the palm of your hand to the heel of your
hand. Flip, rotate, and reshape the rag fre-
quently to keep from creating a static pat-
tern. Do a 3-by-3-foot area at a time.

Negative ragging, or ragging off, includes painting a base coat on, letting it
dry overnight, applying glaze with a roller, and removing the glaze with a
rag, plastic baggy, cheesecloth, terry cloth towel, or some other similar
material in order to create the desired look. Many people find that achiev-
ing their desired look is easier with ragging off than with ragging on (see
the previous project). For best results, have a partner roll on the glaze
while you pounce it off with a rag. If you don’t have a partner to work with,
make sure you roll just a small section so that the glaze doesn’t dry before
you have a chance to pounce it off.
1.
Prep the room according to the instructions in Chapter 2. Cut in
and roll on a base coat (see Chapter 4) and let it dry overnight.
2.
Put on gloves, and combine the other paint and the
glaze in a bucket and stir with a stir stick. (Always
follow the manufacturer’s instructions for their prod-
ucts for best results.) Pour some glaze into a roller
tray.

6.
Use a new, dry rag to pounce the current wet
area, moving back to the previously completed
area. Continue working toward the upper and
lower unfinished corner of the wall until you’ve
gone around the room.
134
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
3.
Use a mini-roller to roll glaze on the wall
from the corner and ceiling to the base,
working in sections about 3 feet wide. Work
from the ceiling to the floor. Leave the edges
random and jagged — you don’t want a
clean line.
4.
Take your rag (plastic baggy, cheesecloth,
terry cloth towel, or whatever material will
give you your desired effect) and crumple it
into a ball. Pounce the crumpled rag on top
of the rolled-on glaze to remove some of the
glaze. Turn the rag often to achieve a mod-
eled look.
5.
Repeat rolling the glaze on an adjacent 3-foot sec-
tion of the wall. When you move to the next sec-
tion, make sure to roll from the dry area ahead of
you back toward the wet area you just completed,
stopping about an inch short of the wet area.
7.
Assess your work as you apply and rag off the glaze. Trying to manipulate the look
after it dries can cause problems. If the area doesn’t have enough glaze, let it become
almost dry before you add more glaze and pounce it off again.

Sponging on creates surface interest. In this positive or additive tech-
nique, the base coat color dominates. Establishing a rhythm and work-
ing quickly is critical to creating a pleasing surface. Be sure to step back
and examine each section from a distance. Correcting the effect when
paint is wet is much easier than trying to make corrections after it
dries.
For this and other sponge projects, work quickly and use even pressure.
Keep the sponge moist with consistent amounts of paint, and use small
sponges at the corners.
2.
In a bucket, combine the other paint with glaze accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mix it thoroughly
with a stir stick.
1.
Prep the room according to the instructions in Chapter 2, and
then cut in and roll on your base coat color (see Chapter 4 for
instructions on applying a solid coat of paint). Let dry 4 to 6
hours or overnight.

136
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
3.
Put on your latex gloves, wet the sea sponge,
and wring out the excess water with a gentle
twisting motion.
4.
Dip the sponge into the glaze combination and
then blot it on a paper towel. You’re going to
pounce the sponge onto the wall, and you want
to avoid having a heavy beginning pounce and a
light ending pounce. The key is to keep a consis-
tent amount of glaze on the sponge at all times
so that the overall look of the wall is consistent.
5.
Starting at the top of the wall and working
toward the bottom, lightly touch the wall
with the sponge and then twist your hand 
as you pull the sponge away from the wall.
Don’t hit the wall — if you do, the paint from
the sponge will create a blob on the spot you
hit.

137
Chapter 6: Faux Finishes Using Glaze
7.
Move on to the next 3-foot section of the
wall, and then continue around the room.
Make sure you slightly overlap your sections
so that you don’t end up with a blank area
between sections.
Create greater dimensionality by applying a second glaze color.Wait about 20 minutes after completing your
first glaze color to sponge on the second color — just use the same steps. Overlap the colors randomly. For even
more drama, sponge on a third glaze color, repeating the steps and overlapping the sponging.
6.
Complete one 3-foot section of the wall by turn-
ing the sponge frequently and spacing the
pounces well apart with the sponge twisted at
different angles — you want to create an
abstract pattern on the wall.

138
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
Sponging Off
In this subtractive technique, the glaze color dominates over the base
color. Drama comes from combining warm and cool colors or light and
dark colors. Subtlety comes from using closely related colors (orange
and yellow, or green and blue) and from compatible neutrals (white and
beige). As with any glaze, you must work quickly while the glaze is still
wet. To ensure wetness, work in small sections and work closely with
your partner, if you have one.

7.
Roll the next section of glaze by working
from the dry area and overlapping the wet
edge ever so slightly. Repeat the pouncing
off motion from the previous step. Step back
and analyze your work as you go. Use clean,
damp sponges to rework over sections to
create pleasing effects that are random in
pattern but consistent with respect to the
amount of glaze being subtracted. Continue
around the room.
Combine sponging off and sponging on techniques.After you sponge off your glaze, you can sponge on some
sheer glaze in a metallic or light shade to create gleaming highlights.
6.
Hold your sponge in your dominant hand,
press the sponge on the wall, and quickly
pull it off the surface in a pouncing motion to
sponge off the glaze. Repeat the pouncing
motion, changing your wrist position and
angle of your arm to remove the glaze in a
random pattern. Turn the sponge over after
every five pounces. Rinse and wring out
your sponge every couple of minutes.

Give your walls the casual, cozy feel of your favorite summer pants with
a simple technique that makes walls mimic lightweight chambray fabric.
The soft pattern provides depth but doesn’t demand all the attention in
the room and works well as an allover pattern for an entire room.
1.
Prepare the room according to the instruc-
tions in Chapter 2. Cut in and roll on your
lighter base coat (see Chapter 4 for details).
Apply a second coat if you need one. Let the
paint dry completely, preferably overnight.
2.
Choose the wall(s) you want to glaze, and
then measure sections 3 feet wide across
those wall(s). Use the level and yardstick to
create straight vertical lines.

6.
Keep the gloves on, pour some of the glaze
mixture into a roller tray, and use a roller to
apply glaze to one 3-foot section of wall.
142

3.
Mark off vertical lines for each section 
by running the colored pencil along the 
yardstick.
4.
Tape off every other section by pressing 
the painter’s tape firmly along the lines 
you drew in Step 3.
5.
Put on latex gloves, and mix together the acrylic glaze
and the darker color paint in a bucket according to
package instructions. Stir with a stir stick. Make sure
you mix a batch that’s more than big enough to com-
plete your project. Matching the exact consistency is
extremely hard.

7.
Move the 12-inch wallpaper brush lightly
across the glazed section in horizontal
strokes, working from top to bottom. Work
swiftly so that the glaze stays wet, and wipe
off the brush tips regularly on a damp rag.
8.
After you reach the bottom of the glazed sec-
tion, wipe the brush again and work top to
bottom, making light vertical strokes with
the brush.
9.
Immediately remove the tape from the fin-
ished section.
10. Repeat Steps 6 through 9 on the rest of the taped sections. When you complete
this step, every other section of your wall will have the chambray effect.
11. Seal your remaining paint-glaze mixture in an airtight container. Allow the
glazed wall to dry overnight.
12. Tape the unfinished sections and repeat Steps 6 through 9 until each section
has been glazed and brushed.

Bagging
Ordinary plastic grocery bags step up to the challenge of creating inter-
esting wall effects. The crumpled bags add depth with sharp “veins”
etched into the paint. Bagging is a great project for beginners and for
budget-minded decorators because the primary tool is one you proba-
bly already have on hand.

keep the glaze wet so that you can create the
best effect.
5.
Turn a bag inside out (so that none of the ink
on the outside transfers onto your walls),
and loosely crumple it up.

146
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
7.
Continue pressing the bag into the glaze,
turning it regularly to keep the pattern
random and overlapping into previously
bagged spots. Grab a new bag when the old
one becomes too coated with glaze to leave
an impression.
8.
Repeat Steps 3 through 7 until the entire room has been bagged.
Use thicker bags if you want deeper veins in the paint; heavier plastic or even paper grocery bags help you
achieve that effect. Use plastic wrap instead of bags if you want delicate veins.
6.
Dab the crumpled bag lightly onto the glazed
surface. Simply press it into the wet glaze
and then pull it back without smearing the
glaze.

Use glaze that’s just a shade off your base color for a subtle crackled
effect, or get bold with two colors that are several shades apart. The
delicate veins that frottage creates can complement either approach.
2.
Tear the brown paper into roughly 3-by-3-
foot squares (or open the grocery bags so
that they’re flat and only one sheet thick).
1.
Prep the room according to instructions in Chapter 2, and paint on
the darker color of paint as the base (see Chapter 4 for more on
painting a base coat). Let the base coat dry at least 4 hours to
overnight. Apply a second coat if necessary for good coverage,
and let dry. Leave up any tape or masking.

3.
Crumple each piece of brown paper, and
then flatten it out but don’t smooth out 
the wrinkles.
4.
Wearing latex gloves, combine the lighter
top color and glaze in a bucket according to
the manufacturer’s instructions, and stir
before pouring some of the mixture into a
roller tray.
5.
Working in approximately 3-foot sections,
paint on the glaze using a roller. Note: Glaze
a slightly bigger section than you can cover
with a sheet of paper so that you can over-
lap the edges without reglazing.
6.
Working quickly so that the glaze doesn’t
have a chance to dry, press a crumpled
sheet of brown paper onto the glazed area of
wall. The sheet generally should be square
with the wall, not askew. Gently smooth the
sheet into the wall with your palm.

149
Chapter 6: Faux Finishes Using Glaze
7.
Gently pull the sheet of paper straight away
from the wall. It should take some of the
glaze with it, leaving a veiny effect.
8.
Repeat Steps 5 through 7 until you’ve worked across the entire wall or
room, overlapping the paper with the previous frottaged section as
you go.
One person can handle this project by working in sections, but you can work a lot faster with another pair of
hands on the job.When you work with a partner, one person rolls on the glaze and the other follows with the
paper.

T
ry the fun, decorative techniques in this chapter when you
want those unique elements that make your home the envy of
the neighborhood. Catch the eye of any guest by transforming
often-ignored, low-traffic areas into the height of elegance and
sophistication. For concrete ideas on where and when to use the
five techniques we show you in this chapter, check out the follow-
ing list:
 For elegance, nothing compares to a suede finish. It works
beautifully in a guest room, large foyer, library, office, or den.
The slightly rough surface makes washing off finger marks
difficult, so try it in adults-only areas.

You can use Venetian plaster to create several looks and textures. This 
centuries-old technique can give walls a classic, polished look; or you can
achieve a contemporary appearance by adding metallic tones to the plaster
compound. Use it when you want to hide surface imperfections on wood,
drywall, stone, brick, and other surfaces. 

Painted tissue wallpaper gives your space or surface three-dimensions and
an entirely new look. You end up with a crinkled look that effectively covers
up any imperfections. This finish is ideal for low-traffic areas.

A gradient finish in a small room or below a chair rail can make you feel as
though you’re living with a sunset. If you want to try the technique in a large
room, put the gradient finish on just one wall to add visual interest.

Stippling is best in small areas because it takes a long time to achieve the
effect. Consider using it on an accent wall, in a breakfast nook, or on some-
thing as small as a door or window frame.
If you’re interested in trying a faux finish technique, but you’re not ready to commit
to an entire wall, try the technique on a picture frame or table first. Or try a large
piece of poster board for practice. When you get the feel for the process and confirm
that you like the results, you’ll be more confident applying the technique to your fur-
niture or walls. After you do one faux finish project, you’ll be much more confident
about trying any of the others.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Created with specialty rollers and paints, this faux technique mimics
the soft, supple look of suede. Its slightly rough surface doesn’t stand
up to wear and tear or washing, so use this technique only in low-
traffic spaces such as a home office or guest room.
You can use the same color paint for the base coat and finish coat (as
this project does), or you can opt for multiple base and finish colors for
more drama. A third option is using lighter and darker values of the
same color to add dimension.
2.
Stir the suede paint thoroughly and pour it
into the roller tray.
1.
Prepare the room and walls according to instructions in Chapter 2.

153
Chapter 7: More Fun Decorative Techniques
3.
Use the 3-inch suede brush to cut in around
windows, doors, switches and outlets, and
the perimeter of the room. Cut in approxi-
mately the width of the brush.
4.
Roll paint on all walls vertically (not in an
“M” pattern) with a special suede roller. The
coat will look uneven, but you shouldn’t
touch it up. Overworking the drying paint
will ruin the finish and be very noticeable.
Allow this first coat of paint to dry com-
pletely, at least 4 hours.
5.
Use a 3-inch suede brush to crosshatch on
the second coat of paint. Use overlapping,
random length strokes, and reposition your
wrist and arm frequently to vary your stroke
and angles. Work fast, starting at the top of
the wall and sweeping your strokes down
the wall. Also work from dry to wet areas,
but don’t overlap wet paint onto drying
paint.

Use Venetian plaster to create a
random texture that has an air of
classical architecture about it.
The effect dresses plain old ply-
wood or plaster walls in a cloak
of natural stone — or so it would
appear. You make it happen by
smearing Venetian plaster willy-
nilly over the surface. Doing so
hides small blemishes in the
walls.
You can buy Venetian plaster in
pre-tinted gallon buckets or in
versions that require you (or a
staffer at the store where you buy
it) to add tint. You get a lot more
room to play around with color if
you choose the latter.

helps prevent scratches and gouges in the
plaster.
1.
Prep the room according to the instructions in Chapter 2.

155
Chapter 7: More Fun Decorative Techniques
7.
Wearing gloves, apply a second thin coat of 
plaster by using the steel trowel and the same
crisscross technique. Make sure you cover the
entire wall, leaving no gaps or low spots.
3.
Put on latex gloves, and use the steel trowel
to apply plaster in a thin coat. Start in a
corner, and use long and short strokes that
crisscross over each other at varying angles.
Don’t worry about covering the entire wall;
leaving small bare spots as you apply the
first coat is preferable.
4.
Wipe the trowel clean with a damp rag after
every other application of plaster.
5.
Continue applying plaster until you move across the entire wall.
Remember: You’re not covering every bit of wall at this point. Small bits of
wall show through the first coat of plaster.
6.
Let the plaster dry completely. Four to five hours should do the trick, but
consult the plaster instructions.

156
Part II: Painting Walls Like a Pro 
8.
Apply a third coat in the same fashion if you want to. Doing so makes
the plaster stronger and the texture deeper, but you can stop with two
coats and get a great-looking wall.
9.
Let the final coat dry overnight.
11. Wipe down the wall with a damp rag to
remove grit.
Because Venetian plaster can be used to create a wide range of textures, make sure you play around with it a bit
before getting started on the wall you plan to texture. Different thicknesses, strategies for applying the plaster,
and number of coats you use give very different results. Changing stream halfway through the project yields a
mishmash of a wall.Venetian plaster looks best when you achieve an even texture throughout the area you
cover.
10. Use 600-grit sandpaper to polish the plaster by
rubbing it in large circles. Start in an upper corner
and work across the entire wall.

Painted Tissue Wallpaper
2.
Crumple each sheet of tissue paper, and then
spread out and stack the sheets without
smoothing out all the wrinkles.
Plain old tissue paper is a gift to walls, giving them a hypnotic crinkle
effect. The look is easy to create and great for covering imperfections in
walls. Stop with just a layer of paint or, if you want to bring more atten-
tion to the texture of the walls, finish with a glaze two shades darker
than your paint. (Turn to Chapter 6 for more about glazing.)
This project is a great choice if you don’t want to take the time to apply
a base coat of paint. The painted tissue paper covers the surface com-
pletely, so it doesn’t matter what color the wall is underneath!

damage the paper. Then roll on paint. (Refer to
Chapter 4 for basic painting instructions.)
Buy at least 25 percent more tissue paper than you need to cover the square footage you plan to paint.You

Painting a Gradient
Mimic the effect of the sun by giving walls a gradient. With this tech-
nique, you start with dark paint low on the wall and lighten the paint 
as you progress up the wall. The result is an intriguing look that has a
warm, worn-in feeling — like an old pair of blue jeans.
Because you work this effect in sections and use multiple coats of 
three different colors, it’s a good one for smaller walls or in the space
between a chair rail and the floor.

3.
With a 4-inch flat brush, paint on the darkest
color of glaze from the bottom of the wall to
the halfway point. Don’t end with a straight
line across the wall. Instead, brush past the
halfway point in some spots and not quite
up to it in others. An uneven line works
much better for this effect than a precise
one.
4.
Using a clean 4-inch flat brush, begin apply-
ing the medium shade of glaze so that it
blends into the dark shade on the bottom
and extends up past it about a foot. Again,
work so that you create a jagged line. In
some spots you may pull the paint up only 6
inches and in others it may extend 18 inches
above the darker color.
5.
Using a clean 4-inch flat brush, apply the
light shade of glaze, starting at the top of the
wall or area and working down into the
medium shade. Blend the colors a bit by
painting into the medium paint with the light
color. Work so that you create a jagged edge
between the two colors.
6.
Let the paint dry for 4 to 6 hours.

To achieve a stippled effect, you apply small points, dots, or dabs of
paint to your surface. Given that a stippling brush covers just a few
square inches and your walls are many, many square feet, stippling 
is a project for the patient painter.
2.
Put on gloves, and use stir sticks to stir all
three shades of paint. Pour some of each
into three small containers.
1.
Prepare the room and walls according to the instructions in
Chapter 2, and apply a base coat of the lightest shade of paint
(see Chapter 4 for base coat instructions). Let it dry at least 4
hours to overnight.

163
Chapter 7: More Fun Decorative Techniques
3.
Begin stippling with the medium-colored
paint. Use the colorwashing brush to stip-
ple corners, and use the stipple brush to
stipple the flat areas of the wall. With either
brush, the technique is the same: Dip the
tip of the brush into the medium tone
paint, and then apply it to the wall by pop-
ping your wrist so that the bristles hit the
wall straight on and then bounce back,
depositing tiny dots of paint. Change the
angle of the brush as you move across a
section in long, wavy lines. (The size of the
section is determined when you run out of
paint.)
4.
When the brush runs out of paint, clean the
bristles on a clean, dry rag.
5.
Repeat Step 3 with the light shade of
paint, stippling so that the light tone over-
laps in places with the medium one. (The
colors mix at the point of overlap, creat-
ing a lot of depth on the wall.)

When the brush runs out of paint, clean it on
a rag, and repeat Step 3 with the dark shade

For stippling with a subtle effect, use just two very close shades of the same color paint: one as a base color and
the other stippled over it.

Covering Other Areas 
of Your Home

In this part . . .
I
t takes more than just four walls to create a room. But
you probably think of those walls first when you decide
to add a fresh coat of paint to spruce up your living space.
In this part, we urge you not to neglect the other areas of
your home. Unfortunately, ceilings with peeling paint and
well-worn floors can detract from your beautifully painted
walls. Fortunately, painting ceilings and floors is just
another project for the courageous do-it-yourselfer.
Same goes for your trim (including baseboards and mold-
ing) and your windows and doors. A fresh coat of paint
can do wonders, and we tell you what you need to know to
tackle these all-too-often neglected areas.

W
hen you want to paint your walls, take a good look at the
ceiling too. Can you really get away with not painting it?
No, not if it looks gray and dingy, or if it’s water stained or yel-
lowed by age or nicotine. Painting overhead is literally a pain in
the neck, even when you use a roller with an extension handle.
Opting for the alternative, however, detracts from the elegance of
your freshly painted walls; the new wall paint can actually make
the ceiling look worse than it is. So consider adding ceiling paint to
your shopping list.
Sometimes when you plan to paint the walls, however, the ceiling’s
in good shape. Paint it anyway if you want to give a dead white ceiling a little color, if
the color that’s on the ceiling makes the room appear smaller than it is, or if you’re
tempted to duck every time you go into the room (that happens when the ceiling
height is 8 feet or less and the color is darker than the color of the walls).
Homeowners paint concrete floors to give them a finished look at a relatively low
cost and to reduce the amount of dust that comes off unfinished concrete. You can
paint wood floors too. In fact, you can paint just about any type of flooring that’s
beginning to look tired or worn for far less money than it costs to purchase another
floor covering. You can be creative with paint by stenciling or painting traditional or
whimsical borders on the floor, or by using several colors to paint designs or even a
game board. When you tire of the floor, just roll on another coat of primer and paint
it all over again. In the meantime, read up on painting floors in the following pages.
Prepping Ceilings and Floors
Ceilings and floors are no different than walls: Before you paint, you have to prep.
This section helps you determine what kind of prep work you need to do. Most of
the techniques will probably seem familiar. If the introduction to this chapter con-
vinced you to paint your ceiling, read through this checklist and decide what needs
to be done:

If you have a plaster ceiling, repair cracks before you start priming and
painting.

If you see grease on the ceiling, wash the surface thoroughly.

Part III: Covering Other Areas of Your Home 

If a drywall ceiling has been soaked by water, cut out the affected area and
replace it with new drywall.

If the ceiling has water or nicotine discoloration or stains, prime it before
painting.

If the existing ceiling paint has a lot of sheen and you want to cover it with
latex paint, prime it first. Primer leaves a rough surface the paint can stick to.

If the existing ceiling looks good, but you want to change the color or add
another coat of paint, prime it first. When paint adheres to the surface, it
goes on smoother and looks more even. So using a primer makes good sense
even if the ceiling doesn’t have any of the obvious problems in this list.
Painting the floor gives you an opportunity to show off your flair and creativity with-
out spending a lot of money. But you want your canvas to be in the best possible
shape before you get started; otherwise, your new design will look less than stellar.
Wood and concrete are the most commonly painted floors, and each surface
requires a little different prep work.
To prep wood floors, follow these instructions:
1. Clean. Clean the floor thoroughly. Get rid of grease, grime, wax, and any-
thing else that has built up on the surface.
2. Fill. If the wood is splintered or gouged, fill in those areas with a tinted
wood filler.
3. Sand. If the wood is rough, sand it smooth with 120-grit sandpaper. 
If previously finished wood is glossy, sand it with 120-grit sandpaper.
4. Scrape. Scrape off cracked or loose paint on previously finished wood
floors, and then feather the finished and scraped areas to make a smooth
surface.
5. Prime. Use a latex or alkyd primer under latex paint. Use an oil-based
primer under oil-based or polyurethane paint. Unfinished wood floors 
soak up a lot of paint, so priming is important.
6. Select your paint. If you want a satin finish on the wood, use a quality 
latex paint. If you want a semi-gloss or gloss finish, use latex, alkyd, or
polyurethane paint.
To prep concrete floors, follow these instructions:
1. Patch. If the concrete floor has any surface cracks or imperfections, use a
concrete filler, and then sand the patches smooth.
2. Clean. Scrub the floor thoroughly with TSP to remove grease, dirt, and 
anything else (such as carpet tape) that has built up on the surface.
3. Wash and dry. Rinse the floor several times and let it dry thoroughly. 
A concrete floor can take up to three days to dry.
4. Sand. Sand off imperfections using 80-grit sandpaper.
5. Sweep it up. Vacuum the floor thoroughly.
6. Prime. You want to prime any floor that has an uneven texture or is porous.
Bare concrete is extremely porous, so priming is extremely important.

169
Chapter 8: Coating Ceilings and Floors
Do-it-yourself do’s for cleaning ceilings
As you prepare a ceiling for painting, be
sure to follow these tips:
 Do use a non-skid, moisture-proof drop-
cloth to cover the floor, and make sure
that you securely tape it in place. If it’s
non-skid, you can concentrate on hand-
work, not footwork, and a moisture-
proof barrier prevents liquids from
seeping through to the floor.
 Do wear goggles and protective cloth-
ing, including a head covering, to protect
your skin from strong detergents and
paint products. Tape the cuffs of a long-
sleeved shirt so that nothing runs under
the sleeves.
 Do use a short-handled squeegee to
remove excess water so that the surface
dries quickly.
 Don’t overload your sponge, if you’re
using one. Drips increase cleanup time
and cause paint to spread unevenly.
 Do divide the ceiling into strips or areas
and progress from one to the next in an
orderly fashion in order to thoroughly
cover the ceiling. (Note: You don’t have
to tape off the areas — just eyeball
them.)
 Do use a sturdy stepladder, preferably
one with wide treads to keep you from
slipping off the rungs.
Popcorn ceiling considerations
Popcorn ceilings are textured, acoustic ceil-
ings that are sprayed on and resemble pop-
corn or cottage cheese when they dry. Home
builders typically put in popcorn ceilings
because it’s an inexpensive and fast way to
finish a room. The additive that gives the
paint its texture is fragile; it melts when it
gets wet, and it can wipe off onto the roller.
Even sweeping a popcorn ceiling can loosen
the additive. So if you paint a popcorn ceil-
ing, be sure to use the fewest paint strokes
possible and paint in only one direction to
minimize the amount of stuff raining down
on your head. Alternately, you can spray on
the paint.
If you’re thinking about removing the pop-
corn, keep these things in mind:
 If an acoustic spray was used in a home
built before 1980, the popcorn ceilings
contain asbestos. Before you begin,
check to see whether the ceiling contains
asbestos. If it does, cover it with a new
coat of acoustic spray instead of remov-
ing it, which potentially can make the
asbestos airborne.
Warning: Removing asbestos, a haz-
ardous material when tiny particles
become airborne and are inhaled, is a
costly procedure that local governments
generally tightly control. Licensed tech-
nicians wearing “space suits and masks”
have to remove the asbestos from public
buildings and can take it only to approved
disposal sites. Generally you can encap-
sulate or surround the asbestos without
disturbing it and without it becoming a
health hazard. But to be safe, wear your
breathing mask, goggles, a long-sleeved
shirt, and long pants, and cover your
hair.
 Painting over popcorn makes the water-
soluble stuff hard to remove later on. So,
if you’re going to remove the popcorn,
do it before you paint your room.
 Removing popcorn isn’t an easy job; you
have to scrape, sand, apply Skim Coat (a
smooth-finish base coat), and then apply
the finish paint. Sometimes removing
the popcorn isn’t practical because of the
time, effort, and cost.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
If you’re painting a whole room,
paint the ceiling before you paint
the walls or trim. To get the best
results on ceilings, prep by clean-
ing off dust with a broom and
fixing any problems like stains
and mildew (see Chapter 2 for
cleaning how-to’s) and cracked
plaster or popped nails on dry-
wall (turn to Chapter 3 for more
on these repairs).
As for paint, use ceiling paint,
which is formulated to spatter
less, diffuse light more evenly,
and have an even, flat sheen. If
desired, you can have the paint
technician tint the ceiling paint
to coordinate with your wall
paint (most painters use a 25 
percent tint).
Paint the town red and the ceiling pink
Getting even coverage on ceilings can be
tough because you’re working overhead
and it’s hard to see variations or skipped
spots on previously painted ceilings. A prod-
uct that eliminates this problem is pink ceil-
ing paint that dries white. The pink tint when
it’s wet makes it easier to spot missed spots
and imperfections when you’re rolling it on.
You can get more information from a paint
specialist at your local home improvement
or paint store. Note: It’s possible to tint reg-
ular ceiling paint, but this variety that rolls
on pink is only available in a white finished
color.

Painting Wood Floors
Laminate long gone? Poor quality wood flooring? Then painting is your 
best — and cheapest — option for making your wood floor look its best.
You can use interior paint (or enamel for a harder finish) or specially for-
mulated floor paint. Floor paints come both ready- and custom-mixed and
in gloss or satin finishes, too.
Keep in mind that latex paint, although easy to apply and widely available,
doesn’t stand up to heavy wear and tear. Alkyd paints perform better on
floors because they dry to a hard finish, cover well, and stand up to mod-
erate foot traffic. Epoxy paints and industrial enamels cover extremely well
and stand up to heavy foot traffic but are available in fewer colors.

If you can see any imperfections on the floor after cleaning it, use 180-grit sandpaper to remove them.The
smoother the floor, the nicer your project will look when it’s finished.
You can paint almost any floor surface — linoleum, vinyl, or tile. If you’re looking for a short-term solution,
painting is the way to go. Just be sure to prep the surface (by cleaning, sanding, and even deglossing) and prime
it as you would any hard-to-paint surface.

Painting Concrete Floors
Concrete requires extra prep for painting because of its coarse texture
and porosity. Masonry paints are designed for concrete, and some are
intended specifically for use on floors and stairs. You can also paint
concrete with alkyd, latex, epoxy, or special floor paints. Some concrete
floor paints contain a primer that can save you time by eliminating a
step; talk to a paint specialist about the paint and primer that work best
for you and your job.

Color tricks for altering proportions
Interior designers use color to make a
room’s proportions seem perfect. Warm
colors (like yellow, orange, and red) seem to
come toward you. Cool colors (like green,
blue, and violet) seem to move away. Use
this basic color psychology to alter your
room’s proportions:
 To create intimacy on high ceilings, use
deep, warm colors. Wood panels and
beams are two increasingly popular
solutions in large rooms.
 To create the impression of spacious-
ness and height, use light, cool colors,
such as a tinted atmospheric blue for low
ceilings.
 To make a squat, square room come
alive, use faux tenting (painting alternat-
ing triangles of color that gather in the
middle of the ceiling).
 To create instant coherence, tint your
ceiling by painting it with a 25 percent
tint of the wall color. Tinting the ceiling
eliminates that chopped up look created
by a big stark white expanse of ceiling.
 To tone down rooms with wallpapered
or decidedly colored walls, use very pale
blue, cream, peach, pink, or yellow for
ceilings.

W
alls aren’t the only surfaces that need painting.
Baseboards, decorative moldings, and simple trims 
need a fresh coat of color not only to protect them from wear 
but also to complete your design statement. No matter what 
your room’s style, you’ll need to address your room’s trim, mold-
ing, and baseboards.
Doors need painting for maintenance and decoration, too. A fresh
coat of paint keeps them from warping and helps them look their
best. Don’t neglect the potential doors hold for adding style to
rooms and hallways.
Windows often look worn sooner than doors and trim simply because
temperature extremes on one side of the glass or the other cause condensation. It
runs down the pane and collects on sills and mullions. If not wiped up, water eventu-
ally seeps under the paint and causes it to blister and peel; unprotected by paint,
wood also soaks up moisture when it’s raining, snowing, or just plain muggy out-
doors. And nothing, not even nicked, scuffed doors, will make a freshly painted room
look shabbier. You don’t want to neglect the windows.
If you’re adding new trim to your room, your best bet is to prep and paint it before you
apply it to the wall. The process is certainly easier and neater than painting it after it’s
already up — you don’t have to worry about dripping and you don’t have to be so
careful around the edges. For more information on putting up trim, pick up a copy of
Home Improvement For Dummies by Gene Hamilton and Katie Hamilton (Wiley).

Choosing the best finish for your trim, doors, and windows
Because trims, doors, and windows are
often subject to lots of wear and tear, you
may want a more durable and easy-to-clean
finish. Alkyd or oil-based paints offer more
protection against scuffing than latex or
water-based paints and can be cleaned
more easily. If you’re using water-based,
matte latex paint on walls, you may opt to
use a semi-gloss or gloss version of the
same color paint on trim. Semi-gloss fin-
ishes are far more durable than their matte
counterparts and can stand up to a cleaning
with mild detergent and a soft cloth to
remove fingerprints and scuff marks.

Trim is an umbrella term for any
kind of finish strip applied around
openings to conceal surface or
angle joints and raw edges where
drywall meets doorways, windows,
floors, and ceilings. Baseboards are
the finish strips between the floor
and the wall and range in width
from 3 to 18 inches. The term mold-
ing refers to larger and typically
more ornamental finish strips. In
this book, we use the term trim to
apply to baseboards, moldings,
and trim.
Getting any kind of trim to look
perfectly smooth is no small feat. It
requires a steady hand and good
skills at maneuvering in tight
spaces, often while kneeling (or
lying) on the floor or extending
your arm above your head.
Pick the right brush for the job.
The principle is simple: small space, small brush. Try a tapered trim or
sash brush. These brushes are small — from 11⁄2 to 2 inches wide. Some
have slant tips for sharp angles. Others have stubby handles for tight
spaces. You may want to select two brushes — a smaller one for the sides
of trim that project from the wall and a larger one for long runs of a wider,
flatter surface that don’t need to be as finely controlled.
It’s easier to paint trim after painting the walls because you can control
small tapered brushes a lot easier than you can control a roller. And if you
tape adjoining walls with painter’s tape, inadvertent brush marks stay on
the tape, not on the wall. Even so, you’ll find some painters who do just the
reverse and swear by the results.
Before you start painting your trim, follow the same steps you would to
prep your walls (see Chapters 2 and 3). Make sure you clean the trim thor-
oughly, fill all gaps and cracks, prep with a stain-blocker if necessary, and
prime and sand to a smooth finish. If you’re painting the entire room, the
best time to prep trim is when you’re prepping walls.

Chapter 9: Turning Your Brush to Trim, Windows, and Doors
1.
Use blue painter’s tape to tape the edges of
the wall where they meet the edges of the
trim. (If you just taped and primed the trim,
you can skip this step.)
2.
Stir the paint thoroughly with a stir stick,
and then dip a third of the bristles of your 
2-inch angled sash brush into the paint can.
Tap both sides of the bristles on the can to
shake off extra paint, and then wipe the bris-
tles against the side of the can to make sure
you get rid of excess paint. If you overload
the brush, you’ll lose control of the paint
application.
Always work from the top down when you’re painting trim, like professional painters do. If you don’t have 
ceiling molding, start at the top of a window or door frame.Always paint baseboards last. If you start at the
bottom, and then paint above, you risk bumping into wet paint or dislodging dust and debris that will stick to
the wet surface.

184
Part III: Covering Other Areas of Your Home 
4.
Unload the paint with a stroke in one
direction on the flattest, widest surface 
of the molding, trim, or baseboard. 
Press slightly — just enough to flex the
bristles — and work slowly to ensure an
even application of paint.
5.
After you paint the first strip of wood, start
subsequent strokes of the brush in a dry
area, working toward the wet area. (This
technique avoids creating lap marks.) Then
raise the brush slightly and feather the edge.
Feathering paint into a previously painted
patch keeps the paint even and smooth from
one stroke to another.
6.
Reverse the direction of the brush, and lightly stroke back over the coat
you just applied to set the paint.
3.
Position the paint guard at the bottom edge
of the ceiling molding, at the top of the base-
board, or on the wall adjacent to window
and door frames. Hold the guard in your
nondominant hand, using firm pressure to
hold it in place.

7.
Use a 11⁄2-inch angled sash brush to stroke the
edges or underside of the trim, baseboard, or
molding that juts out from the wall. In tight
spaces, switch to using a stubby handled brush.
185
Chapter 9: Turning Your Brush to Trim, Windows, and Doors
Jazzing up your room’s molding
Does molding have to be white? No rule
says that it has to be that way, but conven-
tionally, trim is typically white. White trim
can act as a thread to tie together different
colored rooms because it keeps the eye
moving through the space.
For the low ceilings in contemporary rooms,
painting the trim the same color as the walls
(or a shade or tint that’s close) is usually
best. This trick keeps the walls from being
visually chopped up. Don’t know how to
decide? If you want your eye to travel to the
trim or if your house needs a unifying thread,
consider using white molding. Otherwise,
match the color of your walls.
A paint guard prevents paint from winding up on surfaces. Still, keep clean rags on hand to clean up paint that
may accidentally get on just-painted walls or other surfaces. For oil-based paints, speed up the cleanup with
mineral spirits (paint thinner) — a little dab works wonders. For water-based paints, mix some mild detergent
and water and dab up spatters with a clean cloth.
8.
If you find that an area needs more paint, simply wait until the
area is dry, sand lightly, and touch it up.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
The window frame (the part that
encloses the glass and basic parts)
may be made of wood, aluminum, or
vinyl. Wood frames need painting for
maintenance because water often
condenses on the frame in winter
and seeps under the paint, which can
cause rot. In humid seasons, wood
soaks up moisture, which can cause
windows to warp, swell, or even
shrink if neglected. Aluminum and
vinyl are maintenance-free. That
means you don’t need to paint them
to keep them functioning (that’s
always a good thing), but you may
want to paint them to keep them
looking beautiful.
Fix any damage to the windows
before you get started. For tips,
check out Home Improvement For
Dummies, by Gene Hamilton and
Katie Hamilton (Wiley).
1.
Using appropriate screwdrivers, remove all
the hardware — locks, curtain hooks, han-
dles, and other metal devices — from the
windows before you paint. Your painting job
will go much faster and look much cleaner in
the end.

187

2.
Tape the glass all around the sash
using 2-inch blue painter’s tape.
3.
If the upper, outer sash is movable, lower it
to the bottom, leaving it open just an inch or
two. Raise the lower, inner sash to midlevel.
You’re almost reversing their positions.
4.
Rub an old candle or bar of soap over the
wood jambs so that the windows will slide
easily after you paint them. Make sure you
don’t paint the jambs themselves — that’s
what causes wood windows to stick. (If you
have aluminum or vinyl windows, you can
skip this step.)
If the upper sash won’t move, it’s probably been painted closed.Try hitting the wood on the sides where the
window meets the jamb. Use no more than moderate force. Sometimes putting the tip of a screwdriver into the
crack and then hitting the handle will break the paint seal. (Repeat placing the screwdriver in several different
places along the jamb.) Just be careful! You don’t want to hit and shatter the glass or go overboard hitting the
frame with too much force.You don’t want to add a trip to the emergency room to your paint project.

188
Part III: Covering Other Areas of Your Home 
6.
Paint the lower part of the upper sash
(remember that it’s now in the low posi-
tion). Paint the trim that’s adjacent to the
glass first, making certain that you paint
right down to the glass, and then paint the
wide horizontal board at the bottom.
7.
Paint the vertical sides of the upper, outer
sash. If your window has mullions (slender,
vertical bars that divide the windows), paint
them last.
5.
Dip no more than a third of the bristles of a narrow brush (11⁄2- to 2-inch) into the
paint can, tapping the brush, and then swiping each side against the can to
remove excess paint.
8.
Raise the upper sash almost to the top and let it dry according to
the paint manufacturer’s instructions.

189
Chapter 9: Turning Your Brush to Trim, Windows, and Doors
9.
Move the inner sash down so that it’s an inch or two
from the bottom. Use your 11⁄2- or 2-inch brush to paint
the top edge of the inner sash — paint the flat, top edge
first, and then the narrow trim, and finally the wide hori-
zontal board.
10. Paint vertical boards of the inner sash with your 11⁄2-inch brush, and then paint mullions
if you have them.
11. Let the inner sash dry according to the paint manufacturer’s instructions.
12. Using a paint guard to protect the
wall and a 11⁄2-inch tapered brush,
paint the outside edges of the
window frame.

190

13. Using a 21⁄2-inch brush, paint the window
frames, starting at the horizontal top portion
and working down. Work from the inside
toward the casing trim. Avoid painting any
moving parts. Don’t overload the brush with
paint — you don’t want it to seep into jambs.
14. Use a 21⁄2-inch tapered brush to paint the
window sill (also referred to as a stool —
where the window rests against the wall)
and apron (the trim on the wall below the
sill). Let them dry.
15. Peel off tape, and/or use a single-edge razor
blade to remove any paint drips on the glass
as soon as possible.

191
Chapter 9: Turning Your Brush to Trim, Windows, and Doors
Paint windows early in the morning to allow for adequate drying time before you close them at night.You don’t
want wet paint drying your windows stuck.
When you’re painting windows, you can create a moisture- and draft-proof seal between the glass and trim. Just
lay the tape on the glass, leaving a straight, narrow edge of glass showing.Then as you work on an edge, also
paint the glass.When you remove the tape, you end up with a weather-tight seal on the trim and glass.
16. Wait several hours for paint to dry before
replacing locks and other hardware.
Getting to know your windows
Windows aren’t all created alike. Some win-
dows crank open, others slide up and down,
still others swing out, and some don’t oper-
ate at all. Double-hung windows have an
upper and lower sash (the inner frame that
keeps the glass in place) that move up and
down in their own individual channels.
Casement windows have hinges on one
side and open outward. Awning windows
are hinged at the top and swing outward
with the help of a lever or crank. Hoppers,
the reverse of awnings, are hinged at the
bottom and swing inward. Jalousie win-
dows are composed of horizontal slats that
are all connected and crank open at the
same time.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Casement windows are a lot less
complicated to paint than double-
hung windows (see the previous
project). You simply need to open
them wide to reach all the areas. If
your crank mechanism is broken or
needs maintenance, fix it before
painting to ensure that you don’t
accidentally mar the fresh paint
later.
Semi-gloss and glossy paint are the
best choices for window frames
because they resist stains and are
long wearing and easy to scrub.
You can get them in water-based
latex, which makes cleaning up
afterward simple.
1.
Using appropriate screwdrivers, remove all
the hardware — locks, curtain hooks, han-
dles, and other metal devices — from the
windows before you paint. Your painting job
will go much faster and look much cleaner in
the end.

193
Chapter 9: Turning Your Brush to Trim, Windows, and Doors
2.
Decide whether you want to tape the
window. You’re going to paint the frame right
down to the window to make a seal between
the window and the frame. If you don’t think
you can paint a steady, thin line, tape the
window first, leaving a hairline crack of glass
visible between tape and frame. That will
give you a neater “seal” than trying to do it
freehand.
3.
Crank the window open. Then load your
11⁄2-inch tapered sash brush with paint by
dipping the first third of the brush into the
paint container. Tap the brush on the can,
and wipe the sides of the brush against the
can to remove excess paint.
4.
Paint the narrow trim that meets the glass.

194
Part III: Covering Other Areas of Your Home 
5.
Paint horizontal surfaces of the window first,
starting at the top and using a 21⁄2-inch angled

open window toward the outer edge.
6.
Paint vertical surfaces, working from the top
to the bottom.
7.
Paint the crossbars and frame casings with the
11⁄2-inch tapered sash brush, doing horizontal
surfaces first, top to bottom, and then vertical
surfaces. You can get more precise control with
the small brush if the crossbars and casings are
narrow. Watch out for drips, and use the dry,
clean, 21⁄2-inch brush to wick up excess paint.

Painting Paneled Doors
Paneled doors are increasingly popular because of their appealing surface
treatment. These traditional doors are a bit tricky to paint because they have
multiple surfaces. Unlike their plain counterparts, paneled doors require a bit
of patience and a more systematic approach to make them look their best.
For professional results, take down the door and remove all hardware. If
you prefer to leave the door in place, cover the handle and all hardware
with 2-inch blue painter’s tape to avoid spatters.
Although this project describes painting a paneled door, you can follow
Steps 1 through 9 plus 12 and 13 to paint a flat door. On paneled doors,
start painting in the center and work your way to the flat outer edges.
Before you begin, select a hot dog roller, or a 21⁄2- or 3-inch brush to paint
wide panels of the door.

7.
If the door has a hard, shiny finish or has
been varnished, degloss the surface by
wiping deglosser on with a clean rag until it

you just want to dull the surface so that you
can repaint it with latex or glossy paint. But
if you want to create a good bond for primer

Brush primer on the door, using a 21⁄2-inch
brush. Let it dry thoroughly. If you notice
tiny imperfections in the primer that will
show through on the finished layer, lightly
sand the primer after it dries using 180-grit
sandpaper.
10. Paint the flat surface of the raised or
recessed panels, using a foam “hot dog”
roller or a 21⁄2- or 3-inch brush. Don’t over-
load the brush or roller. Tap the brush on
the sides of the paint can or roll the foam
roller over the ridges in the paint tray to
spread paint uniformly. (See Chapter 4 for
more loading advice.)
9.
Stir your paint thoroughly with a stir stick.
Then start at the center of the door, using a
11⁄2-inch tapered brush, and paint the trim on
molded panels. Work from a corner and
move out to the center of the trim to prevent
excess paint from building up in corners.

13. Let the paint dry and cure according to the paint manufacturer’s
instructions before remounting hardware and hanging the door. If you
didn’t take down the door, try to keep it ajar for as long as possible after
you paint it. Although paint dries to the touch in 24 hours, it can take as
long as a week for it to cure. The longer you can wait, the less you risk
the surface becoming marred.
If you’re interested in painting each face of the door a different color, you may not be sure what color to paint
the edges of the door.The rule of thumb is to paint the edges to match the face that’s visible when you open the
door. If a door swings into a blue room from a yellow hall, paint the edges yellow — the same color as the hall
door face.
Check the bottom edge of the door to see whether it has been finished.A finished edge prevents the wood from
absorbing moisture and warping. If it hasn’t been sealed, sand it to remove imperfections, and then prime the
unfinished edge. (If you didn’t remove the door from its hinges, slip an unframed mirror under it to see whether
it’s finished. If not, use a pad painter to prime it.)
12. Paint the vertical panels of the door, again
following the grain, and working from the
top down to the bottom edge. To keep sur-
faces smooth, paint from dry areas stroking
toward wet paint.
11. Use your 21⁄2- or 3-inch brush or hot dog
roller to paint the flat edges of the door,
using long continuous strokes. Apply paint
to the horizontal outer and middle panels
first, following the grain of the wood.

T
he ten tips in this chapter help you get it right the first time. Keep reading if
you want to unlock the secrets to practically perfect paint.
Start with a Clean Surface
Giving dingy walls a fresh coat of paint spruces up your living space. But if you paint
over dust, grime, and other dirt, you won’t like the result. Wash your walls with a
mixture of trisodium phosphate (TSP) and water before you paint. 
Take the Time to Tape
We know that when you buy that bright new color, the only thing you want to do is
start painting. Taking the time to tape may seem like an irritating delay, but it’s
essential. Put blue painter’s tape around anything you want to protect from paint,
including baseboards, ceilings, window and door frames, and electrical switches.
Use Primer
If you cleaned, but your walls are stained, or if you’re painting your walls a lighter
color than they were before, primer is a must. It seals stains and gives you a clean,
even surface on which to paint. Imperfections can adhere to wet primer, and some-
times particles are found in the primer itself. That’s why professional painters sand a
primed surface after it dries. But if you don’t mind a few minor imperfections, you
can skip sanding and start painting after the primer dries.
Go Stir Crazy
Paint settles fast. Keep lots of stir sticks handy and stir frequently. Every time your
paint container needs to be refilled, stir the paint in the can. A good 30 to 60 seconds
of stirring keeps your paint color uniform.

204
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Use the Best Tools You Can Afford
You don’t have to spend a fortune to get quality painting tools, but you want to buy
the best you can afford. Painting is easier when you’re using quality brushes and
roller covers — and you don’t have to worry about bristles falling out and sticking to
the wall. Quality materials also help you achieve better results; sometimes a sloppy
paint job has nothing to do with the painter and everything to do with the tools. 
Don’t Pinch Pennies on Paint
You see an oh-so-beautiful swatch of pricey paint. You take the chip to the home
improvement store to have it analyzed so you can buy the “same” color in a cheaper
paint. Good idea to save money? Not exactly. You won’t get the same color or finish
in a cheaper product. Pricey paints have more pigments and greater complexity of
pigments to create the color. That’s why they cost more.
Invest in a Power Roller
If you have lots of painting to do, invest in a power roller, which promises fast paint-
ing, uniform coverage, no dripping, no paint trays, no stirring, no reloading, no spat-
tering, and easy cleanup. It’s also portable. Prices range from $40 to $200.
Use a Power Sprayer 
Power paint sprayers make covering large surfaces easy, especially on irregular or
complicated surfaces, such as louvered doors, panels, and trim. Some relatively inex-
pensive consumer models are available. Read the manufacturer’s directions about adjust-
ing your paint’s viscosity (thickness) so that it can be sprayed. Some do-it-yourselfers
find that high-volume, low-pressure (HVLP) sprayers work better than consumer
sprayers. HVLPs are more costly than some consumer sprayers, but many painters
swear that they end up with less overspray, better coverage, and a finer finish.
Be Detail-Oriented
In a newly painted room, details that make the most difference are the things that
most painters seem to miss while they’re painting — think air registers or air ducts,
radiators, closet doors . . . the things that tend to stick out like sore thumbs when
you’re finished. Make these eyesores fade into the background by painting them
using surface-friendly paint tinted to match or complement your wall color.
Give Your Paint Plenty of Time to Dry
You’ve done everything right up ’til now. Don’t waste your effort by putting 
furniture — or children or pets — back in the room too early. Be patient while 
your paint dries; you’ll have plenty of time to enjoy the results afterward!

Chapter 11
Ten Tips for Picking the Best Color
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to look at when selecting colors
 Thinking about light, ambiance, and dynamics
Y
ou don’t have to hire a decorator to turn your home into a haven. Find the colors
that achieve what you want by using these pro tips for choosing colors.
Spin the Color Wheel
Being familiar with the standard color wheel can help you pick the best paint and dec-
orations for your home. Go to www.artsparx.com/colorwheel.asp to see how pri-
mary colors, secondary colors, and tertiary colors work together.
Assess Intensity and Value
How pure, bright, or dull a color is refers to its intensity. Think of fire engine red and
bright mustard yellow as high intensity colors. Sky blue and beige are low intensity
colors. Every color, no matter its intensity, has a range of values from light to dark.
Paint chips show a color, such as blue, and five to seven hues ranging from lightest to
darkest in intensity and value. Use one to assess how the color will look on your wall.
The safest selection is usually one of the two colors in the middle of the strip.
Know Your Color Scheme
The three categories to keep in mind as you evaluate colors for your room are comple-
mentary, analogous, and neutrals. Complementary décor combines a primary and sec-
ondary color found opposite each other on the color wheel (example: red and green).
Analogous colors fall into two groups: warm (shades of red, orange, and yellow) and cool
(colors in the green, blue, and violet range). Neutrals are browns, beiges, taupes, whites,
and blacks not included on a color wheel; they’re considered non-colors.
Visualize the Undertones in Colors
Sometimes perceptions of a color change dramatically, depending on what’s next to it.
All colors, other than the three primaries, are mixed colors. So you can’t just assume,
for example, that a can of white paint will go with everything in your home; it may take

206
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
on pink undertones when you see it next to a red Oriental rug. Most people don’t see
undertones until it’s too late. Fortunately, you can rely on clerks at the paint store.
Take a focal piece (like a pillow sham, carpet sample, or photo if your item is too big)
to give the clerk what he needs to help you avoid problems with undertones.
Evaluate Natural and Artificial Light
Before selecting paint, consider lighting. Look at paint chips under direct, indirect, and
artificial light. Evaluate the samples against furniture and rugs. After you narrow your
choices, get a small jar of each finalist and brush each on a piece of white poster board.
After the paint dries, tape the poster board to the wall and evaluate again. Assessing
larger color samples ensures that you’re making the right choice for your room.
Create a Mood with Color
Color affects mood and the way you perceive the comfort level of a space. For a calm
effect, select cool colors. To energize your home, look to the warm color palette. Pair a
warm color with a cooler complement to create energy.
Change a Room’s Size with Color
Warm colors advance and cool colors recede. If you want to make a small room appear
larger, paint it a pale, cool, less intense color. If you have a large room that needs
downsizing, use warm colors or darker, more intense hues.
Consider Colors in Adjacent Rooms
You don’t have to use the same color scheme in adjoining rooms, but you have a more
peaceful ambiance if one room naturally flows into the next. Select complementary
color schemes, or vary the intensity of one hue, going from the lightest shade to the
most dramatic. Don’t create a hodge podge of loud, conflicting colors — if each room is
competing, you won’t be able to relax.
Coordinate with Furniture and Flooring
Using a favorite painting or rug to inspire a color scheme highlights that piece when
the room is done. The trick is to choose a paint color that blends with the piece
instead of matching it exactly. Paint stores have cards that show coordinated colors;
you see a decorated room, chips of dominant paint, and colors that go with them.
Play It Safe with Neutrals
Neutrals blend in, are flexible, and cooperate with other colors. White is especially
good at opening spaces. Warm neutrals work well in rooms with few or small windows.
Black is a great accent, but use it sparingly. Neutrals are considered “safe” wall treat-
ments. If you’re selling your home, neutrals are the way to go. Most potential buyers
can visualize their furnishings set before those freshly painted walls.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Unfortunately, it takes more than drywall mud and tape to patch large
holes in drywall. Anything larger than a fist-sized hole needs to be
patched with a new piece of drywall cut to fit the void. But the job isn’t
necessarily one that should send you to the phone book to find a
handyman or contractor. With a little skill, time, and the right tools and
materials, you can fix large holes in drywall yourself.
If the hole exposes a stud or beam, you can attach the new piece of dry-
wall directly to it with wallboard screws and then use drywall mud and
tape to seal the seams between new and existing drywall; to do this, skip
Steps 6 through 8. When wood framing isn’t exposed, you need to create
a backing for the new piece, which we also explain in this project.
Repairing Large Holes in Drywall
1.
Use a wallboard saw to square off
the shape of the hole. You don’t
need to be precise.

2
Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
3.
Use blue painter’ tape to cover the
hole with a single sheet of paper.
With a pencil, trace the outline of
the hole onto the paper.
4.
Place the pattern on the piece of
scrap drywall, and trace it in pencil.
2.
Use a utility knife to trim the rough
edges of the hole, removing all
loose drywall paper and pieces of
gypsum to get smooth edges.
Enlarging the hole slightly may be
necessary to get it clean.

3
Repairing Large Holes in Drywall
6.
Holding the precut anchor board in the
middle, insert it into the hole in the wall.
Each end should extend equally underneath
the surrounding wall.
7.
Using wallboard screws and a screw
gun, screw through the existing wall
and into one end of the anchor
board. Maintain pressure on the
center of the board to keep it tight
against the surrounding walls.
5.
With a wallboard saw, cut the
scrap piece of drywall to size by
following the cutting lines. Set the
drywall patch aside to use later.
8.
Still holding onto the center of the board, repeat Step 7 to
fasten the other end of the anchor board to the wall.

4
Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
9.
Insert a screw about halfway into
the center of the drywall patch
with screwdriver. Leave enough of
the screw exposed to form a
handle.
10. Place drywall patch into hole, butting it up against the anchor board.
11. Holding the center screw if necessary to keep
the patch in place, use the screw gun to insert a
screw all the way through the drywall patch
and into the anchor board. Repeat this step
three more times until the drywall patch is
firmly attached to the anchor board.
12. Remove the center screw handle.

5
Repairing Large Holes in Drywall
13. Use a broad knife or putty knife to cover
all seams and screws with a thick layer
of drywall mud and remove excess mud,
but don’t worry about smoothing it out
yet.
14. Press strips of drywall tape over the mud-
covered seams and screws.
15. Smooth the tape out with the flat edge of
putty knife or broad knife.
16. Spread another thick layer of drywall mud on top of the tape.

6
Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
17. Smooth the mud with the flat
edge of your knife, removing
excess mud and feathering out
edges on adjoining drywall. Let
the drywall mud dry thoroughly,
according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
18. Using 120-grit sandpaper and a sanding
block, sand all patched areas until smooth
and even with surrounding drywall.
If there’s no stud behind the hole, one board is enough to provide backing for the new piece of drywall.
19. Vacuum the patch to remove dust, and prime the patch before
painting.

 Latex gloves
 Clean rags
 Stir sticks

Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Put down a dropcloth to cover the area
where you plan to work, and tape any areas
of the cupboard that you don’t want to paint.
Put on latex gloves, and wipe the cupboard
clean with a damp rag.
Antiquing a Cupboard
Everything new is old again. Or something like that. Give character to new
furniture pieces by imitating the effect that years of wear, tear, and weather
might produce. In about a day, you can move a brand-new cupboard
through decades of use, giving it the character of age. Or just revive an old
piece with a “new to it” paint job.

2
Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
3.
Use a stir stick to thoroughly stir the lighter
of the two shades of paint. Then using a
clean, dry brush, roughly brush on the
lighter shade of paint, again leaving some of
the wood showing though. Try to cover most
of the base color, but don’t worry about pre-
cision. Imperfect work is better for this proj-
ect. Let this coat of paint dry completely.
2.
Use a stir stick to thoroughly stir the darker of
the two shades of paint. Then using a flat, dry
brush, apply a patchy layer of dark-colored
paint to the cupboard. Leave some wood 
showing through. Let this coat of paint dry
completely.
4.
Wrap sandpaper around the sanding block,
and use it to rub off haphazard areas of the
top paint layer, revealing the base layer of
paint.
5.
Seal the cupboard by brushing on a coat of
acrylic varnish with a clean brush.

Crackle Glazing a Table
Toolbox:
 Dropcloth
 220-grit sandpaper
 Tack cloth
 Clean rags
 Latex gloves
 Stir sticks
 Latex paint for base coat
 2-inch flat sash brush
 Crackle glaze
 Latex paint in contrasting
color for top coat
Time Needed:
About a weekend
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Crackle glazes provide different looks depending on how you apply
them: Using a roller creates a more delicate look, and brushing on a
thick layer of glaze produces bigger cracks. You can use crackling to
give bland pieces of furniture an intriguing new look, but it’s hard on the
eyes when worked over large surfaces like walls. This project addresses
crackling on a table.
1.
Working on your dropcloth, sand any rough
edges on the table.

2
Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
2.
Wipe down the table with a tack
cloth or damp rag to remove dust
and grit.
3.
Put on latex gloves, and use a stir
stick to thoroughly stir the base
paint. Then use a 2-inch flat brush
to apply the base coat of paint.
Allow the paint to dry overnight.
4.
Put on latex gloves, and use a stir stick to thoroughly stir
the crackle glaze. Then with a clean 2-inch flat brush,
apply an even coat of crackling glaze, moving the brush
only in the direction in which you want the cracks to
form. (Brushing over the glaze more than once interferes
with the crackle effect.) Allow the glaze to dry for 3 to 4
hours.

3
Crackle Glazing a Table
5.
Wearing gloves, stir the top paint thoroughly
with a stir stick. Then brush on the top coat
of paint using a 2-inch flat brush and strokes
in one direction. Work swiftly and without
making repeated brush strokes. Let the paint
dry completely to reveal the crackled effect.
Creating a great-looking crackle effect is simple, but using the wrong paint makes it impossible. Make sure that
the paint you apply as a top coat is water-based.

1
Stuff You 
Need to Know
Marbling a Picture Frame
Go ahead and buy the inexpensive wood frames you see at discount
stores or — better yet — garage sales. You can jazz them up with a
great-looking but not terribly challenging faux marble effect after you
get them home. Even your first attempts likely will be, um, suitable for
framing.
Toolbox:
 Newspaper
 Latex gloves
 Pearlescent acrylic
paints in gold and silver
 Disposable plastic plate
 Two 2-inch flat sash
brushes
 Wooden picture frame
 Acrylic paints in mustard
yellow, black, and gray
 Glaze
 Stencil brushes
 Plastic wrap
Time Needed:
Less than half a
day
1.
Lay down enough newspaper to cover your workspace. Then
wearing latex gloves, shake up the gold pearlescent paint and
pour some onto the plastic plate.
2.
Use a 2-inch flat brush to paint the 
frame with gold paint. Let this paint 
dry completely.

2
Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
3.
Put on gloves, and squeeze dollops of mus-
tard yellow, black, and gray paint onto your
plastic plate.
4.
Working quickly, apply a thick coat of glaze
to the frame with a clean 2-inch flat brush.
5.
Without giving the glaze a chance to dry, 
use the stencil brushes to randomly dab 
the acrylic paint colors onto the wet, 
glazed frame.
6.
Press a piece of plastic wrap flat over the
wet frame. Don’t move it around.
7.
Pull the wrap straight up off the frame and reapply it as in Step 6. The wrap will begin to
crinkle a little as you use it, which is fine; don’t worry too much about keeping it flat.
Repeat this step until you’re happy with the effect you’ve achieved.

Giving Wood a Metallic Finish
Put a new shine on an old desk, table, or shelf by giving it the appear-
ance of brushed metal. This two-step process requires little in the way
of experience or artistry but gives wood furniture a sharp, contempo-
rary look that stands out.
Toolbox:
 Dropcloth
 220-grit sandpaper
 Tack cloth
 Clean rags
 Latex gloves
 Latex paint
 Stir sticks
 Roller tray and liner
 Mini-roller
 Metallic glaze
 3-inch flat sash brush
 12-inch wallpaper brush
Time Needed:
About a weekend
1.
Working on a dropcloth, sand any rough spots from the
shelf.

2
Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
Painting Do-It-Yourself For Dummies 
2.
Clean dust and debris from the shelf with a
tack cloth or damp rag.
3.
Wearing latex gloves, stir the paint thoroughly with a stir stick, and then pour
some into the paint tray.
5.
Wearing gloves, stir the metallic glaze thor-
oughly. Use a 3-inch flat brush to apply glaze
to one side of the shelf.
4.
Use the mini-roller to apply a
base coat of paint to the shelf.
Let the paint dry overnight.

3
Giving Wood a Metallic Finish
6.
Lightly drag the wallpaper brush over the
wet glaze to create overlapping strokes.
Some base color should show through the
glaze.
Because you’re making visible brushstrokes, this finish works best on pieces that have room for the texture to
shine. Spindly legs or intricate chairs need not apply.
7.
Repeat Steps 5 and 6 until the shelf is completely glazed and textured.

Creating a Granite Finish
Liven up a plain-Jane table, shelf,
lamp, or what-have-you with a
simple, fun, and frankly messy
paint technique. Whatever your
color scheme, dig deep in your
dresser for clothes that you won’t
mind giving a spattered, granite
finish as you work.
The spatter technique works with
any color combination (which
makes it great for using up all that
leftover paint in your garage), but
if you want the end result to
resemble real granite, head out to
a home-supply store to look at
varieties of real granite before you
choose your paint colors. You
find a wide variety of granite,
including pink versions and dark,
glossy grays. This project shows
the granite finish on the base of a
lamp.
Toolbox:
 Dropcloths
 Clean rags
 Latex gloves
 Latex paint in four colors
 Stir sticks
 2-inch flat sash brush
 Three small paint 
containers
 2-inch blue painter’s tape
 Three 1- or 11⁄2-inch flat

 Matte acrylic varnish
Time Needed:
About a day
Stuff You 
Need to Know
1.
Cover your work area with dropcloths. Make sure you cover a space a
few feet longer and wider than the lamp base you’re painting. Spattering
paint knows no boundaries.
2.
Wipe down the lamp base with a damp rag.
(There’s no need to worry about sanding
because the paint effect is uneven anyway.)
Use painter’s tape to cover any areas that you
don’t want painted.

2

3.
Wearing latex gloves, use a stir stick to 
thoroughly stir your base paint. Then use a
2-inch flat sash brush to apply the base layer
of paint, and let it dry completely.
4.
In one mixing container, stir together the first spatter
color of paint with water so that you get a mixture
that’s approximately nine parts paint to one part water.
Then load a flat sash brush with paint, and then shake
it gently in the bucket to fling off excess.
5.
Hold the extra paintbrush a couple inches
from the base of the lamp, and strike the
loaded flat sash brush against it so that the
two connect near the paint-loaded brush’s
bristles.

3
Creating a Granite Finish
7.
Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with a clean brush
and a different spatter color, this time
spattering the lamp until only about a
third of the base coat is visible. Let the
second spatter coat dry.
6.
Spatter paint on the lamp until only
about half the base coat shows
through. Let the first spatter coat
dry completely.

Toothbrushes, whisk brooms, and just about anything with bristles work for this project, but a trim brush is the
least-messy way to get the job done. If you don’t want to spend money on brushes, though, take a look around
your house for something you wouldn’t mind committing to the project. If you use something with a larger
brush surface, drag the stick over the bristles instead of tapping the brush against it.
8.
Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with a clean brush and
a third spatter color, this time spattering
very little. The final spatter coat should pro-
vide a highlight here and there among the
other colors. Let the paint dry.
9.
Wearing gloves, use a 2-inch flat brush to apply at least one coat of matte acrylic
varnish to the lamp.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Verdigris is the greenish tint that certain metals take on after they’ve lived
a little — think old penny or the Statue of Liberty. The technique for imitat-
ing it with paint is quick, and it gives great character to objects (metal or
otherwise) that haven’t earned their own colors yet.
1.
Use a damp rag to wipe down the chair that you plan to paint. Then using painter’s
tape and newspaper, cover any areas of the chair that you don’t want to paint.
2.
Working on a dropcloth in a well-venti-
lated area and wearing latex gloves,
spray paint the brown or copper-col-
ored base coat over the exposed parts
of the chair. Follow the manufacturer’s
instructions for using the spray paint.
Let the paint dry for about an hour.

3.
Stir or shake up the acrylic paints
and pour a dollop of each one onto a
disposable palette.
4.
Using a damp sponge, dab the medium teal
paint onto the chair in random sections so
that it covers about three-quarters of the
base coat.
The spray paint base coat doesn’t have to be completely dry for you to proceed to the next step, but you don’t
want the paint to be so wet that it rubs off and muddies your first accent layer.
5.
Using a different damp sponge, dab the
lighter teal paint onto the chair in random
sections that cover only about one-quarter
of the chair.

6.
Use a third sponge to dab on the rust color
sparingly. Use it only as a highlight.
This project uses four colors of paint, but if you have white paint on hand, you can save a little money by mixing
it with your medium teal color to produce the light shade of teal.
7.
Let the paint dry completely before you spray the chair with acrylic var-
nish. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper application of the
varnish.

Painting a Tortoiseshell Jewelry Box
A plain wood jewelry box gets swankified with a few simple swipes of a
paintbrush and some varnish. A tortoiseshell finish is almost impossi-
ble not to pull off, even if it’s your first attempt at faux painting. The
effect relies on random splotches of paint rather than the precision that
some other techniques require, so even the least crafty person can pull
it off with flair.

2.
Put on latex gloves, and use a stir stick to
thoroughly stir the latex paint. Then using
the 2-inch flat sash brush, apply a latex base
coat to the jewelry box. Let the paint dry.
3.
Shake up the acrylic paints and, wearing
gloves, place a dollop of each acrylic paint
color onto the palette.
4.
Mix a few drops of mineral spirits and
acrylic glaze into each color, blending the
mixtures with the artist’s brushes (one
brush for each color). Stir in more mineral
spirits, a few drops at a time, until the
paint is thin but not translucent.

6.
While the glaze is still wet, blend the
colors by very lightly sweeping the 
softener/blender brush forward and 
backward over the whole box.
7.
Repeat Step 6, brushing over the box in a dif-
ferent direction. Let the box dry overnight.
8.
Stir the acrylic gloss varnish with a stir stick,
and use a 2-inch flat sash brush to apply a
coat to the box. If desired, let that coat dry
completely before brushing on another.
5.
Using a different brush for each color, paint
small, curved brush strokes all over the
painted box. Vary the size and thickness of
the strokes. Use primarily the burnt sienna
and raw umber colors, with the red and
black splotched on randomly as highlights.
Leave some of the gold base color showing
through.
