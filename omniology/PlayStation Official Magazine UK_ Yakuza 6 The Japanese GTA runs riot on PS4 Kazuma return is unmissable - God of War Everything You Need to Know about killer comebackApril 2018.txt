“PLAYSTATION’S 
HERITAGE IS A 
GATEWAY INTO 
A WORLD  
OF UNIQUE 
ExPERIENCES.”
W
e’re leaning heavily on Japanese 
games this issue, which recalls PS2 
in its heyday. Though cover game 
Yakuza 6: The Song Of Life (p32) is bringing 
Kazuma Kiryu’s story to an end, there’s no 
better time to catch up than now – exclusive 
to PlayStation 4, it’s shaping into one of the 
year’s best open world games.
The overseas influence continues with  
Shadow Of The Colossus. The Team Ico 
classic has been remade for PS4 and we 
review it this issue (p86), where it’s joined 
by Monster Hunter: World (p76). The 
Japanese line-up concludes with Ni No Kuni 
II: Revenant Kingdom – we go hands-on with 
the latest JRPG from hit-maker Level-5 
(p44). All these titles are timely reminders 
of PlayStation’s heritage as a gateway into a 
world of unique experiences.
That’s not to say we’ve neglected PS4’s  
Western games. Our God Of War feature 
(p50) rounds up all the latest info on Kratos’ 
return, while starting on p62 we pick the 18 
most impressive-looking indie games coming 
your way in 2018.

the bubble 
has to burst. 
we keep 
hearing this 
same old 
mantra, but 
this stance 
ignores the 
facts. in 2017 sony sold over two 
million ps VR headsets worldwide 
(as of 3 december, 2017). that’s a 
staggering number for a ‘fad’. 
it could be argued that the VR 
bubble is set to burst – just not 
when it comes to sony’s hardware. 
ps VR is cheaper than rival pc 
headsets, is comfortable, has a 
fantastic screen, and is lightweight. 
“the fact that the headset works 
with playstation, which millions of 
players already own, lowers the 
barrier to entry significantly,” says 
neill glancy, creative director at 
aspyr media, which is working on 
horror adventure torn. “sony’s 
strategy of coupling the device as 
an accessory for an established 
console is genius.”
talking to devs, the feeling is 
that ps VR offers exactly what 
we need right now; the simple fun 
of inhabiting a VR space with 1:1 
tracking is enough to blow minds. 
samurai punk’s winston tang, 
director, writer, and programmer of 
satirical VR shooter the american 
dream, says: “ps VR has proven 
itself as an affordable, consumer-
friendly VR headset, but from here, 
the platform needs to prove that it 
can support a breadth of high-
quality content.”
Virtual Variety 
even in this regard ps VR looks to 
be ahead of the game. if variety is 
the spice of life, then sony’s 
headset is a pick ‘n’ mix of tasty 
delights. in 2017 the most 
downloaded game for the system 
was Job simulator, a quirky series 
of comical mini-games based 
around real-world jobs. but also big 
on the system was fps superhot 
VR, open-world Rpg the elder 
scrolls V: skyrim VR, and sim-cade 
racer driveclub VR. 
the challenge for sony is to build 
on this momentum in 2018. the 
recently released updated headset, 
playstation VR 
has proved itself 
– so what’s next?
in 2017 ps VR had its best year ever.

dev talk
“in Blood & truth 
we’re looking at 
new methods 
of locomotion, 
animation tech and 
photogrammetry and 
working towards 
creating a AAA 
experience. the result 
is a truly immersive 
game which puts you 
right in the middle of 
the story, letting you 
discover for yourself 
what it feels like to be 
the action hero.”
Stuart Whyte 
Director of Vr product 
development,  
SiE london Studio
which features improved, built-in 
earphones and cabling, is a start, 
but we need more original games 
argues tam armstrong, studio 
director and co-founder at polyarc, 
developer of mouse adventure 
moss. “people will appreciate what 
VR has to offer when it can show 
them something that they respond 
to. this will require variety of tone, 
design, price, and scope in the 
games available.”
game gamers 
samurai punk’s tang says current 
ps VR players should be given 
credit for encouraging developers 
to try harder and experiment. “i 
think the current population of VR 
players are the innovators, people 
who want the latest and greatest, 
so it’s natural for them to be 
attracted to new experiences.”
it means developers have greater 
freedom to experiment with ps VR. 
there are no rules and currently 
no guaranteed model for success, 
“which is equal parts liberating and 
terrifying,” says tang, adding: “until 
the audience decides what they 
like in VR it’s up to creators to just 
make the best, most interesting 
content they can.”
the american dream is a prime 
example of a dev testing to see 
what works. it’s a satirical blend 
of fps, on-rails shooting, and 
point-and-click adventure; it even 
has Rpg elements. tang explains: 
“we put the player into a bunch of 
ridiculous scenarios where they can 
act things out physically because 
their bodies are truly present in the 
game’s world.” if you wondered how 
you feed a baby with a gun, then 
now you can find out, safe in the 
knowledge it’s ‘virtually’ real.
like samurai punk, aspyr media 
is developing a ground-up game 
especially for ps VR. called torn, 
the game blends horror and 
puzzling into a walking sim set in 
an abandoned house in the middle 
of the dense Vermont forest. neill 
glancy believes games built for ps 
VR have a distinct advantage over 
those transferred to the system, 
and he goes further, saying: 
“personally i think we are going to 
see a new type of game archetype 
emerge for VR that is unique to 
the medium. this hybrid will be 
a combination of conventional 
gameplay but with a major 
emphasis on touristic engagement.”
over at grab games, the 
developer of arcade boxing sim 
knockout league, harold Vancol, 
agrees: “a lot of VR experiences 
are just fundamentally different 
from the way we’ve all been used to 
playing, and that’s really exciting.” 
with a varied lineup coming this 
year, including the moba dark 
eclipse, fantasy adventure golem, 
and Vacation simulator (sequel to 
2017’s best-selling Job simulator) 
the future, according to Vancol, 
looks bright. he predicts with 
an increase in games will come 
a price drop: “as the amount of 
great content goes up, the price of 
hardware goes down, which gets 
us to a sweet spot. i think the first 
generation of VR is approaching 
that sweet spot.”
next-gen Vr 
what of playstation 5? should 
sony’s next console come with VR 
built in or is it better to keep the 
systems separate? Vancol says: 
“buying a new console is a big 
undertaking for a lot of people, and 
buying the headset that i think 
people want to see in the future of 
playstation can almost be like 
buying a new console. so having 
these purchases separated gives 
each thing its own time to shine.”
however, the developer believes 
playstation 5 and ps VR together 
“should be considered essential.”

With a new 
blockbuster film 
around the corner 
it’s time to get 
excited about 
Jurassic World, and 
the news that Frontier’s game will 
be putting risk into the world-
building genre gives us hope this 
could be the one to 
bottle the peril 
prevalent in the 
films. That’s a 
tough ask in a 
game that revolves 
around building and 
managing a dino 
theme park. 
“The one thing lacking from 
management games is a sense of 
peril and drama,” says Jurassic 
World: Evolution’s game director, 
Michael Brookes. “We want players 
to be park manager, but we also 
want them to feel the same way they 
feel when they watch the movies – 
caught up in the action, scared, 
excited – and that’s a challenge for  
a management game.”
The developer is keen to harness 
the type of thrilling cinematic action 
reserved for the likes of Uncharted. 
Brookes even hints Jurassic fans will 
get the chance to 
experience classic 
scenes in their 
park. He says: “If 
you mismanage 
your park, I expect 
life will find a way 
to recreate lots of 
classic scenes from the movies!”
Being fans themselves has aided 
the team at Frontier when it comes 
to bringing cinema’s favourite dino 
movies to PlayStation 4. Brookes 
says when work began the team had 
lists of references they wanted to 
squeeze in. “We really want this to 
be the ultimate Jurassic fan game 
– and that includes material from the 
novels as well as the movies.”
There’s a huge wealth of material 
to draw upon, so how will it all make 
it into the game? Brookes has the 
answer: “The game takes place after 
the events of Jurassic World but 
before Jurassic World: Fallen 
Kingdom, and we’re drawing upon 
and referencing every corner of the 
Jurassic canon in all kinds of ways. I 
want to leave a lot of them as Easter 
eggs and surprises so players can 
discover them first-hand.” We hope 
there’s a Jeff Goldblum Easter egg!

challenges and missions from the 
Hammond Foundation’s scientific, 
entertainment, and security divisions 
along the way. How you mix these 
strands into your park will change 
the type of reserve you have to 
manage, and the kinds of dinos you 
need to control. 
“You can engage with the game 
how you choose,” says Brookes. “If 
you want to spend hours on one 
island even after you’ve achieved all 
that’s asked of you, go ahead!”
But whatever you’re doing, and 
whichever path you take, you’ll have 
a lot to manage at any given 
moment. “It should be a challenge to 
run a successful Jurassic island – it 
hasn’t been done in almost 30 years, 
after all,” says Brookes.

Final Fantasy XV 
gets a Royal Edition
03
More than just a 
‘complete edition’, 
the new Final 
Fantasy XV Royal 
Edition features all 
previous DLC, plus 
new content that expands the 
game’s already vast world, and adds 
new ways of playing. 
Due for release 6 March, Final 
Fantasy XV Royal 
Edition’s new 
content includes 
an expansion of 
the Crown City Of 
Insomnia map to 
include Insomnia 
City Ruins – where 
new side-quests 
and battles with 
Cerberus and Omega, as well as the 
Rulers Of Yore, await.
There’s more. If you’ve ever looked 
at the map of Eos and wondered 
what hidden gems lay between Cape 
Caem and Altissia, now you can find 
out. The Royal Edition includes a new 
boat – the Royal Vessel – to scoot 
around in and explore. The Regalia 
Type-D isn’t forgotten; a new quest 
enables you to strengthen and 
develop the boys’ off-road roadster, 
which came with last year’s 1.2 
content update.
If you prefer to focus on Final 
Fantasy XV’s combat you’ll be 
pleased to hear Noctis’ Armiger 
Limit Break is expanded in this 
edition. A new accessory hidden 
somewhere in the game’s world will 
enable you to activate the new 
Armiger 
Unleashed 
summon.
One of the best 
new modes added 
in FFXV Royal 
Edition is the 
option to play the 
entire game in 
first-person mode 
– now we can see what Noctis sees. 
If you already own Final Fantasy 
XV then you can download the Royal 
Pack on release and get all the new 
content. Die-hard fans should hunt 
out the boxed edition, which features 
reversible inlay artwork by series 
legend Yoshitaka Amano.

venture into the forest to come face 
to face with a tree-man dripping in 
orange sap – weird.
It’s the new shuffling first-person 
movement that is the star of the 
demo. It has been developed to 
simulate the feel of handheld cinema 
cameras; its weight, momentum, and 
speed has been fine-tuned to offer 
just enough ‘shake’.

Ark: Survival 
Evolved fans  
will soon have 
something to 
share with the 
littler gamers in 
their lives. Developer Snail Games 
has drawn inspiration from that 
title’s exciting action to make an 
approachable survival game for a 
younger audience.
You wake up stranded in a 
world of voxels. If you want to 
stand a chance against the big 
beasties that call this place their 
stomping ground, you’ll need to 
lead a life of exploration, hunting, 
harvesting, crafting, and even 
animal handling. It’s a big sandbox 
full of procedurally generated 
environments, from jungles to 
deserts and many other biomes. 
The game also procedurally 
generates quest lines.
You can look forward to 
uncovering this strange place’s 
secrets (and maybe even a pet 
dinosaur) when PixArk releases 
on PlayStation 4 later this year.

We’ve been keeping 
our critical eye on 
Milestone’s new IP 
for some time and 
for a good reason. 
The new release, 
which lands 27 Feb, is looking to 
return a bit of arcade action to the 
racing genre, and we head out to 
Milan to get a final 
hands on with the 
game as well as 
chat with one of 
the developers.
We’re getting a 
chance to sample 
the career mode 
during our eager 
playtest, which gives us our first hint 
at the OTT style Milestone is aiming 
for. Your driver is taking part in the 
fictional Gravel Channel’s Masters 
show, where you’ll need to prove 
yourself in four disciplines and take 
on previous champions of the event. 
Our first race is a lap around Blue 
Paradise, an island in the Pacific 
Ocean. We can’t help but feel 
reminded of MotorStorm as we tear 
across a sandy shore before 
following the track into a tropical 
forest and out towards the beach 
again. That’s partly down to the 
sheer volume of 
jumps we come 
across, and mainly 
because of the 
focus on speed 
over simulation. 
Good old days
So why the arcade 
direction? R&D programmer Michele 
Caletti explains to us that Milestone 
saw a gap in the market for this type 
of racing experience, a gap that’s 
existed for the last few years. 
Expanding on that, he says: “There’s 
a empty niche and in terms of 
conceptual freedom you can  
express a lot when you’re not 
making a game based on a single 
license. So, we said ‘Okay, we can try 
to experiment with new technical 
and conceptual aspects.’” 
There are obvious instances of 
this experimentation, such as 
Milestone’s move to Unreal Engine 4, 
away from its in-house engine, and 
then more subtle ones, such as the 
way cars handle. A great example of 
this is a cross country dash across 
Namibia. A desert location means 
we’re racing across sandy dunes, 
and we’re barely into top gear 
before we come across a huge jump 
that gives us some serious air. When 
we’re down on terra firma once 
more, the course offers plenty of 
chances to drift through corners, 
with our Toyota T100 (the cars we 
use in the game are officially 
we’re barely 
into top gear 
before we come 
across a huge 
jump.

team talk
while it’s not going to 
dislodge Driveclub as 
the best racing game 
on ps4, there’s a lot 
to like about gravel 
– visually varied 
locations, a decent 
selection of licensed 
motors and, most 
importantly, a lack 
of self-importance. 
that’s something 
that’s been all-too 
prominent in ps4 
racing games over 
recent years.

licensed) neither too stubborn nor 
skidding all over the shop. 
Caletti tells us that when it came 
to designing the feel of the cars, the 
team worked on the physics and 
level design at the same time, 
tweaking one or the other when they 
discovered a feeling they liked. He 
elaborates on the effect this 
process has had: “It’s an interactive 
aspect and you can notice it in some 
tracks like Alaska or Namibia, where 
things have worked together very 
well in creating a different flow and 
a different feeling, so with the same 
car you can play in very distinct 
ways in different areas of the game.” 
Finish line
But what really sets Gravel apart is 
the lack of competition on PS4 right 
now for an arcade-leaning racer. 
Along with Codemasters’ Onrush, 
Gravel represents an opposite 
approach to the serious realism that 
has become so prevalent in racing 
games nowadays. Caletti says: 
“Everybody is making simulation 
games. These games, I’ve seen 
people being turned off. [They] buy 
the game, ride the hype and find that 
it wasn’t the game they wanted. 
They liked the idea, but when you’re 
playing, have hour sessions and you 
always restart the race because 
you’re not enjoying it, or you don’t 
have rewind, or you’re not unlocking 
anything, you’re pissed off.”
Forward momentum isn’t hard to 
discover during our career mode 
hands-on. Races are quick, and it’s 
not too difficult to amass the stars 
you need to unlock other episodes, 
boss races, and new cars. On top of 
that, if they fancy a challenge more 
skilled racers will be able to increase 
the difficulty by adjusting gameplay 
modifiers, such as turning off 
braking and stability aids.
Caletti sums up why we’re looking 
forward to the full version of Gravel 
quite succinctly: “Sometimes [you] 
need a good game that doesn’t 
boast that ‘more realistic than real’ 
blurb. You just need something to 
have fun with.”
 gravel comes out on 27 feb and we’ll 
have a review next issue.

Seen as one of the 
greatest games  
of all time, the 
original Dark Souls 
RPG released 
towards the end of 
PlayStation 3’s lifespan but grew 
into a gaming phenomenon that’s 
constantly referred to and aped. 
While the two sequels released on 
PlayStation 4, the game that 
launched a thousand imitators 
[Maybe 10 or so – ed] is finally 
getting a remastered release on  
25 May. It means we can at last 
suffer in Lordran all over again,  
and again, and again.
If you have the gumption to take 
the challenge once more, Dark 
Souls: Remastered will at least 
look good while you repeatedly die. 
With a solid 60 frames per second 
and 4K visuals on PS4 Pro (60fps 
and 1080p on vanilla PS4), this 
classic game will sparkle like never 
before, and that stable framerate 
could even make it easier. We’re 
also being promised dedicated 
multiplayer servers, which will 
ensure connecting and sharing 
online will be more stable than on 
the PS3 original.
As well as getting a visual 
overhaul Dark Souls: Remastered 
will come packaged with the 
Artorias Of The Abyss DLC – 
travel through space and time to 
save the land of Oolacile from an 
ancient big bad, kill an evil knight, 
and die a lot.
Lastly, the game’s multiplayer 
count will rise from four to six. 
Crucial to Dark Souls was the 
ability to be drawn into other 
players’ games to help them  
battle a boss, or ‘invade’ games  
to kill rival players and steal  
their ‘Humanity’. 
 
three’s company 
While the remastered edition is 
heading our way, over in Japan 
fans will have the opportunity 
to buy the Dark Souls Trilogy 
boxset. Containing the new Dark 
Souls: Remastered, as well as 
Dark Souls II: Scholar Of The First 
Sin and Dark Souls III: The Fire 
Fades Edition, the collection also 
includes soundtrack CDs, an item 
encyclopedia, memorial art set, 
and a smart set of bookends. 
Presently, there’s no word if this 
trilogy edition is coming to the UK. 
Having sold an estimated  
13 million copies worldwide 
between the three Dark Souls 
releases to date, we expect 
this remaster to notch up a 
few more sales in May.

 See more on the Onyx controller and 
Hori’s PlayStation 4 lineup at hori.co.uk.
08
Manufacturer Hori 
has a new 
controller for PS4 
to wrap your fat 
thumbs around, 
and it reminds us 
of something. If you’ve recently 
crossed over from gaming’s dark 
side to PS4, but feel the standard 
DualShock 4 is too slim compared to 
your old pad, then Hori has the 
answer in the shape of its chunky 
new Onyx controller.
The wider size and solid build of 
the Onyx are its real plus points. If 
you have larger, meaty hands and 
feel the DualShock 4 is too small, 
then this is a decent option.
However the Onyx has some 
shortcomings compared to the 
DualShock 4. For instance, there’s 
no audio socket to plug your 
headphones into, meaning you’ll rely 
on having a Bluetooth TV. There’s 
also no built-in speaker, so playing 
games that make use of this 
DualShock 4 feature will feel less fun 
– you’ll miss out on LocoRoco 
Remastered’s cute squeaks. Finally, 
there’s no light bar. Not the worst 
news, but some games make 
innovative use of this feature, so 
again, you’re missing out.
All in all, the Onyx controller is 
essential for big-handed players but 
the removal of some key features 
means DualShock 4 is still king. 
■ Triggers are familiar, but there’s no 
lightbar for added PS4 fun.

handy Placement
A key design feature of Hori’s 
new Onyx controller is the 
asymmetrical placement of the 
analogue sticks. This positioning 
is perfect if you have broader 
hands and need more room.
While it’s wider than a 
DualShock 4, the new 
Onyx lacks that pad’s 
core features.

Who needs 4K

visuals when you 
can gather some 
friends around a 
board and take pleasure in killing off 
suspects one at a time? Natually 
we’d rather play a new Hidetaka 
‘Swery’ Suehiro-developed game  
on our PS4 Pros, but we’ll take any 
chance to dip back into the dev’s 
weird me-too Twin Peaks. 
After a successful Kickstarter 
campaign that saw 
the project triple  
its pledge goal, a  
deluxe version of 
Deadly Premonition: 
The Board Game is 
now hitting retail 
shelves. While the A&G mug, ID 
wallets, carry bag, and art prints 
remain exclusive to Kickstarter 
backers, the retail edition will feature 
the game’s soundtrack.
Unboxing our deluxe edition of the 
board game, we unfurl our cloth 
mat, manhandle the ‘murder dice’, 
and shuffle the assorted decks of 
cards – the engine room of Deadly 
Premonition: The Board Game. These 
decks, a mix of Action, Evidence, 
Suspect, and Weather cards (used 
to kill off your rivals’ suspects) will 
decide who lives 
and dies.
Like the cult 
classic PlayStation 
game it’s based on, 
the quality is mixed. 
The cards are small 
and flimsy, but the 
new art used on each one perfectly 
recreates the game’s look, and the 
quirky character descriptions are 
the cream in the board game’s hot 
coffee: ‘Roaming’ Sigourney is a 
“former school teacher. Carries a 
cooking pot. Concerned about it 
getting cold…”
It may not be a new Swery game, 
but we’ll take whatever we can get.

you have 24 hours in Japan  
– so what do you get up to?
i’d enJoy one of

some resident evil

i’ve only ever fired a real 
gun once, and had the 
unnerving desire to stare 
down its barrel. so i 
walked away, never to

However, with 24 hours

– opting for the samurai 
edge, a realistic replica of 
the .45 calibre pistol from 
resident evil. videogame 
memorabilia and shots 
that come in cartridges 
and not down the barrel 
of a gun… now that’s 
more my style. n

not a problem.

market, pronto!
With only 24 hours, it 
pays to start early, so i’d 
head straight over to the 
world-famous fish market 
in ginza to watch the 
auctions. next on my 
whistle-stop tour would 
be some people watching 
over at yoyogi park, the 
rockabillies strutting their 
stuff to a crappy old 
ghettoblaster being a 
highlight, followed by 
scoffing copious amounts 
of takoyaki while downing 
ice-cold kirins under the 
cherry blossom – if i’m 
lucky enough to be there 
in the spring. i’d finish my

Just Evil
When I heard that MediEvil 
would be coming to PS4 I 
was initially quite pleased 
that it would be rejoining 
the public consciousness 
but worried that it 
would be based upon 
the previous rerelease 
on the PSP – MediEvil 
Resurrection. Worried 
because the PSP remake 
was just terrible (well, 
except for the music). 
Then I actually see and 
hear the teaser trailer 
and to my disgust it is 
THE ORIgInaL HaD a gREaT 
gOTHIC aTMOSPHERE WHICH 
WaS REPLaCED WITH OVERLY 
CaRTOOnY BUFFOOnERY.
using audio from MediEvil 
Resurrection.
The original game 
had its own unique style 
and atmosphere, Tim 
Burton crossed with 
very British humour. The 
remake however was 
just discount Shrek, all 
the nuance replaced 
with cheap gags. The 
original had a great 
gothic atmosphere 
which was then ripped 
out and replaced with 
exaggerated, overly 
cartoony buffoonery. The 
original had monster/
character designs 
straight out of English 
folklore yet the first 
remake felt that a Middle 
Eastern genie with a 
stereotypically bad accent 
would somehow fit in 
here. The genie was a 
terrible idea yet was the 
second voice I heard in 
this new teaser.
The thing that made 
the first (and second) 
game work so well was 
that the humour was so 
well underplayed. Dan 
had his pride and dignity 
but he was constantly 
mocked and his dignity 
compromised yet he 
soldiered on all the same. 
Remake Dan was shown 
to actually be an inept 
coward in a story that 
completely missed the 
charm and humour that it 
was supposedly based on.

ideogames are amazing 
things, capable of 
inspiring almost any 
emotion. Although it’s 
incredible that a game 
such as Life Is Strange 
can make us feel loss and sorrow for 
people who never existed, that’s not 
what I want to talk about right now. 
We need to consider the 
implications of a more base, more 
common, more easily triggered 
emotion: anger.
Am I immune to getting furious 
while playing a game? Am I heck. 
Although I’ve never flung a controller 
away in rage (hey, those things are 
expensive), it’s very rare for a whole 
week to pass without me fuming at 
the TV screen. Frustrating siege 
sequence? Unfair boss battle?  
Poorly designed, forced stealth? 
LUKE SMASH!
I’m sure that you can 
sympathise when I say that 
the one aspect of gaming to 
regularly(ish) anger me is 
online play. Don’t imagine 
me constantly holding the 
controller in a death grip, 
throbbing vein threatening 
to burst from my 
forehead. The vast 
majority of the time, 
I’m playing correctly 
– just having fun  
and taking 
mistakes 
on the 
nose. But 
now and 
again (if my killstreak is 
interrupted by a camper, 
say, or if I lose several 
precious places in a race 
thanks to somebody 
purposefully ramming me 
off the track) I’ll swear so 
badly, my mother turns in 
her grave. And she’s not 
even dead – sorry mum.
These moments of intense 
frustration are perfectly 
normal (er, I hope). It’s 
how you deal with 
them that makes all 
the difference. Me? 
After I’ve had my 
mini-tantrum, I 
just brush it 
off and carry 
on; or, if I’m 
having a 
particularly 
bad day, I turn the game off 
once I’m back in the lobby 
in a harmless sulk and go 
to do something else. I suggest that 
these should be your go-to solutions, 
too. The alternatives are not pleasant.
ON-WHINE GAMING
The golden rule is never, ever to forget 
that there’s another human being – 
flesh and blood with thoughts and 
feelings, just like you – behind each 
and every name on the leaderboard. 
Rage quitting is an option, but not 
one you should ever take. It’s childish, 
marks you as a sore loser, and, 
nowadays, is also likely to negatively 
affect your stats, and/or even get you a 
temporary online ban.
Needless to say, it is never, ever 
acceptable to speak or type abuse of 
any kind toward another player. If you 
see or hear it, regardless of whether or 
not it’s directed at you, report it. It’s a 
good idea to block the idiot in 
question, but that’s not enough on its 
own. Reporting reduces the chance 
that he or she (although it’s usually he) 
will do it again, and again, to many 
other people. If you can get a 
screenshot or a video, all the better. 
Bear in mind that the more people 
being subjected to it, the higher the 
chance of an emotionally vulnerable 
person being cut deep.
Last month’s Dragon Ball FighterZ 
reminds us that fighting games can be 
particularly volatile in terms of player 
frustration; the servers of any 
beat-’em-up seem to be flooded with 
experts within days. No matter the 
game, though, let’s all do our best to 
avoid being bad losers… and bad 
winners. Report every bad apple you 
see, and offer a kind word to anybody 
suffering horrific abuse. Makes you a 
winner every time.

ut Jess,” someone is 
undoubtedly saying, 
“Aren’t you some 
kind of humourless 
feminist? Shouldn’t you be 
banging on about how dating 
games objectify women, 
presenting them as little 
more than vending machines 
to be plied with kindness 
coins until naughty pictures 
drop out?” Well, yes, I am 
great fun at parties, after all. 
But I’m not here for that 
particular spiel today. No, 
today, I have something to 
disclose: I really dig dating 
sims and visual novels. While 
I’m no Gal*Gun gal, if there’s 
a tearful rooftop confession or 
the chance to help that cutie 
confront their inner demons, 
I’m on board.
lEssONs IN lOvE
For me, someone who does 
not fare super-well in 
real-world talky situations, 
the genre has a special place 
in my heart, if only for 
imparting the lesson that you 
always have the choice to say 
or do the right thing but 
sometimes it is just best to 
listen… and that, unless you’re 
deliberately going for a Bad 
End, you should never ignore 
your gut when you have a bad 
feeling about someone.
The seedier aspect of dating 
games still persists, and is 
certainly not something I’m 
going to make excuses for, but 
recently devs have shown 
signs of attempting to 
rehabilitate the genre. Games 
like Stardew Valley and the 
Persona series have taken the 
core mechanics and absorbed 
them to tell affecting stories. 
Whether it’s teaching your 
crush self-defence, helping 
them come to terms with 
their alcoholism, or even 
encouraging them to get their 
medical career back on track, 
it’s safe to say there is a 
wealth of storytelling 
opportunities to explore. And 
that’s making no mention of 
the impressive catalogue of 
Otome games, a subset of 
dating sims specifically for 
girls who like boys rather than 
vice versa, on PS Vita.
While the genre is 
becoming more approachable 
for women over time, options 
for girls who like other girls 
are extremely limited on 
consoles, as are titles 
specifically for anyone else 
under the LGBT+ umbrella. 
This is a damn shame but I 
can only hope I’ve persuaded 
a few more like-minded 
gamers to give the genre a go 
and vote with their thumbs.
A
h, February. The 
month of bitterly 
cold weather, 
Valentine’s Day (or 
moaning about Valentine’s 
Day), and wondering which 
games to play to get away 
from it all. The Christmas 
rush has finally settled down 
and if Santa treated you to a 
few games over that period, 
there’s a high chance you 
might want to try something 
new. But instead of hunting 
down the latest blockbuster, 
why not discover something 
a bit different? 
You see, the industry goes a 
little quieter in these winter 
months. Not to sleep – we 
have reviews of Monster 
Hunter: World and Shadow 
Of The Colossus in this issue 
as proof of that – but the 
bigger games are few and far 
between. I used to use this 
time of year to sink further 
down the FIFA rabbit hole, 
biding my time before the 
onslaught of games that 
would hit around Easter. But 
over the past few months I’ve 
found myself using it as a 
time to catch up on the 
smaller gems I’d missed out 
on earlier. 
Last year, for instance, I got 
a chance to dive into The 
Flame And The Flood when 
reviewing it for OPM. A 
languid survival sim, in it  
you have to try to reach 
sanctuary by travelling 
through a flooded, post-
apocalyptic America. It’s the 
sort of game that I would 
have let drift past me if it had 
landed during the busier 
months of the year, but with 
little else around I found 
myself hooked on its charm 
and peculiar rhythms. As it’s 
a more manageable length 
than most AAA titles, it was 
nice to see an ending and 
move on. 
ZEItGEIst surfEr
‘But why only do this in the 
early months?’ I hear you cry, 
‘Why not play great games 
all year round?’ Good point, 
fictional voice of dissent. 
Because like a lot of people, 
I love having a discussion 
about the latest things that 
are out. When I see my 
Twitter timeline full of people 
chatting about FIFA or COD 
or Wolfenstein, I want to 
join in. So when the release 
schedule slows down a tad, 
it’s the perfect time to start a 
conversation about the things 
that get drowned out by the 
big guns. Try it. You never 
know, you might just discover 
your new favourite game.

1 OxenFree
A group of teens spend the 
weekend on a remote island 
only to open a rift into 
another dimension. While at 
its heart a coming-of-age 
story, Oxenfree maintains an 
eerie atmosphere, mostly 
from the radio you use to 
tune into strange 
frequencies, which can 
trigger time loops.
2 GHOStHunter
It sounds like a Ghostbusters 
rip-off, including a premise 
which has your cop hero 
unwittingly push an actual 
red button that releases a 
horde of ghosts from 
confinement. That said, it 
was a fairly pretty game for 
its time and struck a balance 
between creepy and campy. 
The true horror turned out 
to be its level design.

Jodie Holmes shares a 
psychic link with incorporeal 
being Aiden, the second soul

do things like 
communicate with the 
dead. Trying to have a 
social or romantic life 
when tethered to a 
spirit, on the other hand, 
isn’t so easy. 
4 MicHiGan:

A ‘found-footage’ take on 
survival horror, you play as a 
cameraman for a news 
crew, reporting from a city 
filled with mysterious mist 
that’s having a monstrous 
effect on people. Not only is 
the perspective always 
through the camera’s 
viewfinder, if you run out of 
film it’s Game Over.

What’s scarier than playing a 
horror game in first person? 
Playing it in VR. Wandering 
around a house in the dark 
with 360-degree audio will 
make you freak out, though 
eschewing the films’ found- 
footage concept makes the 
license redundant. Still, it 
has its own tricks: jump 
scares are placed differently 
for each playthrough.
 
6 prOject ZerO
One of the first games to 
capitalise on our fascination 
with J-horror. As a Japanese 
schoolgirl, you investigate a 
creepy mansion, where you 
face malevolent spirits that 
can only be neutralised with 
a special camera. To make 
matters worse, the camera 
is at its most effective when 
the ghosts get close.
7 Murdered:  
SOul SuSpect
Your protagonist, Ronan O’ 
Connor, gets bumped off at 
the start and, like a less 
charming Patrick Swayze, he 
comes back as a ghost 
determined to solve the 
case. Being a ghost detective 
doesn’t offer nearly as much 
freedom as you’d like, though 
side-quests do allow you to 
help other ghosts resolve 
their unfinished business.
8 tHe x-FileS: 
reSiSt Or SerVe
We couldn’t forget Mulder 
and Scully. This PS2 title not 
only featured voice acting 
from David Duchovny and 
Gillian Anderson, the story 
was penned by show writer 
Tom Schnauz, and advertised 
as three ‘lost’ episodes. Just 
a shame it played more like a 
poor man’s Resident Evil.

Silent Hills may be no more 
but its ‘playable teaser’ 
remains dread-inducing. 
From the moment you open 
the first door, rarely has a 
game created an 
atmosphere so oppressive 
– and that’s before you spot 
the ghost watching you.

How do I always end up back in 
this damn city?” asks Kazuma 
Kiryu, the gangster with a heart 
of gold. This ageing Yakuza craves 
a quiet life. But there’s always 
some new crisis that draws him 
back in to this fictionalised version of Tokyo’s red 
light district. Once again, it’s personal: Kazuma’s 
adoptive daughter, Haruka, has gone missing.
The biological daughter of his childhood love, the 
pair formed an unconventional familial bond at the 
beginning of the series. More recently, the pair have 
grown distant as Haruka pursued a career as an Idol. 
She gave up her dream mid-concert to reform a 
family with her ‘Uncle’ Kazuma. She reunites with 
a heavily injured Kiryu on a snowy street. And yes, 
you will cry all over again when you see this scene 
as part of the opening 45-minute recap. (It’s kind 
of embarrassing for us as we play it at a hands-on, 
surrounded by other journos.) However, if you are 
a stone-cold fan unmoved by the story’s emotional 
twists and turns, then the stark contrast between 
these old scenes and the new visuals created for the 
series’ first outing on the Dragon Engine just might 
encourage a single tough-nut tear of joy from you.

rivals lined up before him. Talking to each of these 
shoreside shades makes Kazuma reminisce about all 
they’ve been through together, offering refreshing 
nuggets as to their role in the story. Sadly, back in 
reality, it’s revealed that Kiryu will be arrested, and 
has a three-year prison sentence ahead of him.
When he finally finds himself back on the outside, 
he discovers Haruka hasn’t been heard from in a year 
and that there’s no other option but to return to 
Kamurocho to look for leads as to what happened to 
her. And this is the point when we get to step into 
his shoes once again. 
Returning to those streets, the city feels more alive 
now than ever. You can eavesdrop on the remarkably 
involved phone conversations of passersby in the 
street, walk around chugging CC Lemon, and even 
snap a quick picture on your smartphone by pressing 
8 (a catchy ringtone plays out of your controller 
whenever you get a new text message). Loading 
screens are fewer in number, though noticeable 
when they do turn up as the map has been greatly 
expanded and there is now no transition when you 
enter a building. Every corner is teeming with side-
stories, including tracking down merchandise for 
Haruka’s littlest fan, Kazuma being taught the basics 
of Live Chat, and an especially involved side-mission 
where you can manage a cat café.
enTer THe Dragon
But that’s not to say Kamurocho welcomes 
Kazuma back with open arms. A Chinese 
Triad is moving in on the Tojo clan’s home 
turf, pushing things precariously close to 
all-out war, and the Triad members make 
it crystal clear early on that they have 
absolutely no interest in peace. They’re 
targeting Yakuza and grey-area civilians 
alike without provocation, and Kazuma 
soon finds himself in a spot of bother with 
the Chinese gangsters. As always, you’ll 
have to fight to achieve your aims.
Combat has been streamlined and 
refocussed. Gone are earlier entries’ 
multiple fighting styles and in its place is 
a singular versatile stance that proves Kazuma is 
remarkably spry for a gentleman approaching 50. 
Landing strikes successfully builds up Heat, filling 
up orbs that can be consumed by pressing i. A tap 
of this shoulder button triggers Extreme Heat mode 
and awakens the Dragon Of Dojima. Bursting into 
blue flames, Kazuma’s attacks consume Heat as they 
devour his enemies’ health. Pain also no longer fazes 
Kazuma, and you can trigger visceral finishing blows 
via QTE, making him unstoppable. What’s more, 
some weapons, such as sledgehammers, are only 
usable when you’re blazing blue.
It’s not just the Triad on Kazuma’s back either. 
Lesser thugs and fellow Yakuza alike will chase him 
down on sight. There are a lot of these roving groups 
about, though they are helpfully indicated on your 
minimap and overview so you can avoid them if 
you’d rather they didn’t catch you in a compromising 
position between restaurant pit-stops. A few key 
street encounters still confine Kazuma to a makeshift 
mini-arena blocked off by pedestrians, but now it’s 
far easier to run away from bust-ups. Not that you 
would flee like that… right?
As a send-off to a much beloved character, Song 
Of Life is shaping up to be a suitable closing refrain 
for Kazuma Kiryu.

however, with alternative tasks 
involving hunting wildlife (toxic bears)

When we do need to rely on our 
trigger finger to push back against the 
Seeds, the action is as freeform as the 
rest of the game is varied. Enemies 
behave in natural ways – some run at 
us with baseball bats, others duck for 
cover, and individuals may even give 
up and make a break for it. Mixing 
machine guns, a bow and arrow, melee 
attacks, and explosives, we’re never 
short of a violent solution to whatever 
the AI throws our way. 
Just as Sunrise Farm offered 
destructible fruit and veg to sell the

stacked crates all demand to be

eye-catching explosions.

help shooting the things; every pumpkin erupted 
with a satisfying sploosh. That we came a step 
closer to bringing down the Father, all the better. 
Our latest hands-on with Far Cry 5 reveals how 
loose this sandbox shooter’s structure really 
is. Sunrise Farm is just one of many Hope 
County locations overrun by Project At 
Eden’s Gate doomsday cultists, and retaking 
the site eats into the cult’s control over the 
area. The more strongholds we take, the 
closer we get to challenging the region’s 
leader – in this case John Seed.
Whittling down John’s control is more 
organic than simply tagging a location 
on the map and mopping up. The county 
is a living space, and our time in the 
wilds offers countless opportunities to 
get one over on the Seeds. A passing van 
of soon-to-be-converted is a chance to 
free the non-believers; a roadside heist 
an opportunity to save a civilian; a man 
being assaulted by an angry bald eagle – well he’s 
on his own. Each interaction spawns new leads, and 
opportunities to disrupt the Seeds’ hold on Hope 
County, often down the barrel of a gun.

TT Isle of Man: RIde on The edge
Taking realistic racing to the manx
 
When a game’s biggest draw is that it 
contains more corners than any other 
racing game (264 turns on 61km of 
road) you know you’re getting your 
hands on a serious simulation. And on occasion 
it’s good to drop the arcade sensibilities and test 
your skills against an unforgiving racer. 
Boasting the official riders and superbikes to take 
into those 264 turns, TT Isle Of Man: Ride On The 
Edge puts its licensed body where its bravado is – 
realism is at the game’s beating, oily heart. Each bike 
has been accurately recreated from the real-world 
machines using lidar scanning, photogrammetry, 
and other techy terms sent to baffle us. (The 
developer has even recorded the sound of rushing 
air to replicate the sense of speed the real riders 
experience.) The upshot is every detail is included, 
down to the smallest rivet and scratch. And with 38 
bikes and sidecars to test your skills on and against, 
there’s a solid challenge to be had.
The real thrill of TT Isle Of Man, however, will 
always come from experiencing those classic corners 
– considered the toughest road course of all the 
world’s GP circuits. Just like the bikes, the dev has 
modelled a lifelike version of the famous Snaefell 
Mountain Course, which has claimed 255 lives since 
leather-clad motor-jockeys decided it was a great 
idea to shoot around it as fast as possible.
Isle be TheRe 
If you are going to tackle such a dangerous course, 
even in a videogame, then you’ll want to do so 
knowing your superbike is fit for the job. TT Isle 
Of Man’s career mode offers you the 
chance to fine-tune your bikes and 
build a garage of powerful machines 
capable of propelling you to the 
podium. Just like the real-world 
competition, the game’s career mode 
includes a mixture of training and 
qualifying rounds across 10 different 
tracks to ensure only the best riders 
make it to the starting grid. 
If you find the game’s AI a pushover 
– even when you’re rocketing 
through narrow village streets and 
scraping your virtual knees around 
mountainous bends at 190mph – then 
the eight-player online races will be 
sure to test your nerves.
With only Bandai Namco’s Project 
Cars series offering a strict simulation 
of racing, and few touching on two-
wheeled competition, TT Isle Of 
Man’s devotion to realism impresses. 
It may have cornered the market.

this unique-looking low-poly indie is

obsessed future where androids demand 
equal rights and humanity is threatened by the 
rise in AI, an oppressive surveillance state, and 
dwindling natural resources. 
For many in State Of Mind’s 2048 Berlin the answer 
to these problems is to retreat inside the virtual 
world of CITY 5 through advanced ‘mind transfer’. 
Journalist Richard Nolan is among them, but 
something goes wrong and he now exists in both 
places at once… oh, and his family has vanished.
Kai Fiebig, production lead for the neo-noir 
thriller, describes Nolan as a tech sceptic. “He is 
questioning the way technology has taken over so 
much of our daily lives in 2048. At the same time it 
is exactly that kind of technology he has to rely on 
in order to find out what happened to his family. He 
is torn between both worlds, and that conflict is an 
important aspect of the game.”
Much of State Of Mind’s gameplay is taken up 
with investigating the two cities – virtual and real 
– and clues uncovered, as well as dialogue choices 
made, will affect both worlds. A choice-driven 
narrative adventure with a message? There’s a lot to 
love here. Even the low-fi style is feels fresh. A rival

battalion 1944
V for vintage
 
Do your eyes get dewy when you 
remember the good old days of gaming’s 
past glories? When a floating hand 
grasping a gun was considered a well-
rounded hero? Then this FPS, which recalls the 
close-combat challenge of ’90s shooters, could be 
your call to arms. 
Light on a single-player campaign, this multiplayer-
focused blast will rekindle your love of running and 
gunning. Whereas Activision spotted a gap in the 
market for a new World War 2 game, UK developer 
Bulkhead spied a need for an FPS that feels like the 
classic WW2 shooters of old. Capturing the emotion 
of playing this style of game is actually a big part 
of Battalion 1944’s appeal. That means including 
strafe jumping (an exploited bug in the PC version 
of Call Of Duty 2), and replicating the eager recoil 
of weapons from those ’90s shooters. That’s right, 
Battalion 1944 is a game built around imperfection, 
and we love it even more for being so.
 Recall of duty 
Spread across six game modes, including Team 
Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, and Domination,  
the game is set to be an online draw. But to drag  
you away from COD: WWII it will 
need some ideas that stretch beyond  
a nostalgic me-too love letter to 
big-name games. To that end, it’s got 
some interesting takes on the genre. 
For example, the BattleRank system 
will reward head shots but also punish 
you for missing a target. Its points 
rewards stretch to team ranking too; 
as well as being graded for individual 
performances you will be scored on 
your role, for instance as a medic, 
helping your squad rise through the 
ten planned online leagues.
New game mode Wartide hints 
at an Overwatch influence, with 
gameplay restrictions occurring over a 
five-round match to keep you on your 
toes. For example, weapon types could 
be locked out or reduced as you play. 
You may start a match with unlimited 
sniper rifle drops but soon find they’re 
limited to five as rounds progress.
Pitched as a callback to simpler 
times, Battalion 1944 could be more 
than just another retro retread.

Originally manga, then anime, My Hero 
Academia is now coming to PlayStation, 
albeit with a slight name change. Hero 
Izuku Midoriya is born without special 
abilities – but in his world superpowers, or 
Quirks, are the norm. Bullied for being different, 
he proves himself and is bestowed with a Quirk of 
his own by the world’s greatest hero, his idol, All 
Might. Izuku’s then sent to a hero training school. 
Gameplay details are thin, but it’s fair to say be 
you’ll be throwing more than a few punches.
The central conflict within the world of the My Hero 
Adacemia anime is the fight between users of the 
Quirks All For One and One For All. One For All is a 
transferable power used by a long line of heroes, with 
Izuku being its ninth wielder. He’s able to stockpile 
energy within his body and unleash it as a variety of 
devastating moves. One’s Justice showcases Izuku’s 
powers with a variety of destructible stages. From 
cracking concrete to whacking walls to bashing 
buildings, you’ll be able to tear it up in the city.
Footage shown at the game’s Paris reveal doesn’t 
feature the other side of the quirky coin directly 
but it does demo a showdown between Izuku and 
Tomura Shigaraki, the villain next in line to succeed 
the man in possession of the Quirk-stealing power 
All For One. When it comes to anime games, we 
relish every opportunity to fight the good fight. 
We’d guess that his punch 
has had an impact…

“while the game

Translating tabletop RPG games to 
console has always been a tough ask. 
The wealth of complex systems and 
labyrinthine lore of Warhammer’s Old 
World is enough to give any dev cold sweats. 
Fatshark’s response was to push it all aside and 
use the license as an excuse to create a fun, 
frenetic, and, frankly, bloody co-op FPS.
Well, FPS is a stretch. The original Vermintide 
focused on melee combat – “it has one of the best 
FPS melee mechanics there is,” says Mats Andersson, 
executive producer – and asked you to dismember 
the rat-like Skaven across a series of horde missions.
The sequel will again feature five main characters, 
including the Witch Hunter, Zealot, and Bounty 
Hunter, but now each hero can be developed across 
15 career choices to offer more combat variety. 
While the game is melee-focused, there’s a blend of 
playstyles on offer; for example the Witch Hunter 
slices and dices with a rapier but can use a pistol to 
pick off distant enemies. 
A new Heroic Deeds system offers loot items 
to spice up hosted games by altering the levels, 
but don’t expect to cough up cash to earn them. 
“We don’t want to have pay-to-win loot boxes in 
Vermintide 2”, says Andersson. 
There will be a greater 
focus on offline play for 
the sequel, with improved 
enemy AI and missions.

sensibility, familiar JRPG trappings 
abounded in Ni No Kuni: Wrath Of 
The White Witch. But alongside these the sequel 
introduces new twists on the winning formula.
Taking place hundreds of years after the first game, 
centring on a distant descendant of its predecessor’s 
cast, this feels much more like a spiritual successor 
than a direct follow-up. You play as Evan, the 
many-times-great-grandson of portly moggy King 
Tom Tildrum from the first game. Evan is far more 
human-like than his ancestor, and is set to ascend

feels like the biggest and clearest departure from 
what came before.
Before heading out into battle, you can survey the 
field, inspect the forces facing off and decide how to 
bolster your royal regiment. There are a number of 
boosts for your army and debuffs for the opposition 
to choose from. You can also muster forces, choosing 
up to four unique units alongside your regular 
regiment. They’ll provide a variety of support 
abilities, called Special Tactics, that are accessible via 
i and then mapped to the face buttons.
Battle proper features real-time strategy elements 
with combat that operates on a rock-paper-scissors 
principle. Red units prefer the blade and have an 
advantage over the green hammer men, who in 
turn are strong against blue pikemen. You can cycle 
between which you want as your front line by 
holding down u or o. As you fight, you need to 
protect your command posts alongside defeating 
enemy units. If your posts are all destroyed, it’s 
Game Over even if your units are still standing. 
Scattered across the battlefield are green orbs of 
health, though you’ll need to pace yourself as these 
did not appear to respawn in the build we played. 
They present a fair challenge. We stare down 
a few Game Over screens in our time with this 
mode, especially as it turns out that different enemy 
armies can band together and form alliances 
against us. While we already know that the 
companion kingdom management mode 
will aid us by giving us things like access

what will happen if you lose one too many

On the overworld map, as in kingdom 
battles, Evan and co are represented in 
adorable chibi form. As you adventure you’ll 
encounter a breadcrumb trail of glittering 
gold guiding the way, plus tucked-away 
chests and monsters on the map. Characters 
return to their full-sized selves in certain 
hub areas, such as the sky pirate village and 
a later cave section, as well as in combat. Fights take 
place in an enclosed arena where the action becomes 
a chaotic, real time run-in. Many of the beasties we 
encounter happily hover just out of Evan’s reach, 
making Roland’s gun, Tani’s bow, and the Higgledies’ 
magic instrumental in knocking them down and 
levelling the playing field.
The adorable Higgledies, tripping over tree roots 
or getting knocked over if Evan walks by them too 
briskly, provide vital defensive and offensive support 
in battle. During one boss fight (with a creature 
under the memorable moniker of ‘Butcher, Baker, 
Kingmaker’), we find critters of the same element 
are able to shield the party from the baddie’s most 
powerful attack. Alongside the Higgledies’ magic, 
character-specific spells are accessible via i and 
then mapped to the face buttons. Towards the end of 
a boss showdown, a mysterious gold orb materialises. 
Our party members urge us to walk into it, and when 
we do it gives us a temporary offensive boost that 
makes short work of whatever is left standing.
While a cat may look at a king, it remains to be 
seen whether he could become the king of JRPGs. 
There’s an impressive amount of variety here and 
we’re looking forward to seeing how Revenant 
Kingdom pulls it all together later this year.

ike Kratos, we’ve been on a 
journey to get here. To the point 
where God Of War is inching its 
way slowly towards our 
PlayStation 4. From past E3 
reveals that demanded we tease 
info out of emotive trailers, to 
sitting down with game director 
Cory Barlog for an extended 
interview back in issue 140, 
details of what to expect from 
Kratos’ comeback have been 
buzzing around for months. Now, 
close to its 20 April release, we 
bring together the key info and 
new details of how this soft 
reboot of God Of War plays. 
Times have changed since God Of 
War burst onto PlayStation 2. It’s 
been 13 years since Kratos tore 
off heads, gouged eyes, toppled 
the gods of Greek myths, and 
found time to fit in an 
orgy or two – all of which gory fun 
passed for mature gaming over a 
decade ago. Now we expect more 
from our games. 
God Of War remains a mature 
experience, but now its maturity is 
expressed by the way the lead 
character has realistic needs and 
aspirations – Kratos is protector to 
his son Atreus, harnessing the rage 
that brought the downfall of the 
Greek gods to teach his son life 
lessons, as they quest to return his 
mother’s ashes to the ‘highest peak 
in the realms’. Along the way you 
will bond with the boy, teaching 
him to hunt and fight. There’s a 
suggestion that you will ultimately 
decide Atreus’ fate through your 
actions in the game, making him a 
chip off the old rage-block or 
something else… The most recent 
trailer alludes to this inner turmoil, 
revealing the godly blood in his 
veins, and Kratos’ violent past, will 
make him sick – unless, perhaps, 
he embraces this ‘dark side’ of his 
demigod ancestry. 
The adoption of the weighty 
themes of fatherhood meant Sony 
Santa Monica chose to switch the 
action to a closer third-person 
camera, one that pulls us into 
Kratos’ world. We sit over the 
demigod’s shoulder and experience 
his journey on a personal level. 
This, coupled with a slower, 
more intimate take on 
storytelling, came from a 
desire to create a game that 
will emotionally challenge 
players with relatable 
characters who are more 
than tools of destruction.
This one decision 
affects everything, 
changing God Of War 
from a combo-juggling 
melee brawler into a more 
methodical and considered 
adventure game.
The change to God Of 
War’s camera is the 
prime reason Kratos carries an axe 
and not the Blades Of Chaos. The 
axe is seen by the developers as a 
realistic ‘physical’ weapon, more 
personal even, one that encourages 
enemies to come in close. If you’re 
coming into PlayStation 4’s God Of 
War expecting the button-mashing 
devastation last seen in the PS2 and 
PS3 outings, then check your 
preconceptions at the cave entrance.
  
Hard Scandi  
This new God Of War features 
more cautious combat. Whereas in 
past games you would have hit 
buttons to swing the Blades Of 
Chaos and catch multiple enemies 
in its cutting arc, now you need to 
think tactically. The new combat 
system is based around prioritising 
enemies, targeting the main threats 
and hammering weaknesses.
Extending Kratos’ move-set, you 
can also use Atreus’ nifty bow skills 
to mop up the dregs 
from a distance, or set 
them up for you to 
knock down.
There’s a rock-
paper-scissors 
approach to the 
combat; you need to 
recognise an enemy, 
and their tactics, and react 
accordingly. Some, for example, 
can’t be harmed by Kratos’ axe. 
Others won’t be stunned by Atreus’ 
arrow flurries. Some foes can’t be 
staggered, they just keep coming at 
you. Taking into account the close 
camera and reliance on countering 
and blocking moves, the phrase 
‘Souls-alike’ trips off our keyboard.
Given this new slower direction, 
button-mashing chaotic combos are 
“god of war has 
become something 
more methodical 
and considered.”

opportunities to spruce up your gear. 
Weapons and armour can be

Barlog previously we’d suggest this is 
done by taking runes to the dwarven 
brothers Brokk and Sindri, who will 
hammer them into place and imbue 
Leviathan and Kratos’ shield with new 
abilities for both light and heavy 
attacks. Everything is contextual and 
kept in the game’s world.  
The crafting setup goes further, as it 
was recently revealed you’ll be able to 
create different types of armour, and 
that all armour upgrades and skill 
unlocks will apply to both Kratos and 
Atreus, not just one of them.

as well as helping Kratos tackle 
enemies, atreus shouts out to 
warn you of impending dangers 
and offers useful hints.
T
here’s always been a question 
mark or two over just how 
Atreus, Kratos’ son and partner 
in death-dealing, will fit into the 
classic God Of War combo template. 
We caught a glimpse of the over-
excitable killer child in a recent 
demo where the kid leapt to his pa’s 
side, called out danger, and delivered 
a final blow or two. 
Now we know more precise details. 
Atreus is essentially an extension of 
Kratos’ combo set, and by pressing r 
he can be sent off to attack enemies 
while you get down to business on the 
battle’s bigger brutes. 
If you choose to let the lad do his 
own thing without direction he’ll aid 
you by raining down arrows onto 
enemies and increasing their ‘stun 
meter’. Once staggered you can tidy up 
the dregs by getting Kratos to tear 
them apart with his bare hands or 
weaponising them – one enemy you 
face, when attacked in a stunned state, 
will create an area-of-effect attack that 
will impact on any creature in your 
vicinity, hurling them into the air.

out in God Of War. Instead fights 
need to be managed. Key to this is 
using Leviathan’s ‘freeze’ ability – 
when thrown the axe will stall and 
stagger enemies it hits, giving you 
time to fight closer threats while 
keeping others at bay. So while the 
blazing arcs of the Blades Of Chaos 
(and similar weapons, such as the 
Blades Of Athena and Blades Of 
Exile) from past games are gone, 
there’s a call back to the series’ 
heritage in how Leviathan can be 
used, mixing wide throwing arcs 
with close-up hacking. 
In keeping with the series’ 
combo heritage you’ll also need 
to hit a button to call the axe 
back to Kratos in a move 
reminiscent of Marvel’s Thor. 
Add in Kratos’ new shield, 
which is used to parry and 
melee strike beasties that 
get too close, and there’s a 
rhythm to the flow of 
the button 
presses that 
recalls the 
combo strings of past games, 
but done so in methodical 
patterns that eschews any 
need to button-bash. There 
needs to be more purpose 
to your presses now.
Pulling the camera close 
to Kratos when in combat also 
caused its own problems in 
development. For example, the 
situational awareness you got from 
the original God Of War camera – 
being able to see which particular 
enemies were lining up to hurt you, 
and where future attacks were 
coming from – is completely lost 
in this soft reboot. It’s why Atreus 
can be heard eagerly shouting 
directions to his pa as he pummels 
faces – Kratos’ son is your 
new information and insights, to 
expand the narrative and discover 
new combat encounters.
SeaS tHe day
Helping you navigate the game’s 
open-ish world are boats. Where 
appropriate, these can be found  
and used to paddle to areas off 
limits to a (now) non-swimmer  
like old man Kratos. 
It’s been stated by Barlog that 
we’ll spend around 30% of our 
game time in these boats, which 
suggests they’ll be more than a 
mode of travel. Having Kratos and 
Atreus confined to a small space 
offers a lot of exposition time for 
the pair, so expect tugs 
on the feels as you 
slowly journey towards 
new locations.
Speaking of the 
game’s environments, 
these aren’t static 
dioramas or blank 
canvases for your 
Jackson Pollock bloodgasms. The 
scenery and surrounding settings in 
God Of War can be used in combat 
to gain the upper hand – such as 
hurling Leviathan at hanging pots of 
molten liquid, tipping the burning 
fuel onto your grouped enemies 
– ensuring you have multiple ways 
to overcome an enemy.  
Fights will naturally be a focus of 
God Of War, even with Kratos’ new 
caring-sharing parental attitude. 
Despite everything weighing down 
to suggest this God Of War lives by 
real-world rules, we’re still playing 
an immortal demigod with the 
power to destroy deities – and he’ll 
be taking on some of the giants of 
Nordic mythology. Grounded, yes. 
An over-the-top circus of god-
bothering violence, absolutely. 
off-screen eyes, calling out threats 
you’re unable to see.
Bald men can’t jump
The close camera and desire to 
ensure everything in God Of War is 
contextual and grounded in realism 
has led to major changes to how 
Kratos gets around this new, icy 
Nordic world. There’s no jump 
button. Or swimming ability. Let 
that sink in for a minute. A God Of 
War adventure derailed from its 
platforming past could feel… 
lacking. But while past games 
in the series encouraged 
exploration they rarely let 
you off the chain to 
wander freely. To mitigate 
any feeling 
that Kratos is 
hamstrung by a 
lack of mobility, 
Barlog’s team has 
ensured side-quests 
have been added to God Of 
War – though they’re not 
labelled as such. 
In a way, by removing 
jumping and swimming 
Santa Monica Studio has 
been able to expand the 
discoverable world. While the game 
is still a linear action experience, 
you’ll be able to venture off the 
critical story path and complete 
smaller objectives. Celebrating 
curiosity, you’ll be encouraged to 
search the environments, with the 
aim of developing Kratos as a 
character, to progress the story and 
put flesh on this new world’s bones.
Again, the decision to limit 
Kratos’ movement partly came 
about because of the close-in 
camera, but it’s also because the 
team pinned this new God Of War 
to three key pillars: narrative, 
exploration, and combat. So while 
you won’t jump into this snowy 
world and see a hundred icons ping 
across the screen, you will be 
coaxed into investigating to uncover 
“you will be 
coaxed into 
investigating  
the world.”

T
ransporting Kratos to a 
Scandinavian setting has given 
the developer the much-needed 
freedom to explore a true 
PlayStation icon and reinvent how 
we play God Of War. 
The knock-on effect of unshackling 
the series from its Ancient Greek 
roots means future instalments could 
look very different, with Cory Barlog 
telling US website Game Informer 
new titles in the cannon could take 
Gaming’s Angriest Man™ to new 
ancient worlds, with the dev hinting 
at the Mayan and Egyptian eras 
bearing the brunt of the beard’s wrath.

pantheons, will atreus go

H
e’s been dead for 80 years, 
but HP Lovecraft is still 
influencing other horror 
creators. His impact can be 
seen in everything from 
Silent Hill to Hideo 
Kojima’s forthcoming Death 
Stranding. But translating 
his stories to videogames 
has proved as elusive and 
slippery as the The Great Old One itself.
It’s why Cyanide’s take on the lore is looking 
so good: based on the pen-and-paper RPG, 
it’s got its roots in an already-successful game 
using the complex mythos. Cyanide’s lead level 
designer, Romain Wiart, explains how anxiety 
and terror, solving puzzles, and choices drive 
the action, not gunplay. He tells us how the 
tabletop game has inspired but not dictated the 
videogame, and touches on the insanity system 
that determines how you progress, and how 
your Cthulhu journey unravels and ends.
OPM: Did the tabletop RPG help or hinder 
developing this game? 
Romain Wiart: We can make the adaptation as 
we wish, so it did not hinder us at all. With the 
tabletop RPGs, if there’s a system we don’t like 
we improve it or change it or even remove it if 
it’s not serving the game.
OPM: What did you learn from the previous 
attempt to make a Cthulhu videogame? While 
good, the PC title became a shooting gallery…
RW: At the end of the game, yeah. In fact, it’s 
an interpretation of how you can fight in the 
Lovecraft novel and in the pen-and-paper

the ending, whether you will have some choices or not and whether you 
will experience things or not. That’s how it works. At the end of the 
game you have several endings, but if your insanity grows you have less 
endings, less options because your character can’t make rational choices.
OPM: Do you only have certain phobias in the game or can you be phobic 
of everything and anything all at once?
RW: You can have all the phobias. Yeah, you can experience all of them. 
Not at once, every setting of the area triggers one phobia at a time. So 
you can go, “Okay, I see the entrance space – no, I won’t go there, I’ll 
RPG. It’s not a good choice, so we want to 
offer more exploration, you have to think, and 
when you are confronted you have to find a way 
to beat that, but your guns are not really that 
good, in fact. Maybe, sometimes, it will buy you 
a few moments, but it’s not the way of escaping 
or winning… if you can win at all, of course.
OPM: When you’re facing a game based on such 
popular writing, is that another challenge?
RW: Yeah, it’s a challenge for us, because 
Lovecraft is so popular, of course. We wanted 
to offer the same experience as the novel, we 
wanted a strong story, and for that we hired 
Mark Morrison, maybe you have heard of him? 
He’s a renowned writer of the pen-and-paper 
RPGs. So, he wrote, for us, a very strong story, 
an original one. Of course, the inspiration is 
there, but that’s how we focused on the story. 
OPM: Why do you think Cthulhu has lasted so 
long? Why do you think people keep being 
inspired by it for other games?
RW: I think because the myth is really open. 
Lovecraft didn’t specify every aspect of his 
mythology, some things are quite vague, like 
the origin of the divinity himself. So everyone 
can grab this mythology and make it their own. 
Many also continue his works, as well as we do. 
I think it’s because there’s room to interpret; 
some will be more faithful, some will be more 
extravagant, but I think every way is good. 
It’s fun to explore and people make the myth 
richer. I think that’s why it’s still alive today.
OPM: So, how does the sanity mechanic work?
RW: It’s very simple. As in the novel or in the 
pen-and-paper RPG, your sanity will go down, 
so this will be the case in the game. So, the 
only control you have over it is a little gap of 
‘sanity’. The better you manage it, by making 
the right choices, the higher your sanity will 
be, you will remain in control of your will at 
the end of the game, so it will mainly affect 
you are 
plunged into  
a dystopian 
environment, you 
don’t know what 
is real or not at 
some points.

phobias, apparently. Let’s

choose this because I prefer not to have a 
reminder of what happened before.”
OPM: As you go through the game, do those 
choices you make just affect the ending?
RW: It affects the ending, but also some parts 
of the game. During missions you can’t access 
certain paths because of your stamina creation, 
your skills, and your way of doing things. Your 
choices open ways and close others. 
OPM: Can you backtrack?
RW: No, it’s going forward, but it depends on 
which way you choose.
OPM: So lots of replayability?
RW: You can replay to find other ways, but  
you will experience the same story. It’s more 
the way you play because there are other  
things to discover. 
OPM: Is there a really quick way, a speedrun?
RW: I don’t think there is a speedrun, because some of the action you do, 
like sneaking and escaping, I don’t think you can really speed. Of course, 
you can take shortcuts, but you can’t discover everything, so you can’t 
know what’s a good choice, you have to explore to know what’s a good 
choice and make decisions, like, “Okay, this is a good choice. I have more 
information, so I don’t take too much risk.”
OPM: Do you reward players more for taking risks?
RW: Yeah. You get more information or better relations with the other 
characters if you take risks. You can say, “I can talk to him about this. 
Okay, good choice, I’ll go do this.” That’s how we are rewarding the player.
OPM: When you’re making horror games, are there rules for horror that 
only work in games as opposed to film or books. Is this a shock horror?
RW: No, it’s more psychological horror. So, you are plunged into a 
dystopian environment, you don’t know what is real or not at some 
points. This is more the Lovecraftian lore, it’s not like there are monsters 
everywhere. It’s really discovering what Lovecraft wanted to convey 
through his stories, like, “There is a whole universe apart of our world as 
we know it, and so discovery of this will drive me to madness”. So the 
pace of the horror will go out through the game 
as you discover more of that ‘real truth’.
OPM: As graphics get better is it easier to 
make horror or does it offer other problems?
RW: No, I think it’s better to have better 
graphics because you can play with many things 
like visual effects, sound effects, and the player 
will have an experience that’s more disturbing, 
so yeah, it’s good to have. 
OPM: Have you thought about VR?
RW: We had a discussion with some publishers 
about VR, but our studio is not really 
experienced in that kind of technology, we 
prefer to make something we know about, so it 
won’t be in VR.
OPM: How long is the game? 
RW: If you go through the main way of doing it, 
about 12 to 15 hours, but there are many things 
to do, so it can be longer than that.
 
OPM: Do you think players are going to have fun 
playing in the most extreme ways in the game?
RW: That is something we are discussing. There 
is some ending or some choice you know will 
trigger something bad for the character, but 
you’re like, “Okay, I want to see this!” So, yeah, 
the player will voluntarily choose, “I will accept 
the deal, I want to know more, I know it will 
cost me sanity, but I want to experience this.
 
OPM: Do you think horror fans enjoy watching 
their character suffer in that way?
RW: I don’t think the player wants the  
character to suffer, but they want to experience 
what they see. I don’t think they really care 
about the character at this moment, they just 
want to see what happens. Maybe there’s some 
curiosity that pushes you to go, “I want to go 
through that door.”

Shape Of The World
Objectives are the bread and butter of 
any game. Go there, do that, well done. 
So there’s something intoxicating about 
the idea of an experience that plonks 
you into a world and says nothing more 
than “Relax and enjoy.”
Shape Of The World is a stylish 
first-person exploration sim where your 
only aim is to wander, swim, or fly 
through and interact with the striking 
environments you find yourself in. 
Procedural generation means the world 
builds itself around your journey and 
there are plenty of arresting sights, from 
flying whales to peculiar flora that 
grows around you. Playing with them 
can refashion the world in unexpected 
ways, which is a worthy endeavour 
considering how lush the art style is. 
The dynamic score for the game is 
built with a similar aim; it’ll react to 
what you do as you venture further 
afield. This looks like the antidote to 
the hustle and bustle of other games.

scroll across the screen, and alternately reveal the 
lands of the living and the dead. This provides 
unique challenges, such as enemies being able to 
attack you in one wave, but not the other. By the 
time we get to the boss fight, it’s an impressive mix 
of satisfying combat and reflex-testing platforming 
as el muñeco lobs a flock of chickens at us. Yeah, he

our first hands-on with the followup to one of the 
best (and most demanding) platformers of the 
modern era is exactly what we want from meat Boy: 
thumb-achingly precise timing, horrific instruments 
that will churn us into gristle, and a cartoon art 
style that makes all the torture worthwhile. 
we’re making our way through a few levels in 
green Hills and the move to an auto-running system 
feels like a perfect fit. Although you only have two 
buttons – one for jumping and punching, one for 
diving and sliding – levels remain addictively 
challenging. Part of that is down to the fair 
checkpointing and instant restarts when you die. 
But it’s mainly because of how smooth meat Boy is. 
He’s speedy without being too fast, so you quickly 
get used to the arc of his jumps, yet getting 
through a particularly tricky chunk still leaves you 
feeling like a nimble ninja.

Wattam
To sum up the smile-inducing lunacy  
of this is simple. At one stage during 
our hands-on, we’ve made nearly every 
friend we’ve come across into… well, a 
poo. And how we did it, by taking 
control of a giant mouth and cheerfully 
gobbling up any characters we saw, 
almost seems logical. 
Like Katamari Damacy (whose creator, 
Keita Takahashi, is working on this as a 
designer), Wattam takes a surreal idea 
and follows it wherever it goes. In our 
demo, we take control of The Mayor 
and other characters who are with him 
to lure even more to the giant green 
field we’re playing on. For instance, we 
get The Mayor and his colourful 
anthropomorphised buddies to link 
hands around an acorn, before running 
around it. When they do, it brings a 
giant tree shooting out of the ground. 
When you possess the tree, you can eat 
up everyone around you to turn them 
into fruit, which then entices a giant 
mouth back to our world and… hey, 
we’ve come full circle! We’re retiring 
the phrase “weird and wonderful”, 
because only Wattam deserves it now.

Donut County
The idea of a giant hole opening up and 
swallowing an entire city whole is no 
longer the domain of your dreams/
nightmares. This wonderfully surreal 
puzzler sees you take control of a hole 
in the ground that grows bigger as you 
start to vacuum up objects in its cute 
pastoral world. 
Our hands-on focuses on terrorising 
a family of foxes in their home. Our 
hole first devours rocks and pots, before 
moving onto much bigger items. What 
keeps the recurrent action fresh is the 
environmental effects you trigger inside 
the hole. For instance, when a kiln slips 
into the hole, it starts puffing out 
smoke. This can then affect other items 
in the level… like the hot air balloon a 
child fox is hiding inside. We can’t help 
feeling guilty as we watch him float off 
into the sky. Sorry mate.
There’s an almost relaxing quality 
here, as you watch a messy environment 
tumble into a dark abyss, and with a 
hilariously dark streak running behind 
all of your world-demolishing actions, 
Donut County should be just as 
delicious as its namesake.

Flipping Death
expect a busy year for Zoink, which not only has the 
adorable Fe hitting PS4 in Februrary, but the dev 
also has this hilarious platform-puzzler – which 
gives us a look at what it’s like covering for the 
grimmy reaps while he’s on holiday. 
A huge part of the appeal is getting to grips with 
the game’s flipping system. You can switch between 
the map in the afterlife and, er, life by possessing 
people who exist in the other world. The rub comes 
from the unique abilities the living have – and you’ll 
have when you possess them. one person loves to 
poke things, for example, while a dentist has access 
to a drill that can create holes in objects. 
Discovering who does what and how that’ll be 
useful in the alive side is excellent fun. 
okay, a game that loves a pun is always going to 
capture Team oPm’s hearts, but we reckon this is 
the best use of Death since Bill & Ted.

The Church In  
The Darkness
in this top-down adventure you play as vic, a man 
infiltrating ‘Freedom Town’, the South American 
stronghold of a cult called Collective Justice 
mission, to find his nephew Alex. 
Playing like an isometric Hitman, you have the 
freedom to choose your approach. our hands-on 
gives us a chance to see both sides of the action. 
we start by sneaking up behind a guard and 
knocking him out, hiding his body in a crate. we end 
it by being gunned down after trying to race past a 
patrolling guard. Sneaking looks like the wiser option. 
what intrigues us is the procedural generation. 
every time you start a new game, the cult’s 
intentions will shift, so sometimes the members are 
dangerous and at others they’re less of a threat. 
That extra layer of strategy to the sneaking has us 
praying to get hold of the full game.

The Gardens between
in this fascinating and stylish puzzler, you’re 
watching the adventures of Arina and Frendt as 
they navigate across dreamlike garden islands. why 
not play as them? well, in The gardens Between, 
you control time rather than the characters. As a 
hook for a puzzle game, it’s a strong one. You need 
to learn how to manipulate the environment by 
moving time forward and backward. 
our demo shows just how versatile this 
mechanic can be. on one island, a path is blocked by 
a saw stuck in a plank of wood. while Arina’s first 
bounce on the saw does nothing, jumping on it 
repeatedly makes it break off, creating a new path 
for the pair to follow. later on, more complex 
puzzles introduce new elements, like balls of light, 
you’ll use to get past obstacles. nothing here is too 
frustrating, but there’s enough logic required that 
solutions feel well-earned. Consider us ready to 
take another trip back to the gardens. 
Just Shapes and beats
if you’re a long-time oPm reader, we know you’re 
thinking, “Hey, wasn’t this meant to be out in 2017?” 
Yep, we even made it one of our most-anticipated 
indies. But as you can tell from it being here, it 
didn’t manage to land on PlayStation last year.
well, trust us, you’ll be glad when this bullet-hell-
meets-rhythm-action bonanza of fun lands. The title 
is as clear as possible. This is a game where you, a 
shape, try to avoid other shapes that appear in time 
with the beat by whizzing across the screen. if an 
area is pink, you do not want to be near it. 
if you think that might be a little too simplistic, 
then wait till you see it in action. relentless beats 
and flashes of shapes that are large, small, and 
everything in between light up the screen, pushing 
your reactions to the (thumb) breaking point. 
Fortunately, the fantastic music and four-player 
co-op make this an uncomplicated beauty.

in Cornwall during

Our co-op

lets us play through a level 
where we’re trying to break into a 
scrapyard, using the duo’s wits 
and fighting skills. What enchants us are 
the little touches we see throughout. We 
can hug a goose (is that ever a good idea?) 
with a tap of e. One puzzle, where we 
move scrap metal to clear a doorway, has 
three huge letters: M, U, B. You can pick 
them up and rearrange them to spell 
out a funnier-than-it-should-
be word. The final fight of the 
demo has squiggly line drawings of 
dragons over a car crusher, showing what 
Nessa and Demelza are seeing in their 
imagination. If the full game contains even 
half the heart of this demo, it’ll be

untitled Goose Game
First things first, there’s no confirmation 
that Untitled Goose Game is coming to 
PlayStation 4, though we’re hopeful that 
it will, especially considering that 
House House’s last game Push Me, Pull 
You made it to Sony’s console. 
However, we couldn’t resist not 
including this hilarious-looking gem. 
Footage we see shows you playing as an 
antagonistic goose, whose sole purpose 
appears to be bullying anyone they 
come across by solving environmental 
puzzles. In this instance, it’s a 
groundskeeper tending to his garden, 
which has a locked gate to keep any 
annoying birds out. 
We see the goose get his attention by 
picking up a radio and playing music, 
forcing the groundskeeper to chase him. 
Once into the garden, the goose hides in 
shrubs, pinches keys, and generally 
makes a nuisance of itself. With a 
fetching minimalist art style and 
buckets of humour, we’re crossing 
everything in the hopes that it’ll land 
on PlayStation 4.

Yoku’s Island Express
This cutesy platformer mixes a rayman legends-
esque hand-drawn art style with a pinball twist. You 
play as the titular Yoku, a dung beetle who is moving 
to mokumana island to become a postman. Yoku 
might always be rolling a ball around, but fortunately 
for him, mokumana has a whole host of bumpers 
and flippers to fling him across the landscape, so he 
can solve puzzles and explore to his heart’s content. 
it’s surprising just how fluid this system is, with 
the pinball physics adding an element of 
unpredictability to exploring the lush environments. 
And there’ll be plenty to discover, with a large, 
nonlinear world where you can pick your own path, 
along with new abilities you’ll unlock as you go. 
if the vibrant art direction hooks you in, then the 
inventive mixture of 2D platforming and pinballing 
works better than it has any right to, especially

The Swords Of Ditto
This frankly delightful cartoon action rPg 
sets you as the legendary wielder of the 
Sword of Ditto, whose purpose is to defeat 
the evil terror mormo. So far, so typical. 
But what sets this apart from others of 
its ilk (aside from the adorable Adventure 
Time-esque art style) is that when you die, 
the game shoots forward 100 years and a 
new character takes up the Sword of Ditto. 
Any weapons and loot you collected during a 
previous attempt can be collected in your 
next run-through, although your success  
or failure will have an effect on the world 
around you. 
There’s also a rich vein of tongue-in-
cheek comedy throughout, from the ability 
to use non-traditional weapons like vinyl 
records and golf clubs to a handy but dim 
guide called Puka whose stock in retorts 
could use a little polishing up. 
Plus, there’s couch co-op and, in a neat 
touch, you can revive another player by 
giving them a hug. with an 
intriguing hook that 
promises to make 
every story 
compelling, this 
could be an early

Spelunky 2
The original treasure-
hunting roguelike 
platformer became a cult 
sensation. So why bring it back? we thought we 
should ask creator Derek Yu. He tells us: “Spelunky 
has been an incredibly fertile place for my 
imagination and it’s continuing to give me things to 
think about after its release. The sequel is a chance 
for me to put those ideas to use.”
what those ideas are, he is keeping tight-lipped 
about for now. it looks likely that you’ll play as the 
Spelunker’s daughter, and in the debut trailer, she 
has a dog by her side. Perhaps we might have a 
companion in our next adventure? 
even if the dog isn’t about, your friends will be. 
Yu tells us: “Co-op, and multiplayer in general, will 
be a big part of Spelunky 2.” it’s been a long time 
since our last expedition, but we’re digging this.

ape Out
A garish explosion of blood, jazz, and stark 
silhouettes, this violent ape escape is like nothing 
else on PlayStation. 
As you might guess from the title, your job here 
is to guide a gorilla out of his cage and get him to 
freedom, fighting off humans. what’s initially 
striking is the art design. everything looks like a 
paper cut-out, right down to the fuzzy texture on 
backgrounds. with vibrant splashes of colour as 
well, Ape out is a real feast for the eyes.
But in the teaser we play, it’s the moment-to-
moment action where it truly takes off. every time 
you hit someone, you hear a cymbal crash. This 
morphs what you see on screen into a peculiar 
rhythm action game, where you’re effectively 
conducting your own jazzy number by hurling 
humans at walls and each other. it’s hypnotic, 
especially when you meet enemies who come at you 
with bombs strapped to their back. nothing adds a 
bit of kick to a beat like an explosion.

Laser League
we’re fans of olli olli 
developer roll7 and our 
indie multiplayer classics at 
oPm Towers, which means that the hectic action of 
laser league is fast becoming a team obsession. 
it’s a competitive arcade sport game where two 
teams compete to be the last ones standing on a 
Tron-like neon field. Scattered across the arena 
are nodes that can be triggered by running over 
them, in turn laser barriers in your colour are 
activated. However, if the opposition turns them to 
their colour, you have to avoid them. Failing to do so 
means a ko, and your teammate will need to revive 
you. when all your team is down, that’s the round 
over. Add in classes which come with their own 
unique ‘powers’, such as ghost, which gives you a 
few seconds of invincibility, and matches satisfy 
twitchy thumbs and strategic minds alike. 
Simple, fast, and addictive, our hands-ons over 
the last year have left us desperate to play more.

he hardest part of playing 
Capcom’s action role-player 
is learning to enjoy the kill. 
You may go in thinking ‘Look 
at that loopy Paolumu; I don’t 
want to put a lance through its 
pink, furry face’. But after the 
beast takes a lump or two out 
of your leg, the gloves are off. Monster Hunter: 
World isn’t as cute as it looks, and no amount 
of wide-eyed cats in fur hats can hide the 
brutality of the hunt.
The question marks over Monster Hunter: World 
have never been around the buzz you get from 
taking apart a 50-foot beast with an oversized 
katana – that’s a given – but rather around how 
Capcom can take the series’ densely constructed 
set of RPG systems and present them in a way 
newcomers and salty old hunters alike can enjoy.
The answer is to wrap the game in a cosy 
story that pushes you through the game’s 
fantastical world of Astera from one epic creature 
encounter to the next, learning and looting as 
you go to become a better hunter. The plot 
sees you journey to the New World hot on 
the heels of Zorah Magdaros, the largest Elder 
Dragon ever seen, and one which, it’s presumed, 
will do incredible damage to the world if not 
stopped from sending the the other creatures 
of Astera into a frenzy. While it’s thin on 
emotional content – don’t expect any Horizon 
Zero Dawn-style revelations – it’s a functional 
prologue to the meat of the game. Teamed with 
“nO amOunt Of wide-eyed catS  
in fur hatS can hide the  
brutality Of the hunt.”

Below The 
Handler will 
offer you advice 
and send you  
on Quests.
your excitable Handler, who offers advice and 
constantly explains the ins and outs of how to 
hunt, the story is much-needed encouragement 
to grind through the game’s core gameplay loop: 
track, kill, and craft. 
Tracking your prey in Astera’s beautifully 
detailed open world is as easy as sending out 
your Scout Flies to seek out creature clues to 
follow. It’s an open world game-changer: you’ll 
never be lost in Monster Hunter: World’s varied 
and complex maps. Once you find a monster, the 
heavy lifting of hacking apart the creature takes 
place, using one of 14 super-sized weapons. Once 
the creature is killed, you then need to scavenge 
its carcass for materials with which to craft new 
armour, weapon sets, and items that will make 
the next hunt a little easier. 
 DEPth DEFyIng
You’re likely thinking this doesn’t sound too 
complicated. And you’d be 
wrong. Everything you do in 
Monster Hunter: World is 
layered with hidden depths, 
tricks, and crafting menus 
to study and master. Take 
something as simple as Scout 
Flies: the more tracks of a 
particular monster breed you 
collect, the more you learn 
about it, levelling up your affinity to that creature 
and making tracking and killing it easier. Dipping 
into the Monster Field Guide you can begin to 
discern a monster’s weaknesses – this book 
details which parts of a monster are breakable, 
and the ideal weapons for breaking them.
In other hands the wealth of ways to fiddle 
with and affect the game could become 
overwhelming, but the fact everything is geared 
around the simple act of killing big bads gives 
each layer you descend into a clear focus. 
Everything you do, no matter its complexity, 
is geared around hunting and killing the 
next monster on your Quest list. Nothing 
demonstrates this more than Monster Hunter: 
World’s combat. First impressions suggest a 
simple button-basher, and with only w and 
e to tap it does appear that way, until 
you understand each of the 14 weapons 
behave in different ways within that 
simple setup. 
The katana-like longsword is a do-all 
sharpie with access to Spirit Gauge 
attacks – using i you can launch 
extended combos and modify the 
basic attacks. However, while the 
longsword is good for close-up 
melee strikes and offers greater 
mobility (which taps into one 
of this new Monster Hunter’s 
greatest advances over past 
games) it’s fairly useless against 
flying beasts. For that you need a 
bow, and for heavy, slow-moving monsters 
it’s best to opt for an enormous hammer.
cut aBovE
With each weapon comes a new set of 
combos, button configurations, and tactics 
to learn – there’s those tasty layers of 
gameplay again. Where once i accessed 
the longsword’s Spirit Gauge, with a bow 
it lines up precision shots, it 
turns an axe into an extendable 
flaming sword, and it activates 
the dual blades’ Demon mode 
– a stamina-sapping mix of 
enhanced super attacks and 
evasive actions.
At first you’ll cosy up to the 
longsword, because its speed 
and mobility feel familiar, but 
you won’t progress far beyond 
the early hunts playing it safe. 
Soon you’ll need to try other 
weapons, such as a lance that 
extends with each tap of w 
like a pneumatic needle… 
because why not? They’ll feel 
awkward, clumsy, and slow; 
each weapon affects mobility 
and timing and you’ll fumble 
at the new 
button 
layouts, 
moan as 
you mistime 
a heavy 
bow’s reload, 
and sigh 
despondently 
as your 
dalliance with the insect glaive 
ends with you in a beast’s belly. 
Life on the hunt is complicated.
The reason you need such a 
variety of weapons, however, 
is that every monster you 
confront needs to be tackled 
in different ways. Killing each 
creature is like a boss battle in 
its own right; they need to be 
studied and their weaknesses 
spotted. Taking the right tools 
for the job becomes essential. 
But simply acknowledging 
your loadout can be effective 
against different monsters is 
surface-level stuff. Just when 
I think I’ve got a handle on 
the game, having swapped 
to a heavy bowgun, crafted 
armour-piercing arrows, and 
picked apart a particularly 
horny Radobaan (a large dragon 
caked in spiked armour) – I 
dip into the upgrade tree and 
realise I’ve barely scratched the 
surface. Laid before me are row 
upon row of upgrades, each 
one needing ores, bones, and 
rare monster materials to craft. 
There’s a long road ahead to 
truly conquer this game.
 
WEll BuIlt  
We’re back to those hidden 
layers again. Weapons crafted 
from scavenged creature parts 
become imbued with the buffs 
of the beasts they’re created 
from. For example, a longsword 
created from the electrically-
charged Tobi-Kadachi will 
release sparkling shock attacks, 
while a lance built from 
colourful and toxic Pukei-Pukei 
parts drips with poison. Killing 
a monster once will only get 
you a foot on the crafting 
ladder. You’ll need to grind 
through hunts many times 
to loot enough monster parts 
and materials to create coveted 
higher-level weapons.
It’s a reminder that despite 
leaning heavily on action 
Monster Hunter: World has 
the beating heart of a role-
player. Ultimately the game 
can’t escape the trappings of 
the genre, as you’ll need to 
hunt and hunt again in Astera’s 
forest basins and coral caverns 
to gain the materials needed 
to craft better armour and 
monster-buffed weapons to 
proceed deeper into the game.
 
Bounty BonusEs 
It’s here where this Monster 
Hunter takes great strides over 
past games to make its mix 
of hunting and crafting more 
accessible. Rather than take on 
Bounties and Investigations, 
such as collecting 20 
Parashrooms, separately to 
Quests (the game’s main 
hunts), they can now be taken 
as passive missions that can 
be completed as you track 
a monster. It’s a slight but 
important quality-of-life 
change that makes Monster 
Hunter: World far easier to 
get into than past games in 
the series. There’s more too: 
the dev has done away with 
extended animations when 
collecting flora and fauna, and 
made leaping onto a monster’s 
back to deliver precision attacks 
contextual – this proves an 
effective way to deliver precise 
blows as you can scurry around 
the beast’s back, face, and tail 
while hammering w. 
Life on the hunt has finally 
been put within reach of 
newcomers, and these changes 
are needed as the game is 
undeniably complex. Even with 
tutorials, helpful hints, and 
the gentle learning curve of 
story Quests, Monster Hunter: 
World can feel overwhelming 
when you first press play. If you 
come in just to bash a beastie 
you’ll come up short, and miss 
the point as much your target. 
You need to embrace all of the 
game’s deep systems to truly 
enjoy the perfect hunt. 
To craft better items, for 
example, you’ll need to make

use of the Botanist to harvest useful flora, or the 
Elder Melder to create rare items – you’ll find 
both in the HQ. Or you can hire the Palico safari 
team in the Research Base to gather materials for 
you while you’re on a hunt.
It soon becomes apparent your pack of items 
is as valuable as the oversized cleaver hanging off 
your back. Potions and powders to extend health 
and stamina or guard against elemental attacks 
can turn the tables on your prey. Special gear like 
the Ghillie suit becomes invaluable, and learning 
how to affect your environment to get the edge is 
a must – the moment I discovered health-eating 
noxious gas in the Rotten Vale can be burned 
away with flaming slinger ammo was one of 
many lightbulb moments. 
This highlights how interconnected the vast 
world is. There are six locations to explore, and 
each has a unique ecosystem to master, from 
the early maze-like tree roots and waterlogged 
caverns of the Ancient Forest to the sand and 
mud of Wildspire Waste. Crucially these worlds 
(divided into handy numbered sectors) are 
living spaces, not just visual 
delights. There’s a hierarchy 
of life to make use of. Certain 
plants grow in particular areas, 
smaller creatures feed on this 
vegetation, and larger monsters 
chow down on these animals. 
Understanding the personality 
of each location adds to your 
immersion in, and the ultimate 
success of, the hunt. A palpable 
smugness comes from laying 
down poisoned meat where I 
know a Tzitzi-Ya-Ku is going 
to feed, giving me a quick 
advantage as I bludgeon it with 
a hefty hammer.
Giving you a sense of 
accomplishment is Monster 
Hunter: World’s crowning 
strength, and it’ll drive you 
all the way to learning and 
subverting the Elder Dragons’ 
personalities. Each monster 
has behavioural traits you 
can undermine, plotting their 
hunting patterns and using 
the world and rivalries with 
other creatures against them 
– this is the most fun, and 
effective strategy. Fed up to 
my armoured back teeth of 
being on the receiving end 
of a battering from Legiana 
(a flying Wyvern breed that 
resembles an elegant hawk with 
the ability to fire blasts of icy 
wind), I tease the creature into 
Paolumu’s path and let the pair 
tear chunks out of one another. 
Watching the giants of Monster 
Hunter: World go talon to 
spiked tail is kaiju heaven. But

four-player Squads. Capcom 
is also planning free Events 
post-release – special timed

nature of the game demands 
teamwork, and while shy 
players can succeed you’ll get 
more from the game by going 
all-in and turning your mic on. 
The real draw of multiplayer, 
however, comes from making 
the grind palatable. Playing in 
teams you’ll soon be collecting 
the monster parts needed 
to complete an armour set, 
and ticking off Assignment 
missions in quick time. If 
you have a competitive side, 
you’re catered for too – you 
can either compete in Arenas

F
or better and (rarely) worse, this 
outstanding platformer captures the 
experience of climbing a mountain. From 
the nimbleness of protagonist Madeline 
to the spectacular views that await as you get 
higher up the titular alp, there’s a sense of 
pushing yourself to limits you didn’t know 
you had. Especially after the 117th attempt at 
getting through one of its trickier sections.
This pixel art affair follows Madeline, a 
determined 20-something who is hellbent on 
reaching the top of Mount Celeste. However, 
this isn’t a case of slowly trudging up an icy 
slope and spending evenings huddled in a tent. 
The higher she gets, the more she discovers the 
mystical nature of the mountain, with her inner 
demon manifesting herself. 
It’s a good job, then, that Madeline handles like 
a character from OPM favourite Towerfall (they 
share the same developer). She is fast, just floaty 
enough when jumping to tweak the path of her 
jump mid-air, can cling onto walls when holding 
i and boasts a dash that lets you whizz across 
a small distance, although it only recharges when 
you hit the ground again. 
mountain magiC 
Mastering this simple moveset is a joy. Partly 
because you have exactly the right amount of 
control of Madeline, but mainly 
because of the superb level 
design. Large sections are 
broken down into bite-sized 
screens, each with a particular 
challenge to overcome. 
Sometimes it’ll be a case of 
simply hopping a gap; at other 
times it’ll be finding ways to 
clamber up to an exit point. 
But what starts simple 
quickly becomes complex 
in each area due to unique 
concepts for each section. Early 
on, when you trek through 
an abandoned city, there are 
moving blocks that you can 
use to generate momentum 
for bigger jumps. In the next 
level, there are blocks you can 
only dash through. The pattern 
continues throughout, each 
level introducing and discarding

environmental elements, 
keeping things fresh. 
And believe us, this is 
rock-solid in the first run-
through, as you learn the 
precise movements you need 
to make headway in each of 
the demanding environments. 
There’s a small element of 
puzzling in working out what’s 
expected of you, but it’s never 
too taxing to figure out what 
you should be doing. Pulling 
it off, on the other hand, will 
provide a stern test for pretty 
much anyone. The only times 
where it feels unfair are the few 
occasions where it leans a little 
too close to trial and error.

In terms of the moment-to-
moment platforming, Celeste is 
astoundingly addictive and the 
right side of exacting. But it’s 
the characters that give it heart. 
Whether it’s selfie-obsessed 
Theo, whose mellowness masks 
uncertainty, or a giggling old 
lady who teases and cajoles 
Madeline through her journey, 
there’s a surprisingly strong 
cast, whose members worm 
their way into your heart.
Unlike the action, there are 
a few more niggles with the 
actual story, such as the fact it 
feels a little unsure about how 
to end, but the earnestness 
and affection for its characters 
means it’s never anything less 
than likeable. 
Despite a few wobbles here 
and there, Celeste deserves 
to be mentioned in the same 
breath as Super Meat Boy and 
Spelunky. The beautiful and 
detailed art, the delightful story 
and the seriously satisfying 
platforming combine to make 
this something special. Thanks 
to Assist mode, the game  
caters to all types of players 
without short-changing any of 
them, making it essential for 
anyone who enjoys the idea of 
looking up at a great, craggy 
height and thinking “I’m going

This frenetic fighter is on the ropes
E
A Sports games are a lot like entries 
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: top 
quality, with production values higher 
than Snoop Dogg, but an overarching 
sense that they are all kind of the same. You 
know exactly what you’re getting – a slick 
sports sim, with all the usual trimmings, 
from a career-spanning story mode to a card-
collecting Ultimate Team, ripped from FIFA.
You’ll be particularly familiar with UFC 3’s 
offerings if you’ve dabbled with previous titles in 
the series. The brutal, crunching action returns: 
landing a hook remains equal parts satisfying 
and wince-inducing – there’s always a sickening 
sense that something’s broken, such is the 
quality of the mo-cap and sound work. There’s a 
complex array of moves, but the basics don’t take 
long to master; it’s a satisfying balance between 
breadth of choice and simplicity. And, most 
pleasantly for beginners, even when you’re on 
the back foot there’s always a chance to bring it 
back – a perfectly timed uppercut into a ducking 
opponent can turn the tide of the most one-
sided encounter. I can’t quite agree with those 
who describe UFC as elegant, balletic, exchanges 
– this is a sport about kicking 
people in the head until they 
bleed, after all – but there 
is something graceful in the 
animations. That the cutscenes 
get away with blending real-
world footage and in-engine 
renders says a lot about how 
close UFC 3 is to photorealism. 
aLIvE aND KICKING
While the standing game might 
be a bloody ballet, the grappling 
and submission moves are not. 
It’s challenging to translate 
two individuals engaging in 
angry spooning into thrilling 
gameplay, and while EA’s 
attempt is admirable, selecting 
moves from a radial menu 
and flicking a control stick in 
a virtual tug-of-war doesn’t 
really capture any of the nuance 
or excitement of what the 
combatants are actually doing. 
That being said, despite the 
functional but flawed ground-
play, fights remain tense, 
especially in the larger, crowd-
filled arenas. The surrounding 
flair of commentary and TV-
style presentation really adds to 
the grandeur, and manages to 
mask a multitude of sins. The 
career mode may be fairly bare-
bones outside of fights, but 
tweeting ‘banter’ at rivals and 
managing your custom fighter’s 
stats is made genuinely 
enjoyable by some excellent 
presentation. The other modes 
are less thrilling, with some 
simple variants on the standard 
match rules, an ode to FIFA’s 
Ultimate Team, a practice 
mode, and a remarkably 
in-depth character creator 
rounding out the package. 
There’s plenty to get your 
teeth into here (though not 
your opponents, please), if 
you find the core mechanics 
satisfying, but with the 
grappling and ground-game 
falling short, there’s more than 
a passing possibility that you’ll 
lose interest before it runs out 
of modes to throw at you.

don’t need to have played it to play this. 
the story has nothing on the show’s

simplified – though faithful to the show – art 
style, it makes for a cute adventure with 
your favourite characters along for the ride.
unfortunately what could’ve been a fun tie-
in is held back by technical hiccups and an 
inefficient combat system that makes even 
the simplest of fights drag. an expanded 
party roster brings new moves and creates 
a reasonable amount of strategic depth.2 
However, you’ll find yourself relying on the 
same two characters to mop up mooks. the 
high encounter rate with difficult-to-avoid, 
samey enemies further frustrates and 
makes a worrying amount of the game feel 
like it’s caught in an inescapable time loop.
even the game’s strongest points, like 
its moments of character interaction and 
its pastel-coloured world, end up working 
against it as they only leave me wanting to 
get back into the show. Sadly, 
while the Crystal Gems always 
save the day, even they can’t 
find a way to rescue this one.

not just that the end-game boss is

for example, is a system to reward you for

in more general terms, presentation and

balance is excellent across all 20 fighters

hen you first boot up 
Bluepoint’s behemoth-
brutalising redux, 
there’s a danger a 
little voice may needle 
at you. It’ll whisper 
in your ear: “Wait, 
Shadow Of The 
Colossus always looked like this, right?” Well, 
you can mute that nostalgic nutter right now. 
Rest assured, Team Ico’s PS2 masterpiece 
(nor its well-handled PS3 remaster) in no way, 
shape, or form looked this beautiful.
And yes, this is a remake, not a remaster. At 
least from a visual standpoint. When it comes to 
core content, Shadow Of The Colossus on PS4 is 
more or less identical to the 2005 original, which 
may disappoint those hoping Bluepoint would 
reintegrate the eight cut colossi Fumito Ueda and 
his team dropped from the PS2 masterpiece. Still, 
the visual overhaul is so comprehensive, labelling 
this exquisitely handled passion project as a bog-
standard HD remaster would be unkind.
(rE)maDE man 
Bluepoint’s remake looks astonishingly good. The 
remastering specialist has completely rebuilt the 
13-year-old classic using Ultra HD art assets, and 
the results – especially in 4K ‘cinematic mode’ 
on PS4 Pro – are never less than thoroughly eye-
arousing. Where once there was a barren land 
filled with little more than textureless rocks and 
a constantly bleached sky, now a verdant world 
teeming with delicate flora lies at your feet. 
There’s so much added detail in this cursed 
land, going back to the PS3 remaster – which 
I actually did for this review – is like rubbing 
shards of rock salt into your corneas. Scrubby

shrubs have been replaced with fabulously 
detailed trees with moist, bulbous fungi clinging 
to them. Endless tufts of thick grass and delicate 
flowers pepper once-lifeless fields. Fluorescent 
lime green fireflies buzz about among the mossy 
meadows the fourth colossi calls home. 
Bluepoint has also thrown in spectacular new 
lighting and particle effects. The sandstorms 
that engulf the desert where you fight Phalanx 
make the seismic scuffle much more dramatic, 
while the pale veil of morning mist that coats the 
cloud-hugging arena you find the third colossus 
straddling looks sensational. I don’t care if you’ve 
played through the PS2 version a dozen times. 
Your eyes need this remake.
BaSh oF thE titanS
Considering I’ve yammered on telling fans of 
the original how spectacular Bluepoint’s redux 
is, I should probably step back and explain what 
you actually do in Shadow Of The Colossus. 
Hey, some folk may have been trapped down a 
well for the last decade-and-a-bit. In short, it’s 
a game where you explore a 
largely empty open world as a 
near-wordless warrior, seeking 
out and slaying 16 sad-eyed 
goliaths, known as colossi. 
Why is Wander so obsessed 
with shoving his sword into 
these megaton monsters’ weak 
parts, you ask? He’s trying to 
resurrect his dead love with the 
help of a demon. Obviously.
When SOTC was first 
released, many hailed its pared-
back quest as refreshingly 
streamlined. Years on, that 
focus is still Colossus’ greatest 
strength. You’ll find no side-
quests to joylessly tick off here. 
No towers to scale in order to 
fill a minimap with clusters 
of busywork. Instead, it’s just 
you, the best animated horse in 
games (even now), and 16 of the 
most engrossing boss battles 
you’ll find on PlayStation.
Said big bads essentially 
act as giant, moving platform 
levels. With a couple of notable 
exceptions, each colossus is 
bigger than a block of flats. 
Some are shaped like football 
field-long water snakes, others 
are avian giants that make Big 
Bird look microscopic, while 
the last colossus is so tall, 
it takes five full minutes at 
least to scale. No matter what 
form they come in, they all 
share one trait: each one really 
wants to shake Wander off its 
gargantuan furry form. 
That’s where the remake’s 
revamped control scheme 
comes in handy. While the 
original controls remain an 
option for purists, the default 
modern layout switches jump 
from w to q, while grab now 
lives on i instead of u. The 
former switch may not sound 
like a game-changer, but when 
you get a DualShock 4 in your 
hands and start scaling a titan, 
it feels much more intuitive. 
It helps that the game is 
more responsive. Although it’s 
limited to 30fps, the cinematic 
mode is still sharper than the 
PS3 remaster. Animation cycles 
feel tighter, making Wander a 
“as for the new Photo 
mode, It ruIned me… In the 
nIcest PossIBle way.”

As for the new photo mode, it

Messing about with different 
camera pans, filters, and FOV 
sliders is a game in itself, and 
because the spectacle of what’s 
on-screen is often so thrilling 
it’s easy to spend minutes 
lining up the perfect shot. It’s 
on the podium with Horizon: 
Zero Dawn and Assassin’s 
Creed Origins as one of the all-

Is Colossus a universally easy 
recommendation? Not quite. 
This isn’t a game for everyone. 
What comes across as bold 
pacing to one person could be 
construed as one-note design

VR shocker in need of some surgery
Y
ou know a horror game is working 
when you’re torn between tiptoeing 
forward and turning off everything in 
the house and hiding under a duvet. 
That apprehension flickers to life sporadically 
in Supermassive’s VR ’60s-set prequel to Until 
Dawn. There are sequences which become 
heart-rate accelerating and deliver the jolts you 
would want. Sadly, there’s also a lot of slowly 
strolling through memory lane.
Not that your character has a lot of memory. 
Falling back onto the safest cliché around, when 
you groggily come to at the start of the story, 
your character is an amnesiac with no clue of 
who they are or why they are at Blackwood 
Sanatorium. To learn more, you’ll be asking 
questions to try to unravel their personal history.
The first big twist is that voice recognition is 
used to allow you to choose dialogue options by 
speaking them out loud. While that might seem 
a little corny, it does a good job of grounding 
you in this environment. Chatting to the people 
you come across during your stay at Blackwood 
adds an extra layer of immersion and works 
surprisingly well, although my relatively soft 
Midlands accent is probably 
not the toughest of tests for it. 
This fun mechanic runs 
throughout the game, but is at 
its best in the first half, a mix 
of slow-burning scenes inside 
a locked room, interacting 
with a cellmate whose low-key 
threatening questions build a 
sense of dread. Combined with 
occasional dream sequences 
that are cheap but effective 
in providing jump scares, 
you sense it’s building up to 
something memorable.   
PsYcho FIllEr 
Sadly, my first playthrough 
loses all momentum halfway 
through. As soon as you leave 
your cell to explore Blackwood, 
there’s little urgency and plenty 
of mythology. All the tension 
starts to evaporate as you 
trudge slowly through half-
remembered places and fill 
out the backstory by finding 
collectibles that unlock your 
memories. The scares dry up as 
the dream sequences disappear 
and the characters we meet 
have none of the playful charm 
of Until Dawn’s cast. 
While additional paths and 
endings offer reasons to replay 
(there are better storylines than 
the one I first play through), 
this gives you fewer reasons 
to do so than Until Dawn. 
The choices you make are still 
significant, but this time you 
only have one character to care 
about – your own. 
For all its flaws, though, 
there are enough moments 
of quality here to make a trip 
through Blackwood worth it. 
Playing with voice recognition 
draws you into the world in a 
way choosing dialogue options 
simply doesn’t, and the sound 
design makes the jump scares 
effectively jarring. But with 
so much of your time slowly 
pacing through locations we’ve 
seen before, only Until Dawn 
obsessives will want to make 
that visit more than once.

Lost sPhEar
Tokyo RPG Factory’s second venture loses focus
Y
ou know what they say: if it ain’t 
broke, don’t fix it. Which isn’t to 
suggest Tokyo Game Factory’s debut, 
I Am Setsuna, wasn’t without flaws, 
but the Japanese role-player’s charm and 
wistful demeanour offset many its perceived 
shortcomings. Lost Sphear, the developer’s 
likeminded follow-up, sets out to improve 
on its predecessor but fails to recapture what 
made the 2016 original quite so special.
While it’s perhaps unfair to compare Lost Sphear 
so closely with its forerunner, by declaring itself 
a “spiritual successor” to what’s come before – 
one which pays deference to the same traditional 
genre trappings, such as open world maps, 
whimsical characters, and turn-based combat – 
it’s made the comparison inevitable. 
Story-wise, you assume control of Kanata, 
an orphan whose hometown and residents have 
begun to vanish, transforming into white voids. 
Before long, our hero discovers he has the power 
to harness memories, which in turn can restore 
the lost world. And from here, you and a typically 
ragtag ensemble of seemingly incongruous 
characters travel the land in a bid to restore its 
former glory, visiting towns, 
and dungeons, and castles, 
and… you get the picture. 
Déjà vu
Which is arguably Lost 
Sphear’s biggest downfall: it 
fails to carve its own identity. 
Composer Tomoki Miyoshi 
returns with another worthy 
score, but the decision to 
introduce multiple instruments 
here, against Setsuna’s piano-
exclusive soundtrack, leaves it 
lacking punch. The decision to 
overhaul the interface means 
the now-generic UI reflects 
that of a mobile RPG, while 
borrowing from too many of 
the classics leaves its story 
feeling hollow.
Combat is fun, though, 
with a Chrono Trigger-esque 
Active Time Battle system 
– wherein the fight doesn’t 
pause for menu browsing – 
making a welcomed return. A 
Limit Break-like Momentum 
mechanic adds depth to battles 
(storing Momentum energy 
allows you to boost attack 
power). Learning when best to 
utilise this lets you alter the 
dynamics of fights on the fly, 
and your party’s ability to move 
around the battlefield as you 
search for the perfect attack 
angle can be great fun. 
Magic is again represented 
by Spritnites, the game’s 
interpretation of spells, which 
are unlocked by town-based 
Magic Consortiums. Characters 
can access six spells at a 
time, while new ones can be 
created by harvesting resources. 
Spells can be enhanced with 
secondary effects, offering 
scope for experimentation.
Lost Sphear is an RPG that 
could push beyond 100 hours 
and yet can be wrapped up 
inside 25. There’s potential to 
explore off the beaten track, but 
by spreading itself so thin, and 
failing to forge its own identity, 
I was too often left questioning 
why I’d want to.

a tall tale about modern poverty
W
ill O’neill is no stranger to telling 
powerful stories, and Little Red 
Lie, a grievous exploration of debt, 
family turmoil, and middle-class poverty, 
is the independent developer’s first game 
on PlayStation. Don’t be fooled by its looks; 
beneath that cheerful, cartoony veneer lies 
a complex drama that reflects society’s 
obsession with money, and the problems  
this invariably creates. 
the game follows two very different 
central characters: Sarah Stone, a financially 
compromised millennial; and arthur Fox, 
an obnoxious high-rolling businessman. 
naturally, the two live at opposite ends of 
the wealth spectrum but have one thing 
in common: each of their player-directed 
actions is contextualised by a lie.1
in the former case, this centres around 
Sarah’s resentment for her parents and 
the tumultuous relationship she shares with 
her narcissistic and suicidal sister.2 the 
latter feeds into arthur’s – who is said to be 
loosely based on Donald trump and the late 
canadian mayor Rob Ford – ostentatious and 
often obnoxious lifestyle, wherein he battles 
a concealed drug addiction and rips people 
off as a successful self-help guru.
it’s heavy stuff, and as such Little Red Lie 
isn’t exactly a fun experience. nevertheless, 
it’s an important one, and O’neill does 
a wonderful job of providing a relatable 
overview of modern dysfunctional society. 
His thoughtful writing matches the game’s 
sombre tone and is powerful, evocative and 
relatable in equal measure, particularly in an 
age where inequality is so easily 
identifiable. Little Red Lie is a 
fine example of contemporary 
narrative adventure done  
well. Joe Donnelly
FootNotES 1 each lie appears in red text. 2 whereas O’neill’s 
first game, actual Sunlight, focussed on its protagonist’s 
depression, this shift requires more thought on your part.

it has wings but never soars
v
isually, if for no other reason, this 
game holds your attention. it’s set in 
an inverted world, one that’s a  
sphere of water with landmasses dotting 
the inside. the soft reds and blue tones that 
distinguish the water and land are lovely, 
making for a strange but soothing space 
to be in. Or it would be, if the game itself 
weren’t closer to water torture than an 
underwater trip. 
you play as the cartographer, a flying 
drone that’s also capable of diving 
underwater. though whether you’re in 
the water or in the air, the game controls 
exactly the same so it all feels a bit pointless, 
to be honest.1 you’re on a quest to collect 
relics scattered throughout the world, to 
discover the fate of the ancient civilisation 
that left them behind, but they may as well 
be sparkling magic coins, as fascinating as 
they try to be. *sigh*
innerSpace infuriates from the very start. 
a constant stream of cutscenes interrupts 
play, as if the developer is terrified of leaving 
players alone for five minutes. worse, all 
these interruptions serve no purpose, either 
showing you developments you were already 
quite aware of, spoiling even the simplest 
puzzle or telling you nothing, leaving you to 
wander aimlessly for ages. 
the flying is pleasant, if a little dull2 
and the inverted world is fascinating to 
see in motion but it’s not nearly enough. 
innerSpace evokes games like abzû 
or Journey but summons none of the 
intuitiveness. where they were frequently 
joyous adventures, innerSpace 
is a dull game punctuated by 
brief moments of fun and  
rather more instances of 
frustration. Sam Greer
FootNotES 1 the visuals are truly lovely but the skyless world 
makes it all a bit disorientating. 2 Flying should feel liberating, but 
thanks to a parade of cutscenes, you never enjoy it.

a big wet kiss to the ‘80s
W
ow, the ’80s, right? not that i 
know anything about the decade 
first-hand. thankfully there’s plenty 
of media that can clue me in. But, with its 
pixel art presentation and Saturday morning 
cartoon style cutscenes, is there more to 
this 2D puzzle platformer than 20th century 
nostalgia? not really – but that’s okay!
Something’s very wrong in the small town 
of tajunga.1 after a destructive storm, the 
barrier between the living and the dead 
has been disturbed, throwing a five-man-
band of plucky youngsters right into the 
middle of a government conspiracy. Via a 
magical macGuffin, you’ll need to switch 
between living and dead protagonists, using 
each one’s unique abilities in order to solve 
puzzles, defeat evil adults, and exorcise 
malicious spectres. 
Figuring out the best use of each teenage 
team member’s individual abilities is 
enjoyable2 but unfortunately, borrowing cues 
from the trial-and-error style of play popular 
among its forebears, soon takes a turn for 
the frustrating. we don’t need to revisit 
everything that was popular in the ’80s. 
the story, while wonderfully trope-y, takes 
time to fully lean into its own absurdity. 
Brief musings on grief, while necessary, 
are not given the room they need and 
feel generally unconvincing. thankfully, 
proceedings quickly return to the fun romp 
promised by the opening hour, pitting you 
against a boss that’ll test your baseball 
skills, followed by your teenage protagonist 
pedalling furiously away from a pursuing 
car. if you’re desperate for your 
next nostalgia fix or a pixel party 
puzzler, you won’t feel like you’ve 
made a wrong turn onto this 
crossing. Jessica Kinghorn

Dynasty Warriors 9
Far bigger, but not necessarily better
t
he liberal use of artistic licence and 
anachronism, the eclectic soundtrack 
combining traditional instruments with 
cheesy rock goodness, the return of the 
one-man army: Dynasty Warriors is definitely 
back. But rather than a strictly ballroom 
performance, the ninth instalment adds a few 
new steps to the tried-and-true routine of 
previous entries, going open world for the first 
time, among other things.
Once again, grand-scale military battles form 
much of the backdrop as your chosen champion 
of the three rival states takes centre stage. 
Between mashing r for basic combo attacks and 
interjecting with e for special Musou moves, 
the ninth instalment stuffs a few more tricks 
up your sleeve. For starters, when you see the 
on-screen prompt over an attacking foe, you can 
press w to perform either a counter or finishing 
move, and with u you can perform a guard break, 
a knock down, or launch your enemies into the 
air via the face buttons. Alongside gems that can 
be forged into your weapons, either giving you an 
elemental edge or boosting base stats, this adds 
welcome variety and an additional layer of visual 
flair to combat. That said, even 
with occasional deviations from 
the series’ norm (for instance, 
there’s a stealth mission early 
on in Shu’s story), there are few 
enemies in the first 10 hours 
that necessitate a strategy more 
complex than hammering r.
DiE nasty
Boasting a roster of over 80 
characters (each with a favoured 
weapon, specific Musou moves, 
and story scenes) that are 
unlocked as you play through 
the 13 chapters for each faction, 
the amount of content in this 
entry is impressive. Tucked 
into every corner of the 
expansive map are stunning 
vistas plus a number of new 
additions. These include 
hideaways you can buy and 
kit out, watchtowers that 
let you push back the fog of 
war, resources you’ll need for 
crafting or cooking that you can 
wrestle from powerful enemies, 
and animals that you can only 
encounter by straying from the 
path. But despite everything 
the open world still ends up 
feeling empty, especially as 
much of your time is spent 
travelling long stretches 
between battles broken up only 
by samey outpost offensives.
While battles are informed 
by a story drawing from rich 
historical and literary sources, 
the presentation is devoid 
of that same richness. Many 
conversations leading up to 
pivotal battles are conveyed 
through bland cutscenes 
featuring inexpressive, mostly 
static character models. English 
voices return, alongside the 
option of Japanese or Chinese 
audio, though they are far 
more restrained than previous 
appearances and unable to 
save these scenes. Even the 
settlements feel lifeless, filled 
with the same NPCs carrying 
out the same animations, 
failing to create the illusion of 
more beneath the surface.

 t 
his isn’t really a game 
about mining, or 
crafting for that matter. 
The key to this Telltale 
adaptation of the wildly 
popular build-’em-up is in 
the other half of its name. 
This is an episodic story 
about adventure, exploration, 
and, okay, the occasional bit 
of crafting – but at its core 
it’s all about friendship.
Over its five episodes, the game 
examines what happens when 
a close-knit group of friends 
grows apart, and asks whether 
it’s healthy to try to stop this 
change. On one side you have 
Jesse, your character, and a 
band of adventurer pals bonded 
together by the events of the 
first season of Minecraft: Story 
Mode, but since scattered all 
across the map. On the other 
is The Admin, a baddie with 
all the powers of… well, a 
Minecraft server admin. 
builds chaRactER
The Admin also gets a 
backstory which contrasts 
neatly with the heroes’ 
struggles. Once part of his 
own group of adventurers, he 
turned to the dark side in an 
attempt to hold their friendship 
together. This lends some 
complexity to a story that is 
otherwise fairly basic save-
the-world stuff, and makes 
for interesting conversations 
and decisions. That’s handy, 
because these are the bits of 
the game you’ll actually have 
control over. There’s the odd 
segment of rudimentary point-
and-clicking, clunky combat 
or – an appropriate highlight 
given this is Minecraft – 
surprisingly fun building. But 
for the most part, Telltale 
guards the steering wheel like 
a dad taking you on your very 
first driving lesson.
Your main contributions as 
a player are picking dialogue 
options, which are all well 
written and performed, and 
hitting buttons in time with 
the on-screen prompts during 
stylish, cinematic action 
sequences. Oh, and, of course, 
making the kind of big plot-
branching decisions which 
became Telltale’s hallmark in 
the popular Walking Dead 
games. The stakes are a little 
lower here – don’t expect to 
be picking which character 
gets their intestines gobbled 
up – but Story Mode manages 
to make you care enough about 
its blocky-faced characters that 
there’s still plenty of tension in 
every choice.
A well-told adventure story 
with surprisingly real themes, 
but after multiple episodes it’s 
hard not to wish you were given 
more of a hand in crafting it 
yourself. alex spencer

The days may have been cold and 
the turkey gone, but that didn’t mean 
present season was over in January. 
The decorations hadn’t even been put 
away when Santa Sony revealed a PS 
Plus haul giving us the chance to visit 
future Prague, crime-ridden Gotham, 
and fight to death in a VR spaceship.
dEus Ex: mankind 
dividEd was the 
biggest game in 
the package, an 
immersive FPS which continued the 
story of Adam jensen’s clandestine 
investigation into the Illuminati. we were 
huge fans of it on release, thanks to the 
improved combat (it felt every option, 
from stealth to running and gunning, 
was viable) and some extraordinary level 
design, especially in the main hub world 
of Prague. Okay, the story felt heavy-
handed at times, but who cared about 
that when you could punch through walls?
batman: thE 
tElltalE sERiEs 
was up next, and you 
probably had a good 
idea if you would like it based on your 
appreciation of telltale’s distinctive style. 
It might not be top tier in the developer’s 
back catalogue, but the focus on Bruce 
wayne and Batman gave it a different 
feel to the Arkham series. 
PS VR owners got another chance to 
expand their library with staRblood 
aREna, a multiplayer-focused spaceship 
shooter which delivered everything we 
wanted and more – no motion sickness. 
PS Vita players might have thought it 
was Halloween, as uncanny vallEy 
delivered pixel art horror and psycho-
pass: mandatoRy happinEss gave us 
an anime minority Report.
Finally, there was a fantasy theme for 
PS3 gamers, which possibly scraped 
the bottom of Santa’s sack. scaREd 3

StrEEt FightEr v: 
arcaDE EDition
A new challenger approaches… again?
S
treet Fighter V: Arcade Edition is what 
the game should have been at launch. 
It’s taken almost two years, but finally 
Capcom has beaten the fighter into a 
state it can be proud of. Actually, it’s better 
than that: Street Fighter V, in its current state, 
might even be the best entry in the series.
If you already own the game, the Arcade Edition 
upgrade is free. It’s a sizeable offering, rolling 
all the previously-released DLC characters into 
one package, and throwing in new modes and a 
retouched UI too. That UI shift might be small, 
but it’s mighty – coating the health bars and 
super meters with a fancy layer of gold, it just 
makes the game seem… newer, more premium.  
A potent metaphor for this shiny new product.
Arcade mode is perhaps the biggest addition: 
charting the series’ chequered 31-year history, the 
various ladders take you through the ‘canonical’ 
Street Fighter story, seeing how the world warriors 
end up doing what they’re doing, and kind of 
explaining why they’re doing it. You’re tied to 
canonically correct characters (you won’t be 
playing Rashid in Street Fighter II, for example) 
and every character has their own art per ending 
per game, so it’s a meaty offering. It doesn’t 
match up to Dragon Ball 
FighterZ’s weird SRPG story 
mode, nor does it match the 
multiverse offering in Injustice 
2, but it’s a damn sight better 
than what came before.
bEat your PalS
If you’re interested in the game 
for its multiplayer content 
as well as its single-player 
offering, you’re in luck: the 
online systems are practically 
perfect now. At launch the 
game was nearly unplayable, 
but now the majority of games 
play without lag, there’s a 
varied pool of opponents 
to battle it out against, and 
there is a massive variation 
in match-ups thanks to the 
game’s expanded roster.
There’s also the addition 
of each character’s secondary 
V-Trigger – something to mix 
it up for fans who have been 
playing since launch. This gives 
new and existing characters 
more versatility, meaning that 
even if you’re facing your fifth 
Ryu in a row online (ugh), you 
might not be facing the same 
moveset. Small blessings, eh?
If you want new characters, 
the game has those: Sakura 
comes with the Arcade Edition 
as the start of Season 3, with 
the promise of Blanka, Sagat, 
Falke, Cody, and G to follow at 
a later date. Sakura herself is a

fantastic addition to the roster; 
the Ryu-alike still has her 
multi-hit specials and massive 
combo potential, so she’s like a 
starter character for people who 
hate starter characters. She’s 
got an interesting story, too, 
which actually shows how her 
character develop a bit… even if 
it is in questionable ways.
trial by combat
Arcade Edition has launched 
with some new trials in the 
lab. These combo-practicing 
tools are useful for bolstering 
your toolset in battles. They 
can be tricky to master, but, 
again, this suite of challenges 
is a far better offering than we 
had at launch, and helps you 
understand the high-risk, high-
damage playstyle Street Fighter 
V rocks. What’s more, this 
mode gives you time to really 
pay attention to the fantastic 
animation work that’s gone into 
the models – it’s smooth and 
crisp, clearly indicating hitboxes 
and telegraphing intent (an 
overlooked, but vital, part of 
beat-’em-up DNA).
If you’ve neglected the 
game since launch, you should 
absolutely try it again now. 
With almost twice as many 
characters, new tools for 
each character to use, more 
costumes, more arenas, a 
significant Arcade mode, and 
a (still terrible) Survival mode, 
this game has finally reached 
its potential. Arcade Edition is 
what Street Fighter V has been 
working towards. It’s always 
had a solid core, but Capcom 
has bolstered that with a 
decent single-player buffer, and 
a robust online system to boot. 
The old Street Fighter V is 
dead; long live Street Fighter V!

Three saves within 40 seconds keeps 
us in the match until a tap in means it’s 
1-1. Fate ensures I score the winning

ighting games can be fraught 
places when you venture online. 
The likes of Street Fighter V 
and Tekken 7 can be a 
graveyard for newcomers to 
the scene, and there’s little fun to be 
had from being a punching bag for pro 
players keen to show off. 
Which is why Dragon Ball FighterZ 
feels so refreshing when you step foot 
into its online lobby – a chibi-style social 
world that saps away any confrontation 
– and the players here genuinely feel 
friendly. Soon you’ll be using the many 
pre-made comments or Zstamps to 
throw out simple hellos, and it’s all 
that’s needed to break the ice.
There’s a variety of standard online 
tournaments to embrace, the two main 
ones being Arena and World Match. 
Arena mode is the more relaxed – your 
chibi avatar mingles in a fighters’ circle 
with other players in the lobby waiting 
to be matched. World Match is the main 
draw; here you can enter 
ranked and casual fights.
Once matched you’re 
shown your rival’s stats 
and their connection – 
the frame delay of any 
online fight is shown 
before you hit accept, so 
you get to pick and 
choose the quality of 
opponent you have. (It’s 
best to pay attention to 
your own settings too, as 
you can toggle the 
matchmaking search to 
only find opponents with 
a similar, strong 
connection as your own.) 
Typically most fights 
online have one frame of 
delay, which is good. 
Once a match ends you 
can choose to replay or 
drop back into the lobby 
to find a new challenger.
What’s encouraging 
with Dragon Ball FighterZ 
is the sense that its 
colourful lobby is just 
that, a space to enjoy the 
game whether you’re 
fighting or not. There’re 
training, story, and 
arcade modes to enter

ffline Gang Beasts is a 
great multiplayer game, 
especially when you watch 
your friends’ luck turn on a dime 
and can laugh alongside them at 
your misfortune. Online, however, 
it’s a little harder to love. Perhaps 
it’s down to an increase in the 
player count – from four to eight 
– which does the small maps no 
favours. Maybe it’s because the 
frenzy of swinging punches and 
flinging heads lacks the oomph 
you get when you can see the 
person you’re battering recoil in 
glee alongside you. These are only 
minor nitpicks, but it undeniably 
loses a little in translation despite 
online and offline modes offering 
the same things. Still, if you have 
no-one at home to play with, the 
joy of flinging a Morph-like blob off 
a blimp isn’t diminished entirely.
A higher player count offers a 
reason to venture online, but long 
load times and a tad too much 
chaos means it’s best to play 
with offline friends. Ben tyrer

on’t let the free-to-play tag 
put you off – or the fact 
its been circling PS4 for a 
couple of months. As platform 
fighters go, Brawlhalla is great  
fun. Being free is just a bonus.
Six of the 34 oddball characters 
– including a dandy pirate and 
a scythe-wielding warrior – are 
randomly chosen for selection; if 
you want the complete roster you 
can pay to unlock them with cash 
or in-game currency. each has a 
mix of melee and weapon-based 
combos, with items and power-ups 
dropping randomly as you fight.
key to success is mastering the 
three jump/wall scaling mechanic 
to enable even newcomers to 
master off-platform combat. With 
none of the grinding that plagues 
most free-to-plays, Brawlhalla is a 
refreshing knockabout.

hen it comes to DLC the 
Assassin’s Creed series 
has always treated us 
very nicely, a highlight 
being Syndicate’s Jack 
The Ripper expansion. The Hidden Ones 
falls in line with this tradition – you 
won’t be disappointed. 
The headline features include a rise in 
the level cap from 40 to 45, a new area 
to explore in Sinai, and a new enemy to 
knife from the shadows as the Romans 
take centre stage. Behind these 
inclusions are subtle revisions, 
quality-of-life changes that affect how 
you progress – it’s now easier to find 
weapon-enhancing carbon crystals. 
Aside from these changes and 
additions, playing Origins remains the 
same, with lowly Roman lieutenants 
acting as a bloody first 
step on an assassination 
ladder to the game’s 
commanders. Playing it 
safe means Ubisoft has 
been able to double-
down on the story, 
creating a narrative full 
of nuance that asks the 
question: are Assassins 
heroes or villains? The 
Hidden Ones casts a 
moral uncertainty over 
your actions, and helps 
fulfil Origins’ promise to 
reset the Assassin’s 
Creed universe.
Enjoy this DLC for 
what it is – a reflective 
examination of the 
series’ lore. Next month 
we get to ditch the thinky 
stuff and battle 
mummies and mythical 
beasts in The Curse Of 
The Pharaohs.

Fancy making a few new 
friends online? Okay, in our 
experience that’s rarely a good 
idea, but Rec Room is a 
surprisingly good-natured 
attempt to marry a social network 
to a mini-game collection. There is 
a whole host of games for you to 
try, from paintballing to paddleball, 
and even some that don’t have 
any balls, like 3D Charades. Okay, 
it’s all very “jack of all trades, 
master of none”, with the games 
never quite being as good as we 
want them to be, but meeting real 
people in an online game who 
don’t immediately tell you to jog on 
is a pleasure. The cutesy art 
design helps cultivate a relaxed 
atmosphere, and the fact you add 
friends to your network by literally 
shaking their hand is a very nice 
touch. Despite its roughness, 
there’s an undeniably lovely tone 
to Rec Room that makes up for 
the shortcomings. 
Are you a fan of the popular 
Netflix show Stranger 
Things? Sorry, let me ask a 
different question. Are you a fan 
of that one scene in season one 
where Winona Ryder talks to 
some fairy lights? Because this 
slight PS VR “experience” (the 
publisher’s words, not mine) gives 
you a chance to experience that 
moment in virtual reality. You look 
around using a torch in your right 
hand and teleport to a telephone 
later on to hear Will’s little voice 
over the blower. 
It all looks quite nice and there’s 
a decent little jump scare waiting 
for you. But this is five minutes 
long and requires you to have two 
PS Move controllers. It exists to 
remind you that Stranger Things 
is a show you can watch on 
Netflix. There’s even a trailer for 
season 2 at the end, because 
don’t you dare forget this is a 
glorified advert. 
Let’s get one thing out of the 
way. There are a few times 
in this fleetingly brief PS VR 
adventure with Trico where you 
might get a peek at his anus. We 
didn’t really want to see that 
again, but we definitely will take 
another chance to hang out with 
our favourite cat-bird. 
This short story is pretty 
straightforward. You teleport 
across a few locations feeding 
Trico his beloved barrels, and he 
will be cute as a button around 
you. That’s pretty much all it is, 
but like The Last Guardian, the 
strange and evocative world 
you’re exploring is instantly 
enchanting, so even another 20 
minutes playing through a 
greatest hits package is alright by 
us. This VR demo may be short 
and simple, but in giving us a 
chance to see Trico brought a 
little bit closer to life, we’re in love 
with his world all over again.

 A sequel adapted from 
Death On The Nile is already 
being scripted.
A
gatha Christie’s classic 
whodunnit has been adapted 
for the screen countless 
times, but Kenneth 
Branagh’s lavish update has 
a unique selling point – a collection of 
stars that would put the average 
constellation to shame. Assembling a 
who’s who of modern acting greats 
(including Judi Dench, Derek Jacobi, 
Michelle Pfeiffer, and Johnny Depp) the 
cast is first-class, even if the film as a 
whole is distinctly ‘standing room only’.
Adding a new introduction in 
Jerusalem, we quickly learn about the 
brilliance of Hercule Poirot (Branagh), a 
Belgian detective with an obsessive eye 
for detail. That he also possesses an 
absurdly large moustache goes mostly 
unmentioned. Shortly after boarding the 
Orient Express on a journey from 
Istanbul to Calais, Poirot’s skills are 
required when a passenger is found 
dead under curious circumstances. 
With 13 suspects and endless 
possibilities, Christie’s mystery remains 
bulletproof – the 
standard by which most 
modern detective fiction 
aspires. But the pieces 
don’t quite click together 
on screen, especially if 
you know the ending 
already. And though it 
should be electric to see 
this cast bounce off one 
another, scenes 
featuring more than two 
or three characters are 
disappointingly few and 
far between.
As for Branagh, the 
decision to turn his 
Poirot into a Bond-esque 
man of action is 
somewhat baffling – 
shouldn’t his formidable 
intellect be enough? Still, 
much better than being 
stuck by the loos on the 
9:05 to Doncaster.

Based on the novels of British author 
Richard K. Morgan, Netflix’s major new 
sci-fi series has one heck of a hook, the 
central who/whydunnit as compelling as 
the Dashiell Hammett detective fiction 
its indebted to. But it’s Altered Carbon’s 
world that truly dazzles, the concept of 
a civilisation where death is no longer 
definitive is explored at every social 
stratum. The poor, for example, make 
do with what’s in stock at local prisons, 
while ‘meths’ (named for the Biblical 
figure of Methuselah, who lived to 969 
years old), who can buy 
clones, treat human flesh 
as disposable.
Made on a blockbuster 
budget, it’s staggering to 
look at, rivalling Game Of 
Thrones for scope (and, 
more problematically, 
gratuitous nudity). The 
design owes a heavy 
debt to Blade Runner, 
some of the supporting 
performances are a little 
iffy and anyone allergic 
to sci-fi jargon should be 
wary with phrases like 
‘needlecast’, ‘envoys’ and 
‘cortical stack’ forming 
the backbone of the 
dense dialogue. But 
based on this 10-episode 
first season, Netflix has 
another hit on its hands.

■ Pulling off a stealth attack felt great.
■ Ayame let you to take a more acrobatic approach.
■ You could also test out your skills on a friend. 
n
owadays it’s easy to 
forget that ancient 
fortresses and feudal 
hamlets were once a key 
setting for stealth games. 
since then, we’ve tip-toed 
around government 
buildings, terrorist-held oil rigs, and 
secret facilities courtesy of metal Gear 
solid and splinter Cell. But back in 2003, 
the ninja of the tenchu series, lurking in 
the shadows, scoffed at sam Fisher’s 
night vision goggles fetish. they laughed 
at solid snake’s soliton radar. 
With tenchu: Wrath of Heaven, fancy 
gadgets were never an option – and 
neither was realism. right from the 
opening cutscene, you get the sense of 
a game with a lot of ludicrous ideas to 
pack in. the plot is something gloriously 
loopy about a doppelgänger, time 
travel, an evil warlord, and enchanted 
gemstones. recover gemstones, bring 
order to the land: you get the picture. 
But that bigger picture is easily 
ignored. Wrath of Heaven is really a 
series of surgical strikes featuring one 
of two shinobi: the extremely cross-
looking rikimaru; and ayame, sporting 
what looks like a PvC tank top (see: 
realism, the ignorance of). Your basic 
toolkit consists of a bladed weapon, 
a blowgun, and caltrops, the ancient 
equivalent of upturned lego bricks. it 
also includes poisoned rice cakes, to 
distract and incapacitate a passing 
ronin. if you happen to toss one close to 
a sheer drop, so much the better (see 
realism: the ridiculing of).
as you shuffle through the story, 
your arsenal expands to include more 
outlandish tools, including mind control 
powers and the ability to become 
invisible. there are also powerful secret 
weapons hidden throughout the world, 
such as the poison-edged dokuto blade.
Just like in the dishonored or deus 
ex games, you’re never funnelled into 
a particular style of play. if you mess 
up, you’ll have to grimace and bear it, 
and battle openly, often with archers, 
ronin, and, later on, demons. in a game 
primarily about infiltration, though, 
mass combat gets in the way. it’s more 
satisfying to drop from the shadows, 
silently disembowel a sentry, and vanish. 
in fact, the more you work at it, 
the more rewarding the game gets. 
standard stealth practice means hiding 
behind a corner, observing a patrol 
route, then plucking up the courage to 
strike. not here. so sure are the tools 
at your disposal that you’ll be swinging 
down from a rooftop to gut a passing 
guard in plain sight before grappling 
back up, in one fluid, thrilling sequence.
 obi wan sHinobi 
that sense of a surplus of ideas 
extends beyond the storyline. after 
completing two different campaigns, 
there’s a third, featuring an unlikely 
bonus assassin named tesshu. He’s a 
doctor, which means that with his bare-
handed approach to evisceration, you 
get an X-ray view of the damage you’re 
dealing. and since tesshu is only in it for 
the cash, your stealth rating at the end 
of each mission is based on the coins 
you loot from each enemy. it also means 
you have to buy tesshu’s equipment.
these days tesshu would be part 
of a tasty slice of add-on content. as 
would yet another bonus: a mission 
that drops rikimaru into a modern-day 
setting in a neat play on the game’s 
opening cutscene. it’s a tantalising 
glimpse of where the series might have 
gone. aside from some so-so follow-
ups, we’re still waiting for tenchu to 
show itself once more. in the meantime, 
Wrath of Heaven holds up well.
Every month we celebrate the most important, 
innovative or just plain great games from 
PlayStation’s past. This month, we swap stun 
pistols and sticky cams for rancid rice cakes 
and kick-ass katanas.

P
laying a like slow-burning 
Russian novel, one of those 
hefty ones people pretend 
to read in coffee shops, and 
featuring a cast of characters 
who revel in their post-apocalyptic 
suffering, Metro Last Light was a hard 
sell when I could have been playing 
BioShock. This FPS enjoyed depressing 
me. So I stopped playing.
As time passed I always wondered 
what I was missing out on. Metro Redux 
is the perfect opportunity to answer 
any lingering questions. Remade 
for PS4, enhanced for PS4 Pro, and 
offering the original 2033 for the first 
time on PlayStation, it’s time I stopped 
moaning and embraced the dark 
descent into the series’ ice cold heart. 
While it’s still oppressive, and crawls 
along at a pace that would give The Last 
Of Us a shock, at least now the load 
times are improved. Also, playing 2033 
and Last Light together, back to back, 
helps make some sense of the complex 
lore plucked from the books it’s based 
on – a mix of urban fantasy and tense 
horror set inside Moscow’s crumbling 
underground metro tunnels.
In hindsight, developer 4A Games is a 
master of FPS mechanics – the simple 
act of needing to pump a portable 
battery to maintain light and power 
weapons ensures the cat-and-mouse 
gunfights have an edge few shooters 
have managed to match. Ultimately it’s 
the little things that stick, like being able 
to wipe blood from your visor to see 
what’s causing the red stuff to splatter.
Maybe I’ve grown patient, happy to 
lift my finger from the trigger as the 
game’s cotton-mouthed characters 
drone through their sombre exposition. 
Or maybe I’ve come to appreciate the 
tense encounters, bleak believable 
world, and innovative gunplay. It turns 
out I was missing out on a great game 
all along. Now that’s depressing.
Don’t like it. Never tried it. Every month we force 
one of our team to play their most feared game

person shooters can shine in VR. A mix of control 
choices, including the PS Aim controller, ensures 
Doom is as fast and fluid in VR as it’s ever been. 
Every PS VR owner needs this in their collection.
thumpeR
Make no mistake: the brave chrome beetle gave Rez 
a run for its money for our top spot. Hurtling down 
a violently kaleidoscopic track, pounding notes and 
scraping round corners is exquisitely tough – and the 
manic magic is enhanced and perfected in PS VR. 
Rigs: mechanized combat 
league
Mech-suited, shooter b-ball where you dunk yourself 
through the hoop? It might sound goofy, but it’s PS 
VR’s most elegant team sport. Potential nausea 
aside, this is the future of competitive gaming.

staR tRek: bRidge cRew
Mixes the fanboy fantasy of nestling in the Captain’s 
chair (or taking control of the helm, weapons, or 
engineering section) on a USS starship with the 
strongest co-op experience on PS VR. This is Star 
Trek’s finest hour on PlayStation.

weRewolves within
An ingenious mix of party game and paranoia-fuelled 
investigation, your group needs to chat to identify 
which of you is the werewolf. Getting the right mix of 
chums is essential, but you won’t even notice the full 
moon rising as you figure out who is the monster.
gnog
This puzzler doesn’t require PS VR to play, but hugely 
benefits from it. Giant floating heads hide gentle 
conundrums, and only by probing them can you 
discover their secrets. A vivid art style makes this 
already lovely treat feel all the more vibrant.
accounting +
One of PlayStation’s funniest games is a dark, 
twisted journey into the world of accounting. The 
game is an Inception-like dive into increasingly 
bizarre and frequently hilarious scenarios that will 
scratch the itch of any Rick And Morty fan.

the playRoom vR
No-one can resist a freebie, least of all when it’s this 
adorable. The Playroom robots return in a multiplayer 
mini-game collection designed for all, besting many 
premium titles with its quality. (Play ace platformer 
Robot Rescue; pray for a full-length sequel.)
the eldeR scRolls v: skyRim vR
Though compromises have been made to texture 
detail and controls, you get all of The Elder Scrolls V: 
Skyrim, including the expansions, inside PS VR. The 
scale and organic nature of the world at your feet 
overcomes any shortcomings.
FaRpoint
The sci-fi shooter is a brilliant showcase for the 
PS Aim controller, a versatile bit of kit that makes 
the satisfying range of weapons feel weighty and 
real. The game matches it, with a strong story and 
challenging co-op providing PS VR with its best FPS.

batman: aRkham vR
Not only is the training mission an unparalleled 
exercise in wish fulfilment (Wayne Manor! The 
Batcave! Batarangs!) but the defiantly sharp, if 
short, campaign is the epilogue to Arkham Knight we 
needed and deserved. Bats off to you, Rocksteady.

Rez inFinite
Fifteen years after the original’s release, the psychedelic rhythm 
rail shooter has achieved its final form. In PS VR, creator Tetsuya 
Mizuguchi’s vision becomes reality, the glittering polygonal trance-
world and pounding techno inspiring total synaesthesia within you. Its 
crowning achievement? New level Area X, powerful enough to bring 
players to tears. Deserving of its name, this is a truly timeless title.

Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD 
RemasteR
Two examples of JRPG royalty, lovingly 
restored to their former glory for your 
portable pleasure. Their new touch 
controls are – gasp! – a welcome addition. 
GRavity RusH
Use a gravity-defying cat to break the 
laws of physics and zoom across the 
skies of a floating steampunk city. With 
stylish comic-book looks and a sassy 
heroine, this is a rush to remember.
metal GeaR soliD  
HD collection
Two of PlayStation’s finest adventures 
scale down beautifully, with enough 
cutscenes to fill a transatlantic flight. 
Even less excuse not to play, then.

necRoDanceR 
Take Guitar Hero and Spelunky, then 
whack them in a blender. You’ll get this 
gem, with its addictive soundtrack and 
moreish rhythm-action monster-slaying.
peRsona 4: GolDen
This thoughtful and unique JRPG epic 
gives you another stab at high school  
– only this time with intrigue and 
superpowers instead of nerves, acne,  
and an unpredictable vocal register.

spelunKy
With more than a subtle nod of its fedora 
to a certain whip-wielding Dr Jones, 
Spelunky’s procedurally generated 
dungeons and platformer/roguelike 
mashup shines brightest on PS Vita.

steins;Gate
This mind-bending, tongue-in-cheek 
visual novel takes something as simple  
as a mobile phone and turns it into a time-
travelling extravaganza that’s fit to 
bursting with comedy and drama. 
velocity 2X
A ludicrously enjoyable puzzle/platformer 
hybrid that should come with a health 
warning. So joyous is the side-scroller’s 
twin-stick teleporting, there’s a danger 
you’ll smile your face clean off the bone.

Downwell
There’s an engrossing simplicity that 
powers Moppin’s surprise hit. All you can 
do is move left and right and fire your 
gunboots, yet hours later, we still can’t 
turn it off. Fair to say it’s gone down well.
uncHaRteD:  
GolDen abyss
Drake proves he’s just as adept at 
adventuring on the go. A prequel story 
plump with classic jungle action, and 
crammed full of typical Uncharted charm.
Hotline miami 
Part puzzler, part top-down  
murder-‘em-up that’s as brutal as almost 
anything else on PlayStation. It’s hard but 
never frustrating, with instant restarts 
and lightning-fast gameplay.

littlebiGplanet
Sackboy’s back, smaller but just as 
lovable as ever. His platforming antics 
work perfectly on Vita, and the new 
control inputs complement the level 
creator brilliantly. Also: d’awwww.
supeR meat boy!
The new music doesn’t match up to the 
classic tunes, but Meat Boy’s long-
awaited PlayStation debut is the finest, 
fleshiest twitch platformer of all. An 
essential, thumb-destroying masterpiece.

Rayman leGenDs
Rather than losing its lustre on the  
move to PS Vita, Ray’s second slice of 
sumptuous side-scrolling is even better 
on handheld. Touchscreen gestures make 
this fine platformer all the sweeter.

Peerless crafty platforming from Media Molecule, 
this time using PS Vita’s raft of touchscreen/
touchpad controls to surprise and delight you in 
new ways for hours on end. Full of whimsy, charm,

Tearaway’s papercraft world remains Vita’s most vibrant title.

Famous mute learns to yak in Jak II: Renegade
Celebrating PlayStation’s finest moments
T
here are plenty of famous 
silent protagonists on 
PlayStation: Gordon 
Freeman; Claude from 
GTA III; and, for a little while, Jak. 
His furry pal Daxter did enough 
talking for the both of them in 
their debut, The Precursor Legacy, 
where Jak’s silence came across 
as determined rather than angsty. 
For the first few moments in his 
sequel, that looks like it’ll continue… 
Until all the torture has him 
threatening murder. 
Dropping during PS2’s infamous 
“moody” period (when Prince Of 
Persia went emo and Shadow 
The Hedgehog actually happened), 
Jak II shifts into the angst with 
surprising ease. While the action 
begins in the beachy Sandover 
Village, Jak and Daxter quickly 
find themselves hurtling through 
a portal that dumps them in 
grotty Haven City. There’s no 
hospitality on their arrival as Jak 
is immediately captured by the 
Krimson guard and spends the 
next two years being pumped 
full of a substance called ‘Dark 
Eco’. Seriously, you’re not even 
five minutes into the game and 
the hero has spent 24 months in 
horrific distress. 
It’s a good job comedy relief 
Daxter – who is both unbelievably 
competent and unable to shut 
up – is here to save him. Freeing 
him from his restraints, he asks 
his buddy to say something and 
we finally hear what Jak has on his 
mind: “I’m going to kill Praxis.” 
It’s intentionally jarring, even 
though it’s not an unreasonable 
demand. But to watch Jak morph 
from a green-quiffed hero 
into a vengeful monster within 
one sentence is astonishing. 
Fortunately, his loose lips don’t 
distract from what is one of the 
best platformers on PS2. ■
