device. For more information, see Types of Internet Access. 
 
Types of Internet Access 
The types of Internet access available are as follows: 
 
PPP Internet access – your device uses a Point to Point 
Protocol (PPP) to carry data between your ISP and your 
computer. To use PPP Internet access, you must enter a 
PPP login username and password the first time to log 
on. The IP addresses required to access your ISP’s 
Internet service are automatically configured. 
Your device supports PPPoE (over Ethernet). 
 
PPP Internet access – your device uses a Point to Point 
Protocol (PPP) to carry data between your ISP and your 
computer. To use PPP Internet access, you must enter a 
PPP login username and password the first time to log 
on. The IP addresses required to access your ISP’s 
Internet service are automatically configured. 
Your device supports PPPoA (over ATM). 


Configuring your PPPoE DSL connection 
If your ISP’s Internet service uses PPPoE you need to set up a 
PPP login account. The first time that you login to the Internet, 
your ISP will ask you to enter a username and password so 
they can check that you are a legitimate, registered Internet 
service user. Your device stores these authentication details, so 
you will not have to enter this username and password every 
time you login. 
Your ISP may also tell you to set unique path and circuit 
numbers (called VPI and VCI) in order to connect your device to 
the ISP’s Internet service. In most cases, your device will use 
default settings, so you may not need to enter these values. 
 
Note 
 
Your ISP will provide you with the login details and VPI/VCI 
values necessary to set up a PPP login account. 
If your ISP wants you to connect to the Internet using PPP,

WPA/WPA2/WPA2 Mixed + Personal (Pre-Shared Key) 
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a class of systems to secure 
wireless (Wi-Fi) computer networks. WPA/WPA2 implements 
the full standard, but will not work with some older network 
cards. Both provide good security, with two significant issues:    
 
WPA/WPA2 must be enabled and chosen in preference to 
WEP. WEP is usually presented as the first security choice 
in most installation instructions.  
 
In the "Personal" mode, the most likely choice for homes 
and small offices, a pass phrase is required that, for full 
security, must be longer than the typical 6 to 8 character 
passwords users are taught to employ.

Access Control 
For security reason, using MAC ACL's (MAC Address Access 
List) creates another level of difficulty to hacking a network. A 
MAC ACL is created and distributed to AP so that only 
authorized NIC's can connect to the network. While MAC 
address spoofing is a proven means to hacking a network this 
can be used in conjunction with additional security measures to 
increase the level of complexity of the network security 
decreasing the chance of a breach.  
MAC addresses can be add/delete/edit from the ACL list 
depending on the MAC Access Policy. 
On this page you can allow or deny access to your wireless 
network based off the clients MAC address. Choose "Allowed 
Listed" and only the clients whose MAC addresses are in the

Shared Key: Shared Key is only available if the WEP 
option is implemented. Shared Key authentication 
supports authentication of clients as either a member 
of those who know a shared secret key or a member of 
those who do not. IEEE 802.11 Shared Key 
authentication accomplishes this without the need to 
transmit the secret key in clear. Requiring the use of 
the WEP privacy mechanism. 
Auto: Auto is the default authentication algorithm. It 
will change its authentication type automatically to fulfill 
client’s requirement. 
Fragment 
Threshold 
When transmitting a packet over a network medium, 
sometimes the packet is broken into several segments, 
if the size of packet exceeds that allowed by the 
network medium.    
The Fragmentation Threshold defines the number of 
bytes used for the fragmentation boundary for directed 
messages.  
This value should remain at its default setting of 2346. 
It specifies the maximum size for a packet before data 
is fragmented into multiple packets. If you experience a 
high packet error rate, you may slightly increases the 
“Fragment Threshold” value within the value range of 
256 to 2346. Setting this value too low may result in 
poor network performance. Only minor modifications of 
this value are recommended. 
RTS Threshold 
This value should remain at its default setting of 2347. 
Should you encounter inconsistent data flow, only 
minor modifications are recommended. If a network 
packet is smaller than the preset “RTS threshold” size, 
the RTS/CTS mechanism will not be enabled. The 
ADSL modem (or AP) sends Request to Send (RTS) 
frames to a particular receiving station and negotiates 
the sending of a data frame. After receiving an RTS, 
the wireless station responds with a Clear to Send 
(CTS) frame to acknowledge the right to begin 
transmission. 
Beacon Interval 
The Beacon Interval value indicates the frequency 
interval of the beacon. Enter a value between 20 and 
1024. A beacon is a packet broadcast by the ADSL 
modem (or AP) to synchronize the wireless network. 
The default is 100. 
DTIM Interval 
Specify the DTIM Interval 
Data Rate 
The rate of data transmission should be set depending 
on the speed of your wireless network. You should 
select from a range of transmission speeds, or you can 
select Auto to have the ADSL modem (or AP) 
automatically use the fastest possible data rate and 
enable the Auto-Fallback feature. Auto-Fallback will 
negotiate the best possible connection speed between 
the AP and a wireless client. The default setting is 
Auto.

WPS 
Introduction of WPS 
Although home Wi-Fi networks have become more and more 
popular, users still have trouble with the initial set up of network. 
This obstacle forces users to use the open security and 
increases the risk of eavesdropping. Therefore, WPS is 
designed to ease set up of security-enabled Wi-Fi networks and 
subsequently network management (Wi-Fi Protected Setup 
Specification 1.0h.pdf, p. 8). 
The largest difference between WPS-enabled devices and 
legacy devices is that users do not need the knowledge about 
SSID, channel and security settings, but they could still surf in a 
security-enabled Wi-Fi network. For examples, in the initial 
network set up, if users want to use the PIN configuration, the 
only thing they need to do is entering the device PIN into 
registrar, starting the PIN method on that device and simply wait 
until the device joins the network. After the PIN method is 
started on both sides, a registration protocol will be initiated 
between the registrar and the enrollee. Typically, a registrar 
could be an access point or other device that is capable of 
managing the network. An enrollee could be an access point or 
a station that will join the network. After the registration protocol 
has been done, the enrollee will receive SSID and security 
settings from the registrar and then join the network. In other 
words; if a station attempts to join a network managed by an 
access point with built-in internal registrar, users will need to 
enter station’s PIN into the web page of that access point. If the 
device PIN is correct and valid and users start PIN on station, 
the access point and the station will automatically exchange the 
encrypted information of the network settings under the 
management of AP’s internal registrar. The station then uses 
this information to perform authentication algorithm, join the 
secure network, and transmit data with the encryption algorithm. 
More details will be demonstrated in the following sections. 
 
Supported WPS features 
Currently, Wireless Gateway supports WPS features for AP 
mode, AP+WDS mode, Infrastructure-Client mode, and the 
wireless root interface of Universal Repeater mode.  
Other modes such as WDS mode, Infrastructure-Adhoc 
mode, and the wireless virtual interface of Universal 
Repeater mode are not implemented with WPS features. 
If those unsupported modes are enforced by users, WPS 
will be disabled. Under the configuration of every WPS-
supported mode, Wireless Gateway has Push Button method 
and PIN method. For each method, Wireless Gateway offers 
different security levels included in network credential, such as 
open security, WEP 64 bits, WEP 128 bits, WPA2-Personal 
TKIP, and WPA2-Personal AES. Users could choose either one 
of the methods at their convenience.

AP mode  
For AP mode, Wireless Gateway supports three roles, registrar, 
proxy, and enrollee in registration protocol. At different 
scenarios, Wireless Gateway will automatically switch to an 
appropriate role depending on the other device’s role or a 
specific configuration. 
 
AP as Enrollee  
If users know AP’s PIN and enter it into external registrar, the 
external registrar will configure AP with a new wireless profile 
such as new SSID and new security settings. The external 
registrar does this job either utilizing the in-band EAP (wireless) 
or out-of-band UPnP (Ethernet). During the WPS handshake, a 
wireless profile is encrypted and transmitted to AP. If the 
handshake is successfully done, AP will be re-initialized with the 
new wireless profile and wait for legacy stations or WPS 
stations to join its network. 
 
AP as Registrar 
Wireless Gateway also has a built-in internal registrar. 
Whenever users enter station’s PIN into AP’s webpage, click 
“Start PBC”, or push the physical button, AP will switch to 
registrar automatically. If users apply the same method on 
station side and the WPS handshake is successfully done, 
SSID and security settings will be transmitted to that station 
without the risk of eavesdropping. And then the station will 
associate with AP in a security-enabled network. 
 
AP as Proxy 
At this state, AP is transparent to users. If users want to 
configure a station or any device that is capable of being an 
enrollee, they have to enter device’s PIN into an external 
registrar and choose an appropriate wireless profile. After the 
PIN is entered, the external registrar will inform AP this event. 
AP then conveys the encrypted wireless profile between the 
device and the external registrar. Finally, the device will use the 
wireless profile and associate with AP. However, the device 
may connect to other APs if the wireless profile does not belong 
to the proxy AP. Users must carefully choose the wireless 
profile or create a wireless profile on an external registrar. 
 
Infrastructure-Client mode 
In Infrastructure-Client mode, Wireless Gateway only supports 
enrollee’s role. If users click “Start PIN”, click “Start PBC”, or 
press the physical button on Wireless Gateway, it will start to 
seek WPS AP. Once users apply the same method on registrar 
side, Wireless Gateway will receive the wireless profile upon 
successfully doing the registration protocol. Then Wireless 
Gateway will associate with an AP.

Instructions of AP’s and Client’s operations 
At this state, AP is transparent to users. If users want to 
configure a station or any device that is capable of being an 
enrollee, they have to enter device’s PIN into an external 
registrar and choose an appropriate wireless profile. After the 
PIN is entered, the external registrar will inform AP this event. 
AP then conveys the encrypted wireless profile between the 
device and the external registrar. Finally, the device will use the 
wireless profile and associate with AP. However, the device 
may connect to other APs if the wireless profile does not belong 
to the proxy AP. Users must carefully choose the wireless 
profile or create a wireless profile on an external registrar.

handshake. According to the WPS spec, AP will create a 
wireless profile with WPA2-mixed mode and a random-
generated key upon successfully doing the WPS handshake. 
However, AP will use the original wireless profile and give it to 
the station if AP is already in configured state. That means all 
settings of AP will not change. Hence, all WPS related pages 
keep the same.

Push Button method  
Wireless Gateway supports a virtual button “Start PBC” on the 
Wi-Fi Protected Setup page for Push Button method. If users 
push a virtual button “Start PBC”, AP will initiate a WPS session 
and wait for any station to join. At this moment, AP will detect 
whether there is more than one station that starts the PBC 
method. When multiple PBC sessions occur, users should try 
PIN method. 
After users push AP’s virtual button “Start PBC”, they must go to 
station side to push its button within two minutes. If the WPS is 
successfully done, AP will give its wireless profile to that station. 
The station could use this profile to associate with AP. 
1. From the left-hand WLAN -> WPS menu. The following 
page is displayed: 
2. Make sure AP is in un-configured state.

14 Routing 
The Routing page enables you to define specific route for your 
Internet and network data. 
Most users do not need to define routes. On a typical small 
home or office LAN, the existing routes that set up the default 
gateways for your LAN hosts and for the DSL device provide 
the most appropriate path for all your Internet traffic. 
−On your LAN hosts, a default gateway directs all Internet traffic 
to the LAN port(s) on the DSL device. Your LAN hosts know 
their default gateway either because you assigned it to them 
when you modified your TCP/IP properties, or because you 
configured them to receive the information dynamically from a 
server whenever they access the Internet. 
−On the DSL device itself, a default gateway is defined to direct 
all outbound Internet traffic to a route at your ISP. The default 
gateway is assigned either automatically by your ISP whenever 
the device negotiates an Internet access, or manually by user to 
setup through the configuration. 
You may need to define routes if your home setup includes two 
or more networks or subnets, if you connect to two or more ISP 
services, or if you connect to a remote corporate LAN.

all zeros to indicate that this route should be used for 
all destinations for which no other route is defined (this 
is the route that creates the default gateway). 
Subnet Mask 
The network mask of the destination subnet. The 
default gateway uses a mask of 0.0.0.0. 
Next Hop 
The IP address of the next hop through which traffic 
will flow towards the destination subnet. 
Metric

RIP 
RIP is an Internet protocol you can set up to share routing table 
information with other routing devices on your LAN, at your 
ISP’s location, or on remote networks connected to your 
network via the ADSL line. 
Most small home or office networks do not need to use RIP; 
they have only one Router,such as the ADSL Router, and one 
path to an ISP. In these cases, there is no need to share routes, 
because all Internet data from the network is sent to the same 
ISP gateway. 
You may want to configure RIP if any of the following 
circumstances apply to your network: 
−Your home network setup includes an additional Router or 
RIP-enabled PC (other than the ADSL Router). The ADSL 
Router and the Router will need to communicate via RIP to 
share their routing tables. 
−Your network connects via the ADSL line to a remote network, 
such as a corporate network. In order for your LAN to learn the 
routes used within your corporate network, they should both be 
configured with RIP. 
−Your ISP requests that you run RIP for communication with 
devices on their network.

15 DMZ 
A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a host or small network that acts 
as neutral ground between the inside and outside network. It 
contains information that is useful to users of both the inside 
and outside network. For example, a company may wish to 
provide software patches to customers via an FTP server. 
However, it does not want FTP access to any hosts other than 
the FTP server. This is achieved by creating a DMZ network 
which is less restrictive than the internal network.Users attached 
to the outside network can access the DMZ, but they cannot 
access any other company data. 
Configuring DMZ

16 Virtual Server 
Your device has built in advanced Security features that protect 
your network by blocking unwanted traffic from the Internet.  
If you simply want to connect from your local network to the 
Internet, you do not need to make any changes to the default 
Security configuration. You only need to edit the configuration if 
you wish to do one or both of the following: 
 
allow Internet users to browse the user pages on your local 
network (for example, by providing an FTP or HTTP server) 
 
play certain games which require accessibility from the 
Internet 
This chapter describes how to configure Security to suit the 
needs of your network.  
By default, the IP addresses of your LAN PCs are hidden from 
the Internet. All data sent from your LAN PCs to a PC on the 
Internet appears to come from the IP address of your device.  
In this way, details about your LAN PCs remain private. This 
security feature is called Port Forwarding. 
Configuring Virtual Server 
Certain network games, chat or file sharing software do not 
work with your default Port Forwarding setting. Your device 
knows the port, protocol and trigger information needed to allow 
access to the common applications listed below, but by default, 
access to them is disabled.

25 Port Mapping 
The DSL device provides multiple interface groups. Up to five 
interface groups are supported including one default group. The 
LAN and WAN interfaces could be included. Traffic coming from 
one interface of a group can only be flowed to the interfaces in 
the same interface group. Thus, the DSL device can isolate 
traffic from group to group for some application. By default, all 
the interfaces (LAN and WAN) belong to the default group, and 
the other four groups are all empty. It is possible to assign any 
interface to any group but only one group.

32 UPnP 
UPnP is an architecture for pervasive peer-to-peer network 
connectivity of intelligent appliances, Wireless devices, and PCs 
of all form factors. It is designed to bring easy-to-use, flexible, 
standards-based connectivity to ad-hoc or unmanaged 
networks whether in the home, in a small business, public 
spaces, or attached to the Internet. UPnP is a distributed, open 
networking architecture that leverages TCP/IP and the Web 
technologies to enable seamless proximity networking in 
addition to control and data transfer among networked devices 
in the home, office, and public spaces. 
UPnP is more than just a simple extension of the plug and play 
peripheral model. It is designed to support zero-configuration, 
"invisible" networking, and automatic discovery for a breadth of 
device categories from a wide range of vendors. This means a 
device can dynamically join a network, obtain an IP address, 
convey its capabilities, and learn about the presence and 
capabilities of other devices. DHCP and DNS servers are 
optional and are used only if available on the network. Finally, a 
device can leave a network smoothly and automatically without 
leaving any unwanted state behind. 
The DSL device supports a control point for Universal Plug and 
Play (UPnP) version 1.0, and supports two key features: NAT 
Traversal and Device Identification. This feature requires one 
active WAN interface. In addition, the host should support this 
feature. In the presence of multiple WAN interfaces, select an 
interface on which the incoming traffic is present. 
With NAT Traversal, when an UPnP command is received to 
open ports in NAT, the application translates the request into 
system commands to open the ports in NAT and the firewall. 
The interface to open the ports on is given to UPnP when it 
starts up and is part of the configuration of the application. 
For Device Identification, the application will send a description 
of the DSL device as a control point back to the host making the 
request.

cannot use the Windows XP Internet Connection Firewall 
support on a system that you intend to use as a UPnP control 
point. If this feature is enabled, although the control point 
system may display controlled devices in the list of network 
devices, the control point system cannot participate in UPnP 
communication. (This restriction also applies to controlled 
devices running on Windows XP systems earlier than SP2.)   
On Windows XP SP2 and later, Firewall support is provided by 
Windows Firewall. Unlike earlier versions, Windows XP SP2 
can be used on a system that you intend to use as a UPnP 
control point. 
To turn off the Firewall capability on any version of Windows 
XP, follow the steps below: 
1. In the Control Panel, select "Network and Internet 
Connections". 
2. In the "Network and Internet Connections" dialog box, select

35 Dynamic DNS Configuration 
Overview of Dynamic DNS 
If some host has a dynamic IP address that keeps changing 
frequently, it is difficult to keep updating the IP record that is 
associated with the domain name of this host in the zone files. 
This will result in non-accessibility of this host on the Internet. 
Dynamic DNS service allows to keep mapping of a dynamic IP 
address of such host to a static hostname. Dynamic DNS  
services are provided by many websites. The host needs to 
register with some website and get a domain name. When the 
IP address of the host changes, it just needs to send a message 
to the website that's providing dynamic DNS service to this host. 
For this to work, an automated update client needs to be 
implemented. These update clients send update messages to 
the servers whenever there is some change in the IP address of 
that host. Then, the server updates the entries for that host and 
replies back with some return code. 
 
 
 
Above Figure explains one such scenario in which a host gets a 
dynamic IP address for itself from a DHCP server. As the host 
has registered with one of the dynamic DNS service providers 
on the Internet, it sends an update message to the service 
provider with host name and changed IP address. The service 
provider updates the new IP address of the host in the zone 
files that have entry for that host name and replies back with 
some return code. The return code communicates the success 
or failure of the update message. This process is repeated 
every time the host's IP address changes. 
If the dynamic DNS service provider is notified of the same IP 
address again and again, then it considers it an abuse and 
might block the host name. To avoid this scenario, the IP 
address that was successfully updated to the ISP is stored on 
the unit. Whenever we receive an IP address change 
notification, the new IP address is compared with the IP address 
that was stored on the last update. If they differ, then only an 

User’s Guide  
Configuring your Computers 
 
157
update request is sent. However, when the system comes up 
there is no way of knowing what was the IP address on last  
successful update before the system went down. You need to 
give the command “system config save“ periodically to save this 
IP address on Flash. 
 
Registering With Dynamic DNS Service Provider 
Currently, Wireless ADSL Router RTA01N supports two 
Dynamic DNS service providers, www.tzo.com and 
www.dyndns.com. To use their Dynamic DNS service, you first 
need to visit the Web site of a service provider and register. 
While registering, you need to provide your username, 
password, and hostname as mandatory parameters. A service 
provider may also prompt you to fill some optional parameters. 
 
Configuring IP Interfaces 
You need to create a Dynamic DNS interface per IP interface 
and can only create one Dynamic DNS interface service on one 
IP interface. For more information on creating IP interfaces,  
refer to section Creating IP interfaces. 
 
 
Note 
 
www.dyndns.org provides three kinds of services - Dynamic DNS, 
Custom DNS and Static DNS. You can create different domains in 
these systems. Custom DNS service is a full DNS solution for 
newly purchased domains or domains you already own. A web-
based interface provides complete control over resource records 
and your entire domain, including support for dynamic IPs and 
automated updates. Static DNS service points a DNS hostname 
in some domain owned by dyndns.org to the user's ISP-assigned 
static or pseudo-static IP address.  
DynDNS service points a fixed hostname in some domain owned 
by dyndns.org to the user's ISP-assigned dynamic IP address. 
This allows more frequent update of IP addresses, than allowed 
by Static DNS.

The DSL device supports some useful diagnostic tools. 
Ping 
Once you have your DSL device configured, it is a good idea to 
make sure you can ping the network. A ping command sends a 
message to the host you specify. If the host receives the 
message, it sends messages in reply. To use it, you must know

ATM Loopback 
In order to isolate the ATM interface problems, you can use 
ATM OAM loopback cells to verify connectivity between VP/VC 
endpoints, as well as segment endpoints within the VP/VC. 
ATM uses F4 and F5 cell flows as follows: 
−F4: used in VPs 
−F5: used in VCs 
 
An ATM connection consists of a group of points. This OAM 
implementation provides management for the following points: 
−Connection endpoint: the end of a VP/VC connection where 
the ATM cell are terminated 
−Segment endpoint: the end of a connection segment 
 
This page allows you to use ATM ping, which generates F5 
segment and end-to-end loop-back cells to test the reachability 
of a segment endpoint or a connection endpoint.

Assigning static Internet information to your PCs 
If you are a typical user, you will not need to assign static 
Internet information to your LAN PCs because your ISP 
automatically assigns this information for you.  
In some cases however, you may want to assign Internet 
information to some or all of your PCs directly (often called 
“statically”), rather than allowing the Wireless ADSL Router 
RTA01N to assign it. This option may be desirable (but not 
required) if: 
 
You have obtained one or more public IP addresses that 
you want to always associate with specific computers (for 
example, if you are using a computer as a public web 
server). 
 
You maintain different subnets on your LAN (subnets are 
described in Appendix B). 
Before you begin, you must have the following information 
available: 
 
The IP address and subnet mask of each PC  
 
The IP address of the default gateway for your LAN. In 
most cases, this is the address assigned to the LAN port on 
the Wireless ADSL Router RTA01N. By default, the LAN 
port is assigned the IP address 192.168.1.1. (You can 
change this number or another number can be assigned by 
your ISP. See Addressing for more information.) 
 
The IP address of your ISP’s Domain Name System (DNS) 
server. 
On each PC to which you want to assign static information, 
follow the instructions relating only to checking for and/or 
installing the IP protocol. Once it is installed, continue to follow 
the instructions for displaying each of the Internet Protocol 
(TCP/IP) properties. Instead of enabling dynamic assignment of 
the IP addresses for the computer, DNS server and default 
gateway, click the radio buttons that enable you to enter the 
information manually. 
 
Note 
Your PCs must have IP addresses that place them in the same 
subnet as the Wireless ADSL Router RTA01N’s LAN port. If you 
manually assign IP information to all your LAN PCs, you can follow 
the instructions in Addressing to change the LAN port IP address 
accordingly.

IP Addresses 
 
Note 
This section refers only to IP addresses for IPv4 (version 4 of the 
Internet Protocol). IPv6 addresses are not covered. 
This section assumes basic knowledge of binary numbers, bits, 
and bytes. 
IP addresses, the Internet's version of telephone numbers, are 
used to identify individual nodes (computers or devices) on the 
Internet. Every IP address contains four numbers, each from 0 
to 255 and separated by dots (periods), e.g. 20.56.0.211. These 
numbers are called, from left to right, field1, field2, field3, and 
field4. 
This style of writing IP addresses as decimal numbers 
separated by dots is called dotted decimal notation. The IP 
address 20.56.0.211 is read "twenty dot fifty-six dot zero dot 
two-eleven." 
Structure of an IP address 
IP addresses have a hierarchical design similar to that of 
telephone numbers. For example, a 7-digit telephone number 
starts with a 3-digit prefix that identifies a group of thousands of 
telephone lines, and ends with four digits that identify one 
specific line in that group.  
Similarly, IP addresses contain two kinds of information: 
 
Network ID 
Identifies a particular network within the Internet or intranet 
 
Host ID 
Identifies a particular computer or device on the network 
The first part of every IP address contains the network ID, and 
the rest of the address contains the host ID. The length of the 
network ID depends on the network's class (see following 
section). The table below shows the structure of an IP address. 
 
Field1 
Field2 
Field3 
Field4 
Class A 
Network ID 
Host ID 
Class B 
Network ID 
Host ID 
Class C 
Network ID 
Host ID 
Here are some examples of valid IP addresses: 
Class A: 10.30.6.125 (network = 10, host = 30.6.125) 
Class B: 129.88.16.49 (network = 129.88, host = 16.49) 
Class C: 192.60.201.11 (network = 192.60.201, host = 11) 
Network classes 
The three commonly used network classes are A, B, and C. 
(There is also a class D but it has a special use beyond the 

User’s Guide  
IP Addresses, Network Masks, and Subnets 
 
201
scope of this discussion.) These classes have different uses 
and characteristics.  
Class A networks are the Internet's largest networks, each with 
room for over 16 million hosts. Up to 126 of these huge 
networks can exist, for a total of over 2 billion hosts. Because of 
their huge size, these networks are used for WANs and by 
organizations at the infrastructure level of the Internet, such as 
your ISP. 
Class B networks are smaller but still quite large, each able to 
hold over 65,000 hosts. There can be up to 16,384 class B 
networks in existence. A class B network might be appropriate 
for a large organization such as a business or government 
agency. 
Class C networks are the smallest, only able to hold 254 hosts 
at most, but the total possible number of class C networks 
exceeds 2 million (2,097,152 to be exact). LANs connected to 
the Internet are usually class C networks. 
Some important notes regarding IP addresses: 
 
The class can be determined easily from field1: 
field1 = 1-126: 
Class A 
field1 = 128-191: 
Class B 
field1 = 192-223: 
Class C 
(field1 values not shown are reserved for special uses) 
 
A host ID can have any value except all fields set to 0 or all 
fields set to 255, as those values are reserved for special 
uses. 
Subnet masks 
 
Definition 
mask 
A mask looks like a regular IP address, but contains a pattern of 
bits that tells what parts of an IP address are the network ID and 
what parts are the host ID: bits set to 1 mean "this bit is part of the 
network ID" and bits set to 0 mean "this bit is part of the host ID." 
Subnet masks are used to define subnets (what you get after 
dividing a network into smaller pieces). A subnet's network ID is 
created by "borrowing" one or more bits from the host ID portion 
of the address. The subnet mask identifies these host ID bits. 
For example, consider a class C network 192.168.1. To split this 
into two subnets, you would use the subnet mask: 
255.255.255.128 
It's easier to see what's happening if we write this in binary:  
11111111. 11111111. 11111111.10000000 
As with any class C address, all of the bits in field1 through 
field3 are part of the network ID, but note how the mask 
specifies that the first bit in field4 is also included. Since this 
extra bit has only two values (0 and 1), this means there are two 
subnets. Each subnet uses the remaining 7 bits in field4 for its 
host IDs, which range from 1 to 126 hosts (instead of the usual 
0 to 255 for a class C address). 
Similarly, to split a class C network into four subnets, the mask 
is: 

User’s Guide  
IP Addresses, Network Masks, and Subnets 
 
202
255.255.255.192    or    11111111. 11111111. 
11111111.11000000 
The two extra bits in field4 can have four values (00, 01, 10, 11), 
so there are four subnets. Each subnet uses the remaining six 
bits in field4 for its host IDs, ranging from 1 to 62. 
 
 
Note 
Sometimes a subnet mask does not specify any additional 
network ID bits, and thus no subnets. Such a mask is called a 
default subnet mask. These masks are: 
Class A: 
255.0.0.0 
Class B: 
255.255.0.0 
Class C: 
255.255.255.0 
These are called default because they are used when a network is 
initially configured, at which time it has no subnets.

ping 
Ping is a command you can use to check whether your PC can 
recognize other computers on your network and the Internet. A 
ping command sends a message to the computer you specify. If 
the computer receives the message, it sends messages in 
reply. To use it, you must know the IP address of the computer 
with which you are trying to communicate.  
On Windows-based computers, you can execute a ping 
command from the Start menu. Click the Start button, and then 
click Run. In the Open text box, type a statement such as the 
following: 
ping 192.168.1.1 
Click OK. You can substitute any private IP address on your 
LAN or a public IP address for an Internet site, if known.  
If the target computer receives the message, a Command 
Prompt window is displayed: 
 
Figure 12: 
Using the ping Utility 
If the target computer cannot be located, you will receive the 
message Request timed out. 
Using the ping command, you can test whether the path to the 
Wireless ADSL Router RTA01N is working (using the 
preconfigured default LAN IP address 192.168.1.1) or another 
address you assigned. 
You can also test whether access to the Internet is working by 
typing an external address, such as that for www.yahoo.com 
(216.115.108.243). If you do not know the IP address of a 
particular Internet location, you can use the nslookup command, 
as explained in the following section. 
From most other IP-enabled operating systems, you can 
execute the same command at a command prompt or through a 
system administration utility.

nslookup 
You can use the nslookup command to determine the IP 
address associated with an Internet site name. You specify the 
common name, and the nslookup command looks up the name 
in on your DNS server (usually located with your ISP). If that 
name is not an entry in your ISP’s DNS table, the request is 
then referred to another higher-level server, and so on, until the 
entry is found. The server then returns the associated IP 
address. 
On Windows-based computers, you can execute the nslookup 
command from the Start menu. Click the Start button, and then 
click Run. In the Open text box, type the following: 
Nslookup 
Click OK. A Command Prompt window displays with a bracket

10BASE-T 
A designation for the type of wiring used by Ethernet 
networks with a data rate of 10 Mbps. Also known as 
Category 3 (CAT 3) wiring. See data rate, Ethernet. 
100BASE-T 
A designation for the type of wiring used by Ethernet 
networks with a data rate of 100 Mbps. Also known as 
Category 5 (CAT 5) wiring. See data rate, Ethernet. 
ADSL 
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line 
The most commonly deployed "flavor" of DSL for home users 
is asymmetrical DSL. The term asymmetrical refers to its 
unequal data rates for downloading and uploading (the 
download rate is higher than the upload rate). The 
asymmetrical rates benefit home users because they 
typically download much more data from the Internet than 
they upload. 
analog 
An analog signal is a signal that has had its frequency 
modified in some way, such as by amplifying its strength or 
varying its frequency, in order to add information to the 
signal. The voice component in DSL is an analog signal. See 
digital. 
ATM 
Asynchronous Transfer Mode 
A standard for high-speed transmission of data, text, voice, 
and video, widely used within the Internet. ATM data rates 
range from 45 Mbps to 2.5 Gbps. See data rate. 
authenticate 
To verify a user’s identity, such as by prompting for a 
password. 
binary 
The "base two" system of numbers, that uses only two digits, 
0 and 1, to represent all numbers. In binary, the number 1 is 
written as 1, 2 as 10, 3 as 11, 4 as 100, etc. Although 
expressed as decimal numbers for convenience, IP 
addresses in actual use are binary numbers; e.g., the IP 
address 209.191.4.240 is 
11010001.10111111.00000100.11110000 in binary. See bit, 
IP address, network mask. 
bit 
Short for "binary digit," a bit is a number that can have two 
values, 0 or 1. See binary. 
bps 
bits per second 
bridging 
Passing data from your network to your ISP and vice versa 
using the hardware addresses of the devices at each 
location. Bridging contrasts with routing, which can add more 
intelligence to data transfers by using network addresses 
instead. The Wireless ADSL Router RTA01N can perform 
both routing and bridging. Typically, when both functions are 
enabled, the device routes IP data and bridges all other 
types of data. See routing. 
broadband 
A telecommunications technology that can send different 
types of data over the same medium. DSL is a broadband 
technology. 
broadcast 
To send data to all computers on a network.

DHCP 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
DHCP automates address assignment and management. 
When a computer connects to the LAN, DHCP assigns it an 
IP address from a shared pool of IP addresses; after a 
specified time limit, DHCP returns the address to the pool. 
DHCP relay 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol relay 
A DHCP relay is a computer that forwards DHCP data 
between computers that request IP addresses and the DHCP 
server that assigns the addresses. Each of the Wireless 
ADSL Router RTA01N's interfaces can be configured as a 
DHCP relay. See DHCP. 
DHCP server

digital 
Of data, having a form based on discrete values expressed 
as binary numbers (0's and 1's). The data component in DSL 
is a digital signal. See analog. 
DNS 
Domain Name System  
The DNS maps domain names into IP addresses. DNS 
information is distributed hierarchically throughout the 
Internet among computers called DNS servers. For example, 
www.yahoo.com is the domain name associated with IP 
address 216.115.108.243. When you start to access a web 
site, a DNS server looks up the requested domain name to 
find its corresponding IP address. If the DNS server cannot 
find the IP address, it communicates with higher-level DNS 
servers to determine the IP address. See domain name. 
domain name 
A domain name is a user-friendly name used in place of its 
associated IP address. Domain names must be unique; their 
assignment is controlled by the Internet Corporation for 
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Domain names are 
a key element of URLs, which identify a specific file at a web 
site. See DNS. 
download 
To transfer data in the downstream direction, i.e., from the 
Internet to the user.

Internet Protocol address 
The address of a host (computer) on the Internet, consisting 
of four numbers, each from 0 to 255, separated by periods, 
e.g., 209.191.4.240. An IP address consists of a network ID 
that identifies the particular network the host belongs to, and 
a host ID uniquely identifying the host itself on that network. 
A network mask is used to define the network ID and the 
host ID. Because IP addresses are difficult to remember, 
they usually have an associated domain name that can be 
specified instead. See domain name, network mask.

them to communicate with each other and share resources, 
such as software, files, etc. A network can be small, such as 
a LAN, or very large, such as the Internet. 
network mask 
A network mask is a sequence of bits applied to an IP 
address to select the network ID while ignoring the host ID. 
Bits set to 1 mean "select this bit" while bits set to 0 mean 
"ignore this bit." For example, if the network mask 
255.255.255.0 is applied to the IP address 100.10.50.1, the 
network ID is 100.10.50, and the host ID is 1. See binary, IP 
address, subnet. 
NIC 
Network Interface Card 
An adapter card that plugs into your computer and provides 
the physical interface to your network cabling. For Ethernet 
NICs this is typically an RJ-45 connector. See Ethernet, RJ-
45. 
packet 
Data transmitted on a network consists of units called 
packets. Each packet contains a payload (the data), plus 
overhead information such as where it came from (source 
address) and where it should go (destination address). 
ping

Router, through which data flows into and out of the device. 
PPP 
Point-to-Point Protocol 
A protocol for serial data transmission that is used to carry IP 
(and other protocol) data between your ISP and your 
computer. The WAN interface on the Wireless ADSL Router 
RTA01N uses two forms of PPP called PPPoA and PPPoE. 
See PPPoA, PPPoE. 
PPPoA 
Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM 
One of the two types of PPP interfaces you can define for a 
Virtual Circuit (VC), the other type being PPPoE. You can 
define only one PPPoA interface per VC. 
PPPoE

One of the two types of PPP interfaces you can define for a 
Virtual Circuit (VC), the other type being PPPoA. You can 
define one or more PPPoE interfaces per VC. 
protocol 
A set of rules governing the transmission of data. In order for 
a data transmission to work, both ends of the connection 
have to follow the rules of the protocol. 
remote

machines, modems, etc. to a telephone port. It is a 6-pin 
connector usually containing four wires. 
RJ-45 
Registered Jack Standard-45 
The 8-pin plug used in transmitting data over phone lines. 
Ethernet cabling usually uses this type of connector. 
routing

the most efficient route, based on the data’s destination IP 
address and current network conditions. A device that 
performs routing is called a Router. 
SDNS 
Secondary Domain Name System (server) 
A DNS server that can be used if the primary DSN server is 
not available. See DNS. 
subnet 
A subnet is a portion of a network. The subnet is 
distinguished from the larger network by a subnet mask that 
selects some of the computers of the network and excludes 
all others. The subnet's computers remain physically 
connected to the rest of the parent network, but they are 
treated as though they were on a separate network. See 
network mask. 
subnet mask 
A mask that defines a subnet. See network mask. 
TCP 
See TCP/IP. 
TCP/IP 
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol 
The basic protocols used on the Internet. TCP is responsible 
for dividing data up into packets for delivery and 
reassembling them at the destination, while IP is responsible 
for delivering the packets from source to destination. When 
TCP and IP are bundled with higher-level applications such 
as HTTP, FTP, Telnet, etc., TCP/IP refers to this whole suite 
of protocols. 
Telnet 
An interactive, character-based program used to access a 
remote computer. While HTTP (the web protocol) and FTP 
only allow you to download files from a remote computer, 
Telnet allows you to log into and use a computer from a 
remote location. 
TFTP 
Trivial File Transfer Protocol 
A protocol for file transfers, TFTP is easier to use than File 
Transfer Protocol (FTP) but not as capable or secure. 
TKIP 
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) provides WPA with a 
data encryption function. It ensures that a unique master key is 
generated for each packet, supports message integrity and 
sequencing rules and supports re-keying mechanisms.  
triggers 
Triggers are used to deal with application protocols that create 
separate sessions. Some applications, such as NetMeeting, 
open secondary connections during normal operations, for 
example, a connection to a server is established using one port, 
but data transfers are performed on a separate connection. A 
trigger tells the device to expect these secondary sessions and 
how to handle them. 
Once you set a trigger, the embedded IP address of each 
incoming packet is replaced by the correct host address so that 
NAT can translate packets to the correct destination. You can 
specify whether you want to carry out address replacement, and 
if so, whether to replace addresses on TCP packets only, UDP 
packets only, or both.

twisted pair 
The ordinary copper telephone wiring used by telephone 
companies. It contains one or more wire pairs twisted 
together to reduce inductance and noise. Each telephone 
line uses one pair. In homes, it is most often installed with 
two pairs. For Ethernet LANs, a higher grade called Category 
3 (CAT 3) is used for 10BASE-T networks, and an even 
higher grade called Category 5 (CAT 5) is used for 
100BASE-T networks. See 10BASE-T, 100BASE-T, 
Ethernet. 
unnumbered interfaces 
 
An unnumbered interface is an IP interface that does not 
have a local subnet associated with it. Instead, it uses a 
Router-id that serves as the source and destination address 
of packets sent to and from the Router. Unlike the IP address 
of a normal interface, the Router-id of an unnumbered 
interface is allowed to be the same as the IP address of 
another interface. For example, the WAN unnumbered 
interface of your device uses the same IP address of the 
LAN interface (192.168.1.1). 
 
The unnumbered interface is temporary – PPP or DHCP will 
assign a ‘real’ IP address automatically. 
upstream 
The direction of data transmission from the user to the 
Internet. 
VC 
Virtual Circuit 
A connection from your DSL Router to your ISP. 
VCI 
Virtual Circuit Identifier 
Together with the Virtual Path Identifier (VPI), the VCI 
uniquely identifies a VC. Your ISP will tell you the VCI for 
each VC they provide. See VC. 
VPI 
Virtual Path Identifier 
Together with the Virtual Circuit Identifier (VCI), the VPI 
uniquely identifies a VC. Your ISP will tell you the VPI for 
each VC they provide. See VC. 
WAN 
Wide Area Network 
Any network spread over a large geographical area, such as 
a country or continent. With respect to the Wireless ADSL 
Router RTA01N, WAN refers to the Internet. 
Web browser 
A software program that uses Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol 
(HTTP) to download information from (and upload to) web 
sites, and displays the information, which may consist of text, 
graphic images, audio, or video, to the user. Web browsers 
use Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Popular web 
browsers include Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet 
Explorer. See HTTP, web site, WWW. 
Web page 
A web site file typically containing text, graphics and 
hyperlinks (cross-references) to the other pages on that web 
site, as well as to pages on other web sites. When a user 
accesses a web site, the first page that is displayed is called 
the home page. See hyperlink, web site. 
Web site
