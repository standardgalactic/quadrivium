Scaling Storage with StatefulSets

StatefulSet
Why use a StatefulSet to scale a database?  
How to define a StatefulSet (STS)?
What is a Headless Service?

How Does Statefulset Work?
Stable identifier
- Numbered, db-0, db-1 …
- Ordered (scaling, scheduling, 
rolling update ...)
Stable storage
- PVC Templates
- Same PVC  mounted across 
rescheduling

How to Define a StatefulSet?

StatefulSet
StatefulSet API Object
- Workload
- ServiceName
- Replicas
- Volume Claim Templates

Pod Identifiers 
Pod identifiers based on:
- StatefulSet name
- ordinal number 
(0 … replicas-1)  
- service name
- namespace
- cluster domain
Namespace 
Cluster domain

Pod Management Policies 
Pod management policy
OrderedReady
- Default
Parallel
- No wait for ready or 
terminated Pods
Do not force termination

Accessing StatefulSet with Headless Service

StatefulSet

Using Headless Services
Lookup DNS
Pods’ IP <-> Stable names   
Build connection string
Or use headless service name (if storage driver allows it) 

How to Define a Headless Service
Service API Object
- clusterIP: None

StatefulSet Is Not Magic!

StatefulSet Is Not Magic!
Managed:
- Pods replicas
- PVC
- PV (if StorageClass)
Not managed:
- Database cluster 
• (ie. MongoDB replicaset)
Addons
- Operator, Init Containers, 
Sidecar Pod, Custom 
images, …
- Helm

Limitations
PV have to be provisioned statically or dynamically 
PVC and PV are not deleted (if scale down of StatefulSet)
To delete Pods and StatefulSet: 
- kubectl scale sts guestbook-database  --replicas=0
- kubectl delete sts guestbook-database
Storage backend cluster has to be configured separately
