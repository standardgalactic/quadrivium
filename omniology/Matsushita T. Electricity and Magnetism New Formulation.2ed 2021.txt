Preface to the Second Edition
The E–B analogy is mainly adopted in the present treatment of electromagnetism.
The magnetic phenomena in superconductors in the perfect diamagnetic state were
compared with the electric phenomena in conductors in the zero electric ﬁeld state
to strengthen the analogy between the electric and magnetic phenomena in the ﬁrst
edition. The concept of the equivector potential surface, which corresponds to the
equipotential surface, was also introduced for the same purpose. The description
of the equivector potential surface was insufﬁcient, however, and a full comparison
with the equipotential surface was not included in the ﬁrst edition.
In the second edition, the direction of the vector potential itself and that of the
magnetic ﬂux density are discussed on the equivector potential surface, to compare
it with an electric ﬁeld that is perpendicular to an equipotential surface. The concept
of the equivector potential surface is widened for the purpose, and the equivector
potential surface is classiﬁed based on the condition of the magnetic ﬂux density on
the surface, which arises from the difference in the geometrical structure of the
equivector potential surface.
It is possible to analyze the magnetic phenomena by using the magnetic potential,
which is a scalar. Even so, the magnetic potential is not useful to describe the physical
situation, while the use of the vector potential is reasonable for the purpose. The two
potentials are compared in some examples and exercises. In addition, the number of
examples and exercises has been increased to assist the readers to understand the
content of the book through comparing similar electric and magnetic phenomena. The
theoretical proof of zero resistivity for a material that shows perfect diamagnetism,
i.e., the proof of superconductivity, is also added in the second edition.
The author expects that such revisions will assist the readers in gaining a deep
understanding of electricity and magnetism. He would like to acknowledge
Mr. Seiji Shinyama at Kyushu Institute of Technology for making new electronic
ﬁgures and Dr. Tania M. Silver at Wollongong University for correction of the
English in the book.

Preface to the First Edition
Electromagnetism is an important subject in today’s physics. The number of
textbooks on electromagnetism is much larger than those on other subjects. This is
because abstract concepts are frequently used and therefore it is not easy for stu-
dents to come to a complete understanding of electromagnetism, although various
phenomena are concisely described with mathematics. For this reason, many
textbooks have been published to assist students to understand electromagnetism
better. Why, then, is a new textbook on electromagnetism necessary now?
Electromagnetism is a classical subject that was almost completely formulated in
the nineteenth century. However, concerning its theoretical description, there is still
room for further progress. In addition, textbooks are required to describe their topics
adequately within a limited space. Therefore, there is also room for improvement in
textbooks from the technical point of view.
In principle, there is a beautiful formal analogy between static electric and
magnetic phenomena, as will be shown in this textbook. However, the analogy is
not necessarily perfect in existing textbooks because of the lack of an important
concept. Electric materials are classiﬁed into conductors and dielectric materials,
but only magnets are studied as magnetic materials. While it is known that electric
phenomena in dielectric materials and magnetic phenomena in magnets are anal-
ogous to each other, no one has discussed magnetic materials that correspond to
electric conductors. However, we have to note superconductors. In a supercon-
ductor, a current ﬂows on its surface to shield the inside against an external
magnetic ﬁeld, so that the magnetic ﬂux density B is zero in the superconductor.
This is analogous to the electric phenomenon of a conductor in an external electric
ﬁeld. That is, an electric charge appears on its surface to shield the inside against an
external electric ﬁeld, so that the electric ﬁeld E is zero in the conductor. This is one
of the remarkable analogies in the present E–B analogy.
Thus, the introduction of the superconductor into electromagnetism, which has
not yet been tried systematically, seems to be quite useful for understanding
electromagnetism. That is, the analogy between electricity and magnetism can be
completed by the introduction of the superconductor. There can be various ways of
vii

education without such a comprehensive analogy, and this is another reason why
many textbooks on electromagnetism have appeared.
From another point of view, superconductivity is a general phenomenon that
appears in many single elements and most metallic compounds, if the cases of
pressurization and thin ﬁlms are included. The intrinsic property of superconduc-
tivity, the breaking of Ohm’s law, may seem to be peculiar. However, supercon-
ductivity is a purely physical phenomenon that can be derived from minimizing free
energy. In contrast, the empirical Ohm’s law associated with energy dissipation
cannot be derived theoretically, and electromagnetic theory is incomplete for other
current-carrying materials in this sense.
Usually, students learn about static magnetic energy after they study electro-
magnetic induction. One of the appreciable advantages of using a superconductor is
the direct derivation of magnetic energy as mechanical work done by magnetic
force, similar to the electric energy resulting from the electric force. This is because
the magnetic ﬂux is conserved in a superconducting circuit disconnected from any
electric sources. As a result, the electromagnetic induction can be predicted for a
usual electric circuit using the relationship between the energy and magnetic force.
In electromagnetism, the magnetic moment of a magnet caused by spins and
orbital motions of electrons is described using a virtual magnetizing current.
However, the magnetic moment of a superconductor comes from a real current
ﬂowing in it. Hence, the introduction of the superconductor is also beneﬁcial with
regard to persuasion of the appropriateness of the virtual magnetizing current.
It should be noted that the deﬁnition of magnetization is different for magnets
and superconductors. That is, magnetization comes directly from the magnetization
M in magnets, while it comes from the magnetic ﬁeld H in superconductors. This
arises from the difference in the origin of the magnetic moments. According to the
deﬁnition used for magnets, superconductors are classiﬁed as non-magnetic mate-
rials. On the other hand, the analogous electric phenomena are electrostatic
shielding in conductors and electric polarization in dielectrics. These are similar
electric shielding mechanisms caused by electric charges and polarization charges,
but the above-mentioned different terms are used. Such comparison between
electricity and magnetism is also useful for education.
The ﬁnal merit of the introduction of superconductors is application of the
analysis method of electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors. The continuity
equation of magnetic ﬂux used for superconductors is useful for estimating the
velocity of magnetic ﬂux lines under a magnetic ﬁeld varying with time. This
enables us to unify the magnetic ﬂux law and the motional law for electromagnetic
induction, which usually have been treated separately.
The purpose of this textbook is to show the remarkable analogy between static
electric phenomena, described in Part I, and static magnetic phenomena, described
in Part II. Hence, a comparison between the corresponding chapters in each part,
such as Chap. 2 on conductors and Chap. 7 on superconductors, will assist in
understanding
electromagnetism.
Dynamic
electromagnetic
phenomena
are
described in Part III.

Explanation of the Figures
The upper ﬁgures show the structure of electric ﬂux lines when a uniform electric
ﬁeld is applied to a sphere of a conductor (left) and a dielectric (right), and the lower
ﬁgures show the structure of magnetic ﬂux lines when a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is
applied to a sphere of a superconductor (left) and a magnet (right). These will be
covered in Chaps. 2, 4, 7 and 9, respectively. The reason why the electric ﬂux lines
are used instead of the more important electric ﬁeld lines is to emphasize the
analogy between dielectrics and magnets by showing continuous lines at the
interfaces with vacuum. In the case of electric ﬁeld lines, the number of lines inside
the dielectric is smaller than that outside because of the shielding by polarization
charges (see Chap. 4). This situation is similar when we draw the magnetic ﬁeld
lines instead of the magnetic ﬂux lines for the lower right ﬁgure.
The manner of perfect shielding is different between the conductor and the
superconductor. This comes from the different nature of the corresponding ﬁelds.
Electric charges on the conductor surface absorb the lines directly, while currents
on the superconductor surface push the lines to outside.

Static Electric Phenomena

Chapter 1
Electrostatic Field
Abstract This chapter covers the electrostatic phenomena caused by electric
charges in a vacuum. First, we learn about the Coulomb force that works between
electric charges. This force on a given charge is caused by an electrical distortion in
space that is produced by other electric charges. This distortion is represented by the
electric ﬁeld. The local electric ﬁeld produced by electric charges is described by
Coulomb’s law. On the other hand, Gauss’ law describes the global relationship
between the electric charge and the electric ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld is expressed by
the gradient of the electric potential and has a nature of a ﬁeld with no rotation. The
equipotential surface is a virtual surface on which the electric potential is the same.
The electric ﬁeld is perpendicular to the equipotential surface. We also learn the
electrical properties of the electric dipole, i.e., a pair of positive and negative
electric charges of the same magnitude, which appears under various conditions in
electric phenomena.
1.1
Electric Charge in Vacuum
When we touch a metal doorknob after walking on a carpet on a dry day, we
sometimes feel a shock on the ﬁngertips as a small crackle. If it is dark, we can see a
spark when inserting a key into a keyhole. This is the same phenomenon as thunder.
This phenomenon is brought about by electric charge in substances. The usual
frictional electricity we experience also comes from electric charges.
Electric charge buildup in a substance causes various kinds of electric phe-
nomena, including the above examples. Matter is a substance that obeys universal
gravity laws, and its magnitude is quantitatively described in terms of mass. In the
case of electric phenomena, an amount of electric charge quantitatively describes
the phenomena, and the same term, “electric charge”, is also used to mean the
amount of electric charge.
Unlike mass, there are two kinds of electric charge, positive and negative. The
components of the electric charge are the proton with positive charge and electron

mentary electric charge is the minimum amount of electric charge, and any electric
charge is its integral multiple. Since e is sufﬁciently small, electric charge can be
regarded as a continuous quantity in many cases. This is similar to the fact that an
amount of water can be regarded as a continuous quantity in usual cases.
On an atomic scale, the nucleus of an atom is composed of protons and neutrons,
which are electrically neutral, and electrons stay in orbits around the nucleus. There
are innumerable positive and negative electric charges in substances. Since the size
of each atom is very small, electrons and protons can be regarded as being in the
center of each atom on a macroscopic scale. As a result, the positive and negative
charges cancel each other to yield an electrically neutral state. Ionic crystals
composed of equal amounts of positive and negative ions can also be regarded as
electrically neutral on the macroscopic scale, since the distance between these ions
is sufﬁciently small. Sometimes the electric charge is not balanced. In such a case,
the electric charge that remains after cancelation causes various electric phenomena.
There are two kinds of electric charge that cause electric phenomena: One is true
electric charge, which can be transferred outside a substance, and the other is
polarization charge, which is locally bound around a nucleus and cannot be
transferred outside. The former charge appears on the surface of a conductor and
will be covered in Chap. 2, and the latter appears on the surface of a dielectric and
will be covered in Chap. 4. These charges that contribute to electric phenomena are
called free electric charge.
Electric charge is generally distributed with some density in the interior or on the
surface of matter. Electric charge small enough to be regarded as a point is called
point charge. This is similar to a material particle in mechanics. Electric charge
distributed along a thin line with negligible cross-sectional area is line charge, and
electric charge distributed on a surface with negligible thickness is surface charge.
The principle of conservation of charge is a fundamental principle for electric
charge, which is similar to the law of conservation of mass in mechanics. It states
that the amount of electric charge is constant in a closed system. Even when
positive and negative electric charges cancel each other, resulting in an electrically
neutral state, the algebraic sum of electric charge is unchanged.

Coulomb’s Law
Electric force works between electric charges, and this force is called the Coulomb
force. This force is analogous to universal gravitation between two particles with
masses. The Coulomb force on two point charges in vacuum is expressed as
follows:
• The force between two electric charges of the same kind (i.e., both positive or
both negative) is repulsive, and the force between electric charges of different
kinds (i.e., one positive and one negative) is attractive.
• The magnitude of the force is proportional to the product of the two electric
charges.
• The magnitude of the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance
between the two electric charges.
• The direction of the force lies on the straight line connecting the two electric
charges.
The ﬁrst property is different from the property of universal gravitation whereby
the force between two masses is always attractive. The Coulomb force between two
point charges, q and q′, separated by distance d is mathematically expressed as
F ¼
qq0
4p0r2 ;
ð1:1Þ
where e0 is a constant called the permittivity of vacuum,
0 ¼ 107

0
¼ 8:854 2  1012 C2=Nm2
ð1:2Þ
with c0 ¼ 2:998  108 m/s denoting the speed of light in vacuum. The force in
Eq. (1.1) is repulsive when F>0 and attractive when F<0. This equation is called
Coulomb’s law.
Since force is a vector, the Coulomb force can be expressed as a vector. We
denote the direction vector of point charge q measured from the position of q′ as r,
as shown in Fig. 1.1. Then, its magnitude is r ¼ jrj, and the unit vector pointing
from q′ to q is ir ¼ r=r. Hence, the force that works on q is
F ¼ qq0ir

The force on q′ is given by F, and the law of action and reaction is satisﬁed.
When there are more than two material particles, the gravitational force on one
particle is the linear sum of the gravitational forces exerted on it by all other
particles, and the principle of superposition holds. The same principle holds also for
the Coulomb force. Assume that n point charges, q1; q2; . . .; qn, are distributed in
vacuum, as shown in Fig. 1.2. The total Coulomb force on another point charge, q,
is given by the sum of each individual Coulomb force exerted by each point charge.
If the direction vectors of point charges qi and q are denoted by ri (i ¼ 1; 2; . . .; n)
and r, respectively, the Coulomb force exerted by qi on q is

This expression for force holds for arbitrary q and for arbitrary position r. Hence,
the space can be regarded as exerting the following force on a point charge, q:

ð1:9Þ
We can consider the operation E to be caused by an electrical distortion of the
space due to the charge, Q. That is, the Coulomb force on q can be understood as a
force that this charge feels under the electrical distortion of the space. This oper-
ation on q, E, is called the electric ﬁeld, and its magnitude is called electric ﬁeld
strength. In the above case, where Q is at the origin, the electric ﬁeld strength is
E ¼

ð1:10Þ
The unit of electric ﬁeld strength is [N/C]. This is also expressed as [V/m] using
the unit [V] (volt) of electrostatic potential, which will be deﬁned later. The elec-
trostatic ﬁeld, which is the title of this chapter, is the electric ﬁeld that comes from
electric charges and does not include the electric ﬁeld caused by electromagnetic
induction (see Chap. 10).
The electric ﬁeld strength is the Coulomb force on a unit electric charge. Hence,
calculating the electric ﬁeld strength is equivalent to calculating the Coulomb force.

Here, we calculate the electric ﬁeld strength for electric charges distributed in

Equations (1.11) and (1.12) for the electric ﬁeld strength are also called

The electric ﬁeld is generally complicated depending on the distribution of
electric charges. However, we can visualize the ﬁeld using electric ﬁeld lines (lines
of electric force), which help us to understand the ﬁeld easily. When a point charge
is put in an electric ﬁeld of strength E, the charge experiences the Coulomb force
directed parallel to E. If this charge is sufﬁciently small, its movement driven by the
force will not appreciably change the electric ﬁeld. The direction of the electric ﬁeld
line is deﬁned as the direction of the force on a positive charge. Therefore, we can
refer to a line of electric force as an electric ﬁeld line and take the tangent to an
electric ﬁeld line at an arbitrary point as being parallel to the direction of the electric
ﬁeld at this point.
It can be shown that electric ﬁeld lines never cross each other. That is, if two
ﬁeld lines cross at a certain point, two forces must work on a point charge put on
this point. However, the electric ﬁeld at any point has a single strength.
Figure 1.5 shows examples of electric ﬁeld lines. A ﬁeld line always starts from
a positive charge and ends at a negative charge. One can see that a ﬁeld line never
begins or ends at a point with no charge. We will cover mathematical expressions of
these facts in Sect. 1.4.
In principle, we can draw an arbitrary number of ﬁeld lines. Hence, we deﬁne
E ¼ jEj as the number of ﬁeld lines through a unit area perpendicular to the electric
ﬁeld. Thus, the electric ﬁeld strength can be expressed through the density of ﬁeld
lines. For example, if the distance from the point charge is doubled in Fig. 1.5a, the
spacing between two ﬁeld lines is also doubled. This means that the ﬁeld strength
becomes one quarter as great, which is directly derived from Eq. (1.10).

Example 1.2. Electric charge is uniformly distributed with a linear density, k, on a
straight segment of length 2a parallel to the y-axis, as shown in Fig. 1.6. Determine
the electric ﬁeld strength at a point, A, at distance b from the center of the segment

reason why the full solid angle appears in Coulomb’s law, Eq. (1.1), is to make
Gauss’ law simple as in Eq. (1.15). Thus, the relationship

holds for S in Fig. 1.9. Thus, when q > 0 and N > 0, ﬁeld lines go outside S, and
when q < 0 and N < 0, ﬁeld lines go inside S.

Now, consider the case where the shape of sphere S is complicated in such a way
that points on S and points on S0 do not correspond one to one, as shown in
Fig. 1.10. Suppose a thin cone with a top on the point charge, q. We denote small
areas on S cut by the cone as dS1, dS2, and dS3. If the number of ﬁeld lines that go
out of S through the area, dS1, is dN, the number of ﬁeld lines that go out through
the areas dS2 and dS3 is -dN and dN, respectively. Hence, the number of ﬁeld lines
inside the cone is dN and is equal to the number of ﬁeld lines through the area of S0
cut by the cone. Thus, we can see that Eq. (1.16) holds when the point charge is
included in S, even if the shape of S is complicated.
Next, consider the case where a point charge, q, is placed outside a closed
surface, S, as shown in Fig. 1.11. From the above discussion, the number of ﬁeld
lines that enter S through dS1 is equal to the number of ﬁeld lines that go out of S
through dS2. Hence, we have

where V is the region surrounded by S. Equations (1.18) and (1.19) show that the

inside S divided by e0. These equations are called Gauss’ law. Gauss’ law describes
the global relationship between the distributed electric charge and the electric ﬁeld,
while Coulomb’s law describes the local electric ﬁeld caused by individual electric
charges. These laws are equivalent to each other.

The left side of Eq. (1.21) represents a source of electric ﬁeld lines. That is, ﬁeld
lines come out of positive electric charges and go into negative electric charges. An
electric ﬁeld line never starts or ends at a point where there is no electric charge
(q=0), since r  E ¼ 0.

inﬁnitely long cylinder of radius a. Determine the electric ﬁeld strength inside and

Solution 1.4. It is possible to calculate the electric ﬁeld strength using Coulomb’s
law, Eq. (1.12). However, the calculation is not easy even if we use the result in
Example 1.2. Gauss’ law can be used to calculate the electric ﬁeld strength when
the geometry is highly symmetric as in this problem.
We apply Gauss’ law, Eq. (1.19), to an imaginary inﬁnite cylindrical closed
surface, S, of radius R and length l with a common axis with the inﬁnite cylinder
(see Fig. 1.12). The electric ﬁeld, E, is directed radially from the central axis and
perpendicular to it. Hence, E is perpendicular to the elementary surface vector, dS,
on the top and bottom surfaces, and there is no contribution to the surface integral
of the electric ﬁeld strength from these surfaces. On the other hand, E is parallel to
dS on the side surface, and the strength, E, is constant and depends only on the
distance from the axis. Hence, the surface integral in Eq. (1.19) gives

The result for R>a is identical with the result of Example 1.2 for an inﬁnitely
long line charge with k ¼ pa2q, i.e., the case where all electric charge is concen-
trated on the central axis. When the length of the cylinder is ﬁnite, the electric ﬁeld
strength is not uniform along the length, and Gauss’ law cannot be used to calculate
the strength.
◊
Example 1.5. Electric charge is uniformly distributed with a density, r, on a wide ﬂat
plane. Determine the electric ﬁeld strength at a point, A, at distance h from the plane.
Solution 1.5. This problem can also be easily solved using Gauss’ law. From
symmetry, we can assume that the electric ﬁeld, E, is directed normally to the plane
with its strength dependent only on the distance from the plane. Assume a closed
cylindrical surface, S, of radius a and length 2 h, as shown in Fig. 1.13: Its side
surface is normal to and the top and bottom surfaces are parallel to the plane, and A
is on the top surface. We apply Gauss’ law to this cylindrical surface. The ﬁeld, E,
is parallel to the side surface, and there are no ﬁeld lines passing through this
surface. The numbers of ﬁeld lines that go out of the top and bottom surfaces are the
same from symmetry. Thus, we have

with S ¼ pa2 denoting the area of the top or bottom surface. Since the total electric
charge included inside S is r S, the electric ﬁeld strength is

This result shows that the electric ﬁeld strength does not change with the dis-
tance from the plane. This can be understood from the fact that the distance between
ﬁeld lines does not change with the distance from the plane, as shown in Fig. 1.14.

The Coulomb force works between any electric charges, and any electric ﬁeld
originates from electric charges. Hence, the general nature of the electric ﬁeld can
be deduced from one point charge. This nature can be extended to any case using
the principle of superposition. The electric ﬁeld strength caused by an isolated point
charge, Q, placed at the origin is given by Eq. (1.10). If we note the expression,

The unit of electric potential is [Nm/C] and is deﬁned as [V] (volt).
The electric potential produced by a positive electric charge is illustrated in
Fig. 1.15a. This shows the electric potential on a plane that contains the electric
charge. Figure 1.15b illustrates the electric potential given by a pair of positive and
negative electric charges of equal amounts on a plane that contains both charges.

When there are two or more electric charges, the principle of superposition holds
for the electric ﬁeld strength. A similar principle of superposition holds for the
electric potential. While the superposition is with vector quantities for the electric
ﬁeld, it is with scalar quantities for the electric potential. For discontinuously dis-

Next, assume two points, A and B, on a closed loop, C, as shown in Fig. 1.17,
and the positions of these points are denoted by rA and rB, respectively. We denote
the line from A to C on one side as C1 and that on the other side as C2. Thus,

Here, assume that an electric charge is forced to move in the electric ﬁeld. The
Coulomb force, QE, is exerted on a charge, Q, in the electric ﬁeld of strength E.
Hence, it is necessary to apply an opposite force, QE, to the electric charge to
prevent it from moving and then to add an inﬁnitesimal force to move it in a desired
direction. The work necessary to carry slowly the electric charge from point A to

electric charge from a reference point such as inﬁnity to position r is
W ¼ Q/ðrÞ:
ð1:34Þ
This work can be regarded as the potential energy of the electric charge, Q.
A virtual surface composed of points with the same electric potential is called an
equipotential surface. The work necessary to carry an electric charge, q, a small
distance, dr, on an equipotential surface is zero from Eq. (1.33). Since this work is
given by qE  r, we have E  r ¼ 0. That is, E vector is normal to the equipotential
surface. This can also be expressed by saying that the electric ﬁeld lines are normal

Human beings live in the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. The gravity we experience is
the universal gravitation between matter and the earth and is similar to the electric
force discussed here. Hence, we can deﬁne a surface on which gravitational
potential is constant, and this surface is spherical and concentric with the earth. The
direction of gravity, i.e., the direction of free motion of matter, is toward the center

Example 1.6. Electric charge is distributed uniformly with a density, q, inside a
sphere of radius a. Determine the electric potential inside and outside the sphere.
Solution 1.6. We apply Gauss’ law to a virtual sphere, S, of radius, r, concentric
with the charged sphere (see Fig. 1.19). The electric ﬁeld, E, is parallel to the
elementary surface vector, dS, with a constant strength, E, on the surface of S. Thus,
we have

The equipotential surface is a cylindrical surface inside and outside the cylinder.
The reason why the reference point is not inﬁnity is that the electric potential
diverges because of the inﬁnite total electric charge. In practice, we easily ﬁnd that
the electric potential directly estimated from Eq. (1.27) diverges. This divergence
comes from assuming an inﬁnitely long cylinder; the theory of electromagnetism
itself does not contain any defect.

with the total electric charge Q ¼ ð4p=3Þa3q. Both of them diverge in the limit of a
point charge, i.e., a!0, indicating an abnormal situation. However, this comes
from the problematic assumption that ﬁnite electric charge exists in an inﬁnitesimal
volume, and hence, it is not an essential problem in the theory itself. In practice, the
space in which electric charge exists is ﬁnite. The concept of “point charge” is an
approximation of the fact that the size of the electric charge is much smaller than the
treated system.

Electric Dipole
Most materials are electrically neutral with equal amounts of positive and negative
electric charges, as mentioned in the beginning of this chapter. When an electric
ﬁeld is applied to such materials, positive and negative charges are displaced in and
against the direction of the electric ﬁeld, respectively, resulting in local deviations
from neutrality. As a result, some electric phenomena are observed, as will be
discussed in Chaps. 2 and 4. The fundamental element for such electric phenomena

is a pair of positive and negative point charges that are separated by a small
distance. This is called an electric dipole.
Suppose that electric charges q and −q are displaced by d=2 in the positive and
negative directions from the origin along the z-axis, as shown in Fig. 1.21. We
determine the electric potential due to the pair of charges at a point, P, sufﬁciently
far from the origin. In polar coordinates, the distance of P from the origin is denoted
by r(d), and the angle of P from the z-axis is denoted by h. The distance from the
positive point charge to P is r0 ¼ ½r2 þ ðd=2Þ2  rd cos h1=2 ’ r  ðd=2Þ cos h; and
the electric potential at P due to this charge is

The electric potential is formally given by Eq. (1.27). We denote by h the angle

Column: Electric Charge Density in Electric Phenomena
Here, we estimate the amount of electric charges involved in a particular
electric phenomenon. Equation (1.22) gives the relationship between surface
electric charge and resultant electric ﬁeld strength in Example 1.5. For a
conductor surface, the electric ﬁeld strength is doubled, as Sect. 2.1 will
show.
Here, we examine the dielectric breakdown of air as an extreme case. The
dielectric breakdown of air occurs when the applied electric ﬁeld strength is
as high as 3106 V/m. Realizing such a ﬁeld strength requires a surface
charge density of r ¼ 0E ’ 2:7  105 C/m2. Since the electric charge of
one electron is 1. 610−19 C, we estimate the number density of electrons or
holes on the surface to be 1. 71014 m−2.
The surface number density of metal atoms such as copper is about
0. 61020 m−2. If one of every 3. 6105 atoms on the surface gets or loses
one electron, such a high electric ﬁeld is produced. The number density of
electric charge involved in usual electric phenomena is much lower.

Chapter 2
Conductors
Abstract This chapter covers electric phenomena inside and outside a conductor,
in which the electric ﬁeld is zero in the static condition. As a result, there is no
electric charge inside the conductor, and the conductor is equipotential. When an
electric charge is given to the conductor, it is distributed only on the conductor
surface, in such a way that zero electric ﬁeld strength is attained. The same thing
occurs when an external electric ﬁeld is applied to the conductor. This is the
electrostatic shielding. The electric ﬁeld on the outside is directed normal to the
surface of the conductor. A special method, i.e., the method of images, is introduced
to determine the electric ﬁeld outside the conductor and the distribution of electric
charges on the surface under such given conditions.
2.1
Electric Properties of Conductors
In terms of electric properties, materials are roughly classiﬁed into conductors,
which can easily transport electric current, and insulators, which can hardly do so.
The classiﬁcation is based on electric conductivity, as shown in Chap. 5. Metals are
conductors, and their electric property originates from free electrons that can move
freely in the material. On the other hand, electrons in insulators such as mica and
glass cannot move because of their bonding to atomic nuclei. Hence, the electric
behavior of conductors and insulators is very different. This chapter describes the
electric behavior of conductors. Chapter 4 describes that of insulators, which are
also called dielectrics or dielectric materials because of their other electric
properties.
The electric behavior of conductors is deﬁned as follows: the electric ﬁeld and
the electric charge density inside the conductor are zero in the static condition after
the conductor is put in an external electric ﬁeld. That is,
E ¼ 0

and
q ¼ 0:
ð2:2Þ
The properties given by the above two equations are not independent of each
other. Namely, Eq. (2.2) is derived from Eq. (2.1) with Eq. (1.21). From Eq. (2.1),
we have
/ ¼ const:
ð2:3Þ
Thus, we can also say that conductors are equipotential.
Here, we mention the relationship between electrical conductivity and the above
deﬁnition of a conductor. If some electric ﬁeld remains in the conductor, free
electrons in the material will be driven by this ﬁeld, which contradicts the
assumption of a static condition. Thus, there is no electric ﬁeld in a static conductor.
Suppose that an isolated conductor is placed in an electric ﬁeld. The ﬁeld forces
the free electrons in the conductor to move. These electrons cannot go outside the
conductor, and some of them accumulate on the surface of the conductor. The
electric ﬁeld produced by the electric charges on the surface exactly cancels the
external electric ﬁeld, resulting in a zero electric ﬁeld inside the conductor. This
realizes the situation assumed above for a conductor.
The appearance of electric charge on the surface of a conductor placed in an
electric ﬁeld is called electrostatic induction. The free electrons that appear on the
surface are true charges in electromagnetism. It is possible to make an electric ﬁeld
stay inside the conductor. In this case, electric charges move inside the conductor,
resulting in electric current, as will be described in Chap. 5. Hence, it is not a static
situation. It should be noted that, even if the electric current does not change with
time in a steady state, it is different from a static situation. This chapter describes
static electric phenomena without movement of electric charges.
Here, we investigate the electric ﬁeld in the vicinity of the conductor surface.
Suppose that a small closed pellet-shaped surface includes the interface between the
conductor and vacuum, as shown in Fig. 2.1a. We denote the height of the pellet
and the area of the conductor surface inside the pellet by Dh and DS, respectively.
Suppose that the density of electric charge on the surface of the conductor is r. We
apply Gauss’ law, Eq. (1.19), to the pellet. In this case, the electric ﬁeld vector, E, is
perpendicular to the surface of the conductor because of the orthogonality between
the electric ﬁeld and equipotential surface, since the surface of the conductor is
equipotential. Hence, the electric ﬁeld lines that go out of the side surface of the
pellet are negligible if Dh is sufﬁciently small. Thus, all the electric ﬁeld lines go
out from the outer surface (see Fig. 2.1b). Since E is perpendicular to this surface,
we have

The total electric charge inside the pellet is rDS, and the left side of Eq. (1.19) is
rDS=0. This gives
E ¼ r
0
:
ð2:5Þ
That is, the electric ﬁeld strength on the surface of the conductor is equal to the
surface electric charge density divided by e0.
Suppose we apply an electric charge, Q, to a spherical conductor of radius
a. This determines the electric ﬁeld and electric potential inside and outside the
conductor. Since the electric charge stays on the surface and charges repel each
other, the charge is uniformly distributed on the surface. Hence, the surface electric
charge density is r ¼ Q=ð4pa2Þ. We apply Gauss’ law to a supposed spherical
surface, S, of radius r with the same center as that of the conductor. Since the
electric charge distribution has spherical symmetry, we can also assume the electric
ﬁeld to have spherical symmetry. Hence, the electric ﬁeld is directed normally to S,
and its strength is uniform on S. If its strength is denoted by E, the surface integral
of the electric ﬁeld strength in Eq. (1.19) is 4pr2E. For r>a, as shown in Fig. 2.2a,
all the electric charge stays inside S, and the right side of Eq. (1.19) is Q=e0. Thus,

Solution 2.2. We can assume that Q is uniformly distributed on the surface

makes the electric ﬁeld zero inside the inner conductor (r<a). The electric charge

Here, we suppose that the outer conductor in Example 2.2 is grounded.
Grounding is a method to make the electric potential of a conductor zero by
connecting it to the ground. It sometimes accompanies transfer of electric charge. In
the above case, the electric charge on the outer surface (r=c) of the outer conductor
transfers to the ground through the grounding. This occurs because of the repulsive
Coulomb interaction between electric charges on the outer surface. This can also be
understood from the fact that the free electric charge transfers from the position of

higher electric potential, / ¼ Q=ð4p0cÞ; to the position of lower electric potential,
/=0. The electric charge on the inner surface (r=b) of the outer conductor does not
transfer to the ground. This is because it is attracted by the electric charge on the
surface (r=a) of the inner conductor (see Fig. 2.7). When some area is surrounded
by a grounded conductor, changes in the outside do not inﬂuence the electric ﬁeld
inside the grounded conductor. Such shielding from outside inﬂuence is called
electrostatic shielding.

The reason why inﬁnity is not deﬁned as the reference point of zero electric
potential is that the total electric charge is inﬁnite because of the inﬁnite length, as
mentioned in Example 1.8.

Example 2.4. Two wide slab conductors are parallel to each other, as shown in

respectively. The area of each surface is S. Determine the electric charge that
appears on each conductor surface, the electric ﬁeld strength, and the electric
potential inside and outside the conductors.
Solution 2.4. We denote the electric charge on the surface at x ¼ b by Qb. Then,
the electric charge on the surface at x ¼ a is Q  Qb. So that the electric ﬁeld does
not penetrate the right conductor, the electric charge at x ¼ b Qb
ð
Þ must be the same
as the electric charge in the region x  a, i.e., Q  Q  Qb ¼ Qb. Thus, we have
Qb ¼ 0, and the electric charge at x ¼ a is Q. The total electric charge in the
region of b\x\b must be zero from Eq. (1.19) so that the electric ﬁeld is zero in
the two conductors. Hence, the electric charge at x ¼ a is Q and that at x ¼ b is
zero. Thus, the electric ﬁeld strength along the x-axis is

Special Solution Method for Electrostatic Field
Suppose we need to determine the density of electric charge on the surface of a
conductor or the electric ﬁeld strength around the conductor when the conductor is
in an external electric ﬁeld. The electric potential in the conductor is constant in
space, as shown in Eq. (2.3). Outside the conductor, there is no electric charge and
the electric potential / satisﬁes Laplace’s Equation (1.38).
When we are given the boundary condition on the surface of a treated area, such
as the value of / above or a value of its derivative along the direction normal to the
surface, Laplace’s equation can be solved uniquely. Hence, there is only one
solution of / in the space outside the conductor, which becomes a constant value on
the surface of the conductor. This means that, if some function satisﬁes the
boundary condition, it is a solution, even though it may be obtained by intuition. In
the case of conductors, we know some methods to solve problems. These will be
introduced in this section. When we obtain a solution for /, we obtain the electric
ﬁeld, E, using Eq. (1.24) and determine the surface electric charge density from the
value of E with Eq. (2.5).
Here, suppose that an electric point charge, q, is put at a position at distance
a from a ﬂat inﬁnite conductor surface, as shown in Fig. 2.11a. Electric charge of
different signs appears on the conductor surface because of the electrostatic
induction and exerts an attractive force on q. The x–y plane is deﬁned on the
conductor surface with the origin, O, at the foot of a perpendicular line from the

charge, −q, put at the symmetric point of the given charge with respect to the conductor surface

electric charge. The electric potential is constant on the conductor surface (z=0), as
discussed in Sect. 2.1. Figure 1.18b shows that such an electric potential can be
realized in the following way: The conductor is virtually removed, and then an
electric charge, −q, is put at the point (0, 0, −a), the point symmetric to the location
of q with respect to the conductor surface, as shown in Fig. 2.11b. We now check
the validity of this speculation. The electric potential that the two electric charges
produce outside the conductor (z>0) is

It is easily found that this satisﬁes the condition, /=0, on the conductor surface
(z=0). Since this satisﬁes Laplace’s equation outside the conductor and the
boundary condition of Eq. (2.3) on the conductor surface, this is the solution. This
shows that the above intuitive method is useful. In the conductor (z<0), the electric
potential is not given by Eq. (2.10) but by /=0. This solution method is called the
method of images and the virtual electric charge is called an image charge.
From Eq. (2.10), we obtain the electric ﬁeld strength outside the conductor as

The electric ﬁeld strength inside the conductor (z<0) produced by the electric
charge on the conductor surface is equal to that produced by the electric
charge −q placed at the position of q, (0, 0, a). Since the latter electric ﬁeld
absolutely cancels out the electric ﬁeld produced by q, the electric ﬁeld in the
conductor can be shown to be zero.
Suppose that a point charge, q, is placed at point A at distance d from the center,
O, of a grounded spherical conductor of radius a (d>a), as illustrated in Fig. 2.13a.
Now we determine the electric potential outside the spherical conductor. Assume
that the conductor is removed and an image charge, Q, is placed at point B at
distance h from the center, as shown in Fig. 2.13b. The quantities Q and h are
unknown and need to be determined. Then, the electric potential on the conductor
surface is

ﬁnite. For an inﬁnitely long cylindrical conductor and line charge, the electric
charge induced in a conductor of unit length is equal to the density of the given line
charge (see Exercise 2.9).

Example 2.5. Suppose that the conductor is not grounded in the problem shown in
Fig. 2.13a. Determine the electric potential outside the conductor.
Solution 2.5. In this case, the total electric charge on the conductor surface is zero.
This problem is solved using the method of superposition. That is, this situation is
obtained by a superposition of the electric charge aq=d, which is distributed
according to Eq. (2.21), and the charge aq=d, which is uniformly distributed on the
surface. The distributed charge aq=d and point charge q give the zero electric
potential of the conductor, and the distributed charge aq=d makes the conductor
equipotential, q=(4pe0d). Hence, this situation satisﬁes the conductor condition. If
the electric potential given by Eq. (2.20) is denoted by /1(r, h), the electric

Electrostatic Induction
Suppose that a spherical conductor of radius a is put in a uniform electric ﬁeld of
strength E0 (see Fig. 2.17). An electric charge appears on the conductor surface and
cancels out the electric ﬁeld in the conductor. This phenomenon is the electrostatic
induction. Here we determine the surface electric charge density and the electric
ﬁeld around the conductor. We use cylindrical coordinates and deﬁne the z-axis as
the line through the center of the conductor along the direction of the applied
electric ﬁeld.
Before the electric ﬁeld is applied, positive and negative electric charges are
uniformly distributed inside the conductor, and the conductor is electrically neutral.
When the electric ﬁeld is applied, the positive and negative electric charges are
displaced in and against the direction of the electric ﬁeld, respectively, as illustrated
in Fig. 2.18a. This leads to a surface distribution of electric charge that keeps the
inside electrically neutral (see Fig. 2.18b). Hence, this seems to realize the proper
condition of a spherical conductor. We determine the displacement of the electric

charges. In this case, we ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld produced by the positive charge to be
the same as that produced when all the positive charge is concentrated at the center,
as predicted by Gauss’ law. The electric ﬁeld produced by the negative charge is
also the same as that produced by all the negative charge if concentrated at the
center. As a result an electric dipole appears at the center of the conductor (see
Fig. 2.18c). The electric dipole moment, p, that satisﬁes the electric potential is to
be determined.
The electric potential outside the conductor is composed of the electric potential,
/f, due to the applied electric ﬁeld, E0, and the electric potential, /d, due to the
electric dipole placed at the center after virtually removing the spherical conductor.
These are given by

Solution 2.7. We use cylindrical coordinates and deﬁne the z-axis as the central

applied electric ﬁeld. The electric potential outside the conductor can be determined
by putting the electric dipole line, as shown in Example 1.9, on the central axis after
removing the conductor similarly to what we did in the above analysis. We denote

Column: Applicability of Method of Images
The method of images is useful for solving problems when a conductor is put
in an electric ﬁeld, as shown in the Examples and Exercises. Now, suppose
that an electric charge is given on a spherical conductor placed at some
distance from a wide ﬂat conductor surface. Can we also use the method of
images in this case?
This problem can be compared with Exercise 2.10. Following the solution
for that exercise, we ﬁrst remove the spherical conductor and then place a
point charge equal to the given charge at a point at some distance from the
center. Next, we remove the wide ﬂat conductor and put the same electric
charge at the point symmetric to the location of the former charge with
respect to the ﬂat conductor surface. At ﬁrst, this may seem useful in
determining the electric potential outside the two conductors
However, the electric potential cannot be determined with this method.
How can we prove it? To satisfy the boundary condition on the inﬁnitely
wide conductor surface, all electric charges distributed on the surface must be
connected to the electric charges on the spherical conductor surface through
the electric ﬁeld lines. In fact, from a superposition of point electric charges,
we can show that the total amount of electric charge induced on the ﬂat
2.3
Electrostatic Induction
59

conductor surface is equal to the electric charge given to the spherical con-
ductor. However, to satisfy the boundary condition on the spherical conductor
surface after virtually concentrating all the electric charge at the image point,
the absolute value of the electric charge must be smaller than the point charge
assumed inside the inﬁnite ﬂat conductor [see Eq. (2.22)].
The method shown in Example 2.5 seems useful for making the spherical
conductor surface equipotential with the same electric charge. However, the
boundary condition on the inﬁnitely wide conductor surface is not satisﬁed
between one point charge and two separate point charges. For this reason, we
cannot obtain an analytic solution. To get a solution, it is necessary to dis-
tribute the image charge in such way that the boundary condition is satisﬁed
with the given electric charge
For an inﬁnitely long cylindrical conductor as in Exercise 2.10, even if the
electric charge is concentrated on an inﬁnitely thin line, the two conductors
have equal total amounts of electric charge. Hence, we can obtain an analytic
solution that simultaneously satisﬁes the two boundary conditions using the
method of images. The method of images is useful also for dielectric mate-
rials, and even for magnetic phenomena in superconductors and magnetic
materials. Consider the possibility of solving other problems using this
method.

Chapter 3
Conductor Systems in Vacuum
Abstract This chapter covers electric phenomenaṇin a conductor system com-
posed of more than one conductor. The relationship between the electric charge and
the electric potential is generally described using the coefﬁcients of electric
potential or the capacity coefﬁcients. The simplest conductor system is a capacitor
composed of two conductors. The characteristic of the capacitor is given by the
capacitance, i.e., the electric charge that can be stored by a unit electric potential
difference between the two conductors. The electrostatic energy of the conductor
system can be determined by the mechanical work needed to carry electric charges
from inﬁnity until the ﬁnal distribution of electric charge is attained and is described
using the electric potential and the coefﬁcients of electric potential.
3.1
Coefﬁcients in Conductor System
We learned that conductors are equipotential in the static condition in the last
chapter. We determined the electric potential and electric ﬁeld strength around a
conductor, and the distribution of electric charge was determined for simple cases.
Most cases involve more than one conductor rather than a single conductor. In this
chapter, we cover a conductor system, which consists of two or more conductors.
For a single conductor, as shown in Fig. 2.2, electric potential / is generally
proportional to electric charge Q according to
/ ¼ pcQ;
ð3:1Þ
where pc is a proportional constant called the coefﬁcient of electric potential and is
uniquely determined when the shape of the conductor is given. Its unit is V=C

focusing on the electric charge, C ¼ 1=pc is called capacity or capacitance, which
is equal to the electric charge stored by a unit electric potential, and its unit is [F]
(farad). For the spherical conductor of radius a in Fig. 2.2, we have C ¼ 4p e0a:
Suppose that there are two conductors and electric charges Q1 and Q2 are given
to conductors 1 and 2, respectively (see Fig. 3.1). When Q1 only is given to
conductor 1, the electric potential of conductor 1, /1, is given by
/1 ¼ p11Q1:
ð3:3Þ
The electric potential of conductor 2, /2, is similarly given by
/2 ¼ p21Q1:
ð3:4Þ
The constants p11 and p21 are also coefﬁcients of electric potential and now
elements of a matrix. While p11 is determined only by the shape of conductor 1, p21
depends both on the shape of conductor 2 and the relative position of the two
conductors. When conductor 1 is charged, an electric charge appears on the surface
of conductor 2 to shield its interior, resulting in an equipotential state under the
condition that total electric charge is zero. This will be easily understood from
Example 2.3. The distribution of electric charge on the surface of conductor 1 is
also inﬂuenced by the electric charge induced on conductor 2. Thus, it should be
noted that the electric charge is distributed in a way that makes the two conductors
equipotential.
When Q2 is given to conductor 2, the electric potentials in the two conductors
are
/1 ¼ p11Q1 þ p12Q2;
ð3:5aÞ
/2 ¼ p21Q1 þ p22Q2:

inequality pii  pij. In the assumed space, there is only positive unit electric charge,
and the electric potential at inﬁnity has the lowest value, 0. Thus, we can show the

Conductor Systems in Vacuum

The coefﬁcients of electric potential or the capacitance coefﬁcients are useful in
practical cases. For example, we apply the coefﬁcients of electric potential to the
example in Fig. 2.13 to determine the electric charge induced on the spherical
conductor by the point charge. The spherical conductor is named conductor 1, and a
very small imaginary conductor placed at the position of the point charge is called
conductor 2. Under the conditions Q1=1 and Q2=0, we have
/1 ¼ p11 ¼
1
4p0a ;
/2 ¼ p21 ¼
1
4p0d :
ð3:16Þ
Under the conditions Q1=Q and Q2=q, the electric potential of conductor 1 is
/1 ¼ p11Q þ p12q:
ð3:17Þ
Since conductor 1 is grounded, /1 ¼ 0. This and the reciprocity theorem
p12=p21 give
Q ¼  p21
p11
q ¼  a
d q;
ð3:18Þ
which agrees with Eq. (2.19). Thus, the coefﬁcients of electric potential can
sometimes be used to determine the induced electric charge more easily than with
the method discussed in Sect. 2.2.
Example 3.1. Prove the inequalities, Cii [ 0 and Cij  0 i 6¼ j



by grounding. In this case, the electric charge on
conductor i must be positive, and we can easily prove Qii ¼ Cii [ 0. Part of the
electric ﬁeld lines start from conductor i and go to inﬁnity, but the remaining lines
reach other conductors (see Fig. 3.3). Hence, the electric charges induced in these
conductors are negative or zero, which proves the inequality Qj ¼ Cji  0.

3.2
Capacitor
The component used to store electric charge is called a condenser or a capacitor.
Larger capacitance is usually desirable for this purpose. As shown in Sect. 3.1, the
capacitance of a spherical conductor of radius a is C ¼ 4p e0a. It amounts only to
5. 610−12 F even for a spherical conductor 10 cm in diameter. Hence, a different
shape is needed to obtain a larger capacitance.
Common capacitors consist of two parallel sheet conductors separated by a small
distance, as schematically shown in Fig. 3.5. Each sheet conductor is connected to
an outer circuit with a lead line for transporting electric charge. Such a capacitor is
called a parallel-plate capacitor. The sheet conductor that stores the electric
charge is called an electrode. Suppose that the surface area of each electrode is
S and the distance between the two electrodes is d, which is very small compared
with the electrode size: d 
ﬃﬃﬃ
S
p
. When an electric charge, Q, is given to one
electrode and −Q is given to the other, the electric charges are distributed uniformly
on the inner surfaces of the electrodes (facing each other) but do not appear on the
outer surfaces (see Exercise 2.4). Hence, the electric ﬁeld is almost concentrated in
the space between the electrodes and perpendicular to them except at the edges (see
Fig. 3.6).
The surface density of positive electric charge is

Thus, the electric ﬁeld strength is uniform in this space. The electric potential

This is the capacity or capacitance of the capacitor.
For a parallel-plate capacitor with square electrodes 10 cm in size and a distance
of 0.2 mm between the two electrodes, the capacitance is estimated to be
4. 410−10 F, which is about 80 times larger than that of the spherical conductor
10 cm in diameter mentioned above. This shows that the structure of the
parallel-plate capacitor is quite effective for storing electric charge. In practical
capacitors, a dielectric material is used in the space between the two electrodes to
enhance the capacitance further (see Chap. 4).
In the above example of a spherical conductor, we discussed the relationship
between the electric charge and electric potential difference between the conductor
and inﬁnity. The same result is obtained for the parallel-plate capacitor by giving an
electric charge to one electrode and by grounding the other electrode instead of
giving the opposite electric charge. The grounding process gives the same deﬁnition
for capacitance as for a spherical conductor. The reason for the small capacitance in
the spherical conductor is that a weak electric ﬁeld is spread over the whole space.
Example 3.3. Determine the capacitance of the concentric spherical capacitor in
Fig. 3.7.
Solution 3.3. An electric charge, Q, is given to the inner conductor and the outer
conductor is grounded. Then, an electric charge, −Q, appears on the inner surface
of the outer conductor. Applying Gauss’ law, we determine the electric ﬁeld
strength to be

We connect capacitors in series, apply an electric charge, Q, to the top capacitor,
and then ground the lowest capacitor, as shown in Fig. 3.8. An electric charge, −Q,
is induced on the inner surface of the lower electrode of the top capacitor to shield
the lower electrode from the electric ﬁeld produced by Q on the upper electrode.
From the principle of conservation of charge, an electric charge, Q, appears on the
upper electrode of the next capacitor. This is repeated, and ﬁnally electric
charges ±Q appear on both electrodes of each capacitor. When the capacitance of
each capacitor is Ci i ¼ 1; 2;    ; n

Electrostatic Energy
Suppose there is a conductor system with electric charges. The electric charges
produce an electric ﬁeld in the space outside the conductors. Hence, we can regard
the conductor system as having some kind of energy. This is called electrostatic
energy or electric energy. It is reasonable to assume that there is no electrostatic
energy in this system when there is no electric charge. Thus, the electrostatic energy
is equivalent to the mechanical work necessary to bring electric charges from
inﬁnity until we attain the desired distribution of electric charge.
Now, we determine the electrostatic energy for an isolated conductor of ca-
pacitance C and electric charge Q. Suppose that the conductor has an electric
charge, q, in an intermediate state while electric charge is being brought from
inﬁnity. The electric potential of the conductor is
/ðqÞ ¼ q
C :
A small amount of electric charge, dq, is additionally carried from inﬁnity to the
conductor. If this amount is sufﬁciently small, the transfer of this charge does not
change the electric potential /(q). Hence, the mechanical work needed for carrying
this charge is given by
dW ¼ /ðqÞdq ¼ q
C dq:
Thus, the total work needed to carry all electric charge, Q, is
W ¼
ZQ

This gives the electrostatic energy, Ue. In terms of the electric potential,

ð3:29Þ
Next, consider a system composed of two conductors. Suppose that conductor 1
has electric charge Q1 and electric potential /1, and conductor 2 has electric charge
Q2 and electric potential /2. Electric charge is brought from inﬁnity to conductor 1,
and then from inﬁnity to conductor 2. Now suppose an intermediate condition
where conductor 1 has electric charge q1 and conductor 2 has no electric charge, as
shown in Fig. 3.10a. Under this condition, the electric potential of conductor 1 is
p11q1 in terms of the coefﬁcient of electric potential. Hence, the work needed to
carry Q1 to conductor 1 is

When there is an electric ﬁeld in space, the space is distorted electrically as
mentioned in Sect. 1.3. Hence, the electrostatic energy is understood as the energy
associated with the electrical distortion in the space. Now, we discuss the elec-
trostatic energy for the parallel-plate capacitor in Sect. 3.2. The capacitance of this
capacitor with surface area S and distance d between the electrodes is given by
Eq. 3.22. From this and Eq. 3.38, we have

3.4
Electrostatic Force
The electrostatic force between charged conductors is the sum of the Coulomb force
on individual electric charges distributed on the conductor surface. We can also
determine this force using the principle of virtual displacement and the electrostatic
energy.
Suppose that part of an isolated conductor system is forced to move a small
distance Ds by an electrostatic force F. The work done by the system, F  Ds, is the
energy that the system loses. Hence, if we use DUe to denote the variation in elec-
trostatic energy caused by the movement, the work is equal to DUe. Thus, we have
F  Ds þ DUe ¼ 0:
ð3:44Þ
In the limit jDsj ¼ Ds ! 0 for displacement along the direction of the electro-
static force, this gives
F ¼  @Ue
@s :
ð3:45Þ
We calculate the force on the electrodes of the parallel-plate capacitor in Fig. 3.5
using this method, when electric charges ±Q are given. The surface area and the
distance between the electrodes are S and d, respectively. Assume that the distance
is changed to x. In this case, the electric charge Q and the electric ﬁeld strength
E ¼ Q=0S are unchanged, and it is reasonable to describe the electrostatic energy
of Eq. (3.39) as
Ue ¼ Q2x
20S
ð3:46Þ
in terms of Q. It should be noted that the voltage V changes with the distance, and it
is not suitable to describe Ue in terms of V. Hence, we determine the electrostatic
force on the electrode as

Since this force is negative for expansion (increasing x), it is attractive.
Example 3.8. Suppose that the electric potential difference V of the parallel-plate
capacitor is kept constant by connecting an electric power source, as shown in
Fig. 3.12. The surface area of the electrode is S, the distance between the electrodes
is d and the electric charges are ±Q. Determine the electrostatic force between the
electrodes.
Solution 3.8. It should be noted that the electric charge and the electric ﬁeld
strength change when the distance between the electrodes changes. That is, when
the distance between the electrodes changes from d to d þ Dx, the electric ﬁeld
strength and electric charge change to V=ðd þ DxÞ and 0SV=ðd þ DxÞ; respec-
tively. This is caused by a transfer of electric energy between the capacitor and the
power source. From Eq. (3.39), we obtain the variation in electrostatic energy as

Column: Case of Inﬁnite Amount of Electric Charge
The surface integral of Eq. (3.42) must be zero so that Eqs. 3.37 and (3.43)
coincide with each other. Is this condition also fulﬁlled when there is an
inﬁnite amount of electric charge in the whole space as discussed in Example
1.9? Here, we treat the case where an electric charge Q′ is given to a unit

which agrees with the above result. Thus, it is consistent with the assumption
that / is zero on the surface of R ¼ R0, resulting in a zero surface integral in
Eq. (3.42). This agreement holds even in the limit of R0 ! 1: This means
that there is no contradiction in the theoretical framework, although there is
the problem of divergence of electrostatic energy because of the inﬁnite
amount of electric charge.

Chapter 4
Dielectric Materials
Abstract This chapter covers electric phenomena in dielectric materials. When an
electric ﬁeld is applied to a dielectric material, the electrons are slightly displaced
along the direction opposite to the electric ﬁeld, even though they are bonded by
nuclei. This phenomenon is electric polarization. As a result, electric dipoles are
produced and polarization charge appears. Thus, the electric ﬁeld is produced by
true electric charges and also by polarization charges in dielectric materials. We
newly deﬁne the electric ﬂux density, which describes only the electric ﬁeld pro-
duced by the true electric charge. Electric phenomena are generally described in
terms of the electric ﬁeld and the electric ﬂux density. The refraction of the electric
ﬁeld at an interface between different dielectric materials is also treated.
4.1
Electric Polarization
When two electric charges are separated by a grounded metal sheet, there is no
force between the two electric charges. On the other hand, when the two electric
charges are separated by a paper or wood, although the force may be weakened
slightly, it does not reduce to zero. This shows that the effect of electric charge, i.e.,
the electric ﬁeld, penetrates the paper or wood. Such material is called a dielectric
material or insulator.
Here, we discuss the difference in electric behavior between conductors and
dielectric materials. When an electric ﬁeld is applied to a conductor, free electric
charges (free electrons) move to the surface of the conductor to shield the interior
from the external electric ﬁeld. When the conductor is grounded, the electric charge
on the surface opposite to the applied electric ﬁeld is zero, and no electric ﬁeld line
appears from this surface. Hence, electric ﬁeld lines from the electric charge, Q, do
not reach a point, A, at which the other charge stays, as shown in Fig. 4.1a. In a
dielectric material, electrons cannot freely move to shield because of their bonding
to nuclei, which allows the electric ﬁeld to penetrate, as shown in Fig. 4.1b. Hence,
even when an electric ﬁeld is applied to a dielectric material, no current can ﬂow
in it.

When no electric ﬁeld is applied to a dielectric material, positive and negative
electric charges are uniformly distributed on the macroscopic scale, resulting in an
electrically neutral state. When an electric ﬁeld is applied the dielectric material,
nuclei and electrons bonded by them are slightly displaced opposite to each other,
as shown in Fig. 4.2a, and innumerous electric dipoles appear inside the dielectric
material. As a result, the electrically neutral state is maintained inside but electric
charges appear on the surfaces (see Fig. 4.2b). This phenomenon is called electric
polarization or dielectric polarization, and the electric charge that appears on the
Fig. 4.1 Electric ﬁeld lines produced by electric charge, Q, for a grounded conductor and
b dielectric material

surface is called polarization charge. Although this phenomenon is similar to the
electrostatic induction in conductors learned in Sect. 2.3, the polarization charges
cannot be carried outside. This is a difference from true electric charges in con-
ductors. In some dielectric materials, the electric polarization exists even in the
absence of an external electric ﬁeld. Such a material is called a ferroelectric
material and its electric polarization is called spontaneous polarization.
There are also other kinds of electric polarization. The above example is caused
by relative displacements of electrons and nuclei under an applied electric ﬁeld and
is called electronic polarization. In ionic crystals composed of cations and anions,
the relative displacement of positive and negative ions in the electric ﬁeld brings
about the electric polarization called ionic polarization (see Fig. 4.3). In the case of
water or hydrogen chloride, the molecule itself has an electric dipole moment, as
shown in Fig. 4.4. In the usual state of gas or liquid in the absence of external
electric ﬁeld, each electric dipole moment of a polar molecule is directed randomly,
resulting in no electric polarization (see Fig. 4.5a). When an electric ﬁeld is applied,
each electric dipole moment tends to incline in the direction of the electric ﬁeld and
the electric polarization appears, as shown in Fig. 4.5b. This is called orientation
polarization. In many cases, the magnitude of electric polarization is proportional
to the electric ﬁeld strength.
Since electrons are able to respond quickly to a variation in the electric ﬁeld
because of their light mass, they can contribute to the electric polarization even for
an AC (alternating current) electric ﬁeld with very high frequency. On the other
hand, polar molecules cannot quickly rotate themselves to follow the variation in
the electric ﬁeld because of their heavy mass. Hence, those can contribute only to
the electric polarization at a fairly low frequency. The ionic polarization is inter-
mediate. Figure 4.6 shows a typical dependence of electric polarization on the
Fig. 4.3 Arrangement of ions in ionic crystal a before and b after application of electric ﬁeld

frequency of AC electric ﬁeld. Hence, each contribution can be discriminated by
measuring the frequency dependence of electric polarization.
We use P to represent the electric dipole moment appearing in a unit volume of
the dielectric material in an electric ﬁeld of strength E. This quantity is also called
electric polarization. Its unit is [C/m2]. Usually P is proportional to E:
P ¼ 0veE:
ð4:1Þ
In the above, ve is a dimensionless constant of proportionality called electric
susceptibility.

Dielectric Materials

Suppose a small rectangular parallelepiped with each surface perpendicular to a
coordinate axis, as shown in Fig. 4.7, in a dielectric material. The extension of this
region along each axis is denoted by Dx, Dy, and Dz. We assume that the electric
polarization, P, is directed along the z-axis. The magnitude of the electric dipole
moment in this region of volume DV ¼ DxDyDz is PDV. If the surface densities of
polarization charge that appears on the top and bottom surfaces of this region
are ±rp, polarization charges of rpDxDy appear on the top and bottom surfaces.
Hence, the electric dipole moment can also be given by rpDxDyDz ¼ rpDV. Thus,
we have
rp ¼ P:
ð4:2Þ
That is, the electric polarization is equal to the amount of positive polarization
charge that crosses the surface of a unit area perpendicular to the direction of
polarization.
Figure 4.8 shows the case where the electric polarization, P, is tilted by an angle
h from the unit surface vector, n. In this case, the surface density of positive
polarization charge that appears on the surface is
rp ¼ P cos h ¼ P  n:
ð4:3Þ
When the electric polarization is uniform in space, the polarization charge
appears only on the surface as shown above. However, when the electric polar-
ization is not uniform, the polarization charge also appears inside the dielectric
material. Suppose a closed surface, S, inside the dielectric material, as shown in
Fig. 4.9. The amount of electric charge that goes out of S through a small surface

In the above, we learned that electric polarization in dielectric materials and
electrostatic induction in conductors are similar to each other. However, there is an
essential difference between them. When a transverse electric ﬁeld is applied to a
long dielectric hollow cylinder, a similar discussion suggests a distributed polar-
ization charge on the inner surface, as shown in Fig. 4.10a. As a result, the electric

ﬁeld appears also in the interior space. In the case of a hollow cylinder made of a
conductor, electric charge does not appear on the inner surface in an external
transverse electric ﬁeld, since this electric charge produces an electric ﬁeld inside
the conductor (see Fig. 4.10b).
Example 4.1. A dielectric sphere of diameter a is placed in a uniform electric ﬁeld
of strength, E0, as shown in Fig. 4.11a. Determine the surface density of polar-
ization charge that appears on the surface of the dielectric sphere. The magnitude of
electric polarization, P, is P.

Solution 4.1. We deﬁne polar coordinates with the origin at the center of the
sphere and the axis along the direction of the applied electric ﬁeld. We denote by h
the zenithal angle measured from this axis, as shown in Fig. 4.11b. We also denote
the positive and negative electric charge densities and the relative displacement of
these charges by ±qp and d, respectively. Thus, the surface density of polarization
charge is given by rpðhÞ ¼ qpd cos h. Since the magnitude of electric polarization is
equal to the amount of positive polarization charge that crosses the surface of a unit
area, it is given by P = qpd. Thus, we have
rpðhÞ ¼ P cos h:

4.2
Electric Flux Density
We learned that there are two kinds of electric charge, i.e., true electric charge,
which can be transferred outside, and polarization charge, which appears on the
surface of dielectric materials but cannot be transferred outside. In addition, there
are two kinds of electric ﬁeld in dielectric materials, i.e., the electric ﬁeld applied
from outside and the one caused by electric polarization that occurs inside. Thus,
electric phenomena in dielectric materials are rather complicated. To distinguish
these contributions, it is convenient to introduce a new concept, electric ﬂux den-
sity, deﬁned below.
Suppose a closed surface, S, with inner region V. We denote the densities of true
electric charge and polarization charge in V by q and qp, respectively. Both of them
contribute to the electric ﬁeld and Gauss’ law is written as

Here, we deﬁne

and call this electric ﬂux density or electric displacement. Its unit is the same as
for P and is [C/m2]. In a relatively wide range of electric ﬁeld strength, P is
proportional to E, and D is also proportional to E. Thus, we can write D as
D ¼ 0ð1 þ veÞE ¼ E;
ð4:12Þ
where e is a constant inherent to each material and is called the dielectric constant.
Its unit is the same as for e0. If e is written as

er = 1 + ve is a dimensionless quantity and is called the relative dielectric

involved. Equation (1.19) describes only phenomena in vacuum or conductors and
is Gauss’ law in a narrow sense. The surface integral of electric ﬂux density on the

left side of Eq. (4.14) is called electric ﬂux. Hence, Eq. (4.14) states that the total
electric ﬂux going out of a closed surface is equal to the amount of true electric
charge in it. Using Gauss’ theorem on the left side of Eq. (4.14), it is rewritten as
Z

Since this relationship holds for arbitrary V, we have

ð4:16Þ
This is the general form of Gauss’ divergence law. It states that the divergence
of the electric ﬂux density is caused by true electric charge.
Substituting Eqs. (1.24) and (4.12) into Eq. (4.16) gives
D/ ¼  q
 :
ð4:17Þ
This equation is an extension of Eq. (1.37) to the case in which a dielectric
material is also contained and is the general form of Poisson’s equation. Its
solution is given by Eq. (1.27) by replacing e0 by e.
Similarly to the deﬁnition of an electric ﬁeld line for E, an electric ﬂux line can
be deﬁned for D. Namely, the direction of a tangential line at any point on the
electric ﬂux line is the same as the direction of D, and its line density is deﬁned to
be equal to the magnitude of D.
As shown by Eq. (4.16), the true electric charge density changes from the di-
vergence of 0E to that of D ¼ E. Hence, when the space between two electrodes
in a capacitor is occupied by a dielectric material with dielectric constant e, its new
capacitance is given by the former expression of capacitance by replacing e0 by e.
For example, the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor with a material of di-
electric constant e is given by
C ¼ S
d ¼ 0rS
d
ð4:18Þ
[see Eq. (3.22)]. The capacitance increases by factor er by ﬁlling the space between
the two electrodes with a dielectric material.
Example 4.2. Determine the capacitance of the parallel-plate capacitor in
Fig. 4.12. The surface area of the electrodes is S, their distance is d, and the
thicknesses of dielectric materials 1 and 2 with dielectric constants e1 and e2 are
t and d −t, respectively.
4.2
Electric Flux Density
99

Solution 4.2. When a voltage, V, is applied to this capacitor, we assume that
electric charges, ±Q, are induced uniformly on the two electrodes. Non-uniformity
at the edge can be disregarded if the electrodes are sufﬁciently wide. The electric
ﬁeld and electric ﬂux density are directed normally to the electrodes and the
interface between the two dielectric materials. Since there is no true electric charge
on the interface, the magnitude of the electric ﬂux density, D, is continuous there.
This value is equal to the surface density of electric charge on the electrode,
r ¼ Q=S, using Gauss’ law. Hence, the electric ﬁeld strengths in dielectric mate-
rials 1 and 2 are E1 ¼ D=1 and E2 ¼ D=2, respectively. The voltage between the

Solution 4.3. When a voltage, V, is applied to this capacitor, the electric ﬁeld
strength is E ¼ V=d in the space between the two electrodes. The electric ﬂux
densities in dielectric materials 1 and 2 are D1 ¼ 1V=d and D2 ¼ 2V=d,
respectively. Hence, the surface electric charge density on the electrode surface is
different between the regions faced to dielectric materials 1 and 2. That is, the
density is r1 ¼ 1V=d and r2 ¼ 2V=d in respective regions. The total electric

Boundary Conditions
In this section, we investigate the boundary conditions to be fulﬁlled for the electric
ﬁeld and electric ﬂux density at an interface between two different dielectric
materials with dielectric constants e1 and e2. Assume that a true electric charge of a
surface density, r, exists on the interface.
First, we discuss the boundary condition for the electric ﬂux density. Assume a
closed surface, DS, of a small pellet region at the interface with top and bottom

surfaces parallel to the interface, as shown in Fig. 4.14a. Assume that the height,
Dh, is sufﬁciently small. We apply Gauss’ law, Eq. (4.14), to this region. Since Dh
is sufﬁciently small, the surface integral of electric ﬂux on the side surface can be
neglected and only the contributions from the top and bottom surfaces remain. We
denote the electric ﬂux density in dielectric materials 1 and 2 near the boundary by
D1 and D2, respectively, and the normal unit vector on the boundary directed from
dielectric material 1 to 2 is denoted by n (see Fig. 4.14b). The electric ﬂux going
out from the top and bottom surfaces are D1  nDS and D2  nDS, respectively.
Here, DS is the area of the interface in the small region. Since the electric charge
inside this small region is rDS, Gauss’ law gives
n  ðD1  D2Þ ¼ r:
ð4:19Þ
This shows that the difference between the normal components of the electric
ﬂux density is equal to the surface electric charge density. Hence, if there is no true
electric charge on the interface, the normal component of electric ﬂux density is
continuous at the interface. If the electric potentials in dielectric materials 1 and 2 in
the vicinity of the interface are /1 and /2, Eq. (4.19) is written as
n  ð1 r/1  2 r/2Þ ¼ r:
ð4:20Þ
Secondly, we discuss the boundary condition for the electric ﬁeld. We denote the
electric ﬁeld in dielectric materials 1 and 2 near the boundary by E1 and E2,
respectively. One can show that a plane that contains the vectors E1 and E2 is
perpendicular to the interface, as illustrated in Fig. 4.15a (see Exercise 4.3).
Consider a small rectangle with two sides parallel to the interface on this plane, as
shown in Fig. 4.15b. The circular integral of the electric ﬁeld on the rectangle is
zero from Eq. (1.30). When the height, Dh, of the rectangle is sufﬁciently small,
there are only two contributions from the top and bottom sides to the circular
Fig. 4.14 a Small closed surface DS that contains a part of the interface between two dielectric
materials and b electric ﬂux density in each dielectric material at the interface

integral. We denote the unit vector on the top side along the direction of integral by
t. Then, the integrals on the top and bottom sides are respectively given by E1  tDs
and E2  tDs, where Ds is the length of these sides. Hence, we have
t  ðE1  E2Þ ¼ 0:
ð4:21Þ
That is, the component of the electric ﬁeld parallel to the interface is continuous.
However, since t is a unit vector directed along the electric ﬁeld projected upon the
interface, Eq. (4.22) is not a general description. Then, we deﬁne a unit vector, a,
normal to the plane, as shown in Fig. 4.15b. This vector satisﬁes the relationship
a  n ¼ t and is perpendicular to both the plane that includes the electric ﬁeld and
n. Thus, Eq. (4.21) is rewritten as ½n  ðE1  E2Þ  a ¼ 0; and we obtain
n  ðE1  E2Þ ¼ 0:
ð4:22Þ
This condition can also be described in terms of the electric potential. If the
derivative along the direction of t is ∂=∂t, Eq. (4.21) is written as
@/1
@t ¼ @/2
@t :
ð4:23Þ
Hence, when integrating along the direction of t, we have /1  /2 ¼ c with
c denoting a constant. If there is a ﬁnite difference in the electric potential in a very
narrow region, it results in an extremely strong electric ﬁeld in the normal direction
at the interface. This is not practical and results in c = 0. That is,

ð4:24Þ
The electric potential is continuous at the interface.
Conﬁrm that the above boundary conditions are satisﬁed on the interfaces of two
dielectric materials in Examples 4.2 and 4.3.
Here, we discuss the boundary conditions of the electric ﬁeld at the conductor
surface using the above conditions. Suppose that the vacuum and the conductor are
regions 1 and 2, respectively, and e0 is used for the dielectric constant of the
conductor. Since E2 = 0, Eq. (4.22) shows that the electric ﬁeld in the vacuum has
only a normal component. Equation (4.19) leads to D1 = r, i.e.,
0E1 ¼ r:
ð4:25Þ
This agrees with Eq. (2.5). Thus, the boundary conditions for a conductor can
also be included in the above general boundary conditions.
Now, we discuss refraction of electric ﬁeld lines at a boundary using the
boundary conditions. Suppose an interface between two dielectric materials with
dielectric constants e1 and e2. Assume that an electric ﬁeld of strength E1 is applied
to dielectric material 1 in the direction of angle h1 measured from the normal
direction to the interface, as shown in Fig. 4.16. The strength and angle of the
electric ﬁeld in dielectric material 2 are denoted by E2 and h2. Since true electric
charge does not usually exist on the interface, the normal component of the electric
ﬂux density is continuous on it:

Solution 4.4. From the continuity of the normal component of the electric ﬂux
density on the surface given by Eq. (4.19), the electric ﬂux density inside the

Example 4.5. A dielectric sphere of radius a is placed in a uniform electric ﬁeld of
strength E0, as shown in Fig. 4.11a. Determine the electric ﬁeld strength, electric

the polarization charge density on the surface.
Solution 4.5. Polar coordinates are deﬁned as in Example 4.1. We can assume that
a uniform electric polarization occurs in the dielectric material as in this example.
The electric ﬁeld outside the sphere is given by the sum of the applied electric ﬁeld
and the contribution of the electric dipole placed at the origin after virtual removal
of the sphere. The electric ﬁeld strength inside the sphere is expected to be uniform
because of the uniform electric polarization. Let p denote the electric dipole
moment directed along the applied electric ﬁeld. From Eqs. (1.48a) and (1.48b), the
radial and zenithal components of the electric ﬁeld outside the sphere produced by
the electric dipole are

Here, we suppose a small shell that contains a part of the surface (see Fig. 4.18).
We apply Eq. (4.9) to this region. Since there is no true electric charge, the dif-

Example 4.6. A point charge, q, is placed at a position of distance a from a wide
ﬂat surface of a dielectric material of dielectric constant e, as shown in Fig. 4.20.
Determine the electric potential in the vacuum and in the dielectric material.
Solution 4.6. We draw the z-axis from the point charge in the direction normal to
the dielectric material’s surface, which is deﬁned to be z = 0. We deﬁne the x–
y plane on the surface with the origin at the foot of a perpendicular line from the
point charge. This problem can also be solved using the method of images shown in
Sect. 2.2.
We assume that the electric potential in the vacuum region (z > 0) is given by
the sum of a contribution from q and that from a virtual point charge, q′, placed at
the symmetric position with respect to the surface with virtual removal of dielectric
material, as shown in Fig. 4.21a. Thus, the electric potential at point (x, y, z) is

This does not essentially change even when there are dielectric materials in the
system. Formally, only the change from e0 to e occurs in the region of dielectric

Column: Electric Induction in a Conductor and Electric Polarization in a
Dielectric Material
From electric ﬁeld lines inside and outside the dielectric sphere placed in a
uniform electric ﬁeld shown in Fig. 4.18, one can see that the interior is
imperfectly shielded by polarization charge. On the other hand, the electric
ﬂux density inside the sphere is higher than the external value because of e
larger than e0, similarly to the magnetic ﬂux lines in Fig. 9.17. The solution
for the electric ﬂux density, D, has the same form as that for the magnetic ﬂux
density, B, for a magnetic sphere placed in the uniform magnetic ﬂux density
treated in Example 9.5 in Chap. 9. This similarity comes from the fact that,
when there is no electric charge (q = 0), D obeys the same equation as B
(r  D ¼ r  B ¼ 0).
If the dielectric constant e is inﬁnitely large in Example 4.4, the solution
for the electric ﬁeld strength coincides with that in the spherical conductor in
Sect. 2.3. That is, E = 0 inside and Eq. (2.28) holds outside the sphere. In this
case, the electric ﬂux density has a ﬁnite value. However, its value is
meaningless, and we can disregard it. There is also the relationship
rp  r
between the polarization charge density r p on the dielectric sphere surface in
Example 4.4 and the true electric charge density r on the spherical conductor
surface in Sect. 2.3. The equality holds in the limit e ! ∞. Hence, there is
no large difference between the true electric charge in the conductor and the
polarization charge in the dielectric material that are displaced in the electric
ﬁeld (rp ¼ ð4=7Þr for e = 5e0). Hence, it is reasonable to assume similar
models for the two cases. This shows that the electric shielding in conductors
and electric polarization in dielectric materials are essentially the same
mechanism.

Chapter 5
Steady Current
Abstract This chapter covers electric phenomena when there is steady current
ﬂow. Current comes from a movement of electric charge, and the continuity
equation of current holds generally based on the principle of conservation of
charge. We need to apply an electric potential difference, i.e., a voltage, to a
material to transport a current through it. It is well known that Ohm’s law holds
empirically, which assumes a proportional relationship between the voltage and the
current. Its proportional constant, the electric resistance, is proportional to the re-
sistivity, which is a parameter inherent to the material. When there is steady current
ﬂow, the energy, which is continuously supplied by an electric power source, is
dissipated. Kirchhoff’s law, used in direct current electric circuits, is derived.
5.1
Current
A conductor contains freely moving electric charge, and the Coulomb force can
move the electric charge when an electric ﬁeld is directly applied to the conductor.
This movement of electric charge is current. In this chapter, we discuss electric
phenomena when a steady current that does not change with time ﬂows. As
distinct from magnetization current and displacement current discussed in Chaps. 9
and 11, the current of true electric charge is sometimes called true current.
The current is a vector with a magnitude and direction. When electric charge
dQ passes through a cross section within time dt, the current is given by
I ¼ dQ
dt :
ð5:1Þ
Its unit is [C/s] and is denoted [A] (ampere).
Although the current is an amount of electric charge that passes through a certain
cross section in unit time, it is not a quantity representing strength. We deﬁne
current density as a quantity representing the strength of current. The current
density i is also a vector. Its direction is the same as that of the current, and its
magnitude is given by

when current dI ﬂows through a small normal cross section of area dS. Its unit is [A/
m2]. When the direction of current is tilted from elementary surface vector dS, the
current that ﬂows through the elementary surface is
dI ¼ idS cos h ¼ i  dS:
ð5:3Þ
Since the current is a ﬂow of electric charge, we can describe it using the density
and velocity of electric charge. Suppose that particles of electric charge q and
density n move with velocity v. The current density is then given by
i ¼ qnv:
ð5:4Þ
Since the electric charge density is given by q = qn, the current density is
expressed as
i ¼ qv:
ð5:5Þ
The amount of electric charge is conserved similarly to the mass of materials.
That is, the algebraic sum of positive and negative charges is conserved. We
suppose a region V surrounded by a closed surface S (see Fig. 5.1) and denote the
electric charge density inside it by q. The total electric charge in V is
Q ¼
Z

ð5:6Þ
When current of density i ﬂows across the surface, the electric charge that passes
out of V through a small area dS in unit time is i  dS. Hence, the electric charge that
goes out of S in unit time is given by

Since this relationship holds for arbitrary V, we have

This is called the continuity equation of current.
For a steady current that does not change with time Eq. (5.10) reduces to
r  i ¼ 0:
ð5:11Þ
That is, the current density does not diverge and follows the same continuity
equation as an incompressible ﬂuid.
5.2
Ohm’s Law
It is necessary to apply an electric potential difference to a material such as a metal
to get a current. In many cases, it is empirically known that there is a proportional
relationship between the electric potential difference V and the current I:
V ¼ RrI:
ð5:12Þ
The proportional constant Rr is called electric resistance or simply resistance.
This constant is determined by the shape and property of the material that carries
current. The unit of electric resistance is [V/A] and is denoted [X] (ohm).
Equation (5.12) is called Ohm’s law. For a material of length l and uniform
cross-sectional area S, the electric resistance is given by

Rr ¼ qr

ð5:13Þ
where qr is a constant inherent to material and is called resistivity or speciﬁc
resistance. Its unit is [X m]. Table 5.1 lists values of the resistivity for various
materials. The electric property of a material differs dramatically depending on the
resistivity: Materials with resistivity less than 10−6 X m that can easily transport a
current are called conductors, and materials with resistivity above 108 X m that can
hardly transport a current are classiﬁed as insulators. Materials with intermediate
resistivity are called semiconductors.
The relationship between the current and electric potential difference is also
written as
I ¼ GV:
ð5:14Þ
In the above, the proportional constant G=1=Rr is called conductance. Its unit is
[S] (siemens). Using Eq. (5.13), the conductance is written as
G ¼ rc

ð5:15Þ
The constant rc=1=qr is called electric conductivity. Its unit is [S/m].
Suppose a small region in which the current ﬂows under electric potential dif-
ference (see Fig. 5.2). The length of this region along the current is Dl, and the
cross-sectional area normal to the current is DS. When the electric ﬁeld strength is
E and the current density is i, the potential difference and the current in this small
region are DV ¼ EDl and DI ¼ iDS, respectively. Hence, the electric resistance is
written as

These are Ohm’s law for electromagnetism.
The current is realized by a movement of electric charge, most of which is
electrons. Therefore, current is a dynamic phenomenon and is not a static phe-
nomenon, even if it is in a steady state. The reason why some electric ﬁeld can
remain in a conductor is that the phenomenon is in a dynamic state. Even in this
case, we can express the electric ﬁeld using the electric potential as in Eq. (1.24).

Microscopic Investigation of Electric Resistance
As mentioned in Sect. 5.2, Ohm’s law is an empirical law for various kinds of
materials, and it should be noted that this law cannot be explained by any physical
principle. This is because the resistance is associated with energy dissipation, which
cannot be derived theoretically. Hence, Ohm’s law is a kind of phenomenological
model. On the other hand, in a superconductor, which is introduced as one kind of
magnetic material in Chap. 7, Ohm’s law does not hold and the current obeys a
physical principle. Hence, we can say that a superconductor is a pure material from
the viewpoint of physics.
Here we investigate microscopically the occurrence of electric resistance,
although it is not rigorously based on a physical principle. When a current ﬂows
steadily inside a metal, electrons that compose the current are driven by the electric
ﬁeld. If the mass of an electron is m, the equation of motion of the electron in
electric ﬁeld E is expected to be
m dv
dt ¼ eE;
ð5:20Þ
where v is the velocity of the electron. However, this equation requires the electron
to be accelerated by the electric ﬁeld, which would bring about increasing current
with time, resulting in a contradiction with the assumption of a steady state.
In a practical condition, every time an electron is accelerated by the electric ﬁeld,
it will collide with atoms in the metal and lose the energy given by the electric ﬁeld,
as illustrated in Fig. 5.3a. Thus, the velocity of the electron will have some mean
value without increasing appreciably (see Fig. 5.3b). The effect of collision can be
introduced by assuming a viscous force acting on electrons. Although this force
cannot be derived from any physical principle, this phenomenological assumption
is known to be useful in many examples.

Steady Current

Here we average the motion of an electron within a suitable time scale as in
Fig. 5.3b in such a way that we can describe a gradual variation in the average
velocity v on a much longer time scale. Then, the viscous force is deﬁned. This
force is directed opposite to the motion of the electron, and its magnitude is pro-
portional to the velocity. Hence, when the electron moves with a higher velocity, it
is subjected to a stronger force that reduces the velocity. This force is expressed as
gv, and constant η is called the coefﬁcient of viscosity. Hence, the equation of
motion of the electron is now given by
m dv

Figure 5.4 shows the variation in the velocity with time. After a sufﬁciently long

Hence, using Eq. (5.4), the current density in the steady state is given by

ð5:24Þ
where ne is the density of electrons. Thus, we obtain Ohm’s law. In the above

From Eq. (5.22), the time needed for the current to reach the steady-state value is

Substituting m’0. 910−30 kg, e’1. 610−19 C, ne’11029 m−3 for usual
metals and rc’0. 6108S/m for copper, we have t0’210−14 s. Since the time
required for observation using measurement instruments is of the order of 10−10 s,
the above variation in current cannot be observed. This means that Ohm’s law is
always observed.
When we apply a current to a material with electric resistance, energy dissipation
takes place. Suppose that a current I ﬂows in a material under an electric potential
difference V given by a power source. Here we estimate the work done by the power
source during a period Dt. The amount of electric charge that is transferred during
this period is DQ ¼ IDt. The work done on this electric charge is
DW ¼ VDQ ¼ VIDt:
ð5:27Þ
Hence, the work done in unit time is
P ¼ DW
Dt ¼ VI:
ð5:28Þ
This is called electric power. Its unit is [VA] and is denoted [W] (watt). Using
Ohm’s law, this is rewritten as
P ¼ RrI2 ¼ V2
Rr
:
ð5:29Þ
In this case, the steady state of the current is maintained and the stored electric
energy does not change. Hence, the work done by the power source is dissipated to
heat.
Suppose a small region of length Dl and cross-sectional area DS. We assume that
a current, DI ¼ iDS, ﬂows through the cross section under an electric potential
difference, DV ¼ EDl, along the length. The electric power dissipated in this region
is
DP ¼ DVDI ¼ EiDlDS:
ð5:30Þ
Hence, the dissipated electric power in a unit volume (i.e., the electric power
density) is

Fundamental Equations for Steady Electric Current
We have discussed the equation describing the phenomena associated with a steady
current. The fundamental physical quantity for the steady current is the current
density i. The quantity that causes it is the electric ﬁeld, E. Here we summarize the
fundamental equations for these quantities.
The continuity equation for a steady current is given by Eq. (5.11). The electric
ﬁeld is derived from the electric potential, and hence, Eq. (1.28) holds. Ohm’s law
that connects these quantities is Eq. (5.18).
These equations have the same forms as fundamental equations describing the
electrostatic ﬁeld in a space in which there is no electric charge, as compared in
Table 5.2. That is, the electric ﬁeld E is common to the two cases, and the current
density i corresponds to the electric ﬂux density D, and the electric conductivity rc
corresponds to the dielectric constant e. However, it should be noted that this
correspondence is mathematical, and similarity is sometimes broken in real cases as
will be shown later.
Here we suppose that electric charges ±Q are given to the outer and inner
electrodes of a concentric spherical capacitor with a dielectric material of dielectric
constant e in Fig. 5.5. We have learned the method with which to determine the
electric potential difference between the electrodes. The electric ﬂux density is
directed outward from the inner electrode, and using Gauss’ law, we can determine
its magnitude as
D ¼

potential difference is given by

The dielectric material in the concentric spherical capacitor is replaced by a
substance with electric conductivity rc. Now we determine the electric resistance

Thus, the above two problems are formally identical. Eliminating V common to
each example from Eqs. (5.34) and (5.37), we have
CRr ¼ 

ð5:38Þ
This quantity—the product of capacitance and electric resistance—does not
depend on the shape of capacitor or resistor and is given only by the dielectric
constant and electric conductivity. This relationship of Eq. (5.38) generally holds
for a capacitor and resistor having electrodes of the same shape. However, this is
limited to the case in which we can obtain a rigorous solution for the ﬁeld.
Similarity is rarely found between phenomena of steady current and an elec-
trostatic ﬁeld. This is explained by a quite large difference in the electric conduc-
tivity between a conductor and vacuum, while the difference in the dielectric
constant between a dielectric material and vacuum is a factor of several tens at
most.
For example, Fig. 5.6a shows the current when an electric potential difference is
applied to the two edges of a long thin resistor. In this case, the current ﬂows
uniformly. On the other hand, Fig. 5.6b shows the electric ﬂux when an electric
potential difference is applied to the two electrodes of a capacitor composed of a
long thin dielectric material. The electric ﬂux lines spread out of the dielectric
material, although they pass more easily through the dielectric material than
through the vacuum. This difference arises from the large difference in material
constants mentioned above. The reason why Eq. (5.38) holds in the case of Fig. 5.5
is that the electric ﬁeld has completely the same form under the rigorous symmetry
in both cases.

Fundamental Equations for Steady Electric Current

Here we discuss the boundary condition to be satisﬁed for the steady current at
an interface between substances with different electric resistivities. Since the
equation for the current density i is formally the same as that for the electric ﬂux
density D in the absence of electric charge, the boundary condition is also the same.
That is, from Eq. (4.19), we have
n  ði1  i2Þ ¼ 0;
ð5:39Þ
where n is a unit vector normal to the interface. This shows that the normal
component of the current density is continuous at the interface.
Example 5.1. Determine the electric resistance when current ﬂows along a quarter
of a circle of radius R0 with a rectangular cross-section, as shown in Fig. 5.7a. The
electric resistivity is qr.

The average of a product of two quantities is not generally equal to the product

difference is given by V=<E>L and the current is given by I=<i>S, where < > means
the average, and L and S are the length and the cross-sectional area, respectively, of
the sample. Since the loss power density is given by Ei, the total loss power is

Example 5.5. Current of density i0 ﬂows uniformly in a substance of electric
conductivity rc0. When a spherical region of radius a in this substance is replaced
by a different substance of electric conductivity rc, as shown in Fig. 5.10, deter-
mine the current density inside and outside the sphere.
Solution 5.5. The equations describing the phenomena have the same form as
those describing the electric ﬂux density in the absence of an electric charge. Hence,
the solution for the current density and that for the electric ﬂux density are formally
the same. That is, we can use the solution for D in Example 4.5 by replacing e0 and
e with rc0 and rc. In this case, the uniform electric ﬁeld E0 corresponds to i0=rc0.
We deﬁne polar coordinates with the origin at the center of the sphere. We denote

This also shows that I reduces to zero after a very short period. A steady current
can continue to ﬂow only in superconductors with qr=0.
Hence, to get a steady current in the general case, it is necessary to have an
electric power source that applies an electric potential difference to force the
current to ﬂow in a circuit. The electric potential difference that the electric power
source generates is called electromotive force. Table 5.3 lists practical electric
power sources and the kinds of electromotive force. The unit of the electromotive
force is [V]. Except in the case of generator, the electric energy of the electromotive
force provided by the sources is transformed from chemical, mechanical, thermal,
or optical energy.
Suppose a closed circuit with an electric power source of electromotive force
V. We denote the part of electric power source and the remaining part of the electric
circuit as DC and C′ (=C DC), respectively, as shown in Fig. 5.12. The electric

Thus, the steady current is realized by the electric power source. The electric

resistor and is called a voltage drop. The direction of the electric ﬁeld is the same
as that of the current but is opposite that of the electric ﬁeld due to the electromotive
force.

Kirchhoff’s Law
In an electrical network composed only of resistors and direct current (DC) electric
power sources, the current ﬂows in a steady state. An important law that describes
the steady current is Kirchhoff’s law. We derive this law from the principles of
electromagnetism.
Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law states that the algebraic sum of currents passing out of an
arbitrary node is zero. Here the currents that pass out and in are considered to be
positive and negative, respectively. Applying this law to a node in Fig. 5.13a, we
have

where V is the interior of S. Thus, we obtain Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law, Eq. (5.48).

Column: Difference in Electric Resistivity
There are no material constants that differ so much depending on material as
electric resistivity. Electric resistivity differs by a factor of 1023 between silver
and quartz glass. In superconducting materials covered in Chap. 7, the electric
resistivity is theoretically predicted to be zero. However, it is impossible to
experimentally prove that the resistivity is absolutely zero.
For example, if the electric potential difference is measured to be less than
the noise level of 10 nV when current of 1 A is applied to a superconducting
wire of cross-sectional area 1 mm2 and length 1 m, we can prove that the
electric resistivity is less than 1014 X m. This is close to the limit of sen-
sitivity of measurement instruments. It should be noted that the electric re-
sistivity is of the order of 10−11 X m even for high-purity copper at extremely
low temperatures such as 4.2 K. Observation of the decay of current due to
electric resistivity is much more sensitive. If the inductance and electric
resistance of a closed circuit are L and Rr, the current decays as

by d=10 mm are connected at both edges with zero resistance, we calculate
the inductance as
L ﬃl0l
p log d
a ﬃ6:0  107H
(see Example 8.1). In the above, l0 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum.
If no decay is observed with measurement uncertainty less than 0.1% over
3 years (approximately 0. 95108 s), s is larger than 0. 951011 s. Thus, Rr
is less than 610−18 X and we can say that the electric resistivity is less than
610−24 X m.
Hence, the practical difference in electric resistivity reaches the level of
1038. The difference in size between a hydrogen atom and the universe (about
15 billion light years) is of the order of 1036, which gives an idea of the huge
range of electric resistivity. Completely different electric properties of dif-
ferent materials are due to such a dramatic difference in the electric resistivity.

Current and Magnetic Flux Density
Abstract This chapter covers magnetic phenomena caused by currents. The
Lorentz force, which works between currents, is caused by a magnetic distortion in
space that is produced by the currents. This distortion is the magnetic ﬁeld and is
represented by the magnetic ﬂux density. The magnetic ﬂux density produced by
current is described by the Biot–Savart law. On the other hand, Ampere’s law
describes the global relationship between the current and the magnetic ﬂux density.
The magnetic ﬂux density is expressed by the curl of the vector potential and has a
nature of a ﬁeld with no divergence. The virtual surface on which the vector
potential is the same is the equivector potential surface. The relationship between
the equivector potential surface and the magnetic ﬂux density is discussed. We also
learn the magnetic properties of the magnetic moment produced by a small closed
current, which appears in magnetic materials.
6.1
Magnetic Flux Density by Current
We know that there exists a force between currents. This phenomenon is similar to
the Coulomb force between electric charges. Hence, we can presume that currents
also make some ﬁeld in space similar to the electric ﬁeld made by electric charges.
This ﬁeld is called the magnetic ﬁeld.
Magnets also make a magnetic ﬁeld. However, the magnetic ﬁeld source that we
can quantitatively deﬁne is current. In fact, the amount of current is deﬁned based
on the force between currents. In the case of magnets, the magnetic ﬁeld strength
depends on the substance of the magnet and its condition of magnetization, which
cannot be controlled exactly. We discuss the relationship between the current and
magnetic ﬁeld in this chapter. It should be noted, however, that we do not deﬁne the
magnetic ﬁeld itself but the magnetic ﬂux density to express the magnetic ﬁeld
strength. The relationship between the magnetic ﬁeld and magnetic ﬂux density will
be described in Chap. 9.

We suppose that two parallel straight wires separated by distance d carry cur-
rents I1 and I2, as shown in Fig. 6.1a. In this case, a force of strength
F0 ¼  l0I1I2
2pd
ð6:1Þ
works on each wire of a unit length. It is attractive (F′<0) for currents in the same
direction (I1I2>0) and repulsive (F′>0) for currents in opposite directions (I1I2<0).
The constant
l0 ¼ 4p  107 N=A2
ð6:2Þ
is called the magnetic permeability of vacuum. The unit of current, [A], is deﬁned
using Eq. (6.1). The magnitude of this force corresponds to the magnitude of the
Coulomb force on electric charges. That is, when electric charges of linear densities
k1 and k2 are uniformly distributed on two parallel straight lines separated by d, as
shown in Fig. 6.1b, the Coulomb force on each line of a unit length is given by
F0 ¼ k1k2
2p0d ;
ð6:3Þ
which is of the same form as the magnetic force of Eq. (6.1). Namely, the magnetic
force is proportional to the product of two currents and is inversely proportional to
their distance. The unique difference is that the magnetic force is attractive for
currents in the same direction.
The magnetic ﬂux produced by currents is largely different from the electric ﬁeld
produced by electric charges. The magnetic ﬂux can be visualized using magnetic
particles such as iron sand. For example, the magnetic ﬂux lies in a plane normal to
a straight current and forms vortices around it, as shown in Fig. 6.2. On the other
hand, the electric ﬁeld radiates from a line charge.
Below are the main differences between the electric interaction between electric
charges and the magnetic interaction between currents:

Current and Magnetic Flux Density

• Electric charges are scalars, and currents are vectors.
• While the electric ﬁeld is directed parallel to the straight line connecting the
electric charge and observation point, the magnetic ﬂux is directed normally to
both the current and the straight line connecting a part of the current and the
observation point.
• While the electric force between electric charges of the same kind is repulsive,
the magnetic force between currents in the same direction is attractive.
6.2
The Biot–Savart Law
The law that expresses the magnetic ﬂux density produced by a current is the Biot–
Savart law. Suppose that current I ﬂows along line C, as shown in Fig. 6.3. The
law states that the magnetic ﬂux density at point P produced by an elementary
current I ds ﬂowing in a small segment ds is given by

In the above, r is the position vector from the small segment to point P and

When there are many currents, the total magnetic ﬂux density is the superpo-

Here, we consider a current ﬂowing with density i in space V, as shown in
Fig. 6.4. The elementary current that ﬂows in a small region of length ds and
cross-sectional area dS is idSds ¼ idV with dV denoting the volume of this region.

Current and Magnetic Flux Density

One can see that this equation corresponds to Eq. (1.12) for the electric ﬁeld
produced by electric charges. The electric charge density q corresponds to the
current density i, and the vector product of current density and position is necessary
for yielding a vector for the magnetic ﬂux density. This explains why the magnetic
ﬂux density is perpendicular to the current.
Example 6.1. Current I ﬂows in a circle of radius a, as shown in Fig. 6.5a.
Determine the magnetic ﬂux density at point P located at distance z in the normal
direction from the center O of the circle.
Solution 6.1. We deﬁne angle u as shown in Fig. 6.5b. The elementary current in
the part u to u þ du has magnitude Ids ¼ Iadu and is directed normally to the
position vector from this segment to point P [h ¼ p=2 in Eq. (6.5)], as shown in the
ﬁgure. The magnetic ﬂux density at P produced by this elementary current is

remains:

Example 6.2. Current I ﬂows along a long straight line (see Fig. 6.6). Determine
the magnetic ﬂux density at point P at distance a from the line.
Solution 6.2. We deﬁne coordinates as shown in Fig. 6.6. The magnetic ﬂux
density produced at P by an elementary current Idz in a small region z to z+dz is
dB ¼ l0Idz
4pr2 sin h;
where angle h is deﬁned as in the ﬁgure and r ¼ ðz2 þ a2Þ1=2 ¼ a= sin h. The
relationship z ¼ a cot h gives dz ¼ ða= sin2 hÞdh. Thus, the elementary magnetic

Example 6.3. Current I is applied to the closed circuit shown in Fig. 6.7. AD is an
arc of a circle of radius a. Determine the magnetic ﬂux density at O, located at the
intersection of lines extended from BA and CD.
Solution 6.3. The angle h measured from the direction of elementary current Ids to
that of the observation point O is p on the section from A to B, and the magnetic
ﬂux density produced by the current ﬂowing in this branch is zero. On the section
from B to C, if the distance of Ids from point B is denoted by y, the distance
between Ids and point O is r ¼ y2 þ d2

Force on Current
The force on an elementary part ds of a current I in a magnetic ﬂux density B is
given by
dF ¼ Ids  B
ð6:9Þ
(see Fig. 6.8). This is called the Lorentz force in a narrow sense. From the
mathematical requirement that the force vector results from the product of two
vectors, the vector product appears again. The force that line C with current
I experiences in the magnetic ﬂux density B is
F ¼ I
Z
C
ds  B:
ð6:10Þ
We apply this to the case of a force on two parallel currents in Fig. 6.1a. The
magnetic ﬂux density that current I1 produces at the position of current I2 is B ¼
l0I1=ð2pdÞ using the result of Example 6.2. It is directed as shown in Fig. 6.9a.
Hence, if I2 is in the same direction as I1, the force on I2 is attractive. If I2 is directed
opposite to I1 as in Fig. 6.9b, the force is repulsive. This results in Eq. (6.1).
Since the current is composed of moving electric charges, the force on the
current is written as a force on moving electric charges. The force on the region of
Fig. 6.8 Current I in
magnetic ﬂux density B
154
6
Current and Magnetic Flux Density

length ds along the direction of the current I and cross-sectional area dS in the
magnetic ﬂux density B is
dF ¼ Ids  B ¼ idSds  B:
ð6:11Þ
Since dSds is the volume of this region, dV, we rewrite this force as
dF ¼ ðqv  BÞndV
ð6:12Þ
using Eq. (5.4). Since ndV is the number of electric charges in this volume, the
force on one electric charge is given by
F ¼ qv  B:
ð6:13Þ
For the special case where the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬂux density B
coexist, the force on the electric charge is
F ¼ qðE þ v  BÞ:
ð6:14Þ
This is called the Lorentz force in a broad sense. This equation shows that E
and B are important variables that connect electromagnetism with dynamics. The E-
B analogy is the standpoint from which electromagnetism is described using these
variables. Chapter 9 will include a description based on another standpoint.
We can easily show that the total force on a closed circuit, C, along which
current I ﬂows in a uniform magnetic ﬂux density is zero:

However, it should be noted that the torque, i.e., the moment of force on a closed
circuit is not necessarily zero.
For example, we suppose rectangular circuit PQRS in a uniform magnetic ﬂux
density, B, as shown in Fig. 6.10a. We assume sides PS and QR are normal to B.
When current I ﬂows in this circuit, the force aIBcosh works on side PQ, where h is
the angle between the unit vector n normal to the circuit and the magnetic ﬂux
density B. The strength of this force is the same as that on side RS, and these forces
are on the same line and directed opposite to each other (see Fig. 6.10b). Hence,
these forces completely cancel and do not contribute to the torque. On the other
hand, forces of strength bIB work on sides PS and QR in opposite directions to each
other, but these forces do not lie on the same line. Hence, a torque appears and
rotates the circuit (see Fig. 6.10c). Its magnitude is
N ¼ bIBa sin h ¼ BIS sin h;
ð6:16Þ
where S = ab is the area of the circuit.
The unit vector n speciﬁes the direction of movement of a right thumb when it is
rotated along the direction of the current, and the surface vector of the closed circuit
is deﬁned by S ¼ nS. Then, the torque is expressed in the form of a vector:
N ¼ IS  B; where N is a vector with the same magnitude as the torque and is
directed along the motion of a screw when a screw driver is rotated along the
torque. If we deﬁne the magnetic moment of the closed circuit as
m ¼ IS;
ð6:17Þ
Fig. 6.10 a Rectangular circuit with current I in uniform magnetic ﬂux density B, b two forces
that cancel each other, and c two forces that cause torque

Current and Magnetic Flux Density

the torque is given by
N ¼ m  B:
ð6:18Þ
Equation (6.18) holds for closed current I with an arbitrary shape on a plane in a
uniform magnetic ﬂux density. We can explain this as follows. Any given current-
carrying closed circuit is expressed as a superposition of small rectangular closed
circuits with the same current I, as shown in Fig. 6.11, since two currents in
opposite directions in adjacent closed circuits completely cancel out. The above
discussion holds for each small rectangular circuit. The magnitude of the total
magnetic moment is equal to the product of current I and the total area of the closed
circuit. Thus, we can prove that Eqs. (6.17) and (6.18) hold for any closed circuit
on a plane.
Example 6.4. Electric charge q of mass m is ejected with velocity v along the x-
axis in magnetic ﬂux density B along the z-axis. Discuss the motion of the electric
charge after ejection.
Solution 6.4. The Lorentz force given by Eq. (6.13) works on the electric charge
along the y-axis just after it is ejected. Since the force is directed perpendicularly to
the motion, a circular motion of the electric charge occurs (see Fig. 6.12). We
denote the radius of this circular motion as R. The magnitude of the Lorentz force

current of arbitrary shape on a

on the electric charge is qvB, and the centrifugal force is mv2=R. From the condition
of balance between these forces, we obtain the radius of the circular motion as
R ¼ mv
qB :
This circular motion of a charge is called cyclotron motion. The angular fre-
quency of the motion, which is called cyclotron angular frequency, is given by
x ¼ v
R ¼ qB
m :
Since the Lorentz force is always perpendicular to the direction of motion, the
work done by the Lorentz force is zero.
}
6.4
Magnetic Flux Lines
The electric ﬁeld produced by electric charges can be visualized by electric ﬁeld
lines. We can similarly see the magnetic ﬂux density with magnetic ﬂux lines. The
magnetic ﬂux line is deﬁned as follows: The direction of a tangential line at any
point on the magnetic ﬂux line is the same as the direction of B, and its line density
is deﬁned as equal to the magnitude of B. Figure 6.13 shows examples of magnetic
ﬂux lines. We deﬁne the magnetic ﬂux that passes through arbitrary surface S as
U ¼

The unit of magnetic ﬂux is [Tm2], which is newly deﬁned as [Wb] (weber).

Current and Magnetic Flux Density

From the examples in Fig. 6.13, it seems that magnetic ﬂux lines are closed
lines. This is different from electric ﬁeld lines that start from positive electric
charges and terminate at negative electric charges. If this speculation is valid,

where V is the interior of S. Since this holds for arbitrary V, we have

ð6:21Þ
In fact, we can prove Eq. (6.21) as described in Sect. A2.2 in the Appendix.
That is, the magnetic ﬂux lines are closed lines. Equations (6.20) and (6.21) are
called Gauss’ law for magnetic ﬂux and Gauss’ divergence law for magnetic
ﬂux, respectively.

Ampere’s Law
Consider the circular integral of magnetic ﬂux density B along a closed line, C:
I
C
B  ds:
When current I ﬂows in a straight line and C is a circle of radius R from the
current in a plane normal to the current, B is parallel to the line element ds (see
Fig. 6.14), and its magnitude B is a constant, l0I=(2p R), as discussed in Example
6.2. Hence, the above integral gives
I

B  ds ¼ l0I

and the value is independent of R.
Suppose a closed line, C, on a plane normal to the straight current I that does not
encircle the current. For simplicity, we assume that C is composed of two arcs with
different radii and two straight segments extending from the current, as shown in
Fig. 6.15. Here, we calculate the circular integral of B on C. We denote the angle of
arcs KL and MN as a. The integrals along these arcs are

On the two straight segments NK and LM, B is perpendicular to ds, and we have

Thus, the circular integral gives
I
C
B  ds ¼ 0:
ð6:23Þ
Using the above results, we can show that Eq. (6.22) holds when straight current
I penetrates arbitrary closed line C on the normal plane, and Eq. (6.23) holds when
this is not so. In the latter case, for example, we can realize an arbitrary closed line
with a set of small closed loops composed of two arcs with the center on the current
and two straight segments extending from the current, as shown in Fig. 6.16, and
Eq. (6.23) holds for each closed loop. Hence, we can show that Eq. (6.23) holds for
any closed line.
If I is deﬁned as the current that penetrates closed line C in Eq. (6.22), it includes
Eq. (6.23). This equation holds also when the closed line is not on a plane normal to
the straight current and/or when the current is not straight. Since it is
time-consuming to prove each of them, this will be proved indirectly using another
method.

This is called the differential form of Ampere’s law. Hence, if Eq. (6.27)
holds, then Eq. (6.22) must hold. The proof of Eq. (6.27) is given in Sect. A2.3 in
the Appendix.
From Eq. (A1.44) in the Appendix, we can see that Eq. (6.27) satisﬁes Eq. (5.11).
That is, the magnetic ﬂux density B is produced by a steady current. Equation (6.27)
shows that the current produces rotation of the magnetic ﬂux density. This is in
contrast with Eq. (1.21) that shows that an electric charge produces divergence of the
electric ﬁeld.
Example 6.5. Current I ﬂows uniformly in a long cylinder of radius a. Determine
the magnetic ﬂux density inside and outside the cylinder.
Solution 6.5. We can determine the magnetic ﬂux density using the Biot–Savart
law. However, it is not easy. On the other hand, this can be easily done using
Ampere’s law. We apply this law to a circle, C, of radius R from the central axis of
the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 6.17. From symmetry, the magnetic ﬂux density B is
parallel to a line element, ds, and its magnitude B is constant on C. Hence, the left

For R>a, the total current that ﬂows inside C is I, and the right side of Eq. (6.25)

This result is the same as for the case where the total current ﬂows along the
central axis. For R<a, the current inside C is (R=a)2I, and we have

Example 6.6. Current ﬂows uniformly with surface density s on a wide plane.
Determine the magnetic ﬂux density at a position at distance h from the plane.
Solution 6.6. We can easily obtain the answer using Ampere’s law also for this
case. Suppose a rectangle, KLMN, normal to the direction of current with two sides
(KL and MN) of length w parallel to the plane, as shown in Fig. 6.18. The other two
sides (LM and NK) of length 2h are normal to the plane. We apply Ampere’s law to
this rectangle. From symmetry, the magnetic ﬂux density has the same value on

same central axis as cylinder

sides KL and MN at the same distance from the plane, and its vectors are parallel to
these sides but opposite to each other. Hence, the contribution from these sides to
the circular integral of the magnetic ﬂux density gives 2wB. On the other hand, the
contribution from other two sides is zero. As a result, we have
I
C
B  ds ¼ 2wB:
The total current inside the rectangle is ws. Thus, we obtain the magnetic ﬂux
density as
B ¼ l0s

ð6:28Þ
It should be noted that this value is independent of the distance h from the plane.
Figure 6.19 shows the magnetic ﬂux lines produced by the sheet current. This is
similar to the electric ﬁeld produced by an electric charge distributed uniformly on a
wide plane (see Example 1.5).
}
As shown above, we can say that the Biot–Savart law for the local magnetic ﬂux
density produced by a current and Ampere’s law for the global relationship between
the magnetic ﬂux density and current describes the same magnetic phenomenon
from opposite viewpoints. This is similar to the relation between Coulomb’s law
and Gauss’ law describing electric phenomena in Chap. 1. Table 6.1 shows the
correspondence between electric and magnetic phenomena.
Although there is a difference between the scalar source (electric charge) and
vector source (current) that produce the ﬁelds, the correspondence between electric
and magnetic phenomena is clear. These sources cause a divergence of the electric
ﬁeld and rotation of the magnetic ﬂux density. As for the physical constants, the
magnetic permeability of vacuum, l0, corresponds to the inverse of the permittivity
of vacuum, e0
−1.

Vector Potential
The electric ﬁeld E is given by Eq. (1.24) in terms of the electric potential, i.e., a
kind of scalar potential. This originates from the irrotational nature of the electric
ﬁeld as given by Eq. (1.28) and from the mathematical property that the gradient of
a scalar is irrotational.
Magnetic ﬂux density is a solenoidal ﬁeld with no divergence, as shown by
Eq. (6.21). Mathematically, curl of a vector has no divergence, as shown by
Eq. (A1.44) in the Appendix. Hence, the magnetic ﬂux density can be mathemat-
ically expressed as a curl of some vector:

The quantity A is called the vector potential. As can be seen from Eq. (A1.45),
we could add the gradient of any scalar function to the vector potential, and the
vector potential would still correspond to the same magnetic ﬂux density. This
arbitrary gradient of some scalar function means the vector potential cannot be
uniquely determined without specifying some condition. In the case of static
magnetic phenomenon that does not change with time, the condition

is usually used. This is called the Coulomb gauge. We assume a new vector
potential,

satisﬁes Laplace’s equation.

potential produced by electric charge. These are compared in Table 6.2. The result
that the potential is scalar or vector depends on whether the source of the ﬁeld is

That is, each component of the vector potential satisﬁes Poisson’s equation. In
the region where current does not ﬂow ði ¼ 0Þ, this reduces to Laplace’s equation,
DA ¼ 0:
ð6:38Þ
This is also similar to the electric potential in electric phenomena. When a
boundary condition is given, A in Eqs. (6.37) or (6.38) is uniquely determined. One
can directly prove that Eq. (6.36) holds for the vector potential A given by
Eq. (6.33). This will be apparent from the proof of Eq. (6.33) in Sect. A2.4 and that
of Eq. (6.27) in Sect. A2.3 in the Appendix.
Example 6.7. Determine the vector potential for the case discussed in Example 6.5.
Solution 6.7. We use cylindrical coordinates. Since the current ﬂows only along
the z-axis, the vector potential has only the z-component Az, as indicated by
Eq. (6.33). In addition, from symmetry, it does not depend on z or the azimuthal
angle u. The magnetic ﬂux density has only the azimuthal component Bu. Thus, we
have
Bu ¼  @Az
@R :

Vector Potential

The vector potential is given by
Az ¼ 
ZR

BudR;
where R0(>a) is the distance from the central axis to the reference point at which
Az=0. The reason why inﬁnity is not chosen as the reference point is that the vector
potential diverges because of the requirement that the current ﬂows over an inﬁ-
nitely long distance. In fact, we ﬁnd that the vector potential directly estimated from
Eq. (6.34) diverges. This corresponds to the divergence of the electric potential for
an inﬁnitely long line charge (see Example 1.8).
We determine the vector potential as
Az ¼ l0I

Az ¼ l0I
4pa2 ða2  R2Þ þ l0I

from Bu ¼ l0IR=ð2pa2Þ for 0  R<a. In the above, the vector potential takes a
constant value on the cylindrical surface with the radius R. Thus, we can deﬁne an
equivector potential surface, which is similar to the equipotential surface. The
vector potential is parallel to the equivector potential surface.
}
Example 6.8. Current I is applied to an inﬁnitely long solenoid coil of radius
a with n turns in a unit length. Determine the vector potential.
Solution 6.8. Firstly, we determine the magnetic ﬂux density. Suppose rectangles
C1 and C2 as shown in Fig. 6.20. Applying Ampere’s law to these rectangles, the
circular integral of the magnetic ﬂux density is zero in each case. It shows that the
magnetic ﬂux density is constant inside and outside the coil. Since the magnetic ﬂux
density outside the coil must be uniform up to inﬁnity and the total magnetic ﬂux
168

Current and Magnetic Flux Density

must be ﬁnite, we can show that the magnetic ﬂux density must be zero outside the
coil. Then, we apply Ampere’s law to rectangle C3 to determine the magnetic ﬂux
density B inside the coil. The left side of Eq. (6.25) is Bl with l denoting the axial
length of C3. Since the total current inside C3 is nIl, we have
B ¼ l0nI:
Then, we can determine the vector potential with Eq. (6.29), but we use
Eq. (6.35) here. We apply this equation to a circle, C, of radius R from the central
axis of the coil in Fig. 6.21. Since the current ﬂows only in the azimuthal direction,
the vector potential has only the azimuthal component Au. Hence, this is parallel to
C, and its magnitude is constant. We have

Small Closed Current
Suppose that current I ﬂows around a small square of side length d. The vector
potential produced by this current is determined at a point, P, sufﬁciently far from
this square. We denote the direction vector from the center of the square to point P
as r. The assumption allows rj j ¼ r  d. We deﬁne the origin of the coordinates at
the center of the square placed on the x–y plane. Their sides are parallel to the x- or
y-axis, as shown in Fig. 6.22a. We also assume that P is on the y–z plane,
and h is the angle between r and the z-axis. Hence, the position of P is

Magnetic Charge
Magnets are materials that cause magnetic interaction similarly to currents. Magnets
have north (N) and south (S) poles. The force between poles of the same kind is
repulsive, and the force between poles of the different kinds is attractive. This
property is similar to that of electric charges. Hence, one can compare the magnetic
interaction between magnetic poles to Coulomb’s law for electric charges.
A magnetic charge is an imaginary source that causes magnetic interaction cor-
responding to the magnetic pole. In fact, it was assumed in the past that N and S
poles had magnetic charges, qm and −qm, respectively, and that a force similar to
the Coulomb force worked on magnetic charges. The force exerted by qm′ on qm
would then be given by
Fm ¼ l0qmq0
mr
4pr3
ð6:47Þ
similarly to Eq. (1.3), where r is the position vector from qm′ to qm and r ¼ rj j.
Since the magnetic force, Eq. (6.47), comes from some magnetic distortion in
space, we can deﬁne the magnetic ﬂux density B as the magnetic ﬁeld that quan-
titatively expresses the strength of magnetic distortion. When we express the
magnetic force as

Fm ¼ qmB;
ð6:48Þ
the magnetic ﬂux density is given by

It should be noted that this deﬁnition of magnetic charge is different by a factor
of l0
−1 from that used in other books, in which the magnetic ﬁeld H deﬁned in
Chap. 9 was used for the magnetic interaction instead of the magnetic ﬂux density
B. One can also deﬁne a scalar potential, /m, called magnetic potential similarly to
the electric potential. Its relation to B is
B ¼ r/m:
ð6:50Þ
Table 6.3 compares the charges, scalar potentials, and ﬁelds between electricity
and magnetism. However, we cannot apply this scheme in a space in which current
ﬂows.
Suppose that imaginary magnetic charges ±qm are separated by a small distance,
d, like an electric dipole, as shown in Fig. 6.23a. This pair of magnetic charges is
called a magnetic dipole. We deﬁne the magnetic dipole moment as
m ¼ qmd:
ð6:51Þ
The magnetic ﬂux density produced by the magnetic dipole is given by Eq. (1.46)
with p replaced by m. It was shown above that the magnetic ﬂux density has the same

form as Eq. (6.45) produced by a small closed current shown in Fig. 6.23b. Hence,
the magnetic dipole and the small closed current are equivalent to each other (see
Fig. 6.24). This also supports the formal correspondence between electric and
magnetic charges. It is empirically known that even when a magnet is divided into
small pieces, it is impossible for any piece to pick up only one type of magnetic pole,
as shown in the upper part of Fig. 6.24. This can be explained assuming equivalent
closed currents, as shown in the lower ﬁgure.
Thus, it may be advantageous in some cases to assume magnetic virtual charges
and compare them to electric charges, since we can directly use all knowledge of
electric phenomena. However, the obvious problem is that magnetic charge has
never been observed. That is, the magnetic ﬂux density empirically satisﬁes
Eq. (6.21), including the magnetic ﬂux for permanent magnets. On the other hand,
the right side should be equal to magnetic charge density qm multiplied by l0.
Hence, this results in qm=0. For this reason, textbooks now base their treatment of
magnetic phenomena on current.
Example 6.9. Currents I and −I ﬂow along lines at y ¼ d=2 and y ¼ d=2,
respectively, on the y–z plane, as shown in Fig. 6.25. Determine the vector potential
at point P sufﬁciently far from the z-axis. This pair of parallel opposite currents is
equivalent to a pair of virtual line magnetic charges and is called a magnetic dipole
line.

Solution 6.9. We deﬁne cylindrical coordinates, as shown in the ﬁgure, and
measure the azimuthal angle from the x-axis. We denote the distance between
observation point P and the line at y ¼ d=2 as R+. With the solution of Example 6.7,
we obtain the contribution of this current to the vector potential as

At sufﬁcient distance (Rd), the equality holds. In this case, the total vector sum

there is no problem of divergence. Az is constant on a surface on which the fol-
lowing condition holds:

6.9
Equivector Potential Surface
It is shown that an equivector potential surface exists in magnetic phenomena, as in
Example 6.7. This is a concept that corresponds to the equipotential surface in
electrostatic phenomena. Here, the characteristic features of the equivector potential
surface are discussed, and analogous points between the two surfaces are shown.
The equivector potential surface shown in Example 6.7 is characterized by the
fact that the vector potential has the same value and direction on the surface in
Cartesian coordinates. The vector potentials obtained in Examples 6.8 and 6.9 do
not have such equivector potential surfaces but have surfaces on which they have a
single component that is constant in other coordinates. Namely, the direction of
such a vector potential varies, while the value is the same on the surface. Although
these are not equivector potential surfaces in the strict sense, we treat them as a kind
of equivector potential surface.
Since the electric potential is a scalar, the equipotential surface corresponds to
both equivector potential surfaces. Here, we compare the equipotential surface and
the equivector potential surface for corresponding electrostatic and magnetic phe-
nomena. The ﬁrst case is the similarity between the electric potential produced by
an electric charge distributed in a long cylinder in Example 1.8 and the vector
potential produced by a current ﬂowing in a long cylinder in Example 6.7. These
surfaces have the same shape. A similar correspondence can be found between the
electric potential produced by a long electric dipole line in Example 1.9 and the
vector potential produced by a long magnetic dipole line in Example 6.9.
On the other hand, there is a case where the equivector potential surface has a
different structure from the corresponding equipotential surface. The equipotential
surface produced by an electric dipole is a surface on which
cos h
r2
¼ const:
ð6:58Þ
holds in polar coordinates. The equivector potential surface produced by a magnetic
moment is a surface on which
sinh
r2 ¼ const:
ð6:59Þ
178
6
Current and Magnetic Flux Density

holds. This difference comes from the different nature of the ﬁelds. If we change the
angle to h ! h þ p=2, however, sinh in Eq. (6.59) is transformed to cosh, and the
two surfaces have the same shape. A similar relationship can be found between the
equipotential surface given by Eq. (1.55) for the electric dipole line and the
equivector potential surface given by Eq. (6.54) for the magnetic dipole line.
Here, we prove two theorems on the equivector potential surface. The ﬁrst
theorem is that the vector potential on an equivector potential surface is parallel to
the surface. This is denoted as Theorem I. Assume a closed equivector potential
surface S. Integration of the vector potential on S leads to
Z
S
A  dS ¼ A 
Z
S
dS ¼ AnS;
ð6:60Þ
where An is the normal component of the vector potential on S, and S is the surface
area of S. The left side of this equation leads to
Z
V
r  AdV;
ð6:61Þ
where V is a region surrounded by S. Using the Coulomb gauge, r  A ¼ 0, this
quantity is zero. Hence, we have
An ¼ 0:
ð6:62Þ
Thus, the vector potential is generally parallel to the equivector potential surface.
The second theorem is that the magnetic ﬂux density on an equivector potential
surface is parallel to the surface. This is denoted as Theorem II. Assume a closed
line C on the equivector potential surface. Integration of the vector potential A on
this line gives
I
C
A  ds ¼ A 
I
C
ds ¼ 0:
ð6:63Þ
The left-hand side of this equation leads to
Z
S
B  dS ¼ U;
ð6:64Þ
where S is the surface surrounded by C, and U is the magnetic ﬂux that penetrates
S. Since this holds for arbitrary S, it can be said that the magnetic ﬂux density is
parallel to the equivector potential surface. Thus, if we denote the normal com-
ponent of the magnetic ﬂux density on the equivector potential surface by Bn, we
have
6.9
Equivector Potential Surface
179

Bn ¼ 0:
ð6:65Þ
Thus, the magnetic ﬂux density is parallel to equivector potential surface.
Theorem I holds generally. On the other hand, Theorem II does not hold for all
equivector potential surfaces. For example, the equivector potential surfaces in
Examples 6.8 and 6.9 satisfy Theorem II, while that for the magnetic moment does
not. It is clear that Theorem II holds for two-dimensional surface structures such as
a long cylindrical surface. In the case of three-dimensional surface structures,
Eq. (6.63) is not satisﬁed. We classify the equivector potential surface on which the
magnetic ﬂux density is not parallel to it as that of the second kind.
A similar correspondence can be found between the electrostatic phenomena
around conductors in Chap. 2 and the magnetic phenomena around superconductors
in Chap. 7. The equivector potential surface mentioned here does not include that of
the second kind, and hence, this is exact. One of examples are the electric ﬁeld lines
on the conductor surface (see Fig. 2.12) and the magnetic ﬂux lines on the
superconductor surface (see Fig. 7.13). The former lines are perpendicular to the
conductor surface of equipotential and the latter lines are parallel to the super-
conductor surface of equivector potential. So, the contrast is clear.

Column: (1) Forces Between Electric Charges and Between Currents
We have said that, since the source of magnetic phenomena is the current, a
vector, the resultant vector ﬁeld of magnetic ﬂux density must be given by the
vector product of the current and position vector. As a result, the magnetic
ﬂux density is perpendicular to both the current and position vector. The
magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the position vector, while the electric ﬁeld
is parallel to the position vector. So, these phenomena show really contrast.
Thus, these results follow the mathematical requirements and the corre-
spondence holds in this sense.
Here, we compare the forces arising from electric charges and currents. To
obtain a force vector for electric charges, we need the direct product of the
electric charge, a scalar, and the electric ﬁeld, a vector. Thus, the force
between electric charges of the same kind is repulsive. For currents, the
vector product must appear again to yield a force vector from the current
vector and the magnetic ﬂux density vector. Thus, the magnetic force is
perpendicular to both the current and magnetic ﬂux density. This explains
why the force is attractive between currents in the same direction. We again
show the correspondence between the forces based on the mathematical
requirements.
Column: (2) Coulomb Magnetic Field
In a space with no current, as in vacuum, the magnetic ﬂux density obeys
r  B ¼ 0
from Eq. (6.27). Hence, we can describe the magnetic ﬂux density in terms of
the magnetic potential /m as in Eq. (6.50) from the mathematical viewpoint.
Such a magnetic ﬁeld is called a Coulomb magnetic ﬁeld
6.9
Equivector Potential Surface

In the past the magnetic phenomena were described using virtual magnetic
charges and the Coulomb magnetic ﬁeld. This is the magnetic ﬁeld H deﬁned
in Chap. 9 and is equal to B=l0 in the present description. This method is
beneﬁcial because various descriptions of electric phenomena can be used to
explain some magnetic phenomena. For example, the static magnetic energy
can be simply determined as the work needed to carry magnetic charges in the
magnetic ﬁeld. This is not possible for currents because of electromagnetic
induction (see Column (1) in Chap. 8). In addition, from similarity to the
electric ﬁeld, one can easily show that the parallel component of the magnetic
ﬁeld is continuous at an interface using Eq. (4.22). In fact, this coincides with
the boundary condition of Eq. (9.24) when there is of no surface current on
the interface.
Thus, the magnetic ﬁeld in the absence of current behaves similarly to the
electric ﬁeld in the absence of a true electric charge. We can see such an
analogy between the electric ﬁeld in a dielectric material in Example 4.5 and
the magnetic ﬂux density in a magnetic material in Example 9.5.

Chapter 7
Superconductors
Abstract This chapter covers magnetic phenomena inside and outside a super-
conductor, in which the magnetic ﬂux density is zero. As a result, there is no current
inside the superconductor, and the superconductor is at equivector potential. When
a current is applied to the superconductor, it ﬂows only on the superconductor
surface in such a way that zero magnetic ﬂux density is attained inside. The same
thing occurs when an external magnetic ﬂux density is applied to the supercon-
ductor. The magnetic ﬂux density is directed parallel to the surface of the super-
conductor. A special method, i.e., the method of images, is introduced to determine
the magnetic ﬂux density outside the superconductor and the distribution of current
on the surface in such given conditions. It is theoretically proved that the electrical
resistivity of the superconductor is zero.
7.1
Magnetic Properties of Superconductors
A superconductor is a material that loses its electric resistance when cooled below
a characteristic temperature called the critical temperature. Many elements, alloys,
and compounds are superconductors. This state of zero resistivity is called the
superconducting state. A superconductor has not only this property but also
perfect diamagnetism. That is, when a magnetic ﬂux density is applied to a
superconductor, the interior magnetic ﬂux density is zero:
B ¼ 0:
ð7:1Þ
This state is called the Meissner state. When the temperature is above the
critical temperature, the superconductor is in a normal state with nonzero resis-
tance. In this case, the magnetic ﬂux density penetrates the superconductor. If the
superconductor is cooled below the critical temperature, the magnetic ﬂux is
expelled from the superconductor and perfect diamagnetism occurs. These dia-
magnetic phenomena are called the Meissner–Ochsenfeld effect.
The perfect diamagnetic state is realized by a current that ﬂows on the surface of
the superconductor, as will be mentioned. This is similar to the electric property of a

conductor that the inside is completely shielded by an electric charge induced on the
surface when an external electric ﬁeld is applied. In this chapter we study the
magnetic phenomena around a superconductor in the perfect diamagnetic state. The
perfect diamagnetic state of B ¼ 0 occurs in a type 1 superconductor or type 2
superconductor in a magnetic ﬂux density below the lower critical magnetic ﬂux
density (see Sect. A3.2 in the Appendix). Special knowledge is needed to under-
stand the physical mechanism that causes the zero resistivity and perfect diamag-
netism. This is not discussed in this textbook. Section A3.1 in the Appendix gives a
brief explanation of phenomenological theory. For a more detailed understanding, it
is recommended to read technical books.
Materials are roughly classiﬁed into conductors and insulators (dielectric
materials) with respect to their electric properties. For the magnetic properties,
materials are classiﬁed into superconductors and magnetic materials. The latter
will be covered in Chap. 9.
Since Eq. (7.1) holds inside the superconductor, from Eq. (6.27), we have
i ¼ 0:
ð7:2Þ
Hence, current ﬂows only on the surface of the superconductor. Equation (6.29)
generally gives
A ¼ ra
ð7:3Þ
with a denoting a scalar function. However, it is no problem to assume as
A ¼ const:
ð7:4Þ
in most cases. This is a special case of Eq. (7.3). If the superconducting region is
not simply connected but a magnetic ﬂux penetrates a space surrounded by the
superconductor, the vector potential in the superconductor is not a constant.
Equations (7.1), (7.2), and (7.4) correspond to Eqs. (2.1), (2.2), and (2.3) for
conductors, respectively.
Here, we discuss the magnetic ﬂux density in the vicinity of the superconductor
surface. Suppose a small closed surface of a pellet that includes the interface
between the superconductor and vacuum, as shown in Fig. 7.1. We denote the
height of the pellet and the area of surface inside the pellet by Dh and DS,
respectively. Assume that the upper and lower surfaces of the pellet are parallel to
the superconductor surface. We apply Gauss’ law, Eq. (6.20), to the surface of the
pellet, DS, and we have
Z
DS
B  dS ¼ 0:
ð7:5Þ
188
7
Superconductors

When the height Dh is sufﬁciently small, we can neglect the magnetic ﬂux going
out of the side surface. Since B ¼ 0 on the lower surface in the superconductor,
there is no magnetic ﬂux going out from this surface. Hence, we can conclude that
there is no magnetic ﬂux going out from the upper surface. This means that the
magnetic ﬂux density is parallel to the superconductor surface. That is,
B  n ¼ 0;
ð7:6Þ
where n is the unit vector normal to the superconductor surface and directed out-
ward. This is in contrast with the electric ﬁeld, which is normal to the conductor
surface.
Next, we discuss the current that ﬂows on the superconductor surface. Suppose
that the magnetic ﬂux density B is parallel to a wide surface of the superconductor,
as shown in Fig. 7.2. We deﬁne the coordinates as in the ﬁgure. We apply
Ampere’s law, Eq. (6.25), to a small rectangular closed loop, DC, with two sides of
length Dl parallel to the z-axis and two sufﬁciently short sides of length Dt parallel
to the x-axis. Since the magnetic ﬂux density inside the superconductor is zero and
there is no contribution from the two sides of length Dt, the closed curvilinear
integral gives
I
DC
B  ds ¼ BDl:
ð7:7Þ
This is equal to the current ﬂowing along the negative y-axis inside DC multi-
plied by l0, that is, l0sDl with s denoting the surface current density. Thus, we
have

B ¼ l0s:
ð7:8Þ
It should be noted that the directions of the current and magnetic ﬂux density
follow the right-hand rule. This relationship is also in contrast with Eq. (2.5) for
conductors.
As has been discussed above, magnetic phenomena with perfect diamagnetism
B ¼ 0
ð
Þ in superconductors are similar to electric phenomena with perfect elec-
trostatic shielding E ¼ 0
ð
Þ in conductors. This similarity is prominent in the E-B
analogy in electromagnetism. In addition, the correspondence of Eqs. (7.2), (7.4),
and (7.8) to Eqs. (2.1), (2.3), and (2.5) shows that the similarity between electricity
and magnetism is considerably deep. With the E-B analogy, it was possible for
someone even in the nineteenth century to predict the existence of a material with
perfect diamagnetism, i.e., a superconductor, just after completion of the Maxwell
theory. It might be expected that the proof of zero resistivity was easy, since the
shielding current must continue to ﬂow to keep the diamagnetic state. It should be
noted, however, that this proof was not justiﬁed, since the diamagnetism might be
caused by the magnetization, i.e., a magnetic property discussed in Chap. 9, for an
unknown material in the nineteenth century. In reality, the superconductivity with
zero resistivity was discovered independently of the above consideration in 1911,
and the perfect diamagnetism was discovered 22 years later in 1933.

Superconductors

Here, we show an example of magnetic phenomena associated with a super-
conductor. Suppose that current I is applied to a long cylindrical superconductor of
radius a. We determine the magnetic ﬂux density and vector potential inside and
outside the superconductor. We deﬁne cylindrical coordinates with the z-axis on the
central axis of the superconductor. The current ﬂows uniformly only on the su-
perconductor surface and the magnetic ﬂux density does not appear inside the
superconductor. Thus, the surface current density is s ¼ I=ð2paÞ.
We deﬁne a circle, C, of radius R from the central axis on a plane normal to the
axis (see Fig. 7.3). We apply Ampere’s law to C. Since the current distribution is
cylindrically symmetric, we can assume the magnetic ﬂux density also has cylin-
drical symmetry. Hence, the magnetic ﬂux density is parallel to C and its magnitude
B is constant on C. Thus, the left side of Eq. (6.25) is 2pRB(R). All the current
I ﬂows through C and the right side of Eq. (6.25) is l0I for R>a. We obtain the
magnetic ﬂux density as
BðRÞ ¼ l0I
2pR ;
R [ a:
ð7:9Þ
The magnetic ﬂux density outside the superconductor is the same as that when
all the current is concentrated along the central axis. For R<a, the right side of
Eq. (6.25) is zero. This gives
BðRÞ ¼ 0;
0  R\a:
ð7:10Þ
Thus, Eq. (7.1) is fulﬁlled inside the superconductor. We can also show that
Eq. (7.9) satisﬁes Eq. (7.8) on the superconductor surface (R=a) with the surface
current density s ¼ I=2pa.

Solution 7.2. We use cylindrical coordinates. From cylindrical symmetry the
current I ﬂows uniformly on the surface of the inner superconductor (R=a), and the
internal magnetic ﬂux density (R<a) is zero. The current is induced on the inner
surface (R=b) of the outer superconductor so that the magnetic ﬂux does not
penetrate the outer superconductor. This current is denoted by Ib. We apply
Ampere’s law to a circle C of radius R(a<R<b) from the central axis on a plane
perpendicular to the axis. Then, we have
I
C
B  ds ¼ l0ðI þ IbÞ:
Since B ¼ 0 on C, this gives Ib ¼ I. Since the total current is zero in the outer
superconductor, an opposite current, I, ﬂows on the outer surface (R=c) of the outer
superconductor.
If we denote the total current passing through C of radius R as IR, Ampere’s law
gives

magnetic ﬂux lines, respectively. The above results for the magnetic ﬂux density
and vector potential are formally the same as for the electric ﬁeld and electric
potential of the coaxial cylindrical conductor when electric charge is given to the
inner conductor (see Example 2.3).

There is a treatment called grounding for a conductor. What is the corresponding
treatment for a superconductor? It is to connect the superconductor with a current
path with inﬁnitely large capacity. In the above case a connection of the outer
superconductor to inﬁnity moves the back current on the surface at R=c to inﬁnity.
We also call this grounding. Then, the current is I at R=a and −I at R=b. The
magnetic ﬂux density and vector potential are.

superconductors, respectively. The length along the z-axis of each slab is l.
Determine the current that appears on each superconductor surface, the magnetic
ﬂux density, and the vector potential inside and outside the superconductors.
Solution 7.3. We denote the current ﬂowing on the surface at x ¼ b by Ib. Then,
the current at x ¼ a is I  Ib. So that the magnetic ﬂux density does not penetrate
the right superconductor; the current at x ¼ b Ib
ð Þ must be the same as the total
current in the region x  a, i.e., I  I  Ib ¼ Ib. Thus, we have Ib ¼ 0 and the
current at x ¼ a is I. The total current in the region of b\x\b must be zero
from Eq. (6.25) so that the magnetic ﬂux density is zero in the two superconductors.
Hence, the current at x ¼ a is I, and that at x ¼ b is 0. Thus, the magnetic ﬂux

Example 7.4 Assume a long hollow superconducting cylinder with inner and outer

B0 along the axis in the normal state of the superconductor, cool down the su-
perconductor below its critical temperature to make the superconductor supercon-
ducting, and remove the magnetic ﬂux density. This process is called the
ﬁeld-cooled process, and the magnetic ﬂux density at each stage is shown in
Fig. 7.11. Finally, the magnetic ﬂux density B0 is trapped in the hollow interior, and
a current with density s ¼ B0=l0 ﬂows on the inner surface of the superconductor.
Determine the vector potential inside and outside the superconductor.

Solution 7.4. The magnetic ﬂux density has a z-component in cylindrical coor-
dinates, and its value is Bz ¼ B0 for R\a and Bz ¼ 0 for R [ a. The vector
potential has an azimuthal component, Au, and from the relationship,

Thus, the vector potential is not constant even in the superconductor in which the
magnetic ﬂux density is zero. In this region, the vector potential is given in the form
of Eq. (7.3), and a is a multi-valued function given by
a ¼ Bza2

u:
This is the case in which the superconductor is not simply connected. That is, if
we assume a circle that has a radius between a and b with its center on the central
axis, this loop does not shrink to a point inside the superconductor.

7.2
Special Solution Method for Magnetic Flux Density
We determine the current distribution on the superconductor surface or magnetic
ﬂux density around a superconductor when the superconductor is placed in an
applied magnetic ﬂux density. The vector potential in the superconductor is con-
stant in space, as shown by Eq. (7.4). Outside the superconductor, there is no
current and the vector potential A satisﬁes Laplace’s equation (6.38).
When we are given the boundary condition on the surface of a treated area,
Laplace’s equation can be solved uniquely, as mentioned in Sect. 2.2. Hence, there
is only one solution for A in the space outside the superconductor, which becomes a
constant value on the surface of the superconductor. Hence, if some function sat-
isﬁes the boundary condition, it is a solution. This is the same as for the electric
potential around a conductor. Some solution methods are introduced here. It may be
helpful for readers to compare these methods with those mentioned in Sect. 2.2 for
conductors.

Superconductors

First, suppose we apply current I through a thin straight line placed at distance
a from a wide ﬂat surface of a superconductor, as shown in Fig. 7.12a. A current of
opposite direction appears on the surface of the superconductor to shield it and
exerts a repulsive force on I. We determine the distribution of the induced current
similarly to the electric charge distribution on the conductor surface in Fig. 2.11.
We deﬁne the x–y plane on the superconductor surface. Suppose that current
I ﬂows on the line at x = 0 and z = a along the positive y-axis. The magnetic ﬂux
density on the surface (z = 0) must be parallel to the superconductor, as shown in
Sect. 7.1. We can realize this situation by virtually removing the superconductor
and then applying a straight current with the same magnitude and opposite direction
at the symmetric position (x = 0, z ¼ a) with respect to the superconductor sur-
face. This will be conﬁrmed below. The vector potential in the vacuum region
(z > 0) produced by the two straight currents has only the y-component parallel to
the currents, and we calculate it as

using Eq. (7.12a). In the above, R 0 is the distance from the current to the reference
point. We can easily show that Ay = 0 on the superconductor surface (z = 0). Thus,
the condition, Eq. (7.4), is satisﬁed. Laplace’s equation is satisﬁed except at the
position of the current in the vacuum region (z > 0). Hence, we conclude that
Eq. (7.13) is the solution for the vector potential. The vector potential inside the
superconductor (z < 0) is Ay = 0. Thus, the method of images is useful also for
superconductors. The imaginary current placed at the mirror position is called an
image current.

This force is repulsive (F′ > 0). This is called the image force.
One can show that the current induced on the superconductor surface completely

ductor (z < 0).
Suppose we apply current I through a line, A, separated by distance d from the
central axis O of a grounded parallel long superconducting cylinder of radius a, as
shown in Fig. 7.14a. Now, we determine the vector potential outside the super-
conductor. We virtually remove the superconductor and apply an image current I′
through a line, B, separated by h from the central axis of the superconducting
cylinder, as shown in Fig. 7.14b, similarly to the example in Sect. 2.2. The vector

Example 7.5. In the above, we discussed the vector potential when straight current
I is placed outside the grounded superconducting cylinder, as shown in Fig. 7.14a.
Determine the vector potential when the superconductor is isolated.
Solution 7.5. In this situation, the total current ﬂowing in the superconductor must
be zero. Hence, we use a superposition. That is, we obtain the current distribution
by superposing currents −I and I in a way that makes the vector potential of the
superconductor constant. Current −I is distributed according to Eq. (7.24) and I has
uniform distribution on the superconductor surface. The former current and the
external current give the vector potential, Eq. (7.23), which we denote as A1zðR; uÞ.
The latter current gives the vector potential, Eq. (7.12a). Both of them satisfy the
requirement to be constant on the superconductor surface. Hence, the sum of these
components gives the unique solution. If we determine the vector potential so that it
is zero at a reference point, R = R0(> a), we have.

Suppose that a superconducting sphere of radius a is put in a uniform magnetic ﬂux
density, B0 (see Fig. 7.16). The superconducting current ﬂows on the surface to
cancel the applied magnetic ﬂux density inside the superconductor. Here, we
7.2

determine the density of this current and the magnetic ﬂux density outside the
superconductor. We use polar coordinates: the origin is at the center of the su-
perconductor and the z-axis is parallel to the direction of the applied magnetic ﬂux
density.
When a conducting sphere is in a uniform electric ﬁeld, the boundary condition
is fulﬁlled by assuming an electric dipole of suitable moment placed at the center of
the conductor, as discussed in Sect. 2.3. It seems useful to use a similar method
assuming a magnetic moment placed at the center of the superconductor. In fact, the
dipole moment of a pair of magnetic charges, which correspond to a pair of electric
charges, is equivalent to the magnetic moment of a closed current, as shown in
Sect. 6.8. This virtual closed current at the center ﬂows along the azimuthal
direction similarly to the real current on the surface.
The vector potential outside the superconducting sphere has only the azimuthal
component, Au, corresponding to the current. This component consists of Afu
caused by the uniform magnetic ﬂux density B0 and Adu caused by the magnetic
moment m. The former component is given by
Afu ¼ B0r

This is called magnetization. This corresponds formally to the magnetization of
magnetic materials.
The magnetization in a superconductor is given by the magnetic moment in a

magnetic ﬂux density that the superconductor experiences on its surface is different
from the applied value because of the geometry of the superconductor. Here, we
consider a simple case where there is no such geometrical effect. Suppose we apply
magnetic ﬂux density B0 parallel to a long superconducting cylinder along the z-
axis of radius a (see Fig. 7.18). The current ﬂows along the negative azimuthal
direction and produces a magnetic moment along the negative z-axis. The surface
current density is

This is the common deﬁnition of magnetization of a superconductor when it is

ð7:39Þ
as given by Eq. (6.46). Hence, the magnetic ﬂux density around the spherical

density is given by

The magnetic ﬂux density given by Eq. (7.32) can be derived using the rela-

210

is zero inside the superconductor. The value of the magnetic scalar potential is not
continuous on the superconductor surface on which the current ﬂows. This is quite
different from the vector potential.
The above result indicates that the electrostatic induction for the spherical
conductor treated in Sect. 2.3 can be solved using the vector potential. The obtained
result does not give us a correct image of the phenomenon, however.
Example 7.6. An inﬁnitely long superconducting cylinder of radius a is in a
uniform perpendicular magnetic ﬂux density of B0. Determine the vector potential
and magnetic ﬂux density outside the superconductor and current density on the
superconductor surface.
Solution 7.6. We use cylindrical coordinates with the z-axis at the central axis of
the superconductor and the azimuthal angle measured from the direction of the
applied magnetic ﬂux density. From a similarity with Example 2.7, we can expect
the following treatment to be useful for determining the vector potential: We vir-
tually remove the superconductor and place a magnetic dipole line produced by a
pair of anti-parallel straight currents at the axis. We denote the magnitude of the
magnetic moment in a unit length along the z-axis by ^m. From Eq. (6.53), the vector

From the above examples, we can understand that the interior of a supercon-
ductor is completely shielded with zero magnetic ﬂux density. This situation is
unchanged even for the case of a hollow superconductor. Hence, if we completely
surround a space with a superconductor, the effect of external magnetic ﬂux density
can be completely shielded in the space. This is called magnetic shielding and
corresponds to the electrostatic shielding attained by a conductor.
7.4
Prediction of Superconductivity
Perfect diamagnetism B ¼ 0
ð
Þ is a fundamental property of superconductors. It is
well known that superconductors have another characteristic property, i.e., zero
resistivity, although the zero resistivity is different from empirical property of usual
materials described by Ohm’s law.
As stated in Sect. 9.1, it was possible for someone to assume a material that
shows perfect diamagnetism based on the EB analogy even in the 19th Century
just after the completion of Maxwell’s theory. He would have been the ﬁrst person
who predicted superconductor with zero resistivity in the world.
Here, the proof of the zero resistivity property is treated. It may be supposed that
the zero resistivity can be easily proved, since the current must continue to ﬂow to
shield the applied magnetic ﬂux density. We have to consider the point, however,
that such shielding can be accomplished by the diamagnetism of the material itself,
as will be introduced in Chap. 9. Since this type of material was not discovered in
the nineteenth century, it was not possible to attribute the diamagnetic response to
the shielding by the current or the intrinsic diamagnetism.
Hence, we have to consider the case in which a current is directly applied to a
diamagnetic material. In this case, the current must ﬂow on the surface of the
material, as shown in Eq. (7.2). As shown in Fig. 7.19, here, we suppose that
rectangle C is located inside the material in such a way that one side is placed on the
212

surface and parallel to the current. The current density is integrated on C. The
integrated value is not zero on the side on the surface, while the contribution from
other three sides is zero. That is, we have

If Ohm’s law E ¼ qri holds, Eq. (7.45) leads to

E  ds 6¼ 0:
ð7:46Þ
This contradicts Eq. (1.30), which must be satisﬁed under static conditions.
Hence, the resistivity must be zero to be consistent with Eq. (1.30). The material
that shows B ¼ 0 under any conditions is nothing else than a superconductor. Thus,
the prediction of a diamagnetic material is equivalent to the prediction of a
superconductor.

Column: (1) Penetration of Magnetic Flux into Superconducting Hollow
Cylinder with Tilted Slit
Suppose we apply a magnetic ﬂux density parallel to a long superconducting
hollow cylinder with a tilted slit as shown in Fig. 7.20. Does the magnetic
ﬂux penetrate into the interior of the superconducting hollow cylinder without
passing through the superconducting region?
If axial magnetic ﬂux lines move along the radial direction, they surely
have to pass through the superconducting region, indicating that the magnetic
ﬂux cannot penetrate into the interior. Is this true? In practice, the magnetic
ﬂux penetrates into the interior and its density is the same as that of the
external one.
Remember here that a superposition holds for electric and magnetic
quantities. That is, the resultant magnetic ﬂux density is the sum of the
applied one and one produced by the shielding current. The shielding current
ﬂows on the surface of the superconductor, as schematically shown in
Fig. 7.21a. This is composed of the current ﬂowing on the surface of a virtual
hollow cylinder with no slit in Fig. 7.21b and that ﬂowing in the opposite
direction only in the region of the slit in Fig. 7.21c. The current in Fig. 7.21b
produces a magnetic ﬂux density of the same magnitude and opposite
direction to the external one in the superconducting region, resulting in
Fig. 7.20 Long

complete shielding there. The important thing is that the current in Fig. 7.21c
produces a tilted magnetic ﬂux at the slit. This shows the magnetic ﬂux
structure during the penetration. That is, the magnetic ﬂux is tilted when it
penetrates into the interior.
Column: (2) Intermediate State
When we apply an external magnetic ﬂux density to a superconducting
sphere, the superconductor expels the magnetic ﬂux from its interior. In this
case, some part of the superconductor experiences a magnetic ﬂux density
higher than the applied value because of the geometrical effect, as shown in
Fig. 7.17. Hence, even when the applied magnetic ﬂux density is below the
critical value, Bc, the local magnetic ﬂux density can exceed Bc, resulting in a
breakdown of the superconductivity. If we assume that the superconductivity
is completely broken, the magnetic ﬂux will completely penetrate the su-
perconductor, resulting in a magnetic ﬂux density of the same value as the
external one. This will bring about a recovery of the superconductivity.
However, this is contradictory. In reality, the superconductor goes into a state
in which the superconductivity is partially broken. This is called the inter-
mediate state. In this state the superconductor is in the layered structure
composed of the superconducting region with perfect extrusion of magnetic
ﬂux and normal region with penetration of magnetic ﬂux, as shown in
Fig. 7.21 a Flow of current on the superconductor surface, b that on the surface of virtual
superconductor with no slit, and c that in the opposite direction in the slit region. The current in
(a) is obtained by superposing those in (b) and (c)

Fig. 7.22. Since the size of these layers is of the order of several 10 lm, the
magnetic structure can be regarded as a uniform partially diamagnetic
structure on a macroscopic scale. However, we cannot use the condition
(7.4), so we need another method to determine the internal magnetic ﬂux
density and surface current density. This is the method using the boundary
conditions on the magnetic ﬂux density and magnetic ﬁeld, which will be
described in Chap. 9 (see Exercise 9.10). Figure 7.23 shows the magnetiza-
tion curve of a spherical type 1 superconductor. The ascending line starting
from the origin represents the perfect diamagnetic characteristic given by
Eq. (7.34), and the descending line shows the characteristic in the interme-
diate state.

Current Systems
Abstract This chapter covers magnetic phenomena in a current system composed
of more than one current loop. The relationship between the current and the
magnetic ﬂux in each current loop is generally described in terms of the inductance
coefﬁcients. Coils are a typical example of this current system, and the inductance
of various coils is treated. We use a current system composed of a superconductor
to determine the magnetic energy of the system. The merit of this method is that the
magnetic energy can be directly determined from the mechanical work needed
against the magnetic force, similarly to the electric energy. The magnetic energy of
the current system is described using the magnetic ﬂux and the inductance
coefﬁcients.
8.1
Inductance
In Chap. 6, we learned that the magnetic ﬂux is produced around currents. When a
current, I, ﬂows in a closed circuit, C, as shown in Fig. 8.1, the magnetic ﬂux
penetrating C is proportional to I:
U ¼ LI:
ð8:1Þ
The
proportional
constant
L
is
called
self-inductance.
The
unit
of
self-inductance is [Wb/A] and is newly deﬁned as [H] (henry). The self-inductance
is determined only by the shape of C and is deﬁned as a positive quantity. That is,
the directions of the current and magnetic ﬂux follow the right-hand rule.
Second, we suppose that there are two closed circuits and current I1 ﬂows along
circuit C1. The magnetic ﬂux penetrating itself is expressed as
U1 ¼ L11I1;
ð8:2Þ
similarly to Eq. (8.1). The magnetic ﬂux also penetrates the other circuit C2, as

while L11 is determined only by the shape of C1. If current I2 ﬂows along C2, the
resultant magnetic ﬂux penetrates C2 itself and C1. Thus, the magnetic ﬂuxes
penetrating C1 and C2 are formally given by
U1 ¼ L11I1 þ L12I2;
ð8:4aÞ
U2 ¼ L21I1 þ L22I2:
ð8:4bÞ
The self-inductances L11 and L22 are positive as mentioned above. The coefﬁ-
cients L12 and L21 are called mutual inductances and have the following
relationship,
L12 ¼ L21:
ð8:5Þ
The mutual inductance takes a positive or negative value depending on the
directions of the current and magnetic ﬂux.
Extending the above case of two closed electric circuits, we consider a system
composed of n electric circuits in Fig. 8.3, where current Ii ﬂows in the ith circuit Ci
(i = 1, 2, …, n). We express the magnetic ﬂux Ui penetrating Ci as
Ui ¼

LijIj:
ð8:6Þ
In the above, the Lij’s are inductance coefﬁcients. The Lii’s are self-inductances,
and Lij’s (i 6¼ j) are mutual inductances. The reciprocity theorem

Now we prove Eq. (8.7). From Eq. (6.34), the vector potential produced by

This is called Neumann’s formula. The result is the same even if subscripts
i and j are exchanged. Thus, Eq. (8.7) is proved.
Here, we show an example of calculating a mutual inductance. Two circular
coils of radius a are separated by distance d with a common central axis, as shown
in Fig. 8.4a. The currents ﬂow in the same direction. We deﬁne the coordinates as
in Fig. 8.4b and position vector r1 for the lower coil is ﬁxed at point P. Then, the
contribution from a small region dr2 in the upper coil to the mutual inductance is
written as
l0dr2
4p½2a2ð1 þ sin hÞ þ d21=2 ¼ l0adhðix sin h þ iy cos hÞ
4p½2a2ð1 þ sin hÞ þ d21=2 :
Integrating this for the upper coil, the y-component reduces to zero because of
symmetry, and only the x-component, i.e., the tangential component at point P,
remains. Here we put h ¼ 2w þ p=2. Then, after a simple calculation, we write the
above integration with respect to r2 as

ð1  k2 sin2 wÞ1=2dw;
where k ¼ 2a=ð4a2 þ d2Þ1=2. Although the integration is not simpliﬁed any more,
the above calculated vector is directed along dr1 and its value is constant. Hence,
224

integrating with respect to r1 gives simply the factor 2pa. Thus, we obtain the
mutual inductance as
M ¼ l0a
k ½ð2  k2ÞFðkÞ  2EðkÞ;

where F(k) and E(k) are complete elliptic integrals of the ﬁrst and second kind,

When the current path has a ﬁnite cross-sectional area, it is not easy to deﬁne the
magnetic ﬂux penetrating the electric circuit. This may indicate that the inductance
cannot be exactly deﬁned. However, the inductance can be exactly determined
using the magnetic energy, as will be shown later (see Exercise 8.3).

Example 8.1. Determine the self-inductance of a unit length of the parallel-wire
transmission line of radius a separated by distance d in Fig. 8.5. Assume that d is
much larger than a and we can neglect the magnetic ﬂux inside the conductors.
Solution 8.1. We suppose that current I ﬂows as shown in the ﬁgure. We assume a
plane that includes the axes of the two cylindrical conductors and calculate the
magnetic ﬂux penetrating the plane between the two conductors. The magnetic ﬂux
density produced by current I ﬂowing along the left conductor at distance x from its

Example 8.3. A circular coil is placed just between a parallel-wire transmission

Determine the mutual inductance between the transmission line and circular coil.
Solution 8.3. We calculate the magnetic ﬂux produced by current I ﬂowing along
the left line of the transmission line that penetrates the circular coil. Using
two-dimensional polar coordinates with the origin at the center of the coil, the
magnetic ﬂux density at (R, h) is B ¼ l0I=½2pðd þ R cos hÞ. Hence, the magnetic

Coils
In Sect. 3.2, we learned about the electric property of capacitors used for storing
electric charges in electric circuits. The component used to store the magnetic ﬂux
is a coil. Coils are also used for other purposes such as producing various magnetic
ﬂux densities or generating electric power, that will be covered in Chap. 10. Here,
we introduce the magnetic property of coils.
When we apply a uniform current, I, to a parallel-plate transmission line in
Fig. 8.8a, a magnetic ﬂux with a uniform density is produced in the space between
the two plates (see Fig. 8.8b). We assume that the distance d between the two plates
is sufﬁciently small and the magnetic ﬂux density on the outside can be neglected.
The magnetic ﬂux in the space is directed normally to the currents, and its density is
B ¼ l0I
b ¼ l0s;
ð8:14Þ
where s ¼ I=b is the planar current in a unit width. The magnetic ﬂux between the
two plates is
U ¼ Bad ¼ l0Iad
b
:
ð8:15Þ
Hence, we obtain the self-inductance as
8.1
Inductance
229

L ¼ l0ad
b
:
ð8:16Þ
The magnetic ﬂux density produced by parallel planar currents corresponds to
the electric ﬁeld of strength E = r=0 produced by planar electric charges in a
parallel-plate capacitor (see Fig. 8.8c).
The coil used to produce a uniform magnetic ﬂux density is a solenoid coil. For
example, when we apply current I to a long solenoid coil with a winding of n turns
in a unit length, the interior magnetic ﬂux density is uniform with the value
B ¼ l0nI;
ð8:17Þ
as shown in Example 6.8. This value does not depend on the radius or length of the
coil. For a coil of radius a, the magnetic ﬂux that penetrates one turn of the coil is
/ ¼ pl0na2I:
ð8:18Þ
Thus, the magnetic ﬂux penetrating the coil of a unit length is
U0 ¼ n/ ¼ pl0n2a2I:
ð8:19Þ
Hence, the self-inductance in a unit length is given by
L0 ¼ U0
I ¼ pl0n2a2:
ð8:20Þ
When the length of the solenoid coil is l, its self-inductance is smaller than L′
l and is expressed as.

ð8:21Þ
In the above, K(2a=l) is a function only of the ratio 2a=l and is called Nagaoka’s
coefﬁcient. Figure 8.9 shows Nagaoka’s coefﬁcient.
A spherical coil is a special coil for producing a uniform magnetic ﬂux density
in a limited space. That is, when current ﬂows on the surface of a sphere as given by
Eq. (7.33), the interior magnetic ﬂux density is uniform. Assume a spherical coil of
radius a with N turns as in Fig. 8.10a. We take the number of turns in a unit zenithal
length to be [N=(2a)]sinh, where h is the zenithal angle. When we apply current I,
the surface current density on the sphere is
s ¼ NI
2a sin h
ð8:22Þ
and from Eq. (7.33) we obtain the interior magnetic ﬂux density as
B0 ¼ l0NI
3a :
ð8:23Þ
To realize such a winding, the number of turns in a unit length along the axis is
N=(2a).
However, fabricating such a spherical coil is not easy, and the Helmholtz coil
introduced below is commonly used. This coil consists of a pair of circular coils of
the same size, as shown in Fig. 8.11. The radius of the circular coils is a, and the
distance between the two coils arranged on the common axis is 2z′. The center is

ð8:24Þ
When the distance between the two coils is too large, the magnetic ﬂux density is
locally minimum at the center, as shown in Fig. 8.12a. When this distance is too

short, the variation in the magnetic ﬂux density around the center is steep (see
Fig. 8.12b). No uniform magnetic ﬂux density is achieved in either of these two
cases. We obtain the optimum arrangement under the condition d2B=dz2 ¼ 0 at the
center, z=0, which gives
z0 ¼ a

ð8:25Þ
Figure 8.12c shows the magnetic ﬂux distribution for this condition. The mag-

the origin at the center of the coil. We regard the windings in the region z to z+dz as
a one-turn coil. The current ﬂowing there is dI ¼ ðNI=lÞdz. Using the result in

Magnetic Energy
The electric ﬁeld ﬁlls the space between two electrodes in a charged capacitor, and
we can regard the space as ﬁlled with electric energy. For a coil that stores the
magnetic ﬂux, we can also regard the interior space as ﬁlled with magnetic energy.
Here we suppose two superconductors in electrical contact with each other, as
shown in Fig. 8.14. One of them is a movable plate. Assume that magnetic ﬂux U is
trapped within the space surrounded by the superconductors. We can realize this
situation by using the ﬁeld-cooled process shown in Fig. 7.11. A current ﬂows on
the inner surface to shield the superconductors from the magnetic ﬂux. Hence, a

repulsive force given by Eq. (6.9) is exerted on the movable superconducting plate.
If the plate is displaced by distance x, the interior magnetic ﬂux density changes to

ð8:27Þ
and the density of current ﬂowing on the inner surface changes to
s ¼ B
l0

l0ða þ xÞb :
ð8:28Þ
We assume that a is much smaller than b. Since the magnetic ﬂux density
produced by the ﬁxed superconductor is half of the value given by Eq. (8.27), we
estimate the force on the movable plate to be

which is directed along increasing x. This is an isolated system, and there is no
electromagnetic interaction with the surroundings after the initial condition is
established. Thus, this force is attributed to the variation in the magnetic energy Um
of this system. From the relationship

ð8:32Þ
This is similar to the electric energy density given by Eq. (3.40).

8.4
Magnetic Force
Magnetic force works between current-carrying conductors. This force is equal to
the sum of the Lorentz force on each current. We can expect to derive this force
using the magnetic energy and the principle of virtual displacement, similarly to the
electrostatic force learned in Sect. 3.4. In fact, we learned the reverse process,
namely estimating magnetic energy from the Lorentz force, in Sect. 8.3. However,
we need to pay special attention when applying such a method to general cases.
We suppose that current I1 ﬂows in a straight line and current I2 ﬂows along a
rectangular circuit with two sides parallel to the straight line, as shown in Fig. 8.16.
These are placed on a common plane. Now we determine the force on the rect-
angular circuit using the Lorentz force. An attractive force works on the closer side
and a repulsive force works on the opposite side. If the distance between the straight
line and the closer side is x, the force on the rectangular circuit is
F0 ¼  l0I1I2

2pxðx þ aÞ ;
ð8:41Þ
where we deﬁne the force in the direction of increasing x to be positive. This force
is negative, i.e., attractive.
242

Current Systems

Next, we calculate the force with the magnetic energy. The magnetic energy due
to current I1 only and that due to current I2 only are expressed in terms of the
self-inductances of each circuit. These energies are independent of the displacement
of the rectangular circuit, since the self-inductances do not change under the relative
displacement between the two circuits. From Eq. (8.35) for n=2, the associated
energy is the interaction energy between the two currents, i.e., the energy from
mutual induction. The magnetic ﬂux produced by current I1 that penetrates the
rectangular circuit is

using Eq. (8.5). Thus, the magnetic force seems to be
F ¼  @Um

2pxðx þ aÞ :
ð8:44Þ
However, this disagrees with F′ in Eq. (8.41) which shows that there is a
problem with the above procedure.
What does this mean? The above procedure seems to indicate that the magnetic
energy decreases by FDx during the displacement of the rectangular circuit from x
to x þ Dx. However, the total magnetic energy must additionally increase by
Fig. 8.16 Long straight line and rectangular circuit

243

DUm ¼ 2FDx to reach the correct result. From the reciprocity theorem in Eq. (8.5),
half of this increment comes from the increase in the magnetic energy in the
rectangular circuit. We expect this to be caused by the induced electromotive force
V in the circuit. Namely, when the rectangular circuit is displaced by Dx within time
Dt, the work done by the induced electromotive force is VI2Dt. We can rewrite this
as DUI2 in terms of the change in the magnetic ﬂux that penetrates the circuit,
DU ¼ 

ð8:45Þ
Taking the limit Dt ! 0, we have
V ¼  DU
Dt !  dU

ð8:46Þ
This is the induced electromotive force that will be learned in Chap. 10.
What we can say from the above example is that estimating the magnetic force
from the magnetic energy is valid only when the circuit is isolated and the magnetic
ﬂux is conserved as treated in Sect. 8.3. In most cases, electromagnetic induction is
involved and such an estimation is not correct.
Column: (1) Method of Deriving Static Magnetic Energy
This chapter shows that there is a formal similarity between the electric
energy and magnetic energy. However, the method of deriving the energy is
completely different between the two cases. For example, the electric energy
is estimated from the mechanical work needed to carry electric charges from
inﬁnity until the ﬁnal distribution of electric charge is attained, whereas the
magnetic energy cannot be estimated from the mechanical work to carry
currents from inﬁnity. That is, there is a problem of divergence of the energy.
In addition, the more severe problem is that the ﬁnal energy must be negative,
since the work to carry a current is negative because of the attractive force
between currents of the same direction. Thus, we conclude that the magnetic
energy cannot be derived with this method. This is because of the induced
electromotive force mentioned in Sect. 8.4.
For this reason, we estimate the magnetic energy in a virtual experiment
using a superconducting circuit in this chapter. The merits of this method are
that it enables us to construct an isolated system from surroundings such as a
power source, and that it is free from electromagnetic induction since it
conserves the magnetic ﬂux because of the perfect diamagnetic property (see
Exercise 8.11).
Consider possible ways to derive the magnetic energy other than the
method introduced here.

Column: (2) Is Magnetic Flux a Magnetic Potential?
There is a famous analogy between the electric energy and magnetic energy,
as shown in Table 8.1. The electric energy is given by the product of the
electric source, i.e., the electric charge Qi and the resultant electric potential
/i divided by 2. On the other hand, the magnetic energy is given by the
product of the magnetic source, i.e., the current Ii and the resultant magnetic
ﬂux Ui divided by 2. Does this analogy mean that the magnetic ﬂux is a
magnetic potential, i.e., the vector potential? It is clear that the magnetic ﬂux
is not the vector potential. How can we explain such a disagreement between
electricity and magnetism?
The answer is that this difference is caused by the difference in the
dimension of the sources. Originally the electric charge density corresponds
to the current density, as can be seen in Table 8.1. For a conductor system, the
electric potential is constant in each conductor. In the ith conductor, the
electric energy reduces to

In the above, the volume integral was divided into the cross-sectional
integral and the integral along the current path as dV=dSds, and we used the
relationship ids ¼ ids. That is, the magnetic ﬂux is not the vector potential but
is the vector potential integrated along the circuit. This may be simply
understood from dimensions. In this sense, the magnetic ﬂux is a kind of
magnetic potential.

Chapter 9
Magnetic Materials
Abstract This chapter covers magnetic phenomena in magnetic materials. When a
magnetic ﬂux density is applied to a magnetic material, a magnetic moment due to
electron spins appears. This phenomenon is magnetization, and the magnetic
moment is assumed to be produced by virtual small magnetizing current loops.
Thus, the magnetic ﬂux density is produced by currents and magnetizing currents in
magnetic materials. We newly deﬁne the magnetic ﬁeld that describes only the
magnetic ﬂux density produced by the current. Magnetic phenomena are generally
described in terms of the magnetic ﬂux density and the magnetic ﬁeld. The
refraction of the magnetic ﬂux density at an interface between different magnetic
materials is treated. Finally, static electric phenomena and magnetic phenomena are
systematically compared in detail.
9.1
Magnetization
Some materials possess a magnetic moment that causes magnetic phenomena, when
an external magnetic ﬂux density is applied to those materials. These materials are
classiﬁed as magnetic materials. Commonly used permanent magnets are made of
magnetic materials and possess a magnetic moment even without an external
magnetic ﬂux density.
The appearance of the magnetic moment in magnetic materials is analogous to
the way the electric polarization arises because of a relative displacement between
electric charges of different signs in an external electric ﬁeld. In fact, it looks as if
the magnetic moment appears because of a relative displacement of magnetic
charges of different signs in an external magnetic ﬂux density, as shown in
Eq. (6.51). However, magnetic charges do not exist, as discussed in Sect. 6.8. On
the other hand, we learned that the magnetic moment can be equivalently expressed
by closed currents. This equivalent current that produces the magnetic moment is
called magnetizing current. However, true currents produce the static magnetic
moment only in superconductors. The magnetizing current in a magnetic material
cannot be taken outside. This is also similar to the polarization charge, which

251

cannot be taken out of a dielectric material. Thus, the magnetizing current is a
virtual substance like the magnetic charge. The magnetic moment is caused by
electron spins, electron orbital motion, nuclear magnetic moment, etc.
The resultant magnetic moment in a unit volume of a material is called mag-
netization and is represented by M. Its unit is [A/m]. This deﬁnition of magneti-
zation is the same as that for superconductors (see Sect. 7.3). The magnetization M
in a magnetic material is usually directed parallel to an applied magnetic ﬂux
density, B, and is proportional to B ¼ jBj. Thus, it can be expressed as
M ¼ vm
l0
B;
ð9:1Þ
where the dimensionless proportional constant vm is called the magnetic suscep-
tibility. Magnetic materials are classiﬁed into various kinds depending on the value
of vm. It is recommended to read technical books to learn more about different kinds
and characteristics of magnetic materials.
1. Non-magnetic materials: This group includes diamagnetic materials with
negative vm and paramagnetic materials with vm that is positive but smaller
than 1. The reason why the magnetization is proportional to the applied mag-
netic ﬂux density is that magnetic moments directed randomly tend to incline in
the direction of the applied magnetic ﬂux density, as illustrated in Fig. 9.1.
Table 9.1 gives the magnetic susceptibility for non-magnetic materials.
Fig. 9.1 Arrangement of individual magnetic moments in paramagnetic material a in the absence
of a magnetic ﬂux density and b in an applied magnetic ﬂux density
252

Magnetic Materials

If we apply Eq. (9.1) to superconductors, those with vm ¼ 1 may be classiﬁed
as diamagnetic material. However, the usual deﬁnition in electromagnetism is
different, as will be shown later.
2. Magnetic materials: Materials with positive vm of 102–104 are classiﬁed into
this group. The origin of this type of magnetism is spin of electrons. One group
of magnetic materials is ferromagnetic materials, with magnetic moments of
atoms aligned in the same direction, as shown in Fig. 9.2a. This alignment is
favored because the positive exchange interaction reduces the free energy.
Anti-ferromagnetic materials have magnetic moments aligned alternately
because of the negative exchange interaction, and ferrimagnetic materials with
magnetic moments of different magnitudes aligned alternately because of the
negative exchange interaction (see Fig. 9.2b, c). Thus, ferromagnetic materials
and ferrimagnetic materials have nonzero magnetization without an applied
magnetic ﬂux density. This magnetization is called spontaneous magnetiza-
tion. Even for materials with spontaneous magnetization, the total magnetiza-
tion in a specimen is sometimes zero. This occurs because the specimen is
divided into ﬁnite regions called magnetic domains. In each magnetic domain,
the magnetic moment is aligned in the same direction, and the magnetic
moments of these domains are directed randomly, as illustrated in Fig. 9.3.
When we apply a magnetic ﬂux density to such a specimen, the structure of its
magnetic domains changes in a complex manner, including movement of the
wall between adjacent domains or rotation of the magnetic moment in each
domain, etc. This results in a complex magnetization as shown in Fig. 9.4.
Suppose a thin magnetic slab of thickness Dh that is magnetized uniformly in the
normal direction. The magnetization of a small region in this slab is expressed by
magnetizing current ﬂowing around it (see Fig. 9.5). We denote the area of the top
surface and the surface density of magnetizing current by DS and sm, respectively.
The magnetizing current ﬂowing around the small region is smDh, and the magnetic

moment is Dm ¼ smDhDS ¼ smDV with DV ¼ DSDh denoting the volume of this
small region. Hence, the magnetization is given by
M ¼ Dm
DV ¼ sm:
ð9:2Þ
Namely the magnetization is equal to the surface density of the magnetizing
current. This relationship is similar to that of Eq. (4.2) stating that the electric
polarization is equal to the surface density of the polarization charge in dielectric
materials.
When this slab is divided into small regions as shown in Fig. 9.6, the magnetic
moment in each region can be expressed by the magnetizing current ﬂowing around
it. These currents cancel out between adjacent regions, leaving only the magne-
tizing current ﬂowing on the periphery of the slab. This is similar to the fact that the
polarization charge remains only on the surface of a uniformly polarized dielectric

material. When the magnetization is not uniform, the magnetizing current remains
inside the magnetic material.
This result may suggest that the magnetizing current in magnetic materials and
the magnetizing current in superconductors are similar to each other. However,
there is an essential difference between them. Suppose we apply a magnetic ﬂux
density along a long hollow magnetic material and a long hollow superconductor.
When we use reasoning similar to that for Fig. 9.6 for a magnetic material, the
magnetizing current remains not only on the outer surface but also on the inner
surface, as shown in Fig. 9.7. In this case, we can easily show that a magnetic ﬂux
density of the same value as the external one appears in the hollow. On the other
hand, the current ﬂows only on the outer surface of the superconductor, as shown in
Fig. 9.8, and the interior is completely shielded including the hollow. It should be
noted that the direction of the current is opposite to the magnetizing current because
of the diamagnetic nature of the superconductor. This difference comes from the
origin of the magnetic moment: The magnetic moment in magnetic materials

originates from the electron spins, which are equivalent to the magnetizing current,
while the magnetic moment in superconductors originates from the true current.
The currents cannot be necessarily expressed by a superposition of small closed
currents like the magnetizing currents.

A similar difference can be found between a hollow dielectric material and a
hollow conductor in a transverse electric ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 4.10. This differ-
ence comes from the difference between the polarization charge and electric charge.

and is the same as for the magnetization. Equation (5.11) is satisﬁed also in this
case as shown in Chap. 6, and hence, this is the magnetic ﬁeld produced by a steady
current. The deﬁnition of the magnetic ﬁeld is similar to the deﬁnition of electric
ﬂux density, which corresponds only to electric charges in dielectric materials.

Magnetic Materials

The word “ﬁeld” represents a fundamental property of space that exerts force at a
distance such as the electric ﬁeld. The corresponding ﬁeld for magnetic interaction
is the magnetic ﬂux density as described in Eqs. (6.10) or (6.14). In this sense, B
can be called the magnetic ﬁeld. However, H deﬁned by Eq. (9.11) has been called
the magnetic ﬁeld. As is customary, we will call H and B the magnetic ﬁeld and
magnetic ﬂux density, respectively.
As stated above, the magnetic ﬁeld H is the variable associated only with a
current. Hence, the Biot–Savart law and Ampere’s law are the laws for H. Namely
the general form of the Biot–Savart law is given by

ð9:14Þ
instead of Eq. (6.25). Equation (9.12) is the general differential form of Ampere’s
law.
Here we explain the deﬁnition of the magnetic susceptibility in Eq. (9.1). In this
deﬁnition, M is described in terms of B. This corresponds to the description of the
electric polarization in Eq. (4.1) and follows the E-B analogy. Hence, the dimen-
sionless magnetic susceptibility vm in Eq. (9.1) is consistent with the dimensionless
electric susceptibility ve in Eq. (4.1). However, electromagnetism currently uses the
deﬁnition
M ¼ vmH:
ð9:15Þ
In practical measurement of magnetization, the magnetic ﬂux density B applied
to a specimen is nothing else than l0H, which can be clearly deﬁned using current.
In this sense, there is no contradiction between Eqs. (9.1) and (9.15). Substituting
Eq. (9.15) into Eq. (9.11) gives

The relative magnetic permeability lr is a dimensionless parameter deﬁned by

ð9:18Þ
It is related to the magnetic susceptibility as
lr ¼ 1 þ vm:
ð9:19Þ
We can deﬁne the magnetic ﬁeld line for the magnetic ﬁeld H similarly to the
magnetic ﬂux line for the magnetic ﬂux density B. That is, the direction of a
tangential line at any point on the magnetic ﬁeld line is the same as the direction of
H, and its line density is equal to the magnitude of H.
Substituting Eqs. (9.12) and (9.16) into Eq. (6.29), we have

ð9:20Þ
Using the Coulomb gage, Eq. (6.30), for static magnetism, the above equation
gives Poisson’s equation
DA ¼ li:
ð9:21Þ
This is simply obtained by replacing l0 with l in Eq. (6.37). Hence, its solution
is given by Eq. (6.33) when l0 is replaced by l.
It should be noted that the magnetic moment produced by the current is not
included in the magnetization M, since the current affects only the magnetic ﬁeld H
in Eq. (9.11). That is, Eq. (9.11) is applicable only to magnetic materials and not to
superconductors. In fact, we have B ¼ l0H and M ¼ 0 in superconductors. Thus,
the magnetization in the superconductor cannot be expressed using Eq. (9.11).
However, the same term “magnetization” is used to express the magnetic moment
in a unit volume for both magnetic materials and superconductors. The magneti-
zation in a superconductor is proportional to the difference between the mean
magnetic ﬂux density in the superconductor and the applied magnetic ﬂux density,
as shown in Eq. (7.38). In other words, the magnetization is a local variable in
magnetic materials but is a variable averaged over a specimen for superconductors.
Example 9.2 Two magnetic materials have magnetic permeabilities l1 and l2.

Solution 9.2 We apply Ampere’s law, Eq. (9.14), as in Example 6.8. The mag-
netic ﬁeld is H = nI in both magnetic materials when current I is applied to the coil.
The magnetic ﬂux density is given by B1 ¼ l1nI and B2 ¼ l2nI inside materials 1

In Sect. 4.3, we discussed the conditions for the electric ﬁeld and electric ﬂux
density to be fulﬁlled at an interface between different dielectric materials. Here, we
discuss the conditions for the magnetic ﬂux density and magnetic ﬁeld to be ful-
ﬁlled at an interface between different magnetic materials. Suppose an interface
between magnetic materials 1 and 2 with magnetic permeabilities l1 and l2.
First we discuss the boundary condition for the magnetic ﬂux density. The
magnetic ﬂux density B satisﬁes Eq. (6.21). This is the same form as Eq. (4.16) for
the electric ﬂux density D when the electric charge density q is zero. Hence, using
the same procedure as that for deriving Eq. (4.19), we have
n  ðB1  B2Þ ¼ 0:
ð9:22Þ
That is, the normal component of the magnetic ﬂux density is continuous at the
interface. In the above, n is the unit vector normal to the interface and is directed
from material 2 to material 1.
Second we treat the condition for the magnetic ﬁelds. We denote the magnetic
ﬁelds in magnetic materials 1 and 2 in the vicinity of the interface by H1 and H2,
respectively. We assume that the plane containing the vectors H1 and H2 is normal
to the interface, as illustrated in Fig. 9.12a. Suppose a small rectangle, DC, on the
plane with two sides parallel to the interface, as shown in Fig. 9.12b. We integrate
the magnetic ﬁeld along DC. If the height Dh is sufﬁciently small, we obtain the
contribution only from the two sides parallel to the interface. We denote the unit
vector along the direction of integration on the upper side and the length of this side
by t and Ds. The integrations on the upper and lower sides are given by H1  tDs and
H2  tDs. Thus, the integration gives
I
DC
H  ds ¼ ðH1  H2Þ  tDs:
ð9:23Þ
264

Magnetic Materials

From Eq. (9.14), this is equal to the total current ﬂowing through the region
surrounded by DC. Since the height Dh is inﬁnitesimal, this is zero when the current
ﬂows with a ﬁnite density. This takes a ﬁnite value only when a planar current ﬂows
on the interface. Here, we use s and a to denote the planar current density and unit
vector normal to DC, respectively. These vectors are deﬁned to point along the right
thumb when it is rotated along the direction of the integration. The total current that
ﬂows through DC is s  aDs. Using the relationship a  n ¼ t, Eq. (9.23) gives
½n  ðH1  H2Þ  a ¼ s  a;
and ﬁnally, we obtain
n  ðH1  H2Þ ¼ s:
ð9:24Þ
In the above, we assumed that the plane containing H1 and H2 is normal to the
interface. You can prove this assumption in Exercise 9.3. Equation (9.24) states that
a planar current ﬂows on the interface and its density is equal to the difference in the
parallel component of the magnetic ﬁeld. When there is no planar current, the
parallel component of the magnetic ﬁeld is continuous. This condition is satisﬁed in
Example 9.2.

interface and b small rectangle on the plane that contains the interface

Now, we describe the above boundary conditions using the vector potential. We
denote the vector potentials in magnetic materials 1 and 2 in the vicinity of the
interface by A1 and A2, respectively. Then, Eqs. (9.22) and (9.24) are rewritten as

The main component of the vector potential is parallel to the current in the
vicinity of the interface, as can be seen from Eq. (6.33). The current ﬂows along the
direction of a, and we denote the corresponding component of the vector potential
by Aa. Thus, we have
r  A ¼  @Aa
@n t þ @Aa
@t n;
ð9:27Þ
where ∂=∂n and ∂=∂t are the derivatives along the directions of n and t. Hence,
Eq. (9.25) gives

Example 9.3 Magnetic materials 1 and 2 of magnetic permeabilities l1 and l2
each occupy half of the space between two long parallel superconducting plates, as
shown in Fig. 9.13. We apply current I to each superconducting plate in opposite
directions. Determine the magnetic ﬂux density and magnetic ﬁeld in each magnetic
material and self-inductance in a unit length of superconducting plates. Assume that
the width of the plate, w, is sufﬁciently long in comparison with the distance, d,
between the two plates.

Solution 9.3 The magnetic ﬂux density and magnetic ﬁeld are directed parallel to
the superconducting plates in the space between them. We denote these values in
magnetic materials 1 and 2 by B1, H1, B2, and H2. From Eq. (9.22), we have
B1 ¼ B2;
which gives
H2 ¼ l1

H1:
We apply Eq. (9.14) to rectangle C in Fig. 9.13. If the surface current density on
the superconducting plate in this region is s1, we have H1l=s1l. This reduces to
H1 ¼ s1:
The surface current density on the superconducting plate in contact with mag-
netic material 2 is
s2 ¼ H2 ¼ l1

Since the total current I is equal to ðw=2Þðs1 þ s2Þ, we obtain

It should be noted that the situation is not simple if the superconducting plates
are replaced with usual conducting plates. This situation is similar to that in
Example 4.3.
}
Here we derive the boundary conditions on the surface of a superconductor from
the above general boundary conditions. We denote the vacuum and superconductor
as regions 1 and 2, respectively. We use l0 for the magnetic permeability of the
superconductor. Since B2=0, we can say from Eq. (9.22) that the magnetic ﬂux
density is parallel to the surface. Equation (9.24) derives H1=s, which gives the
same result as Eq. (7.8),
B1 ¼ l0s:
ð9:31Þ
Here we discuss the refraction of magnetic ﬂux lines and magnetic ﬁeld lines
using the boundary conditions. Suppose an interface between magnetic materials
with magnetic permeabilities l1 and l2 (see Fig. 9.14). We assume that magnetic
ﬂux density B1 is applied in material 1 in the direction of angle h1 from the normal
direction to the interface. We denote by B2 and h2 the magnitude and angle of
magnetic ﬂux density in material 2. The continuity of the normal component of the
magnetic ﬂux density gives
B1 cos h1 ¼ B2 cos h2:

Solution 9.4 From the continuity of the parallel component of the magnetic ﬁeld

Example 9.5 A magnetic sphere of radius a is in a uniform magnetic ﬂux density

and surface magnetizing current density.
Solution 9.5 We deﬁne polar coordinates as in Example 9.1. We can assume that
magnetization is uniform in the magnetic material. Hence, the magnetic ﬂux density
outside the sphere is given by the sum of the applied magnetic ﬂux density and the
contribution of the magnetic moment placed at the origin after removal of
the sphere. We expect a uniform magnetic ﬂux density inside the sphere due to the
uniform magnetization. We denote the magnetic moment directed to the z-axis by
m. Equations (6.45a and 6.45b) give the radial and zenithal components of the
magnetic ﬂux density outside the sphere due to the magnetic moment

To determine the vector potential in the vacuum region (z>0), we virtually
assume that all the space is vacuum and the vector potential is given by the sum of
the component caused by I and that caused by the image current I′ placed at the
mirror position with respect to the surface of the magnetic material, as shown in
Fig. 9.19a. Hence, the vector potential has only the y-component, Ay, and depends
only on x and z. The vector potential at point (x, z) in the vacuum is given by

a magnetic cylinder of magnetic permeability l and the same radius into the hollow
to depth x from the edge, as shown in Fig. 9.21b. How does the current change?

Solution 9.9 The magnetic ﬂux density in the hollow before insertion of the
magnetic material is B ¼ l0I=l. This does not change even after the insertion. This
is because the magnetic ﬂux does not appear or disappear, and the magnetic ﬂux
lines must go out of or into the hollow for the change to occur. However, this is
prohibited by the superconductor.
Hence, the surface current density is s ¼ I=l in the region where the magnetic
material is not inserted but changes to s ¼ l0I=ðllÞ in the region where the mag-
netic material is inserted. Thus, the total current changes to

Since l>l0 in normal magnetic materials, we have F>0. That is, the force is
directed along the positive x-axis and attractive. In this problem, the magnetic ﬂux

Analogy Between Electric and Magnetic Phenomena
In Part II, we learned static magnetic phenomena through similarities to and dif-
ferences from static electric phenomena in Part I. To understand these phenomena
further, we summarize the corresponding relationships here. Tables 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4
give
the
electromagnetic
variables,
equations,
and
boundary
conditions,
respectively.
It is also useful to refer to Table 6.1, which summarizes integral equations
corresponding to the differential equations in Table 9.3 and Table 6.2, which
summarizes the potentials. In these tables, it is necessary to replace e0 and l0 with e
and l, respectively, for generalization.
The contents in Tables 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4 are explained as follows:
1. The most fundamental variables are the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬂux
density B, which are directly connected to the force. That is, these variables
describe the ﬁelds in electric and magnetic phenomena. The electric ﬁeld is a

conservative ﬁeld with no rotation and is given by a gradient of the scalar
potential, the electrostatic potential. On the other hand, the magnetic ﬂux density
is a ﬁeld with no divergence and is given by a curl of the vector potential.
2. The secondary fundamental variables are the electric ﬂux density D and the
magnetic ﬁeld H, which are associated with source-1 quantities such as electric
charges and currents. The electric charge causes a divergence of the electric ﬂux
density and the current causes a curl of the magnetic ﬁeld.
3. The supplementary variables are the electric polarization P and the magneti-
zation M, and these are associated with source-2 quantities, which cannot be
taken out of materials. That is, the polarization charge causes a divergence of the
electric polarization and the magnetizing current causes a curl of the magneti-
zation. The signs are opposite between electric polarization and magnetization
because only magnetic materials do not shield themselves from an applied ﬁeld.
This is mathematically expressed by the fact that the relative dielectric constant
er and relative magnetic permeability lr are larger than 1.
4. Table 9.4 summarizes the conditions for the fundamental variables on a
boundary. For the primary fundamental variables, the parallel component of the
electric ﬁeld is continuous because there is no rotation, and the normal compo-
nent of the magnetic ﬂux density is continuous because there is no divergence.
For secondary fundamental variables, the corresponding components can be
discontinuous at a boundary because of the existence of the source-1 quantities.
That is, the normal component of the electric ﬂux density is discontinuous by an
amount equal to the surface charge density, and the parallel component of the
magnetic ﬁeld is discontinuous by an amount equal to the surface current density.
When there is no such source, these components are continuous.
5. We compare special phenomena in electricity and magnetism in conductors and
superconductors in Table 9.5. The primary fundamental variables, the electric
ﬁeld and magnetic ﬂux density, are zero inside the respective materials, and the
source-1 quantities, the charge and current, exist only on the surface. There are
no source-2 quantities or resultant supplementary variables. To satisfy the
boundary conditions in Table 9.4, the electric ﬁeld is normal, and the magnetic
ﬂux density is parallel to the surface. The values of these variables on the
surface are proportional to the surface densities of the source-1 quantities.

Table 9.6 summarizes electric and magnetic phenomena in the E-H analogy, in
which H is treated as a primary fundamental variable. In the past, Coulomb’s law
was used for assumed magnetic charges. This method is beneﬁcial as a mathe-
matical analogy. In this case, the magnetization M and the magnetic charge qm
correspond to l0M and l0qm in this textbook, respectively.
Column: (1) Magnetic Shielding by a Superconductor and That by a
Magnetic Material
In the Column in Chap. 4, we showed that electric shielding by a conductor
and that by a dielectric material are similar phenomena in spite of the
quantitative difference. How about the magnetic shielding by superconductor
and that by magnetic material?
From correspondence with Chap. 4, we can derive Eq. (7.32) for the
magnetic ﬂux density around a superconducting sphere by taking the mag-
netic ﬂux density around the magnetic sphere in Example 9.5 in the limit
l ! 0. In this case, although a magnetic ﬁeld of ﬁnite strength remains inside
the superconducting sphere, we can disregard it because it has no meaning.
This is similar to electric phenomena as shown in the Column in Chap. 4.
However, the essential difference is that the magnetization in a super-
conductor is negative, while the magnetization in a magnetic material is
positive. The internal magnetic ﬂux density is weakened in a superconductor
from the outside, and the shielding is really similar to electric shielding.

However, the situation is completely different for a magnetic material.
Namely the internal magnetic ﬂux density is strengthened in comparison with
the external value because of the positive magnetization (see Eq. (9.37) and
Fig. 9.17). This characteristic property of magnetic material comes from the
origin of the magnetic moment. Is such a magnetic material useful for
magnetic shielding?
The answer is yes. When we make a slit with the structure in Fig. E9.3 in
Exercise 9.4, the magnetic ﬂux density inside the slit decreases by a factor of
l0=l from the value in the surrounding magnetic material. Namely magnetic
ﬂux lines are likely to pass through the region with higher magnetic per-
meability. It is possible to weaken the magnetic ﬂux density in a target region
by introducing the magnetic ﬂux to other regions using this property.
Column: (2) Magnetization and Electric Polarization
The substance in a material that causes the magnetic action is the magnetic
moment, and the current in a superconductor and the virtual magnetizing
current in a magnetic material are the origins of the magnetic moment.
However, there is a problem in the fact that the same term “magnetization” is
used to express the magnetic moment in a unit volume even for different
origins. The mathematical description is different. For example, according to
the deﬁnition of magnetization used for magnetic materials, the magnetization
in superconductors is zero as mentioned in Sect. 9.2. Hence, we need a new
term such as magnetic moment density instead of magnetization to deﬁne
the magnetic moment in a unit volume of superconductor.
Electric polarization in dielectric materials is comparable to the magneti-
zation. The electric action is caused by a relative displacement of polarization
charges of different signs that cannot move freely in a given electric ﬁeld and
partially contributes to the shielding of the material from the external electric
ﬁeld. This electric phenomenon is quantitatively characterized by the electric
polarization P, the electric dipole moment in a unit volume. A similar electric
phenomenon in conductors is the perfect electrostatic shielding by electric
charges that can move freely. This phenomenon can also be explained by a
relative displacement of electric charges of different signs as discussed in
Sect. 2.3. That is, appearance of electric dipoles is common for both electric
phenomena (see, for example, Eq. (2.30) for a conductor). This situation is
similar to the production of a magnetic moment by two kinds of origin
mentioned above. Since the electric dipole moment in a unit volume had not
been discussed for a conductor, there was no confusion as with the magne-
tization in a magnetic material and superconductor. However, it is meaningful
to study the similarity between the electrostatic shielding in a conductor and
the electric polarization in a dielectric material. In this sense, we need a new
term such as electric moment density to deﬁne the electric dipole moment in
a unit volume of conductor.

Chapter 10
Electromagnetic Induction
Abstract This chapter covers the electromagnetic induction, which is one of most
important phenomena that describe electric and magnetic ﬁelds varying with time.
The electromotive force appears to induce a current in a closed circuit in such a way
as to reduce any change in the magnetic ﬂux penetrating it. This is Faraday’s law.
As a result, the electric ﬁeld is no longer irrotational and has a vortex caused by a
variation in the magnetic ﬂux density with time. Faraday’s law is rewritten for the
local relationship called the motional law, E = v  B, in terms of the velocity v of a
material in a space with a magnetic ﬂux density B. The magnetic energy, which is
covered in Chap. 8, is estimated again from the electric energy that the electric
power source supplies under the electromagnetic induction. Finally, the skin effect
is discussed in association with the electromagnetic induction.
10.1
Induction Law
Magnetic ﬂux density is produced by current as described in Chap. 6. Faraday
conducted experiments based on the idea that current might be produced by
magnetic ﬂux density. Although he could not produce a steady current by using a
static magnetic ﬂux density, he produced a non-steady current by varying a mag-
netic ﬂux density with time. The results are summarized as follows. Suppose two
coils. When a current is applied to coil 1 as shown in Fig. 10.1, a magnetic ﬂux
density is produced around it. A current ﬂows in coil 2 in the following cases:
1. the current in coil 1 changes as shown in Fig. 10.1a;
2. coil 1 is moved as shown in Fig. 10.1b.
This phenomenon is called electromagnetic induction, and the electromotive
force that induces the current in coil 2 is called induced electromotive force. One
can observe that the current ﬂows in coil 2 in such a way as to reduce any change in
the magnetic ﬂux penetrating coil 2. This shows a conservative property in nature
similarly to the law of inertia for the matter.

From the above results, if the magnetic ﬂux that penetrates the coil is U, the
induced electromotive force in the coil is given by
Vem ¼  dU
dt ;
ð10:1Þ
where the directions of magnetic ﬂux and electromotive force follow the right-hand
rule. This is exactly the result predicted in Sect. 8.4 and is called Faraday’s law.
This shows that the variation in magnetic ﬂux with time causes the electromotive
force. In this sense, this is also called the magnetic ﬂux law or transformer law. If
the number of turns of the coil is N and the magnetic ﬂux that penetrates one turn of
the coil is U, the electromotive force is
Vem ¼ N dU
dt :
ð10:2Þ
Here we calculate the electromotive force induced in a solenoid coil of radius
a and number of turns N that is rotating with angular frequency x in a uniform
magnetic ﬂux density, B, as shown in Fig. 10.2. If the angle between the coil axis
and magnetic ﬂux density is h=xt, the magnetic ﬂux that penetrates one turn of the
coil is U ¼ pa2B cos xt, and the electromotive force is
Vem ¼ pNa2Bx sin xt:
ð10:3Þ
Here, we derive the differential expression of Faraday’s law for the above case
(1). Using the electric ﬁeld, the electromotive force induced in closed coil 2 is
written as

In the above, we changed the order of the surface integral and differentiation

change the total differentiation with time is changed to partial differentiation, since
we are treating a stationary system. The relationship, Eq. (10.6), holds for arbitrary
S, and we have
r  E ¼  @B

ð10:7Þ
This is the differential form of the induction law. When the magnetic ﬂux
density does not change with time, Eq. (10.7) reduces to the equation for electro-
static ﬁeld, Eq. (1.28). Hence, we can conclude that the electric ﬁeld given by
Eq. (10.7) is a general electric ﬁeld that includes the induced and static components.

Second, we consider case (2) where coil 2 of closed loop C moves with the
velocity v in a magnetic ﬂux density B that does not change with time. The area of

Hence, the total magnetic ﬂux that enters the coil during Dt is

Hence, from Eqs. (10.4) and (10.10), we obtain the relationship describing the
induced electric ﬁeld,
E ¼ v  B:
ð10:11Þ
This is called the motional law. Mathematically, the induced electric ﬁeld
should be given by E ¼ v  B  r/ with / being an arbitrary scalar function.
However, it is empirically known that ∇/ is zero in usual cases. Electrons in a
conductor of a coil suffer the Lorentz force, ev  B, when the coil moves with the
velocity v. We can think of this force as a force caused by the electric ﬁeld,
Eq. (10.11), induced in the coil.

Thus, we can conclude that the electromotive force induced in the coil is caused
by the change in the magnetic ﬂux that penetrates the coil in both cases (1) and (2).

ð10:13Þ
When the velocity is constant, the ﬁrst term on the right side is zero. The total

ð10:15Þ
Thus, we have derived Eq. (10.7), indicating that the above conclusion is valid.
When a conductor carries current I in magnetic ﬂux density B, the Lorentz force
acts on the conductor. If this force forces the conductor to move with velocity v, the
power in a unit length of the conductor given by the Lorentz force is
F0  v ¼ ðI  BÞ  v:
ð10:16Þ
This seems to contradict the fact that the Lorentz force does not do any work on
electric charges (see Example 6.4). In a practical case, the induced electric ﬁeld
directed opposite to the current works to reduce the current. To have the same
current continue to ﬂow, the electric power source must supply additional electric
power,
I  ðv  BÞ ¼ ðI  BÞ  v;
ð10:17Þ
which is equal to the power given by the Lorentz force. That is, the power by the
Lorentz force is nothing other than the electric power by the electric source (see
Exercise 10.9).

where LB is the self-inductance of coil B wound on a magnetic material;

Thus, the relationship, IB=IA ¼ NA=NB, holds. The voltages induced in coils A

as VB=VA ¼ NB=NA. This is the principle of the transformer.

Example 10.2. A triangular closed circuit and a straight current, I, are placed on a
common plane. The closed circuit is moving away with velocity v from the current,
as shown in Fig. 10.5. The distance between the closed circuit and the current is
r=r0 in the initial condition (t=0). Determine the electromotive force induced in the
closed circuit with the magnetic ﬂux law. We deﬁne the electromotive force to be
positive along the direction of ABC.

The direction of the magnetic ﬂux produced by current I inside the circuit is the
same as that of the magnetic ﬂux produced by the current ﬂowing along ABC.
Hence, the magnetic ﬂux produced by current I is positive. The magnetic ﬂux
density at distance x from the current is BðxÞ ¼ l0I=ð2pxÞ. The magnetic ﬂux

Example 10.3. Determine the electromotive force in Example 10.2 with the mo-
tional law.
Solution 10.3. Figure 10.6a shows the direction of the induced electric ﬁeld on

the magnetic ﬂux density is B ¼ l0I=ð2prÞ, and v  B is directed from A to B and
its magnitude is l0Iv=(2pr). Hence, the contribution from this side to the electro-

Next, the magnetic ﬂux density at point P at distance s from B is

Induction Law

Here we discuss a phenomenon that is usually explained using only the motional
law. Suppose that a conducting circular plate of radius a is rotated with angular
frequency x around its axis in uniform magnetic ﬂux density B, as shown in
Fig. 10.7a. We determine the electromotive force induced between the center O of
the plate and point P on the edge. Since the magnetic ﬂux penetrating the closed
loop composed of the straight line connecting O and P and the line C outside the
plate does not change with time, it seems that no electromotive force is induced in
it. However, an electromotive force is induced in reality. This is called unipolar
induction.
According to the motional law, since the magnetic ﬂux crosses line OP, the
electromotive force is induced there. In the arrangement in Fig. 10.7a, the induced
electric ﬁeld is directed from O to P. At a point at distance R from the central axis,
the velocity of rotation, v, is equal to Rx. Hence, the induced electric ﬁeld is
E=RxB. Integrating this from O to P, the electromotive force is
Vem ¼

RxB dR ¼ 1

ð10:18Þ
The unipolar induction is really known. However, since the electromotive force
is not stable, it is not practically used. If the circular plate is magnetized, the same
thing occurs even if no magnetic ﬁeld is applied. In addition, when a hollow
dielectric plate is rotated in a magnetic ﬂux density, an electric polarization occurs
because of the electromotive force.
The same unipolar induction can be observed even for the system shown in
Fig. 10.7b, in which bar OP rotates. In this case, the magnetic ﬂux penetrating the
circuit changes with time, and the result can also be explained with the magnetic
ﬂux law. To explain the result for the system in Fig. 10.7a with the magnetic ﬂux
law, we can suppose that part of the circuit rotates with the plate as the bar in
Fig. 10.7 Unipolar induction: a usual system and b new system

Electromagnetic Induction

Fig. 10.7b. Another part of the circuit on the edge of the plate is equipotential.
Hence, it is difﬁcult to distinguish the two mechanisms.
In the above, we learned the magnetic ﬂux law and motional law to describe the
induced electromotive force for simple cases. If we discuss the case where a con-
ductor is forced to move in a magnetic ﬂux density varying with time, we have two
contributions to the electromotive force, and it is necessary to calculate each con-
tribution using the two laws. Here we propose a general law that combines the two
laws.
We assume that the external magnetic ﬁeld is increasing with time. In this case
the magnetic ﬂux density inside a material also increases because of the penetrating
magnetic ﬂux. Thus, we can deﬁne the velocity of the magnetic ﬂux lines and
denote it as V. If the coil in Fig. 10.3 stays stationary, but the magnetic ﬂux lines
move with velocity V ¼ v, the same amount of magnetic ﬂux penetrates into the
coil through a segment ds within period Dt. Hence, repeating a similar argument
up to Eq. (10.10), the time variation in magnetic ﬂux U that penetrates the coil is
given by
dU

ðB  VÞ  ds:
ð10:19Þ
Thus, we obtain the local relationship,

ð10:20Þ
This is called the continuity equation of magnetic ﬂux and is frequently used
for analyzing electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors. Comparing this
equation with Eq. (10.7), we have
E ¼ B  V:
ð10:21Þ
This is called Josephson’s relation. It should be noted that this relation
expresses the magnetic ﬂux law. Using the above two velocities, the relative
velocity of magnetic ﬂux lines from coil C is
V0 ¼ V  v;
ð10:22Þ
and combining the above equation with Eq. (10.11) gives the general law for the
induced electric ﬁeld,
E ¼ B  V0:

Example 10.4. Suppose that we increase by DB the magnetic ﬂux density B0
applied parallel to a long cylindrical conductor of radius a during short period, Dt.
Determine with Eq. (10.21) the electromotive force measured with potential leads
with the different arrangements shown in Fig. 10.8a, b.
Solution 10.4. We denote the velocity of the magnetic ﬂux as
V ¼ iRV:

can easily show that the induced electric ﬁeld integrated along the circumference in
this direction, 2paE, is equal to the total electromotive force, DU=Dt ¼ pa2DB=Dt.
Here we consider the case shown in Fig. 10.8a. The azimuthal angle between

where we set a reference point on terminal 1.
Second, we determine the electromotive force for the arrangement shown in
Fig. 10.8b. We assume an integral path of the induced electric ﬁeld on the right
conductor surface. In this case, we can neglect the magnetic ﬂux penetrating the
closed loop composed of this path and the potential leads and similarly determine
the electromotive force only by integrating Eq. (10.21) along the path. Thus, we
have

for the same reference point.
On the other hand, it is possible to choose the left conductor surface for the
integral path. The integral gives a2hðDB=DtÞ=2. In this case, the electromotive force
due to the magnetic ﬂux penetrating the integral path should be taken into account.
This additional component is pa2ðDB=DtÞ, and we obtain the same result by
adding it.
Thus, there is a freedom in choosing the integral path. For example, it is also
possible to choose the path shown by the dotted line in Fig. 10.8b. In this case, the
induced electric ﬁeld is perpendicular to the path, resulting in a zero line integral.
From the magnetic ﬂux penetrating the area surrounded by the path and the
potential leads (denoted by the azimuthal angle 2p−h), we directly obtain the same
result.

As described in Sect. 10.1, the electric ﬁeld E contains not only the electrostatic
ﬁeld but also the induced electric ﬁeld. Hence, such a general electric ﬁeld cannot

This satisﬁes Eq. (10.7) and reduces to Eq. (1.24) in the static condition. The
vector potential satisﬁes Eq. (9.21) under the Coulomb gauge even in this case.
To discuss the general electromagnetic ﬁelds, it is necessary to extend Ampere’s
law, Eq. (9.12), for the static magnetic ﬁeld produced by a steady current to a
general law including the magnetic ﬁeld by a non-steady current. This will be
covered in Chap. 11 in which we complete the set of Maxwell’s equations.
10.3
Boundary Conditions
Here we investigate whether the boundary condition for the electric ﬁeld E changes
in going from Eqs. (1.28) to (10.7).
We denote the electric ﬁelds in materials 1 and 2 near the boundary as E1 and
E2, respectively. Consider a plane normal to the boundary that includes vectors E1
and E2 (see Fig. 4.15a, b). Integrating the electric ﬁeld around a small rectangle,
DC, with two sides parallel to the boundary, with Eq. (10.7) and Stokes’ theorem,
we have

ð10:26Þ
where DS is the surface surrounded by DC, and we have changed the order of the
spatial integration and time differentiation. When the height of the small rectangle,
Dh, is sufﬁciently small, the amount of magnetic ﬂux that penetrates DS is negli-
gible. Thus, the circular integral of the electric ﬁeld reduces to zero similarly to the
case in Sect. 4.3, and we obtain the same result as Eq. (4.22),
n  ðE1  E2Þ ¼ 0:
ð10:27Þ
That is, the parallel component of the electric ﬁeld is continuous across the
boundary even when electromagnetic induction occurs.

10.4
Magnetic Energy
We already learned the magnetic energy in Sect. 8.3. In the system shown in
Fig. 8.14, the magnetic ﬂux that links the circuit made of a superconductor does not
change even when the plate moves. This means that there is no electromagnetic
induction. This is why the magnetic energy can be determined from the mechanical
work needed against the magnetic force for this system. Most textbooks on elec-
tromagnetism explain magnetic energy after electromagnetic induction. Hence, this
textbook gives the same explanation. An explanation from a different viewpoint is
helpful for a deep understanding of the phenomenon. Since there is no new phe-
nomenon in this section, however, readers who do not feel a need for this expla-
nation can skip it.
Suppose a coil of self-inductance L. When we apply current I′ to this coil, the
magnetic ﬂux penetrating this coil is
U0 ¼ LI0:
ð10:28Þ
When the current is increased by a small amount dI′ in short period dt, the
induced electromotive force is
Vem ¼ L dI0
dt :
ð10:29Þ
This acts to restrict the increase in the current. This phenomenon is called
self-induction. Thus, the electric power source must work against this electromo-
tive force to increase the current, and the electric power in this period is
P ¼ VemI0 ¼ LI0 dI0
dt :
ð10:30Þ
The energy stored in the coil when we apply the current I to the coil is equal to
the energy supplied by the electric power source until the current increases from 0
to I and is given by
Um ¼ W ¼

LI0 dI0

ð10:31Þ
Using the magnetic ﬂux U ¼ LI, this is also written as
Um ¼ 1
2 LI2 ¼ 1
2 UI ¼ 1
2L U2:
ð10:32Þ
This result agrees with Eq. (8.34), and we can understand that this energy is
exactly the magnetic energy.

Following a similar discussion, we can show that the magnetic energy of a
system composed of n coils is given by Eq. (8.35). In this case, the electromotive
force in the ith coil induced by current Ij ﬂowing in the jth coil is given by
Vemi ¼ Lij

ð10:33Þ
using the mutual inductance. This is called mutual induction.
Example 10.5. Prove Eq. (8.35) for a system composed of two coils and prove the
reciprocity, L12 ¼ L21.
Solution 10.5. Currents I1 and I2 ﬂow in coils 1 and 2, and the resultant pene-
trating magnetic ﬂuxes in these coils are U1 and U2, respectively. Assume that this
ﬁnal situation is reached after we apply the currents to coil 1 and then to coil 2. We
suppose an intermediate situation where coil 2 has no current and coil 1 has current
I1′ (see Fig. 10.9a). With the inductance coefﬁcient the magnetic ﬂux that penetrates
coil 1 is L11I0
1. Hence, the work done to apply current I 1 to coil 1 is
W1 ¼

Next, we consider the situation where coils 1 and 2 have currents I1 and I2′,
respectively (see Fig. 10.9b). The magnetic ﬂux penetrating coil 2 is L21I1 þ L22I0
2.
Hence, the work done to apply current I2 to coil 2 is

ð10:34Þ
If we apply the currents in reversed order, the magnetic energy is
Um ¼ 1
2 L11I2
1 þ L12I1I2 þ 1
2 L22I2
2:
ð10:35Þ
Since Eqs. (10.34) and (10.35) must be the same, we can prove the reciprocity,
Eq. (8.5),
L12 ¼ L21:
Thus, if we write L21 ¼ ðL12 þ L21Þ=2 in Eq. (10.34), the magnetic energy is
Um ¼ 1
2 I1ðL11I1 þ L12I2Þ þ 1
2 I2ðL21I1 þ L22I2Þ ¼ 1

Thus, Eq. (8.35) holds for n=2.

Eqs. (10.40)(10.42) are summarized as

We can solve this equation with Eq. (10.39).

Solution 10.6. We can assume that ∂=∂y and ∂=∂z are zero as in Eq. (10.44) and

Suppose that the plate in Fig. 10.7a is rotating with angular frequency x in
magnetic ﬂux density, B, that increases with time as B ¼ B0 þ ct. For sim-
plicity, we assume that the potential leads are arranged as in Fig. 10.12 to
eliminate the magnetic ﬂux that interlinks the circuit outside the plate. That is,
one potential lead is aligned on the plate edge between P and A′ and twisted
with another one up to a voltmeter. Now, we determine the induced elec-
tromotive force in the direction of OPA′ AO. In this case, the electromotive
force appears on line OP from the motional law and appears also from the
magnetic ﬂux law because of the penetrating magnetic ﬂux. We now use

Chapter 11
Displacement Current and Maxwell’s
Equations
Abstract This chapter covers the phenomena associated with the displacement
current, which makes Ampere’s law applicable to the case in which the current
changes with time. The displacement current is proved experimentally in various
cases. The set of Maxwell’s equations is completed by introducing the displacement
current. The breaking of symmetry of Maxwell’s equations is discussed, based on
the difference between a scalar source (electric charge) and vector source (current),
which give the irrotational electric ﬁeld and the solenoidal magnetic ﬂux density,
respectively. The electromagnetic ﬁelds are determined by the electric potential and
the vector potential, and the set of these potentials is called the electromagnetic
potential. We introduce the Poynting vector that describes the ﬂow of electro-
magnetic energy.
11.1
Displacement Current
In a steady state, Ampere’s law, Eq. (9.14), holds for a closed line, C, with different
surfaces on it, S1 and S2, as shown in Fig. 11.1a, b. If the magnetic ﬁeld H is
integrated on C in opposite directions as drawn in Fig. 11.1a, b, the sum of the two
integrations is naturally zero. At the same time, the sum of the surface integrals of
the current density i on S1 and S2 is also zero. This sum becomes the surface
integral on closed surface S12 composed of S1 and S2 (see Fig. 11.1c). Thus, we
have

This agrees with Eq. (5.8) in a steady state. However, it means that Ampere’s
law contradicts Eq. (5.8) in a non-steady state. In such a general case, the law of
conservation of electric charge, Eq. (5.8), must be satisﬁed. Substituting Eq. (4.14)
into this equation, we have

instead of Ampere’s law. In the above, S is the surface surrounded by C. The
second term on the right side, @D=@t, is called displacement current and has the
same unit as electric current density [A/m2]. In a steady state, Eq. (11.3) reduces to
the usual form of Ampere’s law, Eq. (9.14), and there is no problem.
Equation (11.3) is called the generalized form of Ampere’s law. The corre-
sponding generalized differential form of Ampere’s law is

ð11:4Þ
Here, we show the validity of the displacement current. Suppose that a capacitor
is energized using an electric power source. When we apply current I to the ca-
pacitor, as shown in Fig. 11.2a, the electric charge Q in the electrode changes. We

assume a closed line, C, around a wire through which the current ﬂows and a
surface, S1, as in the ﬁgure. We apply Eq. (11.3) to C and S1. The displacement
current is zero on S1, and the right side is equal to the current I applied to the
capacitor. Next, we assume another surface S2 that does not contain the wire, as
shown in Fig. 11.2b. In this case, while the left side does not change, i is zero on S2,
and the right side is

In the above, we changed the order of the time differential and surface integral,
since S2 does not change with time. Hence,
I ¼ dQ
dt
ð11:6Þ
and no contradiction results from Eq. (11.4).
When current changes with time as in the case of alternating current (AC),
electric charges are stored in the electrodes of a capacitor, and hence, current ﬂows
through the capacitor. Thus, the time variation in the electric ﬂux in the space
between the electrodes generates a magnetic ﬁeld as well as current.
Example 11.1. We apply AC I(t) = I0sinxt to a capacitor with circular electro-
plates of radius a separated by d, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Determine the displace-
ment current and magnetic ﬁeld in the space between the electroplates.

This is similar to a virtual situation in which the current of the same density

The magnetic ﬁeld produced by the displacement current is concentric around
the central axis of the capacitor. If the magnetic ﬁeld on a circle of radius R from the

Maxwell’s Equations
All of the equations that describe electromagnetic phenomena have been intro-
duced. They are summarized as follows:
r  E ¼  @B
@t ;
ð11:7Þ
r  H ¼ i þ @D
@t ;
ð11:8Þ
r  D ¼ q;
ð11:9Þ
r  B ¼ 0:
ð11:10Þ
These are Maxwell’s equations. Equation (11.7) describes the law of electro-
magnetic induction, which directly connects the ﬁrst fundamental variables in
electricity and magnetism. Equation (11.8) is the generalized differential form of
Ampere’s law that directly connects the second fundamental variables in electricity
and magnetism. Equations (11.9) and (11.10) are Gauss’ laws on electric ﬂux and
magnetic ﬂux, respectively, and represent the conditions of divergence.
When we look back at Eqs. (11.7)–(11.10), a break of formal symmetry may be
found among them. However, if there are no sources (q=0, i=0), a beautiful sym-
metry appears. This is the essential feature of electromagnetism. The break of
symmetry comes from the difference in the nature of ﬁelds produced by different
sources, electric charge density q (scalar) and current density i (vector). The electric
ﬁeld is an irrotational ﬁeld with divergence, and the magnetic ﬂux density is a
solenoidal ﬁeld with rotation. It should be noted that such a difference comes the
from more fundamental nature of mathematics, i.e., the difference between the
source being a scalar or vector.
The ﬁeld (i.e., a distortion vector in space) that a potential due to a scalar source
can produce is only a gradient. This ﬁeld naturally has no rotation and has diver-
gence. In contrast, the ﬁeld that a potential due to a vector source can produce is
only a rotation, which naturally has no divergence. Poisson’s equation and its
solution clearly show that a scalar or vector source produces a scalar or vector
potential, respectively. Therefore, including the effects of these sources in the above
equations automatically determines the corresponding equations to be modiﬁed.
The electric charge density q is included in Eq. (11.9), which represents diver-
gence, and the current density i is included in Eq. (11.8), which represents rotation.
As a result, the effects are not included in Eqs. (11.7) and (11.10) for E and B.
These equations are solved for electromagnetic ﬁelds with material relationships:

Displacement Current and Maxwell’s Equations

It is common to solve Eq. (11.20) under the condition of Eq. (11.19). When
there is no electric charge (q=0) in a material, according to Eq. (A1.46), the left side
of Eq. (11.20) is equal to DE , and we have
DE  l @2E
@t2  lrc
@E
@t ¼ 0:
ð11:21Þ
The same equations are obtained for the other four variables including B. This
equation is the telegraphic equation.
The second and third terms on the left side of Eq. (11.21) correspond to the
second (displacement current) and ﬁrst terms (electric current) on the right side of
Eq. (11.18), respectively. Hence, in usual cases where we can neglect the dis-
placement current, the second term in the telegraphic equation disappears, and the
equation leads to the diffusion equation, Eq. (10.50). Here, we discuss the condition
in which this approximation holds. Assume AC electromagnetic ﬁelds of angular
frequency x. The magnitudes of the second and third terms are lex2|E| and lrcx|
E|, respectively. The ratio of the second and third terms is
x
rc
:
ð11:22Þ
This ratio is also directly derived from the displacement current and electric
current. In usual metals, e and rc are of the order of e0’1 10−11 C2/Nm2 and
1107 S/m, respectively. Hence, this ratio is as small as 610−8 even for a
microwave of 10 GHz (x=2p 1010). In usual metals, we can therefore safely
neglect the displacement current even at a very high frequency. In contrast, for
insulating
materials
such
as
mica,
typical
material
constants
are
 ’ 70 ’ 6  1011 C2/Nm2 and rc ’ 1  1014 S/m. Hence, the ratio takes a
value as large as 2  106 even for a low frequency like a commercial one of 50 Hz.
In this case, we can neglect the current. It is easily understood that a large difference
in the electric conductivity dramatically affects the electromagnetic phenomena. In
the latter case, Eq. (11.21) reduces to
DE  l @2E
@t2 ¼ 0:
ð11:23Þ
This differential equation of the second order is called the wave equation. This
will be investigated in Chap. 12, in which we learn the electromagnetic wave.

telegraphic equation.

Boundary Conditions
Since the equation for the magnetic ﬁeld H changes from Eqs. (9.12) to (11.4), we
investigate the boundary condition for H here.
We denote the magnetic ﬁelds in materials 1 and 2 in the vicinity of an interface
by H1 and H2, respectively. Consider a plane that is normal to the boundary and
contains H1 and H2 (see Fig. 9.12a, b). Integrating the magnetic ﬁeld on the small
rectangle DC with two sides parallel to the boundary, we have

where we have used Stokes’ theorem and Eq. (11.4), and DS is the surface sur-
rounded by DC. If the height Dh is sufﬁciently small, only the surface current
contributes to the ﬁrst term on the right side, and we can neglect the displacement
current of a ﬁnite density. Hence, the boundary condition to be satisﬁed is the same
as Eq. (9.24); i.e., if the surface density of current ﬂowing on the boundary is s,
Eq. (11.24) gives
n  H1  H2
ð
Þ ¼ s;
ð11:25Þ
where n is the unit vector normal to the boundary and is directed from material 1 to
material 2. The difference in the parallel component of the magnetic ﬁeld is equal to
the surface density of current ﬂowing on the boundary.

Electromagnetic Potential
Here, we summarize the potentials that describe the electromagnetic ﬁelds. The
electric ﬁeld is given by Eq. (10.25) with the electric potential (scalar potential) /
and the vector potential A:
E ¼ r/  @A
@t :
ð11:26Þ
On the other hand, the magnetic ﬂux density B always satisﬁes Eq. (11.10) and
is given by Eq. (6.29) with the vector potential A:
B ¼ r  A:
ð11:27Þ
Thus, the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬂux density are given by / and A, and the
set of these potentials are called the electromagnetic potential.
There is no change in the magnetic ﬂux density, even if we add a gradient of an
arbitrary scalar function w to the vector potential A. However, it is necessary to
make the change
/ ! /  @w
@t ;
A ! A þ rw;
ð11:28Þ
so that the electric ﬁeld does not change. This transformation is the gauge trans-
formation. Since the electromagnetic ﬁelds do not change under this transforma-
tion, the electromagnetic potential is arbitrary. Hence, it is necessary to impose a
condition to determine the electromagnetic potential uniquely.
When an electric charge of density q and a current of density i coexist in space, it
is common to use the condition
l @/
@t þ r  A ¼ 0:
ð11:29Þ
This condition is the Lorentz gauge. The equations associated with the electric
charge and current are Eqs. (11.8) and (11.9), respectively. The left side of
Eq. (11.9) is written with the electromagnetic potential as

expresses the electromagnetic wave as will be shown in Chap. 12.
Example 11.3. Derive Eq. (11.32).

ð11:38Þ
The vector SP is called the Poynting vector. This equation says that the variation
in the energy in space V with time is equal to the Poynting vector that enters V
through the surface S. Hence, we understand that the Poynting vector represents the
ﬂow of electromagnetic energy, and Eq. (11.38) represents the law of conservation
of energy. When this equation is written in differential form, we have
@u

ð11:39Þ
This gives the continuity equation of energy.
However, there is an extraordinary case where it is difﬁcult to understand that the
Poynting vector gives a real energy ﬂow. See Column (2) in this chapter.

which agrees with the above result. The reason for the same result is that the
conditions of electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬂux density are the same before and after
one period, and hence, the electric and magnetic energies are unchanged. All the
energy that ﬂows into the conductor in one period is consumed and converted to
Joule heat.

Example 11.6. We apply current I to a wide parallel-plate transmission line using
an electric power source of output voltage V, as shown in Fig. 11.5a. Determine the
Poynting vector, and discuss the ﬂow of energy. Neglect the electric resistance of
the conductor. The width of a plate is w, and the plate separation is d. When we
cannot neglect the electric resistance, how does the energy ﬂow?
Solution 11.6. First, we consider the case where the electric resistance can be
neglected. We determine the Poynting vector on a surface, S, at some distance from
the electric power source (see Fig. 11.5b). The electric ﬁeld of strength E ¼ V=d is
directed downward, and the magnetic ﬁeld of strength H ¼ I=w is directed back-
ward. Hence, the magnitude of the Poynting vector is SP ¼ VI=ðwdÞ, and the vector
is directed from the electric power source to the terminal of the transmission line.
Hence, the energy that ﬂows from the electric power source to the transmission line
in unit time is
Fig. 11.5 a Parallel-plate transmission line and b the Poynting vector in the transmission line
330
11
Displacement Current and Maxwell’s Equations

SPwd ¼ VI
and is equal to the electric power as well known. This value is constant and
independent of the position of surface S.
Second, we consider the case where the electric resistance cannot be neglected. We
use R0
r and V′ to denote the electric resistance of the conducting plate in a unit length
and the potential difference between the conductors on surface S, respectively. The
potential difference on surface S′ at distance L from S is then V′ −2LR r′I. The electric
power that enters through surface S is V′I, and the electric power that exits through S′ is
V0  2LRrI
ð
ÞI ¼ V0I  2LR0
rI2 . Hence, the difference, 2LRr′I 2, is the power con-
sumed as the Joule heat in the region between S and S′. Here, we did not discuss the
detailed energy ﬂow into the conductor. See Exercise 11.10 for this discussion.

Example 11.7. We assume that current I is applied to the material shown in
Fig. 5.8 in Example 5.2 and that the voltage between the top and bottom is V. Prove
that the dissipated power is given by P ¼ IV using the Poynting vector.
Solution 11.7 We deﬁne the n-axis on the side of the truncated cone that connects
the points on the top and bottom of the same azimuthal angle, as shown in
Fig. 11.6. The radius of the cone at distance n from the bottom is denoted by R n

The magnetic ﬁeld at this position is

The ﬁrst term of the displacement current is independent of the movement
of charges and is not a current in the usual sense. The displacement current
discussed in Fig. 11.2 and that in the vacuum region of the capacitor in
Example 11.1 are examples of this component.
When a capacitor is occupied by a dielectric material, the polarization
current given by the second term also ﬂows. For a dielectric material with a
larger dielectric constant, most of the displacement current is polarization
current.
Column: (2) The Poynting Vector and Flow of Energy
We open the end terminal of the parallel-plate transmission line in Fig. 11.5b
and apply voltage V and uniform magnetic ﬂux density B0 directed normally
into the sheet. In this case, the electric ﬁeld applied between the two plate
conductors is E ¼ V=d , and a Poynting vector of magnitude SP ¼ VB0=l0d
is directed from the electric power source to the terminal. Does this mean
there is a steady energy ﬂow from the electric power source even in this static
condition?
It is difﬁcult to consider that the energy ﬂows continuously, since there is
no electric power from the source. How should we understand Eq. (11.39),
which is considered to represent the energy ﬂow? If we substitute
SP ¼ SP0 þ r  K:
into Eq. (11.39), we have
@u
@t þ r  SP0 ¼ 0:
If SP0 represents the real energy ﬂow, the Poynting vector differs by a curl
of an aribitrary vector function from the real energy ﬂow [1]. Thus, the
Poynting vector does not necessarily give the energy ﬂow, and there is always
arbitrariness in determining the energy ﬂow. The above case is one example.

wave equation is composed of waves propagating forward and backward with light
speed. It is shown that the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬂux density are per-
pendicular to each other and are perpendicular to the propagation direction. We
discuss the refraction and reﬂection of a plane electromagnetic wave on an interface
between two substances with different material constants using the boundary
conditions. The Poynting vector of the electromagnetic wave has a magnitude equal
to the electromagnetic energy density multiplied by the light speed and points in the
propagation direction. The propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a wave guide
is also discussed, and we learn about stable standing modes in the wave guide.
12.1
Planar Electromagnetic Wave
Electromagnetic ﬁelds in a dielectric material follow the wave equation, Eq. (11.23),
since there is no electric charge in the material. This chapter covers the property of
electromagnetic ﬁelds described by this equation. For simplicity, we focus only on
the electric ﬁeld and assume that it has only a y-component varying only along the x-
axis. Thus, Eq. (11.23) reduces to

We assume that Ey varies with time as eixt with x denoting the angular fre-
quency. Equation (12.1) then leads to

This equation is easily solved as

The practical electric ﬁeld is given by the real part of the complex solution.
In the ﬁrst term of Eq. (12.3),

ð12:8Þ
shows that the ﬁrst term in Eq. (12.3) represents a wave that propagates with the
velocity c along the negative x-axis. Namely this wave is an electromagnetic wave.
Similarly, the second term in Eq. (12.3) gives the electromagnetic wave propa-
gating along the positive x-axis. Such an electromagnetic wave, whose same phase
is on a plane as in Eq. (12.3), is generally called a plane wave.
Since the left side of Eq. (11.7) is given by iz@Ey=@x; the magnetic ﬂux density
has only a z-component. Assuming the same time-dependent factor, the magnetic
ﬂux density is given by
Bz ¼ B1eiðxt þ kxÞ þ B2eiðxtkxÞ

Electromagnetic Wave

The ﬁrst and second terms in this equation correspond to the ﬁrst and second
terms in Eq. (12.3) and represent electromagnetic waves propagating along the
negative and positive x-axis, respectively. Thus, the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬂux
density coexist in electromagnetic waves. That is, the time variation in a magnetic
ﬂux density induces an electric ﬁeld, and the time variation in the produced electric
ﬁeld induces again a magnetic ﬂux density; the process is repeated, and the vari-
ation propagates as a wave. Since current does not ﬂow, there is no energy dissi-
pation, and the electromagnetic wave does not decay with time.
We can also easily show that, if the electric ﬁeld has only a z-component, the
magnetic ﬂux density has only a y-component, similarly to the above case. Hence,
the planar electromagnetic wave is a transverse wave in which the electric ﬁeld
and magnetic ﬂux density are perpendicular to each other and directed perpen-
dicularly to the propagation direction. The ratio of these amplitudes is

The magnetic ﬁeld has been commonly used instead of the magnetic ﬂux density
to describe electromagnetic waves. In this case, the following equation is used:

medium, and its unit is X

The planar electromagnetic wave is generally expressed in the form
exp½iðxt  k  rÞ:
ð12:13Þ
Using the unit vector along the propagation direction (the wave number vector
ik ¼ k=jkj), the relationship between the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld is
expressed as
E ¼ ZðH  ikÞ;
H ¼ Z1ðik  EÞ:
ð12:14Þ
In other words, the propagation direction of electromagnetic waves coincides
with that of the Poynting vector representing the direction of the energy ﬂow. For
example, the ﬁrst terms in Eqs. (12.3) and (12.11) correspond to each other, and
since the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld are directed along the positive y- and
negative z-axes, respectively, and the Poynting vector is directed along the negative

similar relation holds.

The electromagnetic wave is generally classiﬁed depending on its wavelength.
Table 12.1 shows the classiﬁcations, although the classiﬁcation ranges somewhat
overlap.
Example 12.1. Prove that there are no components of the electric ﬁeld or magnetic
ﬂux density parallel to the propagation direction of a planar electromagnetic wave.
Solution 12.1. Assume a planar electromagnetic wave propagating along the
positive x-axis. The functional form of variations with respect to time and space for
the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬂux density is ei(xt−kx). Hence, from Eq. (11.7), the
x-component of the magnetic ﬂux density is

Thus, we prove that there are no components along the propagation direction for
the electric ﬁeld or magnetic ﬂux density.
}
Equations (12.3) and (12.9) deal with the case where each of the electric ﬁeld
and magnetic ﬂux density remains in its own direction perpendicular to the other.
Such a direction is called the direction of polarization. A polarization whose
direction is ﬁxed is referred to as linear polarization. In general, a superposition of
components is possible, such as
Ey ¼ E1 cosðxt  kxÞ;
Ez ¼ E2 cosðxt  kx þ dÞ:
ð12:17Þ
The corresponding components of the magnetic ﬂux density are

Bz ¼ E1

ð12:18Þ
Usually, the direction of polarization is designated as that of the electric ﬁeld, E.
Eliminating t in the above equations, we obtain the relationship between Ey and Ez as

ð12:19Þ
In the range 0<d<p, the direction of polarization turns to the right (clockwise)
from the view of an observer directed along the propagation of the electromagnetic
wave. This is called right-hand polarization (see Fig. 12.1). In the range −p<d<0,
the direction of polarization turns to the left (counterclockwise). When d=0 or p, the
electric ﬁeld E is ﬁxed in one direction and is linearly polarized. When d ¼ p=2
and E1 ¼ E2, the trace of E is a circle, and this polarization is circular polariza-
tion. In other cases, the trace is an ellipse, and the polarization is elliptical
polarization. Such phenomena that the directions of E and B in the electromagnetic
wave are not uniform but biased are referred to as the polarization of a wave, and
such a wave is called a polarized wave.
12.2
Reﬂection and Refraction of the Planar
Electromagnetic Wave
Electromagnetic wave is a family of waves that includes visible light. Reﬂection
and refraction are well-known processes for light in optics. Here, we investigate
reﬂection and refraction using electromagnetism.
Media 1 and 2 with dielectric constants e1 and e2 and magnetic permeabilities l1
and l2 face each other on the plane z=0, as shown in Fig. 12.2a. Suppose that a
planar electromagnetic wave propagates from medium 1 to the boundary. The plane
12.1
Planar Electromagnetic Wave
343

formed by the propagation direction and the direction (z-axis) normal to the
boundary is called a plane of incidence. We deﬁne the x-axis on the line on which
the plane of incidence and the boundary meet and the y-axis on the boundary in
such a way that it is normal to both the x- and z-axes.
In this case, the incident wave and reﬂected wave remain in medium 1, and the
transmitted wave remains in medium 2. We use k, k00, and k0 to denote the wave
a

number vectors of the incident, reﬂected, and transmitted waves, respectively. Each
wave propagates along the wave number vector. These vectors lie on the plane of
incidence, the x–z plane. We denote the angles of the incident, reﬂected, and
transmitted waves from the z-axis by h, h″, and h′, respectively (see Fig. 12.2b).
The factor that represents the variation with time is commonly given by eixt. The
incident, reﬂected, and transmitted waves are then expressed as
exp½iðxt  k  rÞ;
exp½iðxt  k00  rÞ;
exp½iðxt  k0  rÞ;
with r representing the position vector.
The electric ﬁeld E and magnetic ﬂux density B are perpendicular to each other
and lie on the plane normal to the propagation direction, as shown in the last
section. For example, E and B for the incident wave are normal to k. Here we
consider the boundary conditions for E and B: Eqs. (4.19), (10.27), (9.22), and
(11.25). When there is neither electric charge nor current on the boundary, the
parallel components of the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld are continuous, and the
normal components of the electric ﬂux density and magnetic ﬂux density are
continuous across the boundary. That is,
n  ðE1  E2Þ ¼ 0;

n  ðB1  B2Þ ¼ 0;
ð12:23Þ
with n denoting the vector normal to the boundary. In the above, the subscripts 1
and 2 represent the variables in media 1 and 2, respectively.
Considering the orthogonality between E and B, the incident wave is given by
E ¼ E0 exp½iðxt  k  rÞ;

ð12:24bÞ
where k ¼ jkj and c1 is the light speed in medium 1. The magnetic ﬂux density B is
normal to both E and k, and its magnitude is equal to the magnitude of E divided by
the corresponding light speed. The reﬂected wave is similarly given by
E00 ¼ E00

ð12:26bÞ
In the above, k00 ¼ jk00j, k0 ¼ jk0j, and c2 is the light speed in medium 2. Thus,
the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬂux density in medium 1 are
E1 ¼ E þ E00;
B1 ¼ B þ B00;
ð12:27Þ
and those in medium 2 are
E2 ¼ E0;
B2 ¼ B0:
ð12:28Þ
Since Eqs. (12.20)–(12.23) should be satisﬁed at the boundary (z=0) at any time,
the phase must be the same for the three waves. This condition is given by
k  rjz¼0 ¼ k00  rjz¼0 ¼ k0  rjz¼0:
ð12:29Þ
Equation (12.29) is expressed as

ð12:30Þ
in terms of an arbitrary position vector r0 on the boundary. If r0 is given by
r0 ¼ xix þ yiy;
ð12:31Þ
we have
k sin h ¼ k00 sin h00 ¼ k0 sin h0;
ð12:32Þ
since the wave number vectors are perpendicular to the y-axis. The speeds of the
incident and reﬂected waves in the same medium are the same, and the wave
numbers of these waves are also the same k=k″. Hence, we have
h ¼ h00:

That is, the incident and reﬂection angles are the same, and this is called the law

a space surrounded by a conductor like a rectangular wave guide. That is, TEM
wave cannot exist in simple rectangular or circular wave guides. Such a ﬁeld can
exist only when the guide is composed of two or more conductors like those in
Fig. 12.6, and a potential difference can appear between conductors with electric
ﬁeld lines extending from one conductor to another.
From the above discussion, we know that either the electric ﬁeld E or magnetic
ﬂux density B has at least one component in the propagation direction. The elec-
tromagnetic wave with a zero longitudinal component of the electric ﬁeld is called
the transverse electric (TE) wave and that with a zero longitudinal component of
the magnetic ﬂux density is called the transverse magnetic (TM) wave. The
general electromagnetic wave is given by a linear combination of these waves.
Here we consider a TM wave. In this case, Bz=0. Since any electromagnetic
wave of high frequency does not penetrate the conductor, the electric ﬁeld is
perpendicular to and the magnetic ﬂux density is parallel to the conductor surface.
That is,

Spherical Wave
Here we consider the case in which an electromagnetic wave propagates radially.
This wave is a spherical wave. We assume that the factor of time variation is given

Retarded Potential
When electric charge (of density q) or current (of density i) changes with time, an
electromagnetic wave is emitted into the surrounding space. At a distance far from
the source, the electromagnetic wave propagates as a spherical wave as treated in
Sect. 12.5. The electromagnetic potential describing such time-dependent electro-
magnetic ﬁelds is given by Eqs. (11.31) and (11.32). In the static limit, these reduce
to Eqs. (4.17) and (9.21), and the solutions are given by Eqs. (1.27) and (6.33)
when e0 and l0 are replaced with e and l.

The above results show that, since the speed of propagation of a variation in
the ﬁelds due to the change in the source is ﬁnite (light speed c), the change is
transmitted with a delay in time of R=c at distance R ¼ jr  r0j. For this reason, the
above potentials are called retarded potentials. When the variation with time is
slow, we can neglect this delay, resulting in the static potentials given by Eqs. (1.27)
and (6.33).
Column: To the Theory of Relativity
Newton’s equation of motion is unchanged between coordinate system K
with spatial coordinates (x, y, z) and time t and another coordinate system K
with the dimensions
x0 ¼ x  vt;
y0 ¼ y;
z0 ¼ z;
t0 ¼ t:
The coordinate systems K and K
 move with constant velocity relatively to
each other, and this transformation is called the Galilean transformation. That
is, Newton’s equation is unchanged under the Galilean transformation.
We assume that the equation for the electromagnetic potential [e.g.,
Eq. (11.31)] holds in coordinate system K:

The above results indicate that Maxwell’s equations hold correctly only in
one coordinate system. However, it was experimentally demonstrated that
Maxwell’s equations hold in all coordinate systems that move relatively to
each other with constant velocities. This means that the Galilean transfor-
mation is not a correct transformation connecting two coordinate systems.
The correct transformation is the Lorentz transformation, and, in this case, the
time is no longer independent of the velocity of the coordinate system.
In 1905, Einstein proposed the special theory of relativity based on the
principle of relativity that all coordinate systems are equivalent and the
principle of the constancy of light speed that the light speed observed in any
coordinate system is the same.

A1 Vector Analysis
A1.1 Scalars and Vectors
A quantity that is only speciﬁed by its magnitude is a scalar. Mass, energy, electric
charge, and temperature are examples of scalars. On the other hand, there is a kind
of quantity that needs to be speciﬁed not only by magnitude but also direction; such
a quantity is a vector. Force, velocity, and moment in dynamics and the electric
ﬁeld, magnetic ﬂux density, and current in electromagnetism are examples of
vectors.
A vector is commonly denoted by a bold character such as F or a character with
an arrow such as F!. A vector is speciﬁed in space by drawing a straight arrow, as
shown in Fig. A1.1. The length of the line represents the magnitude of the vector,
and the direction of the arrow represents the direction of the vector. The magnitude
of vector F is written as F
j j.
In many cases, the effect of vector is unchanged even when it is displaced in
parallel, i.e., moved without changing the direction in which it points, as shown in
Fig. A1.2. Such a vector is called a free vector. On the other hand, there is a kind of
vector that gives a different effect when displaced (like a force); such a vector is
called a bound vector. For example, when a force is given on the center of gravity
of an object, it causes a simple translation motion of the object. However, when a
force is given on a point other than the center of gravity, it causes both straight
motion of the center of gravity and a rotational motion around that center.

A1.2 Addition of Vectors
Suppose the sum of two free vectors A and B, as shown in Fig. A1.3. The sum
A þ B is obtained graphically by translating B so that its starting point reaches the
end point of A, as shown in Fig. A1.4a. In this case, the sum is obtained as a vector
that connects the starting point of A and the end point of B. The sum B þ A is
similarly obtained by translating A, and we can see it is equal to the sum A þ B (see
Fig. A1.4b). Thus, the relation holds generally:
A þ B ¼ B þ A:
ðA1:1Þ
This is called the exchange law. For a sum of three vectors, the following
relation holds
ðA þ BÞ þ C ¼ A þ ðB þ CÞ;
ðA1:2Þ
where the operation inside parentheses has priority. This is called the combination
law.

A1.3 Products of Vectors and Scalars
The product of a vector A and scalar a gives a vector of magnitude equal to a A
j j
with the same direction as A. For a<0, the direction is reversed. The following
relations hold for this kind of product:
mðnAÞ ¼ ðmnÞA;
ðA1:3Þ
ðm þ nÞA ¼ mA þ nA;
ðA1:4Þ
mðA þ BÞ ¼ mA þ mB:
ðA1:5Þ
Equation (A1.5) is called the distribution law.
A1.4 Analytic Expression of a Vector
We use Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) and denote unit vectors with a unit magnitude
along the x-, y-, and z-axes by ix, iy, and iz, respectively. If vector A is expressed as
A ¼ Axix þ Ayiy þ Aziz
ðA1:6Þ
(see Fig. A1.5), Ax, Ay, and Az are called the x-, y-, and z-components of A,
respectively. Using these components, A is also expressed as
ðAx; Ay; AzÞ:
ðA1:7Þ

Using these methods, we can prove the laws of exchange, combination, and
distribution.
A1.5 Products of Vectors
When the angle of vector B measured from vector A is h (p\h  p), ABcosh is
called a scalar product of A and B and is written as A  B. Hence, we have
A  B ¼ B  A ¼ AB cos h:
ðA1:11Þ
If A and B are perpendicular to each other h ¼ p=2
ð
Þ, A  B ¼ 0. When the
components of A and B are ðAx; Ay; AzÞ and ðBx; By; BzÞ, we have

ðA1:12Þ
The vector product of A and B is a vector of magnitude ABsinh that points
along the direction of a screw when we rotate it from A to B and is written as
A  B. Thus,
A  B ¼ B  A:
ðA1:13Þ
Vector A  B is normal to A and B, and when A and B point in the same or
opposite direction (h=0 or p), A  B ¼ 0. Using the components, the vector pro-
duct is expressed as

A1.6 Differentiation of Vectors
When vector A changes spatially, we express it as a function of coordinates such as
Aðx; y; zÞ. If position vector r corresponds to point (x, y, z), it is possible to write it
as AðrÞ. Suppose that only x changes by a small amount, Dx, with no change in
y and z. The corresponding change in A is
DA ¼ Aðx þ Dx; y; zÞ  Aðx; y; zÞ:
ðA1:20Þ
If the limit of DA=Dx exists in the limit Dx ! 0, this is called a partial dif-
ferential coefﬁcient and is written as
@A
@x :
ðA1:21Þ
If the components of A are ðAx; Ay; AzÞ, this coefﬁcient is
@A
@x ¼ @Ax
@x ix þ @Ay
@x iy þ @Az
@x iz:
ðA1:22Þ
The partial differential coefﬁcients with respect to y and z
@A
@y ;
@A
@z
ðA1:23Þ
are similarly deﬁned.
When (x, y, z) changes to ðx þ Dx; y þ Dy; z þ DzÞ or r changes to r þ Dr, the
variation in A is
DA ¼ Aðx þ Dx; y þ Dy; z þ DzÞ  Aðx; y; zÞ
’ @A
@x Dx þ @A
@y Dy þ @A
@z Dz:
ðA1:24Þ
In the limit of small Dx, Dy, and Dz, these are written as dx, dy, and dz, and then,
DA leads to

dA ¼ @A
@x dx þ @A
@y dy þ @A
@z dz:

This is called total differentiation. If A is a function not only of (x, y, z) but also
of time t, the total differentiation of A also includes ð@A=@tÞdt on the right side of
Eq. (A1.25).

When f (x, y, z) is a given scalar function, the following vector is called the
gradient of f:

@z iz:
ðA1:30Þ
This is written as grad f, and the operation, grad, is also called the gradient. The
function grad f is a vector that points in the direction of maximum variation with a
magnitude equal to the maximum variation. If we use the operator deﬁned by

Thus, the gradient is an operator that operates on a scalar to result in a vector. An
example is the relation between temperature and heat ﬂow. The temperature is a
scalar, and the heat ﬂows along the opposite direction of its gradient, i.e., from a
position with a higher temperature to a position with a lower one. When the
temperature and heat conductivity are T and K, the heat that ﬂows across a unit area
in unit time because of the temperature gradient is −K∇T.
A1.8 Divergence of a Vector
When Aðx; y; zÞ is a given vector function, the following scalar is called the di-
vergence of A:
@Ax
@x þ @Ay
@y þ @Az
@z :
ðA1:34Þ
This is written as divA, and the operation, div, is also called the divergence.
Using the vector operator ∇, this is also written as r  A. Namely,
divA ¼ r  A ¼ @Ax
@x þ @Ay
@y þ @Az
@z :
ðA1:35Þ
The mathematical deﬁnition of divergence will be given later in Eq. (A1.67).
Thus, the divergence is an operator that operates on a vector to result in a scalar.
For example, if the velocity of a ﬂuid is v, r  v is the volume of the ﬂuid that
comes out through a unit area in unit time.
A1.9 Curl of a Vector
When Aðx; y; zÞ is a given vector function, the following vector is called the curl or
rotation of A:
ix
@Az
@y  @Ay
@z


þ iy
@Ax
@z  @Az
@x


þ iz
@Ay
@x  @Ax
@y


:
ðA1:36Þ
This is written as curlA or rotA, and the operation, curl or rot, is also called curl
or rotation. Using the vector operator ∇, this is also written as r  A. We can also
use a determinant to express Eq. (A1.36) as
370
Appendix A

ðA1:37Þ
The mathematical deﬁnition of rotation will be given later in Eq. (A1.76).
Thus, the curl is an operator that operates on a vector to result in a vector. We
consider a rotation of a rigid body. When the rigid body rotates with an angular
velocity x around an axis through the center of gravity, as shown in Fig. A1.7, the
velocity of a point located at r is v ¼ x  r. Thus, we obtain x ¼ 1=2

A1.12 Curvilinear Integral of a Vector
We denote the tangential component of a vector Fðx; y; zÞ on a smooth curve, C, by
Ft(x, y, z) and the elementary line vector on C by ds (see Fig. A1.8). The following
integral is called a curvilinear integral:

ðA1:53Þ
Thus, we ﬁnd that the inverse operation of the gradient is the curvilinear integral.
It is obvious that the curvilinear integral of a gradient is determined only by the
starting point P and terminating point Q and is independent of the integral path. If
there are two integral paths C1 and C2 that connect P and Q, as shown in Fig. A1.9,
the following relation holds:

A1.13 Surface Integral of a Vector
We denote the normal component of vector Fðx; y; zÞ on a curved surface, S, by
Fn(x, y, z) and the elementary surface vector on S by dS (see Fig. A1.10). In this
case, the following integral is called a surface integral:

When F is the velocity of a ﬂuid and S is a cross section, the surface integral
given by Eq. (A1.56) is the amount of ﬂuid that ﬂows through the cross section in
unit time.

ðA1:57Þ
where dS is directed outward from this region. This integral is divided into six
surface integrals. First, we treat integrals on two surfaces parallel to the y–z plane at
x and x þ Dx (see Fig. A1.11). On the surface at x, dS ¼ ixdS, and the integral on
this surface is

since the surface integrals on a common surface between two adjacent regions
cancel each other because dS has an opposite direction in each integral (see

A1.15 Stokes’ Theorem
We consider a small rectangle in the region y to y þ Dy and z to z þ Dz on the y–
z plane. We integrate vector A along this small rectangle. The integral path is
directed counterclockwise, as shown in Fig. A1.13, so that a screw points in the
direction of the x-axis when we rotate a screwdriver along the direction of the
integral. On the path from P to Q, ds ¼ iydy, and the contribution from this region

integral on C is equal to the sum of the curvilinear integrals of all rectangular

A1.17 Cylindrical Coordinates
In Sect. A1.4, we used Cartesian coordinates. However, it is convenient to use
cylindrical coordinates when we calculate electromagnetic properties for long
cylindrical objects. When we use cylindrical coordinates, we ﬁrst deﬁne the central
axis (the z-axis). Then, we express the target position with the distance from this
axis (R), the azimuthal angle ðuÞ on the plane normal to the z-axis, and the position
on this axis (z): ðR; u; zÞ. When we use the common z-axis with Cartesian coor-
dinates, as shown in Fig. A1.15, the relationships between the two sets of coor-
dinates are
R ¼ ðx2 þ y2Þ1=2;
u ¼ tan1 y
x ;
z ¼ z:
ðA1:78Þ
If we use iR, iu, and iz to denote the unit vectors along the radial, azimuthal, and
z-axial directions, respectively, these are perpendicular to each other and follow the
right-hand rule in the order iR ! iu ! iz ! iR:

It is convenient to use polar coordinates when we calculate electromagnetic
properties for spherical objects. When we use polar coordinates, we ﬁrst deﬁne the
center with an axis that determines the two poles. Then, we express the target
position with the distance from the center (r), the zenithal angle (h) measured from
the north pole, and the azimuthal angle ðuÞ on the plane normal to the axis:
ðr; h; uÞ. When we use the common center and z-axis with Cartesian coordinates, as
shown in Fig. A1.16, the relationships between the two sets of coordinates are

tromagnetic phenomenon associated with the Meissner–Ochsenfeld effect in su-
perconductors.
We
denote
the
mass,
electric
charge,
and
velocity
of
a
superconducting electron by m, −e, and vs, respectively. The theory assumes the
equation of motion of the superconducting electron:
m dvs
dt ¼ eE:
The right side is the Coulomb force. The viscous force in Eq. (5.21) does not act
on superconducting electrons. The above equation requires a superconducting
current to ﬂow without decaying in a steady state where there is no electric ﬁeld. It
is known that the superconducting electron is a pair of two electrons, thus e=2e. If
we denote the density of superconducting electrons by ns, from Eq. (5.24), the
superconducting current density is
i ¼ ensvs:
Eliminating vs using this equation yields

we have

Hence, we ﬁnd that the quantity in the parentheses is a constant value. When it is

is a quantity with the dimension of length called the penetration depth of the
magnetic ﬁeld. Equations (A3.1) and (A3.2) are called the London equations.
Since r  B ¼ 0, using Eq. (A1.46) reduces Eq. (A3.2) to
ðA3:3Þ
Here, we show that Eq. (A3.3) describes the Meissner–Ochsenfeld effect.
Suppose a semi-inﬁnite superconductor that occupies the region x 	 0 with the
surface at x=0. We apply an external magnetic ﬁeld of magnetic ﬂux density B0
parallel to the z-axis. In this case, it is reasonable to assume that the internal
magnetic ﬂux density has only the z-component and is uniform in the y–z plane.
Thus, Eq. (A3.3) reduces to
d2B
dx2  1
k2 B ¼ 0:
From the boundary conditions that B(0)=B0 and B should be ﬁnite at inﬁnity
(x!∞), we have
BðxÞ ¼ B0 exp  x
k


:
This shows that the magnetic ﬂux penetrates from the surface to a depth of about
k (see Fig. A3.1). For this reason, k is called the penetration depth. Usually k takes
a value of the order of tens of nm and can be neglected in comparison with the
specimen size, and hence, the Meissner–Ochsenfeld effect can be explained. From
Eq. (6.27), a current of density

ﬂows along the y-axis. That is, the diamagnetism in the superconductor is caused by
the current ﬂowing on the surface, and this current is called the Meissner current.
If we regard this as a real surface current, the current that ﬂows within a unit width
along the z-axis is given by
s ¼

which satisﬁes Eq. (7.8).
As was just stated, the London equation is assumed to explain the Meissner–
Ochsenfeld effect. It is easy to show that Eqs. (A3.1) and (A3.2) are derived from
the following equation:
i ¼  nse2
m A:
ðA3:4Þ
Namely, we obtain Eq. (A3.1) by differentiating this equation with respect to
time using the fact that there is no electrostatic ﬁeld

Þ in the super-
conductor. The curl of Eq. (A3.4) directly derives Eq. (A3.2). Equation (A3.4) is
derived from the rigorous Ginzburg–Landau theory, and hence, we are justiﬁed in
assuming the London equations.
We can also derive the London equation, (A3.3), by minimizing a suitable
energy. This is given by

The ﬁrst term is the magnetic energy, and the second term is the kinetic energy

A3.2 Mixed State
There are two kinds of superconductors, i.e., type 1 and type 2 superconductors.
When there is no geometrical effect as in the case of a long slab superconductor in a
parallel magnetic ﬂux density, the magnetizations of these superconductors are like
those shown in Fig. A3.2a, b. Most superconducting elements are classiﬁed into
type 1 in (a). In this case, when the external magnetic ﬂux density B0 is small, the
superconductor is in the Meissner state, a perfect diamagnetic state. When B0
exceeds the critical value Bc, the superconductivity disappears with a jump in
magnetization to zero, and the superconductor enters in the normal state with an
electric resistivity. We call Bc the critical magnetic ﬂux density, or Bc=l0 ¼ Hc is
called the critical magnetic ﬁeld.
Alloy or compound superconductors, including practical superconductors, are
classiﬁed into type 2 shown in Fig. A3.2b. When B0 is below Bc1, the supercon-
ductor is in the Meissner state, but when B0 exceeds Bc1, the superconductor enters
an imperfectly diamagnetic state called the mixed state with a penetration of
magnetic ﬂux. When B0 exceeds Bc2, the superconductor enters the normal state
with zero magnetization. The quantities Bc1 and Bc2 are called the lower and upper
critical magnetic ﬂux density.
In the mixed state, the magnetic ﬂux is quantized as shown in Fig. A3.3, and
each has a magnetic quantum of
Fig. A3.2 Magnetization of a type 1 and b type 2 superconductors

where hP is Planck’s constant. The central part of each quantized magnetic ﬂux is in
the normal state, and the magnetic ﬂux is concentrated in the region about k from
the center. Hence, the circular current ﬂows stably around the center, and the
quantized magnetic ﬂux is also called a vortex.
The structure of each quantized magnetic ﬂux is much smaller than the size of a
superconductor specimen, and the internal magnetic ﬂux density can be regarded as
uniform, as schematically shown in Fig. A3.4. If this magnetic ﬂux density is B, the
magnetization of the superconductor is given by Eq. (7.38).
A3.3 Motion of Quantized Magnetic Flux
In operating conditions of superconducting equipment, the superconductors are
generally in the mixed state with penetration of quantized magnetic ﬂuxes. Thus,
the Lorentz force
392
Appendix A

F0 ¼ i  B
is exerted on quantized magnetic ﬂuxes in a unit volume under the transport current.
In this case, the current is not localized only near the surface but ﬂows uniformly
inside the superconductor. When quantized magnetic ﬂuxes are driven to move with
velocity V by the Lorentz force, the electric ﬁeld given by Eq. (10.21) is induced:
E ¼ B  V:
ðA3:6Þ
This is Josephson’s relation. Since the condition is steady without a change in
the magnetic ﬂux density with time, this induced electric ﬁeld satisﬁes Eq. (1.28).
The relationship between the current density and electric ﬁeld in the supercon-
ductor in the mixed state is similar to Ohm’s law for a usual metal, as shown by the
solid line in Fig. A3.5. That is, when the current density increases, the Lorentz force
increases, and the velocity of quantized magnetic ﬂux increases, resulting in an
increase in the electric ﬁeld. In such a resistive state, heat is generated because of
the energy dissipation. This occurs because the central part of each quantized
magnetic ﬂux is in the normal state. The induced electric ﬁeld drives normal
electrons, resulting in energy dissipation similar to that in a normal metal. Thus,
when the magnetic ﬂux density increases, the number density of quantized mag-
netic ﬂux also increases, and the electric resistance increases. When the magnetic
ﬂux density reaches Bc2, all the area in the superconductor reaches the normal state,
and the electric resistance reaches the normal value.
To transport a current without appearance of electric resistance, the motion of
quantized magnetic ﬂuxes needs to stop V ¼ 0
ð
Þ even under the Lorentz force. This
action is called ﬂux pinning, and defects such as normal precipitates or grain
boundaries are known to act effectively. These defects are called pinning centers.
Practical superconductors contain such pinning centers dispersed with a high
concentration. The condition of the force equilibrium on quantized magnetic ﬂuxes
is given by

between current density and
induced electric ﬁeld in su-
perconductor. The solid and
dashed lines show the char-
acteristics for the supercon-
ductor without and with

ðA3:7Þ
where Fp is the pinning force density. The corresponding relationship between the
current density and electric ﬁeld under the inﬂuence of ﬂux pinning is shown by the
dashed line in Fig. A3.5. The current density ic at which the electric ﬁeld starts to
appear is called the critical current density. In this condition, Eq. (A3.7) gives
ic ¼ Fp
B :
ðA3:8Þ
To transport a current of high density without appearance of electric resistance,
the strength of the pinning force needs to be enhanced.
A3.4 Electromagnetism and Superconductivity
Here, we carefully look at the fundamental factors that construct electromagnetism.
The independent principles are as follows:
(a) The Coulomb force (with Coulomb’s law),
(b) The Lorentz force (with the Biot–Savart law),
(c) The law of electromagnetic induction,
(d) The displacement current.
(a) gives Eq. (11.9), (b) gives Eq. (11.10) and a part of Eq. (11.8), (c) gives
Eq. (11.7), and (d) gives a part of Eq. (11.8). Thus, the above four principles are
arranged into Maxwell’s equations. From the comprehensive Maxwell theory based
on these equations, the Coulomb force and Lorentz force are derived in terms of the
Maxwell stress tensor. In fact, the Lorentz force is derived from a theoretical
investigation of the energy in Exercise 11.11.
However, it should be noted that these principles are not enough to describe
electromagnetic phenomena completely. That is, we need empirical Ohm’s law for
a system in which current ﬂows. This law is not derived theoretically. Hence,
electromagnetic theory is not complete in this sense.
Here, we discuss electromagnetic phenomena in superconductors. These phe-
nomena are independent of Ohm’s law, and the mechanism that determines the
current is obtained by minimizing the free energy. Hence, we can say that elec-
tromagnetic theory is complete for superconductors including the case where cur-
rent ﬂows. In addition, if we include the cases of pressurization or ﬁlms, more than
half of the elements become superconducting at low temperatures, and most
metallic compounds and some organic compounds are superconductors. That is,
superconductors are fairly common substances. This textbook shows that super-
conductor has its own place in the E-B analogy. In principle, it was even possible to
predict the existence of superconductors in the 19th Century.
394
Appendix A

Second, we discuss electromagnetic phenomena in a superconductor with pin-
ning centers in the mixed state. In many cases, we can neglect the kinetic energy in
Eq. (A3.5), and the suitable energy density to be minimized is
1
2l0
B2 þ Up;
ðA3:9Þ
where Up is the pinning energy. Minimizing this energy with respect to the dis-
placement of quantized magnetic ﬂuxes leads to Eq. (A3.7) for an isolated super-
conductor.(1) That is, the variation in the magnetic energy due to the deformation of
magnetic structure brings about the Lorentz force, and the variation in the pinning
energy gives the pinning force density. We can extend this relationship to a
non-isolated case and then to a general irreversible case. Thus, we obtain the force
balance equation that describes practical electromagnetic phenomena in supercon-
ductors. The Lorentz force given by the ﬁrst term in Eq. (A3.7) is transformed to
i  B ¼ 1

ðB  rÞB  1



:
ðA3:10Þ
Each term on the right side is expressed as an elastic restoring force against the
distortion of quantized magnetic ﬂuxes. The ﬁrst term gives the line tension for the
bent magnetic ﬂuxes in Fig. A3.6a, and the second term gives the magnetic pressure
to make the magnetic ﬂux density uniform in Fig. A3.6b. The Lorentz force derived
in Exercise 11.11 is the magnetic pressure.
It is known that various peculiar electromagnetic phenomena called longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld effects are observed when we apply a current to a long supercon-
ducting wire or slab in a parallel magnetic ﬁeld.(2) In this condition, the current and
Fig. A3.6 Distortions of quantized magnetic ﬂuxes: a bending of magnetic ﬂuxes and b gradient

magnetic ﬂux density are parallel to each other, and the Lorentz force on the
quantized magnetic ﬂux is zero i  B ¼ 0
ð
Þ. This state is called the force-free state.
However, the magnetic structure contains a twisted distortion produced by the
current, as shown in Fig. A3.7. We can expect that some restoring torque works to
reduce the distortion, as shown by the arrows in the ﬁgure. In fact, we can derive
the force-free torque using a similar method in Exercise 11.11.(3) We can explain
that the rotational motion of quantized magnetic ﬂux driven by the restoring torque
causes the peculiar electromagnetic phenomena of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
effects(2).
Such a torque in a static condition is not known in electromagnetism. We can
easily show that r  J 6¼ 0 when a current ﬂows as in Fig. A3.7. Hence, this
situation cannot be realized in normal conductors (see Sect. 7.34). To say this in
more detail, the helicity given by J  B or A  B is not zero in this condition.
In this textbook, we showed that a superconductor can be considered a general
material in electromagnetism. Here, we showed that a superconductor is a more
purely physical material described by a complete theory. We can even expect that
superconductors will open the door to electromagnetic phenomena that people have
never yet experienced.

plane, as shown in Fig. B1.5. The electric ﬁeld strength has only a x-com-
ponent (Ex), and its value must be zero at x ¼ 0. Hence, the electric ﬁeld is
parallel to the surface on the four surfaces parallel to the x-axis, and the surface
integral of the electric ﬁeld strength on these surfaces is zero. The surface

the surface integral of the electric ﬁeld strength in Eq. (1.19) is AExðxÞ, where
A is the area of the surface parallel to the y-z plane. Now, we estimate the total
electric charge inside S. A simple calculation leads to Axq0 for 0  x  a and

the conductor surface is doubled is that there are other electric ﬁeld contri-
butions from electric charges in other areas. For the same reason, the electric
ﬁeld inside the conductor cancels to zero. Examples are found in the case
where an electric charge of different kind is distributed on the surface of the
opposite electrode of a capacitor, as shown in Fig. B2.1a, or in the case where
an electric charge of the same kind stays on the opposite surface of the
conductor, as shown in Fig. B2.1b. The situation in Example 1.4 corresponds
to the thin limit of the conductor in Fig. B2.1b.

4:3. We denote the plane determined by the normal vector n on the interface and
the electric ﬁeld E1 in dielectric material 1 as S. Assume that the electric ﬁeld
E2 in dielectric material 2 does not lie on this plane. We consider a plane, S′,
normal to both the interface and S and deﬁne a small rectangle on S′ that
includes the interface. The two sides of the rectangle are parallel to the
interface. When we integrate the electric ﬁeld along this rectangle, the integral
in dielectric material 2 is not zero, while that in dielectric material 1 is zero.
This is contradictory, since Eq. (1.30) is not satisﬁed under this assumption.
Thus, we prove that the electric ﬁeld E2 also lies on plane S.

Since the electric ﬁeld is parallel to the surface, there is no polarization charge
on the surface (rp ¼ 0). If we look at this phenomenon on a much wider scale,

electric charge. The force of F ¼ qvB acts on the charge along the y-axis,
resulting in the condition that the charges are accumulated on the side of the

axis, and the electric force F′=qE works on the charge. In the steady state, we
attain the balanced condition given by F þ F0 ¼ 0. Hence, we obtain the

This is called the Hall electric ﬁeld. The sign of the Hall electric ﬁeld is
determined by the sign of electric charge. That is, the sign of the Hall electric
ﬁeld clariﬁes whether the current-carrying charges are electrons (q ¼ e) or
holes (q=e). This phenomenon, i.e., the induction of the electric ﬁeld in the
direction normal to the current and magnetic ﬂux density is called the Hall
effect.

By eliminating x2 on the right-hand side using Eq. (1), we can show that the
above equation reduces to the right-hand side of Eq. (3). Thus, the magnetic
ﬂux density is parallel to the equivector potential surface.
This can also be solved geometrically. We assume a circle that is of the same
structure as the equivector potential surface in the x-y plane, as shown in
Fig. B6.5. The azimuthal angle at point P on the circle is denoted by u. Other
angles are deﬁned as shown in this ﬁgure. Since b þ u is equal to p=2, it is
easy to show that a ¼ c ¼ 2u. Hence, the angle of the tangential line vector on
P, c, is 2u. This is equal to the angle of the magnetic ﬂux density shown
above, and it is proved that the magnetic ﬂux density is parallel to the
cylindrical surface.

7:3. The reason why the magnetic ﬂux density produced by the current ﬂowing on
the superconductor surface is doubled is that there are other magnetic ﬂux
density contributions from currents ﬂowing in other areas. For the same rea-
son, the magnetic ﬂux density inside the superconductor cancels to zero.
Examples are found in the case where a current ﬂows along the opposite
direction on the surface of the opposite plate of a superconducting transmis-
sion line, as shown in Fig. B7.1a, or in the case where a current ﬂows along
the same direction on the opposite surface of the superconductor, as shown in

S′, normal to both the interface and S and deﬁne a small rectangle on S′ that
includes the interface. The two sides of the rectangle are parallel to the
interface. When we integrate the magnetic ﬁeld along this rectangle, the
integral in magnetic material 2 is not zero, while that in magnetic material 1 is
zero. The circular integral of the magnetic ﬁeld should be zero, since the
planar current s ﬂows on plane S′. Hence, the above assumption is contra-

10:8. We denote the current ﬂowing in the circuit by I. Since the electromotive
force induced in the coil is Lð@I=@tÞ, the potential difference applied to the
resistor is V  Lð@I=@tÞ, which is equal to RrI. Thus, we have

10:9. So that the current I ﬂows in the conductor of electric resistance R0
r in a unit
length, the electric ﬁeld strength that the electric power source supplies is
E0 ¼ R0
rI  v  B:
The electric power inside the conductor is the sum of the component from the
electric power source, E0  I, and the component from the induced electric
ﬁeld, I  ðv  BÞ. This leads to R0
rI2, i.e., the electric power consumed in the
conductor. The remaining electric power from the source contributes to the
mechanical work on the outside as shown in Eq. (10.17).
Thus, the work done by the induced electric ﬁeld is virtual and cannot really
be measured. The induced electric ﬁeld prevents all the electric energy from
the electric power source from being consumed as Joule heat in the con-
ductor but converts part of it to the mechanical work on the outside.
The Lorentz force does no mechanical work on moving electric charges
(electrons). However, the charges driven by the Lorentz force do mechanical
work on ions in a material that force the charges to ﬂow along the conductor
through the Coulomb interaction. This is why the conductor moves. As a
result, it looks as though the Lorentz force does mechanical work. In this
case, the current decreases because of the law of conservation of energy, if
the electric power from the source is not sufﬁcient. The lost energy of the
charges is the kinetic energy that is given by the electric power source in the
initial state but not given by the Lorentz force.

carry a small current, DI0, from the position R=R∞to the conductor, an
attractive force, l0I0DI0=ð2pRÞ, works on the small current of a unit length.
Since the return current is uniformly distributed at R∞, the force from the

The electromotive force is induced to reduce the current in both the con-

such a state with a higher energy. In reality, this virtual force is the pinning
force (see Sect. A3.3 in the Appendix), and the work done by the Lorentz
force is dissipated as the pinning loss.
