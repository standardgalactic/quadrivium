Preface
Dear potential reader of this book,
It is my pleasure to recognize that you start reading this preface and maybe
continue reading the book afterward. Therefore, I would like to use this pref-
ace to provide some background information about this book project, but also
to acknowledge the assistance of many people I experienced during writing the
manuscript.
Let me start with the background information. From 2017, I am regularly read-
ing lectures on “Structure of Matter” for master students of photonics at the
Abbe School of Photonics, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany. This is
an international master degree program, and the students come from all over
the world, holding a bachelor’s degree in engineering or natural sciences usu-
ally earned in their home countries. The mentioned course is given in the ﬁrst
semester of the master program and is intended to provide (or repeat) basic knowl-
edge on atomic, molecular, and solid-state physics with emphasis on light–matter
interactions within one semester.
Clearly, these topics would ﬁll dozens of books, such that the lecturer has to
make a selection of topics and to deﬁne a logical path how to arrange the mate-
rial. After having understood the heterogeneous composition of the audience, and
having consulted relevant sources, I decided to design an individual course that is
constructed according to the following rules:
• A strong bottom-up approach with regard to the material objects: We start from
microscopic objects and ﬁnally arrive at continuous media.
• Focus on basics, not on modern developments. The latter are topic of subse-
quent courses.
• The primary target group are photonics students and not students of physics.
• Where possible, classical models are presented to illustrate the nature of the
phenomena. In parallel, quantum mechanical models are developed as a tool
for reliable quantitative predictions.
• No thematic demarcation from other disciplines of natural sciences.
• Parallelism to daily life experience is provided by allusions to surrounding
nature, architecture, as well as the use of artwork.
In this context, I have to express my thanks to the students that listened to the
course and gave me critical feedback in terms of the lecture evaluation procedure.
I used a lot of their remarks to improve the course. Finally, I came to the conclusion
that this course may be of interest to a broader audience. Therefore, I extended the
lecture script to the book you are now holding in hand or have on the computer
screen.
Studying physics is like climbing an inﬁnitely high rock in misty weather condi-
tions. When you start, close to the bottom, the fog is densest, and it is challenging
to propagate into the correct direction. When you lose orientation, the fog will
never clear up, and ﬁnally you give up. But if you succeed climbing higher, you
will observe that the view becomes better. Now you may see a part of the way in
front of you, and you may also see other ways that go into the correct direction.

Preface
ix
And even more, you observe connection paths between these ways. But the aim is
still in the fog. The frustrating thing is the following: The higher you climb, the
more you can see. In particular, you observe that the way in front of you seems
to become longer and longer, because although you get an always wider view, the
summit still remains in the fog, because of the inﬁnite height of the rock. Love it
or leave it—I decided to love it.
With respect to this book, that means: I cannot deﬁne objective borders of
the physical ﬁeld I am going to describe in this book. Often enough, I will have
to make a subjective decision to stop going into further detail and indicate that
a deeper treatment of the topic is outside the scope of this book. In these cases,
please remember that the topical seed of the book is a one-semester lecture course.
You will ﬁnd enough advanced literature recommendations at the relevant places.
Naturally, because of the interdisciplinarity of the topic, there appears some
overlap to other books I have written before on similar topics. This particularly
concerns the book: The Physics of Thin Film Optical Spectra: An Introduction.
Some basic stuff from this book is reused here.
So, this is the background information on the origin of this book project. Let
me now come to the acknowledgments.
• First of all, I would like to express my thanks to Prof. Andreas Tünnermann,
who gave me the possibility to read that lecture course at Abbe School of
Photonics.
• My next thanks are to Zachary Evenson and all his co-workers from the
Springer book company for their interest to this topic as well as supervision
and assistance during the project.
• As in a previous book project, I again collaborated with Astrid Leiterer (www.
astrid-art.de). She supplied me with photographs of her subtle paintings and
sculptures. I use these illustrations for providing an atmospheric background
for the physical phenomena to be presented in the corresponding chapter. I am
very grateful to Astrid for having given this possibility to me again.
• Also, I again collaborated with Dr. Alexander Stendal (www.winternet.de/ste
ndal/gallery.htm). He prepared tailored cartoons for illustrating important phys-
ical concepts in a manner that everybody can understand their essence. I my
view, these illustrations are invaluably useful in the book, while in fact their
function is twofold: They provide explicit physical information and increase
the reading pleasure. Many thanks to Alexander for that.
• Our surrounding nature is rich in examples of illustrative optical phenomena—
just remember the rainbow. But even ordinary clouds appearing on the sky may
be full of fascinating secrets. During a mountain hike, I recognized strange dou-
ble formations of clouds as shown in Fig. 7.3 on top. I decided to use one of
them for illustration purposes in this book and contacted experts for an assign-
ment of the cloud type. And I had to recognize that similar to spectroscopy,
a restricted amount of information makes an unambiguous assignment practi-
cally impossible. In the mentioned case, I consulted experts from the Bergische

Preface
Universität Wuppertal and Bonn University. I got several assignment propos-
als that I am listing here: Cumulus velum, Cumulus pileus, or a combination of
Cumulus (humilis) and Altocumulus lenticularis. In this context, I am grateful
to Marc Krebsbach, Christian Ohlwein, Andreas Hense, Clemens Simmer, Nils
Risse, and Victor Venema, who watched over the photograph and provided the
mentioned assignment proposals.
• Also, in architecture you may ﬁnd esthetic examples of the tricky use of sym-
metry elements. I decided to include several of them into the solid-state physics,
Chap. 16. I am grateful to Martin Heider (Doberan Minster, Germany) and Ulf
Koischwitz (St. Aegidii Church Quedlinburg, Germany) for giving the permis-
sion to use these photographs in this book. In particular, Martin Heider gave
me extensive background information on the historical origin of the tessellation
shown in Figs. 16.5–16.7, as explained in the ﬁgure caption.
• Several of my (former) students provided graphs to the lecture script, and I am
reusing some of them here. I do not remember all family names, so that my
thanks are simply to my (former) students Fanhui, Rahil, Abrar, and JianYing
from the Abbe School of Photonics for their assistance.

Part I: Selected Facets of the Light–Matter Interaction in Classical Physics
In many cases, the interaction of light with matter is rather unspectacular. However,
there appear situations where dramatic phenomena are observed. You do not need
lasers for that. One of the world’s largest geyser ﬁelds, the El Tatio geyser ﬁeld, is
located in the Atacama Desert at an altitude of 4320 m. Because of the large intraday
temperature differences, the geysers show the most spectacular activity immediately
after sunrise.

Introduction
Abstract
Relevant characteristic dimensions of matter are introduced in order to provide
a feeling for what we will later call the micro- and macroworlds. Selected basic
physical and mathematical skills are repeated to facilitate sophisticated solution
of the problems that are offered at the end of each chapter.
1.1
Some Characteristic Dimensions
This short introduction is to make you familiar with some characteristic dimen-
sions that are speciﬁc for different material systems. Our focus will be on orders
of magnitude rather than on accurate numbers.
Everybody has some intuitive feeling on what a length is, what a time inter-
val is, or what a mass is. And we have certain personal experience and skills in
handling these quantities. This daily experience works over many orders of mag-
nitude: We have a feeling for length dimensions ranging from less than 1 mm up
to hundreds of kilometers (8 orders of magnitude), masses from approximately 1 g
to 100 kg (5 orders of magnitude), time scales from approximately 0.1 s (humans
reaction time) up to 100 years (more is seldom)—10 orders of magnitude. And we
are familiar with velocities ranging from that of a propagating snail up to that of an
airplane. The classical Newtonian mechanics provide us with a quantitative theory
that excellently reproduces all mechanical phenomena observed at these scales.
Why to develop further physical concepts? In order to understand this need, it
makes sense to have a look at the corresponding characteristic dimensions occur-
ring in the nature around us. Table 1.1 gives a short overview on the dynamic
range in spatial extensions, characteristic times, and masses that are observed for
different macroscopic and microscopic objects.
We note that the dynamic ranges are immense: Although the electron is by far
not the lightest particle, we note that the universe is for more than 80 orders of

magnitude heavier than a single electron. A similar situation is observed when
comparing the length and time scales. All these dimensions vary over much more
orders of magnitude than our experience provides. This is exempliﬁed in Fig. 1.1,
which combines some of the data from Table 1.1 with the mentioned orders of
magnitude normally accessible to our experience. It would therefore be a method-
ological mistake to automatically extend the range of validity of our experience

to phenomena which are observed at much larger or smaller dimensions. Instead,
we even have to expect, that at very large or small dimensions, things will happen
that contradict our daily experience. Unfortunately, this is something that we have
to accept. So we need additional theoretical tools that describe the properties of
matter at dimensions not accessible to our daily experience.
Taking into account the information given in Table 1.1, it appears not so
astonishing that so far there exists no unique physical theory that describes the
properties of matter at all length, time, and mass scales. The one extreme—the
universe—is rather a topic to be described in terms of general relativity. Small
objects, however, like molecules or atoms are accurately described by means of
quantum mechanics.
1.2
The Organization of This Book
In this book, an approach to the structure of matter and its interaction with light
is proposed that is designed to the needs of students of photonic disciplines. Our
focus will be on degrees of freedom in matter that efﬁciently interact with light,
mainly covering spectral ranges like infrared, visible, or ultraviolet light. Note that
throughout this book, we will for simplicity use the termini “light” and “electro-
magnetic radiation” as synonyms. As it will be shown in the next chapter, the
relevant degrees of freedom in matter arise from the excitation of different inter-
nal “vibrations” of electrons and nuclei in atoms, molecules or condensed systems.
Therefore, the focus of our approach will be
• On atoms, molecules as well as the dynamics of charge carriers in solids
• Their interaction with electromagnetic radiation.
When consulting Table 1.1 (atoms, molecules), we see that we will arrive at
dimensions which are very much smaller than those where our experience works.
Therefore, instead of our experience, we will have to use formal theoretical tools
in order to develop a quantitative description of what is going on when light is
interacting with an atom or molecule. Fortunately, an adequate theory is available,
it is the already mentioned apparatus of quantum mechanics.
One remark concerning the organization of the book: Starting from Chap. 2, all
chapters will be organized in an identical manner, including the Sections:
1. Starting point (accepted experimental data or theoretical concepts)
2. Physical idea(s) (how we want to proceed…)
3. Theoretical considerations (new material)
4. Consistency considerations
5. Application to practical problems
6. Advanced material
7. Tasks for self-check (solutions will be provided at the end of the book)

Introduction
8. Literature. Note that general literature shall be easily accessible. For special
examples, I sometimes make use of speciﬁc (maybe older) references that are
not so easily accessible. Nevertheless I feel some obligation to indicate the
original source.
Generally, in each of the chapters, the reader is supposed to be familiar with the
technical material presented in the corresponding ﬁrst section. If not, it is recom-
mended to consult other literature sources, such as collected in the section: General
Literature, and/or to repeat the previous chapter(s) of this book.
For quick reading, it might be, in principle, sufﬁcient to read the sections 2–5 in
each chapter. These sections contain the basic learning stuff of the given chapter.
Nevertheless, the remaining 6th section may also provide new ideas or concepts,
and may make the following chapters more understandable.
Note that the main body of the text is written on a normal white background.
A grey background indicates rules of thumb or mnemonic tricks for mem-
orizing. Also, verbal illustrations for a better “visualization” of theoretical
results may be offered here. Note that these verbal illustrations are never
strong in a scientiﬁc sense.
The remark providing some additional material. The remarks are not necessary to
read for understanding the further material.
1.3
A Remark on Calculations
Just for repetition, it makes sense to emphasize the correct treatment of measure-
ment units. A physical quantity Q is usually written as:Q = {Q}[Q]; where {Q}
is the numerical value of Q, while [Q] is the measurement unit of Q. Thus, if we
indicate the length of 15 m, we shall write:
l = 15 m. Here, “m” is the measurement unit (a meter), i.e., [l] = m, while
“15” is the numerical value, i.e., {l} = 15. Both information must be indicated in
order to provide an unambiguous quantiﬁcation of l.
In the following chapters, a lot of calculations will be provided in order to
make the reader familiar with characteristic values of the parameters we are work-
ing with. Not all of these calculations are shown in full detail, but the reader is
rather invited to check the calculations himselves. But here we will provide one
characteristic example and a corresponding recommendation how to deal with this
type of calculation. This example is to emphasize the calculation principle and
therefore included into this classical part of the book, although it will contain a
“quantum constant”, namely ℏ. Our example is to calculate what is hidden behind

the following expression:

The corresponding constants are given in the section: Survey of constants. From
there we have:

The recommendation is now to separate measurement units and orders of
magnitude from the rest. That gives:

Consequently,
4πε0ℏ2

≈0.53 × 10−10m = 0.053 nm
What we have calculated is some characteristic length, as it is evident from the
obtained measurement unit. The physical sense of that length will become clear in
Chap. 8.

Simplest Model Treatment
of the Classical Interaction of Light
with Matter
Abstract
A short review of selected aspects of light–matter interactions in classical
physics is provided. The treatment is restricted to electric dipole interactions.
After a short introduction to the two-body problem, a classical approach to light
emission and absorption is presented. Characteristic absorption frequencies or
wavelength is estimated in terms of simple model assumptions.
2.1
Starting Point
Let us start from recalling some basic knowledge on electromagnetic radiation.
Imagine the simplest situation: a monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave that
is propagating in vacuum (Fig. 2.1).
In complex notation, its electric ﬁeld strength vector E may be given as:
E(r, t) = E0e−i(ωt−kr)
(2.1)
Here, ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2π
T ); T is the period (i.e., the time nec-
essary for performing one oscillation). Moreover, k is the wavevector (|k| = k =
2π
λ ; k = ke); λ is the wavelength in vacuum, and ν = 1
λ is called the wavenumber.
e is the so-called unit propagation vector. We have the obvious relations:
ω = 2π
T = 2π f = 2πc
λ
= kc, with f —ordinary frequency and c—velocity of
light in vacuum. Some selected spectral regions of electromagnetic radiation are
summarized in Table 2.1.
In a plane electromagnetic wave propagating in vacuum, the magnetic ﬁeld
strength H follows from (2.1a):

Of course, our goal is to describe the interaction of light with matter. There-
fore, our focus is not on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in vacuum;
instead, we shall bring the light wave into interaction with a material system.
Depending on the speciﬁc kind of matter, the latter may be characterized by
speciﬁc characteristic internal time and length constants. On the other hand, the
monochromatic plane wave introduced by (2.1) has only one characteristic time
(the period, corresponding to a certain frequency) and only one characteristic
length (the wavelength).

2.1
Starting Point
15
As an intuitive rule of thumb, we have to expect rather strong (resonant)
interaction between light and matter, when:
• ω comes close to a resonance angular frequency (eigenfrequency) of the
material system, or
• λ comes close to a characteristic spatial dimension of the material system.
If neither the frequency nor the wavelength match any internal eigenfrequency
of characteristic length of the material system, the interaction is nonresonant
and, as a rule, much weaker than in the resonant case.
Remark Let us make a remark concerning a convention implicitly made when writ-
ing down (2.1). Of course, the natural writing of the electric ﬁeld in a monochromatic
plane wave would operate with real functions and coefﬁcients only. For such real
ﬁelds, we could use a description of the type:
Ereal(r, t) = E0,real cos(ωt −kr + δ)
(2.2)
However, the cosine function appears to be quite inconvenient with respect to our
further mathematical treatment. On the other hand, it can be written as:
Ereal(r, t) = 1
2

E0,reale−i(ωt−kr)e−iδ + E0,realei(ωt−kr)eiδ
≡E0e−i(ωt−kr) + c.c
(2.3)
Here, “c.c.” denotes the conjugate complex to the preceding expression. It turns
out that the assumed monochromatic real electric ﬁeld may be expressed as the sum
of a complex ﬁeld and its conjugate complex counterpart, while the latter does not
contain any new physical information. Hereby, we have introduced the complex ﬁeld
amplitude E0 as:
E0 ≡E0,reale−iδ
2
(2.4)
In practice, it appears much more convenient to build the further theory using
complex electric ﬁelds E(r,t) according to (2.1) and (2.4) instead of working with
the real version (2.2). Therefore, in our treatment we make use of the complex ﬁeld
deﬁned by (2.1), keeping in mind that the real ﬁeld will be obtained when adding
the complex conjugate to (2.1). Or, in other words:
Ereal(r, t) = 2ReE((r, t)
(2.5)
Here, E(r,t) is given by (2.1) and (2.4).

But I would like to direct your attention onto a speciﬁc detail. The choice of (2.1)
for the complex writing of the electric ﬁeld deﬁnes a particular convention, which
is used throughout this course. When looking at (2.3), it becomes evident that we
could have used the writing:
Ereal(r, t) = 1
2

E0,reale+i(ωt−kr)e+iδ + E0,reale−i(ωt−kr)e−iδ
≡E0e+i(ωt−kr) + c.c;
E0 ≡E0,reale+iδ
2
as well. In our further treatment, we will use the minus sign as ﬁxed in (2.1). In other
sources, the other convention (with the plus sign) may be used, which may result in
differences in some of the equations to be derived in this course.

interval) of the wave propagating in vacuum is then:

2.2
Physical Idea
Let us now start discussing the interaction between a propagating light wave and
a material system. We have already introduced the plane monochromatic wave as
our model for describing the impact of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. What we still
need is a corresponding model for the material system.
We will choose the two-body system as the simplest possible model system for
understanding the general principles of the interaction of light with matter. Indeed,
basic optical properties arise from so-called electric dipole interactions between the
electric ﬁeld of the electromagnetic wave and the charge carriers in the material
system. But an electric dipole is formed by a minimum of two charges, a positive
and a negative one. So in our basic model, we will have to regard two bodies
(here material points), which will later be assumed to be electrically charged and
interacting with a light wave (Fig. 2.2).
If so, the interaction mechanism is rather clear. The oscillating electric ﬁeld of
the wave gives rise to Coulomb forces that result in an oscillatory movement of the
charge carriers in the medium (here the two-body system(s)). This way, oscillating
electric dipoles are excited, which provide the basic mechanism of the interaction
of light with matter in the so-called electric dipole approximation. In a classical
language, the excitation of the oscillating dipoles can be described in terms of
Newton’s equation of motion.
Note that in this approximation, magnetic interactions are neglected. We will
not consider any Lorentz forces acting on the charge carriers. Therefore, in the

Fc
Fig.2.2 Illustration of the formation of an oscillating electric dipole by the electric ﬁeld of the

electromagnetic wave, we focus on the electric ﬁeld strength vector and (at least
at the moment) forget the magnetic one.
Why can we do so? Let us have a look at the expressions for the Coulomb and
Lorentz forces FC and FL. We have:
FC = qE
FL = qv × B
Obviously, a resting charge feels a Coulomb force, but no Lorentz force. In
order to give rise to a relevant Lorentz force, the charge carrier should have a
corresponding velocity v. Hence, if we start from “resting” charges, the electric
ﬁeld must ﬁrst bring the charge carriers into motion, in order to allow the Lorentz
force coming into the game. But if the oscillating electric ﬁeld is not too strong,
the charge carriers will never achieve the necessary velocity to make magnetic
interactions comparable to the electric ones.
Remark Note that in a plane monochromatic electromagnetic wave propagating
in vacuum, the relation B =
E
c holds (compare (2.1a) and consider B = μ0H).
Here, B = |B| and so on. Therefore, making use of a rectangular geometry, we
have: FL = qvB = q v
c E = v
c FC. In the nonrelativistic case, v≪c, and therefore,
FL ≪FC.

2.3.1
On the Two-Body System
Imagine now two point masses m1 and m2 in a Cartesian coordinate system as
shown in Fig. 2.3.
Their distance from each other is characterized by the vector r.
Obviously:
r1 + r = r2
Their kinetic energy is given by:
Tkin = m1
2 ˙r2
1 + m2
2 ˙r2
2
Let us change from the coordinates r1, r2 to the coordinates
r = r2 −r1
R = m1r1 + m2r2
M
(2.7)
where M = m1 + m2. Then, the vector R marks the position of the mass center
of the two point masses. We then ﬁnd:
r1 = R −m2
M r
r2 = R + m1
M r

19
This way, we obtain the kinetic energy:
Tkin = M
2
˙R2 + μ
2 ˙r2
(2.8)
where μ =
m1m2
m1+m2 is called the reduced mass of the system of the two point
masses.
The full kinetic energy of the system is thus composed from the translational
movement of the mass center and the relative movement of the point masses with
respect to each other.
When placing the origin of coordinates into the center of mass, we set:
R = 0
˙R = 0.
(2.8a)
Then,
Tkin = μ
2 ˙r2
(2.9)
The full derivative of r with respect to time may be composed from two con-
tributions: the change in the distance between the point masses (absolute value
of r, we simply write r for that) and a change in orientation of r, which can be
expressed in terms of the polar angle ϕ. Hence, in terms of the Pythagoras theorem
we have:
˙r2 = ˙r2 + r2 ˙φ2
(2.10)
Let us regard two special cases:
(a) Pure rotation (˙r = 0; ˙φ ̸= 0)
Then,
Tkin = μ
2 r2 ˙φ2 = I
2	2
(2.11)
with I = μr2—mass moment of inertia, and ˙φ = 	—angular frequency of
rotation. We obtain the well-known expression for the rotational energy of a
rigid body in classical physics.
(b) Pure distance change (e.g., pure vibration): ( ˙φ = 0; ˙r ̸= 0).
Let us assume that both material points interact with an interaction potential
U = U(|r2 −r1|) = U(r). Then, each of the material points will experience
an interaction force from the other one, namely F12 and F21 = −F12 (Fig. 2.3).
On the other hand, we have Newton’s law of motion:
F =

−dU
dr


(2.12)

20
2
Simplest Model Treatment of the Classical Interaction …
We obtain
¨r = ¨r2 −¨r1 = F21
m2 −F12
m1 = F21
μ ≡F
μ or
μ¨r = F
(2.12a)
which is again identical to the classical Newton’s law of motion provided that the
“normal” mass is replaced by the reduced mass. In order to describe a vibration,
the introduced interaction forces must be of a restoring nature; i.e., they should
push the system back to an equilibrium position when the latter has been perturbed.
From (2.8) to (2.10), we learn that besides of translation, the two-body system
may have “vibrational” and “rotational” degrees of freedom.
What is the use of the presented theory? Provided that our interest to the dynam-
ics of a two-body system is restricted to its rotational and vibrational degrees of
freedom, the introduction of the reduced mass concept allows a signiﬁcant facil-
itation of the task. Indeed, the system of two (possibly interacting by a potential
U(|r2 −r1|)) particles with masses m1 and m2, as well as coordinates r1 and r2,
is practically replaced by a single particle with the reduced mass μ =
m1m2
m1+m2 and
the coordinates r in an external potential U(r). In the special case of r = const.,
we will call it a rigid rotor.
So far, our two-body system is a rather abstract model conﬁguration. In
Sect. 2.5, we will use it to perform simple estimations of characteristic eigen-
frequencies of different types of material systems.
2.3.2
The Classical Picture of Light Absorption
Let us for simplicity assume some microscopic object (e.g., an atom), which has
no permanent electric dipole moment. That means, the dipole moment should be
zero when the applied electric ﬁeld is zero for a sufﬁciently long time.
When being illuminated by light, the oscillating electric ﬁeld strength in the
wave E causes a Coulomb force acting on the charge carriers, thus resulting in the
formation of an oscillating induced dipole moment. This is the situation that has
been sketched in Fig. 2.2.
We should mention in this connection that we deal with a microscopic object
that is much smaller than the wavelength of the light. Therefore, when assuming
an electric ﬁeld as given by (2.1):
E(r, t) = E0e−i(ωt−kr)
It is reasonable neglecting the spatial variation of the electric ﬁeld over the
extension of the object. Instead, in our model, we replace (2.1) by an oscillating
ﬁeld according to:
E = E(t) = E0e−iωt

2.3
Theoretical Considerations
21
Let us now regard the motion of a charge carrier, which is bound to its equilib-
rium position (x = 0) by an elastic restoring force (spring constant κ = μω2
0). The
oscillating ﬁeld may lead to small (x ≪λ) movements of the charge carriers, thus
inducing dipoles that interact with the ﬁeld. While the atoms are composed from
nuclei and electrons, the nuclei are much heavier than the electrons, so that they
will be considered as ﬁxed. Then, in our model only the electrons are in motion
when a harmonic electric ﬁeld is applied, and the reduced mass is almost identical
to the electron mass. The equation of motion of a single charge carrier with mass
m (usually an electron) around its equilibrium position is then:
qE = qE0e−iωt = m ¨x + 2γ m ˙x + mω2
0x
(2.13)
This is the equation for driven oscillations of a damped harmonic oscillator with
the eigenfrequency ω0. m and q are the mass and charge of the charge carriers, and
γ is a damping constant necessary to consider the damping of the charge carrier
(here electrons) movement. We assume that the electric ﬁeld is polarized along
the x-axis; hence, we consider only movements of the electrons along the x-axis.
Assuming well-established oscillations according to x(t) = xoe−iωt, we obtain:
qE
m = ω2
0x −ω2x −2iγ ωx
This leads to the following expression for the elongation of the charge carriers:
x = qE
m
1
ω2
0 −ω2 −2iωγ
(2.14)
This relation describes a resonant behavior of the accumulated (absorbed)
energy, when the angular frequency ω of the ﬁeld approaches ω0. In this reso-
nance condition, the interaction between radiation and matter is expected to be
most effective.
The energy W gained by the charge carrier must have been taken from the light
wave, so we really describe a light absorption process. In a symbolic writing, we
have:
absorption
∝|x|2 ∝
1

ω2
0 −ω22 + 4ω2γ 2
If damping is weak, we have γ
2 ≪ω02. In the immediate vicinity of the
resonance frequency, we assume ω ≈ω0, and then we obtain:
absorption
∝

(ω0 −ω)2 + γ 2
(2.14a)

22

Fig.2.4 Lorentzian line
We ﬁnd that absorption is centered in a symmetric manner in a certain frequency
interval around the central absorption frequency. In this connection, we speak on
an absorption line. The absorption line deﬁned by (2.14a) has a symmetric shape
and is called a Lorentzian line (Fig. 2.4). It describes the shape of an absorption
line in terms of the so-called classical single oscillator model.
Apart from resonance, the absorption decreases and achieves 50% of the
maximum value at the frequencies:
ω −ω0 = ±γ
(2.15)
The value 2γ therefore represents the so-called full width at half Maximum
(FWHM) and is an important characteristic of any spectral line. In the present
simplest version of our classical theory, the width of a spectral line is exclusively
determined by the damping constant γ.
Note that such an absorption line is completely deﬁned by three parameters:
the central frequency, the linewidth, and the line intensity. We will provide a more
detailed discussion of the classical oscillator model later in Chap. 14.
2.3.3
The Classical Picture of Light Emission
In order to deal with light emission, we will have to make use of a result from clas-
sical electrodynamics. From there, it is known that any oscillating electric dipole
acts as an emitter of electromagnetic radiation. The full loss of energy per time
caused by light emission is given by:
dW
dt = −

(2.16)
Here, the average is taken over a relevant time period, say a few oscillation
periods, the latter being performed along the x-axis again. For the motion of a

classical harmonic oscillator, we have:
x = x0 cos ω0t with
W = mω2
0x2
0

Let us assume weak damping; i.e., the amplitude of the oscillation xo is almost
constant during one period. Substituting into (2.16) yields:

6πε0c3

(2.17)
In order to get access to the spectral shape of the emission line, let us have
a look on the frequency spectrum of the emitted light. An oscillating dipole
performing damped but free oscillations is described by:
m ¨x + 2γ m ˙x + mω2
0x = 0
This equation may be solved by means of the approach:
x = x00eξ t
That leads to:
ξ = −γ ±

γ 2 −ω2
0 = −γ ± i

ω2
0 −γ 2
We further assume weak damping again:
ω2
0 >> γ 2
and obtain after having chosen the minus sign
x(t) ≈x00e−γ te−iω0t = x0(t)e−iω0t
(2.18)
This is no more a pure harmonic oscillation, and therefore, the emitted spec-
trum is not monochromatic. When performing a Fourier transformation, we get
information on the spectral composition F(ω) of x(t). We ﬁnd:
F(ω) ∝
 ∞
−∞
xeiωtdt
Let the emission process start at t = 0. Then,
F(ω) ∝





(ω0 −ω)2 + γ 2
The conclusion is that the emission is centered around the central frequency,
such that we have to observe an emission line. It also has to be a Lorentzian
lineshape.
Remark From x ≈x00e−γ te−iω0t, we ﬁnd the expected damping of the oscillation
amplitude, with a decay time of τ amplitude = γ −1. As the energy is proportional to
the square of the amplitude, it will dissipate with half the decay time, so that we get:
τW = (2γ )−1
(2.19)
Hence, the decay time for the energy τ W equals the reciprocal value of the
FWHM of the corresponding Lorentzian, when the latter is given in angular fre-
quency units. The longer the energy remains in the system, the narrower is the
corresponding absorption line. The linewidth deﬁned through τ W is called the nat-
ural linewidth of the oscillator. If one is able to measure the natural linewidth
experimentally, the decay time may be calculated.
We further note in this context that the Lorentzian lineshape appears as a
necessary result of exponential damping of the dipole oscillations in the time
domain.
Let us ﬁnally estimate the emission time, when damping is caused by light
irradiation only.
From (2.17), we have:
dW

6πε0c3m W ∝W

For an electron oscillating with an angular frequency of 1016 s−1, the emission
time τ W will be around 2 * 10−9 s. That corresponds to an FWHM of 5 * 108 s−1.

Consistency Considerations

2.4
Consistency Considerations
Although the theoretical considerations presented in this chapter are based on clas-
sical physics only, we have already arrived at an extremely important result: Single
resonances in a piece of matter may give rise to spectroscopic features such as
absorption lines and emission lines. We have found that absorption and emission
lineshapes are identical. This is by the way necessary in order to keep consistency
with Kirchhoff’s radiation laws (see later Sect. 7.5.2). Absorption and emission
resonance frequencies are speciﬁc to different materials and are widely used in
applied spectroscopy for identiﬁcation purposes.
However, it appears that the physical picture developed so far is not consistent
with our experience on the stability of atoms and molecules. Generally, the emis-
sion of electromagnetic radiation by accelerated charge carriers is nothing speciﬁc
to optics; instead, it is of greatest importance, for example, in the radio frequency
(rf) technology. But in application to microscopic objects like atoms, this leads to
rather peculiar consequences. Thus, if in a classical picture, an atom is thought
to consist of a positively charged nucleus, surrounded by electrons which move
around the nucleus on circular orbits, their movement should permanently give
rise to electromagnetic radiation. This must result in a loss of kinetic energy of the
electrons, such that after a certain time, the atom collapses because the electrons
fall into the nucleus. Let us estimate the “lifetime” of a classical atom.
For that estimation, let us choose a hydrogen atom, consisting of a proton sur-
rounded by an electron, the latter moving with a velocity v on a (nearly) circular
orbit of radius r. This is a two-body system with a reduced mass close to that of a
single electron. On a circular orbit, the Coulomb attraction force should be equal
to the centrifugal force, such that

When choosing (Table 1.1) r ≈0.08 nm, we can estimate ω0 ≈2.2 ∗1016 s−1.
This angular frequency falls deep into the UV spectral region, which is neverthe-
less a qualitatively acceptable result, because many of the hydrogen atom emission
lines are really observed in the UV. However—according to (2.20)—this angular
frequency corresponds to a classical “lifetime” that is smaller than 10−9 s. Thus, a
classical hydrogen atom should collapse within 10−9 s (Fig. 2.5)—a really pecu-
liar result that is in complete contradiction to reality. In general, for higher order
atoms, the assumed orbit radius of the outermost electrons (the valence electrons)
should be larger, such that the angular frequency becomes smaller and rather falls
into the near-UV or into the -VIS spectral regions. Accordingly, classical lifetimes
of the order of 10−9–10−8 s may be predicted, but this does not eliminate the obvi-
ous paradoxon. We come to the conclusion that something becomes wrong with
classical physics of matter, at least when applying it to microscopic objects like
atoms. But that means that whenever we want to understand the origin of optical
material properties on a microscopic level, we have to make use of another theory

that is consistent with the practical observations. The corresponding theoretical
apparatus has been developed approximately 100 years ago and forms what we
call today quantum mechanics.
In ﬁnishing this section, let us note that it was not only the description of
the dynamics of microscopic matter that revealed inconsistencies between the
classical predictions and experimental results. At the beginning of the twentieth
century, it became more and more clear that the classical wave picture of light
was also insufﬁcient to explain the growing amount of new experimental results.
As a prominent example, let us regard the photoelectric effect: Under the action
of incident light, electrons (so-called photoelectrons) with a certain kinetic energy
Tkin may be emitted from metallic surfaces (Fig. 2.6).
In terms of the classical wave picture, one would expect that a growing light
intensity should result in an increase of the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons.
But this was not observed. Instead, the maximum kinetic energy of the individ-
ual electrons turned out to be proportional to the light frequency. Moreover, a
threshold frequency was observed: Light with a smaller frequency did not produce
photoelectrons at all. Albert Einstein was able to explain the effect in terms of a
quantum hypothesis: He assumed that light may transfer energy to matter only in
discrete portions, which are proportional to the frequency. That “photon energy”
Ephot should be large enough to release the electron from the metal plate, and the
rest of the photon energy may be transferred to kinetic energy. Hence, the energy
balance requires that:
Ephot ≥WA + Tkin
where WA is the material-speciﬁc work function, i.e., the minimum energy
necessary to release an electron. Hence, it follows that
Tkin ≤Ephot −WA
If now the photon energy is assumed to be proportional to the light frequency
f:
Ephot = h f

with h—Planck’s constant, we ﬁnd:
Tkin ≤h f −WA
The threshold frequency f min is given from the condition:
0 ≤Tkin ⇒h f ≥WA ⇒fmin = WA
h , and consequently:
Tkin ≤h( f −fmin)
which was later shown to reproduce the experimental ﬁndings and allowed esti-
mating Planck’s constant. The important conclusion for us is that in contrast to
classical predictions, certain experimental ﬁndings indicate that light energy is
only transferred in discrete portions, given by Ephot = h f .

to the mass of the other particle.
We will now identify our two masses m1 and m2 with the nuclei in a diatomic
molecule; i.e., assume that they may be of the same order of magnitude. In order
to consider a suitable restoring force, we will start from a potential U(r) as shown
in Fig. 2.7 in black.
At large distances, the two atoms do not interact, and therefore, U should
approach zero. At r = ro, we postulate the existence of a local minimum in U,
which marks the equilibrium interatomic distance in the molecule. Obviously, a
dissociation energy D is necessary to excite the molecule until dissociation. From
the well-known relation:
F = −∇U
(2.21)
We further ﬁnd:
If r > r0, F = −dU
dr < 0 and
r < r0, F = −dU
dr > 0
Indeed, when being elongated, the restoring force resulting from the potential
curve shown in Fig. 2.7 will push the system back to the equilibrium distance r0.
For small elongations |x| = |r −r0| << r0, the real potential may be
approximated by a parabola (red curve) U(r) →U(x) = κ
2 x2 −D.
From here, the restoring force could be estimated if κ would be known. As a
rough estimation (Fig. 2.7), we assume a shape of the parabola such that U(x =

2.5.2
Classical Estimation of the Vibration Frequency
of a Valence Electron in an Atom or Molecule
Let us now have a look at “electronic” excitations. In our model, one of the bod-
ies is now identical to an electron, and the other to a nucleus. In classics, the
only difference to Sect. 2.5.1 is in the value of the reduced mass, which is now
about 104 times smaller, while the “spring constants” are of the same order. Thus,
the angular frequency will be about 100 times higher (around 1016 s−1) and the
wavelength about 100 times smaller (around 200 nm). Practically, we arrive in the
same spectral region as we have already estimated in Sect. 2.4. The wavelength of
200 nm corresponds to UV radiation (Table 2.1), in practice those transitions are
really observed in the UV or in the VIS.

˙r = 0 and Tkin = μ

Let us again identify our two masses with the nuclei in a diatomic molecule.
Once their distance is ﬁxed, we obtain a pure rotation of a rigid molecule as shown
in Fig. 2.9:
Let us assume a moment of inertia I = 2.6*10–47 kgm2. Can we estimate the
rotation angular frequency 	 of such a molecule in a gas that is held at room
temperature (T = 300 K) in a classical manner?
Yes, we can. Let us assume that in equilibrium conditions, Tkin is of the order
of kBT . For our estimation, we set:

That frequency corresponds to the far infrared (FIR).
In conclusion, our estimations have suggested that the discussed degrees of
freedom in atoms or molecules respond in the following spectral regions of
electromagnetic radiation (see Table 2.2).
Core electrons are “closer” to the nucleus than valence electrons and therefore
feel stronger restoring forces. In a classical picture, this may be tackled assuming
substantially larger spring constants κ. According to ω0 =

μ, this will corre-
spond to higher resonance frequencies, deeper in the UV or in the X-ray spectral
region.

As in equilibrium conditions, the distribution of gas particles (let them be
molecules) with respect to their velocities is isotropic, some of them ﬂy in direction
to the light source, and some of them away from the source. Due to the Doppler
effect, a resting observer will detect that the molecules propagating in direction to

the source may absorb at a slightly lower light frequency than those propagating
away from the source. Hence, the molecules differ with respect to the physical
condition essential for the process of light absorption. This is a typical situation
for an inhomogeneous line broadening mechanism.
Inhomogeneous line broadening occurs when many individual narrow spectral
lines with different individual resonance angular frequencies ωi superimpose to
a broader absorption line. This broader structure may also be characterized by
an central absorption angular frequency ω0 and a total FWHM, the latter called
inhomogeneous linewidth (Fig. 2.10). On the contrary, the individual linewidth of
the constituents of that superimposed absorption feature is called the homogeneous
linewidth. Natural line broadening as well as collision broadening may inﬂuence
the homogeneous linewidth. Thus, broadening mechanisms which are common
to all of the oscillators in the ensemble contribute to the homogenous linewidth,
while a spread in physical conditions essential for light–matter interaction of the
individual oscillators results in contributions to the inhomogeneous linewidth.
Doppler broadening is a particular case of inhomogeneous line broadening; in
the case of Doppler broadening, the full absorption line will be composed from a
large number of narrow lines shifted with respect to each other due to the Doppler
effect. This gives rise to a Gaussian resulting lineshape.
Indeed, this particular case may be mathematically treated in an exact manner.
Let us assume that the light wave propagates along the z-axis. Due to Maxwell’s
distribution, the number of molecules with a given z-component of their velocity
is:
N(νz)dνz ∝e−mν2z
2kB T dνz
m is the mass of a molecule, kB Boltzmann’s constant, and T the absolute tem-
perature. Let ω0 be the resonance frequency of the molecule in rest. Due to the

The number of molecules absorbing at ωD is then:

This reveals the probability density distribution for the Doppler-shifted absorp-

distribution is considerably broader than the homogeneous linewidth, it will dom-
inate the absorption lineshape of the assembly, and we ﬁnd a Gaussian spectral

Waves as Particles and Particles

Abstract
Particle and wave properties of traditional particles and electromagnetic waves
are discussed in the context of simple light absorption, emission, and scattering
phenomena. Attention is paid to the propagation of wave packets, including the
introduction of the group velocity as well as pulse broadening phenomena.
3.1
Starting Point
Today, it is commonly accepted that light may exhibit both wave-like and cor-
puscular properties, depending on the concrete experimental conditions. The
corresponding Janus-like construction that combines wave and particle features
is called a photon.
Let us start with a short survey of typical wave and particle parameters. What
we will need in the following is summarized in Table 3.1.
In fact, the debate on the nature of light is very old: Christiaan Huygens may
be regarded as the father of the wave picture of light, while Isaac Newton devel-
oped an early corpuscular theory. Each of them was able to explain certain facets
of the experimentally observed phenomena. Thus, Huygen’s construction led to a
principal understanding of refraction and birefringence phenomena, while his idea
of longitudinal light waves did not allow for introducing the important concept
of light polarization. Newton developed a color theory and introduced the con-
cept of light polarization, assuming the existence of light particles with somewhat
anisotropic internal properties.
Somewhat later, the exploration of light interference phenomena and the devel-
opment of the Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory resulted in a seemingly ﬁnal
victory of the wave concept over the corpuscular approach. But again, new the-
oretical and experimental results required a rethinking on the nature of light. We
will mention three corresponding milestones:

• The spectral behavior of the so-called blackbody irradiation could be theoret-
ically explained when accepting the ad hoc hypothesis that the light energy is
transferred in small portions proportional to the frequency of light [Planck’s
formula—see later Chap. 7)].
• The quantitative exploration of the photoelectric effect also suggested that the
light energy is transferred in corresponding energy portions (Albert Einstein’s
interpretation).
• The experimental results on scattering of X-ray radiation at electrons (Compton
effect) are consistent with the idea that light may behave like a particle with
well-deﬁned energy and momentum.
3.2
Physical Idea
3.2.1
Energy and Momentum of „Light Particles“
The idea of the following treatment is to establish a quantitative correspondence
between the “classical” wave and particle parameters summarized in Table 3.1.
That will allow us to attribute a combination of both wave and particle properties to
traditional waves as well as to traditional particles. From the experimental ﬁndings
mentioned in 3.1, we will start with the assumption that the smallest portions of

3.2

41
energy transferred by light of frequency f are given by:
Ephot = h f = ℏω
(3.1)
Let us call this the energy of a photon. On the other hand, when regarding light
as an assembly of particles propagating with c, they surely have to be regarded as
relativistic particles with a rest mass m = 0. For their total energy, we therefore
make use of the relativistic expression, following from Einsteins theory of special
relativity:
E =

p2c2 + m2c4
(3.2)
Hence for a photon with vanishing rest mass, we have:
Ephot =

p2c2 + m2c4

m=0
= pphotc
(3.3)
With pphot—momentum of a photon. This results in (assuming propagation in
vacuum).
pphot = Ephot
c
= ℏω
c = ℏ2π
λ = h
λ or
pphot = ℏk
(3.4)
Equations (3.1) and (3.4) represent the relations between photon energy and
momentum as particle characteristics with (angular) frequency, wavelength, and
wavevector as typical wave characteristics.
3.2.2
Phase and Group Velocities
When returning to Table 3.1, we recognize that we have not yet spoken about the
concepts of a wave’s phase and group velocities. Instead of a general treatment,
we will illustrate these concepts in terms of a simple example that is more easy to
handle (Example after [1]).
The distinction between group and phase velocities becomes interesting when
light waves with a modulated amplitude are taken into consideration. Note that
this situation is already beyond the phenomena described by our simplest ansatz
(2.1). Instead, we will now focus on a special case of a propagating wave packet.
Consider a wave packet propagating in space along the z-axis without damping.
Let us assume for simplicity that it has a rectangularly shaped Fourier spectrum
centered at k = k0 with the width k (k is the absolute value of the wavevector).
Hence, the wave packet is obtained as a superposition of plane monochromatic

packet may thus be described by the wavefunction:

Let us further assume an arbitrary dispersion law ω = ω(k) (we will identify
the term “dispersion law” with any relationship that establishes a relation between
k and ω). When expanding it into a Taylor’s series, we have:
ω = ω(k0) + (k −k0) dω

In ﬁrst-order dispersion theory, we restrict on the ﬁrst and second terms in the
above written equation. That leads to the simpliﬁed dispersion law:
ω = ω(k0) + (k −k0) dω
dk

k=k0
(3.6)

(3.8)
The obtained expression (3.7) for ψ(z, t) obviously describes a propagating
wave packet, analytically composed from two factors: a term e−i(ω0t−k0z) that cor-
responds to a plane wave propagating along z with the phase ω0t −k0z, and a
term A sin ξ
ξ , which describes a modulation of the wave amplitude. From here we
conclude, that a point of constant phase may propagate with a velocity different
from that of a point of constant amplitude. Indeed, for a point of constant phase
traveling along z, we ﬁnd the phase velocity according to:
ω0t −k0z = const ⇒dz
dt = vph = ω0
k0
(3.9)

3.3
Theoretical Considerations
43
Remark: In practice, points of constant phase cannot be used for signal transfer.
Therefore, it may happen that the phase velocity exceeds c.
On the other hand, a point of constant amplitude corresponds to
ξ = const.
Correspondingly, a point of constant amplitude propagates along the z-axis with
the group velocity deﬁned by:
ξ = const. = k

Note that this expression has been obtained neglecting any damping as well as
any higher order terms in the expansion of the presumed dispersion law (3.6). In
other words: if there is no damping mechanism and no higher order dispersion
term relevant, than any of the points with given amplitude propagates with the
group velocity given by (3.10). That means that all points with given amplitude
propagate with the same velocity. Consequently, in ﬁrst-order dispersion theory, a
given pulse propagates without any distortion of its shape. Once a point of constant
amplitude can be used for signal transfer, it shall never move faster than c.

Theoretical Considerations

Provided that the angular frequency and the wavevector of a light wave are given,
the photon energy and momentum are immediately given by (3.1) and (3.4). The
phase velocity vph ≡

k of a photon propagating in vacuum is then (compare

Moreover, we obtain the group velocity vgr ≡dω

vgr = dω
dk = dEphot

Remark: According to (3.1), the photon energy is unambiguously related to a certain
light frequency. Then, according to Sect. 3.2.1, we have ω = 2π
T = 2π f = 2πc
λ , so
that a given photon energy is also associated with a well-deﬁned vacuum wavelength
or a wavenumber. Thus, Ephot = hcν = hc
λ , while hc ≈1240 eVnm.

into wavelength in nm or wavenumber in cm−1 by the following relations:

One of the most striking features of quantum mechanics is now that wave proper-
ties may also be attributed to typical particles with a rest mass m̸=0. Again, we
assume (3.2):
E =

p2c2 + m2c4
For a resting particle, p = 0, and the above equation results in Einstein’s famous
formula:
E = mc2
Thus, for a resting electron, we have E ≈0.511 MeV, and for a resting proton,
E ≈0.938 GeV.

In the relativistic case however, we have
E2 = p2c2 + m2c4 ⇒2EdE = 2pc2dp ⇒dE
dp = c2 p
E
Let us now attribute a so-called de Broglie wavelength to a propagating particle
according to (compare (3.4) again):
λ = h
p
(3.11)
The corresponding matter wave (or de Broglie wave) is again characterized by
a phase and a group velocity. But these velocities differ from those of a photon.
Keeping in mind the relativistic mass increase, we have:
p2 = m2v2
1 −v2
c2
⇒E2 = p2c2 + m2c4 = m2c4

From here:
p2 = E2 v2
c4 or p = v
c2 E
That gives us the phase velocity:
vph =
ω
k = ℏω
ℏk


p = c2
v > c
And the group velocity:
vgr =
dω
dk = d(ℏω)
d(ℏk)

= dE
dp = c2 p
E = c2 v
c2 = v
We come to the conclusion that a de Broglie wave moves with a group velocity
that exactly coincides with the velocity of the particle—a quite reasonable result.
3.4
Consistency Considerations
We have established relations between energy, momentum, frequency, wavelength,
phase, and group velocities such that particle and wave properties may be ascribed
to photons as well as traditional particles. In particular, the group velocity of
propagating particles coincides with their “usual” velocity, which is a quite encour-
aging result. The phase velocity of propagating relativistic particles turns out to be
larger than c, which does not contradict relativity, because the phase velocity is not
relevant for signal transfer. All in all, so far no inconsistency has been observed.
But what about other wave phenomena? Can particles cause interference and
diffraction pattern? Can they be used in microscopes to produce magniﬁed images
of an object? Yes, they can, as demonstrated by double slit experiments or electron
microscopes. Wave properties of particles are in fact in the basis of all kind of
modern technology today.
Once accelerated electrons may behave like matter waves, they should suffer
diffraction at the atoms of a solid. Figure 3.1 shows the electron diffraction pat-
tern obtained from an amorphous (see later Chap. 17) thin solid ﬁlm. From the
observed diffraction fringes, one may conclude on the interatomic spacing within
the material. A Fourier transformation of the diffraction picture provides access to
the so-called radial distribution function RDF.
Electron diffraction has thus become an important tool in the characterization
of the atomic structure of solid matter.
From here, we make the following primary conclusions:
• Once we have experimental evidence that electrons suffer diffraction, it makes
sense to describe their dynamics in a wave picture. We will develop this picture
starting from Chap. 4.

• The diffraction picture shown in Fig. 3.1 is at the same time a manifestation of a
more fundamental principle that is known as an uncertainty relation. Indeed, in
complete accordance to wave optics, the smaller the interatomic distance in the
ﬁlm is, the larger the radius of the diffraction fringes will be. Thus, a stronger
conﬁnement in the coordinate of the particle will result in a larger scatter of
possible momenta along that direction. Therefore, the coordinates that may
be measured in future become less predictable. That makes it conceptionally
challenging to ascribe a path to a moving quantum particle.

Application to Practical Problems
3.5.1
The Compton Effect
The scattering of an X-ray photon at an electron can be regarded as an elastic
collision event, where total energy and momentum of the photon–electron system
must be preserved. Assuming an X-ray (or γ-photon), which is incident on an
initially resting electron, we ﬁnd from energy conservation:
p1c + mec2 = p2c +

p2ec2 + m2ec4
On the other hand, from momentum conservation, we ﬁnd:
p1 = p2 + pe
Here, pe is the momentum of the electron after collision, and p1 and p2—the
momenta of the photon before and after collision (compare Fig. 3.2).
Momentum conservation results in:
p1 −p2 = pe ⇒p2
e = p2
1 + p2
2 −2p1 p2 cos θ

The scattering angle θ is formed between p1 and p2. Then, from energy
conservation, we ﬁnd:
(p1 −p2)c + mec2 =

p2
1 + p2
2 −2p1 p2 cos θ

From here we obtain:
mec(p1 −p2) = p1 p2(1 −cos θ) or

=

mec(1 −cos θ).
Therefore,
λ2 −λ1 =
h
mec(1 −cos θ) ≡(1 −cos θ)
Thus, the scattering of a photon at the initially resting electron results in a gain
in kinetic energy of the electron. Hence, the photon must have lost energy, which
may be recorded as a smaller frequency or a higher wavelength of the scattered X-
rays. Our simple theory predicts that the wavelength shift depends of the scattering
angle. This predicted behavior may be veriﬁed experimentally and was found to
be in excellent agreement with experimental data. Hence, our assumptions on the
energy and momentum of a photon are consistent with the experimental results

48

from scattering experiments. The so-called Compton wavelength  for scattering
at electrons is given by:
h
mec ≡ ≈2.4 × 10−12 m
Note that the Compton wavelength is explicitly dependent on the mass. If,
instead of an electron, X-ray scattering occurs at a heavier particle with mass m,
the wavelength change becomes smaller by modulus in a reciprocal manner. In the
limiting case of m→∞, we have λ2 →λ1, and we arrive at the result known from
daily experience that incident light may be diffusely scattered by macroscopic
objects without wavelength change (elastic scattering of light at macroscopic
objects).
3.5.2
Absorption of a Photon by an Initially Resting Atom
Let us apply our knowledge to the following situation: Let a resting atom with
mass m absorb a photon with angular frequency ω. As a result of energy conser-
vation, the atom is assumed to be transferred from a state of low internal energy
(let us call this here the ground state) to a state of higher internal energy (let us
call this the excited state). Moreover, as a result of momentum conservation, after
absorption the atom will no more be at rest. The task is to estimate the ratio of
the kinetic energy of the atom after absorption and the photon energy for ω =
1015 s−1 and m = 10−26 kg [3].
In a nonrelativistic approach, it is sufﬁcient to consider nonrelativistic momen-
tum conservation. The momentum of the incident photon must be equal to the
momentum of the atom after absorption, which results in:
ℏω
c = mv ⇒v = ℏω
mc
A simple consistency check reveals that the resulting velocity after absorption
is indeed much smaller than c: v
c = ℏω
mc2 ≈10−10 ≪1 as required. Therefore
Tkin = m
2 v2 = ℏ2ω2
2mc2 ⇒Tkin
ℏω =
ℏω
2mc2 ≈5 × 10−11
In the relativistic calculation, we have to distinguish between the rest masses
of the atom in the ground state (before photon absorption) and in the excited state
(after photon absorption). We set:
m: rest mass of the atom in the ground state
m′: rest mass of the atom atom in the excited state
p: momentum of the atom after absorption of the photon

Let us substitute this into (3.12). We obtain:

ℏω + mc22 = ℏ2ω2 + m

(3.14)
From (3.13), we obtain an expression for the velocity of the atom after
absorption as: v2 = ℏ2ω2

we get:
v2 =

ℏω + mc22 ⇒v =
cℏω
ℏω + mc2
Once ℏω ≪mc2 is certainly fulﬁlled for any light quanta in the visible or
ultraviolet spectral range, we practically arrive at the nonrelativistic result again.
Remark: Note that ℏω ≪mc2 is formally fulﬁlled for any electronic excitation in a
real atom, supposed that the latter is excited but not ionized by resonant absorption
of a photon. Thus, when assuming the Rydberg theory (see later Chap. 8), we have
ℏω ≤Z2Ry for the excitation of a single electron, and mc2 ≈2Zm pc2. Here, Z is
the atomic order, and Ry the Rydberg energy: 1Ry ≈13.6 eV. Then, for any realistic
Z, ℏω ≪mc2 will be fulﬁlled (see Fig. 3.3). Even if we assume the hypothetical case
that the photon absorption results in an instantaneous excitations of all electrons in
the atom, we still have ℏω < Z3Ry ≪mc2 (Fig. 3.3).

3.5.3
Emission of a Photon by an Initially Resting Atom
Let us now regard the opposite process: A resting atom with mass m emits a photon
with angular frequency ω. As a result of momentum conservation, after absorption,
the atom will no more be at rest. Again, let us judge velocity and kinetic energy
of the atom after photon emission.
When using the same symbols as before, we have for the nonrelativistic
situation:
momentum conservation (projection): ⇒ℏω
c + mv = 0 ⇒v = −ℏω

⇒Tkin = m
2 v2 = (ℏω)2

i.e., the same as in the absorption process, except the “–” sign. The relativistic
case yields:

Consequently, we have: v2 =

ℏ2ω2+m2c4 =

3.5.4
Radiation Pressure
Remark: In Sect. 3.5.2 (photon absorption), momentum conservation resulted in
patom after absorption = ℏk = ℏω
c , which means that the momentum of the photon is
completelytransferredtotheatom.Thisdiffersfromwhatwouldbeobservedforback
reﬂection of light from an object. This is obvious from our treatment of the Compton
effect (Sect. 3.5.1). In that case momentum conservation yielded: p1 = p2 + p. In
the case of back reﬂection of light, p1 and p2 have opposite directions. Moreover,
if the object is macroscopic (i.e., has a large mass), λ2 →λ1, such that p1 and p2
must have the same absolute value. Therefore, p1 = −p2 ⇒p = 2p1. Thus, in back
reﬂection, the momentum transfer is twice as effective as in absorption, each back
reﬂected photon transfers a momentum that is twice as large as the incident photon
momentum. The momentum transfer from absorbed or back reﬂected photons gives
rise to the macroscopic phenomenon of radiation pressure.

Let us now assume that a mirror is illuminated (normal incidence) with a light
intensity I = 1500 W/m2. What is the radiation pressure pl applied to the mirror?
In Sect. 3.2.1, we introduced the light intensity as the average amount of light
energy arriving per time interval per unit area. Hence, I =
dE
Adt . The pressure is
pl = F
A . Eliminating A, we have: pl = F Idt
dE .
From Newtons law, we have F = dp
dt , where p is the total momentum trans-
ferred to the mirror. Hence, dp = 2pphotdNphot, while dE = EphotdNphot; Nphot is
the number of photons incident to the mirror. Hence, pl = F Idt
dE
= Idp
dE = 2I pphot
Ephot .
From Ephot
pphot = c we ﬁnally have: pl = 2I pphot
Ephot = 2I
c .
For I = 1500 W/m2, we obtain a radiation pressure of approximately 10−5 Pa,
independent on the light frequency. The obtained radiation pressure is in rough
correspondence to the solar radiation pressure in the earth orbit. If the mirror
would be replaced by an absorber surface, the radiation pressure would be pl =
I pphot
Ephot = I
c for reasons explained in the remark.
3.6
Advanced Material: Wave Packet Distortion
In order to obtain an illustrative picture of the particle-wave dualism, it seems
prospective to understand the wave character of particles in a naïve picture where
the particles are represented by localized wave packets, propagating with a given
group velocity (=particle velocity, as we have already seen). In order to have a
reasonable correspondence between our classical picture of a propagating particle
(which does not change its shape when propagating with a constant speed) and
the mentioned wave packet, a minimum requirement to this wavepacket is that it
also propagates without distortion. As we have seen in 3.2.2, such propagation is
principally possible. The goal of this section is to understand in how far this picture
is self-consistent when being applied to propagating macroscopic and microscopic
particles.
As we have shown in Sect. 3.2.2, in ﬁrst-order dispersion theory and absence
of damping, a wave packet propagates without any distortion of its shape. So let
us return to our special wave packet. In particular, we wrote down an expansion
of the dispersion law ω = ω(k) into a Taylors series according to (3.5):
ω = ω(k0) + (k −k0) dω
dk

k=k0
+ (k −k0)2
2
d2ω
dk2

k=k0
+ · · ·
In order to introduce the concepts of phase and group velocities, we truncated
that series after the linear term (=ﬁrst-order dispersion theory) and obtained (3.6):
ω ≈ω(k0) + (k −k0) dω
dk

k=k0
But the approximation (3.6) makes sense only when the higher order terms in
(3.5) give only marginal contributions. In particular, (3.6) lacks any sense in the

52

case that
(k −k0)2

d2ω


k=k0

is fulﬁlled [1]. At least after this time t, the conclusions obtained from ﬁrst-order
dispersion theory are no more valid. In particular, wave packet distortion will
occur. Let us estimate this characteristic time and call it τ.
Then, if d2ω
dk2

k=k0
̸= 0, wave packet distortion has to be expected after:
τ ≈
4π
 k
2
2 d2ω
dk2

k=k0
Generally, the more localized along the z-axis the wave packet is, the broader
its Fourier spectrum will be. This leads to some kind of uncertainty relation like:
kz ≥2π
(3.15)
Or
pz ≥2πℏ= h
(3.15a)
For the sinc-like wave packet discussed in 3.2.2, localization along the z-
direction corresponds directly to ξ-values conﬁned between −π and +π. Hence,
ξ ≈2π, and at t = 0, we have:
ξ ≈2π ≈k
2 z or kz ≈4π [which is consistent with the mentioned
uncertainty relation (3.15)]. Thus, k can be expressed in terms of the spatial
extension of the wave packet z at t = 0. Hence,
τ ≈
(z)2
π d2ω
dk2

k=k0


p=p0
In a nonrelativistic situation,
E = p2
2m ⇒d2E
dp2 = m ⇒τ ≈2m(z)2
h
(3.16)
This enables us estimating the characteristic time τ. Let us associate the spatial
extension of the wave packet with the characteristic dimension of the propagating
particle. We recognize that the time τ is mass and size dependent: the larger m
and z are, the larger τ will be. Hence, quite different results are expected when
comparing the behavior of “microscopic” and “macroscopic” particles.
For a macroscopic particle with z = 10 cm and m = 1 kg, we ﬁnd τ ≈
3 × 1031 s. Hence, when comparing with the age of the universe (Table 1.1),

3.7
Tasks for Self-check
53
such a wavepacket remains undistorted, i.e., localized at all practically relevant
time scales. The particle can thus be associated with a localized wavepacket that
propagates without distortion with a group velocity that coincides with the usual
particle velocity. Here, our illustrative picture works well.
In the case of a nonrelativistic electron localized in an atom (Table 1.1),
z ≈10−8 cm and m ≈9 × 10−31 kg, wavepacket distortion (In most cases
the wavepacket will simply broaden) is expected within τ ≈1.5 × 10−17 s. Prac-
tically, the wavepacket broadens instantaneously. Such a picture is not consistent
with the mechanical movement of a classical particle, i.e., such a microscopic
particle should not be described as a well localized wave packet associated with
a corpuscular picture. Instead, its wave character must be taken into account
explicitly.
This result is qualitatively consistent with (3.15a). Indeed, the localization (at
t = 0) at a very small z results in a large uncertainty of the momentum, and
therefore our illustrative picture leads to the result, that at t > 0, the position of
the particle can no more accurately be predicted. The only chance we might have
is to indicate a probability to observe the electron in a certain space region. In
the next chapter, we will therefore develop (not derive!) a picture of the particle
dynamics that is based on the solution of a wave equation (the Schrödinger equa-
tion). We will then use that solution (the wavefunction of the electron) to predict
the probability to observe the electron somewhere in space.

calculate:

as the result of a single scattering event. What would be the corresponding

The Schrödinger Equation and Model
System I
Abstract
We introduce the wavefunction of a single-particle quantum system as well as
the corresponding Schrödinger equation. As a ﬁrst model system, we consider
the behavior of a single quantum particle in a potential box with inﬁnitely high
potential walls. The results are used to introduce the concept of densities of
states.
4.1
Starting Point
In the previous chapter, we came to the conclusion that it should be reasonable to
ascribe wave properties to typical microscopic particles—such as electrons.
In a conventional particle picture (if we associate the electron with a point
particle), the electrons position at a given time would be completely deﬁned by a
single vector r = r(t), the time dependence being deﬁned by Newtons equation
of motion. In Chap. 2, we used that concept for developing a classical theory of
light–matter interactions, where the actual positions of the electrons deﬁned the
actual values of the (induced) oscillating dipole moments.
A wave picture is something essentially different. A wave is more or less a
delocalized phenomenon; typical wave features appear to be smeared over the
space. Therefore, instead of ascribing a single radius vector to the electron, a new
concept has to be introduced—the wavefunction . The wavefunction of a single
electron depends on the electrons coordinates and the time, so we write  = (r,
t). Clearly, its evolution with time can no more be described by Newton’s law. So
what we need is a new equation that describes the time evolution of . This wave
equation is called the Schrödingers equation. How such a wave equation could
look like?

Physical Idea
In order to illustrate the structure of Schrödingers equation, let us regard a plane
wave (without any amplitude modulation) propagating along the x-axis according
to:
(x, t) ∝e−i(ωt−kx)
(4.1)
This delocalized plane wave propagating in free space will further be associ-
ated with the wavefunction of a single freely propagating particle, i.e., a particle
propagating in a potential that is zero in any point x. In view of our discussion
from Chap. 3, we further make use of the relations
E = ℏω
and
p = ℏk.
Let us start by differentiating the wavefunction (4.1). Then we obviously ﬁnd:
∂
∂t (x, t) = −iω(x, t) = −i E
ℏ(x, t)
∂
∂x (x, t) = ik(x, t) = i p
ℏ(x, t)
When acting on such a wavefunction , the operation iℏ∂
∂t “extracts” the par-
ticle energy from the wavefunction, while −iℏ∂
∂x “extracts” the x-component of
a particle momentum (in a 3D case, the momentum vector will be associated
with −iℏ∇). Then, for a freely propagating nonrelativistic particle (neglecting rest
mass contributions, which provide a constant offset only), replacing energy and
momentum by the mentioned differential operations leads to:
E = Tkin ⇒E = p2

Theoretical Considerations
57
We will now proceed by postulating the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation of
a single particle in an arbitrary potential U(r). We proceed in exactly the same
manner as with the free particle, but instead of E = Tkin, we now write E =
Tkin + U(r). That leads to:
E = p2


(r, t) = ˆH(r, t)
(4.2)
This is the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation for a single particle in the poten-
tial U(r) (in the following, we will use the terminology that this particle and the
corresponding potential form a quantum system). The term ˆH =

−ℏ2
2m  + U(r)

is called the Hamilton operator or Hamiltonian ˆH of the quantum system. Solving
(4.2) shall supply the wavefunction (r, t), but it should be noted that there may
be several wavefunctions that sufﬁce (4.2). The idea is now to associate the set
of wavefunctions which sufﬁce (4.2) with the set of all possible physical states of
the quantum system. Note that (4.2) is a linear differential equation, such that the
superposition principle is valid. If any two wavefunctions 1(r, t) and 2(r, t) are
solutions of (4.2), then any linear superposition of them also describes a possible
physical state.

In the classical particle picture, the energy of the nonrelativistic particle would
then be given by
E = Tkin + U = m

Let us regard the energy as a function of the particles coordinates, momenta,
and time. We then obtain:
E = Tkin + U = p2

way a conclusion from more general symmetry considerations, as formulated in
the Noether theorems.
What we are now doing is to combine our knowledge on the particle and wave
approaches. Let us search special solutions of (4.2) according to:

with a freely propagating particle. When setting const/ℏ= ω, from ℏω = E, we
ﬁnd const = E. This is in complete agreement with the above-mentioned classical
considerations, provided that we associate the constant in (4.3b) with the energy
E of the system again. Note that this is rather a postulate, our arguments can by
no means be accepted as a strong derivation. But at least for classical objects, this
interpretation makes sense; on the other hand, there is no rigorous criterion which
would forbid applying (4.2) to a classical (vulgo “macroscopic”) material system
and allow it for a quantum mechanical (vulgo “microscopic”) one. Moreover, what
we have postulated here in an ad hoc manner is consistent with a more general
formulation of basic postulates in quantum mechanics, and we will return to this
question in Chap. 5. At the moment, let us ﬁx the conclusion that if the Hamil-
tonian of the system is not explicitly time-dependent, wavefunctions described
by (4.3) correspond to physical states with a constant energy. How large is that
energy?
Let us mention that from (4.3b), we get two equations:
iℏ˙f −E f = 0 ⇒f = e−i E
ℏt
ˆHψ = Eψ
(4.4)
While the ﬁrst equation immediately leads us to the function f, the second
equation (the time-independent Schrödinger equation) poses an eigenvalue prob-
lem with solutions (further numbered by the index n) that are speciﬁc to the chosen
potential U(x). Having solved that eigenvalue problem, we obtain a set of energies
{E n} that are consistent with the Schrödinger equation, while the wavefunctions
of the system (which describe its eigenstates) are given by:
n(r, t) = e−i En
ℏtψn(r) if ∂U
∂t = 0
(4.4a)
A quantum state as given by (4.4a) is called a stationary quantum state. It is
characterized by a ﬁxed energy value. The set of eigenvalues {En} will further be
associated with the set of “allowed” energy levels of the quantum system.
Note that because of the linearity of (4.2), linear superpositions of different
wavefunctions according to (4.4a) will also describe possible physical states of the
system.

is quite a reasonable result. In this case, the energy coincides with the kinetic

ℏte±ikx which is nothing else than the initially assumed plane
wave propagating along the x-axis.
For completeness, Table 4.1 shows the corresponding solutions for the time-
independent Schrödinger equation when assuming a constant potential U0. Note
that we obtain a continuous spectrum of eigenvalues E in this case.
4.3.3
Model System I: Particle in a Box
In order to get a feeling on the mathematical apparatus which is hidden behind
the equations written down in Sect. 4.3.1, let us regard a simplest case, namely
the one-dimensional movement of a quantum particle in a box with inﬁnitely high
potential walls. We assume the time-independent Schrödinger equation according
to:
ˆHψ = Eψ;
ˆH = −ℏ2
2m
d2
dx2 + U(x)
U = 0 ;
0 ≤x ≤L
U →∞;
x < 0 or x > L
We will start with the reasonable assumption that behind the inﬁnitely high
walls, the wavefunction must be zero (compare Table 4.1, red-marked ﬁeld with
U0 →∞). Although we have not yet discussed the sense of the introduced
wavefunction (this will be done in Chap. 5), let us postulate that whenever the
wavefunction is zero in a certain space region, the particle cannot be observed

4.3

61
there. Indeed, in a 3D situation, the term
dw = ∗dxdydz = ∗dV
(4.6)
may be associated with the probability to observe the particle in the volume
element dV. This is the essence of Max Born’s statistical interpretation of the
wavefunction (Born’s rule). Then, the term ∗ is the corresponding probability
density. Once the probability to observe the particle elsewhere in the volume V
occupied by the system must be equal to 1, we ﬁnd the normalization rule:

V
∗dV = 1
(4.6a)
So our assumption means that the captured particle may never be observed
behind the inﬁnitely high (und therefore impermeable) potential walls. We will
also assume that the wavefunction is continuous. Then we should use the boundary
conditions:
ψ(0) = ψ(L) = 0.
Within the box, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is:
−ℏ2
2m
d2
dx2 ψ(x) = Eψ(x); 0 ≤x ≤L
Let us search the solution as ψ(x) ∝sin kx. In order to have the boundary
conditions fulﬁlled, we must require:
sin kL = 0 ⇒kL = nπ; n = 0, 1, 2, . . . Hence, we get a set of wavefunctions
numbered by n:ψ(x) = ψn(x) ∝sin nπ
L x.
Note that for n = 0, the wavefunction is identical to zero. In terms of (4.6) that
means, that the probability density to ﬁnd the particle anywhere in the box is zero,
which corresponds to an empty box without any particle inside. In this connection,
n is called a quantum number. Consequently, we obtain a set of allowed k-values
such that k = kn = nπ
L holds. On the other hand, we have kn = nπ
L = 2π
λn ⇒λn =
2L
n , so that the associated eigenfunctions ψn(x) represent nothing else than the set
of possible standing wave modes within the box (Fig. 4.1).

Fig.4.1 Eigenfunctions of the particle in the box, see (4.7a)
In contrast to what has been obtained in Sect. 4.3.2 for a freely propagating
particle, we now ﬁnd a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues En. Note that the thus
allowed energy values and their separation become larger when the length of the
box L becomes smaller.
There is a simple mnemonic trick for quick reproduction of (4.7) with-
out memorizing. Once inside the box, the potential energy is zero, the
energy is purely kinetic, i.e., En =
p2
n
2m . But pn = ±ℏkn = ± h
λn . From
λn = 2L
n (nevertheless you must memorize Fig. 4.1), we have p2
n = h2n2
4L2
and therefore E = En =
h2
8mL2 n2. Note that as a rule, we derive from here
that the larger the spatial extension of a quantum system is, the smaller the
kinetic ground-state energy tends to be.
Remark For reasons which will become clear later, we do not consider negative
quantum numbers n. Also, in the 1D case discussed here, instead of (4.6a), it makes
sense to normalize the wavefunctions according to:
 L
0 ψ2
n(x)dx = 1 ∀n. This
requirement leads to the normalized ﬁnal wavefunctions:

Consistency Considerations
I suppose that you, dear reader, are now feeling some frustration, because so far
in this chapter, practically nothing was sophistically derived, but everything was
rather postulated or illustrated in terms of analogies. This is indeed true, because
such a general concept like expressed by Schrödingers equation cannot be derived
in a mathematically strong manner.
In this section, let us nevertheless shortly discuss the consistency of the results
from Sects. 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 with the wave packet picture developed in Chap. 3,
and the resulting preliminary formulation of the uncertainty relation (3.15).
Clearly, the solution (4.5) of the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a
free particle (Sect. 4.3.2) sufﬁces the uncertainty relation (3.15), because the ﬁxed
k-value corresponds to complete delocalization of the particles wavefunction in
space. But once the Schrödinger equation (4.2) is linear, the superposition princi-
ple holds, and therefore, linear superpositions of solutions like (4.1) also represent
physically possible states of the particle. This way we can construct wavepack-
ets like introduced in Sect. 3.2.2, and according to (3.15), the resulting variance
in k-values now allows for certain localization of the particles wavefunction in
space. But according to (3.16), this localization may be destroyed as a result of
wave packet broadening as discussed in Sect. 3.6: For small particles with a small
mass, in free space, the wave packet broadens practically instantaneously. Thus
localization in free space is quickly lost.
Therefore, in order to keep the wavefunction of a quantum particle localized,
the latter should interact “with somewhat.” As an example, in Sect. 3.3.3, we
introduced what we called a box potential and thus introduced localization of the
quantum particle within the length of the box. On the other hand, the momentum
of the quantum particle is now no more ﬁxed; we may observe it moving to the
left as well as moving to the right. This leads to a certain variance in the momen-
tum, and as it will be shown later in task 5.7.7, the variances in coordinate and
momentum together are again consistent with the uncertainty relation. So all in
all, the considerations from Chap. 3 are consistent with what we have obtained so
far from the Schrödinger equation in this chapter.

The Schrödinger Equation and Model System I
But more generally, let us emphasize that Schrödingers equation has proven
correct because it gives accurate and correct predictions of what goes on in nature.
Or alternatively, of what can be observed or measured. That depends on the partic-
ular interpretation of quantum mechanics, and this is still a topic of debates. You,
dear reader, have now two basic choices. You can—as many physicists do quite
successfully—accept the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics as an out-
standingly reliable recipe for rigorous quantitative treatment of all phenomena we
will discuss throughout this book. And you can, in addition to becoming famil-
iar with the mathematical apparatus—try to develop your idea on what quantum
mechanics is about, i.e., what are the “objects” investigated by quantum mechanics,
and what can be learned about them by performing quantum mechanical calcula-
tions. And ﬁnally, on what quantum mechanics tells us about nature. In this case,
you have to go deeper into the existing quantum theories (there are several of
them), but this will not be topic of this book. Why? The answer is simple: Such
books exist, but in Sect. 5.1, some extra recommendations on further reading will
be provided.
Thus, instead of a formal consistency consideration, I would it like to refer to
the outstanding performance of quantum mechanics in making quantitative predic-
tions here. The following practical problems provide at least some examples for
that.
4.5
Application to Practical Problems
4.5.1
Size Effects
A trivial example of the application of the theory developed so far is in the use of
quantum conﬁnement for designing material systems with tailored frequencies of
optical transitions. Indeed, let us assume that the energy gap between two adjacent
energy levels in (4.7) or (4.8) may be bridged by absorption or emission of a single
light quantum (photon). Such a situation is sketched in Fig. 4.2. A more detailed
treatment of this situation is topic of Chap. 6, but our knowledge developed so far
is sufﬁcient to build at least a qualitative picture. According to Fig. 4.2, if a photon
initiates a light absorption process between the levels n and n + 1, as a result of
energy conservation, we assume its angular frequency according to:
ℏω = En+1 −En = ℏ2π2
2mL2


⇒ω = ℏπ2
2mL2 (2n + 1) = 2πc
λ
(4.9)
Obviously, the absorption (or emission) frequency may be tuned by the choice
of a suitable length L. In technological practice, the usual situation is that an
electron is conﬁned in a nanometer-sized crystal (a “nanocrystal”) that we call a
quantum dot. In fact, the potential inside the dot is not really constant. Instead, the

electrons “feel” the periodic potential of the atomic cores that build the crystal.
Therefore, (4.9) provides a very crude estimation only, but it nevertheless demon-
strates that by changing the box length in the sub-nanometer range, the wavelength
may be tuned over quite a broad spectral range.
4.5.2
Color Centers in Ionic Crystals
Crystals are characterized by a nearly perfect periodic arrangement of their atoms,
which we call a crystalline lattice. In solid crystals built from positively and neg-
atively charged ions (such as for example LiF, NaCl or KCl), electrons may be
trapped in a vacancy defect formed by a vacant halogen atom. The void left by
the vacancy acts as a 3D potential box, with a spatial extension deﬁned by the
lattice period a. An electron conﬁned in that box forms what is called a color cen-
ter; the name arises from its characteristic light absorption in the VIS. Although
the potential within the box is surely not constant (the electrons will preferably
be found in the vicinity of the positive ions), the absorption wavelength should
depend on the lattice period a in the crystal in a qualitative manner as described
by (4.9) (Fig. 4.3).
Such a dependence is experimentally observed, while the wavelength at
maximum absorption λmax satisﬁes the relation:
λmax = const ∗a2. From the experiment, the constant turns out to be equal to:
const = 6 ∗1012 m−1
(compare [1]).

Note that the corresponding proportionality constant as predicted from (4.9) is
approximately 4mec
3ℏπ ≈1.2 ∗1012 m−1 and therefore, regardless on the crudeness
of the model, still of the correct order of magnitude.
4.5.3
Organic Chain Molecules with Conjugated Double Bonds
Let us regard a hydrocarbon chain molecule built according to the recipe:
... −C = C −C = C −C = ...
from a total of N atoms. The so-called π-electrons which are responsible for the
double bounds are delocalized, i.e., rather mobile within the molecule, so that
the mentioned chain may be modeled as a 1D potential box with approximately
N electrons captured. The length of the box corresponds to (N −1) times the
distance between two adjacent C-atoms, which is approximately L0 = 0.14 nm,
multiplied with a phenomenological correction factor C, which takes the nonlinear
geometry of the real molecule into account.
We are now confronted with the new circumstance, that there is not only one
electron trapped in the assumed box. Instead, we have N electrons (for simplicity,
let that number be even). We have not yet introduced Paulis exclusion principle
(see later Sect. 9.3.1) and therefore just postulate, that each of the energy levels
may be populated by a maximum of two electrons (with different spin orientations,
see later Sect. 8.6.1). Hence, the energy levels up to n = N/2 are expected to be

populated, and absorption from the highest occupied quantum state to the lowest
unoccupied quantum state will correspond to excitations from the energy level n =
N/2 to n = N/2 + 1. In molecular spectroscopy, it is common to call this transition
the HOMO–LUMO transition, where HOMO means “Highest Occupied Molecular
Orbital” and LUMO “Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital” (Fig. 4.4).
Then, when neglecting any interaction between the π-electrons, from (4.9), we
ﬁnd
λ =
4mec(N −1)2L2

ℏπ(N + 1)
For a long chain (N is large), that gives

as an estimation for the wavelength that corresponds to the HOMO–LUMO
transition, we obtain:

So the estimated wavelength becomes:
λ ≈65 nmNC2
Already for C = 1, we ﬁnd that an increasing chain length (increased N) is
accompanied by an increase in the absorption wavelength, which is the quantitative
expression of an empirical rule in organic dye chemistry [2]. With a moderate chain

which explains the beautifully colored appearance of our biological environment

Densities of States
Let us now assume that we deal with a cubic 3D box with Lx = Ly = Lz ≡L.
Let us further assume, that L →∞, so we turn to macroscopic systems. Then,
according to (4.8) or (4.9), the energy levels will practically form a continuum of
allowed energy values, because the spacing between different allowed energy val-
ues becomes close to zero. That allows us introducing a function called the density
of states, i.e., the number of quantum states (described by the eigenfunctions of ˆH)
with energies that fall into a given energy interval. In our 3D example, quantum
states are deﬁned by given values of the quantum numbers nx, ny, and nz.

Note that the thus deﬁned value n is not a quantum number.
Let us now calculate the number of states that fall into a given n-interval. Each
state corresponds to a certain triple of nx, ny, and nz and therefore occupies a cube
of the volume 1 in the n-space [3] (see Fig. 4.6).
In particular, the ﬁgure visualizes the n-space occupied by the states corre-
sponding to n-values between zero and a given maximum value of n. The volume
of the sphere with the radius n in the ﬁgure corresponds to the full number of
states, however, due to the circumstance that nx, ny, and nz shall not be negative,
we should only count the states in the ﬁrst octant. Hence, we ﬁnd for the full
number of states Z:
Z = 1

We therefore have for the full number of quantum states Z:

dn ≡D(n) represents the full number of quantum states per n-

Remark We will introduce the terminus degeneration later in Sect. 5.3.3. Never-
theless, it is worth mentioning already here that in reality, even when nx, ny, and
nz are speciﬁed, more than one physically different quantum state may be possible.
In such a situation, we will say that the quantum state speciﬁed by nx, ny, and nz
is degenerated. In our case, if we speak on electrons as the quantum particles con-
ﬁned in the box potential, each state deﬁned by nx, ny, and nz may be populated
with two electrons which are in different states with respect to their spin orienta-
tion (compare Sect. 4.5.3). The electron spin will be introduced later in Chap. 8. In
(4.12)–(4.17), degeneration may be taken into account by multiplying with an addi-
tional degeneration factor g. In the case of electron spin degeneration, that factor is
g = 2.
4.6.2
Quantum Tunneling
Let us now come to a typical quantum effect that has no classical analog, namely
quantum tunneling through a barrier. Again we will restrict ourselves to the 1D
case. For the present model calculation, we choose a rectangular potential given
by:
x < 0 and x > a : U = 0
0 ≤x ≤a : U = U0 = const
According to Table 4.1, we use the following ansatz for the particles wavefunc-
tion:
x < 0 : U = 0 : ψ1(x) = Aeiαx + Be−iαx; α =
√
2mE
ℏ
0 ≤x ≤a : U = U0 : ψ2(x)
= Ceβx + De−βx; β =
√2m(U0 −E)
ℏ
x > a : U = 0 : ψ3(x) = Aξeiαx; α =
√
2mE
ℏ
Here, we supposed that the particle arrives from negative x-values and moves
toward positive x-values. We naturally expect that the barrier may cause reﬂection
of the particle, hence at x < 0, we consider both forward and back traveling waves.
Once the particle has “penetrated” the wall, it may move further into the positive
x-direction and will never come back. Hence, for x > a, no back traveling wave will
be considered. Obviously, ξ may be understood as the ratio of the amplitudes of
the forward-traveling part of the wavefunctions behind and in front of the barrier.
Note further that we will assume E < U0. In classical physics, in this case, a
particle with energy E would not be able to pass the barrier. However, in quantum

72
4
The Schrödinger Equation and Model System I
physics, it turns out that there is a possibility to observe the particle behind the
wall.
Once the potential is zero on both sides of the barrier, we deﬁne the
transmission coefﬁcient T through:
T = |ξ|2
In order to ﬁnd ξ, we have to consider the boundary conditions of the
wavefunctions at x = 0 and x = a.
When requiring continuity of the wavefunction and its ﬁrst derivative, we obtain
at x = 0:
ψ1(0) = ψ2(0) ⇒A + B = C + D

dx ψ1(x)

x=0

⇒iα(A −B) = β(C −D)
Remark The requirement on the continuity of the ﬁrst derivative of the wavefunction
is consistent to the requirement that the so-called probability current density should
be continuous (it is even constant in a situation like here). The probability current
density is dominated by terms like ψ dψ∗
dx . For continuity of this term, it is sufﬁcient
that both ψ and dψ
dx are continuous. Note that if ψ = 0, continuity of dψ
dx does not
matter (compare Sect. 4.3.3).
The probability current density will be introduced in Sect. 5.3.1. Therefore, dear
reader, for the moment you are asked to accept the above-mentioned boundary
conditions as a mathematical model.

Obviously, even with particle energies E ≪U0, the transmission coefﬁcient is
different from zero. Hence, the wavefunction of the particle is different from zero
at both sides of the barrier. So we have a chance to observe the particle at the
other side of the wall, which is the essence of quantum tunneling. For macro-
scopic objects, with the mass of a soccer ball, the transmission coefﬁcient will be
vanishingly small, such that please do not expect to observe the situation visualized
in Fig. 4.7 on a real soccer ﬁeld.

Model Potential for Describing the α-decay in Nuclear
Physics
The α-decay, i.e., the emission of α-particles by radioactive nuclei, cannot be
understood in terms of classical physics. Natural radioactive materials emit α-
particles with energies in the range of some MeV, with half-life times varying
between 10−5 s and 1011 years. There is no classical model that allows reproducing
that dynamic range of decay times.
On the contrary, the process has early been successfully modeled in terms of a
model potential, which combines features of the particle-in-a-box potential and a
repulsive Coulombs potential according to
U(r) =

Here, 2e is the electric charge of an α-particle (it is a helium nucleus composed
from two protons and two neutrons), and Z the atomic order (=number of protons

in the nucleus) after emission of the α-particle. The assumption was that prior to
its emission, the α-particle can be modeled as being conﬁned in a potential box
with the radius of the nucleus r0 (see Fig. 4.8 on left), with a potential wall of
ﬁnite height. This box potential is to model the attractive action of the nuclear
forces. The latter are only efﬁcient at shortest distances, of the order of r0. Out-
side the nucleus, the α-particle only feels the repulsive Coulomb potential of the
nucleus. As seen in the ﬁgure, the superposition of these model potentials deﬁnes a
potential barrier of ﬁnite height. But in this case, there is no reason to assume that
the wavefunction of the α-particle is zero outside the nucleus. Instead, one would
expect then within the barrier, the wavefunction is damped with increasing distance
from the nucleus as long as the energy of the α-particleE < U(r) =

tial. On right: simpliﬁed model with rectangular potential barrier [4, p. 858]
holds (compare Table 4.1 and Sect. 4.6.2). At a certain distance from the nucleus,
we ﬁnd E > U(r), and the wavefunction would correspond to that of a propa-
gating particle. At r →∞, we have U →0, and the particles wavefunction should
approach that of a freely propagating particle with kinetic energy E (Fig. 4.8 on
left). Thus, there is a chance that the α-particle may be found outside the nucleus,
which means that an α-particle has been emitted.
As we have seen in Sect. 4.6.2, a higher and/or broader potential barrier should
result in a smaller tunneling probability—in our example to a larger decay time.
But as it is illustrated in the ﬁgure, the effective barrier height and width deff
depend on the particles energy. So that a higher kinetic energy of the α-particle
after decay should correspond to a smaller decay time. This dependence can be
measured, and the results on measurements of the characteristic decay time of dif-
ferent radioactive elements and the kinetic energy of the corresponding α-particles
were in best agreement to calculations performed on the basis of such a model
potential (Georg Gamow 1928).
Let us estimate such a decay time in terms of a simpliﬁed model, namely a 1D
rectangular potential barrier (Fig. 4.8 on right). We choose the model potential:
U(x) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
∞; x < 0
0; 0 ≤x ≤L and x > L + d
U0; L < x ≤L + d
where L corresponds to r0. Let us perform an estimation of the decay time of the
α-decay process, assuming L = 10−12 cm; d = 2*10−12 cm; U0 = 22 MeV, while
the kinetic energy E of the α-particle is 2 MeV.
The following treatment cannot be considered as a stringent quantum mechani-
cal approach; instead, it is rather an illustrative classical picture that makes use of
a transmission coefﬁcient estimated in terms of the concept of quantum tunneling.
First of all, let us estimate the tunneling probability through the rectangular barrier

⇒T ≈1.32 ∗e−78.5 ≈1 ∗10−34
Let us now assume that the emission of the α-particle may be understood as
the result of the tunneling of an α-particle through said barrier. If before tunneling,
the α-particle is conﬁned in the box potential between x = 0 and x = L, then it
propagates between the walls of the box with a velocity v =

the time span t between two bounces on the barrier is
t = 2L
v ≈3 ∗10−21s
.
Per bounce the escaping probability is T. From the rate equation valid for a
large number N of emitters dN
dt = −1
t T N, we ﬁnd that the decay time τ is
τ = t
T ≈8.3 ∗1013s ≈9.5 ∗105 years
The half-life time is equal to τ ln 2 ≈6.58∗105 years. Note that the transmission
coefﬁcient T is extremely sensitive to d, which, in practice, is related to the radius
of the nucleus. Smallest variation in d or E cause tremendous changes in T, and
therefore, half-live times of real nuclei vary between submilliseconds up to more
than 1011 years [5]. This dynamic range of half-life times is absolutely impossible
to be reproduced in terms of classical physics.
Note further that the exponent in (4.18) results in drastic changes of the trans-
mission coefﬁcient, when small changes in U0, E, d, or m occur. Thus, it has been
shown that for the hypothetical emission of single protons, with realistic param-
eters of the potential wall, one would obtain decay times less than 10−12 s. That
means that such a decay process would occur practically instantaneously and not
on the time scales typically observed for radioactivity.
Note ﬁnally that the idea of an α-particle propagating through the nucleus and
frequently bouncing on the barrier walls is of course a model idealization; in fact,
there is no α-particle migrating through the nucleus prior to its emission. The good
reproduction of the characteristic half-times by this model is the more astonishing.

Operators in Quantum Mechanics
and Model System II
Abstract
We introduce basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Thereby, the focus is
placed on the introduction of skills that are necessary for our further discus-
sion of light–matter interaction phenomena. As a second model system, the
harmonic oscillator is discussed in terms of Heisenbergs matrix method as well
as in terms of ladder operators. The results are used to illustrate the idea of
electromagnetic ﬁeld quantization.
5.1
Starting Point
What comes now is a chapter crammed with rather abstract mathematical expres-
sions, which will be introduced in order to provide the necessary tools for a
quantitative description of the material systems which are in the focus of this
book. Whenever you, dear reader, will ﬁnd it boring or tedious to familiarize with
the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics, please remember that this is a
theory that allows predicting experimental results (among them those concerning
the interaction of light with matter) with an accuracy that has never been observed
before. This alone makes it worth for every student of photonics obtaining at least
basic skills in quantum mechanical calculations.
But what quantum mechanics is about? Newtonian mechanics allow predicting
the dynamic behavior of systems of point masses, so we know that it is about
systems of point masses. On the contrary, the Schrödingers equation allows cal-
culating a wavefunction, and knowledge of this wavefunction will enable us to
predict certain properties of the system that is in a physical state described by this
wavefunction. But what is the wavefunction? And has quantum mechanics to be
regarded as a theory on wavefunctions?
Once the physical meaning of the complex wavefunction itself is not so obvi-
ous, it might seem unsatisfactory to deﬁne quantum mechanics as a theory on

wavefunctions only. In fact, as a result of this “uncertainty,” it is not only one
unique quantum theory that has been developed in the past; in fact at present,
there are several competing quantum theories [1, pp. 31–45]. A common feature
of them is that all they describe most fundamental building units of matter, such
as atoms or electrons, as well as electromagnetic radiation, in excellent agreement
with experimental ﬁndings. But therefore, no experiment available today can ver-
ify the correct one or falsify the others, because all these theories provide (at least
almost) identical predictions on the result of an experiment.
Let us mention some of these competing quantum theories:
• The orthodox Copenhagen school
• The de Broglie—Bohmian theory
• Collaps theories
• Many-world theories
• And, of course, several others…
I am physicist by education, so that during my studies, I had to listen to a regu-
lar one-year (30 weeks) course of quantum mechanics based on the Copenhagen
school, consisting of two lectures and one seminar per week. I still remember how
fascinated I was about the obtained recipes for exactly calculating optical spec-
tra of atoms, molecules, and solids. Nevertheless I am honest enough to disclose
that it became not ﬁnally clear to me, what quantum mechanics is basically about
(wavefunctions? waves?, particles?, something hybrid?). At the end of the course,
I had arrived at the conclusion that quantum mechanics (=wave mechanics) is a
theory on all microscopic objects that do never move along a deﬁnite path. It is
also characteristic that in orthodox quantum mechanics, the concept of the observ-
able (something that may be observed) has a key function. Note that John Stuart
Bell later opposed the concept of the Beable (something that may exist) to that
observable concept.
Among the books I read on the Copenhagen version of quantum mechanics, I
would it like to recommend the books written by Landau and Lifshitz as well as
that by Bartelmann et al. to the reader (see Sect. 5.8.1).
The de Broglie–Bohmian theory is a nonrelativistic quantum theory of point
particles. In this quantum theory (and in contrast to the Copenhagen school), par-
ticles do have well-deﬁned coordinates and paths. Here, the point particles are the
“Beables,” while the Schrödinger equation is necessary to provide a wavefunc-
tion that acts as a “pilot wave” guiding the movement of the particle. Thus, the
Schrödinger equation is in the basis of both the orthodox and the de Broglie–
Bohmian formulations of quantum mechanics. Therefore, their predictions are the
same (in the nonrelativistic case).
In collaps theories, the Schrödinger equation is modiﬁed; it contains stochas-
tic nonlinear terms. In fact there are a couple of different collaps theories with
different fundamental “Beables.” We note here that the mentioned modiﬁcations
of the Schrödinger equation result in small differences between the predictions
of collaps theories and the previously mentioned orthodox or de Broglie–Bohmian

approaches. When sufﬁciently accurate experiments will be available, a veriﬁcation
or falsiﬁcation of the collaps theories should therefore be possible.
In many-world theories, a rather universal wavefunction of the whole universe
is the basic object of investigations. It is again the typical linear Schrödinger equa-
tion that describes the evolution of that universal wavefunction, and therefore, the
predictions will again be the same.
For our practical purposes, the important point is that all these theories make
almost identical quantitative predictions when being applied to concrete problems.
We will therefore focus our attention to those elements of their mathematical
apparatus, which are common to all these theories, namely the solution of the
Schrödinger equation (which supplies the wavefunction) and the way how to cal-
culate the system properties when the wavefunction is known. But we will not
introduce the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics in the formal man-
ner as it is done in every standard textbook for students of physical disciplines;
instead, we will restrict on the introduction of a minimum of concepts necessary
for our narrow purposes.
As a consequence, the presentation of the material will not adhere to any of
the standard textbooks. This may be unsatisfactory for ongoing physicists, but this
textbook does not provide a course on quantum mechanics for physicists. And
why should I do so? There are enough excellent textbooks on quantum mechanics.
The basic material presented in this chapter can already be found in rather old-
fashioned textbooks like those written by Landau and Lifshitz, or by Davydov. But
I also would like to recommend three more books for further reading:
• J. Bricmont: Quantum sense and nonsense. Read it if you want to know what
quantum mechanics is about, practically without referring to mathematics
• S. Flügge: Practical quantum mechanics. Read it if you want to learn solving
practical problems
• M. Haug, S.W.Koch, Quantum Theory of the Optical and Electronic Proper-
ties of Semiconductors, (World Scientiﬁc Singapure, 1990). I recommend it
to everybody who wants to get a deeper insight into the quantum picture of
light–matter interactions.
The starting point for our following treatment is:
Schrödinger Equation (4.2): Let us regard a simple quantum system (a single-
particle propagating in the potential U) which is described by the Hamiltonian ˆH.
Let (r, t) be the solution of the corresponding Schrödinger equation:
iℏ∂
∂t (r, t) =

−ℏ2
2m  + U(r)

(r, t) ≡ˆH(r, t)
We will assume that (r, t), which describes a certain quantum state of the sys-
tem, contains valuable information about the dynamics of the considered quantum
system.

Born’s rule (4.6): In a 3D situation (r =
⎛
⎝
x
y
z
⎞
⎠), the term
dw = ∗dxdydz = ∗dV
is the probability to observe the single particle in the volume element dV.
We will be working exclusively in the so-called coordinate representation, i.e.,
all functions will depend on the coordinates that describe the system conﬁguration
in space. Through (4.6), the wavefunction in coordinate representation gives a
direct idea on the space region where we have a real chance to observe the quantum
particle, and we will call that space region an orbital.
5.2
Physical Idea
If we accept the idea that
• a certain physical state of a quantum system is characterized by a certain
wavefunction, and
• that wavefunction contains valuable information about the quantum system in
that state,
it should be the task to develop a recipe on how to extract that information from
the wavefunction. However, the wavefunction obtained from solving (4.2) does not
provide knowledge on the exact coordinates of the particle (except the wavefunc-
tion is a δ-function). So, the result of a measurement of a coordinate cannot be
exactly predicted, but according to (4.6), we can indicate a statistical probability
to ﬁnd the particle in a certain volume element. It is therefore reasonable assum-
ing that the information about other system characteristics may have a statistical
character as well.
If so, we can become confronted with two situations:
i. In a given quantum state, it may happen that a single measurement of a certain
characteristic gives a well-predictable unambiguous measurement result.
ii. In a given quantum state, it may happen that a single measurement of a certain
characteristic has an unpredictable result. That means, that different measure-
ment results are possible, but as a result of the Born’s rule, each of them will
be observed with a well-deﬁned probability.
If you, dear reader, ﬁnd this somewhat irritating, then maybe a classical anal-
ogy provides a helpful illustration: Imagine the case of free oscillations of
a classical (nonrelativistic) 1D harmonic oscillator (e.g., a mass on a spring

with a small oscillation amplitude). Its kinetic and potential energies sum up
to its total mechanical energy, which is constant in the case that there is no
damping. Thus, we have:
E = const = Tkin + U = m
2 ˙x2 + m
2 ω2
0x2 = m
2

˙x2 + ω2
0x2	
(5.1)
Let us assume now that we have no indication on the actual value of x. Then,
we cannot predict the actual values of U and Tkin (as corresponding to situ-
ation ii). But nevertheless, we surely know the value of E (as corresponding
to situation i), which does not depend on the actual value of x.
In this chapter, we will now turn to the development of a mathematical recipe that
allows predicting possible results of a measurement of system characteristics as
well as their statistical probability, provided the quantum state of the system (in
terms of its wavefunction) is known. We will try to keep this section as short as
possible, by writing down the main equations without superﬂuous prosa.
5.3
Theoretical Considerations
5.3.1
General Properties of the Wavefunction
Normalization: In the given coordinate representation, the wavefunction is normal-
ized—if possible—according to (4.6) and (4.6a).
Superposition principle: Let 1 and 2 describe physical states of the regarded
system. Then, the wavefunction:
 = a11 + a22
(5.2)
(a1, a2-constants) also describes a possible physical state of the system.
Let 1 describe a physical state of the regarded system. Then, the wavefunc-
tion:
 = const. ∗1
describes the same state.
Note that in (4.7a), the substitution of a positive quantum number n by its
negative counterpart would be equivalent to the multiplication of the wavefunc-
tion with the constant value −1, which describes exactly the same quantum state.
Therefore, we restricted on positive quantum numbers only when dealing with the
particle-in-a-box system.
Construction of the Hamiltonian: The recipe is: Start with the classical Hamilton
function, and replace all observables (dynamic variables that can be measured) by

In order to obtain a feeling for j, let us calculate it for a freely propagating

Thus, the probability current density of a freely propagating particle appears to
be the product of its formally calculated probability density with its velocity and
is, of course, constant.
Remark As we have mentioned in Sect. 5.1, in the de Broglie–Bohmian quantum
theory, particles are assumed to have coordinates and to move on paths. The latter is
determined by the wavefunction; the wave “guides” the particles on their way and
thus acts as a “pilot wave.” Indeed, for the discussed single particle, we have:

, while  follows from the Schrödinger equation

∂t  = ˆH. Thus, in the de Broglie–Bohmian quantum theory, the Schrödinger
equation delivers the wavefunction, which guides the particle on its path. Note that
this interpretation is contrary to what is in the essence of the Copenhagen school;
there (5.4a) must not be interpreted as deﬁning a particle’s path.

Relevant Properties of Linear Operators
Let us now consider a mathematical operation ˆF that transforms a function u(x)
into a function v(x):

We will then use the writing
ˆFu(x) = v(x)
Which means that the operator ˆF is deﬁned through the result of its action on
a function u(x), while v(x) is another function of the same coordinate(s) as u(x).
(Here and in the following, x may be understood as a single coordinate or as a
couple of coordinates describing the system.) The operator ˆFis linear, if and only
if:
ˆF(u1 + u2) = ˆFu1 + ˆFu2

is fulﬁlled for any functions u1(x) and u2(x). Examples of such operators are:

The terminology is:

ˆF and ˆG commute

ˆF and ˆG do not commute
Obviously, because of example 5:

The operators ˆx and ˆpx do not commute.

u2(x), which are supposed to be square-integrable functions over the full domain
of deﬁnition now.
Eigenfunctions and eigenvalues:
Let u(x) be a continuous and square-integrable function that sufﬁces:
ˆFu(x) = f u(x)
(5.7)
With f —some constant. Then u(x) represents an eigenfunction of the operator
ˆF and f the corresponding eigenvalue.

Note that more than one linearly independent eigenfunction may belong to the
same eigenvalue. In this case, the eigenvalue is called to be degenerated.

real. The set of eigenvalues of an operator forms the spectrum of eigenvalues of
that operator. Note that the spectrum of eigenvalues may be discrete or continuous.
Orthogonality of eigenfunctions of self-adjoint operators (discrete spectrum

must be fulﬁlled. Equation (5.8) is an expression of the fact that the eigenfunc-
tions of a self-adjoint operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are mutually
orthogonal. If the eigenfunctions are additionally normalized according to (4.6a),
we can write:

X
un(x)∗um(x)dx = δnm =

1; n = m
(5.9)
Eigenfunctions u(x) that sufﬁce (5.9) are called orthonormalized.
Note that the eigenfunctions that belong to degenerated eigenvalues are not
automatically orthogonal to each other. But in this case, proper linear combination
of the eigenfunctions may be constructed such that the resulting eigenfunctions
are again mutually orthogonal.
Let us now recapitulate our treatment from Chap. 4 in view of the results of the
operator approach discussed in this section. Obviously, the Hamiltonian as intro-
duced in (4.2) is a linear self-adjoint operator. Hence, it has real eigenvalues, and
a set of othonormalized eigenfunctions may always be constructed, as correspond-
ing to the solutions of (4.4) in the stationary case. The Hamiltonian (4.2) itself is
a sum of the operators of kinetic and potential energies, and what we have done
in Sect. 4.3.1 is to associate its eigenvalues with the allowed energy levels of the
quantum system. And the same procedure will now be carried out with other oper-
ators representing physical (measurable) quantities: We will represent each of them
by a self-adjoint linear operator and will assume that their eigenvalues correspond
to the set of possible (“allowed”) results of a measurement of that quantity.
5.3.4
Operators with Joint Eigenfunctions
Imagine now that we are able to prepare a quantum system in a well-speciﬁed
state, described by the wavefunction . Let us further assume that we want to
perform a measurement of the quantity F (coordinate, momentum or the like) in
that quantum system. We will call a physical quantity that can be measured an
observable. The observable F should be associated with the self-adjoint operator
ˆF, with corresponding eigenfunctions n and real eigenvalues f n.
According to Sect. 5.2, it may happen that although the system is prepared
in a well-deﬁned manner (with respect to a given wavefunction ), the result of
a particular measurement cannot be reliably predicted. Instead, when performing
the cycle of system preparation and measurement often enough, it may turn out
that different measurement results are recorded but each with a certain individual
probability.
However, in special cases, it may be observed that always the same measure-
ment result is obtained, i.e., it has the probability 100%. As a postulate, let us now
assume that whenever a particular measurement result F is obtained with 100%
probability, then the systems quantum state  is identical to an eigenstate n of
the operator ˆF, and the measurement result F is the corresponding eigenvalue f n.

5.3
Theoretical Considerations
89
And vice versa, if we prepared an eigenstate n of ˆF, the result of a measurement
of F will be the eigenvalue f n with absolute certainty.
It should be emphasized that the above discussion does not concern questions of
imperfections or inaccuracies of the real measurement device and principle. It has
to be understood in the sense that the observable F can adopt only such values,
which coincide with one of the eigenvalues of ˆF. As a consequence, only such
values are measured.
For that reason, eigenfunction and eigenvalue problems play an exceptional role
in quantum mechanics. In order to guarantee real eigenvalues that correspond to
real measurement results, the operators associated to the observables should be
self-adjoint.
As a consequence, the spectrum of eigenvalues {f n} of the operator ˆF is further
associated with the full set of possible measurement results of the observable F.
From that, we will later conclude that the set of eigenfunctions of ˆF forms a basis
for the wavefunction  in any quantum state.
Let the eigenfunctions n of ˆF sufﬁce:
ˆFn = fnn
(5.10)
With { fn}—spectrum of eigenvalues. Let us assume that the spectrum is
discrete, and that each eigenvalue corresponds to only one eigenfunction (non-
degenerated case). Provided that the n form a complete set of eigenfunctions
(we will call it a basis), we may write:
 =

n
ann
(5.11)
(It is here assumed that  and n are square-integrable functions of the same
variables and sufﬁce the same boundary conditions). The coefﬁcients in (5.11) are
easily found provided that the n are orthonormalized according to (5.9):

(5.11a)
In that connection, it is interesting to know, whether or not two different observ-
ables may deliver well-deﬁned measurement values in a given quantum state. In
the context of the above argumentation, in this case, the state of the system should
correspond to a common eigenfunction of both operators. Is this possible?
Let us assume that the mentioned two observables correspond to the operators ˆF
and ˆG. We restrict on the case of discrete eigenvalue spectra without degeneration.
Let us assume, that
ˆF and ˆG have a complete set of joint eigenfunctions {n}.

We come to the result that if the operators have a complete set of joint eigen-
functions, they must commute. Let us note in this context, that according to
(5.5), the operators of the coordinate and the momentum do not commute. In
fact they have no joint eigenfunctions. Consequently, there is no state where well-
deﬁned values of both coordinate and momentum may be measured. This results
in the formulation of Heisenbergs uncertainty relation (for a short derivation, see
Sect. 5.6.1):

Let us now prove, that if

ˆF, ˆG

= 0, the operators will have a complete set of
joint eigenfunctions. Let n be an eigenfunction of ˆF. Then, from
ˆFn = fnn
We have
ˆF ˆGn = ˆG ˆFn = fn ˆGn
That means that ˆGn is an eigenfunction of ˆF corresponding the eigenvalue
f n. But the same is true for n. Once we have excluded degeneration, ˆGn can
differ from n only by a constant factor. But then we ﬁnd that
ˆGn = const. ∗n
which means that n is also an eigenfunction of ˆG independently of the chosen
value n.
We come to the result that ˆF and ˆG have a complete set of joint eigenfunctions
if and only if they commute.

5.3
Theoretical Considerations
91
Remark In the case of degenerated eigenvalues, the discussion should be modiﬁed.
Let us assume that the eigenvalue f n is degenerated. Then, in the general case, ˆGn ̸=
const.∗n. In this case, however it turns out that a suitable linear superposition of the
wavefunctions n that belong to the degenerated eigenvalue f n allows constructing
an eigenfunction of ˆG. Once the linear superposition of eigenfunctions belonging
to the same f n is per se at the same time an eigenfunction of ˆF, the conclusion on
the existence of joint eigenfunctions of ˆF and ˆG remains true even in the case of
degeneration.
5.3.5
Quantum Mechanical Expectation Values
In quantum mechanics, the expectation value of the observable F in a system
described by the wavefunction  is given by (5.13):
⟨F⟩=

V
∗ˆFdV
(5.13)
This equation corresponds to the 3D case; in our often-used 1D model, it reads
like:
⟨F⟩=

X
∗ˆFdx
(5.13a)
In the case that  is an eigenfunction of ˆF with the eigenvalue f, we have
ˆF = f , and from (5.13), it follows that ⟨F⟩=

V
∗ˆFdV = f

V
∗dV =
f . Also, we have

F2

V
∗ˆF ˆFdV = f

∗ˆFdV = f 2.
Therefore, if  is an eigenfunction of ˆF, for the variance of the observable F,
we obtain:

(F)2


F2
−⟨F⟩2 = f 2 −f 2 = 0
If the wavefunction  in (5.13) does not belong to the set of eigenfunctions of
ˆF, it can be expanded into a series of eigenfunctions of ˆF. Thus, let us use the
expansion (5.11) together with (5.10). That leads to:

(5.14)
Here, we have made use of the orthonormalization condition (5.9). Obviously,
the expectation value is composed from all eigenvalues of ˆF (i.e., all possible
measurement results) entering into (5.14) with speciﬁc weights, which correspond
to the square of the absolute values of the expansion coefﬁcients in (5.11). When
comparing with classical expressions for the expectation value, it becomes clear
that the |am| 2 have the sense of individual probabilities to observe a certain eigen-
value f m in the given quantum state. Once the set of {f m} contains all principally
possible values of F, the probabilities must sum up to 1. Hence, we have:
1 =

n
|an|2
(5.15)
But this is the condition that in (5.11), the functions n form a basis for the
expansion of . Therefore, the expansion (5.11) is consistent within our theoretical
treatment.
Again, provided that  is identical with the m-th eigenfunction of ˆF, then from
(5.11) and (5.14) we ﬁnd:
 = m ⇒|am| = 1; an̸=m = 0 ⇒⟨F⟩=

n
|an|2 fn = fm
Hence, in an eigenstate, the observable F adopts its eigenvalue with 100%
probability. It follows that the recipe (5.13) is fully consistent with the discussion
performed at the beginning of Sect. 5.3.4.
Remark What happens to the wavefunction of a quantum system when a measure-
ment is performed? And even more generally: What is a measurement?
In fact, these questions are still debated, and the provided answers may be used
to distinguish between different quantum theories. Although this topic is far beyond
the scope of this textbook, I will try to give a short idea on what is the problem.
Let us have a closer look at (5.11).
 =

n
ann
Let us assume that prior to the measurement, the system was in a state described
by (5.11). Let the measurement of F result in the value f m. What is the state of the
system after the measurement?
The more or less generally accepted answer is:
|after measurement = m
This equation clearly asserts that the measurement performed on a quantum state
is invasive, i.e., it changes the state of the quantum system. The transformation

5.3

93
 →m is called a collapse of the initial wavefunction . But what is the concrete
physical mechanism behind the transformation:
 = 
n ann →

???
 = m???
It turns out that this collapse of the wavefunction cannot be explained as a result
of the time evolution deﬁned by the linear Schrödinger (4.2) only. Therefore, that
wavefunction collapse is introduced as an independent postulate of the Copenhagen
school, i.e., as an independent addendum to the Schrödinger equation. Thus, when
a measurement is performed, the Schrödinger time evolution is replaced by the
postulated spontaneous collapse of the wavefunction, which formally solves the
problem. Provided that we have a consistent idea on which physical processes may
be regarded as a measurement.

m occursasaresult
of additional nonlinear terms in the Schrödinger equation.
In many-world theories, no fundamental collapse of the wavefunction occurs. It
is instead assumed that whenever we measure the result “f m”; so this measurement
result is obtained only in “our world,” while the other possible results f n̸=m are
observed in “other” worlds. So the wavefunction does not collapse but splits into
different branches, each of them corresponding to another world. Of course, from the
viewpoint of one selected world, say the m-th one, a wavefunction collaps according
to  →m has occurred.
In the de Broglie–Bohmian theory, it is however assumed that the wavefunction
alone does not contain the full information on the system but is complemented by
an equation describing the real coordinates of the quantum particles, i.e., the real
conﬁguration of the system. During and after the measurement, the wavefunction of
the whole system (i.e., quantum system + measurement apparatus) naturally evolves
according to the linear Schrödinger (4.2), i.e., it does not suffer any spontaneous
collapse. Whenever the value “f m” is measured, it has the meaning that there is a
real conﬁguration of the system as deﬁned by its coordinates which corresponds to
that measurement result. In this sense, one could say that it is only the “branch” m
of the full wavefunction (5.11) that “guides” the dynamics of the system, while the
other branches n̸=m are “empty” and represent what is sometimes called “ghost
wavefunctions.” But these ghost wavefunctions are of no practical relevance. This
can be shown in terms of a stringent Bohmian approach to the theory of measurement
processes in quantum mechanics, which leads to the concept of an effective collapse
of the wavefunction.
Note that all these theories represent reﬁned theoretical buildings and are much
more complex as it might seem from the few rows written here. Interested readers
are kindly referred to the recommended books for getting more information.

would be fulﬁlled [1, p. 19]. According to (5.13), this requires the wavefunction to
be strongly localized in the vicinity of<x>. Here, the picture of the wavepacket is
illustrative. Indeed, when identifying a propagating particle with a well localized
wave packet, (5.20c) would be fulﬁlled, and hence
m d2

(5.20d)
would be valid, which is a direct analog on to the classical relation (5.20b). As we
have seen at the end of Sect. 3.6, for a macroscopic particle, the wave packet remains
localized during propagation, such that a classical description makes sense. For an
electron, however, the wave packet tends to broaden at a very short time scale, such
that (5.20c) and (5.20d) become invalid. Hence, it is the wave description that should
be used for such kind of microscopic particle, and (5.20) or (5.20a) do not describe
any convergence to classical equations of motion.
Without proof, let us mention a further important property of quantum mechanical
expectation values. Whenever the movement of a single quantum particle is spatially
conﬁned in a potential U ∝rk, as a result of the quantum mechanical version of the
virial theorem, the following relation holds in any possible state:

Time-Independent First-Order Perturbation Theory
(Without Degeneration)
So far we have implicitly assumed that the Schrödinger (4.2) can be solved ana-
lytically in an exact manner. This is, however, by far not always the case. Often
enough an analytical solution of the Schrödinger equation cannot be indicated. The
perturbation theory provides a tool for an approximate solution of the Schrödinger
equation in such a case.
Let us assume the time-independent Hamiltonian:
ˆH = ˆH(0) + ˆV
(5.26)
Let us further assume that the time-independent Schrödinger equation:
ˆH(0)ψ(0) = E(0)ψ(0)
may be solved exactly. We will now consider ˆH(0) as the Hamiltonian of what we
call the unperturbed system, while ˆV represents what we call the perturbation.

5.3
Theoretical Considerations

In practice, it will often happen that the Schrödinger equation of the perturbed
system:
ˆHψ = Eψ
cannot be solved exactly. We will therefore search an approximate solution.
First of all, let us represent the unknown wavefunction ψ as a superposition of
the wavefunctions of the unperturbed system:
ψ =

m
amψ(0)
m
(am –constant coefﬁcients). Substitution into the Schrödinger equation leads to:
ˆHψ = Eψ =

When multiplying this equation from the left with

ψ(0)

and integrating
over the full volume, as the result of the orthonormalization of the unperturbed
wavefunctions, we obtain:
ak

E −E(0)

Here, the perturbation matrix element is calculated with respect to the unper-
turbed wavefunctions, i.e.,
V (0)
km =

ψ(0)

 ∗ˆV ψ(0)
m dV
With V-volume in the case of a single-particle system. Do not confuse with the
perturbation operator ˆV .
Let us now start with approximations. We assume that the perturbation is
“small.” Therefore we postulate that the perturbation results in a small change
E(1) in the energy states of the system, compared with the unperturbed one. So we
postulate:
E ≈E(0) + E(1)
Let us further assume, that in a zeroth approximation, ( ˆV = 0), the system is
in the n-th unperturbed eigenstate. Hence, in zeroth order,
E = E(0)

Note further that the expansion coefﬁcient a(1)

remains undeﬁned this way.
For normalization reasons, it should be set equal to zero. Indeed, when setting as
before:

5.4
Consistency Considerations
Let us start with a short resume here. In Sect. 2.4, we have clearly demonstrated
that a purely classical approach cannot explain basic experimental data concerning
the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter. We have claimed that we
need another theory for that.
In Sect. 3.4, we have collected indications on the relevance of wave charac-
teristics for the description of the dynamics of matter. Therefore, the idea was to
develop a theory that is based on a wave equation.
In Sect. 4.4, it was emphasized that this wave equation cannot be derived in a
stringent manner but is rather guessed. The solution of the Schrödinger equation
for a simple box potential enabled us later to understand the characteristics of
several real physical phenomena, among them the α-decay. We have emphasized
that it is the consistency of the theoretical predictions of quantum mechanics with
experimental data that certiﬁes its application.
In this sense, what we have done in this chapter is the consistent continuation of
this logical path. We have formulated the Schrödinger equation, we have worked
out mathematical tools that shall help us to ﬁnd its solutions, and we have for-
mulated recipes to gain further information on the physical system characteristics
from the solution of the Schrödinger equation.
We will proceed now with two concrete examples, namely the harmonic and
anharmonic oscillators. We will demonstrate that the harmonic oscillator may be
treated in terms of the theoretical material introduced in Sect. 5.3.7. In order to
tackle the anharmonic oscillator, the perturbation approach form Sect. 5.3.8 will
ﬁnd application.

Model System II: Harmonic Oscillator (1D)
For the 1D harmonic oscillator, we have the Hamiltonian (compare Sect. 2.5.1):
ˆH =
-
−ℏ2
2m
d2
dx2 + mω2

2
x2
.
(5.28)
Fortunately, energy levels and coordinate matrix elements of the harmonic
oscillator may be obtained without explicitly solving Schrödingers equation by
applying the matrix technique (Heisenberg 1925). Let us start from differentiating
(5.1) with respect to time. That leads to:
¨x + ω2
0x = 0
For the matrix elements, we correspondingly have:
(¨x)nm + ω2
0xnm = 0
From (5.25), we ﬁnd:
(¨x)nm = iωnm(˙x)nm = −ω2
nmxnm ⇒xnm

ω2
0 −ω2
nm
	
= 0 ⇒
xnm = 0 if ωnm ̸= ±ω0
Let us introduce a counting rule according to:
ωnm = ±ω0 ⇔m = n ∓1
(5.29)
As a consequence, for a harmonic oscillator, only those matrix elements xnm
may be different from zero where m = n ± 1 holds.
According to the deﬁnition (5.6), for any self-adjoint operator ˆF, we ﬁnd:
Fnm = F∗
mn. When assuming real wavefunctions in our case, as a direct conse-
quence of the self-adjoint nature of the participating operators, we have xnm =
xmn.
Let us now make use of the Ehrenfest theorem (5.19)
d
dt ⟨x⟩= ⟨p⟩
m
Then, from (5.5), (5.17), (5.17a), we ﬁnd the commutation rule:
ˆx ˆ˙x −ˆ˙x ˆx = i ℏ
m ⇒
(x ˙x)nn −(˙xx)nn = i ℏ

Remark When introducing the so-called oscillator strength f ln according to:

The eigenvalue (5.10) ˆFn = fnn.

⟨n

,,,m⟩= ⟨a | m⟩= ⟨n | b⟩with ⟨a| = ⟨n| ˆF and |b⟩= ˆF|m⟩.
As an example, let us rederive (5.27) in the Dirac notation. In ﬁrst order, we set
ψ = ψ(0)
n

ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆV
where ˆV and ψ(1)

Here, β is some small parameter. The Hamiltonian is thus composed from that
of a harmonic oscillator (= ˆH(0)) and a small perturbation, while the perturbation
ˆV is given by:

At this point, we need some extension to the material presented so far. Let
us mention, that deﬁnition (5.6) for the self-adjoint operator may be written
as:⟨m| ˆF|n⟩= ⟨n| ˆF|m⟩∗. Note that not all operators are self-adjoint. Let us deﬁne
the adjoint to ˆF operator ˆF+ through the relationship: ⟨m| ˆF|n⟩= ⟨n| ˆF+|m⟩∗.
Then, the operator
ˆF is self-adjoint if and only if
ˆF =

Remark Let us recall that in the Dirac notation, an operator ˆF may act “to the
right side” but also “to the left side.” Thereby, the ket-vector ˆF|ψ⟩corresponds to
a bra-vector ⟨ψ| ˆF+ and vice versa. Abstractly, this is a direct conclusion from the
deﬁnition ⟨m| ˆF|n⟩= ⟨n| ˆF+|m⟩∗.
Indeed, from ⟨m| ˆF|n⟩= ⟨n| ˆF+|m⟩∗deﬁning ⟨ψ| = ⟨m| ˆF, we have:
⟨m| ˆF|n⟩= ⟨ψ | n⟩= ⟨n | ψ⟩∗= ⟨n| ˆF+|m⟩∗
Hence, from ⟨ψ| = ⟨m| ˆF⇔|ψ⟩= ˆF+|m⟩or ⟨ψ| = ⟨m| ˆF+⇔|ψ⟩= ˆF|m⟩.
A more illustrative but nevertheless strong derivation is obtained when using
the matrix representation of the operator ˆF as well as of the corresponding states,
identifying the ket with a single column matrix, while the bra corresponds to a
single row (compare task 5.7.14).
Indeed, when assuming |n⟩= C

ˆa+	n|0⟩, we have ⟨n| = C∗⟨0|
ˆa
	n. Therefore,
⟨n | n⟩= CC∗⟨0|
ˆa

ˆa+	n|0⟩
Multiple application of ˆa ˆa+ = ˆa+ ˆa + 1 together with ˆa|0⟩= 0 results in:

Therefore, we ﬁnally obtain (compare also tak 5.7.14):
ˆa+|n⟩=

ˆa|n⟩= √n|n −1⟩
(5.48)
Thereby, ˆa|0⟩= 0 per deﬁnition. The effect of applying ˆa to an eigenstate of
the harmonic oscillator with quantum number n is to turn it into the eigenstate
with quantum number n −1. ˆa+ has the opposite function. This is visualized in
Fig. 5.2; from there, the name “ladder operators” should become obvious.

5.6.3
Remarks on the Quantization of the Free Electromagnetic
Field
Idea.
Let us start from (2.1) and write the classical expression for the real electric
ﬁeld (for simplicity, we will not take its vector character into explicit account here)
of a plane wave propagating in vacuum according to:
E = E0e−i(ωt−kr) + E∗
0e+i(ωt−kr)
(5.50)
Each excitation of type (5.50) with a given ω, k, (and polarization state) will
be associated with what we call a ﬁeld mode.
In Chap. 3, we have already discussed, however, that the energy of an elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld oscillating with the angular frequency ω0 can only change in
discrete portions ℏω0, which we have called photons. Hence, each photon that is
added to or removed from the ﬁeld changes its energy by a ﬁxed value of ℏω0.
Once the number of photons is always integer, the possible energy values of the
monochromatic electromagnetic ﬁeld form an inﬁnite set of equidistant energy val-
ues, separated by ℏω0. Thus, these energy values exactly coincide with those of
the harmonic oscillator provided that we accept a ground-state energy of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld of ℏω0/2, which means that even in the absence of any photons,
there is still some energy in the corresponding ﬁeld mode (or now photon mode).
Hence, we associate the ﬁeld in a given ﬁeld mode with a harmonic oscillator
and make immediate use of the material developed in Sect. 5.6.2. This way we will
introduce the quantization of a single mode ﬁeld. In a multiple mode situation, we
have to sum up the corresponding single mode expressions to the complete ﬁeld.
Photon annihilation and creation operators
Particularly, according to (5.48), we introduce the photon annihilation operator ˆa
according to
ˆa|n⟩= √n|n −1⟩

114
5
Operators in Quantum Mechanics and Model System II
Here, |n⟩is associated with a quantum state with a well-deﬁned number of
photons n excited in the corresponding photon mode. We will call such states
Fock states.
We further introduce the photon creation operator ˆa+ according to:
ˆa+|n⟩=
√
n + 1|n + 1⟩
In agreement with (5.45) we can now write:
ˆH|n⟩= ℏω0

ˆa+ ˆa|n⟩+ 1
2|n⟩

= ℏω0

ˆa+√n|n −1⟩+ 1


= ℏω0

n|n⟩+ 1
2|n⟩



n + 1


|n⟩
We therefore introduce the self-adjoint operator of the photon number ˆN
ˆN ≡ˆa+ ˆa ⇒ˆN|n⟩= n|n⟩
(5.51)
Note that ˆN is self-adjoint; hence, it has orthogonal eigenfunctions.
Mnemonic trick: There is no need to confuse ˆa and ˆa+. The one with
the “ + ” has the function to “add” a photon, so it is the photon creation
operator. In (5.51), the order is:
ˆa+ ˆa ≡ˆN
For memorizing: read from left to right and realize that a photon must
ﬁrst be created, before it may be annihilated (see Fig. 5.3).
If you wish to change the order of ˆa and ˆa+(ﬁrst annihilate and then
create), so you need to have an extra photon ﬁrst. Therefore, change the
order and add one photon (i.e., add 1), and ﬁnd.
ˆa ˆa+ = ˆN + 1,
which coincides with the commutation rule (5.43).
Electric ﬁeld of a freely propagating plane wave in a Fock state
Clearly, all Fock states are eigenstates of both ˆN and
ˆH, such that the lat-
ter commute. We now perform the quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld by
replacing the classical ﬁeld (5.50) by the self-adjoint operator of the electric ﬁeld
(compare [3, 4])
ˆE = A0e−i(ωt−kr) ˆa + A∗
0e+i(ωt−kr) ˆa+
(5.52)

5.6

Remark The representation of the creation and annihilation operators in terms of
the matrix elements (5.49) deﬁnes the so-called occupation number representation.
It corresponds to a description of the ﬁeld quantum state in terms of the quantum
numbers n, i.e., the “occupation numbers.” In this representation, the ﬁeld operator
(5.52) acts on the ﬁelds wavefunction expressed in terms of the occupation numbers
n. The earlier introduced internal structure of ˆa and ˆa+ is here no more of interest;
ˆa and ˆa+ are deﬁned through the relations (5.43) and (5.48) only.
Then, because of ⟨n|ˆa|n⟩= √n⟨n | n −1⟩= 0 = ⟨n|ˆa+|n⟩⇒⟨n| ˆE|n⟩= 0∀n.
The expectation value of the electric ﬁeld is thus zero in each Fock state (5.47).
We will use the following writing for that: ⟨E⟩n = 0. It has the meaning that the
expectation value of E in the state |n⟩is zero. Note that because of (5.48), Fock
states cannot be eigenfunctions of ˆE. Therefore,

ˆE, ˆN

̸= 0.
This is an important result. In a photon state with a well-deﬁned number of
photons, the measurement result of the electric ﬁeld is uncertain, and vice versa.
This is contrary to the classical idea of the electric ﬁeld, where both energy density
and ﬁeld strength are well deﬁned.
Even in the ground state with n = 0, the ﬁeld is therefore different from zero.
Once the expectation value of the ﬁeld is nevertheless equal to zero, we have
to expect ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (“vacuum oscillations”), which
obviously provide the reason for the ﬁnite ground-state energy of the radiation
ﬁeld mode that is also different from zero.
Let us quantify these ﬁeld oscillations in terms of the variance of the electric
ﬁeld. When rewriting (5.52) for simplicity as:
ˆE = Aˆa + A∗ˆa+; A ≡A0e−i(ωt−kr)
We ﬁnd the following general expression (regardless of the concrete quantum
state) for the expectation value of the electric ﬁeld according to:

Such that even in the absence of any photon, ﬁeld strength oscillations as calcu-
lated in terms of the variance are different from zero. With an increasing number
of photons, the variance (uncertainty) in the electric ﬁeld increases drastically.
Glauber states
The question is now whether it is possible to construct photon states such that
the ﬁeld variance remains equal to that of the vacuum oscillations (5.55), although
a considerable number of photons is excited?
Yes, it is possible. The searched photon states |α⟩are eigenstates of the photon
annihilation operator according to:
ˆa|α⟩= α|α⟩
⟨α | α⟩= 1
(5.56)
Note that ˆa is not self-adjoint, such that its eigenvalues α may be complex, and
its eigenfunctions do not need to be orthogonal.

These so-called coherent states of the radiation ﬁeld provide states where the

It is easy to obtain the following expectation value:

(5.59)
In a Glauber state, the expectation value of the photon number is equal to |α|2,
such that α should be proportional to the classical ﬁeld amplitude. Indeed, we ﬁnd:
⟨E⟩α =

Aˆa + A∗ˆa+
α = A⟨α|ˆa|α⟩+ A∗⟨α|ˆa+|α⟩= Aα + A∗α∗
(5.60)
This coincides—by structure—with (5.50). Note that α →0 results in
both<N> α →0 and<E> α →0.
General results for important expectation values are summarized in Table 5.2.
In a Fock state, in general, variances in the photon number are vanishing, but
those in the ﬁeld strength are large. In Glauber states, there is certain variance in
the photon number, but that in the electric ﬁeld is smaller than in a Fock state.
Therefore, Glauber states can be regarded as photon states where a reasonable

Thus, the quantum mechanical Glauber states come closest to the classical idea
of the electric ﬁeld with well-deﬁned energy density and ﬁeld strength. Obviously,
because of the ﬁnite value of the vacuum ﬁeld oscillations, quantum states with a
vanishing relative standard deviation in the electric ﬁeld must correspond to states
with an inﬁnitely large energy.
Note again that for n = α = 0, the results obtained for Fock and Glauber states
are identical.
So everything seems ﬁne with the expectation values, if only we would have an
idea on the somewhat dubious amplitude A0 in (5.52). Let us ﬁnally clarify this.

Einstein Coefﬁcients and Quantum
Transitions
Abstract
The chapter is focused on the introduction of a perturbative treatment of quan-
tum transitions. In order to apply this concept to light–matter interactions, the
electric dipole interaction between the electric ﬁeld of the incident light wave
and the material system is considered as a time-dependent perturbation of the
quantum state of material system within a semiclassical approach. The results
are applied to a two-level system interacting with light in terms of the Einstein
coefﬁcients.
6.1
Starting Point
We have now collected enough knowledge to return to our basis topic, namely
the interaction of a material (quantum) system with electromagnetic radiation.
The very simplest possibility to deal with the radiation–matter topic in quantum
mechanics is to construct a model that has two energy levels only. We will call
this a two-level system (Fig. 6.1).
The idea is to neglect the multiplicity of energy levels a real material system
might have and to concentrate on two selected energy levels. This makes sense,
when the electromagnetic wave has a frequency close to the eigenfrequency of the
subsystem described by the two energy levels.
A very popular and transparent treatment of the interaction of such a two-level
system with electromagnetic irradiation may be performed in terms of the so-called
Einstein coefﬁcients. We will make use of a treatment published earlier in [1].

Physical Idea
Let us have a look at Fig. 6.2. It shows two discrete energy levels, E1 and E2. The
level 2 corresponds to a higher energy state of the system than level 1. Simply
for unambiguity, let us associate the ﬁrst level with a ground state and the second
one with an excited state. In order to describe the interaction between radiation
and the two-level system in terms of Einstein coefﬁcients, we have to consider
three phenomena: light absorption, spontaneous emission of light, and stimulated
emission of light by the two-level system.
Let us assume that the system is in the ﬁrst, low energy state. When the
radiation source is switched on, and the radiation frequency is close to the eigen-
frequency of the system, an absorption process of light is expected to transfer

the system from energy level 1 to the level 2 (the quantum system becomes
excited—compare also Fig. 4.2). Due to energy conservation, this energy gain
of the two-level system must be accompanied by an energy loss of the radiation
ﬁeld; hence, the energy is transferred from the electromagnetic ﬁeld to the two-
level system. This transfer of energy from the radiation ﬁeld to internal degrees
of freedom of the material system is what we will call further absorption of light.
This absorption process becomes more probable when the electromagnetic radia-
tion is more intense. The transition rate from level 1 to level 2 by absorption of
light is therefore expected to be proportional to:
• The intensity of the incident radiation
• The statistical probability to ﬁnd the system in state 1
Let us assume in this context that the electromagnetic ﬁeld in fact interacts with
a large amount of such two-level systems. Then, a considerably large part of the
energy of the ﬁeld may be transferred to the assembly of two-level systems. How-
ever, the energy loss of the ﬁeld is always equal to an integer multiple of the
excitation energy of the two-level systems. In our simple description, these single
portions of light energy that may be absorbed have been called photons.
We will now consider the case that a single selected two-level system is in
the second (excited) state. From our experience (or more accurate: from thermo-
dynamics), we know that within a certain characteristic time any excited system
tends to lose its energy, thus returning back into the ground state. In order to lose
energy, our system has to perform a process that is reverse to the absorption of
light, namely the emission of light (compare also Fig. 4.2). Let us postulate that
an excited quantum system may lose energy without any stimulation arising from
an external light source by emitting an energy portion of light that exactly corre-
sponds to the energy difference between the two energy levels. In this case, we
speak on the spontaneous emission of a photon. The transition rate from level 2 to
level 1 by spontaneous emission will be proportional to:
• The statistical probability to ﬁnd the system in state 2
There is a second mechanism to turn the system from the excited state into the
ground state. We postulate that the system may also perform a so-called stimulated
emission process. This has to be understood as an emission of light activated by
the incident electromagnetic wave. The transition rate from state 2 to state 1 caused
by this process should be proportional to:
• The intensity of the radiation
• The statistical probability to ﬁnd the system in state 2
Any of these elementary processes enters into the resulting full transition rate
with a speciﬁc proportionality coefﬁcient, the so-called Einstein coefﬁcients. It is
a common practice to use the following symbols for Einstein coefﬁcients:

124

Einstein Coefﬁcients and Quantum Transitions
• A21 for spontaneous emission (2→1)
• B21 for stimulated emission (2→1)
• B12 for absorption (1→2)
The next section will deal with a mathematical treatment of Einstein coefﬁcients,
and it will be our purpose to derive—step by step—exact expression for Einstein
coefﬁcients in the dipole approximation.
Finally, Fig. 6.2 gives a schematic representation of all the mentioned elemen-
tary processes. Here, the vertical arrows correspond to the transitions between
ground and excited states, while the sinusoidal structures demonstrate annihilation
or creation of a photon.

Theoretical Considerations
6.3.1
The Rate Equation
Commonly, in the philosophy of Einstein’s coefﬁcients, the electromagnetic ﬁeld
is characterized by the so-called spectral density of the radiation ﬁeld deﬁned as:
u ≡dE
V dω
(6.1)
This equation deﬁnes the spectral density as the ﬁeld energy per angular
frequency interval and per volume. E is again used for the energy. This may
lead to confusion with the electric ﬁeld strength, and we will try to avoid any
misinterpretations using suitable subscripts when necessary.
Let us further assume that we have an assembly of N0 two-level systems, inter-
acting with the radiation ﬁeld. Let N1 be the number of systems in the ground
state, and N2 in the excited one. Obviously,
N1 + N2 = N0 = const.
(6.2)
Due to the action of the radiation ﬁeld, the population of the excited state may
be changed. In terms of the mechanisms proposed in Sect. 6.2, the corresponding
rate equation is:
dN2
dt
= N1B12u −N2B21u −N2 A21
(6.3)
Corresponding to Fig. 6.2, the ﬁrst term in (6.3) describes absorption, which
leads to an increase in the population of the excited state. The second term
corresponds to stimulated emission, and the third one to spontaneous emission,
both resulting in a decrease of the population of the excited state. Of course,
here and throughout this section we only take the spectral density at a frequency
corresponding to the eigenfrequency of the two-level system into consideration.

6.3
Theoretical Considerations
125
Interesting information may be obtained regarding the special case of thermo-
dynamic equilibrium between radiation and matter. In this situation, dN2/dt = 0,
and from (6.3) it follows:
equilibrium : N1
N2
= B21u + A21
B12u
(6.4)
On the other hand, in equilibrium conditions with N0 = const, Boltzmann’s
statistics hold, resulting in
equilibrium : N1
N2
= e
E2−E1
kB T
(6.5)
where T is the absolute temperature. From (6.4) and (6.5) in combination, we
obtain an expression for the spectral density of the radiation ﬁeld in equilibrium
conditions as:
equilibrium : u =

B12

(6.6)
It is useful to discuss some special cases resulting from (6.6). Let us consider
the case of T →0. Then, N2 must be zero, and from (6.4) it follows that u = 0.
In the other extreme case (T →∞), it makes sense to assume that the radiation
density becomes inﬁnitively large. If so, from (6.6) we must demand that:
B12 = B21
(6.7)
Hence, the postulation of the stimulated emission appears to be absolutely
necessary to sufﬁce thermodynamics.
In fact, we do not need to rely on our feeling of an inﬁnitively large spectral
density at inﬁnitively large temperatures. Condition (6.7) will be obtained inde-
pendently as a result of the following perturbation theory treatment of quantum
transitions.
6.3.2
Perturbation Theory of Quantum Transitions
In order to get information about the mathematical structure of Einstein coefﬁ-
cients, it becomes now necessary to apply the mathematical apparatus of quantum
mechanics to the interaction of light with matter. The behavior of the system is
described by a wavefunction , obtained as the solution of Schrödinger’s (4.2).
The particular problem which will be considered now is sketched in Fig. 6.3.
Imagine a time-independent Hamiltonian ˆH0 with a set of discrete and nondegen-
erate eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenvalues {En}. Consider further that at

a certain moment at t < 0, the system is deﬁnitely in the stationary lth quantum
state and has the energy El.
In this case, the wavefunction l(r,t) sufﬁces Schrödinger’s equation
iℏ∂
∂t l(r, t) = ˆH0l(r, t)
(6.8)
while the energy level El is a solution of the eigenvalue problem
ˆH0ψl(r) = Elψl(r)
(6.9)
and
l(r, t) = e−i El
ℏtψl(r)
(6.10)
We will now make the situation more complicated. Let us illuminate the
regarded system with light. The light source will be switched on at the moment
t1 = 0. We will now have a completely different situation. The system is no more
described by the time-independent Hamiltonian
ˆH0. Instead, the full Hamilton
operator is now given by:
ˆH = ˆH(t) = ˆH0 + ˆV (t)
(6.11)
where the certainly time-dependent perturbation operator ˆV describes the interac-
tion between the light and the system.
Finally, let us switch off the light at t2 = t0. Again, (6.8)–(6.10) are valid for the
system. The question is: Is there any chance to ﬁnd the system now in a quantum
state m different from that which has been occupied at t = 0? If yes, then we will
state that the perturbation ˆV has caused a quantum transition between the states l
and m ̸= l. It is our task now to understand the conditions necessary for such a
transition.
First of all, let us introduce the common terminology:
• If the probability of the transition l →m is equal to zero, then the transition is
called forbidden with respect to the given perturbation ˆV .

6.3
Theoretical Considerations
127
• If the probability of the transition l →m is larger than zero, then the transition
is called allowed with respect to the given perturbation ˆV .
• The recipe which classiﬁes any transition as allowed or forbidden is called a
selection rule.
Clearly, Einstein’s coefﬁcient B12 must be correlated to the transition probability.
In particular, for a forbidden transition, the Einstein coefﬁcient should be zero.
Let us now turn to the mathematics. We tackle the interesting time interval:
0 < t < t0
Because the perturbation may be time-dependent, we have to regard the time-
dependent Schrödinger’s Equation (4.2) with the Hamiltonian (6.11). In order
to ﬁnd the solution, the unknown wavefunction is expanded into a series of
eigenfunctions of the unperturbed Hamiltonian ˆH0 (compare (5.22)):
(r, t) =

n
an(t)n(r, t)
(6.12)
where the expansion coefﬁcients an may now depend on time. Note that all
these eigenfunctions should be ortho-normalized. According to the normalization
condition, we have:

n
|an(t)|2 = 1
(6.13)
The system as described by (6.12) is in a quantum superposition state.
Following the usual interpretation of quantum mechanics, the value
|an(t)|2
has to be understood as the probability to ﬁnd the system in the nth quantum state,
when a corresponding measurement is performed.
It is therefore the time evolution of the expansion coefﬁcients {an} that is
utmost interesting for us. Substituting the wavefunction in (4.2) by (6.12) yields:

On the other hand, for each n we have:

(6.14)
Let us now see whether or not the perturbation is able to transfer the system
from state l to state m. We multiply (6.14) from the left side with the conju-
gate complex function ∗
m(r, t) and integrate over all coordinates. Due to the
normalization and orthogonality of wavefunctions, we have:

∗
m(r, t)n(r, t)dV = δmn
and therefore, from (6.14) we obtain:
iℏ˙am =

n(r, t) = e−i En

Let us remember the transition angular frequency according to:

(6.16)
Equation (6.15) may then be rewritten as:
iℏ˙am =

(6.17)
where the (transition) matrix element Vmn is deﬁned as:
Vmn ≡

ψ∗
m(r) ˆV ψn(r)dV
(6.18)
Let us now formulate the initial conditions. At t = 0, we require:
|al| = 1; an̸=l = 0

6.3
Theoretical Considerations
129
Particularly, at t = 0 we have am = 0. As long as al is close to one by modulus,
it may be regarded as constant, and a population of the mth state would then
require:
iℏ˙am
t≥0 = alVmleiωmlt ̸= 0
(6.19)
To fulﬁll (6.19), it is absolutely necessary that the matrix element Vml is dif-
ferent from zero. What we have found this way is the general formulation of a
selection rule: Given a perturbation ˆV , it can only cause a quantum transition
between the states l and m when the corresponding matrix element of the perturbation
operator Vml is different from zero.
Let us now regard the concrete case of the interaction of a microscopic quantum
system with light. We will restrict ourselves to a semiclassical description; i.e.,
although the material system is described in terms of quantum mechanics, we
use a classical description of the electric ﬁeld of the wave. Therefore, we make
use of the ansatz (5.50) while assuming a real ﬁeld amplitude. When the spatial
extension of the system is much smaller than the wavelength, we can neglect the
spatial structure of the wave and regard a homogenous but oscillating electric ﬁeld.
In that dipole approximation, the perturbation operator may be written as:
ˆV = −dE
(6.20)
With
E = E0,real cos ωt
(6.20a)
Such that
ˆV = −

with d—dipole moment, E as the electric ﬁeld vector (do not confuse with energy),
and E0 its amplitude. From (6.19), we ﬁnd:

ωml −ω
+ ei(ωml+ω)t −1
ωml + ω

(6.21)
which is valid as long as |al|≈1. dml is the matrix element of the dipole operator.
From (6.21), we see that in case of a dipole transition, it is the matrix element of
the dipole operator that needs to be different from zero. Moreover, we recognize
that the transition frequency ωml plays the role of the resonance frequency: The
closer the frequency of the electric ﬁeld to one of the transition frequencies ωml
or ωlm is, the more probable the transition becomes.
In order to compare this result to (6.3), we will again assume that we deal
with an assembly of quantum systems (e.g. atoms or molecules), while Nl is the

130

number of systems in the lth quantum state. Moreover, the transition rate between
the states l and m is given by the expression:
dNm
dt
∝d
dt |am|2 ∝|dml|2|E0|2Nl
(6.22a)
Interchanging the indices, we obtain
dNl
dt
∝d
dt |al|2 ∝|dlm|2|E0|2Nm
(6.22b)
Obviously, when comparing with (6.3), one sees that (6.22a) should correspond
to absorption, and (6.22b) to stimulated emission of light, provided that Em >
El. But the proportionality factors are completely identical, because the dipole
operator is self-adjoint. So we have:
|dml|2 = |dlm|2
For that reason, Einstein’s coefﬁcients B12 and B21 must be identical. On the
other hand, from (6.22a) and (6.22b) it turns out that
B12 ∝|d12|2
(6.23)
In fact, this is the most important conclusion for our further treatment of Ein-
stein coefﬁcients. The second conclusion is that, according to (6.16), resonance of
the radiation with the two-level system is expected to occur when the condition:
ω = ω21 ≡E2 −E1
ℏ
(6.24)
is fulﬁlled. Correspondingly, the energy of the “resonant” photon as deﬁned before
must be equal to ℏω21.
Finally, let us rewrite (6.6) taking our new ﬁndings into account. We shall write:

(6.25)

6.4
Consistency Considerations
131
6.4
Consistency Considerations
Let us return to (6.19) and substitute (6.20) into (6.19). Then, dipole transitions
are expected to occur whenever the condition:
iℏ˙am
t≥0 = alVmleiωml t = −al

dmle−i(ω−ωml)t + dmlei(ω+ωml)t
E0 ̸= 0
Moreover, the larger am by absolute value becomes, the more efﬁcient the
transition will be. Taking into account (6.21), and particularly the obvious res-
onant behavior of this expression, we see that for an efﬁcient dipole transition, the
following conditions should be fulﬁlled:
|al| ≈1
|dml| →′′ large′′
|E0| →′′ large′′
ω →±ωml
(6.26)
When comparing with the classical expression such as (2.14), we see that
the quantum mechanical transition frequency ωml plays the role of the classi-
cal resonance frequency ω0 of the corresponding absorption line. The population
probability of the mth level and the transition matrix element are obviously impor-
tant characteristics for calculating the intensity of the absorption line. And, in
the absence of an external electric ﬁeld, no transition is expected. This is a
consequence of the semiclassical ansatz (6.20).
At this point, we arrive at an obvious inconsistency. Let us remember that
the process of spontaneous emission of light occurs regardless of the presence
or absence of an incident light wave. However, in the philosophy of Sect. 6.3.2,
(6.21), no quantum transitions are allowed to occur when the ﬁeld amplitude E0
is zero. Hence, our theory as developed so far does generally not allow for any
spontaneous transition processes. Nevertheless, these transitions occur in real life.
So what is the reason for the discrepancy between our theory and experiment?
It turns out that it is the ansatz for the perturbation operator (6.20) that is
incompatible with the existence of spontaneous quantum transitions resulting in
the emission of a photon. In classical electrodynamics, the energy of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld is zero in the case of a vanishing ﬁeld strength. A complete quantum
mechanical treatment (including the quantization of the ﬁeld itself) will lead to a
somewhat different result discussed in Sect. 5.6.3. In particular, it turns out that
in the absence of photons, the ﬁeld still has a ground-state energy of èω/2 and
thus a certain energy density that is different from zero. On the other hand, when
expressing the energy density through the electric ﬁeld, we obtain a nonzero ﬁeld
strength variance resulting in:

Einstein Coefﬁcients and Quantum Transitions
(compare also (5.61)). These “zero oscillations” of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (single
ﬁeld mode approximation) provide the perturbation necessary for the initiation of
spontaneous effects in optical spectroscopy, among them the spontaneous emission
of light. A corresponding calculation will be provided later in Sect. 7.6.2.
Hence, in our semiclassical treatment of Einstein’s coefﬁcients, we have to
accept the existence of spontaneous transitions as a conclusion from thermody-
namic principles, because without them, no relaxation process would be available
to return the excited system back to equilibrium once the radiation ﬁeld is zero
at a certain time t (note that in Sect. 6.2, other possible relaxation channels have
been excluded). Indeed, when returning to (6.3) and assuming u = 0, we have:
dN2
dt
= −N2 A21 ⇒N2 = N20e−A21 t ≡N20e−t
τ
(6.27)
Therefore, the reciprocal value of A21 may be interpreted as the lifetime of an
excited quantum level that relaxes down to equilibrium by spontaneous emission
of light only.
Note that (6.27) asserts that N2 →0 when t →∞. This is a result from
(6.3), where no thermal population mechanism of the excited quantum state is
incorporated at u = 0. In reality, N2 will approach the thermal population level as
given by the corresponding Boltzmann factors.
Hence, the consideration of all three processes of absorption, stimulated,
and spontaneous emission altogether allows for a thermodynamically consistent
description of the interaction of the two-level system with radiation, provided that
B12 = B21, and provided that spontaneous light emission provides the only rel-
evant relaxation channel. Thereby, our perturbation treatment resulting in (6.22a)
and (6.22b) is consistent with the requirement B12 = B21.
6.5
Application to Practical Problems
6.5.1
Light Absorption and Light Ampliﬁcation
Let us now come to an utmost important practical application of the theoretical
apparatus derived in this chapter so far. From (6.3) and (6.2), we ﬁnd that
dN2
dt
= (N1 −N2)(B12u + A21) −N1A21
(6.28)
In the stationary case, when dN2/dt = 0, we obtain the stationary solution:
(N1 −N2) =
N1A21
B12u + A21
> 0 ∀u
(6.29)
No matter how intense the ﬁeld is, as long as we deal with a two-level system,
the stationary population of the ground state will always be higher than that of

Application to Practical Problems
133
the excited one. Of course, this conclusion is only true as long as the excited
level may exclusively be populated by direct optical pumping from the ground
state, as presumed in (6.3). In this case, it is impossible to achieve a stationary
population inversion (N2 > N1). On the contrary, for a sufﬁciently high u, N1 and
N2 become nearly equal to each other. In this case, the transition 1 →2 is called
to be saturated.
On the other hand, a population inversion (if it could be achieved anyway)
would offer prospective physical effects. Let us for a moment assume that we
prepared the system in a way that N2 > N1 is fulﬁlled (population inversion).
From (6.28), we ﬁnd that
N2 > N1 ⇒dN2
dt
< 0
As long as we have population inversion in a two-level system, absorption
and emission processes in sum tend to transfer the system from the excited to
the ground state. This conclusion is particularly true when the spontaneous emis-
sion processes may be neglected. Consequently, the energy is transferred from the
two-level systems to the radiation ﬁeld. An incident light beam may therefore be
ampliﬁed when traveling through a medium with population inversion. The prepa-
ration of population inversion is therefore essential for the construction of light
ampliﬁers.
Let us assume a plane wave propagating through a medium along the z-axis.
Both stimulated absorption and emission processes may change its amplitude.
Phenomenologically, we can introduce a linear absorption coefﬁcient α when
assuming that the intensity change per path increment dz is proportional to the
intensity I at the point z. Hence, we postulate:
dI
dz ∝−I ⇒dI
dz = −αI ⇒I = I(z) = I0e−αz
(6.30)
Equation (6.30) is often called Beer’s law.
The previous discussion (see particularly (6.28)) leads us to a very important
conclusion on the structure of the absorption coefﬁcient in quantum mechanics.
We must assume that the absorption coefﬁcient explicitly depends on the popula-
tion difference N1 – N2. Indeed, when neglecting for a moment the spontaneous
emission processes, for (6.28) we have:
dN2
dt
≈B12u(N1 −N2)
(6.30a)
When comparing (6.23), (6.30), and (6.30a), the following hypothesis may be
obtained:
α ∝|d21|2(N1 −N2)

Fig.6.4 Three- and four-level systems that allow to create population inversion by optical pump-
ing. In the three-level system, population inversion is accomplished between the ﬁrst and second
states. This is what is done in the ruby laser. In the four-level system, one achieves population
inversion between the second and third states (e.g., in the neodymium-YAG laser)
If so, it is the sign of the population difference that is crucial for the decision
whether the material is absorbing (positive absorption coefﬁcient) or amplifying
(negative absorption coefﬁcient). In saturation conditions, one should expect that
absorption and stimulated emission processes compensate each other; hence in
this case, a light beam would travel through the medium without any damping or
ampliﬁcation. Such a medium appears to be transparent, and the corresponding
absorption coefﬁcient is zero.
How to achieve population inversion? In practice, a population inversion may
be achieved, for example, by collisions of electrons with atoms, which transfer the
atoms into an excited state. For example, gas lasers such as the helium–neon laser
work on this principle. Another way is to use three- or four-level systems with
optical pumping, as shown in Fig. 6.4.
In the terminology of laser physics, a medium with population inversion is
called an active medium. Keeping in mind that the absorption coefﬁcient of an
active medium is negative, from Beer’s law (6.30) we ﬁnd:
I = I0e−αx = I0e|α|x
(6.32)
Hence, in an active medium, the intensity of a propagating wave is expected
to exponentially grow in intensity. What we obtain this way is an ampliﬁer of
electromagnetic waves.
6.5.2
Feedback
In our further discussion, we will simply assume that a population inversion has
been achieved anyway. In complete analogy to electronics, we only need to add a

6.5

positive feedback to an ampliﬁer in order to build a generator of electromagnetic
waves. That kind of light ampliﬁcation due to stimulated emission, combined with
a feedback mechanism, leads us to a speciﬁc kind of light source that is called a
laser.
Let us have a look at Fig. 6.5.
Figure 6.5 sketches the idea of combining an amplifying element with a feed-
back mechanism. Let us start from the left side. We assume an external input, for
example, an electromagnetic wave. The action of the amplifying element shall be
to magnify the input by a complex factor B. After passing the ampliﬁer for one
time, we obtain an output according to:
output = B · input,
|B| > 1
(6.33)
Let us now discuss what happens when the mentioned feedback mechanism
comes into play. A part of the output (say, the nominal output multiplied with a
constant F, where F is again a possibly complex number with |F| < 1) is transferred
back to the input side, again ampliﬁed, and so on. Then, instead of the simple
output as given by (6.33) we get an effective output obtained as the result of an
inﬁnite number of loops through the ampliﬁer caused by the feedback mechanism.
Mathematically, this may be expressed in the following manner:
effective output =

(1 −F) + (1 −F)BF + (1 −F)B2F2 + ...

Particularly, (6.34) leads to an inﬁnitively large effective enhancement factor
in the limit BF →1. Writing down B ≡|B|eiφB and F ≡|F|eiφF , the condition

BF →1 breaks down into two conditions for amplitude and phase according to:
|B| →
F−1
φB + φF = 2 jπ, where j is an integer
(6.35)
In the case that the effective enhancement becomes inﬁnitively large, an arbi-
trarily small input (e.g., a single photon, accidentally emitted as the result of a
spontaneous emission process) may lead to a ﬁnite effective output of the system
(in our case to electromagnetic irradiation). There is no contradiction to energy
conservation, because the amplifying element (in our case the active medium) is
pumped by an external energy source. Such a system works as a generator of
light and is called a laser. Of course, it will also generate light when the light
ampliﬁcation deﬁned by B is larger than the threshold value deﬁned by (6.35).
Consequently, we have to fulﬁll two conditions in order to construct a generator
of light. First of all, we have to take care that the light ampliﬁcation is large enough
to compensate any losses of light that leave the system. Technically, this is accom-
plished through a sufﬁciently high population inversion in the active medium, and
the corresponding mathematical criterion is called the laser condition, but it will
not be derived here.
The necessary feedback is usually achieved placing the active medium into a
resonator (the cavity), which may be built up by two parallel mirrors. Let R1 and
R2 be their reﬂectances (reﬂectance = ratio between the intensities of reﬂected
and incident light—see later Sect. 13.5.2), while L is the cavity length. Usually,
the active medium does not ﬁll the complete cavity, but extends for a smaller
length l. This situation is shown in Fig. 6.6.
Let us now rewrite (6.35) for the special case of the geometry from the ﬁgure.
Imagine a light wave that performs one loop in the cavity. In performing one loop
in the cavity, the wave has to cross the active medium for two times, and therefore,
Cavity length L

second mirror; R2< 1

Application to Practical Problems
137
its intensity will grow by a factor e2|α|l. On the other hand, at the second mirror
some light will escape from the cavity, so that after one loop, the intensity of the
light wave becomes:
I(after one loop) = I0e2|αl|R2
(6.36)
Equation (6.36) describes an extremely simpliﬁed case, because no loss mech-
anisms inside the cavity have been taken into account. But the principle is
nevertheless clear. The value

R2e2|α|l is nothing else than the absolute value
of the product BF as ﬁxed in (10.58). Consequently, for light generation it is
necessary that

R2e2|α|l ≥1 ⇒e2|α|l ≥(R2)−1
(6.37)
is fulﬁlled.
The condition on the phases may be written in a similarly simple way. After
one loop, according to (6.35), the phase of the wave is allowed to have changed
only for an integer multiple of 2π. We thus have:
φ(after one loop) = φ0 + 2 jπ
(6.38)
The phase gain is thus equal to 2jπ. On the other hand, the phase gain for a
single loop of a light wave between two plane interfaces is equal to 2kL = 4πL/λ
(provided that the refractive index is equal to one. The concept of the refractive
index will be introduced formally in Chap. 13, but I will assume at this point
that you, dear reader, already have an idea on what a refractive index is). This is
clearly a rough simpliﬁcation, but it still allows highlighting the main principles
of the laser action. Moreover, possible phase shifts occurring upon reﬂection at the
mirrors will also not be taken into account in our treatment, in order to keep the
picture as simple as possible.
We therefore ﬁnd the condition (remember Fig. 4.1 in this context):
2 jπ = 4π L
λ
⇒λ = λ j = 2L
j
(6.39)
The conditions (6.37) and (6.39) have to be fulﬁlled together in order to get the
laser working. Let us therefore analyze their common solutions.
We will start from condition (6.37). It obviously deﬁnes a threshold value for
the ampliﬁcation coefﬁcient which must be exceeded in order to get the laser
work. As the ampliﬁcation coefﬁcient is wavelength-dependent (instead of the
familiar absorption line, we now have an ampliﬁcation line), one may expect that
(6.37) deﬁnes one or several spectral ranges where the ampliﬁcation coefﬁcient
is sufﬁciently large to achieve light generation. In order to handle this in a more
convenient mathematical way, let us rewrite (6.37) in the more symbolic manner:
|α| = |α(ω)| ≥threshold
(6.40)

138
6
Einstein Coefﬁcients and Quantum Transitions
where the generation threshold according to (6.37) is deﬁned by the reﬂectivity
of the second mirror and the length of the active medium. In general, other loss
mechanisms may also be present in the cavity. In this case, the threshold will be
enhanced, but the general formulation of criterion (6.40) remains the same. Of
course, the threshold value itself may also depend on the frequency.
On the other hand, (6.39) deﬁnes a series of discrete wavelength values that are
equidistant at the frequency scale as long as the refractive index is considered to
be constant (in our case, it is equal to 1 regardless of the frequency). Indeed, from
(6.39) the allowed frequency values may be calculated according to:
ω j = 2cπ
λ j
= j cπ
L
(6.41)
where cπ/L is the line spacing in angular frequency units. Equation (6.41) deﬁnes
the set of allowed so-called longitudinal resonator modes.
The light frequencies that sufﬁce both criteria (6.40) and (6.41) are given by a
set of discrete lines conﬁned to the frequency region deﬁned by (6.40). Figure 6.7
sketches this situation in a simpliﬁed manner.
In practice, because of some Darwinian “survival of the ﬁttest,” a real laser
will not generate light at all these principally allowed frequencies simultaneously;
instead, usually a couple of modes is excited that completely “consume” the pop-
ulation inversion within the active medium. If you wish to prepare ultrashort laser
pulses, a broad frequency spectrum is required, and you need to excite a large
number of equidistant longitudinal modes for this purpose. On the contrary, if you
need highest spectral resolution, it is favorable to let the laser generate at only
one longitudinal mode. Both these extreme situations need special experimental
precautions, and their discussion is beyond the scope of this book.

The Parity Selection Rule
The elaboration of selection rules in terms of (6.19) may be tedious in practice,
because rather uncomfortable integrals may have to be calculated. Fortunately, in
highly symmetric systems, simple selection rules may be obtained from symmetry
considerations. An example for this is the parity selection rule, relevant in systems
with an inversion centrum (centrosymmetric systems).
A formal inversion r →−r results in
ˆH(−r)ψ(−r) = Eψ(−r)
Let us now regard the existence of an inversion center at r = 0. In this case,
we have:
ˆH(r) = ˆH(−r)
The Hamiltonian of such a system commutes with the inversion operator ˆI,
deﬁned by:
ˆI f (r) ≡f (−r)
Indeed
ˆI ˆH(r)ψ(r) = ˆH(−r)ψ(−r) = Eψ(−r)
ˆH(r) ˆIψ(r) = ˆH(r)ψ(−r) = ˆH(−r)ψ(−r) = Eψ(−r)

⇒

ˆI, ˆH

= 0
Therefore, ˆH and ˆI must have a complete system of common eigenfunctions.
Let us have a look at these eigenfunctions and assume that f (r) is an eigenfunction
of ˆI with the eigenvalue I. We ﬁnd:
ˆI f (r) ≡f (−r) = I f (r)
ˆI ˆI f (r) ≡ˆI f (−r) ≡f (r) = ˆI I f (r) = I 2 f (r)

I 2 = 1 ⇒I = ±1 ⇒f (−r) = ± f (r)
Once the eigenfunctions of ˆH must be eigenfunctions of the inversion operator
in centrosymmetric systems, we have two types of wavefunctions:
ψ(−r) =
+ψ(r)
−ψ(r)
In the case ψ(−r) = +ψ(r), we say that the wavefunction has even parity,
while in the case ψ(−r) = −ψ(r), the parity is odd.

Einstein Coefﬁcients and Quantum Transitions
For an electric dipole-allowed transition, from Eq. (6.19) it follows that
dnm ̸= 0
or
dnm = qrnm = q

ψ∗
n (r) rψm(r)dV ̸= 0
Note that r is an odd function itself. Therefore, if both Ψ n and Ψ m are even,
the whole integrand is an odd function, and integration in symmetric integration
limits results in a matrix element that is deﬁnitely equal to zero. The same is valid
of course, if both wavefunctions are odd.
Therefore, in order to excite a dipole transition in a centrosymmetric system,
it is necessary (but not sufﬁcient) that the participating quantum states have a
different parity. This is the essence of the parity selection rule.
6.7
Fermi’s Golden Rule
Let us return to the stuff discussed in Sect. 6.3.2 and use this short section for
deriving a useful expression for the transition rate between two states |l⟩and |m⟩
in the particular case that the perturbation is given by [2]:
ˆV (t) = θ(t) ˆV0
(6.42)
where ˆV0 does not explicitly depend on time. Again, we assume that at t < 0, the
system was deﬁnitely in the state |l⟩. Then, when again making use of the ansatz
(6.12), from (6.19) it follows that

Planck’s Formula and Einstein
Coefﬁcients
Abstract
The discussion of Einstein coefﬁcients is completed by a derivation of corre-
sponding quantum mechanical expressions in the electric dipole approximation.
As a side result, Planck’s formula for blackbody radiation is obtained, and
Bohr’s correspondence principle is introduced. As applications, we discuss
basic physics of lasers and introduce the concept of spectrally selective solar
absorbers.
7.1
Starting Point
Let us now return to our two-level systems, interacting with electromagnetic radi-
ation. In Chap. 6, we have introduced three Einstein’s coefﬁcients that described
the efﬁciency of the three elementary processes of light absorption, spontaneous
light emission, and stimulated light emission. For a quantitative treatment of the
interaction of light with the two-level system, we need, of course, knowledge of
these coefﬁcients. So far, we have found that the Einstein coefﬁcients B12 and B21
are identical (compare (6.7)). What we now need are expressions for the remaining
two coefﬁcients.
We will start with the derivation of a relation between the Einstein coefﬁcients
A21 and B12. To do so, we will discuss the particular case of thermodynamic
equilibrium between radiation and the two-level system. In this case, from (6.6),
(6.7), and (6.25) we have:

Planck’s Formula and Einstein Coefﬁcients
7.2
Physical Idea
In this chapter, we will make use of two different concepts. The ﬁrst one is well
established in physics, namely the basic principle that every macroscopic system—
if it is not externally perturbed—tends to evolve toward a speciﬁc macroscopic
state that is called thermodynamic equilibrium. In thermodynamic equilibrium,
the average occupation of quantum states is controlled by Gibbs factors, and we
will use this circumstance to derive an explicit expression for the spectral energy
density of the electromagnetic radiation in equilibrium conditions. This way we
will obtain what is called Planck’s formula. A comparison with (7.1) will yield a
relation between A21 and B12.
Remark We have introduced the terminus of a macroscopic state here. A detailed
deﬁnition of this concept is beyond the scopes of this book, but it might be intuitively
clear that the description of a macroscopic system built up from some 1023 atoms
in terms of a wavefunction depending on the coordinates of all these atoms would
be a hopeless effort. Therefore, systems consisting of a huge number of particles
are more conveniently described in terms of mean values of physical quantities
characterizing the macroscopic system and its (still macroscopic) subsystems. The
set of the mentioned mean values may then be used to deﬁne the macroscopic state
of a system.
Then, there will be only one Einstein’s coefﬁcient left that needs to be deter-
mined. In the second part of this chapter, we will focus on an independent
derivation of the coefﬁcient A21. As we have discussed in Sect. 6.4, our semiclassi-
cal perturbation treatment of the light–matter interaction is principally insufﬁcient
to deliver this coefﬁcient. So, we need another concept for its derivation. In fact,
we have two choices:
• Starting from Sect. 5.6.3, we can develop a completely quantum mechani-
cal approach of the light–matter interaction. Then, Einstein’s coefﬁcients will
be obtained practically as a side result. This will be the theoretically strong
approach that is included into the Advanced Material Sect. 7.6.2.
• We can make use of an independent concept called the correspondence principle
as postulated by Niels Bohr, which asserts that for sufﬁciently large energies,
the quantum mechanical expressions shall converge to the classical ones.
In our basic treatment, we will use the correspondence principle, which is a useful
and convenient heuristic tool in our semiclassical treatment of the interaction of
light with matter. As mentioned by R.B. Laughlin (A different Universe: Rein-
venting Physics from the Bottom Down; Basic Books, New York (2005)), this
principle is mathematically unprovable. Let us therefore note in this context that
any result obtained in this book by means of the correspondence principle coin-
cides with the corresponding result of a strong quantum mechanical treatment,
while the latter is obtained with much more mathematical effort. This may be

7.3

145
checked by the reader himself when comparing with corresponding textbooks on
quantum mechanics. Thus, we use the correspondence principle as some shortcut
in the derivation procedure only.

Theoretical Considerations
7.3.1
Planck’s Formula
Ansatz
Equation (7.1) describes the spectral density of radiation in equilibrium with an
assembly of two-level systems, held at a temperature T. The purpose of this section
is to independently derive an alternative expression for this spectral density, which
might be compared to Eq. (7.1), and will therefore give us an expression for the
ratio between the coefﬁcients A21 and B21. The formula we will obtain is well
known as the famous Planck’s formula. We start from the deﬁnition (6.1):
u ≡dE
V dω
The energy of the photon ensemble per angular frequency interval may be
expressed as the energy per photon E = èω with an angular frequency ω, mul-
tiplied with the average number of photons (

Np

) expected to be found in the
corresponding quantum state, again multiplied with the number of those quantum
states per angular frequency interval at the relevant frequency (the density of states
dZ
dω ). Hence, we make use of the approach:
dE
dω = ℏω

Np

(7.2)
It is now our task to calculate the single terms encountering into (7.2). Let us
start with the average number of photons

Np

. Note that, in contrast to Sect. 5.6.3,
we use here the symbol Np for the number of photons, in order to avoid confusion
with the quantum number n characterizing states in the box potential.
Planck’s Distribution
In order to obtain an expression for

Np

in the equilibrium case, let us calculate the
energy accumulated in a quantum state when a number of Np photons each with
an energy èω are excited. Obviously, its energy will be Np èω. In equilibrium, the
probability w to ﬁnd the state with Np photons excited is given by Boltzmann’s
factor (to be accurate: for the use of the Boltzmann factor instead of the Gibbs
factor in this particular case, compare [1])

Equation (7.3) is known as the Planck distribution, applicable to systems of
photons. It is a special case of the Bose–Einstein distribution.
Density of States and Planck’s Formula
What remains to determine is the density of states. Let us remember a simple one-
dimensional problem, namely the one-dimensional movement (e.g., along the x-
axis) of a particle between two impermeable walls (Sect. 4.3.3). The corresponding
wavefunctions have already been sketched in Fig. 4.1. We are now however facing
macroscopic dimensions in order to discuss a thermodynamic system. Therefore,
L →∞, and the standing wave picture rather resembles what is shown in Fig. 7.1.
Of course, we will further assume that the propagating “particle” is nothing else
than a photon.
When the separation between the two walls is L, from Sect. 4.3.3 it is known
that the allowed eigenstates of the system correspond to standing waves as shown
in Fig. 7.1, so that the allowed wavelength values become:
λn = 2L
nx
; nx = 1, 2, 3, ...
(7.4)
That corresponds to allowed values of the wavevector:
kx = 2π
λ = πnx

where nx is now a quantum number.
Let us generalize our result to the three-dimensional case. Instead of the system
like shown in Fig. 7.1, we should now imagine a hollow cube with a volume V
= L3 and count the allowed states inside the cube. Accordingly, we obtain for the
wavevector:

Figure 7.2 shows the frequency dependence described by (7.10) for two
different temperatures.
As it is obvious from Fig. 7.2, a body held at a higher temperature emits photons
that have in average a higher frequency (and consequently a higher photon energy)
than those emitted by a body held at a lower temperature. Thus, photons emitted
from the surface of the sun have much higher average energies than those emitted
by the surface of the earth.

Final Expressions for Einstein Coefﬁcients in the Dipole
Approximation
Equation (7.10) describes the spectral density of electromagnetic irradiation in a
hollow cube with walls held at a temperature T in the equilibrium case. Hence, for
any selected angular frequency ω, the absorption of photons caused by the atoms
or molecules of the wall is compensated by the processes of spontaneous and
stimulated emission of photons by the same atoms or molecules. This is exactly
the situation for which (7.1) has been derived. Therefore, comparing (7.1) and
(7.10), we ﬁnd an important relationship between Einstein coefﬁcients, namely:
A21
B21
= ℏω3
π2c3
(7.11)
Therefore, only one of Einstein’s coefﬁcients remains to be determined. In the
forthcoming, we will directly calculate the coefﬁcient A21 making use of the cor-
respondence principle. But before doing so, let us make one remark concerning
(7.11):
Remark The relation between A21 (efﬁciency of spontaneous emission processes)
and B21 (efﬁciency of stimulated processes) turns out to be strongly frequency-
dependent. At low frequencies, the stimulated processes dominate, while at higher
frequencies spontaneous processes become more efﬁcient. The practical conclusion
is that in infrared spectroscopy (low frequencies) one usually investigates stimu-
lated processes (absorption spectroscopy), while in VIS and UV analytics (much
higher frequencies), ﬂuorescence spectroscopy has become an utmost important
spectroscopic tool.
Let us now come to the derivation of A21 in the dipole approximation.
Recalling our knowledge on the structure of Einstein coefﬁcients, from (6.23)
and (7.11) and considering that d = qx we may write:
A21 = C|x21|2
(7.12)

7.3
Theoretical Considerations
149
C is a probably frequency-dependent coefﬁcient, and it may be determined
regarding any special case that is accessible to analytic calculations. Having found
C, we may write down the ﬁnal expression for Einstein coefﬁcients. We choose the
particular case of a harmonic oscillator and calculate the decay rate of the energy
accumulated in the oscillator, when the latter is allowed to dissipate as a result of
the spontaneous emission of photons. From the correspondence principle, we may
write:

The constant C may now easily be found combining (7.13), (7.16), and (7.20).

3ε0πℏc3
So that from (7.12), Einstein’s coefﬁcient A21 is found as (we now replace the

(7.21)
The other coefﬁcients follow from (7.11) and (6.7):
B21 = B12 = π|d21|2
3ε0ℏ2
(7.22)
Expressions (7.21) and (7.22) represent the ﬁnal expressions for Einstein
coefﬁcients in the electric dipole approximation.
Let us make two ﬁnal remarks:
Firstly, our derivation was based on the perturbation operator (6.20), which
describes the electric dipole interaction. Therefore, the resulting Einstein coefﬁ-
cients are only valid in the (electric) dipole approximation. If, for any reason, that
dipole transition is forbidden, nevertheless quantum transitions may occur as the
result of other types of interaction—for example, magnetic dipole interaction. The
corresponding Einstein coefﬁcients may be derived analogously. However, when
the electric dipole transition is allowed, in the nonrelativistic case it is usually
much stronger than the other interaction terms, so that it is often sufﬁcient to regard
this ﬁrst term in the multipole expansion of the interaction of an electromagnetic
wave with matter.
Secondly, in the absence of incident irradiation (u = 0), the population of the
excited quantum state decays according to (compare (6.27)):
N2 = N20e−A21t ≡N20e−t
τ
Therefore, the reciprocal value of A21 may be interpreted as the lifetime of an
excited quantum level. Expression (7.23) enables us to estimate the energy decay
time as introduced in Sect. 2.6 and consequently the natural linewidth as long as
the latter is determined by radiative relaxation processes only.

7.4
Consistency Considerations
151
Indeed, from (7.21) and (6.27), the radiative lifetime of the excited state in a
two-level system in the dipole approximation turns out to be equal to:
τ =
3ε0πℏc3
q2ω3
21|x21|2 = 3ε0πℏc3
ω3
21|d21|2
(7.23)
7.4
Consistency Considerations
For well-allowed dipole transitions in the VIS/UV, (7.24) yields lifetimes of the
order of 10–8–10−9 s. A measurement of these (and even shorter) relaxation pro-
cesses requires the application of ultrafast spectroscopic tools, and it forms an
individual branch of modern spectroscopy.
Note that the mentioned lifetime is of the order of what we have earlier esti-
mated in terms of classical physics (Sect. 2.3.3). On the other hand, the lifetime
becomes inﬁnitively large, when the matrix element of the dipole operator van-
ishes. When we excite (by any means) a quantum level that cannot relax into the
ground state via dipole radiation, then such a state may remain excited for a con-
siderably long time. Of course, this time will be not inﬁnitively large, because in
fact there are still other relaxation channels than the electric dipole irradiation. But
the lifetime may easily extend for minutes or hours, and this is the reason for the
well-known phenomenon of phosphorescence observed in various materials.
It is now interesting to compare (7.24) with its classical counterpart (2.20).
When setting:

= f21,
(7.24)
where f 21 is the oscillator strength as deﬁned in (5.32). Hence, for well allowed
quantum transitions, the oscillator strength may be of the order of 1, and in
this case the classical radiative lifetime and that calculated in terms of quantum
mechanics are of the same order of magnitude. However, the classical lifetime
does not “know” a concept like selection rules, and therefore, in the case of less
allowed or forbidden quantum transitions, the two approaches will deliver quite
different results.
Another interesting conclusion may be drawn from Fig. 7.2. This picture high-
lights the speciﬁc signiﬁcance of the sun for the existence of life on our earth. It
is sometimes believed that the major function of the sun is in delivering energy to
the earth. But if the earth would gain net energy from the sun, the result would
be a global warming, what is rather regarded as a threat for terrestrial (or at least
human) life. In fact, the best living conditions are observed when the earth does

152
7
Planck’s Formula and Einstein Coefﬁcients
not gain energy from the sun: What is gained at daylight should be lost per reradi-
ation from the earth surface all over the day, particularly including the night. But
in order to establish such a balance, the earth must compensate the energy gained
from absorbing a certain number of high-energy photons by emitting a much larger
number of low-energy photons into space. So, the earth emits much more photons
than it absorbs, a process which results in an “export” of entropy [2]. This way
the speciﬁc interaction between sun, earth, and space enables the earth to keep its
entropy low, thus preventing a “thermal dead” on earth, which is absolutely essen-
tial for the existence of life. Of course, the solar system as a whole moves toward
equilibrium this way.

and integral (1.1). Because of the assumed equilibrium, the shape of the cavity is
of no signiﬁcance; the radiation is completely isotropic. At room temperature, we
thus ﬁnd approximately a total of 5.4*108 photons per cubic centimeter.

Black and Gray Bodies: Selective Absorbers
Let us regard a macroscopic object that is incident to electromagnetic radiation
with a spectral ﬂux density Iω deﬁned as:
Iω ≡uc = c
V
dE
dω = cdw
dω
(7.25)

7.5
Application to Practical Problems
153
Why the factor c? Let us try to illustrate this regarding the measurement
units of the corresponding quantities.
We have introduced the energy spectral density in terms of (6.1) as:
u ≡dE
V dω
Its rather exotic measurement unit may be written as [u] = Ws/(m3s−1).
On the other hand, the energy density is deﬁned as:
w = E
V , while [w] = Ws
m3 .
It represents the energy in a unit volume. If multiplied with c, it repre-
sents the energy E penetrating a unit surface normal to the propagation
direction per unit time t. Hence, the ﬂux density wc is obtained as:
wc = c
V E = 1
A
E
t ; [wc] = W
m2
i.e., what we call the ﬂux density here has intensity units. So that gener-
ally, multiplication with c transforms the energy density into an intensity.
The spectral ﬂux density is then
Iω = d(cw)
dω
= cdw
dω
and has the measurement unit:
[Iω] =
W
m2s−1 = Ws
m2
Let us further assume that a part of the incident ﬂux is absorbed in the object. We
deﬁne the absorptance as:
A(ω, T ) ≡Iω,absorbed
Iω,incident
(7.26)
Clearly, the absorptance will also be a function of geometrical parameters, but
we will not focus on this circle of problems. In the case that A(ω, T ) = 1 ∀ω, the
corresponding body will be called a blackbody.
Note that in this case, all incident light is absorbed; hence, no light may be
reﬂected from the object or transmitted through the system. Therefore, in any
illumination conditions, such an object appears to be absolutely black.
In contrast, a gray body will be deﬁned by an absorptance 0 < A < 1 with a
negligible frequency dependence. When restricting for simplicity on objects that

154
7
Planck’s Formula and Einstein Coefﬁcients
are thick enough in order to prevent any light transmission, the amount of light
that is not absorbed in the system (i.e., 1 – A > 0) must be reﬂected. Obviously, 1
−A is frequency-independent as well. When being illuminated with white light,
such an object appears to be gray. Correspondingly, the model system of a white
body does not absorb light at all (A = 0) and appears to be white when being
illuminated with white light.
What about objects with a strongly frequency-dependent absorptance? They
form the class of spectrally selective absorbers. We will discuss some of their
features in Sect. 7.6. In the case that the spectral selectivity concerns the VIS,
spectrally selective absorbers often occur colored when being illuminated with
white light. For illustration, Fig. 7.3 provides some examples. Clearly, the alpine
ﬂowers shown in Fig. 4.6 also belong to the class of spectrally selective absorbers.
We will return to this topic later in Sect. 13.5.2.
For many practical purposes, it is essential to know the amount of energy irra-
diated by a heated surface. If we deﬁne the corresponding spectral ﬂux density
Iω,em in analogy to (7.25), Kirchhoff’s radiation law asserts that
Iω,em(ω, T ) = A(ω, T )Iω,em,BB(ω, T )
(7.27)
Here, Iω,em,BB(ω, T ) represents the spectral ﬂux density irradiated from a cor-
responding blackbody at the same temperature. Kirchhoff’s radiation law is a direct
conclusion from the second law of thermodynamics but will not be derived here.
According to (7.26), a blackbody absorbs all the incident light ﬂux. If a black-
body is in thermal equilibrium with the radiation ﬁeld, emission and absorption
must exactly compensate each other, so that absorbed and emitted energies are
identical. On the other hand, in thermal equilibrium conditions, Planck’s formula
(7.10) holds, such that the energy ﬂux density as emitted from a heated blackbody
will be deﬁned by Planck’s formula. Hence, Iω,em,BB(ω, T ) may be calculated
from Planck’s formula. Therefore, (7.10) is sometimes called Planck’s formula for
blackbody irradiation.
Often, it is of interest to calculate the spectral ﬂux density emitted from a plane
unit surface of a heated body into all directions of the hemispace surrounding the
body. This is done analogously to (7.25), setting:
Iω,em,BB ≡uPlanck
c
4 =

4c2π2

kB T −1
(7.28)
The factor 1/4 has two origins:
• 1/2 arises from the hemispherical emission into the solid angle 2π; emission
into the full solid angle 4π would be twice as large. Note that uPlanck corre-
sponds to equilibrium radiation, which is isotropic and therefore includes all
directions in the full solid angle.
• Another 1/2 arises from integration over the cos-like directional dependence of
the ﬂux irradiated by a Lambertian emitter.

Spectrally Selective Absorbers in Solar Energy Conversion
Let us now return to the earlier introduced spectrally selective absorbers. We will
regard a model situation of a selective absorber that is exposed to incident elec-
tromagnetic radiation with a spectral ﬂux density Iω,incident. By light absorption,
the absorber gains energy, and in our model we will assume that the latter is con-
verted into heat. Of course, the hot absorber emits energy characterized by Iω,em.
The rest of the absorbed energy is used for any useful purpose, for example, heat-
ing of water or the like. Let us assume that the balance of these three mechanisms
results in a stationary absorber temperature TA (Fig. 7.4).
You, dear reader, have already guessed that we are facing the absorber design
for optimizing solar thermal collectors. How can we maximize their output?
We have the absorbed ﬂux density IA:
Iω,absorbed = A(ω, TA)Iω,incident ⇒IA ≡

(7.29)
Let it now be the task to maximize IQ. How could we proceed?
Of course, one possibility would be to increase Iω,incident, for example, by focus-
ing the incident light. However, if we speak on solar energy conversion, this is not
so elementary in geographic regions with a rather cloudy weather, because the
incident radiation is rather diffuse.
Let us therefore have a closer look at the expression in parentheses. Obviously,
as depending on the absorber temperature TA, it may be positive or negative. Let
us identify two disjunct spectral regions, namely [4]:
Iω,incident −ℏω3
4c2π2

Iω,incident −ℏω3

Obviously, both these spectral regions in sum yield the full interval of
frequencies considered in (7.29). Then, (7.29) may be rewritten as:

(7.29a)
For a given absorber temperature and a given incident spectral ﬂux density, IQ
can obviously be maximized by using a spectrally selective absorber that fulﬁlls
the requirement:
A(ω ∈{ω+}, TA) →1
A(ω ∈{ω−}, TA) →0
(7.30)
Note that {ω+} and {ω+} also depend on TA. A selective absorber designed for
a certain temperature may be far from being optimal at another temperature.
Equation (7.30) of course deﬁnes an idealized absorber speciﬁcation, which
cannot be fulﬁlled in practice. Therefore, in solar energy conversion technology,

158
7
Planck’s Formula and Einstein Coefﬁcients
the quality of the absorber is characterized by two independent parameters, char-
acterizing the degree of adherence to (7.30). Of course, Iω,incident has then to be
identiﬁed with the local terrestrial solar spectrum.
So, let us introduce the parameter Asolar(TA) as:

Depending on the absorber temperature, good selective solar absorbers have
A-values well above 0.9, while good E-values at 100 °C are below 0.05.
Of course, solar thermal energy represents only one branch of the full solar
energy conversion scene. Some more ideas on environmentally friendly energy
conversion mechanisms are summarized in Fig. 7.5
7.6.2
Spontaneous Emission Revisited
Let us ﬁnish this chapter by returning to our derivation of the Einstein coefﬁcient
A21, responsible for spontaneous emission of light. So far, we have provided a
rather illustrative derivation based on the correspondence principle. But in fact,

7.6
Advanced Material
159
Fig.7.5 Solar energy conversion in a pupil’s laboratory (= Schülerlabor). Cartoon by Dr. Alexan-
der Stendal. Printed with permission
when drawing together our knowledge from Chaps. 5 to 7, we already have the
necessary tools to provide a stronger derivation [5].
Let us regard a microscopic quantum system (e.g., an atom) interacting with
electromagnetic radiation. For electric dipole interaction, we may write:
ˆV = −ˆd ˆE
(7.31)
In a strong quantum mechanical treatment, the operator of the electric ﬁeld
strength is given by (5.52):
ˆE = A0e−i(ωt−kr) ˆa + A∗
0e−i(ωt−kr) ˆa+
(7.31a)
With (compare (5.61))
|A0|2 =
ℏω
2ε0V
When keeping in mind that the spatial dimensions of a microscopic quantum
system are much smaller than the wavelength of light relevant for today’s pho-
tonic applications, the spatial dependence in the term (7.31a) may be neglected
when calculating the dipole transition matrix element dnl. Then, the perturbation

160
7
Planck’s Formula and Einstein Coefﬁcients
potential “felt” by the atom corresponds to a superposition of terms like earlier
discussed in (6.43).
Let us further assume that before emitting the photon, the material system is
in state |l⟩, while the photon ﬁeld (photon system) is in state |0⟩for any possible
photon mode. The emission of the photon turns the material system into state |n⟩,
while one photon mode becomes excited into state |1⟩. The full system (materials
system + photon system) is therefore in the states:
before emission: |l⟩|0⟩
after emission:
|n⟩|1⟩
From (5.49), we know the only different from zero matrix elements of the
photon creation and annihilation operators. Therefore:
⟨1|ˆa|0⟩= 0
⟨1|ˆa+|0⟩= 1
Consequently, the expression for |Vnl|2 may be written as:
|Vnl|2 =
ℏω
2ε0V |dnl|2
(7.32)
This way our expression for the transition matrix element in the provided quan-
tum mechanical picture is equivalent to the perturbation used in Sect. 6.3.2, when
only accepting that the complex amplitude of the electric ﬁeld is given by (5.61).
This is consistent with our earlier obtained result that in a Fock state with no pho-
ton excited (i.e., the ground state of the regarded photon mode), the electric ﬁeld
is nevertheless different from zero. But having the transition matrix element (7.32)
obtained, we can further proceed in terms of our usual approach earlier developed
in Chap. 6.
The simple expression (7.32) is however only true when the electric ﬁeld
strength vector is parallel to the direction of dipole moment. In general, an aver-
aging over the orientations must be carried out, which requires averaging cos2 θ
over the full solid angle. This results in an additional prefactor given by:

Concerning the density of ﬁnal states ﬁxed in (7.33), so it might not be a priori
clear what is meant by the density of atomic ﬁnal states |n⟩. But at this point, we
must remember that our model treatment of the electric ﬁeld quantization as pro-
vided in Sect. 5.6.3 was restricted to a single mode ﬁeld. In reality, there are many
different photon modes, and we have already counted them, namely in Sect. 7.3.1
(7.9). Then, the density of ﬁnal states to be used in (7.33) turns out to be identical
to the density of modes per photon energy interval the emitted photon “ﬁnds” in
the environment of his place of birth. Therefore,
D(E) = dZ
dE = 1

We thus have:
dw
dt =

dω
Here, dZ
dω represents the density of photon modes (states) at the emission angular
frequency ω. From (7.9), we know:
dZ
dω = V ω2

Consequently,
dw
dt =

3ℏε0V |dnl|2 dZ
dω =
πω
3ℏε0V |dnl|2V ω2
c3π2 = ω3|dnl|2
3ℏπε0c3
which coincides with (7.21).
Is there a possibility to understand the identity of the density of the photon
states with the density of atomic ﬁnal states |n⟩in terms of an illustra-
tive picture? I think there is. The full quantum state of the regarded atom
is not only described by the excitation state of its electrons, but also by
the propagation movement of its mass center. The latter contributes a
term like (4.5) (of course in a 3D version) to the full wavefunction |n⟩.
According to Sect. 3.5.3, as a result of momentum conservation, any emit-
ted photon provides a recoil momentum to the atom that is antiparallel to
the wavevector of the photon. That means, all photon modes correspond-
ing to a different wavevector direction will give rise to different recoil
momentum directions of the atom that has emitted a photon, while the
total energies of all these ﬁnal states |n⟩are identical.
Note that the same type of discussion may be applied to photon
modes that differ in light polarization, when taking angular momentum
conservation into account.

Planck’s Formula and Einstein Coefﬁcients
This is by the way a good illustration of the general principle that energy
conservation alone is not sufﬁcient to make an optical transition allowed.
Momentum and angular momentum conservation are important as well.
In the forthcoming chapters, we will therefore sometimes make use of
conservation laws in order to understand the physical essence of selection
rules for optical transitions we will obtain in different physical systems.
And this is a good time to change to the discussion of the quantum
mechanics of single atoms, because this will give us the tools to under-
stand the internal structure of atomic quantum states that we have simply
called |n⟩so far.

The Hydrogen Atom
Abstract
We discuss the basic properties of the hydrogen atom. The treatment contains
both the simple Bohr theory and a nonrelativistic quantum mechanical treat-
ment, regarding the hydrogen atom as a particular case of a two-body system. In
this context, basic aspects of the quantum mechanical treatment of the angular
momentum are introduced. Finally, the electron spin is introduced.
8.1
Starting Point
So far, in the previous chapters we have introduced basic concepts of quantum
mechanics and developed a quantitative semi-classical picture of the interaction
of electromagnetic radiation with a material quantum system. Thereby, emphasis
has been placed on the simplest quantum mechanical model, namely the two-level
system.
In fact, this way we have already collected a lot of knowledge. We have been
able to calculate the probability of quantum transitions in a quantum system as
caused by its electric dipole interaction with light in terms of a perturbation
approach. Particularly, we found out that the resonance frequencies depend on
the position of the energy level in the discussed material system (6.16). The tran-
sition probability turned out to crucially depend on the numerical value of the
matrix elements of the perturbation operator (6.18). For calculating the latter, the
wavefunctions of the unperturbed material system must be known. The good news
is that we have a recipe to calculate wavefunctions and energy levels: The “only”
thing we have to do is to solve the Schrödinger equation.
So far, we have calculated energy levels and the relevant matrix elements for
two model systems, namely the particle in the box potential and the harmonic
oscillator. These are important model systems, but they are insufﬁcient for a quan-
titative treatment of most of the real material systems that are surrounding us.

Therefore, in the next chapters, we have to focus on solving the Schrödinger
equation for more complicated model systems that are able to reﬂect important
speciﬁcs of atoms, molecules, and solids. So that we are now focusing on what
may be called the “structure of matter.”
This is what we will be doing starting from this chapter. The bad news is that
in the next chapters, we will basically be involved in rather complicated quantum
mechanical calculations. But we have to obtain knowledge about energy levels
and wavefunctions, before making use of them for understanding the speciﬁcs of
the interaction of light with atoms, molecules, and solids. The goal is to calculate
characteristic resonance frequencies and transition probabilities, or at least basic
selection rules for electric dipole interaction.
We have now formulated the general roadmap. Let us now start from the
simplest kind of atom, namely the hydrogen atom. Why?
First of all, the hydrogen atom is the only atom that is composed from two
particles only, namely the nucleus (usually a proton) and one electron. It is thus
an example of a two-body system (Sect. 2.3.1).
But it is not only the simplicity of the atom itself that makes it an important
model system. To our knowledge, hydrogen is the atom with the highest abundance
in the universe. Moreover, it is the atom with the highest abundance in the human
body (Fig. 8.1).
8.2
Physical Idea
Thus, the hydrogen atom consists of one negatively charged electron (q = –e) and
a positively charged nucleus (q = +e). The electron and the nucleus are interacting
through an attractive Coulomb potential according to:
U(r) = −

4πε0

r
(8.1)

Physical Idea

In the case that the nucleus has the charge Ze, where Z is the atomic order,
instead of (8.1) we have:
U(r) = −
1
4πε0
Ze2
r
(8.2)
(8.2) corresponds to the potential energy of the remaining electron in a (Z-1)-
times ionized atomic core of atomic order Z. Any two-body system built up from
a single electron bound to a positively charged nucleus will further be called a
hydrogen-like atom (or ion).
In a classical mechanical picture, r is the distance between the electron and
the nucleus. The potential is only dependent on the distance between nucleus and
electron; hence, it describes a central ﬁeld (Fig. 8.2).
In such situations, instead of using Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z), the use of
spherical coordinates (r,ϕ,θ) is favored. In a quantum mechanical picture, r will
then correspond to the radial coordinate in the wavefunction of the electron, while
the origin of the coordinate system is again in the mass center of the system.
It is reasonable assuming that the potential energy is zero in the case that
nucleus and electron are separated by an inﬁnitely large distance. Note further
that U < 0 for any ﬁnite distance r. That means that quantum states corresponding
to an electron that is bound to the nucleus must have negative energies. Positive
electron energies correspond to electrons that can leave the nucleus with a ﬁnite
kinetic energy.
Practically, we will use two approaches to calculate the energy levels corre-
sponding to bound electron states. We will start with a short derivation of the
Bohr’s theory, before building a stringent (but nonrelativistic) quantum mechan-
ical theory that provides the solution of Schrödinger’s equation for a particle in
the potential (8.1) or (8.2). This treatment is theoretically strong, but not very
illustrative. The Bohr’s theory, instead, is very illustrative: It merges the idea of
the classical movement of a particle in a central ﬁeld with a simple quantization
condition like that illustrated in Figs. 4.1 or 7.1. The basic idea of the classical

170

movement has already been explained in Sect. 2.4: We assume a motion on a
nearly circular orbit, such that Coulomb and centrifugal force compensate each
other.
8.3
Theoretical Considerations
8.3.1
Bohr’s Theory
In this section, we will discuss the simplest version of that problem, namely
the movement of the electron around the nucleus on a circular orbit. Then, the
Coulomb force and the centrifugal force should be equal to each other by absolute
value.
In fact, we are now dealing with a two-body system as introduced in Chap. 2.
So we consider our two-body system built from one nucleus and one electron as
a single rotor with reduced mass μ. Now, because of the uncertainty relation, we
cannot ﬁx both coordinates and momentum of the mass center as this was done in
(2.8a), but for our further treatment it is sufﬁcient to choose a coordinate system
where ˙R = 0, such that (2.9) holds. From (8.2) we have:

(8.3)
Here v is the velocity of the rotor on the circular orbit with radius r, while μv2

is the centrifugal force acting on the electron. Because of ˙R = 0, from (8.3) and
(2.9) we have:
μv2 = 2Tkin =

Let us now return to (7.4). It deﬁnes a quantization condition, where an integer
multiple of the wavelength ﬁts exactly into the path corresponding to one loop in
a cavity as visualized in Fig. 7.1. Hence, we had there:
′′path′′ = nλ (n = 1, 2, 3, . . .)
Instead of the linear geometry postulated in (7.4), we now have a circular orbit.
When generalizing (7.4) to this case by replacing the full path by the circumference
of the orbit and using (3.11) (Fig. 8.3), we have:
2πr = nλ = n h
p ⇒rp = L = n h

Bohr’s radius. It is dependent on the relevant reduced mass and, as we have
already calculated in Sect. 1.3, approximately equal to

It is obviously related to the spatial extension of an atom (compare also Table
1.1). As it follows from (8.7), only discrete values of electron radii are allowed in
Bohr’s theory of the hydrogen atom. They deﬁne orbits that are postulated to be
stable, i.e., the electrons may “move” on these orbits without loosing energy by

experience.

Equation (8.9) deﬁnes a set of discrete energy levels. The energy approaches
zero if n approaches inﬁnity. If the energy would become positive, the electron
would no more be bound to the nucleus and move away, thus leaving the “ion-
ized” nucleus alone. The positive energies of the electron would no more form a
discrete spectrum of allowed energy values, but a continuous energy spectrum in
accordance with what we know about a free electron (Sect. 4.3.2).

Traditionally, the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom is separated in dif-
ferent series, depending on the ﬁnal level m in the transition n→m. We have (see
Table 8.1, Fig. 8.4).
Thus, the Bohr theory of the hydrogen atom allows predicting the frequencies
(or wavelength) of the emission spectrum of hydrogen atoms, which have been
found to be in an excellent agreement with the experiment. This is a ﬁrst utmost
important consistency check of this theory. Note in particular that the emission
frequencies are dependent on the reduced masses, i.e., are slightly different for

different isotopes. This gives rise to what is called the isotopic shift and historically
resulted in the observation of different isotopes.
Concerning the intensities of the lines, so according to (6.3) and (7.21), the
population of the energy levels as well as the transition matrix elements have to
be known in order to predict them. However, so far no wavefunctions have been
calculated, and consequently, we have no tool in hand to calculate the intensities.
This provides the motivation for the development of a stronger quantum mechan-
ical theory that should provide us with explicit expressions for the wavefunctions
of the electrons in different eigenstates.
It is however possible to guess the relative number of electrons that may
occupy a “shell” concerned with the quantum number n. This might be
of signiﬁcance in atoms with more than one electron. Let us develop the
following illustration for that. Already from Fig. 8.3, it appears reasonable
assuming that quantum states with a larger n correspond to orbits with a
larger radius and correspondingly a larger circumference. In the 3D case
that means that the surface area of the corresponding orbits is increasing,
and consequently, orbits with a larger n should have the capacity to accept

174
8
The Hydrogen Atom
more electrons than those with a smaller n. Indeed, from (8.6) we have:
2πr = nλ ⇒rn = nλ
2π ⇒r1 = λ
2π
Here we made the unrealistic assumption that all orbits are circular, but
this simpliﬁcation does not destroy the qualitative picture. The assumed
spherical surface A corresponding to the ground state (n = 1) orbital has
an area A1:
A1 = 4πr2
1 = λ2
π
Let us assume that it may be occupied by a number of Z1 electrons. Then,
each electron occupies an area of
Ae =
λ2
Z1π
For the other orbitals n > 1, we have the area An:
rn = nλ
2π ⇒An = 4πr2
n = n2λ2
π
= n2 A1 = n2Z1Ae
It is now reasonable assuming that the number of electrons Zn that may
occupy the nth orbital is:
Zn = An
Ae
= n2Z1 ⇒Zn
Z1
= n2
This illustration leads to the “guess” that with increasing quantum number
n, the number of electrons which ﬁt into this orbital increases by a factor
n2.

where the potential energy is given according to (8.1) or (8.2). Thus, in our further

taken into account.

(8.27)
(The Y m

als). This way, the eigenvalues of ˆL2 are given in terms of the angular momentum
quantum number l by:
ˆL2 = ℏ2l(l + 1)
(8.28)
Let us now investigate the projection of the angular momentum on the z-axis.

(8.29)
What are the eigenfunction and eigenvalues of ˆLz? The eigenvalue problem is:
ˆLzψ = −iℏ∂
∂φ ψ = lzψ ⇒ψ = eiβφ ⇒βℏ= lz
(8.30)
The periodicity requirement yields: ψ = eiβφ = eiβ(φ+2π) ⇒2βπ =
2mπ; m = 0, ±1, ±2, ...
⇒lz = βℏ= ℏm
(8.30a)
Once the projection of L should not be larger that the full length of L, we have
the constraint:
−l ≤m ≤l
(8.30b)
m is called the magnetic quantum number.
With an increasing value of the angular momentum quantum number l, the
corresponding orbitals are named as s- (l = 0), p- (l = 1), d- (l = 2), f- (l = 3),…
orbitals.

How to memorize these letters? Unfortunately, the recommended
mnemonic trick is only efﬁcient for german students: For
l = 0, 1, 2, 3. we have the orbitals :
s, p, d, f Let us now focus on the ﬁrst three letters
From left to right this reads as “SPD”, a german political party. In the
reverse direction, we have the “FDP” which is another political party in
Germany. I cannot guarantee that this trick will work in future.
Table 8.2 shows the ﬁrst order spherical functions:

Fig. 8.5.
Let us try to develop a classical illustration on the physical origin of the orbital
shapes shown in Fig. 8.5. Of course, in an s-orbital, the classical angular
momentum of the electron would be zero, and thus there would be no centrifu-
gal force counteracting the Coulomb attraction. Therefore, in classics there is no
orbit corresponding to an s-orbital, instead, the existence of a stable 1 s-orbital

Fig.8.5 Illustration of s- and p-orbitals
rather has to be understood as a consequence of Heisenberg’s uncertainty rela-
tion (compare also Chap. 5 task 5.7.9 in this regard). The uncertainty relation
in application to point particles has no classical analog, and therefore, we have
to accept stable s-orbitals as a purely quantum- (or wave-) mechanical effect.
But if so, if it is the uncertainty relation that forces the s-electron to keep a
certain distance from the nucleus, then—keeping in mind the central symmetry
of the Coulomb potential—there is absolutely no reason to assume that there
is an angular dependence in the probability to detect the electron in a certain
space region. Therefore, the electron can be observed in any unit element of
the solid angle with the same probability, which is the reason for the spherical
symmetry of the s-orbital.
For p-states, the situation is somewhat different, and a classical illustration may
be provided. Let us look at the pz orbital in Fig. 8.5. It corresponds to the
probability density Y 0∗
1
∗Y 0
1 ∝cos2 θ. Hence, the probability to observe the
electron in a unit element of the solid angle should be largest at θ = 0 or π,
while it is smallest at θ = π/2. This is visualized by the special dumbbell-like
shape of the pz orbital in Fig. 8.5.
How to understand this behavior? Have a look at Fig. 8.6. It shows a classical
electron moving on a circular orbit in a clockwise direction such that the angular

momentum is directed perpendicular to the z-axis, hence Lz = 0. What we have
illustrated here is therefore the classical analogon to an electron in a pz-orbital.
The rest should be clear from the ﬁgure. Random snapshots of the classical
electron moving on a circular orbit with a constant angular velocity will observe
the electron rather often nearby the extremal z values (θ = 0 or π), but rather
seldom around z = 0 (θ = π/2). In principle, this simple consideration explains
the shape of pz in Fig. 8.5.
Note that ˆL2 commutes with each of its projections, but neither of the projections
commutes with another one. Hence:

An ansatz which combines both the dominant exponential decay at large r as
well as the power-law dependence at small r could be of the type:
χ ∝χ(r →0)χ(r →∞) ∝rl+1e−κr ⇒R ∝rle−κr
(8.39)
Equation (8.39) provides a ﬁrst guess on the mathematical structure of the
solution R. We will therefore use the ansatz:
Ansatz for eachr : R(r) = u(r)e−κr
(8.40)
where u(r) is a polynomial of r. From (8.33) and (8.2) we have:

Remark From (8.42), it is rather easy to obtain the ground state wavefunction of
the hydrogen atom directly. We start from analyzing the ansatz:
u = b0 + b1r + b2r2 + ... + bn−1rn−1
(8.43)
Substituting (8.43) into (8.42), and performing a comparison of coefﬁcients,
results in a system of equations for the coefﬁcients bj. Particularly, for the term
proportional to rn−2 we get:
2(n −1)bn−1(−κ) + 2bn−1(a −κ) = 0 ⇒a = nκ if bn−1 ̸= 0.

n2 = −

8πε0

n2 = −Ry
n2
Which obviously coincides with (8.9). The ground state corresponds to the lowest
energy; hence, it corresponds to n = 1. So that the radial part of the hydrogen atoms
ground state wavefunction according to (8.40) and (8.43) is given by:
u = b0 = const.; R(r) = b0e−κr = b0 e−r
a0
Moreover, from (8.38) and (8.43) it follows that for a given value of n, the angular
momentum quantum number l must be smaller than n. Therefore, we have to set l
= 0 in the hydrogen atoms ground state. According to n = 1 and l = 0, the ground
state is also called a 1 s-state. The proportionality constant b0 (compare Table 8.3)
follows from the normalization requirement of the full wavefunction.
The method is applicable to the 2 s-state (n = 2 and l = 0) as well. In order to
sufﬁce (8.38) and (8.43), let us now set:
R(r) = u(r)e−κr with u = (b0 + b1r); du
dr = b1; d2u
dr2 = 0
From (8.42) we have:

Which obviously coincides with the 2 s-wavefunction (Table 8.3) except the

According to (8.38) and (8.43), for the 2p-state (n = 2 and l = 1) one has to
choose the ansatz: R(r) = u(r)e−κr with u = b1r;
du
dr = b1; d2u
dr2 = 0 and l = 1.
This quickly results in E = −Ry
4 and κ =

Therefore, each of the energy levels deﬁned by (8.9) or (8.44) is degenerated
for n2 times (the earlier mentioned spin degeneration is not taken into account
here).
Remark The degeneration factor gn = n2 is easily calculated from (8.45), setting

The Hydrogen Atom
The ﬁnal radial wavefunctions R are given by Laguerre polynomials according
to the Table 8.3 (after Demtröder).

Consistency Considerations
8.4.1
Characteristic Spatial Dimensions of the Hydrogen Ground
State
So far we have presented a simple version of the Bohr theory, followed by the
development of a quantum mechanical treatment of an electron in the Coulomb
potential. We have already mentioned that the Bohr theory provides predictions
of emission frequencies that are in excellent agreement to the measurements.
Once the quantum mechanical treatment as provided so far results in the same
predictions for the hydrogen energy levels, everything seems to be consistent.
On the other hand, in our quantum mechanical treatment that operates in terms
of the wavefunction, the electrons distance from the nucleus is no more a ﬁxed
parameter, but obeys a certain probability density. As an example of a consistency
check, let us consider the ground state of the hydrogen atom, according to (Table
8.3):

After integrating over the angles, we obtain the probability to observe the

Thus, although the electron in the ground state may be found at different dis-
tances from the nucleus, the corresponding probability density is largest at the
Bohr radius, which is a quite reasonable result (compare also Table 1.1).

8.4

This distance, which corresponds to a maximum of the probability density, must
not be confused with the expectation value of r. Indeed, in the ground state, from

The Hydrogen Atom
Remark From here a shortcut for re-deriving the formulas for the Rydberg energy
as well as Bohr’s radius may be obtained. Indeed, in the hydrogen atom ground state,
we have n = 1 and E1 = -Ry. Let us now start from the idea that < Tkin,1 > = Ry and
< U1 > = -2 Ry, which is in full analogy to the classical considerations presented in
Sect. 8.3.1, formula (8.4). Making use of the plausible formula:
⟨U1⟩= −
e2
4πε0a0
we ﬁnd:
⟨U1⟩= −
e2
4πε0a0
= −2Ry ⇒Ry =

.
On the other hand, from Bohr’s quantization rule we have another plausible
expression:

Hence,

Remark Note by the way that (8.9) is also valid for anti-hydrogen atoms that are
built from a positron and an antiproton. Indeed, it should be only the product of the
charges of the two constituents that matters. As an experimental fact, anti-hydrogen
has the same emission spectrum as normal hydrogen atoms have. This is even true
for the so-called ﬁne structure (see later Sect. 8.6.1) of the hydrogen energy levels
[3].
8.4.3
Highly Excited Hydrogen-Like Atoms
Let us ﬁnally have a closer look at Bohr’s quantization rule (8.6). Together with
(8.7) and (8.9) it results in the couple of equations:
L = nℏ
rn = n2
Z a0
En = −Ry Z2
n2

8.4
Consistency Considerations
191
Obviously, in the Bohr’s theory, n must be different from zero, and therefore, L
must be different from a zero-vector as well. There is consequently no s-orbital in
this simple (and any classical) approach. So what is the relation between Bohr’s
quantization rule and the quantum mechanical result (8.28):
ˆL2 = ℏ2l(l + 1)??
Let us regard the case of the largest possible l-values, namely l = l max = n-1.
In this case, from (8.39), (8.40), and (8.43) we have the radial part of the
wavefunction according to:
R ∝rlmaxe−κr = rn−1e−r
na0
This function has only one maximum, and therefore, the corresponding orbit
can be regarded as the analogon to a classical circular orbit.
Let us have a short look at the function r2|R|2. It is again proportional to
the probability density to observe the electron at the distance r from the nucleus.
Differentiating this expression quickly shows that this probability has its maximum
at r = n2a0. In order to visualize r2|R|2 for different n, it makes sense to normalize
it to its maximum value, which may be set to be equal to one. Hence we look at
the function f (x) deﬁned by
r2|R|2 →

f (x) = x2ne−2x

which has a maximum at x = n2 with f
	
x = n2
= 1. Figure 8.7 shows f (x) for
different values of the principal quantum number n. Obviously, at large principal
quantum numbers, the probability to observe the electron close to the nucleus is
rather vanishing.
At the same time, for l = l max = n-1, (8.28) yields:
ˆL2 = ℏ2n(n −1)

The Hydrogen Atom
For large values of n, we obtain

n→∞→ℏ2n2
Which is obviously equivalent to Bohr‘s quantization rule. Therefore, quantum
states with a large principal quantum number n and a maximum possible angular
quantum number l come closest to the circular orbits we have regarded in the
Bohr’s theory.
In case of a hydrogen atom, assuming l= n -1 and ﬁnally investigating the case
of highly excited electronic states (n→∞), from Table 8.4 we quickly ﬁnd:

Even in higher order atoms, the wavefunction of a highly excited single elec-
tron has practically no spatial overlap with the orbits of the remaining (not excited)
electrons (Fig. 8.7). Therefore, its energy levels are in well correspondence to (8.9).
Atomic single electron excitation states corresponding to n>>10 are therefore
called Rydberg states.
Such that in a Rydberg state with maximum l, the electrons orbit comes closest
to the classical idea of a circular orbit with a well-deﬁned radius. This convergence
may be regarded as a special realization of the already mentioned correspondence
principle.

Application to Practical Problems
8.5.1
Rigid Spherical Rotor
Let us use the possibility to discuss—quasi by the way—another simple but impor-
tant model system, namely the rigid rotor. A classical rigid rotor is a particle that
moves in a way that it always has the same distance from a ﬁxed center. In our
two-body system, that center coincides with the mass center, while the mass of this
particle coincides with the reduced mass of the two bodies. We therefore again start
from (2.9) and demand that r = const (compare (2.11)).
Let us now write down the eigenenergies of a rigid spherical rotor. From the
Schrödinger equation for the radial part of the wavefunction of a particle in a
central ﬁeld, from (8.24) we have:

For a rigid rotor, we require: r = const →U(r) = const; ˆp2
r = 0. We then have

According to (8.26) or (8.30a), the degeneration of each of these energy levels
is 2 l + 1.
The term ℏ2l(l+1)
2I
in (8.48) describes the rotational energy levels Erot(l) of a
rigid rotor.
Remark It might seem that the conditions r = const and ˆp2
r = 0 could cause
problems with respect to the uncertainty relation. But there should be no problem.
First of all, the position and momentum of the “ﬁxed center” (here the mass center)
itself must sufﬁce the uncertainty relation, such that coordinate and momentum of
the rigid rotor are also never ﬁxed at the same time. Concerning the observables r
and p2
r , let us for simplicity discuss the 1D case and return to task 5.7.2 from Chap. 5.
A commutator like

Our requirements of r = const and ˆp2

But what about our central topic, the interaction of a rigid rotor with light?
We have found the energy levels, but have no idea on transition matrix elements
or selection rules. Clearly, the matrix elements might be calculated from (6.18)
making use of the spherical functions (8.26) or Table 8.2. This procedure, dear
reader, may be found in other textbooks on quantum mechanics. We will here
rather guess the selection rules, by making use of the short cut provided by

194
8
The Hydrogen Atom
the correspondence principle. We will require, that for highly excited rotational
states, quantum mechanical (QM) and classical (class) transition frequencies and
rotational energies shall coincide.
Let us this way answer the question, in how far emission or absorption of light
may change the quantum number l by a value of 
l. We then have for highly
excited rotational quantum states:
l →∞⇒ωQM →ωclass;
ωQM = Erot,QM(l + 
l) −Erot,QM(l)

Consequently,

When comparing with:

We ﬁnd the selection rule:

l = ±1
(8.49)
Hence, absorption or emission of light changes the rotational quantum number
by an absolute value of one.
8.5.2
Particle in a Spherical Box Potential
Let us now discuss another model system, namely a particle conﬁned in “spherical
potential box.” In contrast to the simple model task discussed in Sect. 4.3.3, we
now have a 3D situation with the potential:
U = 0; 0 ≤r ≤a
U →∞;
r > a

8.5
Application to Practical Problems
195
The task is nevertheless simple when we restrict on s-states. In an s-state, l = 0,
and the angular part of the wavefunction is simply a constant, so that ψ = ψ(r).
Therefore, the application of the angular part of the Laplacian to the wavefunction
gives no contribution, and we only have to consider its radial part. From (8.33)
and l = 0 we therefore have the Schrödinger equation:

Electron Spin and Spin–orbit Interaction
Let us start from two experimental results:
Experimental Fact (1st Peculiarity): A beam of silver atoms in their ground state (l
= 0) propagating through a gradient magnetic ﬁeld splits off into two parts (Stern–
Gerlach experiment). Note that the degeneracy of states with a given l is 2 l + 1

8.6
Advanced Material
197
(number of projections of the angular momentum on the z-axis); i.e., it is an odd
number whenever l is integer.
The splitting obviously indicates that the angular momentum of the silver
valence electron is different from zero—although it is in an s-state. In order to
interpret the experimental ﬁndings one had to assume that the electron has—in
addition to its angular momentum arising from its orbital movement around the
nucleus—some internal momentum that was called its spin. An even number of
projections would only be possible, if the corresponding angular momentum (i.e.,
the electron spin S) would be characterized by a half-integer quantum number s
= 1/2 with projections on the z-axis according to:

Consequences
Fine Structure of Hydrogen Energy Levels
In a strong sense, the ﬁne structure of hydrogen energy levels is a relativis-
tic effect and would need the application of relativistic quantum mechanics. This
is clearly beyond the frames of this course. The following argumentation there-
fore has to be understood rather as an illustration of the nature of the effect, but
nevertheless we can learn a lot from that.
The ﬁne structure of the hydrogen atoms energy levels arises from the inter-
action of the electrons spin magnetic and orbital magnetic momenta (spin–orbit
interaction). Indeed, the interaction operator ˆVls describing the potential energy
Uls of the electrons spin magnetic moment dmagn,s in the magnetic ﬁeld Bl caused
by its movement on the orbit is given by:
Uls = −dmagn,sBl ∝Ze2
r3 SL
(8.56)
⇒ˆVls ∝ˆS ˆL
(8.56a)
Here, ˆS is the operator of the electron spin.
Remark Let us have a short look at the origin of the r−3 dependence. If we change
to a coordinate system where the electron is at rest, we will observe that it is circled

by the nucleus with a charge Ze at a distance r. Then, the movement of the nucleus
generates a magnetic ﬁeld acting on the electron that is given by [4]:
Bl = −μ0Ze
4π
r × v
r3
= −μ0Ze
4πme
L
r3 .
Then, by using
Uls = −dmagn,sBl
and (8.55), we obtain (8.56).
Equation (8.56) describes a coupling of the orbital and spin magnetic momenta.
We therefore introduce the operator of the total (orbit and spin) angular momentum
of a single electron ˆJ as:
ˆJ = ˆL + ˆS
(8.57)
We will require that ˆJ obeys the typical quantization rules of an angular momen-
tum. Thus we have eigenvalues of ˆJ2 equal to ℏ2 j( j + 1). Because of the two
possible projections of the single electron spin, in a hydrogen atom we can ﬁnd
the following possible quantum numbers j:
l > 0 : j = l −1
2; l + 1
2
l = 0 : j = 1
2.
(8.57a)
This is a special case of angular momentum summation in quantum mechanics.
We will shortly introduce the general case later in Sect. 9.2.
In order to investigate the structure of the scalar product SL, we now make use
of
ˆJ2 =

ˆL + ˆS
2
⇒ˆL ˆS = 1


ˆJ2 −ˆL2 −ˆS2
Let us at the moment postulate the existence of common eigenfunctions of the
operators ˆS2, ˆJ2, ˆL2 (see task 8.7.10 of this chapter) and the Hamiltonian of the
relativistic hydrogen atom. Then, when operating on these joint eigenfunctions, we
may apply the following substitution:
ˆL ˆS = 1


ˆJ2 −ˆL2 −ˆS2
→1
2ℏ2[ j( j + 1) −l(l + 1) −s(s + 1)]
(8.58)
For l > 0, according to (8.56), (8.57a), and (8.58) any energy level given by
(8.9) splits off into two components, deﬁning the ﬁne structure of energy levels
caused by the spin–orbit interaction. The corrections to the energy levels may be

. The latter is provided in Table 8.4 and contributes a further Z3-term. Thus,
together with (8.56), we have a Z4-dependence of the spin–orbit interaction. The
full proportionality factor (let us call it a) in (8.56a) is proportional to the square
of the ﬁne-structure constant and the Rydberg energy of the corresponding state
according to (note the structural similarity to

(8.59)
The appearance of the ﬁne-structure constant α (compare (8.13)) in (8.59) is a
manifestation of the relativistic nature of the effect.
Remark In a weak external time-independent magnetic ﬁeld, the coupling between
spin and orbital magnetic momenta remains preserved. Then, each energy level
deﬁned by j splits off into 2j + 1 sublevels with a gyromagnetic factor deﬁned
by a speciﬁc quantity called the Lande factor. In an emission spectrum, this splitting
of the energy terms leads to a multiplicity of spectral lines, giving rise to what is
called the anomalous Zeeman effect.
In a strong external magnetic ﬁeld, however, the spin–orbit coupling is destroyed
(Paschen Back effect), and the introduction of J makes no more sense. Then, orbital
and spin magnetic momenta align to the external ﬁeld separately, and no anomalous
Zeeman effect is observed anymore.
Nomenclature: Let us mention in this context the usual nomenclature for charac-
terizing atomar electronic states. In order to indicate the quantum numbers n,j,l,
and s, the following writing is accepted:
n2s+1X j; X = S, P, D, F according tol = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..
The term 2 s + 1 indicates the number of possible spin orientations. In a hydro-
gen atom, s = 1/2 and 2 s + 1 = 2, indicating two possible spin projections. In
higher order atoms, the full spin may be larger.
8.6.2
Spinors and Pauli Matrices
The experimental facts mentioned at the beginning of the previous section indicate
that an electron has—besides its spatial degrees of freedom—an additional degree
of freedom that allows accepting only two values: spin “up” and spin “down”
(Fig. 8.8). The corresponding wavefunctions are formally written as |↑⟩and |↓⟩.

As an example, let us apply this knowledge to the case of a system built from
two electrons. For simplicity, we will restrict to the particular case of a state, where
both spins are directed upwards (i.e., along the positive z-axis). We write the spin
wavefunction as:

We have now to introduce two sets of Pauli matrices, each acting on one of the
spins. Hence, σ(1) acts on the spin coordinates of the ﬁrst electron and σ(2) on
the second. We now have (compare (8.57)):

Remarks on Selection Rules for Optical Transitions (Electric
Dipole Interaction)
When neglecting any magnetic interactions, the basic selection rules for an electron
in a central ﬁeld may be written as:

n −arbitrary

l = ±1

ms = 0

m =
'
0; linear light polarization
±1; circular light polarization
(8.67)
Hereby, the selection rules concerning n, l, and m may be obtained from a direct
calculation in terms of (6.18) and (6.19) using electric dipole interaction as per-
turbation and unperturbed wavefunctions like those given in Table 8.3. Moreover,
we recognize the selection rule (8.49) 
l = ±1, which we have derived from
the correspondence principle for the special case of a rigid rotor. Contrarily to
the electron, a photon has an integer spin sphot = 1 and, therefore, (8.49) can be
interpreted as a consequence of angular momentum conservation.
The condition on ms arises from the fact that the electron spin does not couple
to the electric ﬁeld of the light wave. The mentioned selection rules ﬁnd practical
application in the Paschen–Back effect (see task 8.7.11). Here, because of the
strong external magnetic ﬁeld, the electronic spin–orbit coupling is destroyed, and
the applied external static (i.e., time-independent) magnetic ﬁeld does not cause
quantum transitions.
The selection rules are modiﬁed when spin–orbit interaction comes into play
[5, pp. 303–309]. From

We come to the result that the square of the total momentum does not commute
with the z-components of L and S, but with its own z-component. This is a partic-
ular case of the more general situation we will discuss later in Sect. 9.2 (Fig. 9.3
on right). At the moment it is sufﬁcient for us to note that any quantum state with
a well-deﬁned ˆJ2 may also have a well-deﬁned value of its z-component.
Therefore, in the presence of spin–orbit interaction, the selection rules are
formulated in terms of j and the corresponding magnetic quantum number mj,
which characterizes the eigenvalues of ˆJz. Additionally, from angular momentum
conservation, we still have:

l = ±1
The corresponding selection rules for j may be written as:

 j = 0, ±1 (except j = 0 →j = 0)

m j = 0, ±1 (except 
m j = 0 i f 
 j = 0)
(8.68)
These selection rules may again be derived in terms of (6.18), using so-
called spherical spinors as unperturbed wavefunctions. In short, their appearance
is related to the following combinations of quantum numbers:

 j = ±1 : j = l ± 1
2

l=±1

 j = 0
: j = l ± 1

→

 j = l + 
l ∓1
2
It is nevertheless useful to provide a heuristic illustration of (8.68):
• When accepting that the spin is rather inert with respect to optical tran-
sitions, the selection rule 
 j = ±1 is a direct conclusion from (8.49).
Then, the rule 
m j = 0, ±1 also appears as a direct generalization of
the corresponding expression for 
m = 0, ±1 in (8.67).
• What is new compared to (8.67) is the transition with 
 j = 0 . Once
(8.49) holds, it must be accompanied with a change of the projection of

8.7

205
the electron spin with regard to the direction of the orbital momentum l
(see later Fig. 9.4 for a purely geometrical illustration). One can illustrate
their origin when remembering that the orbital movement of the electron
gives rise to a magnetic ﬁeld Bl that couples to the electron spin according
to (8.56). If, as a result of an optical transition, l is changed in accordance
with (8.49), the magnetic ﬁeld Bl will also change its value. This gives rise
to a time-dependent magnetic perturbation potential, which may cause the
corresponding change in the spin projection relative to L. In this picture,
a magnetic dipole interaction (see (8.56)) is involved, and in fact, the
corresponding spectral lines are weaker than those corresponding to 
 j =
±1 .
• Clearly, if 
 j = 0 , the angular momentum inherent to the absorbed (or
emitted) photon requires that at least the direction of the total momentum
must change. Therefore, 
 j = 0 cannot be accompanied by 
m j = 0 .
As a particular case, j = 0 →j = 0 must be forbidden at all.
The selection rules (8.68) are valid for the anomalous Zeeman effect.

The Helium Atom
Abstract
We provide an approximate treatment of the helium atom as a simple example
of a many-body system. The conﬁguration space is introduced, and conclusions
from the principal indistinguishability of quantum particles are derived. Several
approaches are presented for estimating the ground-state energy of the helium
atom.
9.1
Starting Point
The helium atom consists of one nucleus (Z = 2) and two electrons (Fig. 9.1).
It is an example of a three-body system, where attractive forces are acting
between the nucleus and each of the electrons, while between the two electrons,
we have a repulsive force acting. There exists no general analytical solution to this
problem in classical mechanics, and we cannot expect to ﬁnd an exact solution
of the Schrödinger equation for this system. Hence, we will have to make use of
model simpliﬁcations here. One of them is that we regard the nucleus as ﬁxed and
place the origin of the coordinate system into that nucleus. Then, as it shown in
Fig. 9.1, the position of each of the electrons is characterized by a vector ri, while
in the case of the helium atom, i = 1, 2. In a quantum mechanical language, that
means that each electron in the system contributes three coordinates deﬁning ri
into the set of arguments of the wavefunction .
Note that i is simply a counting index here; because of the later discussed
indistinguishability of the electrons, we cannot “mark” the electrons and distin-
guish them by their number. Instead, a physical state described by “electron 1”
with coordinates r1 and “electron 2” with coordinates r2 is identical to a state
with “electron 1” with coordinates r2 and “electron 2” with coordinates r1.
In terms of a very simpliﬁed treatment, let us for a moment moreover forget
the electron spin and further assume that the repulsive interaction between the two

electrons could be neglected. In this case the Hamiltonian of the system would
look like:
ˆH ≡ˆH(0) = ˆTkin + U = ˆT1 + ˆT2 + U1 + U2
(9.1)
Here, to each of the electrons, we ascribe a kinetic energy T and a potential
energy U, both depending only on the coordinates of the corresponding electron.
Then, (9.1) may be written as:
ˆH(0) = ˆT1 + U1
  
≡ˆH1
+ ˆT2 + U2
  
≡ˆH2
≡ˆH1 + ˆH2
(9.2)
where each of the ˆHi depends only on the coordinates ri of the ith electron. In this
situation, when considering that the wavefunction of the two electrons depends
on the coordinates of both electrons, it is useful to factorize the wavefunction
according to:
ψ(r1, r2)(0) = ψ1(r1)ψ2(r2)
(9.3)
ψ1(r1) and ψ2(r2) will be further called single-particle wavefunctions. Substitut-
ing into the simpliﬁed Schrödinger equation:
ˆH(0)ψ(0) = E(0)ψ(0); ψ(0) = ψ(r1, r2)(0)
(9.3a)
yields:
ˆH(0)ψ(0) =

ˆH1 + ˆH2

ψ1(r1)ψ2(r2) = E(0)ψ1(r1)ψ2(r2)
= ψ2(r2) ˆH1ψ1(r1) + ψ1(r1) ˆH2ψ2(r2)

9.1
Starting Point
211
However, ˆH1 and ˆH2 are nothing else than the Hamiltonians of a single electron
in the central ﬁeld of the nucleus with atomic order Z = 2. Hence, when associat-
ing the single electron wavefunctions ψ1(r1) and ψ2(r2) with the eigenfunctions
of the hydrogen-like atom with the eigenvalues E1 and E2, we immediately ﬁnd:
ˆH(0)ψ(0) = E(0)ψ1(r1)ψ2(r2) = ψ2(r2) ˆH1ψ1(r1) + ψ1(r1) ˆH2ψ2(r2)
= (E1 + E2)ψ1(r1)ψ2(r2)
E(0) = E1 + E2
(9.4)
Hence the Ansatz (9.3) solves the simpliﬁed Schrödinger Eq. (9.3a) provided
that
ψ1(r1) and ψ2(r2) are eigenfunctions of
ˆH1 and
ˆH2, respectively. Then, the
energy levels are given by E(0) = E1 + E2.
Let us apply this knowledge to the ground state of the helium atom E(0)
He,0.
Taking (8.9) into account, we then have:
E(0) = E1 + E2 ⇒E(0)
He,0 = −2Z2Ry = −8Ry = −108.8 eV
(9.5)
In this approximation, the helium atoms ground-state energy is identical to
twice the ground-state energy of a singly ionized He ion, the latter being equal
to −4Ry = −54.4 eV. The result can be veriﬁed experimentally by measuring the
ionization energy of a helium atom, i.e., the energy which must be supplied to a
helium atom such that it gets rid of both electrons when starting from its ground
state. This energy is equal to 78.9 eV as veriﬁed experimentally. From here we
may draw two conclusions:
• The estimated value E(0)
He,0 is of the correct order of magnitude, but nevertheless
very inaccurate. This is obviously caused by neglecting the Coulomb interaction
between the electrons.
• Let us illustrate the process of ionization of the helium atom as a two-step-
process. In the ﬁrst step, one electron (we call it the “ﬁrst” one) leaves the
atom, while the other one (the “second”) still remains in the singly ionized
helium atom. The energy necessary for the second step of ionization, namely
releasing the “second” electron from helium, must be equal to Z2Ry = 4 Ry =
54.4 eV. This is clear from the theory of hydrogen-like atoms, compare (8.9).
Then, when comparing with the experimental total ionization energy, the energy
necessary to release the “ﬁrst” of the helium electrons turns out to be around
24.5 eV only. Obviously, the presence of the “second” electron leads to an
effective reduction of the positive charge of the nucleus, such that the “ﬁrst”
electron may escape with a rather small individual ionization energy. When
setting Z2
effRy = 24.5 eV, we estimate Zeff≈1.342, a value in between the
atomic orders of hydrogen (Z = 1) and helium (Z = 2). This result brings us
to the physical idea that the “second” electron has a screening effect on the
nuclear charge, thus giving rise to the smaller amount of energy necessary for

212

The Helium Atom
performing the ﬁrst ionization step. In the second step, the remaining (“second”)
electron, of course, feels the full charge of the helium nucleus, and needs the
full 4Ry to escape from the nucleus.
In fact the electrons in the helium atom belong to the class of indistinguishable
quantum particles. Therefore, our formal distinction into a “ﬁrst” and “second” is
only a bookkeeping artifact; in reality we have to expect that in a helium atom,
each of the electrons has a screening effect on the other. Within this assumption,
in Sect. 9.3.2, a variation approach will be presented that allows estimating the
helium atom ground-state energy much more accurate than the very simpliﬁed
treatment presented so far.
9.2
Physical Ideas
In the previous chapters, the theoretical treatment was effectively restricted to the
discussion of single-particle systems; i.e., we discussed a single quantum particle
(usually an electron) moving in some potential. Our new topic—the helium atom—
is our ﬁrst example of a many-particle system. Although in our particular case,
“many” means “two,” it is a huge qualitative difference to the single-particle case.
Therefore, several new concepts will have to be taken into account. Consequently,
Sect. 9.4 will be rather extended again.
Conﬁguration space: The single-particle wavefunction depends on three coordi-
nates only. Therefore, in the single-particle case, we had:
 = (r, t)
In a many-particle case (let it be N particles), the wavefunction will naturally
depend on the coordinates of all particles [1]. Hence, we now have:
 = (r1, r2, ..., rN, t)
(9.6)
The coordinates {r1, r2, ..., rN} span what we call the conﬁguration space,
which has a dimensionality of 3N. Thus, the N-particle wavefunction is deﬁned in
the corresponding 3N-dimensional conﬁguration space. Instead of (4.6), the prob-
ability density w to ﬁnd the N-particle system in a certain conﬁguration will then
be given by:
dw(r1 ∈dV1, r2 ∈dV2, ..., rN ∈dVN) = |(r1, r2, ..., rN, t)|2dV1dV2...dVN
(9.7)
Correspondingly, for the calculation of expectation values, integration in (5.13)
has to be performed over dV1dV2...dVN.
Identical (or indistinguishable) particles: In contrast to classical particles, quan-
tum particles like electrons are indistinguishable. The indices 1 … N in (9.6) are

9.2
Physical Ideas
213
introduced for bookkeeping purposes only. Once the two electrons in the helium
atom are indistinguishable, we have to expect that a wavefunction like (9.6) must
sufﬁce certain symmetry relations with respect to interchanging the electrons posi-
tions. This is a qualitatively new circle of problems and will be topic of Sect. 9.3.1.
Figure 9.2 provides an illustration of the concepts of classical distinguishable and
quantum mechanical indistinguishable particles.
Three-body problem: In contrast to the hydrogen atom, the helium atom can no
more be regarded a two-body problem. The simpliﬁcations we had introduced in
Sect. 2.3.1, and particularly the very helpful concept of the reduced mass, will no
more ﬁnd application now. Although, because of the repulsive interaction between
the two electrons, the potential is no more of central symmetry, but becomes angle-
dependent.

The Helium Atom
Angular Momentum addition: [2, pp. 165–169].
Once the total angular momentum provided by the electrons in a complicated
atom appears as a superposition of the contributions of the single electrons, the
question of angular momentum addition in quantum mechanics becomes essen-
tial for understanding the internal dynamics of atoms. This angular momentum
addition is conceptually simple in classical physics—one simply has to perform
a geometrical vector addition. This is no more possible in quantum mechanics,
because all angular moments have to obey quantization rules like (8.27) and (8.30).
This clearly restricts the number of possible angular momentum addition results.
We have already been confronted with that circumstance, namely when perform-
ing the addition of orbital and spin angular momenta of an electron in Sect. 8.6.1
(compare (8.57a)).
The strong theory of momentum addition in quantum mechanics is clearly out-
side the topics of this book, nevertheless we need to apply certain results from this
theory here. We will restrict to the case of the addition of two angular momenta
only. For our further treatment, what we need to know is the following recipe:
Assume two different angular momenta L1 and L2. Let L1 be characterized by
the quantum number L1, and L2 by L2. Both these momenta shall sum up to the
total angular momentum L = L1 + L2. Then, the principally possible quantum
numbers L that characterize the total momentum are given by:
L = Lmin, Lmin + 1, ... , Lmax −1, Lmax
Lmax = L1 + L2; Lmin = |L1 −L2|
For the particular case of L1 = l and L2 = 1/2, from here we immediately
obtain (8.57a) as a special case.
Note that at the same time, the magnetic quantum numbers m1 and m2 sum up
to the projection of the resulting momentum m according to:
m = m1 + m2 = −L, ..., +L
This allows constructing a simple geometrical illustration of the correspond-
ing angular momentum addition process, when associating the angular momentum
vectors as arrows with a length proportional to √L(L + 1) and a projection on the
z-axis proportional to m—see Fig. 9.3 on left.
Figure 9.3 clearly indicates that generally, a different length—and correspond-
ing different values of L—of the resulting angular momentum vector may be
obtained without violating the above-mentioned rules. Thereby, the set of states
|L1m1L2m2⟩with given values of L1, m1, L2 and m2 forms a basis for representing
the ﬁnal states.
Note that in a many-body system, it is the total angular momentum that is
conserved and not necessarily any of the individual momenta of its individual
constituents. It therefore makes sense to turn to another basis |L1L2Lm⟩, when
the quantum numbers L1, L2, L and m are ﬁxed. Note that in this situation, which
is sketched in Fig. 9.3 on right, the individual projections m1 and m2 may no more

The quantities (L1L2m1m2|Lm ) are called Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcients.
Solution of the time-independent Schrödinger equation: As already mentioned, we
will not be able to ﬁnd an exact analytic solution to the Schrödinger equation for
the electron dynamics in the helium atom. Therefore, the application of approx-
imate methods will be essential. We will restrict here to the calculation of the
helium ground-state energy, neglecting spin effects in the ﬁrst step. In Sect. 9.3.2,
we will present two different approaches for that, namely
• A perturbation approach according to Sect. 5.3.8. Here, the unperturbed wave-
functions will correspond to (9.1) and (9.3a), and we will regard the Coulomb
interaction between the electrons as the perturbation.
• A variation approach. This way we will essentially model the screening
mechanism explained at the end of Sect. 9.1.
Then, we will separately discuss effects caused by the electron spins. In contrast
to the hydrogen atom, we will ﬁnd out that spin effects in many-electron atoms
do no more provide small corrections to the energy levels, but have an essential
impact on the energy levels (Sect. 9.4.3).

Theoretical Considerations
9.3.1
The Pauli Exclusion Principle
In Sect. 4.5.3, we have already supposed that a quantum state (for the model case
of a particle in a box) as deﬁned by the value of the quantum number n may be
populated with a maximum of two electrons (degeneration factor g = 2). We have
assigned this degeneration to the two possible orientations of the electron spin.
Once in a helium atom, we have two electrons, we will have to return to this
question now.
Let us regard two identical particles 1 and 2, and let us assume that each of
them is characterized by a set of quantum numbers n, l, and m (for simplicity we
will write {n} for this triple of quantum numbers), the spin orientation ms, and its
coordinates r. The full wavefunction of the system is thus:
 = ({n1}, ms1, r1; {n2}, ms2, r2)
(9.8)
Once the particles are indistinguishable, the physical state should not be inﬂu-
enced by interchanging the positions of the two particles. Then, the Hamiltonian
of the system should commute with the transposition operator ˆP [2, pp. 373–378,
3, pp. 381–384], which is deﬁned by:
ˆP({n1}, ms1, r1; {n2}, ms2, r2) = ({n2}, ms2, r1; {n1}, ms1, r2)
(9.9)
Let us remark that twice the action of
ˆP results in the initially assumed
wavefunction (9.8). Hence
ˆP ˆP = 
The eigenvalue problem for ˆP can be written as:
ˆP = P ⇒ˆP ˆP = P2 =  ⇒P2 = 1 ⇒P = ±1
(9.10)
We ﬁnd, that the eigenvalues of ˆP are given by P = ±1. Therefore, the eigen-
functions of ˆP are either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to interchanging
the positions of the particles. Particles with symmetric wavefunctions according to:
(sym)({n1}, ms1, r1; {n2}, ms2, r2) = (sym)({n2}, ms2, r1; {n1}, ms1, r2)
(9.11)
are called bosons. For example, photons and α-particles belong to the class of
bosons. They are characterized by an integer value of their spin.
Particles with an antisymmetric wavefunctions according to:
(asym)({n1}, ms1, r1; {n2}, ms2, r2) = −(asym)({n2}, ms2, r1; {n1}, ms1, r2)
(9.12)

9.3
Theoretical Considerations
217
are called fermions. For example, electrons, protons or neutrons belong to the class
of fermions. The latter are characterized by a half-integer value of their spin.
For fermions, from (9.12) we immediately obtain the Pauli exclusion principle.
Indeed, assuming identical quantum numbers for both particles, i.e., when setting:
{n2} = {n1} = {n} and ms2 = ms1 = ms, from (9.12) we obtain:
(asym)({n}, ms, r1; {n}, ms, r2) = −(asym)({n}, ms, r1; {n}, ms, r2)
⇒(asym)({n}, ms, r1; {n}, ms, r2) = 0
(9.12a)
The wavefunction of two identical fermions becomes zero when both fermions
are in identical quantum states. Hence, in any quantum system, the states of the
fermions must differ in at least one quantum number. For example, in the 1D
particle-in-a-box system from Sect. 4.3.3, in a quantum state characterized by
the quantum number n, a maximum of only two electrons (with different spin
orientation) may be found.
For bosons, according to (9.11), no corresponding exclusion principle may be
formulated. For the particular case of photons, this is directly reﬂected by the set
of eigenvalues of the photon number operator (in a given photon mode) according
to (5.51). Therefore, when deriving the Planck distribution in Sect. 7.3.1, we could
assume an arbitrary number of photons Np populating any given mode. This leads
to another phenomenon speciﬁc to bosons, namely the Bose–Einstein condensa-
tion, which is observed when at lowest temperature; all bosons tend to occupy
the ground state of the system. For example, superconductivity or superﬂuidity is
related to the Bose–Einstein condensation.
On the other hand, the occupation of a fermionic quantum state can only be
either zero or one. An occupation number operator like (5.51), deﬁned on the
basis of (5.48) and (5.43), must not be applied to fermions. In fact, it is only rela-
tion (5.43) that needs to be modiﬁed in order to construct a fermionic occupation
number operator (see later task 9.7.3).
Let us now assume that each of the particles may be characterized by a single-
particle wavefunction  = ({ni}, msi, ri). In analogy to what has been presented
in Sect. 9.1, the N-particle wavefunction may be written as a product of single-
particle wavefunctions provided that there is no interaction between the particles.
However, a product like (9.3) will not sufﬁce symmetry relations like (9.11) and
(9.12). Therefore, when considering the symmetry requirements, but neglecting
any other interaction between the particles forming the system, the symmetric or
antisymmetric wavefunctions of the system of the two particles of type (9.8) can
be written as:
Fermions:
(asym) =
1
√
2
[({n1}, ms1, r1)({n2}, ms2, r2)
−({n1}, ms1, r2)({n2}, ms2, r1)]

Bosons:

√
2
[({n1}, ms1, r1)({n2}, ms2, r2)
+({n1}, ms1, r2)({n2}, ms2, r1)]
(9.14)
Obviously, (9.13) sufﬁces the Pauli exclusion principle.
Note that the antisymmetric wavefunction as characteristic for non-interacting
fermions may be written in the more compact manner:
(asym) =
1
√
2
				
({n1}, ms1, r1) ({n1}, ms1, r2)
({n2}, ms2, r1) ({n2}, ms2, r2)
				
(9.15)
This equation may be easily generalized to the case of N non-interacting
fermions. That results in:
(asym) =
1
√
N!
														
({n1}, ms1, r1)
({n1}, ms1, r2) ... ({n1}, ms1, rN)

(9.16)
The determinants in (9.15) and (9.16) are called Slater determinants. The
Slater determinant becomes zero whenever two fermions have identical quantum
numbers, such that it is consistent with the Pauli principle.

Obviously, the potential does no more correspond to a central ﬁeld, because it has
angular dependence.
The helium atom ionization energy Eion, i.e., the energy necessary to ionize the
atom starting from its ground state, may be measured and has been found to be equal
to 78.9 eV. Therefore, the ground state energy of helium EHe,0 should be −78.9 eV.
“Zeroth” Approximation
In a zeroth approximation, we neglect the Coulomb interaction between the two
electrons. In fact, this is what we have already done in Sect. 9.1. From (9.4), (9.17),
and (9.18) we write:

(9.20)
This zero-order approximation value E(0)
He,0 is of the correct order, but nevertheless
very inaccurate.

He,0 according to (9.20) as a “zeroth” approximation, while regarding
the time-independent interaction potential
ˆV =

(9.21)
as a perturbation. The ﬁrst-order correction term to the ground-state energy might
then be estimated (compare (5.27)) as the expectation value of (9.21) calculated in
terms of the unperturbed wavefunction (9.20). Combining (9.20) with the ground-
state wavefunction from Table 8.3, we have:

Hence, from (9.20) we ﬁnd the ground-state energy:
E = E(0) + E(1) = −8Ry + 2.5Ry = −5.5Ry = −74.8 eV
(9.23)
This is already much closer to the experimental value than the zero-order
approximation. Nevertheless, the perturbation potential (9.21) cannot be regarded
a small correction term in (9.18), which explains the remaining differences.
Variation Approach
From (9.17) and (9.18), we ﬁnd the full Hamiltonian according to:
ˆH = ˆT1 + ˆT2 + U1 + U2 + U12

9.4.1
Screening
According to (9.26), the obtained “effective” atomic order Z′ in the test wavefunc-
tion (9.25) is equal to 1.6875 and thus smaller than 2. This result is consistent with
the physical mechanism assumed behind the calculation, namely that the charge
distribution of the electrons wavefunctions leads to an efﬁcient screening of the
potential of the nucleus.
9.4.2
Comparison of the Presented Approaches
In summary, we have found the following estimations for the ionization energy
Table 9.1:
Obviously, the ﬁrst-order perturbation approach already comes closer to the
true value than the zero-order approach from Sect. 9.1, but the differences are
still signiﬁcant. Clearly, the term U12 does not need to be substantially smaller
than the other terms in the Hamiltonian of the He atom, such that a ﬁrst-order
perturbation approach is surely not the method of choice. The variation approach,
on the other hand, is based on a physically transparent mechanism and leads to the
best reproduction of the experimental values among the methods described here.
9.4.3
Symmetry Requirements
The above discussion did not take into account requirements arising from the sym-
metry of the wavefunction as formulated in (9.13). In fact, we know that the two

9.4
Consistency Considerations
223
electron wavefunction must be antisymmetric with respect to interchanging the
electrons. When taking the spin into account, the wavefunction of the two electrons
can—in a symbolic manner - be written as [4, p. 1013]:
ψ = f (r1, r2) fs(s1, s2)
(9.27)
where f stands for the spatial part, and f s for the spin part of the wavefunction.
For more details see Sect. 9.6.1. Once the full wavefunction must be antisymmetric
with respect to interchanging the two electrons, we have two possibilities:
• f is a symmetric function, and f s an antisymmetric function. This situation
corresponds to an antiparallel arrangement of the two electron spins, such that
the full spin S is zero (S = 0). Helium atoms with such a wavefunction form
what is called para-helium.
• f is an antisymmetric function, and f s a symmetric function. This situation
corresponds to a parallel arrangement of the two electron spins, such that the
full spin is one (S = 1). Helium atoms with such a wavefunction form what is
called ortho-helium.
It turns out that para- and ortho-helium have extremely different spectroscopic
properties, such that formerly it was believed, that these two helium modiﬁcations
are two completely different materials.
So what gives rise to the mentioned spectroscopic differences? When looking
at para-helium, we have the following picture:
Para-helium: S = 0; J = L + S = L; electron spins are antiparallel, 2S + 1 = 1. In
order to distinguish between quantum numbers relevant for the single electrons (s,
l, j), we use capital letters (S, L, J) for the full spin, full orbital angular momentum
and full total angular momentum, as formed by summarizing the corresponding
individual contributions of the electrons.
In the case 2S + 1 = 1, we speak on a singlet state. In this context, 2S + 1 is
also called the multiplicity of the corresponding state. The lowest by energy states
are (according to the nomenclature 2S+1X J; S, P, D, F according to l = 0, 1, 2,
3,…, compare Sect. 8.6.1):
(1s, 1s): 1S0: This is the ground state. Both electrons may occupy the n = 1
state, because their spins are antiparallel.
(1s, 2s): 1S0: One electron with n = 1, the other with n = 2 and l = 0.
(1s, 2p): 1P1: One electron with n = 1, the other with n = 2 and l = 1.
Ortho-helium: S = 1; J = L + S ⇒J = {L-1, L, L + 1}. The electron spins are
parallel, such that 2S + 1 = 3, which is characteristic for a triplet state (except L
= 0). Note that in this case, the state (1s, 1s) is forbidden, because the spins are
parallel. Then, it is the Pauli exclusion principle that forbids the formation of such
a state; otherwise we would have two electrons in exactly the same quantum state.
Therefore, the lowest by energy states are:
(1s, 2s): 3S1.

Fig.9.4 Lowest energy levels (terms) of the helium atom. The strongest emission lines are visu-
alized by arrows. Red numbers indicate the absolute value of selected oscillator strength data
according to [6]
(1s, 2p): 3P2; 3P1; 3P0.
The corresponding energy levels for Para- and Ortho-helium (compare [5,
p. 184]) are visualized in the Fig. 9.4. It is obvious that para- and ortho-helium
have quite different spectroscopic properties, caused by the lack of a (1s, 1s)
ground state of ortho-helium, as well as the triplet character of its energy lev-
els. Therefore, in helium, spin effects can by no means be interpreted as small
corrections to energy terms, as soon as we get involved into many-electron atoms.
Remark When writing down the lowest energy electron states of para- and ortho-
helium, we have implicitly postulated an angular momentum coupling mechanism
that is called LS-coupling (or Russel–Sounders coupling): Its essence is in the
assumption that ﬁrst the single electrons orbital and spin momenta sum up to the
full orbital and spin momenta according to L = l1 + l2; S = s1 + s2. Then, the total
angular momentum is formed according to: J = L + S. This coupling mechanism is
a model assumption which best works in elements with a small atomic order Z.

Selection Rules
The electric dipole-allowed transitions comply with the general selection rules
(LS-coupling case):
J = 0, ±1 Without J = 0→J = 0
mJ = 0, ±1 Without mJ = 0→mJ = 0 @  J = 0

[5, p. 723]). Jz is given in units of ℏ
S = 0
L = 0, ±1
l = ±1 for the electron which changes its conﬁguration.
Note the similarity to (8.67) and (8.68). S = 0 is again an expression of the
fact that the spin does not couple to the electric ﬁeld of the light wave, such that a
singlet state cannot be transferred to a triplet state by electric dipole interaction and
vice versa. L = 0 corresponds to the rather seldom situation that the absorption
of one photon is accompanied by an orbital momentum change of two electrons
such that l1 = +1 and l2 = −1 result in L = 0 (compare [7, pp. 315, 349]).
In full consistency with (8.68), we again have the allowed transition J = 0.
The heuristic illustration is the same as provided in Sect. 8.6.3. Figure 9.5 provides
an illustration of such a transition in terms of a vector diagram.
Remark In heavy atoms, Z becomes large, and therefore the spin orbit interaction
(∝Z4) according to (8.59) may dominate over the Coulomb interaction (∝Z, compare
(9.22)), so that momentum coupling is rather accomplished as jj-coupling according
to:
ji = li + si; J = 
ji. Then, we have the modiﬁed selection rules:
J = 0, ±1 Without J = 0→J = 0
mJ = 0, ±1 Without mJ = 0→mJ = 0 @  J = 0
j = 0, ±1for the single electron.

Application to Practical Problems
The following calculation rather presents a practice-related application to the mate-
rial developed in Sect. 5.5.8, but once it is applied to the helium atom, this
nevertheless seems to be the appropriate place. So let us use this paragraph to
calculate the integral (9.22). This way we tackle E(0)
He,0 according to (9.5) as a
“zeroth” approximation, while regarding the time-independent interaction potential
ˆV =

as a perturbation. The ﬁrst-order correction term to the ground-state energy might
then be estimated (compare (5.27)) as the expectation value of (9.21) calculated in
terms of the unperturbed wavefunction (9.21a):

Structure of the Wavefunction of Two Electrons
in a Helium Atom (LS-Coupling)
From (9.27) we have the symbolic writing:
ψ = f (r1, r2) fs(s1, s2)
According to Sect. 9.3.1, this wavefunction must be antisymmetric with respect
to interchanging the two electrons [3, p. 385–388]. Hence,
ψ = fn1,n2(r1, r2) fs(s1, s2)
= −fn2,n1(r1, r2) fs(s2, s1)
= −fn1,n2(r2, r1) fs(s2, s1)
(9.28)
where n1 and n2 stand for quantum numbers not related to the spin. s1 and s2
symbolize the spin states of the corresponding electrons.
According to (9.27), we search the solutions as:
ψ(+) = f (sym)
n1,n2 (r1, r2) f (asym)
s
(s1, s2)
ψ(−) = f (asym)
n1,n2 (r1, r2) f (sym)

For the spin part, we introduce the following symbolic writing:
1st electron, state spin up: |↑⟩1
1st electron, state spin down: |↓⟩1
2nd electron, state spin up: |↑⟩2
2nd electron, state spin down: |↓⟩2.
Let us remember the writing of these wavefunctions as spinors. We have |↑⟩=
 1
0

and |↓⟩=
0

.
From the Pauli matrices (8.62a), we have
σ 1|↑⟩= |↓⟩
σ 2|↑⟩= i|↓⟩
σ 3|↑⟩= |↑⟩
σ 1|↓⟩= |↑⟩
σ 2|↓⟩= −i|↑⟩
σ 3|↓⟩= −|↓⟩
(9.31)
Then, in this symbolic writing, we ﬁnd the following expressions for the
wavefunctions (9.29):

According to calculations in terms of (8.62)–(8.66), (9.31), this asymmetric

(9.33)
According to (8.62)–(8.66), (9.31), these symmetric with respect to the spin
function solutions correspond to S = 1, and mS = 0, ±1.
In all these expressions, the spatial part of the wavefunction is given in terms
of (9.30).
We see that for the antisymmetric spin conﬁguration (spins are antiparallel, S =
0), we ﬁnd one single solution, corresponding to a singlet state (para-helium). For

the symmetric spin conﬁgurations (spins are parallel, S = 1), we have three solu-
tions with different projections of the total spin on the z-axis, thus corresponding
to a triplet of states (ortho-helium).
9.6.2
Hund’s Rules
This short section is to summarize selected information about atoms with more
than two electrons. We will restrict our attention to the electronic ground-state
conﬁgurations.
First of all, let us remember the nomenclature as introduced in Sect. 8.6.1. In
application to many-electron atoms, we now write the terms as:
2S+1X J; X = S, P, D, F according to L = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
(9.34)
The following Table 9.2 summarizes ground-state electronic conﬁgurations of
the elements up to Z = 54 (Xenon). Note that completely ﬁlled electronic “shells”
do not add any nonzero S- or L-contributions. Nonzero contributions arise only
from partially ﬁlled (sub-)shells. Therefore, the ground state of the noble gas atoms
is always 1S0.
The problem is that the individual electronic spins and orbital momenta sum up
in a vector-like manner, i.e., with possibly different individual directions. Different
total momenta may result in different energies, and it is not a priori clear which of
them corresponds to the lowest energy, i.e., the ground state. Fortunately, for light
atoms, some simple rules exist for identifying the ground-state conﬁguration.
Indeed, the ground states of atoms with predominant LS-coupling obey the so-
called Hund’s rules, which indicate the (2S + 1), L, and J-values in (9.34) as
relevant in the ground state:
1. 2S+1XJ: For a given electron conﬁguration, the term with maximum multiplicity
2S + 1 has the lowest energy.
2. 2S+1XJ: For a given multiplicity, the term with the largest L has the lowest
energy.
3. 2S+1XJ: If the outermost shell is half-ﬁlled or less, then the level with the lowest
J corresponds to the lowest energy. If the outermost shell is more than half-
ﬁlled, the highest J corresponds to the lowest energy.
It is nevertheless tricky to construct the ground-state conﬁguration for a compli-
cated atom from these three rules, because ﬁrst of all, any discussed electronic state
must additionally comply with the symmetry requirements introduced (9.12) and
(9.27) and, in particular, with Pauli’s exclusion principle. But if you scan through
the Table 9.2, you will notice that the ground states are—often enough—charac-
terized by large multiplicities, as well as large values of L and J.
As an illustration, consider the silicon atom ground state. According to Table
9.2, except the 3p orbital, all other subshells are ﬁlled. It is hence the 3p orbital
with two electrons (subscripts 1 and 2) that deﬁnes S, L, and J.

But it is easily seen that the 3D state must be forbidden by the Pauli principle,
because both electrons have identical n and l-values, as well as identical projection
m and ms. Then, the ground state should correspond to the 3P conﬁguration, which
obviously does not contradict Pauli’s exclusion principle.
Remark In fact this is not a sufﬁcient conditions, because we have to require, that the
wavefunction attributed to the corresponding quantum state must be different from
zero and antisymmetric with respect to interchanging the electrons position. A deeper
analysis of the symmetry of the wavefunctions leads to the result that the 3S and 1P
states in the silicon atom are symmetry-forbidden, at least for identical principal
quantum numbers, while 3P is indeed allowed [5, p. 201]. Hence it corresponds to
the ground state of the silicon atom.
We thus have S = 1 and L = 1, which allows for J = 0, 1, 2.
In order to ﬁnd J, we make use of Hund’s third rule. The 3p shell is ﬁlled with
only two electrons, while it can be ﬁlled with up to 2(2 l + 1) = 6 electrons. It is
thus less than half-ﬁlled, and therefore, according to Hund’s third rule, the lowest
J (i.e., J = 0) corresponds to the state with the lowest energy. The ground state of
the silicon atom is therefore 3Po.

The process of chemical bonding between different atoms results in the formation
of molecules. The number of atoms, their masses, the bonding strength, and symmetry
considerations are essential for understanding the optical behavior of molecules in
different spectral regions.

The Hydrogen Molecule
Abstract
Basic knowledge on molecular bonding mechanisms is presented. The adiabatic
or Born–Oppenheimer approximation is introduced, and the theory of covalent
bonding in the hydrogen molecule is derived in detail. Also, empiric interaction
potentials like the Lennard–Jones or Morse potentials are shortly discussed.
10.1
Starting Point
In Chap. 8, we have started discussing the physics of atoms from the hydrogen
atom—the simplest atom, which consists of 2 particles only—namely an electron
and a proton (the nucleus). Similarly, the simplest neutral molecule is the hydro-
gen molecule, as consisting of two hydrogen atoms. Figure 10.1 visualizes this
situation.
In Fig. 10.1, arrows symbolize the individual interaction terms that contribute
to the full potential energy of the system. The situation will become even more
complicated when other molecules built from (a possibly larger) number of higher
order atoms are taken into consideration. In fact, the four-body system as presented
in Fig. 10.1 corresponds to the simplest situation of a neutral molecule, but even
this simplest case does not allow for an analytic solution of the corresponding
Schrödingers equation. Hence, similarly to the helium atom, we will have to make
use of approximate solutions of the Schrödinger equation.
In the general case, the molecule may be considered as an agglomerate of elec-
trons and atomic nuclei. The Hamiltonian of the molecule may be written in the
following general manner [1, 2]:
ˆH = ˆTe + ˆTc + U

re,i, rc, j

(10.1)
Here, ˆTe represents the operator of the electrons kinetic energy of all electrons
and ˆTc that of the nuclei. The term U contains the potential energy of all electrons

and nuclei and is thus depending on the electron coordinates (re,i) as well as
on those of the nuclei (rc,j). The index i counts the electrons, j the nuclei. The
stationary Schrödingers equation may be written as:

(10.2)
It will be our aim in this chapter to get an idea of the approximate solution of
(10.2) for the H2 molecule as illustrated in Fig. 10.1. In order to achieve this goal,
we will have to draw together our knowledge on classical estimations concerning
molecule dynamics (Chap. 2), as well as the hydrogen atom and the consequences
of the indistinguishability of identical particles that form a many-body system
(Chaps. 8 and 9).
10.2
Physical Idea
As it has already been discussed in Chap. 2, electrons and nuclei strongly differ
in their masses for several orders of magnitude. Therefore, the movement of elec-
trons will be much faster than that of the nuclei. That will allow us to facilitate
the approximate solution of (10.2): We will assume that during a characteristic
time relevant for the electron movement, the positions of the nuclei will practi-
cally remain unchanged. On the other hand, in the time span characteristic for
the movement of the nuclei, any electron (please accept for a moment the rather
classical illustration provided in Fig. 10.1) will have enough time for performing
a large number of “loops” around their average positions, such that the nuclei feel
some effective impact from the electron system, which does not depend on the
“actual coordinates” of the electrons. This will allow us subdividing (10.2) into
two equations: one for the electrons dynamics, and another for the movement of
the nuclei.

10.3.1 The Adiabatic Approximation
Let us now make use of the following ansatz [1, 2]:
ψ

re,i, rc, j

= ψe

re,i, rc, j

ψc

rc, j

(10.3)
In (10.3), the wavefunction of the whole system ψ

re,i, rc, j

is represented
as a product of that of the electronic (e) and that of the nuclei (c) subsystems.
Once during the fast movement of the electrons, the nuclei positions will prac-
tically remain ﬁxed, the electronic part of the wavefunction ψe

re,i, rc, j

may
be calculated assuming the spatial conﬁguration of the nuclei as a ﬁxed set of
parameters (rc, j = const ∀j). This is the essence of the so-called adiabatic or
Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Therefore, in (10.3), the electron wavefunc-
tion appears principally dependent on the actual nucleus coordinates, while the
latter are tackled as ﬁxed parameters on the time scale relevant for the electron
movement. Combining (10.1)–(10.3), we obtain:
1
ψe

E −ˆTe −U

re,i, rc, j

ψe = 1
ψc
ˆTcψc
(10.4)
It is obvious that the term in (10.4) on right depends only on the nuclei coor-
dinates. But if so, the same must be valid for the term on left as well. We can
therefore write:
1
ψe

E −ˆTe −U

re,i, rc, j

ψe = 1
ψc
ˆTcψc ≡W



(10.5)
Any of the thus deﬁned functions W (there may be more than one) can princi-
pally be represented as the superposition of a constant ﬁrst term and a second one,
which depends on the nuclei coordinates:
W

rc, j

≡Ec −u

rc, j

(10.6)
This results in the following equation for the electronic wavefunction:



The Hydrogen Molecule
On the other hand, the wavefunction for the movement of the nuclei cannot
depend on the actual position of the electrons, because the latter may change many
times during the time span characteristic for the movement of a nucleus. Therefore,
the nuclei rather feel some averaged response from the electron movement, which
deﬁnes the potential energy relevant for their (oscillatory) movement. From (10.5)
and (10.6), we have:

ˆTc + u

rc, j

ψc

rc, j

= Ecψc

rc, j

(10.9)
Obviously, the term u

rc, j

has the meaning of the potential energy of the
interaction between the nuclei. It is related to the solution of the electronic part
of the Schrödinger equation via (10.8). Then, Ec has to be interpreted as the total
(=kinetic + potential) energy of the nuclei.
This way, the adiabatic approximation allowed us to subdivide Schrödingers
(10.2) of the full molecule into two separate (10.7) and (10.9), which describe
the electronic and nuclei subsystems, respectively. Solving (10.7) with ﬁxed nuclei
coordinates (i.e., as a point-by-point calculation) gives principal access to the coor-
dinate dependence of u

rc, j

, and knowledge of the latter allows solving (10.9).
In different electronic eigenstates (different solutions of (10.7)), u

rc, j

may be
different as well, so that the solution of the nuclei (10.9) depends on the concrete
electronic eigenstate. This may give rise to different equilibrium positions of the
nuclei in different electronic states and, therefore, to differences in molecular size
and shape.
On the other hand, (10.8) deﬁnes the full energy in a given molecular eigenstate
as some superposition of electron and nucleus contributions. It is the movement
of the nuclei that deﬁnes what we have earlier associated with vibrational and
rotational degrees of freedom (Sect. 2.5).
10.3.2 Simplest Example of Covalent Bonding: The H2+- Molecule
Ion
As a ﬁrst example, we will turn to a quantum system that is even simpler than the
H2 molecule, namely to the H+
2 —molecule ion. It is obtained by removing one
of the electrons from the system shown in Fig. 10.1. As the result, we obtain a
simpler three-body system as visualized in Fig. 10.2.
This is a single-electron system, and we will concentrate on solving the
Schrödingers equation for the single electron in the ﬁeld supplied by the two
protons. In accordance to the adiabatic approximation, we will assume that the
conﬁguration of the nuclei is ﬁxed. Hence, we set:
rab = const ∀j
(10.10)
A particular consequence of (10.10) is that no kinetic energy resulting from
the relative movement of the nuclei with respect to each other will be taken into
account in this section.

(10.11)
Because of (10.10), the Coulomb interaction of the two protons only gives a
constant contribution, which we will not take into account explicitly at the moment.
Because, in our present case, we deal with a single-electron system; we do not need
to care about consequences from the Pauli principle and therefore neglect any spin
effects.
Let us remark that we know the wavefunctions ψa and ψb of the hydrogen-type
Schrödinger equations:

ψa = ˆHaψa = Eaψa

ψb = ˆHbψb = Ebψb
(10.12)
In our treatment, we will restrict on the electronic ground state of the molecule
ion. In particular, the eigenvalues Ea and Eb should be identical and correspond to
the hydrogen ground state according to (8.46). Then, the solutions of (10.12) may
be regarded as special cases of the solution of (10.11): When rab is large enough,
the electron will practically be bound to either of the nuclei (a) or (b), so that
the system shown in Fig. 10.2 becomes nothing else than a hydrogen atom plus a
proton located at a large distance from the hydrogen atom. In this case, the radii
ra and rb are of quite different orders of magnitude, such that one of the terms
describing the potential energy in (10.11) may be neglected.
If, however, the protons come close enough to each other, such that their dis-
tance becomes comparable to the spatial extensions of the relevant atomic orbitals,
then the situation changes. None of the two contributions to the potential energy
of the electron may anymore be neglected, such that we have to assume that in a
tricky way, the electron “belongs” to both nuclei. The idea of our further treatment

246

The Hydrogen Molecule
is then the following: We will solve the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen
molecule ion (10.11) with the constraint (10.10) in terms of the ansatz:
ψ = c1ψa + c2ψb
(10.13)
We thus search the solution of (10.11) as a superposition of the solutions of
(10.12). This ansatz is called LCAO (LCAO = Linear combination of atomic
orbitals). It is an exact solution if rab is very large, and we will take it as an approx-
imate ansatz for smaller distances as well. Equation (10.13) is the mathematical
formulation of our idea that the electron “belongs” to both nuclei.
When substituting (10.13) into (10.11), we obtain:
−

Let us regard the eigenvalues Ea and Eb as some initial approximation of the
electron energy in the ground state of the molecule. Hence, we assume:
ˆHaψa = E(0)ψa
ˆHbψb = E(0)ψb
(10.15)
Then, when combining (10.14) and (10.15), we ﬁnd:

in the hydrogen atom ground state (compare (8.46)). Then,

S quantiﬁes the spatial overlap of the wavefunctions ψa and ψb (overlap

While C quantiﬁes the electrostatic energy of the electron with respect to
the “other” proton, the term D quantiﬁes a speciﬁc quantum mechanical phe-
nomenon, called exchange interaction. D is usually called the exchange integral.
For wavefunctions like (8.46), we ﬁnd:
C ≤0; D ≤0
(10.20a)
Now, after having multiplied (10.18) with ψa or ψb and integrated over the
volume, we obtain:
c1(E −C) + c2(SE −D) = 0
c1(SE −D) + c2(E −C) = 0

Let us now look on the wavefunctions according to (10.13). When substituting
(10.22) into the ﬁrst equation from (10.21), we obtain:

⇒−c1(SC −D) + c2(CS −D) = 0 ⇒c1 = +c2 ⇒ψ ∝(ψa + ψb)
According to Fig. 10.2, we have to expect that S, C, and D depend on the
distance rab between the nuclei. Therefore, our correction term E according to
(10.22) will also depend on rab. At sufﬁciently large distances, it will approach
zero because C and D are vanishing at distances larger than the characteristic
decay length of the atomic wavefunctions.
The full energy of the molecule will of course also contain the potential energy
of the two nuclei.

(10.24)
When the nuclei are placed at an inﬁnitely large distance, from (10.24), it is
obvious that Etotal = E(0). When the distance between the nuclei becomes smaller,
the electrostatic energy corresponding to the repulsive interaction between the
nuclei will increase. Moreover, the energy correction term E will split off into
the two possible solutions (10.22). Thereby, in case of the antisymmetric solution
ψ = ψ(asym) ∝(ψa −ψb), we have the correction term E =
C−D
1−S , which
is small by absolute value because the integrals C and D tend to compensate
each other (compare (10.19a) and (10.20a). It is therefore likely to assume that
in (10.15), the repulsive Coulomb interaction between the nuclei gives the domi-
nant contribution, such that the potential energy monotonically increases when the
nuclei approach each other. In such a situation, no potential minimum is formed,
and a stable bonding conﬁguration cannot be achieved. On the contrary, in case
of the symmetric solution ψ = ψ(sym) ∝(ψa + ψb), we have the correction term
E = C+D
1+S ≤0, which is certainly negative at ﬁnite distances (compare (10.19a)
and (10.20a)) and therefore tends to (at least partially) compensate the repulsive
Coulomb interaction between the nuclei. In this case, we have a chance to observe
a potential minimum in the potential energy, which would correspond to molecular
bonding.
This result has a transparent physical interpretation. In the asymmetric state, the
electron has only a minimum probability to be found in-between the two nuclei
(Fig. 10.3, black curve). Therefore, the repulsive potential between the nuclei will

dominate, and no molecule ion may be formed. For this reason, the antisymmetric
state ψ(asym) ∝(ψa −ψb) is called an antibonding electronic state.
In case of the symmetric solution ψ(sym) ∝(ψa + ψb), there is however a good
chance to observe the electron in-between the nuclei, which leads to a reduction of
the repulsive force between the nuclei. Therefore, a potential minimum may exist
that marks the equilibrium distance rab,0 between the nuclei in the molecule ion.
Such a state is called a bonding state. At lowest distances rab, as it may be guessed
from (10.24), the repulsive potential between the nuclei will dominate (Fig. 10.4).

Consistency Considerations
Obviously, the model assumptions formulated in the previous sections as well as
the obtained results need some discussion:
• Our treatment of the hydrogen molecule ion has essentially based on the
adiabatic approximation, particularly on condition (10.10). This led us to
expressions like (10.24) and—as a result of a qualitative discussion—to depen-
dencies E = E(rab) like those shown in Fig. 10.4. Thereby, the distance between
the nuclei rab was tackled as a ﬁxed parameter when solving the Schrödinger
equation for the electron in the potential provided by the two nuclei. Conse-
quently, both E and ψ depend on that parameter rab. Note that (10.24) is a
particular case of (10.8).
On the other hand, condition (10.10) does not allow for well-known phenom-
ena like thermal expansion of macroscopic many-atomic systems, or vibrations
of nuclei with respect to each other, which give rise to speciﬁc MIR absorp-
tion spectra (compare Sect. 2.5.1). A treatment of these phenomena needs the
application of the Schrödinger equation of the nuclei subsystem (10.9). At the
moment, let us recognize the encouraging principal similarity of the red curve
in Fig. 10.4 and the black one in Fig. 2.7. Thus, when applying a classical pic-
ture, an elongation of the nuclei from the equilibrium value rab,0 should result
in an increase of their potential energy. Then, a restoring force should be gen-
erated that pulls the nuclei back to their equilibrium distance, thus giving rise
to vibrations of the nuclei with respect to each other. Practically, through the
application of (10.8), E = E(rab) gives direct access to the potential u(rc,j) that
is responsible for the movements of the nuclei.
• The different effects of the symmetric and antisymmetric constellations in
the electrons wavefunctions may be visualized in a simple classical picture
(Fig. 10.5):
Thus, in the asymmetric situation on top of Fig. 10.5, nucleus b feels
strong repulsion from nucleus a and strong attraction from the electron.
It will obviously be pushed to the right. Nucleus a feels strong repul-
sion from nucleus b but only weak attraction from the electron. It will
obviously be pushed to the left. Nothing like a molecule may be formed.

Fig. 10.5 Classical illustration of antisymmetric (on top) and symmetric (on bottom)
electronic constellations in the H+
2 molecule ion
In the symmetric constellation on bottom, however, the strong internuclear
repulsion is somehow compensated by the strong attraction by the elec-
tron (again some kind of screening). It appears likely that this symmetric
constellation should be favored in molecular bonding.
• However, the classical illustration from Fig. 10.5 alone cannot explain the
existence of stable molecules. This already follows from the impossibility to
obtain stable classical atoms (Sect. 2.4) necessary as the starting point for the
formation of molecules. Moreover, it is obvious that:
– A situation like that shown in Fig. 10.5 may be tackled as a snaphot of the
conﬁguration of a classical system, but of course, it is quite unstable.
– Fig. 10.5 does not give access to understanding typical molecular spatial
extensions.
• In terms of the quantum mechanical treatment, the efﬁciency of molecular bond-
ing is predominatly deﬁned by the values of the integrals C and D. It is the
effective spatial extension of the atomic wavefunctions that acts as the crucial
spatial parameter here. Therefore, in the quantum mechanical picture, the dis-
tance between the nuclei in a molecule is of the same order as typical atomic
sizes are (compare again Table 1.1). This is in full agreement to corresponding
experimental ﬁndings.
• According to the LCAO ansatz (10.13), the electron in the hydrogen molecule
ion somehow “belongs” to both nuclei. In this situation, one speaks on covalent
bonding.

252
10
The Hydrogen Molecule
• Note in this context, that the reduction of the potential energy in the case
of a symmetric wavefunction is one of the physical mechanisms that makes
molecular bonding favorable from an energetic point of view. The other is in
a decrease in kinetic energy of the electron. Indeed, if the electron “belongs”
to both nuclei, it is allowed to move in a larger spatial region and is thus less
localized. According to our discussion in Sect. 4.3.3, that is expected to result
in a lower ground-state kinetic energy (compare also Task 5.7.9 in this regard).
• Note that in the LCAO wavefunction (10.13), the absolute values of the coefﬁ-
cients c1 and c2 turned out to be identical. This is an expression of the fact, that
the situations “the electron is with proton a” and “the electron is with proton
b” reﬂect the same physical situation.
10.5
Application to Practical Problems
10.5.1 Interatomic Interaction Potentials
Let us return to Fig. 10.4. It visualizes the energy of the diatomic molecule in
dependence of the internuclear distance rab. In the bonding electronic state, it has
a local minimum at the equilibrium distance rab,0. Any elongation of the nuclei
from their equilibrium positions will increase the energy and therefore give rise to a
restoring force, thus resulting in oscillations of the nuclei. Therefore, the particular
shape of the E(rab)—dependence as given by (10.24) is of immense signiﬁcance
for understanding the optical spectra of real molecules. In fact, it should deﬁne the
potential u(rab) that deﬁnes the interaction forces between the nuclei and thus their
oscillations with respect to each other in a diatomic molecule (and, of course, also
many-atomic molecules). Thereby, in the case of covalent bonding, E(rab) may
principally be calculated by solving (10.14) in a point-by-point manner, assuming
different ﬁxed values of rab. Then, the potential u(rab) relevant for the vibrations
of the nuclei should have the same shape, but for practical purposes, it may differ
from E(rab) by a suitably chosen constant (compare (10.6)).
In practice, for many relevant tasks, it is however sufﬁcient to replace the true
u(rab) dependence by a suitably parametrized model dependence that reﬂects the
main features of the true u(rab) curve. It is the purpose of this short section to
introduce a couple of such practically relevant models.
Let us summarize some basic requirements on such u(rab) curves. Besides usual
mathematical requirements such as continuity and differentiability of the curves,
we would it like to have the following conditions fulﬁlled:
1. For rab →∞, E(rab) should approach a constant value that corresponds to the
sum of the energies of the single isolated atoms that form the molecule. In
many applications, it is useful to deﬁne the interaction potential u(rab) such
that u(rab →∞)→0 (no interaction at inﬁnite distance).
2. The u(rab) curve should have one local minimum at rab = rab,0.

10.5
Application to Practical Problems
253
3. For rab →0, u(rab) should be positive and become “very large.”
Note that these requirements are consistent with the shape of the E(rab) depen-
dence in a bonding conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 10.4. Thereby, (10.24) was
derived assuming covalent bonding. But clearly, other bonding types (ionic bond-
ing, van der Waals bonding) must result in E(rab)-dependencies which are
qualitatively close to the shape of E(rab) as shown in Fig. 10.4. Therefore, the
requirements (1)–(3) are more general and do not only concern covalent bonding
of diatomic molecules.
Let us have a closer look at some examples, applicable for diatomic molecules:
10.5.2 A Simple Model Potential
The requirements (1)–(3) are obviously fulﬁlled for any potential given by:
u(rab) = −
σ1
(rab)n1 +
σ2
(rab)n2 ; n2 > n1 > 0; σ1, σ2 > 0; n1, n2 integer
(10.25)
The constant σ1 deﬁnes the strength of the attractive force between the nuclei
a and b, while the constant σ2 is responsible for the repulsive force. In accordance
to our classical considerations from Sect. 2.5.1 (Fig. 2.7), we further have:
u(rab →∞) = 0
u(rab →0) →∞
The minimum of the potential (10.15) deﬁnes the equilibrium distance rab,0.
Differentiating (10.25) and setting the ﬁrst derivative equal to zero results in:

rab,0
n2−n1 = n2
n1
σ2
σ1
Accordingly, u(rab) must have a local minimum at rab = rab,0. We will call
that minimum value of the potential U0, i.e.,
U0 ≡u

rab = rab,0

< 0
Then, the model parameters σ1 and σ2 may be expressed through rab,0 and U0.
This results in another writing of (10.15), namely:
u(rab) =
U0

10.5.3 Model Potentials for Ionic Bonding
In ionic bonding, the attractive force between the ions is primarily caused by the
electrostatic Coulomb attraction; hence, n1 = 1 (Fig. 10.6).
A simple potential for modeling this type of bonding is therefore:
u(rab) =
U0
1 −n2
rab,0

; n2 > 1; n2integer
(10.27)
For different ions, the value of n2 changes varies between 7 and 12 [3].
In addition to the Coulomb attraction between the ions, the Born–Heisenberg
theory of ionic bonding takes the effects of dipoles induced in the ions into
account. That results in the appearance of additional attractive terms in the poten-
tial. In this model, n2 is set equal to 9, such that the following potential is proposed
[3]:

10.5.4 The Lennard-Jones Potential
It is my hope, dear reader, that you have already become familiar with that poten-
tial by having solved task 2.7.3 in Chap. 2. In terms of the more general writing
provided by (10.26), setting n1 = 6 and n2 = 12, we may write
u(rab) = U0

(10.29) is called a Lennard–Jones potential. Although (10.29) represents an
empirical formula, the r−6 dependence may be analytically derived for the partic-
ular case of van der Waals bound molecules. We will not perform that calculation,

10.5
Application to Practical Problems
255
but essentially, the r−6 dependence is obtained from a simple induced dipole inter-
action when taking the r−3 decay of the electric ﬁeld around a point dipole into
account [4].
10.5.5 The Morse Potential
The Morse potential is another widely used model potential. We will return to it
in the next chapter, when modeling nuclei vibrations in terms of an anharmonic
oscillator model. For the moment, we indicate the corresponding formula deﬁning
the Morse potential [5]:
u(rab) = U0

2e−β(rab−rab,0) −e−2β(rab−rab,0)
(10.30)
β is a real positive parameter in reciprocal length units (i.e., the reciprocal
value of some characteristic damping length). In contrast to the potentials given
by (10.25)–(10.29), the Morse potential does not diverge at rab →0.
Its advantage is that the Schrödinger equation for a particle with mass m moving
in the Morse potential may be exactly solved. The energy levels of bound states
depend on one quantum number n≥0 with the constraint

where ωe is a characteristic angular frequency deﬁned by:

Except the third term in (10.31), the energy values coincide with those obtained
for a harmonic oscillator with a vertex of the potential curve located at U0 and a
resonance frequency ωe (compare (5.34)). Correspondingly, the term
xe = −ℏωe
4U0

4D ≪1
(10.33)
is called the anharmonicity of the Morse potential. For xe = 0, (10.31) turns
into the corresponding formula for the harmonic oscillator. The restriction on the
quantum number n for forming a bound state may now be rewritten as:

Figure 10.7 shows examples of the shapes of different of the mentioned
potentials, with identical assumed position and depth of the potential minimum.
Note that ionic bonding corresponds to a rather far-reaching interaction potential,
because of the slow convergence at large distances.

Advanced Material: The Hydrogen Molecule
The treatment of the hydrogen molecule basically follows the LCAO treatment ear-
lier applied to the hydrogen molecule ion. We will only mention the basic steps and
results of such an approach. The basic difference is in the presence of two indis-
tinguishable electrons. Therefore, there is a need to modify the approximate ansatz
(10.13). Keeping in mind the structure of the spatial part of the wavefunction like
(9.30), instead of (10.13), we now write:
ψ(sym) =
1
√2(1 + S)[ψa(1)ψb(2) + ψa(2)ψb(1)]
ψ(asym) =
1
√2(1 −S)[ψa(1)ψb(2) −ψa(2)ψb(1)]

(10.35) is the generalization of the overlap integral (10.19). As in the case of
the helium atom, integration has now to be performed over the conﬁguration space
of the coordinates of two electrons.
Here, (1) and (2) denote the two electrons, while a and b the two protons
(compare Fig. 10.8). The symbols in (10.34) denote situations like “electron 1 is
with nucleus b” ⇒ψb(1) and so on.
A detailed LCAO calculation shows that the structure of (10.24) remains valid
with somewhat generalized deﬁnitions of C and D (not to be confused with the
dissociation energy). Thus, instead of (10.20), we now have (symbols as explained

The Hydrogen Molecule
At inﬁnite distance between the nuclei, of course, we now have the ground-state
energies of two hydrogen atoms. Therefore, instead of (10.24), our ﬁnal result is:
Etotal = 2E(0) + C ± D
1 ± S +
e2
4πε0rab
≡E(rab)
(10.38)
where S, C, and D are given by (10.35)–(10.37). And again, it is the symmetric
spatial part of the wavefunction that corresponds to the bonding conﬁguration. The
dependence of the total energy of the molecule on the ﬁxed distance of the nuclei
is qualitatively the same as presented earlier in Fig. 10.4.
The rest of the discussion is similar to what has been established for the helium
atom. Once we have now two electrons (i.e., two fermions), their full wavefunction
must be antisymmetric with respect to interchanging the positions of the elec-
trons. The general structure of such wavefunctions is indicated in (9.30), (9.32)
and (9.33). Thus, similarly to the discussion performed in Sect. 9.4.3, in the
case of the symmetric (bonding) spatial wavefunction, the spin function must be
antisymmetric, i.e., the spins must be antiparallel in a bonding state. Contrarily,
the antibonding antisymmetric spatial part of the wavefunction corresponds to a
symmetric spin wavefunction, i.e., parallel spins.
Concerning numerical values, in the hydrogen molecule, we have rab,0 ≈
0.074 nm; U0 ≈−4.52 eV [6] (compare Table 1.1). Note the consistency of rab,0
≈0.074 nm with the expectation value of r in the hydrogen atom ground state:
<r> ≈0.08 nm as calculated in Sect. 8.4.1.
The two electrons with antiparallel spins are called to form an electron pair.

Optical Spectra of Molecules
Abstract
Important spectral features of molecular spectra are introduced, including rota-
tion of the whole molecule, vibrations of the atomic nuclei, and the response
of valence electrons. The treatment is focused on diatomic molecules as a
well-accessible model system, but complemented by information about selected
speciﬁcs of rotational-vibrational spectra of polyatomic molecules.
11.1
Starting Point
In order to get a general idea on the speciﬁcs of molecular absorption spectra, let
us start with some purely classical considerations. A molecule is built from several
atoms; i.e., it consists of a certain number of electrons and a certain number of
atomic nuclei. Let the number of atomic nuclei in the molecule be Na.
In a classical picture, the molecule can be understood as a couple of point
masses connected by elastic springs. The spring constant is an analogue to the
bond strength and is controlled—in covalent bounding—by the spatial overlap
of the valence electrons wavefunctions, i.e., those “outermost” electrons that are
responsible for the formation of covalent bonding (compare Chap. 10). Once the
molecule should be stable to small perturbations with respect to size and shape
as a whole, it is reasonable assuming that the spring constants responsible for the
movements of nuclei and valence electrons are of the same order of magnitude.
Then, as a consequence of the different masses of electrons and nuclei, the vibra-
tional eigenfrequencies of the motion of nuclei should be much smaller than that
of the valence electrons. A rough estimate is (compare Sects. 2.5.1 and 2.5.2):

Optical Spectra of Molecules
The vibrations of nuclei correspond to frequencies in the middle infrared (fur-
ther vibronic excitations, the corresponding spectra are often called vibrational
spectra), and those of valence electrons to the visible or ultraviolet spectral regions:
ωnucl ≡ωvibr ∈MIR
ωvalence electron ≡ωelectr ∈VIS/UV
(11.2)
Therefore, purely vibrational spectra are traditionally recorded by means of
MIR spectrophotometers, while the set of MIR eigenfrequency characteristic for a
certain molecule (the so-called ﬁngerprint spectrum) may be used for identiﬁcation
purposes. This technique is, of course, also used in solid-state spectroscopy in
order to identify substances, contaminations, bonding conﬁgurations, crystalline
symmetries, and the like. It is characteristic for all these infrared spectra that no
optical excitation of electronic eigenmodes occurs, while only vibrational degrees
of freedom are excited.
In a purely electronic spectrum, on the contrary, only electronic vibrations are
excited by absorption of light, while the motion of nuclei will not be affected. Such
excitations should occur in the VIS/UV, but they are rarely observed. The point
is that the excitation of valence electrons is in most cases accompanied by an
additional excitation of vibrations of the nuclei, so that in VIS/UV absorption, we
usually observe a superposition of electronic and vibronic excitations. The reason
for this behavior may be understood from the quantum mechanical description: It
turns out that the equilibrium positions of the nuclei (which deﬁne size and shape
of the molecule) depend on the respective quantum state of the electrons (compare
Sect. 10.3.1). When the electronic state is changed (which happens rather rapidly),
the (initially maybe resting) nuclei come into motion to move toward their new
equilibrium positions. This way they gain kinetic energy, which does not permit
them to stop at the new equilibrium position; instead, they will oscillate around
these positions. In quantum mechanics, this behavior is predicted as a consequence
of the relevance of such powerful concepts like the Born–Oppenheimer approxi-
mation and the Franck–Condon principle. The important point at the moments
is that this way a vibration of nuclei may be established, and the corresponding
energy must been taken from the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The absorbed energy is
thus used for the excitation of a superposition of electronic and nuclei oscillations,
and hence, the corresponding absorption frequency may be symbolically written
as:
ωabsorption ≡ωelectr +

ωvibr ∈VIS/UV
(11.3)
Equation (11.3) does not simply describe a single absorption line, but a rather
complicated absorption feature, which is blue-shifted with respect to the “purely”
electronic excitations, and is formed as the superposition of a multiplicity of spec-
trally overlapping excitations of different vibronic eigenmodes. If the molecule has
the possibility to freely rotate in space, the picture becomes even more involved.

molecule. Please do not
confuse with the mad corona
virus; the latter is larger in
size (approximately 125 nm
in diameter) and nearly
spherical
But why a multiplicity of vibrational modes? Let us illustrate this by means
of an example [1]. In Fig. 11.1, a coronene molecule which has the sum formula
C24H12 is shown. A coronene molecule is planar and formed from the total of Na
= 36 atomic nuclei.
For estimating the number of vibrational degrees of freedom, the nuclei may be
regarded as point masses. Then, once every point mass has 3 independent degrees
of freedom in space, the system of 36 point masses is fully described by 108
coordinates, i.e., has 108 degrees of freedom. Three of them deﬁne the position
of the molecule as a whole in space (they form the three translational degrees
of freedom), and three of them are necessary to describe the orientation of the
molecule (three rotational degrees of freedom). The rest as given by 3Na-6 deﬁnes
the number of internal vibrational degrees of freedom. This leads us to 102 vibra-
tional degrees of freedom for the coronene molecule. Correspondingly, we expect
a set of 102 vibrational normal or eigenfrequencies in relation (11.3), and even
when many of them are degenerated as a consequence of the high symmetry of
the coronene molecule, we will still ﬁnd a multiplicity of different eigenfrequen-
cies which is responsible for the complicated structure of the UV spectrum of
the coronene molecule. For completeness, we mention here that in the case of
linear molecules, the discussion is slightly different: In this case, only two rota-
tional degrees of freedom are apparent, and therefore, the number of vibrational
eigenmodes is calculated by a slightly different term 3Na-5.
11.2
Physical Idea
The basic physical ideas concerning the spectral properties of molecules have
been formulated earlier when discussing quantum transitions. We start from (5.23),

264
11
Optical Spectra of Molecules
which deﬁnes the set of transition angular frequencies ωnm:
ωnm = En −Em
ℏ
In order to get access to the possible transition frequencies, we need to
have information about the energy levels that correspond to optically allowed
transitions. From (10.8), we obtain the energy levels:
E = Ee

rc, j

+ Ec −u

rc, j



	
=Tkin,c
(11.4)
The calculations in Sects. 10.3.2 and 10.6 have been performed assuming ﬁxed
positions of the nuclei; hence, what we calculated there is the term Ee

rc, j

, i.e.,
the total energy of the rigid molecule. In other words, no kinetic energy of the
nuclei has been taken into account so far. But once Ec has been interpreted as the
total mechanical energy of the nuclei, then Ec −u

rc, j

has the physical meaning
of the kinetic energy of the nuclei. Thus, (11.4) asserts that the total energy of the
molecule may be understood as the energy of the rigid molecule plus the kinetic
energy of the nuclei. Ec is practically accessible from solving (10.9), while the
corresponding kinetic energy formally contains contributions from translational,
vibrational, and rotational degrees of freedom. In order to get rid from the con-
tributions of translational movements of the whole molecule, we again choose
a coordinate system such that the mass center of the molecule is at rest. Then,
because of the large difference between characteristic vibrational and rotational
frequencies, (Chap. 2), the kinetic energy of the nuclei appears to be approximately
composed from contributions of the (faster) relative movement of the nuclei with
respect to each other (vibrations), as well as from the (much slower) rotation of
the molecule as a whole.
Thus, according to (11.4), we obtain the full energy of the molecular state when
adding the kinetic energy of the nuclei to Ee

rc, j

. For our further purposes, we
now rewrite (11.4) in the following manner:
E = Eelectronic + Ec
(11.4a)
Once Ec contains all mechanical (i.e., kinetic and potential) energy accumu-
lated in the nuclei, the rest of terms on the right side of (11.4) should have the
meaning of an electronic energy. Subdividing Ec into vibrational and rotational
contributions, we ﬁnally have:
E ≈Eelectronic + Evibr + Erot
(11.5)
Combined with (5.23), that yields:

(11.6) is a generalized version of (11.3).
The idea of the further treatment is to quantify the individual contributions to
(11.6) in terms of different models, such that the structure of molecule spectra in
different characteristic spectral regions becomes obvious.

11.3.1 Vibration and Rotation of the Diatomic Molecule
Let us now apply this knowledge to the discussion of molecular spectra. We have

relation does not provide an unambiguous deﬁnition of u

, but once we inter-
pret it as a potential that describes the relative movement of the nuclei, it makes
sense to calibrate it such that
u

rc, j →∞


(11.7)
Note that in this case, in bound states we usually have Ec < 0.
In the special case of a diatomic molecule, j = 1, 2, and we set (compare (2.7)):
r = rc,2 −rc,1; u = u(|r|) = u(r)
Then, the movement of the two nuclei in the central potential u may be regarded
as a two-body problem. In full analogy to the treatment of the hydrogen atom
((8.33) or (8.35)), we write [2]:
 = r + 1

Practically, l now acts as quantum number quantifying the rotation state of the
molecule. It is however common in molecular spectroscopy to use the letter J for
the rotational quantum number. Hence, we write instead:
ECR =

Let us now remember Fig. 2.7 or Fig. 10.7, which show a typical shape of u(r)
which has a minimum at r = r0. We further set: r = r0 + x and assume |x| ≪r0,
such that:

(11.8)
Remark This is clearly an approximation, because with respect to rotation, the
molecule is now regarded as a rigid rotor. But this model assumption makes sense
because during one rotation of the molecule, a large number of oscillations are per-
formed, so that the true distance between the atoms may be replaced by some average
performed during one oscillation: 1

oscillation. This way, at the moment we
clearly neglect the action of centrifugal forces. One should also keep in mind that the

in our approximation, we assume that 1

We obtain the equation for the molecule vibration:

(11.9)
where u(r) represents a potential like shown in Fig. 2.7 or 10.7. As already men-
tioned in Sect. 10.5.1, it could be obtained from solving a Schrödinger equation
like (10.14) in a point-by-point manner, but in many cases it is convenient to
make use of available model potentials like the Morse potential (10.30) or even a
harmonic oscillator approach.
11.3.2 Rotation Spectra of a Gas of Diatomic Molecules
Assuming a rigid rotor, from (11.8) we have:
Erot = ℏ2
2I J(J + 1); J = 0, 1, 2, ...
ψrot = ψJ,m(θ, φ); m = 0, ±1, ±2, ..., ±J
Clearly, each rotational energy level of a diatomic molecule given by J has a
degeneration of (2 J + 1).
The rotational spectral term (compare Sect. 8.3.2) is given by:
G(J) ≡Erot
hc =
ℏ
4πcI J(J + 1) ≡B J(J + 1)
(11.10)
with B—rotational constant.
For example, the rotational constant of a the CO molecule is
BCO ≈1.9 cm−1
In a purely rotational spectrum, neither the vibronic nor the electronic energy
of the molecule will change. Therefore from (11.6), we have:
ωnm = En −Em
ℏ
= En,rot −Em,rot
ℏ
≡ωrot
	
∈FIR
(11.11)
Then, the transition wavenumber between the rotational energy levels J = 0
and J = 1 is:
ν = G(1) −G(0) = 2B ≈3.8 cm−1
It clearly falls into the far infrared (FIR) spectral range.

268
11
Optical Spectra of Molecules
Let us have a look on the selection rules. Assuming electric dipole interaction,
we have the perturbation operator (6.20) (keep in mind that in a rigid rotor, r =
const, e—unit vector parallel to d):
ˆV = −dE = −qreE = −
dperm
eE
(11.12)
From here:
ˆV ̸= 0 ⇒
dperm
 ̸= 0
(11.13)
Thus, in order to record a rotation spectrum, the molecule must have a perma-
nent dipole moment dperm. Therefore, molecules like CO and HCl show a pure
rotation spectrum, while N2, H2, or O2 do not.
Note that in our approximation, a molecule like HCl is modeled as a two-body
system, where two different point masses are connected to each other with a ﬁxed
distance. Such a system is also called the dumbbell model of a diatomic molecule
(Fig. 11.2, on left).
Concerning J, so from Sect. 8.5.1, (8.49), we know the selection rule:
J = ±1
(11.14)
In a pure rotation spectrum, absorption must be accompanied by an increase in
the rotation energy, and therefore, we have the selection rule J = +1.
Therefore, when combining (11.10) and (11.11), allowed transition wavenum-
bers may be calculated according to the recipe:
νJ+1,J = G(J + 1) −G(J)
G(J)

(11.15) obviously describes a set of equidistant absorption lines located in the
far infrared spectral region. They are visualized by colored arrows in Fig. 11.2 on
right.
What about the absorption line intensity? For a single molecule, one would
have to calculate the corresponding Einstein coefﬁcients (7.22) in terms of the
dumbbell model. This is outside the scope of this course. But for a gas of freely
rotating molecules held at temperature T, a crude estimation may be provided on
the basis of (6.31). There we assumed for the absorption coefﬁcient of an ensemble
of two-level systems:
α ∝|d21|2(N1 −N2)
The simplest model would be to set the matrix element constant and calculate
the population difference from the product of energy-level degeneration multiplied
with a Boltzmann factor, such that
N(J) ∝(2J + 1)e−Erot(J)

Remark A more reﬁned treatment allows it to calculate the absorption coefﬁcient
(compare (6.31)) of a gas of rigid rotating diatomic molecules including the transi-
tion matrix elements as well as the population difference between the participating
quantum levels explicitly. Then, the absorption spectrum may be quantiﬁed in terms
of the absorption coefﬁcient as follows (11.17):

Here, the single absorption lines are assumed as Lorentzians with a (homoge-
neous) linewidth 2, and N is the concentration of molecules. Figure 11.3 shows the
absorption coefﬁcient calculated for a gas of ﬁctive molecules with B = 2 cm−1, as
a function of the wavenumber in cm−1, assuming the temperature 300 K (a), on the
left, and 500 K (b), on the right.  = 0.2 cm−1. The absorption coefﬁcient is given in
relative units, and the value 1.0 corresponds to the maximum in the 300 K spectrum.

In order to calculate the vibrational transition frequencies, we need knowledge
on the vibronic energy levels Evibr. Their position depends on the concrete shape
of u(x). Let us discuss two special cases.

According to Sect. 5.5.1, for electric dipole interaction, the corresponding
selection rule for light absorption is: v = +1
Anharmonic oscillator in terms of the Morse potential:
The anharmonic potentials as shown in Figs. 2.7 or 10.7 may be approximated by
the harmonic one in the vicinity of the potential minimum only. Otherwise, we
have required:
u(r →∞) = 0
u(r →0) →′′large′′
u(r = r0) = −D ≡−hcDe
The Morse potential is a satisfacting model potential for an anharmonic oscil-
lator, which has an exact analytical solution of the corresponding Schrödinger
equation (compare Sect. 10.5.5). It may be written as (see also Fig. 10.7 and set
D = −U0):
u(x) = D

more equidistant.
The appearance of anharmonicity has several consequences to the infrared
optical properties of molecules. Namely,
• The vibration wavenumbers corresponding to transitions starting from different
states |v⟩to the corresponding |v + 1⟩are no more identical.
• The strong selection rule v = ±1 breaks down. Instead, vibrational overtone
spectra (|v| > 1 are allowed, too. These overtone absorptions may also fall
into the NIR spectral region, while the fundamental vibration wavenumber (v =
0→v = 1) is in the MIR. Therefore, in equations like (11.6), it has explicitly
been indicated that vibrational absorption lines may occur in the NIR.
• Possible vibrational transition wavenumbers are deﬁned by:

11.3.4 Rotational-Vibrational Spectra (Diatomic Molecules)
In a rotational-vibrational spectrum without any change in the electronic state,

(11.20)
The transition wavenumber is, in our approximation, simply a sum of the vibra-
tional transition wavenumber according to (11.18) and the rotational transition
wavenumber according to (11.11). Let us again discuss two special cases.
Harmonic oscillator:
The full energy of the motion of the nuclei (except translational motion) is:

In a rotational-vibrational spectrum, the absorption of a photon leads to changes
in both the vibrational and rotational energies of the molecule.
The selection rules for the rotational-vibrational absorption spectrum of a
diatomic molecule obviously are:
Absorption: v = 1; J = ±1
This results in absorption wavenumbers:
νv+1,J ′=J±1;v,J = Gvibr(v + 1) −Gvibr(v)

(11.22)
Here, we have assumed that the rotational constant does not depend on the
vibrational excitation level. Because of B ≪ν0, the wavenumber region where

11.3
Theoretical Material
273
the rotational-vibrational spectrum of a gas of diatomic molecules is observed is
dominated by ν0 and thus located in the MIR. The rotational transitions lead to
a ﬁne substructure of that vibrational transition. The P-branch, which is formed
by rotational transitions with J = −1, is red-shifted with respect to the pure
vibrational transition frequency ν0. The R-branch, which is formed by rotational
transitions with J = + 1, is blue-shifted with respect to the pure vibrational
transition frequency ν0. Once at room temperature, in a rotational-vibrational spec-
trum, the thermal occupation of the higher energy level may be neglected, the
relative intensity I of the spectral lines may be approximated (compare (6.31))
according to:
α ∝|d21|2(N1 −N2) ∝N1 ⇒I(J) ∝(2J + 1)e−Erot (J)
kB T
= (2J + 1)e−G(J)

(11.23)
Figure 11.4 shows a calculated rotational-vibrational spectrum assuming ν0 =
2200 cm−1; B = 2 cm−1; T = 300 K;  = 0.5 cm−1. The rotational substructure
is well resolved.
Figure 11.5 shows the same with  = 5 cm−1. Here, the width of the individual
absorption lines constituting the spectrum is larger than their wavenumber separa-
tion; hence, the rotational substructure of the spectrum is no more resolved. The
resulting Doublette structure obtained this way in Fig. 11.5 is called a Bjerrum–
Doublette [3]. As it may be estimated from (11.23), the wavenumber difference
between the two peaks of a Bjerrum–Doublette is ν ≈
√
8Bϑ. Hence, the
spectrum gives access to the temperature of the gas.

The lines within the rotational substructure are no more equidistant, too. Equa-
tion (11.24) describes effects of the rotational-vibrational interaction in molecular
infrared spectroscopy (Figs. 11.6 and 11.7).
11.3.5 Electronic Transitions
In the general case of an electronic transition, the electronic state changes com-
bined with changes in the vibronic as well as rotational quantum states. Hence, it
is now (11.6) that is to be applied in its full beauty.

parabolas. The squares mark the positions of the individual absorption lines deﬁned by (11.24)
For simplicity, in this section we will refrain from explicitly mentioning the
rotational movement. What will be called “vibrational” motion here, in fact, has
to be understood as the complete complex of rotational and vibrational excitations
of the nuclei subsystem, provided, of course, that the molecule is allowed to rotate
freely.
Let us start from (11.4a). Correspondingly, any electronic eigenstate m is split
into vibrational states of the nuclei motion, numbered by v. Thereby, the interaction
potential u depends on the actual electronic conﬁguration.
Let us now consider an electronic quantum transition between two different
electronic molecular eigenstates, say m = 1 and n = 2. Our general assumption
was that during the time span relevant for an electronic transition, the coordinates
of the nuclei do not change. We have:
E1 = Ee,1 + Ec,1
E2 = Ee,2 + Ec,2
(11.25)
Let us regard the case of light absorption and assume that E2 > E1. So, the
process starts from state 1. At low temperatures, it is reasonable to assume that
prior to the absorption process, the molecule is in the vibrational ground state
(v1 = 0). Then, the expectation value of the nucleus coordinate will be close to
the equilibrium value, so that we further assume rc = rc,0,m=1. Once the electron
movement is much faster than the nuclei movement, it is further reasonable to
assume that during the quantum transition, the nucleus coordinate does not change,
but remains ﬁxed. Such a transition is visualized in Fig. 11.8.
From (11.25), it appears now straightforward to calculate the expected transition
(absorption) frequencies. One has to expect a series of absorption lines, because
the absorption process may end at different vibronic excitation levels in the excited
electronic state. But it is important to have a look on the transition matrix elements

before, because the latter deﬁne the selection rules. Some transitions may be char-
acterized by a very small matrix element and are thus not expected to contribute
to the absorption spectrum in a signiﬁcant manner. So, let us write the expression
for the dipole operator:
d =

(11.26)
By using the ansatz (10.3) for the wavefunction, the following expression for

(11.27)
Here, we have skipped the subscripts j, as well as i. In order to have an allowed
quantum transition, the mentioned matrix element must be different from zero, as
indicated in (11.27). Let us discuss the behavior of the ﬁrst and second terms in
(11.27) separately.
Concerning the ﬁrst term, the adiabatic approximation requires setting rc as
constants with respect to the electronic transitions. Hence, the ﬁrst term in (11.27)
may be written as:
&

qcrcψc1
&
ψ∗


drc = 0
(11.27a)

Optical Spectra of Molecules
This term must be zero because of the orthogonality of the electronic eigenfunc-
tions obtained at the same nucleus coordinates. Therefore, the transition matrix
element is controlled by the second term in (11.27) only. It can be written as:
&
ψ∗

&

(11.27b)
Once the ﬁrst term in (11.27) is zero, the second must be different from zero in
order to make the transition allowed. This requires the purely electronic transition
element
'

( qereψe1dre to be different from zero, which deﬁnes an electronic
selection rule (you may have noticed that we do not explicitly consider spin-related
effects in our simpliﬁed treatment—these effects are highly essential for calculat-
ing correct numerical values of the matrix elements, but not for understanding the
general ideas introduced here). And it also requires that there is a spatial overlap
of the nuclei wavefunctions ψc in the ﬁrst and second quantum states. This is the
essence of the famous Franck–Condon principle. It may suppress the efﬁciency
of certain transitions signiﬁcantly and gives rise to spectral features in molecular
spectra that are sometimes called the Franck–Condon envelope. This necessary
spatial overlap of vibrational wavefunctions in the ﬁrst and second states allows
us building an illustrative picture on how electronic transitions in molecules are
composed.
And this is what is schematically shown in Fig. 11.8. It shows assumed Ee(rc)
dependencies (as congruent to u(rc)) for the ﬁrst and second electronic states,
respectively (in navy). More precisely, the assumed in the ﬁgure Ee(rc) dependen-
cies rather represent a particular situation characteristic for diatomic molecules,
but this makes the approach more illustrative and embodies the same physical
principles. Note that the minima of the Ee(rc) curves do not necessarily coincide.
The nuclei vibrational energy levels in both electronic states are visualized by the
horizontal dashed lines. Note that each of those dotted lines corresponds to an
energy level as deﬁned by (11.25). Possible electronic quantum transitions may
therefore be illustrated by arrows, which start and end at different dashed lines
within the participating electronic eigenstates. Once the nucleus coordinate should
not change during the transition, those arrows should be vertical.
Let us now return to our assumption that the absorption process starts from the
lowest vibrational energy level in the lower electronic state. This is visualized in
the ﬁgure by the red arrow, which starts exactly from that level. As caused by the
mismatch of the minima positions of the Ee,1(rc) and Ee,2(rc) curves, the arrow
will deﬁnitely not hit the minimum of the Ee,2(rc) curve. In the illustration, the
absorption process will therefore fail to end at the lower nuclei vibrational energy
levels in the second state, because the corresponding nuclei wavefunctions have
only a very small spatial overlap. Only higher vibrational levels, as highlighted
by the red-dashed horizontal lines, have a chance to contribute to the absorption
process in a signiﬁcant manner. Each of these transitions contributes to the full
absorption spectrum at a certain frequency and an intensity, which is controlled by
the spatial overlap of the nucleus wavefunctions in (11.27b), thus giving rise to the

11.3
Theoretical Material
279
speciﬁc shape of the Franck–Condon envelope and consequently the absorption
spectrum. But most of these transitions will correspond to a somewhat higher
absorption frequency as it could be expected from the energy difference between
the minima of the Ee (rc) curves only. We therefore have:
min

ℏωabsorption

≈min Ee,2(rc) −min Ee,1(rc)
(11.28)
This visual illustration is of course very simpliﬁed, and in fact, transitions
between black-dashed lines also give their contribution to the absorption. But this
contribution is small, because of the rather vanishing spatial overlap of the “lower”
vibronic wavefunctions. Thus, when assuming a transition from the lowest vibronic
level of the electronic ground state to the lowest vibronic level of the excited elec-
tronic state, the overlap integral in (11.27b) will be controlled by the convolution
of the exponentially decaying tails of the vibronic wavefunctions, which gives a
rather vanishing contribution to the full spectrum.
The moral is that the absorption spectrum of a molecule should show a rather
complicated spectral shape, which is caused by the possible excitation of different
vibronic levels as the result of light absorption. The relative efﬁciency of these
individual contributions is controlled by expressions like (11.27b). As the con-
sequence, broad and complicated spectra may be observed, such as exempliﬁed
in Fig. 11.8. The set of principally possible absorption frequencies follows from
(11.6).
Let us ﬁnish this section with a short treatment of ﬂuorescence. Imagine that an
absorption process like that shown in Fig. 11.8 has taken place. The molecule must
now somehow “manage” the excess in energy it has gained as the result of light
absorption. Once it must come back to equilibrium with its environment with time,
energy relaxation processes will come into play. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.9.
Usually, the ﬁrst relaxation step is nonradiative: The molecule keeps being elec-
tronically excited, but the nucleus vibration relaxes down to lower vibronic energy
levels. Note that this process (shown by the dashed arrow in Fig. 11.9) is accompa-
nied by changes in the expectation values for the nucleus coordinates: The nuclei
ﬁnd their new equilibrium positions. When this process is ﬁnished, the molecule
may (if this is allowed by matrix elements like (11.27), and alternative relax-
ation processes are signiﬁcantly slower) return into the electronic ground state
by spontaneous emission of a photon. This is then observed as ﬂuorescence from
the molecule. Again, the Franck–Condon principle holds, so that this transition
is again selective with respect to the accessible vibrational energy levels in the
electronic ground state: The possibly well-accessible levels are again marked in
red, while those deﬁnitely corresponding to unlike transitions are black. And it is
immediately seen from the geometry of the ﬁgure that the red arrow, correspond-
ing to ﬂuorescence, is shorter than the navy arrow, which symbolizes absorption.
Moreover, instead of (11.28) we now have:
max(ℏωﬂuorescence) ≈min Ee,2(rc) −min Ee,1(rc)
(11.29)

The result is that ﬂuorescence spectra are usually red-shifted with respect to the
corresponding absorption spectra.
All in all, absorption and ﬂuorescence spectra deliver a different information.
Direct absorption measurements detect the migration of the previously absorbed
energy through different relaxation channels. Thus, calorimetric methods mea-
sure the sample heating caused by light absorption and thus detect the fraction
of the absorbed energy that participates in nonradiative relaxation processes. Flu-
orescence measurements are exactly complimentary: They detect what is relaxing
through radiation.
Fluorescence spectroscopy has its own terminology. In ﬂuorescence spec-
troscopy, it is common to call the absorption frequency (navy arrow in Fig. 11.9)
an excitation frequency. Note that ﬂuorescence spectroscopy may be performed in
two different ways: One can ﬁx the absorption (excitation) frequency and measure
the corresponding spectrum of emitted light. This way one records an emission
spectrum. On the other hand, one can measure the ﬂuorescence intensity at a
ﬁxed wavelength, while scanning the absorption (excitation) frequency. The then
observed spectrum resembles certain features of an absorption spectrum and is
called excitation spectrum.

How to visualize the purely rotational spectrum and the vibrational–rotational
spectrum without changes in the electronic state in such a graph?
An attempt of such an illustration is provided in Fig. 11.10. We again restrict
on two electronic states, each of them with a corresponding vibrational–rotational
substructure. Let us now explicitly distinguish between vibrational and rotational
energy levels of the nuclei motion. This is shown on right of Fig. 11.10. The black
horizontal dashed lines visualize the vibrational energy levels, and the green lines
the rotational substructure.

Obviously, a transition according to (11.6) corresponds to the solid red verti-
cal arrow. In this case, electronic as well as vibrational and rotational states are
allowed to change during the transition.
The rotational-vibrational transition according to (11.20) takes place without
changes of the electronic state. In this case, only the vibrational and rotational
states are allowed to change. This is visualized by the dashed red arrow of medium
length.
The purely rotational transition according to (11.11) takes place without chang-
ing neither the electronic nor the vibrational state. It is visualized by the shortest
vertical arrow on the right of Fig. 11.10. From this image, it might also become
clear that these three types of transition give rise to spectral features in quite
different spectral regions.
This result has been obtained earlier in terms of our classical estimation of
characteristic frequencies in molecule dynamics (Table 2.2). We may now com-
plete this table as demonstrated in Table 11.1. All in all, we recognize that the
rather simple illustration presented in Fig. 11.10 contains all discussed types of
absorption spectra.
What about our classical estimations from Chap. 2? Concerning vibrational and
electronic spectra, everything seems to be consistent with the quantum mechanical
results. Concerning the rotational spectra, the situation is a bit more complicated.
The classical estimation was:
νrot, classics =

2πc =

In terms of the rotational constant B, this can be written as:
νrot, classics =
√
2Bϑ
(11.30)
where ϑ is given by (11.16a).
Generally, in classics, there is no restriction on the value of the angular momen-
tum, so that the classical estimation obviously corresponds to some average

rotation frequency of molecules in a gas held at temperature T. On the contrary,
the quantum mechanical expression is (11.15):
νJ+1,J = B(J + 1)(J + 2) −B J(J + 1) = 2B(J + 1); J = 0, 1, 2, ...
which describes a series of equidistant absorption lines of a different intensity.
This is of course something different from the classical case. But note that the
spacing between the individual absorption lines is the narrower, the larger the mass
moment of inertia of the molecule is. Thus, in the case of sufﬁciently large (surely
not diatomic) molecules we may hope to observe some convergence between the
classical and quantum mechanical predictions.
Now, in order to establish a relation between the classical and quantum mechan-
ical expressions, we somehow need to bring the temperature into the play. Let us
therefore again regard a gas of diatomic molecules in thermal equilibrium.
In this case, the relative number of molecules with rotational quantum number
J will be given by (11.16):
N(J) ∝(2J + 1)e−Erot (J)
kB T
= (2J + 1)e−G(J)
ϑ
Let us ﬁnd the quantum number Jmax for which (11.16) reaches its maximum.
Formally regarding J as a continuous variable, we have:
∂
∂J N(J) = 0 ⇒Jmax =

ϑ
2B −1
2
Jmax corresponds to the rotational quantum number where N(J) has its
maximum. The rotational transition wavenumbers corresponding to the transi-
tion Jmax →Jmax + 1 are, according to (11.15), given by: νJmax+1,Jmax
=
2B(Jmax + 1) = B +
√
2Bϑ = B + νrot, classics
Obviously, at room temperature we have
√
2Bϑ ≫B ⇔I ≫
ℏ2
4kBT
Therefore, νJmax+1,Jmax

I>>
ℏ2
4kBT →νrot, classics
We come to the conclusion that for sufﬁciently large (and heavy) molecules, the
rotational transition wavenumber νJmax+1,Jmax converges to the classical estimation.
This has already been visualized earlier in Fig. 11.5. There, it was illustrated that
the spacing between the maxima of the envelope of the rotational-vibrational spec-
trum of a gas of diatomic molecules held at temperature T is approximately equal
to
√
8Bϑ = 2
√
2Bϑ = 2νrot, classics (Fig. 11.11). Hence, the classical rotation
wavenumber indicates the position of each of the maxima in the Bjerrum–Dou-
blette relative to the purely vibrational transition wavenumber. Again, a result is
consistent with the earlier mentioned correspondence principle.

Fig.11.11 Bjerrum–Doublette and the classical rotation wavenumber
Let us come to a last point. We have discussed (11.6), (11.20), and (11.11)
mainly from the viewpoint of the corresponding absorption processes. In Fig. 11.9,
we have also introduced spontaneous emission processes, but only from higher
excited to lower excited electronic states. What about purely vibronic or rotational
spontaneous emission spectra?
In fact, such processes are of minor practical relevance. The reason has been
discussed in Chap. 7 (compare (7.11)). It is the ω3 dependence in the expression
for the Einstein coefﬁcient A21 that makes spontaneous emission processes efﬁ-
cient at VIS/UV frequencies, which are relevant for transitions between different
electronic states. Vibrational or rotational transitions, instead, give rise to spectral
features in the MIR or FIR. Here, the frequency is much smaller, such that the
ω dependence rather leads to a suppression of spontaneous emission processes,
because other (nonemissive) relaxation processes are now faster.
11.5
Application to Practical Problems
11.5.1 Example 1: Estimation of Interatomic Distance
We will use Sect. 11.5 to indicate some analytic applications of rotational-
vibrational molecular spectroscopy. In the ﬁrst example, we will make use of the
features of the rotation spectra to get information about structural parameters of
the molecule.

11.5
Application to Practical Problems
285
Let us return to ﬁgures like Fig. 11.3 or 11.4. No matter whether we have
a purely rotational (Fig. 11.3) or a rotational-vibrational (Fig. 11.4) spectrum
recorded, the wavenumber spacing between two resolved adjacent absorption lines
is always equal to 2B. This is even true for the nonrigid rotor at low rotational
quantum numbers (compare (11.24) and later Task 11.7.1). Therefore, the mea-
sured wavenumber spacing between the rotational lines provides information about
the rotational constant and thus, because of (11.10), on the mass moment of iner-
tia of the molecule. In the case of a diatomic molecule, provided that the reduced
mass is known, the interatomic distance becomes directly accessible.
11.5.2 Example 2: Estimation of the Temperature
If a gas of molecules is held a temperature T, free rotation is allowed, and the
vibrational–rotational spectrum looks like what is presented in Figs. 11.4 or 11.5.
Thereby, the wavenumber spacing between the two maxima of the envelope of the
spectrum gives access to the product Bϑ. If B is known, the temperature may be
estimated or vice versa.
11.5.3 Example 3: Estimation of the Dissociation Energy
This is an example on the use of the Morse potential for interpreting vibrational
spectra, without considering the rotational substructure. Thus, from (11.19) we
have the vibrational transition wavenumbers for the Morse potential according to:
νnm = G(v = n) −G(v = m) = νe(1 −xe)(n −m) −νexe

n2 −m2
(11.31)
Hence, each transition wavenumber depends on two parameters, namely the
characteristic wavenumber νe and the anharmonicity xe. In turn, two measured
transition wavenumbers will give access to both νe and xe, and consequently, all
other transition frequencies may be predicted by means of (11.19). And, in partic-
ular, the dissociation energy may be predicted by means of (10.33). This will be
the essence of this section.
Nevertheless, the present task is a bit more tricky. Imagine that you have mea-
sured the absorption spectrum of a gas of (CF3)3CH molecules. This is no more a
diatomic molecule, but the stretching vibration of the C–H group is much higher
in frequency than the other normal vibrations of this molecule, such that the C–
H stretching vibration may be considered as a vibration of the H atom relative
to the rest of the molecule. This way we nevertheless have some similarity with
the situation in a diatomic molecule. Assume now that you observe the funda-
mental transition wavenumber of the stretch vibration of the CH group as ν1,0
= 2992 cm−1. You also register the transition wavenumber corresponding to the
ﬁrst overtone as ν2,0 = 5882 cm−1. From these data, assuming a Morse potential
and neglecting any rotations, estimate the energy (in eV) necessary to dissociate a
single CH group if the gas is held at room temperature [5].

286
11
Optical Spectra of Molecules
Provided that the gas is held at room temperature, we may assume that the
thermal energy is much smaller than the energy necessary to excite a vibration
of the CH group. Hence, prior to the absorption process, the Morse oscillator
is certainly in its ground state. The energy necessary to dissociate the CH group
starting from the vibrational ground state is different from the classical dissociation
energy D (compare Fig. 10.7). Provided that Evibr = 0 corresponds to dissociation
(Fig. 10.7), then the energy necessary for dissociation from the vibrational ground
state is simply equal to Ediss = −Evibr, ground state = −hcG(v = 0). From
G(v) = −De + νe

we have the ground-state energy as

hc < 0
Once G = 0 corresponds to dissociation, the former equation obviously
deﬁnes the energy Ediss = −hcG(v = 0) =

hc necessary for
dissociation. From (10.33) xe =

4De we have then:
G(v = 0) = −De(1 −xe)2
or Ediss = hcDe(1 −xe)2
So, one has to ﬁnd xe and De in order to solve the task.
Let us return to (11.31). When setting m = 0, we have:
νn,0 = νe

(1 −xe)n −xen2
. For two given transition wavenumbers, if νn1,0
and νn2,0, it follows that:a ≡

When setting n1 = 1 (fundamental vibration) and n2 = 2 (ﬁrst overtone) as

Then, from νn1,0 = νe

We further obtain:

and ﬁnally Ediss = hcDe(1 −xe)2 ≈5.66 eV
This is by the way a value close to what we have assumed in our classical
estimation of molecular vibrational frequencies in Sect. 2.5.1.
I hope these examples are sufﬁcient to provide an idea on the value of infrared
spectroscopy for analytic purposes.

Symmetric top molecules are subdivided into prolate (IA = IB > IC) and
oblate (IA = IB < IC) top molecules. Thus, ClCH3 is a prolate top, and C6H6
an oblate top. Also, all linear molecules are at the same time prolate tops. The
degeneration of their rotational energy levels is 2(2J + 1)@ K ̸=0 and (2J + 1)
@ K = 0.

Optical Spectra of Molecules
In order to not confuse the criteria for prolate and oblate tops, the simple
mnemonic trick is just to remember that linear molecules represent extreme
cases of prolate top. Their mass moment of inertia is 0 = IC < IA = IB.
Remark Note that the wavefunctions of the symmetric top are obtained as common
wavefunctions of the operators for L2, Lζ, and Lz, where z corresponds to a Cartesian
coordinate in the laboratory coordinate system. This topic is beyond the scope of this
course, but let us mention that the wavefunctions corresponding to the rotation of the
symmetric top |J, K, M⟩depend on three quantum numbers J, K, and M [7]. Once
the rotation energy is independent on M (which denotes the projection of L on the
z-axis), the degeneration of each rotational energy level with respect to M is 2J + 1.
If K ̸=0, the rotation energy does not depend on the sign of K; therefore, we have
an additional twofold degeneration with respect to K. Hence, the full degeneration
of an energy level with K ̸=0 is 2(2J + 1).
Note that, in contrast to the diatomic molecule, we now have two rotational
constants A and B!
Spherical top molecules: In the case of a spherical top molecule, we have:
(IA = IB = IC) ⇒Erot = ℏ2
2IA
J(J + 1);
Grot = B J(J + 1); B =
ℏ
4πcIA
In this case, each energy level is degenerated for (2J + 1)2 times. Examples
are provided by SF6 or CH4.
For observing a purely rotational absorption spectrum, the permanent electric
dipole moment of the molecule must be different from zero. Therefore, exactly
spherical top molecules do not show a purely rotational absorption spectrum. Sym-
metric top molecules may show rotational absorption spectra, and the selection
rules are J = +1 and K = 0.
11.6.2 Molecule Vibration
According to Sect. 11.1, the number of vibrational degrees of freedom of a
molecule built from a number of Na atoms is 3Na-6 (or 3Na-5, if the molecule is
linear). A diatomic molecule (Na = 2) is surely linear such that 3Na-5 = 1. The
well-known conclusion is that in a diatomic molecule, we have only one vibra-
tional degree of freedom. If Na > 2, instead of a single vibrational wavenumber
νe, we have a set of vibrational wavenumbers {νe,j}.
Thus, for example, the CO2 molecule is linear, and thus, it has 3NA-5 = 4
vibrational degrees of freedom:

• An asymmetric stretching vibration (IR-active)
• A symmetric stretching vibration (IR-inactive)
• A twofold degenerated bending vibration (IR-active).
Here, the terminus “IR-active” denotes that the intensity of the according absorp-
tion line in the IR spectrum is different from zero (i.e., the transition dipole matrix
element and the oscillator strength are different from zero). It is rather illustrative
that an asymmetric stretching vibration of a molecule like CO2 forms an oscil-
lating dipole moment. The IR-inactive symmetric stretching vibration cannot be
excited by absorption of a photon, because no vibrating dipole moment is induced
this way. Instead, the vibration rather leads to a modulation of the volume occu-
pied by the molecule, which makes the corresponding transition observable in the
so-called Raman spectrum of the molecule (see Sect. 12.5.3). Therefore, this mode
is called to be Raman-active. Note that in any centrosymmetric system (such as
CO2), no vibration mode may be both IR-active and Raman-active (rule of mutual
exclusion).
In the general case of an anharmonic oscillator (not necessarily Morse), the
vibrational term is usually approximated in terms of a series like (11.34):

(11.34)
Here, the ﬁrst term denotes the harmonic contribution to the spectral term, while
the second and possible further terms correspond to anharmonic contributions. In
addition to pure overtones, where the quantum number of a ﬁxed jth vibration
mode changes for a value vj > 1, (11.34) also allows for combination tone spec-
tra, where more than one vibrational modes become excited as a result of a single
photon absorption process.
11.6.3 Rotational-Vibrational Spectra
As a characteristic of rotational-vibrational spectra of polyatomic molecules,
so-called Q-branches, corresponding to J = 0, may be allowed. Thus, in a sym-
metric top, rotational-vibrational transitions are subdivided into those forming the
parallel bands (the vibrational dipole moment change is parallel to the molecule
symmetry axis) and perpendicular bands (the vibrational dipole moment change is
perpendicular to the molecule symmetry axis). The selection rules are:
Parallel band: K = 0; J = −1, 0, +1 (except K = 0, then J = −1, +1).
Perpendicular band: J = −1, 0, +1; K = −1, +1.

290
11
Optical Spectra of Molecules
Hence, every vibrational transition is accompanied by a series of rotational
transitions, as deﬁned by the mentioned selection rules. The relative intensities
IJ,K of the individual transitions J,K →J′, K′ may be approximated by:
IJ,K ≈(2J + 1)g(K)AK Je−Grot(J,K)
ϑ
(11.35)
Here, g(K) is the degeneracy with respect to K, i.e., g(K = 0) = 1 and g(K ̸=0)
= 2. Grot is given by (11.33). The AKJ are Hönl–London factors as given in Table
11.2 (compare [8]).
Figures 11.12 and 11.13 show simulated rotational-vibrational spectra of the
parallel band of a ﬁctive symmetrical top molecule without and with rotational-
vibrational interaction.
These mentioned selection rules seem confusing, and it is therefore
prospective to develop an illustration of their origin. Again, these illus-
trations cannot be regarded as a derivation, and they are neither exact nor
complete. Let us start from the simplest case, the diatomic molecule. Let
ζ coincide with the molecular axis. Then, Ic = 0. In this case,
L = I ⇒L =
⎛
⎝
Lξ
Lη
0
⎞
⎠
Thus, the vector of the angular momentum is always perpendicular to the
symmetry axis ζ. On the other hand, the dipole moment induced by the
vibration of the two nuclei dvibr is parallel to ζ. We thus have: L⊥dvibr.
Let us now come to our illustration (Fig. 11.14). We will try to repro-
duce the mentioned selection rules by purely geometrical considerations,
without any calculation of matrix elements.

It seems reasonable that a linearly polarized light wave is most efﬁciently
interacting with the molecular vibration if E∥Dvibr . The linear polariza-
tion of the light can be represented as the superposition of two circularly
polarized waves, corresponding to two possible directions of the photon
spin Sphot, namely parallel or antiparallel to the wavevector k. Thus, in
the circularly polarized wave, E rotates in a plane perpendicular to k,
while the molecule rotates in the plane perpendicular to L. Then, interac-
tion between the wave and the molecule rotation should be most effective
when these two planes coincide, i.e., when L is parallel or antiparallel to
k. In this case, the photon spin is either parallel or antiparallel to L. After
absorption of the photon, angular momentum conservation requires that
L’ = L±Sphot. Once the photon has an integer spin, this results in J’ =
J ±1.
Let us now adapt this geometrical picture to the parallel band in a
symmetric top molecule (Fig. 11.15, prolate top).

allel band of a symmetric top molecule. The white dashed line indicated the symmetry
axis of the top
Once the vibrational dipole moment is here parallel to the molecule axis
again, the same argumentation as before leads us to the conclusion that
the photon spin is perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the top. Then,
it is reasonable assuming that the absorption of the photon cannot change
the projection of L on the molecule axis, such that K = 0 must be
expected. On the other hand, L is no more necessarily perpendicular
to the molecule axis. Therefore, photon spin and L may form different
angles, such that the photon spin may have projections parallel as well
as perpendicular to L. As a result, L may change its length (J = ±1)
and/or its direction (J = 0). Compared to the diatomic molecule, the
appearance of a Q-branch appears as the result of the modiﬁed angles
between the molecule symmetry axis and the angular momentum of the
molecule. Only if K = 0, we have the same geometrical conditions as
in the diatomic molecule, and correspondingly J = 0 becomes forbid-
den. Consequently, the corresponding Hönl–London factor (Table 11.2)
becomes equal to zero.
When accepting this illustration, the discussion of the perpendicular band
becomes straightforward (Fig. 11.16):

the molecule axis, and thus, K = ±1 becomes allowed. For J, we have
J = 0, ±1 again, even if K = 0.

The polarizability concept is extremely useful for quanƟfying the opƟcal response of microscopic 
objects. In the conƟnuum theory, it provides a link to macroscopic opƟcal constants by using the 
concept of local electric ﬁelds. The laƩer may be calculated as the ﬁeld inside a ﬁcƟve microscopic 
cavity created in a macroscopic piece of material. These ﬁcƟve caviƟes are assumed to host the 
microscopic dipoles, and in many manageable models, they are of spherical or ellipsoidal shapes.

From Atoms and Molecules
to Continuous Media
Abstract
The concept of the microscopic polarizability is introduced to provide a link
between microscopic and macroscopic dielectric properties of matter. The
relation between static electric polarizability and static dielectric constant is
derived in terms of the Clausius–Mossotti equation. The concept is generalized
to typical optical frequencies. A semiclassical expression of the microscopic
polarizability is derived basing on a perturbative approach.
12.1
Starting Point
This chapter marks some turning point in the internal logical structure of this
course. While the previous chapters exclusively dealt with basic features of the
optical response of microscopic objects such as atoms or molecules, we will
now turn to the optical properties of spatially extended media. We have good
motivations for that:
• Exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation are only available for selected
quantum systems with a restricted number of degrees of freedom.
• Many technological applications, however, base on functional units that are
large enough for being inaccessible to a stringent quantum mechanical treat-
ment.
• Therefore, for accurately predicting the optical properties of a macroscopic
system (forward search), we need to have a recipe that links the results
of the quantum mechanical treatment of its microscopic constituents to its
macroscopic optical properties.

• Also, many optical characterization experiments are performed on rather macro-
scopic samples. If you wish to conclude from maybe a measured spectrum on
the properties of the microscopic units that build the sample (reverse search),
you will again need some recipe that links the macroscopic optical parameters
to the microworld.
All in all, what we need is to complete the following scheme (Fig. 12.1).
What we have done so far was to develop a theory about the optical behavior of
objects that belong to the microworld. What remains to be done is to create a cor-
responding picture of light–matter interactions in the macroworld and to connect
it to the microscopic description. This way we proceed moving along our logical
path deﬁned by the bottom-up approach.
This chapter will therefore introduce and/or recall several concepts useful for
interlinking the microworld with the macroworld. We will start by introducing
the microscopic polarizability and demonstrate its use for predicting macroscopic
dielectric properties of matter in the special case of electrostatics.
But let us ﬁrstly distinguish the major states of matter (Table 12.1) in termini
of their bulk modulus and their shear modulus:
All of these states of matter are built, on a microscopic level, from atomic
nuclei and corresponding electrons. Concerning the electrons, in the following
classical picture we will strongly distinguish between free and bound electrons.
Bound electrons “belong” to a nucleus: If they are displaced from their equilibrium
position, they will suffer a restoring force that pulls them back to the equilibrium

position (Fig. 12.2). Free electrons feel no restoring force, they may freely move
through a macroscopic medium and give thus rise to a speciﬁc phenomenon called
DC electric conduction.
Therefore, with respect to its static electrical conductivity, classic matter may
further be classiﬁed into electrical insulators (only bound charge carriers) and elec-
trical conductors (with free charge carriers). This is a very rough classiﬁcation for
the moment, we will later see that it makes sense to introduce the class of semi-
conductors as some separate group with electric properties somewhere in-between
insulators and conductors.
With respect to its density, we will distinguish between condensed matter
(solids, liquids) and gaseous macroscopic media.
12.2
Physical Idea
For a description of macroscopic optical phenomena, we will entirely use a clas-
sical continuum approach. The basic idea is visualized in Fig. 12.3. Imagine a

302
12
From Atoms and Molecules to Continuous Media
Fig.12.3 Illustration of the continuum approach. Details see text
macroscopic system built up from a tremendous number of small microscopic
objects. This system is shown in Fig. 12.3 left on top. The microscopic building
units are shown as blue spheres—for example, this can be molecules in a liquid.
Let us now imagine that this system is interacting with an electromagnetic wave
such that the characteristic sizes of and distances between the microscopic units
are much smaller than the wavelength of the incident wave. Then, the electromag-
netic wave will be unable to resolve the spatial structure of the system. In this case,
instead of describing the optical properties of the real system, we will replace it
by the model of a continuous medium, i.e., a ﬁctive optically homogeneous mate-
rial (left on bottom) which interacts with the mentioned wave in a nearly identical
manner as the real system (left on top) does.
The replacement of the real system by that homogeneous “pap” is the ﬁrst step
in our further description. In the next chapter, we will introduce so-called optical
constants, which formally describe the optical properties of such a continuous
material.
Of course, we still need to “transport” our knowledge on the optical behavior of
microscopic (classical or quantum) objects into that macroscopic picture. This is
visualized in the right half of Fig. 12.3. Let us select one of the microscopic units
(the bright blue one) from the original system (right on top). And let us further
assume, that we are able to calculate the interaction of that microscopic object
with an incident electromagnetic ﬁeld.

12.3
Theoretical Material
303
The problem is that the selected microscopic unit may “feel” an electric ﬁeld
that is different from that of the external light wave incident to the full system.
Indeed, the incident light wave interacts with all microscopic units, and not only
with the selected one. As a consequence, what the selected unit “feels” is the
superposition of the incident ﬁeld with the ﬁelds created by the other microscopic
objects. As a result, the selected object feels a speciﬁc local ﬁeld Eloc that needs
to be calculated.
This idea is easily transferred into the continuum language. Let us imagine
that the selected unit is placed into a ﬁctive microscopic cavity that has been cre-
ated within the continuous medium (right on bottom). Then, the ﬁeld inside this
cavity is associated with the mentioned local ﬁeld. Provided we are able to cal-
culate the ﬁeld in that cavity, we ﬁnd the ﬁeld locally incident to the microscopic
unit. Once we know the reaction of the microscopic unit to any incident ﬁeld,
we can calculate the reaction of the microscopic object even when it is part of a
macroscopic system. This is the basic idea of interlinking microscopic and macro-
scopic optical descriptions, and it will ﬁnd its ﬁnal expression later in terms of the
Clausius–Mossotti and Lorentz–Lorenz equations.

12.3.1 Microscopic Dipoles and Microscopic Polarizability
Let us now imagine an isolated microscopic object, being illuminated by a
monochromatic light wave according to E = E0e−iωt. Its characteristic dimen-
sions should be much smaller than the wavelength of the light, and therefore the
ﬁeld is considered as spatially homogeneous over the extensions of the object. We
have to expect that the electric ﬁeld E of the incident wave results in the formation
of a dipole moment d in the object. We generally write:
d = d(E)

Here the ﬁeld-independent term forms a permanent dipole moment, while the

responsible for describing basic linear optical properties of microscopic objects.
The β(j)—terms are called hyperpolarizabilities and are essential for the effects

nonlinear terms, we would have to use an electric ﬁeld as given by (6.20a), i.e., as
E = E0,real cos ωt instead of E = E0e−iωt. This detail will be topic of Chap. 18,
but in essence, according to Euler’s formula, we will have to add the conjugate
complex term to E = E0e−iωt in (12.2).
Moreover, in the general case, the β-values in (12.2) will be tensors of different
order. In order to not overload the formulas, we will prefer a scalar writing of the
polarizabilities, i.e., presume certain optical isotropy.
Let us now assume that the object has no permanent electric dipole moment,
but forms an induced dipole moment d as the result of the interaction with the
monochromatic electric ﬁeld E (Fig. 12.4). For sufﬁciently weak ﬁeld strength E
(again see later Chap. 18), the linear term in (12.2) will be the dominating one,
and from (12.2) we ﬁnd (12.3):
d = ε0βE
(12.3)
Generally, β may depend on the angular frequency and may even show resonant
behavior (compare Sect. 2.5). A simple and physically transparent classical model
for describing the frequency dependence of the linear polarizability is provided by
the so-called oscillator model.
12.3.2 The Oscillator Model
The oscillator model derived in the following is very general. It may be applied to
the intramolecular motion of nuclei (in infrared spectroscopy) as well as to bound
electrons. So that we will simply speak in the following on (microscopic) induced
dipole moments, and do not care about their physical origin.
So let us regard the motion of a single charge carrier, which is bound to its
equilibrium position (x = 0) by an elastic restoring force. An oscillating ﬁeld may
lead to small (x ≪λ) movements of the charge carriers, thus inducing dipoles that
interact with the ﬁeld. The equation of motion of a single charge carrier with mass
m is given by (2.13):
qE = qE0e−iωt = m ¨x + 2γ m ˙x + mω2
0x
This is the equation for forced oscillations of a damped harmonic oscillator with
the eigenfrequency ω0. From (2.14), we obtain the microscopic dipole moment d

(12.4)
Note that within a macroscopic medium, the acting electric ﬁeld has to be
associated with what we have called the local ﬁeld in Sect. 12.2. When comparing
(12.3) and (12.4), we quickly ﬁnd the polarizability according to:
β = q2

ω2

(12.5)
Equation (12.5) describes a resonant behavior of the microscopic dipole, when
the angular frequency ω of the ﬁeld approaches the angular eigenfrequency of the
dipole. In this resonance condition, the interaction between radiation and matter is
expected to be most effective.
Note that the linear polarizability has the dimension of the volume. The model
that was described here is usually called the Lorentzian oscillator model. More
speciﬁcally, because of the presence of one single resonance frequency, it is
sometimes called the single oscillator model.
Let us therefore generalize the oscillator model to the so-called multioscillator
model. Instead of one resonance frequency, we have now a set of M discrete res-
onance frequencies {ω0j} for each oscillator. The natural generalization of (12.5)
becomes:
β = q2

(12.6)
The real factor f j describes the relative strength of the absorption lines accord-
ing to the different degrees of freedom. If we deal with a molecule, for example,
different normal vibrations of the nuclei or various electronic oscillations may thus
be taken into account.
12.3.3 Electrostatics of Dielectric Media: Macroscopic Polarization
of the Medium
Let us now turn to electrostatics, i.e., the reaction of the medium to a constant
electric ﬁeld. In insulators, free electrons are absent, and an applied static electric
ﬁeld does cause electric current, but rather the formation of microscopic dipole
moments d. Note that in terms of the oscillator model, the static polarizability
βstat = β(ω = 0)

306
12
From Atoms and Molecules to Continuous Media
according to (12.5) or (12.6) is always real and larger than zero. Therefore, accord-
ing to (12.3), a static microscopic dipole moment will be induced whenever an
electric ﬁeld is applied.
The dipole moment per unit volume forms the macroscopic polarization vector
P:
P =
	
j d j
V
= N⟨d⟩
(12.7)
N is here the concentration. The displacement vector D is deﬁned as:
D = ε0E + P
(12.8)
As it is known from courses on electricity, at a surface or interface between
two media, the normal component of the displacement vector is continuous.
Let us now consider the interface between vacuum and a macroscopic dielectric
(Fig. 12.5). In vacuum, we apply an external electric ﬁeld E0, while the polariza-
tion of vacuum is naturally equal to zero. At the interface to the dielectric, the
induction of static dipoles in the dielectric (P ̸= 0) results in the formation of
surface charges. Therefore, the electric ﬁeld E in the dielectric is different from
the external electric ﬁeld E0. This is illustrated in Fig. 12.5.
The continuity of the induction vector at the interface results in:

(12.9)
Let us now consider that, in analogy to (12.3), the induced polarization P is
proportional to the electric ﬁeld in the dielectric. Once P is, according to (12.7),
some ensemble average, it makes sense to associate E with the average ﬁeld in the
medium, which we now consider as a continuum. We therefore write:
P = ε0χstatE ⇒D = ε0E + P = ε0εstatE; εstat = 1 + χstat > 1

This way we have introduced the (sometime called relative) static dielectric
constant εstat. The parameter χstat is called the (linear) static dielectric sus-
ceptibility of the dielectric. Consequently, when taking (12.9) into account, we
ﬁnd
⇒E0,⊥> E⊥
In the medium, the electric ﬁeld is (in average) smaller than outside. The phys-
ical reason is transparent and obvious from Fig. 12.5: It is due to the formation
of an uncompensated surface charge formed as a result of the polarization of
the medium. The static dielectric constantεstat turns out to be a function of the
polarizability of the microscopic units forming the condensed system and their
concentration N, as it will be shown in Sect. 12.3.4.
12.3.4 Clausius–Mossotti Equation
Let us assume a system of identical induced microscopic dipoles. According to
(12.7), the macroscopic polarization may be written as:
P = Nd
(12.11)
The induced microscopic dipole moment itself may be expressed through the
microscopic polarizability β:
d = ε0βstatEloc ⇒P = Nε0βstatEloc
(12.12)
On the other hand, in our continuum approach, we have (12.10):
P = ε0χstatE = ε0(εstat −1)E
(12.13)
Here we have assumed isotropy of the continuous medium, such that we refrain
from the vector character of ﬁeld and polarization.
The problem is as follows: (12.13) describes the macroscopic response of the
medium, and the electric ﬁeld ﬁxed in (12.5) is the average ﬁeld in that medium. It
is formed from the external ﬁeld and the ﬁeld of all the dipoles in the medium. On
the contrary, (12.12) describes a microscopic dipole moment, and the ﬁeld is the
microscopic (or local) ﬁeld acting on the selected dipole. The question is, whether
or not these ﬁelds are identical.
In the general case, these ﬁelds are different, and the aim of this section is to
derive an equation that allows us to calculate the microscopic (local) ﬁeld for the
special case of optically isotropic materials.
Let us regard a single induced dipole in the medium. The ﬁeld acting on
the dipole is built from two constituents: the external ﬁeld and the ﬁeld caused
by all other dipoles, except the considered one (Fig. 12.6 on top). Of course,

Fig.12.6 Idea of calculating the local ﬁeld by means of the superposition principle
nobody would start the calculation from the external ﬁeld, subsequently adding
the response of 1023 dipoles. Instead, we will make use of the superposition prin-
ciple. We will subtract the ﬁeld of our regarded dipole from the average ﬁeld in
the medium, and this way we can ﬁnd the ﬁeld that is acting on the selected dipole
itself.
In continuum electrostatics, this calculation is easy to perform, replacing the
dipole by a small polarized sphere (in accordance with the assumed isotropy).
In Fig. 12.6 on bottom, our approach is visualized. On the left, we have the con-
tinuous medium with a small microscopic spherical cavity inside. The ﬁeld inside
this cavity corresponds to the mentioned microscopic (or local) ﬁeld, because
it may be considered as the ﬁeld in the compact medium less the ﬁeld in a
homogeneously polarized sphere.
This allows calculating the local ﬁeld in an explicit manner. When postulating
a homogeneous polarization in the continuous medium, the ﬁeld E must also be
homogeneous, and we have:
Eloc = E −Esphere
(12.14)

12.3

As the ﬁeld in a homogeneously polarized sphere is equal to −P/3ε0 (compare
task 12.7.1), from (12.14) we obtain:

For small concentrations (N →0), which is valid for diluted gases, from (12.16)
we have:

(12.16a)
(12.16) is called the Clausius–Mossotti Equation. It establishes the necessary rela-
tion between macro-and microworlds by relating the static dielectric constant to
the static microscopic polarizability and vice versa. This way measurements on a
macroscopic sample may give information on microscopic parameters, such as the
microscopic polarizability.

12.3.5 Electrical Conductors
Let us now turn to the effects caused by free electrons. The physical assumption
in the Drude theory of electric conduction is that the movement of the electrons is
dominated by two contributions: an isotropic chaotic thermal movement that does
not contribute to electric charge transport, and a drift movement that gives rise
to macroscopic electric charge transport, i.e., to electric conduction. In a direct
current, which results from a time-independent electric ﬁeld, the drift velocity is
constant, such that all forces that might inﬂuence the drift velocity sum up to zero.
Our assumption was that there is no restoring force acting on free charge carriers
(here electrons), such that in analogy to (2.13) we now write:

F = qE −me
τ vD = −eE −me
τ vD = 0
(12.17)
In analogy to Sect. 2.3.3, τ corresponds to some characteristic decay time. In
the present physical situation, it is associated with some average time between two
collisions of conduction electrons with atomic cores. From (12.17) we ﬁnd:
−e
me
τ E = vD
The term
e
me τ deﬁnes the mobility of the electron in a classical language.
When introducing the current density j via:
j = qNevD
With Ne—carrier concentration; we ﬁnd:

τ E ≡σstatE

where we have introduced the static electrical conductivity σ stat:

τ
(12.19)
Note that the static conductivity depends on the square of the charge of
the charge carriers. Therefore, measurements of the conductivity do not provide
information on whether the charges are positive or negative.
What about a temperature dependence of the conductivity? It is reasonable
expecting that an increase in temperature leads to a reduction of the collision time
τ, and thus, according to (12.19), to a decrease in electric conductivity. This is the
situation typically observed in metals. In so-called semiconductors, however, the
concentration of free charge carriers Ne tends to strongly increase when the tem-
perature is increased. This effect usually overcompensates the decrease in τ, such

Remark Note that in many practically relevant situations, the drift velocity of elec-
trons in an electric conductor is much smaller than their thermal velocity (compare
task 12.7.2). It is comparable to the propagation velocity of a snail (see Fig. 12.7).
The Roman snail shown in this ﬁgure moves with a rather high velocity of three
meters per hour, which even exceeds the typical electron drift velocities.
12.4
Consistency Considerations
Microscopic objects: Let us start with some considerations on what we are calling
a microscopic polarizability. The term “microscopic” indicates that the polarizing
object is rather “small”. But what is meant with “small” in this connection? In
other words: What is the reference length, that might be considered as “large”
compared to the spatial extension of the “small” object?
In many standard textbooks, the polarizability is introduced as some atomic
or molecular polarizability, thus describing the speciﬁc response of single atoms
or molecules to an electric ﬁeld. Atoms and molecules are (sub-)nanometer-
sized objects (Table 1.1) and are clearly associated with the microworld. In other
branches, such as cluster physics, the polarizability concept is successfully applied
to much larger units, namely clusters with sizes up to at least 10–20 nm. It
would clearly be misleading to speak on atomic or molecular polarizabilities in

312
12
From Atoms and Molecules to Continuous Media
that context. For that reason, dear reader, I prefer the terminus of a “microscopic
polarizability”.
Of course, this terminus may be misinterpreted as well. When associating “mi-
croscopic” with “micrometer-sized”, we will clearly cause confusion. In fact, in
our treatment, we use the terminus “microscopic polarizability” as a parameter
characterizing the properties of objects with spatial extensions much smaller than
the wavelength of the light which interacts with the object. Thus, when speaking
on photonics in practical applications, the wavelength of the light is usually larger
than 100 nm, and object sizes of around 20 nm seem to represent the upper limit
of the applicability of that concept. On the other hand, the application of the polar-
izability in our understanding may become problematic even when being applied
to atoms, namely when they interact with X-rays.
Thus, it is the wavelength of the light that provides the characteristic length,
which should be large compared to the spatial extensions of the polarizing object.
We have to pay a price for that: in electrostatics, the “wavelength” is inﬁnitely
large, and there is no upper limit for the applicability of our polarizability concept.
Indeed, when calculating the local ﬁeld in a dielectric (Fig. 12.6), no assumption
was made on the diameter on the ﬁctive cavity that hosts the dipole. In fact, in elec-
trostatics, such cavities may be rather large. Consequently, the static polarizability
of objects with arbitrary size can be calculated this way, and we will demonstrate
this in Sect. 12.5.1. In such cases, we will simply speak on a polarizability, and
skip the terminus “microscopic”.
In optics, the wavelength has a ﬁnite value, and in fact the electric ﬁeld is no
more spatially homogeneous. Therefore, in order to make use of equations like
(12.15) or (12.16) at optical frequencies, we must require that the diameter of the
“ﬁctive sphere” is much smaller that the wavelength. Once the ﬁctive sphere hosts
the microscopic dipole, the latter must also be much smaller than the wavelength,
which is consistent with our understanding of the “microscopic” polarizability.
Thus, although the ﬁeld in a light wave is rapidly oscillating, in application to
sufﬁciently small objects, we make use of the model case of a spatially homoge-
neous ﬁeld—exactly like in electrostatics. This approach is called the quasistatic
approximation.
Shape of the ﬁctive cavity: In Sect. 12.3.4, we have calculated the local ﬁeld
by creating a ﬁctive cavity in the medium, while the cavity was assumed to be of
spherical shape. This assumption results in expression (12.15). But why a spherical
shape? And what about other shapes?
A sphere is something isotropic, and it makes sense to apply this approach
to isotropic materials. In anisotropic materials, other cavity shapes may be rea-
sonable. The point is that other cavity shapes will result in other expressions for
the local ﬁeld. Let us shortly have a look at Fig. 12.8 to understand the physical
reason.
In the picture on the left of Fig. 12.8, we ﬁnd the familiar situation of a spherical
cavity. The difference between E and Eloc is explained by the presence of surface
charges at the border of the cavity. We have:
Spherical cavity: Eloc = εstat+2

Fig.12.8 Illustration of the physical origin for the dependence of the local ﬁeld on the cavity
shape
Let us now have a look at the situation shown in the picture on right. It shows
a pancake-shaped cavity with an axis parallel to the applied ﬁeld. The effect of the
surface charges should be even stronger that in the case of a spherical cavity. In
the extreme case, the charges at the border of the cavity completely compensate
those at the outer borders of the whole macroscopic object. We therefore have:
Pancake: Eloc = E0 = εstatE.
Let us now turn to the picture in the middle. It shows a needle-like cavity with
an axis parallel to the ﬁeld. The effect of the surface charges is rather negligible
here. Instead, because of the continuity of the tangential components of the electric
ﬁeld (Table 12.2 the row on bottom), we have:
Needle: Eloc = E.
Thus, because of the differences in the relevance of surface charges, the local
ﬁeld in a cavity will be strongly dependent on the assumed cavity shape.
The different expressions for the local ﬁeld may be condensed into one
expression, namely:
Eloc = [1 + (εstat −1)L]E
where L is a so-called depolarization factor. The previously discussed particular
cases correspond to L-values of L = 1/3 (sphere), L = 1 (pancake), and L = 0
(needle).
Table 12.3 summarizes important values for depolarization factors in different
situations.
But what about conduction electrons? In Sect. 12.3.5 (electrostatics of electric
conductors), we did not care about local ﬁelds at all. The reason is simple to be
understood at least in a classical picture. Indeed, a free electron is allowed to
travel over large distances in the material and therefore rather feels the average

macroscopic ﬁeld E than a local ﬁeld. This idea is nevertheless also consistent
with the local ﬁeld picture: Just imagine that the electron drifts along the direction
of the ﬁeld. Then, according to Table 12.3, its movement appears to be conﬁned
in a needle-like cavity, hence L = 0 and Eloc = E.
Note in this connection, that (12.16a) may be obtained in different ways.
It immediately follows from (12.16) in the limiting case N→0. But is also
obtained for an arbitrary concentration, just assuming L = 0. Indeed, assuming
L = 0; Eloc = E, we have:
P = ε0(εstat −1)E = Nε0βstatEloc = Nε0βstatE ⇒εstat = 1 + Nβstat
Oscillating ﬁelds: Of course, our primary goal is to apply this stuff not to elec-
trostatics, but to optics. The good news is, that in application to dielectrics, the
structure of our expressions will not change as long as we are able to make use
of the quasistatic approximation. Therefore, in Table 12.3, the subscript “stat” has
already been skipped in all expressions. Of course, so far we have not introduced
an ε valid at optical frequencies, but that will be topic of Chap. 13.
And concerning bulk metals? We will simplify the situation even more. Once
in an oscillating ﬁeld, the free electrons are expected to perform an oscillating
movement as well, we will tackle them as oscillating dipoles and ﬁnally include
their response into the polarization vector and the not yet introduced ε valid at
optical frequencies. This will be done in Chap. 14. Note that the thus introduced
induced dipole moment of a free electron formally becomes inﬁnitely large at
ω→0.
Semiclassical considerations: So far we have performed a purely classical dis-
cussion of the polarizability concept. A particular feature of this treatment is, that
in (12.12), we have implicitly assumed that the polarizability of an isolated single

12.5
Application to Practical Problems
315
dipole coincides with the polarizability of a dipole which is part of a macro-
scopic system. In general, this assumption is obviously misleading. When taking
the polarizability of a single silicon atom, you will never be able to predict the
properties of a silicon crystal with a given density simply by applying the Clau-
sius–Mossotti Eq. (12.16). The reason is, that in the process of covalent bonding
of the silicon atoms when forming a crystal, new electronic wavefunctions are
formed (compare Chap. 10 and later Chap. 16), and they will certainly result in
polarizing properties that differ from those of the isolated atom. Therefore, our
simple Clausius-Mossotti approach is applicable for any processes where dipoles
are physically mixed, without changing the electronic properties of the individual
dipoles. As soon as chemical bonding comes into play, the approach presented so
far is insufﬁcient.
This rises the question on how the polarizability of a quantum system may be
calculated. A corresponding sample calculation will be presented in Sect. 12.6. The
basic idea is that the calculation of d by solving the classical Newton’s equation of
motion (2.13) will be replaced by calculating the quantum mechanical expectation
value ⟨d⟩. As a result, we will see that the properties of the electronic wavefunc-
tions have direct impact on the polarizability of the quantum system, as we have
it expected.
12.5
Application to Practical Problems
12.5.1 The Static Polarizability of a Dielectric Sphere in Vacuum
Let us for a moment continue with the classical description of polarizabilities
and assume the model task of a single dielectric sphere polarizing in an external
homogenous static electric ﬁeld. What is the polarizability of that sphere?
The problem is easily solved in terms of Eq. (12.16). We have:
Nβstat
3
= εstat −1
εstat + 2
Once we deal with a single sphere, the number of dipoles is 1, and the occupied
volume 4π
3 r3, while r is the radius of the sphere. Therefore,
N = 1
V =

4π
3 r3 ⇒Nβstat
3
= βstat
4πr3 = εstat −1
εstat + 2 ⇒βstat = 4πr3 εstat −1
εstat + 2
(12.20)
We thus come to the conclusion that the static polarizability of a dielectric
sphere is of the order of its volume.
The case of a metal sphere is also easy to handle. The static polarizability of
a single free electron obviously becomes imaginary and approaches inﬁnity by
absolute value, as easily seen from (12.5) when setting ω0 = 0. Then, according

316
12
From Atoms and Molecules to Continuous Media
to (12.16a), for the static “dielectric constant” of a metal we ﬁnd: εstat →i∞.
Consequently, for a metal sphere, βstat = 4πr3. Thus, even for a metal sphere, the
static polarizability turns out be of the order of the volume of the sphere.
As a rule of thumb, we therefore may state: The larger the volume of the
assumed microscopic object is, the larger its static polarizability will be.
Note that throughout our derivation, no restriction on the radius of the sphere was
introduced. In application to atomic dimensions, we obtain a classical estimate of
the static polarizability of an atom according to:
βstat, atom = 4πr3
atom = 3Vatom
This expression naturally coincides with the polarizability obtained in the early
Thomson’s model of an atom [2].
12.5.2 The Static Dielectric Constant of an Ensemble
of Permanent Dipole
In gases or liquids, permanent microscopic dipoles may cause an induced macro-
scopic polarization because of the formation of a preferred dipole orientation.
Let us assume a material that is built from permanent microscopic electric
dipoles. The permanent dipoles are allowed to rotate with some damping. This
is the typical situation in a gas or liquid built from polar molecules (e.g., water).
When no external electric ﬁeld is applied, the stochastic thermally activated move-
ment of the dipoles will not be able to create a macroscopic polarization. However,
in an external electric ﬁeld, the dipoles will more or less align with the ﬁeld,
creating a resulting induced macroscopic polarization.
The energy of a permanent microscopic dipole dperm in a local ﬁeld Eloc may
be given as:
U = −dpermEloc = −dpermEloc cos θ = U(θ)
where θ is the angle formed between the dipole moment and the ﬁeld. In the case
of thermal equilibrium and weak electric ﬁelds, the probability density w(θ) is:
w(θ) ∝e−U(θ)
kB T ≈1 −U(θ)
kBT = 1 + dpermEloc cos θ
kBT
This way we postulate here that thermal effects are dominating over the electric
dipole interaction. Our derivation is thus only valid for sufﬁciently large tempera-
tures such that the proposed linear approximation of the Boltzmann factor makes
sense.

12.5.3 Idea on Light Scattering
Elastic light scattering: Let us now return to Eq. (12.3) and consider a polariz-
ing microscopic object that is illuminated by light. Let us further assume that
the microscopic object is much smaller than the wavelength of the incident light.
Then, according to (12.3), the induced dipole moment oscillates with the angular
frequency of the light wave. In a classical picture, this will result in the emission
of light according to (2.16). The frequencies of the incident and emitted (scattered)
light are—in this case—identical.
This is a mechanism which results in elastic scattering of the incident light.
When combining (2.17) and (12.3), we get for the intensity IS of the light scattered
by a single microscopic scatterer:
IS ∝ω4β2(ω)Ie
(12.23)
where Ie marks the incident light intensity. The obtained ω4-dependence of the
intensity is characteristic for what is called Rayleigh scattering of light. The shorter
the wavelength, the more efﬁcient the scattering mechanism is. This is the reason
for the blue color of the sky.
Rayleigh scattering is not the only important elastic light scattering mechanism.
Water drops in a cloud are also scattering light, but these water drops are usu-
ally larger than the light wavelength. Therefore, (12.23) is not applicable to them,
and in fact the frequency dependence of the scattering efﬁciency becomes much
weaker. As a result, when being illuminated by sunlight, clouds usually appear as
white objects on the blue background of the sky (compare Fig. 7.3, on top).
The presence of scatterers in an optical path will impair the visibility of a
remote object, as visualized in Fig. 12.9. There are two basic effects responsible:
• In the presence of scattering, a part of the light traveling from the object to the
observer is lost as a result of scattering. The corresponding intensity decrease
is again described by some type of Beer’s law [compare (6.30)], I = I(z) =
I0e−γ z, where γ is called the scattering coefﬁcient, which in turn is directly
proportional to the concentration of scatterers and their individual scattering
efﬁciencies.
• Due to scattering, light portions from background illumination may be coupled
into the optical path and arrive at the observer, thus superimposing with the
light directly arriving from the object.

Application to Practical Problems

The top of the church tower is better reproduced in foggy conditions; the tower appears to be longer
in the picture on right
Both effects in combination are responsible for the general loss of information
evident on the right of Fig. 12.9 compared to the situation on left. But note that
the dark top of the church tower is better recognized in the fog compared to the
clear view. The reason is simple: on left, the dark church tower top is practically
invisible on the dark background of the mountain behind (the “Bärenkopf” (engl.
Bear head)). On right, the fog between the church and the mountain destroys the
information about that dark background, instead, the church tower now appears on
the white background of the fog. This background correction provided by the fog
overcompensates its disturbing effects.
Inelastic light scattering: Let us now assume that the regarded microscopic
object is simply a molecule. As it has been established experimentally, in addi-
tion to elastic light scattering, inelastic light scattering may be observed, resulting
in frequency changes of the light after having interacted with the molecule. In
particular, as the result of the spontaneous Raman effect, new lines (Raman lines)
may occur in the spectrum, which are shifted in frequency (so-called Raman shift)
for frequency portions that coincide with the frequency of vibrational and/or rota-
tional excitations. For simplicity, in the following text passages we will again refer
to vibrational excitations only.
How can we explain this effect?
In analogy to the adiabatic approximation, where the electronic wavefunctions
depend on coordinates of the electrons and, in a parametric sense, on those of
the nuclei, we now assume a classical picture where the electronic part of the
molecular microscopic polarizability (which deﬁnes the response to the quickly
oscillating ﬁelds relevant for an incident VIS or UV light beam) also depends on
the coordinates of the nuclei (which move much slower). When using the letter Q
for generalized nuclei coordinates, we may write for the electronic polarizability:
β = β(Q) = β0 + ∂β

(Q −Q0) + ...

From Atoms and Molecules to Continuous Media
Let us further assume that the nuclei perform oscillations around the equilib-
rium values of the generalized nuclei coordinates Q0 according to:
(Q −Q0) = a cos(ωvibrt); ωvibr << ω
Assuming an oscillating real incident ﬁeld according to E = E0 cos(ωt), from
(12.3) we have:

The ﬁrst term in (12.24) gives rise to absorption as well as Rayleigh scattering
processes. The second term generates lines in the spectrum that are red-shifted with
respect to ω. The third term generates lines in the spectrum that are blue-shifted
with respect to ω.
Here, the following terminology has been accepted:
• The incident light with angular frequency ω corresponds to what is called the
Excitation line.
• Stokes lines are red-shifted with respect to ω: {ωs} = ω −{ωvibr}
• Anti-Stokes lines are blue-shifted with respect to ω: {ωa} = ω + {ωvibr}
This situation is visualized in Fig. 12.10.
Anti-Stokes lines are usually substantially weaker in intensity than Stokes lines.
Obviously, the Stokes process results in the excitation of molecular vibrations,
and the necessary energy corresponds to a loss in frequency in the scattered photon
compared to the exciting photon. Anti-Stokes processes start from vibrationally
excited molecules, and a vibration quantum becomes added to the photon energy

of the incident light. In thermodynamic equilibrium, in a spectrum of a molecular
gas, Anti-Stokes lines are therefore much weaker. In analogy to (12.23), we have:
IStokes ∝ω4
s σR(ω, ωS)Ie
IAnti−Stokes ∝ω4
aσR(ω, ωa)e−νvibr
ϑ Ie
Here we have introduced the Raman cross section σR. As the polarizability, it
is frequency dependent and shows resonant behavior when one of the participat-
ing frequencies becomes resonant with an allowed (electronic) transition in the
molecule. Hence, the Raman spectrum may be resonantly enhanced by selecting a
suitable excitation frequency. In such a situation, we speak on a resonant Raman
effect.
We come to the conclusion, that vibrational (and rotational) spectra of
molecules may be investigated by different types of spectroscopy. In infrared
(absorption) spectroscopy, the light frequency must be tuned to the investigated
transition frequency. IR activity of the investigated transition m→n requires the
matrix element dnm to be different from zero (Fig. 12.11 on left).
In the Raman process, selection rules are different from those relevant for IR
absorption. In accordance with its two-photon character (Fig. 12.11 on right), the
condition for Raman activity of the transition m→n is:

l
dnldlm ̸= 0
(12.25)
Therefore, Raman spectroscopy is complementary to IR absorption spec-
troscopy, because it has other selection rules. For example, in a ﬁrst-order Raman
spectrum, the rotational quantum number may change to a value up to 2. Indeed,
in (12.25), when state m corresponds to the rotational quantum number J, in state
l we may achieve J + 1, so that J + 2 becomes accessible in state n. Correspond-
ingly, in rotational–vibrational Raman spectra, S-branches (J = + 2) may be
observed as well as O-branches (J = −2).

In a Raman transition, according to (12.25), we therefore have to require:
dnldlm ∝rnlrlm =

ψ∗
n (r) rψl(r)dV

ψ∗
l (r) rψm(r)dV ̸= 0
In a centrosymmetric system (compare Sect. 6.6.1), the state l must have a
parity that is different from the parities of both states m and n. Consequently, m
and n must have the same parity. But in this case, IR activity is forbidden. On
the other hand, IR activity requires different parities of n and m, which makes the
transition Raman-inactive. We come to the conclusion that in a centrosymmetric
system (molecule), when assuming electric dipole interaction, no transition may
be both IR- and Raman-active. This is the essence of the so-called rule of mutual
exclusion.
While IR-active transitions are characterized by an oscillating induced dipole
moment (such as in the case of the asymmetric stretching vibration of CO2),
Raman-active vibrations are accompanied—as a rule of thumb—by a modulation
of the volume occupied by the molecule, such as in the case of the symmet-
ric stretching vibration of CO2. This gives rise to a modulation of the electronic
polarizability, i.e. ∂β
∂Q

0 ̸= 0 and therefore, according to (12.24), to Raman activity.

Advanced Material: A Quantum Mechanical Expression

Let us ﬁnally generalize (12.6) to the semiclassical case. According to (12.6), the
following classical expression for the microscopic polarizability was obtained:


j=1
f j

0 j −ω2 −2iωγ j
In the course of our treatment of the response of a two-level system with elec-
tromagnetic radiation according to Chap. 6, we found that the efﬁciency of that
interaction is determined by at least three factors:
• The square of the absolute value of the matrix element of the perturbation (in
our case the electric dipole) operator (which is proportional to the oscillator
strength fnl = 2m
ℏωnl|xnl|2).
• The relation between the frequency of the incident electromagnetic wave and
the energy spacing between the energy levels of the unperturbed material system
which deﬁne the resonance frequencies (resonance condition).
• When regarding the average polarizability of an assembly of many two-level
systems, then we also have to consider the population difference of the energy
levels involved into the quantum transition.

12.6

This may be used to provide a guess on the structure of the semiclassic expression
for the polarizability. For this purpose, in Eq. (12.6), we will make the following
substitutions:
ωoj →ωnl = En −El

that En ≥El is fulﬁlled. The values W(l) are the statistical probabilities that the l-th
energy level is populated.
Then, the semiclassical expression for the polarizability, dielectric function, or
optical constants is provided by setting:

(12.26)
This expression already coincides with the correct result, although we can by
no means assert that we have derived it. It was a guess, but concerning an accurate
derivation, let us start with two remarks.
Firstly, we must recognize that so far we have not introduced any relaxation
mechanism into our quantum mechanical picture. On the other hand, as it directly
follows from the Fourier analysis (compare Sect. 2.3.3), the Lorentzian lineshapes
in (12.26) correspond to an exponential damping of the polarization. In a quantum
mechanical language, this may be derived in the frames of the density matrix con-
cept, which is however beyond the material presented in this course. A derivation
of (12.26) in the framework of the density matrix is provided in [4].
Secondly, the derivation of expression (12.26) without the imaginary terms
responsible for relaxation may be performed in the usual language of wavefunc-
tions, when calculating the quantum mechanical expectation value of the dipole
moment⟨d⟩of a quantum system perturbed by an oscillating ﬁeld according to
(6.20a). This is, for example, presented in the highly recommended rather classical
textbook on quantum mechanics [5].
We are lazy enough not to repeat that whole derivation in this book. Let us
however make use of a shortcut in order to demonstrate how Eq. (12.26) may be
derived (however without the relaxation terms γ ). For that purpose, we return to
the stuff from Sect. 6.3.2 and, in particular, to a wavefunction of the perturbed
quantum system as deﬁned by (6.12) and (6.21).
The idea is to calculate the expectation value of the dipole moment and to set
it equal to (12.3) in order to ﬁnd an expression for the polarizability. Hence, we

324
12
From Atoms and Molecules to Continuous Media
set:
⟨d⟩=

V
∗ˆddV = ε0βE
(12.27)
There is a small inconsistency in that shortcut. Namely, in (12.3), the assumed
ﬁeld is strongly monochromatic as described by the cosine function. In (6.21),
however, we have in fact assumed a cosine ﬁeld multiplied with a step function
that guarantees that the light is switched on exactly at t = 0. Then, (6.21) has
been assumed to be an approximate solution valid for a certain time span after
the oscillating ﬁeld has been switched on such that the system still “remembers”
its initial conditions. Therefore, when honestly substituting (6.12) and (6.21) into
(12.27), we will obtain that (12.27) is not fulﬁlled.
We will escape from that inconsistency in the following manner:
• In (12.3) the ﬁeld is assumed to be monochromatic according to a cosine-law
that theoretically extends from “t = −∞” until now. In any real system,
because of relaxation mechanisms, the information on the initial conditions of
the quantum system would surely have been lost during this time span.
• In (6.21) the initial conditions of the quantum system (here at t = 0) have
explicitly been taken into account. Indeed, we assumed a wavefunction of a
superposition state in terms of (6.12) according to:
(r, t) =

n
an(t)n(r, t)
While requiring t = 0 :⇒|al| = 1; an̸=1 = 0. The solution (6.21):
am(t) ≈al
dmlE0
ℏ
ei(ωml−ω)t −1
ωml −ω
+ ei(ωml+ω)t −1
ωml + ω

; m ̸= l
is clearly consistent with those initial conditions. It is therefore not astonishing
that (12.27), (6.12), and (6.21) cannot be fulﬁlled together.
• Our physical assumption is now that although (6.21) is dominated by the initial
conditions of the quantum system, it also contains—as a seed—the information
about the response of the system to a well-established stationary monochromatic
perturbation. We expect that this seed will result in a term in ⟨d⟩=

V
∗ˆddV
that is proportional to E = E0e−iωt. The idea is thus to consider only that term
in (12.27) in order to calculate the polarizability. Our starting point is therefore:
ε0βE0e−iωt =



On the other hand, from (6.12) it follows:

Obviously, when calculating the induced dipole moment ⟨d⟩, we have to con-

This expression for the polarizability was derived assuming that al = 1, i.e.,
the system is in state l. In reality, the quantum system may be found in different
states. We therefore perform a rather classical averaging procedure, assigning to
each possible state l a population probability W(l). Clearly,

This is of course a real expression for the polarizability. It differs from expres-
sions like (12.6) and (12.26) by the term 2iωγnl in the denominator. In order to
make our expression consistent with the reasonable assumption on an exponential
damping of the freely oscillating dipole, the only thing we can do is to phe-
nomenologically add that term and thus to complete the Lorentzian-like frequency
dependence of the polarizability as it has already been obtained in Sect. 2.3.2,
Eq. (2.14). We thus come to the ﬁnal expression:

This expression exactly coincides with our guess (12.26).
Once more, a more stringent derivation of (12.26) is possible in terms of the
density matrix approach.
So far we have regarded a single dipole exposed to an external ﬁeld according
to (12.27). If the dipole is part of a macroscopic system, the ﬁeld in (12.27) has
to be interpreted as the corresponding local ﬁeld.

wavelength you will observe that Stokes line, when the excitation wavelength is

Continuous media contain a thermodynamically relevant number of atoms. In a
continuum description, the summarized impact of the individual optical responses
of that tremendous number of atoms may be replaced by continuous and smooth
effective optical functions, such as the well-known refractive index. The optical effects
described in terms of geometrical optics are based on the introduction of suchlike
functions and include well-known phenomena such as the image inversion of an
object created by a water drop.

Abstract
Dielectric function and optical constants of continuous media are introduced.
Dispersion is obtained as a natural conclusion from memory effects. Applica-
tions include the discussion of orientation polarization, the treatment of normal
incidence interface reﬂections, as well as a simple treatment of the optical
properties of material mixtures.
13.1
Starting Point
The light–matter interaction may be theoretically treated at different levels of
difﬁculty.
A purely classical description makes use of Maxwell’s equations for the descrip-
tion of the electrical and magnetic ﬁelds and classical models (e.g., Newton’s
equations of motion) for the dynamics of the charge carriers present in any ter-
restrial matter (Chap. 2). On the contrary, a quantum mechanical treatment is
possible within the framework of the quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
(so-called second quantization—Sect. 5.6.3) and a quantum theoretical treatment
of matter (Chaps. 8–11). This description is necessary, when spontaneous opti-
cal effects have to be described (spontaneous emission according to Sect. 7.6.2,
spontaneous Raman scattering, or spontaneous paramagnetic interactions in non-
linear optics) on a theoretically strong level. In applied spectroscopy, the accurate
quantum mechanical description is often replaced by the so-called semiclassi-
cal treatment. Here, the properties of matter are described in terms of quantum
mechanical models, while the ﬁelds are treated within the framework of Maxwell’s
theory (compare Sect. 6.3.2). Maxwell’s equations are therefore essential in both
classical and semiclassical approaches, and for that reason we start our discussion

from these equations, which are given below:
divB = 0
divD = 0
curlE = −∂B
∂t
curlH = ∂D
∂t
B = μ0(H + M)
D = ε0E + P
(13.1)
Here, E and H represent the vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, while D
and B stand for the electric displacement and the magnetic induction, respectively.
P is the polarization, and M the magnetization of the medium. In (13.1), neither the
free charge carrier density nor their current density is explicitly present. Keeping
in mind, that optics deal with rapidly oscillating electric and magnetic ﬁelds, due
to the short periods, “free” charges will oscillate around their equilibrium position
quite similar to bound charges (compare the explanations in Sect. 12.4). So in our
description as used here, the displacement vector contains information on both free
and bound charges. The very few cases, where the static response of matter with
free electrons becomes important in the frames of this course, cannot be treated
within (13.1) and will need separate discussion.
13.2
Physical Idea
According to the general philosophy in this book, we concentrate on electric
dipole interactions again. In the following, we will therefore assume that the media
are generally non-magnetic (M is a zero-vector) and isotropic. When neglecting
magnetization effects, from (13.1) one obtains straightforwardly:
curlcurlE = graddivE −E = −μ0
∂2D
∂t2
(13.2)
This is an equation with two unknown vectors. In order to proceed further, at
this point, we need to establish a second equation, namely a relationship between
the vectors E and D, which will be done in the next subchapter.
As some preparation, let us assume now that a rapidly changing electric ﬁeld
with a completely arbitrary time dependence interacts with matter. One would
naturally expect that the electric ﬁeld tends to displace, in general, both negative
and positive charges, thus creating a macroscopic dipole moment in the material
system. As in the previous chapter, the polarization P is per deﬁnition the dipole
moment per unit volume, and it will be, of course, time-dependent in a manner
that is determined by the time dependence of E. For the moment, we neglect the
spatial dependence of E and P, because it is not essential for the further derivation.
Generally, the polarization is thus a possibly very involved functional F of the ﬁeld
E:

Of course, the polarization of the medium appears as the result of the action
of the assumed electric ﬁeld (here and in the following, we do not regard ferro-
electrics!). Due to the causality principle, the polarization at a given time t can
depend on the ﬁeld at the same moment as well as at previous moments t’, but not
on the ﬁeld behavior in the future. This is the meaning of the condition: t’≤t. In
order to comply with the requirement (13.3), we therefore postulate the following
general relationship for the polarization as a functional of the electric ﬁeld:
P(t) = ε0
t
−∞
κ

t, t′
E

t′
dt′
(13.4)
Equation (13.4) postulates that the polarization at any time t may principally
depend on the ﬁrst power of the ﬁeld at the current and all previous moments, as
it follows from the integration interval that is chosen in correspondence with the
mentioned causality principle. The speciﬁc way, in which the system “remembers”
the ﬁeld strength at previous moments, is hidden in the response function κ(t, t′),
which must be speciﬁc for any material. Equation (13.4) is in fact the ﬁrst (linear)
term of an expansion of (13.3) into a Taylor power series of E. As we keep only
the ﬁrst (linear) term of the series, all optical effects that arise from (13.4) form
the ﬁeld of linear optics. Equation (13.4) thus represents a rather general writing
of the material equation in linear optics. Note that κ is a real function, because the
validity of (13.4) shall not depend on whether we use a real or complex (compare
remark in Sect. 2.1) description of the oscillating ﬁelds and polarizations.
In general, when the materials are anisotropic, κ(t, t’) is a tensor. As we restrict
our attention here to optically isotropic materials, P will always be parallel to E,
so that κ(t,t′) becomes a scalar function.
A further facilitation is possible. Due to the homogeneity of time, κ(t,t′) will
in fact not depend on both individual times t and t’ separately, but only on their
difference ξ ≡t −t′. Substituting t′ by ξ, we obtain:

13.3.1 The Linear Dielectric Susceptibility
Let us now come to the utmost important model case of harmonic time depen-
dence. Let us assume that the electric ﬁeld performs rapid oscillations according
to E(t) = E0e−iωt. Correspondingly, we may write:E(t −ξ) = E0e−iωteiωξ. Note

334

that we assume a completely monochromatic ﬁeld. From (13.5), it is then obtained:
P(t) = ε0
⎡
⎣
∞

0
κ(ξ)eiωξdξ
⎤
⎦E0e−iωt
(13.6)
We deﬁne the linear dielectric susceptibility χ according to:
χ =
∞

0
κ(ξ)eiωξdξ = χ(ω)
(13.7)
The thus deﬁned susceptibility must be complex (it has both real and imaginary
parts), and it depends on the frequency of the ﬁeld even after having performed
the integration in (13.7). Both circumstances arise mathematically from (13.5) and
physically from the ﬁnite inertness of any material system. Clearly, the charge car-
riers cannot instantaneously react on rapidly changing ﬁelds, so that their positions
at a given time t depend on the history of the system, which is in fact the reason
for the complicated behavior of the polarization with time. The information on the
speciﬁc material properties is now carried by χ(ω).
Remark Note that the response function κ(ξ) as ﬁxed in (13.5)–(13.7) has a clear
and very general physical meaning. Indeed, let us write (13.5) in a more general
symbolic manner:
output(t) =
∞

0
κ(ξ) input(t −ξ)dξ
Here, the electric ﬁeld has been associated with some time-dependent input to the
system under consideration, while the resulting time-dependent polarization forms
the output. In the special case that the input to the system is provided by a δ-kick:
input(t)∝δ(t) (Fig. 13.1 on left), we obtain the output for t > 0 according to:
output(t) =
 ∞
0
κ(ξ) input(t −ξ)dξ ∝
 ∞
0
κ(ξ) δ(t −ξ)dξ = κ(t)
⇒output(t) ∝κ(t)
Hence, the response function reproduces the speciﬁc output of the system to a
δ-kick. For a general type of input in (13.5), we therefore have to expect that the
system output is deﬁned by some convolution of the actual input and the systems
reaction to a δ-kick (Fig. 13.1 on right). Hence, the situations shown in Fig. 13.1 will
produce different, but not independent sounds: Knowledge of the sound obtained in
the situation on left allows predicting what will happen on right.

We are now able to formulate the relationship between E and D for
monochromatic electric ﬁelds. Indeed, from (13.6) and (13.7) it follows that
P = ε0χE
(13.8)
In combination with the deﬁnition of D we have:
D = ε0E + P = ε0[1 + χ(ω)]E ≡ε0ε(ω)E
(13.9)
where we deﬁned the dielectric function ε(ω)
ε(ω) ≡1 + χ(ω)
Equation (13.9) is completely analogous to what is known from the electrostat-
ics of dielectrics [compare (12.10)], with the only difference that ε is now complex
and frequency dependent. That frequency dependence is called dispersion. So that
we come to the conclusion that in optics we have a similar relationship between
ﬁeld and displacement vectors as in electrostatics, with the difference that in optics
the dielectric constant has to be replaced by the dielectric function.
Remark In the case that the incident ﬁeld is not monochromatic, in (13.8) and (13.9),
all of the vectors must be replaced by the amplitudes of their corresponding Fourier
components. We have:
Dω = ε0ε(ω)Eω
(13.9a)
And so on. Here symbols like Dω denote Fourier components of the corresponding
vectors.

13.3.2 Linear Optical Constants
We may now turn back to (13.2). Keeping in mind that our discussion is restricted
to harmonic oscillations of the ﬁelds only, the second derivative with respect to
time in (13.2) may be replaced by multiplying with −ω2. Replacing moreover D
with (13.9), we obtain:
curlcurlE −ω2ε(ω)
c2
E = 0
(13.10)
Here we used the identity: ε0μ0 = c−2.
where c is the velocity of light in vacuum. For polychromatic ﬁelds, the single
Fourier components have to be treated separately in an analogous manner.
We now remember the vector identity: curlcurlE ≡graddiv E −E.
In the case that ε ̸=0, from divD = 0 it follows that divE = 0. Thus we ﬁnally
have:
E + ω2ε(ω)
c2
E = 0
(13.11)
where the ﬁeld vector has been replaced by a scalar ﬁeld due to the assumed
isotropy. A completely identical equation may be obtained for the magnetic ﬁeld.
Let us remark at this point that due to the assumed optical isotropy, we will
often turn from the vectorial to the scalar mathematical description. Throughout
this text, in these cases we will simply refrain from bold symbols without further
notice.
Assuming that the dielectric function does not depend on the coordinates
themselves (homogeneous media), we are looking for a solution in the form:
E(r, t) = E0e−i(ωt−kr)
(13.12)
with k being the wavevector. Nontrivial solutions of (13.11) exist when
k = ±ω
c

ε(ω)
(13.13)
is fulﬁlled. Assuming for simplicity, that k is parallel to the z-axis of a Carte-
sian coordinate system, (13.12) describes a plane wave traveling along the z-axis.
It depends on the sign in (13.13) whether the wave is running into the positive
or negative direction. We choose a wave running into the positive direction and
obtain:
E = E0e−i(ωt−ω
c
√ε(ω)z)
(13.14)

13.3
Theoretical Material
337
where E0 is the ﬁeld amplitude at z = 0. Let us look on (13.14) in some more
detail.
As we obtained in Sect. 13.3.1, the dielectric function may be complex; hence,
it may have an imaginary part. Of course, the square root will also be a complex
function. We therefore have:

ε(ω) = Re

ε(ω) + iIm

ε(ω)
Equation (13.14) therefore describes a damped wave according to:
E = E0e−ω
c Im√ε(ω)ze−i(ωt−ω
c Re√ε(ω)z)
(13.15)
with a z-dependent amplitude (see Fig. 13.2)
Eampl = E0e−ω
c Im√ε(ω)z
(13.16)
and a real phase:phase = ω t −ω
c Re√ε(ω)z
Let us calculate the velocity dz/dt of any point at the surface of constant phase
(which is a plane in our case). Regarding the phase as constant and differentiating
the last equation with respect to time, we obtain the phase velocity of the wave
according to:
dz
dt ≡vph =
c
Re√ε(ω) ≡
c
n(ω)
(13.17)
Here we introduced the refractive index n(ω) as the real part of the square root
of the complex dielectric function. Naturally, the refractive index appears to be
frequency dependent (so-called dispersion of the refractive index). In a medium
with refractive index n, the phase velocity of a monochromatic electromagnetic
wave changes with respect to vacuum according to (13.17).

Linear Optical Constants I
As a generalization to (13.17), one often deﬁnes the complex index of refraction
as:
ˆn(ω) = n(ω) + i K(ω) ≡

ε(ω)
(13.18)
Its real part is identical with the ordinary refractive index as deﬁned in (13.17),
while its imaginary part (the so-called extinction coefﬁcient) K is responsible for
the damping of a wave. Indeed, returning to (13.16), we obtain for the amplitude
of the wave: Eampl = E0e−ω
c K z.
Because the intensity I of the wave is proportional to the square of the ﬁeld
amplitude modulus [compare (2.6)], the intensity damps inside the medium as:
I = I(z = 0)e−2 ω
c K z ≡I(z = 0)e−αz
(13.19)
This exponential decay of light intensity for a wave traveling in a lossy medium
is well known as Beer’s law of absorption [compare (6.30)] with a frequency-
dependent absorption coefﬁcient α deﬁned as:
α(ω) = 2ω
c K(ω)
(13.20)
In terms of the identities: ν ≡1
λ =
ω
2πc we come to a more familiar expression:
α(ν) = 4πνK(ν)
(13.20a)
Although the refractive index n and the extinction coefﬁcient K are dimen-
sionless, the absorption coefﬁcient is given in reciprocal length units, usually in
reciprocal centimeters. The reciprocal value of the absorption coefﬁcient is some-
times called penetration depth. The pair of n and K forms the pair of linear optical
constants of a material.
Remark Throughout this derivation, we supposed the time dependence of the ﬁelds
according to e−iωt. As a consequence, we deﬁned the complex index of refraction
as n + iK. The same kind of theory may be built postulating a time dependence
of the ﬁelds as e+iωt. However, in this case the index of refraction will be n −iK.
Both approaches are equally correct and can be found in the literature, however, they
shouldn’t be confused with each other.
13.4
Consistency Considerations
In this chapter, so far we have derived or rederived several relations that have
earlier been obtained in the frames of a somewhat different context. Let us recall
those “convergencies” with our previous considerations:

13.5
Application to Practical Problems
339
• The material Eq. (13.9) for dielectric materials: It is a generalization of the
electrostatic version (12.10) provided that we accept that the dielectric func-
tion is frequency-dependent and complex. In order to guarantee convergence
of (13.9) to (12.10) when the frequency approaches zero, we must require that
the imaginary part of the dielectric function of a dielectric material approaches
zero when the frequency approaches zero.
• In deriving (13.19), in fact we rederived Beers law (6.30) as a side result.
• In Sect. 3.2.2, for a wave package propagating without damping, we established
relation (3.9) for the phase velocity according to νph = ω0
k0 . For a monochro-
matic electromagnetic wave propagating without damping, wave, ω = ω0, while
k = ω
c n. Hence, we ﬁnd
νph = ω0
k0
= ω
k = c
n
such that our new expression for the phase velocity according to (13.17) is
consistent with the previously derived expression (3.9).
Before now turning to more practical problems, let us complete this section
with another rather general remark. No matter whether the piece of matter under
investigation is microscopic or macroscopic, whatever we assume to be an optical
signal arriving at a detector must have traveled from its origin to the detecting unit.
From the theoretical stuff described so far, we therefore ﬁnd that the calculation
of any optical signal that is to be compared with a measured signal will contain at
least two different parts:
• First of all, one has to ﬁnd a suitable model for the dielectric function (or other
relevant material functions that describe the dynamics of the piece of matter to
be investigated) that contain the speciﬁc information about the material.
• Secondly, having this model in hand, one has to solve a wave equation like
(13.2) to account for the wave propagation in the particular geometry valid
for the (given or assumed) experiment. Having solved the wave equation with
realistic boundary conditions, we obtain electric and/or magnetic ﬁelds that may
be converted for example into light intensities, which in turn may be compared
with experimental data.
13.5
Application to Practical Problems
13.5.1 Energy Dissipation
A high extinction coefﬁcient (strong damping) is not necessarily connected with
a large imaginary part of the dielectric function. For example, a real but negative
dielectric function will result in a purely imaginary refractive index, i.e. a possibly

340
13
Linear Optical Constants I
high extinction coefﬁcient. This seemingly exotic situation is in fact a characteristic
model assumption in metal optics. Here the penetrating wave is indeed damped,
but the light is rather reﬂected than absorbed. Therefore, the generally accepted
terminus “absorption coefﬁcient” may be misleading in special cases. In fact, for
light absorption (energy dissipation) it is essential that Imε ̸=0.
Let us illustrate this fact. Indeed, the volume density of the power dissipated
from the electromagnetic ﬁeld can be written as [1]:
∂Wdiss
V ∂t
= jE
This notation corresponds to real ﬁelds E and current densities j. It is a direct
conclusion from the well-known relation that expresses the power as the product
of electric current and applied voltage. In order to express the real functions by
their complex counterparts, we simply make use of (2.5) and obtain:
∂Wdiss
V ∂t
= 4RejReE
Making further use of:
∂P
∂t = 1
V

l
ql ˙rl = j
(13.21)
and considering a harmonic time dependence of the oscillating electric ﬁeld in the
wave according to the convention deﬁned in terms of (2.1), we can write:
j = −iε0ω(ε −1)E
Therefore we have:
Rej = ε0ω[(Reε −1)ImE + ImεReE]
⇒RejReE = ε0ω

(Reε −1)ImEReE + Imε(ReE)2
Let us ﬁnally use expression (13.15) for the electric ﬁeld. Once the real part
of the electric ﬁeld oscillates according to a cosine function, and the imaginary
according to a sine function, the time average over a period results in:
∂Wdiss
V ∂t

= 2ε0ωImε|E0|2e−αz
(13.22)
Thus, light absorption (or energy dissipation) is observed when Imε ̸=0 is
fulﬁlled.

13.5.2 Interface Reﬂection
In practice, one often has to perform calculations of different spectra with the
purpose to compare them with experimentally measured ones. One of the sim-
plest tasks is the calculation of an absorption spectrum according to the deﬁnition
(7.26). According to our considerations from Sect. 13.4, the calculation of any
absorption spectrum will however contain at least two different parts: First of all,
the optical constants of the material must be calculated. Secondly, one has to solve
the wave Eq. (13.11) to account for the particular geometry valid for the (given
or assumed) experiment. Having solved the wave equation with realistic boundary
conditions, we obtain electric and/or magnetic ﬁelds that may be converted into
light intensities, which in turn may be compared with experimental data. Changing
the systems geometry will change the intensities obtained at the output, although
the material might be the same. For example, in Sect. 13.3 we have solved the
wave equation, assuming that the dielectric function is the same at any point. In
other words, we assumed a completely homogeneous medium, particularly with-
out any interfaces. That resulted in Beer’s law (13.19), but the latter must not be
applied in other geometries.
In summary, both material and geometry speciﬁcs must be considered in any
spectra calculation. The situation is completely analogous to the approach used in
electricity: In order to calculate the electric resistance of a resistor, you need to
know a material parameter (the speciﬁc resistance or conductivity), as well as the
geometry (in simplest cases, length and cross-section area of the resistor).
While the material information is contained in quantities like the dielectric
function of the optical constants, the geometry of an object is connected to its
surface and maybe internal interfaces. Any light incident to an object will ﬁrst
interact with its surface. Therefore, the speciﬁc phenomena occurring on surfaces
are utmost important for a correct quantitative interpretation of any real optical
spectrum. This short section is to make you familiar with the simplest relations
that describe the reﬂection of electromagnetic radiation at plane interfaces.
Transmission and reﬂection of light at surfaces and interfaces of the objects
surrounding us are utmost important for creating images of our environment by
viewing—compare Fig. 13.3. It is therefore essential to extend our theoretical
approach to quantifying interface reﬂections—at least in simplest geometries.
Let us restrict on the case of two homogeneous, isotropic and non-absorbing
media with real refractive indices n1 and n2, separated by a plane and smooth
interface. Assume that a plane light wave is incident from medium 1 (electric ﬁeld
strength Ee), while the interaction with the interface results in the formation of
a reﬂected plane wave (electric ﬁeld strength Er) traveling back into medium 1,
and a transmitted plane wave (electric ﬁeld strength Et) propagating into medium
2. Then, at normal incidence, the electric ﬁeld strength will be parallel to the
interface. According to Table 12.2, in this case, Maxwell’s boundary conditions at
the interface between media 1 and 2 result in: Ee + Er

On the other hand, energy conservation gives for the intensities I:
Ie = It + Ir
The intensity (energy per time and area) may be expressed as the product of
the energy volume density and the propagation velocity. In a dense nonabsorbing
medium, (2.6) is modiﬁed therefore. The energy volume density is proportional to
εε0E2 ∝n2E2, while the propagation velocity is proportional to c
n . One of the n
cancels out when forming the product, and instead of (2.6), we now have:

Thus, from (13.23a) it follows that the larger the refractive index contrast is,
the larger the normal incidence reﬂectance will be. In the case of absorbing media,
the refractive indices have to be replaced by their complex counterparts according
to (13.18). Then, the real reﬂectance R is given by:
R =

(13.24)
It should be mentioned that as a result of the dispersion of the optical constants,
the reﬂectance turns out to be frequency dependent as well.
Remark Formally, Eqs. (13.23)–(13.23a) describe a beam-splitting process, where
an incident light beam (e) is split into a transmitted (t) and a reﬂected (r) light beam.
Thereby, Eq. (13.23a) describes a classical splitting by light intensity. In a quantum
mechanical picture that means, that a part of the incident photons is directed into the
reﬂected beam, and the rest into the transmitted.
But what will happen if there is only one single photon incident to the interface?
Obviously, our classical result is no more of use here, because it is impossible that a
part of the photon is reﬂected, and the other part transmitted. Obviously, we have to
turn to the quantum mechanical ﬁeld description in such a case.
In fact there exists a quantum mechanical approach to beam splitting and optical
mixing [2], which we may adapt to our situation. However, once we have only dealt
with the description of the electric ﬁeld in vacuum so far, we start with a simpliﬁed
situation. Thus, (5.52) together with (5.61) gives the operator of the electric ﬁeld in
vacuum according to (ep indicates a unit vector describing the polarization state):
ˆE =

ℏω
2ε0V

epe−i(ωt−kr) ˆa + e∗
pe+i(ωt−kr) ˆa+
Then, if we would have vacuum on both sides of the beam-splitting interface,
from.
Ee + Er = Et ⇒Ee = Et −Er we could write down the operator relation
(assuming identical polarization in all beams) [2]:
ˆa+
e = t ˆa+
t −r ˆa+
r
Here we have introduced the electric ﬁeld transmission and reﬂection coefﬁcients
t and r according to:
t = Et

The photon creation operators ˆa+
e , ˆa+
t , ˆa+
r are responsible for photon creation in
the incident, transmitted, or reﬂected beams, respectively.

Linear Optical Constants I
Let us now assume that we have one single photon incident in path (e) and no
photons in the paths (r) and (t). Such a state can be written as:
|1⟩e|0⟩r|0⟩t = ˆa+
e |0⟩e|0⟩r|0⟩t
Let us now write this state as a superposition of the two states |0⟩e|1⟩r|0⟩t(one
photon reﬂected, no photon in any of the other paths) and |0⟩e|0⟩r|1⟩t (one photon
transmitted, no photon in any of the other paths). We write:
|1⟩e|0⟩r|0⟩t = ˆa+
e |0⟩e|0⟩r|0⟩t =

W(r)=|r|2




W(t)=|t|2
This relation makes it clear, that the state with the one photon incident represents
a biased superposition of the states with one photon transmitted and one photon
reﬂected. Therefore, in case of transmission or reﬂection measurements, we will
never observe situations where parts of the photon are found in transmission or reﬂec-
tion, instead, we will observe the whole photon either reﬂected with the probability
W(r) = |r|2 ≡R, or the photon is transmitted with the probability W(t) = |t|2 ≡T .
Also, we have T + R = 1. This is a quite reasonable result.
Within a dielectric medium, this expression must be modiﬁed. First of all, from
the corresponding expression for the energy density, we have to substitute:
ε0 →εε0 = n2ε0
With n—refractive index. We must further consider that in a medium with refrac-
tive index n, the wavelength is modiﬁed

. Therefore, in a medium with
refractive index n, it is the reference volume V/n3 that contains the same number of
modes as the volume V in vacuum. We substitute:

So far we have discussed normal incidence reﬂectance phenomena at plane
smooth interfaces only. For a detailed discussion of oblique incidence phenomena,
I would like to refer you, dear reader, to reference [3, pp. 103–109].
In many practical situations, diffuse reﬂection phenomena at rough surfaces or
in turbid media are essential for understanding the optical appearance of an object.
We will not go into details here, but ﬁnish this section with a rather qualitative dis-
cussion of the spectrally selective absorbers as introduced in Sect. 7.5.2. Spectrally
selective absorbers usually show a frequency-dependent reﬂectance. This is espe-
cially simple to be understood if the absorber is thick enough that it does not
transmit light. Then, (specular + diffuse) reﬂectance and absorptance must sum
up to 1, and therefore, if the absorptance is frequency-dependent, the reﬂectance
must also. Therefore, when being illuminated by white light, spectrally selective
absorbers appear colored.
On the other hand, when the reﬂectance is nearly constant over the visible
spectral range, the corresponding object will appear in gray (or white, if R = 1)
when being illuminated with white light. Moreover, when being illuminated by
colored light, the reﬂected light will have the same color. Therefore, gray bodies
appear in the color of the light incident to them. Figure 13.4 shows corresponding
examples of diffuse light reﬂection at a rock formation.
Qualitatively the same result will be obtained from (13.24). Indeed, when the
extinction coefﬁcient is frequency dependent, the reﬂectance according to (13.24)
will be frequency dependent as well. As we will see later in Chap. 15, the situation
is even more complex: a frequency-dependent absorption must be accompanied by
a well-deﬁned frequency-dependent refraction. Therefore, the reﬂectance accord-
ing to (13.24) will show a very speciﬁc behavior in the vicinity of absorption
features, such that reﬂection spectroscopy appears to be an important analytical
tool. As an example, in Sect. 14.4 the reﬂectance in the vicinity of absorption
lines will be illustrated.

13.6.1 Orientation Polarization
Let us assume a material that is built from permanent microscopic electric dipoles
(compare Sect. 12.5). The dipoles are allowed to rotate with some damping. This
is the typical situation in a liquid built from polar molecules (e.g., water). When
no external electric ﬁeld is applied, the stochastic thermally activated movement
of the dipoles shall not be able to create a macroscopic polarization (compare

13.6
Advanced Material
347
Sect. 12.5.2). However, in an external electric ﬁeld, the dipoles will more or less
align with the ﬁeld, creating a resulting macroscopic polarization. We shall ﬁnd the
frequency dependence of the dielectric function (and consequently of the optical
constants) of such a material.
We will solve this task by a direct application of (13.7). Because we still do not
know the response function κ(ξ), we start from the following thought experiment:
Let us assume that a static electric ﬁeld has been applied to the system for
a sufﬁciently long time, so that a static polarization of the liquid has been well
established. Let us further assume that the ﬁeld is switched off at the moment t =
0. We model this situation by means of the electric ﬁeld:
E(t) = E0[1 −θ(t)]
where θ(t) is a step function that has the value one for t ≥0 and zero elsewhere.
It makes no sense to assume that the polarization will vanish instantaneously with
a vanishing external ﬁeld. On the contrary, in our model we shall assume that due
to the thermal movement of the particles, the macroscopic polarization decreases
smoothly and asymptotically approaches the value of zero. This situation may be
approximated by an exponentially descending behavior with a time constant τ
according to:
P(t) = P0e−t
τ ; t > 0
Furthermore, from (13.5) we have:
P(t) = P0e−t
τ = ε0
∞

0
κ(ξ)E0[1 −θ(t −ξ)]dξ
The only action of the step function is to reduce the integration interval:
P0e−t
τ = −ε0E0

κ(ξ)dξ
We differentiate with respect to time and make use of the identity:
f (x) = d

That leads us to the following expression for the response function κ(t):

Having found the response function, the further treatment is straightforward [4].

Or

(13.26)
where χstat is the static (ω = 0) value of the susceptibility [the last term in (12.22)].
The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function may be written as follows:
Reε = 1 +
χstat
1 + ω2τ 2 ; Imε =
χstatωτ
1 + ω2τ 2
(13.27)
The thus obtained dielectric function represents a simpliﬁed version of Debye’s
equations valid for the dielectric function in polar viscous media. In Fig. 13.5, the
spectral shapes of real and imaginary parts of this particular dielectric function
are presented. Figure 13.6 shows the corresponding optical constants. In these
Figures, a static susceptibility of χstat = 80 has been assumed, similar to what is
observed in ordinary water. Obviously, the presence of permanent dipoles in the
medium results in a large static dielectric constant, while for higher frequencies,
the real part of the dielectric function may be essentially lower. Thus, in the visible
spectral range, water has a dielectric function with a real part of approximately
1.77 and a refractive index of 1.33. This behavior is in qualitative consistency with
the predictions from Debye’s equations, where the refractive index is expected to
steadily decrease with increasing frequency.
There is another interesting fact that becomes obvious from Fig. 13.5. The
imaginary part of the dielectric function has its maximum value exactly at the
angular frequency ω = τ −1. Consequently, the result of a spectral measurement

(determining the peak position of Imε) reveals information about the dynamic
behavior of the system (the decay time of polarization). This is one example for
the validity of a more general fundamental principle, that in optics the spectral
(χ(ω)) and time domain (κ(t)) representations embody the same information and
may be transferred into each other. Indeed, (13.7) is in fact a Fourier transformation
of the response function, performed however only over a semi-inﬁnite interval for
reasons of causality. One may formally multiply the response function with a step
function:
˜κ(ξ) = κ(ξ)θ(ξ)
(13.28)
The thus obtained modiﬁed response function may be integrated over the full
time interval, so that we have:
χ(ω) =
∞

−∞
˜κ(ξ)eiωξdξ
(13.29)
Remark Note that (13.27) is nevertheless only a theoretical model of a dielectric
function, because the exponential decay of the free polarization resulting in the time
dependence of the response function (13.25) was simply postulated. We established
a reasonable agreement with experimental ﬁndings in polar materials at lower fre-
quencies, but at higher frequencies, peculiarities will occur. Thus, when combining
the expression for energy dissipation (13.22) with the dielectric function (13.27), we
observe that the energy dissipation approaches a constant positive value when the
frequency approaches inﬁnity [5]. This is really peculiar, because at highest frequen-
cies, one should expect that all degrees of freedom within the material system are too
inert to comply with the rapid oscillations of the electric ﬁeld. Therefore, the wave
should propagate through the medium without interaction, i.e., energy dissipation
should not occur. Somewhere, in our model derivation, relevant physical interaction
mechanisms must have been neglected. Let us mention at least two of them:

350
13
Linear Optical Constants I
• Firstly, our assumption on rigid permanent dipoles is a rather crude model, appli-
cable at low frequencies only. At higher frequencies, other degrees of freedom
such as the oscillations of nuclei and electrons will dominate the interaction of
the polar molecules with electromagnetic radiation.
• Secondly, our idea on forming a macroscopic polarization by the alignment of
the permanent microscopic dipoles with the ﬁeld does not work at smallest wave-
length. In fact, reorientation will be caused by a torque acting on the dipole in
a homogeneous electric ﬁeld. This idea loses its sense when the ﬁeld is inho-
mogeneous, what certainly happens when the wavelength of the propagating
electromagnetic wave becomes comparable to the spatial extension of the dipole.
Then, the dielectric function will explicitly depend on the wavevector, a phe-
nomenon that is called spatial dispersion, but this is not taken into account in
terms of a response function like (13.25). Some more information on spatial
dispersion will be provided in Sect. 17.6.
13.6.2 Material Mixtures
Let us have a glance at a speciﬁc topic of applied material optics, namely the
optical properties of mixtures. Let us assume that we have prepared an optical
material as a physical mixture of a certain set of pure material, numbered by the
subscript j. Let each of the constituents occupy a volume fraction Vj of the whole
volume V. From V = 
j Vj we ﬁnd 1 = 
j
Vj
V ≡
j p j. The pj are called
volume ﬁlling factors of the j-th component in the mixture.
It is a common practice to quantify the mixing ratio in optics in terms of volume
ﬁlling factors, instead of working with mass contributions or molar fractions. The
reason is simple: The macroscopic polarization, which is in the basis of all our
dielectric theory, is deﬁned as the dipole moment per volume, and not per mass or
molar fraction [compare (12.7)].
Let us now assume that we have been able to prepare a mixture from a certain
set of constituents, each of them being characterized by its dielectric function and
a certain volume fraction. Are we able to predict the optical properties of the
mixture?
In order to clarify this point, we shall return to the Clausius–Mossotti
Eq. (12.16). In application to dielectric functions (instead of the static dielectric
constant), we have:
ε −1
ε + 2 = Nβ
3
(12.16) thus relates the microscopic polarizability as well as the concentration
of identical polarizing units to the dielectric function of the corresponding contin-
uum in the frames of the so-called quasistatic approximation (compare Sect. 12.4).
From a practical point of view, (12.16) offers a classical approach to modify the

13.6
Advanced Material
351
dielectric function (or correspondingly the optical constants) of a continuum by
changing its density. This is of course practicable in only rather narrow limits, and
therefore, any other mechanism would be welcome in order to tailor the optical
constants of a material to a desired value.
Intermixing two or more materials (i.e., the preparation of material mixtures)
offers the possibility to tailor optical constants in rather broad limits. Let us assume
that we have several materials numbered by the subscript j, each of them having
the polarizability βj. Instead of (12.16), we then have:
ε −1
ε + 2 =

j
N jβ j
3
(13.30)
ε has now to be regarded as the dielectric function of the mixture. Figure 13.7 on
right illustrates such a situation for the special case of two mixing partners.
Usually, the polarizabilities βj are unknown, instead we know the dielectric
functions of the mixing partners when being prepared as a pure material (Fig. 13.7,
left and center). We thus set:
ε j −1
ε j + 2 = N0 jβ j

Here we have introduced the volume ﬁlling factors pj according to:
p j ≡N j
N0 j
(13.33)
This is again illustrated in Fig. 13.7, for the special case of a binary mixture
with p1 = p2 = 0.5.
Note that all physical restrictions as discussed earlier in Sect. 12.4 remain valid.
In particular, throughout our derivation we have assumed that the physical mixing
process does not change the individual polarizabilities, in clear contrast to what
would be observed in chemical bonding.
Equation (13.32) practically coincides with the Lorentz–Lorenz mixing formula
(13.34):
ε −1
ε + 2 = ˆn2 −1
ˆn2 + 2 =

ˆn2

(13.34)
Clearly, in such a mixture, the choice of a proper mixing ratio as expressed
in terms of the ﬁlling factors allows tailoring the optical constants of the mixture
within rather broad limits.
In practice, (13.34) provides a manageable expression for predicting the opti-
cal properties of loosely packed dielectric mixtures. Clearly, the sum of the ﬁlling
factors in (13.34) must not exceed 1; if it is smaller than 1, then the rest of the
volume is “automatically” occupied by a medium with a dielectric function equal
to one, i.e., by air or vacuum. This is consistent with our derivation of the Clau-
sius–Mossotti equation, where the dielectric sphere was assumed to polarize in a
cavity that is empty, i.e., “ﬁlled with vacuum”. Note that in this case, the local
ﬁeld was calculated according to (12.15):
Eloc = ε + 2

Let us now have a glance at Fig. 13.8. It shows a transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image of a mixture of aluminum oxide Al2O3 (the bright frac-
tion) and silver particles (the dark spots). The bar in the left corner on the bottom
of the image indicates a length of 20 nm.
The silver particle size is well below the wavelength in the visible spectral
region, so that we will treat the material as optically homogeneous. In particu-
lar that means that we may make use of the quasistatic approximation. In the

353
Fig.13.8 On left: TEM-image of a composite thin ﬁlm built from Al2O3 with embedded isolated
silver particles; on right: schematic representation of a guest (red)—host (navy) system
present sample, the volume ﬁlling factor of the silver fraction is approximately
0.3. Accordingly, that of Al2O3 is 0.7.
In contrast to what has been illustrated in Fig. 13.7, Fig. 13.8 on left repre-
sents an example of a guest–host system: The dark inclusions obviously form a
guest fraction that is embedded in the bright host. Note the difference between
the schematic representations of mixtures shown on right of Figs. 13.7 and 13.8:
We cannot expect that (13.34) is automatically a good approach for modeling the
guest–host system.
The difference becomes clear when remembering the derivation of the Clau-
sius–Mossotti equation. Let us return to Fig. 12.6 on bottom. It demonstrates the
creation of a spherical cavity in a bulk material by removing a dielectric sphere
from that bulk. Note that the surface charges at the border of the cavity and the
sphere exactly compensate each other in the bulk. Therefore, when deriving the
Clausius–Mossotti Equation, we could assume a homogeneous polarization, as
well as homogeneous ﬁelds.
If, however, the sphere and the embedding material represent different mate-
rials, than those surface charges will no more exactly cancel out each other, and
instead, an excess dipole moment is formed at the borders of the inclusion. That
excess dipole moment may be calculated explicitly, formally replacing (12.15) by
the corresponding expression that relates the electric ﬁeld in a dielectric sphere
embedded in another host material to the ﬁeld applied in the host (task 13.7.5).
The result is rather transparent: Instead of (12.15), we now obtain (13.35), where
compared to (12.15) the dielectric function of the sphere is replaced by the ratio
of the dielectric functions of sphere and host. Hence, we replace:

The previously derived Lorentz–Lorenz approach appears to be a particular case
of (13.36), namely when setting εh = 1. In more detail, basing on the idea of the
excess dipole moment, (13.36) is derived in [3, pp. 57–64].
Equation (13.36) may now easily be applied to the situation shown in Fig. 13.8.
When associating the host material (aluminum oxide) with material 2, and the
guest fraction (the silver nanoparticles) with material 1, from (13.36) we obtain:
ε −ε2
ε + 2ε2

(13.37)
(13.37) represents a special case of the Maxwell Garnett mixing formula.
Of course, as seen from Fig. 13.8, in a real material, the inclusions may be of
nonspherical shapes. In this case, we may again make use of the depolarization
factors earlier introduced in Sect. 12.4 (Table 12.3). This results in:

Equation (13.38) represents a rather general optical mixing formula. Of course,
all dielectric functions here may be complex and frequency dependent. The (effec-
tive) dielectric function of the mixture ε appears to depend on the dielectric
functions of the constituents, their ﬁlling factors, and the morphology (via L).
According to the choice of εh, the following classiﬁcation of mixing models is
accepted:
Maxwell Garnett (MG) approach: It might be the most natural choice to regard
one of the constituents (say, the lth one) as the host material, and the others as the
inclusions. In the case shown in Fig. 13.8, it clearly makes sense to regard silver
as inclusion and the dielectric as the host. That is the philosophy of the Maxwell
Garnett approach. In this case, we have:

Note that the sum of the ﬁlling factors on the right hand is less than 1. In
application, one must keep in mind that (13.38a) depends on the choice of the
host function: It makes a difference whether material 1 is embedded in material 2
or vice versa.
Lorentz–Lorenz (LL) approach: The Lorentz–Lorenz approach assumes that all
inclusions polarize in vacuum (εh = 1). We therefore obtain:
(ε −1)
1 + (ε −1)L =

j
p j

ε j −1

1 +

ε j −1

L
(13.38b)
Effective Medium Approximation (EMA) or Bruggeman approach: Another
possibility is to assume that the dielectric function of the mixture itself acts as
the host medium for each of the inclusions. This leads to the following mixing
formula:
0 =

j
p j

ε j −ε

ε +

ε j −ε

L
(13.38c)
There is no general recipe which of these approaches works best. As a rule,
the MG theory works best when the constituents clearly may be subdivided into
inclusions and one matrix material. On the contrary, in the presence of percolation
or in molecular mixtures, the application of the EMA may lead to the best results.
Finally, highly porous materials might be well ﬁtted within the LL approach.
Note that L is conﬁned between L = 0 and L = 1. When assuming L = 0 and

j p j = 1, from (13.38) we immediately obtain:
ε =

j
p jε j
(13.38d)
On the other hand, when setting L = 1, we have:
ε−1 =

j
p jε j −1
(13.38e)
In binary mixtures with real positive dielectric functions, the pair of (13.38d)
and (13.38e) forms the so-called Wiener bounds of the dielectric function of the
mixture. Any physically reasonable mixing model must deliver dielectric functions
that fall in-between these bounds.

You wish to model the optical constants by a mixing model approach and need
information on the volume ﬁlling factors of aluminum and aluminum oxide. From
an elemental analysis, you know that the average ratio of atomic concentrations of
aluminum and oxygen atoms is 50%/50%. What is the volume ﬁlling factor of the
aluminum fraction?

Linear Optical Constants II: Classical
Dispersion Models
Abstract
Classical expressions for the dielectric function of continuous media in the pres-
ence of bound and/or free charge carriers are derived. The focus is on the single
and multioscillator models. Application examples include modeling of metal
and dielectric materials optical constants in various spectral regions.
14.1
Starting Point
We are now going to build a classical theory of the dispersion of optical constants
in a continuous medium. Again we start from Eq. (2.13), i.e., Newton’s law of
motion. In agreement to our assumptions made in Sects. 2.2 and 12.3, we assume
the existence of charge carriers in the medium that are accelerated by external
forces. The full external force contains contributions of the Coulomb force arising
from the electric ﬁeld of the light wave, as well as some frictional force aris-
ing from collisions of the charge carriers with any kind of collision partner. As
in Chap. 12, we formally discriminate between free and bound charge carriers:
While bound charge carriers feel an additional restoring force when being elon-
gated from their initial position, the free charge carriers do not. In agreement with
the neglected magnetization of the medium, the action of any Lorentz forces will
again be neglected.
14.2
Physical Idea
Of course, real materials may contain both free and bound electrons. Fortunately,
as charges are additive, all the degrees of freedom present in real matter will
contribute their dipole moments to the ﬁnal polarization that is obtained as a sum
over all dipole moments in the medium. Consequently, the susceptibilities that

correspond to different degrees of freedom (numbered by j) sum up to the full
susceptibility, so that the dielectric function will be:
ε(ω) = 1 +


χ j(ω)
(14.1)
where the χj are the susceptibilities obtained for the corresponding groups of
dipoles.
The idea is now to discuss the individual contributions to (14.1) separately.
This is of course an approximation only, but in our classical treatment as provided
here, it allows constructing a rather transparent physical picture on dispersion and
absorption phenomena in continuous media.
We will start with the simpler case of free electrons that are accelerated by the
electric ﬁeld of the light waves. The positive atomic cores are much heavier than
the electrons, and therefore, the cores will be considered as ﬁxed. Consequently
in our model, only the electrons are in motion when a harmonic electric ﬁeld is
applied. Nevertheless, in the following derivation, we will speak on charge carriers,
keeping in mind that usually we deal with free electrons.

14.3.1 Free Charge Carriers and Drude Function
Assuming that the motion of electrons is conﬁned to a region much smaller
than the wavelength, we may write for the movement of a single charge carrier
[compare (2.13) and (12.17)]:
qE = qE0e−iωt = m ¨x + 2γ m ˙x
(14.2)
m and q are the mass and charge of the charge carrier, and γ is a damping constant
necessary to consider the damping of the electrons movement. We assume that the
electric ﬁeld is polarized along the x-axis, hence we consider only movements of
the charge carrier along the x-axis. As in Sect. 12.3.5, we consider only the drift
motion of the charge carriers here, because the chaotic isotropic thermal movement
does not create a macroscopic dipole moment. For nonrelativistic velocities, the
Lorentz force may be neglected compared to the Coulomb force, so that only the
latter is apparent in (14.2).
Assuming x(t) = xoe−iωt, we obtain from (14.2): qE
m = −ω2x −2iγ ωx.
The oscillation of the charge carrier around its equilibrium position thus induces
an oscillating dipole moment according to:
d = qx = −q2E

If N is the number of free charge carriers per unit volume (the concentration
of free charge carriers), then the polarization P is given by
P = Nd = −q2N E

so that, according to (13.8), the susceptibility is:
χ(ω) = −Nq2

(14.3)
where the term Nq2
ε0m represents the square of the plasma frequency deﬁned as:

(14.4)
As predicted in Sect. 13.3, our derivation results in a complex and frequency-
dependent susceptibility. The corresponding dielectric function is given by:
ε(ω) = 1 −

p
ω2 + 2iγ ω
(14.5)
Figure 14.1 displays the principle shape of the real and imaginary parts of the
dielectric function from (14.5), as well as the corresponding optical constants. The
most striking feature appears in the refractive index, which is expected to be less
than one in broad spectral regions. In fact, the imaginary part of the complex
refractive index may be much larger than the real one. This is typical for metals,
and it causes the well-known metallic brightness in reﬂection at a metal surface.
Indeed, let us calculate the normal incidence reﬂection from a metallic surface
according to (13.24). When assuming air as incidence medium (n1 = 1) and the
second medium as the metal (ˆn2 = n + i K), from (13.24) we have:
R =

n1 −ˆn2
n1 + ˆn2

2
= (1 −n)2 + K 2
(1 + n)2 + K 2
This reﬂectance approaches R = 1 when n becomes signiﬁcantly smaller than
1.

14.3.2 Speciﬁcs of Ultrathin Metal Films
So far we have assumed that the damping parameter γ is determined by the
frequency of collisions the charge carrier suffers during its propagation in the
medium. Thus, in a bulk metal, γ is somehow related to the mean free path of the
charge carriers lfree. The smaller the mean free path is, the larger γ will be.
However, in ultrathin metal ﬁlms, collisions between charge carriers and the
ﬁlm surface may dominate over bulk collision effects, and this may lead to a
signiﬁcant reduction in the average mean free path. According to the classical
Drude theory, this will be accompanied by an increase in the Drude damping
parameter. A further decrease in ﬁlm thickness should be accompanied by a further
increase in γ .
This is nevertheless a strongly simpliﬁed picture, because it makes a difference
whether the charge carrier is specularly of diffusely scattered at the ﬁlm surface.
A specular reﬂection has no impact on the drift velocity parallel to the surface,
while diffuse reﬂection has. Hence, only the latter has to be taken into account
when calculating the effect of the ﬁlm thickness on the Drude damping parameter.
As is shown in earlier studies [1, 2], the simplest model treatment of the reduc-
tion in the mean free path of the charge carriers results in a thickness-dependent
average collision time τ given by:

Here, pspec is the relative amount of charge carriers that is specularly reﬂected
at the ﬁlm surface, and lfree the mean free path in the bulk material. dﬁlm is the ﬁlm
thickness. Note that in this approach, only charge carriers reﬂected diffusely from
the surface contribute to the mentioned thickness dependence. Then, we obtain a
manageable expression for the thickness-dependent Drude damping parameters in
thin ﬁlms according to:

Obviously, pspec →1 as well as dﬁlm →∞result in γ (dﬁlm) →γbulk. Oth-
erwise, the Drude parameter in the ﬁlm is expected to exceed the bulk value.
Figure 14.2 demonstrates some corresponding experimental results.
14.3.3 Bound Charge Carriers and Lorentzian Oscillator Model
Even in metals, most of the electrons are bound, although the free electrons are
utmost important for the speciﬁc optical behavior of metals. As everybody knows,
metals like silver, gold, and copper have quite a different optical appearance, and
this is a consequence of the response of the bound electron fraction. Of course,
the optical properties of pure dielectrics are exclusively determined by the motion
of bound charge carriers.
There is a more general question concerning the different role of negative
electrons and positively charged cores. Generally, both electrons and cores may
perform movements when being excited by external electric ﬁelds. But the cores
are much heavier. In terms of classical physics, the vibrational eigenfrequencies of
a system are determined by the restoring forces and the masses of the systems con-
stituents. Assuming a typical core being 104 times heavier than an electron, one
would expect the eigenfrequencies of the core motion approximately 100 times
lower than that of electrons that are equally tight bound (in terms of quantum
mechanics, these are the valence electrons). Therefore, at high frequencies, the

364
14
Linear Optical Constants II: Classical Dispersion Models
movement of the cores may be neglected. At lower frequencies (and this is usu-
ally the infrared spectral region), the movements of the atomic nuclei determine
the optical properties of the material.
On the other hand, not all electrons are equally tight bound. Although this is
again rather a quantum mechanical matter, we may formally assume, that there
are groups of electrons (core electrons) that suffer much higher restoring forces
than the other (the valence) electrons. Consequently, there are different groups of
electrons with different eigenfrequencies (compare Sect. 2.5).
The oscillator model derived in the following is very general. It may be applied
to the intramolecular motion of nuclei (in infrared spectroscopy) as well as to
bound electrons. So that we will simply speak in the following on induced dipole
moments and not care about their physical origin.
So let us regard the motion of a charge carrier, which is bound to its equilibrium
position (x = 0) by an elastic restoring force. An oscillating local ﬁeld may lead to
small (x <<λ) movements of the charge carriers, thus inducing dipoles that interact
with the ﬁeld. The polarizability is now obtained according to (12.5):
β = q2
ε0m
1
ω2
0 −ω2 −2iωγ
When assuming that the microscopic induced dipoles are much smaller than the
wavelength of the incident light (quasistatic approximation), the relation between
the polarizability and the dielectric function is identical to the result obtained
earlier in the frames of electrostatics (12.16). Therefore, we ﬁnd the dielectric
function according to the Clausius–Mossotti equation:
ε −1
ε + 2 = Nβ
3
⇔ε = 1 +
Nβ
1 −Nβ
3
(14.7)
or the Lorentz–Lorenz equation.
ˆn2 −1
ˆn2 + 2 = Nβ
3
(14.7a)
The signiﬁcance of these rather simple equations is in that they relate micro-
scopic optical parameters (the polarizability β) to macroscopically measurable
parameters (optical constants). In other words, measurements on the macroscopic
scale, which yield the optical constants of a material, give further access to micro-
scopic parameters such as molecular or atomic polarizabilities. In fact, this is the
point from where analytical optical spectroscopy starts.
Let us have a look at the consequences. We have a microscopic polarizability
according to (12.5) and a dielectric function from (14.7). In combination, that
yields:

is the resonance frequency valid for the dielectric function. The angular frequency
ωp is again given by (14.4), but N has now the meaning of the concentration of
bound electrons. The dielectric function has exactly the same spectral shape as the
polarizability, but the resonance position in ε is red-shifted with respect to that of
the polarizability. The larger the density, the larger is the red shift.
Figure 14.3 shows the real and imaginary parts of a dielectric function accord-
ing to (14.8), and Fig. 14.4 the optical constants. We see that in the vicinity of
the resonance frequency, the imaginary parts of both the dielectric function and
the index of refraction show a local maximum. That means that at this frequency
the light wave is effectively damped. The imaginary part of the dielectric func-
tion therefore describes an absorption line with a characteristic shape, which is
called a Lorentzian line. In the region of strong damping, the refractive index n
decreases with increasing frequency (anomalous dispersion). On the contrary, in
the transparency regions, where damping is negligible, n increases with increas-
ing frequency (normal dispersion). Note that at sufﬁciently large frequencies, the

refractive index becomes smaller than 1. Therefore, refractive indices in the X-ray
region are usually smaller than 1. For inﬁnitely large frequencies, the refractive
index approaches 1.
14.4
Consistency Considerations
All the classical dispersion models derived in the frames of this book have common
features, namely:
• The dielectric function as well as the index of refraction appear to be complex,
i.e., have real and imaginary parts
• The dielectric function as well as the index of refraction are frequency
dependent, i.e., show dispersion
Both features are consistent with the conclusions from the general treatment
provided in Sect. 13.3.
Concerning the oscillator model, so it might seem strange that the dielectric
function is resonant at a frequency that is red-shifted with respect to that of the
single oscillator. Indeed, while the microscopic polarizability according to (12.4)
has a resonance at ω = ω0, the resonance of the dielectric function given in
(14.8) is red-shifted according to ˜ω2
0 ≡ω2
0 −
ω2
p
3 . The larger the density of the
medium is, the larger the red shift is expected. The reason is in the self-consistent
approach we have presented before: Clearly, provided that the electric ﬁeld strength
amplitude does not depend on the frequency, any microscopic dipole will absorb a
maximum of light when the incident frequency coincides with its own resonance
frequency. But when assuming that the externally applied ﬁeld has a frequency-
independent amplitude, the local ﬁelds according to Table 12.3 will not, because
of the frequency dependence of the dielectric function. As an illustration one could
imagine a microscopic dipole that would “like to absorb” at ω = ω0 but cannot
because the neighboring dipoles have already absorbed all the light. Therefore,
the dipole must absorb at a somewhat shifted frequency—and in fact so must all
of the dipoles. Then it is the compromise between the resonant behavior of the
single dipole and the local electric ﬁeld available in the medium that deﬁnes the
frequency shift of the resonance position of the dipole response in a dense medium.
Equations (14.8) and (14.8a) are relevant when the depolarization factor is equal
to 1/3. For other depolarization factors, (14.8a) generalizes to (14.8b):
˜ω2
0 = ω2
0 −Lω2
p
(14.8b)
Then, the Drude function appears to be a particular case of (14.8), when setting
L = 0 and ω0 = 0 (compare the corresponding discussion in (12.4) in this regard).
Real materials, of course, have (much) more than one degree of freedom, and
therefore the assumption of one single resonance frequency may be insufﬁcient

in many practical modeling situations. By making use of (14.1), we therefore
generalize our classical dielectric functions to:
ε(ω) = 1 −

p,free
ω2 + 2iωγ + ω2
p

j
f j
˜ω2
0 j −ω2 −2iωγ j
(14.9)
We have now made the reasonable assumption that the medium has both free
charge carriers (with concentration Nfree) and bound charge carriers (with concen-
tration Nbound). In order to not confuse these concentrations, in (14.9) we have
introduced the “plasma frequencies” ω2
p,free =
Nfreeq2
ε0m
and ω2
p =
Nboundq2
ε0m
. The
index j counts the resonance frequencies characteristic for a given medium. If
more than one resonance frequency is considered, it is common to speak on the
multi oscillator model. The dimensionless parameters f j are real and positive and
may be regarded as classical analogous to the oscillator strength as relevant for
light absorption.
When assuming the model case of a pure dielectric, from (14.9) we ﬁnd:
ε(ω) = 1 + ω2
p

j

0 j −ω2 −2iωγ j
(14.9a)
Figure 14.5 shows the thus described dielectric function and optical constants
in the vicinity of several resonance frequencies.
Note that again, apart from resonances, normal dispersion is observed, while in
spectral regions with strong light absorption, the dispersion turns to be anomalous.
Normal dispersion is easily demonstrated, for example, by the sequence of colors
observed after white light has passed through a glass prism.
Note further that in terms of (14.9a), any dielectric has a static dielectric con-
stant that is larger than one, while for inﬁnitely large frequencies, the dielectric
function approaches the value one from below. This is a physically rather transpar-
ent result, because at arbitrarily small frequencies, the charge carriers will always
be able to comply with the oscillation of the ﬁeld, such that the dielectric medium
will always form a macroscopic polarization, and thus the dielectric constant of
the medium will be larger than one. At highest frequencies, however, the inertness
of the charge carriers will no more permit the charge carriers to oscillate with the
ﬁeld, such that the medium becomes transparent and, because of a lack of efﬁ-
cient light–matter interaction mechanisms, the light wave propagates through the
medium almost like through vacuum. But that means, that whenever the refractive
index is supposed to be a continuous function of the angular frequency, spec-
tral regions with anomalous dispersion must necessarily exist. Moreover, when
associating anomalous dispersion with spectral regions of signiﬁcant light absorp-
tion, then the observation of a dielectric constant larger than one indicates the
presence of spectral regions where the medium must absorb light. From here we
can formulate the hypothesis that light refraction and absorption are physically
interconnected phenomena, and in particular, that the dispersions of the real and

imaginary parts of the dielectric function must be correlated to each other. The
formulation of that correlation will form the content of the next Chap. 15.
Let us now turn to simple examples on how the rather involved dispersion
curves shown in Fig. 14.5 may manifest themselves in a real spectrum. Once
we principally deal with absorbing materials, the transmission signal may be
suppressed in many practical cases. Instead, let us have a look on the reﬂec-
tion spectrum recorded at normal incidence at the air-material surface. Then,
Eq. (13.24) should apply, while the optical constants of the medium obey (14.9).
Figure 14.6 shows the MIR reﬂection spectrum of a fused silica surface together
with the associated optical constants. Obviously, the spectral features observed in
the recorded reﬂection spectrum reproduce major spectral features apparent in both
n and K.
Correspondingly, Fig. 14.7 shows the reﬂectance of an aluminum surface at
air together with the optical constants of aluminum. The high reﬂection is clearly

In summary, we are now familiar with three classical models that are use-
ful to describe the optical properties of condensed matter. The orientation and
reorientation of permanent molecular dipoles are very inert, and it will cause a
remarkable optical response only in the microwave (MW) or far infrared (FIR)
spectral regions. In liquids and also in some solids (for example ice), it may be
tackled by means of Debye’s equations. Drude’s function describes the optical
properties of free charge carriers, and depending on their concentration, it may
be of use from the microwave up to the visible (VIS) or even ultraviolet (UV)

absorption and dispersion in the presence of distinct spectral lines. In the mid-
dle infrared (MIR), it may be used to describe the response of core vibrations in
molecules and solids. The excitation of valence electrons in atoms or molecules
causes absorption lines in the visible or ultraviolet (UV) spectral regions, while
core electron excitation dominates the X-ray region. An overview on the possible
optical spectrum of condensed matter is given in Fig. 14.8.
More quantitative information may be obtained from Table 14.1.

The wavelength (and related) data may slightly differ in different sources
where a and bj are constant coefﬁcients. They are interconnected with each other
due to the requirement that the refractive index must approach one when the wave-
length approaches zero. Equations (14.9b) and (14.9c) are possible writings of
the Sellmeier dispersion formula. In Fig. 14.8, it may be successfully applied for
describing the dispersion in spectral regions of relative transparency.
Another common dispersion formula is obtained when expanding (14.9b) into
a series. This way one easily obtains the Cauchy formula according to:
n2 = A + Bν2 + Cν4 + · · · −B′ν−2 −C′ν−4 −· · ·
(14.9d)
Here, the A-, B-, and C-values are new constants. Equation (14.9d) is again
applicable in the regions of relative transparency.
14.5.2 Inhomogeneous Broadening
As we have already indicated in Sect. 2.6/Fig. 2.10, an inhomogeneously broad-
ened absorption line may be understood as a superposition of a multiplicity of
much narrower individual absorption lines. According to the underlying distribu-
tion in concentration and oscillator strength of these individual lines, the line shape

of an inhomogeneously broadened spectral line may vary. We will exemplify two
different possibilities here:
Brendel model: The Brendel model can be tackled as a particular case of
Eq. (14.9a) [4]. It pursues the speciﬁcs of optical materials, which are charac-
terized by ﬂuctuations of the local density in the material, which gives rise to
ﬂuctuations in the resonance frequencies according to (14.8b) and thus provides
an inhomogeneous line broadening mechanism (compare Fig. 2.10).
Let us for simplicity assume that the mentioned ﬂuctuations result in a distribu-
tion of local resonance frequencies around a central frequency ω0. When assuming
a Gaussian distribution of these resonance frequencies, an approximate calculation
of the “averaged” dielectric function is performed by the equation:
ε(ω) = 1 +

−(ξ −ω0)2

ω2
p
ξ2 −ω2 −2iγ ωdξ
(14.10)
Here, σ is the standard deviation of the assumed Gaussian distribution, which
again deﬁnes the inhomogeneous contribution to the width of the absorption line
deﬁned by the imaginary part of ε, while γ is the typical homogeneous linewidth
of the Lorentzian oscillator. The shape of the absorption line is now deﬁned by
the relation between σ and γ: In the case of σ ≫γ, a Gaussian lineshape will be
observed, while for σ ≪γ, we will ﬁnd a rather Lorentzian behavior. When both
linewidth contributions are comparable to each other, we have σ ≈γ, and then
we obtain a so-called Voigt line. Voigt line or even Gaussian line ﬁts may appear
very useful in applied solid-state spectroscopy.
The beta-distributed oscillator (β_do) model: In the β_do model, it is the
assumed that the envelope of the mentioned multiplicity of individual absorption
is formed by a Beta-distribution being proportional to
wβ_do(ω) =

(ω−ωa)A−1(ωb−ω)B−1
 ωb
ωa (ω−ωa)A−1(ωb−ω)B−1dω; A, B > 0; ω ∈(ωa, ωb)
0; ω /∈(ωa, ωb)
.
(14.11)
The real parameters A, B, ωa, and ωb are free parameters within the β_do model
[5, 6]. It is further assumed that all of the mentioned individual transitions may
be modeled by Lorentzians with identical homogeneous FWHM linewidth 2γ . γ
thus appears as the ﬁfth model parameter. The dielectric function is then given by:
ε(ω) = 1 + J

(14.12)
Here J is a sixth model parameter, it has the sense of an oscillator strength.
Figure 14.9 shows an example on the optical constants dispersion as described in
terms of the β_do model. Compared to the single oscillator model (Fig. 14.4),
the β_do model clearly has more ﬂexibility in modeling various (in particular
asymmetric) shapes of the absorption feature, in particular in modeling what is
called an absorption edge, deﬁned by the parameter (or threshold frequency or
absorption onset frequency) ωa in (14.11) (Fig. 14.9).

14.6.1 Oscillator Model and Dispersion Law
Let us now return to the electromagnetic wave propagating through a dielectric
medium along the z-direction. According to (13.13) and (13.14) we have:
E = E0e−i(ωt−ω

√ε(ω)z)
With k = ± ω

√ε(ω).
Let us further assume that the angular frequency of the electromagnetic wave
falls close to one of the resonance frequencies (say, ωres) in (14.9) (see Fig. 14.10):
ε(ω)|ω≈ωres = 1 + ω2

(14.13)
Here, for simplicity, all non-resonant contributions to the susceptibility of the
dielectric function have been condensed into the merely frequency-dependent term
εN R. This leads us to the expression for the wavevector (the dispersion law):
k(ω) = ω

Note now that according to (13.8), the polarization is given by:
P = ε0[ε(ω) −1]E = ε0[ε(ω) −1]E0e−i(ωt−kz)
This way, in addition to the electromagnetic wave, there is a (mechanical)
polarization wave propagating synchronously to the electromagnetic wave through
the dielectric medium. This excitation, which represents a hybrid of the electro-
magnetic wave and the polarization wave, is called a propagating polariton. The
dispersion relation of a polariton is visualized in Fig. 14.11.
More precisely, what we call a polariton is a quant of this hybrid phe-
nomenon composed by an electromagnetic and a mechanical wave. Note that in
off-resonance conditions, by means of (14.15), we may rewrite (14.14) in a more

14.6.2 The Dielectric Function of a Gas of Diatomic Molecules
in the FIR
In a gas, similar to (12.16a), we set

(14.16)
When focusing on the FIR, main contributions arise from the rotational degrees
of freedom. A diatomic molecule has two rotational degrees of freedom perpen-
dicular to its axis, because one of the diagonal elements of its tensor of inertia
is zero. Assuming a chaotic distribution of rotation directions, only 2/3 of the
molecules therefore contribute to the discussed interaction mechanism with an
electromagnetic wave propagating along the z-axis. In average we expect:

n of a medium may be regarded as real and is given by: n2(ω) = 1−
ω2
p
ω2 . It is obvi-
ous that n is smaller than 1, so that the phase velocity of an electromagnetic wave
propagating in such a medium will be larger than the velocity of light in vacuum
c. However, in ﬁrst-order dispersion theory, a short light pulse with a frequency
spectrum centered at ω0 >> ωp traveling through such a medium propagates with
the group velocity. Assuming n2(ω) = 1 −

14.7.2. In the X-ray spectral region, the optical constants are usually almost real
and close to one. Therefore, the complex refractive index in the X-ray region may
be expressed through the small parameters δ and β (don’t confuse with polar-
izability) via: n + i K = 1 −δ + iβ with δ, β ≪1. Consider now a plane
surface between vacuum and a material with given δ and β and express the normal

Linear Optical Constants III: The
Kramers–Kronig Relations
ABSTRACT
The Kramers–Kronig relations establish a fundamental relationship between the
dispersions of the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility or the dielectric
function. This way refraction of light and energy dissipation appear to be inter-
connected phenomena. Kramers–Kronig relations are derived for both insulators
and electrical conductors. Simple sum rules are derived, too.
15.1
Starting Point
In the previous paragraphs, we have essentially introduced three different classical
dispersion models, namely the Debye model for orientation polarization, the Drude
model for the response of free charge carriers, and the Lorentzian oscillator model
for the response of bound charge carriers. Let us summarize the observed types of
dispersion in Fig. 15.1.
When comparing the dispersion curves shown in Fig. 15.1 and the underlying
formulas it becomes evident, that all the models have certain common features.
Thus, in the limiting case of inﬁnitely large frequencies, in all models, the real
part of the dielectric function approaches the value one, and the imaginary part the
value zero. This is not astonishing, because all charge carriers have a certain mass
and are thus inert. Hence, they are unable to follow the oscillations of an elec-
tric ﬁeld when the frequency is too high. Therefore, the medium does practically
no more interact with the electromagnetic wave, such that the latter propagates
through the medium like through vacuum. This is consistent with the experimen-
tal fact that γ-radiation is able to propagate through solid matter that does not
transmit visible light (compare Sect. 14.4).
Another obvious feature is the correlation between the frequency dependence of
the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function. Indeed, prominent structures
in the dispersion of Re ε occur, whenever Im ε is close to a local maximum. In

Fig.15.1 Dispersion of the dielectric function and the complex index of refraction as predicted
in terms of various classical models
regions of relative transparency, Im ε is negligible and Re ε shows a rather smooth
frequency dependence. The same conclusion applies for the frequency dependence
of the refractive index and the extinction coefﬁcient. This correlation suggests that
refraction and absorption are intercorrelated phenomena and cannot be modeled
independently from each other. This empirical ﬁnding is the starting point for the
material developed in this chapter.
15.2
Physical Idea
The physical idea is that (13.5) completely deﬁnes the polarization (i.e., both its
amplitude and phase) of a homogeneous and isotropic medium in the time domain.
This way the real response function κ = κ(t) is expected to contain the full infor-
mation on both refraction and absorption phenomena. The polarization is then

In agreement to the causality principle, the polarization thus depends on the
ﬁeld behavior in the past, but not in the future. For the special case of a
monochromatic ﬁeld, in particular we have from (13.6) and (13.7):

Because of causality, the response function is thus invariant with respect to
multiple multiplication with the step function.

Obviously, our ansatz for the susceptibility corresponds to an inﬁnite series
according to:
χ(ω) = A0 + A1ω + A2ω2 + A3ω3 + ...
(15.2)
where the Aj—values are constants. Thereby the even orders in ω compose the
real part, while the odd orders compose the imaginary part of the susceptibility or
the dielectric function. As the result, we obtain the important symmetry relations:
Re χ(−ω) = Re χ(ω); Im χ(−ω) = −Im χ(ω)
Re ε(−ω) = Re ε(ω); Im ε(−ω) = −Im ε(ω)
(15.3)

Hence, the real part of the dielectric function must be an even function of the
frequency, while the imaginary part is an odd one. For ω = 0, both the suscepti-
bility and the dielectric function become real with χ = A0. This is clearly relevant
for dielectric materials.

Because of the oscillatory behavior of the integrand, however, this improper
integral does not exist in a strong mathematical sense. It exists only in the sense
of so-called generalized functions, a branch of mathematics that is beyond the
topics covered in this book. We will use the results obtained in the frames of this
theory, but in order to make the background somewhat transparent, let us have a
look at the following physical argumentation:
Return to (15.1). As a result of causality, we found it that the response
function of the regarded system should be invariant with respect to multi-
plication with the step function. But this requirement may be relaxed. In
any real physical system, the memory to an external perturbation will be
restricted to certain characteristic relaxation times, and consequently, the

response function should approach zero for large positive arguments. There-
fore, the concrete behavior of the step function for largest arguments is not so
essential. In fact the true Fourier image of the step function (if it would exist)
may be replaced by an alternative expression corresponding to another step-
like function that leads to the same result when performing the integration
over ξ in (15.1) (Fig. 15.2).
We therefore replace the Fourier image of the step function by:

The important conclusion is, that as a consequence of causality, the dispersion
of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function are interconnected to each
other via the integral transformations (15.4) and (15.4a).
In (15.4) and (15.4a), the susceptibility or the dielectric functions have to
be deﬁned for positive and negative frequencies. That does not cause any prob-
lems. According to (15.3), the imaginary part of the dielectric function has to be
regarded as an odd function of the frequency, while the real part is an even one.
Consequently, (15.4a) may be rewritten in the more familiar manner:

Consistency Considerations
This paragraph may be kept short. Obviously, relation (15.4b) provides the cor-
relations between refraction and absorption phenomena we have expected in
Sect. 15.1. The extreme cases are well-described. Thus, for ω = 0, we ﬁnd a real
dielectric constant that must be larger than one if the medium is dissipative, while
for ω →∞, the dielectric function approaches the value 1. In a denser medium,
more dipols are present, and therefore Im ε in (15.4b) should be larger, which is
expected to result in an increase in the static dielectric constant or the refractive
index at low frequencies. All this sounds very reasonable and well consistent to
what we have described so far.

15.5
Application to Practical Problems
387
However, when returning to Fig. 15.1, our formulas are unable to reproduce
the optical behavior of conductors at lowest frequencies. Obviously, the treatment
developed so far is only valid for ideal dielectrics. What is the reason for this
discrepancy?
Let us return to the Drude function (14.3). For ω →0, it behaves like:
χDrude(ω)|ω→0 ≈i · Nq2
ε0m ·
1
2γ ω = i σstat
ε0ω
This is obviously inconsistent with (15.1) and (15.2), which was in the basis
of our derivation of (15.4b). The physical reason is clear: For a conductor, (15.1)
must simply diverge when the frequency is zero. The reason is, that in a static
electric ﬁeld, a free charge carrier could move for inﬁnitely large distances from its
starting position, which causes an inﬁnitely large static dipole moment. Therefore,
in order to correctly describe the optical behavior of conducting media, (15.2) must
be generalized according to (15.5):
χconductor(ω) = i σstat
ε0ω + A0 + A1ω + A2ω2 + A3ω3 + ...
(15.5)
This is generally different from (15.2), but for sufﬁciently high (optical) fre-
quencies, the term σstat
ε0ω has no signiﬁcance, so that (15.2) remains valid. Indeed,
already for ω > 2γ, A0 becomes larger by modulus than σstat
ε0ω . Note further that
(15.5) is still consistent with (15.3).
Our consistency considerations thus show that the Kramers–Kronig relations
derived so far are restricted in their validity to aplications to dielectrics. The
generalization to electric conductors will be topic of Sect. 15.6.1.
15.5
Application to Practical Problems
Let us use this short section to present some useful relationships that immediately
follow from (15.5) and (15.6). We start with the derivation of a simple dispersion
formula (Wemple’s dispersion formula), which is obtained for the refractive index
dispersion in a frequency region well below the region of absorption. We postulate
that absorption (a nonzero imaginary part of the dielectric function) is restricted
to a frequency range [ωA, ωB]. According to the mean value theorem, we have
Re ε(ω) =n2(ω) = 1 + 2

388

with ω ∈[ωA, ωB]; ω << ωA < ωB; Im ε(ω) = 0.
By structure, this dispersion formula is similar to the Sellmeier formula,
obtained for one single oscillator. In fact, in our derivation, the full absorption
structure has been replaced by a single oscillator centered at ω ∈[ωA, ωB].
Another conclusion concerns the static dielectric constant for nonconductive
materials. From (15.4b), for ω = 0 we get:
εstat = 1 + 2
π
 ∞
0
Im ε(ω)

(15.6)
So we see that the value of the static dielectric constant is directly connected
to the high-frequency behavior of Im ε. In dielectrics, it will always be larger than
one. On the other hand, for very high frequencies, we ﬁnd from (15.4b) (provided,
of course, that this integral exists!):
Re ε(ω)|ω→∞→1 −

πω2
 ∞

Im ε(ω2)ω2dω2
(15.7)
This approach is valid when the current frequency is much higher than the
frequencies where absorption occurs (it does not work for our writing of Debye’s
Eqs. (13.27), because of the slow descent of the imaginary part with increasing
frequency). We see that for very high frequencies, we still have to expect normal
dispersion, but the refractive index is smaller than one! This is a situation typical
for the X-ray region—compare Sect. 14.4 in this regards.
From here, we may again conclude that the real part of the dielectric function
of a dielectric must show anomalous dispersion in the vicinity of absorption struc-
tures, no matter whether or not the oscillator model is applicable. Indeed, in the
static case it is larger than one (15.7). As far as we have no absorption, it further
increases with frequency according to Wemple’s formula. When the frequency is
well above the absorption frequencies, we ﬁnd normal dispersion again, but the
refractive index is smaller than 1 (compare 14.9). Consequently, in the neighbor-
hood of absorption structures, the refractive index must decrease with frequency
(as far as it is regarded to be a continuous function of the frequency).
Let us ﬁnally come to an important sum rule. Let us return to the classical
equation of motion of a charge carrier according to (14.11). Assuming that the
electric ﬁeld of the wave E leads to a displacement of the charge q along the
x-axis, we write Newton’s equation of motion according to:
qE = qE0e−iωt = m ¨x + 2γ m ˙x + mω2
0x
Let us further assume:
x ∝e−iωt
In the limit of sufﬁciently high frequencies, we ﬁnd:
qE
m = −ω2x −2iγ ωx + ω2
0x


ω→∞→−ω2x; ⇒x →−qE
mω2
(15.8)

15.6

This result holds for any assumed resonance frequency and, in particular, also
for free charge carriers. From here, the expression for the dielectric function is
easily found as:
⇒P ≡ε0(ε −1)E = Nqx →−Nq2E
mω2
ε(ω →∞) →1 −

(15.9)
where N is the full concentration of charge carriers (electrons).
Comparing (15.7) and (15.9) leads us to the sum rule:
N = 2ε0m

Im ε(ω)ωdω
(15.10)
Hence, the integral absorption is connected to the concentration of dipoles that
cause the absorption. Rewriting (15.10) in terms of the optical constants, one
immediately obtains:
N = 2ε0mc
πq2
 ∞

(15.11)
Equation (15.11) is in the fundament of any quantitative spectroscopic analysis,
where the integral absorption is measured in order to determine the concentration
of any kind of absorption centers (molecules, impurities, and so on). Of course, in
any practical application, one will always use a ﬁnite frequency interval where the
integration in (15.11) is performed. Note the important result that the concentration
is related to the integral absorption and not to the peak absorption.

15.6.1 Kramers–Kronig Relations for Conductors
Equations (15.4–15.4b) are valid only for dielectrics. The reason is clear: The
integration interval involves the argument ω2 = 0, but as we have mentioned
in Sect. 15.4, (15.2) cannot be used to describe the low-frequency behavior of
conductors. Instead, basing on (15.5) we postulate:
χconductor(ω) ≡i σstat
ε0ω + χopt(ω)
Here, χopt behaves “regular” with respect to an expansion into a power series
of the angular frequency. Therefore, for χopt, the Kramers–Kronig relations hold

on the choice of l0. Therefore, the term 
n̸=l fnl should be equal to one for each l.
Thus, 
n̸=l fnl = 1 ∀l. What we have rederived this way is the oscillator strength
sum rule. Thereby, the basic idea was that the classical and quantum mechanical
expressions coincide for inﬁnitely large frequencies or photon energies. Practi-
cally, we have thus shown that the oscillator strength sum rule is consistent with
the correspondence principle.

Solids form a subset of continuous media and are macroscopically character-
ized by a well-deﬁned volume and a well-deﬁned shape. Often enough, they exhibit
some short- or long-ranging atomic order, which gives rise to certain characteristic
symmetry.

Introduction to Solid-State Physics
Abstract
Basic concepts of the physics of crystalline solids are introduced. In a single-
electron picture, the characteristic energy band structure is obtained as a result
of the spatial periodicity of the crystal lattice. Basing on the energy band occu-
pation, a distinction between metals and dielectrics is introduced. The essence
of partially ﬁlled bands for the formation of a DC electric conductivity is
illustrated.
16.1
Starting Point
According to the classiﬁcation provided in Sect. 12.1, solids belong to the cate-
gory of condensed matter, while they are phenomenologically distinguished from
liquids by a large shear modulus. The most popular class of solids is provided by
the crystalline solids (c-solids), i.e., solids that exhibit a strongly periodic spatial
arrangement of their atoms (Fig. 16.1). In this case, when the atoms are arranged
in a strongly periodic manner, they are called to form a crystal lattice.
But solids do not need to be crystalline. Thus, glasses form a class of solids
without a strongly periodic arrangement of their atoms (“frozen liquids”). Never-
theless, the atomic arrangement in glasses is not completely chaotic. Instead, it
turns out that the positions of the nearest neighbors of a selected atom are more or
less accurately predictable even in glasses, while with an increasing distance, the
probability density to observe an atom in a certain space element tends to smear
out more and more. This is considered in terms of the concept of short-range order,
which is still observed in glasses. In this context, the class of solids that exhibit
short-range order, while lacking long range order, forms the class of amorphous
solids (a-solids). This way, amorphous materials have to be distinguished from
completely disordered matter, which even lack any short-range order (Table 16.1).

Zallen [1, p. 12] mentioned a very simple and helpful thought experiment to
distinguish between an amorphous solid and a disordered system: Imagine a person
with a bad memory, who removes exactly one atom from an amorphous structure
and from a disordered system. Some days later he wants to reinsert the atoms into
their correct positions. Clearly, the person has forgotten from where the atoms
have been taken. But no doubt, a glance on the positions of the remaining atoms
in the amorphous structure will enable him to identify the former neighbors of the
removed atom, so that he will reinsert the atom approximately at the correct place.
In a disordered system, however, the remaining atomic positions will give no clue
about the missing one, and he will not be able to identify the former position.
In this context, Fig. 16.2 invites you, dear reader, to perform this experiment
for yourself. The ﬁgure shows the positions of atoms in a perfect crystal (left),
an amorphous solid (center), and a disordered system (right). But from each of
the systems, exactly one atom has been removed. You are invited to look at the
images carefully, before taking a pencil (see Fig. 16.3) and marking the position

• Covalent bonding
• Ionic bonding (compare also Fig. 10.6)
• Metallic bonding
• Van der Waals bonding
• Bonding through hydrogen bridges
Figure 16.3 illustrates simple examples of covalent and van der Waals bonding. In
a diamond crystal (on right), all carbon atoms are covalently bound to each other.
In graphite (on left), the two-dimensional honeycomb-like lattices form planes with
covalent bonding within the planes, while in-between the planes, van der Waals
bonding is dominant. In an ionic crystal like KCl, bonding occurs as a result of
electrostatic interaction between differently charged ions (Fig. 10.6). The picture
also demonstrates the ancient writing utensile called pencil.

Physical Idea
In condensed matter, atoms come close enough to each other that their electronic
wavefunctions start to overlap. According to what we have learned in Chap. 10,
that leads to a splitting of the previous atomic energy levels into a multiplicity
of levels, thus forming energy intervals where the energy levels are arranged in
a quasi-continuous manner. These energy intervals where “allowed” energy levels
are concentrated will further be called energy bands (See schematic representation
in Fig. 16.4). The closer the atoms come to each other, the broader these energy
bands will be, and the narrower the energy spacing (forbidden zone, energy gap,

(energy) band gap) Eg will be. At the same time, new hybrid electronic orbitals
are formed, such that an electron is no more necessarily localized in the vicinity
of “its” atomic core, but has a chance to become delocalized.
Let us now remember that electrons are fermions, such that the Pauli’s exclusion
principle is valid. Then, at zero (or a rather low) temperature T, all electrons try to
occupy the lowest by energy levels in the system. However, because of the Pauli
principle, no more than one electron is allowed to occupy a given state (compare
task 9.7.3 in this regard). The result is that that the electrons ﬁll up the energy
bands from bottom to top. We usually observe a certain set of completely ﬁlled
bands of lowest energy (Fig. 16.4). One of them is that of the highest energy, and
we will call that energy band, which has the highest energy among all completely
ﬁlled bands, the valence band. Then we have two possibilities. The next highest
energy band may be (at T = 0) either partially ﬁlled or completely empty. We
will call that band the conduction band. If the conduction band is empty at T = 0,
the material will be called a dielectric or a semiconductor (at the moment we will
not distinguish between these two classes of materials). If the conduction band
is partially ﬁlled, then the material is called a metal. This classiﬁcation makes
absolute sense, as we will see in Sect. 16.5.2.
This picture is of course very simpliﬁed, because in reality energy bands may
overlap, which gives rise to another material class called semimetals. But the
mentioned simple picture will be sufﬁcient for our purposes here.
We have already mentioned that solids do not need to be crystalline. Neverthe-
less, c-solids represent superb model systems for demonstrating striking physical
effects caused by speciﬁc symmetry properties. Thus, if the atomic arrangement is
ideally periodic, the whole system must be exactly reproduced when it is shifted
in space by a distance that coincides with an integer multiple of its period. We
will then use the terminology that the system must obey a discrete translation
invariance.
Let us illustrate this by a daily life example. Everybody knows tessellation
solution that ﬁll up a two-dimensional space in a periodic manner. An example is
provided in Fig. 16.5.
An obvious feature of this tessellation is that it may be periodically extended
to inﬁnity in both directions; hence, it obeys discrete translation invariance. We
will see in Sect. 16.3 that the translation invariance hast striking effects on the
properties of the wavefunctions of particles that propagate in such a periodic poten-
tial. But this is obviously not the whole story. A further glance at the tessellation
solution conﬁrms us that it is obviously also invariant with respect to rotations
for multiples of 90° (Fig. 16.6). In such a case, we speak on fourfold rotational
symmetry, because 90° = 360°/4. We come to the conclusion, that translational
invariance may be compatible at least with certain types of rotational symmetry.
What about inversion symmetry, which is utmost important for the optical
behavior? Obviously, inversion symmetry is present, as indicated by the black
arrows in Fig. 16.7 on left. On the other hand, there is no mirror symmetry

tures at positions mirrored with respect to the axis indicated as the black dashed

Let it now be the task to discuss the dynamics of the electrons in the potential
provided by the periodically arranged nuclei. Clearly, the potential U(r) should
reﬂect the symmetry in the arrangement of the nuclei. Then we would have to
solve a many-body task, because there is a huge number of electrons in a real
solid, and in fact, similar to the situation in molecules, the nuclei may also per-
form oscillations (with frequencies corresponding to typical MIR frequencies). The
approximate solution of suchlike many-body tasks is beyond the frame of this
course, and therefore, we will restrict on a much easier model task. What we will
discuss here is the movement of a single electron in a periodic potential U(r).
Then, the Schrödinger equation for that single electron is deﬁned by the rather
simple single-particle Hamiltonian ˆH = −ℏ2∇2
2me + U(r), where U(r) is now the
resulting potential provided by the nuclei and all the other electrons. And now, this
potential is postulated to be periodic in space and time-independent.

Let us imagine the atoms of a solid arranged in space in a completely periodic
manner. Such a periodic atomic arrangement is typical for crystals. Then, the posi-
tion of any lattice point may be given as the superposition of three basis vectors,

rn = n1a1 + n2a2 + n3a3
(16.1)
n1, n2, n3
integer.
The set of the shortest possible basis vectors spans a parallelepiped called the
primitive cell of the lattice. The length of these basis vectors deﬁnes what we call
the lattice constants.
Any vector as deﬁned by (16.1) will be further called a lattice vector. The trans-
lation of all lattice points by any lattice vector results in a complete reproduction
of the lattice (discrete translational invariance).
The rotation of the lattice by an angle ϕ may also result in the reproduction of
the complete lattice. If so, the lattice is told to have a rotational symmetry axis. If
ϕ = 2π/n with n—a positive integer, we speak about an (at least) n-fold rotational
symmetry axis. Obviously, the system shown in Fig. 16.5 has a fourfold rotational
axis (Fig. 16.6).
It may be shown that in a lattice as deﬁned by (16.1), n may accept values n
= 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 [2, p. 375]. Indeed, let us assume, that rotation by an angle
ϕ leads to a reproduction of the lattice deﬁned by (16.1). Any new lattice vector
obtained as a result of rotating (16.1) forms an angle ϕ with rn and will be called
rn,ϕ. Rotating into the reverse direction leads to the vector rn,-ϕ. Obviously, the
vector (rn,ϕ + rn,-ϕ) must again be a lattice vector, and it must be parallel to rn.
Thereby, the vector (rn,ϕ + rn,-ϕ) has the length of 2rncosϕ. On the other hand, it
must be possible to represent it in terms of (16.1), while because of the parallelity
to rn, it may be written as:
rn,ϕ + rn,−ϕ = m1a1 + m2a2 + m3a3 = Grn
= G(n1a1 + n2a2 + n3a3) = 2 cos ϕ(n1a1 + n2a2 + n3a3)
Here, G is a constant. Once all m-values must be integer for any chosen integer
n, we must require that G is also an integer number. In other words, we ﬁnd G =
2cos ϕ. On the other hand, −1≤cos ϕ ≤1. Therefore, G may accept the integer
values −2, −1, 0, +1, +2 only. From G = 2 cos ϕ = 2 cos(2π/n) we ﬁnd the
possible values n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Therefore, 5-, sevenfold or higher rotational
symmetry is impossible in crystal lattices with strong translational invariance.
A translational invariant tessellation solution combining elements of eight- and
fourfold rotational symmetry is exempliﬁed in Fig. 16.8. Obviously, the complete
system nevertheless has only fourfold rotational symmetry. In Fig. 16.9, three-
fold rotational symmetry is exempliﬁed in architectural applications. Even “total”
spherical symmetry is observed in nature (Fig. 16.10).
Remark: Note that the so-called quasicrystals provide tessellation solutions with
elements of ﬁvefold rotational symmetry, but they are not strongly periodic (trans-
lational invariant). Much work in this ﬁeld has been done by the 2020 Nobel Prize

These were examples of two-dimensional geometries. Typical real crystals are,
of course, three-dimensional. According to their crystalline structure, crystals may
be optically isotropic or anisotropic. Table 16.2 visualizes the so-called Bravais lat-
tices with the corresponding assignment to optical isotropy or anisotropy (uniaxial
crystals and biaxial crystals).
16.3.2 Single-Electron Approximation
Let us now see what happens when a single electron is brought in such a strongly
periodic potential. Let us assume that as the result of the periodic arrangement
of the atoms, a single electron “feels” a spatially periodic potential (provided
by the nuclei and all other electrons different from the discussed one) given by
(Fig. 16.11):
U(r + rn) = U(r)
(16.2)
For the movement of the discussed electron, we thus have the Schrödinger
equation:
ˆHψ j(r) = E jψ j(r)

Let us now deﬁne the translation operator ˆTn through
ˆTnψ(r) ≡ψ(r + rn)
(16.5)
From (16.2) we may conclude that ˆTn and ˆH commute and therefore have a
complete system of common eigenfunctions [3]. Consequently, for the ψi we have:
ˆTnψ j(r) = tnψ j(r) = ψ j(r + rn)
(16.6)
From the deﬁnition (16.5) it should be clear that two translation operators
ˆTn1 and ˆTn2 should commute, hence they have common eigenfunctions, too [4].
Once the normalization of ψi should not depend on the position of the origin of
coordinates chosen, the eigenvalue tn of the translation operator must fulﬁll:
|tn| = 1
which is fulﬁlled for all complex numbers with an absolute value 1. For tn we
therefore chose the representation:
tn = eikrn
(16.7)
with k, rn—real vectors.
Obviously, for a superposition of translations according to ˆTn1+n2 = ˆTn1 ˆTn2 =
ˆTn2 ˆTn1 we have the eigenvalues: tn1+n2 = tn1tn2.
From (16.6) and (16.7), for any given rn we therefore obtain:
ψ j(r + rn) = eikrnψ j(r)
(16.8)

16.3
Theoretical Considerations: Basics of Crystalline Solids
409
Equations (16.7) and (16.8) together indicate that for any eigenfunction of the
periodic Hamiltonian according to (16.2) there exists at least one wavevector k
such that a spatial displacement for an arbitrary lattice vector rn is equivalent to
multiplication of the wavefunction with the phase factor eikrn. The wavevector k
may be different for different wavefunctions, but in each case it should exist. All
of the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian deﬁned by (16.2) and (16.4) are thus
expected to be characterized by a certain k. Further, we therefore use the writing:
ˆHψk, j(r) = Ek, jψk, j(r)
(16.9)
with
Ek, j ≡E j(k)
Because k is continuous. The wavefunctions ψk, j may be written in terms of a
Bloch function according to:
ψk, j(r) = eikruk, j(r)
(16.10)
We then ﬁnd:
ˆTnψk, j(r) = ψk, j(r + rn) = eik(r+rn)uk, j(r + rn)
ˆTnψk, j(r) = tnψk, j(r) = eikrnψk, j(r) = eikrneikruk, j(r)
→uk, j(r) = uk, j(r + rn),
(16.11)
It follows that the functions uk,j are periodic and have the same period as the
lattice (Bloch theorem). The wavefunction of an electron in a spatially periodic
potential is therefore the product of a propagating plane wave with a periodic
function uk, j. The parameter ℏk is called the quasimomentum of the electron in
the corresponding quantum state.
Note that k is ambiguous. Indeed, according to (16.7), a given eigenvalue tn
corresponds to an inﬁnite number of k.
16.3.3 Reciprocal Lattice
Let us shortly comment on the ambiguity of k. Obviously any k′—value, which
differs from k by g according to
k′ = k + g;
g = 2πτ

a1 · (a2 × a3) = 1

a1 · (a2 × a3) = 0
And so on. So we ﬁnd:
eik′rn = eikrn;
k′ = k + g
(16.12)
The vectors g mark points in the so-called reciprocal lattice. A special construc-
tion of the primitive cell in the reciprocal lattice (the so-called Wigner–Seitz cell)
deﬁnes what we call the ﬁrst Brillouin zone.
16.4
Consistency Considerations
The essence of (16.10) is that the assumed periodicity of the potential U deﬁnes a
corresponding periodicity in the wavefunction of the electron propagating in that
potential. This is nothing astonishing; we have earlier identiﬁed other examples
where the symmetry of the potential (e.g., inversion symmetry) deﬁned the sym-
metry of the wavefunction (odd or even parity). This is by the way not a speciﬁc
quantum mechanical effect: Everybody knows from daily experience, that—for
example—the picture of standing surface waves in a vessel ﬁlled with water
depends on the speciﬁc symmetry of the vessel. It is therefore an effect rather
connected to wave physics in general.
Let us now return to Fig. 16.4 and the accompanying argumentation in
Sect. 16.2. Our idea was that the spatial overlap and the resulting interaction
between the electronic wavefunctions in condensed matter results in a splitting
of the atomic orbitals into many new orbitals, similarly as this has been demon-
strated in the context of covalent bonding in molecules (Chap. 10). Because of

the large number of electrons, this is expected to ﬁnally result in the formation of
quasi-continuous energy bands instead of discrete energy levels. But if so, then any
increase in the electron density should result in a further broadening of the bands
and, at the same time, in a narrowing of the forbidden zones. This is particularly
relevant for the width of the forbidden zone between the valence and conduction
band Eg, which is utmost important for the optical properties of a real material
in the NIR/VIS/UV spectral region (compare Table 2.2 in this context). Thus, an
increase in the electron concentration should result in a narrower band gap Eg.
But we also know that an increase in the electron concentration is expected to
result in an increase in the refractive index at low frequencies (compare (14.7) or
(14.7a)). Our argumentation therefore suggests that there should be a correlation
observed between refractive index and band gap Eg. This is indeed observed as
a general trend. As an example, Table 16.3 opposes the MIR refractive index to
the band gap (here indirect band gap—compare later Sect. 17.3.3) in diamond,
crystalline silicon, and crystalline germanium.
Thus, at least in this example, an increase in the band gap seems to be accom-
panied by a decrease in refractive index. This is by the way astonishing because
in fact we provided a rather naïve argumentation, which reﬂects maybe 10% of
the complexity of the interplay between refractive index and band gap. In fact,
the density of silicon is smaller than that of diamond. Nevertheless, the qualita-
tive result that we obtained from our naïve argumentation is reasonable. A more
sophisticated quantitative formulation of this correlation is provided by the Moss
rule established in semiconductor optics [5]:
n4Eg ≈const. (const. ≈95 eV)

Fig.16.13 Visualisation of E(k) in a periodic zone
state. In a completely ﬁlled band, because of the symmetry of E(k), each elec-
tron with a given group velocity will have a counterpart with exactly the opposite
value of the group velocity. Therefore, macroscopic charge transport is impossi-
ble within a completely ﬁlled band. And therefore, in Sect. 16.1, materials with
either completely ﬁlled or either completely empty bands have been classiﬁed as
insulators (dielectric).
An illustration on the nature of forbidden zones may be obtained from the
wave picture of the propagating electrons. When their wavevector approaches π/a,
their wavelength corresponds to 2a. Then, the reﬂections from two neighbored
lattice points lead to constructive interference in reﬂection, hence the reﬂection is
enhanced. The reﬂected waves themselves are back-reﬂected and so on, so that
ﬁnally instead of a propagating wave, a standing wave is generated. The group
velocity becomes zero, and propagation of electrons with corresponding k-vectors
is impossible.
Note in this context that the qualitative picture illustrated in Fig. 16.13 is more
general and not only applicable to the tight binding approach. In particular, it
allows obtaining valuable qualitative information about the behavior of electrons
in the conduction band as well.
16.5.2 Effective Masses
Let us now consider an extremum in a dispersion curve like shown in Fig. 16.13.
Let the extremum be located at k = k0. In the vicinity of that minimum, we have

An external force thus causes a change in the quasimomentum of the electron,
which means that the latter must occupy a new position in the dispersion curve
like exempliﬁed in Fig. 16.13. Correspondingly, it will change its group velocity.
This gives us the key for understanding the appearance of macroscopic charge
transport in a partially ﬁlled energy band, while macroscopic charge transport in a
completely ﬁlled band remains forbidden.

Fig.16.14 Visualization of the response of completely (red) and partially (black) ﬁlled bands to
an external ﬁeld. Note that because of charge carrier scattering processes, for a time-independent
applied electric ﬁeld, the number of charge carriers contributing to electrical conductivity as high-
lighted right on top remains constant as well, such that a constant voltage results in a DC electrical
current
Let us have a look at Fig. 16.14. In fact, it shows a detail from Fig. 16.13,
while we restrict to the discussion of k-vectors within the ﬁrst Brillouin zone,
which contains all necessary physical information. The hollow circles indicate
states occupied by electrons. The “red” dispersion curve now corresponds to a
completely ﬁlled energy band, while the “black” dispersion curve illustrates the
situation in a partially ﬁlled band. In equilibrium conditions, without applying an
external force F to the charge carriers, each electron with a group velocity differ-
ent from zero will have a counterpart with exactly the opposite value of the group
velocity, so that there is no macroscopic charge transport, no matter whether the
band is completely or only partially ﬁlled. This is the rather symmetric situation
visualized on the left of Fig. 16.14. If, however, a constant electric ﬁeld is applied,
the resulting Coulomb force acting on each of the electrons will act as an exter-
nal force different from zero. Then, according to (16.25), the “chain” of circles in
the corresponding dispersion curve must move to the right if the force is positive.
And now we see fundamental differences between the situations in the partially
and completely ﬁlled bands. In the partially ﬁlled band (black curve), there appear
charge carriers with uncompensated group velocities with the same sign. These
charge carriers cause a macroscopic electric charge transport. In the completely
ﬁlled band, however, because of the periodicity of the dispersion curve, each of
the charge carriers still has a counterpart with the opposite group velocity, so that
no charge transport is observed. Thus, completely ﬁlled bands cannot contribute
to DC electrical conductivity. Moreover, because of the equivalence of k-vectors

418
16
Introduction to Solid-State Physics
which differ from each other by a reciprocal lattice vector, the circle which has
“left” the ﬁrst Brillouin zone in Fig. 16.14 right on bottom, is in a physical sit-
uation that is equivalent to the “empty position” on the left side in the Brillouin
zone indicated by the dashed red arrow. Therefore, when restricting the discussion
to k-states in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone only, any circle that leaves the ﬁrst Brillouin
zone on the right side is in fact re-entering that zone from left again. Therefore,
the occupation situation in the ﬁlled band remains unchanged, no matter whether
the ﬁeld is different from zero or not.
Thus, if within a material all energy bands are either completely ﬁlled or com-
pletely empty, no DC electrical conductivity is observed. Those materials form the
class of electric insulators. On the contrary, materials with partially ﬁlled energy
bands are electrical conductors and usually assigned to metals. These are, for
example, materials built from atoms that altogether contribute an odd number of
valence electrons to the primitive cell of the crystal (such as in sodium or alu-
minum). In particular, the hydrogen atom has only one electron, although the 1s
orbital could accept two electrons. Therefore, frozen hydrogen should form a solid
with a half-ﬁlled band only, and therefore form a metal [7].

16.6.1 The Kronig–Penney Model
In addition to the model calculation performed in Sect. 16.4, let us have a look at a
periodic one-dimensional model potential, which allows to solve the Schrödinger
equation for a single particle moving in that potential exactly [8]. In the so-called
Kronig–Penney model, the particle (in our case the electron) is assumed to move in
a periodic rectangular potential as sketched in Fig. 16.15. Let a be the period, and b
be the width of the potential walls. The height of the potential walls should be U0,
while the potential is zero between the walls. Note the formal similarity with the
situation of quantum tunneling through a rectangular potential barrier, discussed

At x = −b, we ﬁnd:
ψ1(−b) = ψ2(−b) ⇒Ae−iαb + Be−iαb = Ce−βb + Deβb
However, when making use of (16.8), we may write:
ψ1(−b) = e−iκaψ1(a −b)
⇒Ce−βb + Deβb = e−iκa

tives:

So that for the four coefﬁcients, we have the four equations:

C −D = i α

Note that the right-hand part of this equation must be in-between the values −
1 and 1 in order to have a real solution for κ. In fact, this restriction results in
the formation of allowed and forbidden energy regions, i.e., the band structure.
In order to visualize this more explicitly, let us introduce the parameter (do not
confuse with a damping constant)
γ = mab
ℏ2 U0
(16.28)
It is proportional to the product Uob, i.e., the “area” occupied by a single barrier
in Fig. 16.15. Let us now consider the limiting case:
b →0 and U0 →∞, while γ = const.
That results in:
cos κa = γ sin αa
αa
+ cos αa
(16.29)
Figure 16.16 visualizes the dependence of γ sin αa
αa
+ cos αa as a function of αa.
Note that α is directly related to the electron energy. Whenever γ sin αa
αa
+ cos αa
becomes larger than +1 or smaller than −1, no solution for κ exists, and the
corresponding energy region is classiﬁed as a forbidden energy zone. The other
energy regions correspond to allowed energy bands.
Hence, this model calculation conﬁrms us about the expected energy band
structure obtained as a result of the periodicity of the assumed potential.

16.6.2 Once More About Consistency: Delocalized and Localized
Electron States
Let us return in this section to some considerations on the consistency of the single-
electron approximation introduced in Sect. 16.3.2. Let us ﬁrst recall the qualitative
picture we have developed in Sect. 10.3.2 when discussing the formation of cova-
lent bonding in the hydrogen molecule ion. Our idea was there, that once the two
hydrogen nuclei (protons) are close enough to each other, the electron might be
considered to be common to both of the nuclei, which we associated with the for-
mation of a molecule. On the other hand, when the nuclei are separated by a large
distance, the natural situation is that the electron forms a hydrogen atom with one
of the nuclei, while the other nucleus remains to be a positively charged hydrogen
ion, and it makes no sense assuming that the electron “belongs” to both of the
nuclei. Hence, the distance between the nuclei does matter.
What a about a hypothetical “crystal” with an interatomic spacing of 1 m? Will
we ﬁnd delocalized electrons described by Bloch functions, or will we simply
obtain a periodic arrangement of well-isolated atoms that do not “feel” each other?
Clearly, the second version appears more reasonable. But why?
Our idea expressed in Sect. 16.3.2 was that a single electron is moving in a
spatially periodic potential. This potential is assumed to be provided by the (ﬁxed
in this picture) nuclei and all the other electrons. But that already means that
we assume some cooperative behavior of the “other” electrons: If each of them is
spatially delocalized with a wavefunction according to (16.10), then the considered
electron feels the necessary periodic potential to also behave according to a Bloch

422
16
Introduction to Solid-State Physics
function. This picture is internally consistent, but unfortunately this does not mean,
that a considered physical system must behave accordingly.
The hypothetical picture of a crystal with an interatomic spacing of 1 m
becomes especially impressive when a material with a partially ﬁlled conduction
band (i.e., a metal) is discussed. Clearly, when the interatomic spacing becomes
inﬁnitely large, then the bandwidth B according to (16.21) approaches zero, such
that the effective mass becomes inﬁnitely large and the group velocity becomes
zero. Hence, in this limit we arrive at an insulator which is reasonable. But as soon
as the lattice constant becomes ﬁnite, the energy band picture we have derived so
far predicts a metallic behavior of the material. This is not reasonable, and even
worse, it is in contradiction with reality. In fact, there are materials that are elec-
trically isolating, although the band theory described so far predicts a metallic
behavior.
The point is that our single-electron picture neglects many-body effects [1,
pp. 223–231]. In particular, correlations between the electrons resulting from their
Coulomb interactions are not taken into account. This does not cause problems
as long as the bandwidth B is sufﬁciently large. A partially ﬁlled broad energy
band allows all the (delocalized in this picture) electrons occupying energy lev-
els that correspond to a smaller kinetic energy as it would be the case if each
electron would stay localized with “its” atom (compare with our discussion in
Sect. 10.4). Thus, delocalization seems favored by energy, and this is absolutely
true in a single-electron picture. However, in a many-electron picture, delocaliza-
tion of electrons also means that electrons may come close to each other, which
results in an increase in the potential energy because of the Coulomb interaction
between the electrons. This Coulomb interaction between the electrons has how-
ever not been taken into account in Sect. 16.5.1, where we used a single-electron
picture. As long as the gain in kinetic energy overcompensates the increase in
potential energy (the case of a large B), everything is ﬁne with our band the-
ory, and the electrons stay delocalized. If however the bandwidth B is small such
that the increase in Coulomb energy overcompensates the gain in kinetic energy,
then the delocalization of electrons is no more favored, and localization takes
place. In this case, the corresponding material behaves like an insulator although
band theory would predict a partially ﬁlled band and consequently metallic behav-
ior. Such materials are called Mott insulators, and the corresponding localization
phenomenon is called Mott localization.
Note further, that in amorphous materials, long-range order is absent, such that
our derivations that have based on strong periodicity of the potential are a priori
invalid. Therefore, in amorphous materials, besides of delocalized electronic states
one naturally observes also localized states. This occurs when the disorder-induced
spread in the depth of the potential valleys in a potential like shown in Fig. 16.11 or
Fig. 16.15 exceeds the nominal bandwidth B. The corresponding disorder-induced
localization mechanism is called Anderson localization. As a rule, in the presence
of some atomic disorder, spatially localized electronic states form band tails on top
and bottom of the regarded energy band, while deeply inside the band, electronic
states remain delocalized.

Tasks for Self-check
16.7.1 The simplest model idea for a quantum mechanical description of conduc-
tion electrons in a solid is to treat them as freely moving within a potential
box given by the extensions of the considered piece of metal. Assuming a
temperature close to zero, determine the maximum electron energy occur-
ring in the ground state, as well as the average kinetic electron energy
[9].
16.7.2 In order to estimate the eigenenergies of the bound states of the so-called
π-electrons in benzene, let us consider a set of 6 periodically arranged
δ-potentials according to task 4.7.4. The periodical arrangement of the
potentials brings the system close to the Kronig–Penney model that has
been investigated in Sect. 16.6. In order to imitate the ring in terms of
the one-dimensional treatment within the Kronig–Penney model, we intro-
duce the extra requirement: ψ(x) = ψ(x + 6a) ∀x. a is now the distance
between two adjacent carbon nuclei in the sixfold benzene ring. Investigate
the position of the energy levels of a single-bound electron in that system!

Introduction to Solid-State Optics
Abstract
Expressions for the dielectric function of optically isotropic solids are derived
and discussed. Direct as well as indirect electronic absorption processes in
crystals are considered, as well as basic features of the optical properties of
amorphous solids. Typical power-law dependencies for describing the spectral
shape of the absorption edge of solids are introduced.
17.1
Starting Point
A glance on the page number will conﬁrm you, dear reader, that we are approach-
ing the end of the course. Therefore, it is not astonishing that now we a drawing
together more and more of the previously developed concepts in order to pro-
vide a quantitative description of more and more complex phenomena. So let us
summarize what we will need from the previous paragraphs.
In this context, it is worth having a look at Fig. 17.1 on top. It is essentially a
detail from Fig. 16.4, but symbolizing quantum transitions between discrete energy
levels (on left) or energy bands (on right). The situation on left might correspond
to an atom or molecule, while the situation on right illustrates the speciﬁcs of a
solid.
The concepts we have derived so far enable us to describe the optical behavior
of a quantum system with discrete energy levels in a semiclassical language. In
particular, we have developed a perturbation approach for calculating the quantum
transition rate and written down a corresponding semiclassical expression for the
polarizability. This gives us access to the optical constants of the system shown on
left of Fig. 17.1.
In the solid state, however, we have a continuous distribution of energy lev-
els, and thus our treatment will need to be modiﬁed. In fact, we will develop
two approaches to get access to the dielectric function of a solid. These two

or molecules (HOMO–LUMO transition), and energy bands (on right) to the situation in a solid
approaches are symbolized by the white arrows in the scheme presented on bot-
tom of Fig. 17.1. The ﬁrst one is to make use of the Fermi Golden rule introduced
in Chap. 6. For that we will have to operate in termini of transition matrix ele-
ments as well as densities of states. The latter have already been introduced in
Chap. 4, while transition matrix elements have accompanied us throughout the
whole course. In particular, they deﬁne the selection rules for optical transitions.
Therefore, Sect. 17.3 will start with the derivation of a speciﬁc selection rule rele-
vant in crystalline solids. Then, a heuristic approach to the dielectric function will
be provided that is based on the concept of the joint density of states.
The second approach, which starts from generalizing the dielectric function
of a system with discrete energy levels to the continuous case, will be topic of
Sect. 17.6. In both approaches, the behavior of the transition matrix elements will
be of utmost importance.
17.2
Physical Idea
Starting from the concepts listed in Sect. 17.1, we will have to complement them
by two further ideas that restrict the multiplicity of potentially possible quantum
transitions between two energy bands in a solid as sketched in Fig. 17.1 right on
top.
The ﬁrst point is that in a crystal, according to Chap. 16, energy bands are
deﬁned by dispersion laws E = E(k). The energy bands thus have an internal
structure that is not obvious from simple illustrations such as shown in Fig. 17.1.
The consequence is, that the relation beween the k-values in the band from where
the transition starts and the k-values that are allowed in the band where the
transition ends will be deﬁned by speciﬁc selection rules.

17.2
Physical Idea
429
The second point is that the occupation status of the energy bands involved in
quantum transitions is essential. This immediately follows from expression (12.26).
Moreover, once electrons are fermions, it is strongly forbidden that two electrons
appear in the same quantum state (compare 9.12a). Therefore, we have to assume
that any optical transition must start from a singly occupied state and must end in
an empty state. This is possible in two entirely different situations:
• Both the starting and ﬁnal energy levels are located in the same energy band.
In this case, we speak on intraband transitions.
• Both the starting and ﬁnal energy levels are located in different energy band. In
this case, we speak on interband transitions.
Then, transitions between completely occupied energy bands do not give any con-
tribution to optical absorption, while those between occupied and (partially) empty
bands do.
Let us assume the situation like shown in Fig. 17.2 on left. Here we have a com-
pletely ﬁlled highest occupied energy band (the valence band), and a completely
unoccupied next-higher energy band (the conduction band). Materials which such
a band structure at T = 0 K will be called dielectrics or semiconductors (in contrast
to conductors). Usually, in dielectrics we have Eg ≥3 eV, and in semiconductors
Eg < 3 eV. Light absorption between states of the valence and conduction bands
may occur when the photon energy is sufﬁciently large to bridge the energy gap Eg.

Introduction to Solid State Optics
Thus, optical absorption in such a solid appears as a process with a well-deﬁned
threshold frequency of the photon.
Figure 17.2 on right demonstrates the situation in a metal. In the conduction
band, intraband transitions are also expected to contribute to the optical behavior.
Obviously, there is no “threshold photon energy” necessary to initiate an intraband
transition. In fact, intraband transitions give rise to contributions to the dielectric
function which have their classical analogon in the Drude function (= response
of “free” electrons—see task 17.7.6). Interband transitions, instead, represent the
quantum mechanical counterpart of what we called the response of bound electrons
in the Lorentzian oscillator model.

17.3.1 Crystals: Direct Electronic Transitions
The k-Selection Rule
Let us start with deriving a general selection rule. From (16.10), we have the Bloch
function describing a single electron in a periodic potential:
ψk, j(r) = eikruk, j(r)
Let us now imagine a transition (by absorption of a photon) from the lth band
to the nth band. We emphasize that the regarded transition shall only change the
electronic state of the system without the excitation of vibrations of any of the
nuclei. Such transitions are called direct transitions. The corresponding electronic
wavefunctions are:
State l: ψkl,l(r) = eiklrukl,l(r).
State n: ψkn,n(r) = eiknrukn,n(r).
So we have the transition matrix element of the perturbation operator ˆV :

(17.1)
So the k-selection rule for direct transitions may be formulated as:
kl + kp = kn + g
(17.1a)
This approach is more or less reasonable as long as all k-vectors may be
regarded as real (weak absorption), and the integration extends over a sufﬁciently
large volume so that we may consider it as inﬁnitely large. Equation (17.1) is
an expression of the so-called k-selection rule and states, that in the case of
a direct transition in a crystal, the electrons wavevector in the ﬁnal state must
be equal to the sum of the corresponding vector in the initial state plus the
wavevector the absorbed photon had, and plus any arbitrary reciprocal lattice
vector (quasimomentum conservation).

, i.e., all k-vectors are restricted to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone),
the optical transitions in Fig. 17.3 are symbolized by vertical arrows. Therefore,
direct transitions are also called vertical transitions. As seen from Fig. 17.3, in the
reduced zone scheme we thus have:

Joint Density of States
Let us now come to a qualitative understanding of the shape of the dielectric func-
tion as caused by direct interband transitions according to the previous section. On
a rather intuitive level, it is clear that the imaginary part of the dielectric function
should be proportional to the rate of electronic transitions between the occupied
energy band l and the empty band n caused by photon absorption. According to
Fermi’s golden rule, we should then assume that the imaginary part of the dielec-
tric function is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element of the

reduced zone scheme, a is the lattice period
dipole operator, multiplied with the density of quantum states D which contribute
to the transition at the given transition frequency. We write:
Im ε ∝D(ωnl)|dnl|2
(17.2)
Note that once we have modeled the frequency dependence of the imaginary
part of the dielectric function, the real part is straightforwardly obtained by making
use of a Kramers–Kronig transformation according to (15.4b).
Remark Also, please note that the densities of states D = dZ/dE introduced so far
(see, e.g., 4.13) diverge for an inﬁnite volume. Therefore, in this chapter, densities of
states are always understood as as the number of states per energy interval per unit
volume. This is also consistent with the deﬁnition of the dielectric function, because
the latter provides information on the induced dipole moment per unit volume as
well.
Let us now concentrate on the case of direct transitions, so that the electron
wavevector practically does not change its value as a result of the quantum transi-
tion (compare 17.1b). Then, ωnl is given by the energy spacing between two bands
at the same wavevector kl ≈kn ≡k, and we obtain:
Im ε ∝D[En(k) −El(k)]|dnl(k)|2
(17.3)
In order to simplify the task, let us at the beginning assume that the transition
matrix element is constant and different from zero. In this case, the behavior of the

dielectric function is determined by the density of pairs of quantum states (i.e., the
number of such pairs of states per energy interval), which have the same wavevector
and are separated from each other by a given suitable energy spacing. We will call
this density of states a joint density of states, because it depends on features of
both energy bands that are participating in the quantum transition.
In many practical situations, the occupied energy band l is generally associated
with the valence band and the empty band n with the conduction band.
Let us have a closer look at the argument of the not yet quantitatively deﬁned
value D. For a band structure like shown in Fig. 17.3, the argument En(k) −
El(k) looks like it is sketched in Fig. 17.4. In semiconductor physics, the mini-
mal value of En(k) −El(k) is called the direct gap of the semiconductor, when
the two mentioned bands are associated with the valence and conductive bands,
respectively.
Let us ﬁrst imagine, that a system characterized by a En(k) −El(k) behavior as
given by Fig. 17.4 is illuminated with light of a sufﬁciently low frequency so that
èω < Eg is fulﬁlled. There will clearly be no absorption of light. A rather sharp
absorption onset is expected at èω = Eg, which corresponds to transitions in the
center of the Brillouin zone (k = 0). The reason for this sharp absorption onset
is, that at k = 0, the derivative d[En(k)−El(k)]
dk
= 0 as well. Consequently, a large
amount of pairs of quantum states with suitable energy spacing becomes involved
into the optical transition, which usually leads to prominent features in the optical
absorption spectrum. The same is valid for the k-values ±π/a.
We come to the conclusion, that the characteristic features in the imaginary
part of the dielectric function are determined by the behavior of the derivative
d[En(k)−El(k)]
dk
. Particularly, the points where this derivative is equal to zero, are
called critical points or van Hove singularities. Practically this means, that in a van
Hove singularity, the dispersion curves En(k) and El(k) are locally parallel to each
other in the k-space (Fig. 17.3). As a consequence, in a van Hove singularity, we
observe a huge amount of pairs of quantum states which are separated by identical
energy spacing. This results in characteristic features in the optical spectrum, when
the photon energy comes into resonance with that particular energy spacing. Thus,

434
17
Introduction to Solid State Optics
the prominent NIR feature in the reﬂection spectrum of aluminum in Fig. 14.7 on
left is caused by the joint effect of three different critical point interband transition
contributions (compare [2]).
Let us now write down a quantitative expression for the joint density of states.
The number of quantum states in a given k-interval is given by:
dZ ∝dkxdkydkz
In spherical coordinates (which makes sense in optically isotropic materials),
we ﬁnd:
3D : dkxdkydkz = 4πk2dk ⇒dZ ∝k2dk
=
k2
d[En(k)−El(k)]
dk
d[En(k) −El(k)]
(17.4)
The density of states D(k) is then given by: dZ ≡D(k)dk ⇒D(k) ∝k2.
In full analogy, the joint density of states D[En(k) −El(k)] will be deﬁned as:
dZ = D[En(k) −El(k)]d[En(k) −El(k)]
(17.5)
Comparing ﬁnally (17.4) and (17.5), we ﬁnd the expression:
D[En(k) −El(k)] ∝
k2
d[En(k)−El(k)]
dk
(17.6)
Expression (17.6) is obviously only valid in the three-dimensional case. It
really may show a singular behavior at the van Hove singularities. In general,
it is determined by the particular band structure valid for the material under
consideration.
Let us now regard the special situation sketched in Fig. 17.4. At k →0, we
obviously have:
En(k) −El(k) = Eg + const. ∗k2 = ℏω
Consequently,
k ∝
	
ℏω −Eg
and
d[En(k) −El(k)]
dk
∝k ∝
	
ℏω −Eg

17.3

435
We obtain from (17.6):
D[En(k) −El(k)] ∝
	
ℏω −Eg; ℏω > Eg
(17.7a)
which is valid in the three-dimensional case for light frequencies slightly above the
absorption edge. According to (17.3), we therefore have to expect that the shape of
the imaginary part of the dielectric function resembles the square root of èω – Eg.
The same type of discussion may be performed for the 2D and 1D cases. That
may be easily done by the reader himself. We ﬁnd (èω > Eg):
3D : d3k =dkxdkydkz →4πk2dk ⇒D[En(k) −El(k)] ∝
	
ℏω −Eg

Note the similarity to the expression found earlier in Sect. 4.6.1.
Wannier–Mott excitons
So far, our discussion has only concerned the optical response of a single electron,
propagating in a periodic potential. We will not deal with a many-electron theory
which allows considering the effects caused by the Coulomb interaction between
the electrons. But our knowledge obtained so far is sufﬁcient to account for one
additional effect which is most important in semiconductor optics: Imagine the
situation sketched in Fig. 17.3. An electron (negatively charged) that is excited
from the lth (the valence) band to the nth (the conduction) band is well-known
to leave a (positively charged) hole in the valence band. In their respective bands,
both the suddenly created conduction electron and the hole are expected to move
with a group velocity determined by the ﬁrst derivative of the band energy with
respect to the wavevector. In the general case, these velocities are different, so that
the electron and the hole are immediately separated from each other. However, for
example at k = 0, the group velocities are identical (=0), so that the electron and
the hole remain spatially close to each other and form a new quasiparticle, a Wan-
nier–Mott exciton. Similar to a hydrogen atom, such an exciton has Rydberg-like
energy levels, which contribute to the optical absorption behavior of the semicon-
ductor. As a consequence, there may appear sharp absorption lines in the region of
the absorption edge, corresponding to the excitation of different excitonic energy
levels, as exempliﬁed in Fig. 17.5.
Let us apply our knowledge on the hydrogen atom for estimating typical radii
and binding energies of a Wannier–Mott exciton [1, Chap. 4]. In the hydrogen
atom, we have (8.8), (8.10):
Bohr’s radius: a0 = 4πε0

In a Wannier–Mott exciton, the situation is somewhat different from the hydro-
gen atom. The reduced mass of a Wannier–Mott exciton is calculated from the
effective masses of the electron and the hole. Assuming the conditions shown in
Fig. 17.3 at k = 0, an electron (e) at the bottom of the conduction band n has a
positive effective mass m*e,n > 0, while on top of the valence band l, the electron
has a negative effective mass m*e,l < 0. The hole (h) in band l has an effective
mass opposite to that of the electron, hence m*h,l = -m*e,l > 0 (see remark below).
The reduced mass of the Wannier–Mott exciton is then given by:
μW−M =
m∗
e,nm∗
h,l
m∗e,n + m∗
h,l
Replacing further ε0 →εstatε0, we ﬁnd for the Wannier–Mott exciton:
a0,W−M = μεstat
μW−M
a0 ≈101 nm
RyW−M = μW−M
με2
stat
Rya0 ≈10−3 . . . 10−2eV
Hence, the binding energy of the Wannier–Mott exciton is much smaller than
that in the hydrogen atom, while its ground-state radius is much larger than in a
hydrogen atom.

17.3
Theoretical Material
437
As a consequence of the formation of the exciton, at k = 0, we have the
modiﬁed resonance condition for light absorption:
ℏω = Eg + Eexciton = Eg −RyW−M
n2
; n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
which explains the additional absorption features at photon energies below the
gap value Eg. Of course, an absorption spectrum like exempliﬁed in Fig. 17.5 is
observed only at very low temperatures, where the exciton is stable.
Remark Consider the constellation shown in Fig. 17.3. near the center of the Bril-
louin zone. When an electron–hole pair is generated by absorption of light, the
effective mass of the electron in the conduction band is positive. An electric ﬁeld
would induce certain acceleration, i.e., a change in the electrons group velocity. The
hole is positively charged and should therefore feel a force into the opposite direction.
Therefore, its acceleration should have the opposite sign of that of the conduction
electron.
On the other hand, from (16.24) we have: dvgr
dt
=
F
m∗. A change in the sign of F
will lead to a change in the sign of the acceleration only if the sign of the effective
mass is the same in both situations. Therefore, the effective mass of a hole in the
valence band must have the same sign as the effective mass of the electron in the
conduction band.
17.3.2 Crystals: Phonons
Let us now turn to the discussion of lattice vibrations, i.e., the oscillatory move-
ment of atomic nuclei. According to our knowledge from molecule dynamics,
we will expect that the corresponding eigenfrequencies correspond to the middle
infrared (MIR) spectral range.
Let us discuss a simple classical model case of a crystal with two atoms in the
primitive cell. We will use the following symbols (s is a counting index) (Table
17.1).
Figure 17.6 illustrates the model situation we a rediscussing now.

(17.8)
We will search the solution as:
us = ueiskphononae−iωt
vs = veiskphononae−iωt
(17.9)
The mentioned solutions are obviously delocalized in space. Such kind of lattice
vibrations are called phonons. Here, kphonon is the absolute value of the wavevector
of the phonon, a—the lattice period along the propagation direction of the phonon,
and u,v—corresponding oscillation amplitudes.

quasimomentum.

In order to discuss the physical sense of the two different phonon modes, let
us look at the particular case kphonon →0 (zone-center phonons). For the optical
mode, we have:
ω2
opt →2κ
μ
According to (17.11), we ﬁnd:

Hence, in the optical mode, the two different atoms oscillate in antiphase. The
acoustic mode yields:
ω2
acoust →0
And thus:
−ω2m1u = 2κv −2κu →0 = 2κv −2κu ⇒u = v
In the acoustic mode, the atoms oscillate in-phase.
If the atoms have different electric charges, in the optical mode, strong oscil-
lating electric dipols are generated, which strongly interact with electromagnetic
radiation and cause IR-active lattice vibrations. The reason is that the positive and
negative charges move into opposite directions. In the acoustic mode, induced
dipole moments are practically negligible, because the positive and negative
charges move into the same direction.
So far, we have not yet speciﬁed our “spring constant” κ.
As mentioned in Sect. 12.1, solids—and thus crystals—have two independent
elastic moduli—a bulk modulus and a shear modulus. Correspondingly, we ﬁnd
longitudinal and transversal phonon modes in a solid. The terminology is (Table
17.2):
Note that if you have a number of X atoms in the primitive cell, you ﬁnd
• 3 acoustic modes (1 LA-mode, 2 TA-modes)
• 3X -3 optical modes (X -1 LO-modes, 2X-2 TO-modes)

minology introduced in Sect. 17.3.1. Indeed, in this point, the denominator in the
above-written expression becomes zero.
Let us now have a look at the interaction of such a phonon oscillation with
an electromagnetic ﬁeld. Imagine an electromagnetic wave propagating along the
z-axis. When restricting on the Coulomb force, instead of (17.8), we now have:
m1 ¨us = κ(vs −us) + κ(vs−1 −us) + qE0e−i(ωt−kpz)

a = ei(kp+g)a
(n- any integer number). From here we conclude, that for the case of optical exci-
tation of phonons by absorption of light, the k-selection rule (compare 17.1a) may
be written as:
kphonon = kp + g
(17.12)
Thus, because kp ≪π
a , only zone-center optical phonons may be excited by
absorption of infrared electromagnetic radiation (one-phonon processes presumed;
i.e., the absorption of one photon leads to the generation of one phonon only).
Note ﬁnally, that in a material with two atoms in the primitive unit cell, the
atoms do not need to be of different type. Thus, in the diamond lattice, X =
2. Both these atoms are carbon atoms, and their displacement with respect to
each other does not create any electric dipole moment. Therefore, the diamonds
zone-center optical phonon is IR-inactive. On the other hand, the optical phonon
oscillation leads to a modulation of the volume of the primitive unit cell, and
thus to a modulation of the corresponding polarizability. The zone-center optical
phonon is therefore Raman-active, and the position and width of the observed
Raman line is used in practice to judge the quality of synthetic diamond materials
(Fig. 17.8).
The fact that the zone-center optical phonon in diamond is IR-inactive but
Raman-active again reﬂects the validity of the rule of mutual exclusion (the
diamond lattice is centrosymmetric).
Let us ﬁnish this section by returning to the polariton dispersion law discussed
earlier in Sect. 14.6.1. Apart from resonance, from (14.14) we ﬁnd:

Note that ε →0 ⇔ω →ω(k ≈0).
In order to understand the physical sense of this particular frequency, we
must remember the Maxwell equation: divD = 0 = ε0ε(ω)divE. Provided that
ε(ω) ̸= 0, from here it follows that divE = 0, which is characteristic for transver-
sal phonons, because the latter do not produce volume charge densities. However,
if ε(ω) = 0, divE may be different from zero, which is characteristic for longitu-
dinal optical phonons, because the latter may create a volume charge density that
is different from zero. Therefore, ω(k ≈0) has to be associated with the angular
frequency of longitudinal phonons ωL. That leads us to the more familiar writing:
ε(ω) ≈ε∞

center phonon frequencies are fT O ≈12.05T Hz; fLO ≈21.52T Hz [3]. On the
other hand, εstat ≈9.83; ε∞≈2.944. When substituting into (17.13a), a good
agreement is observed.
On the other hand, in diamond we have νT O = νLO ≈1333 cm−1 (compare
also Fig. 17.8). This is a consequence of the already mentioned infrared inactivity
of the transversal optical phonon in the diamond crystal. Indeed, from (14.15)

17.3.3 Crystals: Indirect Transitions
So far, in Sect. 17.3.1, we have considered direct electronic transitions. Addition-
ally, in the previous Sect. 17.3.2, lattice vibrations have been discussed. Let us
now regard a situation, where the absorption of a photon leads to the instanta-
neous excitation of both electronic and phonon states in a crystal. These so-called
indirect transitions are particularly important in so-called indirect semiconductors.
In semiconductor practice, it appears that many of the semiconductors belong
to the class of indirect semiconductors. In an indirect semiconductor, indirect
interband transitions between the valence and the conduction bands may occur at
photon energies which are smaller than the direct gap considered in Sect. 17.3.1.
In other words, a semiconductor is indirect, when the condition:
indirect gap Eg,ind ≡min[En(kn) −El(kl)]|kn̸=kl < min[En(kn) −El(kl)]|kn=kl

Let us now look how the shape of the absorption edge at an indirect gap looks
like.
The main difference to the previously discussed case of direct transitions is in
the violation of electron quasimomentum conservation. Indeed, when the absorp-
tion of light is accompanied by the generation (or annihilation) of one or several
phonons, the electron wavevectors in the initial and ﬁnal states may signiﬁcantly
differ from each other. When neglecting the light wavevector, the total (electron
+ phonon) quasimomentum conservation is obtained as a merger of (17.1a) and
(17.12) according to:

Additionally, energy conservation leads to:

Here, the sign “+” corresponds to phonon annihilation, while “−” denotes
phonon creation. Due to the violation of electron quasimomentum conservation,
the joint density of states is no more signiﬁcant for the quantitative description of
the absorption process. Instead, it is reasonable to consider the convolution of the
densities of the initial and ﬁnal quantum states, regardless on the quasimomentum.
Hence, instead of (17.3), we make use of:

where D is the usual density of states in the corresponding band as indicated by
index in (17.14). Again, near the extremal values of the E(k) dependence as shown
in Fig. 17.10, the energy behaves proportional to the square of the wavevector. In
analogy to the treatment in Sect. 17.3.1, we suppose for the 3D case:

Here we have assumed, that the top of the valence band in Fig. 17.10 corre-
sponds to E = 0. The choice of the integration limits should become clear from
the illustration in Fig. 17.10 on right.
We do not need to calculate this integral exactly. The only thing we want

We see, that (17.15) is different from the expressions (17.7a) and (17.7b), the
latter being valid for the direct transitions.
With this, we ﬁnish the the discussion of basic optical processes in crystalline
matter. Before turning to another important class of solids in the next subchap-
ter, namely amorphous solids, let us shortly resume what we have learned about
crystalline solids and their optics so far.

The main point is, that instead of atomic or molecular energy levels, in solid-
state physics we deal with energy bands. In crystal physics, these energy bands are
described by an E(k)-dependence. As in molecules, an electronic excitation may
be accompanied by excitation of vibrational degrees of freedom, which gives rise
to the division of optical transitions in a crystal into direct and indirect transitions.
Both types of transitions differ from each other in their energy balance and the
shape of the absorption structure near the absorption onset. In this context, Table
17.3 summarizes the types of power-law dependencies, derived in this chapter
for describing the spectral behavior of the imaginary part of the crystal dielectric
function in the region of the absorption edge (interband transitions).
17.3.4 Amorphous Solids
Let us now come to another kind of solids, namely amorphous solids. As it has
already been discussed, amorphous solids lack long-range order in the atomic
arrangement (which is characteristic for crystals), while short-range order is
present. Optical glasses are prominent examples for the application of amorphous
solids as optical materials. An amorphous solid therefore resembles some of the
properties of its crystalline counterpart (namely those which are determined by the
short-range order), while the properties basing on the long-range order will not be
observed in amorphous solids.
In an amorphous solid, the interatomic distances are comparable to those in
a crystal. Therefore, the spatial overlap of the atomic electronic wavefunctions
gives rise to the formation of broad energy regions with allowed electron energy
values, similar as in a crystal. On the other hand, the absence of translational
invariance in the atomic arrangement does not allow us to use Bloch’s theorem for
the description of the electronic wavefunctions. This has several consequences:
• Although there are broad regions of allowed electron energy values, there is no
E(k)-dependence as in crystals. Nevertheless it is common to speak on energy
bands in amorphous semiconductor theory.
• In addition to the delocalised electronic states characteristic for a periodic
potential, there may be localized electronic quantum states as well (Anderson
localization). They may deeply extend into the forbidden zone and form what
is called the energy band tails.
• There is no quasimomentum conservation in optical transitions.

448
17
Introduction to Solid State Optics
• There is no joint density of states.
Even if we cannot deﬁne a joint density of states, we may introduce a conventional
density of states deﬁning (as usual):
dZ ≡D(E)dE
where dZ again is again the full number of quantum states in the given E-interval
(here per unit volume).
Figure 17.11 illustrates the differences between the density of electronic states
as observed in a crystal and its amorphous counterpart.
When looking at Fig. 17.11 on top, it again becomes clear that our gap Eg has
a clear physical meaning in the case of a crystalline solid. It is identical to the
energy width of the forbidden zone, i.e., an energy interval where the density of

Fig.17.12 Model shape of the density of states D(E) in an amorphous semiconductor
states is zero. It appears as a parameter in dispersion dependencies like (17.7a)
or (17.15) and is therefore also called the “optical gap.” But how to deﬁne an
“optical gap” in an amorphous semiconductor, as represented by the density of
states dependence in Fig. 17.11 on bottom?
In amorphous semiconductor physics, there exist several models to describe the
density of states in the region of the valence and conduction bands. Consequently,
different deﬁnitions of optical gaps may be provided. We will focus here on a very
simpliﬁed model dependence proposed by Davis and Mott [6]. It is illustrated in
Fig. 17.12.
Figure 17.12 shows an example of the density of states in the vicinity of the
energy gap between the valence and conduction bands. Note the qualitative sim-
ilarity to the dependence visualized in Fig. 17.12 on bottom. It is characteristic,
that in the vicinity of the band edges EA and EB, the electronic states are spatially
localized (gray regions in Fig. 17.12). An electron in such a localized quantum
state has only a small mobility, so that EC and EV are called mobility edges, while
the value of EC-EV marks the so-called mobility gap. It is utmost important for
the description of electrical properties of an amorphous semiconductor.
Concerning the optical properties (particularly the absorption of light), in a
system like shown in Fig. 17.12, we have to distinguish two entirely different
cases:
1. Both the initial and ﬁnal states of the quantum transition are spatially localized.
2. At least one of the participating quantum states is delocalised.
In order to obtain nonvanishing transition matrix elements, it is necessary that the
wavefunctions of the initial and ﬁnal quantum states are spatially overlapping. This
is automatically fulﬁlled for quantum transitions which involve delocalised states.

450
17
Introduction to Solid State Optics
However, for localized quantum states, this requirement may make a quantum
transition impossible even if the energy spacing between the states is suitable.
One should therefore expect that the transitions, which involve delocalised
quantum states, give more intense contributions to the full absorption spectrum
than the transitions between localized states.
Because of the absence of electronic quasimomentum conservation, the calcu-
lation of the imaginary part of the dielectric function in an amorphous material
follows the philosophy from Sect. 17.3.3 (indirect transition). Practically, we will
apply (17.14) again.
Let us now come to the system illustrated In Fig. 17.12. Let us assume, that
in the band tails (the gray regions in Fig. 17.12, which symbolize the localized
states), the density of states changes linearly with energy. For example, regarding
the band tail of the valence band and setting EB = 0 now, we have:
DV (E) ∝−E
Which is valid in the valence band tail. On the other hand, we postulate that
the conduction band is structureless:
DC(E) ∝θ(E −EC) ⇒DC(E + ℏω) ∝θ(E + ℏω −EC) = θ(E −(EC −ℏω))
Let us now consider transitions from the valence band tail into the conduction
band. Neglecting transitions between localized states, we ﬁnd:
Im ε ∝|dnl|2
 0
EC−ℏω
DV (E) DC(E + ℏω)



∝θ(E−(EC−ℏω))

EC−ℏω
DV (E)dE
∝|dnl|2
 0
EC−ℏω
EdE ∝|dnl|2(ℏω −EC)2
(17.16)
Here, the integration limits correspond to those in (17.14), of course without any
phonon contributions. Consequently, we obtain exactly the same type of frequency
dependence as in (17.15) although the latter was obtained assuming “parabolic”
band edges. The physical sense of the optical gap in (17.16) is different from that
in (17.15), it is now identical to (EC-EB). We may include transitions from the
valence band into the conduction band tail as well, and in this case, the observed
optical gap will correspond to the lower value of (EC −EB) and (EA −EV).
This way we found a deﬁnition of an “optical gap” in an amorphous semicon-
ductor as:
Eg,opt = min{(EC −EB); (E A −EV )}

17.3
Theoretical Material
451
This deﬁnition is clearly related to the assumed density of states picture and
must be modiﬁed when other shapes D(E) are assumed. Note further that the
optical gap turns out to be smaller than the mobility gap deﬁned as:
Eg,mob = (EC −EV )
What about the matrix element in (17.16)? Again, different approaches are in
use. The simplest possibility is to assume that the matrix element |dCV |2 = const.
We then ﬁnd:
Im ε = 2nK ∝

ℏω −Eg,opt

(17.16a)
This convenient expression relates the absorption coefﬁcient to the optical gap;
hence, the gap may be determined from experimental absorption coefﬁcient data,
ﬁtting the data by means of (17.16a). Usually, the refractive index n is assumed to
be constant. The thus determined optical gap is called the Cody gap. It is connected
to the requirement of a constant transition matrix element of the dipole operator
for transition between states in the valence and conduction bands.
A somewhat modiﬁed dependence is obtained, when the matrix element of
the momentum operator is supposed to be constant. We must then require, that
|dCV |2ω2 = const., and instead of (17.16a) we then ﬁnd:
Im ε = 2nK ∝

(17.16b)
The thus deﬁned optical gap is called the Tauc gap. It is conveniently deter-
mined from the so-called Tauc plot, where √α(ω)ω is plotted against the photon
energy. The Tauc gap is often applied in practice to characterize the optical
properties of amorphous materials.
Bearing in mind the obvious ambiguity in the interpretation(s) of the optical
gap(s) in amorphous materials, let us conclude that the optical gaps deﬁned in
this section are nothing else than ﬁtting parameters in dependences like (17.16a)
and (17.16b). This is a difference to the deﬁnition of forbidden zones as it is
possible in the case of crystals, where the existence of energy gaps is a direct
conclusion from the E(k)-dependence. On the contrary, in an amorphous solid
it is quite possible that even in the “forbidden” zone in Fig. 17.11, there exist
localized states with a density of states different from zero. For that reason, the
terminus “optical gap” is not well-deﬁned for amorphous semiconductors. On the
other hand, the introduction of the optical gap by a dependence like (17.16b) gives
at least a recipe for the unambiguous and convenient determination of a parameter
that may be used to judge the quality of a prepared material with respect to certain
optical applications. For that reason, these parameters are widely used in applied
semiconductor optics. A bit more detail will be provided in Sect. 17.5.1.

17.3.5 Dielectric Function of a Crystal: Contributions of Direct
Electronic Transitions
Let us ﬁnally return to the crystalline case and write down an expression for the
dielectric function of a crystal involving direct transitions. This appears to be a
special case of the general expressions found in Sect. 12.6 (12.26). From there we
have:

As we have pointed out in Chap. 16, a single-electron propagating in a peri-
odic potential (single-electron approximation) has a continuous spectrum of energy
eigenvalues instead of the discrete energy levels ﬁxed in (12.26). Regions of “al-
lowed” energy values (energy bands) appear to be separated from each other by
“forbidden” energy zones. In each energy band, the electron energy is a continuous
function of the wavevector of the electron k. The general theoretical considera-
tions given below are applicable to direct electronic transitions in different kinds
of crystals, no matter whether they represent insulators, semiconductors, or metals.
Nevertheless, we will often use a terminology which stems from the ﬁeld of semi-
conductors. The reason is simple. The electronic transitions which are detected
in optical spectroscopy do usually occur between the valence and the conduction
bands of a crystal. Good insulators usually have a broad energy spacing between
these bands, so that they may be regarded as transparent in the NIR/VIS regions.
On the contrary, the absorption onset wavelength in semiconductors is consider-
ably larger, so that the shape of the absorption bands has to be taken into account
when performing optical spectroscopy with semiconductors. Therefore, in many
cases we will apply a terminology which is usually relevant in semiconductor
optics with regard to transitions between the valence and the conduction bands.
Caused by the mentioned band structure, we cannot further work with discrete
energy levels En as assumed when having derived (12.26), but have to replace
them by the functions En(kn):
En →En(kn)
The quantum number n is now to count the energy bands instead of the energy
levels. Accordingly, the transition frequencies have to be replaced according to:
ωnl = En −El
ℏ
→En(kn) −El(kl)
ℏ
Thus, absorption of light may cause an electron from the lth energy band and
with an initial wavevector kl to perform a quantum transition into the nth energy
band. In general, its wavevector may also change to kn due to quasimomentum
conservation. As long as l ̸=n holds, we deal with interband transitions.

17.3
Theoretical Material
453
In the case of the direct interband transitions, we have (compare Sect. 17.3.1)
kl ≈kn ≡k ⇒En(kn) −El(kl)
ℏ
= En(k) −El(k)
ℏ
≡ωnl(k).
Similar to the transition frequencies, the other values encountering into (12.26)
are now also dependent on the electrons wavevector, although the dependence
may be weak. Let us further recall, that the electron wavefunctions in a periodic
potential are delocalized. Then, the propagating electron may rather feel the aver-
age electric ﬁeld than the local one. In such cases, a treatment in terms of the
Lorentz–Lorenz formula does not make sense. We therefore assume:
ε = 1 + Nβ
Now, the wavevector k has to be regarded as one of the quantum numbers
relevant in (12.26). Let us assume that N may be associated with the concentra-
tion of electrons. Moreover, due to Pauli’s principle, any quantum state can only
be occupied by a single electron. Summarizing over all occupied quantum states
does therefore automatically sum up over the electrons. According to (12.7), their
individual contributions to the full polarization sum up according to: P =


Instead of (14.7), we therefore obtain:


n>l
[Wl(k) −Wn(k)]|dnl(k)|2ωnl(k)
ω2
nl(k) −ω2 −2iωγnl(k)
(17.17)
Remark Electrons are fermions and obey the Fermi–Dirac statistics. Note that for the
Fermi–Dirac statistics, the occupation probability of a given quantum state coincides
with the average occupation of the state [7]. The W-values therefore may now be
interpreted as the average occupation of the corresponding quantum states, as given
by the Fermi–Dirac distribution. The indices l and n count the energy bands.
Exactly the same result is obtained in terms of an alternative approach. Imagine
a polarizing piece of matter that is large enough such that long-range atomic order
is observed. Then its polarizability according to (12.26) must include summation
over the “quantum number” k, such that instead of (12.26) we may write:
β(ω) =

k

l

n>l
[Wl(k) −Wn(k)]|dnl(k)|2ωnl(k)
ω2
nl(k) −ω2 −2iωγnl(k)
Then, from ε = 1 + Nβ setting N = 1/V we immediately obtain (17.17) again,
when V is associated with the volume of exactly that peace of crystalline matter.
Remark In a strong sense, in addition to summation over k, summation over g must
also be included into expressions like (17.17). We did not explicitly write it down

454
17
Introduction to Solid State Optics
because ω2
nl(k) and Wn(k) are independent on g. However, the square of the absolute
value of the transition matrix element |dnl(k)|2 in fact has to be understood as the
result of summation over all g vectors 
g |⟨k + g, n|d|k,l⟩|2, because according to
the k-selection rule (17.1a), all these individual transitions may be allowed.
Once k should be tackled as a continuous variable, it is reasonable in (17.17)
replacing the sum over k by the corresponding integral. When remembering
Sect. 4.6.1 and, in particular, (4.11) and (4.12), we have:
k = π

Equation (17.17b) represents the expression for the electronic contribution to
the dielectric function of a crystal at sufﬁciently low temperatures, as long as only
direct transitions are involved.
In solid-state physics, it is common to express transition probabilities in terms
of the transition matrix element of the electron momentum operator rather than of
the dipole moment operator (as we do). In this case, (17.17–17.17b) hold as well
by structure, but there is an additional pre-factor of [e/(meω)]2.

17.4
Consistency Considerations
In Sects. 17.3.1 and 17.3.5, we have derived two alternative approaches for calcu-
lating the dispersion of the dielectric function of a crystal. It is of course necessary
to clarify in how far these two approached yield consistent results. Let us therefore
look at an example in order to get an idea on the shape of the dielectric function
as described by (17.17c).
Let us regard the contribution of an interband transition between the valence
and conduction bands to the dielectric function. In a band scheme like sketched in
Fig. 17.4 (and assuming isotropy), the resonance frequency might then be given
by (compare also 16.22):
ωCV(k) = 1
ℏ
 
Eg + B
2 (1 −cos ka)
!
(17.18)
where Eg marks the direct band gap, and B again is a constant that characterizes the
energy band width. This way (17.17c) contains information about the bandwidth
as well as about the homogeneous linewidth γ of any of the individual transitions
entering into (17.7a). Hence, the approach presented in Sect. 17.3.5 seems to be
the more general one, and the results of Sect. 17.3.1 (17.7b) should be obtainable
as a particular case of (17.17c). This is what we want to exemplify in this section.
In order to preserve consistency with Sect. 17.3.1, let us again neglect the k-
dependence of the transition matric element, as well as of all the other parameters
encountering into (17.17c) except the transition frequency which is set according
to (17.18). Then, the contribution of the V→C transition to the dielectric function
of the system may be directly calculated performing a numerical integration in
(17.17c). It is interesting to perform this calculation with different assumed values
of the bandwidth B and the homogeneous linewidth γ.
What could be expected from such a model calculation? Provided that we have
B<<ℏγ , from (17.18) we might expect ωCV(k) ≈1
ℏEg = const., and in this case,
(17.17c) should yield a single Lorentzian line. In the opposite case B>>ℏγ , from
(17.17c) we should expect an output similar to (17.7a) at least for photon energies
close to the gap value, because in deriving (17.7a) only a dependence like (17.18)
has been taken into consideration, and any homogeneous linewidth was neglected.
Let us now look at the calculation results given in Fig. 17.13. In the case that
B<<ℏγ , the band structure does not give any effect, and the imaginary part of the

dielectric function appears as a typical Lorentzian line as known from the classi-
cal picture or the quantum mechanical treatment of systems with discrete energy
levels. On the contrary, when the homogeneous linewidth is negligible compared
to the bandwidth B, the imaginary part of the dielectric function shows a sharp
onset at èω = Eg, which is therefore also called the (fundamental) absorption
edge energy. Consequently, optical measurements may be used to determine the
direct band gap in crystalline solids by means of the absorption behavior (if the
transition is allowed). For èω > Eg, the imaginary part of the dielectric function
indeed increases with frequency similar to:
Im ε ∝
	
ℏω −Eg
This behavior is typical for allowed electronic transitions in the vicinity of a
direct band gap, and it coincides with the results obtained in Sect. 17.3.1.
On the other hand, it is interesting to check the behavior of the dielectric
function depending on the dimensionality of the system. Figure 17.13 clearly cor-
responds to the three-dimensional case (3D) and has been calculated in spherical
coordinates according to the upper relation in (17.7b). The same calculation may
be carried out for assuming 2D and 1D cases in (17.17c). Figure 17.14 illustrates
the shapes of the imaginary parts of the thus given dielectric functions in the
vicinity of the absorption edge.
It is obvious, that the dependence Im ε ∝
ℏω −Eg is only valid for the
three-dimensional case. In the two-dimensional case (compare Sect. 4.6.1), we
rather ﬁnd Im ε∝const, while in the the one-dimensional case a behavior similar
to Im ε ∝
1
√
ℏω−Eg is observed. This is in full consistency to the predictions
(17.7b) derived in terms of the joint density of states concept.
The mentioned behavior of the dielectric function for a two-dimensional motion
of an electron in a periodic potential is essential for the theory of so-called
quantum well structures or superlattices. The one-dimensional case is practically
relevant in so-called quantum wires. Particularly, the singularity at the direct

gap is of practical importance to achieve a high oscillator strength necessary for

Again, the sharp absorption onset obvious from Fig. 17.14 is characteristic to
crystalline materials and conﬁrms us about the well-deﬁned value of optical gaps
in crystalline materials. In amorphous materials, in agreement with Fig. 17.11,
those absorption features should smear out, leaving some freedom in ascribing a
physical sense to what we call an optical gap in an amorphous solid. Strongly
spoken, certain optical gap versions may simply be tackled as ﬁtting parameters in
dependencies like (17.16a) or (17.16b). Nevertheless, as suggested by Fig. 17.11,
all those gaps might be close by numerical value to their crystalline counterparts.
Section 17.5.1 will be used to oppose certain possible gap deﬁnitions in amorphous
solids to each other while using amorphous silicon as a practical example.
What about highest laser light intensities? Everybody knows that intense laser
radiation may destroy solid materials, which is in the basis of many industrial
applications of high power lasers today. So far we have not yet spoken on such
effects. Let us mention in this context that light–matter interactions may principally
subdivided into destructive (Fig. 17.15) and nondestructive versions. This course
is on nondestructive interactions only, and any effects concerned to laser damage
are outside the scope of this book.
But even when restricting on nondestructive interaction mechanisms, the picture
developed so far is far from being complete. Let us return to (12.2):

But obviously, this description is insufﬁcient when the ﬁeld strength becomes too
large. Then, completely new optical phenomena have to be expected that arise
from the nonlinear terms in (12.2). Those phenomena form the ﬁeld on nonlinear
optics. Chapter 18 will be devoted to an introduction into this ﬁeld.

17.5.1 Optical Properties of Amorphous Semiconductors:
Parameters for a Practical Description
The rather vague assignment of what we call the optical gap of an amorphous solid
to a concrete physical counterpart has resulted in a certain diversity of optical gap
deﬁnitions that are convenient in a certain practical context. Let us have a look at
Fig. 17.16 on left.
It shows the typical dispersion behavior of the optical constants of a nonmetal-
lic solid material in a rather broad spectral range. Typically, we observe certain
absorption in the MIR that is caused by core vibrations. Usually, in the NIR region
we have some transparency window, where K is close to zero, while the refractive
index n may be modeled in terms of Sellmeier or Cauchy approaches according
to (14.9b–d). At even shorter wavelength, i.e., in the VIS or UV, we observe the
onset of light absorption because of the optical excitation of valence electrons. It

is the thereshold photon energy of these electronic absorptions that is of excep-
tional importance for practical applications of the material in optics. This threshold
energy is what is usually called the fundamental absorption edge, and it is of course
related to the optical gap, no matter which particular gap deﬁnition is applied.
The most pragmatic deﬁnitions of optical gaps indeed make use of that thresh-
old idea. Thus, the so-called E03 and E04 gaps are deﬁned a the photon energies
where the absorption coefﬁcient in the fundamental absorption edge region reaches
the values 103 cm−1 or 104 cm−1, respectively (see Fig. 17.16 on right).

(17.19)
In other approaches, the optical gap rather appears as a ﬁtting parameter when
ﬁtting the measured absorption coefﬁcient in terms of approaches like (17.16–
17.16b). This way we deﬁne gaps like the Cody or Tauc gaps. Note also that the
earlier introduced β_do model (14.11) deﬁnes an optical gap as (compare also
Fig. 14.9)
Eg,β_do = ℏωa = hcνa
Note that the Cody approach (17.16a):

Introduction to Solid State Optics
Figure 17.16 on right vizualises the relation between those different gap deﬁ-
nitions. The Cody and Tauc gaps are usually ﬁtted in spectral regions where the
absorption coefﬁcient is larger than 104 cm−1, and therefore, as a rule we have:
Eg,Tauc, Eg,Cody < E04
(17.20)
In ﬁnishing this section, in Table17.4 we present some experimental data on
optical gaps of (hydrogenated) amorphous silicon a-Si(:H), taken from reference
[8]. The idea is to demonstrate the relation between different optical gaps, but
also the dynamic range of optical properties of amorphous semiconductors. The
latter thus appear as rather versatile materials, and in certain limits, their optical
properties may be tailored by suitably adopting the preparation procedure.
Figure 17.17 demonstrates the a-Si(:H) Tauc gaps as depending on the mass
density. Also, the reference value for c-Si is included. Note that the experimental
data show a clear trend toward smaller gaps when the density is increased and
thus well reproduce the qualitative behavior as expected from the discussion in
Sect. 16.4. Concerning refractive indices, so they also increase with increasing
mass density for the amorphous samples (as it was expected, too). They even
fall higher than the crystalline value, which is attributed to additional internal
surface states generated by subnanometer-sized voids in the amorphous atomic
network [9, 10]. They should be absent in the crystal, which explains the seemingly
inconsistent picture.

17.5.2 The Tauc–Lorentz Model
The Tauc–Lorentz model has been developed for convenient parametrization of
the optical constants of amorphous materials in the interband absorption region.
Let us start from the single Lorentzian oscillator model setting:
χ ∝
1
ω2
0 −ω2 −2iωγ ⇒Im ε = Im χ ∝
ωγ

ω2
0 −ω22 + 4ω2γ 2
In the Tauc–Lorentz model, the imaginary part of the dielectric function of a
single oscillator model is merged together with (17.16b) to generate the imaginary
part of the dielectric function of the Tauc–Lorentz model according to [11]:
Im ε(ω)

⎩

(ℏω−Eg,opt)2
ω
%
ω2
0−ω22+4ω2γ 2
&; ℏω ≥Eg,opt
= 0; ℏω < Eg,opt
(17.21)
The corresponding real part is calculated through (15.4b). Explicit expressions
can be found, for example, in [12, 13]. A comparison of the spectral shape of a
Lorentzian line according to (2.14a) and the spectral feature described by (17.21)
is presented in Fig. 17.18. Note that (17.21) is an odd function with respect to the
frequency as required by (15.3).
In contrast to the single Lorentzian oscillator model or the Brendel model
(14.10), the Tauc–Lorentz model is able to describe strongly asymmetric absorp-
tion features. In particular, it allows modeling absorption thresholds. With a total of
only four free parameters it is a convenient and often used tool for modeling optical
constants in the vicinity of absorption edges in amorphous optical materials.

Advanced Material: Spatial Dispersion of the Dielectric
Function
Let us for completeness extend our discussion to another phenomenon called spa-
tial dispersion. In our discussion of dispersion as provided so far we have assumed
that the polarizing system embodies some kind of memory, i.e., the polarization
of the medium at time t depends on the ﬁeld at that time as well as on the ﬁeld at
previous moments. As a natural conclusion, we found that the dielectric function,
which describes the system response to a monochromatic ﬁeld in the frequency
domain, must necessarily be frequency dependent, a phenomenon which we have
called dispersion. Moreover, from the examples discussed so far it appears obvi-
ous that strongest dispersion is observed when the periodic time of the electric
ﬁeld (from the electromagnetic wave) comes close to a characteristic intrinsic time
of the medium, such as the Debye relaxation time or an eigenvibration period
(resonance).
On the other hand, there are speciﬁc optical phenomena observed when the
wavelength of the light becomes comparable to characteristic spatial dimensions
of the medium. We do not mean inhomogeneities here, we still focus on opti-
cally homogeneous materials. But even in a homogeneous medium it is absolutely
possible, that the polarization in a certain point r depends on the electric ﬁeld
strength in some spatial vicinity of that point. In the case that the dimensions of
that “active” area become comparable with the wavelength of the light, we obtain
phenomena concerned with what we will further call spatial dispersion.
Let us return to material equations like (13.4) and (13.5). They deﬁne the polar-
ization at time t as a functional of the electric ﬁeld at various previous times t′
< t. But this is clearly not the most general writing. We obtain a more general
version of this type of equation when allowing that the polarization in a certain
point r depends on the electric ﬁeld strength in neighboring points r′. This is what
is sometimes called nonlocality of the system response. Then, instead of (13.4),

17.6

we may write:
P(r, t) = ε0
 t
−∞

V
κ(t, t′, r, r′)E(r′, t′)dt′dr′
(17.22)
Again, κ carries information about the material speciﬁcs, including the previ-
ously discussed “memory” of the system. At the same time, it now incorparates
information on how far the electric ﬁeld in neighboring points r′ affects the polar-
ization at point r. The integration over r′ is formally carried out in the full volume
V where κ is different from zero.
We further proceed in the usual manner. Introducing homogeneity in time, we
postulate that κ does not depend on t and t′ explicitly, but only on their difference
(retardation) ξ according to:
ξ = t −t′
In full analogy, we require spatial homogeneity by substituting the explicit
dependence of κ on r and r′ by a dependence on their difference (spatial distance)
only:
R = r −r′
In full analogy to our treatment in Sect. 13.3.1, we then obtain:
P(r, t) = ε0E(r, t)
 ∞
0

V
κ(ξ, R)ei(ωξ−kpR)dξdR
Note that in order to keep consistency with the symbols used in this chapter,
the wavevector of the electromagnetic wave is here written as kp. We then have:
χ =
 ∞
0

V
κ(ξ, R)ei(ωξ−kpR)dξdR ≡χ(ω, kp) = ε(ω, kp) −1
(17.23)
The outcome is that under the assumptions discussed here, i.e., the inclusion
of nonlocality, the linear dielectric susceptibility does explicitly depend on the
frequency and the wavevector of the assumed monochromatic electromagnetic
wave propagating through the medium. It is that explicit dependence on the light
wavevector that is called spatial dispersion.
When assuming that κ is different from zero at distances R<<λ only, in the
effective integration volume we have:
e−ikpR ≈1 −ikpR
(17.24)
In many situations, spatial dispersion phenomena contribute only small cor-
rections to the otherwise dominating usual (time) dispersion. This is especially
relevant in dielectrics, where the kernel of the integral in (17.23) is essentially

464

Introduction to Solid State Optics
different from zero only around R-values of the order of the interatomic spacing.
In a classical picture, this is easy to understand, because the bound electrons are
not “allowed” to leave “their” atomic cores; hence, their movement is restricted to
distances of the order of the interatomic spacing. In metals, however, even classi-
cal electrons are allowed to propagate over much longer distances, and therefore,
corrections to the Drude function that arise from spatial dispersion may become
signiﬁcant.
If, however, the frequency of the incident light comes close to frequencies
corresponding to strong narrow absorption lines in dielectrics (i.e., in resonance
conditions), the classical amplitude of the oscillations of bound electrons may
increase. Also, close to resonance, the refractive index will increase remarkably
(compare Fig. 14.5), which results in a corresponding decrease in the wavelength
in the medium. Then, spatial dispersion may also become signiﬁcant, and the
explicit dependence of the susceptibility on the wavevector may even result in the
appearance of birefringence in the relevant spectral regions, although the material
appears to be optically isotropic elsewhere.
In a formal sense, the Doppler broadening in gases is also a manifestation of
spatial dispersion. Indeed, (2.22) may be written as: ωD ≈kp⟨|v|⟩, where v is
the thermal velocity of the gas particles. Thus, the width of the absorption line
depends on kp [14].
We will not derive a corresponding theory of the dielectric response of solids
in the presence of spatial dispersion; this is outside the scope of this book. Let
us only mention here that spatial dispersion is inherent to existing many-electron
theories to the dielectric response of crystals, a convincent and at the same time
accessible approach can be found in Chap. 5 of the excellent textbook [15]. In
this source, the derivation of a more general theory of the dielectric function is
sketched provided that the perturbation is time- and coordinate-dependent. Then,
the Fourier image of the perturbation will contain different Fourier components
with different angular frequencies and wavevectors, which we will for simplicity
call kp again. In the so-called random phase approximation, the response of the
system to each of these Fourier-components is calculated independently. Naturally,
in an expression like (6.21), the expansion coefﬁcients an become kp-dependent
then. Then, it naturally turns out that the dielectric function explicitly depends on
both frequency and wavevector of the perturbation.
We will not derive the formulas here, but indicate the ﬁnal expression for the
dielectric function relevant for optical excitations (assuming direct electronic tran-
sitions between the valence and conduction bands and and a light frequency close
to resonance):

Here kV denotes the electrons wavevector in the valence band, and kC in the
conduction band. Because of k-conservation, we have (17.1a) kC = kV + kp + g.

|kV⟩and |kC⟩denote the corresponding quantum states in the valence and con-
duction bands. For small photon wavevectors (compare 17.24), we have eikpr ≈
1 + ikpr ⇒⟨kC|eikpr|kV⟩≈kp⟨kC|r|kV⟩, and from (17.25) we obtain

Thus, in the case of small photon wavevectors kp, the dependence of the dielec-
tric function on kp cancels out, and we obtain our “standard” result (17.17) which
has been derived neglecting any effects of spatial dispersion. Fortunately, every-
thing is consistent here. In view of (17.26), apart from resonance, we therefore
prefer the writing of (17.25) as:

This is a generalization of the f-sum rule (5.33). Indeed, for small kp, we have

and (17.28) transforms into (5.33).
Note that the general stucture of (17.27) may be guessed from our previ-
ous result (17.17). If we chose the interaction operator like introduced in
Sect. 17.3.1, instead of (17.17) we have:

Which coincides with (17.25). This is an illustration on in how far the mathemati-
cal structure of (17.25) is related to (17.17), but it cannot be regarded a derivation.
For the latter, again, please consult [15].
Let us ﬁnish this chapter by investigating two special cases of (17.25). Let us
start with the response of a system of free electrons. In this case, both initial and
ﬁnal states belong to the same band, namely the conduction band. Accordingly,
we rewrite (17.25) as:

For a completely free electron, we identify the wavefunction with a plane wave
according to (4.5). That means that the period in the Bloch function (16.10) is
zero, so that g becomes inﬁnitely large, and summation over g looses its sense.

17.6

Consequently, the matrix element in the above expression becomes equal to 1, and
we obtain the Lindhard formula for the dielectric function [16]:

The Lindhardt formula is important, for example, in the theory of energy
electron loss spectra (EELS).
In application to a semiconductor, (17.25) (here in the writing of 17.27) yields
a different result. Let us estimate what happens at ω →0. For simplicity we again
assume: [W(kV) −W(kC)] = 1.
Further we approximate: E(kC) −E(kV) ≈⟨E⟩. From the sum rule (17.28),
we then have:

In our approximation, we obtained a simple Lorentzian dielectric function for
estimating the response of interband transitions in a semiconducting (or insulating)
solid. This is an encouraging result, because it conﬁrms us about the applicability
of the classical single or multioscillator models for “quick and dirty” approxima-
tion of the dielectric function in a crystalline solid. Here the introduced value ⟨E⟩
corresponds to some average value of the difference E(kC) −E(kV) in (17.25)
or (17.27). When associating it with the central frequency of a single Lorentzian
oscillator, we obtain the same asymptotes for ω→0 and ω →∞as in the classical
oscillator model.

Basic Effects of Nonlinear Optics
Abstract
A nonlinear material equation is introduced, and prominent examples of
second- and third-order nonlinear optical effects are discussed in the frame-
work of a classical approach. Emphasis is placed on nonlinear refraction,
nonlinear absorption, and second harmonic generation. The treatment is mainly
constricted to the classical picture.
18.1
Starting Point
Let us start again from the equation for the microscopic dipole moment, as given
by (12.1) and (12.2):

induced electric dipole moment
In this representation, the dipole moment appears to be composed from three
different contributions:
1. A permanent dipole moment
2. An induced dipole moment that depends linearly on the local electric ﬁeld
3. An induced dipole moment that depends nonlinearly on the local electric ﬁeld
In the previous chapters we have essentially considered effects arising from the
ﬁrst two contributions. This chapter will deal with effects that arise from the third
contribution.

Basic Effects of Nonlinear Optics
Also, we have to remember that (12.2) has been formulated for time-
independent electric ﬁelds originally. The effects arising from a timedependence
of the ﬁeld have been introduced in Chap. 13 for the special case of the linear
polarization. For isotropic media, we postulated there (13.5):
P(t) = ε0
∞
	
0
κ(ξ)E(t −ξ)dξ
This is the linear material equation in the time-domain representation. Further
we introduced the linear susceptibility via (13.7):
χ =
∞
	
0
κ(ξ)eiωξdξ = χ(ω)
After having introduced the dielectric function, we then arrived at the material
equation in the frequency domain representation as given by (13.9a):
Dω = ε0ε(ω)Eω
It will be our task now to obtain a nonlinear material equation as a general-
ization to (13.9) or (13.9a). Although we have not dealt with optically anisotropic
materials so far, let us write down the generalization of (13.9a) to the anisotropic
case. We then have:

(18.1)
Here, in order to distinguish from nonlinear susceptibilities, we have introduced
the superscript (1) to each of the components of the linear susceptibility, which
now form a 3×3 susceptibility tensor χ. Correspondingly, instead of the scalar
dielectric function, we now have a 3×3 dielectric tensor ε.
18.2
Physical Idea
In fact, the basic physical idea behind this chapter has already been disclosed at
the end of Sect. 17.4. Instead of a linear dependence between electric ﬁeld and
induced dipole moment, we now assume a nonlinear dependence. This can be
understood as resulting from a nonlinear dependence of the restoring force on the
elongation of the carge carriers, an effect which is expected to become relevant at
sufﬁciently large electric ﬁeld strength.
In order to obtain the material equation relevant for nonlinear optics, essentially
we have to reproduce the treatment from Chaps. 12 and 13 for the nonlinear terms
in (12.2). In particular, we have to

• Generalize (13.5) with respect to the inclusion of nonlinear terms
• Formulate an analogon to the Clausius–Mossotti equation that is valid for non-
linear susceptibilities. Then, from classical or semiclassical expressions for
microscopic hyperpolarizabilities β(j > 1), we could conclude on corresponding
nonlinear susceptibilities.
• Formulate and solve nonlinear wave equations in order to obtain recipes for the
calculation of optical signals in the presence of optical nonlinearities.
The generalized material equation will have the formal structure of an expansion
into a Tailor series according to:
D = ε0E+P = ε0E + P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + · · ·

(18.2)
Equation (18.2) is written in a somewhat symbolic manner. In fact, the products
at the right hand of (18.2) have to be understood as tensor products, the suscepti-
bilities χ(1), χ(2), χ(3), . . . themselves represent tensors of different ranks. When
Pi is the ith Cartesian component of the polarization with i = x, y, z, we may write:

(18.2a)
The ﬁrst equation in (18.2a) is nothing else than the general (anisotropic)
version of the linear material equation, as already introduced in Sect. 18.1.
According to (18.1), the linear susceptibility χ(1) may be regarded as a 3×
3 quadratic matrix. The second-order nonlinear susceptibility, χ(2), represents a
3×3×3 tensor with 27 components, while the third-order nonlinear susceptibility
χ(3) has 81 components.
In any specialized treatment of nonlinear optics, one would now establish rela-
tions between different components of the susceptibility tensors and show that
there is only a limited number of independent components of the correspond-
ing tensors. This is far beyond our treatment, but we will mention at least two
important results:
• In centrosymmetric materials, all components of χ(2) and other even-order
susceptibilities are equal to zero in electric dipole approximation.
• There is no material symmetry, where all components of χ(3) or other odd-order
susceptibilities would be equal to zero (except, of course, vacuum).

Basic Effects of Nonlinear Optics
In our further rather qualitative treatment, we will neglect the tensor character of
the susceptibilities. Practically that means that we restrict on a single component
of (18.2) and (18.2a) like according to:
Px = ε0

18.3.1 Nonlinear Material Equation
In order to get some idea on the frequency arguments relevant for the nonlinear
susceptibilities introduced previously, we will have to proceed the same way as we
did in the case of the linear material equation. According to (18.2c) and (13.5), in
the time domain we may now write:
P(t) = P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + · · · = ε + ε0

(18.3)
Equation (18.3) is nothing else than a nonlinear generalization of (13.5). We do
not regard ferroelectrics, so that the constant, ﬁeld-independent contribution P(0) is
assumed to be zero. In the general case described by (18.3), the response functions
κ(i) again represent tensors of a range according to (18.2a).

When comparing (13.5) and (18.3), we notice a further complication of the
mathematical treatment of nonlinear optical processes. Because both the electric
ﬁeld strength and the polarization are real physical values, the response functions
κ(i) must be real as well. Nevertheless, in linear optics, we were used to work with
complex ﬁelds and polarizations. The reason is that in the linear equation (13.5),
we may make use of the superposition principle. When in the ﬁnal result the real
polarization is required, one simply has to add the conjugated complex term, and
everything will be ﬁne (compare also (2.1)–(2.5) in this context).
This treatment is no more correct in nonlinear optics, because such a treatment
would result in a loss of polarization terms. This may be demonstrated by a sim-
ple example. Let us regard the quadratic nonlinearity according to the simpliﬁed
equation: P(2) = ε0χ(2)E2. The assumption E = E0
2 e−iωt leads us to
P(2) = ε0χ(2) E2
0
4 e−2iωt
(18.4a)
For simplicity, the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld strength should be real
throughout this discussion. We ﬁnd that the assumed time dependence of the elec-
tric ﬁeld leads to a polarization in the medium which oscillates with twice the
frequency of the incoming ﬁeld. Of course, such an oscillating polarization gives
rise to the generation of an electromagnetic wave at the angular frequency 2ω.
This means that at least a part of the energy of the ingoing wave is transferred to a
new wave with the doubled frequency, an effect which is called second-harmonic
generation (SHG). SHG is the most prominent effect of nonlinear optics in media
with a quadratic nonlinearity.
Let us now regard another case. We assume: E =
E0
2 e+iωt. The resulting
second-order polarization is:
P(2) = ε0χ(2) E2
0
4 e2iωt
(18.4b)
Both (18.4a) and (18.4b) describe a polarization that oscillates at a frequency
2ω. Summing up (18.4a) and (18.4b) will lead to a real value of the polarization,
but it will not give any new physical effects.
Let us now regard a real ﬁeld strength given by the algebraic sum of the ver-
sions discussed so far. We assume: E =
E0
2

e+iωt + e−iωt
= E0 cos ωt. The
corresponding second-order polarization becomes:
P(2) = ε0χ(2) E2
0
4

e2iωt + e−2iωt + 2

(18.4c)
This is more than what has been predicted by the algebraic sum from (18.4a)
and (18.4b). Although the SHG terms are present as expected, there is a further
term, which corresponds to a time-independent (static) polarization, created by the
quadratic nonlinearity as the result of a nonlinear effect called optical rectiﬁcation.
Equation (18.4c) makes it clear that as the result of the nonlinear interaction of a

476
18
Basic Effects of Nonlinear Optics
monochromatic wave with matter, second-order polarization terms occur that are
constant or oscillating with twice the frequency of the incoming wave.
We see that the application of the simpliﬁed complex electric ﬁelds will lead to
a signiﬁcant loss of information, when we deal with nonlinear optics. Therefore,
instead of (2.1) or the like, in this chapter we will always regard a real expression
for the electric ﬁelds according to:
E(t) = 1

j
E0 je−iω jt + c.c.
(18.5)
with c.c—conjugate complex value.
18.3.2 Frequency Conversion Processes
The general conclusion from (18.3) and (18.5) is that the nonlinear second-order
polarization oscillates with all sum and difference frequencies resulting from the
primary frequencies of the incoming ﬁeld (18.5). For a detailed treatment see
[1]. Correspondingly, one speaks on Sum Frequency Generation (SFG) and Dif-
ference Frequency Generation (DFG) in nonlinear optics. Formally, from (18.2)
when assuming only the second-order term, we obtain:
P(2)(t) = 1

(18.6)
The concrete expressions for χ(2) follow from the comparison with (18.3).
The frequency arguments in (18.6) have to be understood in the following way:
The ﬁrst frequency indicates the resulting frequency of the second-order polar-
ization. The following frequencies indicate the frequencies of the electric ﬁelds
forming the polarization and the particular way of their combination. Thus, the
effects described so far correspond to the following susceptibilities:
χ(2)
ω = ωl + ω j

⇔SFG
χ(2)
ω = ωl −ω j

⇔DFG
χ(2)(2ω = ω + ω) ⇔SHG
χ(2)(0 = ω −ω) ⇔optical rectiﬁcation
(18.7)
We will not perform a similarly detailed discussion of the properties of nonlin-
ear susceptibilities as we did in the case of the linear susceptibility. We only repeat
here that there exist several symmetry relations which may reduce the quantity of
nonzero and independent components of the susceptibility.

18.3

But let us now have a closer look at an extremely important selection rule:
In a medium with an inversion center (or inversion symmetry, or so-called cen-
trosymmetric materials), all components of any even-order nonlinear susceptibility
are zero in the dipole approximation. For the particular case of the second-order
susceptibility, this is a direct conclusion from (18.6). Imagine an electric ﬁeld like
(18.5), which causes a certain second-order polarization. From the supposed inver-
sion symmetry it is clear that an inversion of the electric ﬁeld strength should be
accompanied by an inversion of the polarization:
E →−E ⇒P →−P ⇒P(2)(−E) = −P(2)(+E)
On the other hand, for all projections of P(2) it follows from (18.6) that
P(2)(−E) =

Both conditions together may only be fulﬁlled, when the second-order polar-
ization is zero for any assumed electric ﬁeld conﬁguration. This means that the
second-order susceptibility must be zero. This kind of discussion may be per-
formed for any even-order susceptibility, but obviously not for the odd-order
susceptibilities.
For us it is important to notice that second (and other even)-order nonlinear
processes are only allowed in media, which lack inversion symmetry. On the other
hand, odd-order processes are in principle allowed in any medium. For that rea-
son, even-order processes are rarely used in analytic optical spectroscopy, because
they cannot be applied to every bulk material. Nonlinear optical spectroscopy usu-
ally bases on odd-order (basically third order) optical effects. On the other hand,
second-order processes are often applied for frequency conversion processes such
as SHG, SFG or DFG, utilizing a couple of selected nonlinear materials which
have the necessary nonzero components of the second-order susceptibility ten-
sor. Prominent traditional examples are potassium dihydrogen phosphate KH2PO4
(KDP), ammonium dihydrogen phosphate NH4H2PO4 (ADP), or lithium nio-
bate LiNbO3. Modern developments pursue the qualiﬁcation of new second-order
materials like Li2B4O7 (LTB) or YAl3(BO3)4 (YAB).
There is an important exclusion from this rule: At the interface between two
materials, inversion symmetry is always violated, although both of the particu-
lar materials may be centrosymmetric. Therefore, second-order processes may be
used for interface spectroscopy. Being applied to the surface or interfaces between
centrosymmetric materials, their advantage is to supply a background-free second-
order optical response of the interface region. Combined with resonant local

478
18
Basic Effects of Nonlinear Optics
electric ﬁeld strength enhancement mechanisms, second-order processes supply
highly interface-sensitive spectroscopic tools for interface and ultrathin adsorbate
layer spectroscopy.
In complete analogy to the second-order polarization, one may discuss the third-
order fundamental frequency terms in (18.3) in order to investigate optical effects
that arise as a result of third-order nonlinearity in different media. It is particularly
important for any spectroscopist to become familiar with third-order nonlinear
effects, because the latter may be observed in any medium regardless on the con-
crete symmetry that is subject to the structure of the given sample. In this section
we will restrict on a few remarks concerning the third-harmonic generation THG,
but we will return to third-order processes is the Sects. 18.5.2 and 18.5.3.
Let us assume an oscillating electric ﬁeld according to:
E = E0
2 e−iωt + c.c.
Proceeding the same way as for the quadratic nonlinearity, we obtain a third-
order polarization term, which oscillates with the frequency 3ω:
P(3) = · · · + ε0χ(3)(3ω = ω + ω + ω) E3
0
8 e−3iωt + c.c. + · · ·
(18.8)
Consequently, in a third-order nonlinear medium, an electromagnetic wave will
be generated that has the frequency 3ω. The corresponding process is called third-
harmonic generation THG. Nevertheless, in frequency conversion practice, THG
is usually not accomplished by means of a third-order nonlinear frequency con-
version. Instead, it turns out to be more efﬁcient to use a cascade of second-order
processes to generate higher order harmonics of a given fundamental frequency.
Thus, the third harmonic may be generated by SHG of the fundamental frequency,
followed by an SFG process between the second harmonic and the fundamental
frequency.
18.4
Consistency Considerations
Regardless on the concrete values of the linear and nonlinear susceptibilities, it
is clear that (18.2) converges to the linear equation (13.9) when the electric ﬁeld
strength becomes sufﬁciently small. Figure 18.1 demonstrates the principle depen-
dence of the individual contributions to the polarization on the ﬁeld strength.
At weak ﬁelds, the linear contribution is dominating, and in this case the pre-
viously discussed effects of linear optics (LO) are sufﬁcient to describe the optical
properties of a material.
This raises the question on the value of a characteristic ﬁeld strength when
the nonlinear terms in (18.2) become signiﬁcant. This question is difﬁcult to be
answered generally, because dispersion does matter, and off-resonance processes

18.4
Consistency Considerations
479
Fig.18.1 Linear and
nonlinear contributions to the
polarization of a nonlinear
medium
are as usually less efﬁcient than resonant constellations. But when comparing typ-
ical off-resonant values of tabulated susceptibilities in solids [2, pp. 809–837], we
arrive at the rule of thumb:
χ(1) ~100, χ(2) ~10−11 m/V, χ(3) ~10−22m2/V2.
Then, according to (18.2c)
P = ε0

χ(1)E + χ(2)E2 + χ(3)E3 + · · ·

We ﬁnd that the different nonlinear contributions to the polarization become
comparable to the linear one when E ~1011 V/m is fulﬁlled. This is of the order of
intraatomic electric ﬁelds (compare task 18.7.3). Hence, for applying linear optics,
we should require that the local ﬁeld induced by the incident light is signiﬁcantly
smaller than the intraatomic ﬁeld strength.
At higher ﬁeld strength, the nonlinear polarization becomes signiﬁcant, so that
we enter the ﬁeld of nonlinear optics. Here, both linear and nonlinear contributions
to the full polarization have to be taken into account. Practically, this is usually of
signiﬁcance when we deal with laser light. In our treatment, we use a representa-
tion of the polarization like (18.2c). When restricting on the quadratic and cubic
terms, we implicitly assume that the series (18.2c) is quickly converging, such that
higher order nonlinear terms do not matter. We will call this situation the regime
of weak optical nonlinearity.
Let us ﬁnally note in this context that the relation between hyperpolarizabilities
as introduced in (12.2) and the corresponding nonlinear susceptibilities is given

, familiar from the local ﬁeld treatment introduced
in Sect. 12.3.4 [relation (12.15)]. Obviously, our local ﬁeld treatment is again
restricted to optically isotropic media.
Let us now have a closer look at the situation in centrosymmetric materi-
als. As we have pointed out in Sect. 18.3.2, in a centrosymmetric material, the
second-order (as well as any higher even order) polarization should be equal to
zero for symmetry reasons. On the other hand, from Sect. 6.6.1 we know that
centrosymmetric systems obey the parity selection rule, which means that in a cen-
trosymmetric system the transition matrix element of the dipole moment becomes
zero, whenever the participating quantum states have the same parity. This raises
the question in how far these observations are interconnected.
In order to answer this question, we now would have to derive a semiclassical
or quantum mechanical expression for the hyperpolarizabilities, similarly to our
approach to the linear polarizability demonstrated in Sect. 12.6. This treatment
is again beyond the scope of this book, but interested readers are referred to the
density matrix approach demonstrated in [1]. We only mention here that in analogy
to the already derived QM structure of the linear polarizability [compare (12.26)],
the quantum mechanical expressions for higher order susceptibilities are dominated
by terms like:
χ(1) ̸= 0 ⇔

n,m
dnmdmn ̸= 0
χ(2) ̸= 0 ⇔

n,m,l
dnmdmldln ̸= 0
χ(3) ̸= 0 ⇔

n,m,l,k
dnmdmldlkdkn ̸= 0
(18.10)
and so on. By the way, for the particular case of χ(2), this may easily be guessed
from elaborating (12.27a) in detail, while focusing on the terms proportional to E2.
Anyway, (18.10) leads us to the conclusion that in a quantum system with inversion
symmetry, all even-order optical susceptibilities must be identical to zero in the
dipole approximation.
Indeed, let us look at the second-order susceptibility in a system with inversion
symmetry. In such systems, the parity selection rule is relevant. Supposing that
state |n⟩is of even parity, we must require that |m⟩is odd, otherwise dnm will
be zero. For the same reason, |l⟩must be even. But if so, dln will be zero. So
that there is no way to arrange the quantum states in a manner that the product
dnmdmldln becomes different from zero whenever the system is centrosymmetric.

This argumentation applies to all even-order susceptibilities, but it is not applicable

(d). The upwards directed arrows symbolize the frequency of the electric ﬁeld,
the downward directed arrow the resulting frequency of the (maybe nonlinear)
polarization.
Remark: Just for the case: Please do not confuse inversion symmetry with optical
isotropy!
Let us thus resume that compared to linear processes, nonlinear optical
phenomena.
• Obey different selection rules
• Have different resonance conditions.
Therefore, in order to initiate a resonant nonlinear optical process, there is more
ﬂexibility in the choice of light sources than in a linear process.

Application to Concrete Problems
18.5.1 The Pockels Effect
Let us no turn to a further second-order optical effect, which is of practical
importance for light modulation purposes. It is the so-called linear electrooptic
effect or Pockels effect. Imagine a second-order material, externally excited by a
monochromatic ﬁeld and a static one (Es). The ﬁeld is thus given by:
E = E0
2 e−iωt + c.c. + Es
When calculating now the second-order polarization, it will contain a term that
oscillates with the frequency ω. The latter is given by:
P(2)
ω = ε0E0Esχ(2)(ω = ω + 0)e−iωt + c.c.
Of course, the linear polarization will also contain terms that are oscillating
with ω according to:
P(1)
ω = 1
2ε0E0χ(1)(ω)e−iωt + c.c.
So that the full polarization at ω is given by (neglecting higher order
polarization terms):
P|ω = P(1)
ω + P(2)
ω
= ε0

χ(1)(ω) + 2χ(2)(ω = ω + 0)Es
 E0
2 e−iωt + c.c.
(18.11)
Equation (18.11) is completely analogous to a linear material equation, when
regarding the term in parentheses as an effective susceptibility, which depends on
the strength of the static ﬁeld as a parameter. Hence, we may deﬁne:
χ(eff)(ω) ≡χ(1)(ω) + 2χ(2)(ω = ω + 0)Es
(18.12)
An electromagnetic wave with the frequency ω will propagate in such a non-
linear medium in an identical manner as it would propagate in a linear one, when
the linear susceptibility has the value as prescribed by (18.12). We may therefore
deﬁne an effective refractive index analogously to the treatment in linear optics:
n(eff)(ω) =

ε(eff)(ω) ≡

1 + χ(eff)(ω)
=

1 + χ(1)(ω) + 2χ(2)(ω = ω + 0)Es = n(eff)(ω, Es)
(18.13)

18.5
Application to Concrete Problems
483
According to (18.13), the value of the effective refractive index may be con-
trolled by the strength of the applied static electric ﬁeld. Hence, the propagation
properties of the wave with frequency ω may be controlled by the static ﬁeld.
The name “linear electrooptical effect” arises from the linear dependence of the
effective susceptibility on the ﬁeld strength. In real world, the Pockels effect leads
to the appearance of a ﬁeld-induced birefringence or alters the already existent
birefringence.
The mentioned effect is practically applied in so-called Pockels cells. They may
be used to modulate the resonator properties of lasers in order to produce short
laser pulses.
18.5.2 Nonlinear Refraction
Let us now regard a medium with cubic nonlinearity, illuminated by monochro-
matic light according to:
E = E0
2 e−iωt + c.c.
In this writing, in a medium with refractive index n, the expression for the light
intensity (2.6) generalizes to:
I =
n
2μ0c|E0|2
But let us return to (18.8), and in particular to terms which do not oscillate at
the THG frequency. Indeed, as a result of the third-order frequency mixing, we
obtain a third-order polarization term that oscillates at the fundamental frequency
ω. It is given by:
P(3)
ω = 3
8ε0χ(3)(ω = ω + ω −ω)E2
0 E∗
0e−iωt + c.c.
Of course, the linear polarization also yields a contribution to the fundamental
frequency. So that the full polarization at the fundamental frequency will be given
by:
P|ω = P(1)
ω + P(3)
ω
= 1
2ε0

χ(1)(ω) + 3
4χ(3)(ω = ω + ω −ω)|E0|2

E0e−iωt + c.c.
(18.14)
We are now in a similar situation as in the previous section, when we discussed
the linear electrooptical effect (18.11). Equation (18.14) is again equivalent to a

484
18
Basic Effects of Nonlinear Optics
linear material equation with an effective susceptibility, the latter depending on the
intensity of the incoming light. The effective susceptibility is now given by:
χ(eff)(ω) = χ(1)(ω) + 3
4χ(3)(ω = ω + ω −ω)|E0|2
(18.15)
It depends on the square of the ﬁeld strength and represents a special version of
the optical Kerr effect. The square root of the effective dielectric function becomes:

ε(eff)(ω) =

1 + χ(1)(ω) + 3
4χ(3)(ω = ω + ω −ω)|E0|2
= √ε

1 + 3
4
χ(3)(ω = ω + ω −ω)
ε
|E0|2
where, as usual, ε = 1 + χ(1).
Let us now assume that the linear dielectric function is purely real at the given
frequency. In linear optics, the medium would then be free of absorption, and the
usual refractive index would be given by the square root of the dielectric function.
The effective index of refraction is now given by:
ˆn(eff)(ω) = n

1 + 3
4
χ(3)(ω = ω + ω −ω)
n2
|E0|2
If the nonlinear contribution is small compared to the linear one, this relation-
ship may be rewritten as:
ˆn(eff)(ω) ≈n + 3
8
χ(3)(ω = ω + ω −ω)
n
|E0|2
(18.16)
Although the linear dielectric function has been assumed to be real, the effective
index of refraction may be complex, depending on the properties of the third-order
susceptibility at the given frequency. In any case, we obtain an intensity-dependent
effective refractive index according to:
n(eff)(ω) ≈n + 3
8
Reχ(3)(ω = ω + ω −ω)
n
|E0|2 ≡n + n2I
n2 = 3
4
μ0c
n2 Reχ(3)(ω = ω + ω −ω)
(18.17)
It turns out to be dependent on the intensity of the electromagnetic wave. The
value n2 is called the nonlinear refractive index of the medium. The intensity
dependence of the effective refractive index in a third-order (or even higher odd
order) nonlinear optical medium is responsible for different self-interaction pro-
cesses of highly intense light beams, such as self-focusing of laser beams, or

18.5
Application to Concrete Problems
485
self-phase-modulation processes in ultrashort light pulses, essential for white light
continuum generation.
Let us now look at the imaginary part. From (18.16), it follows immediately
that there is a nonlinear absorption coefﬁcient given by:
αnl(ω) ≈3
4
ω
cn Imχ(3)(ω = ω + ω −ω)|E0|2 = βI;
β = 3
2
μ0ω
n2 Imχ(3)(ω = ω + ω −ω)
(18.18)
With increasing intensity of the light, the medium may thus become absorbing.
As it may be shown in terms of a semiclassical treatment of the nonlinear suscep-
tibilities, the nonlinear absorption as described by (18.18) results from two-photon
absorption (TPA) processes. Therefore, the nonlinear absorption coefﬁcient β is
also called the TPA coefﬁcient.
Note that (18.17) and (18.18) need to be modiﬁed when the linear refractive
index is complex. Then, in (18.16), n has to be replaced by n + iK. Instead of
(18.17) and (18.18),we then have [3]:
n(eff)(ω) ≈n + 3

The mentioned effects shall give you, dear reader, a ﬁrst idea on which kind of
new optical effects may be expected in the ﬁeld of nonlinear optics.
Note that in accordance the so-called Miller’s rule, there appears to be a
correlation between the (non-resonant) linear and nonlinear refractive indices in
dielectrics and semiconductors. This is visualized in Fig. 18.3. The experimen-
tal points are collected from [4–6] as well as references cited therein. Although
the data belong to different wavelength, there is a clear trend toward larger non-
linear indices when the linear refractive index increases. This correlation may be
understood from the theoretical expressions for the susceptibilities as obtained
in the semiclassical approach, the gray line in Fig. 18.3 shows a corresponding
dependence predicted by the formula approximately valid for small frequencies

Advanced Material: Nonlinear Wave Equations
Prior to writing down nonlinear wave equations, let us return to (18.6) and (18.7).
It turns out that in a second-order nonlinear material illuminated with a non-
monochromatic input, electromagnetic waves at all possible sum and difference
frequencies of the original input frequencies should be generated. And even more,
the newly generated frequencies may again form new sum and difference fre-
quencies and so on, such that one could expect that the energy of the incident
light immediately spreads into an unmanageable multiplicity of waves with new
frequencies. Of course, this is not observed in reality.
In order to understand the reason we have to recall an important point that we
have already formulated in Sect. 13.4: Of course, knowledge of the nonlinear sus-
ceptibility is essential. But it is not only the nonlinear polarization that matters, but
the propagation conditions for the waves generated by the nonlinear polarization
term are important as well. In order to investigate those propagation conditions,
the corresponding wave equations must be solved.
It turns out that only those conversion processes are efﬁcient, which obey a
so-called phase matching condition. Let us explain this condition turning to the
example of SHG.
In a naive picture, the phase matching condition may be understood as a conse-
quence of conservation of energy and momentum during a frequency conversion
process. Let us illustrate this in the special case of an SHG process while neglect-
ing any absorption losses. In the SHG process, energy conservation would require
that the energy of two photons with angular frequency ω should be equal to the
energy of a single photon with the doubled angular frequency:
2ω = ω + ω
The same should be valid for the momentum. Then we have:
k(2ω) = 2ω
c n(2ω) = k(ω) + k(ω) = ω
c n(ω) + ω
c n(ω) = 2ω
c n(ω)
From here we ﬁnd the SHG phase matching condition:
n(2ω) = n(ω)
(18.19)
Essentially it requires that both the fundamental wave and its second harmonic
propagate with the same phase velocity.
Because of normal dispersion, (18.19) is tricky to fulﬁll, and special precautions
need to be met in order to achieve phase matching. The usual workaround is based
on the application of optically anisotropic crystals with nonzero components of the
quadratic susceptibility tensor, such that the ordinary refractive index at the input
frequency equals the extraordinary one at the SHG frequency, or vice versa.

488
18
Basic Effects of Nonlinear Optics
In this simple picture, violation of phase matching results in a violation of
photon momentum conservation. In accordance to uncertainty relations like
introduced in Chap. 3 that might be connected to a restricted geometrical
path 	z where efﬁcient SHG generation can occur. In fact we have a clear
analogy to the earlier discussed properties of a wave packet [compare (3.15)].
According to (3.15), a vanishing momentum uncertainty requires 	z →∞,
while a restricted 	z will surely result in a ﬁnite momentum uncertainty. Let
us look at this effect in more detail and estimate the mentioned characteristic
geometrical path.
We will now consider the process of interaction of an electromagnetic wave char-
acterized by the angular frequency ω with the wave at the doubled frequency in a
medium with second-order optical nonlinearity. For simplicity let us assume that
both waves propagate along the z-axis.
Imagine now that (18.19) is violated. Assume further that at z = 0, an initial
SHG signal has been generated that propagates with the wavevector kk(2ω). At
the same time, the fundamental wave propagates with the wavevector k(ω). At
each z, it generates an SHG signal proportional to:
P(2)
2ω ∝E2 ∝e2ik(ω)z
If phase matching is violated, at a certain distance L, the newly generated SHG
signal appears to be in exact antiphase to the initial SHG wave. Then, destructive
interference in the SHG signal will occur, and the energy of the SHG signal will
be transferred back to the wave with angular frequency ω. This antiphase condition
will be accomplished when:
2k(ω)L = k(2ω)L ± π
From here we obtain that characteristic length (called here the coherence length
Lcoh) by:
Lcoh =
π
|2k(ω) −k(2ω)| ≡
π
|	k| =
λ
4|n(ω) −n(2ω)|
(18.20)
Here, λ is the vacuum wavelength of the wave with angular frequency ω. Hence,
the SHG process appears to be efﬁcient only at a length scale deﬁned by (18.20).
After having traveled the geometrical path 2Lcoh, the SHG intensity is zero again,
such that 2Lcoh	k = 2π, which is in agreement to (3.15) [compare later (18.28)].
Let us now turn to a more quantitative treatment of the SHG conversion process.
We start from the wave (13.2). From there we have:
graddiv E −	E = −μ0
∂2D
∂t2

18.6
Advanced Material: Nonlinear Wave Equations
489
In contrast to our treatment in Chap. 13, however, we now have to consider non-
linear terms in the dicplacement vector as according to (18.2). Therefore, instead of
the linear wave (13.11) we now ﬁnd its nonlinear counterpart according to (18.21):
D = ε0E + P(1) + P(2) = ε0εE + P(2)
div E = 0
$
⇒	E −ε
c2
∂2E
∂t2 = μ0

Again, we assume the nonlinear interaction of two waves only according to
(18.22):

⇐
 ω1 = ω
ω2 = 2ω
(18.22)
Hereby, the nonlinear interaction may turn the fundamental angular frequency ω
to the doubled angular frequency by the SHG process, while the doubled frequency
may be transferred back to the fundamental one by the DFG process. Assuming
for simplicity again that both waves propagate along the z-axis, from (18.21), we
ﬁnd for the individual frequencies

P(2)
0 j = P(2)
0 j (z) ≡B j(z)
(18.24)
When considering the two frequencies deﬁned by (18.22) only, from (18.24)
and (18.6) we have

(18.25)
Let us remember that only for the sake of simplicity, we have neglected the
tensor character of the quadratic susceptibility, and used a scalar writing instead.
In fact, for the corresponding tensor components relevant in (18.25), permutation
symmetry requirements guarantee that both of the ﬁxed susceptibility components
are identical, such that we can skip the frequency arguments in our simpliﬁed
writing (compare [7]).
Let us now notice that according to (18.24), the Aj terms represent z-dependent
complex amplitudes of the corresponding waves. When now applying the approx-
imation of slowly varying amplitudes, in (18.23) we will only consider the ﬁrst

to the equations for slowly varying amplitudes of both waves according to:

(18.26)
Equations (18.26) represent the ﬁnal equations for slowly varying amplitudes
of the two interacting waves. Let us discuss their solution for three special cases
(Examples 1–3).
Example 1: Let us assume that the intensity of the SHG signal is much smaller than
that of the fundamental frequency (low-conversion efﬁciency regime). Moreover, we
assume that exact phase matching is guaranteed. We then set:
|A2| << |A1| ⇒A1 ≈const. = A1(z = 0) ≡A10; 	k = 0
From (18.26) we obtain:

(18.27)
When setting A2(z = 0) ≡A20 = 0, we immediately ﬁnd:
⇒|A2|2 = |A10|2
 z
Lnl
2
This equation is approximately valid at distances z ≪Lnl, but clearly violates
energy conservation at larger distances.
Example 2: Same as example 1, but with phase matching violated. We set:
|A2| ≪|A1| ⇒A1 ≈A10; 	k ̸= 0; A20 = 0

ei	kξdξ ∝ei	kz −1
	k
⇒|A2(z)|2 ∝(1 −cos 	kz)
(18.28)
We thus obtain oscillating behavior of the SHG amplitude. The ﬁrst maximum
occurs at:
|A2(z)|2 = max ⇒	kz = ±π ⇒z =
π
|	k| =
λ
4|n1 −n2| ≡Lcoh
We ﬁnd that at a distance z = Lcoh, which coincides with the coherence length
earlier introduced in (18.20), the SHG signal intensity reaches its maximum and
then drops down again. At z = 2Lcoh, according to (8.28), the SHG intensity is zero
again, and the process starts from a new. The reason has already been identiﬁed:
Destructive interference leads to a suppression of the SHG signal, and accordingly,
the energy is pumped back into the fundamental wave.
Example 3: Let us now suppose phase matching as well as energy conservation. We
set:
	k = 0; A20 = 0; |A1|2 + |A2|2 = |A10|2 ̸= 0
We then obtain:

the absorption coefﬁcient for the SHG wave has been assumed to be 100 times larger than that of
the fundamental wave
photonics at Abbe School of Photonics, FSU Jena. For efﬁcient SHG generation,
obviously, the nonlinear length should be as small as possible, and the coherence
length as large as possible. The oscillatory behavior of the intensities in the absence
of phase matching is easily recognized and conﬁrms our qualitative discussion at
the beginning of this section.

Note that momentum conservation in such a conversion process will not be satis-
ﬁed if the process is to occur in empty space. The presence of a heavy nucleus is
indeed necessary for momentum conservation. However, its impact (kinetic recoil
energy) on the energy balance is in most cases negligible. Therefore, the task may
be solved in terms of the energy balance only.

What about the constant A? From

−∞U(x)dx = −A.
When interpreting U(x) as the limit of a rectangular potential box with height
–U0 and width L, while requiring U0 →+ ∞and L →0 with LU0 = const.,
then it becomes clear that A = LU0.

Let us start from repeating the treatment of bosons. We have the obvious
relation:
⟨n|N

|n⟩= ⟨n|ˆa+ ˆa|n⟩= √n⟨n|ˆa+|n −1⟩= n⟨n | n⟩= n
This is obvious from (5.48) for any n > 0, and from the ground-state deﬁnition
ˆa|0⟩= 0 for n = 0. For bosons, we further have:
ˆa ˆa+ −ˆa+ ˆa = 1
And therefore:
⟨n|N

|n⟩= ⟨n|ˆa+ ˆa|n⟩= ⟨n|ˆa ˆa+ −1|n⟩
= ⟨n|ˆa ˆa+|n⟩−⟨n | n⟩=
√
n + 1⟨n|ˆa|n + 1⟩−1
= (n + 1)⟨n | n⟩−1 = n + 1 −1 = n
which coincides with the previously obtained result, i.e., does not constrain the
allowed values of n. Therefore, for example, a given photon mode may be occupied
by an arbitrary number of photons.
Another result will be obtained for fermions. We start from:
⟨n|M

|n⟩= ⟨n|ˆb+ ˆb|n⟩= √n⟨n|ˆb+|n −1⟩= n⟨n | n⟩= n
Let us now make use of the anticommutation relation as valid for fermions. We
write:
ˆb ˆb+ + ˆb+ ˆb = 1 and therefore obtain:
⟨n|M

|n⟩= ⟨n|ˆb+ ˆb|n⟩= ⟨n|1 −ˆb ˆb+|n⟩= 1 −⟨n|ˆb ˆb+|n⟩
Let us analyze this relation. For n = 0, we obtain:
⟨0|M

|0⟩= 1−⟨0|ˆb ˆb+|0⟩= 1−⟨0|ˆb|1⟩= 1−⟨0 | 0⟩= 0, which is a reasonable
result and coincides which what we have expected. But for n = 1, we ﬁnd:
⟨1|M

|1⟩= 1 −⟨1|ˆb ˆb+|1⟩= 1 −
√
2⟨1|ˆb|2⟩= 1 −2⟨1 | 1⟩= −1
This result is obviously senseless. In order to obtain the expected value
⟨1|N

|1⟩= 1, the only chance is to postulate:
ˆb+|1⟩= 0 ⇒⟨1|M

|1⟩= 1 −⟨1|ˆb ˆb+|1⟩

But this has further consequences. From ˆb+|1⟩= 0, we immediately obtain:

0 = ˆb+|1⟩=
√
2|2⟩⇒|2⟩= 0 ⇒|3⟩= 0 and so on. Thus, the assumed
anticommutation relation forbids occupying the corresponding states with more
than one identical particle. This is exactly what we have learned from the Pauli
principle; i.e., the fermionic quantum state may be either empty (n = 0), or singly
occupied (n = 1).
Another approach is based on the repeated operation of M

on its eigenstate.
Then,
M
2|n⟩= nM

|n⟩= n2|n⟩(a)
On the other hand, we have:

1 −ˆb+ ˆb

ˆb|n⟩
= ˆb+ ˆb|n⟩−ˆb+ ˆb+ ˆb ˆb|n⟩= n|n⟩−ˆb+ ˆb+ ˆb ˆb|n⟩
(b)
For the interesting values n = 0 and n = 1, the last term in (b) is deﬁnitely zero.
But formally, it may be written as:
ˆb+ ˆb+ ˆb ˆb|n⟩= ˆb+ ˆb+ ˆb√n|n −1⟩= ˆb+ ˆb+√
n −1√n|n −2⟩
= ˆb+(n −1)√n|n −1⟩=

n2 −n
|n⟩
Anyway, from (a) and (b) we therefore ﬁnd: M
2|n⟩= M

|n⟩⇔n2 = n ⇒n =
0, 1
The thus deﬁned operator M

indeed has only two eigenvalues n = 0 and n =
1.
Consequently, ˆb+|1⟩= 0 , ˆb+|0⟩= |1⟩; ˆb|1⟩= |0⟩; ˆb|0⟩= 0.
Also, ˆb+ ˆb+ ˆb ˆb|n⟩= 0 ∀n.

• Diluted molecular gases: Investigation of rotational energy levels (compare

dV1dV2[ψa(1)ψb(2) ± ψa(2)ψb(1)]2 = 2 ± 2S
From there the necessary normalization factor is obtained.

The value k0 is the k-vector corresponding to E = U0.
Note that for U0 →∞; kL →nπ, which corresponds to the simple rectangular
box potential with box legth L. For a ﬁnite barrier hight and width, both box
potentials correspond with each other via quantum tunneling. The presence of
the barrier with ﬁnite hight U0 leads to a decrease in the position of the energy
levels with respect to each of the single boxes, as well as to their splitting into
two sublevels, corresponding to the symmetric and antisymmetric wavefunctions.
Hereby, the antisymmetric solution corresponds to energy values closer to those
of the simple particle-in-the box task, because in the center of the barrier, the
wavefunction must be zero. Thus, in the antisymmetric case, the probability to
observe the particle within the barrier is smaller than in the case of the symmetric
solution, so the inﬂuence of the barrier is smallest in the antisymmetric case. Note
that the symmetric state corresponds to a smaller energy than the anrisymmetric
one, as earlier discussed in connection with the physics behind covalent bonding.
Practical applications of the investigated model potential concern, for example,
the ammonia molecule. The ammonia molecule has a trigonal pyramidal shape,
with the three hydrogen atoms deﬁning a plane, while the nitrogen atom is placed
outside this plane. The ammonia molecule readily undergoes nitrogen inversion at
room temperature, as an analogy, consider an umbrella turning itself inside out in
a strong wind. The effect is clearly dominated by quantum tunneling, because in
the ammonia case, the “barrier height” U0 (corresponding to an in-plane position
of the nitrogen atom) is 0.4 eV, much higher than the thermal energy at room
temperature.
10.7.4 We start by noting that the potential is inversion symmetric, Hence,
ψ(−x) = ±ψ(x) (compare Sect. 6.6.1). Because of this required symmetry, we
make the following ansatz for the wavefunction:
ψ(x) = C1eβx; x ≤−x0
ψ(x) = C2

13.7.5 (compare L.D. Landau, E.M. Lifshitz: Electrodynamics of continuous
media, Pergamon Press 1960). Let the sphere be centered in the origin of a Carte-
sian coordinate system. Let the ﬁeld E2 be directed along the x-axis. In order to
observe a homogenous ﬁeld E1 in the sphere, the potential ϕ1 in the sphere should
be:
φ1(r) = −E1r
The total ﬁeld outside the sphere is given by the sum of the applied ﬁeld E2
and the ﬁeld of the dipole represented by the sphere. We set:
φ2(r) = −E2r + AE2r
r3 = −E2r

r3 ([L.
D. Landau, E. M. Lifshitz, Klassische Feldtheorie, Akademie-Verlag Berlin, 1976,
p. 113–114]). Once we deal with induced dipoles, it is reasonable setting d∝E2,
which results in the above-mentioned ansatz.
Once the potential is continuous at the border of the sphere, we have:

where n is equal to the refractive index of the ambient medium. This is indicated
by the black and magenta arrows.
• A larger refractive index contrast results in a larger reﬂectance.

MAl
ρAl + Mox

Here M indicates the total mass of the corresponding fraction in the mixture,
and ρ the corresponding mass density. The mass MAl may now be expressed
through the number of aluminum atoms bound in the metal fraction NAl and the
corresponding atomic mass mAl. In the same manner, Mox is given by the num-
ber of Al2O3 units Nox, multiplied with the mass of such a molecular unit mox.
Thereby, the mass of an Al2O3 unit is obviously given by (mO is the mass of an
oxygen atom)
mox = 2m Al + 3mO

The atomic masses as well as the bulk densities for aluminum and alumina (we
take data relevant for corundum for simplicity here) may be found in standard
references. We set:
mO ≈16m p
m Al ≈27m p
ρAl ≈2.7gcm−3
ρox ≈4.0gcm−3
We have not yet used the information about the atomic concentrations. It will
be necessary to ﬁnd the ratio Nox
NAl . Obviously, each Al2O3 unit contributes 2 alu-
minum atoms and 3 oxygen atoms to the atomic concentration. Therefore, the
corresponding number of atoms n in the regarded volume is:
n Al = NAl + 2Nox
nO = 3Nox
From here:

Let us check this expression. Setting nO = 0 (pure aluminum), we immediately
obtain the reasonable result pAl = 1. Setting nO = 3/2 nAl, we have stoichiometric
alumina, and immediately obtain pAl = 0. In a mixture with an average atomic
ratio 50%/50%, we obviously have nO = nAl, and obtain an intermediate volume
ﬁlling factor pAl≈0.282.

Note that if the metal sphere is embedded in a dielectric host different from
vacuum, the resonance condition will change. Instead of (12.20), according to
Sect. 13.6.2, we should now write:
β(ω) = 4πr3 ε(ω) −εh
ε(ω) + 2εh
Then, the resonance condition changes to: ωres =
ωp
√1+2εh .
The localized surface plasmon resonance in a small metal sphere may thus be
tuned by a proper choice of the host medium. The optically denser the host medium
is, the smaller the resonance frequency becomes (immersion effect). When being
surrounded by air (εh ≈1), we again observe the “classical” plasmon resonance

3. Once in noble metals, ωp is usually
located in the UV, the resonance may be tuned into the visible spectral range by
a proper choice of the host medium, which explains the colored appearance of
silver nanocolloids or silver island ﬁlms. The physics behind is in the collective
oscillation of the free electrons within the metal sphere, which creates oscillating
surface charges that are able to interact with external oscillating electric ﬁelds and,
of course, also with the electrons of the embedding medium.

16.7.2 Let us return to the stuff from Sect. 16.6, which needs to be only slightly
modiﬁed in order to solve the task. Thus, once after 6 periods the wavefunction

From ω = 6.15 × 1013 s−1, we obtain ωT = 3.1 × 1013 s−1. Then, from the
Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation (17.13a) we ﬁnd ωL = 5.03 × 1013 s−1.
The ﬁgure below shows the IR reﬂectance as a function of the wavenumber.
Note that whenever the dielectric function is real but negative, the correspond-
ing refractive index is purely imaginary. According to (17.13), this is obviously
the case for angular frequencies between ωT and ωL. Then, according to (13.24),
the reﬂectance at the interface to air must be equal to one. In the ﬁgure, there-
fore, the transversal and longitudinal phonon wavenumbers are well-recognized as
minimum and maximum wavenumber of the prominent high reﬂection band. The
corresponding IR reﬂection feature is called a reststrahlen band. In experimental
practice, this reﬂection feature appears to be smeared out because of the imaginary
part of the dielectric function that has been neglected in our model calculation. For
more realistic reﬂection features see task 13.6.7 again.

17.7.5 This rule may be illustrated in classical terms. Indeed, the transversal
phonons do not create a volume charge density. Therefore, the restoring force
acting on the elongated ions is deﬁned by the bond strength only. In longitudi-
nal phonons, on the contrary, volume charge densities are generated, such that
the restoring force is obtained as a superposition of bond strength and electro-
static attraction between differently charged ions. This leads to an enhancement of
the effective elasticity constant,and consequently to a larger resonance frequency
(compare P. J. Yu, M. Cardona, Fundamentals of semiconductors. Physics and
material properties, 4th edition, Springer 2010, p. 294–295).
17.7.6 Practically, we start with the same modiﬁcations in (17.27) as when
deriving the Lindhard formula in Sect. 17.6. Instead of considering interband tran-
sitions by summarizing over valence band states, we now summarize over occupied
conduction band states and assume that the matrix element for the intraband
transitions is equal to 1 by absolute value. Then, instead of (17.27) we ﬁnd:

m. Of course, at
larger orbital radii, the ﬁeld strength will be smaller.
For the ﬁeld strength in the electromagnetic wave, we use (compare task 2.7.6).
E0,real(in V/m) = 2743

I(in W/cm2) ⇒E0,real ≈1060 V
m, which is much
smaller than any intraatomic ﬁeld strength. For a laser intensity around 1012
Wcm−2, however, we obtain:
E0,real(in V /m) = 2743

I(in W/cm2) ⇒E0,real ≈2.743 × 109 V
m , which
comes much closer to intraatomic orders of magnitude.
18.7.4 I = 0.15 Wcm−2:  ≈8.5 × 107 s−1 < < ωelectr
I = 1012 Wcm−2:  ≈2.5 × 1014 s−1 ~ωelectr
18.7.5 Straightforwardly by substituting n by n + iK in (18.16) and honestly
calculating the real and imaginary parts of ˆn(eff).
