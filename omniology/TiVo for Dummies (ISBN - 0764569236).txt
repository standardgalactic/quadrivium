About the Author
Andy Rathbone started geeking around with computers in 1985 when he
bought a boxy CP/M Kaypro 2X with lime-green letters. Like other budding
nerds, he soon began playing with null-modem adapters, dialing up computer
bulletin boards, and working part-time at Radio Shack. 
In between playing computer games, he served as editor of the Daily Aztec
newspaper at San Diego State University. After graduating with a comparative
literature degree, he went to work for a bizarre underground coffee-table
magazine that sort of disappeared. 
Andy began combining his two main interests, words and computers, by sell-
ing articles to a local computer magazine. During the next few years, he
started ghostwriting computer books for more-famous computer authors, as
well as writing several hundred articles about computers for technoid publi-
cations like Supercomputing Review, CompuServe Magazine, ID Systems,
DataPro, and Shareware.
In 1992, Andy and DOS For Dummies author/legend Dan Gookin teamed up to
write PCs For Dummies. Andy subsequently wrote the award-winning
Windows For Dummies series, MP3 For Dummies, and many other For
Dummies books.
Today, he has more than 15 million copies of his books in print, which have
been translated into more than 30 languages. 
Andy lives with his most-excellent wife, Tina, and their cat in Southern
California. Feel free to drop by his Web site at www.andyrathbone.com.

Introduction
W
elcome to TiVo For Dummies!
Let’s get one thing straight: You’re certainly no dummy. Like most people,
you specialize in a few chosen areas. And, like the rest of us, you occasionally
feel like a dummy when trying to use something unfamiliar. Locating a rental
car’s windshield wiper switch almost always makes me feel like a dummy, for
example.
Because you’ve picked up this book, you probably know something about
TiVo. You may have heard the word or concept, or perhaps seen a friend’s
TiVo in action. You might own a TiVo, and know how to make it do what you
want — sort of.
But you want to know a little bit more. This book helps you, whether you’re
thinking about buying a TiVo, struggling with a TiVo, or just want to use your
TiVo a little more efficiently.
What’s in This Book?
First, here’s what’s not in this book. This book isn’t written for TiVo experts —
people who want to take apart their TiVo, analyze its software construction
and fiddle with its innards. If you’re a TiVo tinkerer, pick up Jeff Keegan’s
Hacking TiVo from Wiley Publishing, Inc., and you’ll find detailed descriptions
of TiVo’s inner workings and workarounds.
This book, by contrast, explains things left out by the advanced books. TiVo
For Dummies starts by explaining the differences between TiVo models, and
how to choose the one that meets your specific needs.
You’ll find out how to set up a new TiVo with your TV, VCR, and other gadgets
clustered around your TV. I explain TiVo’s standard tricks like pausing live TV
shows and playing Instant Replays. You’ll discover ways to record your
shows automatically, even if you’re not sure when they air.

Computer users will enjoy the chapters on TiVo’s Home Media Option, which
lets TiVo connect with your computer to play your music files and view digi-
tal photos. Plus, I’ve stuffed in a bunch of tips that let you take advantage of
everything TiVo’s designed to offer.
And if it’s not enough, I even give a step-by-step explanation of how to
increase your TiVo’s storage space with an easy-to-install hard drive upgrade
kit that’s made specifically for your TiVo model. (The kit even includes any
tools you’ll need to do the job.) 
How to Use This Book
This book is a reference — a collection of informational nuggets, organized
logically so you don’t have to remember anything. (Some of the most fre-
quently accessed information lives on this book’s tear-out “Cheat Sheet.”)
Don’t bother reading this book from cover to cover. Instead, take the pick-
and-choose approach, flipping to the particular part or section containing the
information you need.
People who haven’t purchased their own TiVo yet should start with Part I to
discover their options. (TiVo comes in several models, each with their own
particular flavor.)
TiVo owners might head straight for the Part of Tens to read tips, all orga-
nized into categories like creating recordings, watching live TV, watching
recordings, or figuring out error messages. 
If you’re an advanced TiVo user, jump straight to Chapter 12 to upgrade your
TiVo with a larger hard drive. Imagine storing 60 hours of best-quality record-
ings on your TiVo!
When you find something you like, feel free to dog-ear the page or highlight
the section with a marker. Then keep this book near your TiVo or its remote
so you can flip to the most appropriate section, read the information, then
close the book and keep watching.
Don’t Read These Parts
Please stay away from certain parts of this book. Ignore them completely.
Should you ever need them, they’ll reveal themselves at the right time.

TiVo For Dummies 

That’s because anything marked with the Technical Stuff icon usually con-
tains “engineers” talk. That stuff is for people who pride themselves on taking
their TiVo to another level; sometimes by choice, other times because they
simply didn’t want to pay the repairman.
Sometimes I’ve added information that only makes sense after you’ve been
using TiVo for awhile. Until you’ve reached the point where a few key words
catch your eye, please feel free to skip right over them.
How This Book is Organized
I’ve divided this book into five parts, each dealing with a certain theme. I’ve
broken down each part into three or more chapters dealing with specific TiVo
information relating to that part’s theme. Here’s the rundown on what you’ll
find in each one.
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . .
Don’t have a TiVo sitting by your TV yet? Start here to discover exactly what
a TiVo is — the concept, the things TiVo can do, why you’d want TiVo to do
them, and the things TiVo can’t do.
After helping you choose the right one, this part of the book guides you
through hooking it up to your TV or home theater, weaving the cords through
VCRs, telephones, and other audio-visual exotica.
No telephone line jack nearby? I’ll even divulge a trick or two to slip you past
that requirement, if necessary.
Part II: Using the TiVo
Once you’ve connected TiVo to your TV, this part of the book explains how to
acclimate TiVo to its new surroundings. It explains how to run TiVo through
its Guided Setup, telling it what channels you receive (while weeding out
shopping channels and other detritus).
Another chapter lets you start playing tricks while watching live TV, rewind-
ing to catch missed snippets, and watching slow-motion replays of fumbles,
explosions, or whatever else flashed by too quickly.

The next chapter guides you through telling TiVo about your favorite pro-
grams, actors, directors and subjects, allowing TiVo to automatically grab
them whenever they may air. 
Once you grow comfortable watching TiVo’s recorded shows, a chapter
explains how to fine-tune TiVo’s performance, adjusting recording schedules
so everything fits to best advantage.
Part III: The Home Media Option
People who enjoy their home computer will enjoy TiVo’s Home Media Option
(HMO), and this part of the book explains how to connect TiVo to your home
computer. When set up, TiVo’s HMO lets you access your computer’s good
stuff — your stash of digital photos and music — and play it on your TV or
home stereo. No more crowding around the computer monitor to show off
vacation photos!
This section also explains how to make TiVo record those “can’t miss shows”
you just heard about around the office water cooler — even if you’re still at
the office (or anywhere there’s an Internet connection). Log on to the Internet
from any computer and send TiVo your recording instructions.
If you’re not already listening to Internet Radio stations on your home stereo,
you’ll be listening to them once you read this part of the book.
Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo
Sometimes your TiVo’s too good — it finds so much good stuff, it runs out of
room to store it all. A chapter here explains how to order and install a “TiVo-
Ready” hard drive, custom made for your particular model. Upgrade your
TiVo to 200 hours, and avoid future family fallouts.
And although you may never need it, a chapter explains how to fix any odd
problems you may experience. (With TiVo — not yourself. That’s a different
book.)
Part V: The Part of Tens
Nothing but tips here — long lists of tips for using TiVo more quickly and effi-
ciently. Flip here on occasion just to make sure you’re using TiVo to its fullest.

Icons Used in This Book
This book uses the trademarked “For Dummies” icons you’ve seen in count-
less books for the past decade. Here’s a look at the ones I’ve used in this
book, and what they mean.
When you spot this icon, look closely at the nearby tip: an informational
nugget that helps you use TiVo more quickly or efficiently.
Try to remember these paragraphs, as you’ll find yourself using this informa-
tion repeatedly. (Simply reading the rest of this book is good enough.)
My father, a specialist in electronics measurements, built oscilloscopes in the
garage. More than a bit of that rubbed off onto me, and now I build robots in
my spare time. This icon gives fair warning to lift your eyes from the accom-
panying TiVo technospeak that follows.
Stop! Please don’t do what you’re reading about in this paragraph. Anything
marked by this icon can damage TiVo, yourself, or the living room carpet. Be
very careful here.
NOTE: You’ll also find smaller icons in the margins that match the buttons
found on TiVo’s remote. When the paragraph calls for you to press a particu-
lar button on TiVo’s remote, that button appears in the margin for reference.
Where to Go from Here
Only you know how far down the road you’ve driven with TiVo. You might
want to begin browsing the tips at the very end or jumping to more full-blown
explanations referenced elsewhere in the book. If you’re relatively new to
TiVo, start poking around near the beginning to clear up some common TiVo
head-scratchers.
But no matter where you are on your TiVo journey, this book’s in the glove
box, ready to show you the way.

Part I
Before Buying
Your TiVo . . .

In this part . . .
You’ve probably heard quite a few things about TiVo.
Writers mention it in newspapers and magazines. TV
characters discuss it while the plot unfolds. You’ll even
start to notice your friends mumbling about how it changes
their life — usually when they’re forced to watch commer-
cials at somebody’s house. Lucky audience members of
Oprah or Rosie O’Donnell even found free TiVos in their
“take-home” bags.
What is this “TiVo” that people speak of, and how could it
possibly change your life? Does your life really need
changing? If you take the plunge, which TiVo should you
buy? And how do you hook the darn thing up, anyway?
This section answers those questions and many more.

Chapter 1
Knowing the TiVo
In This Chapter
 Understanding how TiVo changes TV
 Understanding how TiVo changes its owner
 Understanding TiVo’s limitations
 Recognizing TiVo’s appearance
U
ntil you’ve seen TiVo in action, you can’t quite understand all the
hubbub. Isn’t a “TiVo” just a glorified VCR? Everybody already has a
VCR; nothing new here, move along. Yet people aren’t moving along. If they’re
not buying the thing, they’re hearing other people talk about it.
Jay Leno and David Letterman talk about “TiVoing” favorite TV shows. The
word “TiVo” pops up in newspapers and magazines with increasing fre-
quency. And if you’re unlucky enough to meet a TiVo owner at a party, it’s
time to toddle off to the bar: TiVo owners can’t stop themselves from singing
TiVo’s praises. What’s all the fuss about?
Much to the dismay of TiVo’s marketing department, it’s quite difficult to
explain a TiVo in a few short words, or even a 30-second TV spot. To help
clear things up, this entire chapter explains what TiVo does well, where it
sometimes misses the mark, and just what the darn thing looks like, anyway.
Finally, you’ll understand why TiVo owners (myself included) can’t seem to
stop raving about the darn things.
Pausing Live TV
Your friends take their seats, the show begins, and, a few minutes later, the
pizza man rings the doorbell. Who misses the show to fetch the pizza? With
TiVo, nobody misses anything. A press of the TiVo remote’s pause button
freezes the screen, flicker-free, until you return, pizza in hand.

Pausing a live TV show certainly isn’t TiVo’s most-used feature, but it’s proba-
bly the easiest to understand. Armchair philosophers, however, may ask,
“How can TiVo pause the reality of a live TV show?”
It’s easy. TiVo never really displays “live TV.” TiVo constantly records what-
ever channel you’re watching. Even when you watch “live” TV, you’re actually
seeing TiVo’s recording, which appears onscreen about one second after the
show reaches everybody else’s TV screens.
 Pressing the Pause button merely freezes the display; TiVo continues to
record the show in the background. Push the Pause button again, and
TiVo starts playing its recording again, right where you left off. 
 If you paused the show for three minutes, for example, your viewing of
the show would extend to three minutes after the real show ended.
 After returning to watch a paused live TV show, most TiVo users actually
look forward to the commercials. When the hucksters appear, press the
remote’s Fast-Forward button to skip quickly through the commercials,
eventually catching up to “real time” — one second behind the show’s
actual broadcast.
 Chances are, the pizza delivery guy doesn’t miss the show, either. His
TiVo records it while he’s working.
 If you don’t return to the paused show within 30 minutes, you begin
missing part of the show. After 30 minutes, TiVo starts playing the show
from where it paused. If you think you’ll be away for more than 30 min-
utes, and you really want to see all of the show, press the remote’s
Record button before standing up. TiVo courteously saves the rest of the
show for you to watch at your leisure.
 After owning a TiVo, most people avoid watching live TV. There’s just no
more use for it. The TiVo’s already recorded the good stuff, and you
could be watching that, instead.
Controlling Your Own Instant Replays
Sports fans love watching an “Instant Replay.” During a football game, for
instance, the network’s Instant Replay lets everybody see who dropped the
ball, why, and who’s now lying on top of it. TiVo borrows the power of Instant
Replay from the networks and passes it into your own hands. You can see an
Instant Replay of anything you’re watching, any time you want.
10
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 

When something exciting happens onscreen, push the TiVo remote’s “Instant
Replay” button. TiVo instantly rewinds eight seconds and starts playing, let-
ting you watch the past eight seconds again.
Didn’t jump back far enough? Push the Instant Replay button twice to jump
back 16 seconds. If the action happens too fast to see what’s going on, push
the Pause button, then push the Fast-Forward button to move through the
sequence frame by frame.
Although I don’t watch much sports, I use Instant Replay after one of my
wife’s loud belches to catch missed dialogue. It’s great for moving through
explosions, frame by frame. Movie buffs will enjoy exploring intimate details
of a director’s composition, figuring out exactly when they cut to a new scene
and why.
11
Chapter 1: Knowing the TiVo
What’s the difference between a DVR, 
a PVR, and a TiVo?
Bobbing in the crowded Sea of Acronyms, the
initials DVR stand for Digital Video Recorder.
PVR stands for Personal Video Recorder. Both
mean pretty much the same thing: a gadget
that records television shows onto a hard
drive — just like the ones used by computers —
making recordings quick, easy, and much more
accessible.
A TiVo is a special breed of DVR/PVR. It records
shows onto a hard drive, but it also makes intelli-
gent decisions, saving you a lot of grunt work. For
example, TiVo offers things like a “Season Pass,”
where it automatically seeks out and records all
episodes of a TV show, regardless of when they
air. Items placed in TiVo’s “WishList” — actors,
directors, subjects, or titles — can be recorded
automatically, whenever they air.
In short, TiVo is a DVR/PVR, but not all DVR/PVRs
sport TiVo’s intelligent features. Some make you
schedule recordings manually, for instance, by
entering a show’s channel, date, and starting/
ending times. TiVo handles those tasks auto-
matically, requiring nothing more than a show’s
name.
Some technologists pinpoint the difference
between DVR and PVR to the machine’s IQ. A
TiVo is a Personal Video Recorder, because it
adjusts to your personal tastes by automatically
recording your favorite shows. A Digital Video
Recorder, by contrast, merely records shows
onto a hard drive: You still need to tell the dumb
thing what date, time and channel you want to
record, just like a VCR.

 Fans of movie “bloopers” love TiVo. If you’re watching “Titanic,” for
instance, watch closely to see the guy with the digital watch get into the
lifeboat. (The Titanic sank in 1912.)
 Instant Reply comes in handy when you return to a paused show.
Watching the last eight seconds brings you right back into the action.
 You don’t miss any of your show by using Instant Replay, even when
watching live TV. Pushing the button simply makes the show begin play-
ing again eight seconds from the time you pushed it. (Each time you
push the button, your show ends another eight seconds later.)
Putting Your Television to Work
TiVo works as your robotic television manager, constantly scanning upcoming
show listings to separate your favorites from the trash. It juggles the recordings
to avoid possible overlaps, and it saves the good stuff until you’re ready to
watch it.
Simply put, TiVo makes you the boss of your television. You’re no longer at
the mercy of the networks, their rigid scheduling, and their loud commercials.
You no longer have to watch “whatever’s on” when you sit down. Your TiVo
insulates you from the bad aspects of TV, catching only the good.
12
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 
Why buy TiVo when I don’t watch TV?
It’s easy to see why so many people don’t watch
TV. There’s rarely anything good to watch. Why
buy a TiVo when there’s nothing to watch?
Look at it this way. Let’s say 99.9 percent of TV is
awful, leaving just one or two thoughtful, intelli-
gent shows. Most homes have at least 50 chan-
nels available. That means 1,200 hours of
television programming flows unwatched
through your home every day. If TiVo grabs just
.1 percent, it’s still collecting at least an hour of
good stuff every day.
Think about it. You’re bound to be interested in
something. Tell TiVo about it. It doesn’t care if it’s
on some obscure channel during the wee
hours. Whenever anything flows by that meets
your interests, TiVo grabs it.
Then, whenever you decide to watch TV, you’ll
find something good waiting for you. TiVo found
it, bagged it, and has it waiting for when you’re
ready to watch it.

It’s surprisingly easy how TiVo does this. You select names from a list, telling
TiVo your favorite show titles, movie titles, actors, directors, or subjects.
With a few pokes on the remote, you can even type in subjects like “parrots”
or “James Bond.” TiVo scours the show listings for the next two weeks, auto-
matically scheduling and recording shows that match your interests.
TiVo immediately tunes to the right channel at the right time — unattended —
and records your show. It repeats the process as often as needed to record
whatever you want.
When you feel like watching TV, you choose from TiVo’s list of recorded
shows — shows you know you’ll enjoy.
 I explain how to automatically record your favorite shows in Chapter 6.
 If a sneaky network bumps your favorite sitcom from Wednesday to
Thursday for some reason, don’t worry: TiVo still grabs it. It knows
these things.
 If the network preempts your show because of a late-running ball game,
TiVo grabs the late-running ball game. (Of course, everybody else also
missed the show, so you don’t feel so bad. TiVo will still catch your
unwatched show when it repeats, though.)
 After awhile, the concept of watching live TV will seem foreign and out-
dated. You’ll forget when your favorite shows air, because you no longer
care: That’s TiVo’s job.
 If you arrive home 20 minutes after a favorite show started — and you’ve
told TiVo to record it for you — you can watch the show as soon as you
walk in the door. TiVo plays the show from its beginning for you, all the
while continuing to record the rest of the show.
 TiVo substantially lowers your movie rental tab. Why rent a movie when
your TV is filled with so many movies you already want to watch? It no
longer matters that the good films aired at 4 a.m. — TiVo stayed awake
to record them for you. (And you no longer must remember to put in a
videotape; TiVo never needs them.)
Zipping Past the Commercials
TiVo’s remote comes with Fast-Forward and Rewind buttons, just like the
ones on a VCR’s remote. Unlike a VCR and its slow and awkward tapes, TiVo
records everything on its hard drive — just like the one inside a computer.
13
Chapter 1: Knowing the TiVo

That makes it much faster to fast-forward through those intrusive bits of non-
sense called commercials. Whenever a commercial begins, press TiVo’s Fast-
Forward button. When you spot your show playing on the screen, push the
Play button. TiVo backs up a bit, and begins playing your show from when
the commercials stopped.
 Skipping commercials often reduces a one-hour TV show to just 40 min-
utes. You don’t even need commercials for bathroom breaks: Just pause
the show when the need arises. Or when the phone rings. Or the baby
cries. Or the cat wants inside. And outside. And inside again.
 You can still watch commercials, if you want, especially the funny ones
during the Super Bowl. TiVo doesn’t edit them out. It just lets you skip
past them very, very quickly when you want. (With TiVo’s three-speed
Fast-Forward button, a 60-second commercial blasts past in a second
or two.)
 The Fast-Forward button also works great for skipping the boring parts of
movies, political debates, and talk shows. When watching Saturday Night
Live, for instance, it’s easy to zip ahead to the next sketch or musical
guest.
14
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 
My TiVo Spies on Me!
TiVo, Inc. collects something it calls “Anonymous
Viewing Information,” and that bothers some
people. Anonymous Viewing Information means
TiVo collects all your remote’s actions and
sends them off to TiVo, Inc. The corporation, in
turn, knows what you’ve watched, and what
you’ve recorded. It also knows what you’ve
paused, what you’ve rewound, and what you’ve
watched frame by frame in slow motion.
However, the corporation doesn’t link these inti-
mate viewing details to your name, household,
or address. Instead, they lump everybody’s data
into general geographic locations — Zip Codes,
for instance. That lets TiVo’s PR department
announce things like, “During last night’s
Academy Awards, 1,263 TiVo viewers in Dorset,
Vermont, used Instant Replay when Madonna
tripped.”
Although I’m a privacy advocate, I like TiVo’s
approach. I prefer to let them know exactly
what I watch. Hopefully, the broadcasters will
take notice, stop canceling my favorite shows,
and begin scheduling more stuff that matches
my interests. I view it as casting an anonymous
vote for my favorite TV shows. TiVo already sup-
plements Nielsen’s ratings, providing an easy
way to gauge a show’s popularity.
If you feel this invades your privacy, however,
tell TiVo to knock it off by calling (877) FOR-TIVO;
they’ll remove you from their list. You’ll find more
information about TiVo and your privacy on
the company’s Web site at www.tivo.com/
privacy.

TiVo’s Sweet Little Gifts
After TiVo knows your interests, the friendly box begins leaving you little pre-
sents. It works like this: Unless you’re recording a weekend marathon of back-
to-back Simpsons episodes, TiVo usually has some leftover space on its hard
drive. Eager to please, TiVo fills that empty space with shows it thinks you
might enjoy, based on the shows you’re currently recording.
After you watch a Western or two, for example, TiVo may record a few extra
cowboy films in the hopes you’ll enjoy them. Watching a lot of Audrey
Hepburn? You may find several of her other movies on your Now Playing list.
 TiVo records suggestions only if there’s room. If it’s already stuffed
full with shows you’ve told it to record, TiVo stifles its urge to record
suggestions.
 When your hard drive fills up and TiVo needs more room to record your
favorite shows, TiVo starts housecleaning by automatically deleting any
suggestions to free up space.
 TiVo’s remote contains a “Thumbs Up” and a “Thumbs Down” button.
If you remember, use these buttons to rate shows you’ve watched. The
more you use the “Thumbs” buttons, the better TiVo knows you, leading
to more accurate Suggestions.
 If TiVo doesn’t seem to know the real you, I explain how to nudge TiVo’s
suggestions in the right direction in Chapter 11.
TiVo and Your Home Computer
Many people try to avoid computers. Others prefer intimate contact, setting
up Web sites to constantly monitor their hot tub’s temperature. TiVo’s happy
to oblige computer enthusiasts with its “Home Media Option.”
The Home Media Option (HMO), available for an additional fee, lets you con-
nect your TiVo to your computer, often through a wireless connection. With
TiVo connected to your computer through HMO, you can settle into your
favorite armchair and view all your digital photos on TV, even though they’re
still stored on your computer. You can hear any computer music files through
your TiVo, as well — and the music files sound fantastic when hooked to the
home stereo, by the way. If you own two TiVos, you can even transfer shows
from one TiVo to another.
15
Chapter 1: Knowing the TiVo

I explain how to use the Home Media Option to your best advantage — and
stretch it to its limits — in Chapters 8 and 9. (No, you can’t send shows to a
friend’s TiVo, just to your own TiVos.)
Saving Shows to VCR or DVD Burner
If you and your VCR are inseparable, TiVo teams up with it fairly well. When
TiVo records a show that you absolutely must add to your videotape cabinet,
choose TiVo’s Save to VCR option, described in Chapter 6. When TiVo begins
playing back your show for the VCR, neatly displaying the show’s name in a
black stripe along the bottom, press the VCR’s Record button.
No, TiVo won’t edit out the commercials, but you can do that yourself, if you
baby-sit your VCR’s Pause button during the recording process.
Sony brand TiVos mind-meld with Sony VCRs: Pressing the Save to VCR option
makes TiVo turn on your VCR, automatically record the show, and turn off the
VCR when it’s through. (You still have to put the tape inside yourself.)
Some TiVo models include a built-in DVD recorder, letting you save your shows
to a DVD just as easily. I discuss different TiVo models in Chapter 2. TiVo can
send shows to a portable DVD burner just as easily as a VCR; TiVo neither
knows nor cares that you’re connecting a DVD burner instead of a VCR.
Just What Does TiVo Look Like?
For such a powerful robot, TiVo wouldn’t win any battlebot matches. As you
can see in Figure 1-1, the typical TiVo is simply a rectangular box, much like
a small VCR. Instead of a VCR’s slot, clock, and buttons, most TiVo models
sport a single pair of tiny lights on the front. The green light means it’s cur-
rently plugged in; a red light means it’s currently recording. You control
everything with the remote, shown in Figure 1-2.
Things are more interesting around the back. There, you’ll spot a dozen or so
connectors sprouting from the case, ready to accommodate a barrage of
sound, video, and TV cables. I show more detailed views in Chapter 2 and
explain what cable plugs in where.
TiVo is actually two things, as described more fully in the next chapter. The
TiVo box, sold in most stereo stores, and the TiVo Service, which supplies
your TiVo with the station listings in your area.

Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 

The TiVo Service requires a monthly fee to grab and sort through your per-
sonalized channel listings. Prices vary according to your particular TiVo
model. (Many TiVo models offer “Lifetime” subscriptions where you pay up
front to avoid the monthly fee.)

thrift shop.
18
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 
What Can’t TiVo Do?
Although TiVo works very well as your personal
television manager, some tasks remain beyond
its reach. This should clear up some of the more
common TiVo misconceptions.
TiVo can’t record TiVo shows from the past. My
friend Jim called the other night, asking if I could
use my TiVo to watch a show that ran two nights
ago. Nope. TiVo can record shows currently
airing, and it will schedule recordings for shows
airing in the future, but not even a TiVo can pull
things out of the past. However, if you enter
a few descriptive words about the show — its
title, for instance, or the actors’ names — TiVo
can often catch a rerun.
TiVo can record only channels that you already
receive. TiVo isn’t a source of television shows.
It simply sifts through the shows you already
receive, automatically recording the ones you
want and ignoring the ones you don’t. You still
need a TV signal, whether it comes from an
antenna, cable, or satellite box.
TiVo can’t simultaneously record two TV shows.
Unless you’re receiving DirecTV satellite broad-
casts with a DirecTV model of TiVo, you can’t
record two shows simultaneously. However,
with a bit of installation trickery (covered in
Chapter 2), you can record one show while
you’re watching another live show on a differ-
ent channel. (TiVo always lets you watch any
previously recorded show as it records a new
show in the background.)
Not all TiVos record HDTV. Most TiVos can’t
store High Definition TV signals. At the time of
this writing, only a few newer models of
DirecTV TiVos can record and play back HDTV
programming.
TiVo can’t send video to your computer. Even
with the Home Media Option, TiVo doesn’t pro-
vide a way to send your TV shows to your com-
puter. And currently it won’t play video from
your computer, either. TiVo’s new “TiVo to Go”
feature, however, plans to add this option. You’ll
find more information about it at TiVo’s Web site
(www.tivo.com).
TiVo doesn’t work worldwide. Currently, TiVo
works only with U.S. and U.K. programming.
(TiVos are no longer manufactured for the U.K.
market, but TiVo service remains available for
customers who bought one.) United Kingdom
TiVo information awaits you at uk.tivo.com.
TiVo isn’t available in Canada, unfortunately, but
they still have better beer.

Buying the Right TiVo Model
In This Chapter
 Knowing the difference between the TiVo box and TiVo Service
 Understanding TiVo’s service plan
 Understanding different TiVo models
 Purchasing the right TiVo for your needs
T
iVo comes in two parts: the boring box and the service that makes it
work. The “TiVo” is simply the boring container. A box harnessed to your
TV with cables. Most TiVos have no buttons, slots, or blinking time displays.
The TiVo Service, by contrast, does all the work. A combination of software
and computer, the TiVo Service automatically fetches and sorts your upcom-
ing TV listings, separating the wheat from the chaff to suit your own tastes.
TiVo charges money for its harvesting service. (Hopefully the salesperson
explained this fee before you pulled out your charge card.)
This chapter describes the different models of TiVo boxes you’re likely to
spot on the store shelves. It also reveals intimate details about the TiVo
Service and the grunt work it performs behind your back.
What Your TiVo Needs
When you decide to buy a car, you don’t simply drive home in a new Porsche
convertible. You know to plan ahead for auto insurance, registration fees,
gas, and a cool hat with a chin strap.
TiVo also requires a few accessories, but its needs are much more modest.
Here’s exactly what you’ll need to convert fully to the TiVo lifestyle:

20
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 
 The TiVo box. When you buy a TiVo, this is what you take home.
Many places sell TiVos. Some folks buy online directly from TiVo
(www.tivo.com). Others shop at major consumer electronics stores
(Best Buy, Circuit City), as well as Internet vendors. (I bought mine
through Amazon at www.amazon.com.)
 The TiVo Service. Once you’ve set up your new TiVo, you must buy the
TiVo Service directly from TiVo by paying a monthly subscription fee.
(Paying a lump sum up front eliminates the monthly payment.) Without
the TiVo Service, TiVo sits like a Porsche with no engine: non-functional,
yet full of promise. (DirecTV always charges a monthly fee for its TiVos;
it doesn’t offer a Lifetime Subscription.)
 A phone line. Each day, TiVo briefly phones TiVo headquarters to fetch
your region’s updated program listings. That means your new TiVo
needs a phone jack within 25 feet. (It shares your existing phone line.)
Computer jockeys with broadband Internet service can connect TiVo to
their computer, which I describe in Chapter 8. TiVo then grabs your TV
listings through the Internet, bypassing your telephone forever. (DirecTV
doesn’t offer this option for its own TiVo models.)
 A television and television signal. Television broadcasts enter your
house through a satellite service, a cable company, or even an antenna
on your TV. (If you can watch shows on your TV now, you already have
this, so TiVo will work.)
 A power outlet. TiVo requires electricity, ruling it out for tent campers.
 Don’t buy any extra cables along with your new TiVo. The TiVo box
includes a thick pack of high-quality cables that meet nearly every con-
figuration. (Avoid those ultra-expensive brand-name cables that commis-
sion-based salespeople rave about.) The remote even comes with its
own pack of batteries.
 Some people fret about finding a telephone jack close enough to their
TiVo. The TiVo’s bundled 25-foot phone cord would let a giraffe talk on
the phone. Extra tall giraffes, however, can purchase much longer phone
cords from Radio Shack, as well as wireless phone jacks designed for
computers that work fine with TiVo. (I cover these in Chapter 3.)
Paying for the TiVo Service
The TiVo Service works the same way, no matter what TiVo model you buy.
(See the “What’s TiVo Basic?” sidebar for the exception.) The TiVo Service

21
Chapter 2: Buying the Right TiVo Model
automatically grabs the upcoming two weeks of listings for every show your
TV can receive. It then compares that list with the shows you want to watch,
and magically juggles all the recordings, trying to avoid scheduling conflicts.
Like most juggling magicians, TiVo charges for its service. Signing up for the
TiVo Service, also known as “Activating” your TiVo, simply involves typing in
your credit card number. Shortly after you plug in your TiVo, it will remind
you about the service with the nag screen shown in Figure 2-1.
At the time of this writing, the TiVo Service requires a monthly fee of $12.95. If
you own two TiVos, you pay two monthly fees. DirecTV models of TiVo are
designed specifically to work with DirecTV satellite service, and their service
fee is $4.95 each month, regardless of how many DirecTV TiVos you own.
Either way, TiVo places its monthly charge on your credit card.
The wealthy folks can opt for an escape hatch: Paying $299 up front buys a
“Lifetime Subscription” for your TiVo. TiVos with “Lifetime Subscriptions”
never require a monthly fee.

 A few pokes on a calculator show that a $299 subscription fee equals
about 23 months of $12.95 payments. If you plan to keep TiVo more than
two years (and you will), paying $299 is a better deal: It’s completely
paid off, and you won’t be stuck with monthly fees. If you live paycheck-
to-paycheck, stick with the monthly fee.
 And if you don’t pay the Service Fee? Your TiVo won’t work. Actually, it
still works well at nagging you to pay, but don’t expect anything more.
 The Lifetime Subscription is tied to the life of your TiVo, not you. If you
ever sell your TiVo, the lucky buyer receives the Lifetime Subscription
along with it. Price it accordingly.
 Did your new, Lifetime Subscription TiVo die within warranty? Your
heartbreak earns you a break: TiVo lets you transfer the dead TiVo’s
Lifetime Subscription to your replacement TiVo when repaired through
an authorized service center. Make the transfer through TiVo’s Web site
(www.tivo.com/manage) or by calling TiVo Customer Support
(1-877-367-8486).
 Bought a second TiVo? You must pay the monthly service fee, or pur-
chase a second, separate Lifetime Subscription for it.
 Series 2 TiVos don’t work at all without the TiVo Service. But the older
“Series 1” TiVos limp along by letting you schedule recordings manually,
entering the date, time, channel, and recording length of desired shows.
Without a subscription, the “Series 1” TiVo’s internal clock slowly loses
What’s “TiVo Basic” service?
The TiVo corporation lets some companies sell a
“watered-down” version of TiVo to include with
products like DVD players and recorders. Like its
name, TiVo Basic offers basic recording features:
Hard drive recording, fast-forwarding, rewinding
and pausing live TV, and manually scheduling
recordings up to three days in advance.
TiVo Basic users may upgrade to the regular TiVo
Service (referred to as “TiVo Plus”) by paying the
standard subscription fees. Once subscribed,
they can search for shows by title or subject,
record their favorite shows automatically with
a Season Pass, receive TiVo’s suggestions —
the usual fare expected of TiVos.
(TiVo’s Home Media Option, covered in Chapter
8, never comes free, no matter what plan or
planet you’re on.)

accuracy, leading to missed recording times. (Telling the Series 1 TiVo to
make a daily call often resets the clock, but nothing more.) For more info
on the differences between Series 1 and Series 2 TiVos, see the
“Standalone TiVo” section, later in this chapter.
 A Lifetime Subscription links to the TiVo’s motherboard. You can replace
or upgrade your TiVo’s other parts (covered in Chapter 12) and still
keep your subscription valid. But if your TiVo’s motherboard dies, its
Lifetime Subscription dies along with it.
How the TiVo Service works its magic
The TiVo Service tells your TiVo to make a daily call to TiVo headquarters to
keep your show listings up to date for the next two weeks or so.
While visiting, TiVo performs the following tasks, usually taking less than five
minutes:
 It checks your subscription information. Haven’t paid? TiVo turns off
most of its features until you’re paid up again. (You can continue to
watch any shows you’ve already recorded, though.)
 It resets its clock. The TiVo needs a very accurate clock in order to
record your shows at the correct times.
 It grabs show listings up to 14 days in advance, also fetching any soft-
ware updates or messages from the TiVo company. If a broadcaster has
changed a show’s air time or date, TiVo takes note and reschedules its
recording times accordingly.
 After removing any personally identifiable information, TiVo tells the
company what you’ve been watching. (If this strikes you as creepy,
Chapter 1 explains how to make it stop.)
When done swapping information with headquarters, TiVo hangs up and its
software takes over, sorting all the new show listings and meticulously com-
paring them with your own list of favorite shows. Finally, TiVo figures out the
best way to record them all, trying various combinations to avoid overlap-
ping shows as best as possible.
All this activity happens in the background; you never notice it. Even while
performing all these chores, TiVo still manages to record your scheduled
shows, play back recorded shows on request, or even record and play back
at the same time.

Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 
How can I steal the TiVo Service?
It’s quite difficult to get the TiVo Service without paying for it. And unlike
most taboo items discussed in the Internet’s dark alleyways, this topic rarely
pops up. That’s because most TiVo owners want TiVo to survive as a company.
They enjoy what TiVo provides and want to help the company, not harm it.
I researched this subject while writing this book; most people who’ve tried to
fool TiVo into working without a subscription found the process too cumber-
some to be worth the effort.
The TiVo Box
Many different manufacturers sell TiVo, each model featuring its own bells
and whistles. You’ll see older, first-generation TiVos known as “Series 1,” the
newer “Series 2” TiVos, TiVos designed specifically for satellite reception
through DirecTV, and a new mix of consumer gadgets that incorporate TiVo.
Here’s a rundown on what you’ll find when shopping for TiVo.
The big difference between DirecTV 
and standalone TiVos
A standalone TiVo works with any type of TV
signal. It translates the sound and video from
the incoming channel into numbers, and it
stores the numbers on its hard drive. When you
watch a show, the TiVo translates the hard
drive’s numbers back into the channel’s sound
and video, and it sends the information to your
TV set.
A DirecTV TiVo, by contrast, stuffs a TiVo inside
a satellite box. TiVo records the satellite’s
incoming numbers directly onto the hard drive —
there’s nothing to convert. Later, when you want
to watch a show, the satellite box translates the
TiVo’s numbers into the appropriate sound and
video for your TV. Because the DirecTV TiVo
records exactly what the satellite sent, it can
preserve Dolby 5.1 surround sound and HDTV
broadcasts for your TV.
Standalone models are stuck with the chores of
turning the TV signals into numbers for storage
and then turning the numbers back into TV sig-
nals for your TV. During this extra conversion
process, they lose surround sound and HDTV
information.
Since DirecTV TiVos aren’t as closely linked to
the TiVo Corporation as the standalone models,
they lack some of the features. They can’t use
the Home Media Option, for instance, as well as
some of the more advanced software found in
the standalone models.

25
Chapter 2: Buying the Right TiVo Model
Standalone TiVo
A “standalone” TiVo refers to any TiVo that isn’t designed specifically for satel-
lite reception with DirecTV. Instead, standalone TiVos work mostly with cable
hookups and TV antennas. Actually, these versatile little beasts can still work
with satellite systems, they just won’t take advantage of satellite-specific fea-
tures. (For more on satellite TiVos, see “DirecTV TiVos,” later in this section.) 
Series 1 TiVo
No longer sold new, Series 1 TiVos still pop up at garage sales, on eBay, and
through other used-goods outlets. Here are the main differences between
these older standalone TiVos and the newer models: 
 Size. Series 1 TiVos are a little bulky, making them harder to balance
atop a TV set or hide on the bookshelf.
 Speed. Just as new computers run faster and more powerfully than
their predecessors, Series 1 TiVos are slower than newer models.
(Computer people might note that the Series 1 TiVos have a slower
CPU and less RAM.)
 Software. Series 1 TiVos lack some popular software enhancements
found in Series 2 models. Shows can’t be grouped into convenient
onscreen folders, for instance.
 Networking. Only Series 2 TiVos offer the Home Media Option (HMO).
That option allows TiVo to communicate with your home computer, dis-
playing your digital photos and playing your MP3 files. Once connected,
TiVo grabs show schedules through the Internet instead of by telephone.
Without a subscription, a Series 1 TiVo can still pause live TV, fast-forward,
and rewind, but it won’t record shows automatically. To record a show, you
must manually enter the correct channel and recording time.
Some tech-savvy people actually prefer Series 1 TiVos because they’re easier
to take apart and fiddle with. These tinkerers write their own “add-on” soft-
ware to make their TiVos do oddball things like display a stock ticker along
the bottom of a televised football game. If this stuff appeals to you, check out
Jeff Keegan’s thick green book, Hacking TiVo, from Wiley Publishing, Inc.
All TiVos run the Linux operating system, not the more widespread operating
systems like Windows. If you’re itching to hack your TiVo, a Linux background
comes in very handy.

26
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 
Series 2 TiVo
All TiVos sold today are considered “Series 2” models, as shown in Figure 2-2.
Faster, more versatile, and with more features than their predecessors, Series
2 TiVos also contain two USB ports for hooking up to a computer. Only Series
2 TiVos work with TiVo’s Home Media Option, described in Chapter 8, which
lets users schedule upcoming recordings over the Internet, among other perks.
Series 2 TiVos can’t record HDTV broadcasts, and they water down Dolby
Digital 5.1 sound to stereo, but they offer more features and recording capac-
ity than their predecessors. You’ll probably be much happier with a Series 2
TiVo than a Series 1 TiVo.
DirecTV TiVos
If you receive your TV programs from the DirecTV satellite service, you’ll prob-
ably want a “DirecTV TiVo,” officially known as a DirecTV Receiver with TiVo
Service. These models record shows in slightly different ways than other TiVos.
For instance, a DirecTV TiVo contains two tuners. So? That means you can
simultaneously record two live shows on different channels. Or, you can
record one channel while watching a different live channel.
Figure 2-2:

27
Chapter 2: Buying the Right TiVo Model
All DirecTV TiVos can also record shows broadcast with Dolby Digital 5.1
sound; some models record HDTV, as well. 
On the down side, DirecTV TiVos work only with DirecTV’s satellite source.
Standalone TiVos, by contrast, work with any signal source. If you stop sub-
scribing to DirecTV’s satellite service and switch to cable, your DirecTV TiVo
won’t work.
Because of their different circuitry and distribution, DirecTV TiVos come with
reduced subscription plans.
DVD Player/Recorder TiVos 
As the TiVo corporation grows, it stuffs its TiVo Service into a range of gad-
gets. Toshiba, for instance, wraps a DVD/CD player around a TiVo. Shown in
Figure 2-3, the Toshiba’s SDH400 plays DVDs, CDs, and MP3 files. Its “embed-
ded TiVo” records up to 80 hours of television on a hard drive. The unit
includes TiVo Basic service, upgradeable to standard “TiVo Plus” service. It
can be upgraded with the Home Media Option, as well.
Pioneer went further and created a pair of dream TiVos that not only play
DVDs, but record them as well. Owners can create DVD libraries of their
favorite shows. The Pioneer Elite DVR-57H, shown in Figure 2-4, stores 120
hours of shows; another Pioneer model stores 80 hours. Both models record
shows that will play back on any DVD player.
In addition to burning your favorite shows to DVD, both units can schedule and
record programs in the background while you watch a DVD. You can even hook
up a camcorder, and copy your vacation videos to DVD. They both come with
TiVo Basic service; you need a subscription for the “Plus” TiVo Service that
includes the Season Pass, WishList, Suggestions, and other really fun stuff.

Several other companies offer similar TiVo/DVD recorder hybrids, with more
models to come.
Choosing the Right TiVo for You
Since TiVo now comes in many different installations, it’s may seem more dif-
ficult than ever to choose the right one. But actually, it’s easier — TiVo fulfills
a wider variety of specific needs than ever before.
If you simply want the TiVo Service, just buy a standalone model of TiVo. It
hooks up to any TV signal, be it cable, satellite, or an antenna, and lets you
automatically record your favorite shows.
If you’re using DirecTV satellite service, you’ll want a DirecTV TiVo. It’s
designed specifically for DirecTV’s satellite service and preserves your Dolby
Digital 5.1 sound. If you watch HDTV channels with your DirecTV, pick up the
DirecTV TiVo with HDTV support. (These TiVos don’t support Home Media
Option for connecting to a computer, however. If that’s a must, stick with the
standalone TiVos.)
If you don’t yet own a DVD player, pick up one of the DVD players with TiVo
built-in. Combining the two items means one less box to wedge into your
entertainment center.
Finally, if you’re the type who enjoys saving TV shows and movies on video-
tape, pick up a DVD recorder with a built-in TiVo. Storing your shows on DVD
is much less awkward than storing them on videotape.

A
TiVo lifestyle begins with something unavoidably awful: connecting TiVo
to your TV, weaving strands of cables into just the right configuration.
Thankfully, TiVo’s installation happens only once. And, for a lucky few, instal-
lations are a breeze. Folks with simple television setups merely connect two
cables, and TiVo dutifully leaps onto their TV’s screen. Other people, usually
those of us with a pile of remotes on our coffee tables, have a rougher time.
This section walks you through the process of connecting your TiVo to your
TV, and even adding a VCR and other items to the mix, if you desire. First-
timers should budget about an hour for this chore.
Throwing in the Towel and Calling a
Professional Installer
Pssst. Some people don’t bother installing their own TiVo. Just as they let
professionals repair their car, plumb their sinks, or mix their martinis, they
place their TiVo’s installation into more experienced hands. If you’re not a do-
it-yourselfer, or your TV setup looks imposing, you have several options:

 Installation package with purchase. If you buy your TiVo directly from
DirecTV, Best Buy, or some other stores, you can often order a profes-
sional installation package at the same time. Some offer free installation
with purchase; others charge more than $100. Some only offer free
installations during sales promotions. Never be afraid to ask.
 Installation from TiVo. TiVo lets you purchase a professional installation
from its Web site (https://store.tivo.com/).
 Moonlighting salespeople. Even if your local store doesn’t offer an
installation package, ask the salesperson about installation. Many elec-
tronics retail “team members” moonlight by installing home theater
components. To a person well-versed in S-Video cables, TiVo’s a piece of
cake.
 Hitting up the neighbors. Some neighbors or relatives may already own
a TiVo, and they just might help install yours. (Some curious folks may
also offer to help just to see what all this TiVo buzz is about.)
The Three Steps to Installing TiVo
Although there’s no single “right way” to connect a TiVo to your equipment,
all installations follow these three steps. The differences depend on the type
of connections found on your TV, cable or satellite box, and other acces-
sories. For the best possible picture, always identify and use the highest 
quality connections available on each piece of equipment.
For the simplest of setups, this short section may be all you need. If some-
thing doesn’t seem quite right, or you don’t understand the cables and con-
nectors on your equipment, the rest of this chapter explains each step in
detail.
1. Place TiVo near your TV.
2. Connect TiVo to your phone line.
If your TiVo absolutely cannot reach your closest phone jack, I offer
some alternatives in this chapter’s “Connecting TiVo to Your Phone
Line” section. Some methods eliminate the need for a long, troublesome
phone cord. Others eliminate the need for a telephone line altogether,
something quite appealing to today’s cell phone generation.
3. Connect TiVo to your television signal.
If you don’t have a cable or satellite box, this can be as simple as screw-
ing your cable TV’s cable into TiVo’s RF In jack and then connecting an
30
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 

identical cable between TiVo’s RF Out jack and your TV’s RF In or Cable
In jack. (Sometimes the TV’s jack is simply called “Antenna.”) Tune your
TV to channel 3 or 4 to see TiVo.
Cable or satellite box users must follow two additional steps to com-
plete the installation:
1. Set up TiVo to change the box’s channels.
Depending on your type of cable or satellite box, you need to con-
nect either TiVo’s IR Control cable or its Serial Control cable
between TiVo and the box.
2. Connect sound and video cables from your cable or satellite box
to TiVo’s input ports.
TiVo accepts sound and video in several different ways, depending
on your needs. Always choose the highest quality connections
available. (In an upcoming section, Table 3-2 explains which con-
nections provide the best quality.)
Make sure your TiVo, your TV, and your cable box, if necessary, are
plugged into the wall and turned on. (TiVo turns on automatically as
soon as it’s plugged in.)
That’s it. The rest of this chapter discusses these steps in more detail. If
you’re feeling confident, jump right in with these three steps. Should you run
into trouble, want a higher quality picture, or if something doesn’t seem quite
right, head for the section in this chapter that explains that particular step in
more detail.
Consider buying an inexpensive Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) for your
TiVo (and cable/satellite box). Although TiVo handles power outages grace-
fully, it doesn’t like power fluctuations. (Your computers don’t like these,
either.) Plugging your TiVo into a UPS (350VA rating or more) protects it and
your recorded shows from harm.
31
Chapter 3: Setting Up Your TiVo
Peeking into TiVo’s Installation Guide
TiVo comes with a surprisingly well-written and
illustrated installation guide. It contains pictures
of the connectors you’ll use, and clear diagrams
showing how to install TiVo with or without a
cable/satellite box. Plus, the manual shows how
to add a VCR, home stereo, DVD player, and
game machine.
If you bought a used TiVo with no manual, down-
load a free copy at www.tivo.com/guides.
You’ll need a free copy of Adobe Acrobat
Reader (www.adobe.com/reader) to view or
print the downloaded manual.

Identifying Your Cables and Connectors,
and Choosing the Highest Quality
TiVo comes with a thick pack of cables to shuffle information between the
connections found on your TV set, VCR, DVD player, home stereo system,
and TiVo itself. You won’t use all of TiVo’s bundled cables; there are supposed
to be leftovers. Just use the ones that work best with your current television
setup.
Table 3-1 helps you identify the cables, their connectors, and their purpose in
life. Carefully examine both TiVo and your equipment, identifying the different
connectors each has to offer.

Chapter 3: Setting Up Your TiVo

TiVo comes with many different types of cables because TiVo can usually
connect with your equipment several ways. Today’s TV setups vary greatly
in quality. Some people are happy connecting TiVo directly to a cheap TV.
Others connect TiVo to an expensive home theater. Others take a middle
route, perhaps running the TV’s sound through a home stereo.
To accommodate all of these different setups, TiVo offers three main ways to
connect both video and sound. Table 3-1 explains the connectors you’re
likely to find on TiVo and your TV (and/or home theater). Table 3-2 explains
the quality provided by each type of cable and connection.

Before hooking up your TiVo, identify all the connectors available on your TV
(and home stereo, if used). Using Tables 3-1 and 3-2, find the connector offer-
ing the highest quality. Finally, route the appropriate cable between that con-
nector and the matching connector on your TiVo. That ensures TiVo will
provide you with the best quality sound and picture.
34
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 

Placing TiVo Near Your TV Set
For the easiest installation, TiVo should be within five feet of your television,
and within 25 feet of a phone jack. (TiVo’s bundled cables only reach that far.)
Some folks plop their TiVo atop their large TV set; others sandwich it into
their rack of VCRs, DVD players, and stereos.
Once you’ve set up a standalone TiVo, you’ll rarely touch it; just make sure it
remains within the line of sight of its remote control. If your TiVo model
sports buttons along its front, keep it fairly accessible.
 Don’t place TiVo beneath your TV set; most sets are simply too heavy.
TiVo works fine on top of your TV, if you don’t mind it staring at you
during movies.
 TiVo works fine on its side. Just be sure its front faces toward you, or the
remote might not work.
 When positioning your TiVo, be careful not to block its air vents — little
slots in the metal casing — especially when positioning it on its side.
(Sometimes you can slip little doodads beneath the TiVo to lift it up at
least a half-inch above the ground.) Keep TiVo off the carpet, too, as the
fibers can block its vents.
 If your home theater’s cabinetry hides your equipment behind mesh
fabric, hide the TiVo in there, as well. Remotes easily penetrate the
fabric.
 Most TiVos come with a thin strip of protective tape across the front,
right over the infrared receiver. Don’t forget to peel off the tape once
you’ve positioned your TiVo.
Connecting TiVo to Your Phone Line
TiVo must phone its headquarters every day or so to grab your latest show
listings. It also needs to phone its headquarters when you first set it up in
your home. Unlike a teenager, TiVo doesn’t need its own telephone, or even
its own phone line. It’s happy to share your home’s phone or fax line.
TiVo won’t interrupt you when you’re talking. And if you happen to interrupt
TiVo during its call, just hang up for five seconds. TiVo hangs up, letting you
make your call. 
35
Chapter 3: Setting Up Your TiVo

To connect the phone line, attach one end of TiVo’s bundled 25-foot phone
cable into TiVo’s phone jack, and plug the other end into a nearby phone jack
in your house.
If your telephone already hogs the closest phone jack, use TiVo’s bundled
“phone line splitter,” shown in Figure 3-1. Plugging the splitter into a phone
jack gives you two jacks — one for your phone and the other for TiVo.

36
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 
How can I set up TiVo without a phone line?
TiVo must connect with a land-based phone line
to complete its initial Guided Setup. That lets
TiVo download its initial software updates,
among other things. However, TiVo needn’t use
your own phone line. Carry TiVo over to a
friend’s or neighbor’s house, temporarily con-
nect TiVo to their TV set so you can see its
menus, and let TiVo borrow their phone line for
its Guided Setup.
Once your new standalone TiVo has made its
initial phone call, hook it up to your home net-
work and let it piggyback on your broadband
Internet connection, as described in Chapter 8.
Older, Series 1 TiVos don’t have the luxury of
connecting through home computers. They
must be connected to a telephone line. (If you’re
handy with computers, however, check out net-
work cards offered by companies like 9th Tee
(www.9thtee.com) in Chapter 13. They allow
Series 1 TiVos to connect with broadband home
networks.)
DirecTV’s official policy requires DirecTV TiVos
to be hooked up to a phone line. However, some
users report that their DirecTV TiVos work fine
without a phone line, as long as they ignore the
nag screens and don’t try to order Pay Per View
events from their DirecTV TiVo menus. (DirecTV
TiVos receive their guide information directly
from the satellite.)

 A household phone line works fine, but a digital “PBX” phone line — like
the multiline systems found in many offices and hotels — will not work
and may damage your TiVo.
 Conceal a long phone cord by pressing it into the edge where your
carpet meets with your walls.
 If your phone jack is too far away from TiVo, or it leaves an ugly dangling
cord, you have several options:
• Leave the phone cord unplugged. Then, every few days, plug in
the TiVo and use TiVo’s Setup menu option to make TiVo “call
now.” (I describe this in Chapter 11’s “Solving phone problems”
section.) When TiVo finishes, unplug the phone cord and stash it.
Repeat once a week.
• Connect TiVo to your computer’s broadband connection.
Computer savvy folks can connect to their computer’s broadband
connection through a wired or wireless network, described in
Chapter 8. That lets TiVo grab your information from the Internet,
eliminating the need for a telephone line altogether. (You need a
wired network or a phone line to run TiVo’s initial Guided Setup,
covered in Chapter 4.)
• Buy a wireless phone jack. You’ll find them at Radio Shack, Amazon,
Home Depot, and TiVo’s online store (https://store.tivo.com/),
as well as at some of the TiVo accessory stores listed in Chapter 13.
These plug into a phone jack and “beam” the signal through the air
or your power lines to a receiver, which plugs into TiVo’s phone jack.
Make sure the wireless phone jack works specifically with modems
or fax machines, and not just voice.
Connecting TiVo to Your Television Signal
Is TiVo placed near your TV? Connected to the telephone line? Then you’re
ready to connect TiVo to your television signal. The signal usually enters
your house in one of two ways: through a single cable protruding from the
wall, or through a satellite or cable box.
If you don’t use a cable box or satellite box, you qualify for the simplest

If you do have a cable or satellite box, the installation’s a little more difficult,
so it’s described in an upcoming section.

Chapter 3: Setting Up Your TiVo

Hooking Up TiVo without a Satellite
or Cable Box
If you currently have a single cable poking out of a wall and running into your
television — with no cable box or satellite dish — everything’s easy. Follow
these six steps, and you’re through. When finished, head to Chapter 4 and
run TiVo’s onscreen Guided Setup.
1. Make sure TiVo is sitting next to your TV set and is plugged into the
phone line.
Don’t plug TiVo’s power cord into the wall quite yet.
2. Unplug or unscrew the cable from your TV and plug it into TiVo’s RF
In jack.
Keep track of where the cable came out of your TV; you’ll need to
reattach a cable to that spot in the next step.
3. Plug a second cable from TiVo’s RF Out jack to your TV’s Antenna,
Cable, or RF In jack.
This second cable comes packaged with TiVo, and it looks like the one
you unplugged in Step 3. (The two cables may be different colors.)
When connected this way, your TiVo and TV should resemble the setup
shown in Figure 3-2.
4. Plug in your TiVo, and turn on your TV tuned to channel 3 or 4.
Your TiVo remote won’t yet control your TV. (I explain how to do that at
the end of Chapter 4.) But TiVo turns itself on as soon as you plug it in,
and you’ll see it on either channel 3 or 4 of your TV set.
Flipping the little 3|4 switch near TiVo’s RF Out jack lets you choose
whether to tune your TV to channel 3 or 4 to watch TiVo.
That should do the trick; you’re through with this chapter. If you have a cable
or satellite box, however, or you want to add a VCR or other accessories,
you’ll need to check out this chapter’s upcoming sections.
Save all of TiVo’s cables in a safe place, even if you don’t need them today.
You’ll probably need them in the future, if you add other equipment, change
TV providers, or buy a new TV.
To improve picture quality, see if your TV offers composite or S-Video con-
nectors. If so, connect the composite or S-Video cables between the TV and
TiVo’s connectors. (Don’t use the RF cable.) You’ll need to tune into your TV’s
“Line Input” to watch TiVo.

Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 

Connecting TiVo with a Cable
or Satellite Box
TiVo works fine with your satellite or cable box, if your television signal flows
through one. The biggest obstacle is letting TiVo change the box’s channels.
TiVo also needs a way to grab sound and video from the box. The next two
sections show how to accomplish both tasks.
Letting TiVo change channels on 
a cable or satellite box
When watching TV through a cable or satellite box, you change channels with
the box’s remote. That presents a problem for the fingerless TiVo, because it
must change the box’s channel to record your shows. How can TiVo change
the channels without being able to push buttons on the remote?
TiVo resorts to one of two tricks: a strange “Serial Control” cable used by some
satellite boxes, or an even stranger “mini-remote on a string” called an “IR

Chapter 3: Setting Up Your TiVo

(infrared) Control” cable that works with both satellite and cable boxes. I
explain each method below; choose the one that works best with your partic-
ular box.
Hooking up a Serial Control cable
A few satellite boxes let you plug in this special cable so TiVo can change its
channels. Here’s how to eyeball your satellite box for the right connector,
and, if your box is one of the lucky ones, how to connect the right cable. (It
comes bundled with TiVo.)
1. Examine the back of your satellite box for a “serial port” connector.
Seen in the margin, this little oblong bump has either 9 or 15 tiny holes.
If you spot a 9-hole connector, rummage around for TiVo’s bundled Serial
Control cable with the 9-pin connector and proceed to Step 2.
If you spot a 15-hole connector, head to Radio Shack and buy a “15-pin
male to 9-pin female” adapter and push it onto the end of TiVo’s included
serial port connector. TiVo’s Web site (https//store.tivo.com) sells
the same adapter, as do some TiVo accessory stores listed in Chapter 13.
2. Push the larger end of the TiVo serial cable into the plug on the back
of your satellite box.
The plug’s pins should align perfectly with the holes. If they don’t,
you’re plugging it in upside down or you need the adapter discussed in
the previous step.
3. Plug the cable’s other end into TiVo’s Serial Connector port.
Tell TiVo to use the “serial” connector for changing channels when you run
TiVo’s onscreen “Guided Setup” (described in Chapter 4).
 Once you’ve connected TiVo to your satellite box, hide the box’s remote.
TiVo’s now responsible for changing channels, so stick with TiVo’s
remote exclusively. If you accidentally press a button on the satellite
box’s remote while TiVo’s recording a show, you might accidentally
change channels in the middle of your recording.
 Some RCA satellite receivers use a “Home Control” connector that looks
a tad smaller than a phone connector. If your RCA-brand satellite box
has a Home Control cable (not included with TiVo), plug one end into its
jack and the other end into TiVo’s Control Out/Serial jack. Don’t have the
right cable? Either buy one at TiVo’s Web site
(https://store.tivo.com) or use TiVo’s Infrared (IR) Control cable,
instead, as described in the next section.
 The Motorola DCT2000 cable box also uses a serial connection, but not
all cable companies enable the serial port. If you have that particular
model of cable box, give it a try by following the same steps above.
40
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 

 If this section sounds too complicated, or you can’t find those connec-
tors, don’t worry. Just use the IR (Infrared) Control, described next. It
works for all boxes, but sometimes needs a little extra adjustment.
Hooking up an Infrared Control cable
“IR Control cable” is a fancy name for the “mini-remote on a string” that TiVo
uses to change channels on your cable or satellite box. When you fasten
TiVo’s little IR Control cable in the right place on the front of your cable or
satellite box, TiVo uses it to beam signals telling the box to change stations.
Follows these steps to set it up:
1. Locate the IR Control (Infrared Control) cable packaged with your TiVo.
Shown in Table 3-1, the IR Control cable is black; one end sports a little
pointed connector, the other has two angular plastic doodads. (You
might spot a little “bulb” on the end of each doodad.)
2. Locate the infrared receiver on your cable or satellite box.
The thing’s almost invisible, but it’s always on the box’s front, usually
behind a semi-transparent plastic window. Grab a flashlight, and peek
through any suspicious semi-transparent plastic areas on the box.
Eventually, you’ll spot the flat little receiver inside, usually square or rec-
tangular. (It’s right next to the digital clock on our cable box.)
3. Fasten TiVo’s infrared controls above and below the cable or satellite
box’s infrared receiver.
Let the two doodads hang about 1.5 inches past the box’s edges, as
shown in Figure 3-3. Use the bundled pieces of double-sticky tape to
fasten each control to the box.

Chapter 3: Setting Up Your TiVo

4. Plug the cable’s other end (usually purple) into the TiVo’s IR jack.
You’ll test your work later when running TiVo’s onscreen Guided Setup
(covered in Chapter 4). You may need to make a slight adjustment in
positioning.
Routing the sound and video
to TiVo and your TV
Once TiVo’s connected to your telephone line and your cable or satellite
box’s channel changer, you’ve completed the hard stuff. Now TiVo needs to
grab the sound and video sent by your satellite or cable box. Finish up by
connecting TiVo’s audio and video outputs to your television.
Follow these steps to send the box’s information to TiVo and let TiVo send
information to your TV set:
1. Examine your cable or satellite box’s Video Out connectors.
Table 3-1 identifies the connectors.
2. Connect the best video cable connection between the box’s Video Out
jacks to TiVo’s Video In jacks.
Use S-Video if your box offers it; otherwise, use the yellow RCA/compos-
ite cable.
3. Examine your box’s Audio Out jacks.
You’ll probably use the red and white RCA/composite cables. 
Only a DirecTV TiVo can record in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound. Standalone
owners should ignore Surround Sound outputs on their cable box, no
matter how tempting, or else their sound won’t match the video.
4. Connect the appropriate sound and video cables between TiVo’s Audio
Out and Video Out jacks to your TV’s Audio In and Video In jacks.
Red is for the right channel, and white is for the left. If your TV doesn’t
have stereo sound, plug in one of the two jacks and leave the other 
dangling. 
If your TV offers S-Video, connect an S-Video cable between it and TiVo’s
S-Video Out. (Leave the yellow cable dangling.) No S-Video? Then use
the yellow RCA/composite cable.
42
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 

If your TV only offers an Antenna or RF In jack, connect a cable between
that and TiVo’s RF Out jack. (Only one cable will fit, and it carries both
sound and video.) Tune your TV to channel 3 or 4 to see TiVo.
Depending on your brand of cable or satellite box and TV, your setup
will probably resemble the one shown in Figure 3-4.

Chapter 3: Setting Up Your TiVo

Connecting TiVo’s Sound to Your Stereo
Televisions work best for displaying video. And stereo systems work best for
playing sound. So it’s only natural that many people connect their TiVo to
their home stereo as well as their TV. The hard part is figuring out which
place to plug it in on your home stereo.
The simplest way is to leave TiVo’s video cable hooked up to your television.
But connect the red and white audio cables from TiVo’s Audio Out jacks to
your stereo’s Line In jacks. (Leave your TV’s sound turned down or off, if
possible.)
To listen to your TiVo, turn on your stereo and turn the knob to “Line Input.”
Turn on your TV to see the picture.
Depending on your stereo, you can often route the video through your home
stereo, too. I route our TiVo through our stereo’s “Video Input 3” connector,
which offers a pair of audio connectors and a video connector. Then I run an
S-Video cable from the stereo’s S-Video OUT to the TV’s Line In connector.
To watch TiVo, I turn the stereo to Video Input 3. Simple. Well, it is once all
the cables are connected.
44
Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 
TiVo and tuners
When your television stream flows straight
into TiVo — with no cable or satellite box in
between — TiVo changes channels using its
own built-in tuner. To record programs, TiVo
automatically tunes to the right channel at the
right time. TiVo’s internal tuner can tune chan-
nels 2 through 99, which works fine when
hooked up to an antenna or most other analog
feeds.
But if your television service sends any digital
broadcasts, encrypted shows (HBO, for instance,
and other pay channels), or channels numbered
higher than 99, then you probably need a box,
typically provided by your cable or satellite ser-
vice. The TV stream enters the cable or satellite
box, which decodes the digital channels to
analog, and uses its internal tuner to route the
appropriate channel to TiVo for recording.
Finally, DirecTV TiVos come with a built-in satel-
lite box that contains two tuners, letting TiVo
record two different channels simultaneously —
something standalone TiVos can’t handle.

No matter how you hook it up, leave appropriate sticky notes on the knobs
for your spouse.
Connecting a VCR and Other Accessories
between TiVo and Your TV
Although TiVo quickly replaces the VCR for most folks, some people just
can’t let go of their stacks of archived Simpson’s episodes. TiVo’s perfectly
willing to oblige both camps. TiVo even shows a “Save to VCR” option
(explained in Chapter 6) on the menu of every recorded show. You can even
connect a DVD recorder instead of a VCR, as TiVo won’t know the difference.
Although your setup options will vary according to the number of inputs on
your television, these steps usually work when connecting your VCR (or DVD
recorder) to TiVo and your TV.
1. Set up your TiVo and television.
Make sure TiVo’s connected to your phone line, cable or satellite box (if
necessary), and television, as explained earlier in this chapter.
2. Find your VCR’s Input jacks.
You’ll find several jacks on the back of your VCR. Look for its red and
white Audio In jacks and the yellow Video In jack.
If your VCR doesn’t have those, look for its RF In connector.
3. Connect a cable between the TiVo’s Sound and Video Out jacks to the
VCR’s Sound and Video In jacks.
TiVo has two Sound and Video output jacks (One set goes to your TV).
Connect the unused jacks to your VCR. The yellow cable goes between
the Video connectors, the red cable goes to the Audio Right, and the
white cable goes to the Audio Left.
Or, connect an RF cable between TiVo’s RF Out and your VCR’s RF In
jacks.
4. Connect a cable between the VCR’s RF Out jack and your TV’s
Antenna or RF In jack.
Tune your TV to channel 3 or 4 to watch your VCR; tune your TV to Line
Input to watch TiVo. When installed this way, TiVo’s connections will
resemble the ones shown in Figure 3-5.
45
Chapter 3: Setting Up Your TiVo

 The amount of items you can connect depends mainly on the amount of
input jacks available on your TV. Fancy TVs offer four, which provides a
connection for TiVo and three accessories. Cheaper TVs may offer only
one or two input jacks.
 TVs with only one or two inputs limit your options, unfortunately. One
solution is to buy a “switchbox,” available at most electronics or stereo
stores. Connect a cable between the switch box’s Out ports and your TV,
and connect your other gadgets to the switchbox’s In ports. By selecting
different inputs on the switchbox, you can “switch” between items and
choose what is sent to your TV.

Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 

 If you have the cash, invest in an audio/visual receiver with enough Line
Inputs to handle all your devices: VCRs, TiVos, DVD players, game
machines, and fog machines. Plug each device into its own connector
and turn a knob on the audio/video receiver to choose between each
device.
 A switchbox is a less-expensive option for hooking up several different
items to your TV. Buy a switchbox that has an input for each of your
gadgets.
 Richard Parker’s TiVo Wiring Guide Web site (www.electrophobia.
com/tivo) contains illustrations of how to connect TiVo in more than 20
ways, allowing for many combinations of hi-fi goodies.
Recording One Show While Watching
Another Live Show
You can always watch a recorded show while TiVo records a live show in the
background. TiVo simply tunes to the channel of the live show and records it,
playing back your recorded show all the while.
Problems flare when you want to watch a live show while TiVo records a dif-
ferent live show. TiVo needs to “watch” the channel that it’s recording, so that
prevents you from changing that channel to something else.
The simplest way to record one channel while watching another comes to
people without a cable or satellite box. (This also works for people who use a
cable box but don’t have pay channels or digital cable.)
47
Chapter 3: Setting Up Your TiVo
Tenting your cable or satellite box
Sometimes you’ll want to give TiVo its own
cable or satellite box to control, while you use a
second one to watch live TV uninterrupted. To
do this successfully, you must cover the front of
TiVo’s dedicated box; that keeps the second
box’s remote from interfering with the first box.
Some people place a strip of tin foil or thick
black cloth along the box’s front, as shown in
Figure 3-7, covering TiVo’s IR transmitter and the
box’s receiver. Others go so far as to place the
cable or satellite box completely inside a card-
board box where no light can reach it.
Once you’ve covered the box, test it by trying to
change its channels using the second box’s
remote. If you’re successful, you won’t be able
to change its channels at all. Only TiVo will,
ensuring that it works correctly.

That simple solution is to use a splitter — an inexpensive gadget found in
electronics and hardware stores that splits a single cable into two cables.
Once you’ve split the cable into two, connect one cable to TiVo and the other
straight to your TV. Figure 3-6 shows an example.

Part I: Before Buying Your TiVo . . . 

To watch TiVo, select the Line Input. To watch live TV, turn the TV to the
channel you want. The splitter gives TiVo and your TV their own direct con-
nection to the TV source, keeping them from getting in each other’s way.
 DirecTV TiVos used with the DirecTV satellite service don’t experience
this problem. They come with two tuners, letting you watch one live
show while recording another live show in the background.
 If you have a digital cable box, however, and you want access to all your
channels, your best solution is to ask the cable company for a second
digital cable box. Use a splitter to connect each cable box to the cable.
Connect one cable box to TiVo, and connect the second box straight to
your TV, letting you watch live TV unobstructed. Be sure to “tent” the
cable box connected to TiVo, as described in the nearby sidebar and
shown in Figure 3-7.
 If you have a digital cable box and don’t mind just watching channels
2–99 live, you can make do with the splitter described above.
 If your TV’s two inputs are already used up by both TiVo and your VCR,
use the splitter to connect a second cable feed to your VCR. Switch the
TV to watch your VCR, and use your VCR’s tuner to switch to the live
channel you want to watch.

TiVo’s Remote and
the Guided Setup
In This Chapter
 Preparing for installation
 Using TiVo’s remote
 Completing the onscreen Guided Setup
 Customizing TiVo’s remote to your TV or stereo
A
newly installed TiVo doesn’t go out of its way to be friendly. After
you’ve spent an afternoon connecting cables to take care of its physical
needs, your newly powered-up TiVo offers a token “Welcome” message. And
when the Welcome screen disappears, TiVo presents you with yet another
chore: completing its onscreen Guided Setup.
This chapter walks you through TiVo’s Guided Setup, where you navigate
menus with the remote, telling TiVo everything you’ve done in Chapter 3 —
and then some.
Budget about an hour for this chore. When done, feel free to kick back and
start watching live TV through TiVo. For the next three to six hours after
you’ve finished setting it up, TiVo will work in the background, sorting
through its newly downloaded TV listings. TiVo places everything into its
massive digital filing cabinet for easy access, eagerly preparing for your
upcoming TV nirvana.

You probably won’t return to this chapter, except, perhaps, to read the sec-
tion on programming your remote control to control your TV’s power switch
and volume. (This oft-delayed task makes life much easier.)
Preparing for TiVo’s Guided Setup
Place these items within easy reach before turning on TiVo and running its
onscreen Guided Setup. Each one lowers your frustration level a few notches
for the upcoming installation tasks.
 Your latest cable or satellite bill. TiVo needs to know who provides
your television signal, the company’s name, as well as what channels
you receive. (Premium channels? Special packages? Foreign language
channels?) A peek at the bill helps you select your lineup from TiVo’s
onscreen list.
 Your phone book. TiVo calls its headquarters daily, so one setup menu
lists nearby phone numbers. A phone book lets you weed out any long-
distance numbers from the mix.
 A recent TV Guide. A local TV Guide helps you match station names
with their content. When TiVo lists “KGTV Channel 15,” for instance,
you’ll remember the station, as well as whether you ever watch it.
 A beverage. TiVo’s Guided Setup takes from 30 minutes to an hour. Stay
refreshed.
 TiVo’s remote. You won’t get far without it. (I explain how to make TiVo’s
remote control the power and volume of your TV or home stereo later in
this chapter.)
Knowing Your Remote
Different models of TiVo use slightly different remotes, but they all resemble
a VCR’s remote, with a few special keys tossed in to confuse you. (If you
forget a key’s purpose, check out Figure 4-1 or the handy tear-out “Cheat
Sheet” near the front of the book.) You’ll probably use only the Arrows and
Select buttons in this chapter, but here’s a rundown on them all:

Arrows: This round button with the four arrows works just like the Arrows
knob on a DVD player. Push the arrow in the direction you want to move the
onscreen cursor. (Some remotes replace the round button with individual
Arrow buttons.) 
Select: When you’ve highlighted your desired option, press the Select button
to tell TiVo to carry out that option.
Number: Just as with your TV remote, press Number buttons to type in
channel numbers.
TV Power: Turns your TV (or stereo, if that handles TiVo’s sound) on or off.
TiVo: Jumps to the TiVo Central screen, the starting point for all menus.
Live TV: Jumps to live television.
TV Input: Switches between different inputs on your TV. (Some TVs let you
plug the VCR into one input, for instance, and a DVD into another. By switch-
ing between the two inputs, you choose which one to watch.)
Info (Information): Brings up a screen with the currently playing show’s
name, channel, and show description. (The button on DirecTV TiVos says
“Display” instead of “Info.”)
Select: Chooses the currently highlighted item.
Thumbs Up: Press this button to tell TiVo you enjoyed, really enjoyed, or
loved a show. (Can be pressed up to three times to rate your enjoyment
level.)
Thumbs Down: Press this button to tell TiVo you disliked, were irritated by,
or absolutely hated a show. (Can be pressed up to three times to emphasize
disgruntlement level.)
Mute: Turns off the volume; press again to turn back on.
Volume: Press top portion of button to raise volume; press lower portion to
lower volume.

Slow: Slows down the current playback speed.
Instant Replay: Immediately jumps back eight seconds and plays again.
Advance: This acts as a sort of “jump to end” button. When pausing live TV,
for instance, press this to catch up to the current action. When watching
recorded TV, this jumps to the end of the recorded show.
DVR Switch: Only used if you have two “Series 2” TiVos; this lets you assign a
different remote to each TiVo.
Clear: Clears the screen of any TiVo menus. Or, from the Now Playing list,
press Clear to delete the currently highlighted show.
Enter/Last: Used occasionally to display additional options from certain
menus. It also flips between two channels when watching live TV.
Window: Not currently used, but this feature may be added in the future.

Chapter 4: TiVo’s Remote and the Guided Setup

 TiVo makes a congratulatory beep sound whenever you press a key. Some
owners find this reassuring, others annoying. (I explain how to turn off
the beep or change its volume — as well as adjust other settings — in
Chapter 7.)
 Don’t forget to place batteries into your remote. (It uses AA batteries,
slipped in through a slide-off cover on the back.)
 Fumbling with a remote in the dark? My wife discovered that one end of
our remote is heavier than the other, so we point the lighter end at the
TiVo. With experience, you’ll identify your remote by shape and weight,
too. (Or, try sticking a piece of thick tape under the front end of the
remote where you don’t normally hold it. That provides a clue when
you’re holding it the wrong way.)
 When I tell you to use one of the remote’s buttons, its picture appears
alongside the text.
Completing Onscreen Guided Setup
Different brands and models use slightly different Guided Setups, so I won’t
use a numbered, step-by-step explanation. Instead, I describe the general
areas you’ll encounter when completing TiVo’s Guided Setup with a “stand-
alone” Series 2 TiVo. Described in Chapter 2, standalone TiVos work with any
type of TV signal: cable, satellite, or antenna.
The Guided Setup lets TiVo understand how you receive your channels and
how it’s hooked up. TiVo’s Guided Setup asks fairly intelligent questions,
saving time by basing its next question on your previous answer.
If you answer something wrong, all is not lost. Press the Back arrow to back
up and change your answer. Or, if TiVo insists on trudging forward, you may
change most of these answers in its Settings area, which I cover in Chapter 7.
You can also repeat the Guided Setup, covered in Chapter 11.
Press the remote’s Select button to choose an answer and move to the next
screen. Sometimes you merely need to read a screen, press the Select button,
and advance to the next screen.
 When turned on for the very first time, most TiVos come to life with the
words “Welcome. Powering up,” as shown in Figure 4-2. That’s a good
sign; your TiVo has passed the first step. If this screen never appears,
don’t give up yet: Some cables may simply need tweaking. I explain how
to track down and fix TiVo problems in Chapter 11.
 The Welcome screen is soon replaced by “Almost there. A few more sec-
onds, please . . . ”. After about a minute of hesitation, TiVo shows that
everything is okay by displaying its official blue “Welcome!” screen, as
shown in Figure 4-3.

Chapter 4: TiVo’s Remote and the Guided Setup

Agreeing to TiVo’s terms
Before using nearly any computer-related product these days, you’re asked to
agree to its legalese- and jargon-filled terms of agreement. TiVo’s no exception,
as you can see in Figure 4-4. TiVo’s manual lists the agreement, and the most
up-to-date versions appear on TiVo’s Web site at www.tivo.com/privacy.
(Actually, TiVo’s service agreement and privacy policy are far less offensive
than the 50-page agreement Microsoft tacks onto Windows XP.)
Basically, TiVo says that you must pay for the service, and that it collects
information about shows watched by the TiVos in your general area. No, they
don’t know what you watch. They simply collect anonymous statistics from
TiVos in your Zip code, similar to a US Census Report.
If you object, simply tell them to stop, as described in Chapter 1. Personally,
I enjoy telling the networks what I watch. It’s not as good as sharing my opin-
ions with the studio head on the golf course, but it’s probably the closest
I’ll get.
Press the remote’s Select key to nod your head and move onward.

Part II: Using the TiVo 

Activating the service
TiVo wastes no time in asking you to Activate your service, as shown in
Figure 4-5.
Choose “OK, I’ve activated my service” if you’ve already activated TiVo. If you
haven’t activated, choose “Remind me later to activate” and continue setting
up the TiVo.
TiVo makes its next phone call seven days after you finish the Guided Setup.
If it discovers that you still haven’t activated, it stops recording your shows.
If it discovers that you have activated, it displays “Activated” status on its
Status screen (covered in Chapter 7).
But until TiVo makes that phone call to see if you’ve activated, it nags you
daily to activate. To stop the nagging, force TiVo to make its daily call by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. Choose TiVo Messages & Setup from TiVo Central.
2. Select Settings and choose Phone & Network Setup.
3. Select Connect to the TiVo Service Now.
Figure 4-5:
Activate
your service
through
TiVo’s Web
site or by

61
Chapter 4: TiVo’s Remote and the Guided Setup

TiVo will discover that you’ve activated, stop nagging you, and continue with
business as usual.
Note the Progress status bar at the screen’s bottom in Figure 4-5. The little
green line creeps further to the right with each step, letting you gauge your
progress.
Telling TiVo about your location
When a new TiVo wakes up in your home, it needs to know a few specifics
about its location and hookup. How do you receive your TV channels, for
instance? Does your particular area observe Daylight Savings Time? These
answers help TiVo tackle the work that lies ahead.
Choose your broadcast source
After the Activation screen, TiVo explains why it needs a connection to a tele-
phone line. (I explain that in Chapter 3, if you’d rather hear it from me.) Give
it a virtual head nod by pressing the Select button.
Next, tell TiVo how you receive your current TV channels, as shown in
Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-6:
Tell TiVo
how you
receive your
television
broadcasts.
62
Part II: Using the TiVo 

To select an option, press the remote’s Arrow buttons until you see your
chosen option highlighted; then press Select. (If you’re unsure how you
receive your television signal, check your monthly bill or ask your landlord.)
Enter your Zip code
TiVo asks for your Zip code, as shown in Figure 4-7, to figure out your area’s
available channels. Enter your Zip code by pressing the Number buttons on
your remote and then pressing Select to continue.
You can also enter the numbers using the Arrow buttons: Up and Down change
the selected number; Right and Left move back and forth between spaces.
Choose your Time Zone and Daylight Savings Time status
On the next page, tell TiVo your Time Zone so it can adjust its clock
accordingly.
Although TiVo resets its internal clock with every phone call, it takes more
than an accurate clock to grab shows at the right time. So, the next page asks
if your area observes Daylight Savings Time. Make sure you answer this one
correctly so TiVo still grabs your shows on schedule. (Although TiVo automat-
ically remembers to adjust its clock for Daylight Savings Time, some states
and communities wisely ignore Daylight Savings Time buffoonery; if so, TiVo
needs to know.)
Figure 4-7:
Tell TiVo
your Zip
code so it

63
Chapter 4: TiVo’s Remote and the Guided Setup

If you give the wrong answer, or if TiVo misses your shows by an hour once
Daylight Savings Time begins, I explain how to return to this screen in
Chapter 11.
Enter area code and prefix for phone
Because TiVo needs to call headquarters every day or so, it needs to know
your exact phone setup. The area code is simple enough. But to accommo-
date more elaborate phone setups, it needs to know if you must dial “9” or
disable call waiting before making a call, as shown in Figure 4-8.
Disabling call waiting usually involves placing *70, before the phone number.
Enter the comma by pressing the Pause button; enter an asterisk by pressing
Clear. (If you don’t disable call waiting, the “beep” signaling an incoming call
will throw TiVo off the line.)
Highlight your choice with the Arrows and press Select.
Letting TiVo make its first setup call
Now that TiVo knows some rudimentary details, it’s ready to look up the
channels you currently receive. TiVo’s first setup call, shown in Figure 4-9,
takes about 15 minutes.
Figure 4-8:

“9” or

64
Part II: Using the TiVo 

Use the Arrows button to highlight your choice, and press Select to choose.
During its toll-free call, TiVo also fetches a current list of TiVo Service phone
numbers local to your area and performs some other maintenance chores.
Choosing your dial-in number
When TiVo returns from its first call, it displays its first batch of retrieved
goods: a list of available phone numbers in your area. TiVo can make its future
calls through any one of these numbers. Whereas TiVo’s first Setup Call always
uses a toll-free number, some of these numbers, shown in Figure 4-10, may not
be free.
To avoid mysterious long-distance charges next month, grab your local
phone directory to check its “local area codes” list. Most people can quickly
spot a local number for TiVo’s future daily calls. (TiVo’s “daily” calls, made
every 30 hours or so, typically last five to ten minutes apiece.)
When you spot a suitable number, press the Up and Down Arrow buttons
until you’ve highlighted it, and then press Select.

65
Chapter 4: TiVo’s Remote and the Guided Setup

To accommodate different phone setups, TiVo also asks whether you need to
dial the number only, the prefix followed by the number, or add a 1 before the
prefix and the number. Choose the format your phone company prefers, and
press Select.
If you’re having trouble finding a free number, check online for the most
recent list at http://www3.tivo.com/tivo-misc/popfinder.do. You may
want to call your local phone company to make sure a number is really local.
Also, TiVo adds new numbers fairly often. When it adds one for your area
code, it lets you know through a message, available through TiVo’s opening
screen. Finally, depending on your calling plan, an out-of-state number may
be less expensive than an in-state number.
If you can’t find a local number — but you have a broadband (always “on”)
Internet connection — I explain how to connect TiVo to your computer, piggy-
back on its Internet connection for free, and bypass phone calls altogether.
See chapter 8.
Telling TiVo your television setup
With the phone call setup squared away, TiVo now needs to know about its
living conditions: Is it connected to a cable box, for instance? Antenna?
Satellite dish?
Figure 4-10:
Make sure
you choose
a local
number for
TiVo’s daily
phone call.
66
Part II: Using the TiVo 

Most of these questions involve choosing Yes or No answers and selecting
your provider from the list. If you choose Cable, for instance, TiVo lists the
providers in your area and lets you choose yours from the list.
Choosing your package
Here’s where a copy of your cable or satellite bill comes in handy. Do you
have Digital Service? Regular? Any special or premium packages? None of
those? Without my bill in front of me, I never would have known to choose
“Digital Extended Basic,” as shown in Figure 4-11.
If you’re not sure and don’t have a monthly bill within grasp, choose None of
the Above. You can figure it out later by choosing your channels manually in
the next step.
Choosing your received channels
Why, some readers may ask, do you have to choose your channels from a list
when you’ve just told TiVo exactly what service you receive? Shouldn’t TiVo
be able to figure them out?
Actually, TiVo does figure them out, and it presents you with a fairly cus-
tomized list, shown in Figure 4-12. (Note the checkmarks next to each station,
meaning TiVo assumes you receive those channels.) However, not everybody
watches all of their available channels — especially the really boring ones.
Here’s your chance to remove the boring stuff.
Figure 4-11:
Choose your
type of
television
package
from TiVo’s
list of
options
offered in
your area.
67
Chapter 4: TiVo’s Remote and the Guided Setup

If the channels look unfamiliar, press the Back Arrow button and choose a dif-
ferent service package until you find the right match.
When the channels finally match what you receive, you have three options:
 Done selecting channels: Choose this if TiVo guessed all your channels
correctly and you’re itching to move forward.
 Check all channels: Choose this when you’ve made a mistake and want
to select them all. TiVo places a checkmark next to each option.
 Uncheck all channels: This removes all the checkmarks.
Surprisingly enough, “Uncheck all channels” sometimes works out best. This
option lets you pick and choose among the listed channels, checking only the
channels you watch. That weeds out the channels you’d never watch, keep-
ing them from cluttering your onscreen show listings.
 Uncheck channels dedicated to shopping, foreign language broadcasts,
24-hour soap operas, children’s programming, college stations, courts,
government, or any other topic you never watch. Some premium pack-
ages dedicate blocks of channels that play different categories of music,
for instance; make sure those are unchecked.
Figure 4-12:
A check-
mark by a

it.
68
Part II: Using the TiVo 

 Don’t remember which channel is which? Search your cable/satellite
company’s Web site for its list of channel numbers, station names, and
descriptions of their programming. Or, just type in the channel’s num-
bers to view it immediately; press the Left Arrow button to return to this
menu and make your decision.
 Don’t check a channel unless you’re sure you actually receive it. After
being set up, TiVo will display show descriptions for every channel
you’ve checked on this list. If you choose to record a show on a channel
you don’t receive, TiVo will record a black screen.
 If you accidentally check a channel you don’t like, TiVo might record
some of their programming as Suggestions. (I explain Suggestions in
Chapter 6.) If you spot this happening, come back here and remove the
channel from your list.
Telling TiVo about your box 
and connections
You’re almost to the end of the Guided Setup; don’t lose hope. TiVo needs to
know which cables you’ve connected to it and where those cables come
from. If you told TiVo earlier that you receive channels through a cable box,
for example, it asks which cables you used. Eager to please, TiVo even shows
a friendly picture of possible cable combinations, as shown in Figure 4-13.
Figure 4-13:
Press the
Up and
Down
Arrows, and
TiVo tests its

signals.
69
Chapter 4: TiVo’s Remote and the Guided Setup

Press the Up or Down Arrow to move between potential hookups; for each
hookup you select, TiVo checks for an incoming TV signal. In Figure 4-13, TiVo
checks for incoming video on its Coax connector. Because it didn’t find any, it
reported “No Video.”
Press the Up or Down Arrow until TiVo reports that the connection is “OK.”
Then press Select to continue.
Connection not working? Better head back to Chapter 3 for a recheck of your
cables.
Channel changing
If you’re hooked up to a cable or satellite box, TiVo needs to know whether
you used the little “tape-on” Infrared connectors or connected a serial cable
between TiVo and your cable or satellite box’s serial port. (I cover this in
Chapter 3.)
Press the Up or Down Arrow to make your choice; then press Select to move
to the next step.
Choose type of cable/satellite box
TiVo works with a wide variety of cable and satellite boxes. Check the box for
its manufacturer’s name, usually written across the front or back. Then use
the Arrow buttons to select your box’s manufacturer from the list (as shown
in Figure 4-14), and press Select to continue.
Figure 4-14:
Choosing
the right
brand of box
ensures
TiVo knows
how to talk
with it.
70
Part II: Using the TiVo 

TiVo needs to know your box’s manufacturer so it can mimic the language the
box uses to talk with its remote control. You’ll control both the TV and
cable/satellite box through TiVo’s remote, so you won’t need those remotes
anymore. (Two less remotes for the coffee table!)
Choose two- or three-digit displays
Even when TiVo knows the specific brand of your cable/satellite box, it doesn’t
know the exact model. Some boxes only have a two-digit display, meaning you
never have to press more than two numbers to change a channel. Other boxes,
typically digital boxes, let you press three digits. (These boxes typically let
you enter channels like “200.”)
Choose whether you see two or three digits on your box’s display, and press
Enter.
Sometimes TiVo needs to know whether your box expects you to press Enter
after typing in the numbers, or if the box automatically jumps to the correct
channel when you press the last number of its channel. If you press Enter
after entering a channel number, choose Yes; otherwise, choose No. 
Choose speed of channel changing
This one can make a lot of difference, so be careful. When you enter a channel
on TiVo’s remote, TiVo translates that channel into the language of your cable/
satellite box. Then, it sends the channel request to the box. This extra bit of
translating and sending causes a short delay whenever you change channels.
To reduce that delay, TiVo wants to send the signal as quickly as your box can
receive it. The only way to discover your box’s channel changing speed is to
test it. So, after asking you to double-check your cable connections, TiVo asks
you to try different codes used by your particular box, as shown in Figure 4-15.
Highlight a code by pressing the Up or Down Arrow; then test the code by
pressing the TiVo remote’s Channel Up button. (Feel free to press it several
times, to make sure it’s really working reliably.) Each time, TiVo displays the
currently selected channel.
Depending on your model of box, TiVo may ask other questions — whether
you need to press “Enter” after entering a channel’s numbers, for instance.
 Spend some time with this part of setup, especially if you watch a lot of
live TV. You might try rearranging the little TiVo remotes you fastened to
the cable/satellite box for optimum speed. Most people find the “Medium”
speed to work best, and it isn’t really much slower than “Fast.”
 Be sure to hide your old remote, the one that belonged to the
cable/satellite box. If you accidentally use it, you might inadvertently
change the channel while TiVo’s recording a show.
71
Chapter 4: TiVo’s Remote and the Guided Setup

Letting TiVo make its first Program Call
When you finally finish TiVo’s Guided Setup, it doesn’t toss you much of a
cookie. That’s because TiVo needs about a half hour to download details
about each show received by each of your channels for the next two weeks.
And after hanging up the phone, TiVo then needs to index that mammoth
chunk of new information, cataloging all the actors, directors, themes, rat-
ings, and other handy informational tidbits.
Simply put, your TiVo will be very busy for the next four to eight hours, as
shown in Figure 4-16. Feel free to watch, pause, and rewind live TV, but you
won’t be able to record anything until TiVo finishes sorting its new information.
 Leave TiVo plugged in during this session to avoid serious problems. In
fact, you should always leave TiVo plugged in so it can record shows no
matter when they’re on. (Whenever TiVo is plugged in, it’s automatically
turned on.) Only unplug TiVo when you need to move it. If your TiVo
does lose power during this stage, restart the Guided Setup. After that,
TiVo can handle power outages on its own.
 This long delay only happens during TiVo’s initial setup, fortunately. For
the rest of its calls, TiVo merely grabs a single day’s programming infor-
mation, and it retains full functionality all the while.

72
Part II: Using the TiVo 

 When TiVo finishes its call, it asks you to press the remote’s TiVo button
to move to its opening screen, TiVo Central. (You may see an animation
in between.) Press the remote’s Live TV button to begin watching live
TV; you can still watch live TV while waiting for TiVo to finish indexing.
 Feel free to spend this time testing TiVo’s tricks for live TV, which I cover
in Chapter 5. When TiVo tells you it’s finished, head to Chapter 6, where I
explain how to record your favorite shows.
Fine-Tuning TiVo’s Remote
You’re able to change channels using TiVo’s remote immediately after com-
pleting TiVo’s onscreen Guided Setup. But if you invest a little more time,
TiVo’s remote can also control your TV’s volume level and mute button, as
well as its power switch.
Or, if you’ve routed TiVo’s sound through your home stereo, TiVo’s remote
can control that, instead. The rest of this section explains how to program
TiVo’s remote to handle these additional tasks.

73
Chapter 4: TiVo’s Remote and the Guided Setup

Making TiVo’s remote control the power,
volume, and mute switch of your TV
(or stereo)
Introducing TiVo’s remote to your TV works much like hooking up friends at a
party; let them know a little about each other, then wait to see if they hit it
off. To make things comfortable between TiVo’s remote and your TV (or
stereo), sometimes the remote just needs to know the brand name.
Follow these steps to help the two become friends:
1. Go to TiVo’s Remote Control Setup screen.
Press the TiVo button to go to TiVo Central (the main menu). Next, select
TiVo Messages & Setup, then Settings, then TiVo DVR Setup, then finally,
Remote Control Setup.
2. Choose Remote Control – TV (power, volume, mute).
3. Select your TV’s brand from the onscreen list.
TiVo lists code numbers popular for your brand of TV, as shown in
Figure 4-17, for you to test.
Figure 4-17:
TiVo lists
codes
commonly
used by
your brand
of TV.
74
Part II: Using the TiVo 

4. Enter one of the listed codes into TiVo’s remote.
During this two-step process, you tell the remote which button to pro-
gram; then you assign a “code” to that button.
First, cover the remote’s front end with your hand, blocking any signals
while you punch buttons. While blocking the remote, simultaneously
hold down the remote’s TV Power button and TiVo button for five sec-
onds. (The light on TiVo’s remote stays lit when it’s ready for you to
enter codes.)
Next, type the first listed code into the remote. (That assigns the code to
the remote’s TV Power button.)
5. Test the TiVo remote.
Aim TiVo’s remote at the TV and press the TV Power button. If the TV
turns off, you’re done; you’ve programmed the remote to control your
TV. (Make sure the Mute and Volume controls work, as well.) If it doesn’t
work, repeat Step 4 and try the next listed code.
 If your TiVo’s hooked up through your stereo, you don’t need to fiddle
with your TV’s volume or mute. Instead, control your stereo’s volume by
using almost the same procedure. Just choose the “Remote Control – AV
Receiver” option in Step 2, and select your brand of stereo in Step 3.
Then see if it works in Step 4. Repeat until done.
 If none of the listed codes work, TiVo can still try to guess the right code
for your remote control (if you’re up to the challenge). I describe the
process in the next section.
 To accommodate TVs with several inputs, program your remote’s “TV
Input” control to switch between them. To do that, repeat these steps,
but choose Remote Control – TV Input in Step 2. Also, simultaneously
hold down the TV Input and TiVo buttons for five seconds in Step 4.
Searching for remote codes
If your TV or home stereo won’t embrace any of TiVo’s suggested codes, TiVo
lets you search for them semi-automatically, trying every combination in the
hopes that you’ll stumble across the right one by accident.
The good news: You might uncover the secret code that cures your remote’s
problems.
The bad news: The process is dreadfully boring, and, depending on your luck,
could consume 20 minutes of your life with absolutely nothing to show for it.
75
Chapter 4: TiVo’s Remote and the Guided Setup

If you’re ready to chance it, here are the steps:
1. Enter the code to tell the remote what you want.
Hold down the button combination that tells the remote what action to
take. Table 4-1 explains what buttons to hold down for each action.

(Once you’ve entered the initial code, the remote’s red light remains lit
to show you it’s ready for action.)
3. Point the remote at the TV or stereo and press Chan Up.
If pressing Chan Up worked, you’re in luck! Quickly press the Enter
button; your remote assigns that code to the button you pressed with
the TiVo button in Step 1.
If nothing happened, repeat Step 3. Then again. And again. Don’t move
too quickly, or you might miss your chance to push Enter when a code
works.
When the remote’s red light finally turns off, it has given up. You’re out
of luck. (I was out of luck with our aging Proton NT-333 television.
However, the listed code worked fine with our Sony stereo, so every-
thing worked out fine.)

Part II: Using the TiVo 

Part II
Using the TiVo

In this part . . .
W
hen ﬁrst hooked up, TiVo is the worst sort of
houseguest: all demands and no gifts.
For instance, TiVo immediately demands money in the
form of subscription fees. Then it demands to know what
TV channels you receive, and how they enter your house.
Then, it demands to know your favorite shows, so it can
begin recording them.
Even after you fulﬁll these ﬁrst few requests, don’t expect
much from a new TiVo for the ﬁrst few days; TiVo can only
record your shows when they air. That means TiVo usually
takes a week to transform from a demanding houseguest
to a humble servant that rewards you with gifts whenever
you turn on your television.
This part of the book serves as your training manual
through these rough few days of teaching your TiVo
exactly how you want it to behave in your home. When
you’re through, TiVo will perform amazing tricks that
you’ll love to show off to visiting friends and neighbors.

lthough TiVo’s talents lie mainly in finding and recording your shows
automatically, it also enhances live television. This chapter covers all
your new live TV tricks: pausing the action, creating Instant Replays, and
slowing everything down for detailed frame-by-frame analysis.
With TiVo, you rarely need your TV’s remote, nor the remote for your cable or
satellite box. Stuff them both under the couch, quickly. Thanks to all your hard
work in Chapter 4, almost everything now happens with TiVo’s remote — even
live TV.
Turning On and Watching Live TV
TiVo offers several magic hat tricks with live TV; some to be expected, others
a pleasant surprise. When you first turn on your TV, for instance, you usually
see live TV on the screen, just like before TiVo arrived.

Press the TV Power button on your TiVo’s remote to turn on your TV; the TV
displays whatever channel it’s currently tuned in to.
Or, if your TV’s already turned on, press the Live TV button from any TiVo
menu to jump quickly to the currently playing channel.
The first truly pleasant surprise comes with the Rewind button: When first
turning on the TV and seeing live TV, feel free to hit TiVo’s Rewind button a
bit to catch up. Because TiVo’s always recording something, it constantly
records up to the last half hour of the currently tuned live show, just in case
you might want to watch it. Quite a thoughtful robot, that TiVo.
As you watch live TV, TiVo won’t forget your scheduled recordings. In fact,
when it needs to record one, it lets you know a few minutes beforehand: TiVo
explains what show it needs to record and asks permission to change the
channel, as shown in Figure 5-1.
If you don’t press any button at all, TiVo assumes you’ve nodded off and it’s
expected to record your show as scheduled. So, when the recording time
begins, TiVo changes the channel automatically and records your scheduled
show.
Figure 5-1:
When TiVo
needs to
change the
channel to
record a
show, it lets
you know.
78
Part II: Using the TiVo 

But if you’re so deeply engrossed in live TV that you simply must keep watch-
ing, choose the “Stay on this channel (cancel recording)” option and press
Select. TiVo won’t change the channel, and you can finish your live TV show.
However, because TiVo wasn’t allowed to change the channel, you lose your
originally scheduled recording.
 If you demand full access to live television — without TiVo interrupting
you when it needs to record a different show — you must hook up your
TiVo and TV set a little differently. I explore several options in Chapter 3
that let you watch live TV uninterrupted while TiVo dutifully records
your shows in the background.
 You may also jump to live TV by selecting Watch Live TV from the TiVo
Central menu.
 Pressing the Rewind or Fast-Forward button speeds up the action three-
fold in the appropriate direction. Pressing again increases the speed 30
times faster; one more press increases 60 times faster. (Pressing a fourth
time reverts to three times faster, as punishment for the greedy.)
 Is TiVo’s remote having problems turning your TV on or off? It’s time to
program TiVo’s remote, a task I describe at the end of Chapter 4. (If you
pipe your TV’s sound through your home stereo, the same section
describes how to control the stereo with your remote.)
Recording Live TV
If you’ve suddenly stumbled across an intriguing live show that you wish
you’d recorded, it’s not too late. Just press the Record button; TiVo brings up
the menu shown in Figure 5-2.
To record immediately, press Select. TiVo immediately grabs as much of the
show as it currently holds in its “buffer” (up to a half hour), tosses the show
onto your Now Playing list, and then continues to record the show until it
ends. You won’t miss a single second.
To create a Season Pass that records the entire series, select Season Pass &
other options. From there, you may record that individual show, as well as
choose options for your Season Pass. (I cover Season Pass in Chapter 6.)
79
Chapter 5: Watching and Recording Live TV

Finally, if you pressed the Record button by mistake, choose the third option:
Don’t record this showing. TiVo quickly removes its menu and pretends it
didn’t notice your fumbled fingering.
 The simplest option is the first: Press Select to record immediately. After
TiVo has begun recording your newfound show, mosey off to the Season
Pass area and tell TiVo to record all the episodes, if you want.
 When you record live shows with the Record button, TiVo uses Best
Quality. (I explain recording-quality settings in Chapter 6.) Because TiVo
always displays live TV at Best Quality, it simply keeps those settings
when recording the rest of the show.
 If you’re waffling on whether to grant a Season Pass to a newly discov-
ered live show, press the Record button and choose Season Pass & other
options. From there, choose View Upcoming Showings to peek at future
shows in that series. That helps you decide whether the show warrants
an entire Season Pass, or whether the current episode is enough.
 When you record from live TV, you’ll find your newly recorded show
waiting on TiVo’s Now Playing list, which I cover in Chapter 6.

Part II: Using the TiVo 

Pausing and Restarting Live TV
TiVo’s Pause button works just like the one on a VCR: To pause a TV show,
press the remote’s Pause button. To begin playing the show from where it’s
paused, press the Pause button again. (Or press Play.)
Unlike a VCR, though, TiVo can pause live TV as well as recorded shows.
While the live show’s paused, TiVo continues to save the rest of the show in
its buffer for up to 30 minutes.
If you don’t return within 30 minutes, TiVo assumes you’ve given up; it begins
playing back the show from where you paused it. (You’ll probably hear the
TV’s sound blast back on, alerting you of your neglect.)
If you ever think you’ll be away more than 30 minutes — which is quite some
time, if you think about it — press the Record button to record the show for
later viewing.
81
Chapter 5: Watching and Recording Live TV
What’s TiVo’s buffer?
TiVo records live television, 24 hours a day.
When TiVo isn’t recording something you’ve
requested, or a show it thinks you may enjoy,
TiVo simply records your currently tuned chan-
nel. It stuffs the incoming video into a constantly
updated, 30-minute-long pouch called the buffer.
When the buffer fills up with 30 minutes of video,
TiVo begins deleting as quickly as it records. It
pushes the oldest stuff out of the buffer to make
room for the new. TiVo’s buffer — that 30-minute
holding tank of Best Quality video — comes in
handy in several ways.
When you switch to live TV, feel free to press
Rewind: TiVo dips into its buffer, letting you view
the last half-hour of that channel. Or, if you
press Record, TiVo grabs any part of that show
from the buffer and saves it along with the rest
of the show. By grabbing the buffer, TiVo can
save part of the live show you may have missed.
The buffer has one important oddity: Whenever
the channel changes, TiVo empties its entire
buffer and begins filling it with fresh recordings
from the new channel. Because TiVo emptied
the buffer, there’s nothing for you to rewind after
a channel change. Change channels again —
even back to the first show — and TiVo empties
its buffer yet again.
TiVo doesn’t need to change channels when
you watch a recorded show, or when you head
to a different menu, so the buffer remains intact.
But when TiVo needs to record a show on a dif-
ferent channel — or when you switch to live TV
and change the channel — TiVo dumps its
buffer from the old channel and starts afresh.

Instant Replays and Slow Motion
The much-heralded Instant Replay button is really just a mini-Rewind button.
It makes TiVo skip back eight seconds and begin playing again, instanta-
neously. But, gosh, is it handy.
With each subsequent press, it jumps back another eight seconds. Press four
times, for instance, to jump back about a half-minute.
Press the Slow button, and TiVo slows down the action for greater detail.
When watching in Slow motion — or paused — press the Fast-Forward or
Rewind button to move back and forth, frame by frame.
When returning to a paused show, press the Instant Replay button to start
the action again. TiVo jumps back eight seconds and instantly begins playing
the show from that point. Eight seconds of replay is usually enough to
remember where you left off.
Finding Your Place in the Status Bar
When watching live TV on TiVo, it’s easy to lose track of reality. With all that
pausing and rewinding, where are you in relation to “real” time? Are you
watching something that aired five minutes ago? Is the show really “over?” Or
have you caught up with real time? How can you figure it all out?
TiVo tosses you a bone with its Status Bar — a green bar riding along the
screen’s bottom, shown in both Figures 5-3 and 5-4. (Pressing Play or Pause
always brings up the Status Bar.) The Status Bar provides a visual timeline,
quickly pointing out your current location during your time travels.
The long Status Bar always represents one full hour of live TV. The light-
colored block inside the Status Bar represents TiVo’s recorded portion of the
live show. By looking at the size of the block — and its location within the
hour time slot — you can gauge how much of the show has been recorded,
what hour you’re watching, and which portion of the show you’re currently
viewing.
In Figure 5-4, for instance, the numbers straddling the Status Bar reveal that
you’re viewing an hour-long block of live time between 10:30 and 11:30. To
help judge your point in time, little white lines separate the bar into four
quarters of 15 minutes each.
82
Part II: Using the TiVo 

Note the light portion of the bar, directly beneath the numbers 11:14. That
light-shaded block (it’s green, when seen onscreen) represents how much of
the live show TiVo has recorded. (The light block keeps growing longer as
you watch.) The block’s right end represents the place where you catch up
with live TV. Its left end, by contrast, shows where TiVo began recording.

Chapter 5: Watching and Recording Live TV

See the little white line near the middle of the recorded section? That line
shows you the exact portion of the live show you’re currently viewing. In
Figure 5-4, for instance, you’re watching the recorded portion that originally
aired at 11:14. Got it?
 Press Play to view the Status Bar; press Play again to clear it.
 The larger the block within the Status Bar, the greater the amount of
show TiVo has recorded. The block never covers more than half of the
Status Bar, though, because TiVo only saves a half hour of live TV.
 The “Paused” symbol in Figure 5-4 means you’ve paused the show, view-
ing a single frame onscreen. When you press Play to see the show again,
the Paused symbol becomes a single triangle that faces forward. When
fast-forwarding or rewinding, two or three triangles appear, depending
on the speed. (The triangles always point in the direction you’re
moving.)
 These concepts sound a little confusing, but that’s why TiVo uses the
Status Bar to let you see the action in progress. After you’ve paused,
fast-forwarded, and rewound a little bit, the Status Bar’s meaning will
become quite clear — a visual CliffsNotes explaining the size of TiVo’s
buffer and the portion you’re currently watching.
Viewing Information about 
the Show You’re Watching
When you jump to live TV, TiVo normally displays a banner explaining the
current time, the channel, show name, and description. Press Clear to clear
the banner, or wait for it to disappear after about five seconds.
The banner also appears whenever you change channels. If you find it too
large, feel free to experiment with its size. When the banner appears, press
the Right Arrow to toggle between the banner’s three possible sizes: large
(Figure 5-5), medium (Figure 5-6), and small (Figure 5-7).
Feel free to leave the banner at the size you prefer. TiVo subsequently uses
that banner when you change channels or jump to live TV.
84
Part II: Using the TiVo 

 Whenever the banner’s not visible, press the Right Arrow to bring it back
to the screen. Press the Left Arrow to clear the screen and go back to
your show.
 The Right Arrow brings up the banner in the same size it last appeared.
Pressing the Info (or Display) button, by contrast, always brings up the
full-sized banner. Stick with whatever method you prefer.
 You can shorten the length of time the Channel Banner stays onscreen in
TiVo’s Setup menus, which I cover in Chapter 7.
 Pressing Clear immediately rids the screen of any TiVo menu overlays,
letting you see what you’re trying to watch.
 When the full-sized Channel Banner appears, a press of the Down Arrow
reveals other options: Record sits at the top; below it, Parental Controls
let you place the current channel on the children’s “restricted” list (cov-
ered in Chapter 7). The bottom icon (rarely used) jumps to TiVo’s
messages.

Changing Channels
You change channels with TiVo’s remote just as you did with your old
remote — the one that came with your TV or cable/satellite box.
Just press the Channel button toward the top to advance a channel; press the
lower part of the button to move down a channel. TiVo dutifully changes the
channel accordingly.
The only time you may run into something odd is if TiVo’s currently recording
the show you’re watching. TiVo must stay tuned to the current channel in
order to record the show, so TiVo fills you in on its dilemma, as shown in
Figure 5-8.
If you don’t want TiVo to finish its recording, choose “Change the channel,
stop recording.” TiVo stops recording, saves the portion it has already
recorded, and lets you change channels all you want.

Chapter 5: Watching and Recording Live TV

But if you want TiVo to finish recording the show, press Select to abandon
your channel change. TiVo will continue recording the current show.
 If you want full access to live television — without interrupting TiVo’s
recordings — head back to Chapter 3. There, I explain different ways of
connecting TiVo to your TV that let you watch live TV while TiVo
records other shows on different channels.
 TiVo normally changes channels more slowly than your old TV or cable/
satellite box remote. But if TiVo’s not changing channels properly, check
out the section “Connecting TiVo with a Cable or Satellite Box” in
Chapter 3. You may need to adjust TiVo’s setup.
Viewing and Recording through 
the Channel Guide
When you browse through live TV, ignoring TiVo’s recorded shows, the
burden of finding a decent show plops squarely into your own lap. To help
out during your time of need, TiVo offers a hand with its Channel Guide.
TiVo’s Guide resembles the TV listings found in newspapers and magazines,
but it’s much more fun: TiVo lets you record upcoming shows simply by high-
lighting their names and pressing the Record button. Here’s how it all works.
Press the Guide button while watching live TV to bring up TiVo’s Channel
Guide: a handy list of channels and their current offerings, shown in Figure 5-9.
When the Guide appears, the left side highlights your currently viewed chan-
nel; the right side places your current show at the list’s top. In Figure 5-9, for
instance, I’m watching a show called “The Screen Savers” on TECHTV.
Beneath “The Screen Savers,” the Guide lists upcoming shows: “Anime
Unleashed” will air immediately after “The Screen Savers.”
Press the Up or Down Arrow, and TiVo moves to the next channel, automati-
cally updating the Guide’s right side to show that new channel’s upcoming
shows. Feel free to browse the left or right side of the list, looking at different
channels or reading descriptions of a channel’s upcoming shows.
Spot something good? Highlight the name and press Select to tune to that
channel’s currently playing show.
88
Part II: Using the TiVo 

Spot something so good you want to record it when it airs? Highlight the
show’s name, and press the Record button. When the Record menu appears,
press Select to record the show. Pushed Record by mistake? Then choose
“Don’t record this showing” to cancel the recording.
If you receive a lot of channels, all those show listings can be overwhelming.
Pressing Enter while viewing the Channel Guide lets you customize the list in
several ways, as shown in Figure 5-10. That lets you filter out shows that
don’t interest you, making it easier to spot the ones that do.
Here’s the rundown on customizing the Guide for your immediate needs:
Channels: This selection allows three options. Choosing Favorites tells TiVo
to list only your Favorite channels, making it easier to find good shows.
Haven’t set up your Favorite channels? Just leave the Channels selection set
to channels “You receive.” (Only the insatiably curious select “All.” That lets
them see every available channel, whether they receive them or not.)
Day: Change this to browse shows airing on different dates.

Chapter 5: Watching and Recording Live TV

Time: Usually used in combination with the Day option, this lets you view
shows playing at different times.
Style: TiVo normally displays the “TiVo style” guide shown in Figure 5-10.
Switching to the “Grid Guide” displays a TV Guide magazine-style layout,
shown in Figure 5-11. (I find the TiVo style faster and more manageable than
the Grid Guide.)
Filter: This narrows the lists to display specific show categories. Choose
Movies, for instance, and the Guide “grays out” everything but movies from
the list. That makes it easier to see what movies are currently playing or will
be airing soon. (TiVo offers filters down to the most miniscule category.)
 If the Guide suddenly looks weird, and you can’t see all your shows or
your channels, you’ve probably accidentally turned on a filter. Press
Enter while viewing the Guide, and change Filtering to “Off.” Everything
should reappear.
 Press the Fast-Forward or Rewind buttons to advance or reverse the
guide by 90 minutes; press the Channel Up/Down buttons to move up or
down page by page.
 Several TiVo options, including the Guide, let you limit your lists to
Favorite channels. That cuts out channels you rarely watch, clearing
lists of clutter. I explain how to put channels on a Favorites list in
Chapter 7.

Part II: Using the TiVo 

Weaning Yourself from Live TV
Watching TiVo’s recorded shows looks the same as watching live TV. There’s
no visible difference on the screen. The biggest difference between the two is
what’s missing from live TV:
 You can’t fast-forward through commercials.
 You can’t fast-forward through the boring parts.
 Live TV makes you watch TV whenever your show airs. If you’re not
home, you miss the show.
 Biggest of all, though, live TV carries no promise that you’ll find some-
thing worth watching.
TiVo offers these things only when you’re watching recorded TV. That’s why
most TiVo owners eventually stop watching live TV. Their TiVo lets them con-
trol their TV, and it’s frustrating when that feeling disappears.
The point? Although TiVo lets you watch live TV, try to wean yourself away
from it. After you’ve owned TiVo for a few days, it will begin stockpiling your
favorite shows. Don’t keep watching live TV out of habit. Instead, head
Figure 5-11:
The Grid
Guide
displays a
TV Guide-
style layout.
91
Chapter 5: Watching and Recording Live TV

straight for the recorded shows on TiVo’s Now Playing list. Not only will they
be worth watching, but they let you skip commercials.
Whenever you turn on your television, press the TiVo button twice. That
immediately takes you to your Now Playing list.
With a TiVo, you never need to watch live TV again.
Live TV Remote Shortcuts
Here are the most common things you’ll do with the remote when watching
live TV. Some tricks involve pressing a single button several times or pressing
several buttons in sequence:
Press Info (called Display on DirecTV TiVos) to display the full-sized Channel
Banner; press again to remove. When the banner isn’t visible, press the Right
Arrow to bring up the banner in your favorite size; press the Left Arrow to
remove it.
The Guide button brings up a list of your channels, their upcoming shows,
and a description of the current show.
Pressing the Right Arrow while the banner is displayed presents a small,
medium, and large version of the banner. Press the Left Arrow at the size you
prefer; the banner remains that size during channel changes.
Use Clear to remove any TiVo menus from the screen so you can see what
you’re trying to watch. (Works great for examining paused scenes in detail.)
Record the program you’re watching, ending the recording at the show’s end.
(Press Record again to stop recording before the show ends.)
Pause the action.
Jump back eight seconds and begin playing again.
Fast-forward more quickly with each key press. When pressed while the
screen is paused or in slow motion, TiVo moves forward, frame by frame.
92
Part II: Using the TiVo 

Rewind more quickly with each key press. When pressed while the screen is
paused or in slow motion, TiVo moves backward, frame by frame.
If you’ve rewound or used Instant Replay, you can press Advance to catch up
with live TV.
Jump back to the last channel you viewed.
DirecTV TiVo owners can press the Down Arrow to jump to the box’s second
tuner.

iVo frees you from your TV’s “be there or miss it” scheduling. TiVo makes
you the boss and enforces your rules. But how do you tell TiVo — a little
robotic box — exactly what your rules are? As this chapter shows, it’s
refreshingly easy.
You’ll create a “Season Pass” that makes TiVo scurry through the airwaves,
capturing every episode of your favorite TV series, no matter when it flies by.
Want to capture more than just a TV series? Create a “WishList” that tells
TiVo to grab every appearance of your favorite actor, everything created by
your favorite director, or even shows about your favorite subjects, no matter
how esoteric.

TiVo will even fetch that unforgettable movie with its forgettable title —
something with the word “schoolhouse” in the title, perhaps? That single
word is enough for a TiVo WishList to hunt it down when it airs.
Once TiVo begins grabbing your shows, you’ll no longer watch TV. You’ll be
watching TiVo, as it customizes your television viewing around your schedule.
Creating a Season Pass 
to Record a Series
TiVo’s Season Pass catches every episode of your favorite show, no matter
when it airs. If a sneaky network moves your show to a different day or time,
TiVo still grabs it. You no longer need to track down your shows.
TiVo’s Season Pass automatically records shows that have a recurring title:
“Friends,” “The Sopranos,” or “I Love Lucy,” for instance.
Although the word “season” often implies something temporary, TiVo’s
Season Pass captures all seasons of a show: past, present, and future. (A
Season Pass can record new episodes exclusively, if you wish, but it doesn’t
restrict you to them.) A Season Pass also limits that show’s recording to a
single channel; that keeps TiVo from recording reruns of old shows aired on
different channels. (If you want those episodes, too, create a WishList,
instead, described later in this chapter.)
When navigating any of TiVo’s menus, the Right Arrow moves to the next TiVo
menu, letting you fine-tune your previous selection. To back up to a previous
menu, press the Left Arrow. (Little onscreen arrows in each menu point to the
directions you may travel.)
1. Press the TiVo button to bring up the TiVo Central screen.
TiVo Central, shown in Figure 6-1, provides a launching pad for all TiVo
operations. When in doubt, head here and select your general task; each
subsequent menu lets you fine-tune your request.
2. Choose Pick Programs to Record.
Start here to schedule any recording or search for upcoming shows.
3. Choose Search by Title.
Season Passes apply mostly to a TV series with a title. To record
“Frasier,” for instance, you’d select Search by Title.
To choose shows to record based on something other than a recurring
title — all shows with actress Uma Thurman, for instance — create a
WishList, instead, described later in this chapter.
96

4. Choose the show’s category.
Feel free to narrow down the search by choosing a specific category, as

5. Select the show’s title.
Press the Arrow keys to begin spelling out the show’s name: Highlight
each letter, and then press Select. After you enter a few letters, TiVo
begins listing possible matches along the right, as shown in Figure 6-3,
narrowing down the list with each entered letter.
Typed the wrong letter? Erase it by pressing the remote’s Rewind
button. If you’re quick, your guests won’t notice.
When you spot your show’s title on the list, stop pressing letters, press
the Arrow keys to highlight your show, and press Select.
6. Choose Get a Season Pass.
As shown in Figure 6-4, TiVo located the “Frasier” series; it displays a
description of the first upcoming show and offers five options:
Watch now: Rarely seen, this option appears only if your show’s cur-
rently airing. Choosing this abandons your Season Pass quest, quickly
jumping to the live show.
Record this episode: TiVo offers to record only the upcoming episode
listed in the show description. This also abandons your Season Pass
quest and jumps to the next step.

Get a Season Pass: This no-nonsense option immediately creates your
Season Pass with the default options. To see or change those options,
select Options, which moves you to the next step.
View upcoming episodes: Not sure if the series merits an entire Season
Pass? This option displays descriptions of episodes airing in the next ten
to 12 days. (If the series looks promising, press the Left Arrow to select a
Season Pass.)
When viewing show descriptions, press the Channel Up or Down button
to move quickly to the next description.
Don’t do anything: An “out” for finger fumbles, this cancels everything,
quickly returning to TiVo Central.
7. Choose your Recording Options.
Experienced TiVo users often tailor a new Season Pass by changing its
Recording Options, as shown in Figure 6-5. Recording Options appear
whenever selecting any program for recording, whether through a
Season Pass, a WishList, or individually.

Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows

Record Quality: TiVo offers four types of recording quality, from Best to
Basic. Best quality looks best onscreen, of course, but hogs the most
recording space. Try lower quality levels, should your TiVo be tight on
space.
As a general guide, choose Best for fast-paced action films and sports,
High for movies, Medium for talk or cooking shows, and Low for news
and some animation. You won’t know which works best on your TV until
you experiment. (When you’ve found one you like, Chapter 7 explains
how to set it as a default, letting you skip this setting in the future.)
Keep At Most: How many shows should TiVo keep available before delet-
ing the old to make room for the new? Save every episode? Just 10? Five?
One?
Selecting Two often works well, allowing time to catch a missed show.
Raise or lower the number depending on your viewing habits.
When you only want a show’s latest episode — the evening news, for
instance, or last night’s David Letterman — set the recording options to
“First Run Only” and set “Keep At Most” to one episode. As TiVo dutifully
records the newest version, it deletes the old. Whenever you turn on
your TV, TiVo presents the most current episode.

Part II: Using the TiVo 

Show Type: This covers how TiVo deals with reruns. Some love ’em,
some hate ’em.
Repeat & First Run: The best choice by far, this records the latest
shows, as well as repeats that TiVo hasn’t already grabbed in the
past 28 days. That weeds out duplicate recordings, but allows for
reruns you haven’t seen in a while.
First Run Only: This records shows the very first day they air, then
never again.
All including Duplicates: Rarely used, this records all instances of
a show, including duplicates.
Keep Until: Here, you decide how long TiVo keeps an episode before
deleting it to make room for newer requested shows.
Space needed: The best choice, TiVo saves your show for at least
two days and then deletes it only if it needs room for your newly
requested recordings. (You’ll be surprised how long old shows
linger before being deleted.)
Keep until I delete: If you absolutely must see a show, choose Keep
until I delete. This works well to save shows for visitors.
Start Recording: Does your network traditionally start that particular
show a little early? Start TiVo’s recording a few minutes early to compen-
sate. (Don’t overuse this option, though, as your “padding” could keep
TiVo from recording the show that airs directly before this one.)
Stop Recording: Handy for recording live events that often run late, this
tells TiVo to add from one minute to three hours to the show’s sched-
uled ending time. (Great for sporting events and Academy Awards.)
Don’t change recording options: An escape hatch, this option bails out
without making changes and simply uses the default options. (The Left
Arrow does the same thing.)
 To delete or edit an existing Season Pass, visit the Season Pass Manager,
described later in this chapter.
 After you’ve created more than one Season Pass, you should prioritize
them so TiVo knows which one to record if the shows — gasp — air at
the same time. Prioritize them in the Season Pass Manager, covered later
in this chapter.
 Don’t go wild with the “Save until I delete” option, especially for shows
that air frequently. This option hogs storage space, leaving TiVo with
less room to schedule other recordings.
101
Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows

Entering Letters and Numbers 
Using the Remote
Only a handful of hip cell phone users enjoy spelling out names on a small
keypad. To accommodate the rest of us, TiVo provides a fairly intuitive way
to enter names by choosing letters and numbers from an onscreen grid (refer
to Figure 6-3). TiVo also employs a few helpers throughout the process.
For instance, if you manage to peck out a few letters, or perhaps complete a
word, before a slipped thumb sends you dancing off to a different menu, don’t
worry. TiVo remembers what you’d typed — your earlier efforts remain when
you return to the entry menu.
Plus, most items rarely require more than a few letters before TiVo displays
the entire name on the list. You’ll encounter shows that include numbers or
symbols in their names. Table 6-1 shows how to handle those and tosses in a
few tricks for maneuvering the keypad more quickly.

Part II: Using the TiVo 
Where does TiVo gather its show information?
To schedule upcoming shows, TiVo relies mainly
on the information supplied by the networks. The
networks usually label each show with an episode
number, description, length, the stars’ names, and
other information. TiVo buys the data information
from Tribune Media Services and tweaks it for its
own use. (You’ll find much of TiVo’s same data
posted online at www.zap2it.com.)
Whenever TiVo displays a show’s description,
press the remote’s Enter button to see everything
about the show. (You’ll probably have to press
the Page Down button to see it all.)
If a lazy network doesn’t supply a complete
show description, TiVo has difficulty separating
the first runs from the reruns, causing much
hand-wringing. Before damaging your hands, try
solving the dilemma with the Manual Recording
option, covered later in this chapter.

Creating WishLists to Record 
Favorite Things
Some shows don’t qualify for a Season Pass because they lack a specific title.
For instance, you might want to record every movie with Katie Holmes, or all
films directed by Akira Kurosawa. Circus confection lovers may crave shows
discussing “cotton candy.”
That’s where a WishList comes in handy. Created much like a Season Pass,
they’re just as easy to set up.
1. Press the TiVo button to bring up TiVo Central, the starting menu for
most TiVo operations. Then select Pick Programs to Record.
2. Select Search Using a WishList.
The Search Using a WishList screen appears, as shown in Figure 6-6.
Below the menu, TiVo lists your previously created WishLists.
103
Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows

Feel free to highlight an existing WishList to edit or delete it.
3. Choose Create new WishList.
The other option, View all upcoming WishList programs, displays every
show matching your existing lists, letting you pick the ones you want to
record.
4. Select the type of WishList you want to create.
TiVo lets you automatically record any show featuring a certain Actor,
Director, Category, Keyword, or Title. Here’s the rundown:
Actor: TiVo locates any show where that actor participates:
movies, TV shows, talk shows, comedy shows — anything.
Director: TiVo locates movies created by your favorite director.
Category only: This jumps to Step 5, letting you locate shows fit-
ting a specific category — animated children’s shows, for instance,
or specific types of sporting events.
Keyword: The most versatile search, this records shows contain-
ing certain words in their description. Enter “James Bond,” for
instance, to catch any James Bond movie, no matter who starred.

Part II: Using the TiVo 

Title: Can’t remember a movie’s entire title? Enter the words you
do remember to see a list of matches.
Always enter a person’s last name first, followed by a comma, a
space, and their first name. 
5. Select the Category.
Narrow your search, if you want, to certain categories: Kevin Bacon’s
Historical Drama Movies, for instance.
Or, if you chose Category Only in Step 4, here’s your chance to grab
cooking, mystery, or romance shows, or shows from hundreds of other
categories. (Sports fanatics can choose among 93 subcategories, includ-
ing football, baseball, arm wrestling, and table tennis.)
6. If desired, tell TiVo how to record your new WishList.
Automatically grabbing every show your WishList locates can be risky. A
particularly prolific actor could fill up your TiVo’s hard drive in a single
day. To control the amount of shows TiVo records, choose between sev-
eral options, shown in Figure 6-7.
Figure 6-7:
Tell TiVo
how to

105
Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows

View upcoming programs: The safest option, this lists every show
found by your new WishList. This not only confirms that your
WishList catches what you want, but it also lets you pick and
choose, weeding out the awful Gregory Peck movies and seizing
the ones you’re after.
When viewing a list of show descriptions, press the Channel Up or
Down button to move quickly from one description to the next.
Auto-record WishList programs: A dangerous option, this tells
TiVo to automatically record every show matching your criteria.
(TiVo then places that new request at the bottom of your Season
Pass list.)
Edit Actor or Director WishList: This lets you adjust an existing
WishList to meet different needs.
Delete this WishList: After a WishList grabs everything you want,
feel free to delete it.
Ok, don’t change anything: Finished? Select this to wrap it up.
 After creating a new WishList, always choose “View Upcoming Shows” to
make sure the WishList works the way you intended.
 Choosing to Auto-record a WishList item lets you select its Recording
Options, just as for Season Passes. I explain Recording Options, shown
in Figure 6-5, earlier in this chapter’s “Creating a Season Pass to Record a
Series” section.
 Visit your WishLists often to see what they’ve turned up. Select an indi-
vidual WishList, or choose View all upcoming WishList programs to see
everything ferreted out by all your WishLists. When you spot something
good, select its name to record it.
 If a newly requested show conflicts with other scheduled recordings,
choose Cancel. Then select the View Upcoming Episodes option to find
a rerun of the desired show. Most networks repeat their shows several
times throughout the week, and choosing to record a rerun often
resolves the conflict.
 If TiVo’s Now Playing list shows too many shows with the same actor,
director, or category, an Auto-recording WishList may be the culprit.
They’re particularly susceptible to “marathon” programming, where a
station runs episodes or thematically linked films continuously for a day
or two.
106
Part II: Using the TiVo 

 When you create an Auto-recording WishList, TiVo places it at the
bottom of your Season Pass list. To give it a higher priority, see the
upcoming section “Handling Scheduling Conflicts with the Season Pass
Manager.”
 Add upcoming travel destinations to WishList to prepare for your trip.
 Unlike Season Passes, WishLists are made to be deleted. When TiVo has
granted your wish — found all the shows you wanted — feel free to
delete the WishList without remorse.
 The WishList’s Auto-record option has nothing to do with the Save to
VCR feature. I explain how to save a recorded show to your VCR in the
“TiVo’s Now Playing List” section, later in this chapter. 
Handling Scheduling Conflicts with 
the Season Pass Manager
Nobody enjoys deciding between two TV shows that air simultaneously. Yet
TiVo faces that thorny issue whenever it encounters a scheduling conflict.
Which show gets recorded and which gets the boot? Sometimes TiVo can
catch both simply by catching a repeat a day or two after it first airs.
When a conflict can’t be solved by that little trick, TiVo turns to you for guid-
ance in the form of a Season Pass Manager.
That’s a fancy name for a simple list of all your Season Passes — and any
Auto-recording WishLists, too. When faced with a recording conflict, TiVo
records the one with the highest position on the list. Here’s how to manage
your Season Passes, making sure you’ve ranked your shows in order of
importance.
1. From TiVo Central, select Pick Programs to record.
2. Select Season Pass Manager.
TiVo displays your Season Pass Manager, shown in Figure 6-8.
107
Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows

3. Arrange your shows in order of importance.
To rank a show higher or lower, highlight its name with the Arrow keys
and press the Right Arrow key. Then press the Up or Down Arrow keys
to change the show’s list position. Done? Press the Left Arrow to lock it
in place.
As soon as you’re done rearranging your Season Pass order, TiVo begins
recalculating all its scheduled recordings to make sure they comply.
Depending on the amount of shows, TiVo might take a few minutes to
finish recalculating and update its To Do list.
 Place your “just gotta see it” favorites at the list’s top. Place shows with
constant reruns — old sitcoms, for example — near the list’s bottom.
Currently running shows belong closer to the top, especially the ones
that don’t repeat a day or so later.
 Visit your Season Pass Manager often. Your viewing habits will change
through the months, and you’ll probably want to move new Auto-record
WishLists from their initial ranking at the bottom.
 Whenever you rearrange your Season Passes, TiVo recalculates its entire
recording schedule, adjusting it accordingly. Depending on the list’s
length, this can take a few seconds or a few minutes.
 DirecTV TiVos come with two tuners, so they can record two shows
simultaneously. Standalone TiVos, which all have single tuners, can
record only one show at a time. I discuss different TiVo models in
Chapter 2.

Part II: Using the TiVo 

Managing Your Recording Space
TiVo packs all your recorded shows into its built-in suitcase, known as a hard
drive. When TiVo’s hard drive fills up with recorded shows — and TiVo needs
to record a newly requested show — TiVo must delete something to make
room. Here’s how it makes the agonizing decision.
First, TiVo deletes any Suggestions that it automatically recorded for you. In
fact, a lack of Suggestions on your Now Playing list warns that TiVo’s proba-
bly running short on recording space.
Second, TiVo looks at the “Save until” date of each show on your Now Playing
list, taking note of the shows with the oldest “Save until” date. (Any show saved
past its “Save until” date has a yellow icon with an exclamation point inside.)
TiVo then begins clearing the decks by axing the show with the oldest “Save
Until” date. (If you haven’t been fiddling with a show’s “Save until” date or the
Now Playing list’s sorting options, it’s usually the oldest show on your list,
often the one sitting at the list’s bottom.)
 Alarmed? Don’t worry about it. Think about how many shows you missed
before TiVo arrived; you survived. Besides, TiVo constantly brings in fresh
new shows. (And if you miss that particular show desperately, TiVo can
probably pick it up on a rerun, given enough time.)
 To increase storage space, try lowering your recording quality. Instead
of recording everything in Best, try High or Medium quality for some
shows.
 Upgrade your TiVo with a larger hard drive, allowing it to hold more
shows. This can be surprisingly simple, and I walk you through the
easiest do-it-yourself hard drive upgrade in Chapter 12.
Checking TiVo’s List of 
Upcoming Recordings
Using TiVo requires a leap of faith — a suspension of disbelief — that a
mechanical object can really capture all your favorite shows. Your faith in
TiVo will eventually increase as you watch it in action. But the doubters find
relief in TiVo’s “To Do” list.
Found at the bottom of the Pick Programs to Record option, TiVo’s To Do List
shows TiVo’s recording schedule for the days ahead. TiVo’s To Do List in
Figure 6-9, for instance, shows the next scheduled recording is “The
Simpsons,” slated for 7 p.m. on channel 6.
109
Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows

Highlight any listed recording and press Select to view the show’s descrip-
tion, change its recording qualities, or cancel it completely.
 TiVo’s To Do List is always up-to-date except when you’ve recently
changed a Season Pass or WishList. TiVo sometimes takes a minute or
two to reflect the changes.
 Curious folks can view TiVo’s upcoming Suggestions by choosing TiVo
Suggestions from the Pick Programs to Record menu. (You may only
view Suggestions; you can’t cancel or edit them.)
 Sitting atop TiVo’s To Do List lies the View Recording History option.
Here, TiVo explains why shows were deleted or not recorded, along with
its reasoning. If a recording is suddenly missing, for instance, head here
to read things like, “This program was deleted because someone in your
household removed it.” (It provides the time and date of removal so you
can track down the guilty party.)
Manually Recording by 
Time, Day, and Channel
TiVo’s Manual Recording feature offers a last resort option for grabbing
particularly problematic shows.
Figure 6-9:
TiVo’s To Do
List shows
all of its
upcoming
scheduled
recordings.
110
Part II: Using the TiVo 

For instance, the “Comedy Central” channel sometimes neglects to describe
its “South Park” episodes. Instead, the description offers the generic, “Four
boys living in Colorado.” Without a show description, TiVo doesn’t know if
it’s a new episode or not, and TiVo won’t save it as a “First Run” show.
But because I know the exact day and time each new South Park episode airs,
I set up a manual recording telling TiVo to record the episode from that par-
ticular timeslot. That always brings in the new episode, even without a cor-
rect description.
Manual recordings also come in handy for recording parts of shows. Grabbing
the last 15 minutes of “The Tonight Show,” for instance, often catches the
musical guest, skipping the rest.
A press of the Left Arrow backs up to correct mistakes.
1. Choose Pick Programs to Record from TiVo Central.
2. Choose Record by Time or Channel.
3. Choose Manually Record Time/Channel.
4. Select the type of recording, and then press the Right Arrow.
As shown on the left side of Figure 6-10, TiVo offers two choices: One Time
and Repeating. Selecting One Time creates a temporary, single-use record-
ing. Repeating, by contrast, repeatedly captures that same time slot.
Figure 6-10:
When

TiVo can

111
Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows

5. Choose the day or days for the recording, and then press the Right
Arrow.
Press the Up or Down Arrows to select the correct Day. If you chose
Repeating in Step 4, choose when the recording should repeat.
6. Choose a channel for the recording, and then press the Right Arrow.
Enter the channel number with the remote’s keys, or press the Up or
Down Arrows to display the channel.
7. Select the recording time, and then press the Right Arrow.
Using the Up and Down Arrows, choose the hour, minute, and AM/PM
setting for the recording’s Start and Stop times.
8. Press Select to schedule your recording.
TiVo presents one last screen, listing your recording’s Start and Stop
times, Channel, Duration, and Quality. Everything correct? Then press
Select and TiVo slips your new recording into its queue.
Although manual recordings sometimes come in handy, they lack the intelli-
gence of a Season Pass. TiVo won’t know if a show has been rescheduled, for
instance, to adjust the schedule as necessary.
However, they still remain powerful weapons in TiVo’s arsenal for hunting
down shows that elude capture any other way.
You still need a subscription — an Activated TiVo — in order to record manu-
ally by time and date. The older Series 1 TiVos can still record manually with-
out a subscription, but that leads to clock accuracy problems described in
Chapter 2.
Finding Interesting Shows to Record
When completely ignored, TiVo won’t record much. After all, it can’t find and
record your favorite shows unless it knows what to look for. But after you
toss TiVo a few scraps, it sure knows how to run.
Here are some quick and easy ways to toss some tidbits to your TiVo. After
confiding a few show titles, subjects, or actors, your Now Playing list will
swell with shows you’ll enjoy.
112
Part II: Using the TiVo 

This takes a small effort on your part, but TiVo’s doing all the major work,
tracking the shows down and making sure they’re available when you’re
ready.
Recording movies you 
missed at the theater
Everybody has postponed a trip to the theater until it’s too late: That movie
that everybody’s seeing is no longer anywhere to be seen. Instead of waiting
for the DVD, place the movie’s title on your WishList, and forget about it.
WishLists work continuously in the background, scouring upcoming show
listings and pouncing at the right moments.
When that must-see movie finally flies through the airwaves (or cable, or
satellite), TiVo will serve it up on your Now Playing list.
Making WishLists work for you
Creating WishLists is a little like buying stock. You place a few good bets and
then sit back to see what pays off. The more patient you are, the better your
chances of success.
Drop by your WishList area once a week or so to check up on your portfolio.
Choose View Upcoming Programs, and TiVo presents a list of what it can cap-
ture within the next 10 days or so. Select the interesting items to read more
about them; if they still sound worthwhile, push the Record button so TiVo
captures them for future viewing.
Because TiVo’s doing all the grunt work now, you can record anything. You
don’t have to fiddle with the TV Guide, set the VCR, or even be home. Take
advantage of this. Whenever you come across an interesting show from a
newspaper, magazine, Web site, friend, or at the office water-cooler, write it
on a scrap of paper. When you get home, enter the show on a TiVo WishList.
TiVo tracks it down, records it, and leaves it waiting for your return.
People with TiVo’s premium “Home Media Option” don’t need a scrap of
paper. They can schedule recordings from the Internet, as I explain in
Chapter 9.
113
Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows

Feel free to create WishLists describing upcoming events in your life: “remodel,”
travel destinations, or upcoming holidays. If that hot new date seems interested
in a certain subject, add it to your WishList, finding shows for conversation
fodder.
Browsing TiVolution Magazine for shows
TiVolution Magazine, found in TiVo Central’s Showcases & TV Guide area,
sorts many shows into convenient categories. Each Monday, TiVolution pre-
sents its latest results, highlighting upcoming new shows for quick, one-
button recording.
1. Choose Showcases & TV Guide from TiVo Central.
A box-like grid appears, displaying several flashy items, most of them
ads or paid promos for upcoming shows. Feel free to ignore them, of
course, and head straight for “TiVolution magazine.”
Press the Left or Right Arrow to navigate the grid of boxes; press the Up
and Down Arrow to see boxes that may be hidden below or above your
current view.
2. Select TiVolution magazine.
The magazine, shown in Figure 6-11, contains an assortment of show list-
ings sorted into tidy categories:

Part II: Using the TiVo 

Movie Marquee: My favorite by far, this lists a large assortment of
movies, complete with “star” ratings, for just about every category:
Favorite Genres, Award Winners, Top 20 Actors, Top 10 Directors,
Classics, and B-Movie Theater. Like most TV fare, most movies are
at least a year old, some up to 60 years.
Best Bests: This offers a sampler from many categories, usually
movies that created or still create a buzz.
Opening Night: These shows are airing for the first time. New
shows often appear here first, the majority at the start of a new TV
season.
Special Delivery: Documentaries and seasonal specials often show
up here.
Reality Check: TV reality show fans find the latest crop here.
Kids’ Stuff: Two separate categories cater to pre-schoolers and
older children.
3. Highlight a show’s name and select Record this Show to grab it.
TiVo quickly sends you to the Recording Options area, just as with a
Season Pass or WishList, and then nestles the newly scheduled record-
ing into its To Do list.
 Film buffs should visit TiVo’s Movie Marquee every week or so. (I drop
by the Classics section to browse for movies that are well-aged yet well-
preserved.)
 Occasionally TiVolution will list a show, but say there are no upcoming
showings or it’s on a channel you don’t receive. This happens if the
show ran a few days before you visited TiVolution or if it’s airing on a
channel you don’t receive. (Hey, at least you know what you’re missing.)
Feel free to add that show to your WishList to catch future showings.
Watching Recorded TV with TiVo
After TiVo automatically gathers and records your favorite shows and sub-
jects, it lines them up in plain view, ready for you to watch. That list of shows
appears on TiVo’s Now Playing list.
This section describes how to watch TiVo’s recorded shows. It explains the
Now Playing list’s hidden details, how to fast-forward through commercials,
how to save shows to a VCR tape (if you choose), and other TiVo tricks and
tips at your disposal.
115
Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows

TiVo’s Now Playing list
Press the TiVo button twice to jump to TiVo’s Now Playing list and see your
list of recorded shows, shown in Figure 6-12. TiVo normally lists the shows by
recording date, with fresh shows at the list’s top and the oldest near the
bottom. At the very bottom sit TiVo’s Suggestions — shows TiVo guesses
you’ll enjoy based on past viewing habits.
To see any show’s description, highlight it with the Arrow button and press
Select. The show’s description appears, as shown in Figure 6-13.
To see even more information about the show than revealed in Figure 6-13,
press Enter. TiVo shows every detail it knows about the show, as shown in
Figure 6-14. (Press the Chan Up/Down button to see details that won’t fit on one
screen.) Pressing Select brings you back to the show’s shorter description.
To play a show, highlight its name and push the remote’s Play button. Or, if
you’re viewing the show’s description in Figure 6-13, highlight Play and press
Select. TiVo begins playing the show.

Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows

Choosing Keep Until lets you adjust how long TiVo saves the show: until you
delete, until a specific day, or until TiVo needs space for incoming shows.
The Now Playing list normally lists shows in the order TiVo recorded them.
For different views, press Enter to see them displayed alphabetically or in
groups: all of your “Friends” episodes appearing under a single listing for
“Friends,” for example. (This comes in especially handy for TiVos with large
hard drives.)
Understanding the Now Playing list’s green,
yellow, and exclamation point icons
Notice the icons to the left of some shows on the Now Playing list in Figure
6-12? The icon’s shape and color helps you identify TiVo’s deletion plans,
should upcoming shows require the space.
You can change a show’s deletion rank by selecting it from the Now Playing
list and changing the Keep Until option.
Here’s the rundown:
No icon: This show is less than a day old. TiVo won’t touch it.
Green icon: This program will be saved until you personally delete it, no
matter how long it hangs around.
Yellow icon: In less than one day, TiVo might delete this program to make
room for other shows you’ve requested — but only if it needs the space.
Yellow with exclamation point: TiVo has flagged this show for deletion, but
only if TiVo needs the space. The key word is if TiVo needs the space. TiVo
only requires space after it has deleted all its Suggested items, and if you’ve
requested more recordings than TiVo has room for. When faced with that sit-
uation, TiVo deletes your oldest shows to make room for the new.
Red: This show is currently being recorded. (You can still watch it, though,
either from the beginning or live.)
TiVo: TiVo recorded this Suggestion in case you might be interested. If TiVo
needs space for your programs, it deletes these first.
118
Part II: Using the TiVo 

It’s not uncommon for shows to hang around for weeks — or months —
depending on how often you record new shows and how quickly you watch
new shows (and whether you delete them after you’ve watched them). But if
you definitely want to save a show, choose the “Save Until I Delete” option.
Using the Status Bar in recorded shows
Chapter 5 explains TiVo’s Status Bar — that green bar running across the
screen’s bottom — and how it shows your current viewing position when
watching live TV. The Status bar works the same way when watching
recorded TV, but with a few key differences.
When you watch a recorded show, for instance, the Status Bar represents the
show’s entire length, from beginning to end. (When seen during live TV, by
contrast, the Status Bar simply represents a one-hour time block.)
As with live TV, pressing Play or Pause brings up the Status Bar, shown in
Figure 6-15. A glance at the Status Bar shows how much of the show you’ve
watched and how much is left. (This comes in particularly handy during
three-hour movies.)
Figure 6-15:
The green
Status Bar
places a

perspective

location

show.
119
Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows

In Figure 6-15, the numbers straddling the Status Bar reveal you’re viewing a
31-minute show. The number seven above the little white bar means you’re
seven minutes into the show.
 Press Play to see the Status Bar; press Play again to clear it.
 The little triangle in Figure 6-15 means that the show’s currently playing.
A currently paused show replaces the triangle with two little white paral-
lel lines, just like the ones on the Pause key. Each press of the Fast-
Forward or Rewind key adds another triangle and increases the speed.
(The triangles always point in the direction you’re moving.)
 To jump ahead 15 minutes, press the Advance button. (You’ll see little
“ticks” that mark every 15 minutes on the show.) Pressing the Advance
button four times, for instance, jumps ahead one hour.
Saving recorded shows to a VCR
If you connected your VCR and TiVo in Chapter 3, TiVo’s happy to send over
shows to create videotapes. Surprisingly few TiVo owners still touch their
VCRs once TiVo enters the home, but if you’re still a VCR user, here’s what
to do:
1. Select your show from the Now Playing menu.
2. Choose Save to VCR from TiVo’s list of options.
3. Turn on your VCR, and put in a tape.
4. Choose Start Saving from the Beginning on the TiVo.
To only record part of a show, stop watching TiVo’s recording just before
the part you want to record. That places another option on this menu,
Save from the Paused Location. Select that option, instead.
5. Quickly press the VCR’s Record button.
TiVo begins playing its recorded show, sending it to the VCR, which
records it onto tape. Just before playing an entire show, TiVo tacks on a
nice informational screen, as shown in Figure 6-16. (Partial recordings
don’t get the info screen.)
120
Part II: Using the TiVo 

 No, TiVo won’t edit out the commercials from your recording. But if you
stand next to your VCR, hitting its Pause button with your thumb at the
right times, you can edit them out manually.
 To cancel a recording, press the TiVo button, and select Cancel this
Recording at the next menu.
 Own a DVD recorder? Connect it just as if it were a VCR and use Save to
VCR to record your show. TiVo doesn’t know the difference, and you can
record the show to DVD instead of videotape.
 Owners of Sony TiVos and Sony VCRs receive special, automated treat-
ment: Attach an IR blaster between the Sony TiVo’s i-Link port (IR jack)
and the Sony VCR’s infrared receiver. When you choose the Save to VCR
option in Step 2, the Sony TiVo automatically turns on your Sony VCR,
records the show to tape, and conveniently turns off the VCR when
done. Sony ecstasy!

121
Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows

TiVo’s Suggestions and Your Thumbs 
Up and Thumbs Down Buttons
Because TiVo never stops recording live TV, it temporarily fills empty space
with shows, called Suggestions, that it thinks you may enjoy. TiVo’s
Suggestions don’t rob you of any storage space; TiVo mercilessly deletes
them when your own incoming shows need room.
How does TiVo know what to suggest? Partially through your remote’s
Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down keys. When you see a show you enjoy, either
live or recorded, press your Thumbs Up button. Press it twice if you really
loved it. (You can’t press it more than three times.) TiVo automatically grants
a single Thumbs Up to every show you record.
Hated something? Press the Thumbs Down button accordingly.
Even users who don’t watch TiVo’s Suggestions enjoy them as a gauge of
“free space.” Plenty of Suggestions means TiVo has plenty of free space. Don’t
see any Suggestions? That means TiVo’s running low on space and may need
to delete one of your oldest shows to make room for your next recording.
 To turn off TiVo’s Suggestions, select Messages and Setup from TiVo
Central. Head to Settings and then Preferences. Finally, choose TiVo
Suggestions.
 A show’s Thumbs rating appears next to the show’s title on description
screens.
 TiVo normally doesn’t begin recording Suggestions until you’ve ignored
it for 30 minutes. (You left TiVo sitting at a menu for half an hour, for
instance.) That’s when it enters “Standby” mode.
 If you delete a recorded Suggestion without watching it, TiVo usually
takes the hint and is less likely to record it in the future.
 In general, one Thumbs Up means you liked that particular show. Two
Thumbs Up means you liked that show and other shows like it. Three
thumbs up means you loved that show, all the actors, the type of show,
the director, your date, and the bottle of wine you shared.
 Stay away from the three Thumbs Down unless you really mean it. If
overused, it can kill off not only that single show, but all its actors, and
any shows like it. (Don’t use it on a really awful “Seinfeld” episode, for
instance, if you normally love the series.)

Recorded TV Remote Shortcuts
Here are the most common things you’ll do with the remote when watching
recorded TV. Some tricks involve pressing a single button several times or
pressing several buttons in sequence.
Press Info (called Display on DirecTV TiVos) to see the full-sized Channel
Banner; press again to remove. When the banner isn’t visible, press the Right
Arrow to bring up the banner in your favorite size; press the Left Arrow to
remove it.
Pressing the Right Arrow while the banner is displayed presents a small,
medium, and large version of the banner. Press the Left Arrow at the size you
prefer.
Remove any TiVo menus from the screen so you can see what you’re trying to
watch. (Works great when examining paused scenes in detail.)
Press when watching lists of show descriptions to jump from one description
to the next.
Jump to the show’s end or, for long shows, jump ahead 15 minutes.
123
Chapter 6: Recording and Watching Favorite Shows
When does TiVo record Suggestions?
TiVo often records Suggestions in the back-
ground while you watch a recorded show. Or,
after you’ve watched live TV for a long time
without pressing the remote, TiVo assumes you
may have wandered off. If so, it asks permission
to change the channel and record a Suggestion.
No reply? Then TiVo changes the channel to
record the Suggestion.
DirecTV TiVos, unlike Standalone TiVos, come
with two built-in tuners. The extra tuner lets TiVo
record Suggestions in the background, so it
doesn’t ask permission to change channels
except under one condition: If you’ve used
“Trick Play” functions on your DirecTV’s back-
ground tuner recently, TiVo asks permission to
change channels on the background tuner.
Although TiVo tries to sneak in a Suggestion or
two when it can, it never forces you to wait until
it’s finished recording one. For instance, if you
switch to live TV while TiVo happens to be
recording a Suggestion, TiVo immediately stops
recording the Suggestion, erases the remnant
from your hard drive, and lets you watch live TV.
(You’ll probably never notice all this taking place
in the background.

Pause the action.
Jump back 8 seconds and begin playing again.
Fast-forward more quickly with each key press. When pressed while the
screen is paused or in slow motion, TiVo moves forward, frame by frame.
Rewind more quickly with each key press. When pressed while the screen is
paused or in slow motion, TiVo moves backward, frame by frame.
Some people swear by this “bonus” tip; others quickly outgrow its novelty.
Pressing the following sequence of remote keys transforms the Advance
button into a 30-second “skip ahead” button to jump past commercials:
Press Select, Play, Select, 3, 0, Select while watching a recorded show. Your
Advance button should now skip ahead 30 seconds with each press. Repeat
the sequence to bring back your old Advance button.

t’s fun to ask children what they want to be when they grow up, but it
rarely predicts their future. Today’s budding veterinarians could just as
well grow into happy podiatrists, typographers, thermodynamics engineers,
or any other of the thousands of careers they’ve yet to explore.
Similarly, when TiVo’s Guided Setup quizzes new users about their viewing
habits and patterns, the TiVo novices don’t grasp TiVo’s subtleties until
they’ve gained a bit of experience, pushing buttons and navigating real-world
menus. Only then do new TiVo owners grasp the full picture.
Once you’ve matured as a TiVo user, this chapter explains how to fine-tune
your TiVo to your lifestyle. A quick adjustment in its Settings and Preferences
area turns off the remote’s annoying beeps, for instance. (Or turns them back
on, for those few who miss them.)
This chapter also explains how to add channels to your Favorites list, block
inappropriate programs and channels from certain family members, and
perform other adjustments that mold TiVo to your needs.

Finding TiVo’s Settings and 
Preferences Menu
Friendly electronic gadgets stash their buttons behind convenient flip-down
panels along the front. Find the panel, push the right button, and you’re
through. More insidious gadgets hide their buttons in the back, where they
can’t be reached without the help of long arms, mirrors, and bits of foul 
language.
Although TiVo hides its cables along the back, its settings live conveniently
on its opening menu, TiVo Central. From there, it’s fairly easy to tweak a set-
ting or two.
To access TiVo’s settings area, choose TiVo Messages & Setup from TiVo
Central. Then choose the Settings area.
In this chapter, I explain the adjustments TiVo allows, how to change them,
and how they each affect your TiVo’s personality.
Turning Off the Remote’s Beeps
Some people wish TiVo would contain its excitement at being unpackaged
from its box. Specifically, the little guy beeps loudly in delight every time you
press a key on your remote. It also beeps to get your attention, like when it
asks if you’d like to delete a show after watching a recorded show. Here’s how
to quiet him down to a more comfortable level or shut him up completely.
1. From TiVo Central, choose TiVo Messages & Setup.
Call up TiVo Central any time by pressing the TiVo button.
2. Choose Settings and then Preferences.
3. Choose Audio Options.
4. Choose Sound Effects Volume.
5. Select Off, or choose a lower volume level.
As shown in Figure 7-1, TiVo allows four different volume levels: Off, Low,
Medium, and Loud. To merely muffle TiVo, try some of the lower volumes
before stuffing the sock in his mouth with the Off option.

Chapter 7: Fine-Tuning Your TiVo
Turning on TiVo’s Secondary Audio Program
TiVo, like most stereo TVs and VCRs manufac-
tured after 1995, supports Secondary Audio
Programming, known as SAP. SAP lets broad-
casters transmit two soundtracks for one show.
A station could simultaneously broadcast a
Spanish translation along with their English
newscast, for instance, letting users turn on
SAP to hear the Spanish translation.
Other stations help visually impaired users by
using SAP to broadcast verbal descriptions of a
show’s onscreen action.
To hear a show’s SAP in TiVo, follow Steps 1
through 3 in the “Turning Off the Remote’s
Beeps” section; then select TiVo’s “Secondary
Audio Program (SAP), if available” option. (The
SAP takes effect the next time you change a
channel.) TiVo will subsequently play back the
currently viewed show’s SAP — if an SAP is
available.
Unfortunately, some cable or satellite boxes
filter out SAP unless told otherwise, usually by
pressing some buttons on the box’s remote. If
you’ve turned on TiVo’s SAP — and you know
that a show has a SAP — check with your cable
or satellite company to see how to activate their
box’s SAP option.
SAP isn’t included with every TV show, but it’s
slowly become more popular.
Finally, if your TiVo suddenly stops sending
sound, check to make sure you haven’t acci-
dentally turned on SAP. If you turn on SAP to
hear a show that doesn’t broadcast in SAP, you
won’t hear anything.

Weeding Out Unwanted Channels 
and Adding the Favorites
Ever spotted a fantastic movie listed on TiVo’s Guide, but then discovered
you don’t receive that channel? Or have you changed channels and stumbled
upon a channel transmitting in a language you don’t understand?
By removing those unwanted channels from TiVo’s lineup, you can avoid
future disappointments and distractions.
1. From TiVo Central, choose TiVo Messages & Setup.
2. Choose Settings and then Preferences.
3. Choose Customized Channels.
4. Choose Channels You Receive.
TiVo lists all the channels available from your provider’s channel lineup,
as shown in Figure 7-2. TiVo assumes you watch any channels with
checkmarks.
Figure 7-2:
Press Select
on a
highlighted
channel to
toggle its
“received”
checkmark.
128
Part II: Using the TiVo 

5. Locate the unwanted channel.
If you remember the channel’s number, enter it with the remote; TiVo
jumps directly to the channel. Otherwise, push the Channel Down
button to scroll down the list of channels, page by page. You’ll probably
recognize the channel’s call letters or description.
6. Press Select on the highlighted channel.
That removes the channel’s checkmark, effectively wiping it from TiVo’s
consciousness (and its menus).
Done? Press either your Left or Right Arrow key to save your options
and move on.
7. Make sure your Favorite channels are current.
While you’re at the menu, check to make sure TiVo’s Favorites list is up
to date. Favorites, quite simply, are the handful of channels you find
yourself watching repeatedly, usually because they carry a favorite show
or two.
To view your current set of Favorites — and change them, if needed —
choose Favorite Channels in Step 4. Place a checkmark by every channel
to include on TiVo’s Favorites list. (Reducing the list to a dozen or so
keeps it manageable.)
 Whenever TiVo presents a long list of channels, check the menu for an
option called “Favorites.” Choosing that option whittles the list from all
channels to your smaller, Favorites list. Over time, you’ll add new
Favorites or remove ones that let you down.
 If your TV provider’s anything like mine, they’ll constantly add, remove,
or change channel numbers. TiVo notifies you of these changes with a
message, described later in this chapter, and it tracks these changes
automatically. Still, it’s a good idea to visit here and make sure your
channels and Favorites are up-to-date.
 TiVo occasionally lists channels you don’t receive in its TiVolution
Magazine area. There’s no way to remove those, unfortunately.
Reading TiVo’s Messages
TiVo occasionally needs to tell you something. Your cable or satellite com-
pany may have added or deleted a channel, for instance. Or maybe TiVo
received an update that added a new feature or two.
TiVo keeps you informed by sending a message. To herald its arrival, the mes-
sage places a little “envelope” icon next to TiVo Messages & Setup on TiVo
Central, as shown in Figure 7-3.
129
Chapter 7: Fine-Tuning Your TiVo

Follow these steps to read the message and delete it, if you want:
1. From the TiVo Central menu, select Read New TiVo Messages & Setup.
2. Choose Read New TiVo Messages.
3. Read TiVo’s latest message.
TiVo’s latest message sits atop the list. Press Select to read it; you may
need to press the Down Arrow several times to read all of the long ones.
 TiVo’s messages rarely require any action on your part. Simply read
them, nod your head and, if you’re confident that you understand them,
delete them.
 I never delete old messages, preferring to let them pile up. That leaves
me a “log” of TiVo’s activities, which might prove handy during a call to
Tech Support.
 If TiVo mentions that your provider has changed your channel lineup,
feel free to make sure your Currently Received Channels and your
Favorites are up to date, as described in the previous section.

Part II: Using the TiVo 

Changing TiVo’s Phone Number 
and Dialing Options
If you’ve moved to a new house or apartment — but still use the same TV ser-
vice provider — you may need to change TiVo’s dial-up number to make sure
it’s not a long-distance call.
Or, if your TiVo somehow does dial a long-distance number to make its calls —
often discovered from curious daily long distance phone charges on your
phone bill — you can change to a different number. Here’s how to check TiVo’s
current list of available dial-in numbers, and select a different one, if needed:
1. From TiVo Central, choose TiVo Messages & Setup.
2. Choose Settings.
3. Choose Phone & Network Setup.
TiVo displays menus letting you change phone options, make test calls,
and perform other troubleshooting tasks.
Home Media Option users also see an informational screen explaining
how TiVo currently connects with their home network, piggy-backing on
their Internet connection to make its calls.
4. Choose Edit phone or network settings.
5. Choose Phone Dialing Options.
TiVo lists your currently dialed number, as shown in Figure 7-4, as well
as any special dialing circumstances: dialing “9” to reach an outside line,
for instance, or turning off a call-waiting beep. (I explain these options in
Chapter 3.)
6. Select Set Dial-In Number.
Type your area code at the next screen (or verify that it’s correct).
7. Press Select to fetch the latest batch of phone numbers.
TiVo uses its current phone number to call TiVo’s headquarters and grab
a list of available phone numbers in your area.
131
Chapter 7: Fine-Tuning Your TiVo

8. Press the Up or Down Arrow to select a phone number.
TiVo presents a list of nearby numbers. Highlight one for TiVo to call,
and press Select to choose it. (You may need to call your phone com-
pany to see which numbers are really local.)
I explain more solutions to phone problems, including avoiding long-distance
charges, in Chapter 11. (In that same chapter, I explain how to set up TiVo
should you move to new living quarters.)
Blocking Content with Parental Controls
When television entered the house in the late 1940s, networks wouldn’t con-
sider running a show unless it was appropriate for the entire family. In
today’s world of cable and satellite programming, that’s no longer true.
TiVo provides several ways to control your TV’s content, from blocking out
individual channels to filtering individual shows based on their content. TiVo

can even require a password to watch any channel, keeping the kids at bay
until they’ve finished their last math problem.
To turn on TiVo’s Parental Controls, follow these steps:
1. From TiVo Central, choose TiVo Messages & Setup.
Call up TiVo Central any time by pressing the TiVo button.
2. Choose Settings.
3. Choose Preferences and then Parental Controls.
TiVo’s Parental Controls menu appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.
4. Select Turn on Parental Controls.
TiVo asks you to punch in a four-digit password and then immediately
asks you to punch it in again, just to make sure you’ve typed it in cor-
rectly. You’ll now need to enter that password to watch blocked channels.
Write down your four-digit password and hide it under the mattress.
(If you forget the password and lose the mattress, this section explains
the retrieval process.)

133
Chapter 7: Fine-Tuning Your TiVo

5. Adjust the Parental Control Ratings Settings, if desired.
To simply block individual channels, jump ahead to Step 6; you don’t
need this step.
This area lets you block shows based solely on their audience maturity
level, regardless of their channel. Many shows include a voluntary rat-
ings system in their show description. Table 7-1 explains the rating
system and how it sorts shows based on appropriate audience, type of
content, and (for movies) their theatrical rating.
TiVo reads each show’s rating, and chooses whether to block it based on
the settings you choose here, as shown in Figure 7-6.
TV Rating Limit: This lets you block TV programs based on their matu-
rity level. Each press of the Up Arrow blocks more types of content,
eventually blocking all shows. Each press of the Down Arrow reduces
the number of blocked shows, eventually allowing all shows.
The maturity ratings for TV, as shown in Table 7-1, are voluntary, and
they cover only content created expressly for television. 
Movie Rating Limit: Designed for theatrical releases, this blocks movies
by their theatrical ratings: G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, and AO (adults only).
Block by TV Content: TiVo can also filter shows by their type of content:
Suggestive dialogue, Language, Sexual Content, Violence, and Fantasy
Violence. TiVo lets you mix and match from any or all of these cate-
gories, using the same six ranges found in the TV Rating Limit.
Figure 7-6:

Part II: Using the TiVo 

6. Lock out specific channels, if desired.
Turn on any Channel Locks: This simple solution lets you block any or
all channels, regardless of their content.
7. Turn off Auto Relock, if desired.
After entering your password and watching a blocked show, will you
remember to turn it back on at the show’s end? TiVo’s Auto Relock helps
forgetful parents by automatically reinstating Parental Controls after
nobody’s touched the remote for four hours.
Don’t turn off the Auto Relock setting unless you can always remember
to turn the controls back on yourself.
8. Change Password, if desired.
If the kids figure out the password, head here to change it.
 To turn off Parental Controls and watch a blocked show, enter your pass-
word when TiVo asks. (TiVo’s Auto Relock, if you haven’t turned it off in
Step 7, turns the lock back on for you four hours after you put down the
remote.)
 If you stumble across a channel that you’d like to block, press Info to
bring up the large Channel Banner. Press the Down Arrow to highlight
the Parental Controls setting. Finally, press Select to jump quickly to the
Parental Controls and add the channel to your “blocked” list.
 TiVo can’t block out a specific show based solely on its title. Instead,
block out the entire channel (Step 6), or block out all shows matching
that show’s maturity rating (Step 5).
 Curious about a show’s maturity rating? Select the show from the Now
Playing list, and press Enter when the show’s description appears. The
show’s rating appears near the top of the list.
 Forgot your password already? Call TiVo’s Customer Support at (877)
367-8486, Monday through Sunday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Pacific Time. They’ll
ask for proof that you’re TiVo’s owner.
 Sometimes programs lack a rating in their show description. When TiVo
encounters an unrated movie, TiVo gives the movie the highest rating
(AO). When TiVo finds no ratings on shows that aren’t movies, it gives
them the lowest rating (TV-Y).
 A little “locked” icon next to menus and show descriptions means TiVo’s
Parental Controls are turned on. An “unlocked” icon means they’re
turned off.

Part II: Using the TiVo 

Customizing the Channel Banner Display
Although TiVo’s informational Channel Banner is helpful, it obscures most of
your TV screen for about six seconds before vanishing.
TiVo lets you reduce that lengthy delay to just a few seconds, letting you
return to the action more quickly. (People who prefer seeing the channel
banner displayed by their cable or satellite provider often want to reduce the
delay.)
1. From TiVo Central, choose TiVo Messages & Setup.
Call up TiVo Central any time by pressing the TiVo button.
2. Choose Settings.
3. Choose Preferences and then Channel Banner.
4. Choose Clear banner quickly.
To return to TiVo’s regular banner, repeat these steps by selecting
“Display banner normally” in Step 4.
You can cycle through the Channel Banner’s three sizes by pressing the Right
Arrow.
137
Chapter 7: Fine-Tuning Your TiVo
Adjusting for Daylight Savings Time
TiVo resets its internal clock every time it calls in
to grab updated show listings (usually every
day). TiVo even adjusts automatically for
Daylight Savings Time, so you don’t have to
worry about it.
However, TiVo’s Daylight Savings Time adjust-
ment is based on information you entered
during its Guided Setup, covered in Chapter 3. If
you ever move to a location that observes
Daylight Savings Time differently, change TiVo’s
Daylight Savings Time setting by re-running
TiVo’s Guided Setup, described in Chapter 11.

Changing the Default Video 
Recording Quality
When first set up, TiVo automatically chooses Best for your default recording
quality.
You’re free to change the recording quality when scheduling any new record-
ing. But if you’d prefer that TiVo always use a different default quality —
High, for instance, or Medium, to save recording space — TiVo lets you
change it.
1. From TiVo Central, choose TiVo messages and Setup.
Call up TiVo Central any time by pressing the TiVo button.
2. Choose Settings.
3. Choose Preferences and then Video Recording Quality.
TiVo displays the screen shown in Figure 7-7, showing your currently
selected default option and the approximate number of hours you’ll be
able to record at that quality.

4. Select a new default programming quality.
TiVo subsequently records all upcoming shows at that quality. (You’ll
still be able to change the quality when scheduling a recording, but TiVo
defaults to your new quality setting first.)
 TiVo always displays live TV at Best Quality, no matter what quality you
choose here. And if you press Record while watching live TV, TiVo will
always save it in Best Quality. Suggestions, however, will be recorded at
the quality you choose here.
 DirecTV TiVos always use Best recording quality because they simply
record the incoming satellite data. The data arrives in a pre-compressed
format, saving as much space as possible.
Making TiVo Stop Recording Suggestions
I like TiVo’s Suggestions — shows it records based on my viewing habits. 
I don’t watch many of them, but they let me know the amount of recording
space left on my TiVo. When I see lots of Suggestions, I know TiVo has plenty
of room for my upcoming recordings.
Plus, TiVo records Suggestions only when it has free space, and it automati-
cally deletes them to make room for any incoming shows. Finally, TiVo’s
Suggestions definitely improve over time, as it learns your viewing habits.
But if you don’t like Suggestions, here’s how to stop TiVo from recording
them:
1. From TiVo Central, choose TiVo messages and Setup.
Call up TiVo Central any time by pressing the TiVo button.
2. Choose Settings.
3. Choose Preferences and then TiVo Suggestions.
4. Select No, don’t record TiVo Suggestions.
TiVo shows the screen in Figure 7-8, and it no longer records
Suggestions.
139
Chapter 7: Fine-Tuning Your TiVo

You can still view a list of upcoming shows TiVo thinks you may enjoy,
however, by choosing the list of Suggestions from TiVo’s Pick Programs
to Record menu. Feel free to record individual shows, if you want. But
TiVo will no longer record all of the listed shows automatically.

You may not have spotted the scoundrels yet, but the entertainment,
broadcast, and computer industries are battling over your TV — over
your entire entertainment center, for that matter.
Computers started the feud by strolling onto TV’s turf. Today’s PCs store
music, digital photos, and even movies. Unfortunately, all those things look
dreadful on a PC. They’re made for big TVs, loud stereos, and comfortable
couches.
When the computer and entertainment center eventually merge, who will
have control? Will an ugly PC sit next to your TV and stereo, feeding them
digital pictures and music? Or will your TV and stereo become more like com-
puters, storing your digital photos and managing your collection of music
files?
Instead of joining the battle, TiVo offers its Home Media Option as a mediator,
shuffling your songs and digital photos from your computer to your TV and
stereo. In this chapter, I show how to introduce the Home Media Option to
the warring parties and make peace between them.

144
Part III: The Home Media Option 
Understanding the Home Media Option
TiVo doesn’t come with the Home Media Option (HMO) built-in. Considered a
premium option, HMO costs an additional $99. Soon after you’ve paid, TiVo
headquarters shoots the HMO update software into your TiVo during its next
phone call. You complete the process by downloading and installing some
TiVo-supplied software onto your PC.
Finally, you link your TiVo to your PC, either through a cable or inexpensive
“wireless” technology. When the two begin talking, HMO teaches TiVo four
new tricks:
Digital Music: TiVo lists your computer’s music files onscreen, letting you
play any or all of them. TiVo plays MP3 files — the same type of music people
download from the Internet — as well as playlists: music arranged in a certain
playing order. TiVo can even play some Internet radio stations, as I describe
in Chapter 10.
Digital Photos: Elbow jostling in front of the computer monitor is no longer
required when displaying family photos; the HMO option allows TiVo to dis-
play .JPG photos, the format supported by nearly all digital cameras.
Remote Scheduling: Ever wished you could phone your TiVo from work and
tell it to record a particular show? HMO lets you log onto the Internet and
schedule recordings up to two hours before they air. (Perhaps we’ve been
lucky, but our TiVo schedules them just 15 minutes after we’ve sent the
request.)
Multi-room Viewing: A perk for two-TiVo households, this lets you shuffle
shows from one TiVo to the other on the same network. You must be the reg-
istered owner of each TiVo, ruling out sharing shows with a friend’s or room-
mate’s TiVo.
Tech talk about HMO
TiVo’s Home Media Option supports music files
stored in the MP3 format alone, as well as
playlists stored in M3U, PLS, and ASX formats.
TiVo will play an individual song, an entire folder
of music, and even “nested folders,” for people
who want to hear the contents of a folder and
every folder inside it.
TiVo understands Windows shortcuts, as well
as MP3 tag information, displaying the song’s
title, artist, album, duration, year, and genre. By
reading MP3 tag information, TiVo can list songs
either alphabetically or by type of music. TiVo
also plays most Internet radio stations when
their broadcast address is saved in M3U playlist
format.
TiVo’s Digital Photos feature displays .JPG, .GIF,
.BMP, .DIB, and .PNG file formats, and it plays
slideshows of both folders and nested folders.

Although it is ecstasy for computer nuts, TiVo’s Home Media Option (HMO)
places a few demands on the rest of us. Here’s what HMO requires to bring its
four features into your home:
1. Money: At the time of this writing, TiVo’s HMO costs an additional $99.
Own a second TiVo? HMO costs only $49 for the second one. (And $49
for your third TiVo, and fourth, and so on.) HMO comes only as a four-
feature package; you can’t pick and choose among its features for a
reduced price.
2. Series 2 TiVo with subscription: HMO works exclusively on Series 2
TiVos — and only once you’ve activated their TiVo subscription. It won’t
run on the older, Series 1 TiVos. (Chapter 2 explains TiVo’s different
models and their various disguises.) At the time of this writing, DirecTV
TiVos did not offer any portion of the Home Media Option.
3. Internet connection: HMO works best with broadband, the generic term
for speedy, “always on” Internet connections found with cable or DSL
connections. Dial-up connections still work, but add lengthy delays to
recording requests sent through the Internet.
4. PC or Macintosh: Both PCs and Macs can run TiVo’s software, “TiVo
Desktop,” to send music or photos to a TiVo. The computer needn’t be a
powerhouse, thank goodness; most of today’s models meet the following
requirements:
• PC: PCs need Microsoft Windows 98, ME, 2000, or XP; a 233 MHz
Pentium II processor or better; at least 64 MB of RAM; and at least
24MB of free disk space.
• Macintosh: Macs need OS X v10.2 or later; a 400 MHz G3 processor
or better; and at least 256MB RAM. They also need iTunes 3 or
later for music and iPhoto 2 for photos.
It displays up to 12 photo thumbnails onscreen;
select a picture’s thumbnail to view, rotate, or
include it in a slideshow.
All your songs and photos remain stored on your
computer; they don’t consume any space on TiVo
or limit your amount of television recordings.
TiVo can’t combine your music with your
slideshows, but that’s excusable, considering
that TiVo’s constantly scheduling and recording
your TV shows in the background. (If you still
own any CDs, slip one into your stereo to supply
the music.)

5. Network: This simply means a way to connect several computers — or
perhaps just TiVo and one computer — so they can share information.
You can connect them with wires if they’re nearby or connect them wire-
lessly if they’re in separate rooms. (You can even network two TiVos
without having a PC in the house.) Networking can be a tad technical, as
you’ll discover in the rest of this chapter.
6. Network Adapter: Just as telephones need phone jacks to make calls,
everything on a network, including TiVo, needs a “network adapter” to
plug into the network.
If your computer’s already hooked up to a wireless network, plugging a wire-
less network adapter into your TiVo might be all you need to bring it into the
loop.
Although HMO comes as a package of four separate features, not all features
require an Internet connection, PC, computer network, or network adapter.

Chapter 8: Setting Up the Home Media Option
Setting Up a Home Network 
and Connecting TiVo
Before opening the wallet for the Home Media Option, set up and test your
network to make sure TiVo embraces your PC and its Internet connection.
There’s no sense paying for HMO if TiVo snubs your computer for some odd
reason.
Connecting TiVo to your home network rewards you with a bonus, even if
you don’t want HMO: Once networked with a broadband Internet connection,
TiVo no longer uses your phone line. TiVo piggybacks on your computer’s
broadband connection, downloading show schedules much more quickly.
Networks aren’t always difficult to set up, especially with Windows XP or a Mac.
TiVo will connect with your computers using wire, wireless, or a combination of
both. In the rest of this section, I guide you through setting up a network that
includes TiVo. I help you choose the right networking method that lets every-
thing share messages (and the Internet) with a little gadget called a router.
To wire or not to wire: Choosing 
between a wired or wireless network
A simple way to choose between wired or wireless networks is to look at the
distance between your TiVo and your computer. Wired networks work best
for connecting equipment in the same room. Perks of wired networks include
their ability to send information quickly, reliability, immunity to interference,
and they’re the easiest to set up.
The hard part is stringing those darn cables, especially between two rooms.
In the crawlspace? Tucked along the carpet edge? Through the central vacu-
uming tubing? Dropping a network wire into a basement? It’s all been tried.
The people who gave up moved to wireless, instead.
The big benefit for wireless networks is that they are invisible. Plug in the
wireless adapters, turn everything on, and the chatter begins, sometimes
reaching several hundred feet. 
Drawbacks? If one wireless adapter’s placed too far away from the others, it
acts like a car radio traveling between stations, barely picking up a signal.

148
Part III: The Home Media Option 
Because wireless networks share radio space with some cordless phones,
they’re sometimes susceptible to interference. Walls, floors, and ceilings slow
down the signal, too. Still, nobody has ever tripped over a radio wave; sheer
distance sometimes makes wireless the only realistic option.
Gauge distances between all the components, weigh in the time you’d spend
stringing wires, and choose accordingly.
Buying and installing the right 
network adapters
Once you’ve decided between wired or wireless, buy the matching adapter at
your local electronics store. TiVo’s extremely conscious of the adapter’s
brand, model, and version number, so head to www.tivo.com/adapters for
its latest list of approved wired and wireless adapters. Be sure to note the
adapter’s specific version number because TiVo doesn’t work with all ver-
sions. (I bought our TiVo’s wireless adapter, the Linksys WUSB11 ver. 2.6,
seen in Figure 8-1, through Amazon.)

149
Chapter 8: Setting Up the Home Media Option
TiVo’s adapters are easy to install. Just push the adapter’s plug into one of
TiVo’s USB ports around back. (Leave TiVo turned on.) Keep your wireless
adapter’s antenna or cable visible; you’ll be pushing it around to get a
stronger signal, just as early TV owners tweaked the TV’s rabbit ears to get a
better picture.
Unlike TiVo, PCs usually embrace the cheapest adapter available. They’ll use
a USB wired or wireless adapter, just like TiVo, or a cheaper, under-the-hood
“PCI card” model. If you buy the PCI card to save money, you’ll save enough
to buy my other book, Upgrading and Fixing PCs For Dummies, 6th Edition,
from Wiley Publishing, Inc., which explains networking in much more detail.
Mac owners will discover TiVo works fine with Apple Airport wireless
equipment.
At the time of this writing, TiVo supports only 802.11b wireless adapters, not
the 802.11g (Wireless G) or 802.11a adapters. This technology changes
rapidly, so be sure to check TiVo’s Web site (www.tivo.com/adapters)
before buying an adapter.
Connecting two TiVos without a computer network
If you simply want to transfer recorded shows
between two TiVos, you don’t need a fancy
home network or a computer; just buy HMO and
a network adapter for each TiVo. Here’s how to
connect the two TiVos so they can share shows,
either wired or wireless:
Wired: Plug an approved USB wired network
adapter into each TiVo’s USB port. Next, con-
nect a special “crossover Ethernet cable”
between the two adapters. (Make sure you
emphasize the word crossover or crossover
patch cable at the computer store; a regular
network cable won’t work. Crossover cables
are often yellow.) The two TiVos should recog-
nize each other.
Wireless: Plug an approved wireless USB net-
work adapter, like the one shown in Figure 8-1,
into each TiVo’s USB port. Later, when setting up
each TiVo’s network settings, choose “Peer to
Peer” and choose the same network name and
channel for each TiVo. When both TiVos pick up
the HMO update through the phone lines, you’ll
be ready to swap TV shows.
Just connecting two TiVos rules out music and
slideshows, but it allows swapping and remote
scheduling (when given about 24-hours notice).
If you don’t have a computer or Internet con-
nection, this might be all you need.

150
Part III: The Home Media Option 
Placing a router at the network’s center
At this point, you’ve added network adapters to TiVo and your computer (or
computers). Now, you need something that lets them all share messages and
your Internet connection.
Divvying up your Internet connection and routing everything to the right
place requires a router, naturally. And if you’re setting up your first broad-
band network, there’s no question: Buy a wireless router with a built-in
switch, similar to the one shown in Figure 8-2. (Note the cool antennas.) Then
plug in everything, as I describe in this section. (If you already own a router,
jump ahead to the next section.)
Courtesy of Linksys.
Buy a wireless router even if you’re using a wired network; you may want to
add a wireless gadget later, like a second computer or laptop. To safeguard
your network’s security, turn off the router’s wireless feature until you need it.
Routers are advertised by their number of “ports.” Buy a model containing
enough ports to plug in everything on your network. My router has four
ports, for instance, allowing four wired connections in addition to the wire-
less ones.
Figure 8-2:

151
Chapter 8: Setting Up the Home Media Option
Already own a router, but don’t have a spare port for your TiVo? Your solution
is to buy a “switch” with four or eight ports. Connect the switch’s “uplink”
port to any port on your router. Then plug the TiVo into one of the switch’s
ports.
1. Connect your broadband modem to the wireless router.
Examine the router’s lineup of numbered network jacks for connecting
wired equipment. You’ll spot one jack off to one side, usually labeled WAN.
Unplug your modem’s network cable from your computer’s network
adapter, and plug it into the router’s WAN jack. (Cable modem owners
usually have to call their ISP and tell them the newly installed router’s
“MAC address.” Another solution that’s trickier requires using your
router’s “clone MAC” feature to “clone” the MAC address of your PC.
Check your router’s manual for model-specific directions.)
2. Connect any wired adapters to the router.
Using wired network adapters? Run a cable from every adapter to one of
the router’s numbered ports.
3. Run the router’s setup software on your computer.
As you run the router’s software on your computer, you’ll choose a
“name” for your network. As you enter its Wired Equivalent Privacy
(WEP) area, be sure to make up your own password.
Don’t use the standard password that came with the router. Be sure to
make up your own password. Otherwise, strangers can break into your
computer network. For extra safety, change your wireless network’s
“name” (its “SSID”) to something that only you will know.
As you set up the router, write down these three important things:
• Your wireless network’s “name” (also called SSID) and your
encryption password. You should have made up your own SSID
and encryption password when setting up the router.
• Whether your password is “alphanumeric” or “hexadecimal.”
• Write down your password’s “encryption level” number (usually
either 40, 64, or 128).

152
Part III: The Home Media Option 
You must tell TiVo these three things in the next step so it can connect.
(Hide your encryption password under the mattress; you may need it
later.)
4. Run your computer’s Internet Connection software on your computers.
If you’re just adding TiVo to an existing network, ignore this step.
But if you’re setting up a network for the first time, you must tell the
computers about your new router. Run Windows XP’s “Network Setup
Wizard,” for instance, and tell it you connect to the Internet through a
“residential gateway.”
TiVo supports only 802.11b wireless adapters. Those adapters still work with
an 802.11g router, but only at 802.11b speeds; the mismatch could slow down
the rest of your 802.11g network. To avoid this, use a wired 802.11b adapter
on TiVo, and plug that into a wireless 802.11g bridge. The bridge translates
the speed difference, thrilling network engineers everywhere.
Connecting TiVo to the home network
Once you’ve plugged in the network adapters and introduced the new setup
to your computer, tell TiVo the good news so it can connect, too. This takes
two steps for wireless networks, but only one for wired, so I’ll start with
wired.
Connect a network cable between TiVo’s wired network adapter and one of
the router’s ports or a port on a switch connected to the router. You’re done.
Jump ahead to the section on setting up TiVo’s TCP/IP settings. Wireless
users encounter an extra hurdle, described in the following section.
An encrypting conversation
Most people keep encryption turned off until the
entire network talks happily with the router. Once
everything works, they return to their router’s
software and turn on the encryption, known as
the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) key.
Why bother turning on wireless security?
Because wireless signals travel about 300 feet,
most likely reaching neighboring houses.
Neighbors might accidentally or deliberately log
onto your computer and rummage through your
files.
Changing your password every month or so
keeps out all but the most dedicated snoops.

153
Chapter 8: Setting Up the Home Media Option
Telling TiVo about its wireless connection
Wireless networks, being more complicated than their wired counterparts,
require more setup work. To introduce TiVo’s wireless adapter’s antenna to
your router’s antenna, follow these steps:
1. From TiVo Central, choose TiVo Messages & Setup.
2. Select Settings, and then select Phone & Network Setup.
TiVo displays what it currently knows about your network and adapter,
as shown in Figure 8-3.
3. Select Edit phone or network settings.
4. Select Wireless Settings, read the information, and choose Continue to
next step.
TiVo reminds you that you need the three things you wrote down in the
previous section: The network’s name and password, password type,
and encryption level.
5. Select the name of the network to use.
TiVo displays the names of all the networks it detected. As shown in
Figure 8-4, TiVo found two wireless networks — mine, named Lars, and a
neighbor’s, named linksys. Be sure to select the name you chose when
setting up your router’s software, or you might connect to a neighbor’s
network by accident.
Figure 8-3:
TiVo
displays
what it
currently
knows
about your
network and
adapter.

If TiVo doesn’t list your network’s name, select Connect to a closed wire-
less network, and enter your network’s name.
6. Choose Password Format or no Password.
Hopefully, you remember the wireless WEP password you used when set-
ting up the router. TiVo needs to know your password, as well as the type
of password.
7. Enter the password, and select Done entering text.
Enter the password’s numbers and letters with TiVo’s remote. (To make
letters uppercase or lowercase, use the Thumbs Up/Down buttons.)
TiVo will say, “This network was successfully located” when you’ve
entered the same password settings as you did on your router.
If TiVo can’t find your network, don’t worry yet. Head back to your
router, and turn off its encryption. When TiVo is able to locate your net-
work, turn on the router’s encryption and return to this section, making
sure you tell TiVo the correct password.
8. Choose Accept these settings.
TiVo should immediately locate your wireless network, although it may not
work immediately until you set the TCP/IP settings, which I describe next.

Chapter 8: Setting Up the Home Media Option
Setting up TiVo’s TCP/IP settings
Although the words “TCP/IP settings” sound dreadfully complicated, they’re
really one of the easiest parts of setting up any network, either wired or wire-
less. Follow these steps for both wired and wireless networks:
1. From TiVo Central, Select TiVo Messages & Setup.
2. Select Settings, and then select Phone & Network Setup.
TiVo displays what it currently knows about your network and adapter,
as shown earlier in Figure 8-3.
3. Select Edit phone or network settings.
4. Select TCP/IP Settings.
5. Choose Obtain IP address automatically or Specify static IP address.
Nearly everybody sets up their router to assign the IP addresses auto-
matically, so choose that. If you set up yours using a static IP address for
some technical reason, then you’re technical enough to choose the
static IP address option and set up TiVo that way.
6. Enter a DHCP Client ID, if you have one.
You probably don’t have one, so move along by choosing I don’t have a
DHCP Client ID. (If your ISP required you to set one up, enter the one
you set up on your router.)
7. Make sure TiVo accepts the values.
When TiVo flashes a screen like the one shown in Figure 8-5, make sure it
says, “These settings appear to be valid.” If it doesn’t, it’s time to check
the connections. If you’re still stumped, head for the troubleshooting
section at this chapter’s end.
Telling TiVo to use your network 
instead of the phone
When you’ve completed the “Setting up a home
network and connecting TiVo” section, TiVo’s
finally connected to your computer and the
Internet. The Home Media Option should work
fine.
But as an added bonus, TiVo can now use your
broadband Internet connection to make its daily
call to fetch updated show listings, eliminating
the need for a phone line near your TV. Your
hard work earns you this treat even if you don’t
purchase the Home Media Option.
(continued)

156
Part III: The Home Media Option 
Purchasing the Home Media Option
Once you’ve set up your network and seen TiVo flash a “These settings
appear to be valid” message, described in the previous section, you know it’s
safe to buy TiVo’s Home Media Option. After your network is set up, installing
the Home Media Option is a breeze.
Figure 8-5:
TiVo tests
your
connection
and reports
the results.
To make TiVo start using the network for main-
tenance, follow these steps:
1. From TiVo Central, select TiVo Messages &
Setup.
2. Select Settings, and then select Phone &
Network Setup.
3. Choose Change connection type and select
Network.
TiVo should stop using your phone, switching to
your network, instead. There’s one more thing: 
If you ever need to repeat TiVo’s Guided Setup,
usually because you’ve moved or switched TV
providers, stop at the menu where TiVo asks for
your phone prefix and enter this:
,#401
That secret code overrides Guided Setup’s need
for a phone line, and tells it to use the Internet
instead. Press the remote’s Pause button to
enter the comma; press the Enter button to
enter a pound sign (#).
(continued)

157
Chapter 8: Setting Up the Home Media Option
1. Log onto the TiVo Web site’s “Manage My Account” area.
TiVo’s handy Manage My Account area (www.tivo.com/manage) lets
you schedule recordings, view billing history, change to a different
credit card, or, in this case, buy the Home Media Option.
If you used TiVo’s Web site to Activate your TiVo with a credit card, log
on using your same name and password. First-time visitors must create
an account.
2. Buy the Home Media Option and name your TiVo (or TiVos).
The Web site asks a few questions, asks for your credit card number,
and asks you to choose a name for your TiVo (or TiVos). You’ll use those
names when transferring shows between two or more TiVos.
After running your credit card through its computer, the Web site autho-
rizes a download of the Home Media Option software into your TiVo
during its next call.
3. Tell TiVo to download the Home Media Option.
Instead of waiting for TiVo to call, make it download the software now.
Select TiVo Messages & Setup from TiVo Central, and choose Settings.
Then select Phone & Network Setup.
Finally, choose Connect to the TiVo Service now, as shown in Figure 8-6.
TiVo connects with TiVo headquarters and automatically grabs and
installs its newly sent HMO software. If the update doesn’t immediately
take place, repeat the process an hour or two later.
Figure 8-6:

TiVo Central offers the first clue to HMO’s arrival; it sports a new “Music and
Photos” option. But when you open that new menu, you’ll only find a few
promo songs and generic photos. Where’s your stuff?
TiVo can’t see it because you haven’t visited your computer and specifically
chosen any music or photos for TiVo to display. To do that, use TiVo Desktop
software, covered in the next section.
Installing TiVo Desktop 
on Your Computer
You don’t want TiVo to automatically root around in your computer and put
all your photos and songs on display for the entire household. As a conve-
nience and security measure, you must decide what to show and then “pub-
lish” it onto the TiVo’s onscreen list.
Your publisher comes in the form of the TiVo Desktop software, free for the
download at www.tivo.com/desktop. Once downloaded and installed on a
PC or Mac, the software lets you pick and choose the folders you want “pub-
lished” and available for TiVo to use.
While you’re downloading the software from TiVo’s Web site, download the
latest copy of the Home Media Option manual, too. The manual’s stored in
Adobe PDF format, opened only with Adobe’s free Acrobat Reader, available
at www.adobe.com/reader.
Feel free to browse the manual while installing TiVo Desktop on your com-
puter. It’s full of troubleshooting tips and detailed explanations for more
advanced setups.
Once you’ve installed TiVo Desktop, you’ve finished the hard work; your net-
work’s complete. In Chapter 9, I explain how to publish your music and
photos with TiVo Desktop and play them on your TiVo.
Troubleshooting the Home Media Option
When a network’s up and running, it doesn’t require much work. But if it’s not
working yet, fixing it involves running through a series of steps to isolate and
repair the problem.
158
Part III: The Home Media Option 

Start by turning off the encryption and password on both your router and
TiVo. Passwords are designed to keep things away from people, and right
now, you’re trying to get in.
Then run through the following steps, in order. Once your network’s finally
working, turn encryption back on. (And if the encryption breaks the network,
you know you’re entering your password wrong on the TiVo.)
1. Check the wireless signal strength.
Because a wireless adapter relies on radio waves to pick up the signal,
TiVo always displays the adapter’s current signal strength. To see it,
open TiVo Central and select Messages & Setup. Choose Settings and
then Phone & Network Setup. See the strength percentage listed near
the top of Figures 8-3 and 8-6?
If TiVo doesn’t show Excellent strength, try these things:
• Slowly move the wireless adapter in different positions around the
TiVo. TiVo updates the signal strength only every few seconds, so
move slowly, stop to read the signal strength, and repeat until
you’ve found the best spot. Most wireless adapters prefer a fully
extended antenna that points straight up.
• Wireless signals don’t like walls, and they travel best when unob-
structed. Can you line up the two at the ends of a long hallway?
Can you move one closer to the other?
• If the signal simply won’t reach, buy a wireless signal booster to sit
between the TiVo and the router. The booster serves as a tele-
phone pole, keeping the signal connected.
2. Check the network adapters and cables.
Make sure you’re using an approved adapter listed on TiVo’s Web site at
www.tivo.com/adapters. If you have some leftover network cables, try
swapping them to check for bad cables.
Every network adapter comes with a secret number known as a MAC
address that it sends to everything it connects with. (Short for Media
Access Control, MAC has nothing to do with Macintosh computers.) If
TiVo can’t read its network adapter’s MAC address, then it’s not commu-
nicating with the adapter.
To see if TiVo’s reading its adapter’s MAC address, choose TiVo
Messages & Setup from TiVo Central. Select Settings, and choose Phone
& Network Setup. No MAC address listed? That means TiVo can’t recog-
nize its adapter, and you’ve found your problem.
Make sure all the network and USB cables are pushed in firmly.
159
Chapter 8: Setting Up the Home Media Option

160
Part III: The Home Media Option 
3. Restart TiVo.
TiVo’s essentially a computer; sometimes a restart cures the strangest
problems. Start at TiVo Central to restart TiVo. Select Messages & Setup,
and then choose Restart or Reset System. Choose Restart the DVR, and,
to show TiVo you mean it, press Thumbs Down three times, followed by
the Enter key.
Restarting TiVo doesn’t erase your recordings; it simply turns off TiVo
and starts it up again.
4. Examine the network’s parts, and restart them.
Is the router turned on? The computer? Make sure they’re all plugged in,
as well as any other network gadgetry. Are the lights blinking? (Blinking
lights mean they’re talking; no lights mean problems.)
Unplug the router and cable modem, wait about 30 seconds, and plug
them in again. Restart your computer, too, for good measure.
5. Check the network’s settings.
Now that you’ve ruled out the obvious things, start picking at details.
Run through TiVo’s network setup menus again. Make sure encryption’s
turned off. (Turn it back on when everything works correctly.)
6. Check the more complicated settings used by wireless.
Wireless menus ask you to create a name (SSID) for your wireless net-
work; others come set to a default name, like LINKSYS. Make sure all wire-
less equipment uses the same name, especially the router and the TiVo.
Make sure you’ve told the TiVo and router to “Obtain an IP Address
Automatically.” Don’t use a Static IP address on your network unless you
know what you’re doing.
7. Grasp at straws.
As a last resort, visit the Web sites for your router and other networking
equipment and check the version of their downloadable firmware — the
internal software that makes them work. (The router’s setup menu dis-
plays the current firmware version number.) Companies routinely post
updated firmware versions that correct small problems; the newest
firmware might fix yours.
• Visit some of the Web sites listed in Chapter 13. Many TiVo users
frequent these places, answering user questions. TiVo’s customer
support may be able to help, too.
• If you simply don’t like the Home Media Option, or can’t make it
work, TiVo will refund your money, as long as your TiVo subscrip-
tion is still good. To arrange a refund, call TiVo Customer Support
at 877-367-8486.

T
iVo’s lack of a keyboard and mouse disguises the fact
that it’s actually a computer — a close relative of the
computer in your home or ofﬁce. As you’ve no doubt
noticed on the Internet, computers love to talk to each
other. So it’s no big secret that TiVo and your computer
can talk, too.
TiVo charges admission for this family reunion, known as
the Home Media Option, a handy toolbox that connects
TiVo with its long lost relative, your computer. This part of
the book explains how to get tickets and set up the party
so nobody spills the punch.
One chapter explains how to set up a network that allows
TiVo and your computer to talk comfortably. Another
explains how TiVo can pour over your computer’s digital
photos, displaying them on the TV where all the visitors
can see them. (TiVo can access your MP3 collection of dig-
ital music ﬁles as well.)
The last chapter in this part of the book explains how to
push the Home Media Option to its limits through add-on
software designed speciﬁcally for TiVo users. If you’re a
computer nut, this part of the book will keep you going for

HMO also hands TiVo an Internet portal, letting you schedule recordings from
work, an airport’s computer lounge, or an Internet café in Istanbul. Own two
TiVos? The Home Media Option lets you send shows back and forth, effec-
tively doubling your TiVo’s storage capacity.
Whether you’re interested in digital photos, digital music, remote scheduling,
or TiVo transfers, this chapter explains how to make it all work.

Scheduling Recordings through the Web
After a few months of TiVo, you’ll rarely worry about missing shows. You tell
TiVo what you want, and TiVo automatically grabs them; case closed. But
what happens if you hear about an exciting new show when you’re away from
home? How can you tell TiVo to record something when you’re on vacation,
visiting a friend, or at work?
TiVo’s Remote Scheduling feature places your TiVo within earshot of any
Internet connection. TiVo’s Web site lets you search by show name, title,
actor, or director. When you locate your show and select it, the Web site
routes your request to your TiVo. TiVo records it — with as little as 15 min-
utes notice, if your TiVo connects through broadband.
Here’s how to make Remote Scheduling work as promised:
1. Purchase and install TiVo’s Home Media Option.
I describe purchase and installation details in Chapter 8.
2. Log on to “TiVo Central Online” at TiVo’s Web site.
When the buzz of that “can’t miss” new show vibrates your ears, head to
“TiVo Central Online” (www.tivo.com/tco). Log on using the e-mail
address/password combination you used when purchasing the Home
Media Option. (Lost them already? The nearby sidebar explains your
options.)
TiVo Central Online appears, as shown in Figure 9-1. The site already
knows a little about your TiVo — what you named it when signing up for
HMO, for instance. (Names help identify individual TiVos in two-TiVo
households.) Figure 9-1 reveals we’ve dubbed our TiVo “Upstairs.”
3. Search for and select your upcoming program.
TiVo Central Online allows the same searches as TiVo’s menus: show
title, keyword, actor, or director. Enter your search, click Go, and TiVo
Central Online scans the next seven days of listings. For instance,
Figure 9-2 shows the results for upcoming Audrey Hepburn movies.
Choose the program you’d like to record. In this case, I chose the
Saturday morning showing of “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” (My wife’s reading
the book.)
TiVo Central Online’s Browse by Channel option lets you view a day’s
listings for any channel you receive, up to seven days in advance.

4. Verify your recording time, and choose Record this episode.
When you choose a show, TiVo lists its description and first upcoming
airing, as shown in Figure 9-3. Any upcoming showings appear in a list
below the description.
Click the Record this episode button to tell TiVo to record that particu-
lar airing of the show.
Because the selected show airs in only six hours, the top of the Web site
warns, “May not record.” If my TiVo used a dial-up modem, this record-
ing request probably wouldn’t arrive in time. But because our TiVo con-
nects through a broadband connection, the request will arrive in plenty
of time. (It did.)
5. Set your recording options, and then click Schedule It.
TiVo’s Remote Schedule has one basic flaw: It doesn’t know if you’ve
already scheduled another recording for that time slot. And it won’t dis-
cover any conflicts until it talks to your TiVo.
To deal with this potential problem, the Web site asks you what it should
do, as shown in Figure 9-4:
• Only record if nothing else conflicts.
• Cancel other programs if necessary.
Requests made over the Internet usually carry a sense of urgency, so if
you absolutely must see this exciting show, choose Cancel other pro-
grams if necessary. (You can probably pick up anything cancelled, what-
ever it was, on a rerun.)
If you’re reluctant about canceling a scheduled recording, check out
any upcoming showings for that program. Send in a request for one that
airs during the wee hours, when you’re less likely to be recording
something else.

 If you have an hour or so, fix the dilemma by choosing “Send
Confirmation” to receive your TiVo’s response by e-mail. If TiVo says
there’s a conflict, you’ll know which show is at risk, letting you tailor
your next recording request. With a few e-mail exchanges, you can usu-
ally schedule what you want and minimize the damage.
 TiVo’s Web site sends requests using your TiVo’s default recording qual-
ity and options. Feel free to choose “Change” under “Other recording
options” to change the recording quality, pad the show’s start and stop
times, or change its deletion date.
 Trapped in a boring conference call? Use that wireless laptop to browse
upcoming show listings on TiVo Central Online. Your computer keyboard
flips through show listings much more quickly than “thumbing” the let-
ters with TiVo’s remote.
 TiVo Central Online knows the channels your TiVo can receive, but it
doesn’t know whether you subscribe to them all. For instance, the Web
site lists HBO even if you don’t subscribe to HBO. If you accidentally
choose a non-subscribed channel, TiVo’s e-mail confirmation exposes
your gaffe.
 With a broadband Internet connection, you can send in recordings
quickly, catching shows that air in just 15 minutes. Without broadband,
your Remote Scheduling request won’t arrive until your TiVo makes its
next phone call — up to 30 hours later.
 If you’re using a cookie manager on your Internet browser, you must
allow TiVo.com to use cookies.
Publishing Music and Photos to TiVo
TiVo Desktop software, described in Chapter 8, lets you publish — a fancy
word for list — your computer’s music and photo folders on TiVo, where
they’re as easy to reach as TV shows.
You’ll find TiVo Desktop very easy to use, either from a single computer or
from several computers on a network. Making a file accessible to TiVo is as
simple as dragging and dropping it. It works like this:
1. Open TiVo Desktop.
When installed as discussed in Chapter 8, TiVo Desktop appears as a
little TiVo icon near your clock. Double-click the icon to bring TiVo
Desktop within view.
166
Part III: The Home Media Option 

If the icon’s not in view, you’ll find TiVo Desktop on the Start menu’s All
Programs area.
2. Click the tab describing what you want to publish: Music or Photos.
TiVo Desktop separates song and photo files into their own areas, each
accessible with their own tab. To publish music, for instance, click the
Music tab, shown in Figure 9-5. (By itself, TiVo and the TiVo Desktop only
publishes MP3 files; some third-party software covered in Chapter 10
uses special tricks to overcome this limitation.)
The top of TiVo Desktop shows the music files on your computer; below,
it shows the music files currently published on TiVo. (Click the Photo
tab, and TiVo switches the view to your photo files.)
3. To publish a file or folder, drag it from TiVo Desktop’s top half to its
bottom half.
Any music or photos you drop onto TiVo Desktop’s bottom portion
appear on your TiVo’s menu. Feel free to drop individual files or entire
folders. (Dropping a folder also publishes all the folders within it.)
Figure 9-5:
Click the
Music tab to
list some

your TiVo.
167
Chapter 9: Putting TiVo’s Home Media Option to Work

Figure 9-6, for instance, shows that I’ve given TiVo access to all the
music from these folders: Phish, Robben Ford, St Germain, and the
Allman Brothers. At the list’s bottom sits one Jimi Hendrix song,
“Hey Joe.”
To publish all your music and photos in Windows XP, for instance, drag
and drop your My Music and My Pictures folders onto their respective
tab areas.
Anything you publish appears immediately on TiVo’s “Music and
Photos” menu, ready to be played or viewed.
4. To remove a single file or folder, right-click it and choose Unpublish.
To remove accidentally published material, right-click its name from the
Published list and choose Unpublish. It immediately disappears from the
published list, as well as from your TiVo.
To temporarily suspend publishing, don’t unpublish everything. Instead,
choose Pause from TiVo Desktop’s Server menu. To put everything back
in place, choose Start/Resume from the same menu.

Part III: The Home Media Option 

• Sitting at a network? TiVo Desktop lets you publish your own files,
as well as shared files on networked computers. Or, if you wish,
place a copy of TiVo Desktop on every computer on your network.
My wife’s computer publishes all our photos, for instance; I publish
our music from my computer.
• To see or hear the file you’re about to publish, double-click its
name from within TiVo Publisher. The program quickly plays your
song or displays your photo, helping you make your publishing
decision.
• If you inadvertently leave TiVo paused on a song, your computer
may not let you move or change that song or folder. To undo TiVo’s
“lock,” press the TiVo button; TiVo jumps to TiVo Central, quickly
releasing your file.
• TiVo Desktop won’t list any “hidden” files or folders on your com-
puter, effectively stopping you from publishing them. Click the
Hide attribute on a song or picture you don’t want to publish, and
TiVo still lists the other items in that folder.

Publishing songs and photos on a Macintosh
Publishing songs and photos on a Macintosh
works differently than on a PC.
1. From the Apple menu, click System
Preferences.
2. Under Other, click TiVo Desktop.
3. Click Start to begin publishing content.
4. To publish music, select Publish my music
from the Music tab.
Select Publish my entire iTunes Library to
list all your music on TiVo. Or, to publish a
few playlists, select Publish only these
playlists, selecting the playlists you want
published. (TiVo can’t list or play AAC files,
even if they’re published; TiVo handles only
MP3 files.)
5. To publish photos, select Publish my
photos from the Photos tab.
Select Publish my entire iPhoto Library to
publish your whole iPhoto library. To publish
just a few photo albums, select Publish only
these albums, and select each album you
want published.
Problems? Make sure you’ve installed iPhoto 2
and iTunes 3.0 or later. You’ll also need iTunes or
iPhoto to create or change your playlists and
albums.

Viewing Digital Photos on TiVo
Once you’ve published your music and/or photo files with TiVo Desktop, TiVo
dutifully lists them on the screen, just like your recorded TV shows. TiVo
offers several tricks when displaying photos, including customized slide-
shows. Here’s how to display your computerized shoebox of photos on your
TV screen.
1. Choose Music & Photos on TiVo Central.
A software update, received shortly after you purchased the Home
Media Option, offers the first sign that HMO has arrived: TiVo Central
sports a new “Music & Photos” item, shown in Figure 9-7.
Choose the Music & Photos menu to see everything published by TiVo
Desktop.
2. Choose your computer from the list.
TiVo lists each networked computer that offers published music or
photos. As shown in Figure 9-8, my wife’s computer, CLEMENTINE, pub-
lished some photos; my computer, XPPRO, published both music and
photos. Every month or so, the TiVo company dumps some music and
photo promos in the “TiVo Online” area.
170
Part III: The Home Media Option 
Fiddling with TiVo Desktop
Choose “TiVo Properties” from TiVo Desktop’s
Server menu for under-the-skin access to the
program’s inner workings. Several useful good-
ies await you.
 The IP address TiVo uses to access your
network — a big help when troubleshooting.
 A toggle for automatically loading TiVo
Desktop when you start your computer.
 Multi-TiVo households can keep one or sev-
eral TiVos from accessing published material.
If you’re having trouble with your network,
check TiVo’s IP address with your router logs to
monitor the connection.

Chapter 9: Putting TiVo’s Home Media Option to Work

TiVo lists your computer by its network name; your name reflects your
computer’s user name. (You can’t change the names from within TiVo or
TiVo Desktop; you must change them from your computer’s menus.)
Select a computer’s name to see the goodies it offers.
3. Navigate to the appropriate folder.
When you select a computer’s name, TiVo lists the computer’s published
files and folders. For instance, Figure 9-9 shows that Tina has published
her entire “My Pictures” folder, granting TiVo access to every folder
inside it. (Sharp-eyed readers looking along the screen’s bottom will
notice that TiVo’s currently displaying the folders by their date, rather
than in alphabetical order.)
To see a folder’s contents, select it with the remote. TiVo displays pic-
tures as thumbnails, as shown in Figure 9-10.
4. Highlight a photo and press Play to view it.
Highlighting a photo and pressing Play fills the TV screen with that
photo, as shown in Figure 9-11.
Should you find yourself viewing a photo taken sideways, press TiVo’s
Instant Replay button. TiVo quickly rotates the photo 90 degrees. Repeat
as necessary.

5. Press Play on a currently viewed picture to start a slideshow.
Pressing Play on a currently viewed picture or slideshow starts a
slideshow of that picture’s folder.
 Press Enter any time to change your slideshow options. You can control
each picture’s viewing time, as well as whether photos should repeat
endlessly, include subfolders, display alphabetically, or display at
random.
 To see different display options for a particular thumbnailed photo,
press Select instead of Play. TiVo lets you view, rotate, or start a
slideshow with that picture.
 Rotating a photo only rotates it on the TV screen; it doesn’t rotate the
original file that’s stored on your computer. In fact, your TiVo can’t
delete or change any files on your computer.
 Stuck at the top of a long list of files? Press the Jump to End (Advance)
button, and TiVo jumps straight to your vacation photo folder from
Zambia.
Playing MP3s on TiVo
Before TiVo, MP3s only rocked from your computer or your MP3 player.
Neither one boasted great sound. And neither hooked up easily with the
stereo. HMO turns TiVo into your personal jukebox, making it easy to find the
right tunes at the right times. I love finding just the right album for dinner.
TiVo sounds best, of course, when hooked up to your home stereo, covered
in Chapter 3. TiVo lets you play songs the same way you display photos.
1. Choose Music & Photos.
Select Music & Photos from TiVo Central.
2. Choose your computer from the list.
Single-computer households see only one computer; on networks,
choose the computer that published the music you want.
3. Navigate to the appropriate folder.
Push the Arrow buttons to move between folders; press Select to open
a folder. 
174
Part III: The Home Media Option 

4. Play the song or folder.
Press Play on a folder to play everything inside. Press Play on a single
song to play that song, followed by the rest of the folder’s songs.
Organizing a large MP3 or photo collection takes some work, as I discuss
in the next chapter. Hopefully you’ve kept the songs for each artist or
album in their own folder. (TiVo may tucker out if you’ve stuffed a few
thousand folders into a single folder.)
5. Press Enter for options.
While playing a song, TiVo offers the same options as with slide shows:
repeat playing the folder’s songs, shuffle the songs when playing, and
whether or not to include subfolders.
 Stuck in the middle of a drum solo? To find out when a jam session will
end, press Play. Up pops the familiar green Status Bar, pointing out the
song’s beginning, end, and your current location.
 The remote’s Volume controls the loudness; you can’t turn it up or down
from your computer.
 Stuck at the top of a long list of files? Press the Jump to End (Advance)
button, and TiVo jumps right to Zappa.
Sharing Shows between Two TiVos
Copying shows from one TiVo to another is pretty simple; the problem is the
amount of time a transfer needs. Transfers usually happen in real-time, a fancy
way of saying that a two-hour show takes two hours (or even longer) to transfer.
Luckily, you can begin watching a show on one TiVo as soon as you begin
sending it on the other.
To begin a transfer, head for the TiVo that needs to receive the show.
1. From the “receiving” TiVo, locate the show on the “sending” TiVo.
You’ll see your other TiVo’s name at the bottom of the Now Playing list.
Select that TiVo’s name to see its list of recorded shows.
2. Select the show you want to watch and choose Watch on this TV.
Spot the show you want? Select it, and choose Watch on this TV; TiVo
begins sending the show.
You can begin watching immediately, but a slow transfer may force you
to pause, waiting for more of the show to arrive before watching again. 
175
Chapter 9: Putting TiVo’s Home Media Option to Work

 Shows recorded at lower visual quality transfer more quickly than
shows recorded at the high-quality setting. Also, a wired network trans-
fers faster than wireless. (I explain in Chapter 8 how to set up both wired
and wireless networks.)
 If a TiVo’s already transferring one or more shows, it places the new
transfer request on its To Do list and sends the show when it has time.
 When transferring shows, you’re copying them, not moving them. Once
you’ve transferred the entire movie, feel free to delete the original from
the other TiVo machine, if you want.
 Never delete a show before it’s completely transferred to the other TiVo,
or you’ll cut off the end of the show.
 Sure, your friends can bring their TiVos to your place. They can even
hook them up to your network. But they can’t siphon off your latest
“Sopranos” episodes. TiVos must be registered in your name before
they’ll share. You can’t even share shows with a roommate’s TiVo.
Specifically, TiVos must both be on the same account and the same net-
work subnet to share shows.
 Feel free to rename your TiVo or TiVos by heading to Manage My
Account (www.tivo.com/manage) on TiVo’s Web site and choosing
“DVR Preferences.”

 Making playlists for special events

T
he TiVo Desktop software included with TiVo’s Home Media Option
(HMO) simply dumps your computer’s files and folders onto TiVo’s
menus, with nary a thought to organization. If you’re accustomed to “mous-
ing around” to find the digital camera photos you’ve tossed into your “My
Pictures” folder, you’ll do the same on TiVo, only while holding an awkward
remote.
The same holds true for all the music files in your MP3 collection. TiVo’s only
as organized as what your computer throws at it.
You have two options to make your files easier to retrieve from TiVo:
Organize your photo and music files yourself, sorting everything into proper
folders. Or, you can bring in the hired help by installing one of a number of
programs designed to organize your awkward bundle of information and pre-
sent it to TiVo in a thoughtful way that only requires a few thumb pokes to
access.
Some of these programs whip out music playlists to match any mood; others
publish certain sets of photos on the fly: everything shot during last
summer’s trip to Budapest, for instance.
This chapter explains both approaches. It shows how to organize your own
files, and it presents the resumes of the hired help, letting you know what to
expect, should you let them in the door.

Organizing Your Computer’s Files for TiVo
When it comes to TiVo, Apple users have it easy. Apple computers include
built-in music and photo organizers — iTunes and iPhoto. Better yet, Apple
and TiVo joined heads to integrate TiVo technology into both programs.
Apple users can publish music playlists and photo albums at the push of a
button, as seen in Figure 10-1.
Microsoft, by contrast, snubbed TiVo as a competitor to its own media-
related software offerings. Windows Media Player doesn’t integrate with TiVo,
forcing users to scramble for alternatives.
The next few sections explain how to manually organize your computer’s
music and photo files on Windows so they’re fairly easy to fetch from TiVo
and its remote. If spending the afternoon organizing computer files doesn’t
excite you, don’t bother. Just jump ahead to this chapter’s section on third-
party programs that automatically organize your information and serve it up
to TiVo.

Organizing your own music files
Just as there’s no perfect breakfast, there’s no perfect way to organize music
files. Instead of aiming for perfection, I’ll describe the method that works well
on both my computer and TiVo.
I create a new folder for every artist’s name, sorted by their entire name:
“Count Basie” warrants his own folder, for instance, not “Basie, Count.” Inside
each artist’s folder, I create a folder for each of their releases. My folder for
Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, for example, looks like Figure 10-2.

Chapter 10: Fancy Home Media Option Tricks
Grab the HMO manual!
Believe it or not, TiVo’s Home Media Option
comes with a manual — and you don’t even
have to buy HMO to take a peek at HMO’s
details. To grab the manual, head for TiVo’s
Guides area (www.tivo.com/guides) and
look for the Home Media Option Premium
Features Guide. The 70-page, indexed guide
spells out the Home Media Option features in
detail. It’s well worth the download.
The manual’s stored in Adobe Acrobat “PDF”
format. If necessary, you can download Adobe
Acrobat’s free reader at Adobe’s Web site
(www.adobe.com/acrobat).
While visiting TiVo’s Guides area, feel free to
download a copy of your TiVo’s manual. (The
electronic version comes in handy when the
paper manual disappears behind the couch.)

Create “Various” folders as needed to handle CDs where two or more artists
team up. If Bob Dylan and Britney Spears team up for a funk CD called “Jive,”
store the songs in a “Jive” folder in your “Various Funk” folder. To make the
CD easy to find, place a shortcut to the “Jive” folder in both Bob’s and
Britney’s folders.
The TiVo remote’s Play button subsequently becomes a powerful way to play
everything by an artist. Highlight Bob Dylan’s folder, for instance, press Play,
and TiVo plays every CD inside Bob Dylan’s folder. (The shortcut even tells
TiVo to play Bob and Britney’s CD.)
 I name all my song files by track number, a hyphen, and song name.
Stevie Ray Vaughan’s song “Crossfire,” for instance, appears as 02 —
Crossfire. Since TiVo plays songs in alphabetical order, pressing Play
on a CD’s folder plays the songs in the order they appeared on the CD.
(TiVo places numbers before letters when sorting alphabetically, so TiVo
starts by playing the song with the numbers “01.”)
 To place a picture of the CD’s cover on the folder, as seen in Figure 10-2,
find a picture of the cover online — Amazon (www.amazon.com) shows
covers for most releases, for instance. Right-click the picture, choose
Copy, and Paste the album cover’s image file into your folder. Finally,
rename the file with the simple name folder. Windows XP subsequently
displays that picture on the CD’s folder when in Thumbnail view.
 Even with the Home Media Option, TiVo can’t display photos while play-
ing music. So it can’t show your CD’s cover while playing that CD’s
songs, for instance.
 TiVo supports only MP3 files. People with music stored in WMA
(Windows Media Player’s preferred format) will need a third-party pro-
gram, discussed later in this chapter. (When you play the WMA file, those
programs quickly convert the file to MP3 format and feed the results to
TiVo without delay.) At the time of this writing, TiVo does not support the
AAC format offered by the Apple iTunes Music Store and iPod. 
Tagging your files
When TiVo plays a song from your computer, it displays the artist’s name,
song title, length, album, and other information, as seen in Figure 10-3. But
sometimes TiVo doesn’t display that information for every song; occasionally,
it even displays the wrong information. Why?
182
Part III: The Home Media Option 

TiVo only reads the information buried inside the music file, in a storage area
known as a “tag” or “ID3 tag.” When filled out properly, the tag lists everything
seen in Figure 10-3. Sometimes the tag contains even more information —
comments, for instance, or the song’s genre and track number.
Nothing beats a music collection with complete “tag” information. Just about
every song organizer — including TiVo — relies on accurate tags to recognize
and sort your songs.
Windows XP recognizes tags; Windows XP’s Media Player 9 even identifies
songs and fills out the tag for you automatically, if you want. Sometimes, how-
ever, even Media Player won’t fill out a tag properly. In that case, here’s a
quick way to fill out a tag manually in Windows XP.
1. Right-click the music file’s name and choose Properties.
Windows XP brings up the file’s Properties window, but doesn’t yet dis-
play the tag information.

Windows XP displays the file’s tag information, seen in Figure 10-4. (If
you don’t see the tag information, click the window’s Advanced button
to display it.)

3. Click the tag line that needs changing, and fill it out properly.
Change any lines within the Music and Description areas. You can cor-
rect or add a song’s title, for instance, or enter information about a
track, artist, genre, and several other items.
4. Click OK to save your changes and close the window.
Done? Click OK to save your changes, and repeat with other files lacking
proper ID.
 Don’t try to edit a song’s tag while TiVo’s currently playing or displaying
it. Your computer and TiVo will bicker, keeping you from editing the tag.
 You’ll occasionally want to apply the same change to many files —
giving them all the same artist’s name or genre, for instance. To do that
quickly, highlight all the files that need changes, right click one and
choose Properties. Any change you make will be applied to all the high-
lighted files.
 Windows XP Media Player 9 includes a more full-featured tag editor.
Right-click the file to change and select Advanced Tag Editor from the
menu. Media Player doesn’t stick to recognized standards, unfortu-
nately, so other tag editors probably won’t recognize the additional
information.

Part III: The Home Media Option 

 The Internet’s stuffed with hundreds of tag editing programs. ID3-TagIT
(www.id3-tagit.de) boasts plenty of power, but everybody has his
own favorite. I like MP3 Tag Tools (http://massid3lib.sourceforge.
net). Winamp (www.winamp.com) plays MP3 files, fill out tags automati-
cally, lets you edit tags yourself, and plays Internet Radio stations from
Shoutcast (www.shoutcast.com).
 MP3 tags come in several versions. The Web site “ID3v2” (www.id3.org)
contains lots of information about ID tags, their history, their use, and
ways developers can use them.
Creating your own playlists
When you want to hear certain songs in a certain order, you need a playlist —
a file listing each song’s location and order, along with enough code to keep
computers happy. When TiVo reads the playlist, it finds the songs and plays
them back the way you asked.
Windows Media Player creates playlists and can save them in the format TiVo
understands — but only when you ask it to. (It can convert old playlists to a
TiVo-compatible format, too.) Here’s how to ask the right way:
1. Open Windows Media Player and choose Media Library.
Media Player immediately displays all songs, video, and other goodies.
2. Choose New Playlist from the File menu, and create a new playlist.
When the window pops up, click on songs in the order you’d like to play
them. Double-click an artist’s name to see their CDs; double-click a CD’s
name to see its songs, as seen in Figure 10-5.
Figure 10-5:
Click a file’s
name to add
it to the
playlist;

185
Chapter 10: Fancy Home Media Option Tricks

Delete highlighted songs by clicking the red X; click either the Up or
Down Arrow to change a highlighted song’s playing order.
3. Name the playlist and click OK.
Done setting the order? Enter a name in the “Playlist Name” box and
click the OK button for Windows to save your file.
4. Save the file as an M3U playlist and publish it. 
Highlight your newly created Playlist file, choose Save As from the File
menu, and save it as an M3U Playlist (*.m3u). Media Player normally
saves files in WPL format, and makes TiVo choke and refuse to list them.
 Playlists take a little time to create, but they’re fun to whip up for parties
or special events. Be sure to store them in their own published Playlists
folder so they’re easy to grab on the fly.
 To avoid repeats, don’t store playlists in folders with songs. If you store
Neil Young’s “Harvest” playlist in the same folder as the Harvest CD’s
songs, for example, TiVo will play that CD twice — once for the folder’s
songs and again when it reaches the playlist.
 If you move any song in a playlist, edit the playlist to show the song’s
new location. When TiVo discovers a missing song in a playlist, it ignores
your faux pas, moving quickly to the next song.
 TiVo handles playlists stored in the M3U (most players), PLS (Winamp),
ASX (Microsoft), and B4S (Winamp) formats. It doesn’t like Media
Player 9’s new WPL format, unfortunately.
186
Part III: The Home Media Option 
Playing Internet radio stations on TiVo
Even for people without huge MP3 file stashes,
the Home Media Option can bring a huge vari-
ety of music into your living room through
Internet radio. The secret is simply hiding the
station’s broadcast location — its IP address
and port — within an M3U standard playlist.
It’s easy for Mac users to publish an Internet
radio station on TiVo; they simply drag the radio
station link over to a published playlist, then see
if TiVo can handle the station. Windows users
have it a little rougher. They must save the sta-
tion’s IP address in an M3U file. For example,
here’s a playlist that makes TiVo play an Internet
radio station called “Secret Agent Radio”
(www.somafm.com):
#EXTm3U
#EXTINF:,Secret Agent Radio
http://205.188.245.130:8010
To create your own Internet Radio station
playlist, replace the boldfaced words and num-
bers with your own favorite station’s name and
IP address and port. The easiest way to locate
this information for stations is with Shoutcast
(www.shoutcast.com) and the program
Winamp (www.winamp.com).

Organizing photos
Since pictures are worth a thousand words, how can anybody possibly create
a descriptive filing system? Photos are much more difficult to categorize than
music. Most feature groups of people, for instance, ruling out the “separate
folder for each person” method.
Most photos revolve around four main areas — People, Places, Events, and
Home — so I’ve created those four folders as a starting point, splitting them
into subfolders when needed. People, for instance, is divvied up between
Friends and Relatives. Home is split into Inside and Outside. Events is split up
into Holidays, Parties, Travel and Other.
Keeping photos sorted by these main categories gives me a place to begin
when searching for that long-lost photo; it usually only takes a few clicks or
remote pokes to find what I’m after.
 Many digital cameras “stamp” a digital photo’s file with information
about the camera’s settings, including date and time you took the pic-
ture. To keep that stamp accurate, be sure to set your digital camera’s
clock every time you change its battery. TiVo can sort your photos by
date taken (or alphabetically), making them much easier to find.
 When you tell TiVo to “Rotate” a photo, it doesn’t alter your original
photo on your computer. TiVo just rotates the photo on the TV screen.
Enhancing TiVo Publisher 
with Other Programs
TiVo’s Home Media Option simply connects TiVo and your computer. Several
third-party programs build on that connection, turning the most scattered
music and photo collections into organized lists on your TiVo.
187
Chapter 10: Fancy Home Media Option Tricks
To find a station’s IP broadcast address, head to
Shoutcast and begin playing it in Winamp,
Shoutcast’s recommended media player soft-
ware. Right-click the station’s name as it plays,
and choose File Info. Winamp lists the address
at the very top. Save that address as an M3U file
using the format above, publish it, and you’re
ready to listen.
One caveat: TiVo’s finicky about its broadcast
streams. Lengthy broadcast streams like
http://205.188.245.130/stream/1015
won’t work, as TiVo can’t handle the word
stream in the address. If your station broad-
casts in a different format, you might want to
consider some of the third-party Home Media
Option enhancers I cover in this chapter.

Here’s a look at software that adds extra power to TiVo Publisher, or even
replaces it altogether.
MoodLogic for TiVo
MoodLogic (www.moodlogic.com) brings two tricks to TiVo and your com-
puter: On your computer, MoodLogic cleans up and organizes a messy MP3
collection, automatically stuffing artists into their own folders, correcting ID
tags and renaming song files consistently. MoodLogic also organizes TiVo’s
menus, seen in Figure 10-6.
After MoodLogic finishes that boring maintenance work, it becomes your per-
sonal on-call disc jockey, whipping up quick playlists to match your current
mood. The company’s breezy PR banter goes like this:
“Imagine the day that you walk into your living room and say aloud ‘I want to
hear some good jazz. Something like Breezin’ by George Benson.’ As soon as
the words are out of your mouth, your stereo lights up and a smooth jazz mix
starts to play a mix based on Breezin’.”
Figure 10-6:
MoodLogic

files and

mood.
188
Part III: The Home Media Option 

MoodLogic won’t add voice recognition to TiVo, but a quick press on your
remote will indeed start up your new Breezin’ mix. Actually, MoodLogic lets
you churn out on-the-fly playlists based on nearly anything you toss at it:
romantic songs from the forties, for instance, fast ’70s dance music, aggres-
sive jazz songs, and more. To do this wonderwork, MoodLogic compares
your song collection with its computerized algorithms and spits out a quick
match for your mood.
MoodLogic cranked out some great on-the-fly mixes based on specific songs,
genres, decades, tempos, and of course, moods. I enjoyed the way it tossed in
favorites I hadn’t heard for awhile. People who constantly craft their life’s
soundtrack will love serving up on-the-fly mixes through their TiVo.
 In order to create its mood mixes, MoodLogic must become intimately
acquainted with your MP3 collection. I found its “Activation” process a
little creepy, as it spent several hours perusing my collection, comparing
my songs with its mammoth mood database.
 The program’s raw edges occasionally interrupt the mood. MoodLogic
won’t weed out duplicate files from your hard drive, for instance, and it’s
a little awkward to move the program from one computer to another.
And unlike other CD databases, MoodLogic only fills out the artist and
title, ignoring the track number.
 MoodLogic is only as strong as your MP3 collection. It can’t create
moods if you don’t have the songs. It’s not a song-sharing service; it only
creates playlists based on your existing song files.
 People with carefully filled out ID tags needn’t worry; MoodLogic won’t
change tags or names without your permission. 
 MoodLogic’s biggest downer comes from its price: currently $29 for a
year of Activation, then a yearly renewal fee. If you stop paying, the
pouting MoodLogic immediately stops talking to your TiVo.
J. River Media Center
Unlike MoodLogic, J. River Media Center (www.musicex.com/mediacenter/)
handles both music and photos. Perhaps most important to TiVo, it takes
items that TiVo normally can’t handle — WMA files, for instance — and con-
verts them on the fly to MP3, streaming the results to TiVo.
It rips CDs and DVDs on your computer, if your computer has the appropriate
burners, providing a convenient “all-in-one” package for handling computer-
ized media.
189
Chapter 10: Fancy Home Media Option Tricks

The program’s more of an organizer than anything else, grouping your songs
and photos by their tag information rather than physical location. (You can
still view songs by folder, if you want, just as with TiVo.)
J. River Media Center, like MoodLogic, spits out on-the-fly playlists, as seen in
Figure 10-7, based on files you’ve heard or viewed recently.
J. River Media Center isn’t as easy to figure out or navigate as MoodLogic,
however. Although powerful on the desktop, the program’s TiVo capabilities
seem more like a throw-in with little thought to ease-of-navigation with a
remote. But if your computer’s stuffed with unorganized digital photos and a
mixed bag of music files, it might be what you need.
Java Home Media Option (JavaHMO)
Programmed by a team of TiVo fans (who happen to be programmers),
JavaHMO (http://javahmo.sourceforge.net) replaces TiVo Publisher,
adding several new features for Windows, Apple and Linux computers. TiVo
owners may never leave their TV again, as JavaHMO displays local weather
reports (including forecasts and radar images), local movie theater listings
(seen in Figure 10-8), and WebCam photos, as well as the standard songs and
photos.

The price? The software’s free — although it costs more in computer know-
how than MoodLogic or J. River Media Center. If you’re fairly well-versed in
computers, download a copy and begin customizing it to meet your needs. For
instance, adding your own Zip code lets you view local weather information,
as seen in Figure 10-9.

Chapter 10: Fancy Home Media Option Tricks

Whereas some programs toss in support for TiVo as an afterthought, the pro-
grammers of JavaHMO built the program specifically to address TiVo’s HMO
shortcomings, adding and fine-tuning features as they continue to work. Even as
it stands, though, JavaHMO already outdoes the commercial offerings in scope.
 JavaHMO displays photos in BMP, GIF, FlashPix, JPEG, PNG, PNM, TIF,
and WBMP format. It also plays MP3 files and Shoutcast Internet radio
stations, playlists in M3U and PLS formats, images from the Internet, and
other goodies.
 The JavaHMO programmers hope to add support for more games (it
already supports Tic-Tac-Toe), as well as e-mail, Internet searches,
weather alert information, daily comic strips, horoscopes, stock charts,
and other information. Through the use of clever programming tricks,
JavaHMO can pluck virtually any image or data from the Internet and
display it through TiVo.
Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0 and Picasa
MoodLogic works only with music; J. River Media Center and JavaHMO can
handle both music and photos. Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0 (www.adobe.com)
and Picasa (www.picasa.net) work only with photos. Both programs let you
organize your digital photos into categories and publish photo collections to
TiVo. After you create a slideshow, for instance, pushing a Publish to TiVo
button sends the pictures to your TiVo as well as your computer monitor.
Photoshop Album lets you retrieve photos by the date you snapped them 
(provided you set the clock on your digital camera). Once you’ve found your
proper vacation photos, publish them on your TiVo for the enjoyment of your
impatient relatives. (Plying them with eggnog often helps ease the short delay.)
192
Part III: The Home Media Option 
TiVo’s SDK for advanced hacks
TiVo’s Software Developer’s Kit (www.tivo.
com/developer/) not only offers tricks for
programmers, but hope for the future. It ensures
more programs will take advantage of TiVo’s
window into your entertainment center.
In particularly, look for plug-ins written specifi-
cally to enhance TiVo Publisher. For instance,
one plug-in brings Windows Media Player 9
support to TiVo, letting you view files on your
TiVo just as they appear in Media Player: sorted
by artist, album, or genre. The plug-in also lets
you play Media Player’s playlists that are cre-
ated automatically based on when and how
often you play certain files. You’ll find the plug-
in at http://jemfiles.home.comcast.

W
hen TiVo’s on track, it’s a dream machine, automatically trimming
away television’s nightmares, leaving only the pleasant and enjoyable.
Underneath its magic, however, TiVo is, quite simply, a computer. And, like all
computers, it occasionally wakes up from its dream world and faces real-life
problems.
This chapter tackles some of the problems most frequently experienced by
TiVo users. You probably won’t experience more than one or two of them
during your TiVo’s lifetime. But when you do, this chapter holds the quick
fixes that return you and your TiVo back to TV DreamLand.

Fixing Wrong Channel Lineups
To catch a requested show, TiVo examines your channel lineup, matches your
channels with their show schedules, and records the right channel at the pre-
cise moment your show airs. But if TiVo doesn’t know exactly what channels
you receive, or those stations haven’t reported their schedules correctly,
TiVo can act up, with some pretty depressing consequences.
In this section, I explain what can go wrong with channel lineups, why these
things happen, and how to keep them from happening again.
TiVo doesn’t list my channels correctly
Today’s cable or satellite providers offer several hundred channels, and they
routinely tailor their offerings by adding or subtracting channels. Whenever a
provider changes your channel lineup, TiVo usually notices and explains the
results through a prominent Message icon on the opening TiVo Central screen.
Your vigilant TiVo even examines your scheduled recordings and adjusts
them, if possible, to match the new lineup so you won’t miss any shows.
But if TiVo doesn’t list some of the channels you receive — or if TiVo lists
channels you don’t receive, here’s how to make TiVo’s channel lineup match
your own.
1. Head to TiVo Messages & Setup from TiVo Central.
2. Choose Settings, then select Preferences.
3. Choose Customize Channels.
Examine the lineup carefully to make sure TiVo lists your correct subscrip-
tion package, and that you’ve placed checkmarks next to the channels you
receive, as seen in Figure 11-1.
I give more extensive information about tweaking TiVo’s channel lineup in
Chapter 4.
Examine a copy of your latest cable or satellite bill when adjusting TiVo’s
channel lineup. It helps you understand your subscription package, as well as
the channels not included in your subscription.
Instead of simply placing checkmarks next to all your received channels, feel
free to uncheck channels you receive but never watch. Most people uncheck
shopping channels, for instance, just to keep them off TiVo’s menus.
196
Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo 

TiVo doesn’t list the right show 
descriptions for my channel
Most channels release their upcoming schedules weeks in advance. When
a schedule’s late or incorrect, poor TiVo doesn’t know what show it’s
monitoring — or sometimes it lists the wrong shows or descriptions. To fix
TiVo’s natural confusion, try these three things:
1. Notify TiVo of the problem.
Head to the Customer Service area of TiVo’s Web site (www.tivo.com).
You’ll find a form to fill out and send to their Lineup Specialists. (Can’t
find the form? Try heading directly to http://customersupport.
tivo.com/caseSubmitLineup.asp.)
2. Notify the station of the problem.
Our cable company listed a local university’s TV station, for instance,
but didn’t list descriptions for any of its shows. I found the station’s
e-mail address on its Web site, told them of the problem, and sent them
links to TiVo. They sent the information to TiVo, and their show descrip-
tions appeared on TiVo’s lists in about two weeks.
Figure 11-1:
Make sure
TiVo lists
your correct
subscription
package,
and that
you’ve
placed
checkmarks

receive.
197
Chapter 11: When Things Go Wrong . . .

3. Follow up in two weeks.
Sometimes you simply must be persistent. If the show descriptions
haven’t appeared after two weeks, fill out the form again. Contact the
station to make sure they know of the problem.
 Make sure your TiVo knows the channels you receive, as described in
the previous section. The descriptions may be wrong because TiVo
thinks you subscribe to a different service or subscription package.
 TiVo receives its show description information from Tribune Media
Services, which lists the same show descriptions online at Zap2It
(www.zap2it.com). Visit Zap2It, enter your Zip code, and choose your
TV provider to browse your show listings. If that Web site doesn’t list the
correct information for a channel or show, your TiVo won’t, either. (That
helps confirm that the problem lies with the station, not your TiVo.)
TiVo records the wrong show
A Reuter’s news article probably summed it up best: “Only TiVo fans know
the radical disappointment of settling in to watch a recording of, say, a biog-
raphy of actor Johnny Depp, and discovering that TiVo has captured a
kitchen knife infomercial instead.”
This problem can’t really be blamed on TiVo, though. TiVo turned to the cor-
rect channel at the correct time and recorded for the correct duration. But
the station pulled a “bait and switch”: While claiming to run the bio, the sta-
tion snuck in a last-minute infomercial, zapping Depp’s biography in the
process.
Short of squirming uncomfortably, nothing helps this situation. If TiVo missed
the show because it tuned to the wrong channel, however, TiVo’s “IR Blaster”
probably needs some tweaking. I describe that process in this chapter’s
“Channel Changing Problems” section.
 If TiVo records a show in the wrong language, your Secondary Audio
Programming could need adjusting. I explain how to do so in Chapter 7’s
sidebar, “Turning on TiVo’s Secondary Audio Program.”
 Sometimes TiVo records a Suggestion that’s broadcast in a foreign
language. This usually happens because you’ve left a foreign-language
channel “checked” in your Channels Received list. I explain how to
remove it — along with any unwanted shopping channels — earlier in
this chapter, in “TiVo doesn’t list my channels correctly.”
198
Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo 

Controlling Your TV’s (And/Or Stereo’s)
Power and Volume with TiVo’s Remote
Juggling a handful of remotes during a movie makes it difficult to manage the
popcorn. To fix the problem, set up TiVo’s remote to control your TiVo and
your TV. If you route your sound through your home stereo, set the remote to
control that, instead.
To teach these tasks to TiVo’s remote, head to Messages and Setup from TiVo
Central; then into Recorder (or Receiver) and Phone Setup. There, you’ll find
Remote Control Setup, along with instructions on how to program TiVo’s
remote to work with your TV or home stereo.
I describe the process in detail in Chapter 4.
Fine-Tuning TiVo’s Suggestions
TiVo records Suggestions based on the shows you’ve watched in the past, as
well as how you’ve rated shows with your Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down
buttons.
199
Chapter 11: When Things Go Wrong . . .
Buying or selling a used TiVo
You’re free to buy or sell a used TiVo; you’ll find
plenty for sale on eBay (www.ebay.com), for
instance. They require a little extra work, mainly
to make sure the account is transferred cor-
rectly to the new owner.
If you’re selling a TiVo with a monthly service
account, cancel your contract by calling TiVo
Customer Support at 877-367-8486 between 8
a.m. and 8 p.m., PST. Wait until the last minute,
as Customer Support pulls your account imme-
diately. The new owner will immediately face
the “Activation” nag screens until they Activate
their TiVo at TiVo’s Web site (www.tivo.com/
activate).
If you’re selling a TiVo with Lifetime Service,
remember that the Lifetime Service is tied to
your TiVo, not to you. If you buy a replacement
TiVo, you must buy new service, either monthly
or lifetime. And when you sell, either you or the
TiVo’s new owner must call TiVo Customer
Support to transfer the lifetime ownership to the
new owner.
Be very careful when buying a used TiVo with
Lifetime Service, especially through the mail.
There’s no way of knowing whether that TiVo
really has Lifetime Service until you plug it in,
read its Service Number, and tell that number to
TiVo’s Customer Support staff. Be forewarned:
There’s no such thing as a DirecTV TiVo with
“Lifetime Service,” as DirecTV doesn’t offer that
option. Somebody may be trying to rip you off.

But sometimes TiVo just doesn’t “get it,” and its Suggestions don’t capture the
“real you.” To get an idea of who TiVo thinks you are, choose Pick Programs to
Record from TiVo Central and choose TiVo Suggestions. After a quick calcula-
tion, TiVo reveals its list of upcoming Suggestions, seen in Figure 11-2.
If TiVo’s Suggestions seem wildly off-base, start from scratch: Choose TiVo
Messages & Setup from TiVo Central, and select Restart or Reset System.
Choose Reset Thumb Ratings & Suggestions, and press Select. TiVo saves
your recorded shows, WishLists and Season Passes, but “forgets” what shows
you’ve watched previously, as well as how you’ve used the Thumbs Up/Down
buttons.
Then, to teach TiVo your idea of a good time, try to balance your use of the
Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down buttons: Vote for something you like as often
for something you dislike. Most importantly, reserve your three Thumbs Up
and Down ratings for shows that really affected you in some way. Sticking to
the more modest two presses keeps TiVo a little more balanced.
Anything with a three Thumbs Up often becomes an automatic Suggestion.
TiVo records it frequently (but not always) when there’s available space.

Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo 

Some people like TiVo’s Suggestions merely as an indicator of free space on
their hard drive: Lots of Suggestions mean lots of empty space. You can turn
them off if you want, however. Select Messages & Setup from TiVo Central,
and choose Settings. Select Preferences, then choose TiVo Suggestions to
turn them off or back on.
Troubleshooting Video Problems
This section explains how to troubleshoot problems your TiVo may have
when displaying video, from a completely black screen to low-quality video.
If you’re only missing some channels from TiVo’s Channel Guide, check to see
if the Guide’s “filter” is turned on. (I cover the Guide and its filters in Chapter
5.) Press Enter and remove the filter; TiVo should display all the channels
listed in its Channel Preferences area, covered earlier in this chapter.
TiVo doesn’t display any video
We’re talking no video at all here: a completely blank screen. Zilch. Nada.
1. Check the power.
Rule out the easy stuff first. Have you turned on your TV (or VCR/stereo,
if the TiVo connects through those)? Press your remote’s TiVo button to
make sure TiVo hasn’t dropped into “Standby” mode.
2. Check the cables and Line Input settings.
Chapter 3 describes how to connect your TiVo to your TV and other
equipment. Are all the correct cables plugged in tightly?
Many TVs, VCRs and stereos accept more than one video source. Look
for the Line Input button, and make sure you’ve selected the TiVo as the
source.
3. Turn TiVo on and off again.
Unplug TiVo from its wall outlet and wait fifteen seconds before plugging
it in again. Look for TiVo’s reassuring startup screens announcing that
it’s woken back up.
4. Isolate the problem.
Remove anything you’ve connected between TiVo and the TV, bypassing
your VCR, home stereo, or other items. See if TiVo works when plugged
201
Chapter 11: When Things Go Wrong . . .

directly into your TV. If it works, start connecting other items to see
which one causes the problem. When you find it, adjust its settings until
TiVo appears.
To make sure the problem isn’t starting at the source, connect your
cable or satellite box straight to your TV. Our TiVo’s biggest problems
start when our cable box freezes or sleeps. I unplug the cable box from
the power outlet, wait a few seconds, and plug it back in to solve the
problem. (One time I called the cable company; they flipped some
switches on their end, and it began working again.)
 To make sure you don’t accidentally turn off your cable box, hide its
remote. If you accidentally turn it off, TiVo won’t be able to record any-
thing. Also, your cable or satellite company sometimes turns off the box
after sending it a software update, leaving TiVo unable to record shows.
Make sure the box’s power light is always on.
 Did TiVo record a black screen instead of a TV show? If other recently
recorded shows also contain a black screen, TiVo’s not receiving the
video signal. Check your cable connections, and try unplugging your
cable or satellite box, waiting fifteen seconds and plugging it in again. If
other recently recorded shows are okay, the station probably experi-
enced a blackout when the show aired. (Particularly ugly storms occa-
sionally black out video for satellite users.)
The video looks grainy
TiVo lets you record shows in several different video qualities. Without a
doubt, Best Quality looks the best. If you use lower qualities, you’ll probably
notice slight video discrepancies, usually during rapid movements. Action
movies, sporting events, and other fast-moving shows bring out the worst
quality problems. The bigger your TV, the more noticeable the quality level.
Not all people notice these problems. (In fact, they don’t affect DirecTV
TiVos, as they always record in Best Quality.) But if you do, choose Options
when choosing to record a problem and record the show in Best Quality.
(Chapter 12 describes a simple way to increase your TiVo’s storage space,
allowing you to record everything at Best Quality.)
 Use TiVo’s S-Video output, if your TV or stereo equipment allows the
connection, described in Chapter 3. S-Video consistently provides a
sharper picture than other methods. The better your picture, the better
TiVo’s picture will be.
 If you’re watching Live TV and suddenly the picture starts to look grainy,
it’s probably because TiVo began recording the show at less than Best
Quality. Either stop the recording and watch the show live or change the
show’s recording quality to Best. (You can usually do this through TiVo’s
Season Pass Manager, covered in Chapter 6.)

Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo 

Troubleshooting Sound Problems
When you don’t hear any sound coming from your TiVo — but you see the
video — start from the top of this list and work your way down, ruling out
possible causes along the way.
1. Check your power, mute and volume controls.
Make sure your TiVo’s plugged in, as well as your TV, cable/satellite box
(and stereo, if used). Is the mute turned off and the volume turned up?
2. Check the cable connections.
Are TiVo’s sound cables connected correctly? (Chapter 3 gives the whole
rundown.) Yellow cables connect the video; the red and white cables
connect the sound. Using an S-Video cable? You still need to connect the
red and white cables for sound. (S-Video only carries video.)
Try connecting the TiVo straight to the TV, removing anything in
between (VCRs and stereos, for instance.) Still nothing? Try connecting
the TV straight to your cable or satellite box to see if TiVo’s the problem.
Before blaming TiVo, try using different types of cables. (Your TiVo came
boxed with quite a few, if you recall.) For instance, use the coaxial con-
nector instead of the yellow, red and white ones or vice versa. I describe
cables and connectors in Chapter 3.
3. Restart TiVo.
If you can see the video, choose Messages & Setup from TiVo Central.
Select Restart and System Reset, and choose Restart the DVR. TiVo will
turn itself off, then on again. Can’t see the video? Then unplug TiVo, wait
15 seconds, and plug it back in.
203
Chapter 11: When Things Go Wrong . . .
Using TiVo’s Troubleshooting menus
TiVo includes several built-in Troubleshooting
menus. You’ll find them on the TiVo Messages &
Setup menu, accessible through TiVo Central.
The Troubleshooting menus offer help in five
areas:
 Parental Controls
 Phone
 Channel Changing
 Network
 Transfer (for Home Media Option users)
The Troubleshooting menus are more of a help-
ful memory jogger than anything else, summing
up information buried in the manual. However,
sometimes that’s all you need to understand
why TiVo’s not acting the way you expected.

4. Check your TV (and stereo, if used).
Make sure you’ve turned off your TV’s SAP (Secondary Audio
Programming), and the TV is set to the correct Line Input. (You may
need to pull out your TV’s manual to find these switches; they vary
among TV models.) Check your stereo’s Line Input switches, too. The
stereo might still be trying to play your DVD player, for instance, instead
of TiVo.
5. Connect the TiVo directly to your TV.
Remove anything that’s connected between the TV and your TiVo,
including VCRs or stereos. Also, try connecting your cable or satellite
box directly to your TV. This helps you decide if the problem stems from
TiVo, the TV, or perhaps the TV signal itself.
 If your sound and video appear out of sync, press the Pause button, then
start playing again. If the problem continues, make sure you’re playing
both the video and sound through TiVo. I once tried routing the sound
through my 5.1 Surround Sound stereo; the video was about a half-
second delayed from the sound.
 Use your home stereo or boom box to play the sound directly from your
cable/satellite box. That helps determine if the sound’s coming from
your cable/satellite box or not.
Channel Changing Problems
TiVo almost always changes channels correct with simple setups — where the
TiVo connects directly to an antenna or a cable dangling from the wall. Channel
changing problems using happen when TiVo connects through a cable or satel-
lite box. Here are some of the major problems, and their solutions.
If possible, connect TiVo to your cable or satellite box through the box’s serial
port. This almost eliminates channel changing problems. (Unfortunately, many
boxes don’t come with serial ports that support channel changing.)
Keeping TiVo from changing 
channels during live TV
Instead of watching TV, some people listen to the radio stations that come in
through their cable box. Suddenly, TiVo bumps Sinatra and begins recording
SpongeBob Squarepants. What gives?
204
Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo 

Similar problems plague people who watch lots of live TV (although this can
sometimes be fixed by setting up TiVo in a slightly different way, described in
Chapter 3). TiVo suddenly switches to a different channel.
The problem breaks down to this: TiVo always needs full control of your
cable box. When TiVo needs to record a scheduled show, it needs to change
the channel and begin recording. (Sometimes TiVo changes the channel
simply to record a Suggestion.)
The easiest solution is to call the cable company and rent a second cable
box. Connect that cable box directly to TiVo, being careful to place a shield or
“tent” around the front of the box where TiVo’s IR blaster connects.
Then use the other box for watching “live TV” or listening to cable radio,
uninterrupted.
 Some people tell TiVo to record their favorite cable radio channel for
three hours during the late-night, when nothing else is being recorded.
When they want to hear cable radio, they simply play back their TiVo
recording. (Record the “Seasonal” channel to provide uninterrupted
music for your holiday parties.)
 If you’ve recorded your music to MP3s, check out TiVo’s Home Media
Option. It lets you listen to MP3s through your TiVo, bypassing the need
for the cable radio station.
 Chapter 3 explores different ways to connect TiVo to a single box so you
can still watch live uninterrupted TV. 
Sometimes TiVo won’t change 
channels on my cable box!
When first setting up your TiVo, described in Chapter 3, you place a little
black “IR Blaster” over the front of the cable box. The IR Blaster mimics the
remote for your cable box. To change a channel, TiVo sends the cable box’s
remote signals through the IR Blaster, which in turn tells the remote to
change channels.
But if the IR Blaster isn’t positioned correctly, the cable box never gets the
signal to change the channel, and TiVo ends up recording whatever channel
the box happens to be delivering.
205
Chapter 11: When Things Go Wrong . . .

One of these things should fix the problem:
1. Double-check the link between TiVo and your cable box.
First, make sure one end of the TiVo’s “IR blaster” cable is plugged into
TiVo’s IR port. The other end should be taped to your cable box, with
the IR Blaster pointing into the cable box’s IR receiver. (You’ll find com-
plete instructions in Chapter 3.)
While pressing the TiVo’s Channel Up or Down button, try moving the IR
Blaster to different locations around the cable box. It may not be close
enough, or sometimes too close.
2. Check the speed of the signal.
Adjust the speed of your IR Blaster’s signals. In Chapter 4, I explain how
to change the codes TiVo uses, as well as the speed it sends them.
3. Place a “tent” around your cable box with the IR Blaster inside.
I’ve taped the IR Blaster in front of our cable box, then bent some alu-
minum foil over the cable box’s front, being careful not to block any air
vents. The foil keeps the IR Blaster’s signals close to the cable box, and
keeps other remotes from interfering.
Many digital cameras and camcorders can “see” the light from a remote.
Watch the remote through the camera’s viewfinder, and push the Channel Up
button to see whether you spot a light. (Don’t confuse the Infrared light with
the red light that lights up on most remotes. The Infrared light is a second
light, and it often appears white.) This trick sometimes helps diagnose a faulty
remote. TiVo sells replacement remotes online (https://store.tivo.com).
Examining the Recording History
When TiVo doesn’t record something it should — or deletes something it
shouldn’t have, find out why by probing TiVo’s most detailed records: its
Recording History. To see TiVo’s Recording History, choose Pick Programs 
to Record from TiVo Central, and choose the To Do List. Finally, choose View
Recording History at the list’s top.
TiVo displays a list of its current actives, highlighting the current date, as
seen in Figure 11-3. From there, you can scroll forward or backward two
weeks in either direction to see TiVo’s explanations of events. 
206
Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo 

Press the Right Arrow or Select to read that event’s description. In Figure 11-4,
for instance, TiVo explains that TiVo deleted “The Twisted World of Marge”
episode of “The Simpsons” because the “Keep at Most” limit had been reached.
Figure 11-4:

207
Chapter 11: When Things Go Wrong . . .

I’d set that limit when setting up my Season Pass for The Simpsons. So, TiVo
simply obeyed my instructions by deleting that episode and replacing it with
a newer one.
 To flip quickly through the Recording History page by page, press the
Channel Up or Channel Down buttons.
 You won’t get away with deleting a roommate’s show and blaming it on
TiVo. When your roommate examines TiVo’s Recording History, TiVo will
list the deleted show along with the message, “This program was deleted
because someone in your household removed it from Now Playing on
4/15 at 9:36 am.” The date and time will differ, of course, according to the
time of your evil deed.
Solving Phone Problems
Standalone TiVos need to phone TiVo headquarters every day or so to down-
load the latest show listings. That’s the only way it can keep almost two
weeks of show listings on call. Here are some tricks to figure out phone prob-
lems. (DirecTV TiVos receive their guide data through the satellite, not the
phone, so this section probably doesn’t apply to them.)
Forcing TiVo to make a phone call
If you currently leave a phone cord strung across your living room floor, put
it away. Just plug TiVo into the phone jack once a week — on weekends, for
instance, if that helps you remember — and then tell TiVo to make its call:
1. Choose TiVo Messages & Setup from TiVo Central.
2. Select Settings and choose Phone & Network Setup.
3. Select Connect to the TiVo Service Now.
TiVo makes its call, downloads any listings or updates it needs, and hangs up.
When TiVo’s finished, roll up the phone cord until next week.
To test whether TiVo’s connecting with the phone correctly, make a test call
by choosing Test Connection from the same menu, seen in Figure 11-5. TiVo
calls in, sets its clock, and hangs up, constantly displaying its progress
onscreen. If it doesn’t finish, something’s wrong.
208
Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo 

 If something’s wrong with your TiVo’s phone dialer (its modem), call
TiVo’s Customer Support number, as described near the end of this
chapter. Be sure to have your information ready, and don’t call during
lunch hour — that’s when you’ll have the longest wait time.
 If your TiVo’s modem dies, you can ship it off to TiVo or the manufac-
turer for repair (free, if it’s within warranty, although you pay for ship-
ping). Chapter 13 also lists several places that repair TiVos and sell
replacement parts to do-it-yourselfers.
Keeping TiVo from calling 
long-distance numbers
TiVo needs to contact its headquarters to fetch your latest channel listings. If
your TiVo’s currently dialing a long-distance number, you might be able to
find a local one.
1. Choose TiVo Messages & Setup from TiVo Central.
2. Choose Settings, then Phone & Network Setup.
Figure 11-5:
Tell TiVo to
make a
quick test
call to see
whether it’s
connecting.
209
Chapter 11: When Things Go Wrong . . .

3. Choose Edit phone or network settings, then Phone Dialing Options.
4. Choose Set Dial-In Number.
5. Enter your area code using the remote control, and press Select.
TiVo dials a toll-free number to fetch its latest list of phone numbers in
your area.
6. Select the number closest to you.
If in doubt, look in your phone book or call the operator to find a
number that doesn’t charge a toll.
7. Tell TiVo how to dial the number and confirm the results.
To accommodate different phone setups, TiVo needs to know whether
you dial the number only, the prefix followed by the number, or add a 1
before the prefix and the number. Choose the format your phone
prefers. When TiVo lists your correct setup, press Select.
TiVo uses MCI’s dial-up access numbers for its daily call. If you’re having trou-
ble finding a free number, check online for the most recent list at http://
www3.tivo.com/tivo-misc/popfinder.do.
If you’re handy with computers, TiVo can leave its phone fixation behind and
connect through your computer’s broadband Internet connection, as I
describe in Chapter 10.
 With all the area code splits taking place these days, numbers in differ-
ent area codes are sometimes local calls. Try a neighboring area code to
see if any of those numbers may be free.
 If you’re stuck with long-distance, check your phone calling plan.
Strangely enough, some plans offer out-of-state calling rates that are lower
than your own state’s rates. Check with your phone company, explain
your situation, and ask if they have a different plan that might reduce
your charges. You might even find lower rates by using a calling card.
I Need More Storage Space!
If you’re constantly running out of room to hold your recorded shows, slip in
a larger hard drive, described in Chapter 12. WeaKnees.com (www.weaknees.
com) ships some of the simplest TiVo upgrade kits around. Seen in Figure
11-6, the company’s Web site leads you through the purchase of the right kit
for your particular TiVo model. The company then sends you the hard drive,
the printed instructions, and all the tools you need to finish the job.
It’s so simple, my mom could do it. (I might have to help her remove TiVo’s
case, though, as that’s the hardest part.)
210
Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo 

If adding storage space isn’t an option, your only alternative is use a lower
recording quality or TiVo’s “Save to VCR” feature, covered in Chapter 6,
which lets you save shows to videotape for later viewing.
Gathering Information about Your TiVo
Should you give up all hope and visit TiVo’s Web site or phone their customer
service department, you’ll need to give them specific information about your
TiVo model. You’ll find much of this information on TiVo’s System Information
screen:
1. Choose Messages & Setup from TiVo Central.
2. Choose System Information.
The System Information screen, seen in Figure 11-7, shows your TiVo’s
most important information. Write them down below for reference. (Use
pencil for the software version, as it changes occasionally.) Press the
Channel Down button to see even more information, including the date
of its last successful connection to TiVo headquarters, and its current
operating temperature.

Checking TiVo’s recording history
To see a record of why your TiVo decided to record, skip, or delete certain
shows, head for its Recording History. Choose Pick Programs to Record from
TiVo Central, and choose the To Do List. Finally, choose View Recording
History at the list’s top.
I discuss TiVo’s Recording History earlier in this chapter.
Checking TiVo’s available storage space
TiVo consumes more storage space the higher you set its video qualities. To
see how many hours of shows your TiVo can record, choose TiVo Messages &
Setup from TiVo Central, and select Settings. Choose Preferences and select
Video Recording Quality. As seen in Figure 11-9, TiVo lists the approximate
number of hours of recording time you receive at each quality level.
TiVo lists your total storage area on this page — not just the amount of hours
you have left. You can increase the amount of total storage by replacing or
adding a hard drive, covered in Chapter 12.

213
Chapter 11: When Things Go Wrong . . .

TiVo doesn’t provide a way to see how much free space is left, as that
number changes constantly depending on how many shows you’ve currently
recorded, when you’ve recorded them, your upcoming recordings, and your
quality settings. Look at the number of recorded Suggestions to gauge your
available free space.
Setting Up TiVo When You Move
Once you’ve unpacked your TiVo at its new home (hopefully you saved its
old cables), begin connecting it to your TV, as I describe in Chapter 3. When
you’re through, you need to run through a few menus, introducing TiVo to its
new environment. Here are the hoops to jump through:
1. Check TiVo’s phone number and dialing options.
From TiVo Central, select TiVo Messages & Setup, then Settings. The
phone menus lead you to the area for changing the dialing options. Even
if you don’t have to change the dialing options (prefixes that turn off Call
Waiting, for instance, or dial long-distance numbers), change TiVo’s Dial-
Up phone number to one in your new area code.
2. Select your new television providers.
Chances are, you’ll be receiving new channels, either through a new cable
or satellite service or by moving within range of a different broadcast
Figure 11-9:
TiVo lists the
approximate
number of
hours you

quality.
214
Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo 

antenna. To select your new channel lineup, repeat the Guided Setup I
describe in Chapter 4. While there, check your Time Zone and Daylight
Savings Time information.
3. Update your contact information.
Visit TiVo’s Web site (www.tivo.com), select Manage My Account, and
update your contact information. Make sure TiVo has your correct
address, phone number, and e-mail address.
When TiVo makes its first call from its new location, it may take longer than
usual to come to its senses, particularly if it’s been turned off for more a week
or two. (It needs to index lots of new information.)
Restarting or Resetting TiVo, 
or Starting from Scratch
When TiVo seems to be acting up, it’s time to call in the big guns. Choose
TiVo Messages & Setup from TiVo Central, and select Restart or Reset System.
TiVo offers several options, seen in Figure 11-10, and they all sound scary.
Here’s the damage control assessment for each one.
Figure 11-10:

215
Chapter 11: When Things Go Wrong . . .

Restart the TiVo DVR: This simply turns off TiVo, then starts it up again —
sort of a safe way unplugging it and plugging it back in. You won’t lose any
recorded shows, Season Passes, WishLists, or Suggestions. Like flipping a
computer’s power switch, this little kick in the butt sometimes fixes odd
problems.
Repeat Guided Setup: Use this mostly if you move or change your TV
provider. It resets the list of Channels You Receive and Favorite channels, but
your recorded programs, Season Passes, WishLists, and Suggestions remain
untouched.
Reset Thumb Ratings & Suggestions: If TiVo’s Suggestions seem way out of
whack with your interests — or if the kids start playing haphazardly with the
Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down buttons — use this clear things up. TiVo clears its
memory of your Thumbs ratings and recorded Suggestions. Your recorded
shows, Season Passes, WishLists and Suggestions stay safe.
Clear Program Information & To Do List: A potentially dangerous move, this
clears all scheduled recordings, cancels Season Passes, wipes out the To Do
list, and removes all Thumbs ratings. Your recorded shows stay safe, how-
ever. During its next call, TiVo receives fresh program information, which
could take about an hour of processing. Don’t try to schedule any recordings
until it’s through.
Clear and Delete Everything: This is the most biggest gun, and it’s plenty
powerful: TiVo returns to the state it was when first taken out of the box. You
lose everything. Use only as a last resort, or perhaps when selling your TiVo.
216
Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo 
Calling Tech Support
Before calling TiVo’s Customer Support, try solv-
ing the problem yourself with the steps in this
chapter. 
Check 
out 
TiVo’s 
Web 
site
(www.tivo.com), too. Once you finally get
through to a live person at TiVo, they’ll run you
through the same steps outlined here and on
the Web site — and you’ll probably be paying
for the long-distance call. If you try these fixes
yourself, you’ll spend a little less time with the
customer service person.
DirecTV TiVo owners must contact DirecTV for
support; TiVo’s only responsible for the TiVo
Service on those units, not the box itself.
Still ready to call? It works like this: TiVo
Incorporated offers two types of customer ser-
vice. When you call their toll-free number, a
robotic voice guides you through a touch-tone
question/answer session. You’ll find most of the
robot’s answers available either in TiVo’s
manual or on its Web site. 

217
Chapter 11: When Things Go Wrong . . .
When you give up on the robot, the creature
hands you TiVo’s real Tech Support phone
number in California. This number is sometimes
toll free, but most-likely long distance, and it has
wait times of anywhere from a few minutes to
more than a half-hour. I found the staff to be
knowledgeable, communicative, and friendly
during my call. After about a half-hour of run-
ning through some of the tests described here,
they announced my new TiVo as Dead On
Arrival. (They sent me a new one.)
Before calling Customer Support, spend some
time on TiVo’s Web site. It’s quite impressive,
especially since there’s no such thing as “a”
TiVo. Several manufacturers build TiVo, and
many use slightly different software versions and
setup combinations. The Web site remembers
which brand and model of TiVo you own, and
screens out material pertaining to other models,
making it easier to find answers that pertain to
your own TiVo, not your neighbor’s.
If you can’t find your answer through the Web
site’s guided menus, click “Browse All Articles”
to dig through the wealth of information. TiVo
offers e-mail support, as well. You may wait
twenty-four hours for a response, but it sure
beats waiting on hold.
Finally, I list several Web sites devoted to TiVo
in Chapter 13; give them a look before calling
TiVo’s Customer Support lines. I’ve found the
people at the TiVo Community Forum
(www.tivocommunity.com) to be especially
helpful and informative.

H
undreds of unwatched TV shows flow past us every hour, but that
doesn’t ease the pain when a recorded show scrolls off your TiVo for
lack of room. The best way to ease that pain is to increase TiVo’s storage
space — its hard drive, just like the one in your computer. And, just as with a
computer, TiVo’s old hard drive can be upgraded with a new, higher-capacity
drive fairly easily.
Adding a new hard drive to TiVo once fell exclusively to techies who under-
stood words like “Torx” and “Linux.” Now that TiVo’s been enthusiastically
greeted by a more mainstream crowd, several companies sell ready-to-go
upgrade kits designed specifically for ease of installation. An upgrade kit
makes it easy to double or even triple the number of television hours you can
hoard in your TiVo’s storage space.
This chapter describes the step-by-step process of upgrading your TiVo, from
buying a new hard drive to viewing the menu that displays your newly
increased storage capacity. Budget yourself about a half hour for this one,
and don’t hesitate. You’ll love the extra storage space.

Understanding Your Upgrade 
Options and Risks
Tinkering with any consumer electronics product involves some risks. Take
these risks into consideration before upgrading your TiVo:
 Removing TiVo’s case voids its warranty. If you break something while
tinkering, don’t expect TiVo to repair it for free. (TiVo’s warranty for
most models covers 90 days of free labor and one year of free parts
exchange; the warranty for your model may differ.)
 Like other consumer electronics devices, TiVo’s power supply can store
a powerful jolt of electricity — even when TiVo’s not plugged in. Don’t
touch parts unnecessarily, and give TiVo some settling time before
opening its case.
That said, upgrading TiVo is fairly easy. Replacing its hard drive is nearly
identical to replacing a computer’s hard drive. And since an upgrade kit’s
hard drive comes pre-loaded with TiVo’s software, everything works as soon
as you plug TiVo back in.
Buying a Hard Drive Upgrade Kit
You can upgrade your TiVo’s storage space several ways. I’ve ranked them
here from easiest to most difficult.
Buy an already upgraded new TiVo. Some companies sell new TiVos
prestocked with larger hard drives. Whereas many of today’s TiVos come
with either a 40MB or 80MB hard drive, companies like WeaKnees and
PTVupgrade (both covered in Chapter 13) sell new, ready-to-go TiVos with
more than 300 hours of storage capacity.
Send in your TiVo for upgrades. Both WeaKnees and PTVupgrade will
upgrade your TiVo for a fee. You merely pack it up and mail it to them.
(PTVupgrade can even send you a customized packing box, complete with
return shipping label.)
Replace TiVo’s existing hard drive yourself. The easiest method for do-it-
yourselfers (and the method I explain in this chapter), this entails opening
220
Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo 

TiVo’s case, removing TiVo’s existing hard drive, plugging in the replacement
drive upgrade kit, and replacing TiVo’s case.
Pros: A replacement hard drive upgrade kit comes pre-loaded with TiVo
software. When plugged in, TiVo wakes up in like-new condition — but
with much more storage capacity. You can save your old drive as a
backup against problems down the road. Being factory new, the replace-
ment drive is less prone to failure than TiVo’s existing drive, especially for
older TiVos.
Cons: Replacing your drive will wipe out your existing recordings, set-
tings, Season Passes and WishLists. You’ll have to run TiVo’s Guided
Setup again to tell TiVo your connection settings, channels, and other
information. 
Add a second drive to TiVo. Pop open TiVo’s case, add a second drive upgrade
kit, and close TiVo’s case. That gives TiVo two drives for show storage.
Pros: Your recorded shows and settings stay intact, and TiVo immedi-
ately begins filling the second drive with shows, more than doubling your
current storage.
Cons: Adding a second drive requires more work and skill. Depending on
your TiVo model, you’ll be adding extra cables, brackets, and perhaps
even an extra fan for cooling. TiVo keeps using your older drive, leaving a
higher chance of failure down the road. Experienced computer users can
handle these things, but first-time do-it-yourselfers may find them overly
demanding.
Several companies sell TiVo upgrade kits through the Internet. I list them and
their Web sites in Chapter 13. The replacement hard drive upgrade kit I pur-
chased for this chapter came from WeaKnees (www.weaknees.com). Like all
the kits, it arrived with the tools necessary for installation and a detailed,
step-by-step instruction sheet customized for my particular TiVo model. The
new drive arrived a few days after I ordered it, and it installed without a hitch.
The rest of this chapter describes the rough steps necessary for replacing
TiVo’s existing hard drive with a new, larger one using an upgrade kit similar
to the ones sold by WeaKnees (seen in Figure 12-1). Use this chapter only as a
general guide to how upgrade kits work. Your own replacement kit will con-
tain instructions written specifically to cover your own TiVo model, and you
should follow those.

Before upgrading your TiVo, examine your upgrade kit and its instructions to
make sure you’ve received all the necessary parts and tools. Make sure the
upgrade kit and its instructions are written for your particular TiVo model. If
something is missing, phone or e-mail the store, and ask for the missing part
or tool. 
When this chapter’s instructions differ from your kit’s instructions, follow your
kit’s instructions. They’re customized to your exact TiVo model; these are not.
The hard drives in upgrade kits come with TiVo’s software pre-installed. If
you simply buy and install a hard drive from the computer store, your TiVo
won’t work. The drive must first be properly configured for your TiVo model.
1. Write down your TiVo’s old settings.
Replacing TiVo’s hard drive returns TiVo to a “like new” condition. If
you’ve spent a lot of time creating WishLists and Season Passes, write
them down on paper so you can re-enter them later.
2. Prepare your work area.
Clean off a table large enough to hold TiVo, your upgrade kit, and its
bundled tools. Don’t place TiVo on carpet, especially if you live in a dry,
static-prone area.

3. Unplug TiVo’s power cord and cables.
TiVo doesn’t use an “On/Off” switch. To turn it off, just unplug it from the
wall. Unplug all its attached cables, and place it on your work area’s
table. If you like to plan ahead, label the cables with some sticky notes
so you know where to plug them back in.
Wait five minutes before removing TiVo’s cover; this gives the power
supply a little time to discharge.
4. Unscrew the screws on TiVo’s cover with a Torx wrench.
Depending on your TiVo model, your upgrade kit came with one or two
Torx wrenches. (A Torx wrench’s end looks like a “star” that fits per-
fectly in the screw’s indentations. Regular screwdrivers won’t work.) Use
the Torx wrench to remove the screws holding TiVo’s cover to its chas-
sis, seen in Figure 12-2. Be sure to remove only the screws on the cover
itself; avoid removing screws that hold other parts to the chassis.
Put the screws in a safe place so you don’t lose them. I use an empty
egg carton, placing each set of removed screws into a different egg’s
compartment.
5. Remove TiVo’s cover from its chassis.
Slide TiVo’s cover from its front toward the back. (You may have to push
rather hard, sometimes with your palms along the top’s side edges.) As
the cover slides back, lift it up and off TiVo.
Once you’re inside, be careful of static electricity. If you live in a static-
prone area, use an anti-static wrist strap (available at Radio Shack and
other places) to avoid harming TiVo’s sensitive internal organs. No anti-
static strap around? Then you can always touch the metal chassis with
your hand before touching any electronic components.
Remove only the screws holding TiVo's case to the chassis.
Don't remove screws from the chassis itself.

Removing the Old Drive
Once you’ve removed TiVo’s cover, exposing its internal organs, identify the
parts inside. You need to detach everything from the old hard drive so you
can replace it with the new one.
1. Locate and identify TiVo’s hard drive and cables.
Your TiVo will look somewhat like the one in Figure 12-3. Take some time
to locate its hard drive, drive bay or bracket, IDE cable, power cable,
and anything else listed in your kit’s instructions.
The IDE cable is flat and wide, often with a black or blue connector. The
power cable consists of four cables that attach to the hard drive with a
white connector.
TiVo’s hard drive — the silver rectangular thing — is screwed into its
drive bay or bracket.

2. Remove the hard drive from its bracket and unplug the drive’s IDE
cable and power cable.
Depending on your kit’s instructions, you may first need to remove your
hard drive’s bracket from the chassis in order to remove the hard drive
from TiVo. If so, use the Torx wrench to remove the screws holding the
bracket to TiVo’s chassis. Save the bracket and its screws to attach to
the new drive.
Next, remove the drive from its bracket, usually with the same Torx
wrenches. Drives usually attach with four screws.
Finally, unplug the IDE and power cables from the hard drive, leaving
their other ends firmly attached to TiVo’s internal organs. Pull on the
cables’ connectors — not on the wires themselves — when detaching
them from the drive. Figure 12-4 shows the connectors; the power
cable’s white connector is above the IDE cable’s black connector. You
may need to rock the connectors back and forth slightly to unplug them.

3. Place your old drive in a safe place.
You probably won’t need it again, but keep your old hard drive in a safe
place, inside the new drive’s protective bag, as a backup. If something
ever goes wrong with your new drive, pop in the old drive while you
wait for a replacement to arrive.
Drives are sensitive. Don’t drop them. 
Adding the New Drive
Your new hard drive may bear a different brand name, but it should look very
similar to the one you removed. Follow these instructions to place it inside
TiVo, connect the cables, and fasten it down.
1. Attach the new drive to the old drive’s bracket.
Use the Torx wrench and the old drive’s screws to fasten the new drive
to the old drive’s bracket. The holes on the new drive match perfectly
with the holes in the bracket. Whoopee!
The drive’s Master, Cable Select and/or Slave jumpers are already set to
the proper positions for each upgrade kit. Don’t try to second guess
anybody by switching the jumpers.
2. Plug in all the cables.
Carefully reattach the drive’s IDE cable; it only fits one way. (The little
notch on the cable’s connector lines up with the hole on the drive’s
connector.)
Push the power cable’s connector back into the drive, as well. (Like the
IDE cable’s connector, the power cable’s connector only fits one way.) It
sometimes requires a healthy push.
3. Reattach the drive bracket to TiVo.
If you removed the drive’s bracket from TiVo, use the Torx wrenches to
fasten its screws back onto TiVo’s chassis.
Reattach any other items you removed according to your kit’s instructions.
If your TiVo has a fan, be sure to push the cables away from the fan so
they don’t get stuck. 
226
Part IV: Upgrading and Fixing Your TiVo 

Replacing TiVo’s Case
Before screwing down TiVo’s case, make sure you haven’t left any stray
screws inside TiVo. Give it a shake or two to see if you hear anything rattling
around. Are all the cables tight? If you accidentally knocked any other con-
nectors askew, carefully push them back in place.
Everything look good? Then go ahead and reattach TiVo’s cover. It slides on
easier than it came off, thankfully.
1. Slide TiVo’s case back over the chassis.
The case slides on just the way you slid it off, but usually without as
much pushing. Make sure the cover’s lip sits flush against the chassis,
with the holes lining up.
2. Reattach the screws.
Using the Torx wrench, reattach the cover using the screws you
removed earlier. Tighten them firmly, but don’t bear down on them.
They usually stay put.
Making Sure TiVo Works
Now comes the moment of truth — to see if the darn thing still works. Feel
free to head to Chapter 3 if you have trouble remembering which cable con-
nected to which port.
1. Reattach TiVo’s cables.
Always route the cables from one gadget’s Out port to another one’s In
port. Never connect them from In to In or Out to Out.
2. Plug in TiVo’s power cord and turn on your TV.
Plugging in the power turns on TiVo automatically. You’ll see the
“Powering Up” screen, followed by the “Almost There . . . ” screen.
Eventually TiVo’s familiar menu will reappear on your TV screen.
3. Run TiVo’s Guided Setup and enter your settings.
I cover Guided Setup in Chapter 4. If you wrote down all your Season
Passes and WishLists before replacing your hard drive, now’s the time
to enter them all back in.

4. View TiVo’s upgraded storage capacity.
To see the results of your handiwork, head to TiVo’s Video Recording
Quality settings:
1. From TiVo Central, choose TiVo messages and Setup.
2. Choose Settings.
3. Choose Preferences, then Video Recording Quality.
TiVo displays the screen shown in Figure 12-5 showing the approxi-
mate number of hours your newly expanded TiVo will be able to
record.
If something seems wrong or TiVo won’t load properly, fire off an e-mail
to the upgrade kit vendor. Describe your problems in minute detail,
including any error messages you see, so they’ll be able to identify the
problem and its solution.

eneath all its magic, TiVo is simply a computer. With such a heritage,
it’s only natural that the Internet brims with Web sites devoted to TiVo.
This chapter describes some of the most popular sites available, as well as
the information they offer.
Once you’ve visited one or two sites, you’ll quickly spot links to other sites
offering similar fare.
Because Web sites change location often, you’ll find a complete list of
updated links at my Web site (www.andyrathbone.com).
TiVo’s Own Web Site
TiVo’s own Web site (www.tivo.com) contains a remarkable amount of infor-
mation. Here’s the rundown on what information TiVo offers at its site, seen in
Figure 13-1, as well as shortcuts that take you directly to the page you need.

www.tivo.com: When friends ask what TiVo’s all about, point them to TiVo’s
Web site for an animated explanation of the TiVo lifestyle they’re currently
missing. (Even better, invite them over and hand them your remote for a few
minutes.)
www.tivo.com/manage: Head here to Activate your newly purchased TiVo (if
you didn’t Activate through the TiVo itself). You’ll need to enter a user name
and password, or set up a new account.
You’ll also visit here to purchase TiVo’s Home Media Option (HMO), name
your TiVo (important when swapping shows between two or more TiVos with
HMO), or update your TiVo account information.
When you move or change e-mail addresses, be sure to keep TiVo up-to-date
on your whereabouts — especially if you’re paying for monthly service.
www.tivo.com/support: If TiVo ever leaves you scratching your head, this
site offers extensive customer support, tailored for your particular TiVo

model. You’ll also find troubleshooting tips, an e-mail address to ask ques-
tions, and a handy list of answers to the most frequently asked questions
about TiVo.
www.tivo.com/desktop: When you sign up for TiVo’s Home Media Option
(HMO), head here to download the TiVo Desktop application for your PC or
Macintosh. You need that software to send your digital photos and/or MP3
music files from your computer to TiVo. (I describe other programs that con-
trol TiVo through HMO in Chapter 10.)
www.tivo.com/tco: Once you’ve signed up for TiVo’s Home Media Option,
visit here to schedule recordings on your TiVo from any Internet connection.
If you’ve set up TiVo through a broadband connection, you can schedule a
recording with only half an hour’s advance notice.
www.tivo.com/adapters: TiVo’s happy to connect with your computer
through the Home Media Option, but it’s quite picky about the network
adapters that make the connection possible. This site lists the USB network
adapters proven to work with TiVo. (Although other brands of adapters may
work, the ones listed here provide the best chance of success.)
www.tivo.com/guides: This area contains downloadable manuals for every
TiVo manufacturer and model. You’ll also find a downloadable manual for
TiVo’s Home Media Option.
https://store.tivo.com: This site lets you purchase nearly anything TiVo
offers: new TiVos, professional installations, TiVo antenna balls, stuffed TiVo
toys, and other items.
www.tivo.com/mediapartners: Several companies sell products and ser-
vices that work with TiVo’s Home Media Option. You’ll find many of them
listed here, as well as discussed in Chapter 10.
www.tivo.com/privacy: TiVo spells out its privacy policies in complete
detail here, as well as its terms of service. The downloadable documents
come in Adobe Acrobat format; if you have difficulty opening them, head to
www.adobe.com/reader to download free “Adobe Acrobat Reader” software.
www.zap2it.com: TiVo receives its program information from a company
called Tribune Media Services. If anything is wrong with the schedule data,
the TiVo company must make Tribune correct their listings. This Web site

www.linksys.com/support: Although not a link to TiVo, this site contains
detailed information about setting up a home network, as well as information
on some network adapters (wired and wireless) that work with TiVo.
www.uk.tivo.com: TiVo sells units and provides service only in the United
States and United Kingdom. United Kingdom customers find TiVo support at
this site.
www.directv.com/dvr: DirecTV customers use TiVos from DirecTV
designed specifically to record satellite streams. DirecTV offers customer
support through its Web site, e-mail , or by phone at 1-800-DIRECTV
(1-800-347-3288).
Web Links to TiVo Fan Sites
Many of TiVo’s more than one-million users lean toward the fanatical. Some
set up Web sites devoted to discussing TiVo, its use, or even its implications
for the world. Some sites remain tightly focused around TiVo specifics; others
border on standard water cooler chatter. Either way, you’ll find plenty of TiVo
information at the sites listed here.
TiVo Community Forum
Partially supported by the TiVo company and other TiVo-related companies,
the TiVo Community Forum (www.tivocommunity.com) easily ranks as the
largest TiVo “fan” site. Seen in Figure 13-2, the site encompasses a wide vari-
ety of issues, from tips on removing bird poop from new car paint to last-
minute alerts on networks that change their program lineups.
New users ask questions about their TiVo in the “TiVo Help Center” forum;
TiVo tinkerers hang out in the “Underground” forum, exploring ways to push
TiVo to its limits.
The only thing you won’t find here is talk about the “forbidden” subjects: any
type of service theft, video extraction, or hacks to remove ads from TiVo soft-
ware. (Don’t talk about TiVo’s stock, either.) It’s a moderated, family forum,
so any posts deemed inappropriate for family viewing may be removed with-
out notice.

TiVo FAQ (www.tivofaq.com)
Still have a question about your TiVo or its service? The TiVo Frequently

who constantly hear the same questions asked over and over again.
PVR Blog (www.pvrblog.com)
Dutifully run by Matt Haughey, the PVR Blog (www.pvrblog.com) comments

TiVo Hacking Sites
These sites deal with “white hat” hacking — ways to tinker with TiVo to add
features while staying within the law. Most of these modifications won’t stay
within your TiVo’s warranty, however. Although you probably won’t care
much about these sites, feel free to pass them on to a curious friend as a
starting point. Once you visit one or two sites, you’ll find links to other sites
with similar information.
The Unofficial TiVo Hackers site
Another site running under the wing of the TiVo Community Forum, the
Unofficial TiVo Hackers site (www.tivofaq.com/hack) offers a primer on
what sort of smarts you need to dig into your TiVo’s guts, and why you’d
want to in the first place.

Links to Upgrade Kit Vendors
Several sites offer upgrades to TiVo — parts replacements, hard drive
upgrades, and similar goods. Visit all three companies and choose the one
that matches your needs most closely.
WeaKnees
I’ve installed two hard drive upgrade kits from WeaKnees (www.weaknees.

hitch. The company includes detailed directions and tools with each kit. And
if you spill coffee on the directions, simply download another copy from its
Web site, seen in Figure 13-5.
A “TiVo Wizard” on the site guides you to the correct kit or parts you’ll need
for your TiVo. The site sells new TiVos online, as well.

remote control cars, and other items with geek appeal.
PTVupgrade
Seen in Figure 13-6, PTVupgrade (www.ptvupgrade.com) sells items similar to
those found at WeaKnees and 9th Tee Enterprises: upgrade kits, TiVo parts,
and items designed for TiVo hackers. Based in Chicago, the company’s been in

 Toggling between two live shows
B
y now, you’re probably familiar with TiVo’s standard bag of live TV
tricks. Pause, Rewind, Instant Replay, and Slow Motion place a powerful
arsenal at your fingertips.
This chapter presents a few lesser-known tricks that apply mostly when
watching live TV. Some take advantage of TiVo’s handy recording buffer (cov-
ered in Chapter 5). The first and most important tip, however, helps keep you
from watching live TV at all. Only when you give up live TV will you experi-
ence TiVo in its purest form.
Keeping Away from Live TV
Although TiVo enhances live TV in several ways, TiVo’s not meant for watch-
ing live TV.
After growing accustomed to commercial skipping and a diet of shows you’ve
specifically requested, live TV will make you feel oddly uncomfortable, both
at home and away. Live TV robs you of control, leaving you stuck with what-
ever the TV currently offers.

If you’re having trouble weaning yourself from live TV, try these three tips:
1. Before turning on your TV, press the TiVo button twice.
When you turn on your TV, TiVo’s Now Playing list replaces the live TV
screen. That stops you from being sucked into a live TV show, and it lets
you grow accustomed to TiVo and its offerings.
2. Take some time to teach TiVo what you like.
Make WishLists for your favorite actors, directors, and subjects, and put
your absolute favorites on autorecord. Additional tips for filling TiVo
with shows tailored to your tastes await you in Chapter 16, as well.
3. If you find yourself enjoying a live TV show, tell TiVo about it.
Don’t just press the Thumbs Up button; press the Pause button. Then
create a Season Pass or autorecording WishList for that show. TiVo will
automatically grab the show when it airs, and you’ll never have to watch
it live again. Lather, rinse, and repeat when necessary for other shows.
Recording Live Shows On-the-Fly
Spotted something irresistible when you first turned on the TV? Push the
Record button: TiVo quickly saves the show’s past 30 minutes, then records
the rest of the show to its completion.
How can TiVo retrieve 30 minutes of a show’s previously aired footage? It’s
possible because TiVo constantly records whatever channel it happens to be
tuned to, usually something on the last channel it recorded. TiVo places its
constant recordings into a buffer — a temporary holding tank that’s 30 min-
utes long.
So, when you press Record, TiVo reaches into its buffer, grabs up to 30 min-
utes of the current show, and tacks that portion to the beginning of your
recording. (If TiVo finds part of an earlier show in the 30 minute buffer, it dis-
cards that earlier show, saving only the current one.)
There’s one catch, however. If you change channels, TiVo erases its buffer
and begins recording anew. If you press the Record button while channel surf-
ing, TiVo’s buffer probably won’t have much of the show’s recently aired fare
to dish out.
242
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Recording a Short Portion of a Live Show
Sometimes you’ll be watching a live show and only want to record part of
it — the musical guest’s appearance on David Letterman, for instance.
When you press the Record button, TiVo normally scoops up to 30 minutes
of the show from its buffer and tacks it onto the beginning of the recording.
While this is generally a good thing, TiVo’s buffer dipping can turn a quick
three-minute recording of Outkast’s performance into a 33-minute recording
stuffed with a monologue.
To avoid this, flush TiVo’s buffer by quickly changing channels at the right
time: Just before the musical guests appear, press the Channel Up button fol-
lowed by the Channel Down button. When TiVo returns to your show, press
the Record button.
With its buffer cleared, TiVo begins recording from that point onward. Press
the Record button again to stop the recording, and your intentionally brief
recording will remain brief.
Cutting Commercials from Live TV
Sometimes you’ll set up TiVo to record a show, but you still want to watch the
show live. For instance, to watch an 8 p.m. show “live” and still be able to fast-
forward through the commercials, wait until 8:20 p.m. Then start watching
TiVo’s recording of the show from the beginning.
That lets you fast-forward through the show’s commercials, usually catching
up to the recording’s end at the same time as the show’s “real” ending.
By fast-forwarding through the commercials, TiVo gives you twenty minutes
of your life back!
Returning to a Paused Show
TiVo takes the Pause button to a new dimension with its ability to keep on
recording while the screen freezes. But when you return to a paused show —
either live or recorded — it’s easy to forget where you left off.
243
Chapter 14: Tips for Watching Live TV

To refresh your memory, press Instant Replay to hear the last line or two.
Press the Instant Replay button several times if you’re returning after a
lengthy delay; each press jumps back another eight seconds.
Recording Digital Cable Music Stations
Some cable and satellite services broadcast commercial-free digital music chan-
nels. But if you’re listening to a music channel when TiVo suddenly needs to
record a program, TiVo flips the channel, cutting off your tunes in the process.
Sometimes TiVo cuts off the music simply to record a Suggestion — committing
a real party foul in the process.
You can fix this any one of five ways:
 Subscribe to DirecTV satellite TV, because DirecTV lets you record one
channel while watching another live. (A DirecTV TiVo comes with the
deal for a small monthly fee.) Listen to your cable music station while
recording TV in the background.
 If the music comes through a digital channel, buy a second cable/satel-
lite box. Devote one box to TiVo, and use the second for live TV, includ-
ing playing your music channels. (Place TiVo’s dedicated box inside a
“tent,” described in Chapter 11.)
 If a second cable box isn’t an option, use TiVo’s manual recording
option: Tell TiVo to record several hours of your favorite station once a
week while you’re asleep. To listen to your music, just play back your
weekly recording. (DirecTV’s TiVos won’t let you record MusicChoice
channels, unfortunately.)
 Buy TiVo’s Home Media Option and listen to Internet Radio or your MP3
music files, instead. (I cover the Home Media Option in Part III.) TiVo
flips its channels and records in the background while you listen to unin-
terrupted Internet Radio or MP3 files.
 You might also look into TiVo’s partnership with XM Radio. Home Media
Option users can tune in to their subscribed XM Satellite Radio stations
through a Series 2 TiVo.
Toggling between Two Live Shows
Can’t decide which live show to watch? Tune in the first show you want to
watch, and then enter the second channel with the remote’s keypad.
244
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Press the Enter/Last key to flip from one channel to the other, letting you
keep up on the action of both.
If you’re using a DirecTV TiVo, tune in the first show, then tune in the second
show on the second tuner. Press the Down Arrow to move between tuners,
flipping between the two shows.

 Repeating missed dialogue
 Playing or deleting saved shows quickly
 Saving recorded shows to a VCR
O
nce TiVo has started recording your favorite shows, you’ll spend much
of your TV time watching TiVo, not your TV.
This collection of tips comes in handy when watching recorded shows, rather
than live programming. Some help TiVo users deal with the guilt felt when
they see shows scrolling off TiVo’s Now Playing list, unwatched. If you don’t
want to lose any shows, another tip offers a refresher on how to save shows
to a VCR.
You’ll also find one of the most coveted tips of all: Activating TiVo’s secret 30-
second skip ahead feature for conveniently bypassing a commercial at the
press of a button.
Letting Shows Scroll Off Naturally
Don’t feel guilty when TiVo deletes older shows before you have a chance to
watch them. They’re supposed to scroll off. You’re noticing their loss only
because TiVo pointed them out.
Instead of juggling your recordings and constantly adjusting your save times,
learn to let go. You missed plenty of shows before TiVo arrived, and you lived!

Besides, everything repeats, given enough time. Don’t delete your WishList and
that show will turn up again, perhaps when you have more time to watch it.
In the meantime, TiVo will continue to retrieve fresh, new shows to lessen
your feeling of loss.
Fast-Forwarding 30 Seconds at a Time
Television networks are understandably squeamish about the way DVRs let
users fast-forward through commercials. One of TiVo’s competitors even
unveiled a way to skip commercials completely and automatically. The net-
works panicked, sent in their lawyers, and the competitor removed the fea-
ture from its newer models.
The TiVo corporation took a much less combative stance; it doesn’t advertise
the fact that TiVo, too, allows users to skip commercials — not automatically
but by skipping ahead in 30-second increments. Although the 30-second jump
is neither officially supported by TiVo nor covered in its manuals, here’s how
to activate this hidden feature and begin using it:
 While watching a recorded show, press these keys in the following
sequence:
If TiVo’s sound effects are turned on, TiVo will make three “ding” sounds
to show that you’ve activated the feature. (Unless you’ve turned off
TiVo’s sound effects, of course, in which case you won’t hear anything.)
When a commercial begins, quickly press the Skip-to-End (Advance)
button to jump 30 seconds ahead; repeat until you’ve skipped past the
commercials and your show begins.
 The feature disappears if TiVo loses power or resets itself. Reenter the
code sequence to turn it back on.
 To turn off the 30-second skip and return normal function to your Skip-
to-End button, reenter the key sequence.
 Personally, I prefer fast-forwarding through commercials, because it
gives me more control over the timing. I don’t use the 30-second skip
feature, but you might want to give it a go.
 Toshiba’s combo TiVo/DVD player (SD-H400) doesn’t support the 
30-second skip feature as of this writing. As a matter of fact, because
TiVo doesn’t officially support the 30-second skip feature, it could be
discontinued at any time.

Repeating Missed Dialogue
The eight-second Rewind button comes in handy to catch up on the action
when you return to a paused show. But I use it even more often to repeat
missed lines of dialogue. It jumps back eight seconds each time you push it,
letting you repeat entire conversations — quite handy when unraveling con-
voluted mysteries like Spielberg’s Minority Report.
Creative Uses for Closed Captioning
The Fast-Forward button’s a quick way to speed through boring segments of
a show, whisking you past the opening monologue or through awful comedy
segments of “Saturday Night Live.” But your television’s Closed Captioning
feature adds another quick way to breeze through some shows.
Most TVs support Closed Captioning — usually turned on with a “CC” button
on the TV’s remote — that places a moving transcript of the show on the
screen. Designed mainly for the hearing-impaired, Closed Captioning pro-
vides a way to understand the show without hearing the actual dialogue.
TiVo passes a show’s Closed Captioning information through to your TV, and
turning it on provides interesting features like these:
 To speed through talk shows or news programs, turn on your televi-
sion’s Closed Captioning and press TiVo’s Fast-Forward button once.
(Pressing more than once won’t work.) TiVo plays back the show more
quickly, yet you can still read the dialogue. By speeding up playback
(and fast-forwarding through commercials), you can watch two talk
shows in the space of one.
 If you can’t figure out what somebody said during a pivotal point of a
movie, turn on Closed Captioning and do an Instant Replay to read the
mumbled lines. Turn it back off when through, if desired. This tip’s
essential for Californians trying to decipher mumbled Sopranos dialogue,
for instance. 
Playing or Deleting Saved Shows Quickly
TiVo lets you play or delete any show on your long list of saved shows fairly
quickly. When you press Select, TiVo displays the show’s description; you
choose to delete or play the shows from there.
249
Chapter 15: Tips for Watching Recorded TV

But to play a show directly from the Now Playing list, simply highlight its name
and press Play instead of Select. TiVo immediately begins playing the show.
Similarly, highlight a show’s name and press Clear instead of Select to delete
it. (TiVo still tosses you an “Are you sure?” screen, to weed out the chance of
the cat stepping on the remote’s Clear button.)
Saving Recorded Shows to a VCR
Most folks ignore their VCR after TiVo, because it seems so awkward.
But if you absolutely must complete your Dawson’s Creek library or tape a
show for a friend, TiVo’s “Save to VCR” option speeds things up a little.
Chapter 6 covers it in full, but here are the steps for quick reference:
1. Place a blank, rewound tape into your VCR.
2. From TiVo’s Now Playing menu, select your show.
3. Select Save to VCR, and choose Start saving from the beginning.
4. Press the VCR’s Record button, and take a break.
5. Press the VCR’s Stop button when the show’s through recording.
Press the TiVo button twice to cancel, a tip that comes in handy for recording
just part of a show. A little juggling of the TiVo’s Play button and the VCR’s
Record button lets you perform crude edits, as well.
If your VCR has a “One Touch Record” button that records in 30-minute incre-
ments, use it so your VCR stops recording automatically.
Feel free to hook up a DVD recorder, instead of a VCR — TiVo doesn’t know
the difference.
Finally, check out “TiVoToGo,” a new option for TiVo slated for late 2004 that
lets you send shows to your PC for watching or recording. See TiVo’s Web site
(www.tivo.com) for details.

W
hen TiVo records enjoyable shows, you find yourself enjoying TiVo.
This collection of tips helps make sure your TiVo’s stocked with
shows that meet your current interests, no matter how eclectic they may be. 
You’ll find yourself using these tips over and over again when setting up
recordings on TiVo.
Finding Interesting Shows to Record
Cut down on your movie rental tab by using TiVo as your customized movie
grabber. Use these tips to fill TiVo with movies both you and your friends
will enjoy:
 To find upcoming movies, press the TiVo button and the number 4 to
jump to TiVo’s Search by Title screen. Choose Search by name, highlight
Movies, and select your favorite type of movie from the subcategory —
Westerns, for instance. Instead of typing in a specific title, press 0 on the
remote. TiVo lists all movies in that category airing in the next two
weeks. Select and record the ones you like.

 Missed a movie during its theater run? Create an autorecording WishList
with the movie’s name to catch it during its TV run. (The movie arrives
much more quickly if you subscribe to “premium” cable channels like
HBO, Cinemax, or Starz.) TiVo can’t order a “Pay Per View” movie, but a
WishList will locate a title when it’s finally available for purchase.
 Check out the Internet’s lists of best movies, and enter some movie titles
as autorecording WishLists. You’ll find “Best Movies” lists online at
Amazon (www.amazon.com), The Greatest Films (www.filmsite.org),
and the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com), among others.
 Visit your WishList items once a week or so. Unless set for Autorecord,
TiVo doesn’t automatically record what you’ve entered. In fact, it doesn’t
even tell you when a match pops up. To see what items are available,
head for the WishList area and choose View all upcoming WishList pro-
grams. TiVo displays all the current matches, letting you pick and
choose what to record.
Making Sure TiVo Doesn’t Miss the Very
End (Or Beginning) of Your Shows
When recording shows, TiVo relies on the start and stop times supplied by
the networks. Unfortunately, even the networks sometimes take a wild stab at
estimating a show’s actual ending time.
Specifically, be sure to add an extra hour or so to sporting events, awards
shows, and other programs that traditionally run long. If you notice that one
particular channel doesn’t adhere to its listed start/stop times, feel free to
pad its beginning and ending times by a few minutes to make up for it.
You can add a few minutes or even hours by choosing Options when schedul-
ing a recording. When in doubt, pad a recording by a few minutes on each
end. If the few extra minutes keep TiVo from recording adjacent shows, you
may need to set up a manual recording of a particular channel at a particular
time.
Automatically Recording TV Premieres
TiVo can’t grab shows from the past, but you can hedge your bets. To make
sure you don’t miss the first episode of that hot new series creating such a
media buzz, create an Autorecording WishList for the words “Pilot” or
“Premiere” and set to “First Run Only.”
252
Part V: The Part of Tens 

When water cooler chatter revolves around TV’s latest can’t-miss show, TiVo
will have it waiting for you at home. If nobody mentions the show or if it’s
just another dumb bug-eating reality show, delete it or let it die a natural
death by scrolling off your list.
Avoiding Overflows from 
TV Show Marathons
Although Autorecording WishLists come in very handy, they can be danger-
ous to your storage space, too. If a station runs a 24-hour “Audrey Hepburn”
marathon, your Autorecording WishList for the slender gal could push all of
your other shows right off your list.
When creating an Autorecording WishList, don’t set the “Keep at most” level to
more than one or two shows unless you have a good reason. Even then, drop
by your WishList and To Do areas to see what shows TiVo will be grabbing.
 TiVo’s To Do list lives at the bottom of the Pick Programs to Record
menu, and it lists all upcoming recordings.
 To view all your WishList items, choose View all upcoming WishList pro-
grams from your Create new WishList menu.
Navigating Menus More Quickly
When maneuvering through menus, try using the Channel Up/Down button as
a Page Up/Down button. When looking at a list of show descriptions, for
instance, pressing Channel Down brings up the next show on the list.
Check out the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book for more shortcut keys
that quickly jump between menus.
Recording Movies or Shows 
with Forgotten Names
Can’t remember the name of a particular show or movie but want TiVo to
record it? If you can remember the show’s actors or characters — or even
part of the show’s title — use the WishLists’ “keyword” feature.
253
Chapter 16: Tips for Recording Shows

Enter in a few words with the actors’ names, characters, or any of the words
in the title you remember. Choose “View upcoming shows” to see if you can
spot it, or simply set it on Autorecord so TiVo will automatically record the
show when it airs. 
Setting Up TiVo for Vacations
Once you’ve decided on a vacation destination, let TiVo help with your travel
plans. Start by adding your vacation destination to the WishList, so TiVo will
grab any shows relating to that particular place.
Take care of this TiVo maintenance before leaving:
 Check TiVo’s To Do list, found at the bottom of the Pick Programs to
Record option, to see your list of upcoming recordings. You may want to
adjust the “Keep at Most” for some favorite shows and delete less popu-
lar shows to make sure there’s enough room.
 Visit your Season Pass Manager and change the order of your Season
Pass recordings. Make sure you list your favorites at the top so TiVo
gives them the most attention.
 Find out the favorite shows of your housesitter, if you’ll be using one,
and add them to TiVo’s record list. (That helps ensure your housesitter
will actually be sitting at your house while you’re gone.)
Recording Sports Events
Sporting events require special care when setting up for two reasons. They
usually run longer than the scheduled time, causing TiVo to cut off the
ending. Second, because the name of the show often changes depending on
the venue, a Season Pass doesn’t work well.
To fix the first problem, be sure to “pad” the show’s ending time by an hour
or so. Described in Chapter 6, this lets you tell TiVo to stop recording after
the show’s scheduled ending, as insurance against overtime.
As for the second problem, create an Autorecording WishList to catch your
favorite sporting teams. When setting up the WishList, use your team’s name
in the Title. To further filter the results, choose sports in the Category area,
and set the Subcategory to the type of sporting event you’re after.
254
Part V: The Part of Tens 

To catch all San Diego Chargers games, for instance, I’d create an
Autorecording WishList that automatically recorded shows with “Chargers”
in the title with the category of “Sports” and the subcategory of “Football.”
To test your WishList, choose the View Upcoming Shows option. You might
want to change Chargers to “Chargers at,” for instance, using the Pause
button to create the quote marks. Check your WishList every week or so
to see if it needs tweaking.

Tips for Sharing TiVo with 
Family or Roommates
In This Chapter
 Sharing TiVo with a roommate

L
ike a new carton of ice cream, TiVo instantly becomes a coveted item in
any household. And just as the ice cream mysteriously disappears,
spoonful by spoonful, TiVo’s storage space vanishes — especially when
family members or roommates don’t share similar viewing interests.
To keep peace in the household, this chapter offers some tips on using TiVo
in a family or similar shared setting. A few tips help conserve storage space;
others transform TiVo from a toy to a learning tool for children.
Sharing TiVo with a Roommate
A roommate with a TiVo requires special treatment. To keep that roommate
for as long as possible, immediately offer to pay TiVo’s monthly fee, or offer
to discount that amount on the rent. After all, they’ve made quite an invest-
ment in bringing TiVo to the household. (If you’re paying the monthly fee,
they won’t be allowed to keep their TiVo in their room, hogging it for
themselves.)

Some landlords, especially in larger cities, toss in a TiVo as part of the rental
package. When sharing a landlord’s TiVo, try to schedule shows when your
roommate’s around, so nobody can be considered a space hog. Barter chores
to settle the order of shows in Season Pass lineups.
If you want to record a show that repeats fairly often, place it lower on the
Season Pass list than shows that don’t repeat. That lets TiVo grab the shows
that don’t repeat and then fill in its recording schedule with the shows that
do repeat. (You can tell if a show repeats a lot by eyeballing TiVo’s “View
Upcoming Shows” menu option when choosing to record a show.)
Also, keep an eye on TiVo’s To Do list (see Chapter 6) to make sure a room-
mate’s autorecording WishList isn’t catching any marathons sure to fill up
your TiVo with South Park episodes.
Finally, if one of your recorded shows mysteriously disappears, a visit to
TiVo’s View Recording History option (discussed in Chapter 6) shows the
time and date that somebody deleted it — or whether TiVo simply deleted it
to make room for incoming shows. It’s a good way to avoid arguments.
 You may be tempted to add a second hard drive to a roommate’s TiVo to
double its storage. Although this seems logical, the drive can’t be
removed after installation. TiVo’s original and second drive “merge.” If
you move out, you can’t simply remove your second drive and take it
with you unless you know advanced Linux computing techniques.
 TiVo’s Home Media Option (HMO, covered in Part III) lets you transfer
shows between two TiVos, which sounds nice when you and your room-
mate have TiVos in separate rooms. In reality, this isn’t so nice: You can
only transfer shows between TiVos registered under your own name.
You can’t move them between TiVos with different owners.
 When several people in the household record their own shows on TiVo,
TiVo’s Suggestions become a mishmash that rarely appeals to every-
body. Leave them turned on, however, simply as a gauge of available
free space.
Saving Space When Recording 
Long Shows
In families or households, TiVo recording space often carries a premium. This
trick keeps a particularly long show from hogging TiVo’s hard drive.
258
Part V: The Part of Tens 

When recording programs that last several hours — sporting events, long
movies, awards shows, and others — don’t record the entire show with a
single scheduled recording. Instead, use TiVo’s manual recording option, and
record the show’s timeslot in several successive one-block chunks.
For instance, if you want to record the five-hour Gone With The Wind, which
runs from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., set up five one-hour manual recordings for the
time and channel running the movie. Schedule the first block to record from
5 p.m. to 6 p.m. The second should record from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. Keep going
until you’ve set up five one hour blocks that cover the movie’s air time.
Then, when you’re finished watching the movie’s first hour, delete the first
one-hour block. Repeat with the rest of the blocks until you’ve finished the
entire show.
When you record and delete the program in successive one-hour chunks,
TiVo won’t hog the entire five-hour chunk of space during the days it takes
you to watch the entire movie.
Buy a Second Remote
When more than one person uses a TiVo, the remote often ends up in some
pretty strange places. If you’re having trouble locating where the last person
left the remote, feel free to buy a second one and hide it in a special spot for
your own use.
TiVo sells additional remotes at its online store (https://store.tivo.com).
They even come in different colors so you can tell when somebody’s walking
away with your personal remote.
Setting Parental Controls Appropriately
TiVo’s Parental Controls, described in Chapter 7, can “lock out” adult pro-
gramming and other channels you don’t want your children or visitors to
watch. If you think you might need them, remember to turn them on before
it’s too late.
But even if you don’t subscribe to adult programming, Parental Controls can
be useful for keeping the kids from wasting time in front of the TV set. Simply
lock out every channel except for educational channels. (If it simply drives
the kids over to their friends’ houses, change it back. At least you tried.)
259
Chapter 17: Tips for Sharing TiVo with Family or Roommates

Even if you don’t use Parental Controls at all, be sure to set a password
anyway, and allow access to all your channels. That keeps a sneaky kid,
prankster, or fumbling visitor from setting their own password, effectively
locking you out of your TiVo. (If they do, call TiVo’s Customer Support, explain
the situation, and convince them that you’re the TiVo’s real owner. DirecTV
TiVo owners facing that situation need to grovel before DirecTV, not TiVo.)
Scheduling Children’s Shows
Many children enjoy animated shows, and they’re not as picky about a
show’s recording quality. When setting up recordings for animated shows,
save hard disk space by setting the recording quality to Basic. (Large TV
owners may want to bump the quality to Medium.)
To ensure the kids experience the best that TV has to offer, take the time to
create Season Passes for some educational programs. You’ll find plenty by
setting the Category to Educational when looking for shows to record. TiVo
will list upcoming educational shows, letting you choose Season Passes
accordingly.
Some cable networks devote all of their programming to educational fare; try
the Discovery channels or National Geographic specials, for starters.
Adding Current Schoolwork to WishLists
When the kids study American history, frog dissection, or other subjects in
school, add those subjects as keywords for a WishList. TiVo will pluck perti-
nent educational shows from your flow of channels, ready for your child to
watch when taking a break from the pencil and paper.
Delete the Season Passes or WishLists when the homework assignment
ends — or leave them turned on, if they’ve sparked a new interest.
Hiding the Remote from 
Children and Guests
Because TiVo’s always turned on, it never stops listening to the remote. Hide
the remote from young children, animals, and guests, or they may play with the
remote. A few haphazard key presses usually won’t delete shows, but they
could change TiVo’s settings or assign random Thumbs ratings to shows.
260
Part V: The Part of Tens 

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, be sure to set your own password in the
Parental Controls area — even if you don’t intend to use that feature. That
keeps somebody from accidentally setting a password, effectively locking you
out of your TiVo.

O
ccasionally, TiVo interrupts your customary diet of menus and recorded
shows. Sometimes, TiVo gives you a gentle attention-getting nudge with
a strange icon; other times, TiVo throws a startling, in-your-face intrusion
onto your currently watched program.
In either case, TiVo’s error messages require your immediate attention. This
chapter presents the screen you’ll see on TiVo, an explanation of what TiVo’s
trying to say, and the solution that makes TiVo — and you — happy.

The Show Is Currently Being Recorded . . .
Translation: You’re watching a live show that you’ve also told TiVo to record.
But you’ve suddenly pressed the remote to tell TiVo to change channels, and
that would stop TiVo from recording that particular show. (See Figure 18-1.)
Solution: Your best solution is to press the TiVo button twice and watch a
recorded show, instead. TiVo will continue to record the live show in the
background. When TiVo’s through recording it, watch that show’s recording.
(You should also try to watch less live TV, avoiding these disturbing screens
in the future.)

The TiVo DVR Needs to 
Change the Channel . . .
Translation: You’re watching live TV, but TiVo needs to change the channel
to record a previously scheduled show. (See Figure 18-2.)
Solution: Stop watching that live TV show and let TiVo change the channel.
Then, set up a Season Pass that will catch that show in the future.
If you’re incredibly engrossed in the live show, however, tell TiVo to cancel
your previously scheduled recording. Then you may continue to watch the
live show.

Chapter 18: Ten Warning Screens and Their Cures

The Recorder Is Not Getting 
a Video Signal
Translation: TiVo isn’t receiving any video from your TV provider. (See Figure
18-3.)
Solution: Make sure your cable or satellite box is turned on. If you have
another TV, check to see if it’s receiving a signal; your cable or satellite ser-
vice may be experiencing an outage.
Check your video cables, as well. Plugging the yellow RCA cable back into
TiVo’s Video In jack may fix the problem. (The cable’s other end should con-
nect to the Video Out jack of your cable or satellite box.)
If everything seems okay, try restarting TiVo by doing this:
1. Choose TiVo Messages & Setup from TiVo Central.
2. Select Restart or Reset System.
3. Select Restart the Recorder.

Translation: TiVo can’t see anything from your TV provider. (See Figure 18-4.)
Solution: Although TiVo lists several solutions on this screen, start by making
sure the cable/satellite box is both plugged in and turned on.
Please Activate Service
Translation: You’re not yet paying your monthly fees to TiVo. (See Figure
18-5.)
Solution: Activate your TiVo either through TiVo itself, online
(www.tivo.com), or by calling TiVo’s customer service department. A credit
card number chases away the nagging screens.

A Problem Occurred While 
Accessing the Server
Translation: Seen only by people accessing their computer through TiVo’s
Home Media Option, this means TiVo suddenly can’t talk with your computer.
(See Figure 18-6.)
Solution: Reboot your computer. Then make sure you’ve published files with
the “TiVo Desktop” software (covered in Chapter 9), and make sure TiVo’s
networking adapter is plugged in.
Read New TiVo Messages and Setup
Translation: TiVo sent you a message describing an event that it wants you
to read about. (See Figure 18-7.)
Solution: Select the “You have a message waiting” notice to read the mes-
sage, then choose to either save or delete the message.

Press Thumbs Up to Record
Translation: Usually used as a form of advertising, this message appears
onscreen to make it easy for you to record the advertised show by simply
pressing the Thumbs Up button. (See Figure 18-8.)
Solution: Press Thumbs Up to record the show; if you don’t want to record
the show, ignore the message, and it will eventually go away.
Error Code: Error #32
Translation: Usually seen when you’re searching for shows, this means TiVo’s
having trouble finding the show information. (See Figure 18-9.)
Solution: Ignore this rarely seen message. TiVo may not have finished com-
pletely indexing your shows. If the message continues, tell TiVo to reload its
Program Data by doing this:
Figure 18-8:
Press the

270
Part V: The Part of Tens 

1. Choose Messages & Setup from TiVo Central.
2. Choose System Reset.
3. Choose Clear Program Data & To Do List.
Black Screen
Translation: Although TiVo thinks it’s successfully recording a show, that
show isn’t being fed to TiVo through your cable or satellite box. (See
Figure 18-10.)
Solution: TiVo occasionally presents a black screen instead of a recorded
show. Because TiVo recorded a black screen — and didn’t present an error
message complaining of no video signal — it most likely means you’ve sched-
uled a recording on a channel that you don’t receive.
To test it, press the Live TV button and tune to the channel TiVo was sup-
posed to record. If it’s black — but other live channels come through fine —
then you don’t receive that channel from your TV provider. Head to Chapter
7’s “Weeding out unwanted channels . . .” section and remove that channel
from your list.

nspired by raves about TiVo, many cable and satellite companies now
offer their customers digital video recorders (DVRs) for recording TV pro-
grams. Most cost about the same amount as renting a cable box or satellite.
They’re much less expensive than TiVo.
In my own experience with a generic DVR, the old adage “you get what you
pay for” really rings true. This chapter lists the biggest differences I found
between TiVo and the generic DVR my cable company offered, a Scientific
Atlanta 8000 from Cox Communications. TiVo outperformed the DVR in every
way.
Scientific Atlanta’s DVR will almost certainly improve; the box is using its first
generation of software as I write this book. But with TiVo’s five-year head
start and hefty patent portfolio, the competition had better start scrambling.

TiVo Automatically Searches for Shows
To record an upcoming show on TiVo, you simply type in the show’s name.
Or, you can search for the show, browsing by category, by actor/director
name, or even by entering a few keywords. TiVo locates the show, describes
it, and lets you decide how to record it.
The Scientific Atlanta DVR, by contrast, only let me select shows by name
from their standard program guide; the guide only listed a few channels on
each screen. Only after I spotted the show’s name could I select it to be
recorded.
Without a search feature, I had to know the show’s name, its exact air time,
and its channel before I could find it on the guide and record it.
TiVo Offers a Season Pass
TiVo’s Season Pass automatically records every new episode of a series. If the
network changes an episode’s air date or time, TiVo adjusts its recording
schedule accordingly. TiVo even recognizes and ignores reruns.
The Scientific Atlanta 8000 DVR offered only to record every episode of a
show, including repeats of the same episode. (Some models only record by a
specific time and date, not by a program’s name.)
TiVo Offers a WishList
The WishList keeps TiVo constantly searching for upcoming shows that
match what you’re looking for — an actor, director, theme, or keyword. When
TiVo finds a match — even weeks later — it either automatically records or
lists the show, according to your designation.
Because the DVR only records shows you specifically find and select by
name, it can’t search for and automatically record any shows matching your
previously entered search terms.

A Standalone TiVo Won’t Record 
in Dolby 5.1 Sound
Our standalone TiVo can’t record in Dolby 5.1 sound, unfortunately, which is
what made me try out Cox’s DVR in the first place. The DVR definitely had
the upper hand here, as it recorded HBO movies that played back in
Dolby 5.1 sound.
Unfortunately, the DVR’s 5.1 sound feature still had some bugs. Although it
played live movies correctly in 5.1 sound, the recorder couldn’t play back
recorded 5.1 sound. The recorded sound stuttered and skipped, missing bits
of dialogue. I swapped it for a different unit, but that one did the same thing.
A quick search on the Internet showed several other people with the same
problem.
The DirecTV TiVo will record and playback in 5.1 sound, but we subscribe to
cable, not satellite, at our home.
TiVo’s a Time-Tested Technology
Quite simply, TiVo works. TiVo started with the old Series 1 boxes and gradu-
ated to the new Series 2 boxes. TiVo has been integrated with a satellite box
(DirecTV TiVo), a DVD player, and a DVD recorder (covered in Chapter 1).
TiVo has already progressed through five major software versions. Simply
put, TiVo has had time to fine-tune everything so it works without problems;
its menus are easy to navigate and visually appealing.
DVRs arrived much more recently on the market, so the manufacturers still
need time to work out the problems. I’m sure they’re improved as you read
these pages.
You Own TiVo
When you buy a standalone TiVo, you own it. You can take it with you if you
move. You can increase its storage space. If you pay the Lifetime Subscription
fee, you don’t need to pay monthly rental fees. You can hook a standalone
TiVo up to any TV source, including cable, satellite, and plain old rabbit ears.
275
Chapter 19: Ten Differences between TiVo and Generic DVRs

The DVRs from the cable company come on a rental basis only, and they’re
never paid off. (Mine even came with a $40 installation fee, although the tech-
nician just handed it to me.)
The DVR Lets You Watch One Show Live
and Record Another Simultaneously
The Scientific Atlanta 8000 DVR includes two tuners, letting you watch one
show live while recording another live show in the background.
Our standalone TiVo can’t do this (although we rented a second cable box to
get around that problem, as discussed in Chapter 3). DirecTV TiVos come
with two tuners, though, so they can do the same thing.

Ten Big Differences between
Series 1 and Series 2 TiVos
In This Chapter
 Understanding the hardware differences

 Understanding differences in the Now Playing menu
 Viewing the System Information screen
 Understanding limitations of a Series 1 TiVo
I
n the days of yesteryear, before Series 2 TiVos filled today’s store shelves,
TiVo sold an earlier model, dubbed a “Series 1” TiVo. Sold from the late
1990s to 2002, the old Series 1 TiVo works very similar to today’s “Series 2”
TiVos. Nearly everything in this book applies to all TiVo models.
This chapter explores the few key differences between the Series 1 TiVos and
the Series 2 models. It explains how to tell them apart at a glance, which
comes in handy if you’re shopping for a used TiVo. Shoppers should also take
note of the Series 2 features not found in Series 1, so they know what they’ll
be missing.
Series 1 owners should examine the main wording differences in the menus.
This book uses the wordings found in Series 2 TiVos. Series 1 owners can
compare the Series 1 and 2 menus shown here and substitute their own
wordings when following steps in this book.

Differences in the TiVo Central Menu
It’s easy to tell if you’re looking at a Series 1 or Series 2 TiVo. You don’t even
have to pull the TiVo off the shelf to look for its missing “USB port.” Just pull
up the TiVo Central menu for a quick identifier.
The TiVo Central menu on a Series 1 TiVo is blue, with a moving “starburst”
pattern in the background, as seen in Figure 20-1.
The Series 2 TiVo, on the other hand, has a green TiVo Central menu with
moving gears in the background, shown in Figure 20-2.
Note how the Series 2 TiVo Central menu in Figure 20-2 contains the extra
Music and Photos option. Not all Series 2 TiVos sport this menu, as it’s part of
the TiVo’s Home Media Option add-on. But you’ll never see that menu option
on a Series 1 TiVo — TiVo doesn’t offer the Home Media Option for Series 1
TiVos.

278
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Note the subtle differences in wording, as well.
 Series 1 offers the “Now Playing list” as its top menu item. Series 2 TiVos
refer to it as “Now Playing on TiVo.”
 Series 1 offers “Showcases.” Series 2 refers to that menu item as
“Showcases and TV Guide.”
 Series 1 offers “Messages & Setup” compared to Series 2’s “TiVo
Messages & Setup.”
If you’re a Series 1 owner, keep in mind these subtle differences when follow-
ing this book’s step-by-step instructions.
Differences in the Now Playing Menu
The TiVo corporation tossed an extra software upgrade onto Series 2 TiVos,
giving them several new features not found in Series 1 TiVos. One of the
biggest differences appears in the Now Playing menu.
Series 1 TiVos offer only one type of Now Playing menu, seen in Figure 20-3.

Chapter 20: Ten Big Differences between Series 1 and Series 2 TiVos

Series 1 TiVos only list shows in the order they were recorded, so the newest
shows always appear at the top. It places every recorded show on the menu,
without an option to manage them or sort them into groups.
Series 2 TiVos, by contrast, allow users to group shows into “folders.” Figure
20-4, for instance, shows four folders on the Now Playing menu. The Simply
Quilts folder at the top contains five episodes of my wife’s “Simply Quilts”
show. Two episodes of “The Duke” live in another folder below.
Notice the little star on the folder for Outkast? That star appears on a folder
containing two shows caught by an Autorecording WishList;, in this case, for
the musical group Outkast.
Placing show episodes into folders reduces menu clutter, and keeps users
from scrolling down a long list of shows to find the right one. To find a partic-
ular episode of “Simply Quilts,” for instance, open the Simply Quilts folder,
seen in Figure 20-5.

Chapter 20: Ten Big Differences between Series 1 and Series 2 TiVos

 Series 2 TiVos refer to the Now Playing menu as “Now Playing on TiVo;”
Series 1 TiVos call it the “Now Playing list.”
 Pressing Enter on a Series 2 TiVo lets you choose between sorting shows
alphabetically or by recording date.
 Here’s a quick shortcut: From the Now Playing menu, press 1 to toggle
between sorting shows by date or by alphabet; press 2 to turn the folder
grouping on or off.
Differences in the System 
Information Screen
The most foolproof way of telling the difference between a Series 1 and Series
2 TiVo comes by looking at the System Information screen. To find the System
Information screen on any TiVo, choose Messages & Setup from the TiVo
Central menu, then choose System Information.
The Series 1 System Information screen, seen in Figure 20-6, is brown. It 
doesn’t specifically say “Series 1.”
The Series 2 System Information screen, seen in Figure 20-7, is not only blue,
but the menu says “Series2” on the “Platform” line.

282
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The software version for Series 1 TiVos is never higher than version 3; Series
2 TiVos usually have version 4 software, although the integrated DVD TiVos
have version 5 software.
Limitations of Series 1 TiVos
You can usually pick up a refurbished or used Series 1 TiVo from eBay
(www.ebay.com) for around one hundred bucks. (You still have to pay the
monthly subscription fees to TiVo, although Series 1 TiVos with Lifetime
Subscriptions often turn up on eBay, too.) If you buy a used Series 1 TiVo, you
won’t be getting these things:
 A warranty. Unless you purchase TiVo from an authorized retailer, it
won’t come with the standard warranty. You can download a copy of
the TiVo’s manual from TiVo’s Web site (www.tivo.com). Some do-it-
yourself replacement parts are available online at WeaKnees.com
(www.weaknees.com), PTVupgrade (www.ptvupgrade.com), and
other Web sites.
 A USB port. Without one, you can’t hook it directly to your computer
and piggyback on its broadband Internet connection. It will need a
phone line.

Chapter 20: Ten Big Differences between Series 1 and Series 2 TiVos

 The Home Media Option. Described in Part III of this book, the Home
Media Option lets you schedule recordings from any Web site, transfer
shows between two of your TiVos, or play MP3 songs and view photos
from your computer.
 Speed. The Series 1 TiVo is a little slower than the Series 2 TiVo. It’s cer-
tainly usable, but you’ll notice a slight speed improvement if you switch
to a Series 2 TiVo.
 Menu enhancements. Described earlier in this chapter, this lets you
group recordings into folders, and sort them either by recording date or
alphabetically.
 Future enhancements. TiVo still supports Series 1 TiVos, but they won’t
be adding new enhancements to this model. New features will only
appear on the Series 2 TiVos.
If these things don’t really matter to you, a used Series 1 TiVo might be all
you need to start living a TiVo lifestyle.

TiVo For Dummies 

Series 1: The original series of TiVos that are no longer made. 
Series 2: The TiVos sold in the stores today. (At the time of this writing,
DirecTV TiVos don’t have all the features of other Series 2 TiVos, although
they’re very similar in design.)
Software update: A periodic update sent to TiVo during its Daily Call that
adds features or fixes problems.
Standalone: A TiVo without an integrated satellite receiver. (DirecTV TiVos,
by contrast, contain an integrated satellite receiver.)
Standby: A menu option that tells TiVo you’re no longer playing with it. TiVo
subsequently turns off its audio and video outputs; it reinstates Parental
Controls (if you’ve turned them on); and TiVo turns off its front panel lights.
But TiVo continues to record your scheduled shows in the background,
changing channels whenever necessary. (DirecTV TiVos also stop recording
the live TV buffers.) To resume playing with TiVo, press the TiVo button or
Live TV button.
Subscription: TiVo’s features require a subscription, paid on a monthly basis
or, for standalone TiVos, through a single “lifetime” lump-sum payment.
Suggestions: Shows TiVo thinks you’ll like, based on your viewing habits.
Some Suggestions are automatically recorded (unless you say not to), but
you can always see a list of Suggestions from the Pick Programs to Record
menu. TiVo always erases Suggestions first when making room for shows
you’ve personally selected to record.
S-Video: A video cable (usually black) carrying separate color and brightness
information, which usually makes for a better picture. (The S-Video cable’s
plug contains four tiny pins arranged in an arc.)
Test call: Making a connection between TiVo and the computer at TiVo’s
headquarters to make sure they can communicate successfully. Usually done
through the phone line, this can also be done through a computer network.
Thumbs Down: Pressing the Thumbs Down button teaches TiVo you don’t like
that show (and similar shows), and TiVo tailors its Suggestions accordingly.
Thumbs Up: Pressing the Thumbs Up button lets TiVo know you’ve enjoyed
that show (and similar shows), and TiVo tailors its Suggestions accordingly.
UK TiVo: A TiVo built specifically for the United Kingdom and its PAL broad-
cast format. (No longer sold, UK TiVos won’t work in the United States.)
287
Glossary

Wireless modem jack: A gadget allowing communications between TiVo and
a phone jack without cables. The gadget’s “sender” plugs into TiVo and
beams signals to the gadget’s “receiver,” which plugs into your phone jack.
WishList: A list of actors, directors, or topics for TiVo to locate so you can
pick and choose which ones to record. (See Autorecording WishList.)
