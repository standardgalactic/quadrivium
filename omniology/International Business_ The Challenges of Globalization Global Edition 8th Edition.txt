related to the theory students are learning in class. Quizzes then assess students’ comprehension of 
the concepts covered in each video.
• Learning Catalytics – a “bring your own device” student engagement, assessment, and classroom 
intelligence system helps instructors analyze students’ critical-thinking skills during lecture.
• Dynamic Study Modules (DSMs) – through adaptive learning, students get personalized guidance 
where and when they need it most, creating greater engagement, improving knowledge retention,  
and supporting subject-matter mastery. Also available on mobile devices.
• Business Today – bring current events alive in your classroom with videos, discussion  
questions, and author blogs. Be sure to check back often, this section changes daily.
• Decision-making simulations – place your 
students in the role of a key decision-maker. The

decisions students make, providing a variation of 
scenario paths. Upon completion of each simulation, 
students receive a grade, as well as a detailed report 
of the choices they made during the simulation and 
the associated consequences of those decisions.
• Writing Space – better writers make great learners—who perform better in their courses.  Providing 
a single location to develop and assess concept mastery and critical thinking, the Writing Space  offers 
assisted graded and create your own writing assignments, allowing you to exchange personalized 
 feedback with students quickly and easily.
 
Writing Space can also check students’ work for improper citation or plagiarism by comparing it 
against the world’s most accurate text comparison database available from Turnitin.

Welcome to the eighth edition of International Business: The Challenges of Globalization. As in 
previous editions, this book resulted from extensive market surveys, chapter reviews, and corre-
spondence with scores of instructors and students. We are delighted that an overwhelming num-
ber of instructors and students agree with our fresh approach to international business. The re-
ception of this textbook in the United States and across the world has exceeded all expectations.
This book presents international business in a comprehensive yet concise framework. Real-
world examples and engaging features bring the concepts of international business to life and 
make international business accessible for all students. A main goal in this edition is to deliver 
the most readable, current, and concise international business textbook available. And this 
book’s paperback format ensures that its price matches a student’s budget.
This book is our means of traveling on an exciting tour through the study of international 
business. It motivates the reader by making international business challenging yet fun. It also 
embraces the central role of people and their cultures in international business. Each chapter is 
infused with real-world discussion, while underlying theory appears in the background where 
it belongs. Terminology is used consistently, and theories are explained in direct and concise 
terms. This book’s visual style is innovative yet subtle and uses photos, illustrations, and fea-
tures sparingly. The result is an easy-to-read and clutter-free design.
What’s New in This Edition
• Chapter 1 has been reorganized for a better flow of topics
• We added a new section in Chapter 2 titled Culture in the Global Workplace
• Chapter 2 covers the sixth and latest Hofstede dimension
• Chapters 3 and 4 have been blended and redesigned into a political economy framework
• Coverage of regional integration in chapter 8 is now presented as a debate
• MyManagementLab is now more integrated throughout the text
MyManagementLab™ Suggested activities
We are excited that Pearson’s MyManagement Lab has been fully integrated into the text. 
These new features are outlined below. The online assessment activities enable you to quiz your 
 students before they come to class so that you have more time in class to focus on areas that 
 students find most challenging.
Watch It
Recommends a video clip that can be assigned to students for outside classroom viewing or that 
can be watched in the classroom. The video corresponds to the chapter material and is accompa-
nied by multiple choice questions that reinforce student comprehension.
try It
Recommends a mini simulation that can be assigned to students as an outside classroom activ-
ity or that can be done in the classroom. As the students watch the simulation they will be asked 
to make choices based on the scenario presented. At the end of the simulation the student will 
receive immediate feedback based on the answers they gave. These simulations reinforce the 
chapters’ concepts and the students’ comprehension of those concepts.
talk about It
These are discussion-based questions that can be assigned as an activity in the classroom.

Chapter by Chapter Changes
• Coverage of globalization and the global business environment in Chapter 1 has been re-
organized for a better flow of topics. Some material has been compressed and other topics 
rearranged within the chapter. Chapter 1 also demonstrates the new design for the learning 
objectives, whereby each objective directly aligns with each major section in the chapter 
and with the chapter summary.
• The role of culture in business in Chapter 2 has been improved to aid student comprehen-
sion. The chapter contains a new section titled “Culture in the Global Workplace,” which 
covers how people in different cultures view time, work, cultural change, and material cul-
ture. We listened to your feedback and replaced the complex Hofstede figures with a table 
of country scores for each Hofstede dimension. We also now include coverage of the sixth 
and latest Hofstede dimension—indulgence versus restraint.
• The most significant change in topical coverage is a reworking of the previous Chapters 3 
and 4. Chapter 3 now covers political, legal, and economic systems as integrated systems 
of political economy by absorbing the topic of economic systems from Chapter 4. These 
changes reflect instructor preference for a more applied approach to teaching the material 
as an integrated system. Accordingly, Chapter 4 now covers the economic development of 
nations more directly than in previous editions and includes relevant topics that were previ-
ously in Chapter 3, including political risk and international relations.
• Coverage of regional economic integration in Chapter 8 has been streamlined in 
places and coverage of the trading bloc known as ALADI has been removed. Instead 
of presenting the pros and cons of regional integration as benefits and drawbacks, the 
material is now presented as a debate over the effects of regional integration. This 
change reflects instructor and student requests for a more dynamic presentation of this 
material.
• This edition of International Business is also more interactive than any previous edition. If 
assigned by the instructor, students are invited to go to the MyManagementLab Website at 
relevant places throughout each chapter to complete multiple-choice exercises, to watch a 
video and answer questions, or to perform a simulation exercise.
• All chapters contain the latest available data and reference sources as of the date of 
 printing. For example, Table 5.1 in Chapter 5 presents the latest ranking of the world’s top 
merchandise and service exporters, and Table 5.2 provides updated figures on the amount 
of trade that flows between different world regions.
• This edition keeps pace with current events around the world. Wherever possible, we in-
tegrate recent events into chapter-opening company profiles, tables and figures, feature 
boxes, in-text examples, and end-of-chapter mini cases.
Hallmark Features of International Business
Culture Early and Often
Culture is a fundamental element of all international business activity. This book’s presentation of 
culture sensitizes students to the lives of people in other nations. Culture appears early (Chapter 
2) and is integrated throughout the text using culture-rich chapter openers and lively examples of 
how culture affects international business. Covering culture in this way gets students interested in 
chapter material because it illustrates how concepts relate to the real world.
Highly readable
A successful book for the first course in international business must be accessible to students. 
We describe conceptual material and specialized business activities in concrete, straightforward 
terms and illustrate them appropriately. For example, we introduce the concepts of absolute and 
comparative advantage in Chapter 5 by discussing whether a highly paid CEO should install her 

 
PREFACE   21
own hot tub or let a professional installer perform 
the job. This approach—presenting complex ma-
terial in an accessible manner—helps students to 
better master the material.
Uniquely Integrative
International business is not simply a collection 
of separate business functions and environmental 
forces. The model shown here (and detailed in 
Chapter 1) is a unique organizing framework that 
helps students to understand how the elements of in-
ternational business are related. It depicts a dynamic, 
integrated system that weaves together national 
 business environments, the international business en-
vironment, and international business management. 
It also shows that characteristics of globalization 
(new technologies and falling barriers to trade and 
investment) are causing greater competition.
Interactive approach
This book’s cutting-edge technology package 
helps students to better understand international 
business. MyManagementLab is an innovative set 
of course-management tools for delivering course 
material online and makes it easy to add meaning-
ful assessment to the course. Whether interested 
in testing students on simple recall of concepts and theories or gauging how well students can 
apply their newly minted knowledge to real-world scenarios, MyManagementLab offers a va-
riety of activities that are applied, personalized, and offer immediate feedback. Instructors and 
students say that the MyManagementLab learning system is fun and easy to use and far superior 
to anything available from any competitor.
Innovative Pedagogy
This book’s pedagogy stands apart from the competition:
• Chapter-opening company profiles are brief, easy-to-read introductions to each chapter’s 
content filtered through the lens of a real-world example. Instructors say these profiles 
of high-interest firms motivate students to turn the page and get reading the chapters. 
Companies profiled are on the leading edge of their industries and are inherently inter-
esting to students, including Apple, PepsiCo, Infosys, Nintendo, Ryanair, Marvel, and 
Red Bull.
•  Global Sustainability boxes present special topics related to economic, social, and 
environmental sustainability. Today, 
businesses know that flourishing mar-
kets rely on strong economies, thriving 
societies, and healthy environments. 
Topics include the factors that contrib-
ute to sustainable development, ending 
civil wars that destroy fragile societies, 
and how companies make their supply 
chains more environmentally friendly.
• Culture Matters boxes present the relation 
between culture and a key chapter topic. 
For example, Chapter 2 presents the im-
portance of businesspeople developing a 
global mindset and avoiding cultural bias. 
Another chapter presents the debate over

• Toyota focused on the environment in its developed mar-
kets. After extensively researching gas-electric hybrid tech-
nologies, Toyota launched the Prius. As Motor Trend’s Car of 
the Year, the Prius drove Toyota’s profits to record highs and 
gave it a “green” image.
• Shree Cement faced limited access to low-cost energy in 
India’s emerging market. So it developed the world’s most 
energy-efficient process for making its products. The world’s 
leading cement companies now visit Shree to learn from its 
innovations in energy usage.
• Blommer Chocolate of the United States works closely with 
cocoa farmers in traditional markets. Blommer received the 
Rainforest Alliance’s “Sustainable Standard-Setter” award 
for training farmers in safe farming practices, environmental 
stewardship, and HIV awareness

A company adapts its business strategy to the nuances of the 
market it enters. The world’s population of 7 billion people lives in 
three different types of markets:
• Developed Markets These include the world’s established 
 consumer markets, around one billion people. The population is 
solidly middle class, and people can consume almost any prod-
uct desired. The infrastructure is highly developed and efficient.
• Emerging Markets These markets, around two billion 
 people, are racing to catch up to developed nations. The 
population is migrating to cities for better pay and is over-
loading cities’ infrastructures. Rising incomes are increasing 
global demand for resources and basic products.
• Traditional Markets Globalization has bypassed these markets, 
nearly four billion people. The population is mostly rural, the 
infrastructure is very poor, and there is little credit or collateral. 
People have almost no legal protections, and corruption prevails.
Like business strategy, sustainability strategies reflect local con-
ditions. Examples of businesses working toward sustainability in 
these three markets include the following:

globalization’s influence on culture, and still another box shows how entrepreneurs succeed 
by exploiting their knowledge of local cultures.
•  Manager’s Briefcase boxes address issues facing companies active in international business. 
Issues presented can be relevant to entrepreneurs and small businesses or to the world’s larg-
est global companies. Topics include obtaining capital to finance international activities, get-
ting paid for exports, and how to be mindful of personal security while abroad on business.
•  NEW Learning Objectives focus on the main lessons students should take away from the 
material and are summarized in bullet-point format at the end of the  chapter. Learning ob-
jectives are now aligned with each main chapter section and with the chapter summary to 
aid comprehension.
• NEW Quick Study concept checks help students to verify that they have learned the sec-
tion’s key terms and important concepts before moving on. 
• Bottom Line for Business sections conclude chapters and explain the impact of the chap-
ter’s topics on managers and their firms’ policies, strategies, and activities abroad.
• Full-Color World Atlas, which appears as an appendix to Chapter 1, is a primer for students 
to test their knowledge of world geography and acts as a reference tool throughout the course.
• Beacons provide students with a “road map” of how chapters relate to one another. These bea-
cons appear at the start of each chapter and are appropriately titled, “A Look Back,” “A Look 
at This Chapter,” and “A Look Ahead.”
• PowerPoint slides for instructors contain teaching notes and include question slides to use as in-
class comprehension checks. 
• Videos are available to accompany this text and cover topics such as globalization, culture’s 
impact on business, international business ethics, foreign direct investment, emerging mar-
kets, and entry modes.
tools for active Learning
Feedback on previous editions shows that this book has more—and more useful—end-of-chapter 
assignment material than any other international business book. Still, we refined the end-of-chapter 
exercises in response to the changing needs and desires of students and instructors. Carefully cho-
sen assignment materials span the full range of complexity in order to test students’ knowledge 
and ability to apply key principles. Assignment materials are often experiential in nature to help 
students develop decision-making skills. Assignment materi-
als include the following:
A Tale of Two Cultures
M
any cultures in Asia are in the midst of an identity crisis. In 
effect, they are being torn between two worlds. Pulling in 
one direction is a traditional value system derived from agricul-
ture-based communities and extended families—that is, elements 
of a culture in which relatives take care of one another and state-
run welfare systems are unnecessary. Pulling from the opposite 
direction is a new set of values emerging from manufacturing- and 
finance-based economies—elements of a culture in which workers 
must often move to faraway cities to find work, sometimes leaving 
family members to fend for themselves.
For decades, Western multinational corporations set up facto-
ries across Southeast Asia to take advantage of relatively low-cost 
labor. Later, local companies sprang up and became competi-
tive global players in their own right. Spectacular rates of eco-
nomic growth in a few short decades elevated living standards 
 beyond what was thought possible. Young people in Malaysia and 
Thailand felt the lure of “Western” brands. Gucci handbags (www.
gucci.com), Harley-Davidson motorcycles (www.harley-davidson.
com), and other global brands became common symbols of suc-
cess. Many parents felt that brand-consciousness among their 
teenage children signaled familywide success.
Despite the growing consumer society, polls of young people 
show them holding steadfast to traditional values such as respect 
for family and group harmony. Youth in Hong Kong, for example, 
overwhelmingly believe that parents should have a say in how 
hard they study, in how they treat family members and elders, and 
in their choice of friends.
Now globalization is washing over India. An explosion in out-
sourcing jobs caused a social revolution among India’s graduates 
of technical colleges and universities. Unlike in India’s traditional 
high-tech service jobs, young call-center staffers are in direct con-
tact with Western consumers, answering inquiries on items such as 
tummy crunchers and diet pills. For these young, mostly female 
staffers, the work means money, independence, and freedom—
sometimes far away from home in big cities such as Bangalore 
and Mumbai. But in addition to the training in American accents 
and geography, these workers are learning new ideas about family, 
materialism, and relationships.
Parents are suspicious of call-center work because it must 
typically be performed at night in India, when consumers are 
awake in Canada, Europe, or the United States. When her parents 
objected, Binitha Venugopal quit her call-center job in favor of a 
“regular” daytime job. Binitha says her former coworkers’ values 
are changing and that dating and live-in relationships among them 
are common. Indian tradition dictates that young adults live with 
their parents at least until they get married (typically to someone 
their parents choose). Perhaps facilitating shifting values in India 
is an influx of Western professionals, such as lawyers, who 
 accepted good-paying jobs there that could not be found back 
home during the global recession.
Roopa Murthy works for an Indian company that offers call-
center and back-office services. Roopa moved to Bangalore from 
her native Mysore armed with an accounting degree. She now 
earns $400 per month, which is several times what her father 
earned before he retired from his government job. Roopa cut her 
hair short and tossed aside her salwar kameez, the traditional 
loose-fitting clothing she wore back home, in favor of designer-
labeled Western attire.
Although she once shunned drinking and her curfew at home 
was 9 p.m., Roopa now frequents a pub called Geoffrey’s, where 
she enjoys dry martinis and rum, and The Club, a suburban 
disco. Roopa confesses that she is “seeing someone” but that 
her parents would disapprove, adding, “It is difficult to talk to 
Indian parents about things like boyfriends.” She said she some-
times envies her callers’ lives but that she hopes her job will help 
her succeed. “I may be a small-town girl, but there is no way 
I’m  going back to Mysore after this,” she said. Many observers 
wonder whether Asia can embrace modernization and yet retain 
traditional values.
Thinking Globally
 2-14. If you worked for an international firm doing business in 
Asia, is there anything you would suggest to ease the ten-
sions these cultures are experiencing? Be specific.
 2-15. Social ills in any country are normally born from a multi-
tude of factors. What role, if any, do you think globalization 
is having in higher reported rates of divorce, crime, and 
drug abuse in Asia?
 2-16. Broadly defined, Asia comprises more than 60 percent 
of the world’s population—a population that practices 
Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, and numerous 
other religions. Do you think it is possible to carry on a 
valid discussion of “Asian” values? Explain.

Practicing International Management Case
• Talk About It questions can be used for in-class discus-
sion or as homework assignments. These exercises raise 
important issues currently confronting entrepreneurs, 
international managers, policy makers, consumers, and 
others.
• Ethical Challenge exercises (in a “You are the . . .” format) 
ask students to assume the role of a manager, government 
official, or someone else and to make a  decision based on 
the facts presented to them.
• Teaming Up projects go beyond the text and require 
students to collaborate in teams to conduct interviews, 
research other countries, or hold in-class debates. Projects 
expose students to different perspectives when they bring 
together students who have different cultural backgrounds.
• Market Entry Strategy Project is an interactive 
 simulation that asks students to research a country as a 
 future market for a new video game system, the M-Box. 
Working as part of a team, students research and ana-
lyze a country, and then recommend a course of action.
• Practicing International Management cases ask  students 
to analyze the responses of real-world  companies to the 
issues, problems, and opportunities discussed in each 
chapter.

Chapter 1 • Globalization  31
Apple’s Global iMpact
CUPERTINO, California—The Apple (www.apple.com) iPhone excites style lovers 
the world over and changed how all sorts of items are designed. With its focus on 
beauty and simplicity, the iPhone made 
“user-centered design” a catch phrase 
in business.
New applications (or “apps”) crop 
up daily that constantly expand the 
 capabilities of the iPhone and its sibling, 
the iPad. Apple’s App Store boasts more 
than 1 million diverse offerings, around 
half of which are optimized for use on 
the iPad. A person can download an app 
for practically any interest they might 
have. And the iCloud adds convenience 
and flexibility as files instantly reflect 
changes that a user makes on any Apple 
device, be it an iPhone, iPad, or Mac 
computer.
Globalization allows Apple to 
produce and sell many of its models 
worldwide with little or no modifica-
tion. This approach reduces Apple’s production and marketing costs while supporting 
its global brand strategy. Apple retails its products through more than 400 outlets in 
16 countries and from its online store available in 40 countries.
When Apple entered South America in February of 2014 it opened its first store 
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Brazil is the largest consumer market across the region and 
in the top five markets worldwide for smartphone sales. Despite the benefits of glo-
balization, Apple still encounters issues in other markets that complicate pricing. For 
instance, a smartphone that costs $700 in the United States will cost $1,076 in Brazil. 
The higher price is due to the custo Brasil (Brazil cost), which arises from import tariffs 
and federal and state sales taxes. Prices of older Apple products that are made in Brazil 
reflect the higher cost of labor and more expensive rents there.
iTunes U is a free hosting service that Apple offers to colleges and universities that 
provides 24/7 access to educational materials. Students download lectures and other 
content to their mobile devices and watch or listen on the go. So if you see a backpack-
toting student on campus listening to her iPod, she might be listening to her favorite 
playlist or her favorite instructor. As you read this chapter, consider how globalization 
is shaping our lives and altering the activities of international companies.1

Each of us experiences the results of international business transactions as we go about our daily 
routines. The General Electric (www.ge.com) alarm clock/radio that woke you this morning was 
made in China. The breaking news buzzing in your ears was produced by Britain’s BBC radio 
(www.bbc.co.uk). You slip on your Adidas sandals (www.adidas.com) that were made in Indo-
nesia, an Abercrombie & Fitch T-shirt (www.abercrombie.com) made in the Northern Mariana 
Islands, and American Eagle jeans (www.ae.com) made in Mexico. As you head out the door, 
you pull the battery charger off your Apple iPhone (www.apple.com), which was designed in 
the United States and assembled in China with parts from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and sev-
eral other nations. You hop into your Korean Hyundai (www.hmmausa.com) that was made in 
Alabama, grab your iPod, and play a song by the English band Coldplay (www.coldplay.com). 
You drive to the local Starbucks (www.starbucks.com) to charge your own batteries with coffee 
brewed from beans harvested in Colombia and Ethiopia. Your day is just one hour old, but in a 
way, you’ve already taken a virtual trip around the world. A quick glance at the “Made in” tags 
on your jacket, backpack, watch, wallet, or other items with you right now will demonstrate the 
pervasiveness of international business transactions.
International business is any commercial transaction that crosses the borders of two or 
more nations. You don’t have to set foot outside a small town to find evidence of international 
business. No matter where you live, you’ll be surrounded by imports—goods and services pur-
chased abroad and brought into a country. Your counterparts around the world will undoubtedly 
spend some part of their day using your nation’s exports—goods and services sold abroad and 
sent out of a country. Every year, all the nations of the world export goods worth $18.4 trillion 
and services worth $4.3 trillion. This figure is around 48 times the annual global revenue of 
Walmart Stores (www.walmart.com).2
People can view the role of international business in society very differently from each 
other, and they can approach globalization from very different perspectives. A businessperson 
may see globalization as an opportunity to source goods and services from lower-cost locations 
and to pry open new markets. An economist may see it as an opportunity to examine the impact 
of globalization on jobs and standards of living. An environmentalist may be concerned with 
how globalization affects our ecology. An anthropologist may want to examine the influence of 
globalization on the culture of a group of people. A political scientist may be concerned with the 
impact of globalization on the power of governments relative to that of multinational companies. 
And an employee may view globalization either as an opportunity for new work or as a threat to

his or her current job. The different lenses through which we view events around us make glo-
balization a rich and complex topic.
As technology drives down the cost of global communication and travel, globalization is 
increasingly exposing us to the traits and practices of other cultures. Individuals and businesses 
on the other side of the world can sell us their products and purchase our own easily online. 
Globalization forces companies to grow more competitive in the face of greater rivalry brought 
about by lower barriers to trade and investment. By knitting the world more tightly together, 
 globalization is altering our private lives and transforming the way companies do business.
This chapter begins by examining the key players in international business. Then, we 
describe globalization’s powerful influence on markets and production and explain the forces 
behind its expansion. Next, we cover each main point in the debate over globalization. We also 
explain why international business is special by presenting an integrated model of the global 
business environment. Finally, the appendix at the end of this chapter contains a world atlas to 
be used as a primer for this chapter’s discussion and as a reference throughout the remainder of 
the book.
Key Players in International Business
Companies of all types and sizes and in all sorts of industries become involved in international 
business, yet they vary in the extent of their involvement. A small shop owner might only import 
supplies from abroad, whereas a large company may have dozens of factories located around the 
world. Large companies from the wealthiest nations still dominate international business. But 
firms from emerging markets (such as Brazil, China, India, and South Africa) now vigorously 
compete for global market share. Small and medium-sized companies are also increasingly 
 active in international business, largely because of advances in technology.
Multinational Corporations
A multinational corporation (MNC) is a business that has direct investments (in the form of 
marketing or manufacturing subsidiaries) abroad in multiple countries. Multinationals generate 
significant jobs, investment, and tax revenue for the regions and nations they enter. Likewise, 
they can leave thousands of people out of work when they close or scale back operations. 
Mergers and acquisitions between multinationals are commonly worth billions of dollars and 
increasingly involve companies based in emerging markets.
Some companies have more employees than many of the smallest countries and island 
nations have citizens. Walmart, for example, has 2.2 million employees. We see the enormous 
economic clout of multinational corporations when we compare the revenues of the Global 500 
ranking of companies with the value of goods and services that countries generate. Figure 1.1 
shows the world’s 10 largest companies (measured in revenue) inserted into a ranking of nations 
according to their national output (measured in GDP). If Walmart (www.walmart.com) were a 
country, it would weigh in as a rich nation and rank just three places behind Norway. Even the 
$23 billion in revenue generated by the 500th largest firm in the world, Ricoh (www.ricoh.com), 
exceeds the annual output of many countries.3
Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
International business competition has given rise to a new entity, the born global firm—a 
company that adopts a global perspective and engages in international business from or near its 
inception. Many of these companies become international competitors in less than three years’ 
time. Born global firms tend to have innovative cultures and knowledge-based organizational 
capabilities. And in this age of globalization, companies are exporting earlier and growing faster, 
often with help from technology.
Small firms selling traditional products benefit from technology that lowers the costs and 
difficulties of global communication. Vellus Products (www.vellus.com) of Columbus, Ohio, 
makes and sells pet-grooming products. Around 20 years ago, a dog breeder in Spain became 
Vellus’s first distributor after the breeder received a request for more information on Vellus’s 
products from a man in Bahrain. “The way this [business transaction] transpired just blew 
me away,” says Sharon Kay Doherty, president of Vellus. The company now has distributors in

31 countries. Vellus resembles a global company in that it earned more than half its revenues 
from international sales soon after going international.4
Electronic distribution for firms that sell digitized products is an effective alternative to tradi-
tional distribution channels. Alessandro Naldi’s Weekend in Italy website (en.firenze.waf.it) offers 
visitors more authentic Florentine products than they’ll find in the scores of overpriced tourist 
shops in downtown Florence. A Florentine himself, Naldi established his site to sell high-quality, 
authentic Italian merchandise made only in the small factories of Tuscany. Weekend in Italy aver-
ages 200,000 visitors each month from places as far away as Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, 
and the United States.5

Chapter 1 • Globalization  35
national borders. Globalization is the name we give to this trend toward greater economic, cul-
tural, political, and technological interdependence among national institutions and economies. 
Globalization is characterized by denationalization (national boundaries becoming less relevant) 
and is different from internationalization (entities cooperating across national boundaries).
It is helpful to put today’s globalization into context. There was a first age of globalization 
that extended from the mid-1800s to the 1920s.6 In those days, labor was highly mobile, with 
300,000 people leaving Europe each year in the 1800s and 1 million people leaving each year 
after 1900.7 Other than in wartime, nations did not even require passports for international travel 
before 1914. Like today, workers in wealthy nations feared competition for jobs from high- and 
low-wage countries.
Trade and capital flowed more freely than ever during that first age of globalization. Huge 
companies from wealthy nations built facilities in distant lands to extract raw materials and 
to produce all sorts of goods. Large cargo ships plied the seas to deliver their manufactures to 
distant markets. The transatlantic cable (completed in 1866) allowed news between Europe and 
the United States to travel faster than ever before. The drivers of that first age of globalization 
included the steamship, telegraph, railroad, and, later, the telephone and airplane.
That first age of globalization was abruptly halted by the arrival of the First World War, 
the Russian Revolution, and the Great Depression. A backlash to fierce competition in trade 
and to unfettered immigration in the early 1900s helped to usher in high tariffs and barriers to 
immigration. The great flows of goods, capital, and people common before the First World War 
became a mere trickle. For 75 years from the start of the First World War to the end of the Cold 
War, the world remained divided. There was a geographic divide between East and West and an 
ideological divide between communism and capitalism. After the Second World War, the West 
experienced steady economic gains, but international flows of goods, capital, and people were 
confined to their respective capitalist and communist systems and geographies.
Fast-forward to 1989 and the collapse of the wall separating East and West Berlin. One by 
one, central and eastern European nations rejected communism and began marching toward 
democratic institutions and free-market economic systems. Although it took until the 1990s for 
international capital flows, in absolute terms, to recover to levels seen prior to the First World 
War, the global economy had finally been reborn. The drivers of this second age of globalization 
include communication satellites, fiber optics, microchips, and the Internet.
Let’s explore two areas of business in which globalization is having profound effects: the 
globalization of markets and production.
Globalization of Markets
Globalization of markets refers to the convergence in buyer preferences in markets around the 
world. This trend is occurring in many product categories, including consumer goods, industrial 
products, and business services. Clothing retailer L.L. Bean (www.llbean.com), shoe producer 
Nike (www.nike.com), and electronics maker Vizio (www.vizio.com) are just a few companies 
that sell global products—products marketed in all countries essentially without any changes. 
For example, the iPad qualifies as a global product because of its highly standardized features 
and because of Apple’s global marketing strategy and globally recognized brand.
Global products and global competition characterize many industries and markets, including 
semiconductors (Intel, Philips), aircraft (Airbus, Boeing), construction equipment (Caterpillar, 
Mitsubishi), automobiles (Toyota, Volkswagen), financial services (Citicorp, HSBC), air travel 
(Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines), accounting services (Ernst & Young, KPMG), consumer goods 
(Procter & Gamble, Unilever), and fast food (KFC, McDonald’s). The globalization of markets 
is important to international business because of the benefits it offers companies. Let’s now look 
briefly at each of those benefits.
REduCES MARkETinG COSTS Companies that sell global products can reduce costs by 
standardizing certain marketing activities. A company selling a global consumer good, such as 
shampoo, can make an identical product for the global market and then simply design different 
packaging to account for the language spoken in each market. Companies can achieve further 
cost savings by keeping an ad’s visual component the same for all markets but dubbing TV ads 
and translating print ads into local languages.

cultural, political, and technological 
interdependence among national 
institutions and economies.

36  
part 1 • Global business environment
CREATES nEw MARkET OPPORTuniTiES A company that sells a global product can explore 
opportunities abroad if its home market is small or becomes saturated. China holds enormous 
potential for online business with more than 500 million Internet users, which is greater than the 
population of the entire United States. But while more than 70 percent of people in the United 
States actively surf the web, only around 38 percent of people in China do.8 So as time goes on, 
more and more Chinese citizens will go online to research and purchase products. The appeal 
of reaching such a vast audience drives firms from relatively small countries to explore doing 
business in the Chinese market.
LEvELS unEvEn inCOME STREAMS A company that sells a product with universal, but 
seasonal, appeal can use international sales to level its income stream. By supplementing 
domestic sales with international sales, the company can reduce or eliminate wide variations in 
sales between seasons and steady its cash flow. For example, a firm that produces suntan and 
sunblock lotions can match product distribution with the summer seasons in the northern and 
southern hemispheres in alternating fashion—thereby steadying its income from these global, 
yet highly seasonal, products.
LOCAL BuyERS’ nEEdS In the pursuit of the potential benefits of global markets, managers 
must constantly monitor the match between the firm’s products and markets in order to not 
overlook the needs of buyers. The benefit of serving customers with an adapted product may 
outweigh the benefit of a standardized one. For instance, soft drinks, fast food, and other 
consumer goods are global products that continue to penetrate markets around the world. 
But sometimes these products require small modifications to better suit local tastes. In 
southern Japan, Coca-Cola (www.cocacola.com) sweetens its traditional formula to compete 
with the sweeter-tasting Pepsi (www.pepsi.com). In India, where cows are sacred and the 
consumption of beef is taboo, McDonald’s (www.mcdonalds.com) markets the “Maharaja 
Mac”—two all-mutton patties on a sesame-seed bun with all the usual toppings.
GLOBAL SuSTAinABiLiTy Another need that multinationals must consider is the need among all 
the world’s citizens for sustainability—development that meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.9 Most companies 
today operate in an environment of increased transparency and scrutiny regarding their business 
activities. The rise of social media is partly responsible for this trend. Concerned individuals and 
nongovernmental organizations will very quickly use Internet media to call out any firm caught 
harming the environment or society.
For years, forward-looking businesses have employed the motto, “reduce, reuse, and 
 recycle.” The idea is to reduce the use of resources and waste, reuse resources with more than a 
single-use lifespan, and recycle what cannot be reduced or reused. The most dedicated manag-
ers and firms promote sustainable communities by adding to that motto, “redesign and reimag-
ine.” This means redesigning products and processes for sustainability and reimagining how a 
product is designed and used to lessen its environmental impact.10 To read more about the call 
for more sustainable business practices, see this chapter’s Global Sustainability feature, titled 
“Three Markets, Three Strategies.”
Globalization of Production
Globalization of production refers to the dispersal of production activities to locations that help 
a company achieve its cost-minimization or quality-maximization objectives for a good or ser-
vice. This includes the sourcing of key production inputs (such as raw materials or products for 
assembly) as well as the international outsourcing of services. Let’s now explore the benefits 
that companies obtain from the globalization of production.
ACCESS LOwER-COST wORkERS Global production activities allow companies to reduce 
overall production costs through access to low-cost labor. For decades, companies located their 
factories in low-wage nations in order to churn out all kinds of goods, including toys, small 
appliances, inexpensive electronics, and textiles. Yet whereas moving production to low-cost 
locales traditionally meant production of goods almost exclusively, it increasingly applies to the 
production of services such as accounting and research. Although most services must be produced 
where they are consumed, some services can be performed at remote locations where labor costs

generations to meet their own 
needs.

are lower. Many European and U.S. businesses have moved their customer service and other 
nonessential operations to places as far away as India to slash costs by as much as 60 percent.
ACCESS TEChniCAL ExPERTiSE Companies also produce goods and services abroad to benefit 
from technical know-how. Film Roman (www.filmroman.com) produces the TV series The 
Simpsons, but it provides key poses and step-by-step frame directions to AKOM Production 
Company (www.akomkorea.com) in Seoul, South Korea. AKOM then fills in the remaining 
poses and links them into an animated whole. But there are bumps along the way, says animation 
director Mark Kirkland. In one middle-of-the-night phone call, Kirkland was explaining to the 
Koreans how to draw a shooting gun. “They don’t allow guns in Korea; it’s against the law,” says 
Kirkland. “So they were calling me [asking]: ‘How does a gun work?’” Kirkland and others put 
up with such cultural differences and phone calls at odd hours to tap a highly qualified pool of 
South Korean animators.11
ACCESS PROduCTiOn inPuTS Globalization of production allows companies to access 
resources that are unavailable or more costly at home. The quest for natural resources draws 
many companies into international markets. Japan, for example, is a small, densely populated 
island nation with very few natural resources of its own—especially forests. But Japan’s largest 
paper company, Nippon Seishi, does more than simply import wood pulp. The company owns 
huge forests and corresponding processing facilities in Australia, Canada, and the United 
States. This gives the firm not only access to an essential resource but also control over earlier 
stages in the papermaking process. As a result, the company is guaranteed a steady flow of its 
key ingredient (wood pulp) that is less subject to the swings in prices and supply associated 
with buying pulp on the open market. Likewise, to access cheaper energy resources used in 
manufacturing, a variety of Japanese firms are relocating production to China and Vietnam, 
where energy costs are lower than in Japan.

• Toyota focused on the environment in its developed mar-
kets. After extensively researching gas-electric hybrid tech-
nologies, Toyota launched the Prius. As Motor Trend’s Car of 
the Year, the Prius drove Toyota’s profits to record highs and 
gave it a “green” image.
• Shree Cement faced limited access to low-cost energy in 
India’s emerging market. So it developed the world’s most 
energy-efficient process for making its products. The world’s 
leading cement companies now visit Shree to learn from its 
innovations in energy usage.

A company adapts its business strategy to the nuances of the 
market it enters. The world’s population of 7 billion people lives in 
three different types of markets:
• Developed Markets These include the world’s established 
 consumer markets, around one billion people. The population is 
solidly middle class, and people can consume almost any prod-
uct desired. The infrastructure is highly developed and efficient.
• Emerging Markets These markets, around two billion 
 people, are racing to catch up to developed nations. The 
population is migrating to cities for better pay and is over-
loading cities’ infrastructures. Rising incomes are increasing 
global demand for resources and basic products.
• Traditional Markets Globalization has bypassed these markets, 
nearly four billion people. The population is mostly rural, the 
infrastructure is very poor, and there is little credit or collateral. 
People have almost no legal protections, and corruption prevails.
Like business strategy, sustainability strategies reflect local con-
ditions. Examples of businesses working toward sustainability in 
these three markets include the following:

Forces Driving Globalization
Two main forces underlie the globalization of markets and production: falling barriers to trade 
and investment and technological innovation. These two features, more than anything else, are 
increasing competition among nations by leveling the global business playing field. Greater 
competition is driving companies worldwide into more direct confrontation and cooperation. 
Local industries once isolated by time and distance are increasingly accessible to large inter-
national companies based many thousands of miles away. Some small and medium-sized local 
firms are compelled to cooperate with one another or with larger international firms to remain 
competitive. Other local businesses revitalize themselves in a bold attempt to survive the com-
petitive onslaught. And on a global scale, consolidation is occurring as former competitors in 
many industries link up to challenge others on a worldwide basis. Let’s now explore the pivotal 
roles of these two forces driving globalization.
Falling Barriers to Trade and investment
In 1947, political leaders of 23 nations (12 developed and 11 developing economies) made 
history when they created the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)—a treaty 
designed to promote free trade by reducing tariffs and nontariff barriers to international 
trade. Tariffs are essentially taxes levied on traded goods, and nontariff barriers are limits on 
the quantity of an imported product. The treaty was successful in its early years. After four 
 decades, world merchandise trade had grown 20 times larger, and average tariffs had fallen from 
40 percent to 5 percent.
Significant progress occurred again with a 1994 revision of the GATT treaty. Nations that 
had signed on to the treaty further reduced average tariffs on merchandise trade and lowered sub-
sidies (government financial support) for agricultural products. The treaty’s revision also clearly 
defined intellectual property rights. This gave protection to copyrights (including computer 
programs, databases, sound recordings, and films), trademarks and service marks, and patents 
(including trade secrets and know-how). A major flaw of the original GATT was that it lacked 
the power to enforce world trade rules. Thus, the creation of the World Trade Organization was 
likely the greatest accomplishment of the GATT revision.
wORLd TRAdE ORGAnizATiOn The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the international 
organization that enforces the rules of international trade. The three main goals of the WTO 
(www.wto.org) are to help the free flow of trade, help negotiate the further opening of markets,

and settle trade disputes among its members. It is the power of the WTO to settle trade disputes 
that sets it apart from its predecessor, the GATT. The various WTO agreements are essentially 
contracts between member nations that commit them to maintaining fair and open trade 
policies. Offenders must realign their trade policies according to WTO guidelines or face fines 
and, perhaps, trade sanctions (penalties). Because of its ability to penalize offending nations, 
the WTO’s dispute-settlement system truly is the spine of the global trading system. The WTO 
replaced the institution of GATT but absorbed all of the former GATT agreements. Thus, 
the GATT institution no longer officially exists. Today, the WTO recognizes 159 members and 
25 “observers.”
The WTO launched a new round of negotiations in Doha, Qatar, in late 2001. The renewed 
negotiations were designed to lower trade barriers further and to help poor nations in particular. 
Agricultural subsidies that rich countries pay to their own farmers are worth $1 billion per day—
more than six times the value of their combined aid budgets to poor nations. Because 70 percent 
of poor nations’ exports are agricultural products and textiles, wealthy nations had intended to 
further open these and other labor-intensive industries. Poor nations were encouraged to reduce 
tariffs among themselves and were supposed to receive help in integrating themselves into the 
global trading system.
Although the Doha round was to conclude by the end of 2004, negotiations are proceeding 
very slowly. In December of 2013 negotiators agreed to improve “trade facilitation” by reducing 
red tape at borders and setting standards for customs and the movement of goods internationally. 
The rather modest agreement marks the first significant achievement for the Doha round. Still, 
no agreement was reached on agricultural trade issues, tariffs, or quotas.12
OThER inTERnATiOnAL ORGAnizATiOnS Two other institutions play leading roles in 
fostering globalization. The World Bank is an agency created to provide financing for national 
economic development efforts. The initial purpose of the World Bank (www.worldbank.org) 
was to finance European reconstruction following the Second World War. The Bank later shifted 
its focus to the general financial needs of developing countries, and today it finances many 
economic development projects in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an agency created to regulate fixed exchange 
rates and to enforce the rules of the international monetary system. Among the purposes of the 
IMF (www.imf.org) are promoting international monetary cooperation, facilitating the expan-
sion and balanced growth of international trade, avoiding competitive exchange devaluation, and 
making financial resources temporarily available to members.
REGiOnAL TRAdE AGREEMEnTS In addition to the WTO, smaller groups of nations are 
integrating their economies by fostering trade and boosting cross-border investment. For 
example, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) gathers three nations (Canada, 
Mexico, and the United States) into a free-trade bloc. The more ambitious European Union (EU) 
combines 28 countries. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) consists of 21 member 
economies committed to creating a free-trade zone around the Pacific. The aims of each of these 
smaller trade pacts are similar to those of the WTO but are regional in nature. Moreover, some 
nations encourage regional pacts because of recent resistance to worldwide trade agreements.
TRAdE And nATiOnAL OuTPuT Together the WTO agreements and regional pacts have 
boosted world trade and cross-border investment significantly. Trade theory tells us that 
openness to trade helps a nation produce a greater amount of output. Map 1.1 illustrates that 
growth in national output over a recent 10-year period has been significantly positive. Economic 
growth has been greater in nations that have recently become more open to trade, such as China, 
India, and Russia, than it has been in many other countries. Much of South America is also 
growing rapidly, whereas Africa’s experience is mixed. This relation between trade and output 
has persisted despite a drop in nations’ economic growth rates due to the global financial crises 
of recent years.
Let’s take a moment in our discussion to define a few terms that we will encounter time and 
again throughout this book. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of all goods and ser-
vices produced by a domestic economy over a one-year period. GDP excludes a nation’s income 
generated from exports, imports, and the international operations of its companies. We can speak 
in terms of world GDP when we sum all individual nations’ GDP figures. GDP is a somewhat

narrower figure than gross national product (GNP)—the value of all goods and services pro-
duced by a country’s domestic and international activities over a one-year period. A country’s 
GDP or GNP per capita is simply its GDP or GNP divided by its population.
Technological innovation
Although falling barriers to trade and investment encourage globalization, technology is acceler-
ating its pace. Innovations in information technology and transportation methods are making it 
easier, faster, and less costly to move data, goods, and equipment around the world. Consumers 
use technology to reach out to the world on the Internet—gathering and sending information and 
purchasing all kinds of goods and services. Companies use technology to acquire materials and 
products from distant lands and to sell goods and services abroad.
When businesses or consumers use technology to conduct transactions, they engage in 
e-business (e-commerce)—the use of computer networks to purchase, sell, or exchange prod-
ucts; to service customers; and to collaborate with partners. E-business is making it easier for 
companies to make their products abroad, not simply to import and export finished goods. Let’s 
examine several innovations that have had a considerable impact on globalization.
E-MAiL And vidEOCOnFEREnCinG Operating across borders and time zones complicates 
the job of coordinating and controlling business activities. But technology can speed the flow 
of information and ease the tasks of coordination and control. E-mail is an indispensable tool 
that managers use to stay in contact with international operations and to respond quickly to 
important matters.
Videoconferencing allows managers in different locations to meet in virtual face-to-face 
meetings. Primary reasons for 25 to 30 percent annual growth in videoconferencing include 
the lower cost of bandwidth (communication channels) used to transmit information, the lower 
cost of equipment, and the rising cost of travel for businesses. Videoconferencing equipment 
can cost as little as $5,000 and as much as $340,000. A company that does not require ongoing 
video-conferencing can pay even less by renting the facilities and equipment of a local confer-
ence center.13 Those willing to videoconference on a computer, tablet, or smartphone (which 
includes most people) can explore iMeet (www.imeet.com), which charges $9 per month for 
its most  basic service.14 And, of course, people with the simplest video conferencing needs can 
download and use Skype (www.skype.com) or Apple’s (www.apple.com) FaceTime application 
for free.
ThE inTERnET Companies use the Internet to quickly and cheaply contact managers in distant 
locations—for example, to inquire about production runs, revise sales strategies, and check on 
distribution bottlenecks. They also use the Internet to achieve longer-term goals, such as sharpen 
their forecasting, lower their inventories, and improve communication with suppliers. The lower 
cost of reaching an international customer base especially benefits small firms, which were 
among the first to use the Internet as a global marketing tool. Additional gains arise from the 
ability of the Internet to cut postproduction costs by decreasing the number of intermediaries a 
product passes through on its way to the customer. Eliminating intermediaries greatly benefits 
online sellers of all sorts of products, including books, music, travel services, software, and so on.
Some innovative companies use online competitions to attract fresh ideas from the bright-
est minds worldwide. InnoCentive (www.innocentive.com) connects companies and institutions 
seeking solutions to difficult problems by using a global network of 300,000 creative thinkers. 
These engineers, scientists, inventors, and businesspeople with expertise in life sciences, en-
gineering, chemistry, math, computer science, and entrepreneurship compete to solve some of 
the world’s toughest problems in return for significant financial awards. InnoCentive is open to 
anyone, is available in seven languages, and pays cash awards that range from $5,000 to more 
than $1 million.15
COMPAny inTRAnETS And ExTRAnETS Internal company websites and information networks 
(intranets) give employees access to company data using personal computers. A  particularly 
effective marketing tool on Volvo Car Corporation’s (www.volvocars.com) intranet is a quarter-
by-quarter database of marketing and sales information. The cycle begins when headquarters 
submits its corporate-wide marketing plan to Volvo’s intranet. Marketing managers at each 
subsidiary worldwide then select those activities that apply to their own market, develop their

marketing plan, and submit it to the database. This allows managers in every market to view every 
other subsidiary’s marketing plan and to adapt relevant aspects to their own plan. In essence, the 
entire system acts as a tool for the sharing of best practices across all of Volvo’s markets.
Extranets give distributors and suppliers access to a company’s database so they can place 
orders or restock inventories electronically and automatically. These networks permit interna-
tional companies (along with their suppliers and buyers) to respond to internal and external 
conditions more quickly and more appropriately.
AdvAnCEMEnTS in TRAnSPORTATiOn TEChnOLOGiES Retailers worldwide rely on imports 
to stock their storerooms with finished goods and to supply factories with raw materials and 
intermediate products. Innovation in the shipping industry is helping globalize markets and 
production by making shipping more efficient and dependable. In the past, a cargo ship would 
sit in port up to 10 days while it was unloaded one pallet at a time. But because cargo today is 
loaded onto a ship in 20- and 40-foot containers that are quickly unloaded onto railcars or truck 
chassis at the final destination, a 700-foot cargo ship is routinely unloaded in just 15 hours.
Operation of cargo ships is now simpler and safer due to computerized charts that pinpoint a 
ship’s movements on the high seas using Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. Combining 
GPS with radio frequency identification (RFID) technology allows continuous monitoring of 
individual containers from port of departure to destination. RFID can tell whether a container’s 
doors are opened and closed on its journey and can send an alert if a container deviates from its 
planned route.
These types of advancements also allowed Hewlett-Packard (www.hp.com) to seize the 
rewards of globalization when it built a new low-cost computer server for businesses. HP dis-
persed its design and production activities throughout a specialized manufacturing system across 
five Pacific Rim nations and India. This helped the company minimize labor costs, taxes, and 
shipping delays yet maximize productivity when designing, building, and distributing its new 
product. Companies use such innovative production and distribution techniques to squeeze inef-
ficiencies out of their international operations and boost their competitiveness.

Measuring Globalization
Although we intuitively feel that our world is becoming smaller, researchers have created 
ways to measure the extent of globalization scientifically. One index of globalization is the one 
 created by the KOF Swiss Economic Institute (www.kof.ethz.ch). This index ranks nations on 
23 variables within three dimensions: economic globalization (trade and investment volumes, 
trade and capital restrictions), social globalization (dissemination of information and ideas), and 
political globalization (political cooperation with other countries).16
By incorporating a wide variety of variables, the globalization index attempts to cut through 
cycles occurring in any single category and capture the broad nature of globalization. Table 1.1 
shows the 10 highest-ranking nations according to the KOF Index of Globalization. European 
nations occupy 9 of the top 10 positions, with smaller nations clearly dominating the rank-
ings. The city-state of Singapore is the only Asian nation listed in the top 10. The United States 
 appears in 32nd place overall, and ranks 87th in economic globalization, 28th in social global-
ization, and 18th in political globalization. Large nations often do not make it into the higher 
ranks of globalization indices because a large home market means they tend to depend less on 
external trade and investment.
The world’s least-globalized nations account for around half the world’s population and 
are found in Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Some of the 
least-globalized nations are characterized by never-ending political unrest and corruption 
(Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Venezuela). Other nations with large agricultural sectors face trade

barriers in developed countries and are subject to highly volatile prices on commodity markets 
(Brazil, China, and India). Still others are heavily dependent on oil exports but are plagued 
by erratic prices in energy markets (Iran and Venezuela). Kenya has suffered from recurring 
droughts, terrorism, and burdensome visa regulations that hurt tourism. Finally, Turkey and 
Egypt, along with the entire Middle East, suffer from continued concerns over violence and 
social unrest, high barriers to trade and investment, and heavy government involvement in the 
economy. To deepen their global links, these nations will need to make great strides forward in 
their economic, social, and political environments.

Debate Over Jobs and Wages
So far we have read how globalization benefits companies and nations. But not everyone views 
globalization as having only positive effects. The following pages explain the main arguments of 
those opposed to globalization and the responses of those in favor of it. Each side in the debate 
over globalization tends to hold up results of social and economic studies that it says support its 
arguments. But many organizations that publish studies on globalization have political agendas, 
which can make objective consideration of their findings difficult. A group’s aims may influence 
the selection of the data to analyze, the time period to study, the nations to examine, and so forth.
Be that as it may, we open our coverage of the globalization debate with an important topic 
for both developed and developing countries—the effect of globalization on jobs and wages. We 
begin with the arguments of those against globalization and then turn our attention to how sup-
porters of globalization respond.
Against Globalization
Groups opposed to globalization blame it for eroding standards of living and ruining ways of 
life. Specifically, they say globalization eliminates jobs and lowers wages in developed nations 
and exploits workers in developing countries. Let’s explore each of these arguments.
ELiMinATES JOBS in dEvELOPEd nATiOnS Some groups claim that globalization eliminates 
manufacturing jobs in developed nations. They criticize the practice of sending good-paying 
manufacturing jobs abroad to developing countries where wages are a fraction of the cost

for international firms. They argue that a label reading “Made in China” translates to “Not 
Made Here.” Although critics admit that importing products from China (or another low-wage 
nation) lowers consumer prices for televisions, sporting goods, and so on, they say this is little 
consolation for workers who lose their jobs.
To illustrate their argument, globalization critics point to the activities of big-box retailers 
such as Costco (www.costco.com) and Walmart (www.walmart.com). It is difficult to overstate the 
power of these retail giants and symbols of globalization. Some say that by relentlessly pursuing 
low-cost goods, these retailers force their suppliers to move to China and other low-wage nations.
LOwERS wAGES in dEvELOPEd nATiOnS Opposition groups say globalization causes 
worker dislocation that gradually lowers wages. They allege that, when a manufacturing job is 
lost in a wealthy nation, the new job (assuming new work is found) pays less than the previous 
one. Those opposed to globalization say this decreases employee loyalty, employee morale, and 
job security. They say this causes people to fear globalization and any additional lowering of 
trade barriers.
Big-box retailers also come under fire in this discussion. Globalization critics say powerful 
retailers continually force manufacturers in low-wage nations to accept lower profits so that the 
retailers can slash prices to consumers. As a result of these business practices, critics charge, 
powerful retailers force down wages and working conditions worldwide.
ExPLOiTS wORkERS in dEvELOPinG nATiOnS Critics charge that globalization and 
international outsourcing exploit workers in low-wage nations. One notable critic of globalization, 
Naomi Klein, vehemently opposes the outsourced call center jobs of Western companies. Klein 
says these jobs force young Asians to disguise their nationality, adopt fake Midwestern accents, 
and work nights when their U.S. customers are awake halfway around the world.17
Figure 1.2 illustrates that western firms can outsource such work to emerging markets for a 
fraction of what they pay at home. So long as such economic disparities exist, international out-
sourcing will continue to be popular. The salary of a programmer in the United States is nearly 
four times that of one in some eastern European nations, including Lithuania.
Globalization critics also say companies locate operations to developing nations where 
 labor regulations are least restrictive and, therefore, least costly. They argue that this diminishes 
labor’s bargaining power and labor laws in all countries as nations compete to attract interna-
tional firms.
For Globalization
Supporters of globalization credit it with improving standards of living and making possible new 
ways of life. They argue that globalization increases wealth and efficiency in all nations, gener-
ates labor market flexibility in developed nations, and advances the economies of developing 
nations. Let’s examine each of these arguments.

squeezing inefficiencies out of the retail supply chain, powerful global retailers help restrain 
inflation and boost productivity. Some economists predict that removing all remaining barriers 
to free trade would significantly boost worldwide income and greatly benefit developing nations.
GEnERATES LABOR MARkET FLExiBiLiTy in dEvELOPEd nATiOnS Globalization supporters 
believe globalization creates positive benefits by generating labor market flexibility in developed 
nations. Some claim that there are benefits from worker dislocation, or “churning” as it is called 
when there is widespread job turnover throughout an economy. Flexible labor markets allow 
workers to be redeployed rapidly to sectors of the economy where they are highly valued and in 
demand. This also allows employees, particularly young workers, to change jobs easily with few 
negative effects. For instance, a young person can gain experience and skills with an initial employer 
and then move to a different job that provides a better match between employee and employer.
AdvAnCES ThE ECOnOMiES OF dEvELOPinG nATiOnS Those in favor of globalization 
argue that globalization and international outsourcing help to advance developing nations’ 
economies. India initially became attractive as a location for software-writing operations because 
of its low-cost, well-trained, English-speaking technicians. Later, young graduates who would 
not become doctors and lawyers found bright futures in telephone call centers that provide all 
sorts of customer services. More recently, jobs in business-process outsourcing (including 
financial, accounting, payroll, and benefits services) is elevating living standards in India.
Today, the relentless march of globalization is bringing call center jobs to the Philippines. 
Young Filipinos possess an excellent education, a solid grasp of the English language and U.S. 
culture, and a neutral accent. In fact, top Indian firms, such as Wipro (www.wipro.com), now 
have substantial operations in the Philippines and happily pay more, not less, than what they 
would need to pay workers in India. The work is not considered low-paying by any means, and 
instead represents a solid, middle-class job.18
The International Labor Organization (www.ilo.org) found no evidence that nations with a 
strong union presence suffered any loss of investment in their export-processing zones (EPZs)—
special regions that allow tariff-free importing and exporting. And the World Bank found that 
the higher occupational safety and health conditions an EPZ had in place, the greater the amount 
of foreign investment it attracted.19 The evidence suggests that economic openness and foreign 
investment advances the economies of developing nations.
Summary of the Jobs and wages debate
All parties appear to agree that globalization eliminates some jobs in a nation but creates jobs 
in other sectors of the nation’s economy. Yet, although some people lose their jobs and find new 
employment, it can be very difficult for others to find new work. The real point of difference 
 between the two sides in the debate, it seems, is whether overall gains that (may or may not) 
accrue to national economies are worth the lost livelihoods that individuals (may or may not) 
suffer. Those in favor of globalization say individual pain is worth the collective gain, whereas 
those against globalization say it is not.

Debate Over Income Inequality
Perhaps no controversy swirling around globalization is more complex than the debate over 
its effect on income inequality. Here, we focus on three main aspects of the debate: inequality 
within nations, inequality between nations, and global inequality.
inequality within nations
The first aspect of the inequality debate is whether globalization is increasing income inequality 
among people within nations. Opponents of globalization argue that freer trade and investment 
allows international companies to close factories in high-wage, developed nations and to move 

 
Chapter 1 • Globalization  47
them to low-wage, developing nations. They argue that this increases the wage gap between 
white-collar and blue-collar occupations in rich nations.
Two studies of developed and developing nations find contradictory evidence on this argu-
ment. The first study, of 38 countries over almost 30 years, supports the increasing inequality 
argument. The study found that as a nation increases its openness to trade, income growth 
among the poorest 40 percent of a nation’s population declines, whereas income growth among 
other groups increases.20 The second study, of 80 countries over 40 years, failed to support the 
increasing inequality argument. It found that incomes of the poor rise one-for-one with overall 
economic growth and concluded that the poor benefit from international trade along with the 
rest of a nation.21 The mixed findings of these two studies are typical of a large set of research 
examining inequality between developed and developing nations.
Two studies of developing nations only are more consistent in their findings. One study 
found that an increase in the ratio of trade to national output of 1 percent raised average income 
levels by 0.5 to 2 percent. Another study showed that incomes of the poor kept pace with growth 
in average incomes in economies (and periods) of fast trade integration, but that the poor fell 
behind during periods of declining openness.22 Results of these two studies suggest that, by inte-
grating their economies into the global economy, developing nations (by far the nations with the 
most to gain) can boost the incomes of their poorest citizens.
A new approach being developed takes a multidimensional view of poverty and deprivation. 
Proponents of this approach say that the problem with focusing on income alone is that higher 
income does not necessarily translate into better health or nutrition. The new approach examines 
10 basic factors, including whether the family home has a decent toilet and electricity service; 
whether children are enrolled in school; and whether family members are malnourished or must 
walk more than 30 minutes to obtain clean drinking water. A household is considered poor if it 
is deprived on over 30 percent of the indicators. This new approach reveals important differences 
among poor regions. For example, whereas material measures contribute more to poverty in 
 sub-Saharan Africa, malnutrition is a bigger factor in South Asia.23
inequality between nations
The second aspect of the inequality debate is whether globalization is widening the gap in 
 average incomes between rich and poor nations. If we compare average incomes in high-income 
countries with average incomes in middle- and low-income nations, we do find a widening gap. 
But averages conceal differences between nations.

part 1 • Global business environment
On closer inspection, it appears the gap between rich and poor nations is not occurring 
everywhere: One group of poor nations is closing the gap with rich economies, while a second 
group of poor countries is falling further behind. For example, China is narrowing the income 
gap between itself and the United States as measured by GDP per capita, but the gap between 
Africa and the United States is widening. China’s progress is no doubt a result of its integration 
with the world economy and annual economic growth rates of between 7 and 9 percent. Another 
emerging market, India, is also narrowing its income gap with the United States by embracing 
globalization.24
Developing countries that embrace globalization are increasing personal incomes,  extending 
life expectancies, and improving education systems. In addition, post-communist countries that 
welcomed world trade and investment experienced high growth rates in GDP per capita. But 
 nations that remain closed off from the world economy have performed far worse.
Global inequality
The third aspect of the inequality debate is whether globalization is increasing global 
 inequality—widening income inequality between all people of the world, no matter where 
they live. A recent study paints a promising picture of declining poverty. This study found 
that the percentage of the world’s population living on less than a dollar a day (a common 
poverty gauge) fell from 17 percent to just 7 percent over a 30-year period, which reduced 
the number of people in poverty by roughly 200 million.25 Yet, a widely cited study by the 
World Bank finds that the percent of world population living on less than a dollar a day fell 
from 33 percent to 18 percent over a 20-year period, which reduced the number of people in 
poverty from 1.5 billion to 1.1 billion.26
For a variety of reasons, the real picture likely lies somewhere in between these two studies’ 
estimates. For example, whereas the World Bank study used population figures for developing 
countries only, the first study used the entire world’s population in its analyses, which lowered 
poverty estimates, all else being equal. What is important is that most experts agree that global 
inequality has fallen, although they disagree on the extent of the fall.
What it is like to live on less than a dollar a day in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, or 
elsewhere is too difficult for most of us to comprehend. The continent of Africa presents the 
most  pressing problem. Home to 13 percent of the world’s population, Africa accounts for 
just 3 percent of world GDP. Rich nations realize they cannot sit idly by while so many of the 
world’s people live under such conditions.
What can be done to help the world’s poor? First of all, rich nations could increase the 
amount of foreign aid they give to poor nations—foreign aid as a share of donor country GDP 
is at historically low levels. Second, rich nations can accelerate the process of forgiving some 
of the debt burdens of the most heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs). The HIPC initiative is 
committed to reducing the debt burdens of the world’s poorest countries. This initiative would 
enable these countries to spend money on social services and greater integration with the global 
economy instead of on interest payments on debt.27
SuMMARy OF ThE inCOME inEquALiTy dEBATE For the debate over inequality within 
nations, studies suggest that developing nations can boost incomes of their poorest citizens by 
embracing globalization and integrating themselves into the global economy. In the debate over 
inequality between nations, nations open to world trade and investment appear to grow faster 
than rich nations do. Meanwhile, economies that remain sheltered from the global economy 
tend to be worse off. Finally, regarding the debate over global inequality, although experts agree 
inequality has fallen in recent decades, they disagree on the extent of the drop.

Debate Over Culture, Sovereignty, and the 
Environment
Coverage of the globalization debate would be incomplete without examining several additional 
topics in the globalization debate. Let’s now take a look at globalization’s effect on a nation’s 
culture, sovereignty, and physical environment.
Globalization and Culture
National culture is a strong shaper of a people’s values, attitudes, customs, beliefs, and com-
munication. Whether globalization eradicates cultural differences between groups of people or 
reinforces cultural uniqueness is a hotly debated topic.
Globalization’s detractors say that it homogenizes our world and destroys our rich 
 diversity of cultures. They say that in some drab, new world we all will wear the same clothes 
bought at the same brand-name shops, eat the same foods at the same brand-name restaurants, 
and watch the same movies made by the same production companies. Blame is usually placed 
squarely on the largest multinational companies in consumer goods, which are typically based 
in the United States.
Supporters argue that globalization allows us all to profit from our differing circumstances 
and skills. Trade allows countries to specialize in producing the goods and services they can 
produce most efficiently. Nations can then trade with each other to obtain goods and services 
they desire but do not produce. In this way, France still produces many of the world’s finest 
wines, South Africa yields much of the world’s diamonds, and Japan continues to design some 
of the world’s finest-engineered automobiles. Other nations then trade their goods and services 
with these countries to enjoy the wines, diamonds, and automobiles that they do not, or cannot, 
produce. To learn more about the interplay between culture and globalization, see this chapter’s 
Culture Matters feature, titled, “The Culture Debate.”
Globalization and national Sovereignty
National sovereignty generally involves the idea that a nation-state (1) is autonomous, (2) can 
freely select its government, (3) cannot intervene in the affairs of other nations, (4) can con-
trol movements across its borders, and (5) can enter into binding international agreements. 
Opposition groups allege that globalization erodes national sovereignty and encroaches on 
The debate over globalization’s influence on culture evokes strong 
opinions. Here are a few main arguments in this debate:
• Material Desire Critics say globalization fosters the 
 “Coca-Colanization” of nations through advertising 
 campaigns that promote material desire. They also argue 
that global consumer-goods companies destroy cultural 
diversity (especially in developing nations) by putting local 
companies out of business.
• Artistic Influence Evidence suggests, however, that the 
cultures of developing nations are thriving and that the influ-
ence of their music, art, and literature has grown (not shrunk) 
throughout the past century. African cultures, for example, 
have influenced the works of artists including Picasso, the 
Beatles, and Sting.
• Western Values International businesses reach far and wide 
through the Internet, global media, increased business travel, 
and local marketing. Critics say local values and traditions 
are being replaced by U.S. companies promoting “Western” 
values.
• A Force for Good On the positive side, globalization tends 
to foster two important values: tolerance and diversity. 
Advocates say nations should be more tolerant of oppos-
ing viewpoints and should welcome diversity among their 
peoples. This view interprets globalization as a potent force 
for good in the world.
• Deeper Values Globalization can cause consumer purchases 
and economic ideologies to converge, but these are rather 
superficial aspects of culture. Deeper values that embody 
the essence of cultures may be more resistant to a global 
consumer culture.

the authority of local and state governments. Supporters disagree, saying that globalization 
spreads democracy worldwide and that national sovereignty must be viewed from a long-term 
perspective.
GLOBALizATiOn: MEnACE TO dEMOCRACy? A main argument leveled against globalization 
is that it empowers supranational institutions at the expense of national governments. It is not in 
dispute that the WTO, the IMF, and the United Nations are led by appointed, not democratically 
elected, representatives. What is debatable, however, is whether these organizations unduly 
impose their will on the citizens of sovereign nations. Critics argue that such organizations 
undercut democracy and individual liberty by undermining the political and legal authority of 
national, regional, and local governments.
Opponents of globalization also take issue with the right of national political authori-
ties to enter into binding international agreements on behalf of citizens. Critics charge that 
such agreements violate the rights of local and state governments. For example, state and 
local governments in the United States had no role in creating the NAFTA. Yet, WTO rules 
require the U.S. federal government to take all available actions (including enacting preemp-
tive legislation or withdrawing funding) to force local and state compliance with WTO terms. 
Protesters say that such requirements directly attack the rights and authority of local and state 
governments.28
GLOBALizATiOn: GuARdiAn OF dEMOCRACy? Globalization supporters argue that an 
amazing consequence of globalization has been the spread of democracy worldwide. In recent 
decades, the people of many nations have become better educated, better informed, and more 
empowered. Supporters say globalization has not sent democracy spiraling into decline but 
instead has been instrumental in spreading democracy to the world.
Backers of globalization also contend that it is instructive to take a long-term view on the 
issue of national sovereignty. Witnessing a sovereign state’s scope of authority altered is noth-
ing new, as governments have long given up trying to control issues they could not resolve. 
In the mid-1600s, governments in Europe surrendered their authority over religion because 
attempts to control it undermined overall political stability. Also, Greece in 1832, Albania in 
1913, and the former Yugoslavian states in the 1990s had to protect minorities in exchange for 
international recognition. And over the past 50 years, the United Nations has made significant 
progress on worthy issues such as genocide, torture, slavery, refugees, women’s rights, chil-
dren’s rights, forced labor, and racial discrimination. Like the loss of sovereignty over these 
Making everything from 99-cent hamburgers (McDonald’s) to 
$150 million jumbo jets (Boeing), managers of global companies 
must overcome obstacles when competing in unfamiliar markets. 
Global managers acknowledge certain common threads in their 
 approaches to management and offer the following advice:
• Communicate Effectively Cultural differences in business 
relationships and etiquette are central to global business and 
require cross-cultural competency. Effective global manag-
ers welcome uniqueness and ambiguity while demonstrating 
flexibility, respect, and empathy.
• Know the Customer Successful managers understand how a 
company’s different products serve the needs of international 
customers. Then, they ensure that the company remains flex-
ible and capable enough to customize products that meet 
those needs.
• Emphasize Global Awareness Good global manag-
ers integrate foreign markets into business strategy from 
the outset. They ensure that products and services are 
designed and built with global markets in mind, and not 
used as dumping grounds for the home market’s outdated 
products.
• Market Effectively The world will beat a path to your door 
to buy your “better mousetrap” only if it knows about it. 
A poor marketing effort can cause great products to fade 
into  obscurity while an international marketing blunder can 
bring unwanted media attention. Top global managers match 
 quality products with excellent marketing.
• Monitor Global Markets Successful managers keep a 
 watchful eye on business environments for shifting political, 
legal, and socioeconomic conditions. They make obtaining 
accurate information a top priority.

issues, globalization supporters say lost sovereignty over some economic issues may actually 
enhance the greater good.29
Globalization and the Environment
Some environmental groups say globalization causes a “race to the bottom” in environmental 
conditions and regulations. Yet, studies show that pollution-intensive U.S. firms tend to invest in 
countries with stricter environmental standards. Many developing nations, including Argentina, 
Brazil, Malaysia, and Thailand, liberalized their foreign investment environment while simul-
taneously enacting stricter environmental legislation. If large international companies were 
eager to relocate to nations having poor environmental protection laws, they would not have 
invested in these countries for decades. Additional evidence that closed, protectionist econo-
mies are worse than open ones at protecting the environment includes Mexico before NAFTA, 
Brazil under military rule, and the former Warsaw Pact of communist nations—all of which had 
 extremely poor environmental records. Again, the evidence refutes claims that economic open-
ness and globalization lessen environmental standards.
Globalization opponents claim that western firms exploit lax environmental laws abroad to 
produce goods that are then exported back to the home countries. These claims have no factual 
basis and may only perpetuate a false image of corporations. In fact, less than five percent of 
U.S. firms invest in developing countries to obtain low-cost resources and then export finished 
products back to the United States.
Most international firms today support reasonable environmental laws because (if for 
no other reason) they want to expand future local markets for their goods and services. 
They recognize that healthy future markets require a sustainable approach to business 
 expansion. Companies today often examine a location for its potential as a future market 
as well as a production base. For additional insights into how managers today succeed by 
respecting  international markets, see the Manager’s Briefcase, titled, “The Keys to Global 
Success.”

The Global Business Environment
As we’ve already seen in this chapter, international business differs greatly from business in a 
purely domestic context. The most obvious contrast is that different nations can have entirely 
different societies and commercial environments. The best way to explain what makes interna-
tional business special is to introduce a model unique to this book—a model we call the global 
business environment. This model weaves together four distinct elements:
 1. The forces of globalization
 2. The international business environment
 3. Many national business environments
 4. International firm management

52  
part 1 • Global business environment
The model in Figure 1.3 identifies each of these elements and their subparts that together 
comprise the global business environment. Thinking about international business as occurring 
within this global system helps us to understand the complexities of international business and 
the interrelations between its distinct elements. Let’s preview each of the four main components 
in the global business environment.
Globalization is a potent force transforming our societies and commercial activities in 
countless ways. Globalization, and the pressures it creates, forces its way into each element 
shown in Figure 1.3. In this way, the drivers of globalization (technological innovation and 
falling trade and investment barriers) influence every aspect of the global business environ-
ment. The dynamic nature of globalization also creates increasing competition for all firms 
 everywhere, as managers begin to see the entire world as an opportunity. At home and abroad, 
firms must  remain vigilant to the fundamental societal and commercial changes that globaliza-
tion causes.
The international business environment influences how firms conduct their opera-
tions in both subtle and not-so-subtle ways. No business is entirely immune to events in the 
 international business environment, as evidenced by the long-term trend toward more porous 
national borders. The drivers of globalization are causing the flows of trade, investment, 
and capital to grow and to become more entwined—often causing firms to search simultane-
ously for production bases and new markets. Companies today must keep their fingers on 
the pulse of the international business environment to see how it may affect their business 
activities.

The Global Business 
Environment

 
Chapter 1 • Globalization  53
Each national business environment is composed of unique cultural, political, economic, 
and legal characteristics that define business activity within that nation’s borders. This set of 
national characteristics can differ greatly from country to country. But as nations open up and 
embrace globalization, their business environments are being transformed. Globalization can 
cause powerful synergies and enormous tensions to arise within and across various elements of 
a society. Company managers must be attentive to such nuances, adapting their products and 
practices as needed.
International firm management is vastly different from the management of a purely 
 domestic business. Companies must abide by the rules in every market in which they choose 
to operate. Therefore, the context of international business management is defined by the 
characteristics of national business environments. Because of widely dispersed production and 
marketing activities today, firms commonly interact with people in distant locations within 
the international business environment. Finally, managers and their firms are compelled to be 
knowledgeable about the nations in which they operate because of the integrating power of 
globalization. Businesses should try to anticipate events and forces that can affect their opera-
tions by closely monitoring globalization, national business environments, and the international 
business environment.
The Road Ahead for international Business
The coverage of international business in this book follows the model of the global business 
environment displayed in Figure 1.3. In this chapter, we learned how globalization is transform-
ing our world and how elements of the global business environment are becoming increasingly 
intertwined. As globalization penetrates deeper into the national context, every aspect of interna-
tional business management is being affected.
In Part 2 (Chapters 2 through 4), we explore how national business environments differ 
from one nation to another. We examine how people’s attitudes, values, beliefs, and institu-
tions differ from one culture to another and how this affects business. This part also covers how 
 nations differ in their political, economic, and legal systems. This material is placed early in the 
text because such differences between countries help frame subsequent topics and discussions, 
such as how companies modify business practices and strategies abroad. 
We describe major components of the international business environment in Part 3 
(Chapters 5 through 8) and Part 4 (Chapters 9 and 10). Our coverage begins with an examination 
of trade and investment theories and a discussion of why governments encourage or discourage 
these two forms of international business. We explore the process of regional economic integra-
tion around the world and outline its implications for international business. Finally, we discuss 
how events in global financial markets affect international business and how the global monetary 
system functions.
In Part 5 (Chapters 11 through 16), we cover ways in which international business manage-
ment differs from management of a purely domestic firm. We explain how a company creates 
an international strategy, organizes itself for international business, and analyzes and selects the 
markets it will pursue. We explore different potential entry modes and then discuss how a firm 
develops and markets products for specific nations, regions, or the entire world. We then cover 
how international companies manage their sometimes far-flung international operations. The 
book closes by discussing how international firms manage their human resources in the global 
business environment. 
This chapter has only introduced you to the study of international business—we hope you 
enjoy the rest of your journey!

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Identify the types of companies active in international business.
• Most international business is conducted by large multinational corporations (MNCs), 
which have great economic muscle and do deals often worth billions of dollars.
• Born global firms adopt a global perspective and conduct international business 
nearly from the start. They tend to have innovative cultures, knowledge-based 
 capabilities, and become international competitors in less than three years.
• Entrepreneurs and small firms benefit from the Internet and other technologies 
that help them overcome the hurdles of high advertising and distribution costs.
T
he main theme of this chapter is that the world’s national econo-
mies are becoming increasingly intertwined through the process 
of globalization. Cultural, political, economic, and legal events in 
one country increasingly affect the lives of people in other countries. 
Companies must pay attention to how changes in nations where 
they do business can affect operations. In this section, we briefly 
examine several important business implications of globalization.
harnessing Globalization’s Benefits
People opposed to globalization say it negatively affects wages 
and environmental protection, reduces political freedom, increases 
corruption, and inequitably rewards various groups. Yet there 
is  evidence that the most globalized nations have the stron-
gest  records on equality, the most robust protection of natural 
 resources, the most inclusive political systems, and the lowest 
levels of corruption. People in the most globalized nations also live 
the healthiest and longest lives, and women there have achieved 
the most social, educational, and economic progress.
One thing the debate over globalization has achieved is a 
dialogue on the merits and demerits of globalization. What has 
emerged is a more sober, less naïve notion of globalization. Those 
on each side of the debate understand that globalization can have 
positive effects on people’s lives, but that globalization cannot, 
by itself, alleviate the misery of the world’s poor. Both sides in the 
debate now often work together to harness the benefits of global-
ization while minimizing its costs.
intensified Competition
The two driving forces of globalization (lower trade and invest-
ment barriers and increased technological innovation) are taking 
 companies into previously isolated markets and increasing com-
petitive pressures worldwide. And innovation is unlikely to slow 
any time soon.
As the cost of computing power continues to fall and new tech-
nologies are developed, companies will find it easier and less costly 
to manage widely dispersed marketing activities and production 
facilities. Technological developments may even strengthen the 
case for outsourcing more professional jobs to low-cost locations. 
As competition intensifies, international companies are increasing 
their cooperation with suppliers and customers.
wages and Jobs
Some labor groups in wealthy nations contend that globalization 
is forcing companies to join the “race to the bottom” in terms 
of wages and benefits. But to attract investment, a location must 
offer low-cost, adequately skilled workers in an environment with 
 acceptable levels of social, political, and economic stability.
Rapid globalization of markets and production is making 
product delivery a complex engineering task. As companies cut 
costs by outsourcing activities, supply and distribution channels 
grow longer and more complex. Corporate logistics departments 
and logistics specialist firms are helping international companies 
 untangle lengthy supply chains, monitor shipping lanes, and fore-
cast weather patterns. High-wage logistics jobs represent the kind 
of high-value-added employment that results from the “churning” 
in labor markets caused by globalization.
The Policy Agenda
Countless actions could be taken by developed and developing 
nations to lessen the negative effects of globalization. The World 
Bank calls on rich countries to (1) open their markets to exports 
from developing countries, (2) slash their agricultural subsidies 
that hurt poor-country exports, and (3) increase  development aid, 
particularly in education and health. It calls on poor  countries to 
improve their investment climates and  improve social protection 
for poor people in a changing economic environment.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics (www.iie.com) 
proposed a policy agenda for rich nations on two fronts. On the do-
mestic front, it proposes (1) establishing on-the-job training to help 
workers cope with globalization, (2) offering “wage insurance” to 
workers forced by globalization to take a lower-paying job, (3) subsi-
dizing health insurance costs in case of lost work, and (4) improving 
education and lifetime learning. On the international front, it pro-
poses (1) better enforcing labor standards, (2) clarifying the relation 
between international trade and environmental agreements, and 
(3) reviewing the environmental implications of trade agreements.
Bottom Line For Business

 
Chapter 1 • Globalization  55
 LO2. Explain globalization and how it affects markets and production.
• Globalization is the trend toward greater economic, cultural, political, and 
 technological interdependence among national institutions and economies.
• The globalization of markets helps a company to (1) reduce costs by standardizing 
marketing activities, (2) explore international markets if the home market is small or 
saturated, and (3) level income streams.
• The globalization of production helps a company to (1) access low-cost labor and 
 become more price competitive, (2) access technical know-how, and (3) access 
 natural resources nonexistent or too expensive at home.
 LO3. Detail the forces that are driving globalization.
• One major force behind globalization is falling barriers to trade and investment.
• Those helping to reduce such barriers include the World Trade Organization, the 
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and regional trading groups.
• Another force behind globalization is technological innovation. Specific innovations 
include e-mail, videoconferencing, firm intranets and extranets, and advancements in 
transportation technologies such as RFID and GPS.
 LO4. Outline the debate over globalization’s impact on jobs and wages.
• Globalization opponents say it (1) destroys developed-country jobs that are moved 
to developing countries, (2) lowers wages, job security, and employee morale and 
loyalty in developed nations, (3) exploits developing-nation workers in outsourced 
service jobs, and (4) reduces the bargaining power of labor.
• Globalization supporters say it (1) fuels efficiency and greater production that 
raises consumer income, (2) promotes labor market flexibility that quickly 
shifts workers to where they are needed, (3) outsources sorely needed jobs to 
developing nations that elevate living standards, and (4) may actually strengthen 
labor rights.
 LO5. Summarize the debate over income inequality.
• Regarding inequality within nations, evidence suggests that a developing  nation 
can boost incomes for its poorest citizen by integrating itself into the global 
economy.
• In the debate over inequality between nations, studies find that a nation embracing 
world trade and investment can grow faster than rich nations, whereas a sheltered 
economy becomes worse off.
• Regarding global inequality, groups tend to agree that inequality has fallen in recent 
decades although they differ on the extent of the drop.
 LO6. Outline the debate over culture, sovereignty, and the environment.
• Evidence suggests that the cultures of developing nations are thriving in an age 
of globalization and that deeper elements of culture are not easily abandoned, as 
 critics say.
• In terms of national sovereignty, the case can be made that globalization has not 
undermined democracy, but has helped it to spread worldwide and has aided progress 
on many global issues.
• Regarding the environment, it seems globalization has not caused a “race to the 
bottom,” but instead has urged firms to embrace sustainability as a precondition to 
fostering healthy future markets.
 LO7. Describe the global business environment and its main elements.
• The model in Figure 1.3 illustrates that globalization influences every aspect of 
 international business activity.
• The international business environment influences how firms conduct opera-
tions, while globalization further entwines the flows of trade, investment, and  
capital.
• Separate national business environments comprise unique cultural, political, 
 economic, and legal characteristics that define business activity within every 
 nation.
• International business management differs from management of a purely domestic 
firm in nearly all respects.

IO Interactive—Storytelling Goes Global
D 
enmark is a country probably best known for its storytelling 
culture characterized by Hans Christian Andersen and his clas-
sic folk stories. Those fairy tales have for many years delighted 
youngsters from across the globe, seamlessly crossing language 
and cultural barriers. They are an art form that has inspired 
the country’s largest video game developer, IO Interactive. The 
200-strong Copenhagen-based group of programmers, software 
engineers, animators, and mathematicians has created a number 
of critically acclaimed games such as Hitman, Kane & Lynch, and 
Freedom Fighters, whose dark tales appeal to gamers from Boston 
to Beijing.
IO Interactive decided very early on after it was formed in 
1998 that it wanted to target the international market. It did not 
have to look far to realize that the companies at the top of their 
game, so to speak, were the ones whose products held a worldwide 
appeal. Indeed, the perceived wisdom in the highly competitive 
industry is that the only way to survive, and indeed thrive, is to 
go for total globalization. This in itself has appeal to the youth 
market that buys games because young people are proud to be 
using a modern medium for the modern age. They love the fact 
that gaming is capable of hitting all the current buzz words as it 
crosses borders and encourages a rich mix of collaboration and 
user-generated content.
Most game companies have interpreted this as a sign that in 
order to successfully market games worldwide they must limit any 
overtly culturally distinct elements in their titles. Any references to 
local traditions, national literature, and musical identity are inten-
tionally kept to a minimum. This is something IO Interactive very 
much bears in mind when devising its games, but, thanks to its 
rich storytelling roots, the company has been fortunate that it has 
not had to completely turn its back on its traditions. Indeed, the 
company has managed to make great use of its native culture of 
dark humor and fantasy, which perfectly suits the genre of games 
it designs and has significant appeal to young gamers worldwide.
This is not to say that IO Interactive has been able to com-
pletely ignore the sensibilities of the international audience, and 
sometimes the search for global appeal means including cred-
ible material from abroad. Thus, for the release of Kane & Lynch 
2: Dog Days, which featured levels based in China, 23 differ-
ent authentic-sounding Asian songs were written with vocals in 
Mandarin, backed with musicians performing with Chinese instru-
ments including percussion, Shakuhachi, and Pipa. Game review-
ers were bowled over by the international aspect, and one even 
compared the experience to watching a movie by famed Chinese 
film director John Woo.
IO Interactive is helped in its quest for international credibil-
ity by its highly diverse workforce of specialists hailing from 23 
different countries. This is not unusual in this industry. Game de-
velopers are used to relocating and frequently transfer to different 
countries to find the work they want. This inevitably affects both 
the storylines and content of games as the newcomers are not im-
bibed with local traits and have no strong pull to protect national 
identities.
Likewise, IO Interactive frequently dispatches its game develop-
ers to locations around the world to soak up that local culture and 
reflect it more accurately in their games. According to IO Interactive, 
the secret to creating good games is to get all the right ingredients 
together in one big stew and then stir the pot, which for any Hans 
Christian Andersen fan sounds like a very familiar tale indeed.
Thinking Globally
 1-16. Some say globalization is homogenizing the attitudes and 
spending habits of young consumers worldwide. As one 
journalist puts it, it may still be conventional wisdom to 
“think globally and act locally,” but in the youth market, it 
is increasingly a case of “one size fits all.” Do you agree or 
disagree? Why or why not?
 1-17. Some critics say that although video games are designed 
to have a broad appeal, they do reflect a “Westernized” 
version of life. Is there a danger that teens exposed to 
large doses of video games will identify less with the 
cultures of their own societies and that teens in develop-
ing countries will want a Western lifestyle and goods they 
cannot afford?
 1-18. It is now the norm for game developers to relocate to work 
anywhere in the world. Can you think of other social trends 
and technological innovations that have helped companies 
to think more globally?
 1-19. Advances in technology often spur evolution in the enter-
tainment industry. How might new products and services, 
such as the iPhone and YouTube, affect entertainment in 
years to come?

National Business Environments
A Look at This Chapter
This chapter introduces the important 
role of culture in international business. 
We explore the main elements of culture 
and how they affect business policies 
and practices. We learn about different 
frameworks for studying cultures and 
how they apply to international business.
A Look Ahead 
Chapter 3 describes the political 
economy of nations. We will learn how 
different political, economic, and legal 
systems affect the policies and activi-
ties of international companies. We also

A Look Back
Chapter 1 introduced us 
to international business. 
We examined the  impact 
of globalization on 
 markets and production, 
the forces behind global-
ization’s expansion, and 
each main argument in 
the debate over global-
ization. We also profiled 
the kinds of companies 
engaged in international 
business.

 
Chapter 2 • Cross-Cultural Business  69
Hold the Pork, Please!
BONN, Germany—“Kids and grownups love it so, the happy world of Haribo!” So goes 
the phrase that drives sales of Haribo gummi candies worldwide. Germany-based Haribo 
(www.haribo.com) gets its name from 
that of the company’s founder, Hans 
Riegel Bonn. Shown here is Haribo 
CEO Hans Riegel Bonn, Jr. next to a 
life-sized Haribo gummy bear outside 
a Haribo factory in Germany. Hans 
and his brother, Paul, built a global 
brand out of the tiny candy business 
started by their father in 1920.
Haribo candies, with names such as 
Gold Bears and Horror Mix, are avail-
able in 46 shapes including soda bottles 
and glowworms. They are often the first 
export from Germany that children in 
other countries purchase. Haribo sup-
plies 105 countries from its 18 facto-
ries at home and abroad, producing 
over 100 million gummi candies a day. 
But despite its success, Haribo was not 
meeting the needs of a globally dispersed subculture potentially worth $2 billion annually. 
The culprit: the pork-based substance that gives the candy its sticky, rubbery feel makes the 
candy off-limits to Muslims and Jews who adhere to a strict religious diet.
So the company embarked on a four-year mission to create a gummi candy free 
of the pork-based gelatin. “The first time we made it, we got a marmalade you could 
spread on bread,” reported Neville Finlay, the British exporter who ships the new prod-
uct under his own brand. “And at the other extreme was something you could fill a 
swimming pool with and drive a truck across,” he added. Haribo found success eventu-
ally with a bacteria-based compound commonly used in salad dressings and sauces.
Later, a local supplier committed a language blunder—a common occurrence in in-
ternational business. The printing on the first packages of candies destined for Hebrew 
communities was backward—Hebrew is read from right to left, not left to right like 
English. But today production is going smoothly. Haribo even has a Jewish rabbi (for 
kosher candies) or a Muslim cleric (for halal candies) inspect ingredients and oversee 
production to ensure that it adheres to religious customs. As you read this chapter, 
consider all the ways culture affects international business and how companies affect 
cultures around the world.1

part 2 • national Business environments
This chapter is the first of three that describe the links between international business activity 
and a nation’s business environment. We discuss these topics early because they help determine 
how commerce is conducted in a country. Success in international business can often be traced 
directly to a deep understanding of some aspect of a people’s commercial environment. This 
chapter explores the influence of culture on international business activity. Chapter 3 presents 
the role of political economy and ethics and Chapter 4 explores the economic development of 
 nations. Assessment of a nation’s overall business climate is typically the first step in analyzing 
its potential as a host for international commercial activity. This means addressing some impor-
tant questions, such as the following: What language(s) do the people speak? What is the climate 
like? Are the local people open to new ideas and new ways of doing business? Do government 
officials and the people want our business? Is the political situation stable enough so that our 
assets and employees are not placed at unacceptable levels of risk? Answers to these kinds of 
questions—plus statistical data on items such as income level and labor costs—allow companies 
to evaluate the attractiveness of a location as a place for doing business.
We address culture first in our discussion of national business environments because of its 
pivotal role in all international commercial activity. Whether we are discussing an entrepreneur 
running a small import/export business or a huge global firm directly involved in more than 
100 countries, people are at the center of all business activity. When people from around the 
world come together to conduct business, they bring with them different backgrounds, assump-
tions, expectations, and ways of communicating—each of which is a key part of culture.
We begin this chapter by defining culture and understanding the need for cultural knowl-
edge. Next, we learn the importance of values, attitudes, manners, and customs in any given 
culture. We then examine the key components of culture, including social institutions, education, 
religion, and language. We close this chapter with a look at how the richness of culture compli-
cates the global workplace.
What Is Culture?
When traveling in other countries, we often perceive differences in the way people live and 
work. In the United States, dinner is commonly eaten around 6 p.m.; in Spain, it’s not served 
until 8 or 9 p.m. In the United States, most people shop in large supermarkets once or twice a 
week; Italians tend to shop in smaller local grocery stores nearly every day. Essentially, we are 
experiencing differences in culture—the set of values, beliefs, rules, and institutions held by a 
specific group of people. Culture is a highly complex portrait of a people. It includes everything 
from high tea in England to the tropical climate of Barbados, to Mardi Gras in Brazil.
Rightly or wrongly, we tend to invoke the concept of the nation-state when speaking of cul-
ture. In other words, we usually refer to British and Indonesian cultures as if all Britons and all 
Indonesians are culturally identical. We do this because we are conditioned to think in terms of 
national culture. But this is at best a generalization. For example, the British population consists 
of the English as well as the Scottish and Welsh peoples. And people in remote parts of Indonesia 
build homes in treetops even as people in the nation’s developed regions pursue  ambitious economic 
development projects. Let’s take a closer look at the diversity that lies within national cultures.
National Culture
Nation-states support and promote the concept of national culture by building museums and 
monuments to preserve the legacies of important events and people. Nation-states also intervene 
in business to preserve other treasures of national culture. Most nations, for example, regu-
late culturally sensitive sectors of the economy, such as filmmaking and broadcasting. France 
continues to voice fears that its language is being tainted with English and its media with U.S. 
programming. To stem the English invasion, French laws limit the use of English in product 
packaging and storefront signs. At peak listening times, at least 40 percent of all radio station 
programming is reserved for French artists. Similar laws apply to television broadcasting. The 
French government even fined the local branch of a U.S. university for failing to provide a 
French translation on its English-language website.
Cities, too, get involved in enhancing national cultural attractions, often for economic rea-
sons. Lifestyle enhancements to a city can help it attract companies, which benefit by having 
culture
Set of values, beliefs, rules, and 
institutions held by a specific 
group of people.

an easier task retaining top employees. The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain (www.
guggenheim-bilbao.es), designed by Frank Gehry, revived that old Basque industrial city. And 
Hong Kong’s government enhanced its cultural attractions by building a Hong Kong Disney to 
lure businesses that may otherwise locate elsewhere in Asia.
Subcultures
A group of people who share a unique way of life within a larger, dominant culture is called 
a subculture. A subculture can differ from the dominant culture in language, race, lifestyle, 
 values, attitudes, or other characteristics.
Although subcultures exist in all nations, they are often glossed over by our impressions of 
national cultures. For example, the customary portrait of Chinese culture often ignores the fact 
that China’s population includes more than 50 distinct ethnic groups. Decisions regarding prod-
uct design, packaging, and advertising should consider each group’s distinct culture. Marketing 
campaigns also need to recognize that Chinese dialects in the Shanghai and Canton regions dif-
fer from those in the country’s interior; not everyone is fluent in the official Mandarin dialect.
A multitude of subcultures also exists within the United States. Initially, Frito Lay (www.
fritolay.com) had trouble convincing 46 million U.S. Latinos to try its Latin-flavored versions 
of Lay’s and Doritos chips. But then Frito Lay brought four popular brands into the U.S. market 
from its Mexican subsidiary, Sabritas. The gamble paid off. Sales of the Sabritas brand doubled 
to more than $100 million over a two-year period.
Cultural boundaries do not always correspond to political boundaries. In other words, sub-
cultures sometimes exist across national borders. People who live in different nations but who 
share the same subculture can have more in common with one another than with their fellow 
nationals. These subcultures may share purchasing behaviors rooted in lifestyle or values that 
allow them to be marketed to with a single worldwide campaign.
Physical Environment
Land features affect personal communication in a culture. Surface features such as navigable 
rivers and flat plains facilitate travel and contact with others. By contrast, treacherous mountain 
ranges and large bodies of water that are difficult to navigate discourage contact. Mountain 
ranges and the formidable Gobi Desert consume two-thirds of China’s land surface. Groups liv-
ing in the valleys of these mountain ranges hold on to their own ways of life and speak their own 
languages. Although the Mandarin dialect was decreed the national language many years ago, 
the mountains, desert, and vast expanse of China still impair the proliferation of Mandarin.
subculture
A group of people who share a 
unique way of life within a larger, 
dominant culture.
subculture members define 
themselves by their style 
(such as clothing, hair, tattoos) 
and may rebel against mass 
consumerism. london, 
england’s Camden district is 
famous for its historic markets 
and as a gathering place for 
alternative subcultures such 
as goth, punk, and emo. 
Businesses like Youtube and 
Facebook can help subcultures 
to spread quickly worldwide.

The physical environment of a region also affects consumers’ product needs. For example, 
there is little market for Honda scooters (www.honda.com) in most mountainous regions because 
a scooter’s engine is too small to climb the steep grades. Such regions are better markets for the 
company’s more rugged, maneuverable, on-off road motorcycles that have more powerful engines.
Climate affects where people settle and the distribution systems they create. In Australia, 
intensely hot and dry conditions in two large deserts and jungle conditions in the northeast 
pushed settlement to coastal areas. These conditions combined with the higher cost of land 
transport means coastal waters are still used to distribute products between distant cities. 
Climate can also play a role in determining work habits. The heat of the summer sun grows 
intense in the early afternoon hours in the countries of southern Europe, northern Africa, and the 
Middle East. For this reason, people often take afternoon breaks of one or two hours in July and 
August. People use this time to perform errands or to take short naps before returning to work 
until about 7 or 8 p.m. Companies operating in these regions must adapt to this local tradition.
Need for Cultural Knowledge
A visual depiction of culture would resemble an iceberg. Cultural features that we can see are 
a very small portion of all that comprises it. The vast majority of a people’s cultural makeup 
remains hidden from view and below the surface. It takes knowledge, effort, understanding, and 
experience to uncover the essence of a culture and to develop a deep appreciation for it.
AvOidiNg EThNOCENTriCiTy Our thoughts can harbor subconscious, unintentional, and 
inaccurate perceptions of other cultures. Ethnocentricity is the belief that one’s own ethnic 
group or culture is superior to that of others. Ethnocentricity can seriously undermine 
international business projects. It causes people to view other cultures in terms of their own 
and, therefore, disregard the beneficial characteristics of other cultures. Ethnocentricity played 
a role in many stories, some retold in this chapter, of companies that failed when they tried to 
implement a new business practice in a subsidiary abroad. Failure can occur when managers 
ignore a fundamental aspect of the local culture. This can provoke a backlash from the local 
population, its government, or nongovernmental groups. As suppliers and buyers increasingly 
treat the world as a single, interconnected marketplace, managers should eliminate the biases 
inherent in ethnocentric thinking. To read about how companies can foster a nonethnocentric 
perspective, see this chapter’s Culture Matters feature, titled “Creating a Global Mindset.”

ethnocentricity
Belief that one’s own ethnic group 
or culture is superior to that of

cultural literacy
Detailed knowledge about a culture 
that enables a person to work 
happily and effectively within it.
In this era of globalization, companies need employees who func-
tion without the blinders of ethnocentricity. Here are some ways 
managers can develop a global mindset:
• Cultural Adaptability Managers need the ability to alter 
their behavior when working with people from other cultures. 
The first step in doing this is to develop one’s knowledge of 
unfamiliar cultures. The second step is to act on that knowl-
edge to alter behavior to suit cultural expectations. The man-
ager with a global mindset can evaluate others in a culturally 
unbiased way and can motivate and lead multicultural teams.
• Bridging the Gap A large gap can emerge between theory 
and practice when Western management ideas are applied 
in Eastern cultures. Whereas U.S. management principles are 
often accepted at face value in businesses throughout the 
world, U.S. business customs are not. In Asia, for example, 
Western managers might try implementing “collective lead-
ership” practices more in line with Asian management styles.
• Building Global Mentality Companies can apply person-
ality-testing techniques to measure the global aptitude of 
 managers. A global-mindset test evaluates an individual’s 
openness and flexibility, understanding of global principles, 
and strategic implementation abilities. It can also identify 
 areas in which training is needed and generate a list of 
 recommended programs.
• Flexibility Is Key The more behavioral the issues, the greater 
the influence of local cultures. Japanese and Korean manag-
ers are more likely than U.S. managers to wait for directions 
and consult peers on decisions. Western managers posted 
in the Middle East must learn to work within a rigid hierarchy 
in order to be successful. And although showing respect for 
others is universally valued, respect is defined differently from 
country to country.

knowledge about a culture that enables a person to work happily and effectively within it. 
Cultural literacy improves people’s ability to manage employees, market products, and conduct 
negotiations in other countries. Procter & Gamble (www.pg.com) and Apple (www.apple.com) 
may have a competitive advantage because consumers know and respect these highly recognizable 
brand names. Yet, cultural differences often dictate alterations in some aspect of a business in order 
to suit local tastes and preferences. The culturally literate manager who compensates for local 
needs and desires brings the company closer to customers and improves its competitiveness.
Globalization is causing cultures to converge to some extent. The successful TV show 
American Idol, where aspiring singers compete for a chance to become a celebrity, is one 
example of global pop culture. The U.S. show is one of 39 clones around the world based on the 
original British show, Pop Idol. The same company helped develop and market The Apprentice, 
another globally successful TV platform.2
But it is unlikely that the world will homogenize into one global culture in which all people 
share similar lifestyles, values, and attitudes any time soon. It seems that just as often as we 
see signs of an emerging global culture, we discover some new habit that is unique to a single 
culture. This then reminds us of the pivotal roles of history and tradition in defining any culture. 
Though cultural traditions are under continually greater pressure from globalization, their trans-
formation will be gradual rather than abrupt because they are so deeply ingrained in society.
As you read through the concepts and examples in this chapter, try to avoid reacting with 
ethnocentricity while developing your own cultural literacy. Because cultural literacy is central 
to the discussion of many international business topics, you will encounter them throughout this 
book. In the book’s final chapter (Chapter 16), we explore specific types of cultural training that 
companies use to develop their employees’ cultural literacy.

Values and Behavior
So far, our definition of culture is one that most people intuitively understand. We are famil-
iar with the idea that people in different nations behave differently and that every culture has 
 segments of people with distinct values and behaviors. But culture includes what a people 
consider beautiful and tasteful, their underlying beliefs, their traditional habits, and the ways in 
which they relate to one another and their surroundings. Let’s now go beneath the surface of the 
“iceberg” for a fuller understanding of the building blocks of society (see Figure 2.1).

Components of Culture

part 2 • national Business environments
values
Ideas, beliefs, and customs to which people are emotionally attached are called values. Values 
include concepts such as honesty, freedom, and responsibility. Values are important to business 
because they affect a people’s work ethic and desire for material possessions. For example, 
whereas people in Singapore value hard work and material success, people in Greece value 
leisure and a modest lifestyle. The United Kingdom and the United States value individual free-
dom; Japan and South Korea value group consensus.
The influx of values from other cultures can be fiercely resisted. Many Muslims believe 
drugs, alcohol, and certain kinds of music and literature will undermine conservative values. 
This is why the Arab world’s reality TV programs tend to be short-lived. In Bahrain, the local 
version of Big Brother was canceled after people objected to the program’s format, which 
involved young unmarried adults of both sexes living under the same roof. The Lebanon-based 
program Hawa Sawa (On Air Together) was shut down because its “elimidate” format (a young 
man gradually eliminates women to finally select a date) was perceived as too Western. And 
Indonesia’s National Police denied Lady Gaga a permit to perform despite her concert being sold 
out. She is the first foreign artist ever to be denied a permit by authorities there. Conservative 
Muslim groups accused Gaga of “being vulgar, corrupting the morals of the country’s youth, and 
worshiping Satan.”3
Attitudes
Attitudes reflect a people’s underlying values. Attitudes are positive or negative  evaluations, 
feelings, and tendencies that individuals harbor toward objects or concepts. For exam-
ple, a  Westerner would be expressing an attitude if he or she were to say, “I do not like 
the Japanese purification ritual because it involves being naked in a communal bath.” 
The  Westerner quoted here might value modesty and hold conservative beliefs regarding 
exposure of the body.
Similar to values, attitudes are learned from role models, including parents, teachers, and 
religious leaders. Attitudes also differ from one country to another because they are formed 
within a cultural context. But unlike values (which generally concern only important matters), 
people hold attitudes toward both important and unimportant aspects of life. And whereas values 
remain quite rigid over time, attitudes are more flexible.
A “European” attitude has sunk into the psyche of young people across Europe as compa-
nies from different countries merge, industries consolidate, and nations grow closer together in 
the European Union. Many young people in Europe today consider themselves to be “European” 
as much as they identify with their native countries. Still, the underlying values of young 
Europeans tend to remain similar to those of their parents.
Aesthetics
What a culture considers “good taste” in the arts (including music, painting, dance, drama, and 
architecture), the imagery evoked by certain expressions, and the symbolism of certain colors is 
called aesthetics. In other words, it includes the art, images, symbols, colors, and so on that a 
culture values.
Aesthetics are important when a company does business in another culture. The selection 
of appropriate colors for advertising, product packaging, and even work uniforms can improve 
the odds of success. For example, companies take advantage of a positive emotional attachment 
to the color green across the Middle East by incorporating it into a product, its packaging, or 
its promotion. Across much of Asia, on the other hand, green is associated with sickness. In 
Europe, Mexico, and the United States, the color of death and mourning is black; in Japan and 
most of Asia, it’s white.
Music is deeply embedded in culture and, when used correctly, can be a clever and creative 
addition to a promotion; if used incorrectly, it can offend the local population. The architecture 
of buildings and other structures should also be researched to avoid making cultural blunders 
attributable to the symbolism of certain shapes and forms.
The importance of aesthetics is just as great when going international using the Internet. 
Many companies exist that teach corporations how to globalize their Internet presence. These 
companies often provide professional guidance on how to adapt websites to account for cultural 
values
ideas, beliefs, and customs to 
which people are emotionally 
attached.

preferences such as color scheme, imagery, and slogans. The advice of specialist firms can be 
particularly helpful for entrepreneurs and small businesses because they rarely have in-house 
employees well versed in other cultures.
Appropriate Behavior
When doing business in another culture, it is important to understand what is considered 
 appropriate behavior. At a minimum, understanding manners and customs helps managers avoid 
making embarrassing mistakes or offending people. In-depth knowledge, meanwhile, improves 
the ability to negotiate in other cultures, market products effectively, and manage international 
operations. Let’s explore some important differences in manners and customs around the world.
MANNErS Appropriate ways of behaving, speaking, and dressing in a culture are called 
manners. Jack Ma founded Alibaba (www.alibaba.com) as a way for suppliers and buyers 
to increase efficiency by cutting through layers of intermediaries and trading companies. But 
he realized early that his Chinese clients needed training in business etiquette to cross the 
cultural divide and do business with people from Western cultures. So Alibaba offers seminars 
on business manners that instruct clients to spend more time chitchatting with clients and 
conversing more casually.4
Conducting business during meals is common practice in the United States. In Mexico, 
however, it is poor manners to bring up business at mealtime unless the host does so first. 
Business discussions in Mexico typically begin when coffee and brandy arrive. Likewise, toasts 
in the United States tend to be casual and sprinkled with lighthearted humor. In Mexico, where a 
toast should be philosophical and full of passion, a lighthearted toast would be offensive.
CuSTOMS When habits or ways of behaving in specific circumstances are passed down through 
generations, they become customs. Customs differ from manners in that they define appropriate 
habits or behaviors in specific situations. For example, the Japanese tradition of throwing special 
parties for young women and men who turn age 20 is a custom.
Folk and Popular Customs A folk custom is behavior, often dating back several generations, 
that is practiced by a homogeneous group of people. Celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival 
in China and the art of belly dancing in Turkey are both folk customs. A popular custom is 
behavior shared by a heterogeneous group or by several groups. Popular customs can exist in 
just one culture or in two or more cultures at once. Wearing blue jeans and playing golf are 
both popular customs across the globe. Folk customs that spread to other regions develop into 
popular customs. Despite their appeal, popular customs can be seen as a threat by conservative 
or xenophobic members of a culture.
We can also distinguish between folk and popular food. Popular Western-style fast food, for 
instance, is rapidly replacing folk food around the world. Widespread acceptance of “burgers ’n’ 
fries” (born in the United States) and “fish ’n’ chips” (born in Britain) is altering deep-seated 
dietary traditions in many Asian countries, especially among young people. In Japan and South 
Korea today, these popular foods are even becoming a part of home-cooked meals.
gift giving Customs Although giving token gifts to business and government associates 
is customary in many countries, the proper type of gift varies. A knife, for example, should 
not be offered to associates in Russia, France, or Germany, where it signals the severing of a 
relationship. In Japan, gifts must be wrapped in such a delicate way that it is wise to ask someone 
trained in the practice to do the honors. It is also Japanese custom for the giver to protest that the 
gift is small and unworthy of the recipient and for the recipient to not open the gift in front of the 
giver. This tradition does not endorse trivial gifts but is simply a custom.
Cultures differ in their legal and ethical rules against giving or accepting bribes. Large 
gifts to business associates are particularly suspicious. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 
which prohibits companies from giving large gifts to government officials in order to win busi-
ness favors, applies to U.S. firms operating at home and abroad. Yet in many cultures, bribery is 
woven into a social fabric that has worn well for centuries. In some cultures large gifts remain 
an effective way to obtain contracts, enter markets, and secure protection from competitors. See 
the Manager’s Briefcase, titled “A Globetrotter’s Guide to Meetings,” for additional pointers on 
manners and customs when abroad on business.

Social Structure and Education
Social structure embodies a culture’s fundamental organization, including its groups and 
 institutions, its system of social positions and their relationships, and the process by which its 
resources are distributed. Social structure plays a role in many business decisions, including pro-
duction-site selection, advertising methods, and the costs of doing business in a country. Three 
important elements of social structure that differ across cultures are social group associations, 
social status, and social mobility.
Social group Associations
People in all cultures associate themselves with a variety of social groups—collections of two 
or more people who identify and interact with each other. Social groups contribute to each 
 individual’s identity and self-image. Two groups that play especially important roles in affecting 
business activity everywhere are family and gender.*
FAMiLy There are two different types of family groups:
• The nuclear family consists of a person’s immediate relatives, including parents, brothers, 
and sisters. This concept of family prevails in Australia, Canada, the United States, and 
much of Europe.
• The extended family broadens the nuclear family and adds grandparents, aunts and uncles, 
cousins, and relatives through marriage. It is an important social group in much of Asia, the 
Middle East, North Africa, and Latin America.

Large multinationals need top managers who are comfortable liv-
ing, working, and traveling worldwide. Here are a few guidelines 
for a manager to follow when meeting colleagues from other 
cultures:
• Familiarity Avoid the temptation to get too familiar too 
quickly. Use titles such as “doctor” and “mister.” Switch to 
a first-name basis only when invited to do so, and do not 
shorten people’s names from, say, Catherine to Cathy.
• Personal Space Culture dictates what is considered the 
 appropriate distance between two people. In Latin America 
people close the gap significantly and the man-to-man 
 embrace is common in business.
• Religious Values Be cautious so that your manners do not 
offend people. Former Secretary of State Madeline Albright 
acquired the nickname “The Kissing Ambassador” for kissing 
the Israeli and Palestinian leaders of those two religious 
peoples.
• Business Cards In Asia, business cards are considered an 
 extension of the individual. Business cards in Japan are typi-
cally exchanged after a bow, with two hands extended, and 
the wording facing the recipient. Leave the card on the table 
for the entire meeting—don’t quickly stuff it in your wallet or 
toss it into your briefcase.
• Comedy Use humor cautiously because it often does not 
translate well. Avoid jokes that rely on wordplay and puns or 
events in your country, of which local people might have little 
or no knowledge.
• Body Language Do not “spread out” by hanging your arms 
over the backs of chairs, but don’t be too stiff either. Look 
people in the eye lest they deem you untrustworthy, but 
don’t stare too intently in a challenging manner.
Manager’s Briefcase     A Globetrotter’s Guide to Meetings
* We put these two “groups” together for the sake of convenience. Strictly speaking, a gender is not a 
group. Sociologists regard it as a category—people who share some sort of status. A key to group member-
ship is mutual interaction. Individuals in categories know that they are not alone in holding a particular 
status, but the vast majority remain strangers to one another.

 
Chapter 2 • Cross-Cultural Business  77
Extended families can present some interesting situations for businesspeople unfamiliar 
with the concept. In some cultures, owners and managers obtain supplies and materials from 
another company at which someone from the extended family works. Gaining entry into such 
family arrangements can be difficult because quality and price are not sufficient motives to 
ignore family ties.
In extended-family cultures, managers and other employees often try to find jobs for rela-
tives inside their own companies. This practice (called nepotism) can present a challenge to the 
human resource operations of a Western company, which typically must establish explicit poli-
cies on the practice.
gender Gender refers to socially learned habits associated with, and expected of, men or 
women. It includes behaviors and attitudes such as styles of dress and activity preferences. It is 
not the same thing as sex, which refers to the biological fact that a person is either male or female.
Though many countries have made great strides toward gender equality in the workplace, 
others have not. In countries where women are denied equal opportunity in the workplace, 
their unemployment rate can easily be double that for men and their pay half that for men in 
the same occupation. Women’s salaries can be so low and the cost of childcare so high that it 
simply makes more sense for mothers to stay home with their children. Caring for children and 
 performing household duties are also likely considered women’s work in such countries and not 
the responsibility of the entire family.
Social Status
Another important aspect of social structure is the way a culture divides its population according 
to status—that is, according to positions within the structure. Although some cultures have only 
a few categories, others have many. The process of ranking people into social layers or classes is 
called social stratification.
Three factors that normally determine social status are family heritage, income, and occu-
pation. In most industrialized countries royalty, government officials, and top business leaders 
occupy the highest social layer. Scientists, medical doctors, and others with a university  education 
occupy the middle layer. Below are those with vocational training or a secondary-school educa-
tion, who dominate the manual and clerical occupations. Although rankings are fairly stable, they 
can and do change over time. For example, because Confucianism (a major Chinese religion) 
stresses a life of learning, not commerce, Chinese culture frowned on businesspeople for centu-
ries. In modern China, however, people who have obtained wealth and power through business 
are now considered important role models for younger generations.

Social Mobility
Moving to a higher social class is easy in some cultures but difficult or impossible in others. 
Social mobility is the ease with which individuals can move up or down a culture’s “social 
 ladder.” For much of the world’s population today, one of two systems regulates social mobility: 
a caste system or a class system.
CASTE SySTEM A caste system is a system of social stratification in which people are born into 
a social ranking, or caste, with no opportunity for social mobility. India is the classic example 
of a caste culture. Although the Indian constitution officially bans discrimination by caste, its 
influence persists. Little social interaction occurs between castes, and marrying out of one’s caste 
is taboo. Opportunities for work and advancement are defined within the system, and certain 
occupations are reserved for the members of each caste. For example, a member of a lower caste 
cannot supervise someone of a higher caste because personal clashes would be inevitable.

78  
part 2 • national Business environments
The caste system forces Western companies to make some hard ethical decisions when enter-
ing the Indian marketplace. They must decide whether to adapt to local human resource policies in 
India or to import their own from the home country. As globalization penetrates deeper into Indian 
culture, both the nation’s social system and international companies will face many challenges.
CLASS SySTEM A class system is a system of social stratification in which personal ability and 
actions determine social status and mobility. It is the most common form of social stratification 
in the world today. But class systems vary in the amount of mobility they allow. Highly class-
conscious cultures offer less mobility and, not surprisingly, experience greater class conflict. 
Across Western Europe, for example, wealthy families have retained power for generations by 
restricting social mobility. Countries there must sometimes deal with class conflict in the form 
of labor–management disputes that can increase the cost of doing business.
Conversely, lower levels of class-consciousness encourage mobility and lessen conflict. 
A more cooperative atmosphere in the workplace tends to prevail when people feel that a 
higher social standing is within their reach. Most U.S. citizens share the belief that hard work 
can improve their standard of living and social status. People attribute higher status to greater 
income or wealth but often with little regard for family background.
Education
Education is crucial for passing on traditions, customs, and values. Each culture educates 
its young people through schooling, parenting, religious teachings, and group memberships. 
Families and other groups provide informal instruction about customs and how to socialize with 
others. In most cultures, intellectual skills such as reading and mathematics are taught in formal 
educational settings.
Data that a government provides on its people’s education level must be taken with a grain 
of salt. Comparisons from country to country can be difficult because many nations rely on 
literacy tests of their own design. Although some countries administer standardized tests, oth-
ers require only a signature as proof of literacy. Yet searching for untapped markets or new 
factory locations can force managers to rely on such undependable benchmarks. As you can see 
from Table 2.1, some countries have further to go than others to increase national literacy rates. 
Around 800 million adults remain illiterate globally. And although global illiteracy rates are 
higher for women, the gap with men is closing.5

Chapter 2 • Cross-Cultural Business  79
Countries with poorly educated populations attract the lowest-paying manufacturing jobs. 
Nations with excellent programs for basic education tend to attract relatively good-paying indus-
tries. Those that invest in worker training are usually repaid in productivity increases and rising 
incomes. Meanwhile, countries with skilled, highly educated workforces attract all sorts of high-
paying jobs.
Emerging economies in Asia owe much of their rapid economic development to solid 
education systems. They focus on rigorous mathematical training in primary and secondary 
schooling. University education concentrates on the hard sciences and aims to train engineers, 
scientists, and managers.6
ThE “BrAiN drAiN” PhENOMENON The quality of a nation’s education system is related 
to its level of economic development. Brain drain is the departure of highly educated people 
from one profession, geographic region, or nation to another. Over the years, political unrest 
and economic hardship has forced many Indonesians to flee their homeland for other nations, 
particularly Hong Kong, Singapore, and the United States. Most of Indonesia’s brain drain has 
occurred among Western-educated professionals in finance and technology—exactly the people 
needed for economic development.
Many countries in Eastern Europe experienced high levels of brain drain early in their 
transition to market economies. Economists, engineers, scientists, and researchers in all fields 
fled westward to escape poverty. But as these nations continue their long transition from com-
munism, some of them are luring professionals back to their homelands—a process known as 
reverse brain drain.

Religion
Human values often originate from religious beliefs. Different religions take different views of 
work, savings, and material goods. Identifying why they do so may help us understand business 
practices in other cultures. Knowing how religion affects business is especially important in 
countries with religious governments.
Map 2.1 (on pages 80–81) shows where the world’s major religions are practiced. Religion 
is not confined to national political boundaries but can exist in different regions of the world 
simultaneously. It is also common for several or more religions to be practiced within a 
single nation. In the following sections, we explore Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, 
Confucianism, Judaism, and Shinto. We examine their potential effects, both positive and nega-
tive, on international business activity.
Christianity
Christianity was born in Palestine around 2,000 years ago among Jews who believed that God sent 
Jesus of Nazareth to be their savior. Although Christianity boasts more than 300 denominations, 
most Christians belong to the Roman Catholic, Protestant, or Eastern Orthodox churches. With 
2 billion followers, Christianity is the world’s single largest religion. The Roman Catholic faith 
asks its followers to refrain from placing material possessions above God and others. Protestants 
believe that salvation comes from faith in God and that hard work gives glory to God—a tenet 
known widely as the “Protestant work ethic.” Many historians believe this conviction was a main 
factor in the development of capitalism and free enterprise in nineteenth-century Europe.
Christian organizations sometimes get involved in social causes that affect business policy. 
For example, some conservative Christian groups have boycotted the Walt Disney Company

The Catholic Church itself has been involved in some highly publicized controversies. 
Ireland-based Ryanair (www.ryanair.com), Europe’s leading low-fare airline, ruffled the feath-
ers of the Roman Catholic Church with an ad campaign. The ad depicted the pope (the head 
of the Catholic Church) claiming that the fourth secret of Fatima was Ryanair’s low fares. The 
Church sent out a worldwide press release accusing the airline of blaspheming the pope. But 
much to the Church’s dismay, the press release generated an enormous amount of free publicity 
for Ryanair.
Hyundai (www.hyundai.com) offended the Catholic Church when it ran a TV commercial 
during World Cup soccer matches. The spot showed a “church” in Argentina with a stained glass 
window of a soccer ball, a soccer ball topped with a crown of thorns, and parishioners receiving 
slices of pizza instead of communion hosts. The Catholic Church took offense at the images of 
people worshipping soccer and at the mocking of its practice of receiving Holy Communion. 
Hyundai put a stop to the ad two days after it began airing, saying that upon review it found the ad 
to be unintentionally insensitive.7
islam
With 1.3 billion adherents, Islam is the world’s second-largest religion. The prophet 
Muhammad founded Islam around A.D. 600 in Mecca, the holy city of Islam located in Saudi 
Arabia. Islam thrives in north Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, Pakistan, and some 
Southeast Asian nations, including Indonesia. Muslim concentrations are also found in most 
European and U.S. cities. Islam means “submission to Allah,” and Muslim means “one who 
submits to Allah.” Islam revolves around the “five pillars”: (1) reciting the Shahada (profes-
sion of faith), (2) giving to the poor, (3) praying five times daily, (4) fasting during the holy 
month of Ramadan, and (5) making the Hajj (pilgrimage) to the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca 
at least once in a person’s lifetime.
Religion strongly affects the kinds of goods and services acceptable to Muslim consumers. 
Islam, for example, prohibits the consumption of alcohol and pork. Popular alcohol substitutes 
are soft drinks, coffee, and tea. Substitutes for pork include lamb, beef, and poultry (all of which 
must be slaughtered in a prescribed way so as to meet halal requirements). Because hot coffee 
and tea often play ceremonial roles in Muslim nations, the markets for them are quite large. And 
because usury (charging interest for money lent) violates the laws of Islam, credit card compa-
nies collect management fees rather than interest, and each cardholder’s credit line is limited to 
an amount held on deposit.
Nations governed by Islamic law (see Chapter 3) sometimes segregate the sexes at cer-
tain activities and in locations such as schools. In Saudi Arabia, women cannot drive cars on 
public streets. In orthodox Islamic nations, men cannot conduct market research surveys with 
women at their homes unless they are family members. Women visiting Islamic cultures need 
to be especially sensitive to Islamic beliefs and customs. In Iran, for example, the Ministry of 
Islamic Guidance and Culture posts this reminder to visiting female journalists: “The body is 
a tool for the spirit and the spirit is a divine song. The holy tool should not be used for sexual 
intentions.” Although the issue of hejab (Islamic dress) is hotly debated, both Iranian and non-
Iranian women are officially expected to wear body-concealing garments and scarves over 
their hair.
hinduism
Hinduism formed around 4,000 years ago in present-day India, where more than 90 percent of 
Hinduism’s 900 million adherents live. It is also the majority religion of Nepal and a secondary 
religion in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka. Considered by some to be a way of life rather 
than a religion, Hinduism recalls no founder and recognizes no central authority or spiritual 
leader. Integral to the Hindu faith is the caste system described earlier in this chapter.
Hindus believe in reincarnation—the rebirth of the human soul at the time of death. For 
many Hindus the highest goal of life is moksha—escaping from the cycle of reincarnation and 
entering a state of eternal happiness called nirvana. Hindus tend to disdain materialism. Strict 
Hindus do not eat or willfully harm any living creature because it may be a reincarnated human 
soul. Because Hindus consider cows to be sacred animals, they do not eat beef. Yet, consuming 
cow’s milk is considered a means of religious purification. Firms such as McDonald’s (www.
mcdonalds.com) must work closely with government and religious officials in India in order 

 
Chapter 2 • Cross-Cultural Business  83
to respect Hindu beliefs. In many regions, McDonald’s has removed all beef products from 
its menu and prepares vegetable and fish products in separate kitchen areas. And for those 
Indians who do eat red meat (but not cows because of their sacred status), the company sells the 
Maharaja Mac, made of lamb, in place of the Big Mac.
In India, there have been attacks on Western consumer-goods companies in the name 
of preserving Indian culture and Hindu beliefs. Some companies such as Pepsi-Cola (www.
pepsi.com) have been vandalized, and local officials even shut down a KFC restaurant (www.
kfc.com) for a time. Although it currently operates in India, Coca-Cola (www.cocacola.com) 
once left the market completely rather than succumb to demands that it reveal its secret for-
mula to authorities. India’s investment environment has improved greatly in recent years. Yet 
labor–management relations sometimes deteriorate to such a degree that strikes cut deeply into 
productivity.
Buddhism
Buddhism was founded about 2,600 years ago in India by a Hindu prince named Siddhartha 
Gautama, who later became the Buddha. Today, Buddhism has around 380 million follow-
ers, mostly in China, Tibet, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand, and there are pockets of 
Buddhists in Europe and the Americas. Although founded in India, Buddhism has relatively 
few adherents there. Unlike Hinduism, Buddhism rejects the caste system of Indian society. 
But like Hinduism, Buddhism promotes a life centered on spiritual rather than worldly matters. 
Buddhism also teaches that seeking pleasure for the human senses causes suffering. In a formal 
ceremony, Buddhists take refuge in the “three jewels”: the Buddha, the dharma (his teachings), 
and the sangha (community of enlightened beings). They seek nirvana (escape from reincar-
nation) through charity, modesty, compassion for others, restraint from violence, and general 
self-control.
Although monks at many temples are devoted to lives of solitary meditation and disci-
pline, many other Buddhist priests are dedicated to lessening the burden of human suffering. 
They finance schools and hospitals across Asia and are active in worldwide peace movements. 
In Tibet, most people still acknowledge the exiled Dalai Lama as the spiritual and political head 
of the Buddhist culture. In the United States, a coalition of religious groups and human rights 
advocates continue to press the U.S. Congress to apply economic sanctions against countries 
that are seen as practicing religious persecution.
Buddhism instructs its 
followers to live a simple life 
void of materialistic ambitions. 
But as globalization pries open 
asia’s markets, the products 
of Western multinational 
corporations are streaming in. 
here, young Buddhist monks 
in Burma gather around a

asian cultures can modernize 
while retaining their traditional 
values and beliefs?

Confucianism
An exiled politician and philosopher named Kung-fu-dz (pronounced “Confucius” in 
English) began teaching his ideas in China nearly 2,500 years ago. Today, China is home to 
most of Confucianism’s 225 million followers. Confucian thought is also ingrained in the 
cultures of Japan, South Korea, and nations with large numbers of ethnic Chinese, such as 
Singapore.
South Korean business practice reflects Confucian thought in its rigid organizational struc-
ture and unswerving reverence for authority. Korean employees do not question strict chains of 
command. Yet, efforts to apply Korean-style management in overseas subsidiaries have caused 
some high-profile disputes with U.S. executives and confrontations with factory workers in 
Vietnam.
Some observers contend that the Confucian work ethic and a commitment to educa-
tion helped spur East Asia’s phenomenal economic growth. But others respond that the link 
between culture and economic growth is weak. They argue that economic, historical, and inter-
national factors are at least as important as culture. They say that Chinese leaders distrusted 
Confucianism for centuries because they believed that it stunted economic growth. Likewise, 
many Chinese despised merchants and traders because their main objective (earning money) 
violated Confucian beliefs. As a result, many Chinese businesspeople moved to Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, where they launched successful businesses. Today, overseas 
Chinese people in these countries (and Taiwan) are helping finance China’s rapid economic 
growth.
Judaism
More than 3,000 years old, Judaism was the first religion to preach belief in a single God. 
Nowadays, Judaism has roughly 18 million followers worldwide. In Israel, Orthodox (“fully 
observant”) Jews make up 12 percent of the population and constitute an increasingly important 
economic segment. In Jerusalem, there is even a modeling agency that specializes in casting 
Orthodox Jews in ads aimed both inside and outside the Orthodox community. Models include 
scholars and one rabbi. In keeping with Orthodox principles, women model only modest cloth-
ing and never appear in ads alongside men.
Employers and human resource managers must be aware of important days in the Jewish 
faith. Because the Sabbath lasts from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday, work sched-
ules might need adjustment. Devout Jews want to be home before sundown on Fridays. On the 
Sabbath itself, they do not work, travel, or carry money. Several other important observances 
are Rosh Ha-Shanah (the two-day Jewish New Year, in September or October), Yom Kippur 
(the Day of Atonement, 10 days after New Year), Passover (which celebrates the Exodus from 
Egypt, in March or April each year), and Hanukkah (which celebrates an ancient victory over the 
Syrians, usually in December).
Marketers must take into account foods that are banned among strict Jews. Pork and shell-
fish (such as lobster and crab) are prohibited. Meat is stored and served separately from milk. 
Other meats must be slaughtered according to a practice called shehitah. Meals prepared accord-
ing to Jewish dietary traditions are called kosher. Most airlines offer kosher meals for Jewish 
passengers on their flights.
Shinto
Shinto (meaning “way of the gods”) arose as the native religion of the Japanese. But today, 
Shinto can claim only about 4 million strict adherents in Japan. Because modern Shinto preaches 
patriotism, it is sometimes said that Japan’s real religion is nationalism. Shinto teaches sincere 
and ethical behavior, loyalty and respect toward others, and enjoyment of life.
Shinto beliefs are reflected in the workplace through the traditional practice of life-
time employment (although this is waning today) and through the traditional trust extended 
between firms and customers. Japanese competitiveness in world markets has benefited 
from  loyal workforces, low employee turnover, and good labor–management cooperation. 
The phenomenal success of many Japanese companies in recent decades gave rise to the 
concept of a Shinto work ethic, certain aspects of which have been emulated by Western 
managers.

Personal Communication
People in every culture have a communication system to convey thoughts, feelings, knowl-
edge, and information through speech, writing, and actions. Understanding a culture’s spoken 
language gives us great insight into why people think and act the way they do. Understanding 
a culture’s body language helps us avoid sending unintended or embarrassing messages. Let’s 
examine each of these forms of communication more closely.
Spoken and Written Language
Spoken and written language is the most obvious difference we notice when traveling in another 
country. We overhear and engage in a number of conversations and read many signs and docu-
ments to find our way. Knowledge of a people’s language is the key to deeply understanding a 
culture.
Linguistically different segments of a population are often culturally, socially, and politi-
cally distinct. Malaysia’s population is composed of Malay (60 percent), Chinese (30 percent), 
and Indian (10 percent) peoples. Although Malay is the official national language, each ethnic 
group speaks its own language and continues its traditions. The United Kingdom includes 
England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. The native languages of Ireland and Scotland 
are dialects of Gaelic, and the speaking of Welsh in Wales predates the use of English in Britain. 
After decades of decline, Gaelic and Welsh are staging comebacks on radio and television and in 
school curricula.
The global reach of media today and increased travel for tourism and business mean that 
some cultures face the possibility of losing their native languages. Read the Global Sustainability 
feature, titled “Speaking in Fewer Tongues,” to see how a lack of social sustainability can endan-
ger languages around the world.
communication
System of conveying thoughts,

• The Consequences The loss of a language can diminish 
the richness of a people’s cultural, spiritual, and intellectual 
life. What is lost includes prayers, myths, humor, poetry, 
ceremonies, conversational styles, and terms for emotions, 
behaviors, and habits. When a language dies, all these must 
be expressed in a new language with different words, sounds, 
and grammar.
• What Can Be Done? Linguists are concerned that such 
a valuable part of human culture could vanish. So, they 
are busily creating videotapes, audiotapes, and written 
records of endangered tongues before they disappear. 
Communities are also taking action. In New Zealand, Maori 
communities set up nursery schools called kohanga reo, or 
“language nests,” that are staffed by elders and conducted 
entirely in Maori.

One day this year, somewhere in the world, an old man or woman 
will die and with them will go their language. Dozens of languages 
have just one native speaker still living. Here are the facts, the con-
sequences, and what can be done.
• Some Are Losing Of the world’s roughly 6,000 languages, 
about 90 percent have fewer than 100,000 speakers. By the 
end of this century, more than half of the world’s languages may 
be lost; perhaps fewer than 1,000 will survive. One  endangered 
language is Aramaic, a 2,500-year-old Semitic  language that 
was once the major language in the Middle East.
• Some Are Gaining Even as minority languages die out, 
three languages continue to grow in popularity: Mandarin, 
Spanish, and English. English has emerged as the univer-
sal language of business, higher education, diplomacy, 
science, popular music, entertainment, and international 
travel. More than 70 nations give special status to English, 
and roughly one-quarter of the world’s population is fluent 
or competent in it.

iMPLiCATiONS FOr MANAgErS The importance of understanding local languages is becoming 
increasingly apparent on the Internet. Roughly two-thirds of all web pages are in English, but 
around three-fourths of all Internet users are nonnative English speakers. Software-solutions 
providers are assisting companies from English-speaking countries in adapting their websites 
for global e-business. Web surfers from cultures across the globe bring their own specific tastes, 
preferences, and buying habits online with them. The company that can provide its customer in 
Mexico City, Paris, or Tokyo with a quality buying experience in his or her native language will 
have an edge on the competition.
Language proficiency is crucial in production facilities where nonnative managers 
are supervising local employees. One U.S. manager in Mexico was confused when his 
 seemingly relaxed and untroubled workers went on strike. The problem lay in different 
 cultural perspectives. Mexican workers generally do not take the initiative in problem 
 solving and workplace complaints. Workers concluded that the plant manager knew, but 
did not care, about their concerns because he did not question employees about working 
conditions.
American-born Thomas Kwan, who works for a health products company in Shanghai, 
China, says similar scenarios occur there. “Whereas Americans are encouraged to challenge 
their boss to explain things, I have to ask Chinese staff what they think and encourage them 
to speak up. A lot of [expatriate] managers fail in China because they don’t understand that 
Chinese don’t tell you what they think,” he says.8
Marketers prize insights into the interests, values, attitudes, and habits of teenagers. Habbo 
(www.habbo.com), the world’s largest virtual hangout for teens, surveyed more than 50,000 
teenagers in 31 countries to learn how they communicate with each other. The study found 
that, although 72 percent of teens have active e-mail accounts, 76 percent communicate with 
friends primarily through instant messaging. Teens reserve e-mail for nonpersonal needs such 
as school, work, and correspondence with family members. And, of course, teens keep in touch 
on Facebook (www.facebook.com). Knowledge of these habits help marketers to better target 
promotions.9
LANguAgE BLuNdErS Advertising slogans and company documents must be translated 
carefully so that messages are received precisely as intended. If they are not carefully 
translated, a company can make a language blunder in its international business dealings. 
In Sweden, Kellogg (www.kellogg.com) had to rename its Bran Buds cereal because the 
Swedish translation came out roughly as “burned farmer.” And then there’s the entrepreneur 
in Miami who tried to make the most of a visit to the United States by the Pope of 
the Roman  Catholic Church. He quickly began printing T-Shirts for Spanish-speaking 
Catholics that should have read, “I saw the Pope (el Papa).” But a gender error on the noun 
resulted in T-Shirts proclaiming, “I saw the Potato (la Papa)”!10 Other translation blunders 
include:
• An English-language sign in a Moscow hotel read, “You are welcome to visit the 
 cemetery where famous Russian composers, artists, and writers are buried daily except 
Thursday.”
• A sign for English-speaking guests in a Tokyo hotel read, “You are respectfully requested 
to take advantage of the chambermaids.”
• An airline ticket office in Copenhagen read in English, “We take your bags and send them 
in all directions.”
• A Japanese knife manufacturer labeled its exports to the United States with “Caution: 
Blade extremely sharp! Keep out of children.”
• Braniff Airlines’ English-language slogan “Fly in Leather” was translated into “Fly Naked” 
in Spanish.
Such blunders are not the exclusive domain of humans. The use of machine translation—
computer software used to translate one language into another—is booming along with the 
explosion in the number of nonnative English speakers using the Internet. One search engine 

 
Chapter 2 • Cross-Cultural Business  87
allows its users to search the Internet in English and Asian languages, translate web pages, 
and compose an e-mail in one language and send it in another. The computers attempted a 
translation of the following: “The Chinese Communist Party is debating whether to drop its 
ban on private-enterprise owners being allowed to join the party.” And it came up with this in 
Chinese: “The Chinese Communist Party is debating whether to deny its ban in join the Party 
is allowed soldier enterprise owners on.” Various other machine translators turned the French 
version of “I don’t care” (“Je m’en fou”) into “I myself in crazy,” “I of insane,” and “Me me 
in madman.”
LiNguA FrANCA A lingua franca is a third or “link” language understood by two parties who 
speak different native languages. The original lingua franca arose to support ancient trading 
activities and contained a mixture of Italian and French, along with Arabic, Greek, and Turkish. 
Although only five percent of the world’s population speaks English as a first language, it is 
the most common lingua franca used in international business, followed closely by French and 
Spanish.
The Cantonese dialect of Chinese spoken in Hong Kong and the Mandarin dialect spoken 
in Taiwan and on the Chinese mainland are so different that a lingua franca is often preferred. 
And, although India’s official language is Hindi, its lingua franca among the multitude of 
dialects is English because it was once a British colony. Yet many young people speak what is 
referred to as “Hinglish”—a combination of Hindi, Tamil, and English words mixed within a 
single sentence.
Multinational corporations also sometimes choose a lingua franca for official internal com-
munications because they operate in many nations, each with its own language. Companies that 
use English for internal correspondence include Philips (www.philips.com; a Dutch electronics 
firm), Asea Brown Boveri (www.abb.com; a Swiss industrial giant), and Alcatel-Lucent (www.
alcatel-lucent.com; a French telecommunications firm). Japan’s number-one Internet shopping 
site, Rakuten (www.rakuten.co.jp), officially adopted English because of its pervasiveness on 
the Internet. All executive meetings are held in English, and all internal documents will eventu-
ally be written in English.11
Body Language
Body language communicates through unspoken cues, including hand gestures, facial 
 expressions, physical greetings, eye contact, and the manipulation of personal space. Similar 
to spoken language, body language communicates both information and feelings and differs 
greatly from one culture to another. Italians, French, Arabs, and Venezuelans, for example, 
tend to animate conversations with lively hand gestures and other body motions. Japanese 
and Koreans, although more reserved, can communicate just as much information through 
their own body languages; a look of the eye can carry as much or more meaning as two flail-
ing arms.
Most body language is subtle and takes time to recognize and interpret. For example, 
navigating the all-important handshake in international business can be tricky. In the United 
States, a firm grip and several pumps of the arm is usually the standard. But in the Middle 
East and Latin America, a softer clasp of the hand with little or no arm pump is the cus-
tom. And in some countries, such as Japan, people do not shake hands at all but bow to 
one another. Bows of respect carry different meanings, usually depending on the recipient. 
Associates of equal standing bow about 15 degrees toward one another. But proper respect 
for an elder requires a bow of about 30 degrees. Bows of remorse or apology should be about 
45 degrees.
Proximity is an extremely important element of body language to consider when meet-
ing someone from another culture. If you stand or sit too close to your counterpart (from their 
perspective), you may invade their personal space and appear aggressive. If you remain too far 
away, you risk appearing untrustworthy. For North Americans, a distance of about 19 inches is 
about right between two speakers. For Western Europeans, 14 to 16 inches seems appropriate, 
but someone from the United Kingdom might prefer about 24 inches. Koreans and Chinese are

likely to be comfortable about 36 inches apart; people from the Middle East will close the dis-
tance to about 8 to 12 inches.
Physical gestures often cause the most misunderstanding between people of different 
 cultures because they can convey very different meanings. For example, the thumbs-up sign is 
vulgar in Italy and Greece but means “all right” or even “great” in the United States.

Culture in the Global Workplace
So far in this chapter, we learned about the key components of culture and read examples from 
around the world of how each one influences international business. Let’s now take a closer 
look at how specific aspects of a people’s beliefs and behaviors affect activities in the global 
workplace.
Perception of Time
People in many Latin American and Mediterranean cultures are casual about their use of time. 
They maintain flexible schedules and would rather enjoy their time than sacrifice it to unbend-
ing efficiency. Businesspeople, for example, may arrive after the scheduled meeting time and 
prefer to build personal trust before discussing business. Not surprisingly, it usually takes 
longer to conduct business in these parts of the world than in the United States or northern 
Europe.
By contrast, people in Japan and the United States typically arrive promptly for meetings, 
keep tight schedules, and work long hours. The emphasis on using time efficiently reflects the 
underlying value of hard work in both these countries. Yet, people in Japan and the United 
States sometimes differ in how they use their time at work. For example, U.S. employees 
strive toward workplace efficiency and may leave work early if the day’s tasks are done, 
reflecting the value placed on producing individual results. But in Japan, although efficiency 
is prized, it is equally important to look busy in the eyes of others even when business is slow. 
A Japanese employee would not leave work early even if he or she finished the day’s task 
ahead of schedule. Japanese workers want to demonstrate their dedication to superiors and 
coworkers—an attitude grounded in values such as the concern for group cohesion, loyalty, 
and harmony.
view of Work
Some cultures display a strong work ethic; others stress a more balanced pace in juggling work 
and leisure. People in southern France like to say they work to live, whereas people in the United 
States live to work. The French say work is a means to an end for them, whereas work is an

end in itself in the United States. Not surprisingly, the lifestyle in southern France is slower-
paced. People tend to concentrate on earning enough money to enjoy a relaxed, quality lifestyle. 
Businesses practically close down during August, when many workers take month-long paid 
holidays, often outside the country.
In European countries, start-ups are considered quite risky, and capital for entrepreneurial 
ventures can be scarce. Moreover, if an entrepreneur’s venture goes bust, he or she can find it 
very hard to obtain financing for future projects because of the stigma of failure. This remains 
true despite some progress recently. Yet, in the United States a prior bankruptcy is sometimes 
considered a valuable learning experience (assuming lessons were learned) when referenced 
in a business plan. As long as U.S. bankers or venture capitalists see promising business plans, 
they are generally willing to loan money. Today, many European nations are trying to encourage 
entrepreneurial activity.
Material Culture
All the technology used in a culture to manufacture goods and provide services is called its 
material culture. Material culture is often used to measure the technological advancement of a 
nation’s markets or industries. Generally, a firm enters a new market only if demand for its prod-
ucts has developed or the infrastructure is capable of supporting production operations. Some 
nations lack the most basic elements of a modern society’s material culture. Yet, technology is 
helping countries at the bottom of the global economic pyramid break down barriers that keep 
their people mired in poverty.
Material culture often displays uneven development across a nation’s geography, markets, 
and industries. For example, Shanghai has long played an important role in China’s inter-
national trade because of its strategic location and its superb harbor on the East China Sea. 
Although it is home to only one percent of the total population, Shanghai accounts for about 
five percent of China’s total output—including about 12 percent of both its industrial produc-
tion and its financial-services output. Likewise, Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, houses 
only 10 percent of the nation’s population but accounts for about 40 percent of its economic 
output. Meanwhile, the northern parts of the country remain rural, consisting mostly of farms, 
forests, and mountains.

Cultural Change
A cultural trait is anything that represents a culture’s way of life, including gestures, material 
objects, traditions, and concepts. Such traits include bowing to show respect in Japan (gesture), a 
Buddhist temple in Thailand (material object), celebrating the Day of the Dead in Mexico (tradi-
tion), and practicing democracy in the United States (concept).
The process whereby cultural traits spread from one culture to another is called cultural 
diffusion. As new traits are accepted and absorbed into a culture, cultural change occurs 
 naturally and, as a rule, gradually. Globalization and technological advances are increasing the 
pace of both cultural diffusion and cultural change. The global spread of media today along 
with the expanding reach of the Internet and services like YouTube and Facebook play a role 
in  cultural diffusion. These forces expose (sometimes isolated) people to the traits and ideas of 
other cultures.
WhEN COMPANiES ChANgE CuLTurES International companies are often agents of 
cultural change. As trade and investment barriers fall, for example, U.S. consumer-goods and 
entertainment companies are moving into untapped markets. Critics sometimes charge that, in 
exporting the products of such firms, the United States is practicing cultural imperialism—
the replacement of one culture’s traditions, folk heroes, and artifacts with substitutes from 
another.
Fears of cultural imperialism still drive some French to oppose the products of the Walt 
Disney Company (www.disney.com) and its Disneyland Paris theme park. They fear “Mickey 
and Friends” could replace traditional characters rooted in French culture. McDonald’s (www.
mcdonalds.com) is also sometimes charged with cultural imperialism. It is reported that the 
average Japanese child thinks McDonald’s was invented in Japan and exported to the United 
States. Chinese children consider “Uncle” McDonald to be “funny, gentle, kind, and under-
standing.” Meanwhile, politicians in Russia decry the “Snickerization” of their culture—a 
snide term that refers to the popularity of the Snickers candy bar made by Mars Incorporated 
(www.mars.com). And when the Miss World Pageant was held in India, conservative groups 
criticized Western corporate sponsors for spreading the message of consumerism and portray-
ing women as sex objects.
Sensitivity to the cultures in which they operate can help companies avoid charges of cul-
tural imperialism. Firms must focus not only on meeting people’s product needs but also on how 
their activities and products affect people’s traditional ways and habits. Rather than view their 
influence on culture as the inevitable consequence of doing business, companies can take several 
steps to soften those effects. For example, policies and practices that are at odds with deeply held 
beliefs can be introduced gradually. Managers could also seek the advice of highly respected 
local individuals such as elders, who fulfill key societal roles in many developing countries. And 
businesses should always make clear to local workers the benefits of any proposed changes that 
are closely linked to cultural traits.
An area in which U.S. companies may be changing the workplace in other cultures is how 
workers are treated. As U.S. companies outsource jobs to other nations, they are being held 
accountable for how these subcontractors treat their employees. In the process, U.S. companies 
export the values of the U.S. workplace.
WhEN CuLTurES ChANgE COMPANiES Culture often forces companies to adjust business 
policies and practices. Managers from the United States, for example, often encounter cultural 
differences that force changes in how they motivate employees in other countries. Managers 
sometimes use situational management—a system in which a supervisor walks an employee 
through every step of an assignment or task and monitors the results at each stage. This 
technique helps employees fully understand the scope of their jobs and clarifies the boundaries 
of their responsibilities.
Cultural differences can force other changes to suit local culture. In Vietnam, individual 
criticism should be delivered privately to save employees from “losing face” among cowork-
ers. Individual praise for good performance can be delivered either in private or in public, if

done carefully. The Vietnamese place great value on group harmony, so an individual can be 
embarrassed if singled out publicly as being superior to the rest of the work unit. And Vietnam’s 
traditional, agriculture-based economy means that people’s concept of time revolves around the 
seasons. The local “timepiece” is the monsoon, not the clock. Western managers need to take a 
patient, long-term view of business activity there.
Studying Culture in The Workplace
When discussing culture’s role in the global workplace, we need to discuss two frameworks 
 developed to differentiate between cultures. These frameworks examine characteristics such 
as values, attitudes, social structures, and so on. Let’s now take a detailed look at each of 
these tools.
KLuCKhOhN-STrOdTBECK FrAMEWOrK Two researchers by the names of Kluckhohn 
and Strodtbeck compared cultures and believed they differ along six dimensions. The 
Kluckhohn-Strodtbeck framework studies a given culture by asking each of the following 
questions:12
• Do people believe that their environment controls them, that they control the environment, 
or that they are part of nature?
• Do people focus on past events, on the present, or on the future implications of their 
actions?
• Are people easily controlled and not to be trusted, or can they be trusted to act freely and 
responsibly?
• Do people desire accomplishments in life, carefree lives, or spiritual and contemplative 
lives?
• Do people believe that individuals or groups are responsible for each person’s welfare?
• Do people prefer to conduct most activities in private or in public?

Case: Japanese Culture By providing answers to each of these six questions, we can apply the 
Kluckhohn–Strodtbeck framework to Japanese culture:
 1. Japanese believe in a delicate balance between people and environment that must be 
maintained. Suppose an undetected flaw in a company’s product harms customers using it. 
In many countries, a high-stakes class-action lawsuit would be filed against the manufac-
turer on behalf of the victims’ families. This scenario rarely plays out in Japan. Japanese 
culture does not feel that individuals can possibly control every situation but that accidents 
happen. Japanese victims would receive heartfelt apologies, a promise it won’t happen 
again, and a relatively small damage award.
 2. Japanese culture emphasizes the future. Because Japanese culture emphasizes strong 
ties between people and groups, including companies, forming long-term relationships 
with people is essential when doing business there. Throughout the business relationship, 
Japanese companies remain in close, continuous contact with buyers to ensure that their 
needs are being met. This relationship also forms the basis of a communication channel by 
which suppliers learn about the types of products and services buyers would like to see in 
the future.
 3. Japanese culture treats people as quite trustworthy. Business dealings among Japanese 
companies are based heavily on trust. After an agreement to conduct business is entered 
into, it is difficult to break unless there are extreme, uncontrollable factors at work. This 
is due to the fear of “losing face” if one cannot keep a business commitment. In addition 
to business applications, society at large reflects the Japanese concern for trustworthi-
ness. Crime rates are quite low, and the streets of Japan’s largest cities are very safe to 
walk at night.
 4. Japanese are accomplishment-oriented—not necessarily for themselves, but for their 
employers and work units. Japanese children learn the importance of groups early by 
 contributing to the upkeep of their schools. They share duties such as mopping floors, 
washing windows, cleaning chalkboards, and arranging desks and chairs. They carry such 
habits learned in school into the adult workplace, where management and labor tend to 
work together toward company goals. Japanese managers make decisions only after con-
sidering input from subordinates. Also, materials buyers, engineers, designers, factory 
floor supervisors, and marketers cooperate closely throughout each stage of a product’s 
development.
 5. Japanese culture emphasizes individual responsibility to the group and group respon-
sibility to the individual. This trait has long been a hallmark of Japanese corporations. 
Traditionally, subordinates promise hard work and loyalty, and top managers provide job 
security. But to remain competitive internationally, Japanese companies have eliminated 
jobs and moved production to low-wage nations like China and Vietnam. As the tradition 
of job security falls by the wayside, more Japanese workers now consider working for 
non-Japanese companies, whereas others find work as temporary employees. Although this 
trait of loyalty is diminishing somewhat in business, it remains a very prominent feature in 
other aspects of Japanese society, especially family.
 6. The culture of Japan tends to be public. You will often find top Japanese managers  located 
in the center of a large, open-space office surrounded by the desks of many employees. 
In comparison, Western executives are often secluded in walled offices located on the 
 perimeter of workspaces. This characteristic reaches deep into Japanese society—consider, 
for example, Japan’s tradition of bathing in public bathhouses.
hOFSTEdE FrAMEWOrK Psychologist and researcher, Geert Hofstede, created another 
way  to differentiate cultures.13 He initially developed the Hofstede framework from 
a study  of more than 110,000 people working in IBM subsidiaries (www.ibm.com) in 
40 countries. Later research expanded the framework so that it now contains a total of six 
dimensions:14
 1. Individualism versus collectivism. This dimension identifies the extent to which a 
 culture emphasizes the individual versus the group. Individualist cultures (those scoring

differences along five dimensions, 
such as individualism versus 
collectivism and equality versus 
inequality.

 
Chapter 2 • Cross-Cultural Business  93
high on this dimension) value hard work and promote entrepreneurial risk taking, thereby 
fostering invention and innovation. Although people are given freedom to focus on per-
sonal goals, they are held responsible for their actions. That is why responsibility for 
poor business decisions is placed squarely on the shoulders of the individual in charge. 
At the same time, higher individualism may be responsible for higher rates of employee 
turnover. You can see how a sample of nations scored on this and the remaining Hofstede 
dimensions in Table 2.2.
People in collectivist cultures (those scoring low on this dimension) feel a strong 
association to groups, including family and work units. The goal of maintaining 
group harmony is probably most evident in the family structure. People in collectivist 
cultures tend to work toward collective rather than personal goals and are responsible 
to the group for their  actions. In turn, the group shares responsibility for the well-
being of each of its members. Thus, in collectivist cultures, success or failure tends to 
be shared among the work unit, rather than any particular individual receiving all the 
praise or blame. All social, political, economic, and legal institutions reflect the group’s 
critical role.
 2. Power distance. This dimension conveys the degree to which a culture accepts social 
inequality among its people. A culture with large power distance tends to be characterized 
by much inequality between superiors and subordinates. Organizations tend also to be 
more hierarchical, with power deriving from prestige, force, and inheritance. This is why 
executives and upper management in cultures with large power distance often enjoy special 
recognition and privileges. On the other hand, cultures with small power distance dis-
play a greater degree of equality, with prestige and rewards more equally shared between

 superiors and subordinates. Power in these cultures (relative to cultures with large power 
distance) is seen to derive more from hard work and entrepreneurial drive and is therefore 
often considered more legitimate.
 3. Uncertainty avoidance. This dimension identifies the extent to which a culture avoids 
uncertainty and ambiguity. A culture with large uncertainty avoidance values security and 
places its faith in strong systems of rules and procedures in society. Not surprisingly, per-
haps, cultures with large uncertainty avoidance normally have lower employee turnover, 
more formal rules for regulating employee behavior, and more difficulty implementing 
change. Cultures scoring low on uncertainty avoidance tend to be more open to change and 
new ideas. This helps explain why individuals in this type of culture tend to be entrepre-
neurial and organizations tend to welcome the best business practices from other cultures. 
Because people tend to be less fearful of change, however, these cultures can also suffer 
from higher levels of employee turnover.
 4. Masculinity versus femininity. This dimension captures the extent to which a culture 
emphasizes masculinity versus femininity. According to Hofstede, cultures scoring high 
on masculinity tend to be characterized more by personal assertiveness and the accumu-
lation of wealth, typically translating into an entrepreneurial drive. Cultures scoring low 
on this dimension (greater tendency toward femininity) generally have more relaxed 
lifestyles, wherein people are more concerned about caring for others as opposed to 
 material gain.
 5. Long-term orientation. This dimension indicates a society’s perception of time and its 
attitudes about overcoming obstacles with time, if not with will and strength. It attempts 
to capture the differences between Eastern and Western cultures. A high-scoring culture 
(strong long-term orientation) values respect for tradition, thrift, perseverance, and a sense 
of personal shame. These cultures tend to have a strong work ethic because people expect 
long-term rewards from today’s hard work. A low-scoring culture is characterized by indi-
vidual stability and reputation, fulfillment of social obligations, and reciprocation of greet-
ings and gifts. These cultures can change more rapidly because tradition and commitment 
are not insurmountable impediments to change.
 6. Indulgence versus restraint. This dimension captures the extent to which a society 
 allows free expression. An indulgent society (one scoring high on this dimension) allows 
people to rather freely satisfy human needs related to enjoying life and having fun. By 
contrast, a restrained society uses varying degrees of social norms to suppress the free 
satisfaction of such needs. Indulgent societies tend to value individual happiness, leisure, 
freedom, and personal control. Restrained societies are less concerned with each of these 
and tend to believe that certain aspects of life are predestined. Employees in an indulgent 
society may be more forthcoming with frank opinions and more likely to quit an unsat-
isfying job. And whereas service workers in indulgent societies are expected to offer 
customers a genuine smile and friendly demeanor, such overt expressions could appear 
artificial in a restrained society.15

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Explain culture and the need for cultural knowledge.
• Culture is the set of values, beliefs, rules, and institutions held by a specific group 
of people. Work habits and product preferences can be influenced by the physical 
environment.
• We tend to equate a nation-state and its people with a single culture. But most 
 nations are home to numerous subcultures—groups of people who share a unique 
way of life within a larger, dominant culture.
• Managers try to avoid ethnocentricity (the tendency to view one’s own culture as 
superior to others) and to develop cultural literacy (detailed knowledge necessary to 
function effectively in another culture).
A
s globalization continues to draw companies into the 
 international arena, understanding local culture can give 
a company an advantage over rivals. By avoiding ethnocentric 
thinking, managers can avoid mistakenly disregarding the ben-
eficial aspects of other cultures. By contrast, culturally literate 
managers who  understand local needs and desires bring their 
companies closer to customers and, therefore, increase their 
competitiveness. They can become more-effective marketers, 
negotiators, and production managers. Let’s explore several 
 areas in which culture has a direct impact on international busi-
ness activity.
Marketing and Cultural Literacy
Many international companies operating in local markets abroad 
take advantage of the public relations value of supporting national 
culture. Some of India’s most precious historical monuments and 
sites are crumbling due to a lack of government funds for upkeep. 
Companies are helping the government to maintain key sites and 
are earning the goodwill of the people.
This chapter introduced the Kluckhohn–Strodtbeck and 
Hofstede frameworks for classifying cultures. Local culture is 
 important for a company exploring international markets for its 
products. We can see the significance of power distance in the 
 export of luxury items. A nation with a large power distance 
 accepts greater inequality among its people and tends to have a 
wealthy upper class that can afford luxury goods. Thus, companies 
marketing products such as expensive jewelry, high-priced cars, 
and even yachts could find wealthy market segments within rela-
tively poor nations.
Work Attitudes and Cultural Literacy
National differences in work attitudes are complex and involve 
other factors in addition to culture. Perceived opportunity for 
 financial reward is no doubt a strong element in attitudes toward 
work in any culture. Research suggests both U.S. and German 
 employees work longer hours when there is a greater likelihood 
that good performance will lead to promotion and increased 
pay. Yet this appears relatively less true in Germany, where wages 
are less variable and job security and jobless benefits (such as 
free national health care) are greater. Thus, other aspects of 
German society are at least as important as culture in determining 
work  attitudes. The culturally literate manager understands the 
 complexity of national workplace attitudes and incorporates this 
knowledge into reward systems.
Expatriates and Cultural Literacy
As stated in our discussion of classifying cultures, people living 
in broadly different cultures tend to respond differently in similar 
business situations. This is why companies that send personnel 
abroad to unfamiliar cultures are concerned with cultural differ-
ences. For example, a Norwegian manager working in Japan for 
a European car manufacturer, but whose colleagues were mostly 
Japanese, soon became frustrated with the time needed to 
make decisions and take action. The main cause for his frustra-
tion was that the uncertainty avoidance index for Japan is much 
larger than that in his native Norway (see Table 2.2). In Japan, 
a greater aversion to uncertainty led to the need for a greater 
number of consultations than would have been needed in the 
home market. The frustrated manager eventually left Japan to 
return to Europe.
gender and Cultural Literacy
In Japan, men have traditionally held nearly all positions of 
 responsibility. Women have generally served as office clerks and 
administrative assistants until their mid- to late 20s, when they 
were expected to marry and then focus on tending to family 
needs. Although this is still largely true today, progress is  being 
made in expanding the role of women in Japan’s business com-
munity. Women own nearly a quarter of all businesses in Japan, 
but many of these businesses are very small and have little eco-
nomic influence. Greater gender equality prevails in Australia, 
Canada, Germany, and the United States, but women in these 
countries still tend to earn less money than men in similar 
positions.
Bottom Line for Business

96  
part 2 • national Business environments
 LO2. Summarize the cultural importance of values and behavior.
• A culture’s values and attitudes are important because they affect work ethic and 
material desires. Understanding the aesthetics that a people value can help improve 
effectiveness and avoid blunders.
• Manners are appropriate behaviors, speech, and dress in a culture, whereas customs 
are appropriate behaviors in specific circumstances. Knowing these can improve 
 performance and help avoid sending unintended messages.
 LO3. Describe the roles of social structure and education in culture.
• Social structure embodies a culture’s fundamental organization. It affects the cost of 
doing business and business decisions such as site selection and advertising methods 
to use.
• Social status and mobility in a culture guide people’s desire for material things and 
their emphasis on work. Firms also consider the influence of family and gender on 
people’s purchase and work decisions.
• Education level affects the quality of the workforce and a people’s standard of 
 living. Wages in a society are determined to a large extent by a people’s educational 
attainment.
 LO4. Outline how the major world religions can influence business.
• Different religions view work, savings, and material goods differently. Protestants 
believe that hard work glorifies God, which is known as the “Protestant work ethic.”
• Strict Hindus disdain materialism and believe in the caste system, which constrains 
consumer markets and can affect work ethic. Western restaurants must adapt to the 
fact that many Hindus are vegetarians or don’t eat beef.
• Islamic governments often ban alcohol consumption so coffee, tea, and soft drinks 
are popular substitutes. Judaism’s religious holidays are often crucial to observe and 
food must often be kosher for believers.
 LO5. Explain the importance of personal communication to international business.
• Personal communication conveys thoughts, feelings, knowledge, and information 
through speech, writings, and actions. Understanding a people’s system of communi-
cation provides insight into their values and behavior.
• Language proficiency can help avoid misunderstandings when nonnative managers 
supervise local employees. It can also help avoid translation blunders in marketing 
and advertising efforts.
• Most body language (including personal space, hand gestures, and handshakes) is 
subtle and takes time to interpret. English is a common lingua franca in this era of 
globalization.
 LO6. Describe how firms and culture interact in the global workplace.
• Attributes such as a culture’s perception of time, view of work, and material culture 
affect many aspects of business, including management styles, work scheduling, and 
reward systems.
• Cultural change occurs when people integrate the gestures, material objects, tradi-
tions, or concepts of another culture through cultural diffusion. Companies may 
change culture when they import new products, policies, and practices into a 
country.
• The two main frameworks used to compare cultures are the Kluckhohn–Strodtbeck 
framework and the Hofstede framework. These frameworks help firms understand 
many aspects of a culture, including risk taking, innovation, job mobility, team coop-
eration, pay levels, and hiring practices.

a range of products and services into the Malaysian market. You are aware of the fact that the 
country boosts a diverse population with distinctive cultural, social, and political segments. It 
may therefore be necessary to factor in different traditions and views that are held by the dif-
ferent groups.

Teaming Up
The Kluckhohn–Strodtbeck framework was created to study cultural differences along six 
dimensions, such as focus on past or future events and belief in individual or group responsi-
bility for personal well-being. In groups of three or four, look at the section in the chapter and 
consider the six dimensions. Apply these dimensions to your own country. Then share your 
suggestions with the class.

Chapter 2 • Cross-Cultural Business  99
A Tale of Two Cultures
M
any cultures in Asia are in the midst of an identity crisis. In 
effect, they are being torn between two worlds. Pulling in 
one direction is a traditional value system derived from agricul-
ture-based communities and extended families—that is, elements 
of a culture in which relatives take care of one another and state-
run welfare systems are unnecessary. Pulling from the opposite 
direction is a new set of values emerging from manufacturing- and 
finance-based economies—elements of a culture in which workers 
must often move to faraway cities to find work, sometimes leaving 
family members to fend for themselves.
For decades, Western multinational corporations set up facto-
ries across Southeast Asia to take advantage of relatively low-cost 
labor. Later, local companies sprang up and became competi-
tive global players in their own right. Spectacular rates of eco-
nomic growth in a few short decades elevated living standards 
 beyond what was thought possible. Young people in Malaysia and 
Thailand felt the lure of “Western” brands. Gucci handbags (www.
gucci.com), Harley-Davidson motorcycles (www.harley-davidson.
com), and other global brands became common symbols of suc-
cess. Many parents felt that brand-consciousness among their 
teenage children signaled familywide success.
Despite the growing consumer society, polls of young people 
show them holding steadfast to traditional values such as respect 
for family and group harmony. Youth in Hong Kong, for example, 
overwhelmingly believe that parents should have a say in how 
hard they study, in how they treat family members and elders, and 
in their choice of friends.
Now globalization is washing over India. An explosion in out-
sourcing jobs caused a social revolution among India’s graduates 
of technical colleges and universities. Unlike in India’s traditional 
high-tech service jobs, young call-center staffers are in direct con-
tact with Western consumers, answering inquiries on items such as 
tummy crunchers and diet pills. For these young, mostly female 
staffers, the work means money, independence, and freedom—
sometimes far away from home in big cities such as Bangalore 
and Mumbai. But in addition to the training in American accents 
and geography, these workers are learning new ideas about family, 
materialism, and relationships.
Parents are suspicious of call-center work because it must 
typically be performed at night in India, when consumers are 
awake in Canada, Europe, or the United States. When her parents 
objected, Binitha Venugopal quit her call-center job in favor of a 
“regular” daytime job. Binitha says her former coworkers’ values 
are changing and that dating and live-in relationships among them 
are common. Indian tradition dictates that young adults live with 
their parents at least until they get married (typically to someone 
their parents choose). Perhaps facilitating shifting values in India 
is an influx of Western professionals, such as lawyers, who 
 accepted good-paying jobs there that could not be found back 
home during the global recession.
Roopa Murthy works for an Indian company that offers call-
center and back-office services. Roopa moved to Bangalore from 
her native Mysore armed with an accounting degree. She now 
earns $400 per month, which is several times what her father 
earned before he retired from his government job. Roopa cut her 
hair short and tossed aside her salwar kameez, the traditional 
loose-fitting clothing she wore back home, in favor of designer-
labeled Western attire.
Although she once shunned drinking and her curfew at home 
was 9 p.m., Roopa now frequents a pub called Geoffrey’s, where 
she enjoys dry martinis and rum, and The Club, a suburban 
disco. Roopa confesses that she is “seeing someone” but that 
her parents would disapprove, adding, “It is difficult to talk to 
Indian parents about things like boyfriends.” She said she some-
times envies her callers’ lives but that she hopes her job will help 
her succeed. “I may be a small-town girl, but there is no way 
I’m  going back to Mysore after this,” she said. Many observers 
wonder whether Asia can embrace modernization and yet retain 
traditional values.
Thinking globally
 2-14. If you worked for an international firm doing business in 
Asia, is there anything you would suggest to ease the ten-
sions these cultures are experiencing? Be specific.
 2-15. Social ills in any country are normally born from a multi-
tude of factors. What role, if any, do you think globalization 
is having in higher reported rates of divorce, crime, and 
drug abuse in Asia?
 2-16. Broadly defined, Asia comprises more than 60 percent 
of the world’s population—a population that practices 
Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, and numerous 
other religions. Do you think it is possible to carry on a 
valid discussion of “Asian” values? Explain.

Understanding Vietnamese Business 
Culture
HANOI, Vietnam—Forming international business alliances is often lucrative but 
can be difficult. An understanding of the culture with which you hope to do business 
is essential in reaching an agreement. Conducting business in Vietnam requires a 
solid understanding of Vietnamese business culture. Many potential business deals 
have been ruined when international business people 
inadvertently disobeyed the norms of Vietnamese 
corporate culture. A single gesture that is considered 
offensive can spell the end of a transaction.
The introduction to potential Vietnamese busi-
ness partners is crucial. Business cards are an impor-
tant part of any business transaction. It is important 
to give and receive a business card with both hands. 
Shaking hands upon meeting and saying goodbye is 
expected. A handshake may use both hands, and it is 
important to bow your head slightly when shaking 
as a sign of respect. Once a successful introduction 
has been made, business talks are given the green 
light, but they are far from easy and success is never 
guaranteed.
Setting up shop in Vietnam always involves 
working with government officials. Some businesses are frustrated by the slow proce-
dure of gaining necessary permits from the government to operate a foreign business. 
It is important to stay in continual, direct contact with the officials responsible for ap-
proving your business. Individual connections are not as important in Vietnam as in 
other Asian nations, as most decisions are made by committee. Business negotiations 
can be confusing, as the Vietnamese attempt to avoid unpleasantness or confrontation. 
Significant misunderstandings can arise if you do not continually check any commit-
ments that are made. Navigating a new culture can take a lot of work and good diplo-
matic skills, but developing solid business relationships in the global economy can be 
a great tool in promoting cross-cultural understanding. As you read this chapter, con-
sider how companies adapt to different cultures when conducting business with global 
partners.1

part 2 • national Business environments
As business men and women venture abroad, they can encounter social and economic environ-
ments that are unlike anything they’ve ever experienced. In Chapter 2 we learned how significant 
it is for employees of a company to have cultural knowledge when doing business with people 
from other countries. Another crucial element of international business success is an understand-
ing of other countries’ political, economic, and legal systems.
Political economy is the study of how a country manages its affairs by using its political, 
economic, and legal systems. Any nation’s political economy reflects how its people put their 
preferred political, economic, and legal theories into practice and the institutions they create. 
Yet, political economy does not arise in a vacuum—it forms within a cultural context. Therefore, 
political economies vary from nation to nation in their degree of openness, individualism, equal-
ity, transparency, flexibility, and so on.
Individualism is a belief that the concerns of individuals should be placed above the group’s 
welfare. Collectivism, on the other hand, stresses the primacy of the group over individual needs. 
As we learned in Chapter 2, no nation is either completely individualist or completely collectiv-
ist in its cultural orientation. Likewise, the political economy of every nation displays a unique 
blend of individual and group values. In other words, no political economy is entirely focused on 
individual needs at the expense of social well-being, and vice-versa.
Firms involved in international business should understand how different systems of politi-
cal economy operate. This applies not only to companies with traditional, brick-and-mortar sub-
sidiaries abroad, but also to Internet-based companies and many types of service firms Rupert 
Murdoch’s News Corp. (www.newscorp.com) removed BBC news (www.bbc.co.uk) from its 
Asian lineup of television stations because of its criticisms of China. Barnes & Noble (www.
barnesandnoble.com) and Amazon (www.amazon.com) stopped selling the English-language 
version of Mein Kampf to Germans when the German government complained (although it’s 
illegal only to sell the German-language version). A statement by Barnes & Noble read, “Our 
policy with regard to censorship remains unchanged. But as responsible corporate citizens, we 
respect the laws of the countries where we do business.”2
Google (www.google.com) had to skillfully handle protests by German politicians and citi-
zens who decried its plan to introduce its mapping service called Street View there. Memories 
of secret police prying into personal lives under past dictatorial regimes make Germans fearful 
of allowing the entire world to see photos of their homes and gardens on the Internet.3 Knowing 
how different political economies function can help companies avoid trouble and be more effec-
tive in their operations.

Chapter 3 • politiCal eConomy and ethiCs  103
In this chapter, we present the basic differences between the main types of political, 
 economic, and legal systems around the world. We also discuss several legal topics that hold 
special importance for international business activities. We close this chapter with a look at key 
issues of ethical behavior and social responsibility.
Political Systems
Understanding the nature of political systems in other countries can reduce the risks of 
 conducting international business there. A political system includes the structures, processes, 
and activities by which a nation governs itself. Japan’s political system, for instance, features a 
Diet (Parliament) that chooses a prime minister who will carry out the operations of government 
with the help of Cabinet ministers. The Diet consists of two houses of elected representatives 
who enact the nation’s laws. These laws affect the personal lives of people living in and visiting 
Japan, as well as the activities of companies doing business there.
A country’s political system is rooted in the history and culture of its people. Factors 
such as population, age and race composition, and per capita income influence a country’s 
political system. In Switzerland the political system actively encourages all eligible members 
of society to vote. By means of public referendums, Swiss citizens vote directly on many 
national issues. The Swiss system works because Switzerland consists of a relatively small 
population living in a small geographic area. Contrast this practice with that of most other 
democracies, in which representatives of the people, not the people themselves, vote on 
national issues.
We can arrange the world’s three political ideologies on a horizontal scale, with 
one on either end and one in the middle. At the one extreme lies anarchism—the belief that 
only  individuals and private groups should control a nation’s political activities. An anar-
chist views public government as unnecessary and unwanted because it tramples personal 
liberties.
At the other extreme lies totalitarianism—the belief that every aspect of people’s lives 
must be controlled for a nation’s political system to be effective. Totalitarianism disregards indi-
vidual liberties and treats people as slaves of the political system. The state reigns supreme over 
 institutions such as family, religion, business, and labor. Totalitarian political systems include 
authoritarian regimes such as communism and fascism.
Between those two extremes lies pluralism—the belief that both private and public groups 
play important roles in a nation’s political activities. Each group (consisting of people with dif-
ferent ethnic, racial, class, and lifestyle backgrounds) serves to balance the power that can be 
gained by the others. Pluralistic political systems include democracies, constitutional monar-
chies, and some aristocracies.
To better understand how elements of politics influence international business let’s take a 
detailed look at the different forms of the two most common political systems: totalitarianism 
and democracy.
Totalitarianism
In a totalitarian system, individuals govern without the support of the people, tightly control 
people’s lives, and do not tolerate opposing viewpoints. Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler and 
the former Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin are historical examples of totalitarian governments. 
Today, North Korea is the most prominent example of a totalitarian government. Totalitarian lead-
ers attempt to silence those with opposing political views and, therefore, require the near-total 
centralization of political power. But a “pure” form of totalitarianism is not possible because no 
totalitarian government is capable of entirely silencing all its critics.
Totalitarian governments tend to share three features:
• Imposed Authority An individual or group forms the political system without the 
 explicit or implicit approval of the people. Leaders often acquire and retain power through 
military force or fraudulent elections. In some cases, they come to power through legiti-
mate means but then remain in office after their terms expire.
• Lack of Constitutional Guarantees Totalitarian systems deny citizens the constitu-
tional guarantees woven into the fabric of democratic practice. They limit, abuse, or reject

 concepts such as freedom of expression, periodically held elections, guaranteed civil and 
property rights, and minority rights.
• Restricted Participation Political representation is limited to parties sympathetic to the 
government or to those who pose no credible threat. In most cases, political opposition is 
completely banned, and political dissidents are severely punished.
TheOCrATiC TOTALiTAriAnism A political system in which a country’s religious leaders 
are also its political leaders is called a theocracy. The religious leaders enforce a set of laws 
and regulations based on religious beliefs. A political system under the control of totalitarian 
religious leaders is called theocratic totalitarianism.
Iran is a prominent example of a theocratic totalitarian state. Iran has been an Islamic state 
since the 1979 revolution in which the reigning monarch was overthrown. Today, many young 
Iranians appear disenchanted with the strict code imposed on many aspects of their public and 
private lives, including stringent laws against products and ideas deemed too “Western.” They 
may not question their religious beliefs but yearn for a more open society.
seCuLAr TOTALiTAriAnism A political system in which political leaders rely on military and 
bureaucratic power is called secular totalitarianism. It takes three forms: communist, tribal, 
and right-wing.
Under communist totalitarianism (referred to here simply as communism), the govern-
ment maintains sweeping political and economic powers. The Communist Party controls all 
aspects of the political system, and opposition parties are given little or no voice. In general, 
each party member holding office is required to support all government policies, and dissen-
sion is rarely permitted. Communism is the belief that social and economic equality can be 
obtained only by establishing an all-powerful Communist Party and by instituting socialism—
a system in which the government owns and controls all types of economic activity. This 
includes granting the government ownership of the means of production (such as capital, land, 
and factories) and the power to decide what the economy produces and the prices at which 
goods are sold.
However, important distinctions separate communism from socialism. Communists follow 
the teachings of Marx and Lenin, believe that a violent revolution is needed to seize control over 
resources, and wish to eliminate political opposition. Socialists believe in none of these. Thus, 
communists are socialists, but socialists are not necessarily communist.
Under tribal totalitarianism, one tribe (or ethnic group) imposes its will on others with 
whom it shares a national identity. Tribal totalitarianism characterizes the governments of 
several African nations, including Burundi and Rwanda. When the European colonial powers 
departed Africa, many national boundaries were created with little regard to ethnic differences 
among the people. People of different ethnicities found themselves living in the same nation, 
whereas members of the same ethnicity found themselves living in different nations. In time, 
certain ethnic groups gained political and military power over other groups. Animosity among 
them often erupted in bloody conflict.
Nations mired in military conflict pay a hefty price in terms of sustainability. Over the 
decades, civil war has inflicted enormous human, social, and environmental costs on many 
African nations, for example. To explore the costs of civil wars (particularly in Africa) and 
how developed nations can help put an end to them, see the Global Sustainability feature, titled 
“From Civil War to Civil Society.”
Under right-wing totalitarianism, the government endorses private ownership of property 
and a market-based economy but grants few (if any) political freedoms. Leaders generally strive 
for economic growth while opposing left-wing totalitarianism (communism). Argentina, Brazil, 
Chile, and Paraguay all had right-wing totalitarian governments in the 1980s.
Despite the inherent contradictions between communism and right-wing totalitarianism, 
China’s political system is currently a mix of the two ideologies. China’s leaders are engineer-
ing high economic growth by implementing certain characteristics of a capitalist economy while 
retaining a hard line in the political sphere. The Chinese government is selling off money-losing, 
state-run companies and encouraging the investment needed to modernize its factories. But 
China’s government still has little patience for dissidents who demand greater political freedom, 
and it does not allow a completely free press.

Chapter 3 • politiCal eConomy and ethiCs  105
DOing Business in TOTALiTAriAn COunTries What are the costs and benefits of doing 
business in a totalitarian nation? On the plus side, international companies can be relatively less 
concerned with local political opposition to their activities. On the negative side, they might 
need to pay bribes and kickbacks to government officials. Refusal to pay could result in loss of 
market access or even forfeiture of investments in the country.
In any case, doing business in a totalitarian country can be a risky proposition. In a country 
such as the United States, laws regarding the resolution of contractual disputes are quite spe-
cific. In totalitarian nations, the law can be either vague or nonexistent, and people in powerful 
government positions can interpret laws largely as they please. In China, for instance, it may not 
matter so much what the law states but rather how individual bureaucrats interpret the law. The 
arbitrary nature of totalitarian governments makes it hard for companies to know how laws will 
be interpreted and applied to their particular business dealings.
Companies that operate in totalitarian nations are sometimes criticized for lacking compas-
sion for people hurt by the oppressive policies of their hosts. Executives must decide whether to 
refrain from investing in totalitarian countries—and miss potentially profitable opportunities—
or invest and bear the brunt of potentially damaging publicity. There are no simple answers 
to this controversial issue, which amounts to an ethical dilemma (we cover ethics later in this 
chapter).
Democracy
A democracy is a political system in which government leaders are elected directly by the wide 
participation of the people or by their representatives. Democracy differs from totalitarianism in 
nearly every respect. The foundations of modern democracy go back at least as far as the ancient 
Greeks.
The Greeks tried to practice a pure democracy, one in which all citizens participate freely 
and actively in the political process. But a pure democracy is more an ideal than a workable 
system for several reasons. Some people have neither the time nor the desire to get involved 
in the political process. Also, citizens are less able to participate completely and actively as a 
democracy
Political system in which 
government leaders are elected

representatives.
migrations (which worsen and spread disease). Gross 
 domestic product (GDP) falls by 2.2 percent, and another 
18 percent of income is spent on arms and militias. Full 
 economic recovery takes a decade, which reduces output by 
about 105 percent of the nation’s prewar GDP.
• What To Do Because the risk of civil war is cut in half when 
income per person doubles, conflicts may be prevented 
by funneling more aid to poor nations. Also, war might 
be limited by restricting a nation in conflict from spending 
the proceeds from its exports on munitions or by lower-
ing the world market price of those exports. Finally, to halt 
 nations from slipping back into civil war, health and education 
aid could be increased after war ends, or a foreign power 
could intervene to keep the peace.

Today, most wars occur within nations that were once controlled 
and stabilized by colonial powers. If these nations are to prosper 
from globalization, they must break the vicious cycle whereby con-
flict causes poverty and poverty causes conflict.
• War’s Root Causes Although tribal or ethnic rivalry is typi-
cally blamed for starting civil wars, the most common causes 
are poverty, low economic growth, and dependency on natu-
ral resource exports. In fact, the poorest one-sixth of human-
ity endures four-fifths of the world’s civil wars. Still, religious 
differences increasingly underlie civil conflicts.
• What’s at Stake It appeared that ethnic conflict was the root 
of pitched battles in Bunia, in the eastern part of Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. Yet the Hema and the Lendu tribes 
only began fighting each other when neighboring Uganda 
(so that it could control mineral-rich Bunia) started arming 
rival militias in 1999. In the Darfur region of Sudan, Arab 
Muslims battle black non-Muslims. Depending on whom you 
ask the conflict began as a fight over pastures and livestock 
or over the oil beneath them. Meanwhile, foreign investors 
remain wary.
• What Is Lost On average, a civil conflict lasts eight years. 
And apart from the terrible human cost in lives and health, 
there is also a financial cost. Health costs are $5 billion per 
conflict because of collapsed health systems and forced 
global sustainability    From Civil War to Civil Society

population grows and as the barriers of distance and time increase. Finally, leaders in a pure 
democracy may find it difficult or impossible to form cohesive policies because direct voting can 
lead to conflicting popular opinion.
represenTATive DemOCrACy For practical reasons most nations resort to a representative 
democracy in which citizens elect individuals from their groups to represent their political 
views. These representatives then help govern the people and pass laws. The people reelect 
representatives they approve of and replace those they no longer want representing them.
Representative democracies strive to provide some or all of the following:
• Freedom of Expression A constitutional right in most democracies, freedom of expres-
sion ideally grants the right to voice opinions freely and without fear of punishment.
• Periodic Elections Each elected representative serves for a period of time, after which 
the people (or electorate) decide whether to retain that representative. Two examples of 
periodic elections include the U.S. presidential elections (held every four years) and the 
French presidential elections (held every five years).
• Full Civil and Property Rights Civil rights include freedom of speech, freedom to 
 organize political parties, and the right to a fair trial. Property rights are the privileges and 
responsibilities of owners of property (homes, cars, businesses, and so forth).
• Minority Rights In theory, democracies try to preserve peaceful coexistence among 
groups of people with diverse cultural, ethnic, and racial backgrounds. Ideally, the same 
rights and privileges extend legally to each group, no matter how few its members.
• Nonpolitical Bureaucracies The bureaucracy is the part of government that imple-
ments the rules and laws passed by elected representatives. In politicized bureaucracies, 
bureaucrats tend to implement decisions according to their own political views rather than 
those of the people’s representatives. This clearly contradicts the purpose of the democratic 
process.
Despite such shared principles, countries vary greatly in the practice of representative 
democracy. Britain, for example, practices parliamentary democracy. The nation divides 
itself into geographical districts, and people in each district vote for competing parties rather 
than individual candidates. But the party that wins the greatest number of legislative seats in 
an election does not automatically win the right to run the country. Rather, a party must gain an 
representative democracy

individuals from their groups to

Freedom of expression is 
a fundamental right that 
most democracies strive to 
uphold. protesters in the 
philippines hold black placards 
symbolizing the suppression 
of freedom of expression due 
to the passing of Cyber Crime 
law, which penalizes online 
libel. the law’s supporters say 
that it helps authorities curb 
online fraud, identity theft, 
and crimes against children. 
To limit and tightly control 
the news that ordinary people 
receive, some countries block

of foreign broadcasts from 
all sorts of media. in what 
ways do you think freedom

society?

absolute majority—that is, the number of representatives that a party gets elected must exceed 
the number of representatives elected among all other parties.
If the party with the largest number of representatives lacks an absolute majority, it can join 
with one or more other parties to form a coalition government. In a coalition government, the 
strongest political parties share power by dividing government responsibilities among them-
selves. Coalition governments are often formed in Italy, Israel, and the Netherlands, where 
a large number of political parties make it difficult for any single party to gain an absolute 
majority.
Nations also differ in the relative power that each political party commands. In some 
democratic countries, a single political party has effectively controlled the system for decades. 
In Japan, for example, the Liberal Democratic Party (which is actually conservative) has enjoyed 
nearly uninterrupted control of the government since the 1950s. In Mexico, the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI) ran the country for 71 years until 2001 when the conservative 
National Action Party (PAN) won the presidency. But then the presidential election of 2012 
placed the PRI back in power.4
DOing Business in DemOCrACies Democracies maintain stable business environments 
primarily through laws that protect individual property rights. In theory, commerce prospers 
when the private sector includes independently owned firms that seek to earn profits. 
Capitalism is the belief that ownership of the means of production belongs in the hands of 
individuals and private businesses. Capitalism is also frequently referred to as the free market.
Although participative democracy, property rights, and free markets tend to encourage 
economic growth, they do not always do so. For instance, although India is the world’s largest 
democracy, it experienced slow economic growth for decades until recently. Meanwhile, some 
countries achieved rapid economic growth under political systems that were not truly demo-
cratic. The four tigers of Asia—Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan—built strong 
market economies in the absence of truly democratic practices.
Wherever in the world a business man or woman goes, whether to a democracy or to 
a totalitarian nation, it is essential that he or she be mindful of personal safety. Certainly, 
advancements in technology and transportation make it easier to do business globally. But 
because globalization also can increase efficiency for people with ulterior motives, trouble can 
arise spontaneously almost anywhere. For ways to keep a low profile and stay safe while on 
business abroad, see this chapter’s Manager’s Briefcase feature, titled “Your Global Security 
Checklist.”

• Getting There Take nonstop flights when possible, as 
 accidents are more likely during takeoffs and landings. Move 
quickly from an airport’s public and check-in areas to more 
secure areas beyond passport control. Report abandoned 
packages to airport security.
• Getting Around Kidnappers watch for daily routines. Vary 
the exits you use to leave your house, office, and hotel, and 
vary the time that you depart and arrive. Drive with your win-
dows up and doors locked. Swap cars with others occasion-
ally, or take a cab one day and ride the tram/subway the next. 
Be discreet regarding your itinerary.
• Keep a Low Profile Don’t draw attention by pulling out a 
large wad of currency or paying with large denominations. 
Avoid public demonstrations. Dress like the locals when 
possible and leave expensive jewelry at home. Avoid loud 
conversation and being overheard. If you rent an auto-
mobile, avoid the flashy car and choose a local, common 
model.
• Guard Personal Data Be friendly but cautious when answer-
ing questions about you, your family, and your employment. 
Keep answers short and vague when possible. Give out your 
work number only—all family members should do the same. 
Do not list your home or mobile phone numbers in directo-
ries. Do not carry items in your purse or wallet that contain 
your home address.
• Use Caution Be cautious if a local asks directions or the 
time—it could be a mugging ploy. When possible, travel with 
others and avoid walking alone after dark. Avoid narrow, dimly 
lit streets. If you get lost, act as if you know where you are, and 
ask directions from a place of business, not passersby. Beware 
of offers by drivers of unmarked or poorly marked cabs.
• Know Emergency Procedures Be familiar with the local 
emergency procedures before trouble strikes. Keep the 
phone numbers of police, fire, your hotel, your nation’s 
 embassy, and a reputable taxi service in your home and with 
you at all times.

Economic Systems
A country’s economic system consists of the structure and processes that it uses to allocate its 
resources and conduct its commercial activities. Every economy displays a tendency toward 
individualist or collectivist economic values that reflects the nation’s culture. For example, one 
culture might prefer theories grounded in individual freedom and responsibility and create a 
capitalist economic system. Meanwhile, another culture might value collectivist ideas and build 
a socialist, or even communist, system.
We can arrange national economies on a horizontal scale that is anchored by two extremes. 
At one end of the scale is a theoretical pure centrally planned economy, at the other end is a 
theoretical pure market economy, and in between is a mixed economy (see Figure 3.1).
Centrally planned economy
A centrally planned economy is a system in which a nation’s land, factories, and other 
 economic resources are owned by the government. The government makes nearly all economy-
related decisions—including who produces what and the prices of products, labor, and capital. 
Central planning agencies specify production goals for factories and other production units, 
and they even decide prices. In the former Soviet Union, for example, communist officials set 
prices for milk, bread, eggs, and other essential goods. The ultimate goal of central planning is 
to achieve a wide range of political, social, and economic objectives by taking complete control 
over the production and distribution of a nation’s resources.
Origins Of The CenTrALLy pLAnneD eCOnOmy Central planning is rooted in the ideology 
of collectivism. Just as collectivist cultures emphasize group over individual goals, a centrally 
planned economy strives to achieve economic and social equality for the sake of the collective, 
not the individual.
German philosopher Karl Marx popularized the idea of central economic planning in 
the nineteenth century. Marx formulated his ideas while witnessing the hardship endured by 
working-class people in Europe during and after the Industrial Revolution. Marx argued that the 
economy could not be reformed, but that it must be overthrown and replaced with a more equi-
table “communist” system.
Different versions of Marx’s ideas were implemented in the twentieth century by means of 
violent upheaval. Revolutions installed totalitarian economic and political systems in Russia in 
1917, in China and North Korea in the late 1940s, and in Cuba in 1959. By the 1970s, central 
planning was the economic law in lands stretching across Central and Eastern Europe (Albania, 
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia), Asia 
(Cambodia, China, North Korea, and Vietnam), Africa (Angola and Mozambique), and Latin 
America (Cuba and Nicaragua).

DeCLine Of CenTrAL pLAnning In the late 1980s, nation after nation began to dismantle 
communist central planning in favor of market-based economies. Shortly after the former Soviet 
Union implemented its twin policies of glasnost (political openness) and perestroika (economic 
reform), its totalitarian government crumbled. Communist governments in Central and Eastern 
Europe fell soon after, and today countries such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, 
Romania, and Ukraine have republican governments. There are far fewer communist nations 
than there were two decades ago, although Cuba and North Korea remain hard-line communist 
nations. Let’s now examine several factors that economists, historians, and political scientists 
say contributed to the decline of centrally planned economies.
failure to Create economic value Central planners paid little attention to the task of producing 
quality goods and services at the lowest possible cost. In other words, they failed to see that 
commercial activities succeed when they create economic value for customers. Along the way, 
scarce resources were wasted in the pursuit of commercial activities that were not self-sustaining.
failure to provide incentives Government ownership of economic resources drastically 
reduced incentives for businesses to maximize the output obtained from those resources. Except 
for aerospace, nuclear power, and other sciences (in which government scientists excelled), there 
were few incentives to create new technologies, new products, and new production methods. The 
result was little or no economic growth and consistently low standards of living.
As the world’s most closed economy, North Korea has earned its nickname, “The Hermit 
Kingdom.” For the most part, its policy of juche (self-reliance) is causing extreme hardship for 
North Korea’s citizens. The combination of recurring floods and droughts, a shortage of fertil-
izers, and a lack of farm machinery restrain the nation from reaching its peak food-production 
potential. As a result, North Korea often must rely on aid from abroad to feed its people.
failure to Achieve rapid growth Leaders in communist nations took note of the high rates of 
economic growth in countries such as Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan—called 
Asia’s four tigers. That a once-poor region of the world had so rapidly achieved such astounding 
growth awakened central planners to the possibilities. They realized that an economic system 
based on private ownership fosters growth much better than one hampered by central planning.
North Korea, once again, provides us with a good example. Each year for a decade until 
1999, the North Korean economy contracted. Out of desperation, the country’s leaders quietly 
allowed limited free market reforms, and small bazaars soon dotted the countryside. Street-
corner currency exchanges sprang up to help facilitate a tiny but growing trade with bordering 
Chinese merchants. Impoverished North Koreans could buy mobile phones and found hope for a 
better life in DVDs of South Korean soap operas. But a disastrous attempt to reform its currency 
dealt a serious setback to North Korea’s experiment with the free market.5 For now, at least, the 
last green shoots of capitalism in North Korea seem to be coming from its Kaesong Industrial 
Complex along its border with South Korea. The one-of-a-kind industrial park buses in around 
500 South Korean managers daily to manage around 44,000 North Korean factory workers. But 
its future is uncertain amid volatile relations between the North and South and because many 
South Korean businesses involved in the project are losing money.6
failure to satisfy Consumer needs People in centrally planned economies were tired of a 
standard of living that had slipped far below that found in market economies. Ironically, although 
central planning was conceived as a means to create a more equitable system of distributing 
wealth, too many central planners failed to provide even basic necessities such as adequate food, 
housing, and medical care. Underground (shadow) economies for all kinds of goods and services 
flourished and, in some cases, even outgrew “official” economies. Prices of goods on the black 
market were much higher than the official (and artificial) prices set by governments.
mixed economy
A mixed economy is a system in which land, factories, and other economic resources are rather 
equally split between private and government ownership. In a mixed economy, the government 
owns fewer economic resources than does the government in a centrally planned economy. 
Yet in a mixed economy, the government tends to control the economic sectors that it considers 
important to national security and long-term stability. Such sectors usually include iron and steel

resources are rather equally split

manufacturing (for building military equipment), oil and gas production (to guarantee continued 
manufacturing and availability), and automobile manufacturing (to guarantee employment for a 
large portion of the workforce). Many mixed economies also maintain generous welfare systems 
to support the unemployed and to provide health care for the general population.
Mixed economies are found all around the world: Denmark, France, Norway, Spain, and 
Sweden in Western Europe; India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and South Korea in Asia; 
Argentina in South America; and South Africa. Although all the governments of these nations 
do not centrally plan their economies, they all influence economic activity by means of special 
incentives, including hefty subsidies to key industries, and through significant government 
involvement in the economy.
Origins Of The mixeD eCOnOmy Advocates of mixed economies contend that a successful 
economic system not only must be efficient and innovative but also should protect society from 
the excesses of unchecked individualism and organizational greed. The goal is to achieve low 
unemployment, low poverty, steady economic growth, and an equitable distribution of wealth by 
means of the most effective policies.
Proponents of mixed economies point out that European and U.S. rates of productivity 
and growth were almost identical for decades after the Second World War. Although the United 
States has created more jobs, it has done so at the cost of widening social inequality, proponents 
say. They argue that nations with mixed economies should not dismantle their social-welfare 
institutions but should modernize them so that they contribute to national competitiveness. 
Austria, the Netherlands, and Sweden are taking this route. In the Netherlands, labor unions and 
the government agreed to an epic deal involving wage restraint, shorter working hours, budget 
discipline, new tolerance for part-time and temporary work, and the trimming of social benefits. 
As a result, unemployment in the Netherlands hovers around 7 percent. By comparison, the 
average jobless rate for all nations in the Euro currency area is around 12 percent.7
DeCLine Of mixeD eCOnOmies Many mixed economies are remaking themselves to more 
closely resemble free markets. When assets are owned by the government, there seems to be 
less incentive to eliminate waste or to practice innovation. Extensive government ownership 
on a national level tends to result in a lack of accountability, rising costs, and slow economic 
growth. Many government-owned businesses in mixed economies need large infusions of 
taxpayer money to survive as world-class competitors, which raises taxes and prices for goods 
and services. Underpinning the move toward market-based systems is the sale of government-
owned businesses.

tech endeavor in the world’s

move toward privatization As discussed earlier, citizens of many European nations prefer 
a combination of rich benefits and higher unemployment to the low jobless rates and smaller 
social safety net of the United States. In France, for instance, the French electorate continues to 
hold fast to a deeply embedded tradition of social welfare and job security in government-owned 
firms. Many French believe the social security and cohesion benefits of a more collectivist 
economy outweigh the efficiency advantages of an individualist one. Yet such attitudes are 
costly in terms of economic efficiency.
The selling of government-owned economic resources to private operators is called 
 privatization. Privatization helps eliminate subsidized materials, labor, and capital formerly 
provided to government-owned companies. It also curtails the practice of appointing managers 
for political reasons rather than for their professional expertise. To survive, newly privatized 
companies must produce competitive products at fair prices because they are subject to the 
forces of the free market. The overall aim of privatization is to increase economic efficiency, 
boost productivity, and raise living standards.
market economy
In a market economy, the majority of a nation’s land, factories, and other economic resources 
are privately owned, either by individuals or businesses. This means that who produces what and 
the prices of products, labor, and capital in a market economy are determined by the interplay of 
two forces:
• Supply: the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing to provide at a  specific 
selling price
• Demand: the quantity of a good or service that buyers are willing to purchase at a  specific 
selling price
As supply and demand change for a good or service, so does its selling price. The lower 
a product’s price, the greater demand will be; the higher its price, the lower demand will be. 
Likewise, the lower a product’s price, the smaller the quantity that producers will supply; the 
higher the price, the greater the quantity they will supply. In this respect, what is called the 
“price mechanism” (or “market mechanism”) dictates supply and demand.
Market forces and uncontrollable natural forces also influence product prices. Chocolate 
lovers, for example, should consider how the interplay of several forces affects the price of 
cocoa, the principal ingredient in chocolate. Suppose cocoa consumption suddenly rises in 
large cocoa-consuming nations such as Britain, Japan, and the United States. Suppose further 
that disease and pests plague crops in cocoa-producing countries such as Brazil, Ghana, and the 
Ivory Coast. As worldwide consumption of cocoa begins to outstrip production, market pressure 
is felt on both the demand side (consumers) and the supply side (producers). Falling worldwide 
reserves of cocoa then force the price of cocoa higher.
Origins Of The mArkeT eCOnOmy Market economics is rooted in the belief that individual 
concerns should be placed above group concerns. According to this view, the entire group 
benefits when individuals receive incentives and rewards to act in certain ways. It is argued that 
people take better care of property they own and that individuals have fewer incentives to care 
for property under a system of public ownership.
Laissez-faire economics For many centuries, the world’s dominant economic philosophy 
supported government control of a significant portion of a society’s assets and government 
involvement in its international trade. But in the mid-1700s a new approach to national 
economics called for less government interference in commerce and greater individual economic 
freedom. This approach became known as a laissez-faire system, loosely translated from French 
as “allow them to do [without interference].”
Canada and the United States are examples of contemporary market economies. It is no 
accident that both these countries have individualist cultures (although Canada to a somewhat 
lesser extent than the United States). Just as an emphasis on individualism fosters a democratic 
form of government, it also supports a market economy.
feATures Of A mArkeT eCOnOmy To function smoothly and properly, a market economy 
requires three things: free choice, free enterprise, and price flexibility.

• Free choice gives individuals access to alternative purchase options. In a market economy, 
few restrictions are placed on consumers’ ability to make their own decisions and exercise 
free choice. For example, a consumer shopping for a new car is guaranteed a variety from 
which to choose. The consumer can choose among dealers, models, sizes, styles, colors, 
and mechanical specifications such as engine size and transmission type.
• Free enterprise gives companies the ability to decide which goods and services to produce 
and the markets in which to compete. Companies are free to enter new and different lines 
of business, select geographic markets and customer segments to pursue, hire workers, and 
advertise their products. They are, therefore, guaranteed the right to pursue interests profit-
able to them.
• Price flexibility allows most prices to rise and fall to reflect the forces of supply and 
 demand. By contrast, nonmarket economies often set and maintain prices at stipulated 
levels. Interfering with the price mechanism violates a fundamental principle of the market 
economy.
gOvernmenT’s rOLe in A mArkeT eCOnOmy In a market economy, the government has 
far less direct involvement in business than it does in centrally-planned or mixed economies. 
Even so, government in a market economy plays four important roles.
enforcing Antitrust Laws When one company is able to control a product’s supply—and, 
therefore, its price—it is considered a monopoly. Antitrust (antimonopoly) laws prevent 
companies from fixing prices, sharing markets, and gaining unfair monopoly advantages. They 
are designed to encourage the development of industries with as many competing businesses 
as the market will sustain. In competitive industries the forces of competition keep prices low. 
By enforcing antitrust laws, governments prevent trade-restraining monopolies and business 
combinations that exploit consumers and constrain the growth of commerce.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of the U.S. government seeks to ensure the 
 competitive and efficient functioning of the nation’s markets. But the FTC (www.ftc.gov) can 
also  evaluate proposed deals outside the United States when the U.S. market is likely to be 
affected. For example, the FTC reviewed the proposed acquisition of Sweden’s Svedala Industri 
by Finland’s Metso Corporation (www.metso.com). Metso and Svedala were the world’s two 
largest suppliers of rock-processing equipment at the time. In response to FTC concerns over 
potential anticompetitive effects in the global market for rock-processing equipment, the two 
companies agreed to sell parts of the combined business to third parties in return for FTC 
approval of the acquisition.
preserving property rights A smoothly functioning market economy rests on a legal system 
that safeguards individual property rights. By preserving and protecting individual property 
rights, governments encourage individuals and companies to take risks such as investing 
in technology, inventing new products, and starting new businesses. Strong protection of 
property rights ensures entrepreneurs that their claims to assets and future earnings are legally 
safeguarded. This protection also supports a healthy business climate in which a market 
economy can flourish.
providing a stable fiscal and monetary environment Unstable economies are often 
characterized by high inflation and unemployment. These forces create general uncertainty 
about a nation’s suitability as a place to do business. Governments can help control inflation 
through effective fiscal policies (policies regarding taxation and government spending) and 
monetary policies (policies controlling money supply and interest rates). A stable economic 
environment helps companies make better forecasts of costs, revenues, and the future of the 
business in general. Such conditions reduce the risks associated with future investments, such as 
new product development and business expansion.
preserving political stability A market economy depends on a stable government for its 
smooth operation and, indeed, for its future existence. Political stability helps businesses engage 
in activities without worrying about terrorism, kidnappings, and other political threats to their 
operations. (See Chapter 4 for extensive coverage of political risk and stability.)
eCOnOmiC freeDOm So far we have discussed the essence of market economies as being 
grounded in freedom: free choice, free enterprise, free prices, and freedom from direct

intervention by government. Map 3.1 (on pages 114–115) classifies countries according to 
their levels of economic freedom. Factors making up each country’s rating include trade policy, 
government intervention in the economy, property rights, black markets, and wage and price 
controls. Most developed economies are completely or mostly free, but most emerging markets 
and developing nations are far less free.
Earlier, we learned that the connection between political freedom and economic growth is 
not at all certain. Likewise, we can say only that countries with the greatest economic freedom 
tend to have the highest standards of living, whereas those with the lowest freedom tend to have 
the lowest standards of living. But greater economic freedom does not guarantee a high per 
capita income. A country can rank very low on economic freedom yet have a higher per capita 
income than a country with far greater freedom.

Legal Systems
A country’s legal system is its set of laws and regulations, including the processes by which its 
laws are enacted and enforced and the ways in which its courts hold parties accountable for their 
actions. Many cultural factors—including ideas on social mobility, religion, and  individualism—
influence a nation’s legal system. Likewise, many laws and regulations are enacted to safeguard 
cultural values and beliefs. For several examples of how legal systems differ from nation to 
 nation, see this chapter’s Culture Matters feature, titled “Playing by the Rules.”
A country’s political system also influences its legal system. Totalitarian governments 
tend to favor public ownership of economic resources and enact laws limiting entrepreneur-
ial behavior. By contrast, democracies tend to encourage entrepreneurial activity and protect 
business with strong property-rights laws. The rights and responsibilities of parties to business 
legal system
Set of laws and regulations, 
including the processes by which 
a country’s laws are enacted and

courts hold parties accountable 
for their actions.
Understanding legal systems in other countries begins with an 
awareness of cultural differences. Here are snapshots of several 
 nations’ legal environments:
• Japan Japan’s harmony-based, consensus-driven culture 
considers court battles to be a last resort. But with growing 
patent disputes and a rise in cross-border mergers, Japan 
is discovering the value of lawyers. Japan has just 22,000 
licensed attorneys compared with more than one million in 
the United States. So Japan is now minting thousands of 
new lawyers every year. Japanese businesses now  litigate 
disputes that once might have been settled between 
parties.
• Saudi Arabia Islam permeates every aspect of Saudi 
Arabia and affects its laws, politics, economics, and social 
 development. Islamic law is grounded in religious teachings 
contained in the Koran and governs both criminal and civil 
cases. The Koran, in fact, is considered Saudi Arabia’s con-
stitution. The king and the council of ministers exercise all 
executive and legislative authority within the framework of 
Islamic law.
• China Factory workers in China must sometimes endure 
 military-style drills, verbal abuse, and mockery. But labor 
groups are winning higher wages, better working conditions, 
and better housing from a flock of lawyers and law students 
who hold free seminars and argue labor cases in China’s 
courts. Inadequate protection of workers’ rights is giving way 
to better conditions for China’s 169 million factory workers.

transactions also differ from nation to nation. Political systems and legal systems, therefore, are 
naturally interlocked. A country’s political system inspires and endorses its legal system, and its 
legal system legitimizes and supports its political system.
Legal systems are frequently influenced by political moods and upsurges of  nationalism—
the devotion of a people to their nation’s interests and advancement. Nationalism typically 
involves intense national loyalty and cultural pride and is often associated with drives toward 
national independence. In India, for example, most business laws originated when the coun-
try was struggling for “self-sufficiency.” As a result, the legal system tended to protect local 
businesses from international competition. Although years ago India had nationalized many 
industries and closely scrutinized business applications, today its government is embracing glo-
balization by enacting pro-business laws. With that brief introduction, let’s now examine the key 
characteristics of common law, civil law, and theocratic law.

Common Law
The practice of common law originated in eleventh-century England and was adopted in that 
nation’s territories worldwide. The U.S. legal system, therefore, is based largely on the common 
law tradition (although it integrates some aspects of civil law). A common law legal system 
reflects three elements:
• Tradition A country’s legal history
• Precedent Past cases that have come before the courts
• Usage How laws are applied in specific situations
The justice system decides cases by interpreting the law on the basis of tradition, precedent, 
and usage. Yet each law may be interpreted somewhat differently in each case to which it is 
applied. In turn, each new interpretation sets a precedent that may be followed in later cases. As 
new precedents arise, laws are altered to clarify vague wording or to accommodate situations not 
previously considered.
Business contracts tend to be lengthy in common-law nations (especially the United 
States) because they must consider many possible contingencies and many possible interpre-
tations of the law in case of a dispute. Companies devote considerable time to devising clear 
contracts and spend large sums of money on legal advice. On the positive side, common-law 
systems are flexible. Instead of applying uniformly to all situations, laws take into account 
particular situations and circumstances. The common-law tradition prevails in Australia, 
Britain, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United States, and some nations of Asia and 
Africa.
Civil Law
The origins of the civil law tradition can be traced to Rome in the fifth century b.c. It is the 
world’s oldest and most common legal tradition. A civil law system is based on a detailed set of 
written rules and statutes that constitute a legal code. Civil law can be less adversarial than com-
mon law because there tends to be less need to interpret what a particular law states. Because 
all laws are codified and concise, parties to contracts tend to be more concerned only with the 
explicit wording of the code. All obligations, responsibilities, and privileges follow directly 
from the relevant code. Less time and money are typically spent, therefore, on legal matters. But 
civil law systems can ignore the unique circumstances of particular cases. Civil law is practiced 
in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Quebec, all of Central and South America, most of Western Europe, and 
many nations in Asia and Africa.

Chapter 3 • politiCal eConomy and ethiCs  117
Theocratic Law
A legal tradition based on religious teachings is called theocratic law. Three prominent theo-
cratic legal systems are Islamic, Hindu, and Jewish law. Although Hindu law was restricted by 
India’s 1950 constitution, in which the state appropriated most legal functions, it does persist as 
a cultural and spiritual force. Likewise, although Jewish law remains a strong religious force, it 
has served few legal functions since the eighteenth century, when most Jewish communities lost 
their judicial autonomy.
Islamic law is the most widely practiced theocratic legal system today. Islamic law was 
initially a code governing moral and ethical behavior and was later extended to commercial 
transactions. It restricts the types of investments companies can make and sets guidelines for 
business transactions. According to Islamic law, for example, banks cannot charge interest on 
loans or pay interest on deposits. Instead, banks receive a portion of the profits earned by inves-
tors who borrow funds and pay depositors from these earnings. Likewise, because the products 
of alcohol- and tobacco-related businesses violate Islamic beliefs, firms abiding by Islamic law 
cannot invest in such companies.

Global Legal Issues
Earlier in this chapter, we saw how international companies work to overcome obstacles that an 
unfamiliar political system presents. Firms must adapt to dissimilar legal systems in global mar-
kets because there is no clearly defined body of international law that all nations accept. There 
is a movement toward standardizing the interpretation and application of laws in more than 
one country, but this does not involve standardizing entire legal systems. Enduring differences 
in  legal systems, therefore, can force companies to continue the costly practice of hiring legal 
 experts in each country where they operate.
Still, international treaties and agreements exist in intellectual property rights, antitrust reg-
ulation, taxation, contract arbitration, and general matters of trade. International organizations 
that promote standardization include the United Nations (UN; www.un.org), the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD; www.oecd.org), and the International 
Institute for the Unification of Private Law (www.unidroit.org). The European Union is stan-
dardizing parts of its members’ legal systems to facilitate commerce in Western Europe. Let’s 
now examine the key legal issues facing companies that are active in international business.
intellectual property
Property that results from people’s intellectual talent and abilities is called intellectual property. 
It includes graphic designs, novels, computer software, machine-tool designs, and secret formu-
las, such as that for making Coca-Cola.
Most national legal systems protect property rights—the legal rights to resources and any 
income they generate. Similar to other types of property, intellectual property can be traded, 
sold, and licensed in return for fees and/or royalty payments. Intellectual property laws are 
designed to compensate people whose property rights are violated.
Intellectual property laws differ greatly from nation to nation. Business Software Alliance 
(BSA; www.bsa.org), the trade body for business software makers, conducts an annual study of 
software piracy rates around the globe. Where illegal copies of business software recently made 
up 20 percent of the U.S. domestic market (the lowest in the world), pirated software made up 
93 percent of the market in Georgia (the highest worldwide). Globally, business software piracy 
averages around 42 percent and costs business software makers nearly $59 billion annually.8

As these figures suggest, the laws (or the enforcement of such laws) of some countries are 
softer on piracy than the laws of some other nations. Although peddlers of pirated CDs and 
DVDs operate openly from sidewalk kiosks in China, China’s government did more to tackle 
piracy recently.9 Software companies in the United States and the European Union continually 
lobby their governments to pressure other nations to adopt stronger laws.
Technically, intellectual property results in industrial property (in the form of either a 
 patent or a trademark) or copyright and confers a limited monopoly on its holder.
inDusTriAL prOperTy Industrial property includes patents and trademarks, which are 
often a firm’s most valuable assets. Laws protecting industrial property are designed to reward 
inventive and creative activity. Industrial property is protected internationally under the 
Paris  Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (www.wipo.int), to which nearly 
100 countries are signatories.
A patent is a right granted to the inventor of a product or process that excludes others from 
making, using, or selling the invention. Current U.S. patent law went into effect on June 8, 1995, 
and is in line with the systems of most developed nations. Its provisions are those of the World 
Trade Organization (WTO), the international organization that regulates trade between nations. 
The WTO (www.wto.org) typically grants patents for a period of 20 years. The 20-year term 
begins when a patent application is filed with a country’s patent office, not when it is finally 
granted. Patents can be sought for any invention that is new, useful, and not obvious to any 
individual of ordinary skill in the relevant technical field. Patents motivate companies to pursue 
inventions and make them available to consumers because they protect investments that compa-
nies make in research and development.
Trademarks are words or symbols that distinguish a product and its manufacturer. The 
Nike (www.nike.com) “swoosh” is a trademark, as is the name “Lexus” (www.lexus.com). 
Trademark law creates incentives for manufacturers to invest in developing new products. It also 
benefits consumers because they know what to expect when they buy a particular brand. In other 
words, you would not expect a canned drink labeled “Monster” to taste like one labeled “Sprite.”
Trademark protection typically lasts indefinitely, provided the word or symbol continues to 
be distinctive. Ironically, this stipulation presents a problem for companies such as Coca-Cola 
(www.coca-cola.com) and Xerox (www.xerox.com), whose trademarks “Coke” and “Xerox” 
have evolved into generic terms for all products in their respective categories. Trademark laws 
differ from country to country, though some progress toward standardization is occurring. 
The European Union, for example, opened a trademark-protection office to police trademark 
infringement against firms that operate in any European Union country.

Designers who own trademarks, such as Chanel (www.chanel.com), Christian Dior (www.
dior.com), and Gucci (www.gucci.com), have long been plagued by shoddily made counterfeit 
handbags, shoes, shirts, and other products. But recently, pirated products of equal or nearly 
equal quality are turning up, especially in Italy. Most Italian owners of luxury, brand-name 
leather goods and jewelry, for example, outsource production to small manufacturers. It is not 
hard for these same artisans to counterfeit extra copies of a high-quality product. Bootleg copies 
of a Prada (www.prada.com) backpack that costs $500 in New York can be bought for less than 
$100 in Rome. Jewelry shops in Milan can buy fake watches labeled Bulgari (www.bulgari.com) 
and Rolex (www.rolex.com) for $300 and sell them retail for $2,500.
COpyrighTs Copyrights give creators of original works the freedom to publish or dispose of 
them as they choose. A copyright is typically denoted by the well-known symbol ©, a date, and 
the copyright holder’s name. A copyright holder has the legal rights to:
• Reproduce the copyrighted work.
• Derive new works from the copyrighted work.
• Sell or distribute copies of the copyrighted work.
• Perform the copyrighted work.
• Display the copyrighted work publicly.
Copyright holders include artists, photographers, painters, literary authors, publish-
ers, musical composers, and software developers. Works created after January 1, 1978, are 
automatically copyrighted for the creator’s lifetime plus 50 years. Publishing houses receive 
copyrights for either 75 years from the date of publication or 100 years after creation, which-
ever comes first. Copyrights are protected under the Berne Convention (www.wipo.int), 
which is an international copyright treaty to which the United States is a member, and the 
1954 Universal Copyright Convention. More than 50 countries abide by one or both of these 
treaties.
A copyright is granted for the tangible expression of an idea, not for the idea itself. For 
example, no one can copyright the idea for a movie about the sinking of the Titanic. But once a 
film is made that expresses its creator’s treatment of the subject, that film can be copyrighted.
Perhaps the most well-known song around the world, “Happy Birthday to You,” is actually 
protected by U.S. copyright law. The song was composed in 1859 and copyrighted in 1935. 
Although the copyright was set to expire in 2010 on the song’s 75th copyright birthday, the U.S. 
Congress extended it until 2030. Time Warner owns the copyright and stands to gain as much as 
$20 million from the extension.
product safety and Liability
Product safety laws in most countries set standards that manufactured products must meet. 
Product liability holds manufacturers, sellers, individuals, and others responsible for damage, 
injury, or death caused by defective products. Injured parties can sue for monetary compensation 
through civil lawsuits and for fines or imprisonment through criminal lawsuits.
Developed nations have the toughest product liability laws, whereas developing and emerg-
ing countries have the weakest laws. Business insurance costs and legal expenses are greater in 
nations with strong product liability laws, where damage awards can be large. Likewise, enforce-
ment of product liability laws differs from nation to nation. In the most developed nations, for 
example, tobacco companies are regularly under attack for the negative health effects of tobacco 
and nicotine. Critics say that the tobacco industry markets aggressively to women and children 
in developing countries where regulations are weak and many people do not know that smoking 
is dangerous.10
Taxation
National governments use income and sales taxes for many purposes. They use tax revenue to 
pay government salaries, build military capabilities, and shift earnings from people with high in-
comes to the poor. Nations may also tax imports in order to make them more expensive and give 
locally made products an advantage among price-sensitive consumers.
Nations pass indirect taxes, called “consumption taxes,” which help pay for the conse-
quences of using particular products. Consumption taxes on products such as alcohol and

tobacco help pay the health-care costs of treating illnesses that result from using these products. 
Similarly, gasoline taxes help pay for the road and bridge repairs needed to counteract the effects 
of traffic and weathering.
Many countries impose a value added tax (VAT)—a tax levied on each party that adds 
value to a product throughout its production and distribution. The United States has not previ-
ously implemented a VAT tax, but the nation’s considerable debt level is causing speculation 
that it may impose one. Supporters of the VAT system contend that it distributes taxes on retail 
sales more evenly between producers and consumers. Suppose, for example, that a shrimper 
sells the day’s catch of shrimp for $1 per pound and that the country’s VAT is 10 percent (see 
Table 3.1). The shrimper, processor, wholesaler, and retailer pay taxes of $0.10, $0.07, $0.11, 
and $0.10, respectively, for the value that each adds to the product as it makes its way to 
consumers. Consumers pay no additional tax at the point of sale because the government has 
already  collected taxes from each party in the value chain. Still, consumers end up paying the tax 
because producers and distributors must increase prices to compensate for their tax burdens. So 
that the poor are not overly burdened, many countries exclude the VAT on certain items such as 
children’s clothing.
Antitrust regulations
Antitrust laws try to provide consumers with a wide variety of products at fair prices. The United 
States and the European Union are the world’s strictest antitrust regulators. In Japan, the Fair 
Trade Commission enforces antitrust laws but is often ineffective because absolute proof of 
wrongdoing is needed to bring charges.
Companies based in strict antitrust countries often argue that they are at a disadvantage 
against competitors whose home countries condone market sharing, whereby competitors 
agree to serve only designated segments of a certain market. That is why firms in strict antitrust 
countries often lobby for exemptions in certain international transactions. Small businesses also 
argue that they could better compete against large international companies if they could join 
forces without fear of violating antitrust laws.
In the absence of a global antitrust enforcement agency, international companies 
must concern themselves with the antitrust laws of each nation where they do business. 
In fact, a nation (or group of nations) can block a merger or acquisition between two non-
domestic  companies if those companies do a good deal of business there. This happened 
to the proposed $43 billion merger between General Electric (GE; www.ge.com) and 
Honeywell (www.honeywell.com). GE wanted to marry its manufacture of airplane engines 
to Honeywell’s production of advanced electronics for the aviation industry. Although both 
companies are based in the United States, together they employed 100,000 Europeans. GE 
alone earned $25 billion in Europe the year before the proposed merger. The European Union 
blocked the merger because it believed the result would be higher prices for customers, par-
ticularly airlines.

Ethics and Social Responsibility
We learned in Chapter 2 that when a company goes global its managers encounter many un-
familiar cultural rules that govern human behavior. Although legal systems set clearly defined 
boundaries for lawful individual and corporate behavior, they are inadequate for dilemmas of 
ethics and social responsibility. Ethical issues and social responsibility are related to, but are 
not the same as, legal issues. When laws are silent on a particular matter, international business-
people step into a gray area of personal ethics and business responsibility.
Ethical behavior is personal behavior in accordance with guidelines for good conduct or 
morality. Ethical dilemmas are not legal questions. When a law exists to guide a manager toward 
a legally correct action, that path must be followed. In an ethical dilemma, there is no right 
or wrong decision. There are alternatives, however, that may be equally valid in ethical terms 
depending on one’s perspective.
In addition to the need for individual managers to behave ethically, businesses are expected 
to exercise corporate social responsibility—the practice of going beyond legal obligations 
to actively balance commitments to investors, customers, other companies, and communities. 
Corporate social responsibility (or CSR, as it is known) includes a wide variety of activities, 
including giving to the poor, building schools in developing countries, and protecting the global 
environment. Most conscientious business leaders realize that the futures of their companies 
rest on healthy workforces and environments worldwide. For example, soft drink makers sup-
port all sorts of environmental initiatives because they understand that their futures depend 
on an ample supply of clean drinking water. But firms should not produce public relations 
campaigns that present a business as socially responsible if it does not truly embrace CSR 
principles.
We can think of CSR as consisting of three layers of activity. The first layer is traditional 
philanthropy, whereby a corporation donates money and, perhaps, employee time toward a spe-
cific social cause. The second layer is related to risk management, whereby a company develops 
a code of conduct that it will follow in its global operations and agrees to operate with greater 
transparency. The third layer is strategic CSR, in which a business builds social responsibility 
into its core operations to create value and build competitive advantage.11
philosophies of ethics and social responsibility
There are four commonly cited philosophies of business ethics and social responsibility. The 
Friedman view—named for its main supporter, the late economist Milton Friedman—says 
that a company’s sole responsibility is to maximize profits for its owners (or shareholders) 
while operating within the law.12 Imagine a company that moves its pollution-generating 
 operations from a country having strict and expensive environmental-protection laws to 
a country having no such laws. Managers subscribing to the Friedman philosophy would 
 applaud this decision. They would argue that the company is doing its duty to increase profits 
for its owners and is operating within the law in the foreign country. Many people disagree 
with this argument and say the discussion is not whether a company has CSR obligations but 
how it will fulfill them.
The cultural relativist view says that a company should adopt local ethics wherever it oper-
ates because all belief systems are determined within a cultural context. Cultural relativism sees 
truth, itself, as relative and argues that right and wrong are determined within a specific situa-
tion. The expression “When in Rome, do as the Romans do” captures the essence of cultural 
relativism. Consider a company that opens a factory in a developing market and, following local 
customs, employs child laborers. The cultural relativist manager would argue that this company 
is acting appropriately and in accordance with local standards of conduct. Many people strongly 
oppose this line of ethical reasoning.
The righteous moralist view says that a company should maintain its home-country ethics 
wherever it operates because the home-country’s view of ethics and responsibility is supe-
rior to others’ views. Imagine a company that expands from its developed-country base to 
an emerging market where local managers commonly bribe officials. Suppose headquarters 
detests the act of bribery and instructs its subsidiary managers to refrain from bribing any 
local officials. In this situation, headquarters is imposing its righteous moralist view on local 
managers.

122  
part 2 • national Business environments
The utilitarian view says that a company should behave in a way that maximizes “good” 
outcomes and minimizes “bad” outcomes wherever it operates. The utilitarian manager asks 
the question, “What outcome should I aim for?” and answers, “That which produces the best 
outcome for all affected parties.” In other words, utilitarian thinkers say the right behavior is 
that which produces the greatest good for the greatest number. Consider, again, the righteous 
moralist company above that instructs its employees not to bribe local officials in the  emerging 
market. Now suppose a manager learns that, by bribing a local official, the company will finally 
obtain permission to expand its factory and create 100 well-paying jobs for the local community. 
If the manager pays the bribe based on his or her calculations that more people will benefit than 
will be harmed by the outcome, he or she is practicing  utilitarian ethics.
Although businesses can create policies regarding ethics and social responsibility, issues 
arise on a daily basis that can cause dilemmas for international managers. Let’s now learn more 
about several of these key issues.
Bribery and Corruption
Similar to other cultural and political elements, the prevalence of corruption varies from nation 
to nation. In certain countries, bribes are routinely paid to distributors and retailers in order to 
push a firm’s products through distribution channels. Bribes can mean the difference between 
obtaining an important contract and being completely shut out of a market. But corruption 
is detrimental to society and business. Among other things, corruption can send resources 
 toward inefficient uses, hurt economic development, distort public policy, and damage national 
integrity.
Map 3.2 on pages 124–125 shows how countries rate on their perceived levels of corrup-
tion. The higher a country’s score on the corruption perceptions index (CPI), the less corrupt it is 
perceived to be by international managers. What stands out immediately on this map is that the 
poorer and least developed nations tend to be perceived as being most corrupt (such as Russia, 
much of Africa, and areas in the Middle East). This reflects the hesitancy on the part of interna-
tional companies about investing in corrupt economies.
Enron Corporation made history when it acknowledged in a federal filing that it had over-
stated its earnings. Investors fled in droves as Enron stock became worthless and the company 
went bankrupt. Although executives had earned millions over the years in salaries and bonuses, 
Enron’s rank-and-file employees saw their retirement savings disappear as the firm disintegrated. 
European banks lost around $2 billion that they had lent to Enron and its subsidiaries. Chairman 
of the board Kenneth Lay (now deceased) and CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted on criminal 
charges. Then a criminal indictment was filed against accounting firm Arthur Andersen, Enron’s 
auditor, for shredding documents related to its work for Enron. With its reputation irreparably 
damaged, Andersen also collapsed.
The financial losses and diminished confidence in business that resulted from Enron’s 
collapse prompted the U.S. Congress to pass the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (Sarbox) on corporate 
governance. The law established new, stringent accounting standards and reporting practices 
for firms. Around the world, governments, accounting standards boards, other regulators, and 
interest groups won the fight for higher standards and more transparent financial reporting by 
companies. Businesses worldwide received the message that fudging the accounting numbers, 
misrepresenting the firm’s financial health, and running a company in that gray area between 
right and wrong is unethical and, now, illegal.
Some people believe Sarbox needs to be reformed because of the financial burden that com-
panies face in conforming to the act’s requirements. Regulators, securities experts, and scholars 
(who largely praise Sarbox) are pitted against chief financial officers—many of whom say that 
the act should be reformed or repealed because its costs outweigh its benefits. But legislators 
have not backed down. Directors on the boards of companies have had to become far-more-
active participants in company operations—to the point where it has become a real job now, 
says one expert on corporate governance.13
Labor Conditions and human rights
To fulfill their responsibilities to society, companies are monitoring the actions of their own 
employees and the employees of companies with whom they conduct business. Pressure from 
human rights activists drove conscientious apparel companies to introduce codes of conduct 

 
Chapter 3 • politiCal eConomy and ethiCs  123
and monitoring mechanisms for their international suppliers. Levi-Strauss (www.levistrauss.
com) pioneered the use of practical codes to control working conditions at contractors’ facilities. 
The company does business only with partners who meet its “Terms of Engagement,” which 
sets minimal guidelines regarding ethical behavior, environmental and legal requirements, 
 employment standards, and community involvement.14
Consider one case publicized by human rights and labor groups investigating charges 
of worker abuse at the factory of one of Nike’s Vietnamese suppliers. Twelve of 56 female 
 employees reportedly fainted when a supervisor forced them to run around the factory as 
punishment for not wearing regulation shoes. Nike confirmed the report and, in suspending 
the supervisor, took steps to implement practices more in keeping with the company’s home-
country ethics.
International law says that only nations can be held liable for human rights abuses. But 
activist groups can file a lawsuit against a U.S. business for an alleged human rights viola-
tion under the Alien Tort Claims Act by alleging a company’s complicity in the abuse. Yahoo 
(www.yahoo.com) felt the power of this law when two Chinese dissidents were jailed after the 
company gave data it had on them to Chinese authorities. Yahoo reached an out-of-court settle-
ment with the families of the jailed men. And despite denials of any responsibility in the matter, 
U.S. oil company Unocal, now part of Chevron (www.chevron.com), settled out of court over 
 allegations of complicity in government soldiers’ abuse of villagers during construction of an oil 
pipeline in Myanmar in the 1990s.15

fair Trade practices
Starbucks (www.starbucks.com) works hard to operate in a socially responsible manner by 
trying to ease the plight of citizens in poor coffee-producing countries. Starbucks does this by 
building schools, health clinics, and coffee-processing facilities to improve the well-being of 
families in coffee-farming communities. The company also sells what it calls “fair trade coffee.” 
Fair trade products are those that involve companies working with suppliers in more equitable, 
meaningful, and sustainable ways. For Starbucks, this means ensuring that coffee farmers earn a 
fair price for their coffee crop and helping them farm in environmentally friendly ways.16
Fair Trade USA (www.fairtradeusa.org) is the nonprofit organization that independently 
certifies fair trade products such as Starbucks coffee. The Fair Trade model of international trade 
benefits more than one million farmers and farm laborers in 58 developing countries across 
Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Fair Trade products now include coffee, tea, herbs, cocoa, 
chocolate, fruit, rice, sugar, flowers, honey, and spices. Fair Trade USA certifies that a product 
meets the following criteria:17
• Fair Prices Producer groups receive a guaranteed minimum floor price.
• Fair Labor Conditions Farms do not employ children, and workers are given freedom of 
association, safe working conditions, and a living wage.
• Direct Trade Whenever possible, importers purchase from producer groups to eliminate

Concern for the environment and ecosystem is no longer left to government agencies and non-
governmental organizations. Today companies pursue “green” initiatives to reduce their toll on 
the environment and to reduce operating costs and boost profit margins. Carbon footprint is the

environmental impact of greenhouse gases (measured in units of carbon dioxide) that result from 
human activity. It consists of two components:18
• Primary Footprint Direct carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil  fuels, 
including domestic energy consumption and transportation (such as electricity and 
gasoline).
• Secondary Footprint Indirect carbon dioxide emissions from the whole life cycle of 
products (from their manufacture to eventual breakdown).
Companies at the leading edge of the green movement are printing a number on their 
products that represents the grams of carbon dioxide emitted from producing and ship-
ping them to retailers. The number signifies the environmental impact of all the materials, 
chemicals, and so on, used in producing and distributing a good. For example, the United 
Kingdom’s number-one selling snack food brand, Walker (www.walkers-crisps.co.uk), 
stamps “75g” on its packets of cheese- and onion-flavored potato chips, or crisps—meaning 
75 grams of carbon dioxide were emitted in producing and shipping each packet. Footwear 
and clothing maker Timberland (www.timberland.com) is implementing a different system. 
It labels its products with a score ranging from 0 to 10. A score of “0” means producing 
and shipping a product emitted less than 2.5 kilograms of carbon dioxide; a product with a 
score of “10” emitted 100 kilograms of carbon dioxide—roughly equivalent to driving a car 
240 miles.19
Another trendsetter in reducing its carbon footprint is Marriott International (www.marriott.
com). The hotel company’s employee cafeteria replaced paper and plastic containers with real 
plates and biodegradable potato-based containers called Spudware. Marriott gives employees 
reusable plastic water bottles and lets them exchange burnt-out regular bulbs, from work or 
home, for energy-saving compact fluorescent bulbs. And the company has “green ambassadors” 
who remind employees to print documents double-sided and to turn off lights and electronic 
devices not in use.20
Boisset Family Estates (www.boisset.com), France’s third-largest winery, initiated an 
eco-smart alternative to the glass bottle. Boisset uses aluminum-coated paperboard similar to 
containers commonly used for juices and milk. Besides protecting the product from oxidation 
and making it easier to chill, the new packaging helps the environment and improves company 
profits. It used to take 28 trucks to haul enough empty glass bottles to the winery to package 
the same volume of wine that today takes just one truck of empty cartons. After the cartons are 
a man plugs in a tesla car 
at the opening of the first

electric cars in oosterhout, the

filled, one truck now hauls away what used to take three trucks. The savings in materials, fuel, 
and equipment are significant.21
On a national level, the German government has gone greener than most others. 
Germany’s energy law guarantees operators of windmills and solar generators prices that are 
above the market rate for as long as 20 years. That law, combined with German  expertise in 
aerodynamics, is making the country a global leader in renewable energy. Today, 60 com-
panies in Germany specialize in wind systems. The former East Germany is nicknamed 
Solar Valley because of the large number of companies that manufacture solar cells there. 
Germany’s green-energy sector employs more than 235,000 people and generates $33 billion 
in sales annually.22

D
ifferences in political economy among nations present both 
opportunities and risks for international companies. Gaining 
complete control over events in even the most stable national 
business environment is extremely difficult because of the intricate 
connections among politics, economics, law, and culture. Still, 
understanding these connections is the first step in managing the 
risks of doing business in unfamiliar environments.
implications for Business in Totalitarian nations
Political opposition to business from nongovernmental organi-
zations is extremely unlikely if a totalitarian nation sanctions a 
particular commercial activity. Bribery and kickbacks to govern-
ment officials will likely prevail, and refusal to pay is generally not 
an option. As such, business activities in totalitarian nations are 
 inherently risky. Business law in totalitarian nations is either vague 
or nonexistent, and interpretation of the law is highly subjective. 
Finally, certain groups criticize companies for doing business in or 
with totalitarian nations, saying they are helping sustain oppressive 
political regimes.
implications for Business in Democracies
Democracies tend to provide stable business environments 
through laws that protect individual property rights. Commerce 
should prosper when the private sector comprises indepen-
dently owned firms that exist to make profits. Although par-
ticipative democracy, property rights, and free markets tend to 
encourage economic growth, they do not always do so. India is 
the world’s largest democracy, yet its economy grew very slowly 
for decades. Meanwhile, some countries achieved rapid eco-
nomic growth under political systems that were not genuinely 
democratic.
Which Type of government is Best for Business?
Although democracies pass laws to protect individual civil lib-
erties and property rights, totalitarian governments could also 
grant such rights. The difference is that, whereas democra-
cies strive to guarantee such rights, totalitarian governments 
retain the power to repeal them whenever they choose. As 
for a  nation’s rate of economic growth, we can say only that a 
 democracy does not guarantee high rates of economic growth 
and that totalitarianism does not doom a nation to slow eco-
nomic growth. An economy’s growth rate is influenced by many 
additional factors.
implications of Legal issues for Companies
A nation’s political economy is naturally intertwined with its legal 
system. Its political economy inspires and endorses its legal sys-
tem, which legitimizes and supports the political economy. Flexible 
business strategies help companies operate within the political 
economy frameworks of nations. Managers will benefit if they have 
a solid grasp of how such frameworks affect company operations 
and strategy.
implications of ethical issues for Companies
Probably every international company of at least moderate size has 
a policy for corporate social responsibility (CSR). Traditionally, com-
panies practiced CSR through old-fashioned philanthropy. Indeed, 
donating money and time toward solving social problems helped 
society and bolstered a company’s public image. Companies later 
developed codes of conduct for their global operations to ensure 
they were good citizens wherever they operated. Today, compa-
nies search for ways to use CSR to create value and build competi-
tive advantage.
Bottom Line for Business

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Describe the key features of each form of political system.
• In a totalitarian system individuals govern without the support of the people, tightly 
control people’s lives, and do not tolerate opposing viewpoints.
• Theocratic totalitarianism means that order is kept with laws based on religious and 
totalitarian beliefs. In secular totalitarianism political leaders rely on military and 
bureaucratic power for control.
• In a democratic system leaders are elected by the people or by their represen-
tatives. Representative democracies strive to provide freedom of expression, 
periodic elections, civil and property rights, minority rights, and nonpolitical 
bureaucracies.
 LO2. Explain how the three types of economic systems differ.
• In a centrally planned economy, the government owns land, factories, and other 
economic resources and plans nearly all economic activities. Economic and 
 social equality are paramount and the needs of the group are above those of the 
individual.
• In a mixed economy, land, factories, and other economic resources are split between 
private and government ownership. Efficiency is strived for but society is protected 
from unchecked greed.
• In a market economy, private individuals or businesses own the majority of land, 
factories, and other economic resources. The entire group is thought to benefit when 
individuals receive incentives and rewards. Government is subdued and prices are set 
by supply and demand.
 LO3. Summarize the main elements of each type of legal system.
• A legal system is a country’s set of laws and regulations, including the  processes by 
which its laws are enacted and enforced and how its courts hold parties accountable.
• Common law is a legal system based on a country’s legal history (tradition), past 
cases tried in the courts (precedent), and how laws are applied in specific situations 
(usage).
• Civil law is a system based on a detailed set of written rules and statutes that consti-
tute a legal code, from which flows all obligations, responsibilities, and privileges.
• Theocratic law is a system based on religious teachings.
 LO4. Outline the global legal issues facing international firms.
• Firms must work hard to protect their property rights (legal rights to resources and 
income generated) and intellectual property (that which results from intellectual 
 talent and abilities) against violations of patents, trademarks, and copyrights.
• Companies must know product liability laws (responsibility for damage, injury, 
or death caused by defective products) and taxation requirements wherever they 
operate.
• Businesses need to know how antitrust laws (designed to stop companies from  fixing 
prices, sharing markets, and gaining unfair monopoly advantages) influence operations.
 LO5. Describe the main issues of global ethics and social responsibility.
• Managers often encounter different views toward bribery and corruption in a host coun-
try, and must abide by stringent accounting standards and reporting practices.
• Firms can guarantee good working conditions and protect human rights by monitor-
ing the actions of their own employees and those of companies with whom they do 
business.
• Companies active in developing countries can foster social responsibility in those 
markets by encouraging fair-trade practices.
• Businesses can pursue “green” initiatives that reduce operating costs and boost prof-
its while protecting the environment.

 Talk About It 1
The Internet and the greater access to information it provides are disrupting traditional ways 
of doing things in almost every sphere of life. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, government seems to 
be among the slowest economic sectors to undergo change.
 3-1. How might the Internet change, if at all, totalitarian governments such as North Korea?
 3-2. Can you think of ways that technology might change the way democracies function? 
Explain.
 Talk About It 2
Under a totalitarian government, the Indonesian economy grew strongly for 30 years. 
Meanwhile, the economy of the largest functioning democracy, India, performed poorly for 
decades until recently.
 3-3. Do you think the Indonesian economy grew despite or because of a totalitarian regime?
 3-4. What might explain India’s relatively poor performance under a democratic political 
system?
Ethical Challenge You are the CEO of a pharmaceutical company. Drug trials suggest that one of your new 
products has a direct link with premature deaths. As a consequence, it will prove impossible 
to launch the product in key Western markets in the short-to-medium term. The failure would 
have a marked impact on share price and stakeholder confidence, and adverse publicity will 
cause a major fall in profits. It has been suggested at a private meeting of shareholders that 
you rebrand the drug and actively seek new markets in developing and emerging countries. 
Less legislation might mean fewer controls.
 3-5. Is this an ethical way forward for the business and the brand?
 3-6. Why might developing and emerging countries be the ideal places to market the drug 
safely for the business?
 3-7. Where could the business make cost savings if they were to divert the stocks of 
drugs to developing and emerging markets rather than try to sell in developed 
markets?

Teaming Up
In groups of three or four consider the ethical implications of doing business in a country 
where bribery and corruption is not only endemic, but also a part of the accepted norms. If it 
is impossible to do business without paying bribes, should the business consider not operat-
ing there at all? Draw up a list of key points and then share your ideas with the rest of the 
class.

Chapter 3 • politiCal eConomy and ethiCs  131
Pirates of Globalization
I
t pays to remember that old Latin phrase, caveat emptor (“let 
the buyer beware”), when tackling the production of counter-
feit products on a global scale. Sophisticated pirates routinely 
violate patents, trademarks, and copyrights to churn out high-
quality fakes of the best-known brands. Trademark counterfeiting 
amounts to between 5 and 7 percent of world trade, or around 
$500 billion a year. Phony products appear in many industries, 
including computer software, films, books, music CDs, and phar-
maceutical drugs. Fake computer chips, broadband routers, and 
computers cost the electronics industry alone up to $100 billion 
annually.
Traditionally peddled by sidewalk vendors and in back-street 
markets, counterfeiters now employ the latest technology. Just 
as honest businesses do, they are using the Internet to slash the 
cost of distributing their fake goods. All merchandise on some 
Internet sites is counterfeit, and even legitimate website opera-
tors, such as eBay (www.ebay.com), have difficulty rooting out 
pirates.
New York retailer Tiffany & Company (www.tiffany.com) 
sued eBay when counterfeits of its products appeared on eBay’s 
website. In the complaint, Tiffany said that, of the 186 jewelry 
pieces bearing the Tiffany name that it randomly purchased on 
eBay, 73 percent were phony. Tiffany argued that eBay should 
bear responsibility for the sale of counterfeit merchandise on its 
site because it profits significantly from the sale of fake merchan-
dise, provides a forum for such sales, and promotes it. Others 
disagree, saying it is impractical to require online auctioneers to 
verify the authenticity of every product sold on its site.
Pirates have not ignored the market for automotive parts, 
which loses around $12 billion annually to phony goods. Car 
manufacturers list harmful fakes such as brake linings made 
of compressed sawdust and transmission fluid that is nothing 
more than cheap oil with added dye. Boxes bearing legitimate-
looking labels make it difficult for consumers to tell the differ-
ence between a fake and the real deal. The problem is causing 
fears of lawsuits because of malfunctioning counterfeits and 
concerns of lost revenue for producers of the genuine articles. 
For example, if someone is in an accident because of a counter-
feit product, legitimate manufacturers need to prove the product 
is not their own.
Lax antipiracy regulations and booming economies in emerg-
ing markets mean potential intellectual-property traps await 
companies doing business there. For example, Indian law gives 
 international pharmaceutical firms five- to seven-year patents on 
processes used to manufacture drugs—but not on the drugs them-
selves. This lets Indian companies modify the patented production 
processes of international pharmaceutical companies to create 
drugs that are only slightly different.
In China, political protection for pirates of intellectual prop-
erty remains fairly common. Government officials, people work-
ing for the government, and even the People’s Liberation Army 
(China’s national army) operate factories that churn out pirated 
goods. An international company has difficulty fighting piracy in 
China because filing a lawsuit can severely damage its business 
relations there.
Yet, opinion is divided on the root causes of intellectual prop-
erty violations in China. Some argue that Chinese legislation is 
vaguely worded and difficult to enforce. Others say China’s intel-
lectual property laws and regulations are fine, but poor  enforcement 
is to blame for high rates of piracy. Amazingly, China’s regulatory 
body sometimes allows a counterfeiter to  remove an infringing 
trademark and still sell the substandard good. Technology compa-
nies said to have been harmed by China’s weak intellectual prop-
erty laws include Microsoft (www.microsoft.com), which claims 
that its software is widely pirated, and Cisco Systems (www.cisco.
com), which sued a Chinese hardware maker for allegedly copying 
and using Cisco networking software.
Thinking globally
 3-16. What more do you think the international business commu-
nity could do to protect their intellectual property rights?
 3-17. Are international companies simply afraid to speak out 
against counterfeiting in potentially lucrative emerging 
markets for fear of being denied access to them?
 3-18. By using the latest technologies, people can often create 
perfect clones of original works. How are the Internet and 
the latest digital technologies influencing intellectual prop-
erty laws?
 3-19. Locate information on the Tiffany versus eBay lawsuit and 
identify each side’s arguments and who prevailed. What are 
the implications of that lawsuit for the sale of counterfeits 
in online auctions?

Chapter 4 • eConomiC Development of nations  133
India’s Tech King
BANGALORE, India—Infosys (www.infosys.com) was founded in 1981 with an 
initial capital outlay of only $250. Today, the company is one of India’s top providers of 
information technology services, with more than 160,000 employees and $8.25 billion 
in revenue. Infosys and other Indian firms provide high-quality software and consulting 
services to global companies.
Just as China drove down prices 
worldwide in manufacturing, India is 
doing the same in services. But China 
and India are following two distinct 
paths to development. Whereas China 
developed its economy by throwing 
open its doors to investment, India’s 
commitment to free markets was am-
biguous and made international com-
panies wary. So India underwent or-
ganic growth and spawned homegrown 
firms in knowledge-based industries, 
such as Infosys.
Despite its reputation for high 
taxes and burdensome regulations, 
India long had some of the most basic 
foundations of a market economy—in-
cluding private enterprise, democratic 
government, and Western accounting practices. Its capital markets are also more effi-
cient and transparent than China’s, and its legal system is more advanced. The fact that 
China is following a top-down approach to development while India pursues a bottom-
up approach reflects their opposing political systems: India is a democracy, and China 
is not.
India appears to be the first developing nation to advance economically by relying 
on the brainpower of its people instead of a manufacturing base. China, by contrast, is 
relying on its natural resources and inexpensive factory labor to develop its economy by 
manufacturing all sorts of products. The best growth strategy—the organic-led path of 
India versus the investment-led path of China—depends on a nation’s circumstances. 
As you read this chapter, consider the importance of economic development and how 
companies can help to improve a nation’s standard of living.1

In Chapter 2, we saw that one defining element of a culture is its tendency toward individualism 
or collectivism. In Chapter 3, we saw how this tendency and a society’s history influence the 
formation of its political economy. In this chapter, we investigate the linkages between political 
economy and economic development—an increase in the economic well-being, quality of life, 
and general welfare of a nation’s people. Similar to how systems of political economy differ 
from country to country, so too do levels of economic development.
National culture can have a strong impact on a nation’s economic development. In turn, the 
development of a country’s economy can dramatically influence many aspects of its culture. 
Economic systems in individualist cultures tend to provide incentives and rewards for individual 
business initiative. Collectivist cultures tend to offer fewer such incentives and rewards. For 
example, in individualist cultures, entrepreneurs—businesspeople who accept the risks and op-
portunities involved in creating and operating new business ventures—tend to be rewarded with 
relatively low tax rates that encourage their activities.
We begin this chapter by introducing categories in which we place countries depending on 
their level of economic development. We then examine several indicators of national economic 
development. Next, we look at how countries in transition are implementing market-based 
reforms to encourage economic development and learn about the obstacles they face. We then 
cover the nature of political risk because of its potential impact on economic development and 
see how firms manage this type of risk. We conclude this chapter with a look at how two emerg-
ing markets are faring in their economic development efforts.
Economic Development
Economic development includes economic improvements in people’s lives as well as progress 
on physical health, safety, life expectancy, education and literacy, poverty, critical infrastructure, 
environmental sustainability, and so forth. As such, the concept incorporates both quantitative 
and qualitative features.
Yet, economic development requires economic growth, which is a quantifiable increase 
in the goods and services that a society produces. Economic growth, in turn, depends on gains 
in productivity, which is simply the ratio of outputs (what is created) to inputs (resources used 
to create output). We can speak about the productivity of a business, an industry, or an entire 
economy. For a business to boost its productivity it must increase the value of its outputs using 
the same amount of inputs, create the same value of outputs with fewer inputs, or do both at the 
same time. Businesses increase their productivity through entrepreneurial activities and innova-
tion, in all their forms.
Classifying Countries
Differences in political economy among nations can cause great differences in economic de-
velopment. Development is an increasingly important topic as international companies pursue 
business opportunities in emerging markets. Although much of the population in these coun-
tries is poor, there is often a thriving middle class and ambitious programs toward economic 
development.
Nations are commonly classified as being developed, newly industrialized, or developing based 
on a quantifiable economic measure. Such measures include figures on national production, the por-
tion of the economy devoted to agriculture, the amount of exports in the form of industrial goods, 
and overall economic structure. There is no single, agreed-on list of countries in each category, 
 however, and borderline countries are often classified differently in different listings.
DeveLOpeD COunTries Countries that are highly industrialized and highly efficient, and 
whose people enjoy a high quality of life, are developed countries. People in developed 
countries usually receive the finest health care and benefit from the best educational systems 
in the world. Most developed nations also support aid programs for helping poorer nations to 
improve their economies and standards of living. Countries in this category include Australia, 
Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States, and all western European nations.

newly industrialized countries (NICs). The NICs are located primarily in Asia and Latin 
America. Most listings of NICs include Asia’s “four tigers” (Hong Kong, South Korea, 
Singapore, and Taiwan), Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa, and Thailand. 
Depending on the pivotal criteria used for classification, a number of other countries could 
be placed in this category, including Argentina, Brunei, Chile, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Indonesia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Turkey, and Vietnam.
When we combine newly industrialized countries with countries that have the potential to 
become newly industrialized, we arrive at a category often called emerging markets. Generally, 
emerging markets have developed some (but not all) of the operations and export capabilities 
associated with NICs. Debate continues, however, over the defining characteristics of such clas-
sifications as newly industrialized country and emerging market.
DeveLOping COunTries Nations with the poorest infrastructures and lowest personal 
incomes are called developing countries (also called less-developed countries). These countries 
often rely heavily on one or a few sectors of production, such as agriculture, mineral mining, 
or oil drilling. They might show potential for becoming newly industrialized countries, but 
typically lack the necessary resources and skills to do so. Most lists of developing countries 
include many nations in Africa, the Middle East, and the poorest formerly communist nations in 
Eastern Europe and Asia.
Developing countries (and NICs as well) are sometimes characterized by a high degree of 
technological dualism—use of the latest technologies in some sectors of the economy coupled 
with the use of outdated technologies in others. By contrast, developed countries typically incor-
porate the latest technological advancements in all manufacturing sectors.
When exploring potential markets, managers can use a variety of measures to estimate a 
country’s level of economic development. But it is wise to examine a combination of measures 
because each one has advantages and disadvantages. Let’s now look at the main gauges of eco-
nomic development.
national production
Recall from Chapter 1 that gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of all goods and ser-
vices produced by a domestic economy over a one-year period. GDP is a narrower figure 
than gross national product (GNP) in that it excludes a nation’s income generated from 
exports, imports, and the international operations of its companies. A country’s GDP per 
capita is simply its GDP divided by its population to measure a nation’s income per person. 
Map 4.1 on pages 136–137 shows how the World Bank (www.worldbank.org) classifies 
countries according to gross national income (GNI) per capita—a measure that is similar to 
GNP per capita.
Marketers often use GDP or GNP per capita figures to determine whether a country’s 
population is wealthy enough to begin purchasing its products. For example, the Asian 
nation of Myanmar, with a GDP per capita of about $1,500 per year, is very poor. You 
won’t find many computer companies marketing laptops or designer-apparel firms selling 
expensive clothing there. Yet several large makers of personal-care products are staking out 
territory in Myanmar. Companies like Colgate-Palmolive (www.colgate.com) and Unilever 
(www.unilever.com) are traditional explorers of uncertain but promising markets in which 
they can offer relatively inexpensive, everyday items such as soap and shampoo. As mul-
tinational companies enter such markets, they often try to satisfy the needs of people who 
live at the bottom of the pyramid—the world’s poorest populations with the least purchas-
ing power.
Although GDP and GNP are the most popular indicators of economic development, they 
have several important drawbacks.
unCOunTeD TrAnsACTiOns For a variety of reasons, many of a nation’s transactions do not 
get counted in either GDP or GNP. Some activities not included are:
• Volunteer work
• Unpaid household work
• Illegal activities such as gambling and black market (underground) transactions
• Unreported transactions conducted in cash

part 2 • national Business environments
In some cases, the unreported (shadow) economy is so large and prosperous that official sta-
tistics such as GDP per capita are almost meaningless. Government statistics can mask a thriving 
shadow economy driven by differences between official and black-market currency exchange 
rates. In many wealthy nations, the shadow economy is from one-tenth to one-fifth as large as 
the official economy. But in more than 50 countries, the shadow economy is at least 40 percent 
the size of the documented GDP. In the Eurasian country of Georgia, for example, unreported 
transactions are estimated to equal as much as 73 percent of reported transactions. So, whereas 
Georgia’s official GDP is around $15 billion, its shadow economy could be worth nearly $11 
billion.
One way in which goods and services flow through shadow economies is through barter—
the exchange of goods and services for other goods and services instead of money. In one clas-
sic incident, Pepsi-Cola (www.pepsi.com) traded soft drinks in the former Soviet Union for 17 
submarines, a cruiser, a frigate, and a destroyer. Pepsi then converted its payment into cash by 
selling the military goods as scrap metal.2 Russians still use barter extensively because of a lack 
of currency. In another classic, and bizarre, case, the Russian government paid 8,000 teachers in 
the Altai republic (1,850 miles east of Moscow) their monthly salaries with 15 bottles of vodka 
each. Teachers had previously refused an offer to receive part of their salaries in toilet paper and 
funeral accessories.3
QuesTiOn OF grOwTh Gross product figures do not tell us whether a nation’s economy is 
growing or shrinking—they are simply a snapshot of one year’s economic output. Managers 
will want to supplement this data with information on expected future economic performance. A 
nation with moderate GDP or GNP figures attracts more investment if its expected growth rate 
is high.
prOBLem OF AverAges Recall that per capita numbers give an average figure for an entire 
country. These numbers are helpful in estimating national quality of life, but averages do not give 
us a very detailed picture of development. Urban areas in most countries are more developed 
and have higher per capita income than rural areas. In less advanced nations, regions near 
good harbors or other transportation facilities are usually more developed than interior regions. 
Likewise, an industrial park that boasts companies with advanced technology in production or 
design can generate a disproportionate share of a country’s earnings.
For example, GDP or GNP per capita figures for China are misleading because Shanghai 
and coastal regions of China are far more developed than the country’s interior. Although luxury 
cars are sold in many of China’s coastal cities and regions, bicycles and simple vehicles are still 
the transportation of choice in China’s interior.
piTFALLs OF COmpArisOn Country comparisons using gross product figures can be 
misleading. When comparing gross product per capita, the currency of each nation being 
compared must be translated into another currency unit (usually the dollar) at official exchange 
rates. But official exchange rates only tell us how many units of one currency it takes to buy one 
unit of another. They do not tell us what that currency can buy in its home country. Therefore, to 
understand the true value of a currency in its home country, we apply the concept of purchasing 
power parity.
purchasing power parity
Using gross product figures to compare production across countries does not account for the 
different cost of living in each country. Purchasing power is the value of goods and services 
that can be purchased with one unit of a country’s currency. Purchasing power parity (PPP) is 
the relative ability of two countries’ currencies to buy the same “basket” of goods in those two 
countries. This basket of goods is representative of ordinary, daily-use items such as apples, rice, 
soap, toothpaste, and so forth. Estimates of gross product per capita at PPP allow us to see what 
a currency can actually buy in real terms.
Let’s see what happens when we compare the wealth of several countries to that of the 
United States by adjusting GDP per capita to reflect PPP. If we convert Swiss francs to dollars 
at official exchange rates, we estimate Switzerland’s GDP per capita at $47,900. This is higher 
than the official GDP per capita of the United States ($39,700). But adjusting Switzerland’s 
GDP per capita for PPP gives us a revised figure of $34,700, which is lower than the U.S. GDP

figure of $39,700. Why the difference? GDP per capita at PPP is lower in Switzerland because 
of that nation’s higher cost of living. It simply costs more to buy the same basket of goods in 
Switzerland than it does in the United States. The opposite phenomenon occurs in the case of the 
Czech Republic. Because the cost of living there is lower than in the United States, the Czech 
Republic’s GDP per capita rises from $10,600 to $18,600 when PPP is considered.4 We discuss 
PPP in greater detail in Chapter 10.
human Development
So far we see that adjusting figures on national production for purchasing power provide nu-
merical measures for comparing nations. But we also see that they do not capture development’s 
qualitative aspects. Also, the PPP concept does a fairly good job of revealing different levels of 
economic development, but is a poor indicator of a people’s total well-being. Table 4.1 shows 
how selected countries rank according to the United Nations’ human development index 
(HDI)—the measure of the extent to which a government equitably provides its people with a 
long and healthy life, an education, and a decent standard of living.
Table 4.1 also illustrates the disparity that can be present between a nation’s wealth and 
the HDI. For example, we see that the United States ranks 9th in terms of gross national 
income (GNI) per capita but ranks 3rd in providing health care, education, and a decent stan-
dard of living. A conspicuous example in the table is the entry for South Africa; the country 
ranks 79th in terms of GNI per capita but ranks 121st in terms of HDI. Perhaps most strik-
ing is the column showing each nation’s life expectancy at birth. We see that the people of 
first-ranked Norway have a life expectancy that is nearly 31 years longer than the people of 
last-ranked Mozambique.

Unlike other measures we have discussed, the HDI looks beyond financial wealth. By 
stressing the human aspects of economic development, it demonstrates that high national income 
alone does not guarantee human progress. However, the importance of national income should 
not be underestimated. Countries need money to build good schools, provide quality health care, 
support environmentally friendly industries, and underwrite other programs designed to improve 
the quality of life.

 3. The human development index measures what aspects of a nation’s development?
Economic Transition
Over the past two decades, countries with centrally planned economies have been remaking 
themselves in the image of stronger market economies. This process, called economic transi-
tion, involves changing a nation’s fundamental economic organization and creating entirely new 
free-market institutions. Some nations take transition further than others do, but the process typi-
cally involves several key reform measures to promote economic development:
• Stabilizing the economy, reducing budget deficits, and expanding credit availability
• Allowing prices to reflect supply and demand
• Legalizing private business, selling state-owned companies, and supporting property rights
• Reducing barriers to trade and investment and allowing currency convertibility
Transition from central planning to free-market economies generates tremendous interna-
tional business opportunities. Yet, difficulties arising from years of socialist economic principles 
hamper development efforts from the start, and some countries still endure high unemployment 
rates. Governments of former centrally planned economies in Eastern Europe continue to sell 
state-owned companies in order to boost productivity and competitiveness and to raise living 
standards. Let’s examine the key obstacles for countries in transition.
managerial expertise
In central planning, there was little need for production, distribution, and marketing strategies 
or for trained individuals to devise them. Central planners decided all aspects of the nation’s 
commercial activities. There was no need to investigate consumer wants and no need for mar-
ket research. Little thought was given to product pricing or to the need for experts in opera-
tions, inventory, distribution, or logistics. Factory managers at government-owned firms had 
only to meet production requirements set by central planners. In fact, some products rolled off 
assembly lines merely to be stacked outside the factory because knowing where they were to 
go after  production—and who took them there—was not the factory manager’s job.
Recent years, however, are seeing higher-quality management in transition countries. 
Reasons for this trend include improved education, opportunities to study and work abroad, and 
changes in work habits caused by foreign companies investing locally. Some managers from 
former communist nations are even finding managerial opportunities in Western Europe and the 
United States with large multinational corporations.
shortage of Capital
Not surprisingly, economic transition and development are expensive undertakings. To facilitate 
the process and ease the pain, governments usually spend a great deal of money to:
• Develop a telecommunications and infrastructure system, including highways, bridges, rail 
networks, and sometimes subways.
• Create financial institutions, including stock markets and a banking system.
• Educate people in the ways of market economics.

organization and creates new

Chapter 4 • eConomiC Development of nations  141
The governments of many countries in transition cannot afford all the investments required 
of them. Outside sources of capital are available, however, including national and international 
companies, other governments, and international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Asian Development Bank. Some transition 
countries owe substantial amounts of money to international lenders, but this is becoming less of 
a problem today than it was earlier in the era of transition economies.5
Cultural Differences
Economic transition and development reforms make deep cultural impressions on a nation’s 
people. As we saw in Chapter 2, some cultures are more open to change than others. Likewise, 
certain cultures welcome economic change more easily than others do. Transition replaces de-
pendence on the government with greater emphasis on individual responsibility, incentives, and 
rights. But sudden deep cuts in welfare payments, unemployment benefits, and guaranteed gov-
ernment jobs can present a major shock to a nation’s people.
Importing modern management practices into the culture of a transition country can be 
difficult. South Korea’s Daewoo Motors (www.daewoo.com) faced a culture clash when it 
entered Central Europe. Korea’s management system is based on a rigid hierarchical struc-
ture and an intense work ethic. Managers at Daewoo’s car plants in South Korea arrived 
early for work to stand and greet workers at the company gates. But problems arose when 
Daewoo’s managers did not fully comprehend the culture at its factories in Central Europe. 
Daewoo bridged the cultural and workplace gaps by sending central European workers to 
staff assembly lines in Korea and sent Korean managers and technicians to work in Central 
and Eastern Europe.
sustainability
The economic and social policies of former communist governments in Central and Eastern 
Europe were disastrous for the natural environment. The direct effects of environmental destruc-
tion were evident in high levels of sickness and disease, including asthma, blood deficiencies, 
and cancer—which lowered productivity in the workplace. Countries in transition often suffer 
periods during which the negative effects of a market economy seem to outweigh its benefits. 
But as transition and development efforts continue, the wider population begins to enjoy the 
benefits of a market economy.
Nations that lived under central planning have had to overcome one of central planning’s 
lasting legacies—lack of a topnotch healthcare system. The spread of communicable diseases 
in the world’s poorest nations is especially worrying. Diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, 
and malaria still infect many people in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. These 
diseases cause human and economic loss, social disintegration, and political instability. The 
health care costs required to combat such diseases can significantly impair efforts toward sus-
tainable development. To read about the costs of three particularly lethal diseases, see the Global 
Sustainability feature, titled “Public Health Goes Global.”

Political Risk
All companies doing business domestically or internationally confront political risk—the 
likelihood that a society will undergo political change that negatively affects local business 
activity. Political risk abroad affects different types of companies in different ways. It can 
threaten the market of an exporter, the production facilities owned by a foreign manufac-
turer, or the ability of a firm to extract a profit from a country in which it was earned. A 
solid grasp of local values, customs, and traditions can help reduce a company’s exposure 
to political risk.

and pregnant women) and is where around 20 percent of 
all children die of malaria before age five. In the worst-
affected African nations, malaria costs about 1.3 percent  
of GDP.
• The Challenge To combat HIV/AIDS, rich nations could 
 donate money to train doctors and nurses in poor nations 
and could invest more in research. To battle tuberculosis, 
more aid money could purchase drugs that cost just $10 
per person for the full six-to-eight-month treatment. To fight 
 malaria, better distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets 
could reach the 98 percent of Africa’s children who do not 
sleep under such nets.

Beyond the human suffering, three communicable diseases put a 
drag on economic development and social sustainability.
• HIV/AIDS This disease has killed nearly as many people 
as the plague that struck fourteenth-century Europe. AIDS 
has already killed at least 22 million worldwide, and at least 
40 million are infected with HIV. In Africa alone, 20 million 
have died and 30 million are infected. The disease has cut 
GDP growth by 2.6 percent in some African countries and 
could decrease South Africa’s average household income by 
8 percent.
• Tuberculosis Each year, tuberculosis (TB) kills 1.7 million peo-
ple and sickens another 8 million. More than 90 percent of TB 
cases occur in low- and lower-middle-income countries across 
Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa. TB is 
on the rise because of economic hardship, broken health sys-
tems, and the emergence of drug-resistant TB. This disease de-
pletes the incomes of the poorest nations by about $12 billion.
• Malaria Each year, malaria kills one million people and 
indirectly causes the deaths of up to three million. Malaria 
is prevalent in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta, central Africa, 
and Brazil’s Amazon Basin. Central and sub-Saharan Africa 
 account for 90 percent of all malaria deaths (mostly children

and order, and the quality of a government’s bureaucracy.
Two broad categories of political risk reflect the range of companies each affects. Macro risk 
threatens the activities of all domestic and international companies in every industry. Examples 
include an ongoing threat of violence against corporate assets in a nation and a rising level of 
government corruption. Micro risk threatens companies only within a particular industry (or more 
narrowly defined group). For example, an international trade war in steel affects the operations of 
steel producers and companies that require steel as an input to their business activities.
The main sources of political risk include:
• Conflict and violence
• Terrorism and kidnapping
• Property seizure
• Policy changes
• Local content requirements
Conflict and violence
Local conflict can discourage international companies from investing in a nation and set back 
economic development significantly. Violent disturbances impair a company’s ability to manu-
facture and distribute products, obtain materials and equipment, and recruit talented personnel. 
Open conflict threatens a company’s physical assets (such as offices and factories) and the lives 
of its employees. Conflict also harms the economic development of nations.
There are at least three main origins of conflict. First, it may arise from people’s resent-
ment toward their own government. When peaceful resolution of disputes between people (or 
factions) and the government fails, violent attempts to change political leadership can ensue. 
ExxonMobil (www.exxonmobil.com) suspended production of liquid natural gas at its facility in 
Indonesia’s Aceh province when separatist rebels targeted the complex with violence.

 
Chapter 4 • eConomiC Development of nations  143
Second, conflict can arise over territorial disputes between countries. For example, a dis-
pute over the Kashmir territory between India and Pakistan resulted in major armed conflict 
between their two peoples several times. And a border dispute between Ecuador and Peru caused 
these South American nations to go to war three times.
Third, disputes among ethnic, racial, and religious groups may erupt in violent conflict. 
Indonesia comprises 13,000 islands, more than 300 ethnic groups, and some 450 languages. 
Years ago, Indonesia’s government relocated people from crowded, central islands to less popu-
lated, remote ones without regard to ethnicity and religion. Violence among them later displaced 
more than one million people.
Terrorism and Kidnapping
Terrorist activities are a means of making political statements. Groups dissatisfied with the cur-
rent political or social situation sometimes resort to terrorist tactics in order to force change 
through fear and destruction. On September 11, 2001, the world witnessed terrorism on a scale 
like never before. Two passenger planes were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade 
Center in New York City, one plane was crashed into the Pentagon in Washington, DC, and one 
plane crashed in a Pennsylvania field. The terrorist group Al-Qaida claimed responsibility for 
those U.S. attacks and for more recent attacks around the world. The terror organization’s stated 
goals are to drive Western influence out of Muslim nations and to implement Islamic law. The 
destructive power of those terrorist acts and the expensive wars that followed in Afghanistan and 
Iraq exacted a heavy economic toll on many nations.
Kidnapping and the taking of hostages for ransom may be used to fund a terrorist group’s 
activities. Executives of large international companies are often prime targets for kidnappers 
because their employers have “deep pockets” to pay large ransoms. Latin American countries 
have some of the world’s highest kidnapping rates, and Mexico City is at or near the top of the 
list of cities with the highest kidnapping rates. Annual security costs for a company with a sales 
office in Bogotá, Colombia, can be $125,000 and up to $1 million for a company with operations 
in rebel-controlled areas. Top executives are forced to spend about a third of their time coordi-
nating their company’s security in Colombia. A medium-sized firm that has 5 to 10 employees 
traveling to Latin America for a week at a time could carry $10 million in kidnap and ransom 
insurance at a cost of around $5,000 a year.6
When high-ranking executives are required to enter countries with high kidnapping rates, 
they should enter unannounced, meet with only a few key people in secure locations, and leave 
just as quickly and quietly. Some companies purchase kidnap, ransom, and extortion insurance, 
but security experts say that training people to avoid trouble in the first place is a far better 
investment.
property seizure
Governments sometimes seize the assets of companies doing business within their borders. 
Asset seizures fall into one of three categories: confiscation, expropriation, or nationalization.
The forced transfer of assets from a company to the government without compensation is 
called confiscation. The former owners typically have no legal basis for requesting compensa-
tion or the return of assets. The 1996 Helms–Burton Law allows U.S. businesses to sue com-
panies from other nations that use their property confiscated by Cuba in its 1959 communist 
revolution. For example, the Cuban government faces nearly 6,000 company claims valued at 
$20 billion. But U.S. presidents repeatedly waive the law so as not to harm its relations with 
other countries.7
The forced transfer of assets from a company to the government with compensation 
is called expropriation. The expropriating government normally determines the amount 
of compensation. There is no framework for legal appeal, and compensation is typically 
far below market value. Today, governments rarely resort to confiscation or expropriation 
because these acts can jeopardize investment in the country. Still, it does happen. Argentina 
expropriated 51 percent of that country’s largest energy firm, named Yacimientos Petroliferos 
Fiscales (YPF). The move isolated Argentina internationally and caused even greater uncer-
tainty for international investors. Buenos Aires Waterworks and Aerolineas Argentinas are 
two other entities in Argentina that saw increasing losses after they were nationalized a sec-
ond time.8

part 2 • national Business environments
Whereas expropriation involves one or several companies in an industry, nationalization 
means government takeover of an entire industry. Nationalization is more common than con-
fiscation and expropriation. Likely candidates for nationalization include industries important 
to a nation’s security and those that generate large revenues. Venezuela’s late President Hugo 
Chavez nationalized that country’s telephone, electricity, and oil industries and threatened to 
nationalize many more. Businesses from other countries reacted to these moves by not investing 
in Venezuela. In general, a government may nationalize an industry to:
• Use subsidies to protect an industry for ideological reasons.
• Save local jobs in an ailing industry to gain political clout.
• Control industry profits so they cannot be transferred to low tax-rate countries.
• Invest in sectors, such as public utilities, that private companies cannot afford.
Confiscation, expropriation, and nationalization can have the short term effect of saving 
jobs, boosting currency reserves, or helping the government or the economy in other ways. 
But the long-term result of this form of political risk is usually slower economic development 
because foreign investors are more reluctant to invest in the country.
policy Changes
Government policy changes are the result of a variety of influences, including the ideals of 
newly empowered political parties, political pressure from special interests, and civil or social 
unrest. One common policy tool restricts ownership to domestic companies or limits ownership 
by nondomestic firms to a minority stake. This type of policy restricted PepsiCo’s (www.pep-
sico.com) ownership of local companies to 49 percent when it first entered India. If a company 
decides to withhold investment from a nation because of such policies, they can be seen as im-
pairing economic development.
Other policy changes can reduce political risk, such as those related to cross-border invest-
ments. Facing a slowdown in the technology sector, Taiwan’s businesses and politicians called 
for a scrapping of the nation’s “go slow, be patient” policy with China. That policy capped invest-
ments in mainland China at $50 million and banned investments in infrastructure and industries 
sensitive for national security reasons. Taiwan’s government created a new policy called “active 
opening, effective management,” which reduced restrictions on cross-border investment. These 
actions improved ties between China and Taiwan and promoted economic development.

Local Content requirements
Laws stipulating that a specified amount of a good or service be supplied by producers in the do-
mestic market are called local content requirements. These requirements can force companies 
to use locally available raw materials, procure parts from local suppliers, or employ a minimum 
number of local workers. They ensure that international companies foster local business activity 
and help ease regional or national unemployment. They also help governments maintain some 
degree of control over international companies without resorting to extreme measures such as 
confiscation and expropriation. These efforts can help the economic development of a nation 
when used skillfully, or slow development if used carelessly.
We must also acknowledge that local content requirements can jeopardize an international 
firm’s long-term survival. First, a company required to hire local personnel might be forced to 
take on an inadequately trained workforce or take on excess workers. Second, a company made 
to obtain raw materials or parts locally can find its production costs rise or its product quality 
decline.

 2. Companies fear open violence and conflict abroad because it can threaten the ability to do

 3. What is the name given to the forced transfer of assets from a company to the government

Managing Political Risk
International companies benefit from monitoring and attempting to predict political changes that 
can negatively affect their activities. When an international business opportunity arises in an en-
vironment plagued by extremely high risk, simply not investing in the location may be the wisest 
course of action. Yet when risk levels are moderate and the local market is attractive, interna-
tional companies can find ways to manage political risk. In this way, private sector investment 
from foreign companies helps advance a nation’s economic development. The three main meth-
ods of managing political risk are adaptation, information gathering, and political influence.
Adaptation
Adaptation means incorporating risk into business strategies, often with the help of local offi-
cials. Companies can incorporate risk in four ways.
First, partnerships help companies leverage expansion plans. They can be informal arrange-
ments or include joint ventures, strategic alliances, and cross-holdings of company stock. Partnering 
helps a company to share the risk of loss, which is especially important in emerging markets. If 
partners own shares (equity) in local operations, they get cuts of the profits; if they loan cash (debt), 
they receive interest. Local partners who can help keep political forces from interrupting operations 
include firms, trade unions, financial institutions, and government agencies.
Second, localization entails modifying operations, the product mix, or some other business 
element—even the company name—to suit local tastes and culture. Consider how MTV (www.
mtv.com) demonstrates its sensitivity to local cultural and political issues by localizing its pro-
gramming to suit regional and national tastes.
Third, development assistance allows an international business to assist the host country 
or region in improving the quality of life for locals. For example, by developing distribution 
and communications networks, both a company and a nation benefit. Royal Dutch/Shell (www.
shell.com), the oil company, is working in Kenya to increase the incomes of poor villagers and 
to triple the average period of food security.9 Canon (www.canon.com), the Japanese copier and 
printer maker, practices kyosei (“spirit of cooperation”) to press local governments into making 
social and political reforms.
Fourth, insurance against political risk can be essential to companies entering risky busi-
ness environments. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (www.opic.gov) insures 
local content

U.S. companies that invest abroad against loss and can provide project financing. Some poli-
cies protect companies when local governments restrict the convertibility of local money into 
home-country currency, whereas others insure against losses created by violent events, including 
war and terrorism. The Foreign Credit Insurance Association (www.fcia.com) also insures U.S. 
exporters against loss due to a variety of causes.
information gathering
International firms attempt to gather information that will help them predict and manage politi-
cal risk. There are two sources that companies use to conduct accurate political risk forecasting. 
Current employees who have worked in a country long enough to gain insight into local culture 
and politics are often good sources of information. Individuals who formerly had decision-mak-
ing authority while on international assignment probably had contact with local politicians and 
other officials. Yet it is important that an employee’s international experience be recent because 
political power in a nation can shift rapidly and dramatically.
Second, agencies specialized in providing political-risk services include banks, political 
consultants, news publications, and risk-assessment services. Many of these agencies publish 
reports detailing national levels and sources of political risk. Small companies that cannot afford 
to pay for these services can consider the many free sources of information available, notably 
from their federal governments. Government intelligence agencies are excellent and inexpensive 
sources to consult.
political influence
Managers must work within the established rules and regulations of each national business environ-
ment. Business law in most nations undergoes frequent change, with new laws being enacted and 
existing ones modified. Influencing local politics means dealing with local lawmakers and politi-
cians directly or through lobbyists. Lobbying is the policy of hiring people to represent a company’s 
views on political matters. Lobbyists meet with a local public official to influence his or her position 
on issues relevant to the company. The ultimate goal of the lobbyists is to get favorable legislation 
enacted and unfavorable legislation rejected. Lobbyists also work to convince local officials that a 
company benefits economic development, sustainability efforts, workforce skills, and so on.
Bribes often represent attempts to gain political influence. Years ago, the president of U.S.–
based Lockheed Corp., now Lockheed Martin (www.lockheedmartin.com), bribed Japanese

officials in order to obtain large sales contracts. Public disclosure of the incident resulted in 
passage of the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids U.S. companies from brib-
ing government officials or political candidates in other nations (except when a person’s life is 
in danger). A bribe constitutes “anything of value”—money, gifts, and so forth—and cannot be 
given to any “foreign government official” empowered to make a “discretionary decision” that 
may be to the payer’s benefit. The law also requires firms to keep accounting records that reflect 
their international activities and assets.

international relations
Our coverage has shown that relations between countries can influence the political economy 
of nations and the pace of economic development. Although governments, not companies, are 
directly responsible for managing international relations, the actions of business can cause rela-
tions to improve or worsen. So, in this sense, managers do have a role to play in helping to man-
age international relations.
Favorable and strong political relationships foster stable business environments. Stability 
then enhances international cooperation in sectors such as the development of international 
communications and distribution infrastructures. Strong legal systems through which disputes 
are resolved quickly and fairly further promote stability and cooperation. Simply put, favorable 
political relations among countries expand business opportunities, lower risk, and promote eco-
nomic development.
To generate stable business environments, some countries have turned to multilateral 
 agreements—treaties concluded among several nations, each of whom agrees to abide by treaty terms 
even if tensions develop. According to the European Union’s founding treaty, goods, services, and 
citizens of member nations are free to move across members’ borders. Every nation must continue to 
abide by such terms even if it has a conflict with another member. For instance, although Britain and 
France may disagree on many issues, neither can treat goods, services, and citizens coming and going 
between their two nations any differently than it treats any other member nation’s goods, services, 
and citizens. See Chapter 8 for a detailed presentation of the European Union.
The united nations
Although individual nations sometimes have the power to influence the course of events in cer-
tain parts of the world, they cannot monitor political activities everywhere at once. The United 
Nations (UN; www.un.org) was formed after the Second World War to provide leadership in 
fostering peace and stability around the world. The UN and its many agencies provide food and 
medical supplies, educational supplies and training, and financial resources to poorer member 
nations. The UN receives its funding from member contributions based primarily on gross na-
tional product (GNP). Practically all nations in the world are UN members—except for several 
small countries and territories that have observer status.
The UN is headed by a secretary general who is elected by all members and who serves for 
a five-year term. The UN system consists of six main bodies:
• All members have an equal vote in the General Assembly, which discusses and recom-
mends action on any matter that falls within the UN Charter. It approves the UN budget 
and the makeup of the other bodies.
• The Security Council consists of 15 members. Five (China, France, the United Kingdom, 
Russia, and the United States) are permanent. Ten others are elected by the General 
Assembly for two-year terms. The council is responsible for ensuring international peace 
and security, and all UN members are supposed to be bound by its decisions.

• The Economic and Social Council, which is responsible for economics, human rights, and 
social matters, administers a host of smaller organizations and specialized agencies.
• The Trusteeship Council consists of the five permanent members of the Security Council 
and administers all trustee territories under UN custody.
• The International Court of Justice consists of 15 judges elected by the General Assembly 
and Security Council. It can hear disputes only between nations, not cases brought against 
individuals or corporations. It has no compulsory jurisdiction, and its decisions can be, and 
have been, disregarded by specific nations.

An important body within the UN Economic and Social Council is the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD; unctad.org). The organization has a broad

pressing development issues including entrepreneurship, poverty, and national debt. Certain 
conferences are designed to develop the business management skills of individuals in develop-
ing nations.

Emerging Markets and Economic Transition
In this section, we learn more about the experiences of two emerging markets that are transform-
ing their political economies. Both China and Russia continue to undergo economic transition 
away from central planning and toward more market-based economies. We first explore the 
history of transition for China and the main issues it confronts today. We then explore Russia’s 
experience with transition and the challenges it faces.
China’s profile
China began its experiment with central planning in 1949, after the communists defeated nation-
alists in a long and bloody civil war. Following the war, China imprisoned or exiled most of its 
capitalists. From 1949 until reforms were initiated in the late 1970s, China had a unique eco-
nomic system. Agricultural production was organized into groups of people who formed produc-
tion “brigades” and production “units.” Communes were larger entities responsible for planning 
agricultural production quotas and industrial production schedules. Rural families owned their 
homes and parcels of land on which to produce particular crops. Production surpluses could be 
consumed by the family or sold at a profit on the open market.
In 1979, China initiated agricultural reforms that strengthened work incentives in this 
sector. Family units could then grow whatever crops they chose and could sell the produce 
at market prices. At about the same time, township and village enterprises (TVEs) began 
to appear. Each TVE relied on the open market for materials, labor, and capital and used 
a nongovernmental distribution system. Each TVE employed managers who were directly 
responsible for profits and losses. The government initially regarded TVEs as illegal and 
unrelated to the officially sanctioned communes. But they were legalized in 1984 and helped 
lay additional groundwork for a market economy. Today, private businesspeople can even 
join China’s Communist Party, and workers can elect local representatives to the official 
trade union.
China has done more for its people economically over the past two decades than perhaps 
any other nation on earth. Today, China’s leaders describe its economic philosophy as “social-
ism with Chinese characteristics,” and glistening skyscrapers dominate the Shanghai and Beijing 
cityscapes. The country’s immense population, rising incomes, and expanding opportunities 
attract huge sums of investment.

 
Chapter 4 • eConomiC Development of nations  151
Chinese patience and Guanxi
If there is one trait that is needed by all private companies in China, it is patience. Despite 
 obvious ideological differences between itself and the private sector, China’s Communist Party 
is trying very hard to appear well suited to running the country. Karl Marx once summed up 
communism as the “abolition of private property,” and the name of China’s Communist Party 
(in Chinese characters) literally means “common property party.” But today, private property is 
an accepted concept and encourages Chinese companies to invest in innovation. For example, 
Chinese Telecommunications firm Huawei (www.huawei.com) is now the world’s fourth-largest 
 applicant for patents.10
An interesting facet of doing business in China is guanxi—the Chinese term for “personal 
relationships.” We can see how this works by exploring the role of guanxi in China’s approach 
to innovation. First, flexible networks fueled by guanxi help companies to reduce costs and 
increase flexibility. Chinese companies spread their production contracts over a large number 
of parts suppliers and can then increase or decrease orders as demand dictates. Second, some 
companies exploit China’s lax enforcement of property rights to quickly copy new, pricey global 
products and make cheaper versions available to Chinese consumers. These companies employ 
bandit or guerilla innovation to continually learn innovative ways to produce goods at lower 
cost, though they are clearly violating the original producer’s property rights.11
A personal touch is a necessary ingredient for foreign companies to achieve success in 
China. Initially, and in line with communist ideology, non-Chinese companies were restricted 
from participating in China’s economy. But today, outsiders enjoy ever-greater opportunities 
to create joint ventures with local partners. To learn more about the need for personal relation-
ships, or guanxi, in China, see this chapter’s Culture Matters feature, titled “Guidelines for Good 
Guanxi.”
China’s Challenges
China’s leadership must deal with increasingly rapid economic and social change. Although 
China’s economy grew through the global recession at rates of between 7 and 9 percent,  political 
and social problems pose threats to China’s future economic performance. The nation’s lead-
ership has poor relations with ethnic minorities and skirmishes between secular and Muslim 
Chinese in western provinces still occur, although less frequently today. Meanwhile, for the 
 Chinese migrant workers exit 
a railway station in China’s 
shandong province. China 
is encouraging 90 million 
rural residents to move to 
cities before 2020. the plan 
is to lure rural people to 
higher-paid jobs in cities and 
boost urbanization of its 1.4 
billion-strong population by 
another 7 percent. the current 
migration wave brings more 
than 43,000 people a day to 
China’s cities. the government 
hopes to increase domestic 
consumption to make up 
for slower growth in China’s 
export markets.

most part, political leaders restrict advanced democratic reforms. Protests sporadically arise 
from time to time whenever ordinary Chinese citizens grow impatient with political progress.
Another potential problem is unemployment, largely the result of the collapse of state-
owned industry, intensified competition, and the entry of international companies into China. 
These forces are placing greater emphasis on efficiency and cutting payrolls in some industries. 
Yet, China’s social safety net is unable to cope with the needs of millions of unemployed people.
The biggest contributor to the unemployed sector seems to be migrant workers. Hundreds of 
thousands of workers have left their farms and now go from city to city searching for better-pay-
ing factory work or construction jobs. Unhappiness with economic progress in the countryside 
and the misery of migrant workers are serious potential sources of social unrest for the Chinese 
government. And although factory workers are striking with greater frequency, they are mostly 
trying to recover ground lost by mandatory pay freezes imposed recently.12
Another key issue is reunification of “greater China.” China regained control of Hong Kong 
in 1997 after 99 years under British rule. For the most part, China has kept its promise of “one 
country, two systems.” Although the economic (and, to a lesser extent, political) freedoms of 
people in Hong Kong would remain largely intact, the rest of China would continue along lines 
drawn by the communist leadership. In addition, China regained control of its southern coastal 
territory of Macao in 1999. Only a one-hour ferry ride from Hong Kong, Macao had been under 
Portuguese administration since it was founded in 1557. Although Macao’s main function used 
to be that of trading post, today it serves mainly as a gambling outpost and is referred to as 
“Asia’s Vegas.”13
Any chance of Taiwan’s eventual reunification with the Chinese mainland depends on how 
China manages Hong Kong and Macao. For now, reunification seems more likely as economic 
ties between China and Taiwan grow steadily. Taiwan scrapped a 50-year ban that capped the 
size of investments in China and eased restrictions on direct financial flows between Taiwan 
businesses and the mainland. Also, the entry of both China and Taiwan into the World Trade 
Organization (www.wto.org) in recent years has encouraged further integration of their two 
economies.
• Importance of Contacts, Not Contracts In China, face-to-
face communication and personal relationships take priority 
over written contracts. Mu Dan Ping of Ernst & Young (www.
ey.com) offers this diagram to show the different priorities:
United States: Reason ➛ Law ➛ Relationship
China: Relationship ➛ Reason ➛ Law
 
Managers from the United States look for rationale or reason 
first, wondering if there is a market with profit potential. If so, 
they want a legal contract before spending time on a busi-
ness relationship. But the Chinese need to establish a trust 
relationship first and then look for common goals as a reason 
for doing business. For them, legal contracts are just a for-
mality, serving to ensure mutual understanding.
• Pleasure before Business Experts advise managers to leave 
the sales pitch on the back burner and to follow the lead of 
their Chinese hosts. If seeking partnerships in China, one 
cannot overlook the importance of personal relationships. 
Companies that send their top performers to wow Chinese 
businesspeople with savvy sales pitches can return empty-
handed—friendship comes before business in China.
• Business Partners Are Family Members, Too The impor-
tance of family means that visiting managers should never 
turn down invitations to partake in a Chinese executive’s 
family life. Lauren Hsu, market analyst for Kohler Company 
(www.kohler.com), was responsible for researching and 
identifying potential joint venture partners in China. She 
once went bowling with the partner’s daughter and then to 
a piano concert with the entire family. Two years of meetings 
and visits to get acquainted eventually resulted in a joint 
venture deal.
• Cultural Sensitivity China is not a single market but many 
 different regional markets with different cultures and even 
different languages. Bob Wilner, of McDonald’s Corporation 
(www.mcdonalds.com), went to China to learn how Chinese 
people are managed. He explained that although McDonald’s 
cooks its hamburgers exactly the same way worldwide, it 
is sensitive to local culture in how it manages, motivates, 
rewards, and disciplines employees. Wilner and other 
McDonald’s managers developed that sensitivity only through 
repeated visits to China.

russia’s profile
Russia’s experience with communism began in 1917. For the next 75 years, factories, distribu-
tion, and all other facets of operations, including the prices of labor, capital, and products, were 
controlled by Russia’s government. While China was experimenting with private farm owner-
ship and a limited market-price system, Russia and other nations in the Soviet Union remained 
staunchly communist under a system of complete government ownership.
In the 1980s, the former Soviet Union entered a new era of freedom of thought, freedom of 
expression, and economic restructuring. For the first time since 1917, people could speak freely 
about their lives under economic socialism, and speak freely they did. People vented their frustra-
tions over a general lack of consumer goods, poor-quality products, and long lines at banks and 
grocery stores.
Transition away from government ownership and central planning was challenging. Except 
for politicians, bureaucrats, and wealthy businesspeople (called “oligarchs” in Russia), ordinary 
people had difficulty maintaining their standard of living and affording many basic items. Some 
Russians are now doing well financially because they were factory managers under the old sys-
tem and retained their jobs in the new system. Others have turned to the black market to amass 
personal wealth. Still others are working hard to build legitimate companies but find themselves 
forced into making “protection” payments to organized crime.
An opaque legal system, rampant corruption, and shifting business laws make Russia a 
place where non-Russian businesspeople must operate cautiously. Yet some ambitious manag-
ers and foreign entrepreneurs are not deterred by such obstacles. For some insights on how to 
do business in today’s Russia, see the Manager’s Briefcase feature, titled “Russian Rules of 
the Game.”
Although business in Russia can be brutal at times, some go-
getting entrepreneurs and brave managers are venturing into this 
rugged land. If you are one of them, or just an interested observer, 
here are a few pointers on doing business in Russia:
• Getting Started A visit to your country’s local chamber of 
commerce in Russia should be high on your list. The best 
organized and managed of these hold regularly scheduled 
luncheons at which you can make contacts with Russians 
and others wanting to do business. They might also offer 
programs on getting acquainted with the business climate 
in Russia. Many businesses get started in Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, or Vladivostok, depending in part on their line of 
business.
• Be Adventurous The kind of person who will succeed in 
Russia thrives on adventure and enjoys a challenge. He or she 
also should not demand predictability in day-to-day activi-
ties—Russia is anything but predictable. Initially, knowledge 
of Russian is helpful, though not essential, but eventual 
proficiency will be necessary. Prior experience working and 
living in Eastern Europe would be a big plus.
• Office Space Doing business in Russia demands a personal 
touch. Locating an office in Russia is crucial if you eventually 
want to receive income from your operations. Your office 
does not need to be a suite off Red Square. Almost any lo-
cal address will do, and a nice flat can double as an office 
at the start. For business services, upscale hotels commonly 
have business centers in them. Eventually, renting an average 
Russian-style office would be more than adequate.
• Making Deals Business in Russia takes time and patience. 
The Russian negotiating style, like the country itself, is tough 
and ever changing. During negotiations, emotional outbursts, 
walkouts, or threats to walk out from your Russian counter-
parts should not be unexpected. Finally, signed contracts in 
Russia are not always followed to the letter, as your Russian 
associate may view new circumstances as a chance to rene-
gotiate terms. All in all, the personalities of individuals in-
volved in business dealings count for much in Russia.

russia’s Challenges
As in so many other transitional economies, Russia must continue to foster managerial talent. 
Years of central planning delayed the development of managerial skills needed in a market-based 
economy. Russian managers could do well to advance their skills in every facet of management 
practice, including financial control, research and development, human resource management, 
and marketing strategy.
Political instability, especially in the form of intensified nationalist sentiment, is another 
potential threat to progress. Strong ethnic and nationalist sentiments in the region can cause 
misunderstandings to spiral out of control quickly. Russia and Georgia had a military confronta-
tion in the summer of 2008 over two of Georgia’s restive republics that wanted to draw closer 
to Russia. Then, in 2014, Russia annexed the Ukraine’s peninsula of Crimea, arguing that the 
ethnically Russian people in Crimea voted to break away from Ukraine and to become part of 
Russia. Many nations swiftly rebuked Russia’s actions and some, including the United States, 
imposed political and economic sanctions.
Russia’s unstable investment climate is another concern among international businesses. 
Tense uneasiness between Russia’s government and its business community stems from the 
government’s attacks on business owners who disagree with official policy and on firms that it 
wants to control. The root of many of Russia’s problems appears to be corrupt law enforcement. 
Officials of the government, such as the Russian Interior Ministry, are accused of raiding the 
offices of companies for documents and computers. Records are then falsified and signatures 
forged to make it appear that another company—one controlled by government officials—has 
massively overpaid taxes and is due a government refund. Meanwhile, the owners and managers 
of the raided businesses often find themselves in prison.14
The Russian government confiscated the giant oil firm, Yukos, and threw its chief, Mikhail 
Khodorkovsky, in jail on charges of fraud, embezzlement, and tax evasion. Observers in Russia 
say that Khodorkovsky’s problems were based in his refusal to bow to Russia’s bureaucrats and 
that he ran Yukos as if it were a private company. He also tried to create a new class of people in 
Russia who would one day push for political reforms by financing boarding schools for orphans, 
computer classes for village schools, and civil-society programs for journalists and politicians. 
His actions clearly made him a threat to the state.15 If Russia truly wishes to become a location 
of choice for international companies, it will need to meddle less in business and begin to safe-
guard property rights.

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Explain economic development and how it is measured.
• Economic development refers to an increase in the economic well-being, quality of 
life, and general welfare of a nation’s people.
• One measure of economic development is national production, including gross 
 national product and gross domestic product.
• Another method is purchasing power parity, the relative ability of two countries’ 
 currencies to buy the same “basket” of goods in those two countries.
• A third method is the human development index, or the extent to which a people’s 
needs are satisfied and addressed equally across the population.
 LO2. Describe economic transition and its main obstacles.
• Economic transition is the process whereby a nation changes its fundamental eco-
nomic organization to create free-market institutions.
• One obstacle is a lack of managerial expertise because central planners made nearly 
all business decisions.
• There is a shortage of capital to pay for communications, infrastructure, financial 
institutions, and education.
• Cultural differences between transition economies and western nations can make it 
difficult to introduce modern management practices.
• And unsustainable practices lowered productivity due to lax environmental standards 
and poor healthcare.
the entire U.S. population. Whether the organic-led path of India 
or the investment-led path of China is best for a particular nation 
depends on that nation’s circumstances.
Every nation on earth has so far followed a path to development 
that relied on its natural resources and/or its relatively cheap labor—
the model China is following. China’s top-down approach to develop-
ment and India’s bottom-up approach reflect their political systems: 
India is a democracy, whereas China is not. Although China is growing 
rapidly, it needs homegrown entrepreneurs and advanced manage-
rial skills to take it to the next level of global competitiveness.
If India can achieve sustained economic growth, it will become 
the first developing nation to advance economically by relying on 
the brainpower of its people. India’s growth came largely from na-
tive competitive firms in cutting-edge, knowledge-based industries. 
Although India has a long reputation for high taxes and  burdensome 
regulations, it also has had the foundations of a market economy, 
such as private enterprise, democratic government, and Western ac-
counting practices. India also has a relatively advanced legal system, 
fairly efficient capital markets, and many talented entrepreneurs.
productivity in the united states versus europe
Productivity growth is a key driver of living standards in any nation. 
Although productivity growth in Europe kept pace with that in the 
United States for decades, it has fallen behind in recent years. But 
why is there a productivity gap at all?
Several explanations have been proposed. First, despite its 
benefits, information technology (IT) spending in Europe lags 
behind that in the United States. Europeans may be discouraged 
from spending on IT for reasons related to European business 
law. Second, stronger labor laws in Europe relative to the United 
States make it more difficult and costly to shed workers. Thus, 
even if European companies invest in IT to increase labor pro-
ductivity, overall productivity gains may be hampered by their 
inability to rid themselves of excess workers. Third, whereas the 
U.S. tech sector is a big driver behind higher U.S. productivity 
growth, the tech sector in Europe is far smaller by comparison. 
Fourth, Europe spends far less overall on research and develop-
ment, even though such spending is a big boost to productivity 
growth.
Strong productivity growth will translate to a higher level of 
economic development. Many European officials are calling for 
a greater shift toward free-market reform to boost productivity. 
European officials understand that robust productivity growth 
is the only way for their citizens to close the gap with their U.S. 
counterparts.

 LO3. Outline the various sources of political risk.
• Political risk is the likelihood that a society will undergo political change that 
negatively affects local business activity. Macro risk threatens all companies alike 
whereas micro risk threatens one industry or group of companies.
• The five main sources of political risk are conflict and violence, terrorism and kid-
napping, property seizure, policy changes, and local content requirements.
• Property seizure can take the form of confiscation (without compensation),  
expropriation (with compensation), or nationalization (takeover of an entire 
industry).
 LO4. Explain how companies can manage political risk.
• Managers can reduce the effects of political risk through adaptation (incorporat-
ing risk into business strategies), information gathering (monitoring local political 
events), and political influence (such as by lobbying local political leaders).
• Firms can also manage political risk to some extent by ensuring that their actions do 
not harm international relations.
• Supporting economic development efforts of international organizations, such as the 
United Nations, can also help mitigate political risk.
 LO5. Describe China’s and Russia’s experiences with economic transition.
• China has had tremendous economic success for over two decades with its economic 
philosophy called, “socialism with Chinese characteristics.” The country’s immense 
population, rising incomes, and expanding opportunities attract huge sums of invest-
ment. Potential threats to China’s pace of development are political and social prob-
lems, high migrant unemployment, and a rocky reunification with Taiwan.
• Russia’s experience with communism began in 1917 until it began its economic 
 restructuring in the 1980s. Transition away from central planning was challenging for 
common Russians and corruption became the norm. Challenges facing Russia are the 
need to foster managerial talent suited to a market-based economy, political instabil-
ity in the form of intense nationalism, and an unstable investment climate.

Ethical Challenge Disease is business and offers a potential profit. HIV/AIDS has now killed more people across 
the globe than the Black Death that hit Europe 700 years ago. With around 22 million deaths 
and 40 million people infected, the disease is hitting African countries especially hard. The 
annual cost of the antiretroviral drugs per person has been estimated at US$10,000. Clearly, 
this puts the treatment well out of the reach of most Africans. 
 4-5. What might a drug company state as a reason for the comparatively high cost of 
 antiretroviral drugs? Is this an acceptable reason for the costs?

Africa and consider which of the countries would represent a reasonable political risk in terms 
of investment. Suggest reasons why you have drawn up your short list. Are there borderline

stable? Compare your suggestions with the rest of the class.

The Role of Social and Political Factors in the Lebanese Economy
L  
ebanon is a nation that tolerates and respects multiple cultures, 
religions, and ethnicities while its economy today tries to fol-
low its past preferences of favoring strong fiscal and monetary 
freedoms as well as developing a labor market that is highly 
flexible. 
Prior to the Lebanese Civil War between 1975 and 1990, the 
country had enjoyed relative calm and prosperity. Tourism, agri-
culture, small- and medium-sized manufacturers, education, and 
banking all promoted a successful economy. Lebanon became 
known as the finance and banking capital of the Arab world and 
the “Paris of the Middle East.” Before the war, Lebanon had a 
competitive and free market environment and a strong laissez-faire 
commercial tradition. There were no restrictions on foreign ex-
change or capital movement. Bank secrecy was strictly enforced, 
and there were practically no restrictions on foreign investment. 
Corporate tax rates and inflation were relatively low. The finan-
cial sector was well developed prior to the civil war and has since 
developed again into a system aligned to fit the demands of the 
region, including a range of private banks and services.
The civil war seriously damaged Lebanon’s economic infra-
structure, cut national output by half, and ruined a wide range 
of businesses in service and manufacturing sectors. It ultimately 
ended Lebanon’s position as a Middle Eastern banking hub. The 
subsequent period of relative peace enabled the central govern-
ment to restore control in Beirut, but how was this achieved? Steps 
were taken to reestablish its taxation system and to regain access 
to key port and government facilities. Furthermore, economic 
recovery had been helped by a financially sound banking system 
and resilient small- and medium-sized enterprises, with family re-
mittances, banking services, manufactured and farm exports, and 
international aid as the main sources of foreign exchange.
Immediately following the end of the civil war, there were 
extensive efforts to revive the economy and rebuild the national 
infrastructure. By early 2006, a considerable degree of stability 
had been achieved throughout most parts of the country, Beirut’s 
reconstruction was almost complete, and an increasing number 
of foreign tourists from all around the world were beginning to 
head toward Lebanon’s resorts. As a result, GDP increased from 
$2.838 billion in 1990 to $22438 billion in 2006 (an increase of 
nearly 700 percent in 16 years), and unemployment dropped to 8.1 
percent in 2004.
But a new shock to the country’s economy occurred in 2006. 
After only a month of fighting with Israel in July 2006, Lebanon 
suffered significant damage to businesses and infrastructure. Many 
countries struggled to get as many of their citizens as possible out 
of the country safely and quickly. The tourism industry faced a 
massive loss. Lebanon was in crisis again. In September 2006, 
Rafiq Hariri International Airport in Beirut reopened, and efforts 
to revive the Lebanese economy were to begin once more. Major 
investors to the reconstruction of Lebanon included the European 
Union and Saudi Arabia as well as many other countries across the 
world. Lebanon’s recent economic history has been a series of tak-
ing one step forward and two steps back, yet there is still promise 
for a bright future if peace can be maintained.
Toward achieving its targets, Lebanon has received external 
support as well. International support in humanitarian programs 
and victims’ assistance programs have been significant. Moreover, 
there are external contributions and involvements in the recon-
struction of Lebanon. A program of relief, rehabilitation, and 
recovery has been in force from 1975 to 2005 and has totaled more 
than $400 million in aid to Lebanon by the United States. For 
relief, recovery, rebuilding, and security in the wake of the 2006 
war, the U.S. government substantially stepped up this program, 
pledging well over $1 billion in additional assistance for the 2006 
and 2007 fiscal years.
From an internal perspective, liberalization of the economy, 
investment, and business activities are confronted by other chal-
lenges. Intrusive bureaucracy and chaotic regulatory regimes slow 
down local businesses and discourage foreign investment. Besides, 
fair adjudication of property rights is not guaranteed because the 
Lebanese courts are subject to significant influence from the 
Lebanese security services, government, or even the police. More 
importantly, in order to create a productive and stable business 
environment, it is essential for Lebanon to work diligently on im-
proving its ability to stamp out fraud—for example, Lebanon has 
recently adopted new laws to combat money laundering.
Thinking globally
 4-16. Why do you think Lebanon is in need of foreign direct 
investment (FDI)? Discuss enablers and barriers to FDI in 
Lebanon.
 4-17. Do some research on Lebanon and its current socioeconomic 
status. Discuss how social and political situations may affect 
the Lebanese economy.
 4-18. How do you think the transition to a normal economy in 
Lebanon, after the war in 2006, would differ from the expe-
riences of European countries after World War II?
 4-19. The Lebanese government prohibited all imports from 
Israel. Discuss the socioeconomic aspects of this decision.

China’s Caribbean Connection
CHINA, Guangzhou—At first glance, China and the Caribbean would appear to have 
few interests in common. China has a population of more than 1.3 billion, has expanded 
its interests at a remarkable rate in recent years, and is recognized as a global power. The 
12 countries that make up the English-speaking Caribbean, including Jamaica, St. Lucia, 
St. Kitts, and the Grenadines, can, at best, only boast a sluggish growth that is highly 
reliant on the tourist industry. Yet in 
September 2009, when China’s top 
legislator, Wu Banggou, chairman of 
the Standing Committee of the National 
People’s Congress (NPC), visited the 
area, it was clear that he was not on 
vacation. Chairman Wu’s entourage 
included 150 Chinese officials and 
business leaders who were there to sign 
a series of significant economic deals.
Trade between China and the 
Caribbean has expanded dramatically 
in recent years, to exceed $2 billion 
in 2008, and is forecasted to continue 
growing at a fast pace. However, as 
China has little demand for the prod-
ucts or services of the Caribbean, trade 
is heavily one sided, with 93 percent of 
the business accounted for by Chinese 
exports to the region. To date, the 
Caribbean has provided China with natural building materials whilst China provides the 
Caribbean with textiles, machinery, and food products. China has also invested heavily 
in local development projects, providing financing for leisure complexes and a major 
road-building program.
Growth in international trade is increasing interdependence between China and the 
rest of the world. China’s international trade is expanding at a rate that is about two 
to three times faster than trade growth for the rest of the world. Around 18 percent of 
Japan’s imports come from China, and about 12 percent of all goods imported by the 
United States are Chinese made. Yet China’s imports are also growing. From the United 
States, China imports everything from steel that feeds its booming construction industry 
to X-ray machines and other devices to improve its people’s health.
As you read this chapter, consider why nations trade and how the ambitions of indi-
vidual firms are driving growth in world trade.1

part 3 • InternatIonal trade and Investment
People around the world are accustomed to purchasing goods and services produced in other coun-
tries. In fact, many consumers get their first taste of another country’s culture through merchandise 
purchased from that country. Chanel No. 5 perfume (www.chanel.com) evokes the romanticism of 
France. The fine artwork on Imari porcelain conveys the Japanese attention to detail and quality. 
And American Eagle jeans (www.ae.com) portray the casual lifestyle of people in the United States.
In this chapter, we explore international trade in goods and services. We begin by examining 
the benefits, volume, and patterns of international trade. We then explore a number of important 
theories that attempt to explain why nations trade with one another.
Benefits, Volume, and Patterns of International 
Trade
The purchase, sale, or exchange of goods and services across national borders is called 
 international trade. This is in contrast to domestic trade, which occurs between different states, 
regions, or cities within a country.
In recent years, nations that embrace globalization are seeing trade grow in importance for 
their economies. One way to measure the importance of trade to a nation is to examine the vol-
ume of an economy’s trade relative to its total output. Map 5.1 (on pages 164–165) shows each 
nation’s trade volume as a share of its gross domestic product (GDP). Trade as a share of GDP 
is defined as the sum of exports and imports (of goods and services) divided by GDP. Recall that 
GDP is the value of all goods and services produced by a domestic economy over a one-year 
period. Map 5.1 demonstrates that the value of trade passing through some nations’ borders actu-
ally exceeds the amount of goods and services they produce (the “over 100%” category).
Benefits of International Trade
International trade provides a country’s people with a greater choice of goods and services. 
For example, because Finland has a cool climate, it cannot be expected to grow cotton. But it 
can sell paper and other products made from lumber (which it has in abundance) to the United 
States. Finland can then use the proceeds from the sale of products derived from lumber to buy 
U.S.–grown Pima cotton. Thus, people in Finland get cotton they otherwise would not have. 
Likewise, although the United States has vast forests, the wood-based products from Finland 
might be of a certain quality that fills a gap in the U.S. marketplace.
International trade is also an important engine for job creation in many countries. The U.S. 
Department of Commerce (www.commerce.gov) calculates that for every $1 billion increase 
in exports, 22,800 jobs are created in the United States. It is also estimated that 12 million U.S. 
jobs depend on exports and that these jobs pay on average from 13 to 18 percent more than those 
not related to international trade.2 Expanded trade benefits other countries similarly.
Volume of International Trade
The value and volume of international trade continues to increase. Today, world merchandise 
exports are valued at more than $14 trillion, and service exports are worth more than $4 trillion.3 
Table 5.1 shows the world’s largest exporters of merchandise and services. Perhaps not surpris-
ingly, the United States ranks first in commercial services exports and ranks second in merchan-
dise exports (behind China).
Most of world merchandise trade is composed of trade in manufactured goods. The domi-
nance of manufactured goods in the trade of merchandise has persisted over time and will likely 
continue to do so. The reason is its growth is much faster than trade in the two other classifica-
tions of merchandise—mining and agricultural products. Trade in services accounts for around 
20 percent of total world trade. Although the importance of trade in services is growing for many 
nations, it tends to be relatively more important for the world’s richest countries.
TrAde And WOrLd OuTPuT The level of world output in any given year influences the 
level of international trade in that year. Slower world economic output slows the volume of 
international trade, and higher output propels greater trade. Trade slows in times of economic 
recession because when people are less certain about their own financial futures they buy 
fewer domestic and imported products. Another reason output and trade move together is that a 
country in recession also often has a currency that is weak relative to other nations. This makes

borders.

imports more expensive relative to domestic products. (We discuss the relationship between 
currency values and trade at length in Chapter 10.) In addition to international trade and world 
output moving in lockstep fashion, trade has consistently grown faster than output.
International Trade Patterns
Exploring the volume of international trade and world output provides useful insights into the 
international trade environment, but it does not tell us who trades with whom. It does not reveal 
whether trade occurs primarily between the world’s richest nations or whether there is signifi-
cant trade activity involving poorer nations.
Customs agencies in most countries record the destination of exports, the source of imports, 
and the physical quantities and values of goods crossing their borders. Customs data reflects 
overall trade patterns among nations, but this type of data is sometimes misleading. For exam-
ple, governments sometimes deliberately distort the reporting of trade in military equipment or 
other sensitive goods. In other cases, extensive trade in unofficial (underground) economies can 
distort the real picture of trade between nations.
Large ocean-going cargo vessels are needed to support these patterns in international trade 
and deliver merchandise from one shore to another. In fact, Greek and Japanese merchant ships 
own more than 30 percent of the world’s total capacity (measured in tons shipped, or tonnage) 
of merchant ships. Yet, global merchant-shipping companies are feeling the pinch of higher oil 
prices. And as importers must absorb a portion of higher shipping costs, they may begin produc-
ing goods closer to home and reduce the need for additional merchant-ship capacity.4
WhO TrAdes WITh WhOm? There has been a persistent pattern of merchandise trade among 
nations. Trade between the world’s high-income economies accounts for roughly 60 percent 
of total world merchandise trade. Two-way trade between high-income countries and low- and 
middle-income nations accounts for about 34 percent of world merchandise trade. Meanwhile, 
merchandise trade between low- and middle-income nations accounts for only about 6 percent 
of total world trade. These figures reveal the low purchasing power of the world’s poorest 
nations and indicate their general lack of economic development.
Table 5.2 (on page 166) shows trade data (in percentages) for the major regions of the world 
economy. What immediately stands out is the number representing intraregional exports for Europe 
(the intersection of the row and column titled “Europe”). This number tells us that nearly 67 percent 
of Europe’s exports are destined for other European nations. Intraregional exports account for more 
than 56 percent of all exports in Asia and almost 38 percent of exports in North America. This data 
underscores the rationale behind the creation of the European Union (which we discuss in Chapter 8).

Data in Table 5.2 also reveals each region’s contribution to total world merchandise 
exports. Europe accounts for almost 36 percent, Asia accounts for nearly 32 percent and North 
America accounts for around 13 percent. Asia’s role in merchandise trade is increasing as the 
region’s economies continue to expand. Some economists call this century the “Pacific cen-
tury,” referring to the expected growth of Asian economies and the resulting shift in the major-
ity of trade flows from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. It will be increasingly important for 
managers to understand the varying and rich cultures in Asia. For some pointers on doing busi-
ness in Pacific Rim nations, see this chapter’s Culture Matters feature, titled “Business Culture 
in the Pacific Rim.”
Trade Interdependence
Trade between most nations is characterized by a degree of interdependency. Companies in de-
veloped nations trade a great deal with companies in other developed nations. The level of inter-
dependency between pairs of countries often reflects the amount of trade that occurs between a

Asian customers are as diverse as their cultures and aggressive 
sales tactics do not work. Before visiting these countries, it is help-
ful for managers to review some general rules:
• Make Use of Contacts Asians prefer to do business with 
people they know. Cold calls and other direct-contact meth-
ods seldom work. Meeting the right people in an Asian com-
pany often depends on having the right introduction. If the 
person with whom you hope to do business respects your 
intermediary, chances are that he or she will respect you.
• Carry Bilingual Business Cards To make a good first impres-
sion, have bilingual cards printed, even though many Asians 
speak English. It shows both respect for the language and a 
commitment to doing business in a country. It also translates 
your title into the local language. Asians generally are not 
comfortable until they know what your position is and whom 
you represent.
• Respect, Harmony, Consensus Asian cultures command 
respect for their achievements in music, art, science, philoso-
phy, business, and more. Asian businesspeople are tough 
negotiators, but they dislike argumentative exchanges. 
Harmony and consensus are the bywords in Asia, so be 
 patient but firm.
• Drop the Legal Language Legal documents are subordinate 
to personal relationships. Asians tend to dislike detailed con-
tracts. Agreements are often left flexible so that adjustments 
can be made easily in order to fit changing circumstances. It’s 
important to foster good relations based on mutual trust and 
benefit. The importance of a contract in many Asian societies 
is not what it stipulates but rather who signed it.
• Build Personal Rapport Social ease and friendship are pre-
requisites to doing business across much of Asia. As much 
business is transacted at informal dinners as it is in corporate 
settings, so accept invitations, and be sure to reciprocate.

company’s subsidiaries in the two nations. Emerging markets that share borders with developed 
countries are often dependent on their wealthier neighbors.
Trade dependency has been a blessing for many Central and Eastern European nations. 
Germany recently had more than 6,000 joint ventures in Hungary alone. And Germany is the 
single most important trading partner of many Central and Eastern European nations that belong 
to the European Union (www.europa.eu). To gain an advantage over competitors, German firms 
combine homegrown technology with relatively low-cost labor in Central and Eastern Europe. 
For example, Opel (www.opel.com), the German division of General Motors Corporation (www.
gm.com), built a $440 million plant in Szentgotthard, Hungary, to make parts for and assemble 
its Astra hatchbacks destined for export markets.
TrAde dePendenCe The dangers of trade dependency become apparent when a nation 
experiences economic recession or political turmoil, which then harms dependent nations. For 
many years, Mexico was a favorite location for the production and assembly operations of U.S. 
companies making all sorts of products, including refrigerators, mobile phones, and textiles. But 
then some companies abandoned Mexico for cheaper production locations in Asia, which left 
empty factories and unemployed workers behind. But today, as labor costs continue to climb 
in China, some U.S. companies are relocating their factories back to Mexico. The best way for 
Mexico to deal with its dependency on the United States is to boost its competitiveness and 
make itself a top choice among emerging markets.

Mercantilism
Trade between different groups of people has occurred for many thousands of years. But it was 
not until the fifteenth century that people began trying to explain why trade occurs and how trade 
can benefit both parties to an exchange. Figure 5.1 shows a timeline of when the main theories 
of international trade were proposed.

part 3 • InternatIonal trade and Investment
The trade theory that nations should accumulate financial wealth, usually in the form of 
gold, by encouraging exports and discouraging imports is called mercantilism. It states that 
other measures of a nation’s well-being, such as living standards or human development, are 
irrelevant. Nation-states in Europe followed this economic philosophy from about 1500 to the 
late 1700s. The most prominent mercantilist nations included Britain, France, the Netherlands, 
Portugal, and Spain.
how mercantilism Worked
When navigation was a fairly new science, Europeans explored the world by sea and claimed the 
lands they encountered in the name of the European monarchy that financed their voyage. Early 
explorers landed in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, where they established colonies. Colonial 
trade was conducted for the benefit of mother countries, and the appeal of the colonies was their 
abundant resources.
In recent times, former colonies have struggled to diminish their reliance on the former 
colonial powers. For example, in an effort to decrease their dependence on their former colonial 
powers, African nations are welcoming trade relationships with partners from Asia and North 
America. But because of geographic proximity, the European Union is still often preferred as a 
trading partner.
Just how did countries implement mercantilism? The practice of mercantilism rested on 
three essential pillars: trade surpluses, government intervention, and colonialism.
TrAde surPLuses Nations believed they could increase their wealth by maintaining a trade 
surplus—the condition that results when the value of a nation’s exports is greater than the value 
of its imports. In mercantilism, a trade surplus means that a country takes in more gold on the 
sale of its exports than it pays out for its imports. A trade deficit is the opposite condition—one 
that results when the value of a country’s imports is greater than the value of its exports. In 
mercantilism, trade deficits are to be avoided at all costs. (We discuss the importance of national 
trade balance at length in Chapter 7.)
GOVernmenT InTerVenTIOn Governments actively intervened in international trade in order 
to maintain a trade surplus. According to mercantilism, the accumulation of wealth depends on 
increasing a nation’s trade surplus, not necessarily expanding its total value or volume of trade. 
The governments of mercantilist nations did this by either banning certain imports or imposing 
various restrictions on them, such as tariffs or quotas. At the same time, the nations subsidized 
industries based in the home country in order to expand exports. Governments also typically 
outlawed the removal of their gold and silver to other nations.
COLOnIALIsm Mercantilist nations acquired territories (colonies) around the world to serve 
as sources of inexpensive raw materials and as markets for higher-priced finished goods. These 
colonies were the source of essential raw materials, including tea, sugar, tobacco, rubber, 
and cotton. These resources would be shipped to the mercantilist nation, where they were 
incorporated into finished goods such as clothing, cigars, and other products. These finished 
goods would then be sold to the colonies. Trade between mercantilist countries and their 
colonies were a huge source of profits for the mercantilist powers. The colonies received low 
prices for basic raw materials but paid high prices for finished goods.
The mercantilist and colonial policies greatly expanded the wealth of nations that imple-
mented them. This wealth allowed nations to build armies and navies to control their far-flung 
colonial empires and to protect their shipping lanes from attack by other nations. It was a source 
of a nation’s economic power that in turn increased its political power relative to other countries. 
Today, countries seen by others as trying to maintain a trade surplus and expand their national 
treasuries at the expense of other nations are accused of practicing neomercantilism or economic 
nationalism.
Flaws of mercantilism
Despite its seemingly positive benefits for any nation implementing it, mercantilism is inher-
ently flawed. Mercantilist nations believed that the world’s wealth was limited and that a nation 
could increase its share of the pie only at the expense of its neighbors—a situation called a zero-
sum game. The main problem with mercantilism is that, if all nations were to barricade their

markets from imports and push their exports onto others, international trade would be severely 
restricted. In fact, trade in all nonessential goods would likely cease altogether.
In addition, paying colonies little for their exports but charging them high prices for their 
imports impaired their economic development. Thus, their appeal as markets for goods was less 
than it would have been if they had been allowed to accumulate greater wealth.

 2. Mercantilist nations acquired colonies around the world to serve as sources of what?
 3. What name is given to the belief that a nation can increase its wealth only at the expense of

Theories of Absolute and Comparative Advantage
The negative aspects of mercantilism were made apparent by a trade theory developed in the late 
1700s called absolute advantage. Several decades later, this theory was built upon and extended 
into what is called comparative advantage. Let’s now examine these two theories in detail.
Absolute Advantage
Scottish economist Adam Smith first put forth the trade theory of absolute advantage in 1776.5 
The ability of a nation to produce a good more efficiently than any other nation is called an 
absolute advantage. In other words, a nation with an absolute advantage can produce a greater 
output of a good or service than other nations using the same amount of, or fewer, resources.
Among other things, Smith reasoned that international trade should not be banned or 
restricted by tariffs and quotas but allowed to flow as dictated by market forces. If people in 
different countries were able to trade as they saw fit, no country would need to produce all the 
goods it consumed. Instead, a country could concentrate on producing the goods in which it

holds an absolute advantage. It could then trade with other nations to obtain the goods it needs 
but does not produce.
Suppose a talented CEO wants to install a hot tub in her home. Should she do the job herself 
or hire a professional installer to do it for her? Suppose the CEO (who has never installed a hot 
tub before) would have to take one month off from work and forgo $80,000 in salary in order to 
complete the job. On the other hand, the professional installer (who is not a talented CEO) can 
complete the job for $5,000 and do it in two weeks. Whereas the CEO has an absolute advantage 
in running a company, the installer has an absolute advantage in installing hot tubs. It takes the 
CEO one month to do the job the installer can do in two weeks. Thus, the CEO should hire the 
professional to install the hot tub to save both time and money resources.
Let’s now apply the absolute advantage concept to an example of two trading countries to 
see how trade can increase production and consumption in both nations.
CAse: rICeLAnd And TeALAnd Suppose that we live in a world of just two countries (Riceland 
and Tealand), with two products (rice and tea), and that transporting goods between these two 
countries costs nothing. Riceland and Tealand currently produce and consume their own rice and 
tea. The following table shows the number of units of resources (labor) each country expends in 
creating rice and tea. In Riceland, just one resource unit is needed to produce a ton of rice, but five 
units of resources are needed to produce a ton of tea. In Tealand, six units of resources are needed 
to produce a ton of rice, whereas three units are needed to produce a ton of tea.

Another way of stating each nation’s efficiency in the production of rice and tea is:
• In Riceland, 1 unit of resources = 1 ton of rice or 1/5 ton of tea
• In Tealand, 1 unit of resources = 1/6 ton of rice or 1/3 ton of tea
These numbers also tell us one other thing about rice and tea production in these two 
countries. Because one unit of resources produces one ton of rice in Riceland compared with 
Tealand’s output of only 1/6 ton of rice, Riceland has an absolute advantage in rice production—
it is the more efficient rice producer. However, because one resource unit produces 1/3 ton of tea 
in Tealand compared with Riceland’s output of just 1/5 ton, Tealand has an absolute advantage 
in tea production.
Gains from specialization and Trade Suppose now that Riceland specializes in rice production 
to maximize the output of rice in our two-country world. Likewise, Tealand specializes in tea 
production to maximize the world output of tea. Although each country now specializes and 
world output increases, both countries face a problem. Riceland can consume only its rice 
production, and Tealand can consume only its tea production. The problem can be solved if the 
two countries trade with each other to obtain the good that it needs but does not produce.
Suppose that Riceland and Tealand agree to trade rice and tea on a one-to-one basis—a ton 
of rice costs a ton of tea, and vice versa. Thus, Riceland can produce one extra ton of rice with 
an additional resource unit and can trade with Tealand to get one ton of tea. This is much better 
than the 1/5 ton of tea that Riceland would have gotten by investing that additional resource unit 
in making tea for itself. Thus, Riceland definitely benefits from the trade. Likewise, Tealand can 
produce 1/3 extra ton of tea with an additional resource unit and trade with Riceland to get 1/3 
ton of rice. This is twice as much as the 1/6 ton of rice it could have produced using that addi-
tional resource unit to make its own rice. Thus, Tealand also benefits from the trade. The gains 
resulting from this simple trade are shown in Figure 5.2.
Although Tealand does not gain as much as Riceland does from the trade, it does get more rice 
than it would without trade. The gains from trade for actual countries would depend on the total 
number of resources each country has at its disposal and the demand for each good in each country.

 
Chapter 5 • InternatIonal trade theory  171
As this example shows, the theory of absolute advantage destroys the mercantilist idea that 
international trade is a zero-sum game. Instead, because there are gains to be had by both coun-
tries party to an exchange, international trade is a positive-sum game. The theory also calls into 
question the objective of national governments to acquire wealth through restrictive trade poli-
cies. It argues that nations should instead open their doors to trade so that their people can obtain 
a greater quantity of goods more cheaply. The theory does not measure a nation’s wealth by how 
much gold and silver it has on reserve but by the living standards of its people.
Despite the power of the theory of absolute advantage in showing the gains from trade, there 
is one potential problem. What happens if a country does not hold an absolute advantage in the 
production of any product? Are there still benefits to trade, and will trade even occur? To answer 
these questions, let’s take a look at an extension of absolute advantage: the theory of compara-
tive advantage.
Comparative Advantage
An English economist named David Ricardo developed the theory of comparative advantage in 
1817.6 He proposed that if one country (in our example of a two-country world) held absolute 
advantages in the production of both products, specialization and trade could still benefit both 
countries. A country has a comparative advantage when it is unable to produce a good more 
efficiently than other nations but produces the good more efficiently than it does any other good. 
In other words, trade is still beneficial even if one country is less efficient in the production of 
two goods, as long as it is less inefficient in the production of one of the goods.
Let’s return to our hot tub example. Now suppose that the talented CEO has previously 
installed many hot tubs and can do the job in one week—twice as fast as the hot tub installer. 
Thus, the CEO now holds absolute advantages in both running a company and hot tub installa-
tion. Although the professional installer is at an absolute disadvantage in both hot tub installa-
tion and running a company, he is less inefficient in hot tub installation. Despite her absolute 
advantage in both areas, however, the CEO would still have to give up $20,000 (one week’s pay) 
to take time off from running the company to complete the work. Is this a wise decision? No. 
The CEO should hire the professional installer to do the work for $5,000. The installer earns 
money he would not earn if the CEO did the job herself. And the CEO earns more money by 
focusing on running the company than she would save by installing the hot tub herself. 
Gains from specialization and Trade To see how the theory of comparative advantage works 
with international trade, let’s return to our example of Riceland and Tealand. In our earlier 
discussion, Riceland had an absolute advantage in rice production, and Tealand had an absolute 
comparative advantage
Inability of a nation to produce a 
good more efficiently than other 
nations but an ability to produce 
that good more efficiently than it 
does any other good.

advantage in tea production. Suppose that Riceland now holds absolute advantages in the 
production of both rice and tea. The following table shows the number of units of resources each 
country now expends in creating rice and tea. Riceland still needs to expend just one resource 
unit to produce a ton of rice, but now it needs to invest only two units of resources (instead of 
five) to produce one ton of tea. Tealand still needs six units of resources to produce a ton of rice 
and three units to produce a ton of tea.

Another way of stating each nation’s efficiency in the production of rice and tea is:
• In Riceland, 1 unit of resources = 1 ton of rice or 1/2 ton of tea
• In Tealand, 1 unit of resources = 1/6 ton of rice or 1/3 ton of tea
Thus, for every unit of resource used, Riceland can produce more rice and tea than Tealand 
can. Riceland has absolute advantages in the production of both goods. But Riceland can still 
gain from trading with a less-efficient producer. Although Tealand has absolute disadvantages 
in both rice and tea production, it has a comparative advantage in tea. In other words, although 
Tealand is unable to produce either rice or tea more efficiently than Riceland, it produces tea 
more efficiently than it produces rice.
Assume once again that Riceland and Tealand decide to trade rice and tea on a one-to-one 
basis. Tealand could use one unit of resources to produce 1/6 ton of rice. But it would do better to 
produce 1/3 ton of tea with this unit of resources and trade with Riceland to get 1/3 ton of rice. By 
specializing and trading, Tealand gets twice as much rice as it could get if it were to produce the rice 
itself. There are also gains from trade for Riceland despite its dual absolute advantages. Riceland 
could invest one unit of resources in the production of 1/2 ton of tea. It would do better, however, to 
produce one ton of rice with the one unit of resources and trade that rice to Tealand in exchange for 
one ton of tea. Thus, Riceland gets twice as much tea through trade than if it were to produce the tea 
itself. This is in spite of the fact that it is a more efficient producer of tea than Tealand.
The benefits for each country from this simple trade are shown in Figure 5.3. Again, the 
benefits actual countries obtain from trade depend on the amount of resources at their disposal 
and each market’s desired level of consumption of each product.
AssumPTIOns And LImITATIOns Throughout the discussion of absolute and comparative 
advantage, we made several important assumptions that limit real-world application of the 
theories. First, we assumed that countries are driven only by the maximization of production and 
consumption. This is often not the case. Governments often get involved in international trade 
out of a concern for workers or consumers. (We discuss the role of government in international 
trade in Chapter 6.)
Second, the theories assume that there are only two countries engaged in the production and 
consumption of just two goods. This is obviously not the situation that exists in the real world. 
There currently are more than 180 countries and a countless number of products being produced, 
traded, and consumed worldwide.
Third, it is assumed that there are no costs for transporting traded goods from one country to 
another. In reality, transportation costs are a major expense of international trade for some prod-
ucts. If transportation costs for a good are higher than the savings generated through specializa-
tion, trade will not occur.
Fourth, the theories consider labor to be the only resource used in the production process 
because labor accounted for a large portion of the total production cost of goods at the time the 
theories were developed. Moreover, it is assumed that resources are mobile within each nation 
but cannot be transferred between nations. But labor and natural resources can be transferred 
between nations, although doing so can be difficult and costly.

 
Chapter 5 • InternatIonal trade theory  173
Finally, it is assumed that specialization in the production of one particular good does not 
result in gains in efficiency. But we know that specialization results in increased knowledge of 
a task and perhaps even future improvements in how that task is performed. Thus, the amount 
of resources needed to produce a specific amount of a good should decrease over time.
Despite the assumptions made in the theory of comparative advantage, research reveals that 
it appears to be supported by a substantial body of evidence. Nevertheless, economic researchers 
continue to develop and test new theories to explain international trade.

 3. The theories of absolute advantage and comparative advantage say that nations benefit

Factor Proportions Theory
In the early 1900s, an international trade theory emerged that focused attention on the proportion 
(supply) of resources in a nation. The cost of any resource is simply the result of supply and de-
mand: Factors in great supply relative to demand will be less costly than factors in short supply 
relative to demand. Factor proportions theory states that countries produce and export goods 
that require resources (factors) that are abundant and import goods that require resources in 
short supply.7 The theory resulted from the research of two economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil 
Ohlin, and is therefore sometimes called the Heckscher–Ohlin theory.
Factor proportions theory differs considerably from the theory of comparative advantage. 
Recall that the theory of comparative advantage states that a country specializes in producing 
the good that it can produce more efficiently than any other good. Thus, the focus of the theory 
(and absolute advantage, as well) is on the productivity of the production process for a particular 
good. By contrast, factor proportions theory says that a country specializes in producing and 
exporting goods using the factors of production that are most abundant and thus cheapest—not 
the goods in which it is most productive.

Labor versus Land and Capital equipment
Factor proportions theory breaks a nation’s resources into two categories: labor on the one hand, 
land and capital equipment on the other. It predicts that a country will specialize in products 
that require labor if the cost of labor is low relative to the cost of land and capital. Alternatively, 
a country will specialize in products that require land and capital equipment if their cost is low 
relative to the cost of labor.
Factor proportions theory is conceptually appealing. For example, Australia has a great deal 
of land (nearly 60 percent of which is meadows and pastures) and a small population relative to its 
size. Australia’s exports consist largely of mined minerals, grain, beef, lamb, and dairy products—
products that require a great deal of land and natural resources. Australia’s imports, on the other 
hand, consist mostly of manufactured raw materials, capital equipment, and consumer goods—
things needed in capital-intensive mining and modern agriculture. But instead of looking only at 
anecdotal evidence, let’s see how well factor proportions theory stands up to scientific testing.
evidence on Factor Proportions Theory: The Leontief Paradox
Despite its conceptual appeal, factor proportions theory is not supported by studies that examine 
the trade flows of nations. The first large-scale study to document such evidence was performed 
by a researcher named Wassily Leontief in the early 1950s.8 Leontief tested whether the United 
States, which uses an abundance of capital equipment, exports goods requiring capital-intensive 
production and imports goods requiring labor-intensive production. Contrary to the predictions 
of the factor proportions theory, his research found that U.S. exports require more labor-inten-
sive production than its imports. This apparent paradox between the predictions using the theory 
and the actual trade flows is called the Leontief paradox. Leontief’s findings are supported by 
more-recent research on the trade data of a large number of countries.
What might account for the paradox? One possible explanation is that factor proportions theory 
considers a country’s production factors to be homogeneous—particularly labor. But we know that 
labor skills vary greatly within a country—more highly skilled workers emerge from training and 
development programs. When expenditures on improving the skills of labor are taken into account, 
the theory seems to be supported by actual trade data. Further studies examining international trade 
data will help us better understand what reasons actually account for the Leontief paradox.
Because of the drawbacks of each of the international trade theories mentioned so far, 
researchers continue to propose new ones. Let’s now examine a theory that attempts to explain 
international trade based on the life cycle of products.

 1. What is the name of the theory that says countries produce and export goods that require 
resources that are abundant and import goods that require resources in short supply?
 2. Factor proportions theory divides a nation’s resources into what two categories?
International Product Life Cycle
Raymond Vernon put forth an international trade theory for manufactured goods in the mid-1960s. 
His international product life cycle theory says that a company will begin by exporting its product 
and later undertake foreign direct investment as the product moves through its life cycle. The theory 
also says that, for a number of reasons, a country’s export eventually becomes its import.9
Although Vernon developed his model around the United States, we can generalize it to 
apply to any developed and innovative market such as Australia, the European Union, and Japan. 
Let’s examine how this theory attempts to explain international trade flows.
stages of the Product Life Cycle
The international product life cycle theory follows the path of a good through its life cycle (from 
new to maturing to standardized product) in order to determine where it will be produced (see 
Figure 5.4). In Stage 1, the new product stage, the high purchasing power and demand of buy-
ers in an industrialized country drive a company to design and introduce a new product concept. 
Because the exact level of demand in the domestic market is highly uncertain at this point, the

company keeps its production volume low and based in the home country. Keeping production 
where initial research and development occurred and staying in contact with customers allow the 
company to monitor buyer preferences and to modify the product as needed. Although initially 
there is virtually no export market, exports do begin to pick up late in the new product stage.
In Stage 2, the maturing product stage, the domestic market and markets abroad become 
fully aware of the existence of the product and its benefits. Demand rises and is sustained over 
a fairly lengthy period of time. As exports begin to account for an increasingly greater share of 
total product sales, the innovating company introduces production facilities in the countries with 
the highest demand. Near the end of the maturity stage, the product begins generating sales in 
developing nations, and perhaps some manufacturing presence is established there.
In Stage 3, the standardized product stage, competition from other companies selling simi-
lar products pressures companies to lower prices in order to maintain sales levels. As the market 
becomes more price sensitive, the company begins searching aggressively for low-cost produc-
tion bases in developing nations to supply a growing worldwide market. Furthermore, as most 
production now takes place outside the innovating country, demand in the innovating country is 
supplied with imports from developing countries and other industrialized nations. Late in this 
stage, domestic production might even cease altogether.
Limitations of the Theory
Vernon developed his theory at a time when most new products were being developed and sold 
first in the United States. One reason U.S. companies were strong globally in the 1960s was that 
their domestic production bases were not destroyed during the Second World War, as was the 
case in Europe (and to some extent Japan). In addition, during the war, the production of many 
durable goods in the United States, including automobiles, was shifted to the production of mili-
tary transportation and weaponry. This laid the foundation for enormous postwar demand for 
new capital-intensive consumer goods, such as automobiles and home appliances. Furthermore, 
advances in technology that were originally developed with military purposes in mind were 
integrated into consumer goods. A wide range of new and innovative products like TVs, photo-
copiers, and computers met the seemingly insatiable appetite of consumers in the United States.
The theory seemed to explain world trade patterns quite well when the United States dominated 
world trade. But today, the theory’s ability to accurately depict the trade flows of nations is weak. 
The United States is no longer the sole innovator of products in the world. New products spring up 
everywhere as companies continue to globalize their research-and-development activities.
Furthermore, companies today design new products and make product modifications at a 
very quick pace. The result is quicker product obsolescence and a situation in which companies 
replace their existing products with new product introductions. This is forcing companies to 
introduce products in many markets simultaneously in order to recoup a product’s research-and-
development costs before sales decline and the product is dropped. The theory has a difficult 
time explaining the resulting trade patterns.
In fact, older theories might better explain today’s global trade patterns. Much production in 
the world today more closely resembles what is predicted by the theory of comparative advan-
tage. Boeing’s (www.boeing.com) assembly plant in Everett, Washington, assembles its 787 
Dreamliner wide-body aircraft. But companies around the world build the parts used in the 787.

Components are later assembled in a chosen location. This pattern resembles the theory of 
comparative advantage in that a product’s components are made in the country that can produce 
them at a high level of productivity.
Finally, the theory is challenged by the fact that more companies are operating in interna-
tional markets from their inception. Many small companies are teaming up with companies in 
other markets to develop new products or production technologies. This strategy is particularly 
effective for small companies that would otherwise be unable to participate in international 
production or sales. French company Ingenico (www.ingenico.com) is a leading global supplier 
of secure transaction systems, including terminals and their associated software. The company 
began small and worked with a global network of entrepreneurs who acted as Ingenico’s local 
agents and helped it to conquer local markets. The cultural knowledge embedded in Ingenico’s 
global network helped it to design and sell products appropriate for each market.11
The Internet also makes it easier for companies of all sizes to reach a global audience. For a 
discussion of several pitfalls companies can avoid in fulfilling their international orders taken on 
the Internet, see the Manager’s Briefcase, titled “Five Fulfillment Mistakes.”

New Trade Theory
During the 1970s and 1980s, another theory emerged to explain trade patterns.12 The new trade 
theory states that (1) there are gains to be made from specialization and increasing economies 
of scale, (2) the companies first to market can create barriers to entry, and (3) government may 
play a role in assisting its home companies. Because the theory emphasizes productivity rather 
than a nation’s resources, it is in line with the theory of comparative advantage but at odds with 
factor proportions theory.

Although there’s no way to completely foolproof logistics when 
selling online, a company should enjoy greater customer satisfac-
tion if it can avoid these five key mistakes:
• Mistake 1: Misunderstanding the Supply Chain How many 
orders can fulfillment centers fill in an hour, a day, and a week? 
How long does it take a package to reach a customer from the 
fulfillment center using standard, non-expedited delivery? And 
how much inventory can the centers receive on any given day? 
If a company doesn’t know the answers, it could be in serious 
danger of making delivery promises it can’t keep.
• Mistake 2: Overpromising on Delivery The entrepreneur 
owner/manager should not advertise aggressive delivery 
times without a qualifier for uncontrollable factors, such as the 
weather. Care must also be taken to ensure that a customer is 
not promised an unrealistically quick order-turnaround time. 
Flexibility must be built into fulfillment operations.
• Mistake 3: Not Planning for Returns Handling customer 
returns well can increase repeat business. The internal re-
turns process needs to be organized, and returns should not 
wait to go out until products start coming back to fulfillment 
centers. Prompt credit to customers can reward the entrepre-
neurial firm with a reputation as standing behind its products.
• Mistake 4: Misunderstanding Customer Needs Many 
Internet shoppers are willing to sacrifice shipping speed 
in exchange for lower shipping costs. Balancing this cost– 
service differential is an opportunity for online marketers to 
cut order-fulfillment costs.
• Mistake 5: Poor Internal Communication Marketing de-
partments must communicate with logistics people. A public 
relations nightmare can result if logistics professionals are not 
told and the big planned marketing push crashes the com-
pany website.

Chapter 5 • InternatIonal trade theory  177
First-mover Advantage
According to the new trade theory, as a company increases the extent to which it specializes in the pro-
duction of a particular good, output rises because of gains in efficiency. Regardless of the amount of a 
company’s output, it has fixed production costs such as the cost of research and development and the 
plant and equipment needed to produce the product. The theory states that, as specialization and out-
put increase, companies can realize economies of scale, thereby pushing the unit costs of production 
lower. That is why as many companies expand, they lower prices to buyers and force potential new 
competitors to produce at a similar level of output if they want to be competitive in their pricing. Thus, 
the presence of large economies of scale can create an industry that supports only a few large firms.
A first-mover advantage is the economic and strategic advantage gained by being the first 
company to enter an industry. This first-mover advantage can create a formidable barrier to entry 
for potential rivals. The new trade theory also states that a country may dominate in the export of 
a certain product because it has a home-based firm that has acquired a first-mover advantage.13
Because of the potential benefits of being the first company to enter an industry, some busi-
nesspeople and researchers make a case for government assistance to companies. They say that by 
working together to target potential new industries, a government and its home companies can take 
advantage of the benefits of being the first mover in an industry. Government involvement has always 
been widely accepted in undertakings such as space exploration for national security reasons, but has 
been less so in purely commercial ventures. But the fear that governments of other countries might 
participate with industry to gain first-mover advantages drives many governments into action.

National Competitive Advantage
What aspects of a nation’s economic development can supply it with a national competitive advan-
tage? The poorest nations tend to invest in the fundamental drivers of productivity growth (such as 
basic infrastructure). The richest nations typically exploit the latest technological advancements in 
order to boost productivity. Research into how nations achieve sustainable economic development 
has examined the potential roles of (1) culture, (2) geography, and (3) innovation. To read more 
about whether these factors drive economic growth, see this chapter’s Global Sustainability fea-
ture, titled “Foundations of Development.”
A related question researchers have tried to answer is, How do firms in certain nations 
develop competitive advantage in specific industries? Michael Porter put forth a theory in 1990 
to explain why certain countries are leaders in the production of certain products.14 His national 
competitive advantage theory states that a nation’s competitiveness in an industry depends on 
the capacity of the industry to innovate and upgrade. Porter’s work incorporates certain elements 
of previous international trade theories but also makes some important new discoveries.
Porter is not preoccupied with explaining the export and import patterns of nations but 
rather with explaining why some nations are more competitive in certain industries. He identi-
fies four elements that are present to varying degrees in every nation and that form the basis 
of national competitiveness. The Porter diamond consists of (1) factor conditions, (2) demand 
conditions, (3) related and supporting industries, and (4) firm strategy, structure, and rivalry. 
Let’s look at these elements and see how they interact to support national competitiveness.
Factor Conditions
Factor proportions theory considers a nation’s resources, such as a large labor force, natural 
resources, climate, or surface features, as paramount factors in what products a country will pro-
duce and export. Porter acknowledges the value of such resources, which he terms basic factors, 
but he also discusses the significance of what he calls advanced factors.

workforce and the quality of the technological infrastructure in a nation. Advanced factors

are the result of investments in education and innovation, including worker training and 
technological research and development. Whereas basic factors can be the initial spark for why 
an economy begins producing a certain product, advanced factors account for the sustained 
competitive advantage a country enjoys in that product.
Today, for example, Japan has an advantage in automobile production and the United States 
in the manufacture of airplanes. In the manufacture of computer components, Taiwan reigns 
supreme, although China is an increasingly important competitor. These countries did not attain 
their status in their respective areas because of basic factors. For example, Japan did not acquire 
its advantage in automobiles because of its natural resources of iron ore—it has virtually none 
and must import most of the iron it needs. These countries developed their productivity and 
advantages in producing these products through deliberate efforts.
demand Conditions
Sophisticated buyers in the home market are also important to national competitive advantage in 
a product area. A sophisticated domestic market drives companies to add new design features to 
products and to develop entirely new products and technologies. Companies in markets with so-
phisticated buyers should see the competitiveness of the entire group improve. For example, the 
sophisticated U.S. market for computer software has helped give companies based in the United 
States an edge in developing new software products.
related and supporting Industries
Companies that belong to a nation’s internationally competitive industries do not exist in iso-
lation. Rather, supporting industries spring up to provide the inputs required by the industry. 
This happens because companies that can benefit from the product or process technologies of 
an internationally competitive industry begin to form clusters of related economic activities in 
the same geographic area. Each industry in the cluster serves to reinforce the productivity and, 
therefore, competitiveness of every other industry within the cluster. For example, Italy is home 
to a successful cluster in the footwear industry that greatly benefits from the country’s closely 
related leather-tanning and fashion-design industries. And within the United States, Phoenix, 
Arizona, is home to companies that specialize in semiconductors, optics, and electronic test-
ing—all heavily incorporated into the activities of Boeing (www.boeing.com) and Motorola 
(www.motorola.com), which have a significant presence there.
of vast natural resources. Each of these nations also threw off 
dependence on a colonial power.
• Innovation Nations that want to join the European Union 
must satisfy strict and innovative requirements. This is pull-
ing Eastern Europe’s culture closer to Western Europe’s, 
along with shifting habits, attitudes, and values. In emerg-
ing markets today, innovation is being driven by ambition 
to improve one’s lot in life and the fear of being replaced 
by an even cheaper production location. Homegrown busi-
nesses in emerging markets have developed very inexpensive 
yet highly functional automobiles, computers, and mobile 
phones that appeal to consumers at home and abroad.

Which aspects of a nation influence its path toward sustainable 
economic development? Researchers point to a host of different 
factors, including the following:
• Culture Some researchers believe cultural differences among 
nations can explain differences in development, material 
well-being, and socioeconomic equity. They argue that any 
culture can attain high productivity and economic growth if it 
values the benefits that development brings. Critics say that 
this perspective unfairly judges other cultures. They argue 
that each culture defines its own values, practices, goals, and 
ethics, and that Western nations should not impose their con-
cept of “progress” on other cultures.
• Geography Other researchers claim geography is central to 
productivity and economic development. Factors thought 
to hinder development include being a landlocked nation 
far from the coast, having poor access to markets, possess-
ing few natural resources, and having a tropical climate. But 
Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan built com-
petitive market economies despite their small size and lack

Chapter 5 • InternatIonal trade theory  179
A relatively small number of clusters usually account for a major share of regional eco-
nomic activity. They also often account for an overwhelming share of the economic activity that 
is “exported” to other locations. Exporting clusters—those that export products or make invest-
ments to compete outside the local area—are the primary source of an area’s long-term prosper-
ity. Although demand for a local industry is inherently limited by the size of the local market, an 
exporting cluster can grow far beyond that limit.15
Firm strategy, structure, and rivalry
The strategies of firms and the actions of their managers have lasting effects on future com-
petitiveness. Essential to successful companies are managers who are committed to producing 
quality products valued by buyers while maximizing the firm’s market share and/or financial 
returns. Equally as important is the industry structure and rivalry between a nation’s companies. 
The more intense the struggle to survive between a nation’s domestic companies, the greater 
will be their competitiveness. This heightened competitiveness helps them to compete against 
imports and against companies that might develop a production presence in the home market.
Government and Chance
Apart from the four factors identified as part of the diamond, Porter identifies the roles of gov-
ernment and chance in fostering the national competitiveness of industries.
First, governments, by their actions, can often increase the competitiveness of firms and per-
haps even entire industries. Governments of emerging markets could increase economic growth 
by increasing the pace of privatization of state-owned companies, for example. Privatization 
forces those companies to grow more competitive in world markets if they are to survive.
Second, although chance events can help the competitiveness of a firm or an industry, it can 
also threaten it. McDonald’s (www.mcdonalds.com) holds a clear competitive advantage worldwide 
in the fast-food industry. But its overwhelming dominance was threatened by the discovery of mad 
cow disease several years ago. To keep customers from flocking to the nonbeef substitute products 
of competitors, McDonald’s introduced the McPork sandwich and other nonbeef products.
There are important implications for companies and governments if Porter’s theory accu-
rately identifies the important drivers of national competitiveness. For instance, government poli-
cies should not be designed to protect national industries that are not internationally competitive 
but should develop the components of the diamond that contribute to increased competitiveness.

development to a nation and its people. As the value and 
volume of trade continue to expand worldwide, new theories will 
likely emerge to explain why countries trade and why nations have 
advantages in producing certain products.
Globalization and Trade
An underlying theme of this book is how companies are adapt-
ing to globalization. Globalization and the increased com-
petition it causes are forcing companies to locate particular 
operations to where they can be performed most efficiently. Firms 
are doing this either by relocating their own production facilities 
to other nations or by outsourcing certain activities to compa-
nies abroad. Companies undertake such action in order to boost 
competitiveness.
The relocation and outsourcing of business activities are alter-
ing international trade in both goods and services. In this  chapter’s 
opening company profile, we saw that Walmart relies on the 
sourcing of products from low-cost production locations such as 
China to deliver low-priced goods. Hewlett-Packard also makes

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Describe the benefits, volume, and patterns of international trade.
• Trade provides a country’s people with a greater choice of goods and services and is 
an important engine for job creation in many countries.
• Nations export more than $14 trillion of merchandise and more than $4 trillion  
of services each year, with trade flows following the pace of world economic  
output.
• Wealthy nations account for around 60 percent of world merchandise trade. Trade be-
tween wealthy nations on the one hand and middle- and low-income countries on the 
other accounts for around 34 percent. Trade between low-income and middle-income 
nations accounts for around 6 percent.
 LO2. Explain how mercantilism worked and identify its inherent flaws.
• Mercantilism says that nations should accumulate financial wealth in the form of 
gold by encouraging exports and discouraging imports.
• Governments believed that they should intervene actively in international trade in 
order to maintain a trade surplus, mainly by acquiring colonies to serve as sources of 
inexpensive raw materials and as markets for higher-priced finished goods.
• Mercantilism is flawed because it assumes that a nation increases its wealth only at 
the expense of other nations (a zero-sum game), and it restricts the economic devel-
opment of colonies—thus limiting the amount of goods they could purchase from the 
wealthy nation.
 LO3. Detail the theories of absolute advantage and comparative advantage.
• The ability of a nation to produce a good more efficiently than any other nation is 
called an absolute advantage, which advocates letting market forces dictate trade 
flows.
• Absolute advantage allows a country to produce goods in which it holds an absolute 
advantage and trade with other nations to obtain goods it needs but does not produce 
(a positive-sum game).
use of globalization and international trade to minimize costs 
while maximizing output. The company dispersed the design and 
production of a new computer server throughout an increasingly 
specialized electronics-manufacturing system. HP conceptualized 
and designed the computer in Singapore, engineered and manu-
factured many parts for it in Taiwan, and assembled it in Australia, 
China, India, and Singapore. Companies are using such production 
and distribution techniques to maximize efficiency.
Not only is the production of goods being sent to distant loca-
tions, but so too is the delivery of business services, including financial 
accounting, data processing, and the handling of credit card and 
insurance inquiries. Even jobs requiring higher-level skills such as en-
gineering, computer programming, and scientific research are migrat-
ing to distant locations. The motivation for companies is the same as 
when they send manufacturing jobs to more cost-effective locations—
remaining viable in the face of increasing competitive pressure.
supporting Free Trade
International trade theory is fundamentally no different when it 
comes to the relocation of services production as compared with 
the production of goods. As we’ve seen in this chapter, trade 
theory tells us that if a refrigerator bound for a Western market can 
be made more cheaply in China, it should be. The same reasoned 
logic tells us that if a credit card inquiry from a Western market can 
be more cheaply (but adequately) processed in India, it should be. 
In both cases, the importing country benefits from a less-expensive 
product, and the exporting country benefits from inward-flowing 
investment and more numerous and better-paying jobs.
Finally, there are policy implications for governments. Although 
employment in developed countries should not be negatively 
affected in the aggregate, job dislocation is a concern. Many gov-
ernments are encouraging lifelong education among workers to 
guard against the possibility that an individual may become “ob-
solete” in terms of lacking marketable skills relative to workers in 
other nations. And no matter how loud the calls for protectionism 
grow in the service sector, governments will do well to resist such 
temptations. Experience tells us that erecting barriers to competi-
tion results in less competitive firms and industries, greater job 
losses, and lower standards of living than would be the case under 
free trade.

 
Chapter 5 • InternatIonal trade theory  181
• A nation holds a comparative advantage in production of a good when it is unable 
to produce the good more efficiently than other nations but can produce it more ef-
ficiently than it can any other good.
• Thus, trade is still beneficial if one country is less efficient in the production of two 
goods, so long as it is less inefficient in the production of one of the goods.
 LO4. Summarize the factor proportions theory of trade.
• The factor proportions theory states that countries produce and export goods that 
require resources (factors) that are abundant and import goods that require resources 
that are in short supply.
• Factor proportions theory predicts that a country will specialize in products that re-
quire labor if its cost is low relative to the cost of land and capital, and vice versa.
• The apparent paradox between predictions of the theory and actual trade flows is 
called the Leontief paradox.
 LO5. Explain the international product life cycle theory.
• The international product life cycle theory says that a company will begin export-
ing its product and later undertake foreign direct investment as the product moves 
through its life cycle.
• In the new product stage, production remains based in the home country; in the ma-
turing product stage, production begins in countries with the highest demand; and in 
the standardized product stage, production moves to low-cost locations to supply a 
global market.
 LO6. Outline the new trade theory and the first-mover advantage. 
• The new trade theory argues that, as specialization and output increase, companies 
realize economies of scale that push the unit costs of production lower.
• This forces potential new entrants to an industry to produce a similar level of output 
if they want to be competitive in their pricing.
• The economies of scale in production help a firm to gain a first-mover advantage—
the economic and strategic advantage gained by being the first company to enter an 
industry.
 LO7. Describe the national competitive advantage theory and the Porter diamond.
• National competitive advantage theory states that a nation’s competitiveness in an 
industry (and, therefore, trade flows) depends on the capacity of the industry to inno-
vate and upgrade.
• The Porter diamond identifies four elements that form the basis of national competi-
tiveness: (1) factor conditions (basic and advanced), (2) demand conditions,  
(3) related and supporting industries, and (4) firm strategy, structure, and rivalry.
• The actions of governments and the occurrence of chance events can also affect the 
competitiveness of a nation’s companies.

BT in Local and International Markets
B 
T Group PLC (BT) is the world’s oldest telecommunications 
company, dating back to the nineteenth century. Based in the 
United Kingdom, it is the largest telecommunications service com-
pany in the world and has operations in more than 170 countries. 
Customers include individuals and small businesses as well as 
 multinational corporations. Its operations and market, however, are 
not limited solely to the United Kingdom.
BT has made strategic alliances with telecommunications 
companies worldwide, which give BT access to overseas mar-
kets and facilitate its international operations. In June 1994, BT 
launched a new $1 billion joint venture company, named Concert 
Communications Services. The joint venture was with MCI 
Communication Corporation, the second-largest carrier of long-
distance telecommunications services in the United States. The 
alliance provides BT with a global network of end-to-end connec-
tivity for advanced business services. BT also entered into another 
joint venture with AT&T, the American telecommunication giant, 
in 1999 to serve the needs of its business and individual customers.
Acquisition has been another strategy of BT to expand its 
global market share. In 2005, BT acquired a world-leading pro-
vider of voice and data network services to corporate customers, 
Infonet (rebranded as BT Infonet). In the same year, BT bought 
Radianz (renamed as BT Radianz later). Moreover, BT acquired 
Albacom, the second-largest telecommunications operator in the 
Italian business market. The acquisitions expanded BT’s coverage 
and increased its capability to supply networked IT services to 
international organizations and financial markets across the globe. 
Furthermore, they provided BT with more buying power in certain 
countries and enhanced its position as a leading provider of com-
munication solutions across the world.
In local markets, BT has always tried to be a leader and first 
mover. In the broadband service market, BT launched its commer-
cial broadband service in March 2000 and achieved its target of 6 
million broadband lines by the summer of 2005. Thanks to its well-
structured and well-distributed network across the United Kingdom, 
in 2000, BT provided other telecommunications operators access to 
its copper local loops (i.e., the connection between the customer’s 
premises and the exchange) to connect directly with their custom-
ers. By mid- 2005, more than 100,000 lines had been unbundled.
In 2004, BT launched its very ambitious and radical next 
generation network transformation program, called 21st Century 
Network (21CN). 21CN facilitates communications between an 
extensive range of devices including computers, laptops, PDAs, 
mobile phones, and home phones.
BT, however, is confronted with many challenges in the British 
market these days. It has lost its market share to other network own-
ers, new arrivals, innovative companies, and low-cost followers. 
In the residential broadband service market, BT has lost its first 
position to TalkTalk, a provider of broadband, home phone, mobile 
phone, and television that came to the market in 2003 as a subsid-
iary of The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC. TalkTalk is now the 
United Kingdom’s largest residential broadband provider. It serves 
nearly 4.3 million customers in this market, which gives it a share 
of more than 25 percent. TalkTalk announced £115 million profit 
before tax in March 2010—while BT showed a loss months before 
it. TalkTalk’s focus on low-price residential broadband and phone 
services has been its main competitive advantage.
BT’s other rival is Virgin Broadband, which is also a ma-
jor owner of the UK’s telecommunications infrastructure. Virgin 
Broadband was launched in 2006, following the merger of NTL and 
Telewest. It currently has the third place in the UK broadband ser-
vice market, after TalkTalk and BT. It serves around 4 million cus-
tomers. Virgin Broadband aims to be the market leader in super-fast 
broadband services. Its new target is a 100Mb broadband service 
that will make Virgin Broadband services absolutely exceptional.
Low-cost broadband providers on the one hand, and techno-
logically advanced broadband providers on the other hand, put more 
and more pressure on BT in both local and international markets. 
BT constantly works on its fast broadband networks and its opera-
tional costs. In addition, in 2009, BT decided to cut as many as to 
15,000 jobs. The broadband sector in the United Kingdom is prepar-
ing for a next generation of broadband service, and BT is still trying 
to be a first mover in this business.

the worldwide box office. The entire 
trilogy earned nearly $3 billion world-
wide and won 17 Academy Awards. 
New line Cinema also found big suc-
cess in The Hobbit trilogy, also di-
rected by Peter Jackson.
warner Bros.’s series of Harry 
Potter films, based on the novels of 
former British schoolteacher J.K. 
Rowling, have been magically success-
ful. Kids worldwide poured into cinemas to watch young Harry on the silver screen 
and snatched up Harry Potter books in every major language. warner Bros. also hit it 
big with the Batman film The Dark Knight—one of the highest-grossing films ever—
and, more recently, The Lego Movie. Shown here, a life-size wyldstyle and Emmet 
Brickowski attend the screening of The Lego Movie in leicester Square, london. 
warner Bros. also produces mini-movies and games exclusively for its website.
yet Time warner must tread carefully as it expands its reach. Some governments 
fear that their own nations’ writers, actors, directors, and producers will be drowned out 
by big-budget Hollywood productions such as The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and 
Batman. others fear the replacement of their traditional values with those depicted in 
imported entertainment. As you read this chapter, consider all the cultural, political, and 
economic reasons why governments regulate international trade.1

part 3 • international trade and investment
Chapter 5 presented theories that describe what the patterns of international trade should look 
like. The theory of comparative advantage says that the country that has a comparative advan-
tage in the production of a certain good will produce that good when barriers to trade do not 
exist. But this ideal does not accurately characterize trade in today’s global marketplace. despite 
efforts by organizations such as the world Trade organization (www.wto.org) and smaller 
groups of countries, nations still retain many barriers to trade.
In this chapter, we investigate the political economy of trade. we first explain why nations 
erect barriers to trade by exploring their cultural, political, and economic motives. we then ex-
amine the instruments countries use to restrict imports and exports. Efforts to promote trade by 
reducing barriers within the context of the global trading system are then presented. In Chapter 8 
we discuss how smaller groups of countries are eliminating barriers to both trade and investment.
Why Do Governments Intervene in Trade?
The pattern of imports and exports that occurs in the absence of trade barriers is called free 
trade. despite the advantages of open and free trade among nations, governments have long 
intervened in the trade of goods and services. Governments impose restrictions on free trade 
for political, economic, or cultural reasons. For example, countries often intervene in trade by 
strongly supporting their domestic companies’ exporting activities. But the more emotionally 
charged intervention occurs when a nation’s economy is underperforming. In tough economic 
times, businesses and workers often lobby their governments for protection from imports that 
are eliminating jobs in the domestic market. let’s take a closer look at the political, economic, 
and cultural motives for intervention.
Political Motives
Government officials often make trade-related decisions based on political motives because a 
politician’s career can depend on pleasing voters and getting reelected. yet, a trade policy based 
purely on political motives is seldom wise in the long run. The main political motives behind 
government intervention in trade include protecting jobs, preserving national security, respond-
ing to other nations’ unfair trade practices, and gaining influence over other nations.2
PrOTeCT JOBS Short of an unpopular war, nothing will oust a government faster than high rates 
of unemployment. Thus, practically all governments become involved when free trade creates 
job losses at home. For example, ohio lost around 215,000 manufacturing jobs over a recent 
14-year period. Most of those jobs went to China and the nations of Central and Eastern Europe. 
The despair of unemployed workers and the pivotal role of ohio in presidential elections lured 
politicians to the state, who promised ohio lower income taxes, expanded worker retraining, and 
greater investment in the state’s infrastructure.
But political efforts to protect jobs can draw attention away from free trade’s real benefits. 
General Electric (GE) certainly sent many jobs from the United States to Mexico over the years. 
GE now employs 30,000 Mexicans at 35 factories that manufacture all sorts of its appliances and 
other goods. But less known is that GE also sold Mexican companies $350 million worth of its 
turbines made in Texas, 100 of its locomotives made in Pennsylvania, and dozens of its U.S.-
made aircraft engines. Mexico specializes in making products that require less-expensive labor, 
and the United States specializes in producing goods that require advanced technology and a 
large investment of capital.3
PreServe NATiONAL SeCuriTy Human, economic, and environmental security are closely 
related to national security. The globalization of markets and production creates new security 
risks for companies. To read about these risks, see this chapter’s Global Sustainability feature, 
titled “Managing Security in the Age of Globalization.”
National Security and imports Certain imports can be restricted in the name of preserving 
national security. In the event of war, governments must have access to a domestic supply of 
certain items such as weapons, fuel, and air, land, and sea transportation in case their availability 
is restricted. Many nations continue to search for oil within their borders in case war disrupts its 
flow from outside sources. legitimate national security reasons for intervention can be difficult 
to argue against, particularly when they have the support of most of a country’s people.

Chapter 6 • politiCal eConomy of trade   187
Some countries claim that national security is the reason for fierce protection of their agri-
cultural sector, since food security is essential at a time of war. France has been criticized by 
many nations for ardently protecting its agricultural sector. French agricultural subsidies are 
intended to provide a fair financial return for French farmers, who traditionally operate on a 
small scale and therefore have high production costs and low profit margins. But many devel-
oped nations are exposing agribusiness to market forces and prompting their farmers to discover 
new ways to manage risk and increase efficiency. Innovative farmers are experimenting with 
more intensive land management, high-tech precision farming, and greater use of biotechnology.
yet, protection from import competition does have its drawbacks. Perhaps the main one is 
the added cost of continuing to produce a good or provide a service domestically that could be 
supplied more efficiently from abroad. Also, a policy of protection may remain in place much 
longer than necessary once it is adopted. Thus, policy makers should consider whether an issue 
truly is a matter of national security before intervening in trade.
National Security and exports Governments also have national security motives for banning 
certain defense-related goods from export to other nations. Most industrialized nations have 
agencies that review requests to export technologies or products that are said to have dual uses—
meaning they have both industrial and military applications. Products designated as dual use are 
classified as such and require special governmental approval before export can take place.
Products on the dual-use lists of most nations include nuclear materials, technological 
equipment, certain chemicals and toxins, some sensors and lasers, and specific devices related 
to weapons, navigation, aerospace, and propulsion. Bans on the export of dual-use products 
were strictly enforced during the Cold war years between the west and the former Soviet Union. 
whereas many countries relaxed enforcement of these controls in recent years, the continued 
threat of terrorism and fears of weapons of mass destruction are renewing support for such bans.
Nations also place certain companies and organizations in other countries on a list of enti-
ties that are restricted from receiving their exports. For example, the owner of an electronics 
firm pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to illegally export dual-use items from the United 
States to India for possible use in ballistic missiles, space launch vehicles, and fighter jets. 
Parthasarathy Sudarshan admitted that he provided the components to government entities in 
India, including two companies on the U.S. department of Commerce’s “Entity list.” Sudarshan 
was sentenced to 35 months in a U.S. federal prison and was fined $60,000.4
• Reputational Risk  News today travels worldwide quickly. 
Reputational risk is anything that can harm a firm’s image, 
 including product recalls, workers’ rights violations, and lawsuits. 
The damaged reputation of Goldman Sachs following a $550 
million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
for its actions before and during recent financial crises cost the 
firm 40 percent ($6 billion) of its brand value in one year.
• What to Do Like the risks themselves, the challenges are varied. 
Companies should identify all potential risks to their facilities and 
then develop a best-practice property risk program. It sounds 
simple, but employees must change passwords frequently, 
safeguard their computers and mobile devices from attack, and 
return company-owned digital devices when leaving the firm. 
Finally, ever-increasing scrutiny means that companies should act 
ethically and within the law to protect their reputations.

lesecurity.org), the Foundation for Environmental Security and 
Sustainability (www.fess-global.org), Kroll (www.krollworldwide.
com), and Check Point Software Technologies (www.

As well as the need to secure lengthy supply chains and distribu-
tion channels, companies must secure their facilities, information 
systems, and reputations.
• Facilities Risk Large companies with top-notch property 
risk–management programs produce more stable earnings. 
Companies practicing weak risk management experience 
55 times greater risk of property loss due to fire and 29 
times greater risk of property loss caused by natural hazards. 
Planning and facilities assessment (around $12,000 for a mid-
sized company, $1 million for a large firm) can be well worth 
the cost.
• Information Risk Computer viruses, software worms, 
 malicious code, and cyber criminals cost companies around 
the world many billions of dollars each year. Disgruntled 
employees, dishonest competitors, and hackers who steal 
customers’ personal and financial data can then sell it to the 
highest bidder. Upon termination, employees sometimes 
leave with digital devices containing confidential memos, 
competitive data, and private e-mails.

reSPONd TO “uNfAir” TrAde Many observers argue that it makes no sense for one nation 
to allow free trade if other nations actively protect their own industries. Governments often 
threaten to close their ports to another nation’s ships or to impose extremely high tariffs on its 
goods if the other nation does not concede on some trade issue that is seen as being unfair. In 
other words, if one government thinks another nation is not “playing fair,” it will often threaten 
to retaliate unless certain concessions are made.
GAiN iNfLueNCe Governments of the world’s largest nations may become involved in trade to 
gain influence over smaller nations. The United States goes to great lengths to gain and maintain 
control over events in all of Central, North, and South America, and the Caribbean basin.
The United States has banned all trade and investment with Cuba since 1962 in the hope of 
exerting political influence against its communist leaders. designed to pressure Cuba’s government 
to change, the policy has caused suffering among Cuba’s citizens. Many Cubans have perished trying 
to reach the United States on homemade rafts. But change is occurring in Cuba, and in recent years 
its people can buy dVd players, stay in tourist hotels, and use mobile phones. Even the concept of 
performance-related pay was introduced. These seemingly trivial freedoms represent monumental 
change to ordinary Cubans, who now hope for the right to buy cars, travel, and buy and sell property.5
economic Motives
Although governments intervene in trade for highly charged cultural and political reasons, they 
also have economic motives for their intervention. The most common economic reasons for na-
tions’ attempts to influence international trade are the protection of young industries from com-
petition and the promotion of a strategic trade policy.
PrOTeCT iNfANT iNduSTrieS According to the infant industry argument, a country’s 
emerging industries need protection from international competition during their development 
phase until they become sufficiently competitive internationally. This argument is based on the 
idea that infant industries need protection because of a steep learning curve. In other words, 
only as an industry grows and matures does it gain the knowledge it needs to become more 
innovative, efficient, and competitive.
Although this argument is conceptually appealing, it does have several problems. First, it 
requires governments to distinguish between industries that are worth protecting and those that 
are not. This is difficult, if not impossible, to do. For years, Japan has targeted infant indus-
tries for protection, low interest loans, and other benefits. Its performance on assisting these 
activists in london, england, 
protest against genetically 
modified organisms (Gmos). 
Gmos are plants and animals 
that have had their dna 
genetically altered. all types 
of crops today, including 
corn, soybeans, and wheat, 
are grown with genetically 
enhanced seed technology 
to resist insects and disease. 
many people in europe fiercely 
resist U.s. efforts to export Gm 
crops to their markets. do you 
believe europeans are right to 
be wary of the importation of 
Gm crops?

industries was very good through the early 1980s but has been less successful since then. Until 
the government achieves future success in identifying and targeting industries, supporting this 
type of policy remains questionable.
Second, protection from international competition can cause domestic companies to 
become complacent toward innovation. This can limit a company’s incentives to obtain the 
knowledge it needs to become more competitive. The most extreme examples of complacency 
are industries within formerly communist nations. when their communist protections collapsed, 
nearly all companies that were run by the state were decades behind their competitors from capi-
talist nations. To survive, many government-owned businesses required financial assistance in 
the form of infusions of capital or outright purchase.
Third, protection can do more economic harm than good. Consumers often end up paying 
more for products because a lack of competition typically creates fewer incentives to cut produc-
tion costs or improve quality. Meanwhile, companies become less competitive and more reliant 
on protection. Protection in Japan created a two-tier economy where, in one tier, highly competi-
tive multinational corporations faced rivals in overseas markets and learned to become strong 
competitors. In the other tier, domestic industries were made noncompetitive through protected 
markets, high wages, and barriers to imports.
Fourth, the infant industry argument also says that it is not always possible for small, prom-
ising companies to obtain funding in capital markets, and thus they need financial support from 
their government. However, international capital markets today are far more sophisticated than 
in the past, and promising business ventures can normally obtain funding from private sources.
PurSue STrATeGiC TrAde POLiCy Recall from our discussion in Chapter 5 that new trade 
theorists believe government intervention can help companies take advantage of economies 
of scale and become the first movers in their industries. First-mover advantages arise because 
economies of scale in production limit the number of companies that an industry can sustain.
Benefits of Strategic Trade Policy Supporters of strategic trade policy argue that it results 
in increased national income. Companies should earn a good profit if they obtain first-mover 
advantages and solidify positions in their markets around the world. Advocates claim that 
strategic trade policies helped South Korea build global conglomerates (called chaebol) that 
dwarf competitors. For years, South Korean shipbuilders received a variety of government 
subsidies, including low-cost financing. The chaebol helped South Korea to emerge strongly 
from the recent global economic crisis because of their market power and the wide range of 
industries in which they compete. Such policies had spin-off effects on related industries, and 
local suppliers to the chaebol are now thriving.6
drawbacks of Strategic Trade Policy Although it sounds as if strategic trade policy only has 
benefits, there can be drawbacks as well. lavish government assistance to domestic companies 
in the past caused inefficiency and high costs for both South Korean and Japanese companies. 
large government concessions to local labor unions hiked wages and forced Korea’s chaebol to 
accept low profit margins.7
In addition, when governments decide to support specific industries, their choice is often subject 
to political lobbying by the groups seeking government assistance. It is possible that special interest 
groups could capture all the gains from assistance with no benefit for consumers. If this were to occur, 
consumers could end up paying more for lower-quality goods than they could otherwise obtain.
Cultural Motives
Nations often restrict trade in goods and services to achieve cultural objectives, the most common 
being protection of national identity. Culture and trade are intertwined and greatly affect one another. 
The cultures of countries are slowly altered by exposure to the people and products of other cultures. 
Unwanted cultural influence in a nation can cause great distress and force a government to block im-
ports that it believes are harmful (recall our discussion of cultural imperialism in Chapter 2).
French law bans foreign-language words from virtually all business and government com-
munications, radio and TV broadcasts, public announcements, and advertising messages—at 
least whenever a suitable French alternative is available. you can’t advertise a best seller; it has 
to be a succès de librairie. you can’t sell popcorn at le cinéma; French moviegoers must snack on 
mais soufflé. The Higher Council on French language works against the inclusion of so-called 

190  
part 3 • international trade and investment
Franglais phrases such as le marketing, le cash flow, and le brainstorming into commerce and 
other areas of French culture. Not to be outdone by neighboring France, German bureaucrats 
plan to exchange governmental use of English words with German ones, for example, replacing 
brainstorming with ideensammlung and meeting points with treffpukte.8
Canada also tries to mitigate the cultural influence of entertainment products imported from 
the United States. Canada requires at least 35 percent of music played over Canadian radio to 
be by Canadian artists. In fact, many countries are considering laws to protect their media pro-
gramming for cultural reasons. The downside of such restrictions is they reduce the selection of 
products available to consumers.
CuLTurAL iNfLueNCe Of The uNiTed STATeS International trade is the vehicle by which 
the English language swiftly infiltrates the cultures of other nations. International trade in all 
sorts of goods and services is exposing people around the world to new words, ideas, products, 
and ways of life. Still, as international trade continues to expand, many governments try to limit 
potential adverse effects on their cultures and economies.
The United States, more than any other nation, is seen by many around the world as a threat 
to local culture. The reason is the global strength of the United States in entertainment and media 
(such as movies, magazines, and music) and consumer goods. These products are highly visible 
to all consumers and cause groups of various kinds to lobby government officials for protection 
from their cultural influence. domestic producers find it easy to join in the calls for protection 
because the rhetoric of protectionism often receives widespread public support.
oddly, many small businesses capable of exporting have not yet begun to do so. By 
some estimates, only 10 percent of U.S. companies with fewer than 100 employees export. 
Encouraging greater export activity may require U.S. companies to undergo a cultural shift in 
mindset. Although a lack of investment capital can be a real obstacle to exporting for small busi-
nesses, some common myths in the business culture create artificial obstacles. To explore some 
of these myths and the facts that dispute them, see this chapter’s Culture Matters feature, titled 
“Myths of Small Business Exporting.”

 2. For what political reasons does a government intervene in trade?
 3. what are some economic reasons why a government intervenes in trade?
 4. Some people see the products of what country as the greatest threat to local cultures around 
the world?
• Myth 1: Only large companies can export successfully.
 
Fact: Most exporters are small and medium-sized enterprises 
with fewer than 50 employees. Exporting can reduce the de-
pendency of small firms on domestic markets and can help 
them avoid seasonal sales fluctuations. A product popular 
domestically, or perhaps even unsuccessful at home, may be 
wanted elsewhere in the global market.
• Myth 2: Small businesses can find little export advice.
 
Fact: Novice and experienced exporters alike can receive 
comprehensive export assistance from federal agencies 
(www.export.gov). International trade specialists can help 
small businesses locate and use federal, state, local, and 
private-sector programs. They are also an excellent source of 
market research, trade leads, financing, and trade events.
• Myth 3: Licensing requirements needed to export are too 
complicated.
 
Fact: Most products do not need export licenses. 
Exporters need only to write “NLR” for “no license re-
quired” on their Shipper’s Export Declaration. A license 
is generally needed only for high-tech or defense-related 
goods or when the receiving country is under a U.S. em-
bargo or other restriction.
• Myth 4: Small businesses cannot obtain export  
financing.
 
Fact: The Small Business Administration (www.sba.gov) 
and the Export-Import Bank (www.exim.gov) work together 
in lending money to small businesses. Whereas the SBA is 
responsible for loan requests below $750,000, the Export-
Import Bank handles transactions over $750,000. The Trade 
and Development Agency (www.ustda.gov) also helps small 
and medium-sized firms obtain financing for international 
projects.

Instruments of Trade Promotion
The previous discussion alluded to the types of instruments governments use to promote or re-
strict trade with other nations. The most common instruments that governments use are shown in 
Table 6.1. In this section, we examine methods of trade promotion. we cover methods of trade 
restriction in the next section.
Subsidies
Financial assistance to domestic producers in the form of cash payments, low-interest loans, tax 
breaks, product price supports, or other forms is called a subsidy. Regardless of the form a sub-
sidy takes, it is intended to assist domestic companies in fending off international competitors. 
This can mean becoming more competitive in the home market or increasing competitiveness in 
international markets through exports. It is extremely difficult to calculate the amount of subsi-
dies a country offers its producers because of the many forms that subsidies take. This makes 
the work of the world Trade organization difficult when it is called on to settle arguments over 
subsidies (the world Trade organization is discussed later in this chapter).
drAwBACkS Of SuBSidieS Critics say that subsidies encourage inefficiency and complacency 
by covering costs that truly competitive industries should be able to absorb on their own. Many 
believe subsidies benefit companies and industries that receive them but harm consumers 
because they tend to be paid for with income and sales taxes. Thus, although subsidies provide 
short-term relief to companies and industries, whether they help a nation’s citizens in the long 
term is questionable.
Some observers say that far more devastating is the effect of subsidies on farmers in devel-
oping and emerging markets. we’ve already seen that many wealthy nations award subsidies to 
their farmers to ensure an adequate food supply for their people. It is said that these subsidies, 
worth billions of dollars, make it difficult if not impossible for farmers from poor countries to 
sell their unsubsidized (i.e., more expensive) food on world markets. Compounding the plight 
of these farmers is the fact that their nations are being forced to eliminate trade barriers by inter-
national organizations. The economic consequences for poor farmers in Africa, Asia, and latin 
America are higher unemployment and poverty.9
Subsidies can lead to an overuse of resources, negative environmental effects, and higher 
costs for commodities. A recent period of rising fuel prices gave researches to examine the 
effects of subsidies on fuel usage. Subsidies tend to drive fuel prices higher and eliminate incen-
tives to conserve fuel. As fuel prices soared in China, the government increased its heavy sub-
sidies of energy in fear of inflation and street protests. China’s fuel subsidies for a single year 
were estimated at a whopping $40 billion. The study found that whereas countries without fuel 
subsidies saw steady or falling demand, subsidizing countries saw rising demand that threatened 
to outstrip growth in global fuel supplies.10
export financing
Governments often promote exports by helping companies finance their export activities. They can 
offer loans that a company could otherwise not obtain or can charge them an interest rate that is 
lower than the market rate. Another option is for a government to guarantee that it will repay the 
loan of a company if the company should default on repayment; this is called a loan guarantee.

Many nations have special agencies dedicated to helping their domestic companies obtain 
export financing. For example, a very well-known institution is called the Export-Import Bank 
of the United States—or Ex-Im Bank for short. The Ex-Im Bank (www.exim.gov) finances the 
export activities of companies in the United States and offers insurance on foreign accounts 
receivable. Another U.S. government agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation 
(OPIC), also provides insurance services but for investors. Through oPIC (www.opic.gov), 
companies that invest abroad can insure against losses due to (1) expropriation, (2) currency 
inconvertibility, and (3) war, revolution, and insurrection.
Receiving financing from government agencies is often crucial to the success of small 
businesses that are just beginning to export. Taken together, small businesses account for more 
than 80 percent of all transactions handled by the Ex-Im Bank. For instance, the Ex-Im Bank 
guaranteed to cover a loan of nearly $4 million to help fund development of an amusement 
park in Accra, Ghana. The investment in Africa is in response to rising demand for world-class 
amusement parks across west Africa. The park will employ at least 175 local Ghanaians under 
the supervision of U.S. expatriate managers. For more on how the Ex-Im Bank helps businesses 
gain export financing, see the Manager’s Briefcase, titled “Experts in Export Financing.”
foreign Trade Zones
Most countries promote trade with other nations by creating what is called a foreign trade zone 
(FTZ)—a designated geographic region through which merchandise is allowed to pass with 
lower customs duties (taxes) and/or fewer customs procedures. Increased employment is often 
the intended purpose of FTZs, with a by-product being increased trade. A good example of a 
foreign trade zone is Turkey’s Aegean Free Zone, in which the Turkish government allows com-
panies to conduct manufacturing operations free from taxes.
Customs duties increase the total amount of a good’s production cost and increase the time 
needed to get it to market. Companies can reduce such costs and time by establishing a facility 
inside an FTZ. A common purpose of many companies’ facilities in such zones is final product 
assembly. The U.S. department of Commerce (www.commerce.gov) administers dozens of 
FTZs within the United States. Many of these zones allow components to be imported at a dis-
count from the normal duty. once assembled, the finished product can be sold within the U.S. 
market with no further duties charged. State governments welcome such zones in order to obtain 
the jobs that the assembly operations create.

Several Ex-Im Bank (www.exim.gov) programs can help U.S. busi-
nesses expand abroad:
• City/State Program This program brings financing services 
to small and medium-sized U.S. companies that are ready to 
export. This program currently exists with 38 state and local 
government offices and private sector organizations.
• Working Capital Guarantee Program This program encour-
ages commercial banks to loan money to companies with 
 export potential. The guarantee covers 90 percent of the 
loan’s principal and accrued interest. The guaranteed financ-
ing can help purchase finished products for export or pay for 
raw materials, for example.
• Credit Information Services The Ex-Im Bank supplies credit 
information to U.S. exporters and commercial lenders. It pro-
vides information on a country or specific company abroad. But 
the bank does not divulge either confidential financial data on 
non–U.S. buyers to whom it has extended credit or confidential 
information on specific conditions in other countries.
• Credit Insurance This program helps U.S. exporters by 
protecting them against loss should a non–U.S. buyer or 
other non–U.S. debtor default for political or commercial 
reasons. The proceeds of the policy can be used as col-
lateral and therefore can make obtaining export financing 
easier.
• Guarantee Program This program provides repayment pro-
tection for private sector loans made to creditworthy buyers 
of U.S. capital equipment, projects, and services. The bank 
guarantees the principal and interest on the loan if the bor-
rower defaults. Most guarantees provide comprehensive cov-
erage against political and commercial risks.
• Loan Program The bank makes loans directly to non–U.S. 
buyers of U.S. exports and intermediary loans to creditworthy 
parties that provide loans to non–U.S. buyers. The program 
provides fixed-interest-rate financing for export sales of U.S. 
capital equipment and related services.

China has established a number of large FTZs in order to reap the employment advantages 
they offer. Goods imported into these zones do not require import licenses or other documents, 
nor are they subject to import duties. International companies can also store goods in these zones 
before shipping them to other countries without incurring taxes in China. Moreover, five of these 
zones are located within specially designated economic zones in which local governments can 
offer additional opportunities and tax breaks to international investors.
Another country that has enjoyed the beneficial effects of FTZs is Mexico. decades ago, 
Mexico established such a zone along its northern border with the United States. Creation of the 
zone caused development of companies called maquiladoras along the border inside Mexico. 
The maquiladoras import materials or parts from the United States duty free, process them to 
some extent, and export them back to the United States, which charges duties only on the value 
added to the product in Mexico. The program has expanded rapidly over the five decades since 
its inception, employing hundreds of thousands of people from all across Mexico who move 
north looking for work.
Special Government Agencies
learning the government regulations of other countries can be a daunting task. A company must 
know whether its product is subject to a tariff or quota, for example. Governments of most na-
tions, therefore, have special agencies responsible for promoting exports. Such agencies can be 
particularly helpful to small and medium-sized businesses that have limited financial resources.
Government trade-promotion agencies often organize trips for trade officials and business-
people to visit other countries in order to meet potential business partners and generate contacts 
for new business. They also typically open trade offices in other countries. These offices are 
designed to promote the home country’s exports and introduce businesses to potential partners 
in the host nation. Government trade-promotion agencies typically do a great deal of advertis-
ing in other countries promoting the nation’s exports. For example, Chile’s Trade Commission, 
ProChile, has commercial offices in 40 countries and a website (www.chileinfo.com).
Governments not only promote trade by encouraging exports but also encourage imports 
that the nation does not or cannot produce. For example, the Japan External Trade organization 
(JETRo; www.jetro.go.jp) is a trade-promotion agency of the Japanese government. The agency 
coaches small and medium-sized overseas businesses on the protocols of Japanese deal making, 
arranges meetings with suitable Japanese distributors and partners, and even assists in finding 
temporary office spaces.

Instruments of Trade Restriction
Earlier in this chapter, we read about the political, economic, and cultural reasons for govern-
mental intervention in trade. In this section, we discuss the methods governments can use to 
restrict unwanted trade. There are two general categories of trade barriers available to govern-
ments: tariffs and nontariff barriers. A tariff is a government tax levied on a product as it enters 
or leaves a country. A tariff increases the price of an imported product directly and, therefore, 
reduces its appeal to buyers. A nontariff barrier limits the availability of an imported product, 
which increases its price indirectly and, therefore, reduces its appeal to buyers. let’s take a 
closer look at tariffs and the various types of nontariff barriers.
Tariffs
we can classify a tariff into one of three categories. An export tariff is levied by the government 
of a country that is exporting a product. Countries can use export tariffs when they believe an ex-
port’s price is lower than it should be. developing nations whose exports consist mostly of low-
priced natural resources often levy export tariffs. A transit tariff is levied by the government of

part 3 • international trade and investment
a country that a product is passing through on its way to its final destination. Transit tariffs have 
been almost entirely eliminated worldwide through international trade agreements. An import 
tariff is levied by the government of a country that is importing a product. The import tariff is by 
far the most common tariff used by governments today.
we can further break down the import tariff into three subcategories based on the manner 
in which it is calculated. An ad valorem tariff is levied as a percentage of the stated price of an 
imported product. A specific tariff is levied as a specific fee for each unit (measured by number, 
weight, etc.) of an imported product. A compound tariff is levied on an imported product and 
calculated partly as a percentage of its stated price and partly as a specific fee for each unit. let’s 
now discuss the two main reasons why countries levy tariffs.
PrOTeCT dOMeSTiC PrOduCerS Nations can use tariffs to protect domestic producers. 
For example, an import tariff raises the cost of an imported good and increases the appeal of 
domestically produced goods. In this way, domestic producers gain a protective barrier against 
imports. Although producers that receive tariff protection can gain a price advantage, in the long 
run protection can keep them from increasing efficiency. A protected industry can be devastated 
if protection encourages complacency and inefficiency and it is later thrown into the lion’s den 
of international competition. Mexico began reducing tariff protection in the mid-1980s as a 
prelude to NAFTA negotiations, and many Mexican producers went bankrupt despite attempts to 
grow more efficient.
GeNerATe reveNue Tariffs are also a source of government revenue, but mostly among 
developing nations. The main reason is that less-developed nations tend to have less-formal 
domestic economies that lack the capability to record domestic transactions accurately. The lack 
of accurate record keeping makes collection of sales taxes within the country extremely difficult. 
Nations solve the problem by simply raising their needed revenue through import and export 
tariffs. As countries develop, however, they tend to generate a greater portion of their revenues 
from taxes on income, capital gains, and other economic activity.
The discussion so far leads us to question who benefits from tariffs. we’ve already learned 
the two principal reasons for tariff barriers—protecting domestic producers and raising govern-
ment revenue. on the surface, it appears that governments and domestic producers benefit. we 
also saw that tariffs raise the price of a product because importers typically charge a higher 
price to recover the cost of this additional tax. Thus, it appears on the surface that consumers do 
not benefit. As we also mentioned earlier, there is the danger that tariffs will create inefficient 
domestic producers that may go out of business once protective import tariffs are removed. 
Analysis of the total cost to a country is far more complicated and goes beyond the scope of our 
discussion. Suffice it to say that tariffs tend to exact a cost on countries as a whole because they 
lessen the gains that a nation’s people obtain from trade.
Quotas
A restriction on the amount (measured in units or weight) of a good that can enter or leave a 
country during a certain period of time is called a quota. After tariffs, quotas are the second 
most common type of trade barrier. Governments typically administer their quota systems by 
granting quota licenses to the companies or governments of other nations (in the case of import 
quotas) and domestic producers (in the case of export quotas). Governments normally grant such 
licenses on a year-by-year basis.
reASON fOr iMPOrT QuOTAS A government may impose an import quota to protect its 
domestic producers by placing a limit on the amount of goods allowed to enter the country. This 
helps domestic producers maintain their market shares and prices because competitive forces are 
restrained. In this case, domestic producers win because their market is protected. Consumers 
lose because of higher prices and limited selection attributable to lower competition. other 
losers include domestic producers whose own production requires the import subjected to a 
quota. Companies relying on the importation of so-called intermediate goods will find the final 
cost of their own products increase.
Historically, countries placed import quotas on the textile and apparel products of other 
countries under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement. This arrangement at one time affected coun-
tries accounting for more than 80 percent of world trade in textiles and clothing. when that

arrangement expired in 2005, many textile producers in poor nations feared the loss of jobs to 
China. But some countries with a large textile industry, such as Bangladesh, are benefiting from 
cheap labor and the reluctance among purchasers to rely exclusively on China for all supplies.
reASONS fOr exPOrT QuOTAS There are at least two reasons why a country imposes export 
quotas on its domestic producers. First, it may wish to maintain adequate supplies of a product 
in the home market. This motive is most common among countries that export natural resources 
that are essential to domestic business or the long-term survival of a nation.
Second, a country may limit the export of a good in order to restrict its supply on world 
markets, thereby increasing the international price of the good. This is the motive behind the 
formation and activities of the organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (oPEC; www.
opec.org). This group of nations from the Middle East and latin America attempts to restrict the 
world’s supply of crude oil in order to earn greater profits.
voluntary export restraints A unique version of the export quota is called a voluntary export 
restraint (VER)—a quota that a nation imposes on its own exports, usually at the request 
of another nation. Countries normally self-impose a voluntary export restraint in response to 
the threat of an import quota or a total ban on the product by an importing nation. The classic 
example of the use of a voluntary export restraint is from the 1980s when Japanese carmakers 
were making significant market-share gains in the United States. The closing of U.S. carmakers’ 
production facilities in the United States was creating a volatile anti-Japan sentiment among 
the population and the U.S. Congress. Fearing punitive legislation if Japan did not limit its 
automobile exports to the United States, the Japanese government and its carmakers self-
imposed a voluntary export restraint on cars headed for the United States.
Consumers in the country that imposes an export quota benefit from lower-priced products 
(due to their greater supply) as long as domestic producers do not curtail production. Producers 
in an importing country benefit because the goods of producers from the exporting country 
are restrained, which may allow them to increase prices. Export quotas hurt consumers in the 
importing nation because of reduced selection and perhaps higher prices. yet export quotas 
might allow these same consumers to retain their jobs if imports were threatening to put domes-
tic producers out of business. Again, detailed economic studies are needed to determine the win-
ners and losers in any particular export quota case.
TAriff-QuOTAS A hybrid form of trade restriction is called a tariff-quota—a lower tariff 
rate for a certain quantity of imports and a higher rate for quantities that exceed the quota.

Imports entering a nation under a quota limit of, say, 1,000 tons are charged a 10-percent tariff. 
But subsequent imports that do not make it under the quota limit of 1,000 tons are charged a 
tariff of 80 percent. Figure 6.1 shows how a tariff-quota actually works. Tariff-quotas are used 
extensively in the trade of agricultural products. Many countries implemented tariff-quotas in 
1995 after their use was permitted by the world Trade organization, the agency that regulates 
trade among nations.
embargoes
A complete ban on trade (imports and exports) in one or more products with a particular country 
is called an embargo. An embargo may be placed on one or a few goods, or it may completely 
ban trade in all goods. It is the most restrictive nontariff trade barrier available, and it is typically 
applied to accomplish political goals. Embargoes can be decreed by individual nations or by 
supranational organizations such as the United Nations. Because they can be very difficult to en-
force, embargoes are used less today than they have been in the past. one example of a total ban 
on trade with another country is the U.S. embargo on trade with Cuba, although some medicines 
and foods from the United States are now allowed to enter Cuba.
After a military coup ousted elected President Aristide of Haiti in the early 1990s, restraints 
were applied to force the military junta either to reinstate Aristide or to hold new elections. one 
restraint was an embargo by the organization of American States. Because of difficulties in 
actually enforcing the embargo and after two years of fruitless United Nations diplomacy, the 
embargo failed. The United Nations then stepped in with a ban on trade in oil and weapons. 
despite some smuggling through the dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola 
with Haiti, the embargo was generally effective and Aristide was eventually reinstated.
Local Content requirements
Recall from Chapter 4 that local content requirements are laws stipulating that producers in the 
domestic market must supply a specified amount of a good or service. These requirements can 
state that a certain portion of the end product must consist of domestically produced goods or 
that a certain portion of the final cost of a product must come from domestic sources.
The purpose of local content requirements is to force companies from other nations to use 
local resources in their production processes—particularly labor. Similar to other restraints on 
imports, such requirements help protect domestic producers from the price advantage of com-
panies based in other, low-wage countries. Today, many developing countries use local content 
requirements as a strategy to boost industrialization. Companies often respond to local content 
requirements by locating production facilities inside the nation that stipulates such restrictions.
For example, although many people consider music to be the universal language, not all cultures 
are equally open to the world’s diverse musical influences. To prevent Anglo-Saxon music from 
invading French culture, French law requires radio programs to include at least 40-percent French 
content. Such local content requirements are intended to protect both the French cultural identity and 
the jobs of French artists against other nations’ pop culture that may wash up on French shores.

Administrative delays
Regulatory controls or bureaucratic rules designed to impair the flow of imports into a country 
are called administrative delays. This nontariff barrier includes a wide range of government ac-
tions, such as requiring international air carriers to land at inconvenient airports, requiring prod-
uct inspections that damage the product itself, purposely understaffing customs offices to cause 
unusual time delays, and requiring special licenses that take a long time to obtain. The objective 
of all such administrative delays for a country is to discriminate against imported products—it 
is, in a word, protectionism.
Currency Controls
Restrictions on the convertibility of a currency into other currencies are called currency 
 controls. A company that wishes to import goods generally must pay for those goods in a 
common, internationally acceptable currency such as the U.S. dollar, European Union euro, or 
Japanese yen. Generally, it must also obtain the currency from its nation’s domestic banking 
system. Governments can require companies that desire such a currency to apply for a license to 
obtain it. Thus, a country’s government can discourage imports by restricting who is allowed to 
convert the nation’s currency into the internationally acceptable currency.
Another way governments apply currency controls to reduce imports is by stipulating an 
exchange rate that is unfavorable to potential importers. Because the unfavorable exchange rate 
can force the cost of imported goods to an impractical level, many potential importers simply 
give up on the idea. Meanwhile, the country will often allow exporters to exchange the home 
currency for an international currency at favorable rates to encourage exports.

Global Trading System
The global trading system certainly has seen its ups and downs. world trade volume reached a 
peak in the late 1800s, only to be devastated when the United States passed the Smoot–Hawley 
Act in 1930. The act represented a major shift in U.S. trade policy from one of free trade to one 
of protectionism. The act set off round after round of competitive tariff increases among the ma-
jor trading nations. other nations felt that, if the United States was going to restrict its imports, 
they were not going to give exports from the United States free access to their domestic mar-
kets. The Smoot–Hawley Act, and the global trade wars that it helped to usher in, crippled the 
economies of the industrialized nations and helped spark the Great depression. living standards 
around the world were devastated throughout most of the 1930s.
we begin this section by looking at early attempts to develop a global trading system—the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade—and then examine its successor, the World Trade 
Organization.

General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
Attitudes toward free trade changed markedly in the late 1940s. For the previous 50 years, 
extreme economic competition among nations and national quests to increase their resources 
for production helped create two world wars and the worst global economic recession ever. As 
a result, economists and policy makers proposed that the world band together and agree on a 
trading system that would help to avoid similar calamities in the future. A system of multilateral 
agreements was developed that became known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT)—a treaty designed to promote free trade by reducing both tariff and nontariff barriers to 
international trade. The GATT was formed in 1947 by 23 nations—12 developed and 11 devel-
oping economies—and came into force in January 1948.11
The GATT was highly successful throughout its early years. Between 1947 and 1988, it 
helped to reduce average tariffs from 40 percent to 5 percent and to multiply the volume of 
international trade by a factor of 20. But by the middle to late 1980s, rising nationalism world-
wide and trade conflicts led to a nearly 50 percent increase in nontariff barriers to trade. Also, 
services (not covered by the original GATT) had become increasingly important and had grown 
to account for a much greater share of total world trade. It was clear that a revision of the treaty 
was necessary, and in 1986 a new round of trade talks began.
uruGuAy rOuNd Of NeGOTiATiONS The ground rules of the GATT resulted from periodic 
“rounds” of negotiations among its members. Though relatively short and straightforward in the 
early years, negotiations later became protracted as issues grew more complex. Table 6.2 shows 
the eight completed negotiating rounds that occurred under the auspices of the GATT. Note that 
whereas tariffs were the only topic of the first five rounds of negotiations, other topics were 
added in subsequent rounds.
The Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations, begun in 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay 
(hence its name), was the largest trade negotiation in history. It was the eighth round of GATT 
talks within a span of 40 years and took more than 7 years to complete. The Uruguay Round 
made significant progress in reducing trade barriers by revising and updating the 1947 GATT. 
In addition to developing plans to further reduce barriers to merchandise trade, the negotiations 
modified the original GATT treaty in several important ways.
Agreement on Services Because of the ever-increasing importance of services to the total 
volume of world trade, nations wanted to include GATT provisions for trade in services. The 
General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) extended the principle of nondiscrimination 
to cover international trade in all services, although talks regarding some sectors were more 
successful than were others. The problem is that, although trade in goods is a straightforward 
concept—goods are exported from one country and imported to another—defining exactly

what a service is can be difficult. Nevertheless, the GATS created during the Uruguay Round 
identifies four different forms that international trade in services can take:
 1. Cross-border supply: Services supplied from one country to another (for example, inter-
national telephone calls).
 2. Consumption abroad: Consumers or companies using a service while in another country 
(for example, tourism).
 3. Commercial presence: A company establishing a subsidiary in another country in order 
to provide a service (for example, banking operations).
 4. Presence of natural persons: Individuals traveling to another country in order to supply 
a service (for example, business consultants).
Agreement on intellectual Property like services, products consisting entirely or largely of 
intellectual property are accounting for an increasing portion of international trade. Recall from 
Chapter 3 that intellectual property refers to property resulting from people’s intellectual talent 
and abilities. Products classified as intellectual property are supposed to be legally protected by 
copyrights, patents, and trademarks.
Although international piracy continues, the Uruguay Round took an important step toward 
getting it under control. It created the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property (TRIPS) to help standardize intellectual property rules around the world. The TRIPS 
Agreement acknowledges that protection of intellectual property rights benefits society because 
it encourages the development of new technologies and other creations. It supports the articles 
of both the Paris Convention and the Berne Convention (see Chapter 3) and in certain instances 
takes a stronger stand on intellectual property protection.
Agreement on Agricultural Subsidies Trade in agricultural products has been a bone of 
contention for most of the world’s trading partners at one time or another. Some of the more 
popular barriers that countries use to protect their agricultural sectors include import quotas and 
subsidies paid directly to farmers. The Uruguay Round addressed the main issues of agricultural 
tariffs and nontariff barriers in its Agreement on Agriculture. The result is increased exposure 
of national agricultural sectors to market forces and increased predictability in international 
agricultural trade. The agreement forces countries to convert all nontariff barriers to tariffs—a 
process called “tariffication.” It then calls on developed and developing nations to cut 
agricultural tariffs significantly, but it places no requirements on the least-developed economies.
world Trade Organization (wTO)
Perhaps the greatest achievement of the Uruguay Round was the creation of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO)—the international organization that regulates trade among nations. The 
three main goals of the wTo (www.wto.org) are to help the free flow of trade, to help negotiate 
further opening of markets, and to settle trade disputes among its members. one key component 
of the wTo that was carried over from the GATT is the principle of nondiscrimination called 
normal trade relations (formerly called “most favored nation status”)—a requirement that 
wTo members extend the same favorable terms of trade to all members that they extend to any 
single member. For example, if Japan were to reduce its import tariff on German automobiles to 
5 percent, it must reduce the tariff it levies against automobile imports from all other wTo na-
tions to 5 percent.
The wTo replaced the institution of the GATT but absorbed the GATT agreements (such 
as on services, intellectual property, and agriculture) into its own agreements. Thus, the GATT 
institution no longer officially exists. The wTo recognizes 160 members and 24 observers.
diSPuTe SeTTLeMeNT iN The wTO The power of the wTo to settle trade disputes is what 
really sets it apart from the GATT. Under the GATT, nations could file a complaint against 
another member and a committee would investigate the matter. If appropriate, the GATT would 
identify the unfair trade practices, and member countries would pressure the offender to change 
its ways. But in reality most nations simply ignored GATT rulings, which were usually made 
only after very long investigative phases that sometimes lasted years.
By contrast, the various wTo agreements are essentially contracts between member 
nations that commit them to maintaining fair and open trade policies. when one wTo member

files a complaint against another, the dispute Settlement Body of the wTo moves into action. 
decisions are to be rendered in less than one year—although within nine months if the case is 
urgent and 15 months if the case is appealed. The wTo dispute settlement system is not only 
faster and automatic, but its rulings cannot be ignored or blocked by members. offenders must 
realign their trade policies according to wTo guidelines or suffer financial penalties and per-
haps trade sanctions. Because of its ability to penalize offending member nations, the wTo’s 
dispute settlement system is the spine of the global trading system.
duMPiNG ANd The wTO The wTo also gets involved in settling disputes that involve 
“dumping” and the granting of subsidies. when a company exports a product at a price that 
is either lower than the price normally charged in its domestic market or lower than the cost 
of production, it is said to be dumping. Charges of dumping are made (fairly or otherwise) 
against companies from almost every nation at one time or another and can occur in any type of 
industry. For example, western European plastic producers considered retaliating against Asian 
competitors whose prices were substantially lower in European markets than at home. More 
recently, U.S. steel producers and their powerful union charged that steelmakers in Brazil, 
Japan, and Russia were dumping steel on the U.S. market at low prices. The problem arose 
as those nations tried to improve their economies through increased exporting of all products, 
including steel.
The wTo cannot punish the country in which the company accused of dumping is based 
because dumping is an act by a company, not a country. The wTo can respond only to the 
actions of a country that retaliates against a company that is dumping. The wTo allows a nation 
to retaliate against dumping if it can show that dumping is actually occurring, can calculate the 
damage to its own companies, and can show that the damage is significant. The normal way a 
country retaliates is to charge an antidumping duty—an additional tariff placed on an imported 
product that a nation believes is being dumped on its market. But such measures must expire 
within five years of the time they are initiated unless a country can show that circumstances war-
rant their continuation. A large number of antidumping cases have been brought before the wTo 
in recent years.
SuBSidieS ANd The wTO Governments often retaliate when the competitiveness of their 
companies is threatened by a subsidy that another country pays its own domestic producers. 
like antidumping measures, nations can retaliate against product(s) that receive an unfair 
subsidy by charging a countervailing duty—an additional tariff placed on an imported product 
that a nation believes is receiving an unfair subsidy. Unlike dumping, because payment of a 
subsidy is an action by a country, the wTo regulates the actions of the government that reacts to 
the subsidy as well as those of the government that originally paid the subsidy.
dOhA rOuNd Of NeGOTiATiONS The wTo launched a new round of negotiations in doha, 
Qatar, in late 2001. The renewed negotiations were designed to lower trade barriers further 
and to help poor nations in particular. Agricultural subsidies that rich countries pay to their 
own farmers are worth $1 billion per day—more than six times the value of their combined 
aid budgets to poor nations. Because 70 percent of the exports of poor nations are agricultural 
products and textiles, wealthy nations had intended to open these and other labor-intensive 
industries further. Poor nations were encouraged to reduce tariffs among themselves and were to 
receive help from rich nations in integrating themselves into the global trading system.
Although the doha round was to conclude by the end of 2004, negotiations continue to limp 
along. In december of 2013 negotiators agreed to improve “trade facilitation” by reducing red 
tape at borders and setting standards for customs and the movement of goods internationally. 
The rather modest agreement marks the first significant achievement for the doha round. Still, 
no agreement was reached on agricultural trade issues, tariffs, or quotas.12
wTO ANd The eNvirONMeNT Steady gains in global trade and rapid industrialization in 
many developing and emerging economies have generated environmental concerns among 
both governments and special interest groups. of concern to many people are levels of 
carbon dioxide emissions—the principal greenhouse gas believed to contribute to global 
warming. Most carbon dioxide emissions are created from the burning of fossil fuels and the 
manufacture of cement.

Chapter 6 • politiCal eConomy of trade   201
The wTo has no separate agreement that deals with environmental issues. The wTo 
explicitly states that it is not to become a global environmental agency responsible for setting 
environmental standards. It leaves such tasks to national governments and the many intergovern-
mental organizations that already exist for such purposes. The wTo works alongside existing 
international agreements on the environment, including the Montreal Protocol for protection of 
the ozone layer, the Basel Convention on international trade or transport of hazardous waste, and 
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
Nevertheless, the preamble to the agreement that established the wTo does mention the 
objectives of environmental protection and sustainable development. The wTo also has an 
internal committee called the Committee on Trade and Environment. The committee’s responsi-
bility is to study the relationship between trade and the environment and to recommend possible 
changes in the wTo trade agreements.
In addition, the wTo does take explicit positions on some environmental issues related 
to trade. Although the wTo supports national efforts at labeling “environmentally friendly” 
 products as such, it states that labeling requirements or policies cannot discriminate against 
the products of other wTo members. Also, the wTo supports policies of the least developed 
countries that require full disclosure of potentially hazardous products entering their markets for 
reasons of public health and environmental damage.

espite the theoretical benefits of free trade, nations do not 
simply throw open their doors to trade and force their domes-
tic businesses to sink or swim. This chapter explained why govern-
ments protect their industries and how they go about it. The WTO 
tries to strike a balance between national desires for protection 
and international desires for free trade.
implications of Trade Protection
Free trade allows firms to move production to locations that maxi-
mize efficiency. Yet, government interference in the free flow of 
trade has implications for production efficiency and firm strategy. 
Subsidies often encourage complacency on the part of companies 
receiving them because they discourage competition. Subsidies 
can be thought of as a redistribution of wealth in society whereby 
international firms not receiving subsidies are at a disadvantage. 
Unsubsidized firms either must cut production and distribution 
costs or must differentiate in some way to justify a higher selling 
price.
Import tariffs raise the cost of an imported good and make 
domestically produced goods more attractive to consumers. But 
because a tariff can create inefficient domestic producers, dete-
riorating competitiveness may offset the benefits of import tariffs. 
Companies trying to enter markets having high import tariffs often 
produce within that market. Import quotas help domestic produc-
ers maintain market share and prices by restraining competitive 
forces. Domestic producers protected by the quota win because 
the market is protected. Other producers that require the import 
subjected to a quota lose because they will need to pay more for 
their intermediate products or locate production outside the mar-
ket imposing the quota.
Local content requirements protect domestic producers from 
producers based in low-cost countries. A firm trying to sell to a 
market imposing local content requirements may have no alterna-
tive but to produce locally. The objective of administrative delays 
is to discriminate against imported products, but it can discourage 
efficiency. Currency controls can require firms to apply for a license

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Explain why governments sometimes intervene in trade.
• Political reasons for trade intervention include to: (a) protect jobs, (b) preserve na-
tional security, (c) respond to other nations’ unfair trade practices, and (d) gain influ-
ence over other nations.
• Economic reasons include to: (a) protect infant industries from global competition 
until they are sufficiently competitive, and (b) promote a strategic trade policy in 
which companies are assisted in taking advantage of economies of scale and being 
first movers in their industries.
• The most common cultural reason for trade intervention is protection of national 
identity. Unwanted cultural influence in a nation can cause great distress and force a 
government to block imports that it believes are harmful.
 LO2. outline the instruments that governments use to promote trade.
• A subsidy is financial assistance to domestic producers in the form of cash pay-
ments, low-interest loans, tax breaks, product price supports, and other forms. 
Subsidies can fend off international competitors, although critics say they amount to 
corporate welfare.
• Export financing includes loans at below-market interest rates, loans that are other-
wise unavailable, and loan guarantees that a government will repay a loan if a firm 
defaults.
• A foreign trade zone (FTZ) allows merchandise to pass through a geographic region 
with lower customs duties (taxes) and/or fewer customs procedures.
• Special government agencies organize international trips for trade officials and busi-
nesspeople and create offices abroad to promote home country exports.
to obtain an internationally accepted currency. The nation thus 
discourages imports by restricting who is allowed to obtain such a 
currency to pay for imports. A government may also block imports 
by stipulating an exchange rate that is unfavorable to potential 
importers. The unfavorable exchange rate forces the cost of im-
ported goods to an impractical level. The same country then often 
stipulates an exchange rate that is favorable for exporters.
Government subsidies are typically paid for by levying taxes 
across the economy. Whether subsidies help a nation’s people 
long term is questionable, and they may actually harm a nation. 
Import tariffs also hurt consumers because they raise the price of 
imports and protect domestic firms that may raise prices. Import 
quotas hurt consumers because they lessen competition, boost 
prices, and decrease selection. Protection tends to lessen the 
long-term gains a people can obtain from free trade.
implications of the Global Trading System
Development of the global trading system benefits international 
companies by promoting free trade through the reduction of 
both tariffs and nontariff barriers to international trade. The GATT 
treaty was successful in its early years, and its revision significantly 
improved the climate for trade. Average tariffs on merchandise 
trade were reduced and subsidies for agricultural products were 
lowered. Firms also benefited from an agreement that extended 
the principle of nondiscrimination to cover trade in services. The 
revision of the GATT also clearly defined intellectual property 
rights—giving protection to copyrights, trademarks and service 
marks, and patents. This encourages firms to develop new prod-
ucts and processes because they know their rights to the property 
will be protected.
Creation of the WTO is also good for international firms be-
cause the various WTO agreements commit member nations to 
maintaining fair and open trade policies. Both domestic and inter-
national firms based in relatively poor nations should benefit most 
from future rounds of trade negotiations. Firms from poor nations 
that export agricultural products and textiles will benefit if wealthy 
nations reduce barriers to imports in these sectors. Companies 
based in poor countries should also benefit from better coop-
eration among poor countries and their further integration into the 
global trading system.

 
Chapter 6 • politiCal eConomy of trade   203
 LO3. describe the instruments that governments use to restrict trade.
• A tariff is a government tax levied on a product that enters, transits across, or leaves a 
country. An import tariff can be an ad valorem tariff, a specific tariff, or a compound 
tariff.
• Quotas restrict the amount of a good that can enter or leave a country during a cer-
tain period of time. Import quotas protect domestic producers. Export quotas main-
tain adequate supplies domestically or raise the global price of a product.
• An embargo completely bans trade with a country. Local content requirements stipu-
late that a good or service be supplied by domestic producers. Imports can also be 
discouraged with administrative delays or currency controls (restrictions on currency 
convertibility).
 LO4. Summarize the main features of the global trading system.
• The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) treaty promoted free trade by 
reducing tariff and nontariff barriers. The Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations (a) 
covered trade in services, (b) defined intellectual property rights, (c) reduced trade 
barriers in agriculture, and (d) created the World Trade Organization (WTO).
• The three goals of the WTO are to help the free flow of trade, to help negotiate fur-
ther opening of markets, and to settle trade disputes among its members.
• A key component of the WTO is the principle of nondiscrimination, called normal 
trade relations, which requires wTo members to treat all members equally.
• Dumping is said to occur if a company exports a product at a price either lower 
than the price it normally charges in its domestic market or lower than the cost of 
production.

Chapter 6 • politiCal eConomy of trade   205
The New Protectionism
E
conomic crisis is well known in the literature for provoking 
a renewal of aggressive measures in international trade, and 
sometimes (as in the Great depression of 1929) even for provok-
ing commercial wars. Amidst the global economic and financial 
crisis that began in 2008, many feared that one of its main conse-
quences would have been the breaking down of the wTo rules and 
even the start of trade wars among some of the countries worse hit 
by the crisis. However, things have turned out to be more compli-
cated than that.
Although the economic slowdown and rising levels of unem-
ployment in many countries have actually led several governments 
to try to protect some sectors with a wide array of protectionist 
measures, they have done it in an unexpected way. This resurgent 
protectionism, also labeled “creeping” or “murky protectionism,” 
is characterized by a number of factors, the first being funda-
mentally different from the one experienced during the Great 
depression. This is because, with very few exceptions, the protec-
tive measures now introduced are not in violation of agreements 
taken multilaterally in the wTo; therefore, some countries may 
double or even triple duties imports without incurring penalties, 
given that the threshold negotiated under the wTo framework is 
much higher than what is normally imposed.
Another important difference from 1929, and the effect of the 
recession on international trade, is the greater prevalence of verti-
cal trade, or trade between countries, which creates a chain of pro-
duction across various borders. The existence of these close links 
in the cycle of production of many countries means that those with 
greater openness cannot increase duties indiscriminately without 
damaging domestic companies. Vertical trade and reduction in 
countries’ demand could be one reason for the severity and speed 
of international decline in trade flows and perhaps also the moti-
vation that has most helped to keep protectionist pressures under 
control. once the value chain crumbles, as it could certainly hap-
pen in the event of renewed difficulties to export, recreating the 
links and the infrastructure would be expensive and would risk 
slowing down further the global recovery.
Between october 2008 and February 2009, 78 procedures 
were initiated, including 66 measures restrictive to trade, of which 
47 actually entered into force. only one-third of these measures 
were actually related to increased tariffs, in some cases taking the 
form of nontariff restrictions such as export bans. These measures 
can be characterized as follows:
 1. Import duty (imposition of new ones or increasing existing 
ones) imposed on a wide range of products. However, this tra-
ditional instrument has been used in only a minority of cases, 
whereas others were far more common.
 2. Import ban. This is the kind of measure that so far has hit 
emerging countries—China, for instance—more seriously. A 
good example is represented by the six-month ban imposed 
by the Indian government in January 2009 on Chinese toys, 
causing protests not only by Chinese exporters, but even by 
the domestic Indian industry, due to the huge increase in retail 
prices that this measure provoked.
 3. Nontariff barriers. This kind of measure has generally been 
fairly popular, and is now applied extensively, by such coun-
tries as Argentina and Indonesia.
 4. Subsidies to industries in crisis. Subsidies have been granted 
virtually everywhere, although the details and the areas con-
cerned have been very different among countries. Some exam-
ples are the EU subsidies on food products, including butter, 
cheese, and milk powder, and increased tax rebates on exports 
from China and India. China in 2008 and 2009 revised upward 
seven times tax rebates on more than 2,600 products.
 5. Increase in antidumping procedures. The crisis is evident 
when considering the antidumping procedures submitted to 
the wTo. According to wTo data, there were a total of 208 
antidumping procedures in the year 2008 alone, an increase 
of 31 percent compared with 2007. data in 2009 and 2010 
showed the same, worrying upward trend.
Although not all the procedures started have actually led to the 
imposition of duties, what seems obvious is the need for a multi-
lateral review and for the establishment of more binding and strict 
rules, without which it is likely that their use will become more 
generalized. The real danger here is that a mechanism created to 
stop exceptional cases of unfair competition is instead used as 
weapons of trade policy and retaliation.
Thinking Globally
 6-19. one of the dangers of the new protectionism is its impact 
on the vertical integration of companies and its effects on 
the global supply chain. Can you figure out the economic 
impact of the new protectionism on global corporations, 
such as Apple, which manufactures its components in a 
series of different countries and then assembles them in a 
unique product? How can high tariff barriers change this 
system?
 6-20. The wTo website publishes updated figures about anti-
dumping procedures every six months. which countries are 
more exposed to antidumping procedures being brought 
against them? why, in your opinion?
 6-21. Important, comparatively recent features of protectionism 
measures are the so-called voluntary restrictive measures, 
in which a country agrees to limit its exports voluntarily. 
In which way are these measures different from the older, 
more traditional ones?

Das Auto
FRANKFURT, Germany—The Volkswagen Group (www.vw.com) owns 10 of the most 
prestigious and best-known automotive brands in the world, including Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, 
Lamborghini, Porsche, and Volkswagen. From its 48 production facilities worldwide, the 
company produces and sells around eight million cars annually to more than 150 countries. 
Volkswagen is the top-selling manufacturer in South America and China. It has been active 
in China since 1985 and the country 
accounts for around 30 percent of VW’s 
total sales. Volkswagen is building four 
new assembly plants in China, one being 
the first ever automobile plant in western 
China. Shown here is a worker on an 
assembly line at a Volkswagen plant in 
China.
Volkswagen also has ambitious 
goals for its U.S. expansion. It is adapt-
ing designs to domestic tastes, cutting 
prices, and adding inexpensive produc-
tion capacity. The company employs 
more than 2,000 people at its state-of-
the-art assembly plant in Chattanooga, 
Tennessee. Volkswagen pays wages 
and benefits at the plant equal to $27 
an hour, whereas Japanese auto- makers 
in the United States pay $50 an hour 
and General Motors pays around $60 
an hour. The company uses a modu-
lar strategy in production that lets it 
use the same key components in 16 different vehicles and seven million units across 
its brands. The strategy should shave $500 off the cost of each car by cutting product 
development and parts costs by 20 percent and reducing production time by 30 percent.
Volkswagen, like companies everywhere, received plenty of help in getting where it 
is today. Until recently, Volkswagen received special protection from its own legislation 
known as the VW Law. The law gave the German state of Lower Saxony, which owns 
20.1 percent of Volkswagen, the power to block any takeover attempt that threatened lo-
cal jobs and the economy. Volkswagen’s special treatment lies in the close ties between 
government and management in Germany and its importance to the nation’s economy, 
where it employs tens of thousands of people. As you read this chapter, consider all the 
issues that affect the foreign investment decisions of companies.1

part 3 • international traDe anD investment
Many early trade theories were created at a time when most production factors (such as labor, 
financial capital, capital equipment, and land or natural resources) either could not be moved or 
could not be moved easily across national borders. But today, all those production factors except 
land are internationally mobile and flow across borders to wherever they are needed. Financial 
capital is readily available from international financial institutions to finance corporate expan-
sion, and whole factories can be picked up and moved to another country. Even labor is more 
mobile than in years past, although many barriers restrict the complete mobility of labor.
International flows of capital are at the core of foreign direct investment (FDI)—the 
purchase of physical assets or a significant amount of the ownership (stock) of a company in an-
other country in order to gain a measure of management control. But there is wide disagreement 
on what exactly constitutes FDI. Nations set different thresholds at which they classify an inter-
national capital flow as FDI. The U.S. Commerce Department sets the threshold at 10 percent of 
stock ownership in a company abroad, but most other governments set it at anywhere from 10 
to 25 percent. By contrast, an investment that does not involve obtaining a degree of control in a 
company is called a portfolio investment.
In this chapter, we examine the importance of FDI to the operations of international compa-
nies. We begin by exploring the growth of FDI in recent years and investigating its sources and 
destinations. We then look at several theories that attempt to explain FDI flows. Next, we turn 
our attention to several important management issues that arise in most decisions about whether 
a company should undertake FDI. This chapter closes by discussing the reasons why govern-
ments encourage or restrict FDI and the methods they use to accomplish these goals.
Pattern of Foreign Direct Investment
Just as international trade displays a distinct pattern (see Chapter 5), so too does FDI. In this 
 section, we first look at the factors that have propelled growth in FDI over the past decade. We 
then turn our attention to the destinations and sources of FDI.
Ups and Downs of FDI
FDI inflows grew around 20 percent per year in the first half of the 1990s and expanded about 
40 percent per year in the second half of the decade. As shown in Figure 7.1, global FDI inflows 
averaged $548 billion annually between 1994 and 1999. FDI inflows peaked at around $1.4 tril-
lion in 2000 and then slowed. Strong economic performance and high corporate profits in many 
countries lifted FDI inflows in 2004, 2005, 2006, and reached an all-time record of more than 
$1.9 trillion in 2007.
Global financial crises and slower global economic growth meant declining FDI inflows in 
2008 and 2009. FDI inflows climbed again in 2010 and 2011 but then fell back to $1.35 trillion

in 2012 due to a fragile global economy and uncertain government policies. FDI inflows are 
expected to rise to $1.6 trillion in 2014 and $1.8 trillion in 2015 as the world emerges from 
recession. Significant uncertainty surrounds medium-term FDI flows, but the long-term trend 
points toward greater FDI inflows worldwide. The two main drivers of FDI flows are globaliza-
tion and international mergers and acquisitions.
GLOBALIzATIOn Recall from Chapter 6 that barriers to trade were not being reduced years ago, 
and new, creative barriers seemed to be popping up in many nations. This presented a problem 
for companies that were trying to export their products to markets around the world. A wave of 
FDI began as many companies entered promising markets to get around growing trade barriers. 
Then the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations created renewed determination to further reduce 
barriers to trade. As countries lowered their trade barriers, companies realized that they could 
now produce in the most efficient and productive locations and simply export to their markets 
worldwide. This set off another wave of FDI flows into low-cost emerging markets. The forces 
behind globalization are, therefore, part of the reason for long-term growth in FDI.
Increasing globalization is also causing a growing number of international companies from 
emerging markets to undertake FDI. For example, companies from Taiwan began investing 
heavily in other nations two decades ago. Acer (www.acer.com), headquartered in Singapore but 
founded in Taiwan, manufactures personal computers and computer components. Just 20 years 
after it opened for business, Acer had spawned 10 subsidiaries worldwide and had become an 
industry player in many emerging markets.
MerGerS AnD ACqUISITIOnS The number of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and their 
rising values over time also underlie long-term growth in FDI. In fact, cross-border M&As 
are the main vehicle through which companies undertake FDI. Companies based in developed 
nations have historically been the main participants behind cross-border M&As. Yet, firms from 
emerging markets are accounting for an ever greater share of global M&A activity. The value 
of cross-border M&As peaked in 2000 at around $1.2 trillion. This figure accounted for about 
3.7 percent of the market capitalization of all stock exchanges worldwide. Reasons previously 
mentioned for the ups and downs of FDI inflows also cause the pattern we see in cross-border 
M&A deals (see Figure 7.2). By 2007, the value of cross-border M&As rose to around $1 trillion. 
But M&A activity was significantly lower in 2008, 2009, and 2010 due to effects of the global 
financial crisis and global economic slowdown. By 2011, the value of cross-border M&A activity 
had climbed back to $526 billion but then fell back to around $300 billion in 2012.
Many cross-border M&A deals are driven by the desire of companies to:
• Get a foothold in a new geographic market.
• Increase a firm’s global competitiveness.
• Fill gaps in companies’ product lines in a global industry.
• Reduce costs of research and development, production, distribution, and so forth.
Entrepreneurs and small businesses also play a role in the expansion of FDI inflows. There 
is no data on the portion of FDI contributed by small businesses, but we know from anecdotal 
evidence that these companies are engaged in FDI. Unhindered by many of the constraints of a 
large company, entrepreneurs investing in other markets often demonstrate an inspiring can-do

spirit mixed with ingenuity and bravado. Another advantage individuals can possess is an under-
standing of the local language and culture of the market being entered. For a day-in-the-life look 
at a young entrepreneur who is realizing his dreams in China, see the Culture Matters feature, 
titled “The Cowboy of Manchuria.”
Worldwide Flows of FDI
Driving FDI growth are more than 100,000 multinational companies with more than 900,000 
affiliates abroad, roughly half of which are in developing countries.2 In 2012, for the first 
time ever, developing countries attracted greater FDI inflows than did developed countries. 
Developed countries account for 42 percent ($561 billion) of total global FDI inflows (more 
than $1.35 trillion in 2012). By comparison, FDI inflows to developing countries accounted 
for around 52 percent of world FDI inflows ($703 billion). The remaining roughly six percent 
of global FDI inflows went to countries across Southeast Europe in various stages of transition 
from communism to capitalism.
Among developed countries, European Union (EU) nations, the United States, and Japan 
account for the majority of world FDI inflows. Behind the large FDI figure for the EU is consoli-
dation among large national competitors and further efforts at EU regional integration.
Developing nations had varying experiences in 2012. FDI inflows to developing nations in Asia 
were $407 billion in 2012, with China attracting $121 billion of that total. India, the largest recipient 
on the Asian subcontinent, had inflows of nearly $26 billion. FDI flowing from developing nations 
in Asia is also on the rise, coinciding with the rise of these nations’ own global competitors.
Elsewhere, all of Africa drew in $50 billion of FDI in 2012, or about 4 percent of the world’s 
total. FDI flows into Latin America and the Caribbean $244 billion in 2012, or 18 percent of the 
total world FDI. Most of these inflows went to markets in South America with their growing 
economies, expanding consumer bases, and rich endowments of natural resources. FDI inflows to 
Southeast Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States reached $87 billion in 2012, or 
around 6.4 percent of the total world FDI.
QuIck Study 1
 1. The purchase of physical assets or significant ownership of a company abroad to gain a 
measure of management control is called a what?
 2. What are the main drivers of foreign direct investment flows?
 3. Why might a company engage in a cross-border merger or acquisition?
Tom Kirkwood turned his dream of introducing his grandfather’s 
taffy to China into a fast-growing business. Kirkwood’s story—his 
hassles and hustling—provides some lessons on the purest form 
of global investing. The basics that small investors in China can 
follow are as rudimentary as they get. Find a product that’s easy to 
make, widely popular, and cheap to sell, and then choose the least 
expensive, investor-friendliest place to make it.
Kirkwood, whose family runs the Shawnee Inn, a ski and golf 
resort in Shawnee-on-Delaware, Pennsylvania, decided to make 
candy in Manchuria—China’s gritty, heavily populated, industrial 
northeast. Chinese people often give individually wrapped candies 
as a gift, and Kirkwood reckoned that China’s rising, increasingly 
prosperous urbanites would have a lucrative sweet tooth. Kirkwood 
realized that he could not beat M&Ms or Reese’s Pieces at their own 
game. But he did not want to produce no-name candy to be sold 
in bulk bins at the grocery store, either. He wanted to find a niche 
and own it, because a niche in China can be worth an entire market 
in another country.
Kirkwood concluded early on that he wanted to do business 
in China. In the mid-1980s after prep school, he spent a year in 
Taiwan and China learning Chinese and working in a Shanghai en-
gineering company. The experience gave him a taste for adventure 
capitalism on the frontier of China’s economic development. Using 
$400,000 of Kirkwood’s family money, Kirkwood and his friend Peter 
Moustakerski bought equipment and rented a factory in Shenyang, 
a city of six million people in the heart of Manchuria. Roads and rail 
transport were convenient, and wages were low. The local govern-
ment seemed amenable to a 100 percent foreign-owned factory, 
and the Shenyang Shawnee Cowboy Food Company was born.
Although it’s a small operation, it now has 89 employees and 
is growing. Kirkwood is determined to succeed selling his candies 
with names such as Longhorn Bars. As he boarded a flight to 
Beijing for a meeting with a distributor recently, Kirkwood realized 
he had a bag full of candy. He offered one to a flight attendant. 
When lunch is over, he vowed, “Everybody on this plane will know 
Cowboy Candy.”

Chapter 7 • Foreign DireCt investment  211
Theories of Foreign Direct Investment
So far, we have examined the flows of FDI, but we have not investigated explanations for why 
FDI occurs. Let’s now investigate the four main theories that attempt to explain why companies 
engage in FDI.
International Product Life Cycle
Although we introduced it in Chapter 5 in the context of international trade, the international 
product life cycle is also used to explain FDI.3 The international product life cycle theory 
states that a company begins by exporting its product and then later undertakes FDI as a product 
moves through its life cycle. In the new product stage, a good is produced in the home country 
because of uncertain domestic demand and to keep production close to the research depart-
ment that developed the product. In the maturing product stage, the company directly invests in 
production facilities in countries where demand is great enough to warrant its own production 
facilities. In the final standardized product stage, increased competition creates pressures to 
reduce production costs. In response, a company builds production capacity in low-cost develop-
ing nations to serve its markets around the world.
Despite its conceptual appeal, the international product life cycle theory is limited in its 
power to explain why companies choose FDI over other forms of market entry. A local firm in 
the target market could pay for (license) the right to use the special assets needed to manufacture 
a particular product. In this way, a company could avoid the additional risks associated with 
direct investments in the market. The theory also fails to explain why firms choose FDI over 
exporting activities. It might be less expensive to serve a market abroad by increasing output at 
the home country factory rather than by building additional capacity within the target market.
The theory explains why the FDI of some firms follows the international product life cycle 
of their products. But it does not explain why other market entry modes are inferior or less 
advantageous options.
Market Imperfections (Internalization)
A market that is said to operate at peak efficiency (prices are as low as they can possibly be) and 
where goods are readily and easily available is said to be a perfect market. But perfect markets 
are rarely, if ever, seen in business because of factors that cause a breakdown in the efficient 
operation of an industry—called market imperfections. Market imperfections theory states 
that when an imperfection in the market makes a transaction less efficient than it could be, a 
company will undertake FDI to internalize the transaction and thereby remove the imperfection. 
There are two market imperfections that are relevant to this discussion—trade barriers and spe-
cialized knowledge.
TrADe BArrIerS Tariffs are a common form of market imperfection in international business. 
For example, the North American Free Trade Agreement stipulates that a sufficient portion of 
a product’s content must originate within Canada, Mexico, or the United States for the product 
to avoid tariff charges when it is imported to any of these three markets. That is why a large 
number of Korean manufacturers invested in production facilities in Tijuana, Mexico, just south 
of Mexico’s border with the state of California. By investing in production facilities in Mexico, 
Korean companies were able to skirt the North American tariffs that would have been imposed if 
they were to export goods from Korean factories. The presence of a market imperfection (tariffs) 
caused those companies to undertake FDI.
SPeCIALIzeD KnOWLeDGe The unique competitive advantage of a company sometimes 
consists of specialized knowledge. This knowledge could be the technical expertise of engineers 
or the special marketing abilities of managers. When the knowledge is technical expertise, 
companies can charge a fee to companies in other countries for use of the knowledge in 
producing the same or a similar product. But when a company’s specialized knowledge is 
embodied in its employees, the only way to exploit a market opportunity in another nation may 
be to undertake FDI.
The possibility that a company will create a future competitor by charging others a fee for

company will prefer to undertake investment. For example, as Japan rebuilt its industries follow-
ing the Second World War, many Japanese companies paid Western firms for access to the spe-
cial technical knowledge embodied in their products. Those Japanese companies became adept 
at revising and improving many of these technologies and became leaders in their industries, 
including electronics and automobiles.
eclectic Theory
The eclectic theory states that firms undertake FDI when the features of a particular location 
combine with ownership and internalization advantages to make a location appealing for in-
vestment.4 A location advantage is the advantage of locating a particular economic activity in 
a specific location because of the characteristics (natural or acquired) of that location.5 These 
advantages have historically been natural resources such as oil in the Middle East, timber in 
Canada, or copper in Chile. But the advantage can also be an acquired one, such as a productive 
workforce. An ownership advantage refers to company ownership of some special asset, such as 
brand recognition, technical knowledge, or management ability. An internalization advantage is 
one that arises from internalizing a business activity rather than leaving it to a relatively ineffi-
cient market. The eclectic theory states that when all of these advantages are present, a company 
will undertake FDI.
Market Power
Firms often seek the greatest amount of power possible relative to rivals in their industries. The 
market power theory states that a firm tries to establish a dominant market presence in an in-
dustry by undertaking FDI. The benefit of market power is greater profit because the firm is far 
better able to dictate the cost of its inputs and/or the price of its output.
One way a company can achieve market power (or dominance) is through vertical  integration—
the extension of company activities into stages of production that provide a firm’s inputs (backward 
integration) or that absorb its output (forward integration). Sometimes a company can effectively 
control the world supply of an input needed by its industry if it has the resources or ability to integrate 
backward into supplying that input. Companies may also be able to achieve a great deal of market 
power if they can integrate forward to increase control over output. For example, they could perhaps 
make investments in distribution to leapfrog channels of distribution that are tightly controlled by 
competitors.

Chapter 7 • Foreign DireCt investment  213
Management Issues and Foreign Direct Investment
Decisions about whether to engage in FDI involve several important issues regarding manage-
ment of the company and its market. Some of these issues are grounded in the inner workings of 
firms that undertake FDI, such as the control desired over operations abroad or the firm’s cost of 
production. Others are related to the market and the industry in which a firm competes, such as the 
preferences of customers or the actions of rivals. Let’s now examine each of these important issues.
Control
Many companies investing abroad are greatly concerned with controlling the activities that oc-
cur in the local market. Perhaps the company wants to be certain that its product is being mar-
keted in the same way in the local market as it is at home. Or maybe it wants to ensure that the 
selling price remains the same in both markets. Some companies try to maintain ownership of a 
large portion of the local operation, say, even up to 100 percent, in the belief that greater owner-
ship gives them greater control.
Yet for a variety of reasons, even complete ownership does not guarantee control. For 
example, the local government might intervene and require a company to hire some local man-
agers rather than bringing them all in from the home office. Companies may need to prove a 
scarcity of skilled local managerial talent before the government will let them bring managers 
in from the home country. Governments might also require that all goods produced in the local 
facility be exported so that they do not compete with products of the country’s domestic firms.
PArTnerShIP reqUIreMenTS Many companies have strict policies regarding how much 
ownership they take in firms abroad because of the importance of maintaining control. In 
the past, IBM (www.ibm.com) strictly required that the home office own 100 percent of all 
international subsidiaries. But companies must sometimes abandon such policies if a country 
demands shared ownership in return for market access.
Some governments saw shared ownership requirements as a way to shield their workers 
from exploitation and their industries from domination by large international firms. Companies 
would sometimes sacrifice control in order to pursue a market opportunity, but frequently they 
did not. Most countries today do not take such a hard-line stance and have opened their doors to 
investment by multinational companies. Mexico used to make decisions on investment by mul-
tinational corporations on a case-by-case basis. IBM was negotiating with the Mexican govern-
ment for 100 percent ownership of a facility in Guadalajara and got the go-ahead only after the 
company made numerous concessions in other areas.
BeneFITS OF COOPerATIOn Many nations have grown more cooperative toward international 
companies in recent years. Governments of developing and emerging markets realize the 
benefits of investment by multinational corporations, including decreased unemployment, 
increased tax revenues, training to create a more highly skilled workforce, and the transfer of 
technology. A country known for overly restricting the operations of multinational enterprises 
can see its inward investment flow dry up. Indeed, the restrictive policies of India’s government 
hampered FDI inflows for many years.
Cooperation also frequently opens important communication channels that help firms to 
maintain positive relationships in the host country. Both parties tend to walk a fine line—cooper-
ating most of the time, but holding fast on occasions when the stakes are especially high.
Belgium’s Interbrew, now part of Anheuser-Busch InBev (www.ab-inbev.com), benefited 
from its cooperation with a local partner and respect for national pride in Central Europe when 
it acquired Hungary’s Borsodi brewery (formerly a state-owned enterprise). From the start, 
Interbrew wisely insisted that it would move ahead with its purchase only if local management 
would be in charge. Interbrew then assisted local management with technical, marketing, sales, 
distribution, and general management training.
Purchase-or-Build Decision
Another important matter for managers is whether to purchase an existing business or to build a 
subsidiary abroad from the ground up—called a greenfield investment. An acquisition generally 
provides the investor with an existing plant, equipment, and personnel. The acquiring firm may 
also benefit from the goodwill the existing company has built up over the years and, perhaps, 

214  
part 3 • international traDe anD investment
the existing firm’s brand recognition. The purchase of an existing business can also allow for 
alternative methods of financing the purchase, such as an exchange of stock ownership between 
the companies. Factors that reduce the appeal of purchasing existing facilities include obsolete 
equipment, poor relations with workers, and an unsuitable location. For insight into several 
issues managers consider when deciding to build or purchase operations, see the Manager’s 
Briefcase, titled “Surprises of Investing Abroad.”
Mexico’s Cemex, S.A. (www.cemex.com), is a multinational company that made a for-
tune buying struggling, inefficient plants around the world and turning them around. Chairman 
Lorenzo Zambrano has long figured that the overriding principle is “Buy big globally, or be 
bought.” The success of Cemex in using FDI confounded, even rankled, its competitors in devel-
oped nations. For example, Cemex shocked global markets when it carried out a $1.8 billion 
purchase of Spain’s two largest cement companies, Valenciana and Sanson.
But adequate facilities in the local market are sometimes unavailable, and a company must 
go ahead with a greenfield investment. For example, because Poland is a source of skilled and 
inexpensive labor, it is an appealing location for automobile manufacturers. But the country 
had little in the way of advanced automobile-production facilities when General Motors (www.
gm.com) considered investing there. So GM built a $320 million facility in Poland’s Silesian 
region. The factory has the potential to produce 200,000 units annually—some of which are 
destined for export to profitable markets in Western Europe. However, greenfield investments 
can have their share of headaches. Obtaining the necessary permits, financing, and hiring local 
personnel can be a real problem in some markets.
Production Costs
Many factors contribute to production costs in every national market. Labor regulations can 
add significantly to the overall cost of production. Companies may be required to provide ben-
efits packages for their employees that are over and above hourly wages. More time than was 
planned for might be required to train workers adequately in order to bring productivity up to 
an acceptable standard. Although the cost of land and the tax rate on profits can be lower in the 
local market (or purposely lowered to attract multinational corporations), the fact that they will 
remain constant cannot be assumed. Companies from around the world using China as a produc-
tion base have witnessed rising wages erode their profits as the nation continues to industrialize. 
Some companies are therefore finding that Vietnam is now their low-cost location of choice.
rATIOnALIzeD PrODUCTIOn One approach companies use to contain production costs 
is called rationalized production—a system of production in which each of a product’s 
rationalized production
System of production in which 
each of a product’s components 
is produced where the cost of 
producing that component is 
lowest.
The decision of whether to build facilities in a market abroad or to 
purchase existing operations in the local market can be a difficult 
one. Managers can minimize risk by preparing their companies for 
a number of surprises they might face:
• Human Resource Policies Companies cannot always import 
home country policies without violating local laws or offend-
ing local customs. Countries have differing requirements for 
plant operations and have their own regulations regarding 
business operations.
• Mandated Benefits These include company-supplied cloth-
ing and meals, required profit sharing, guaranteed employ-
ment contracts, and generous dismissal policies. These 
costs can exceed an employee’s wages and are typically not 
negotiable.
• Labor Costs France has a minimum wage of about $12 an 
hour, whereas Mexico has a minimum wage of nearly $5 a 
day. But Mexico’s real minimum wage is nearly double that 
due to government-mandated benefits and employment 
practices. Such differences are not always obvious.
• Labor Unions In some countries, organized labor is found 
in nearly every industry and at almost every company. Rather 
than dealing with a single union, managers may need to ne-
gotiate with five or six different unions, each of which repre-
sents a distinct skill or profession.
• Information Sometimes there simply is no reliable data on 
factors such as labor availability, cost of energy, and  national 
inflation rates. These data are generally high quality in 
 developed countries but suspect in emerging and develop-
ing ones.
• Personal and Political Contacts These contacts can be ex-
tremely important in developing and emerging markets and 
can be the only way to establish operations. But complying 
with locally accepted practices can cause ethical dilemmas for 
managers.

components is produced where the cost of producing that component is lowest. All the 
components are then brought together at one central location for assembly into the final product. 
Consider the typical stuffed animal made in China whose components are all imported to China 
(with the exception of the polycore thread with which it’s sewn). The stuffed animal’s eyes are 
molded in Japan. Its outfit is imported from France. The polyester-fiber stuffing comes from 
either Germany or the United States, and the pile-fabric fur is produced in Korea. Only final 
assembly of these components occurs in China.
Although this production model is highly efficient, a potential problem is that a work stop-
page in one country can bring the entire production process to a standstill. For example, the 
production of automobiles is highly rationalized, with parts coming in from a multitude of coun-
tries for assembly. When the United Auto Workers (www.uaw.org) union held a strike for weeks 
against GM (www.gm.com), many of GM’s international assembly plants were threatened. The 
UAW strategically launched their strike at GM’s plant that supplied brake pads to virtually all of 
its assembly plants throughout North America.
MexICO’S MAqUILADOrA Stretching 2,000 miles from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico 
lies a 130-mile-wide strip along the U.S.–Mexican border that comprises a special economic 
region. The region’s economy encompasses 11 million people and $150 billion in output. The 
combination of a low-wage economy nestled next to a prosperous giant is now becoming a 
model for other regions that are split by wage or technology gaps. Some analysts compare the 
U.S.–Mexican border region with that between Hong Kong and its manufacturing realm, China’s 
Guangdong province. Officials from cities along the border between Germany and Poland studied 
the U.S.–Mexican experience to see what lessons could be applied to their unique situation.
COST OF reSeArCh AnD DeveLOPMenT As technology becomes an increasingly powerful 
competitive factor, the soaring cost of developing subsequent stages of technology has led 
multinational corporations to engage in cross-border alliances and acquisitions. For instance, huge 
multinational pharmaceutical companies are intensely interested in the pioneering biotechnology 
work done by smaller, entrepreneurial start-ups. Cadus Pharmaceutical Corporation of New 
York discovered the function of 400 genes related to what are called receptor molecules. Many 
disorders are associated with the improper functioning of these receptors—making them good 
targets for drug development. Britain’s SmithKline Beecham (www.gsk.com) then invested 
around $68 million in Cadus in return for access to its research knowledge.
One indicator of technology’s significance in FDI is the amount of research and develop-
ment (R&D) conducted by company affiliates in other countries. The globalization of inno-
vation and the phenomenon of foreign investment in R&D are not necessarily motivated by 
demand factors such as the size of local markets. They instead appear to be encouraged by 
supply factors, including gaining access to high-quality scientific and technical human capital.

Customer Knowledge
The behavior of buyers is frequently an important issue in the decision of whether to undertake 
FDI. A local presence can help companies gain valuable knowledge about customers that could 
not be obtained from the home market. For example, when customer preferences for a product 
differ a great deal from country to country, a local presence might help companies better under-
stand such preferences and tailor their products accordingly.
Some countries have quality reputations in certain product categories. German automotive 
engineering, Italian shoes, French perfume, and Swiss watches impress customers as being of 

216  
part 3 • international traDe anD investment
superior quality. Because of these perceptions, it can be profitable for a firm to produce its prod-
uct in the country with the quality reputation, even if the company is based in another country. For 
example, a cologne or perfume producer might want to bottle its fragrance in France and give it a 
French name. This type of image appeal can be strong enough to encourage FDI.
Following Clients
Firms commonly engage in FDI when the firms they supply have already invested abroad. This 
practice of “following clients” is common in industries in which producers source component 
parts from suppliers with whom they have close working relationships. The practice tends to re-
sult in companies clustering within close geographic proximity to each other because they supply 
each other’s inputs (see Chapter 5). When Mercedes (www.mercedes.com) opened its first inter-
national car plant in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, automobile-parts suppliers also moved to the 
area from Germany—bringing with them additional investment in the millions of dollars.
With firms working closely together to deliver a product on a global basis, they get to know 
one another rather well. And the movement toward making business activities more environ-
mentally, economically, and socially sustainable means that companies sometimes pressure their 
suppliers and their clients to “green” their activities. For several examples of how businesses have 
done this, read this chapter’s Global Sustainability feature, titled “Greening the Supply Chain.”
Following rivals
FDI decisions frequently resemble a “follow the leader” scenario in industries that have a lim-
ited number of large firms. In other words, many of these firms believe that choosing not to 
make a move parallel to that of the “first mover” might result in being shut out of a potentially 
lucrative market. When firms based in industrial countries moved back into South Africa after 
the end of apartheid, their competitors followed. Of course, each market can sustain only a cer-
tain number of rivals and firms that cannot compete often choose to exit the market. This seems 
to have been the case for Pepsi (www.pepsi.com), which went back into South Africa in the 
1990s but withdrew three years later after being crushed there by Coke (www.cocacola.com).
In this section, we have presented several key issues managers consider when investing 
abroad. We will have more to say on this topic in Chapter 15, when we learn how companies 
take on this ambitious goal.

• When Apple (www.apple.com) decided to pull its products 
from the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool 
(EPEAT) environmental registry, it expected no one would 
notice. But some major Apple customers, like educational 
institutions and governments, must make most or all of their 
technology purchases from products on the EPEAT–certi-
fied list, comprising $65 billion worth of goods annually. The 
backlash from consumers, corporations, and government 
agencies forced Apple to backtrack. Apple said its products 
would again be submitted for certification and that its rela-
tionship with EPEAT “has become stronger as a result of this 
experience.”

Why Governments Intervene in FDI
Nations often intervene in the flow of FDI in order to protect their cultural heritages, domestic 
companies, and jobs. They can enact laws, create regulations, or construct administrative hurdles 
that companies from other nations must overcome if they want to invest in the nation. Yet, rising 
competitive pressure is forcing nations to compete against each other to attract multinational 
companies. The increased national competition for investment is causing governments to enact 
regulatory changes that encourage investment. The majority of regulatory changes that govern-
ments introduced in recent years are more favorable to FDI.6
In a general sense, a bias toward protectionism or openness is rooted in a nation’s culture, 
history, and politics. Values, attitudes, and beliefs form the basis for much of a government’s 
position regarding FDI. For example, South American nations with strong cultural ties to a 
European heritage (such as Argentina) are generally enthusiastic about investment received 
from European nations. South American nations with stronger indigenous influences (such as 
Ecuador) are generally less enthusiastic.
Opinions vary widely on the appropriate amount of FDI a country should encourage. At one 
extreme are those who favor complete economic self-sufficiency and who oppose any form of FDI. 
At the other extreme are those who favor no governmental intervention and who favor booming 
FDI inflows. Between these two extremes lie most countries, which believe a certain amount of 
FDI is desirable to raise national output and enhance the standard of living for their people.
Besides philosophical ideals, countries intervene in FDI for a host of very practical reasons. 
But to fully appreciate those reasons, we must first understand what is meant by a country’s bal-
ance of payments.
Balance of Payments
A country’s balance of payments is a national accounting system that records all receipts coming 
into the nation and all payments to entities in other countries. International transactions that result in 
inflows from other nations add to the balance of payments accounts. International transactions that 
result in outflows to other nations reduce the balance of payments accounts. Table 7.1 shows the 
balance of payments accounts for the United States, which has two major components—the current 
account and the capital account. The balances of the current and capital accounts should be equal.
CUrrenT ACCOUnT The current account is a national account that records transactions 
involving the export and import of goods and services, income receipts on assets abroad, and 
income payments on foreign assets inside the country. The merchandise account in Table 7.1 
covers tangible goods such as computer software, electronic components, and apparel. An 
“Export” of merchandise is assigned a positive value in the balance of payments because income 
is received. An “Import” is assigned a negative value because money is paid to a firm abroad.
The services account involves tourism, business consulting, banking, and other services. 
Suppose a business in the United States receives payment for consulting services provided to a 
company in another country. The receipt is recorded as an “Export” of services and is assigned 
a positive value. An “Import” of services requires money to be sent out of a nation and therefore 
receives a negative value.
The income receipts account is income earned on U.S. assets held abroad. When a U.S. 
company’s subsidiary abroad remits profits back to the parent in the United States, it is recorded 
as an “Income receipt” and is assigned a positive value.

Finally, the income payments account is money paid to entities in other nations that was 
earned on assets held in the United States. For example, when a French company’s U.S. sub-
sidiary sends its profits back to the parent company in France, the transaction is recorded as an 
“Income payment” and is assigned a negative value.
A current account surplus occurs when a country exports more goods and services and 
receives more income from abroad than it imports and pays abroad. Conversely, a current 
account deficit occurs when a country imports more goods and services and pays more abroad 
than it exports and receives from abroad.
CAPITAL ACCOUnT The capital account is a national account that records transactions 
involving the purchase and sale of assets. Suppose a U.S. citizen buys shares of stock in a 
Mexican company on Mexico’s stock market. The transaction is recorded as an “Increase in U.S. 
assets abroad (capital outflow)” and is assigned a negative value. If a Mexican investor buys real 
estate in the United States, the transaction increases “Foreign assets in the United States (capital 
inflow)” and is assigned a positive value.
reasons for Intervention by the host Country
There are a number of reasons why governments intervene in FDI. Let’s look at the two main 
reasons—to control the balance of payments and to obtain resources and benefits.
COnTrOL BALAnCe OF PAyMenTS Many governments see intervention as the only way 
to keep their balance of payments under control. First, because FDI inflows are recorded as 
additions to the balance of payments, a nation gets a balance-of-payments boost from an initial 
FDI inflow. Second, countries can impose local content requirements on investors from other 
nations for the purpose of local production. This gives local companies the chance to become 
suppliers to the production operation, which can help the nation to reduce imports and improve 
its balance of payments. Third, exports (if any) generated by the new production operation can 
have a favorable impact on the host country’s balance of payments.
When companies repatriate profits back to their home countries, however, they deplete the 
foreign exchange reserves of their host countries. These capital outflows decrease the balance of

payments of the host country. To shore up its balance of payments, the host nation may prohibit 
or restrict the nondomestic company from removing profits to its home country.
Alternatively, host countries conserve their foreign exchange reserves when international 
companies reinvest their earnings. Reinvesting in local manufacturing facilities can also improve 
the competitiveness of local producers and boost a host nation’s exports—thus improving its 
balance-of-payments position.
OBTAIn reSOUrCeS AnD BeneFITS Beyond balance-of-payments reasons, governments 
might intervene in FDI flows to acquire resources and benefits such as technology, management 
skills, and employment.
Access to Technology Investment in technology, whether in products or processes, tends to 
increase the productivity and the competitiveness of a nation. That is why host nations have a strong 
incentive to encourage the importation of technology. For years, developing countries in Asia were 
introduced to expertise in industrial processes as multinational corporations set up factories within 
their borders. But today, some of them are trying to acquire and develop their own technological 
expertise. When German industrial giant Siemens (www.siemens.com) chose Singapore as the site 
for an Asia-Pacific microelectronics design center, Singapore gained access to valuable technology. 
Singapore also accessed valuable semiconductor technology by joining with U.S.-based Texas 
Instruments (www.ti.com) and others to set up the country’s first semiconductor-production facility.
Management Skills and employment As we saw in Chapter 4, formerly communist nations 
lack some of the management skills needed to succeed in the global economy. By encouraging 
FDI, these nations can attract talented managers to come in and train locals and thereby improve 
the international competitiveness of their domestic companies. Furthermore, locals who are 
trained in modern management techniques may eventually start their own local businesses—
further expanding employment opportunities. Yet, detractors argue that although FDI can create 
jobs it can also destroy jobs if less-competitive local firms are forced out of business.
reasons for Intervention by the home Country
Home nations (those from which international companies launch their investments) may also 
seek to encourage or discourage outflows of FDI for a variety of reasons. But home nations tend 
to have fewer concerns because they are often prosperous, industrialized nations. For these coun-
tries, an outward investment seldom has a national impact—unlike the impact on developing or 
shown here is the Club med

emerging nations that receive the FDI. Nevertheless, the following are among the most common 
reasons for discouraging outward FDI:
• Investing in other nations sends resources out of the home country. As a result, fewer re-
sources are used for development and economic growth at home. On the other hand, profits 
earned on assets abroad that are returned home increase both a home country’s balance of 
payments and its available resources.
• Outgoing FDI may ultimately damage a nation’s balance of payments by taking the place 
of its exports. This can occur when a company creates a production facility in a market 
abroad, the output of which replaces exports that used to be sent there from the home coun-
try. For example, if a Volkswagen (www.vw.com) plant in the United States fills a demand 
that U.S. buyers would otherwise satisfy with purchases of German-made automobiles, 
Germany’s balance of payments is correspondingly decreased. Still, Germany’s balance of 
payments would be positively affected when Volkswagen repatriates U.S. profits, which 
helps negate the investment’s initial negative balance-of-payments effect. Thus, an interna-
tional investment might make a positive contribution to the balance-of-payments position 
of the country in the long term and offset an initial negative impact.
• Jobs resulting from outgoing investments may replace jobs at home. This is often the 
most contentious issue for home countries. The relocation of production to a low-wage na-
tion can have a strong impact on a locale or region. However, the impact is rarely national, 
and its effects are often muted by other job opportunities in the economy. In addition, there 
may be an offsetting improvement in home country employment if additional exports are 
needed to support the activity represented by the outgoing FDI. For example, if Hyundai 
(www.hyundai-motor.com) of South Korea builds an automobile manufacturing plant in 
Brazil, Korean employment may increase in order to supply the Brazilian plant with parts.
FDI is not always a negative influence on home nations. In fact, countries promote outgoing 
FDI for the following reasons:
• Outward FDI can increase long-term competitiveness. Businesses today frequently com-
pete on a global scale. The most competitive firms tend to be those that conduct business 
in the most favorable locations anywhere in the world, continuously improve their perfor-
mance relative to competitors, and derive technological advantages from alliances formed 
with other companies. Japanese companies have become masterful at benefiting from FDI 
and cooperative arrangements with companies from other nations. The key to their success 
is that Japanese companies see every cooperative venture as a learning opportunity.
• Nations may encourage FDI in industries identified as “sunset” industries. Sunset indus-
tries are those that use outdated and obsolete technologies or those that employ low-wage 
workers with few skills. These jobs are not greatly appealing to countries having industries 
that pay skilled workers high wages. By allowing some of these jobs to go abroad and by 
retraining workers in higher-paying skilled work, they can upgrade their economies toward 
“sunrise” industries. This represents a trade-off for governments between a short-term loss 
of jobs and the long-term benefit of developing workers’ skills.

Government Policy Instruments and FDI
Over time, both host and home nations have developed a range of methods either to promote or 
to restrict FDI (see Table 7.2). Governments use these tools for many reasons, including improv-
ing balance-of-payments positions, acquiring resources, and, in the case of outward investment, 
keeping jobs at home. Let’s take a look at these methods.

 
Chapter 7 • Foreign DireCt investment  221
host Countries: Promotion
Host countries offer a variety of incentives to encourage FDI inflows. These take two general 
forms—financial incentives and infrastructure improvements.
FInAnCIAL InCenTIveS Host governments of all nations grant companies financial incentives 
to invest within their borders. One method includes tax incentives, such as lower tax rates or 
offers to waive taxes on local profits for a period of time—extending as far out as five years or 
more. A country may also offer low-interest loans to investors.
The downside of these types of incentives is that they can allow multinational corporations 
to create bidding wars between locations that are vying for the investment. In such cases, the 
company typically invests in the most appealing region after the locations endure rounds of esca-
lating incentives. Companies have even been accused of engaging other governments in negotia-
tions to force concessions from locations already selected for investment. The cost to taxpayers 
of attracting FDI can be several times what the actual jobs themselves pay—especially when 
nations try to one-up each other to win investment.
InFrASTrUCTUre IMPrOveMenTS Because of the problems associated with financial incentives, 
some governments are taking an alternative route to luring investment. Lasting benefits for 
communities surrounding the investment location can result from making local infrastructure 
improvements—better seaports suitable for containerized shipping, improved roads, and advanced 
telecommunications systems. For instance, Malaysia is carving an enormous Multimedia Super 
Corridor (MSC) into a region’s forested surroundings. The MSC promises a paperless government, 
an intelligent city called Cyberjaya, two telesuburbs, a technology park, a multimedia university, 
and an intellectual property–protection park. The MSC is dedicated to creating the most advanced 
technologies in telecommunications, medicine, distance learning, and remote manufacturing.
host Countries: restriction
Host countries also have a variety of methods to restrict incoming FDI. Again, these take two 
general forms—ownership restrictions and performance demands.
OWnerShIP reSTrICTIOnS Governments can impose ownership restrictions that prohibit 
nondomestic companies from investing in certain industries or from owning certain types of 
businesses. Such prohibitions typically apply to businesses in cultural industries and companies 
vital to national security. For example, as some cultures try to protect traditional values, 
accepting investment by multinational companies can create controversy among conservatives, 
moderates, and liberals. Also, most nations do not allow FDI in their domestic weapons or 
national defense firms. Another ownership restriction is a requirement that nondomestic 
investors hold less than a 50 percent stake in local firms when they undertake FDI.
But nations sometimes eliminate such restrictions when a firm can choose another location 
that has no such restriction in place. When GM was deciding whether to invest in an aging auto-
mobile plant in Jakarta, Indonesia, the Indonesian government scrapped its ownership restriction 
of an eventual forced sale to Indonesians because China and Vietnam were also courting GM for 
the same financial investment.

part 3 • international traDe anD investment
PerFOrMAnCe DeMAnDS More common than ownership requirements are performance 
demands that influence how international companies operate in the host nation. Although 
typically viewed as intrusive, most international companies allow for them in the same way they 
allow for home-country regulations. Performance demands include ensuring that a portion of the 
product’s content originates locally, stipulating that a portion of the output must be exported, or 
requiring that certain technologies be transferred to local businesses.
home Countries: Promotion
To encourage outbound FDI, home-country governments can do any of the following:
• Offer insurance to cover the risks of investments abroad, including, among others, insur-
ance against expropriation of assets and losses from armed conflict, kidnappings, and 
 terrorist attacks.
• Grant loans to firms wishing to increase their investments abroad. A home-country govern-
ment may also guarantee the loans that a company takes from financial institutions.
• Offer tax breaks on profits earned abroad or negotiate special tax treaties. For example, 
several multinational agreements reduce or eliminate the practice of double taxation— 
profits earned abroad being taxed both in the home and host countries.
• Apply political pressure on other nations to get them to relax their restrictions on inbound 
investments. Non-Japanese companies often find it very difficult to invest inside Japan. The 
United States, for one, repeatedly pressures the Japanese government to open its market 
further to FDI. But because such pressure has achieved little success, many U.S. companies 
cooperate with local Japanese businesses when entering Japan’s markets.
home Countries: restriction
On the other hand, to limit the effects of outbound FDI on the national economy, home govern-
ments may exercise either of the following two options:
• Impose differential tax rates that charge income from earnings abroad at a higher rate than 
domestic earnings;
• Impose outright sanctions that prohibit domestic firms from making investments in certain 
nations.

C
ompanies ranging from massive global corporations to adven-
turous entrepreneurs all contribute to FDI flows, and the long-
term trend in FDI is upward. Here we briefly discuss the influence 
of national governments on FDI flows and the flow of FDI in Asia 
and Europe.
national Governments and Foreign Direct Investment
The actions of national governments have important implica-
tions for business. Companies can either be thwarted in their 
efforts or be encouraged to invest in a nation, depending on 
the philosophies of home and host governments. The balance-
of-payments positions of both home and host countries are also 
important because FDI flows affect the economic health of nations. 
To attract investment, a nation must provide a climate conducive 
to business operations, including pro-growth economic policies, a 
stable regulatory environment, and a sound infrastructure, to name 
just a few.
Increased competition for investment by multinational cor-
porations has caused nations to make regulatory changes more 
favorable to FDI. Moreover, just as nations around the world are

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Describe the worldwide pattern of foreign direct investment (FDI).
• For the first time ever, developing countries attracted about 52 percent of global 
FDI inflows (worth $1.35 trillion in 2012) whereas developed countries attracted 
42 percent.
• Among developed countries, the EU, the United States, and Japan account for the 
majority of FDI inflows.
• FDI to developing Asian nations was nearly $407 billion in 2012, with China at-
tracting more than $121 billion and India attracting nearly $26 billion. FDI to 
Latin America and the Caribbean accounted for about 18 percent of the world 
total.
• Globalization and mergers and acquisitions are the two main drivers of global FDI.
 LO2. Summarize each theory that attempts to explain why FDI occurs.
• The international product life cycle theory says that a company begins by export-
ing its product and then later undertakes FDI as the product moves through its life 
cycle.
• Market imperfections theory says that a company undertakes FDI to internal-
ize a transaction and remove an imperfection in the marketplace that is causing 
inefficiencies.
• The eclectic theory says that firms undertake FDI when the features of a location 
combine with ownership and internalization advantages to make for an appealing 
investment.
• The market power theory states that a firm tries to establish a dominant market pres-
ence in an industry by undertaking FDI.
creating free trade agreements (covered in Chapter 8), they are 
also embracing bilateral investment treaties. These bilateral invest-
ment treaties are becoming prominent tools used to attract invest-
ment. Investment provisions within free trade agreements are also 
receiving greater attention than in the past. These efforts to attract 
investment have direct implications for the strategies of multina-
tional companies, particularly when it comes to deciding where to 
locate production, logistics, and back-office service activities.
Foreign Direct Investment in europe
FDI inflows into the developing (transition) nations of Southeast 
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States hit an all-
time high in 2008. Countries that recently entered the European 
Union did particularly well. They saw less investment in areas sup-
porting low-wage, unskilled occupations and greater investment 
in higher value-added activities that take advantage of a well-
educated workforce.
The main reason for the fast pace at which FDI is occurring in 
Western Europe is regional economic integration. Some of the 
foreign investment reported by the European Union certainly went 
to the relatively less-developed markets of the new Central and 
Eastern European members. But much of the activity occurring 
among Western European companies is industry consolidation 
brought on by the opening of markets and the tearing down of 
barriers to free trade and investment. Change in the economic 
landscape across Europe is creating a more competitive business 
climate there.
Foreign Direct Investment in Asia
China attracts the majority of Asia’s FDI, luring companies with 
a lower-wage workforce and access to an enormous domestic 
market. Many companies already active in China are upping their 
investment further, and companies not yet there are developing 
strategies for how to include China in their future plans. The “off-
shoring” of services will likely propel continued FDI in the coming 
years, for which India is the primary destination. India’s attraction is 
its well-educated, low-cost, and English-speaking workforce.
An aspect of national business environments that has implica-
tions for future business activity is the natural environment. By 
their actions, businesses lay the foundation for people’s attitudes 
in developing nations toward FDI by multinational corporations. 
For example, some early cases of FDI in China were character-
ized by a lack of control over people’s actions due to greater 
decentralization in China’s politics and increased power in the 
hands of local Communist Party bosses and bureaucrats. These 
individuals were often more motivated by their personal financial 
gain than they were concerned with the wider impact on society. 
But China’s government is increasing its spending on the environ-
ment, and multinational corporations are helping in cleaning up 
the environment.

part 3 • international traDe anD investment
 LO3. Outline the important management issues in the FDI decision.
• Companies investing abroad often wish to control activities in the local market, but 
even 100 percent ownership may not guarantee control.
• Acquisition of an existing business is preferred when it has updated equipment, good 
relations with workers, and a suitable location.
• A company might need to undertake a greenfield investment when adequate facilities 
are unavailable in the local market.
• Firms often engage in FDI when it gives them valuable knowledge of local buyer 
 behavior, or when it locates them close to client firms and rival firms.
 LO4. Explain why governments intervene in FDI.
• Host nations receive a balance-of-payments boost from initial FDI and from any 
 exports the FDI generates, but they see a decrease in balance of payments when a 
company sends profits to the home country.
• FDI in technology brings in people with management skills who can train locals and 
increase a nation’s productivity and competitiveness.
• Home countries can restrict a FDI outflow because it lowers the balance of pay-
ments, but profits earned on assets abroad and sent home increase the balance of 
payments.
• FDI outflows may replace jobs at home that were based on exports to the host 
country, and may damage a home nation’s balance of payments if they reduce prior 
exports.
 LO5. Describe the policy instruments governments use to promote and restrict FDI.
• Host countries promote FDI inflows by offering companies tax incentives, extending 
low interest loans, and making local infrastructure improvements.
• Host countries restrict FDI inflows by imposing ownership restrictions, and by 
 creating performance demands that influence how a company operates.
• Home countries promote FDI outflows by offering insurance to cover investment 
risk, granting loans to firms investing abroad, guaranteeing company loans, offering 
tax breaks on profits earned abroad, negotiating special tax treaties, and applying 
 political pressure on other nations to accept FDI.
• Home countries restrict FDI outflows by imposing differential tax rates that charge 
income from earnings abroad at a higher rate than domestic earnings and by im-
posing sanctions that prohibit domestic firms from making investments in certain 
nations.

Ethical Challenge You are the production manager for a global business with assembly facilities around the 
world. The business has tended to manufacture in the home country, a developed one, with the 
assembly of the products taking place in a strategically located country in each of the major 
groupings of markets. You have been asked to look at relocating some of the production of the 
older product lines in some of these assembly facilities and using them as production plants. 
Traditionally production has worked closely with research and development in the home 
country. Your changes need to reflect the fact that sales have fallen in the home market with 
increased competition. At the same time, key markets around the world are booming. “Home 
or abroad?” is the question and the potential future of the business is in your hands.

Driving the Green Car Market in Australia
H
igh fuel costs and concerns over climate change are just two 
factors that have caused Australia’s once-booming automotive 
industry to stall in recent years. Although car exports stood at a 
respectable $5.2 billion in 2008, making it one of the country’s top 
ten export earners ahead of more traditional exports such as wine, 
wheat, and wool, there has been a significant change in consumer 
preferences. While the market was once dominated by demand 
for large passenger cars, consumers both domestically and abroad 
now want smaller cars with lower fuel consumption.
As well as demands for change from car buyers, the industry 
has also been facing the double whammy of pressures on costs 
from within. Longstanding plans to cut trade tariffs and quotas 
that had protected the industry since 1985 have been causing 
alarm about what the future might hold because there is now even 
less incentive to build cars locally. Although the automotive in-
dustry around the world has been suffering in the deep financial 
downturn of the time, any further pressure on Australian car manu-
facturing would undoubtedly have a devastating effect. Australian 
carmakers build about 320,000 vehicles a year and employ about 
65,000 people. Many others are also engaged in associated indus-
tries that benefit from the large market.
When Mitsubishi closed the last of its manufacturing plants in 
2008, leaving just three automakers operating in the country (local 
subsidiaries of Ford, Toyota, and General Motors), the govern-
ment could see it was time to act. To add a sense of urgency, Ford 
Australia announced plans to cut 450 jobs, as industry figures 
showed car sales down 11 percent from the year before.
The solution was a proposal to spend $3.4 billion between 
2011 and 2020 on a fund to transform the Australian automotive 
industry into the green car market. The intention is to use the fund 
to help the manufacturers still involved in that country with the 
costs of developing new technologies for alternative energy ve-
hicles and encourage them to make any existing environmentally 
friendly models in Australia.
The initiative caught the attention of Japanese car giant 
Toyota, which is one of the many international automakers rac-
ing to offer more fuel-efficient models in the wake of fuel prices 
hitting record highs around the world as well as increased envi-
ronmental concerns. Toyota’s business plan is to reach a target of 
selling 1 million hybrid cars by the early part of the next decade, 
and to accomplish this goal, it needs to more than double produc-
tion of the vehicles. The Japanese company was already building 
its Camry hybrid in Japan, as well as in Kentucky in the United 
States and in a joint venture factory in China. In 2008, thanks in 
part to the strength of the Australian dollar, it had been weighing 
an alternative plan to import engines to Australia from its Kamigo 
plant in Japan.
In September 2010, after months of discussion, Toyota an-
nounced a $300 million upgrade of its plant in western Melbourne. 
Under the investment, which has been partly funded by taxpayers 
through a $63 million payment from the Green Car Innovation 
Fund, as well as an injection of cash from the local Victorian 
administration, the Altona engine plant was aiming to produce 
100,000 hybrid engines and four-cylinder new generation engines 
each year from the second half of 2012. The plan was that the 
Australian-made engines would be exported into other countries 
that manufacture Toyota’s Camry and Hybrid Camry.
Toyota’s more environmentally sustainable engines will con-
sume 4.5 percent less fuel and produce 5 percent fewer greenhouse 
gas emissions than the current equivalent. The Australian govern-
ment claimed that the initiative would secure as many as 3,300 
jobs, including existing direct and indirect jobs, and would anchor 
Toyota’s operations in the country for years to come. According 
to Toyota executives, the support provided by the Green Car 
Innovation Fund was the major factor in the project going ahead 
when they weighed it against other alternatives, including transfer-
ring production to the home market in Japan.

Nestlé’s Global Recipe
VEVEY, Switzerland—Nestlé (www.nestle.com) is the largest food company in the 
world and is active in nearly every country on the planet. It earns just 2 percent of its 
sales at home in Switzerland, and it operates across cultural borders 24 hours a day.
Nestlé has a knack for turning humdrum products like bottled water and pet food 
into well-known global brands. It also takes regional products to the global market when 
the opportunity arises. For  example, 
Nestlé launched a cereal bar for diabet-
ics first in Asia under the brand name 
Nutren Balance and then introduced it 
to other markets worldwide.
Food is integral to every culture’s 
social fabric. Nestlé must carefully nav-
igate the cultural landscape in other 
countries in order to remain sensi-
tive to local dietary traditions. Nestlé 
learned from past mistakes and now 
tries to ensure that mothers in develop-
ing nations use purified water to mix its 
baby milk formulas, for example. As 
Nestlé  expands into emerging markets, 
it watches for changes in consumer at-
titudes that result from greater cross-
cultural contact caused by regional 
 integration. Pictured here, a customer 
examines Nestlé dried milk products at 
a supermarket in Yichang, China.
Nestlé also needs to tread carefully when it comes to global sustainability. 
Greenpeace charged that Nestlé (and others) source palm oil for their products from 
delicate Indonesian rainforests and peatlands. Nestlé said it would stop purchasing such 
palm oil and as of 2015, all its palm oil is certified sustainable. It also committed itself 
to a “no deforestation” target by 2020.
When Nestlé and Coca-Cola announced a joint venture to develop coffee and tea 
drinks, they first had to show the European Union (EU) Commission that they would 
not stifle competition across the region. Firms operating within the EU must also abide 
by EU environmental protection laws. Nestlé works with governments to minimize 
packaging waste that results from the use of its products by developing and managing 
waste-recovery programs. As you read this chapter, consider all the business implica-
tions of nations banding together in regional trading blocs.1

part 3 • international trade and investment
Regional trade agreements are changing the landscape of the global marketplace. Companies like 
Nestlé of Switzerland are finding that these agreements lower trade barriers and open new markets 
for goods and services. Markets otherwise off-limits because tariffs made imported products too ex-
pensive can become quite attractive once tariffs are lifted. But trade agreements can be double-edged 
swords for many companies and countries. Not only do regional trade agreements allow domestic 
companies to seek new markets abroad, but they also let competitors from other nations enter the 
domestic market. Such mobility increases competition in all markets that participate in an agreement.
We began Part 3 of this book by discussing the gains resulting from specialization and trade. 
We now close this part of the book by showing how groups of countries are cooperating to dis-
mantle barriers that threaten these potential gains. In this chapter, we focus on regional efforts to 
encourage freer trade and investment. We begin by defining regional economic integration and 
describing each of its five levels. We then examine the case for and against regional economic 
integration. In the remainder of the chapter, we explore several long-established trade agree-
ments and several agreements in the early stages of development.
Levels of Integration and the Debate
The process whereby countries in a geographic region cooperate to reduce or eliminate barriers 
to the international flow of products, people, or capital is called regional economic integration 
(regionalism). A group of nations in a geographic region undergoing economic integration is 
called a regional trading bloc.
Nations have banded together to reap the potential gains of international trade in a variety of 
ways. Figure 8.1 shows five potential levels (or degrees) of economic and political integration for 
regional trading blocs. A free trade area is the lowest extent of national integration; political union 
is the greatest. Each level of integration incorporates the properties of those levels that precede it.
Free Trade Area
Economic integration whereby countries seek to remove all barriers to trade among themselves 
but where each country determines its own barriers against nonmembers is called a free trade 
area. A free trade area is the lowest level of economic integration that is possible between two 
or more countries. Countries belonging to the free trade area strive to remove all tariffs and

nontariff barriers, such as quotas and subsidies, on international trade in goods and services. 
However, each country is able to maintain whatever policy it sees fit against nonmember coun-
tries. These policies can differ widely from country to country. Countries belonging to a free 
trade area also typically establish a process by which trade disputes can be resolved.
Customs Union
Economic integration whereby countries remove all barriers to trade among themselves and set a 
common trade policy against nonmembers is called a customs union. Thus, the main difference 
between a free trade area and a customs union is that the members of a customs union agree to 
treat trade with all nonmember nations in a similar manner. Countries belonging to a customs 
union might also negotiate as a single entity with other supranational organizations, such as the 
World Trade Organization.
Common Market
Economic integration whereby countries remove all barriers to trade and to the movement of 
 labor and capital among themselves and set a common trade policy against nonmembers is 
called a common market. Thus, a common market integrates the elements of free trade areas 
and customs unions and adds the free movement of important factors of production—people and 
cross-border investment. This level of integration is very difficult to attain because it requires 
members to cooperate to at least some extent on economic and labor policies. Furthermore, 
the benefits to individual countries can be uneven because skilled labor may move to countries 
where wages are higher, and investment capital may flow to areas where returns are greater.
Economic Union
Economic integration whereby countries remove barriers to trade and the movement of labor and 
capital among members, set a common trade policy against nonmembers, and coordinate their 
economic policies is called an economic union. An economic union goes beyond the demands 
of a common market by requiring member nations to harmonize their tax, monetary, and fiscal 
policies and to create a common currency. Economic unions require that member countries con-
cede a certain amount of their national autonomy (or sovereignty) to the supranational union of 
which they are a part.
Political Union
Economic and political integration whereby countries coordinate aspects of their economic and 
political systems is called a political union. A political union requires member nations to accept 
a common stance on economic and political matters regarding nonmember nations. However, 
nations are allowed a degree of freedom in setting certain political and economic policies 
within their territories. Individually, Canada and the United States provide examples of political 
unions early in their histories. In both these nations, smaller states and provinces combined to 
form larger entities. A group of nations currently taking steps in this direction is the European 
Union—discussed later in this chapter.
Table 8.1 identifies the members of every regional trading bloc presented in this chapter. 
As you work through this chapter, refer back to this table for a quick summary of each bloc’s 
members.
The Case for Regional Integration
Few topics in international business are as hotly contested and involve as many groups as the 
effects of regional trade agreements on people, jobs, companies, cultures, and living standards. 
On one side of the debate are people who see the positive effects that regional trade agreements 
cause; on the other side, those who see the negative effects.
The goals of nations pursuing economic integration are not only to increase cross-border 
trade and investment but also to raise living standards for their people. We saw in Chapter 5, for 
example, how specialization and trade create real gains in terms of greater choice, lower prices, 
and increased productivity. Regional trade agreements are designed to help nations accomplish 
these objectives. Regional economic integration sometimes has additional goals, such as protec-
tion of intellectual property rights or the environment, or even eventual political union.

TRAdE CREATIOn Economic integration removes barriers to trade and/or investment for 
nations belonging to a trading bloc. The increase in the level of trade between nations that results 
from regional economic integration is called trade creation. One result of trade creation is that 
consumers and industrial buyers in member nations are faced with a wider selection of goods 
and services not previously available. For example, the United States has many popular brands 
of bottled water, including Coke’s Dasani (www.dasani.com) and Pepsi’s Aquafina (www.pepsi.
com). But grocery and convenience stores inside the United States stock a wide variety of lesser-
known imported brands of bottled water, such as Stonepoint from Canada. Certainly, the free 
trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the United States (discussed later in this chapter) 
created export opportunities for this and other Canadian brands.

Chapter 8 • regional eConomiC integration  233
Trade creation can also increase aggregate demand in an economy. The wider selection of 
products that results from trade creation can lower prices. Lower product prices then increase 
purchasing power, which in turn tend to increase demand for goods and services.
GREATER COnsEnsUs In Chapter 6, we saw how the World Trade Organization (WTO) works 
to lower barriers on a global scale. Efforts at regional economic integration differ in that they 
comprise smaller groups of nations—ranging from several countries to as many as 30 or more. 
The benefit of trying to eliminate trade barriers in smaller groups of countries is that it can be 
easier to gain consensus from fewer members as opposed to, say, the 159 countries that comprise 
the WTO.
POLITICAL COOPERATIOn There can also be political benefits from efforts toward regional 
economic integration. A group of nations can have significantly greater political weight than 
each nation has individually. Thus, the group, as a whole, can have more say when negotiating 
with other countries in forums such as the WTO. Integration involving political cooperation can 
also reduce the potential for military conflict between member nations. In fact, peace was at the 
center of early efforts at integration in Europe in the 1950s. The devastation of two world wars in 
the first half of the twentieth century caused Europe to see integration as one way of preventing 
further armed conflicts.
EMPLOyMEnT OPPORTUnITIEs Regional integration can expand employment opportunities 
by enabling people to move from one country to another to find work or, simply, to earn a 
higher wage. Regional integration has opened doors for young people in Europe. Forward-
looking young people have abandoned extreme nationalism and have taken on what can only be 
described as a “European” attitude that embraces a shared history. Those with language skills 
and a willingness to pick up and move to another EU country get to explore a new culture’s way 
of life while earning a living. As companies seek their future leaders in Europe, they will hire 
people who can think across borders and across cultures.
CORPORATE sAvInGs Trade agreements can allow companies to alter their strategies, sometimes 
radically. For example, nations in the Americas want to create a free trade area that runs from 
the northern tip of Alaska to the southern tip of South America. Companies that do business 
throughout this region could save millions of dollars annually from the removal of import tariffs 
under an eventual agreement. Multinational corporations could also save money by supplying 
entire regions from just a few regional factories, rather than having a factory in each nation.
The Case Against Regional Integration
Opposite those who argue the case for regional economic integration are those who see the 
companies who have packed up and moved abroad, leaving unemployed workers in their 
wake. Let’s now look at the main arguments of those pushing the case against regional eco-
nomic integration.
TRAdE dIvERsIOn The flip side of trade creation is trade diversion—the diversion of 
trade away from nations not belonging to a trading bloc and toward member nations. Trade 
diversion can occur after the formation of a trading bloc because of the lower tariffs charged 
among member nations. It can actually result in increased trade with a less-efficient producer 
within the trading bloc and in reduced trade with a more efficient, nonmember producer. So, 
economic integration can unintentionally reward a less efficient producer within the trading 
bloc. Unless there is other internal competition for the producer’s good or service, buyers 
will likely pay more after trade diversion because of the inefficient production methods of the 
producer.
A World Bank report caused a stir over the results of the free trade bloc among Latin 
America’s largest countries, MERCOSUR (discussed later in this chapter). The report suggested 
that the bloc’s formation only encouraged free trade in the lowest-value products of local origin, 
while deterring competition for more sophisticated goods manufactured outside the market. 
Closer analysis showed that, while imports from one member state to another tripled during 
the period studied, imports from the rest of the world also tripled. Thus, the net effect of the 
agreement was trade creation, not trade diversion, as critics had charged. Also, the Australian 
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade released the results of a study that examined the impact

nations not belonging to a trading 
bloc and toward member nations.

234  
part 3 • international trade and investment
of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on Australia’s trade with and investment 
in North America. The study found no evidence of trade diversion following the agreement’s 
formation.2
shIFTs In EMPLOyMEnT Perhaps the most controversial aspect of regional economic 
integration is its effect on people’s jobs. The formation of a trading bloc promotes efficiency 
by significantly reducing or eliminating barriers to trade among its members. The surviving 
producer of a particular good or service, then, is likely to be the bloc’s most efficient producer. 
Industries requiring mostly unskilled labor, for example, tend to respond to the formation of a 
trading bloc by shifting production to a low-wage nation within the bloc.
Yet, figures on jobs lost or gained as a result of trading bloc formation vary depending on 
the source. The U.S. government contends that rising U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada have 
created a minimum of 900,000 jobs.3 But the AFL-CIO (www.aflcio.org), the federation of U.S. 
unions, disputes these figures and claims a loss of jobs due to NAFTA. Trade agreements do 
cause dislocations in labor markets; some jobs are lost while others are gained.
It is likely that once trade and investment barriers are removed, countries protecting low-wage 
domestic industries from competition will see these jobs move to the country where wages are 
lower. This can be an opportunity for workers who lose their jobs to upgrade their skills and gain 
more advanced job training. This can help nations increase their competitiveness because a more 
educated and skilled workforce attracts higher-paying jobs than does a less skilled workforce.4
LOss OF nATIOnAL sOvEREIGnTy There is also a cultural element of such agreements. Some 
people argue that they will lose their unique national identity if their nation cooperates too much 
with others. As we saw in this chapter’s opening company profile, Nestlé tries to be sensitive to 
cultural differences across markets. But such large global companies are often lightning rods for 
nationalist forces and those warning of cultural homogenization.
Successive levels of integration require that nations surrender more of their national sov-
ereignty. The least amount of sovereignty that must be surrendered to the trading bloc occurs 
in a free trade area. By contrast, a political union requires nations to give up a high degree of 
sovereignty in foreign policy. This is why a political union is so hard to achieve. Long histories 
of cooperation or animosity between nations do not become irrelevant when a group of coun-
tries forms a union. Because one member nation may have very delicate ties with a nonmember 
nation with which another member may have very strong ties, the setting of a common foreign 
policy can be extremely tricky.
Economic integration is taking place throughout the world because of the benefits and 
despite the drawbacks of regional trade agreements. Europe, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, 
and Africa are all undergoing integration to varying degrees (see Map 8.1 on pages 236–237). 
Let’s now begin our coverage of specific efforts toward economic integration by exploring 
Europe, which has the longest history and highest level of integration to date.

Integration in Europe
The most sophisticated and advanced example of regional integration that we can point to 
today is occurring in Europe. European efforts at integration began shortly after the Second 
World War as a cooperative endeavor among a small group of countries and involved a few 
select industries. Regional integration now encompasses practically all of Western Europe 
and all industries.

 
Chapter 8 • regional eConomiC integration  235
European Union
In the middle of the twentieth century, many would have scoffed at the idea that European na-
tions, which had spent so many years at war with one another, could present a relatively unified 
whole more than 50 years later. Let’s investigate how Europe came so far in such a relatively 
short time.
EARLy yEARs A war-torn Europe emerged from the Second World War in 1945 facing two 
challenges: (1) It needed to rebuild itself and avoid further armed conflict, and (2) it needed to 
increase its industrial strength to stay competitive with an increasingly powerful United States. 
Cooperation seemed to be the only way of facing these challenges. Belgium, France, West 
Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands signed the Treaty of Paris in 1951, creating 
the European Coal and Steel Community. These nations were determined to remove barriers to 
trade in coal, iron, steel, and scrap metal in order to coordinate coal and steel production among 
themselves, thereby controlling the postwar arms industry.
The members of the European Coal and Steel Community signed the Treaty of Rome in 
1957, creating the European Economic Community. The Treaty of Rome outlined a future com-
mon market for these nations. It also aimed to establish common transportation and agricultural 
policies among members. In 1967, the community’s scope was broadened to include additional 
industries, notably atomic energy, and it changed its name to the European Community. As the 
goals of integration continued to expand, so too did the bloc’s membership. Waves of enlarge-
ment occurred in 1973, 1981, 1986, 1995, 2004, and 2007. In 1994, the bloc once again changed 
its name to the European Union (EU). Today, the 28-member EU (www.europa.eu) has a popu-
lation of about 500 million people and a gross domestic product (GDP) of around $18 trillion 
(see Map 8.2 on page 238).
In recent years, two important milestones contributed to the continued progress of the EU: 
the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty.
single European Act By the mid-1980s, EU member nations were frustrated by remaining 
trade barriers and a lack of progress on several important matters, including taxation, law, and 
regulations. The important objective of harmonizing laws and policies was beginning to appear 
unachievable. A commission that was formed to analyze the potential for a common market by 
the end of 1992 put forth several proposals. The goal was to remove remaining barriers, increase 
harmonization, and thereby enhance the competitiveness of European companies. The proposals 
became the Single European Act (SEA), which went into effect in 1987.
A wave of mergers and acquisitions swept across Europe as companies took advantage of 
the opportunities that the SEA offered. Large firms combined their special understanding of 
European needs, capabilities, and cultures with their advantage of economies of scale. Small and 
medium-sized companies networked with one another to increase their competitiveness.
Maastricht Treaty Some members of the EU wanted to take European integration further still. 
A 1991 summit meeting of EU member nations took place in Maastricht, the Netherlands. The 
meeting resulted in the Maastricht Treaty, which went into effect in 1993.
The Maastricht Treaty had three aims. First, it called for banking in a single, common cur-
rency after January 1, 1999, and circulation of coins and paper currency on January 1, 2002. 
Second, the treaty set up monetary and fiscal targets for countries that wished to take part in 
monetary union. Third, the treaty called for political union of the member nations—including 
development of a common foreign and defense policy and common citizenship. Member coun-
tries will hold off further political integration until they gauge the success of the final stages of 
economic and monetary union. Let’s take a closer look at monetary union in Europe.
EUROPEAn MOnETARy UnIOn As stated previously, EU leaders were determined to create a 
single, common currency. European monetary union is the EU plan that established its own 
central bank and currency in January 1999. The Maastricht Treaty stated the economic criteria 
with which member nations must comply in order to partake in the single currency, the euro. 
First, consumer price inflation must be below 3.2 percent and must not exceed that of the three 
best-performing countries by more than 1.5 percent. Second, the debt of government must be no 
higher than 60 percent of GDP. An exception is made if the ratio is diminishing and approaching 
the 60 percent mark.

Economic Integration in 
Europe

 
Chapter 8 • regional eConomiC integration  239
Third, the general government deficit must be no higher than 3.0 percent of GDP. An excep-
tion is made if the deficit is close to 3.0 percent or if the deviation is temporary and unusual. 
Fourth, interest rates on long-term government securities must not exceed, by more than 2.0 
percent, those of the three countries with the lowest inflation rates. Meeting these criteria 
better aligned countries’ economies and paved the way for smoother policy making under a 
single European Central Bank. The 18 EU member nations that adopted the single currency are 
Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, 
Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.
Members of the EU were not immune to the recent global financial crisis and recession. 
The countries that had amassed the largest debts relative to their GDPs included Greece, Ireland, 
Italy, Portugal, and Spain. In 2012, the EU supported the economies of Greece and Spain with 
emergency funding when they began to buckle due to a lack of confidence in their banking and 
finance sectors. The EU later announced that it would act as a lender of last resort for troubled 
countries and pledged to create a banking union in order to support the financial institutions of 
the weakest economies. These moves halted the spread of Europe’s financial crisis. The newly 
pledged banking union may, in fact, serve as a stepping stone to a future fiscal union in the EU.5
Management Implications of the Euro The move to a single currency influences the activities 
of companies within the EU. First, the euro removes financial obstacles created by the use of 
multiple currencies. It completely eliminates exchange-rate risk for business deals between 
member nations using the euro. The euro also reduces transaction costs by eliminating the cost 
of converting from one currency to another. In fact, the EU leadership estimates the financial 
gains to Europe could eventually be 0.5 percent of GDP. The efficiency of trade between 
participating members resembles that of interstate trade in the United States because only a 
single currency is involved.
Second, the euro makes prices between markets more transparent, making it difficult to 
charge different prices in adjoining markets. As a result, shoppers feel less of a need to travel 
to other countries to save money on high-ticket items. For example, shortly before monetary 
union, a Mercedes-Benz S320 (www.mercedes.com) cost $72,614 in Germany but only 
$66,920 in Italy. A Renault Twingo (www.renault.com) that sold for $13,265 in France cost 
$11,120 in Spain. Automobile brokers and shopping agencies even sprang up specifically to 
help European consumers reap such savings. The euro has greatly reduced or eliminated this 
type of situation.
EnLARGEMEnT OF ThE EUROPEAn UnIOn One of the most historic events across Europe in 
recent memory was the EU enlargement that added 12 new members in 2007. Croatia was the 
most recent country to join the EU in 2013. Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey, and the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia remain candidates for EU membership and are to become 
members after they meet certain demands laid down by the EU. These so-called Copenhagen 
Criteria require each country to demonstrate that it:
• Has stable institutions, which guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and re-
spect for and protection of minorities.
• Has a functioning market economy, capable of coping with competitive pressures and mar-
ket forces within the EU.
• Is able to assume the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of eco-
nomic, monetary, and political union.
• Has the ability to adopt the rules and regulations of the community, the rulings of the 
European Court of Justice, and the treaties.
Although it has applied for membership, negotiations for Turkey are expected to be dif-
ficult. One reason for Turkey’s lack of support in the EU is charges (fair or not) of human 
rights abuses with regard to its Kurdish minority. Another reason is intense opposition by 
Greece, Turkey’s longtime foe. Turkey does have a customs union with the EU, however, 
and trade between them is growing. Despite disappointment among some EU hopefuls and 
despite intermittent setbacks in the enlargement process, integration is progressing. To read 
about how culture affects business activities in one EU country, see the Culture Matters fea-
ture, titled “Czech List.”

The countries of Central and Eastern Europe that belong to the EU 
represent a land of opportunity. But like doing business anywhere, 
understanding local culture can be a big advantage. Successful 
businesspeople in the Czech Republic offer the following advice:
• Formalities Czech society is rather formal, and it is best to 
tend toward the more formal unless you know your colleague 
well. This includes using titles like “Doctor” and “Mister.” 
It’s rarely appropriate to use first names unless you’re close 
friends.
• Business Relationships Making money is obviously impor-
tant and is the ultimate goal for any business. Still, building 
personal relationships, establishing good references, and do-
ing favors for others can smooth the way for newcomers.
• Czech Partners Being communist for 40 years before it 
became a capitalist democracy has left its mark on the 
Czech people and their culture. Finding a local partner 
who can handle the inevitable cultural difficulties that arise 
is crucial.
• Local Professionals It is a good idea to hire a Czech ac-
countant or someone familiar with Czech laws, taxes, and red 
tape. An attorney who is bilingual can also interpret differ-
ences between Czech and U.S. laws.
• The Jednatel Companies need a “responsible person” 
(or jednatel in Czech) who is in charge of all aspects of the 
 business. Some Czechs still feel more comfortable work-
ing with this jednatel rather than with foreign and unfamiliar 
 company reps.

and enforcing economic and political integration (see Figure 8.2). Other EU institutions that 
fulfill secondary and support roles are not discussed here.
European Parliament The European Parliament consists of 766 members elected by popular 
vote within each member nation every five years. As such, they are expected to voice their 
particular political views on EU matters. The European Parliament fulfills its role of adopting 
EU law by debating and amending legislation proposed by the European Commission. It 
exercises political supervision over all EU institutions—giving it the power to supervise 
commissioner appointments and to censure the commission. It also has veto power over some 
laws (including the annual budget of the EU). There is a call for increased democratization 
within the EU, and some believe this could be achieved by strengthening the powers of the 
Parliament. The Parliament conducts its activities in Belgium (in the city of Brussels), France 
(in the city of Strasbourg), and Luxembourg.
Council of the EU The council is the legislative body of the EU. When it meets, it brings 
together representatives of member states at the ministerial level. The configuration of the 
council changes depending on which topic is under discussion. For example, when the topic is 
agriculture, the council is composed of the ministers of agriculture from each member nation. 
No proposed legislation becomes EU law unless the council votes it into law. Although passage 
into law for sensitive issues such as immigration and taxation still requires a unanimous vote, 
some legislation today requires only a simple majority to win approval. The council also 
concludes, on behalf of the EU, international agreements with other nations or international 
organizations. The council is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium.

European Commission The commission is the executive body of the EU. It is comprised of 28 
commissioners appointed by each member country. Member nations appoint the president and 
commissioners after being approved by the European Parliament. The commission has the right 
to draft legislation, is responsible for managing and implementing policy, and monitors member 
nations’ implementation of, and compliance with, EU law. Each commissioner is assigned a 
specific policy area, such as competitive policy or agricultural policy. Although commissioners 
are appointed by their national governments, they are expected to behave in the best interest 
of the EU as a whole, not in the interest of their own country. The European Commission is 
headquartered in Brussels, Belgium.
Court of Justice The Court of Justice is the court of appeals of the EU and is composed of 
28 judges (one from each member nation) and 9 advocates general who hold renewable six-
year terms. One type of case that the Court of Justice hears is one in which a member nation is 
accused of not meeting its treaty obligations. Another type is one in which the commission or 
council is charged with failing to live up to its responsibilities under the terms of a treaty. Like 
the commissioners, justices are required to act in the interest of the EU as a whole, not in the 
interest of their own countries. The Court of Justice is located in Luxembourg.
Court of Auditors The Court of Auditors is made up of 28 members (one from each member 
nation) appointed for renewable six-year terms. The court is assigned the duty of auditing the 
EU accounts and implementing its budget. It also aims to improve financial management in 
the EU and to report to member nations’ citizens on the use of public funds. As such, it issues 
annual reports and statements on the implementation of the EU budget. The court employs 
roughly 800 auditors and staff to assist it in carrying out its functions. The Court of Auditors is 
based in Luxembourg.

European Free Trade Association (EFTA)
Certain nations in Europe were reluctant to join in the ambitious goals of the EU, fearing de-
structive rivalries and a loss of national sovereignty. Some of these nations did not want to be 
part of a common market but instead wanted the benefits of a free trade area. So in 1960, several 
countries banded together and formed the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) to focus on 
trade in industrial, not consumer, goods. Because some of the original members joined the EU 
and some new members joined EFTA (www.efta.int), today the group consists of only Iceland, 
Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland (see Map 8.2).
The population of EFTA is around 13.5 million, and it has a combined GDP of around $895 
billion. Despite its relatively small size, members remain committed to free trade principles 
and raising standards of living for their people. The EFTA and the EU created the European 
Economic Area (EEA) to cooperate on matters such as the free movement of goods, persons, ser-
vices, and capital among member nations. The two groups also cooperate in other areas, includ-
ing the environment, social policy, and education.

Integration in the Americas
Europe’s success at economic integration caused other nations to consider the benefits of form-
ing their own regional trading blocs. Latin American countries began forming regional trading 
arrangements in the early 1960s, but they made substantial progress only in the 1980s and 
1990s. North America was about three decades behind Europe in taking major steps toward 
economic integration. Let’s now explore the major efforts toward economic integration in North, 
South, and Central America, beginning with North America.
north American Free Trade Agreement (nAFTA)
There has always been a good deal of trade between Canada and the United States. Canada and 
the United States had in the past established trade agreements in several industrial sectors of 
their economies, including automotive products. In January 1989, the U.S.–Canada Free Trade 
Agreement went into effect. The goal was to eliminate all tariffs on bilateral trade between 
Canada and the United States by 1998.
Accelerating integration in Europe caused new urgency in the task of creating a North 
American trading bloc that included Mexico. Mexico joined what is now the World Trade 
Organization in 1987 and began privatizing state-owned enterprises in 1988. Talks among 
Canada, Mexico, and the United States in 1991 eventually resulted in the formation of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA (www.nafta-sec-alena.org) became 
effective in January 1994 and superseded the U.S.–Canada Free Trade Agreement. Today 
NAFTA comprises a market with 450 million consumers and a GDP of around $17 trillion 
(see Map 8.1).
As a free trade agreement, NAFTA has eliminated all tariffs and nontariff trade barriers on 
goods originating within North America. The agreement also calls for liberalized rules regarding 
government procurement practices, the granting of subsidies, and the imposition of countervail-
ing duties (see Chapter 6). Other provisions deal with issues such as trade in services, intellec-
tual property rights, and standards of health, safety, and the environment.
LOCAL COnTEnT REqUIREMEnTs And RULEs OF ORIGIn While NAFTA encourages free 
trade among Canada, Mexico, and the United States, manufacturers and distributors must abide 
by local content requirements and rules of origin. Although producers and distributors rarely 
know the precise origin of every part or component in a piece of industrial equipment, they are 

 
Chapter 8 • regional eConomiC integration  243
responsible for determining whether a product has sufficient North American content to qualify 
for tariff-free status. The producer or distributor must also provide a NAFTA “certificate of 
origin” to an importer to claim an exemption from tariffs. Four criteria determine whether a 
good meets NAFTA rules of origin:
• Goods wholly produced or obtained in the NAFTA region
• Goods containing nonoriginating inputs but meeting Annex 401 origin rules (which covers 
regional input)
• Goods produced in the NAFTA region wholly from originating materials
• Unassembled goods and goods classified in the same harmonized system category as their 
parts that do not meet Annex 401 rules but that have sufficient North American regional 
value content
EFFECTs OF nAFTA Since NAFTA came into effect, trade among the three participating 
nations has increased markedly, with the greatest gains occurring between Mexico and the 
United States. Today, the United States exports more to Mexico than it does to Britain, 
France, Germany, and Italy combined. In fact, Mexico is the third largest source of U.S. 
imports (behind China and Canada) and is the second largest market for U.S exports (behind 
Canada).
Overall, NAFTA has helped trade among the three countries to grow from $297 billion in 
1993 to around $1.6 trillion. Since the start of NAFTA, Mexico’s exports to the United States 
have jumped to around $280 billion, and U.S. exports to Mexico have grown to more than $226 
billion.6 Over the same period, Canada’s exports to the United States more than doubled to 
nearly $332 billion, and U.S. exports to Canada grew to $300 billion. As these numbers suggest, 
the United States has developed a trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. Canada and Mexico 
traded very little with each other before NAFTA. But within a few years, Canada’s exports to 
Mexico grew to $3.9 billion and Mexico’s exports to Canada grew from $1.5 billion to $5.2 
billion.7
The agreement’s effect on employment and wages is not as easy to determine. The U.S. 
Trade Representative Office claims that exports to Mexico and Canada support 2.9 million 
U.S. jobs (900,000 more than in 1993), which pay 13 to 18 percent more than national aver-
ages for production workers.8 But the AFL-CIO group of unions disputes this claim; it argues 
that, since its formation, NAFTA has cost the United States more than one million jobs and job 
opportunities.9
In addition to claims of job losses, opponents claim that NAFTA has damaged the environ-
ment, particularly along the United States–Mexico border. Although the agreement included 
provisions for environmental protection, Mexico is making some headway in dealing with the 
environmental impact of greater economic activity. Mexico’s Instituto Nacional de Ecologia 
(www.ine.gob.mx) has developed an industrial waste–management program, including an incen-
tive system to encourage waste reduction and recycling. The U.S. and Mexican federal govern-
ments have invested several billion dollars in environmental protection efforts since the creation 
of NAFTA.10
ExPAnsIOn OF nAFTA Continued ambivalence among union leaders and environmental 
watchdogs regarding the long-term effects of NAFTA are partly responsible for delays in its 
expansion. The pace at which NAFTA expands will depend to a large extent on whether the 
U.S. Congress grants successive U.S. presidents trade-promotion (“fast track”) authority. 
Trade-promotion authority allows a U.S. administration to engage in all necessary talks 
surrounding a trade deal without the official involvement of Congress. After details of the deal 
are decided, Congress then simply votes yes or no on the deal and cannot revise the treaty’s 
provisions.
But there is little doubt that integration will expand some day in the Americas. In fact, it 
is even possible that the North American economies will one day adopt a single currency. As 
trade among Canada, Mexico, and the United States strengthens, a single currency (likely the 
U.S. dollar) would benefit companies in these countries with reduced exposure to changes in 
exchange rates. Although this would be difficult for Canada and Mexico to accept politically, in 
the long run we could see one currency for all of North America.

Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-dR)
The potential benefits from freer trade induced another trading bloc between the United States 
and six far smaller economies. The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) 
was established in 2006 between the United States and Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Nicaragua, and, later, the Dominican Republic.
Prior to its creation, CAFTA-DR nations had already traded a great deal. The Central 
American nations and the Dominican Republic are already the second-largest U.S. export mar-
ket in Latin America behind Mexico. The CAFTA-DR nations represent a U.S. export market 
larger than India, Indonesia, and Russia combined. Likewise, nearly 80 percent of exports from 
the Central American nations and the Dominican Republic already enter the United States tariff 
free. And Central American nations have already cut average tariffs from 45 percent in 1985 to 
around 7 percent today. The combined value of goods traded between the United States and the 
six other CAFTA-DR countries is around $39 billion.11
The agreement benefits the United States in several ways. CAFTA-DR aims to reduce tariff 
and nontariff barriers against U.S. exports to the region. It also ensures that U.S. companies are 
not disadvantaged by Central American nations’ trade agreements with Mexico, Canada, and 
other countries. The agreement also requires the Central American nations and the Dominican 
Republic to reform their legal and business environments to encourage competition and 
investment, protect intellectual property rights, and promote transparency and the rule of law. 
CAFTA-DR is also designed to support U.S. national security interests by advancing regional 
integration, peace, and stability.
Andean Community (CAn)
Attempts at integration among Latin American countries had a rocky beginning. The first try, 
the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA), was formed in 1961. The agreement first 
called for the creation of a free trade area by 1971 but then extended that date to 1980. Yet 
because of a crippling debt crisis in South America and a reluctance of member nations to do 
away with protectionism, the agreement was doomed to an early demise. Disappointment with 
LAFTA led to the creation of two other regional trading blocs—the Andean Community and the 
Latin American Integration Association.
Formed in 1969, the Andean Community (in Spanish Comunidad Andina de Naciones, or CAN) 
includes four South American countries located in the Andes mountain range—Bolivia, Colombia, 
here, a man shows a basket of 
freshly harvested coffee beans

trade agreements, CaFta-dr 
has supporters as well as 
detractors. supporters say 
the agreement will encourage 
trade efficiency and promote 
investment that will bring 
good-paying jobs to the 
region. others fear that the 
agreement will benefit large 
U.s. companies and badly 
damage small businesses 
and farmers across Central 
america.

Ecuador, and Peru (see Map 8.1). Today, the Andean Community (www.comunidadandina.org) 
comprises a market of around 97 million consumers and a combined GDP of about $220 billion. 
The main objectives of the group include tariff reduction for trade among member nations, a com-
mon external tariff, and common policies in both transportation and certain industries. The Andean 
Community had the ambitious goal of establishing a common market by 1995, but delays mean that 
it remains a somewhat incomplete customs union.
Several factors hamper progress. Political ideology among member nations is somewhat 
hostile to the concept of free markets and favors a good deal of government involvement in busi-
ness affairs. Also, inherent distrust among members makes lower tariffs and more open trade 
hard to achieve. The common market will be difficult to implement within the framework of 
the Andean Community. One reason is that each country has been given significant exceptions 
in the tariff structure that they have in place for trade with nonmember nations. Another reason 
is that countries continue to sign agreements with just one or two countries outside the Andean 
Community framework. Independent actions impair progress internally and hurt the credibility 
of the Andean Community with the rest of the world.
southern Common Market (MERCOsUR)
The Southern Common Market (in Spanish El Mercado Comun del Sur, or MERCOSUR) was 
 established in 1988 between Argentina and Brazil but expanded to include Paraguay and Uruguay 
in 1991 and Venezuela in 2006. Associate members of MERCOSUR (www.mercosur.int) include 
Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru (see Map 8.1). Mexico has been granted observer 
status in the bloc.
Today, MERCOSUR acts as a customs union and boasts a market of more than 275 million 
consumers (nearly half of Latin America’s total population) and a GDP of around $3.5 trillion. 
Its first years of existence were very successful, with trade among members growing nearly 
fourfold. MERCOSUR is progressing on trade and investment liberalization and is emerging as 
the most powerful trading bloc in all of Latin America. Latin America’s large consumer base and 
its potential as a low-cost production platform for worldwide export appeal to both the European 
Union and the United States.
Central America and the Caribbean
Attempts at economic integration in Central American countries and throughout the Caribbean 
basin have been much more modest than efforts elsewhere in the Americas. Nevertheless, let’s 
look at two efforts at integration in these two regions—CARICOM and CACM.
CARIBBEAn COMMUnITy And COMMOn MARkET (CARICOM) The Caribbean Community 
and Common Market (CARICOM) trading bloc was formed in 1973. There are 15 full members, 
5 associate members, and 8 observers active in CARICOM (www.caricom.org). Although the 
Bahamas is a member of the community, it does not belong to the common market. As a whole, 
CARICOM has a combined GDP of nearly $30 billion and a market of almost 16 million people.
A key CARICOM agreement calls for the establishment of a CARICOM Single Market, 
which would permit the free movement of factors of production including goods, services, capi-
tal, and labor. The main difficulty CARICOM will continue to face is that most members trade 
more with nonmembers than they do with one another simply because members do not have the 
imports each other needs.
CEnTRAL AMERICAn COMMOn MARkET (CACM) The Central American Common Market 
(CACM) was formed in 1961 to create a common market among Costa Rica, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Together, the members of CACM (www.sieca.org.gt) 
comprise a market of 30 million consumers and have a combined GDP of about $200 billion. The 
common market was never realized, however, because of a long war between El Salvador and 
Honduras and guerrilla conflicts in several countries. Yet, renewed peace is creating more business 
confidence and optimism, which is driving double-digit growth in trade between members.
Furthermore, the group has not yet created a customs union. External tariffs among 
 members range between 4 and 12 percent. The tentative nature of cooperation was obvious when 
Honduras and Nicaragua slapped punitive tariffs on each other’s goods during a recent dispute. 
But officials remain positive, saying that their ultimate goal is European-style integration, closer 

246  
part 3 • international trade and investment
political ties, and adoption of a single currency—probably the dollar. In fact, El Salvador has 
adopted the U.S. dollar as its official currency, and Guatemala already uses the dollar alongside 
its own currency, the quetzal.
Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)
A truly daunting trading bloc would be the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas 
(FTAA). The objective of the FTAA (www.alca-ftaa.org) is to create the largest free trade area 
on the planet, stretching from the northern tip of Alaska to the southern tip of Tierra del Fuego, 
in South America. The FTAA would comprise 34 nations and 830 million consumers, with Cuba 
being the only Western Hemisphere nation excluded from participating. The FTAA would work 
alongside existing trading blocs throughout the region.
The first official meeting, the 1994 Summit of the Americas, created the broad blueprint for 
the agreement. Nations reaffirmed their commitment to the FTAA at the Second Summit of the 
Americas four years later when negotiations began. The Third Summit of the Americas in 2001 
met with fierce protests. The ambitious plan of the FTAA means that it will likely be many years 
before such an agreement would be realized.

Integration in Asia and Elsewhere
Efforts toward economic and political integration outside Europe and the Americas tend to be 
looser arrangements. Let’s take a look at important coalitions in Asia, the Middle East, and 
Africa.
Association of southeast Asian nations (AsEAn)
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand formed the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967. Brunei joined in 1984, Vietnam in 1995, Laos and Myanmar in 
1997, and Cambodia in 1998 (see Map 8.1). Together, the 10 ASEAN (www.asean.org) countries 
comprise a market of nearly 600 million consumers and a GDP of nearly $2.4 trillion. The three 
main objectives of the alliance are to (1) promote economic, cultural, and social development in 
the region; (2) safeguard the region’s economic and political stability; and (3) serve as a forum in 
which differences can be resolved fairly and peacefully.
The decision to admit Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar was criticized by some Western 
nations. The concern regarding Laos and Cambodia being admitted stems from their roles in 
supporting the communists during the Vietnam War. The quarrel with Myanmar centered on 
evidence cited by the West of its human rights violations. Yet, ASEAN felt that adding these 
countries to the coalition could help it to counter China’s rising strength, resources of cheap 
labor, and abundant raw materials.
Companies involved in Asia’s developing economies are likely to be doing business with 
an ASEAN member. This is even a more likely prospect as China, Japan, and South Korea 
accelerate their efforts to join ASEAN. China’s admission would allow the club to bridge the 
gap between less advanced and more advanced economies. Some key facts about ASEAN that 
companies should consider are contained in the Manager’s Briefcase, titled “The Ins and Outs 
of ASEAN.”
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
The organization for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) was formed in 1989. Begun as 
an informal forum among 12 trading partners, APEC (www.apec.org) now has 21 members (see 
Map 8.1). Together, the APEC nations account for more than 40 percent of world trade and have 
a combined GDP of about $32 trillion.

 
Chapter 8 • regional eConomiC integration  247
The stated aim of APEC is not to build another trading bloc. Instead, it desires to strengthen 
the multilateral trading system and expand the global economy by simplifying and liberalizing 
trade and investment procedures among member nations. In the long term, APEC hopes to have 
completely free trade and investment throughout the region by 2020.
ThE RECORd OF APEC APEC has succeeded in halving its members’ tariff rates from an 
average of 15 to 7.5 percent. The early years saw the greatest progress, but liberalization 
received a setback when the Asian financial crisis struck in the late 1990s. APEC is at least as 
much a political body as it is a movement toward freer trade. After all, APEC certainly does 
not have the focus or the record of accomplishments of NAFTA or the EU. Nonetheless, open 
dialogue and attempts at cooperation should continue to encourage progress, however slow.
Further progress may create some positive benefits for people doing business in APEC 
nations. APEC is changing the granting of business visas so that businesspeople can travel 
throughout the region without obtaining multiple visas. It is recommending mutual recognition 
agreements on professional qualifications so that engineers, for example, can practice in any 
APEC country, regardless of nationality. And APEC is ready to simplify and harmonize customs 
procedures. Eventually, businesses could use the same customs forms and manifests for all 
APEC economies.
Closer Economic Relations (CER) Agreement
Australia and New Zealand created a free trade agreement in 1966 and formed the Closer 
Economic Relations (CER) Agreement in 1983 to further advance free trade and integrate their 
two economies (see Map 8.1). The CER completely eliminated tariffs and quotas between 
Australia and New Zealand in 1990, five years ahead of schedule. Each nation allows goods (and 
most services) to be sold within its borders that can be legally sold in the other country. Each 
nation also recognizes most professionals who are registered to practice their occupation in the 
other country.
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
Several Middle Eastern nations formed the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1980. Members 
of the GCC are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The 
primary purpose of the GCC at its formation was to cooperate with the EU and EFTA. But it has 
evolved to become as much a political entity as an economic one. Its cooperative thrust allows 
citizens of member countries to travel freely in the GCC without visas. It also permits citizens 
of one member nation to own land, property, and businesses in any other member nation without 
the need for local sponsors or partners.
Businesses unfamiliar with operating in ASEAN countries should 
exercise caution in their dealings. Some inescapable facts about 
ASEAN that warrant consideration are the following:
• Diverse Cultures and Politics The Philippines is a represen-
tative democracy, Brunei is an oil-rich sultanate, and Vietnam 
is a state-controlled country. Business policies and protocols 
must be adapted to suit each country.
• Economic Competition Many ASEAN nations are feeling 
the effects of China’s power to attract investment from multi-
national corporations worldwide. Whereas ASEAN members 
used to attract around 30 percent of foreign direct invest-
ment into Asia’s developing economies, they now attract 
about half that amount.
• Corruption and Shadow Markets Bribery and shadow 
(unofficial) markets are common in many ASEAN countries, 
including Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Vietnam. 
Studies typically place these countries very high on the list of 
nations surveyed for corruption.
• Political Change and Turmoil Several nations in the re-
gion recently elected new leaders and some go through 
presidents at a fast clip. Companies must remain alert 
to shifting political winds and laws regarding trade and 
investment.
• Border Disputes Parts of Thailand’s borders with Cambodia 
and Laos are tested frequently. Hostilities break out sporadi-
cally between Thailand and Myanmar over border alignment 
and ethnic Shan rebels operating along the border.
• Lack of Common Tariffs and Standards Doing business in 
ASEAN nations can be costly. Harmonized tariffs, quality and 
safety standards, customs regulations, and investment rules 
could cut transaction costs significantly.

Economic Community of West African states (ECOWAs)
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) was formed in 1975 but its efforts 
at economic integration were restarted in 1992 because of a lack of early progress. The most 
important goals of ECOWAS (www.ecowas.int) include the formation of a customs union, an 
eventual common market, and a monetary union. The ECOWAS nations comprise a large por-
tion of the economic activity in sub-Saharan Africa, but progress on market integration is almost 
nonexistent. In fact, the value of trade occurring among ECOWAS nations is just 11 percent of 
the value that the trade members undertake with third parties. But ECOWAS has made progress 
in the free movement of people, construction of international roads, and development of interna-
tional telecommunication links. Some of its main problems are due to political instability, poor 
governance, weak national economies, poor infrastructure, and poor economic policies.
African Union (AU)
A group of 53 nations on the African continent joined forces in 2002 to create the African Union 
(AU). Heads of state of the nations belonging to the Organization of African Unity paved the 
way for the AU (www.au.int.en/) when they signed the Sirte Declaration in 1999.
The AU is based on the vision of a united and strong Africa and on the need to build a part-
nership among governments and all segments of civil society in order to strengthen cohesion 
among the peoples of Africa. Its ambitious goals are to promote peace, security, and stability 
across Africa and to accelerate economic and political integration while addressing problems 
compounded by globalization. Specifically, the stated aims of the AU are to (1) rid the continent 
of the remaining vestiges of colonialism and apartheid, (2) promote unity and solidarity among 
African states, (3) coordinate and intensify cooperation for development, (4) safeguard the sov-
ereignty and territorial integrity of members, and (5) promote international cooperation within 
the framework of the United Nations. Although it is too early to judge the success of the AU, 
there is no shortage of opportunities for it to demonstrate its capabilities.

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Outline the levels of economic integration and its debate.
• There are five levels of regional economic integration, with each level signifying 
greater cooperation among nations: free trade area, customs union, common market, 
economic union, and political union.
• Arguments for free trade include: (1) trade creation expands buyer selection, de-
creases prices, increases productivity, and boosts national competitiveness; (2) 
greater consensus to reduce barriers among smaller groups of nations; (3) political 
cooperation can enhance negotiating power, and reduce potential military conflict; 
and (4) corporate savings can arise from modifying strategies and eliminating dupli-
cate factories.
• Arguments against free trade include: (1) trade diversion can result in increased trade 
with a less-efficient producer within the trading bloc; (2) jobs are lost when factories 
R
egional economic integration can expand buyer selection, 
lower prices, increase productivity, and boost national com-
petitiveness. Yet integration has its drawbacks, and governments 
and independent organizations work to counter those negative ef-
fects. Here, we review regional integration as it relates to business 
 operations and employment.
Integration and Business Operations
Regional trade agreements are changing the landscape of the 
global marketplace. They are lowering trade barriers and open-
ing up new markets for goods and services. Markets otherwise 
off-limits because tariffs made imported products too expensive 
can become attractive after tariffs are lifted. But trade agreements 
can also be double-edged swords for companies. Not only do 
they  allow domestic companies to seek new markets abroad, they 
also let competitors from other nations enter the domestic market. 
Such mobility increases competition in every market that partici-
pates in such an agreement.
Despite increased competition that often accompanies re-
gional integration, there can be economic benefits, such as those 
provided by a single currency. Companies in the European Union 
clearly benefit from its common currency, the euro. First, charges 
for converting from one member nation’s currency to that of an-
other can be avoided. Second, business owners need not worry 
about potential losses due to shifting exchange rates on cross-
border deals. Not having to cover such costs and risks frees up 
capital for greater investment. Third, the euro makes prices be-
tween markets more transparent, making it more difficult to charge 
different prices in different markets. This helps companies compare 
prices among suppliers of a raw material, intermediate product, or 
service.
Another benefit is lower tariffs or none at all. This allows a mul-
tinational company to reduce its number of factories that supply a 
region and thereby reap economies of scale benefits. This is pos-
sible because a company can produce in one location and then 
ship products throughout the low-tariff region at little additional 
cost. This lowers costs and increases productivity.
One potential drawback of regional integration is that lower 
tariffs between members of a trading bloc can result in trade diver-
sion. This can increase trade with less-efficient producers within 
the trading bloc and reduce trade with more-efficient nonmem-
ber producers. Unless there is other internal competition for the 
producer’s good or service, buyers will likely pay more after trade 
diversion.
Integration and Employment
Perhaps most controversial is the impact of regional integration on 
jobs. Companies can affect the job environment by contributing to 
dislocations in labor markets. The nation that supplies a particular 
good or service within a trading bloc is likely to be the most-
efficient producer. When that product is labor intensive, the cost of 
labor in that market is likely to be quite low. Competitors in other 
nations may shift production to that relatively lower-wage nation 
within the trading bloc to remain competitive. This can mean lost 
jobs in the relatively higher-wage nation.
Yet job dislocation can be an opportunity for workers to up-
grade their skills and gain more advanced training. This can help 
nations increase their competitiveness because a more educated 
and skilled workforce attracts higher-paying jobs. An opportunity 
for a nation to improve its competitiveness, however, is little con-
solation to people finding themselves suddenly out of work.
Although there are drawbacks to integration, there are poten-
tial gains from increased trade such as raising living standards. 
Regional economic integration efforts are likely to continue rolling 
back barriers to international trade and investment because of 
their potential benefits.

sovereignty is diminished due to increased exposure to other cultures.
 LO2. Describe integration in Europe and its enlargement.
• The European Coal and Steel Community formed in 1951 to remove trade barriers 
for coal, iron, steel, and scrap metal among the member nations. Following waves 
of expansion, broadenings of its scope, and name changes, the community is now 
known as the European Union (EU) and it has 28 members.
• Five main institutions of the EU are the European Parliament, European 
Commission, Council of the European Union, Court of Justice, and Court of 
Auditors. The EU single currency has been adopted by 18 member nations, which 
benefit from no exchange-rate risk and currency conversion costs within the 
euro zone.
• The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) has four members and was created to 
focus on trade in industrial goods.
 LO3. Describe integration in the Americas and its prospects.
• The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) began in 1994 among Canada, 
Mexico, and the United States; it seeks to eliminate all tariffs and nontariff trade 
 barriers on goods originating from within North America. The Central American 
Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) was established in 2006 between the United 
States and six Central American nations to boost the efficiency of trade.
• The Andean Community was formed in 1969 and calls for tariff reduction for trade 
among member nations, a common external tariff, and common policies in transpor-
tation and certain industries. The Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), estab-
lished in 1988, acts as a customs union.
• The Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) trading bloc was formed 
in 1973, and the Central American Common Market (CACM) was formed in 1961.
 LO4. Summarize integration in Asia and elsewhere.
• The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) formed in 1967 and seeks to: 
(1) promote economic, cultural, and social development; (2) safeguard economic and 
political stability; and (3) serve as a forum to resolve differences peacefully.
• The organization for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) was formed in 
1989 and strives to strengthen the multilateral trading system and expand the global 
economy. The Closer Economic Relations (CER) Agreement in 1983 between 
Australia and New Zealand totally eliminated tariffs and quotas between the two 
economies.
• The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) of 1980 allows citizens of Middle Eastern coun-
tries to travel freely without visas and to own properties in other member nations. The 
African Union (AU) was started in 2002 among 53 nations to promote peace, security, 
and stability and to accelerate economic and political integration across Africa.

Global Food Trade: Fair Trade or Safe Consumption?
T
oday Europeans thousands of miles away from India can put 
Indian-grown mangoes on their breakfast cereal. U.S. citizens 
braving a freezing Minnesota winter can indulge their cravings 
for summer-fresh raspberries with fruit brought in from Mexico. 
Japanese shoppers can buy apples that were grown in New 
Zealand and South Africa. Advances in logistics and communica-
tion technologies and increasing regional trade pacts are giving 
consumers around the world greater choices of food products. 
Unfortunately, these forces have also made it more likely that con-
sumers will contract illnesses from food-borne pathogens.
In recent years, several outbreaks linked to the burgeon-
ing global trade in produce have made headlines. One serious 
case occurred when 2,300 people were victims of a parasite 
called cyclospora that had hitched a ride on raspberries grown in 
Guatemala. Outbreaks of hepatitis A and Salmonella from tainted 
strawberries and alfalfa sprouts, respectively, have also sickened 
consumers. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS) killed hundreds and sickened hundreds more, mainly 
in China, Singapore, and Canada. Some scientists believe a fair 
amount of those cases might actually have been cases of H5N1, 
also called avian (bird) flu. Avian flu is particularly virulent and 
can cross barriers between species. It is most likely transmitted 
through the handling of poultry and poor sanitation.
Although health officials say that there is no evidence that 
imports are inherently more dangerous, they do cite several rea-
sons for concern. For one thing, produce is often imported from 
less-advanced countries where food hygiene and sanitation are 
lacking. Also, some microbes that cause no damage in their home 
country can be deadly when introduced in other countries. Finally, 
the longer the journey from farm to table, the greater the chance of 
contamination. Just consider the journey taken by the salmonella-
ridden alfalfa sprouts: the seeds for the sprouts were bought from 
Uganda and Pakistan, among other nations, shipped through the 
Netherlands, flown into New York, trucked to retailers across the 
United States, and then purchased by consumers.
Incidences of food contamination show no signs of abating. 
Since the creation of the EU in 1993, cross-border trade between 
the growing number of member states has skyrocketed. So too have 
the incidences of food scares. In 2006, for example, more than 650 
farms in Belgium and the Netherlands were forced to quarantine 
their pigs and poultry after a dioxin contamination crisis. It was 
revealed that some of the contaminated meat had actually made its 
way into shops and South Korea, the most important non-EU desti-
nation for pork from both countries, banned all imports.
As the influence of individual European country food- 
monitoring administrations has diminished, food-buying groups 
have set up their own regulatory powers. The Euro Retailer Produce 
Working Group, or EUREP, which began in Europe, now includes 
giant food companies worldwide. However, critics say that the food 
groups are more interested in commercial concerns and can easily 
drown out the efforts of any administrative agencies such as the 
EU’s European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
Although it isn’t feasible for the EU to plant EFSA inspec-
tors in every country that imports and exports food, options are 
available. The EU could place further bans on imports from 
countries that fail to meet accepted food-safety standards. Better 
inspections could be performed of farming methods and gov-
ernment safety systems in other countries. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) also proposes new policies for food safety, 
such as introducing food irradiation and other technologies.
Thinking Globally
 8-16. How do you think countries with a high volume of exports 
to the EU would respond to the introduction of any stricter 
food-safety rules? Do you think such measures are a good 
way to stem the tide of food-related illnesses? Why or 
why not?
 8-17. Sue Doneth of Marshall, Michigan, is a mother of a 
 schoolchild who was exposed to the hepatitis A virus after 
eating tainted frozen strawberry desserts. Speaking before 
Congress, she said, “We are forcing consumers to trade the 
health and safety of their families for free trade. That is not 
fair trade. NAFTA is not a trade issue: it is a safety issue.” 
Do you think food-safety regulations should be built into an 
extension of NAFTA or the EFSA? Why or why not? What 
are the benefits and drawbacks of putting food-safety regu-
lations into international trade pacts?
 8-18. The lack of harmonized food-safety practices and standards 
is just one of the challenges faced by the food industry as it 
becomes more global. What other challenges face the food 
industry in an era of economic integration and opening 
markets?

Wii Is the Champion
KYOTO, Japan—Nintendo (www.nintendo.com) has been feeding the addiction of 
video-gaming fans worldwide since 1989. One hundred years earlier, in 1889, Fusajiro 
Yamauchi started Nintendo when he began manufacturing Hanafuda playing cards 
in Kyoto, Japan. Today, Nintendo produces and sells mobile gaming devices and 
home gaming systems, including Wii U, Wii, Nintendo DS, GameCube, and Game 
Boy Advance, which feature such 
global icons as Mario, Donkey Kong, 
Pokémon, and others.
Nintendo took the global gam-
ing industry by storm when it intro-
duced the Wii game console. With 
wireless motion-sensitive remote con-
trollers, built-in Wi-Fi capability, and 
other features, the Wii outdid Sony’s 
PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox 
game consoles. Nintendo’s Wii Fit 
game forces players through 40 exer-
cises consisting of yoga, strength train-
ing, cardio, and even the hula-hoop. 
Pictured here, several people play “Just 
Dance 2015,” a game for the Wii U 
and Wii at the electronic entertainment 
expo (E3) in Los Angeles, California.
Yet, Nintendo’s marketing and 
game-design talents are not all that affect 
its performance—so, too, do exchange 
rates between the Japanese yen (¥) and other currencies. The earnings of Nintendo’s subsid-
iaries and affiliates outside Japan must be integrated into consolidated financial statements 
at the end of each year. Translating subsidiaries’ earnings from other currencies into a strong 
yen decreases Nintendo’s stated earnings in yen.
Nintendo recently reported an annual net income of ¥ 257.3 billion ($2.6 billion), 
but it also reported that its income included a foreign exchange loss of ¥ 92.3 billion 
($923.5 million). A rise of the yen against foreign currencies prior to the translation of 
subsidiaries’ earnings into yen caused the loss. As you read this chapter, consider how 
shifting currency values affect financial performance and how managers can reduce 
their impact.1

Well-functioning financial markets are an essential element of the international business en-
vironment. They funnel money from organizations and economies with excess funds to those 
with shortages. International financial markets also allow companies to exchange one currency 
for another. The trading of currencies and the rates at which they are exchanged are crucial to 
international business.
Suppose you purchase an MP3 player imported from a company based in the Philippines. 
Whether you realize it or not, the price you paid for that MP3 player was affected by the ex-
change rate between your country’s currency and the Philippine peso. Ultimately, the Filipino 
company that sold you the MP3 player must convert the purchase made in your currency into 
Philippine pesos. Thus, the profit earned by the Filipino company is also influenced by the 
exchange rate between your currency and the peso. Managers must understand how changes 
in currency values—and thus in exchange rates—affect the profitability of their international 
business activities. Among other things, our hypothetical company in the Philippines must know 
how much to charge you for its MP3 player.
In this chapter, we launch our study of the international financial system by exploring the 
structure of the international financial markets. The two interrelated systems that comprise the 
international financial markets are the international capital market and foreign exchange market. 
We start by examining the purposes of the international capital market and tracing its recent de-
velopment. We then take a detailed look at the international bond, equity, and Eurocurrency mar-
kets, each of which helps companies to borrow and lend money internationally. Later, we take a 
look at the functioning of the foreign exchange market—an international market for currencies 
that facilitates international business transactions. We close this chapter by exploring how cur-
rency convertibility affects international transactions.
Importance of the International Capital Market
A capital market is a system that allocates financial resources in the form of debt and equity 
according to their most efficient uses. Its main purpose is to provide a mechanism through 
which those who wish to borrow or invest money can do so efficiently. Individuals, companies, 
governments, mutual funds, pension funds, and all types of nonprofit organizations participate 
in capital markets. For example, an individual might want to buy her first home, a midsized 
company might want to add production capacity, and a government might want to support the

a safe way to wire money

prices of currencies on the 
foreign exchange market also 
help determine the prices 
of imports and exports. And 
exchange rates affect the 
amount of profit a company 
receives when it translates 
revenue earned abroad into 
the home currency.

development of a new wireless communications system. Sometimes, these individuals and orga-
nizations have excess cash to lend, and, at other times, they need funds.
Purposes of National Capital Markets
There are two primary means by which companies obtain external financing: debt and equity. 
National capital markets help individuals and institutions borrow the money that other indi-
viduals and institutions want to lend. Although in theory borrowers could search individually for 
various parties who are willing to lend or invest, this would be an extremely inefficient process.
ROLe Of DeBT Debt consists of loans, for which the borrower promises to repay the borrowed 
amount (the principal) plus a predetermined rate of interest. Company debt normally takes the 
form of bonds—instruments that specify the timing of principal and interest payments. The 
holder of a bond (the lender) can force the borrower into bankruptcy if the borrower fails to pay 
on a timely basis. Bonds issued for the purpose of funding investments are commonly issued by 
private-sector companies and by municipal, regional, and national governments.
ROLe Of equiTy Equity is part ownership of a company in which the equity holder 
participates with other part owners in the company’s financial gains and losses. Equity normally 
takes the form of stock—shares of ownership in a company’s assets that give shareholders 
(stockholders) a claim on the company’s future cash flows. Shareholders may be rewarded with 
dividends—payments made out of surplus funds—or by increases in the value of their shares. 
Of course, they may also suffer losses due to poor company performance and thus experience a 
decrease in the value of their shares. Dividend payments are not guaranteed but are determined 
by the company’s board of directors and are based on financial performance. In capital markets, 
shareholders can sell one company’s stock for that of another or can liquidate them—exchange 
them for cash. Liquidity, which is a feature of both debt and equity markets, refers to the ease 
with which bondholders and shareholders can convert their investments into cash.
Purposes of the international Capital Market
The international capital market is a network of individuals, companies, financial institutions, 
and governments that invest and borrow across national boundaries. It consists of both formal 
exchanges (in which buyers and sellers meet to trade financial instruments) and electronic net-
works (in which trading occurs anonymously). This market makes use of unique and innovative 
financial instruments specially designed to fit the needs of investors and borrowers located in 
different countries. Large international banks play a central role in the international capital mar-
ket. They gather the excess cash of investors and savers around the world and then channel this 
cash to borrowers across the globe.
exPANDs The MONey suPPLy fOR BORROweRs The international capital market is a 
conduit for joining borrowers and lenders in different national capital markets. A company that 
is unable to obtain funds from investors in its own nation can seek financing from investors 
elsewhere. The option of going outside the home nation is particularly important to firms in 
countries with small or developing capital markets of their own.
ReDuCes The COsT Of MONey fOR BORROweRs An expanded money supply reduces the 
cost of borrowing. Similar to the prices of potatoes, wheat, and other commodities, the “price” 
of money is determined by supply and demand. If its supply increases, its price—in the form 
of interest rates—falls. That is why excess supply creates a borrower’s market, forcing down 
interest rates and the cost of borrowing. Projects regarded as infeasible because of low expected 
returns might be viable at a lower cost of financing.
ReDuCes Risk fOR LeNDeRs The international capital market expands the available set of 
lending opportunities. In turn, an expanded set of opportunities helps reduce risk for lenders 
(investors) in two ways:
 1. Investors enjoy a greater set of opportunities from which to choose. They can thus 
reduce overall portfolio risk by spreading their money over a greater number of debt and 
equity instruments. In other words, if one investment loses money, the loss can be offset by 
gains elsewhere.

 2. Investing in international securities benefits investors because some economies are 
growing while others are in decline. For example, the prices of bonds in Thailand may 
follow a pattern that is different from bond-price fluctuations in the United States. Thus, 
investors reduce risk by holding international securities whose prices move independently.
Would-be borrowers in developing nations often face difficulties trying to secure loans. 
Interest rates are often high, and borrowers typically have little or nothing to put up as collateral. 
For some unique methods of getting capital to small business owners in developing nations, see 
this chapter’s Global Sustainability feature, titled “Big Results from Microfinance.”
forces expanding the international Capital Market
Around 40 years ago, national capital markets functioned largely as independent markets. But 
since that time, the amount of debt, equity, and currencies traded internationally has increased 
dramatically. This rapid growth can be traced to three main factors:
• Information Technology Information is the lifeblood of every nation’s capital market 
because investors need information about investment opportunities and their corresponding 
risk levels. Large investments in information technology over the past two decades have 
drastically reduced the costs, in both time and money, of communicating around the globe. 
Investors and borrowers can now respond in record time to events in the international 
capital market. The introduction of electronic trading that can occur after the daily close of 
formal exchanges also facilitates faster response times.
• Deregulation Deregulation of national capital markets has been instrumental in the ex-
pansion of the international capital market. The need for deregulation became apparent in 
the early 1970s, when heavily regulated markets in the largest countries were facing fierce 
competition from less regulated markets in smaller nations. Deregulation increased com-
petition, lowered the cost of financial transactions, and opened many national markets to 
global investing and borrowing. But the pendulum is now swinging the other direction as 
legislators demand tighter regulation to help avoid another global financial crisis like that 
of 2008–2009.2
• Financial Instruments Greater competition in the financial industry is creating the 
need to develop innovative financial instruments. One result of the need for new types of 
financial instruments is securitization—the unbundling and repackaging of hard-to-trade 
securitization
Unbundling and repackaging of 
hard-to-trade financial assets 
into more liquid, negotiable, and 
marketable financial instruments 
(or securities).
• No Glass Ceiling Here Although outreach to male borrowers 
is increasing, most microfinance borrowers are female. Women 
tend to be better at funneling profits into family nutrition, cloth-
ing, and education, as well as into business expansion. The suc-
cessful use of microfinance in Bangladesh has increased wages, 
community income, and the status of women. The microfinance 
industry is estimated at around $8 billion worldwide.
• Developed Country Agenda The microfinance concept 
was pioneered in Bangladesh as a way for developing coun-
tries to create the foundation for a market economy. It now 
might be a way to spur economic growth in depressed areas 
of developed nations, such as in decaying city centers. But 
whereas microfinance loans in developing countries typically 
average about $350, those in developed nations would need 
to be significantly larger.

Developing nations are teeming with budding entrepreneurs who 
need a bit of start-up capital to get going. A practice called micro-
finance has several key characteristics.
• Overcoming Obstacles If a person in a developing country 
is lucky enough to obtain a loan, it is typically from a loan 
shark, whose sky-high interest rates devour most of the entre-
preneur’s profits. Thus, microfinance is an increasingly popu-
lar alternative to lend money to low-income entrepreneurs at 
competitive interest rates (around 10 to 20 percent) without 
requiring collateral. Now institutions are warming to the idea 
of “microsavings” so that people can manage their small but 
highly uneven flows of income over time.
• One for All, and All for One Sometimes a loan is made 
to a group of entrepreneurs who sink or swim together. 
If one member fails to pay off a loan, all members of the 
group may lose future credit. Peer pressure and support 
often defend against defaults, however. Support networks 
in developing countries often incorporate extended family 
ties. One bank in Bangladesh boasts 98 percent on-time 
repayment.

financial assets into more liquid, negotiable, and marketable financial instruments (or 
securities). For example, a mortgage loan from a bank is not liquid or negotiable because 
it is a customized contract between the bank and the borrower. But agencies of the U.S. 
government, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (www.fanniemae.com), 
guarantee mortgages against default and accumulate them as pools of assets. Securities 
that are backed by these mortgage pools are then sold in capital markets to raise capital  
for investment.
Securitization is criticized for the excessive debt that financial institutions took on in the 
boom years prior to 2007. When investors lost faith in securities backed by sub-prime mort-
gages, they sold their investments and helped spark the global credit crisis of 2008–2009. 
Although the trigger for the crisis was lost value in mortgage-backed securities, legislators soon 
began exploring the option of placing reasonable limits on securitization in order to discourage 
an appetite for excessive levels of debt.3

world financial Centers
The world’s three most important financial centers are London, New York, and Tokyo. But tradi-
tional exchanges may become obsolete unless they continue to modernize, cut costs, and provide 
new customer services. In fact, trading over the Internet and other systems might increase the 
popularity of offshore financial centers.
OffshORe fiNANCiAL CeNTeRs An offshore financial center is a country or territory whose 
financial sector features very few regulations and few, if any, taxes. These centers tend to be 
economically and politically stable and tend to provide access to the international capital market 
through an excellent telecommunications infrastructure. Most governments protect their own 
currencies by restricting the amount of activity that domestic companies can conduct in foreign 
currencies. So, companies that find it hard to borrow funds in foreign currencies can turn to 
offshore centers. Offshore centers are sources of (usually cheaper) funding for companies with 
multinational operations.
Offshore financial centers fall into two categories:
• Operational centers see a great deal of financial activity. Prominent operational centers 
include London (which does a good deal of currency trading) and Switzerland (which sup-
plies a great deal of investment capital to other nations).
• Booking centers are usually located on small island nations or territories with favorable 
tax and/or secrecy laws. Little financial activity takes place here. Rather, funds simply 
pass through on their way to large operational centers. Booking centers are typically home 
to offshore branches of domestic banks that use them merely as bookkeeping facilities to 
record tax and currency-exchange information. Some important booking centers are the 
Cayman Islands and the Bahamas in the Caribbean; Gibraltar, Monaco, and the Channel 
Islands in Europe; Bahrain and Dubai in the Middle East; and Singapore in Southeast Asia.

International Capital Market Components
Now that we have covered the basic features of the international capital market, let’s take a closer 
look at its main components: the international bond, international equity, and Eurocurrency 
markets.
international Bond Market
The international bond market consists of all bonds sold by issuing companies, governments, 
or other organizations outside their own countries. Issuing bonds internationally is an increas-
ingly popular way to obtain needed funding. Typical buyers include medium-sized to large 
banks, pension funds, mutual funds, and governments with excess financial reserves. Large 
international banks typically manage the sales of new international bond issues for corporate and 
government clients.
TyPes Of iNTeRNATiONAL BONDs One instrument used by companies to access the 
international bond market is called a Eurobond—a bond issued outside the country in 
whose currency it is denominated. In other words, a bond issued by a Venezuelan company, 
denominated in U.S. dollars, and sold in Britain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands (but 
not available in the United States or to its residents) is a Eurobond. Because this Eurobond 
is denominated in U.S. dollars, the Venezuelan borrower both receives dollars and makes its 
interest payments in dollars.
Eurobonds are popular (accounting for 75 to 80 percent of all international bonds) because 
the governments of countries in which they are sold do not regulate them. The absence of regula-
tion substantially reduces the cost of issuing a bond. Unfortunately, it increases its risk level—a 
fact that may discourage some potential investors. The traditional markets for Eurobonds are 
Europe and North America.
Companies also obtain financial resources by issuing so-called foreign bonds—bonds sold 
outside the borrower’s country and denominated in the currency of the country in which they are 
sold. For example, a yen-denominated bond issued by the German carmaker BMW in Japan’s 
domestic bond market is a foreign bond. Foreign bonds account for about 20 to 25 percent of all 
international bonds.
Foreign bonds are subject to the same rules and regulations as the domestic bonds of the 
country in which they are issued. Countries typically require issuers to meet certain regulatory 
requirements and to disclose details about company activities, owners, and upper management. 
Thus BMW’s samurai bonds (the name for foreign bonds issued in Japan) would need to meet 
the same disclosure and other regulatory requirements that Toyota’s bonds in Japan must meet. 
Foreign bonds in the United States are called yankee bonds, and those in the United Kingdom 
are called bulldog bonds. Foreign bonds issued and traded in Asia outside Japan (and normally 
denominated in dollars) are called dragon bonds.
iNTeResT RATes: A DRiviNG fORCe Today, low interest rates (the cost of borrowing) fuel 
growth in the international bond market. Unfortunately, low interest rates in developed nations 
mean that investors earn relatively little interest on bonds in those markets. So, banks, pension 
funds, and mutual funds are seeking higher returns in emerging markets, where higher interest 
payments reflect the greater risk of the bonds. At the same time, corporate and government 
borrowers in emerging markets badly need capital to invest in corporate expansion plans and 
public works projects.
This situation raises an interesting question: How can investors who are seeking higher 
returns and borrowers who are seeking to pay lower interest rates both come out ahead? The 
answer, at least in part, lies in the international bond market:
• By issuing bonds in the international bond market, borrowers from emerging markets can 
borrow money from other nations where interest rates are lower.
• By the same token, investors in developed countries buy bonds in emerging markets in or-
der to obtain higher returns on their investments (although they also accept greater risk).
Despite the attraction of the international bond market, many emerging markets see the 
need to develop their own national markets because of volatility in the global currency market. 
A currency whose value is rapidly declining can wreak havoc on companies that earn profits in,

say, Indonesian rupiahs but must pay off debts in dollars. Why? A drop in a country’s currency 
forces borrowers to shell out more local currency in order to pay off the interest owed on bonds 
denominated in a stable currency.
international equity Market
The international equity market consists of all stocks bought and sold outside the issuer’s 
home country. Companies and governments frequently sell shares in the international equity 
market. Buyers include other companies, banks, mutual funds, pension funds, and individual 
investors. The stock exchanges that list the greatest number of companies from outside their own 
borders are Frankfurt, London, and New York. Large international companies frequently list 
their stocks on several national exchanges simultaneously and sometimes offer new stock issues 
only outside their country’s borders. Four factors are responsible for much of the past growth in 
the international equity market, discussed in the following sections.
sPReAD Of PRivATizATiON As many countries abandoned central planning and socialist-
style economics, the pace of privatization accelerated worldwide. A single privatization often 
places billions of dollars of new equity on stock markets. When the government of Peru sold 
its 26-percent share of the national telephone company, Telefonica del Peru (www.telefonica.
com.pe), it raised $1.2 billion. Of the total value of the sale, 26 percent went to domestic retail 
and institutional investors in Peru, but 48 percent was sold to investors in the United States and 
26 percent was sold to other international investors.
eCONOMiC GROwTh iN eMeRGiNG MARkeTs Continued economic growth in emerging 
markets is contributing to growth in the international equity market. Companies based in these 
economies require greater investment as they succeed and grow. The international equity market 
becomes a major source of funding because only a limited supply of funds is available in these 
nations.
ACTiviTy Of iNvesTMeNT BANks Global banks facilitate the sale of a company’s stock 
worldwide by bringing together sellers and large potential buyers. Increasingly, investment banks 
are searching for investors outside the national market in which a company is headquartered. In 
fact, this method of raising funds is becoming more common than listing a company’s shares on 
another country’s stock exchange.
ADveNT Of CyBeRMARkeTs The automation of stock exchanges is encouraging growth in 
the international equity market. The term cybermarkets denotes stock markets that have no 
central geographic locations. Rather, they consist of global trading activities conducted on the 
Internet. Cybermarkets (consisting of supercomputers, high-speed data lines, satellite uplinks, 
and individual personal computers) match buyers and sellers in nanoseconds. They allow 
companies to list their stocks worldwide through an electronic medium in which trading takes 
place 24 hours a day.
eurocurrency Market
All the world’s currencies that are banked outside their countries of origin are referred to as 
Eurocurrency and trade on the Eurocurrency market. Thus, U.S. dollars deposited in a bank in 
Tokyo are called Eurodollars, and British pounds deposited in New York are called Europounds. 
Japanese yen deposited in Frankfurt are called Euroyen, and so forth.
Because the Eurocurrency market is characterized by very large transactions, only the very 
largest companies, banks, and governments are typically involved. Deposits originate primarily 
from four sources:
• Governments with excess funds generated by a prolonged trade surplus
• Commercial banks with large deposits of excess currency
• International companies with large amounts of excess cash
• Extremely wealthy individuals
Eurocurrency originated in Europe during the 1950s—hence the “Euro” prefix. Governments 
across Eastern Europe feared they might forfeit dollar deposits made in U.S. banks if U.S. citi-
zens were to file claims against them. To protect their dollar reserves, they deposited them in

banks across Europe. Banks in the United Kingdom began lending these dollars to finance 
international trade deals, and banks in other countries (including Canada and Japan) followed 
suit. The Eurocurrency market is valued at around $6 trillion, with London accounting for about 
20 percent of all deposits. Other important markets include Canada, the Caribbean, Hong Kong, 
and Singapore.
APPeAL Of The euROCuRReNCy MARkeT Governments tend to strictly regulate commercial 
banking activities in their own currencies within their borders. For example, they often force 
banks to pay deposit insurance to a central bank, where they must keep a certain portion of 
all deposits “on reserve” in noninterest-bearing accounts. Although such restrictions protect 
investors, they add costs to banking operations. By contrast, the main appeal of the Eurocurrency 
market is the complete absence of regulation, which lowers the cost of banking. The large size of 
transactions in this market further reduces transaction costs. Thus, banks can charge borrowers 
less, pay investors more, and still earn healthy profits.
Interbank interest rates—rates that the world’s largest banks charge one another for 
loans—are determined in the free market. The most commonly quoted rate of this type in 
the Eurocurrency market is the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR)—the interest rate that 
London banks charge other large banks that borrow Eurocurrency. The London Interbank Bid 
Rate (LIBID) is the interest rate offered by London banks to large investors for Eurocurrency 
deposits.
An unappealing feature of the Eurocurrency market is greater risk; government regula-
tions that protect depositors in national markets are nonexistent here. Despite the greater risk of 
default, however, Eurocurrency transactions are fairly safe because the banks involved are large, 
with well-established reputations.

 1. What type of financial instrument is traded in the international bond market?
 2. The market of all stocks bought and sold outside the issuer’s home country is called what?
 3. What does the Eurocurrency market consist of?
The Foreign Exchange Market
Unlike domestic transactions, international transactions involve the currencies of two or more 
nations. To exchange one currency for another in international transactions, companies rely on 
a mechanism called the foreign exchange market—a market in which currencies are bought 
and sold and their prices are determined. Financial institutions can convert currencies using an 
exchange rate—the rate at which one currency is exchanged for another. Rates depend on the 
size of the transaction, the trader conducting it, general economic conditions, and, sometimes, 
government mandate.
The forces of supply and demand determine currency prices, and transactions are conducted 
through a process of bid and ask quotes. If someone asks for the current exchange rate of a cer-
tain currency, the bank does not know whether it is dealing with a prospective buyer or seller 
so it quotes two rates. The bid quote is the price at which the bank will buy. The ask quote is 
the price at which the bank will sell. For example, say that the British pound is quoted in U.S. 
 dollars at $1.5054. The bank may then bid $1.5052 to buy British pounds and offer to sell them 
at $1.5056. The difference between the two rates is the bid–ask spread. Naturally, banks will buy 
currencies at a lower price than they sell them and earn their profits from the bid–ask spread.
functions of the foreign exchange Market
The foreign exchange market is not really a source of corporate finance. Rather, it facilitates 
corporate financial activities and international transactions. Investors use the foreign exchange 
market for four main reasons, as discussed in the following sections.
CuRReNCy CONveRsiON Companies use the foreign exchange market to convert one currency 
into another. Suppose a Malaysian company sells a large number of computers to a customer 
in France. The French customer wants to pay for the computers in euros, the European Union

currency, whereas the Malaysian company wants to be paid in its own ringgit. How do the two 
parties resolve this dilemma? They turn to banks that will exchange the currencies for them.
Companies also must convert to local currencies when they undertake foreign direct invest-
ment. Later, when a firm’s international subsidiary earns a profit and the company wants to 
return some of it to the home country, it must convert the local money into the home currency.
CuRReNCy heDGiNG The practice of insuring against potential losses that result from adverse 
changes in exchange rates is called currency hedging. International companies commonly use 
hedging for one of two purposes:
 1. To lessen the risk associated with international transfers of funds
 2. To protect themselves in credit transactions in which there is a time lag between billing and 
receipt of payment
Suppose a South Korean automaker has a subsidiary in Britain. The parent company in 
Korea knows that in 30 days—say, on February 1—its British subsidiary will be sending it a 
payment in British pounds. Because the parent company is concerned about the value of that 
payment in South Korean won a month in the future, it wants to insure against the possibility 
that the pound’s value will fall over that period—meaning, of course, that it will receive less 
money. Therefore, on January 2, the parent company contracts with a financial institution, such 
as a bank, to exchange the payment in one month at an agreed-upon exchange rate specified on 
January 2. In this way, as of January 2, the Korean company knows exactly how many won the 
payment will be worth on February 1.
CuRReNCy ARBiTRAGe Currency arbitrage is the instantaneous purchase and sale of a 
currency in different markets for profit. Suppose a currency trader in New York notices that 
the value of the European Union euro is lower in Tokyo than it is in New York. The trader 
can buy euros in Tokyo, sell them in New York, and earn a profit on the difference. High-tech 
communication and trading systems allow the entire transaction to occur within seconds. But 
note that the trade is not worth making if the difference between the value of the euro in Tokyo 
and the value of the euro in New York is not greater than the cost of conducting the transaction.
Currency arbitrage is a common activity among experienced traders of foreign exchange, 
very large investors, and companies in the arbitrage business. Firms whose profits are generated 
primarily by another economic activity, such as retailing or manufacturing, take part in currency 
arbitrage only if they have very large sums of cash on hand.
Interest arbitrage is the profit-motivated purchase and sale of interest-paying securities 
denominated in different currencies. Companies use interest arbitrage to find better interest rates

abroad than those that are available in their home countries. The securities involved in such trans-
actions include government treasury bills, corporate and government bonds, and even bank depos-
its. Suppose a trader notices that the interest rates paid on bank deposits in Mexico are higher than 
those paid in Sydney, Australia (after adjusting for exchange rates). He can convert Australian dol-
lars to Mexican pesos and deposit the money in a Mexican bank account for, say, one year. At the 
end of the year, he converts the pesos back into Australian dollars and earns more in interest than 
the same money would have earned had it remained on deposit in an Australian bank.
CuRReNCy sPeCuLATiON Currency speculation is the purchase or sale of a currency with 
the expectation that its value will change and generate a profit. The shift in value might be 
expected to occur suddenly or over a longer period. The foreign exchange trader may bet that a 
currency’s price will go either up or down in the future. Suppose a trader in London believes that 
the value of the Japanese yen will increase over the next three months. She buys yen with pounds 
at today’s current price, intending to sell them in 90 days. If the price of yen rises in that time, 
she earns a profit; if it falls, she takes a loss. Speculation is much riskier than arbitrage because 
the value, or price, of currencies is quite volatile and is affected by many factors. Similar to 
arbitrage, currency speculation is commonly the realm of foreign exchange specialists rather 
than the managers of firms engaged in other endeavors.
A classic example of currency speculation unfolded in Southeast Asia in 1997. After news 
emerged in May about Thailand’s slowing economy and political instability, currency traders 
sprang into action. They responded to poor economic growth prospects and an overvalued cur-
rency, the Thai baht, by dumping the baht on the foreign exchange market. When the supply glutted 
the market, the value of the baht plunged. Meanwhile, traders began speculating that other Asian 
economies were also vulnerable. From the time the crisis first hit until the end of 1997, the value 
of the Indonesian rupiah fell by 87 percent, the South Korean won by 85 percent, the Thai baht by 
63 percent, the Philippine peso by 34 percent, and the Malaysian ringgit by 32 percent.4 Although 
many currency speculators made a great deal of money, the resulting hardship experienced by these 
nations’ citizens caused some to question the ethics of currency speculation on such a scale.

Currency Quotes and Rates
Because of the importance of foreign exchange to trade and investment, businesspeople must un-
derstand how currencies are quoted in the foreign exchange market. Managers must know what 
financial instruments are available to help them protect the profits earned by their international 
business activities. And they must be aware of government restrictions that may be imposed on 
the convertibility of currencies and know how to work around these and other obstacles.
quoting Currencies
There are two components to every quoted exchange rate: the quoted currency and the base 
currency. If an exchange rate quotes the number of Japanese yen needed to buy one U.S. dollar 
(¥/$), the yen is the quoted currency and the dollar is the base currency. When you designate 
any exchange rate, the quoted currency is always the numerator and the base currency is the 
denominator. For example, if you were given a yen/dollar exchange rate quote of 90/1 (meaning 
that 90 yen are needed to buy one dollar), the numerator is 90 and the denominator is 1. We can 
also designate this rate as ¥ 90/$.

how many units of each listed currency can be purchased with one U.S. dollar. For example, 
in the row labeled “Japan (yen),” we see that 84.3770 Japanese yen can be bought with one 
U.S. dollar. We state this exchange rate as ¥ 84.3770/$. Because the yen is the quoted currency, 
we say that this is a direct quote on the yen and an indirect quote on the dollar. Note that the 
exchange rate for a nation participating in the single currency (euro) of the European Union is 
found on the line in the table that reads “Euro area (euro).”
When we have a direct quote on a currency and wish to calculate the indirect quote, we sim-
ply divide the currency quote into the numeral 1. The following formula is used to derive a direct 
quote from an indirect quote:
Direct quote =
1
Indirect quote
And for deriving an indirect quote from a direct quote:
Indirect quote =
1
Direct quote
In the previous example, we were given an indirect quote on the U.S. dollar of ¥ 84.3770/$. 
To find the direct quote on the dollar we simply divide ¥ 84.3770 into $1:
$1 ÷ ¥ 84.3770 = $0.011852/ ¥

266  
part 4 • the InternatIonal FInanCIal systeM
This means that it costs $0.011852 to purchase one yen (¥)—slightly more than one U.S. 
cent. We state this exchange rate as $0.011852/¥. In this case, because the dollar is the quoted 
currency, we have a direct quote on the dollar and an indirect quote on the yen.
Businesspeople and foreign exchange traders track currency values over time because 
changes in currency values can benefit or harm international transactions. Exchange-rate risk 
(foreign exchange risk) is the risk of adverse changes in exchange rates. Managers develop 
strategies to minimize this risk by tracking percentage changes in exchange rates. To see how to 
calculate percentage change in the value of currencies, read this chapter’s appendix on page 277.
CROss RATes International transactions between two currencies other than the U.S. dollar 
often use the dollar as a vehicle currency. For example, a retail buyer of merchandise in the 
Netherlands might convert its euros (recall that the Netherlands uses the European Union 
currency) to U.S. dollars and then pay its Japanese supplier in U.S. dollars. The Japanese 
supplier may then take those U.S. dollars and convert them to Japanese yen. This process was 
more common years ago, when fewer currencies were freely convertible and when the United 
States greatly dominated world trade. Today, a Japanese supplier may want payment in euros. In 
this case, both the Japanese and the Dutch companies need to know the exchange rate between 
their respective currencies. To find this rate using their respective exchange rates with the U.S. 
dollar, we calculate what is called a cross rate—an exchange rate calculated using two other 
exchange rates.
Cross rates between two currencies can be calculated using both currencies’ indirect or 
direct exchange rates with a third currency. For example, suppose we want to know the cross rate 
between the currencies of the Netherlands and Japan. Looking at Table 9.1 again, we see that the 
direct quote on the euro is € 0.7883/$. The direct quote on the Japanese yen is ¥ 84.3770/$. To 
find the cross rate between the euro and the yen, with the yen as the base currency, we simply 
divide € 0.7883/$ by ¥ 84.3770/$:
€ 0.7883/$ ÷ ¥ 84.3770/$ = € 0.0093/ ¥
Thus, it costs 0.0093 euros to buy 1 yen.
Table 9.2 shows the cross rates for major world currencies. When finding cross rates using 
direct quotes, currencies down the left-hand side represent quoted currencies; those across the 
top represent base currencies. Conversely, when finding cross rates using indirect quotes, cur-
rencies down the left side represent base currencies; those across the top represent quoted cur-
rencies. Look at the intersection of the “Euro area” row (the quoted currency in our example) 
and the “Yen” column (our base currency). Note that the solution we calculated above for the 
cross rate between euro and yen match the listed rate of 0.0093 euros to the yen.
Naturally, the exchange rate between the euro and the yen is quite important to both the 
Japanese supplier and Dutch retailer we mentioned earlier. If the value of the euro falls relative 
to the yen, the Dutch company must pay more in euros for its Japanese products. This situa-
tion will force the Dutch company to take one of two steps: either increase the price at which it 
resells the Japanese product (perhaps reducing sales) or keep prices at current levels (thus reduc-
ing its profit margin).

Chapter 9 • InternatIonal FInanCIal Markets   267
Ironically, the Japanese supplier will suffer if the yen rises too much. Why? Under such cir-
cumstances, the Japanese supplier can do one of two things: allow the exchange rate to force its 
euro prices higher (thus maintaining profits) or reduce its yen prices to offset the decline of the 
euro (thus reducing its profit margin).
Both the Japanese supplier and the Dutch buyer can absorb exchange rate changes by squeez-
ing profits—but only to a point. After that point is passed, they will no longer be able to trade. 
The Dutch buyer will be forced to look for a supplier in a country with a more favorable exchange 
rate or for a supplier in its own country (or another European country that uses the euro).
spot Rates
All the exchange rates we’ve discussed so far are called spot rates—exchange rates that require 
delivery of the traded currency within two business days. Exchange of the two currencies is said 
to occur “on the spot,” and the spot market is the market for currency transactions at spot rates. 
The spot market assists companies in performing any one of three functions:
 1. Converting income generated from sales abroad into their home-country currency;
 2. Converting funds into the currency of an international supplier;
 3. Converting funds into the currency of a country in which they wish to invest.
Buy AND seLL RATes The spot rate is available only for trades worth millions of dollars. That 
is why it is available only to banks and foreign exchange brokers. If you are traveling to another 
country and want to exchange currencies at your local bank before departing, you will not be 
quoted the spot rate. Rather, you will receive a quote that includes a markup to cover the costs 
your bank incurs when performing this transaction for you.
Suppose you are taking a business trip to Spain and need to buy some euros. The bank will 
quote you exchange-rate terms, such as $1.268/78 per €, which means that the bank will buy 
U.S. dollars at the rate of $1.268/€ and sell them at the rate of $1.278/€.
forward Rates
When a company knows that it will need a certain amount of foreign currency on a certain future 
date, it can exchange currencies using a forward rate—an exchange rate at which two parties 
agree to exchange currencies on a specified future date. Forward rates represent the expectations 
of currency traders and bankers regarding a currency’s future spot rate. Reflected in these expec-
tations are a country’s present and future economic conditions (including inflation rate, national 
debt, taxes, trade balance, and economic growth rate) as well as its social and political situation. 
The forward market is the market for currency transactions at forward rates.
To insure themselves against unfavorable exchange-rate changes, companies commonly 
turn to the forward market. It can be used for all types of transactions that require future pay-
ment in other currencies, including credit sales or purchases, interest receipts or payments on 
investments or loans, and dividend payments to stockholders in other countries. But not all 
nations’ currencies trade in the forward market, such as countries experiencing high inflation or 
currencies not in demand on international financial markets.
fORwARD CONTRACTs Suppose a Brazilian bicycle maker imports parts from a Japanese 
supplier. Under the terms of their contract, the Brazilian importer must pay 100 million Japanese 
yen in 90 days. The Brazilian firm can wait until one or two days before payment is due, buy 
yen in the spot market, and pay the Japanese supplier. But in the 90 days between the contract 
date and the due date the exchange rate will likely change. What if the value of the Brazilian real 
goes down? In that case, the Brazilian importer will have to pay more reais (plural of real) to get 
the same 100 million Japanese yen. Therefore, our importer may want to pay off the debt before 
the 90-day term. But what if it does not have the cash on hand? What if it needs those 90 days to 
collect accounts receivable from its own customers?
To decrease its exchange-rate risk, our Brazilian importer can enter into a forward 
contract—a contract that requires the exchange of an agreed-on amount of a currency on an 
agreed-on date at a specified exchange rate. Forward contracts are commonly signed for 30, 
90, and 180 days into the future, but customized contracts (say, for 76 days) are possible. Note 
that a forward contract requires the exchange to occur: The bank must deliver the yen, and the

Brazilian importer must buy them at the prearranged price. Forward contracts belong to a family 
of financial instruments called derivatives—instruments whose values derive from other com-
modities or financial instruments. These include not only forward contracts but also currency 
swaps, options, and futures (presented next in this chapter).
In our example, the Brazilian importer can use a forward contract to pay yen to its Japanese 
supplier in 90 days. It is always possible, of course, that in 90 days, the value of the real will 
be lower than its current value. But by locking in at the forward rate, the Brazilian firm protects 
itself against the less favorable spot rate at which it would have to buy yen in 90 days. In this 
case, the Brazilian company protects itself from paying more to the supplier at the end of 90 
days than if it were to pay at the spot rate in 90 days. Thus, it protects its profit from further 
erosion if the spot rate becomes even more unfavorable over the next three months. Remember, 
too, that such a contract prevents the Brazilian importer from taking advantage of any increase in 
the value of the real in 90 days that would reduce what the company owed its Japanese supplier.
swaps, Options, and futures
In addition to forward contracts, three other types of currency instruments are used in the for-
ward market: currency swaps, options, and futures.
CuRReNCy swAPs A currency swap is the simultaneous purchase and sale of foreign 
exchange for two different dates. Currency swaps are an increasingly important component of 
the foreign exchange market. Suppose a Swedish automaker imports parts from a subsidiary 
in Turkey. The Swedish company must pay the Turkish subsidiary in Turkish lira for the 
parts when they are delivered today. The company also expects to receive Turkish liras for 
automobiles sold in Turkey in 90 days. Our Swedish company exchanges kronor for lira in the 
spot market today to pay its subsidiary. At the same time, it agrees to a forward contract to sell 
Turkish lira (and buy Swedish kronor) in 90 days at the quoted 90-day forward rate for lira. In 
this way, the Swedish company uses a swap both to reduce its exchange-rate risk and to lock 
in the future exchange rate. In this sense, we can think of a currency swap as a more complex 
forward contract.
CuRReNCy OPTiONs Recall that, once it is entered into, a forward contract requires an exchange 
of currencies. By contrast, a currency option is a right, or option, to exchange a specified amount 
of a currency on a specified date at a specified rate.
Suppose a company buys an option to purchase Swiss francs at SF 1.02/$ in 30 days. If, at 
the end of the 30 days, the exchange rate is SF 1.05/$, the company would not exercise its cur-
rency option. Why? It could get SF 0.03 more for every dollar by exchanging at the spot rate in 
the currency market rather than at the stated rate of the option. Companies often use currency 
options to hedge against exchange-rate risk or to obtain foreign currency.
CuRReNCy fuTuRes CONTRACTs Similar to a currency forward contract is a currency futures 
contract—a contract requiring the exchange of a specified amount of currency on a specified date 
at a specified exchange rate, with all conditions fixed and not adjustable.

(comprising currency swaps and spot and forward contracts) amounts to around $4  trillion—an 
amount greater than the yearly gross domestic product of many small nations.5 Several major 
trading centers and several currencies dominate the foreign exchange market.
Trading Centers
Most of the world’s major cities participate in trading on the foreign exchange market. But in 
recent years, just three countries have come to account for more than half of all global currency 
trading: the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. Accordingly, most of this trading 
takes place in the financial capitals of London, New York, and Tokyo.
London dominates the foreign exchange market for historic and geographic reasons. The 
United Kingdom was once the world’s largest trading nation. British merchants needed to 
exchange currencies of different nations, and London naturally assumed the role of financial 
trading center. London quickly came to dominate the market and still does so because of its loca-
tion halfway between North America and Asia. A key factor is its time zone. Because of differ-
ences in time zones, London is opening for business as markets in Asia close trading for the day. 
When New York opens for trading in the morning, trading is beginning to wind down in London. 
Also, most large banks active in foreign exchange employ overnight traders to ensure continuous 
trading (see Figure 9.1).
important Currencies
Although the United Kingdom is the major location of foreign exchange trading, the U.S.  dollar 
is the currency that dominates the foreign exchange market. The U.S. dollar’s dominance makes 
it a vehicle currency—a currency used as an intermediary to convert funds between two other 
currencies. The currencies most often involved in currency transactions are the U.S. dollar, 
European Union euro, Japanese yen, and British pound.
One reason the U.S. dollar is a vehicle currency is because the United States is the world’s 
largest trading nation. Many companies and banks maintain dollar deposits, making it easy to 
exchange other currencies with dollars. Another reason is that, following the Second World War, 
all of the world’s major currencies were tied indirectly to the dollar because it was the most 
stable currency. In turn, the dollar’s value was tied to a specific value of gold—a policy that held

wild currency swings in check. Although world currencies are no longer linked to the value of 
gold (see Chapter 10), the stability of the dollar, along with its resistance to inflation, sometimes 
helps  people and organizations maintain their purchasing power better than their own national 
currencies.
interbank Market
It is in the interbank market that the world’s largest banks exchange currencies at spot and 
forward rates. Companies tend to obtain foreign exchange services from the bank where they 
do most of their business. Banks satisfy client requests for exchange quotes by obtaining quotes 
from other banks in the interbank market. For transactions that involve commonly exchanged 
currencies, the largest banks often have sufficient currency on hand. Yet, rarely exchanged cur-
rencies are not typically kept on hand and may not even be easily obtainable from another bank. 
In such cases, banks turn to foreign exchange brokers, who maintain vast networks of banks 
through which they obtain seldom-traded currencies.
In the interbank market, then, banks act as agents for client companies. In addition to locat-
ing and exchanging currencies, banks commonly offer advice on trading strategy, supply a vari-
ety of currency instruments, and provide other risk-management services. Banks also help their 
clients manage exchange-rate risk by supplying information on rules and regulations around the 
world.
Large banks in the interbank market use their influence in currency markets to get bet-
ter rates for their largest clients. Small and medium-sized businesses often cannot get the best 
exchange rates because they deal only in small volumes of currencies and do so rather infre-
quently. A small company might get better exchange rate quotes from a discount international 
payment service.
CLeARiNG MeChANisMs Clearing mechanisms are an important element of the interbank 
market. Foreign exchange transactions among banks and foreign exchange brokers happen 
continuously. The accounts are not settled after each individual trade but are settled following a 
number of completed transactions. The process of aggregating the currencies that one bank owes 
another and then carrying out that transaction is called clearing. Years ago, banks performed 
clearing every day or every two days, and they physically exchanged currencies with other 
banks. Nowadays, clearing is performed more frequently and occurs digitally, which eliminates 
the need to trade currencies physically.
securities exchanges
Securities exchanges specialize in currency futures and options transactions. Buying and selling 
currencies on these exchanges entails the use of securities brokers, who facilitate transactions 
by transmitting and executing clients’ orders. Transactions on securities exchanges are much 
smaller than those in the interbank market and vary with each currency. The leading exchange 
that deals in most major asset classes of futures and options is the CME Group, Inc. (www.cme-
group.com). The CME Group merged the futures and options operations of the Chicago Board 
of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the New York Mercantile Exchange. The CME 
Group’s foreign exchange marketplace is the world’s second largest electronic foreign exchange 
marketplace, with more than $80 billion in daily liquidity.6
Another exchange is the London International Financial Futures Exchange (www.euronext.
com), which trades futures and options for major currencies. In the United States, trading in 
currency options occurs only on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (www.nasdaqtrader.com). 
It deals in both standardized options and customized options, allowing investors flexibility in 
designing currency option contracts.7
Over-The-Counter Market
The over-the-counter (OTC) market is a decentralized exchange encompassing a global com-
puter network of foreign exchange traders and other market participants. All foreign exchange 
transactions can be performed in the OTC market, where the major players are large financial 
institutions.
The over-the-counter market has grown rapidly because it offers distinct benefits for busi-
ness. It allows businesspeople to search freely for the institution that provides the best (lowest)

price for conducting a transaction. It also offers opportunities for designing customized transac-
tions. For additional ways companies can become more adept in their foreign exchange activi-
ties, see this chapter’s Manager’s Briefcase, titled “Managing Foreign Exchange.”
Currency Restriction
A convertible (hard) currency is traded freely in the foreign exchange market, with its price 
determined by the forces of supply and demand. Countries that allow full convertibility are those 
that are in strong financial positions and that have adequate reserves of foreign currencies. Such 
countries have no reason to fear that people will sell their own currency for that of another. Still, 
many newly industrialized and developing countries do not permit the free convertibility of their 
currencies.
Governments impose currency restrictions to achieve several goals. One goal is to preserve a 
country’s reserve of hard currencies with which to repay debts owed to other nations. Developed 
nations, emerging markets, and some countries that export natural resources tend to have the 
greatest amounts of foreign exchange. Without sufficient reserves (liquidity), a country could 
default on its loans and thereby discourage future investment flows. This is precisely what hap-
pened to Argentina several years ago when the country defaulted on its international public debt.
A second goal of currency restriction is to preserve hard currencies in order to pay for 
imports and to finance trade deficits. Recall from Chapter 5 that a country runs a trade deficit 
when the value of its imports exceeds the value of its exports. Currency restrictions help govern-
ments maintain inventories of foreign currencies with which to pay for such trade imbalances. 
They also make importing more difficult because local companies cannot obtain foreign cur-
rency to pay for imports. The resulting reduction in imports directly improves the country’s trade 
balance.
A third goal is to protect a currency from speculators. For example, in the wake of the Asian 
financial crisis years ago, some Southeast Asian nations considered controlling their currencies 
to limit the damage done by economic downturns. Malaysia stemmed the outflow of foreign 
money by preventing local investors from converting their Malaysian holdings into other curren-
cies. Although the move also curtailed currency speculation, it effectively cut off Malaysia from 
investors elsewhere in the world.
A fourth (less common) goal is to keep resident individuals and businesses from investing 
in other nations. These policies can generate more rapid economic growth in a country by forc-
ing investment to remain at home. Unfortunately, although this might work in the short term,

• Match Needs to Providers Analyze your foreign exchange 
needs and the range of service providers available. Find a 
provider that offers the transactions you undertake in the 
currencies you need, and consolidate repetitive transfers. 
Many businesspeople naturally look to local bankers when 
they need to transfer funds abroad, but this may not be the 
cheapest or best choice. A mix of service providers some-
times offers the best solution.
• Work with the Majors Money-center banks (those located 
in financial centers) that participate directly in the foreign 
exchange market can have cost and service advantages over 
local banks. Dealing directly with a large trading institution 
is often more cost effective than dealing with a local bank 
because it avoids the additional markup that the local bank 
charges for its services.
• Consolidate to Save Save money by timing your interna-
tional payments to consolidate multiple transfers into one 
large transaction. Open a local currency account abroad 
against which you can write drafts if your company makes 
multiple smaller payments in the same currency. Consider 
allowing foreign receivables to accumulate in an interest- 
bearing account locally until you repatriate them in a lump 
sum to reduce service fees.
• Get the Best Deal Possible If your foreign exchange activity 
is substantial, develop relationships with two or more money-
center banks to get the best rates. Also, monitor the rates 
your company gets over time, as some banks raise rates if 
you’re not shopping around. Obtain real-time market rates 
provided by firms like Reuters and Bloomberg.
• Embrace Information Technology Every time an employee 
phones, e-mails, or faxes in a transaction, human error could 
 delay getting funds where and when your company needs them. 
Embrace information technology in your business’s international 
wire transfers and drafts. Automated software programs avail-
able from specialized service providers reduce the potential for 
errors while speeding the execution of transfers.

it normally slows long-term economic growth. The reason is that there is no guarantee that 
 domestic funds held in the home country will be invested there. Instead, they might be saved 
or even spent on consumption. Ironically, increased consumption can mean further increases in 
imports, making a trade deficit even worse.
instruments for Restricting Currencies
Certain government policies are frequently used to restrict currency convertibility. Governments 
can require that all foreign exchange transactions be performed at or approved by the country’s 
central bank. They can also require import licenses for some or all import transactions. These 
licenses help the government control the amount of foreign currency leaving the country.
Some governments implement systems of multiple exchange rates, specifying a higher 
exchange rate on the importation of certain goods or on imports from certain countries. The gov-
ernment can thus reduce importation while ensuring that important goods still enter the country. 
It also can use such a policy to target the goods of countries with which it is running a trade 
deficit.
Other governments issue import deposit requirements that require businesses to deposit cer-
tain percentages of their foreign exchange funds in special accounts before being granted import 
licenses. In addition, quantity restrictions limit the amount of foreign currency that residents can 
take out of the home country when traveling to other countries as tourists, students, or medical 
patients.
One way to get around national restrictions on currency convertibility is countertrade—the 
practice of selling goods or services that are paid for, in whole or in part, with other goods or 
services. One simple form of countertrade is a barter transaction, in which goods are exchanged 
for others of equal value. Parties exchange goods and then sell them in world markets for hard 
currency. For example, Cuba once exchanged $60 million worth of sugar for cereals, pasta, and 
vegetable oils from the Italian firm Italgrani. And Boeing (www.boeing.com) has sold aircraft to 
Saudi Arabia in return for oil. We detail the many different forms of countertrade in Chapter 13.

ell-functioning financial markets are essential to conducting 
international business. International financial markets supply 
companies with the mechanism they require to exchange curren-
cies, and more. Here we focus on the main implications of these 
markets for international companies.
international Capital Market and Businesses
The international capital market joins borrowers and lenders from 
different national capital markets. A company unable to obtain 
funds in its own nation may use the international capital market to 
obtain financing elsewhere and allow the firm to undertake an oth-
erwise impossible project. This option can be especially important 
for firms in countries with small or emerging capital markets.
Similar to the prices of any other commodity, the “price” 
of money is determined by supply and demand. If the supply 
increases, the price (in the form of interest rates) falls. The inter-
national capital market opens up additional sources of financing 
for companies, possibly financing projects previously regarded as 
not feasible. The international capital market also expands lend-
ing opportunities, which reduces risk for lenders by allowing them 
to spread their money over a greater number of debt and equity 
instruments and to benefit from the fact that securities markets do 
not move up and down in tandem.
international financial Market and Businesses
Companies must convert to local currencies when they undertake 
foreign direct investment. Later, when a firm’s international sub-
sidiary earns a profit and the company wishes to return profits to 
the home country, it must convert the local money into the home 
currency. The prevailing exchange rate at the time profits are 
 exchanged influences the amount of the ultimate profit or loss.
This raises an important aspect of international financial 
 markets—fluctuation. International companies can use hedging 
in foreign exchange markets to lessen the risk associated with 
international transfers of funds and to protect themselves in credit 
transactions in which there is a time lag between billing and receipt

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Explain the importance of the international capital market.
• The international capital market is meant to (1) expand the supply of capital for 
 borrowers, (2) lower interest rates for borrowers, and (3) lower risk for lenders.
• Growth in the international capital market is due mainly to (1) advances in informa-
tion technology, (2) deregulation of capital markets, and (3) innovation in financial 
instruments.
• London, New York, and Tokyo are the world’s most important financial centers. 
Offshore financial centers handle less business than the world’s most important 
 financial centers but have few regulations and few, if any, taxes.
 LO2. Describe the main components of the international capital market.
• The international bond market consists of all bonds sold by issuers outside their own 
countries. It is growing as investors in developed markets search for higher rates 
from borrowers in emerging markets, and vice versa.
• The international equity market consists of all stocks bought and sold outside the 
home country of the issuing company. Factors driving its growth are (1) privatization, 
(2) increased activity by companies in emerging nations, (3) global reach of invest-
ment banks, and (4) global electronic trading.
• The Eurocurrency market consists of all the world’s currencies banked outside their 
countries of origin. Its appeal is a lack of government regulation and a lower cost of 
borrowing.
 LO3. Outline the functions of the foreign exchange market.
• One function is to convert one currency into another for individuals, companies, and 
governments.
• Second, it is used as a hedging device to insure against adverse changes in exchange 
rates.
• Third, it is used to earn a profit from currency arbitrage or other interest-paying 
 security in different markets.
• Fourth, it is used to speculate about a change in the value of a currency and thereby 
earn a profit.
 LO4. Explain the different types of currency quotes and exchange rates.
• An exchange-rate quote between currency A and currency B (A/B) of 10/1 means 
that it takes 10 units of currency A to buy 1 unit of currency B (this is a direct quote 
of currency A and an indirect quote of currency B).
• Exchange rates can also be found using two currencies’ exchange rates with a 
 common currency, which results in a cross rate.
• An exchange rate that requires delivery of a traded currency within two business days 
is called a spot rate.
• A forward rate is the rate at which two parties agree to exchange currencies on a 
specified future date.
of payment. Some firms take part in currency arbitrage when they 
have large sums of cash on hand. Companies can also use interest 
arbitrage to find better interest rates abroad than those available 
in their home countries.
Businesspeople are also interested in tracking currency values 
over time because changes in currency values affect their inter-
national transactions. Profits earned by companies that import 
products for resale are influenced by the exchange rate between 
their currency and that of the nation from which they import. 
Managers who understand that changes in these currencies’ val-
ues affect the profitability of their international business activities 
can develop strategies to minimize risk.
In the next chapter, we extend our coverage of the interna-
tional financial system to see how market forces (including inter-
est rates and inflation) have an impact on exchange rates. We 
also conclude our study of the international financial system by 
looking at the roles of government and international institutions 
in managing movements in exchange rates.

 LO5. Describe the instruments and institutions of the foreign exchange market.
• The interbank market is where the world’s largest banks locate and exchange cur-
rencies for companies. Securities exchanges are physical locations at which currency 
futures and options are bought and sold (in smaller amounts than those traded in the 
interbank market).
• Goals of currency restriction include (1) preserve hard currency reserves for repaying 
debts owed to other nations, (2) preserve hard currency to pay for needed imports or 
to finance a trade deficit, (3) protect a currency from speculators, and (4) keep badly 
needed currency from being invested abroad.
• Instruments used to restrict currencies include (1) government approval for currency 
exchange, (2) imposed import licenses, (3) a system of multiple exchange rates, and 
(4) imposed quantity restrictions.

9-14. Past growth in the international capital market has been fueled by advancements in information technology, deregula-
tion, and securitization. What factors do you think are holding back the creation of a truly global capital market?
9-15. the use of different national currencies creates a barrier to further growth in international business activity due to 
conversion costs and exchange-rate risk. What are the pros and cons, among companies and governments, of replacing 
national currencies with regional currencies, or even a global currency?
Ethical Challenge You are the senior accountant for a business that regularly imports spare parts for a range of 
your products from overseas suppliers. You have been instructed by the CEO to look at ways 
you can save money on the transactions when you pay these overseas suppliers. He is con-
vinced that there are ways in which you can organize the transaction so that you maximize 
the opportunities with fluctuating exchange rates. He has been reading about spot rates and is 
a little confused about the way it works or whether it is strictly legal or ethical. He wants you 
to explain the processes involved in organizing forward rates and how the business can take 
advantage of them.  
 9-5. When we pay an overseas supplier, should we wait until the last minute to pay?
 9-6. How far in advance can we organize these forward contracts? Is the timing of the 
 arrangement crucial?
 9-7. Now suppose that having arranged a forward contract, we don’t actually want to go 
through with it. What happens?
Teaming Up
In groups of three or four consider the ethical dimensions of currency speculation. If sufficient 
funds are available, a great deal of money can be made from buying and selling currency; 
in fact, the exchange rates can be manipulated. Some countries have found themselves the 
target of currency speculation, from Britain to many countries in Southeast Asia. It has had 
a profound impact on the economy. People’s savings have been drastically affected. To what 
extent is this legitimate business activity? Is this just a version of gambling with no real ethics 
attached to it? Discuss whether you think it is ethical and then share your thoughts with the 
rest of the class.

The Effect of the Asian Crisis on Southeast Asian Corporations
I
n the summer of 1997, after a couple of months fighting to 
 defend the value of the baht, pegged to the U.S. dollar, the 
government of Thailand decided to abandon the battle and let 
its currency flow freely. This move marked the onset of what is 
now known as the Asian Financial Crisis, which heavily affected 
the  economies of the region such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and 
South Korea. 
To this day, there are ongoing debates about the dynamics of 
the Asian Financial crisis. A series of causes have been pinpointed 
as relevant. Among them were the high level of corporate debt 
of some of the local corporations (caused by the access to cheap 
credit they were enjoying in the 1990s), bad government poli-
cies, the impact of derivatives and financial speculation, and the 
increase in competition from China. Some economists have also 
mentioned other, more indirect factors, such as the Chinese cur-
rency devaluation in 1994, and the handover of Hong Kong to 
China in 1997.
While the affected countries tried to tackle the crisis with a 
series of measures of fiscal rigor, the international community 
decided to act to prevent worldwide contagion. The International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) intervened, and poured in a first tranche of 
a $40 billion program to help stabilize the local currencies most 
affected by the economic downturn, mainly Thailand, Indonesia, 
and South Korea. These efforts, heavily criticized in the region, 
had mixed effects and, at least in the case of Indonesia, were not 
successful in their aim. A full-fledged economic crisis and wide-
spread riots in Indonesia led to the collapse of the Suharto govern-
ment. The value of the Indonesian rupiah fell dramatically, from 
1 USD = 2,600 INR before the crisis to 1 USD = 14,000 INR during 
the crisis. In 2012, 15 years after the start of the crisis, the country 
has certainly recovered from the recession, yet the  exchange rate is 
still below pre-crisis levels (at 1 USD = 9,200 INR).
Other countries, such as Malaysia, decided to oust the IMF 
and closed up their financial market to avoid capital flight. The 
then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahatir Mohamad, adopted a se-
ries of restrictions and led the regional opposition to the interven-
tion of foreign institutions. His measures proved successful in the 
circumstances, and Malaysia managed to recover faster than other 
countries from the crisis.
The consequences, however, were felt worldwide, and for 
years these economies did not recover to their pre-crisis levels of 
growth. Some big corporations, such as the Korean Daewoo, who 
before the crisis were considered too big to fail, were dismantled 
by their governments in the crisis’ aftermath.
Now, more than 15 years after those events, the countries in-
volved look like they have completely recovered from the downturn. 
The price paid has been in some cases quite high, and virtually no 
economy in the region has come out unscathed, with the exception 
of China and economies strongly linked to it (e.g., Hong Kong and 
Taiwan). Arguably, the lesson that these countries can learn from 
this is: invest in quality, strengthen the economic fundamentals, and 
try to reduce dependence on foreign direct investments (FDIs).
However, the crisis had some important, lasting macroeco-
nomic consequences, the most relevant being the shift of eco-
nomic weight within the region. Whereas in the 1990s, the “Asian 
tigers” and the countries generally known as NIEs and Japan were 
the focus of FDIs, in the 2000s this role clearly passed to new 
emerging superpowers, such as China and India, which are now 
the new East Asian leading economies.
Thinking Globally
 9-16. A good starting point for exploring the local currencies 
of a region is to look at a financial newspaper, such as the 
Financial Times. What is the value of the local  currencies 
in respect to the U.S. dollar at the moment? Do you think 
it was wise for the countries’ governments to let the 
 currencies float freely in 1997? Why did they peg their 
 currencies’ value to the U.S. dollar in the first place? Do 
you think that the link with the U.S. dollar had any effect 
on the Asian Crisis? Explain.
 9-17. One of the causes of the Asian crisis has been traced back 
to the devaluation of the Chinese renminbi in 1994, which, 
according to some economists, put a strain on the export-
led economies of Southeast Asia, and eventually made them 
more vulnerable to the crisis. Do you think this theory is 
valid? Argue your point with reasons.
 9-18. In which way can export-led economies, such as the 
 countries in Southeast Asia, make themselves more resil-
ient and less dependent on the weakness of their currencies 
for boosting their exports? Choose one country and one 
 company to illustrate your answer.

Appendix  Calculating Percent Change  
in Exchange Rates
Businesspeople and foreign exchange traders track currency 
values over time as measured by exchange rates because 
changes in currency values can benefit or harm current and fu-
ture international transactions. Managers develop strategies to 
minimize exchange-rate risk (foreign exchange risk) by track-
ing percent changes in exchange rates.
For example, take pN as the exchange rate at the end of a pe-
riod (the currency’s new price) and pO as the exchange rate at 
the beginning of that period (the currency’s old price). We now 
can calculate percent change in the value of a currency with the 
following formula:
Percent change (%) =
Pn −Po
Po
× 100
Note: This equation yields the percent change in the base cur-
rency, not in the quoted currency.
Let’s illustrate the usefulness of this calculation with a 
simple example. Suppose that on February 1 of the current 
year, the exchange rate between the Norwegian krone (NOK) 
and the U.S. dollar was NOK 5/$. On March 1 of the current 
year, suppose the exchange rate stood at NOK 4/$. What is 
the change in the value of the base currency, the dollar? If we 
plug these numbers into our formula, we arrive at the following 
change in the value of the dollar:
Percent change (%) = 4 −5
5
× 100 = −20%
Thus, the value of the dollar has fallen 20 percent. In other 
words, one U.S. dollar buys 20 percent fewer Norwegian krone 
on March 1 than it did on February 1.
To calculate the change in the value of the Norwegian 
krone, we must first calculate the indirect exchange rate on 
the krone. This step is necessary because we want to make the 
krone our base currency. Using the formula presented earlier, 
we obtain an exchange rate of $.20/NOK (1 ÷ NOK 5) on 
February 1 and an exchange rate of $.25/NOK (1 ÷ NOK 
4) on March 1. Plugging these rates into our percent-change 
formula, we get:
Percent change (%) = .25 −.20
.20
× 100 = 25%
Thus the value of the Norwegian krone has risen 25 percent. 
One Norwegian krone buys 25 percent more U.S. dollars on 
March 1 than it did on February 1.
How important is this difference to businesspeople and 
exchange traders? Consider that the typical trading unit in the 
foreign exchange market (called a round lot) is $5 million. 
Therefore, a $5 million purchase of krone on February 1 would 
yield NOK 25 million. But because the dollar has lost 20 per-
cent of its buying power by March 1, a $5 million purchase 
would fetch only NOK 20 million—5 million fewer krone than 
a month earlier.

Euro Rollercoaster
BRUSSELS, Belgium—“Europe’s Big Idea,” “Ready, Set, Euros!” cried the headlines that 
greeted the launch of Europe’s new currency, the euro. Not since the time of the Roman 
Empire has a currency circulated so widely in Europe. Greece even gave up its drachma, a 
currency it had used for nearly 3,000 years. The euro is the official currency for 18 European 
countries and is accepted as legal tender in a number of other European nations.
The euro initially traded at around 
one-for-one against the dollar. Its value 
began to rise significantly, and a euro 
soon could buy around $1.57. The rise 
of the euro demonstrated confidence in 
the future expected growth and devel-
opment of nations in the euro zone. It 
also boosted the status of the euro as a 
global currency, one that could perhaps 
rival the U.S. dollar.
But the global credit crisis and sub-
sequent recession exposed Europe’s 
economies that were carrying too much 
national debt. By late 2014, the euro 
could buy only around $1.36. Earlier 
speculation that Greece would exit the 
euro and return to its drachma seemed 
wildly unrealistic by then. The euro 
rollercoaster rose and fell with each 
new revelation about the economic health of nations including Portugal, Ireland, Greece, 
and Spain. But financial markets soon stabilized and the euro’s future seemed secure once 
again. Shown here, a woman changes the digits on a display board at a currency exchange 
office in Bucharest, Romania.
The euro holds long-term benefits for European companies. Using a common cur-
rency in business transactions eliminates exchange-rate risk for companies in the euro 
zone and improves financial planning. It boosts competitiveness as synergies and econ-
omies of scale arise from mergers and acquisitions. Europe’s exporters benefit from a 
weak euro because it lowers their prices on world markets. Some European companies 
who lost market share abroad when their currency was strong could perhaps win back 
some of those customers. As you read this chapter, consider how the international mon-
etary system affects managerial decisions and firm performance.1

In Chapter 9, we explained the fundamentals of how exchange rates are calculated and how differ-
ent types of exchange rates are used. This chapter extends our understanding of the international 
financial system by exploring factors that determine exchange rates and various international at-
tempts to manage them. We begin by learning how exchange-rate movements affect a company’s 
activities and the importance of forecasting exchange rates. We then examine the factors that help 
determine currency values and, in turn, exchange rates. Next, we learn about different attempts to 
create a system of fixed exchange rates. We conclude this chapter by exploring efforts to develop a 
system of floating exchange rates and reviewing several recent financial crises.
Importance of Exchange Rates
Exchange rates influence demand for a company’s products in the global marketplace. A country 
with a currency that is weak (valued low relative to other currencies) will see a decline in the 
price of its exports and an increase in the price of its imports. Lower prices for the country’s 
exports on world markets can give companies the opportunity to take market share away from 
companies whose products are priced high in comparison.
Furthermore, a company improves profits if it sells its products in a country with a strong 
currency (one that is valued high relative to other currencies) while sourcing from a country with 
a weak currency. For example, if a company pays its workers and suppliers in a falling local cur-
rency and sells its products in a rising currency, the company benefits by generating revenue in 
the strong currency while paying expenses in the weak currency. Yet, managers must take care 
not to view this type of price advantage as permanent because doing so can jeopardize a com-
pany’s long-term competitiveness.
Exchange rates also affect the amount of profit a company earns from its international sub-
sidiaries. The earnings of international subsidiaries are typically integrated into the parent com-
pany’s financial statements in the home currency. Translating subsidiary earnings from a weak 
host country currency into a strong home currency reduces the amount of these earnings when 
stated in the home currency. Likewise, translating earnings into a weak home currency increases 
stated earnings in the home currency. Figure 10.1 shows exchange rates between the U.S. dollar 
and several major currencies.
The intentional lowering of the value of a currency by the nation’s government is called 
devaluation. The reverse, the intentional raising of the value of a currency by the nation’s 
devaluation
Intentionally lowering the value  
of a nation’s currency.

government, is called revaluation. These concepts are not to be confused with the terms weak 
currency and strong currency, although their effects are similar.
Devaluation lowers the price of a country’s exports on world markets and increases the price 
of its imports because the value of the country’s currency is now lower on world markets. A 
government might devalue its currency to give its domestic companies an edge over competition 
from other countries. But devaluation reduces the buying power of consumers in the nation. It 
can also allow inefficiencies to persist in domestic companies because there would then be less 
pressure to contain production costs. Revaluation has the opposite effects: It increases the price 
of exports and reduces the price of imports.
Desire for Predictability and Stability
Unfavorable movements in exchange rates can be costly for businesses. As the unpredictability 
of exchange rates increases, so too does the cost of insuring against the accompanying risk. By 
contrast, stable exchange rates improve the accuracy of financial planning and make cash-flow 
forecasts more precise.
Managers also prefer that movements in exchange rates be predictable. Predictable 
exchange rates reduce the likelihood that companies will be caught off guard by sudden and 
unexpected rate changes. They also reduce the need for costly insurance (usually by currency 
hedging) against possible adverse movements in exchange rates. Companies would be better off 
spending money on more productive activities, such as developing new products or designing 
more-efficient production methods.
Figure 10.2 shows how the value of the U.S. dollar has changed over time. The figure 
reveals the dollar’s periods of instability, which challenged the financial management capabili-
ties of international companies. Before undertaking any international business activity, managers 
should forecast future exchange rates and consider the impact of currency values on earnings.
Efficient versus Inefficient Market View
A great deal of debate revolves around the issue of whether markets themselves are efficient or 
inefficient when it comes to forecasting exchange rates. A market is efficient if prices of finan-
cial instruments quickly reflect new public information made available to traders. The efficient 
market view states that prices of financial instruments reflect all publicly available information 
at any given time. As applied to exchange rates, this means that forward exchange rates are ac-
curate forecasts of future exchange rates.
Recall from Chapter 9 that a forward exchange rate reflects a market’s expectations about 
the future values of two currencies. In an efficient currency market, forward exchange rates 
reflect all relevant publicly available information at any given time; they are considered the best 
possible predictors of exchange rates. Proponents of this view hold that there is no other pub-
licly available information that could improve the forecast of exchange rates over that provided

by forward rates. But there is always a certain amount of deviation between forward and actual 
exchange rates, and this inspires companies to search for more-accurate forecasting techniques.
The inefficient market view states that prices of financial instruments do not reflect all 
publicly available information. Proponents of this view believe that companies can search for 
new pieces of information to improve forecasting. But the cost of searching for further informa-
tion must not outweigh the benefits of its discovery.
Naturally, the inefficient market view is more compelling when the existence of private 
information is considered. Suppose that a single currency trader holds privileged information 
regarding a future change in a nation’s economic policy—information that she believes will 
affect that nation’s exchange rate. Because the market is unaware of this information, it is not 
reflected in forward exchange rates. Our trader will no doubt earn a profit by acting on her store 
of private information.
Forecasting Techniques
As we have already seen, some analysts believe that forecasts of exchange rates can be im-
proved by uncovering information not reflected in forward exchange rates. In fact, compa-
nies exist to provide exactly this type of service. There are two main forecasting techniques 
based on this belief in the value of added information—fundamental analysis and technical 
analysis.
Fundamental analysis uses statistical models based on fundamental economic indicators 
to forecast exchange rates. These models are often quite complex, with many variations reflect-
ing different possible economic conditions. These models include economic variables such as 
inflation, interest rates, money supply, tax rates, and government spending. Such analyses also 
often consider a country’s balance-of-payments situation (see Chapter 7) and its tendency to 
intervene in markets to influence the value of its currency.
Technical analysis uses charts of past trends in currency prices and other factors to fore-
cast exchange rates. Using highly statistical models and charts of past data trends, analysts 
examine conditions that prevailed during changes in exchange rates and try to estimate the tim-
ing, magnitude, and direction of future changes. Many forecasters combine the techniques of 
both fundamental and technical analyses to arrive at potentially more-accurate forecasts.
Difficulties of Forecasting
The business of forecasting exchange rates is a rapidly growing industry. But forecasting ex-
change rates is not a pure science, despite highly sophisticated statistical techniques in the hands 
of well-trained analysts. Few, if any, forecasts are ever completely accurate because of unex-
pected events that occur throughout the forecast period.
Beyond the problems associated with the data used by these techniques, failings can be 
traced to the human element involved in forecasting. For example, people can miscalculate the 
importance of economic news by placing too much emphasis on some elements and ignoring 
others.
Another factor that adds to the difficulty of forecasting exchange rates is changes in gov-
ernment regulation of business. Regulatory changes can improve or detract from the economic 
outlook for a nation’s economy. As forecasts predict economic improvement or worsening, the 
exchange rate between a nation’s currency and that of other nations also changes. Furthermore, 
a nation’s culture tends to influence the emphasis its people place on regulation of private busi-
ness. To read about several agencies responsible for the enforcement of U.S. business laws, see 
this chapter’s Culture Matters box, titled “The Long Arm of the Law.”

What Factors Determine Exchange Rates?
To improve our knowledge of the factors that help determine exchange rates, we must first 
understand two important concepts: the law of one price and purchasing power parity. Each of 
these concepts tells us the level at which an exchange rate should be. While discussing these 
concepts, we will examine some factors that affect actual levels of exchange rates.
Law of One Price
An exchange rate tells us how much of one currency we must pay to receive a certain amount 
of another. But it does not tell us whether a specific product will actually cost us more or less 
in a particular country (as measured in our own currency). When we travel to another country, 
we discover that our own currency buys more or less than it does at home. In other words, we 
quickly learn that exchange rates do not guarantee or stabilize the buying power of our currency. 
Thus, we can lose purchasing power in some countries while gaining it in others. For example, a 
restaurant meal for you and a friend that costs $60 in New York might cost you 7,000 yen (about 
$80) in Japan and 400 pesos (about $30) in Mexico. Compared with your meal in New York, 
you’ve suffered a loss of purchasing power in Japan but benefited from increased purchasing 
power in Mexico.
The law of one price stipulates that an identical product must have an identical price in all 
countries when the price is expressed in a common currency. For this principle to apply, prod-
ucts must be identical in quality and content in each country and be entirely produced within 
each country.
For example, suppose coal mined in the United States and in Germany is of similar qual-
ity. But suppose that one pound of coal costs €1.5 in Germany and $1 in the United States. 
Therefore, the law of one price calculates the expected exchange rate between the euro and dol-
lar to be €1.5/$. However, suppose the actual euro/dollar exchange rate on currency markets is 
€1.2/$. To pay for German coal with dollars denominated after the change in the exchange rate, 
one must convert not just $1 into euros, but $1.25 (which is the expected exchange rate divided 
by the actual exchange rate, or €1.5 ÷ $1.2). So, German coal costs $1.25 and U.S. coal costs $1, 
when the price is expressed in a common currency, which in this case is the dollar.
law of one price
Principle that an identical item 
must have an identical price in 
all countries when the price is 
expressed in a common currency.
Culture can affect the degree of oversight that a government im-
poses on its business environment. Here are several U.S. agencies 
that monitor business activity:
• U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) The USPTO is 
a noncommercial federal bureau within the Department of 
Commerce. By issuing patents, it provides incentives to in-
vent, invest in, and disclose new technologies worldwide. By 
registering trademarks, it protects business investment and 
safeguards consumers against confusion and deception. By 
disseminating patent and trademark information, it facilitates 
the development and sharing of new technologies worldwide.
• U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) The USITC is 
an independent, quasi-judicial federal agency. It provides trade 
expertise to both the legislative and executive branches of gov-
ernment, determines the impact of imports on U.S. industries, 
and directs actions against certain unfair trade practices such as 
patent, trademark, and copyright infringement. The agency has 
broad investigative powers on matters of trade and is a national 
resource where trade data are gathered and analyzed.
• Federal Trade Commission (FTC) The FTC enforces 
a variety of federal antitrust and consumer protection 
laws. It seeks to ensure that the nation’s markets function 
competitively and are vigorous, efficient, and free of undue 
restrictions. The commission also works to enhance the 
smooth operation of the marketplace by eliminating acts or 
practices that are unfair or deceptive. In general, the com-
mission’s efforts are directed toward stopping actions that 
threaten consumers’ opportunities to exercise informed 
choice.
• U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) The 
CPSC is an independent federal regulatory agency created 
to protect the public from injury and death associated with 
some 15,000 types of consumer products, including car 
seats, bicycles and bike helmets, lawnmowers, toys, and 
walkers. It also provides information for businesses regard-
ing the export of noncompliant, misbranded, or banned 
products.

Culture Matters    The Long Arm of the Law

284  
part 4 • the InternatIonal FInanCIal SySteM
Because the law of one price is being violated in our example, an arbitrage opportunity 
arises—that is, an opportunity to buy a product in one country and sell it in a country where it 
has a higher value. For example, one could earn a profit by buying U.S. coal at $1 per pound 
and selling it in Germany for $1.25 (€1.5) per pound. But note that as traders begin buying 
in the United States and selling in Germany, greater demand drives up the price of U.S. coal, 
whereas greater supply drives down the price of German coal. Eventually, the price of coal in 
both countries will settle somewhere between the previously low U.S. price and the previously 
high German price.
MCCurrEnCy The usefulness of the law of one price is that it helps us determine whether a 
currency is overvalued or undervalued. The Economist magazine publishes what it calls its “Big 
Mac Index” of exchange rates. This index uses the law of one price to determine the exchange 
rate that should exist between the U.S. dollar and other major currencies. The McDonald’s Big 
Mac is suitable to test the law of one price because each one is fairly identical in quality and 
content across national markets and is almost entirely produced within the nation in which it 
is sold. (Recall that the law of one price states that an identical product must have an identical 
price in all countries when the price is expressed in a common currency.)
A recent Big Mac Index found that the average price of a McDonald’s Big Mac was $3.73 in 
the United States but $1.95 in China. According to the Big Mac Index, China’s yuan is underval-
ued. By contrast, a Big Mac cost $7.20 in Norway and means that Norway’s krone is overvalued.2
Such large discrepancies between a currency’s exchange rate on currency markets and the 
rate predicted by the Big Mac Index are not surprising. For one thing, the selling price of food 
is affected by subsidies for agricultural products in most countries. Also, a Big Mac is not a 
“traded” product in the sense that one can buy Big Macs in low-priced countries and sell them 
in high-priced countries. Prices can also be affected because Big Macs are subject to different 
marketing strategies in different countries. Finally, countries impose different levels of sales tax 
on restaurant meals.
The drawbacks of the Big Mac Index reflect the fact that applying the law of one price to a 
single product is too simplistic a method for estimating exchange rates. Nonetheless, academic 
studies find that currency values tend to change in the direction suggested by the Big Mac Index.
Purchasing Power Parity
We introduced the concept of purchasing power parity (PPP) in Chapter 4 in the context of 
economic development. Although the law of one price holds for single products, PPP theory is 
meaningful only when applied to a basket of goods.
Economic forces, says PPP theory, will push the actual market exchange rate toward that 
determined by PPP. If they do not, arbitrage opportunities will arise. PPP holds for internation-
ally traded products that are not restricted by trade barriers and that entail few or no transporta-
tion costs. To earn a profit, arbitrageurs must be certain that the basket of goods purchased in the 
low-cost country would still be lower-priced in the high-cost country after adding transportation 
costs, tariffs, taxes, and so forth.
nuMErICAL ExAMPLE The PPP concept is also useful in determining at what level an 
exchange rate should be. Suppose 650 baht in Thailand will buy a bag of groceries that costs 
$30 in the United States. What do these two numbers tell us about the economic conditions of 
people in Thailand as compared with people in the United States? First, they help us compare 
the purchasing power of a Thai consumer with that of a consumer in the United States. But 
the question remains, Are Thai consumers better off or worse off than their counterparts in the 
United States? To address this question, suppose the gross national product (GNP) per capita of 
each country is as follows:
Thai GNP/capita = 122,277 baht
U.S. GNP/capita = 26,980 dollars
Suppose also that the exchange rate between the two currencies is 41.45 baht = 1 dollar. 
With this figure, we can translate 122,277 baht into dollars: 122,277 ÷ 41.45 = $2,950. We can 
now restate our question: Do prices in Thailand enable a Thai consumer with $2,950 to buy 
more or less than a consumer in the United States with $26,980?

 
Chapter 10 • InternatIonal Monetary SySteM   285
We already know that 650 baht will buy in Thailand what $30 will buy in the United States. 
Thus we calculate 650 ÷ 30 = 21.67 baht per dollar. Note that, whereas the exchange rate on cur-
rency markets is 41.45 baht/$, the purchasing power parity rate of the baht is 21.67/$. Let’s now 
use this figure to calculate a different comparative rate between the two currencies. We can now 
recalculate Thailand’s GNP per capita at PPP as follows: 122,277 ÷ 21.67 = 5,643. Thai con-
sumers on average are not nearly as affluent as their counterparts in the United States. But when 
we consider the goods and services that they can purchase with their baht—not the amount of 
U.S. dollars that they can buy—we see that a GNP per capita at PPP of $5,643 more accurately 
portrays the real purchasing power of Thai consumers.
Our new calculation considers price levels in adjusting the relative values of the two cur-
rencies. In the context of exchange rates, the principle of purchasing power parity can be inter-
preted as the exchange rate between two nations’ currencies that is equal to the ratio of their 
price levels. In other words, PPP tells us that a consumer in Thailand needs 21.67 units (not 
41.45) of Thai currency to buy the same amount of products as a consumer in the United States 
can buy with one dollar. As we can see in this example, the exchange rate at PPP (21.67/$) is dif-
ferent from the actual exchange rate in financial markets (41.45/$).
rOLE OF InFLATIOn Inflation is the result of the supply and demand for a currency. If 
additional money is injected into an economy that is not producing greater output, people will 
have more money to spend on the same amount of products as before. As growing demand for 
products outstrips stagnant supply, prices will rise and devour any increase in the amount of 
money that consumers have to spend. Therefore, inflation erodes people’s purchasing power.
Impact of Money-Supply Decisions Governments try to manage the supply of and demand 
for their currencies because of inflation’s damaging effects. They do this through the use of 
two types of policies designed to influence a nation’s money supply. Monetary policy refers 
to activities that directly affect a nation’s interest rates or money supply. Selling government 
securities reduces a nation’s money supply because investors pay money to the government’s 
treasury to acquire the securities. Conversely, when the government buys its own securities on 
the open market, cash is infused into the economy and the money supply increases.
Fiscal policy involves using taxes and government spending to influence the money supply 
indirectly. For example, to reduce the amount of money in the hands of consumers, govern-
ments increase taxes—people are forced to pay money to the government coffers. Conversely, 
 A resident of Harare, 
Zimbabwe, holds a 100 billion 
Zimbabwe dollar (ZWD) 
note he withdrew from a 
bank. A loaf of bread at that 
time cost about 6 million 
ZWD. Zimbabwe’s rate of 
inflation rocketed to over 
100,000 percent before the 
government abandoned its 
currency in 2009. The Bank 
of Zimbabwe declared that 
transactions could instead 
legally use foreign currencies, 
including the South african 
rand, Botswana pula, and the 
U.S. dollar. Zimbabwe faces a 
falling gross domestic product, 
crumbling infrastructure, and 
shortages of many necessities 
due to poor economic policies.

lowering taxes increases the amount of money in the hands of consumers. Governments can also 
step up their own spending activities in order to increase the amount of money circulating in the 
economy or can cut government spending to reduce it.
Impact of unemployment and Interest rates Key factors in the inflation equation are a 
country’s unemployment and interest rates. When unemployment rates are low, there is a 
shortage of labor and employers pay higher wages to attract employees. To maintain reasonable 
profit margins with higher labor costs, companies then usually raise the prices of their products, 
passing the cost of higher wages on to the consumer and causing inflation.
Interest rates (discussed in detail later in this chapter) affect inflation because they affect 
the cost of borrowing money. Low interest rates encourage people to take out loans to buy items 
such as homes and cars and to run up debt on credit cards. High interest rates prompt people to 
cut down on the amount of debt they carry because higher rates mean larger monthly payments 
on debt. Thus, one way to cool off an inflationary economy is to raise interest rates. Raising the 
cost of debt reduces consumer spending and makes business expansion more costly.
How Exchange rates Adjust to Inflation An important component of the concept of PPP is 
that exchange rates adjust to different rates of inflation in different countries. Such adjustment is 
necessary to maintain PPP between nations. Suppose that at the beginning of the year the exchange 
rate between the Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar is 8 pesos/$ (or $0.125/peso). Also suppose that 
inflation is pushing consumer prices higher in Mexico at an annual rate of 20 percent, whereas 
prices are rising just 3 percent per year in the United States. To find the new exchange rate (Ee) at 
the end of the year, we use the following formula:
Ee = Eb(1 + i1)∙(1 + i2)
where Eb is the exchange rate at the beginning of the period, i1 is the inflation rate in Country 1, 
and i2 is the inflation rate in Country 2. Plugging the numbers for this example into the formula, 
we get the following:
Ee = 8pesos/$[(1 + 0.20)∙(1 + 0.03)] = 9.3pesos/$
It is important to remember that because the numerator of the exchange rate is in pesos, the 
inflation rate for Mexico must also be placed in the numerator for the ratio of inflation rates. 
Thus, we see that the exchange rate adjusts from 8 pesos/$ to 9.3 pesos/$ because of the higher 
inflation rate in Mexico and the corresponding change in currency values. Higher inflation in 
Mexico reduces the number of U.S. dollars that a peso will buy and increases the number of 
pesos that a dollar will buy. In other words, whereas it had cost only 8 pesos to buy a dollar at the 
beginning of the year, it now costs 9.3 pesos.
In our example, companies based in Mexico must pay more in pesos for any supplies bought 
from the United States. But U.S. companies will pay less, in dollar terms, for supplies bought from 
Mexico. Also, tourists from the United States will be delighted, as vacationing in Mexico will be 
less expensive, but Mexicans will find the cost of visiting the United States is more expensive.
This discussion illustrates at least one of the difficulties facing countries with high rates of 
inflation. Both consumers and companies in countries experiencing rapidly increasing prices see 
their purchasing power eroded. Developing countries and countries in transition are those most 
often plagued by rapidly increasing prices.
rOLE OF InTErEST rATES To see how interest rates affect exchange rates between two 
currencies, we must first review the connection between inflation and interest rates within a 
single economy. We distinguish between two types of interest rates: real interest rates and 
nominal interest rates. Let’s say that your local bank quotes you an interest rate on a new 
car loan. That rate is the nominal interest rate, which consists of the real interest rate plus an 
additional charge for inflation. The reasoning behind this principle is simple: The lender must be 
compensated for the erosion of its purchasing power during the loan period caused by inflation.
Fisher Effect Suppose your bank lends you money to buy a delivery van for your home-based 
business. Let’s say that, given your credit-risk rating, the bank would normally charge you 

 
Chapter 10 • InternatIonal Monetary SySteM   287
5 percent annual interest. But if inflation is expected to be 2 percent over the next year, your 
annual rate of interest will be 7 percent: 5 percent real interest plus 2 percent to cover inflation. 
The principle that relates inflation to interest rates is called the Fisher effect—the principle that 
the nominal interest rate is the sum of the real interest rate and the expected rate of inflation over 
a specific period. We write this relation between inflation and interest rates as follows:
Nominal Interest Rate = Real Interest Rate + Inflation Rate
If money were free from all controls when transferred internationally, the real rate of inter-
est should be the same in all countries. To see why this is true, suppose that real interest rates 
are 4 percent in Canada and 6 percent in the United States. This situation creates an arbitrage 
opportunity: Investors could borrow money in Canada at 4 percent, lend it in the United States 
at 6 percent, and earn a profit on the 2 percent spread in interest rates. If enough people took 
advantage of this opportunity, interest rates would go up in Canada, where demand for money 
would become heavier, and down in the United States, where the money supply was growing. 
Again, the arbitrage opportunity would disappear because of the same activities that made it a 
reality. That is why real interest rates must theoretically remain equal across countries.
We saw earlier the relation between inflation and exchange rates. The Fisher effect clari-
fies the relation between inflation and interest rates. Now, let’s investigate the relation between 
exchange rates and interest rates. To illustrate this relation, we refer to the international Fisher 
effect—the principle that a difference in nominal interest rates supported by two countries’ 
currencies will cause an equal but opposite change in their spot exchange rates. Recall from 
Chapter 9 that the spot rate is the rate quoted for delivery of the traded currency within two busi-
ness days.
Because real interest rates are theoretically equal across countries, any difference in interest 
rates in two countries must be due to different expected rates of inflation. A country that is expe-
riencing inflation higher than that of another country should see the value of its currency fall. 
If so, the exchange rate must be adjusted to reflect this change in value. For example, suppose 
nominal interest rates are 5 percent in Australia and 3 percent in Canada. Expected inflation in 
Australia, then, is 2 percent higher than in Canada. The international Fisher effect predicts that 
the value of the Australian dollar will fall by 2 percent against the Canadian dollar.
EVALuATIng PPP PPP is better at predicting long-term exchange rates (more than 10 years), 
but accurate forecasts of short-term rates are more beneficial to international managers. Even 
short-term plans must assume certain things about future economic and political conditions in 
different countries, including added costs, trade barriers, and investor psychology.
Impact of Added Costs There are many possible reasons for the failure of PPP to predict 
exchange rates accurately. For example, PPP assumes no transportation costs. Suppose that 
the same basket of goods costs $100 in the United States and 950 kroner ($150) in Norway. 
Seemingly, one could make a profit through arbitrage by purchasing these goods in the United 
States and selling them in Norway. However, if it costs another $60 to transport the goods to 
Norway, the total cost of the goods once they arrive in Norway will be $160. Thus, no shipment 
will occur. Because no arbitrage opportunity exists after transportation costs are added, there 
will be no leveling of prices between the two markets and the price discrepancy will persist. 
Thus, even if PPP predicts that the Norwegian krone is overvalued, the effect of transportation 
costs will keep the dollar/krone exchange rate from adjusting. In a world in which transportation 
costs exist, PPP does not always correctly predict shifts in exchange rates.
Impact of Trade Barriers PPP also assumes that there are no barriers to international trade. 
However, such barriers certainly do exist. Governments establish trade barriers for many 
reasons, including helping domestic companies remain competitive and preserving jobs for their 
citizens. Suppose the Norwegian government in our earlier example imposes a 60 percent tariff 
on the $100 basket of imported goods or makes its importation illegal. Because no leveling of 
prices or exchange-rate adjustment will occur, PPP will fail to predict exchange rates accurately.
Impact of Business Confidence and Psychology Finally, PPP overlooks the human aspect 
of exchange rates—the role of people’s confidence and beliefs about a nation’s economy and 
the value of its currency. Many countries gauge confidence in their economies by conducting a

business confidence survey. The largest survey of its kind in Japan is called the tankan survey. It 
gauges business confidence four times each year among 10,000 companies.
Investor confidence in the value of a currency plays an important role in determining its 
exchange rate. Suppose several currency traders believe that the Indian rupee will increase in 
value. They will buy Indian rupees at the current price, sell them if the value increases, and 
earn a profit. However, suppose that all traders share the same belief and all follow the same 
course of action. The activity of the traders themselves will be sufficient to push the value of the 
Indian rupee higher. It does not matter why traders believed the price would increase. As long 
as enough people act on a similar belief regarding the future value of a currency, its value will 
change accordingly.
That is why nations try to maintain the confidence of investors, businesspeople, and 
consumers in their economies. Lost confidence causes companies to put off investing in new 
products and technologies and to delay the hiring of additional employees. Consumers tend to 
increase their savings and not increase their debts if they have lost confidence in an economy. 
These kinds of behaviors act to weaken a nation’s currency.

Fixed Exchange Rate Systems
So far in this chapter, we have read about the benefits of predictable and stable exchange rates. 
We also know that inflation and interest rates affect currency values and, in turn, exchange 
rates. For these and other reasons, governments have created formal and informal agreements 
to control exchange rates. The present-day international monetary system is the collection of 
agreements and institutions that govern exchange rates. In this section, we summarize attempts 
to construct a system of fixed exchange rates.
The gold Standard
In the earliest days of international trade, gold was the internationally accepted currency for pay-
ment of goods and services. Using gold as a medium of exchange in international trade had sev-
eral advantages. First, the limited supply of gold made it a commodity in high demand. Second, 
because gold is highly resistant to corrosion, it was able to be traded and stored for hundreds of 
years. Third, because it could be melted into either small coins or large bars, gold was a good 
medium of exchange for both small and large purchases.
But gold also had its disadvantages. First, the weight of gold made transporting it expensive. 
Second, when a transport ship sank at sea, the gold also sank to the ocean floor and was lost. Thus, 
merchants wanted a new way to make their international payments without the need to haul large 
amounts of gold around the world. The solution was found in the gold standard—an international 
monetary system in which nations linked the value of their paper currencies to specific values of 
gold. Britain was the first nation to implement the gold standard in the early 1700s.
PAr VALuE The gold standard required a nation to fix the value (price) of its currency to an 
ounce of gold. The value of a currency expressed in terms of gold is called its par value. Each 
nation then guaranteed to convert its paper currency into gold for anyone demanding it at its 
par value. The calculation of each currency’s par value was based on the concept of purchasing 
power parity. This provision made the purchasing power of gold the same everywhere and 
maintained the purchasing power of currencies across nations.

Chapter 10 • InternatIonal Monetary SySteM   289
All nations fixing their currencies to gold also indirectly linked their currencies to one 
another. Because the gold standard fixed nations’ currencies to the value of gold, it is called a 
fixed exchange-rate system—one in which the exchange rate for converting one currency into 
another is fixed by international governmental agreement. This system and the use of par values 
made calculating exchange rates between any two currencies a very simple matter. For example, 
under the gold standard, the U.S. dollar was originally fixed at $20.67/oz of gold and the British 
pound at £4.2474/oz. The exchange rate between the dollar and pound was $4.87/£ (which is 
$20.67 ÷ £4.2474).
ADVAnTAgES OF THE gOLD STAnDArD The gold standard was quite successful in its early 
years of operation. In fact, this early record of success is causing some economists and policy 
makers to call for its rebirth today. Three main advantages of the gold standard underlie its 
early success.
First, the gold standard drastically reduced the risk in exchange rates because it maintains 
highly fixed exchange rates between currencies. Deviations that did arise were much smaller 
than they are under a system of freely floating currencies. The more stable the exchange rates 
are, the less companies are affected by actual or potential adverse changes in them. Because the 
gold standard significantly reduced the risk in exchange rates and, therefore, the risks and costs 
of trade, international trade grew rapidly following its introduction.
Second, the gold standard imposed strict monetary policies on all countries that participated 
in the system. Recall that the gold standard required governments to convert paper currency into 
gold if demanded by holders of the currency. If all holders of a nation’s paper currency decided 
to trade it for gold, the government must have an equal amount of gold reserves to pay them. 
That is why a government could not allow the volume of its paper currency to grow faster than 
the growth in its reserves of gold. By limiting the growth of a nation’s money supply, the gold 
standard also was effective in controlling inflation.
Third, the gold standard could help correct a nation’s trade imbalance. Suppose Australia 
was importing more than it was exporting (experiencing a trade deficit). As gold flowed out of 
Australia to pay for imports, its government had to decrease the supply of paper currency in the 
domestic economy because it could not have paper currency in excess of its gold reserves. As 
the money supply fell, so did prices of goods and services in Australia because demand was fall-
ing (consumers had less to spend)—whereas the supply of goods was unchanged. Meanwhile, 
falling prices of Australian-made goods caused Australian exports to become cheaper on world 
markets. Exports rose until Australia’s international trade was once again in balance. The exact 
opposite occurred in the case of a trade surplus: The inflow of gold supported an increase in 
the supply of paper currency, which increased demand for, and therefore the cost of, goods and 
services. Thus, exports fell in reaction to their higher price until trade was once again in balance.
COLLAPSE OF THE gOLD STAnDArD Nations involved in the First World War needed to 
finance their enormous war expenses, and they did so by printing more paper currency. This 
certainly violated the fundamental principle of the gold standard and forced nations to abandon 
the standard. The aggressive printing of paper currency caused rapid inflation for these nations. 
When the United States returned to the gold standard in 1934, it adjusted its par value from 
$20.67/oz of gold to $35.00/oz to reflect the lower value of the dollar that resulted from 
inflation. Thus, the U.S. dollar had undergone devaluation. Yet Britain returned to the gold 
standard several years earlier at its previous level, which did not reflect the effect inflation had 
on its currency.
Because the gold standard links currencies to one another, devaluation of one currency in 
terms of gold affects the exchange rates between currencies. The decision of the United States 
to devalue its currency and Britain’s decision not to do so lowered the price of U.S. exports 
on world markets and increased the price of British goods imported into the United States. 
For example, whereas it had previously required $4.87 to purchase one British pound, it now 
required $8.24 (which is $35.00 ÷ £4.2474). This forced the cost of a £10 tea set exported from 
Britain to the United States to go from $48.70 before devaluation to $82.40 after devaluation. 
This drastically increased the price of imports from Britain (and other countries), lowering its 
export earnings. As countries devalued their currencies in retaliation, a period of “competitive 
devaluation” resulted. To improve their trade balances, nations chose arbitrary par values to 
fixed exchange-rate

which they devalued their currencies. People quickly lost faith in the gold standard because it 
was no longer an accurate indicator of a currency’s true value. By 1939, the gold standard was 
effectively dead.
Bretton Woods Agreement
In 1944, representatives from 44 nations met in the New Hampshire resort town of Bretton 
Woods to lay the foundation for a new international monetary system. The resulting Bretton 
Woods Agreement was an accord among nations to create a new international monetary sys-
tem based on the value of the U.S. dollar. The new system was designed to balance the strict 
discipline of the gold standard with the flexibility that countries needed in order to deal with 
temporary domestic monetary difficulties. Let’s briefly explore the most important features of 
this system.
FIxED ExCHAngE rATES The Bretton Woods Agreement incorporated fixed exchange rates 
by tying the value of the U.S. dollar directly to gold and the value of other currencies to the 
value of the dollar. The par value of the U.S. dollar was fixed at $35/oz of gold. Other currencies 
were then given par values against the U.S. dollar instead of gold. For example, the par value 
of the British pound was established as $2.40/£. Member nations were expected to keep their 
currencies from deviating more than 1 percent above or below their par values. The Bretton 
Woods Agreement also improved on the gold standard by extending the right to exchange gold 
for dollars only to national governments, rather than to anyone who demanded it.
BuILT-In FLExIBILITy The new system also incorporated a degree of built-in flexibility. For 
example, although competitive currency devaluation was ruled out, large devaluation was 
allowed under the extreme set of circumstances called fundamental disequilibrium—an 
economic condition in which a trade deficit causes a permanent negative shift in a country’s 
balance of payments. In this situation, a nation can devalue its currency more than 10 percent. 
Yet devaluation under these circumstances should accurately reflect a permanent economic 
change for the country in question, not temporary misalignments.
WOrLD BAnk To provide funding for countries’ efforts toward economic development, the 
Bretton Woods Agreement created the World Bank—officially called the International Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). The immediate purpose of the World Bank 
(www.worldbank.org) was to finance European reconstruction following the Second World 
War. It later shifted its focus to the general financial needs of developing countries. The World 
Bank finances many types of economic development projects in Africa, South America, and 
Southeast Asia. The World Bank also offers funds to countries that are unable to obtain capital 
from commercial sources for some projects that are considered too risky. The bank often 
undertakes projects to develop transportation networks, power facilities, and agricultural and 
educational programs.
InTErnATIOnAL MOnETAry FunD In addition, the Bretton Woods Agreement established 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the agency to regulate the fixed exchange rates and 
to enforce the rules of the international monetary system. At the time of its formation, the IMF 
(www.imf.org) had just 29 members—188 countries belong today. Included among the main 
purposes of the IMF are:3
• Promoting international monetary cooperation;
• Facilitating expansion and balanced growth of international trade;
• Promoting exchange stability, maintaining orderly exchange arrangements, and avoiding 
competitive exchange devaluation;
• Making the resources of the fund temporarily available to members;
• Shortening the duration and lessening the degree of disequilibrium in the international bal-
ance of payments of member nations.
Special Drawing right (SDr) World financial reserves of dollars and gold grew scarce in the 
1960s, at a time when the activities of the IMF demanded greater amounts of dollars and gold. 
The IMF reacted by creating what is called a special drawing right (SDR)—an IMF asset 
whose value is based on a weighted “basket” of four currencies, including the U.S. dollar,

European Union (EU) euro, Japanese yen, and British pound. Figure 10.3 shows the “weight” 
each currency contributes to the overall value of the SDR. The value of the SDR is set daily and 
changes with increases and declines in the values of its underlying currencies. Today there are 
more than 204 billion SDRs in existence worth slightly less than $300 billion (1 SDR equals 
about $1.47).4 The significance of the SDR is that it is the unit of account for the IMF. Each 
nation is assigned a quota based on the size of its economy when it enters the IMF. Payment of 
this quota by each nation provides the IMF with the funds it needs to make short-term loans to 
members.
COLLAPSE OF THE BrETTOn WOODS AgrEEMEnT The system developed at Bretton Woods 
worked quite well for about 20 years—an era that boasted unparalleled stability in exchange 
rates. But in the 1960s, the Bretton Woods system began to falter. The main problem was that 
the United States was experiencing a trade deficit (imports were exceeding exports) and a budget 
deficit (expenses were outstripping revenues). Governments that were holding dollars began to 
doubt that the U.S. government had an adequate amount of gold reserves to redeem all its paper 
currency held outside the country. When they began demanding gold in exchange for dollars, a 
large sell-off of dollars on world financial markets followed.
Smithsonian Agreement In August 1971, the U.S. government held less than one-fourth of the 
amount of gold needed to redeem all U.S. dollars in circulation. In late 1971, the United States 
and other countries reached the so-called Smithsonian Agreement to restructure and strengthen 
the international monetary system. The three main accomplishments of the Smithsonian 
Agreement were (1) to lower the value of the dollar in terms of gold to $38/oz, (2) to increase 
the values of other countries’ currencies against the dollar, and (3) to increase to 2.25 percent 
from 1 percent the band within which currencies were allowed to float.
Final Days The success of the Bretton Woods system relied on the U.S. dollar remaining a 
strong reserve currency. High inflation and a persistent trade deficit in the United States kept 
the dollar weak, however, which demonstrated a fundamental flaw in the system. The weak 
U.S. dollar strained the capabilities of central banks in Japan and most European countries to 
maintain exchange rates with the dollar. Because these nations’ currencies were tied to the U.S. 
dollar, as the dollar continued to fall, so too did their currencies. Britain left the system in the 
middle of 1972 and allowed the pound to float freely against the dollar. The Swiss abandoned 
the system in early 1973. In January 1973, the dollar was again devalued, this time to around 
$42/oz of gold. But even this move was not enough. As nations began dumping their reserves 
of the dollar on a massive scale, currency markets were temporarily closed to prevent further 
selling of the dollar. When markets reopened, the values of most major currencies were floating 
against the U.S. dollar. The era of an international monetary system based on fixed exchange 
rates was over.

 1. The gold standard is an example of what type of international monetary system?
 2. What were the main advantages of the gold standard?
 3. What is the name of the international monetary system that formed in 1944 following the 
demise of the gold standard?
System of Floating Exchange Rates
The Bretton Woods system collapsed because of its heavy dependence on the stability of the 
dollar. As long as the dollar remained strong, it worked well. But when the dollar weakened, it 
failed to perform properly. Originally, the new system of floating exchange rates was viewed as 
a temporary solution to the shortcomings of the Bretton Woods and Smithsonian Agreements. 
But no new coordinated international monetary system was forthcoming. Rather, there emerged 
several independent efforts to manage exchange rates.
JAMAICA AgrEEMEnT By January 1976, returning to a system of fixed exchange rates seemed 
unlikely. Therefore, world leaders met to draft the so-called Jamaica Agreement—an accord 
among members of the IMF to formalize the existing system of floating exchange rates as the 
new international monetary system. The Jamaica Agreement contained several main provisions. 
First, it endorsed a managed float system of exchange rates—that is, a system in which 
currencies float against one another, with governments intervening to stabilize their currencies 
at particular target exchange rates. This is in contrast to a free float system—a system in which 
currencies float freely against one another without governments intervening in currency markets.
Second, gold was no longer the primary reserve asset of the IMF. Member countries could 
retrieve their gold from the IMF if they so desired. Third, the mission of the IMF was aug-
mented: Rather than being only the manager of a fixed exchange-rate system, it was now also 
a “lender of last resort” for nations with balance-of-payment difficulties. Member contributions 
were increased to support the newly expanded activities of the IMF.
LATEr ACCOrDS Between 1980 and 1985, the U.S. dollar rose dramatically against other 
currencies, pushing up prices of U.S. exports and adding once again to a U.S. trade deficit. 
A solution was devised by the world’s five largest industrialized nations, known as the “G5” 
(Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and the United States). The Plaza Accord was a 1985 
agreement among the G5 nations to act together in forcing down the value of the U.S. dollar. The 
Plaza Accord caused traders to sell the dollar, and its value fell.
By February 1987, the industrialized nations were concerned that the value of the U.S. dol-
lar was in danger of falling too low. Meeting in Paris, leaders of the “G7” nations (the G5 plus 
Italy and Canada) drew up another agreement. The Louvre Accord was a 1987 agreement among 
the G7 nations that affirmed that the U.S. dollar was appropriately valued and that they would 
intervene in currency markets to maintain its current market value. Once again, currency mar-
kets responded, and the dollar stabilized.
Today’s Exchange-rate Arrangements
Today’s international monetary system remains in large part a managed float system, whereby 
most nations’ currencies float against one another and governments engage in limited interven-
tion to realign exchange rates. Within the larger monetary system, however, certain countries try 
to maintain more-stable exchange rates by tying their currencies to other currencies. Let’s take a 
brief look at two ways nations attempt to do this.
PEggED ExCHAngE-rATE ArrAngEMEnT Think of one country as a small lifeboat tethered 
to a giant cruise ship as it navigates choppy monetary waters. Many economists argue that rather 
than let their currencies face the tides of global currency markets alone, developing economies 
should tie them to other, more stable currencies. Pegged exchange-rate arrangements “peg” a 
country’s currency to a more stable and widely used currency in international trade. Countries 
then allow the exchange rate to fluctuate within a specified margin (usually 1 percent) around a 
central rate.

Chapter 10 • InternatIonal Monetary SySteM   293
Many small countries peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, the EU euro, the special draw-
ing right (SDR) of the IMF, or another individual currency. Belonging to this first category 
are the Bahamas, El Salvador, Iran, Malaysia, Netherlands Antilles, and Saudi Arabia. Other 
nations peg their currencies to groups, or “baskets,” of currencies. For example, Bangladesh and 
Burundi tie their currencies (the taka and Burundi franc, respectively) to those of their major 
trading partners. Other members of this second group are Botswana, Fiji, Kuwait, Latvia, Malta, 
and Morocco.
CurrEnCy BOArD A currency board is a monetary regime that is based on an explicit 
commitment to exchange domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange 
rate. The government with a currency board is legally bound to hold an amount of foreign 
currency that is at least equal to the amount of domestic currency. Because a currency board 
restricts a government from issuing additional domestic currency unless it has the foreign 
reserves to back it, it helps cap inflation. Thus, survival of a currency board depends on wise 
budget policies.
Thanks to a currency board, the country of Bosnia-Herzegovina built itself a strong and 
stable currency. Argentina had a currency board from 1991 until it was abandoned in early 2002, 
when the peso was allowed to float freely on currency markets. Other nations with currency 
boards include Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Djibouti, and Lithuania.
Doing business in an era of a managed float international monetary system means that 
companies need to monitor currency values. For a look at several approaches companies can use 
to counter the effects of a strong currency and of a weak currency, see this chapter’s Manager’s 
Briefcase, titled “Adjusting to Currency Swings.”
European Monetary System
Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, leaders of many EU nations did not give 
up hope for a system that could stabilize currencies and reduce exchange-rate risk. Their efforts 
became increasingly important as trade between EU nations continued to expand. In 1979, these 
nations created the European monetary system (EMS). The EMS was established to stabilize ex-
change rates, promote trade among nations, and keep inflation low through monetary discipline. 
The system was phased out when the EU adopted a single currency.
HOW THE SySTEM WOrkED The mechanism that limited the fluctuations of EU members’ 
currencies within a specified trading range (or target zone) was called the exchange rate

Monetary regime based on an

A strong and rising currency makes a nation’s exports more ex-
pensive. Here’s how companies can export successfully despite a 
strong currency:
• Prune Operations Cut costs and boost efficiency by down-
sizing staff and reworking factories at home to maintain pro-
duction levels, and pursue customers abroad when export 
 earnings decline.
• Adapt Products Win customer business and loyalty by tailor-
ing your products to the needs of global customers, and your 
company may retain its business despite your higher prices.
• Source Abroad Source abroad for raw materials and other 
inputs to the production process—your supplier will likely 
earn an extra profit, and you’ll get a better deal than is avail-
able domestically.
• Freeze Prices A last resort may be to freeze prices of goods 
in foreign markets—this might boost overall profits if sales 
improve.
A weak and falling currency makes a nation’s imports more 
 expensive. Here’s how companies can adjust to a weak currency:
• Source Domestically Source domestically for raw materi-
als and components to lower the cost of production inputs,  
to avoid exchange-rate risk, and to shorten the supply 
chain.
• Grow at Home Fight for the business of domestic customers 
now that imported products of foreign competitors are priced 
high because of their relatively strong currencies.
• Push Exports Exploit the price advantage you get from 
your country’s weak currency by expanding your reach 
and depth abroad—people love a good bargain in all 
countries.
• Reduce Expenses Counteract the rising cost of imported 
energy by using the latest communication and transportation 
technologies to reduce air travel, cut utility bills, and slash 
shipping costs.

mechanism (ERM). Members were required to keep their currencies within 2.25 percent of the 
highest- and lowest-valued currencies. To illustrate, suppose that a weakening French franc was 
about to reach the 2.25 percent variation in its exchange rate with the German mark. The central 
banks of both France and Germany were to drive the value of the French franc higher—forcing 
the exchange rate away from the 2.25 percent fluctuation limit. How did they do so? By buying 
up French francs on currency markets, thereby increasing demand for the franc and forcing its 
value higher.
The EMS was quite successful in its early years. Currency realignments were infrequent, 
and inflation was fairly well controlled. But in late 1992, both the British pound and the Italian 
lira had been on the lower fringe of the allowable 2.25 percent fluctuation range with the 
German mark for some time. Currency speculators began unloading their pounds and lira. The 
central banks of neither Britain nor Italy had enough money to buy their currencies on the open 
market. As their currencies’ values plummeted, they were forced to leave the ERM. The EMS 
was revised in late 1993 to allow currencies to fluctuate 15 percent up or down from the mid-
point of the target zone. Although the Italian lira returned to the ERM in November 1996, the 
British pound remained outside the ERM. Many European nations moved to the euro as their 
currency (see Chapter 8), which eliminated the need for the ERM.
Of the three nations (Britain, Denmark, and Sweden) that qualify to use the euro but have 
opted out, only Denmark participates in what is called the exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II). 
The ERM II was introduced January 1, 1999, and continues to function today. The aim of ERM 
II is to support nations that seek future membership in the European monetary union (see Chapter 
8) by linking their currencies to the euro. As such, Lithuania also currently participates in ERM 
II. The euro acts as the center of a hub and spokes model, to which each currency is linked on a 
bilateral basis. The currencies of participating countries have a central rate against the euro with 
acceptable fluctuation margins of 15 percent, although narrower margins can be arranged. Future 
accession countries to the EU are obliged to join the single currency once they satisfy the criteria 
of the Maastricht Treaty.

recent Financial Crises
Despite the best efforts of nations to head off financial crises within the international monetary 
system, the world has experienced several wrenching crises in recent years. Let’s examine the 
most prominent of these.
DEVELOPIng nATIOnS’ DEBT CrISIS By the early 1980s, certain developing countries 
(especially in Latin America) had amassed huge debts payable not only to large international 
commercial banks but also to the IMF and the World Bank. In 1982, Mexico, Brazil, and 
Argentina announced that they would be unable to pay interest on their loans. At the same time, 
many of these countries were also experiencing runaway inflation. Many countries in Africa 
were facing similar problems.
To prevent a meltdown of the entire financial system, international agencies stepped in 
with a number of temporary solutions to the crisis. Repayment schedules were revised to put 
off repayment further into the future. Then, in 1989, U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady 
unveiled the Brady Plan. The Brady Plan called for large-scale reduction of the debt owed by 
poorer nations, the exchange of old loans for new low-interest loans, and the making of debt 
instruments (based on these loans) that would be tradable on world financial markets. This last 
feature allowed a debtor country to receive a loan from an institution and then use it to buy 

 
Chapter 10 • InternatIonal Monetary SySteM   295
special securities (called “Brady Bonds”) on financial markets. Funds for these new loans came 
from private commercial banks and were backed by the IMF and the World Bank.
MExICO’S PESO CrISIS Armed rebellion in the poor Mexican state of Chiapas and the 
assassination of a presidential candidate shook investors’ faith in Mexico’s financial system 
in 1993 and 1994. Capital flowing into Mexico was mostly in the form of stocks and bonds 
(portfolio investment) rather than factories and equipment (foreign direct investment). Portfolio 
investment fled Mexico for the United States as the Mexican peso grew weak and U.S. interest 
rates rose. A lending spree by Mexican banks, coupled with weak banking regulations, also 
played a role in delaying the government’s response to the crisis. In late 1994, the Mexican peso 
was devalued, forcing a loss of purchasing power on the Mexican people.
In response to the crisis, the IMF and private commercial banks in the United States stepped 
in with about $50 billion in loans to shore up the Mexican economy. Thus, Mexico’s peso crisis 
contributed to an additional boost in the level of IMF loans. Mexico repaid the loans ahead of 
schedule and once again has a sizable reserve of foreign exchange.
SOuTHEAST ASIA’S CurrEnCy CrISIS The roar of the “four tiger” economies and those of 
other high-growth Asian nations suddenly fell silent in the summer of 1997. For 25 years, the 
economies of five Southeast Asian countries—Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, 
and Thailand—had wowed the world with growth rates twice those of most other countries. 
Even though many analysts projected continued growth for the region, and even though billions 
of dollars in investment flooded in from the West, savvy speculators were pessimistic.
On July 11, 1997, the speculators struck, selling off Thailand’s baht on world currency 
markets. The selling forced an 18 percent drop in the value of the baht before speculators moved 
on to the Philippines and Malaysia. By November, the baht had plunged another 22 percent, and 
every other economy in the region was in a slump. The shock waves of Asia’s crisis could be felt 
throughout the global economy.
Suddenly, countries thought to be strong emerging market economies—“tigers” to be 
emulated by other developing countries—were in need of billions of dollars to keep their 
economies from crumbling. When the dust settled, Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand all 
needed IMF and World Bank funding. As incentives for these countries to begin the long pro-
cess of economic restructuring, IMF loan packages came with a number of strings attached. 
For example, the Indonesian loan package involved three long-term goals to help put the 
Indonesian economy on a stronger footing: (1) to restore the confidence of international 
financial markets, (2) to restructure the domestic financial sector, and (3) to support domestic 
deregulation and trade reforms.
What caused the crisis in the first place? Well, it depends on whom you ask. Some believe 
it was caused by an Asian style of capitalism. They say that blame lies with poor regulation, 
the practice of extending loans to friends and relatives who are poor credit risks, and a lack of 
transparency regarding the financial health of banks and companies. Others point to poor man-
agement of these nations’ short-term debt obligations. Still others argue that persistent current 
account deficits in these countries are what caused the large dumping of these nations’ curren-
cies. What really caused the crisis is probably a combination of all these forces.5
ruSSIA’S ruBLE CrISIS Russia had a whole host of problems throughout the 1990s—some 
were constant, others were intermittent. For starters, Russia was not immune to the events 
unfolding across Southeast Asia in the late 1990s. As investors became wary of potential 
problems in other emerging markets worldwide, stock market values in Russia plummeted. 
Another problem contributing to Russia’s issues was depressed oil prices. Because Russia 
depends on oil production for a large portion of its gross domestic product (GDP), the low price 
of oil on world markets cut into the government’s reserves of hard currency. Also cutting into 
the government’s coffers was an unworkable tax-collection system and a large underground 
economy—meaning that most taxes went uncollected.
There also was the problem of inflation. We learned earlier in this chapter how an expanded 
amount of money chasing the same amount of goods forces prices higher. This is exactly what 
happened when Russia released prices in 1992. As prices skyrocketed, people dug beneath their 
mattresses where they had stashed their rubles during times when there were no goods to pur-
chase. We also saw earlier how inflation eats away at the value of a nation’s currency. Russia 

296  
part 4 • the InternatIonal FInanCIal SySteM
saw inflation take its exchange rate from less than 200 rubles to the dollar in early 1992 to more 
than 5,000 to the dollar in 1995.
Then in early 1996, as currency traders dumped the ruble, the Russian government found 
itself attempting to defend the ruble on currency markets. As its foreign exchange reserves dwin-
dled in a hopeless effort, the government asked for, and received, a $10 billion aid package from 
the IMF. In return, Russia promised to reduce its debt (which was averaging about 7 percent of 
GDP), collect taxes owed it, cease printing inflation-stoking sums of currency, and peg its cur-
rency to the dollar.
Things seemed to improve for a while, but then in mid-1998 the government found itself 
once again trying to defend the ruble against speculative pressure on currency markets. In a single 
day, the government spent $1 billion trying to prop up the ruble’s value, forcing its hard currency 
reserves to shrivel to $14 billion. As it grew obvious that the government would soon be bankrupt, 
the IMF stepped in and promised Russia another $11 billion. But when it was alleged that some 
of the IMF loan had been funneled into offshore bank accounts, the IMF held up distribution of 
the money. On August 17, 1998, badly strapped for cash, the government announced that it would 
allow the ruble to devalue by 34 percent by the end of the year. It also declared a 90-day foreign-
debt moratorium and announced a de facto default on the government’s domestic bond obligations. 
On August 26, the Russian Central Bank announced that it would no longer be able to support the 
ruble on currency markets. In less than one month, its value fell 300 percent. Inflation shot up to 
15 percent a month in August from 0.2 percent in July and reached 30 percent in the first week of 
September. By the time it was all over in late 1998, the IMF had lent Russia more than $22 billion.
ArgEnTInA’S PESO CrISIS Argentina was the star of Latin America in the early and mid-
1990s. Yet by late 2001, Argentina had been in recession for nearly four years, mainly because 
of Brazil’s devaluation of its own currency in 1999—making Brazil’s exports cheaper on world 
markets. Meanwhile, Argentina’s goods remained relatively expensive because its own currency 
was linked to a very strong U.S. dollar through a currency board. As a result, Argentina saw 
much of its export business dry up and its economy slow significantly. By late 2001, the IMF 
had already promised $48 billion to rescue Argentina.
Things came to a head when the country began running out of money to service its debt 
obligations. The country finally defaulted on its $155 billion of public debt in early 2002, the 
largest default ever by any country. The government scrapped its currency board that linked the 
peso to the U.S. dollar, and the peso quickly lost around 70 percent of its value on currency mar-
kets. The government, strapped for cash, seized the savings accounts of its citizens and restricted 
how much they could withdraw at a time.

Argentina has seen its economy ride a roller coaster of sorts since its 2001–2002 collapse. 
From 2001 through 2002, the economy shrank by 15 percent, unemployment shot up to 21 percent, 
and poverty engulfed 56 percent of its citizens. The government’s plan of stimulating demand by 
raising wages, imposing price controls, keeping the peso low, and spending public funds worked 
for a time. But inflation reached 26 percent in 2012, cutting consumers’ purchasing power and 
increasing poverty.
Future of the International Monetary System
Recurring crises in the international monetary system are raising calls for a new system that is 
designed to meet the challenges of a global economy. Many believe that the vestiges of the IMF 
created by the Bretton Woods Agreement are no longer adequate to insulate the world’s econo-
mies from disruptions in a single country or a small group of countries.
Meanwhile, leaders of many developing and newly industrialized countries are bemoaning 
what global capital has done to their economies. Although some call for the elimination of the 
IMF and its replacement by institutions not yet clearly defined, more likely will be revision of 
the IMF and its policy prescriptions. Efforts have already been made to develop internationally 
accepted codes of good practice to allow comparisons of countries’ fiscal and monetary prac-
tices. Countries have also been encouraged to be more open and clear regarding their financial 
policies. Transparency on the part of the IMF is also being increased to instill greater account-
ability on the part of its leadership. The IMF also is increasing its efforts at surveillance of mem-
ber nations’ macroeconomic policies and is increasing its abilities in the area of financial-sector 
analysis.
Yet, orderly ways must still be found to integrate international financial markets so that 
risks are better managed. Moreover, the private sector must become involved in the prevention 
and resolution of financial crises. Policy makers are concerned with the way money floods into 
developing economies when growth is strong and then just as quickly heads for the exits at the 
first sign of trouble. Furthermore, some argue that because the IMF bails out debtor countries, 
private-sector banks do not exercise adequate caution when loaning money in risky situations—
after all, the IMF will be there to pay off the loans of debtor countries. Greater cooperation and 
understanding among the IMF, private-sector banks, and debtor nations are needed.

intervening to stabilize currencies at target rates is called a what?

R
ecent financial crises underscore the need for managers to fully 
understand the complexities of the international financial sys-
tem. But this knowledge must be paired with vigilance of financial 
market conditions in order to manage businesses effectively. Here 
we focus on the main implications for business strategy and fore-
casting earnings and cash flows.
Implications for Business Strategy
Exchange rates influence all sorts of business activities for domes-
tic and international companies. A weak currency (valued low rela-
tive to other currencies) lowers the price of a nation’s exports on 
world markets and raises the price of imports. Lower prices make 
the country’s exports more appealing on world markets. This gives 
companies the opportunity to take market share away from com-
panies whose products are priced higher in comparison.
Although a government might devalue its currency to give 
domestic companies an edge over competition from other coun-
tries, devaluation reduces the buying power of the home country 
consumers. Devaluation might also allow inefficiencies to persist in 
domestic companies because it can lessen concern for production 
costs. A company improves its profits if it is selling in a country with 
a strong currency (one that is valued high relative to other curren-
cies) while paying workers in a country with a weak currency. But 
companies that benefit from a temporary price advantage caused 
by exchange rates must not grow complacent about their own 
long-term competitiveness.

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Describe the importance of exchange rates to business activities.
• When a country’s currency is weak (valued low relative to other currencies), the price 
of its exports on world markets declines (making exports more appealing on world 
markets) and the price of imports rises. A strong currency has the opposite effects.
• The intentional lowering of a currency’s value by a nation’s government is called 
devaluation. The intentional raising of a currency’s value by a nation’s government is 
called revaluation.
• The efficient market view says that prices of financial instruments reflect all publicly 
available information at any given time, whereas the inefficient market view says that 
they do not.
• Fundamental analysis uses statistical models based on fundamental economic indica-
tors to forecast exchange rates. Technical analysis employs charts of past trends in 
currency prices and other factors to forecast exchange rates.
 LO2. Outline the factors that help determine exchange rates.
• The law of one price says that when price is expressed in a common currency, an 
identical product must have an identical price in all countries. The theory of purchas-
ing power parity (PPP) can be interpreted as the exchange rate between two nations’ 
currencies that is equal to the ratio of their price levels.
• Inflation erodes purchasing power and affects exchange rates among currencies. Low 
interest rates lower borrowing costs and encourage spending and higher debt; high 
interest rates have the opposite effects.
• Because real interest rates are theoretically equal across countries, any interest rate 
difference between two countries must be due to different expected rates of inflation.
• A country experiencing inflation higher than that of another country should see the 
relative value of its currency fall.
 LO3. Explain attempts to construct a system of fixed exchange rates.
• The gold standard required a nation to fix the value (price) of its currency to an 
ounce of gold, which also indirectly linked currencies to each other. Competitive 
 devaluations among countries put an end to the gold standard.
Forecasting Earnings and Cash Flows
Exchange rates also affect the amount of profit a company earns 
from its international subsidiaries. The earnings of international 
subsidiaries are typically integrated into the parent company’s 
financial statements in the home currency. Translating subsidiary 
earnings from a weak host country currency into a strong home 
currency reduces the amount of these earnings when stated in the 
home currency. Likewise, translating earnings into a weak home 
currency increases stated earnings in the home currency.
Sudden, unfavorable movements in exchange rates can be costly 
for both domestic and international companies. On the other hand, 
stable exchange rates improve the accuracy of financial planning, 
including cash flow forecasts. Although companies can insure (usu-
ally by currency hedging) against potentially adverse movements in 
exchange rates, most available methods are too expensive for small 
and medium-sized businesses. Moreover, as the unpredictability of 
exchange rates increases, so too does the cost of insuring against 
the accompanying risk.
Managers also prefer movements in exchange rates to be 
predictable. Predictable exchange rates reduce the likelihood 
that companies will be caught off guard by sudden and unex-
pected rate changes. They also reduce the need for costly insur-
ance against possible adverse movements in exchange rates. 
Rather than purchasing insurance, companies would be better 
off spending their money on more productive activities, such as 
developing new products or designing more-efficient production 
methods.
As we saw in this chapter, not only are a company’s financial de-
cisions affected by events in international financial markets, so too 
are production and marketing decisions. The next chapter begins 
our in-depth look at the main aspects of managing an international 
business. Our understanding of national business environments, 
international trade and investment, and the international financial 
system will serve us well as we embark on our tour of the nuances 
of international business management.

 
Chapter 10 • InternatIonal Monetary SySteM   299
• The Bretton Woods Agreement (1944) created an international monetary system 
based on the value of the U.S. dollar and used the gold standard to link paper curren-
cies to specific values of gold.
• The most important features of the Bretton Woods system were fixed exchange rates, 
built-in flexibility, funds for economic development, and an enforcement mechanism.
• The International Monetary Fund (IMF) regulates fixed exchange rates and enforces 
the rules of the international monetary system.
 LO4. Describe efforts to create a system of floating exchange rates.
• The Jamaica Agreement (1976) endorsed a managed float system of exchange rates 
in which limited government intervention stabilized currencies at target exchange 
rates. The Plaza Accord and the Louvre Accord were later attempts to realign 
 exchange rates to their targets.
• Today, a nation may “peg” its currency to another nation’s currency that is more 
stable and more widely used internationally. Another option is for a country to use a 
currency board, which controls currency printing and helps cap inflation.
• The Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the European Union limited member 
countries’ currencies within a target range to pave the way for adoption of the EU 
single currency, the euro. An ERM II helps a nation that has not adopted the euro 
to prepare for eventual adoption or to link its currency to the euro to reduce wild 
fluctuations.

 Talk About It 1
The financial booms and busts over recent years cause some people to call for a return to the 
gold standard. They point out that the gold standard reduced exchange-rate risk, imposed 
strict monetary policies on nations, and helped correct national trade imbalances.

 10-2. Do you think a global version of the European monetary system would work today? 
Explain.
 Talk About It 2
When speculators sell a currency on a massive scale, a government is often forced to step 
in and spend billions of dollars supporting the currency’s value on the open market. Some 
argue that currency speculators are “immoral” and say currency trading should only be 
 allowed to facilitate deals between countries.
 10-3. Is it ethical for global currency speculators to profit on a massive scale by betting 
against a currency, perhaps sending an entire economy into a tailspin?
 10-4. Do you think that currency speculators perform a valuable service by correcting over-
valued or undervalued currencies?

Ethical Challenge
Your CEO is concerned that payments to overseas suppliers have been haphazard in the past 
and that money has been lost by not timing payments to take advantage of temporary changes 
in the exchange rates. He has asked you to investigate the possibility of creating exchange rate 
forecasts and whether these could be of value to the business in making sure that payments are 
made at favorable times. He has heard that there are two distinctive ways of carrying out the 
forecasts and also wants to know whether it is advisable to combine the two approaches. It is 
his opinion that the business will be able to make significant savings if the exchange rates are 
forecasted from now on.
 10-5. Briefly explain both fundamental analysis and technical analysis and what might be 
 involved in compiling the data needed. He needs a clear picture of the processes.

Chapter 10 • InternatIonal Monetary SySteM   301
Banking on Forgiveness
W
hen James Wolfensohn became head of the World Bank, 
he bluntly admitted the bank had “screwed up” in Africa. 
Decades of loans had erected a vast modern infrastructure (dams, 
roads, and power plants) for Africa’s poor, but the gap between rich 
and poor did not narrow. In fact, the policies of the bank and global 
financial regulators had created a new crisis in sub-Saharan Africa: 
These nations were now mired in debt they could not possibly repay. 
Africa’s total debt at the time almost equaled the annual gross na-
tional product of the entire continent. For instance, in Mozambique, 
where 25 percent of all children die from infectious disease before 
the age of five, the government was spending twice as much paying 
off debt as it was spending on health care and education.
But just when many countries were receiving debt relief, the 
debate over aid versus loans arose again. Groups debated how to 
prevent economic collapses and debt problems in the develop-
ing world and how to use dwindling aid more efficiently. Some 
countries wanted to give more foreign aid but wanted the money 
to be given as grants to financially and politically stable nations. 
They also wanted World Bank funds to be given to poor nations as 
grants and not loans that nations would need to repay.
Other nations feared that giving the money away as grants 
would drain the World Bank’s coffers, as well as their own. They 
acknowledged that they may not be able to do as much for the 
least-developed countries, but that the role of the World Bank, 
after all, is to act as a bank and not a donor. Support for this view 
was World Bank data that showed more than 95 percent of all 
loans are repaid and that poor nations are more careful with loans 
than they are with handouts.
For years, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), such as 
advocacy group Oxfam International, had lobbied the Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to write off loans to their 
poorest borrowers, calling for “debt forgiveness” or “debt relief.” 
Fortunately for the African people and their advocates, the new 
head of the bank put debt forgiveness at the top of his agenda. In 
the fall of 1996, the World Bank and the IMF announced a plan 
to reduce the external debt of the world’s poorest, most heavily 
indebted countries. The purpose of the plan, called the Heavily 
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative, is to slash overall 
debt stocks by 50 percent, lower poor nations’ debt service, and 
boost social spending in poor nations. The HIPC initiative has 
identified countries in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Middle 
East that may qualify for debt reduction. But debt relief is not 
automatic. The international banking community is using debt as 
both a carrot and a stick: Whereas nations with good reform re-
cords will get relief, those without reforms will not.
Then, in 2006, the world’s largest international lending institu-
tions launched the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) to 
work alongside the HIPC initiative to help countries reach their 
debt-relief goals. As of late 2014, of the 39 countries eligible 
or potentially eligible for HIPC assistance, 35 are receiving full 
debt relief from the IMF and other creditors. And all 39 countries 
have had their debt stocks reduced by 80 percent, have seen their 
debt service as a percentage of GDP drop from 114 percent to 35 
percent.
One success story is Uganda. Uganda was the first country 
declared eligible for assistance in 1997 and was the first to receive 
debt relief under the HIPC initiative in 1998. The decision to 
begin the program with Uganda was not an arbitrary one. While 
under the brutal dictatorship of Idi Amin, Uganda was treated as 
a pariah by creditors. But then President Yoweri Museveni led 
the country through a decade-long process of economic reform. 
Uganda became a model country, boasting a steady growth rate of 
around 5 percent, with coffee as its main export. By offering debt 
relief to Uganda, the World Bank and the IMF rewarded Uganda’s 
exemplary track record by reducing its debt to the lowest possible 
level—about twice the value of its exports. Savings from the debt-
relief program are pledged to improve health care and to make 
primary education available to all Ugandan families.
Thinking globally
 10-18. The World Bank and the IMF had once argued that the 
leniency of debt forgiveness would make it more difficult 
for themselves to borrow cheaply on the world’s capital 
markets. If you were a World Bank donor, would you sup-
port the HIPC Debt Initiative or argue against it?  
Explain.
 10-19. While working together on the HIPC Debt Initiative, 
things came to a standstill when the IMF gave a more 
optimistic forecast for Uganda’s coffee exports than did 
the World Bank and so argued against the need for debt 
relief. Which organization do you think should play a 
greater role in aiding economic development? Explain.

Flying High with Low Fares
DUBLIN, Ireland—No one is more successful than Ryanair (www.ryanair.com) at 
offering no-frills flying, shuttling more than 81 million passengers a year across Europe. 
Ryanair’s fares are around 50 percent lower than Europe’s big national carriers, and 
sometimes even one-tenth as much. In 30 years, Ryanair has grown from offering one 
flight a day between Ireland and England to more than 1,600 routes between 29 nations 
that connect 180 destinations.
Ryanair has successfully carved 
out a niche among the flying public. 
Describing his company’s approach, 
CEO Michael O’Leary (pictured here) 
said, “It’s very simple. We’re like 
Walmart in the United States—we pile 
it high and sell it cheap.” Ryanair’s strat-
egy is to use less-congested, secondary 
airports just outside Europe’s  biggest 
cities. Instead of serving London’s 
Heathrow or Gatwick airport, Ryanair 
flies into Stansted. And rather than fly 
to Germany’s Frankfurt Main airport, 
Ryanair services Hahn, a former U.S. 
fighter base 60 miles west of Frankfurt. 
With the flying public trying to save 
money during the recent global reces-
sion, Ryanair’s low-cost strategy helped 
it take even more market share away 
from the national carriers.
Ryanair’s strategy lets it negotiate airport fees as low as $1.50 per passenger as op-
posed to the $15 to $22 per passenger charged by Europe’s major airports. Ryanair also 
slashes other expenses to achieve its mission: For example, not serving ice with drinks 
saves Ryanair $50,000 a year. Charging passengers for checked baggage means fewer 
bags, which saves fuel and cuts the cost of ground services. And rather than serve free 
water on flights, Ryanair charges several dollars a bottle.
Ryanair is hot on the heels of big national carriers, such as British Airways, 
Lufthansa in Germany, and Alitalia in Italy. Ryanair once painted “Arrivederci Alitalia” 
on one of its planes to anger its Italian competitor. O’Leary’s confidence in his strategy 
made Ryanair the monster to be reckoned with in Europe. As you read this chapter, 
consider the creative strategies companies use to out-compete rivals and serve their 
customers.1

Planning is the process of identifying and selecting an organization’s objectives and deciding 
how the organization will achieve those objectives. In turn, strategy is the set of planned actions 
taken by managers to help a company meet its objectives. The key to developing an effective 
strategy, then, is to define a company’s objectives (or goals) clearly and to plan carefully how it 
will achieve those goals. This requires a company to undertake an analysis of its own capabili-
ties and strengths in order to identify what it can do better than the competition. It also means 
that a company must carefully assess the competitive environment and the national and interna-
tional business environments in which it operates.
A well-defined strategy helps a company compete effectively in increasingly competitive 
international markets. It serves to coordinate a company’s various divisions and departments so 
that the company reaches its overall goals in the most effective and efficient manner possible. A 
clear, appropriate strategy focuses a company on the activities that it performs best and on the 
industries for which it is best suited. It keeps an organization away from a future of mediocre 
performance or total failure. An inappropriate strategy can lead a manager to take actions that 
pull a company in opposite directions or take it into industries it knows little about.
Managers confront similar concerns whether formulating a strategy for a domestic or an 
international company. Both types of firms must determine what products to produce, where to 
produce them, and where and how to market them. The biggest difference lies in complexity. 
Companies considering international production need to select from many potential countries, 
each likely having more than one possible location. Depending on its product line, a com-
pany that wants to market internationally might have an equally large number of markets to 
consider. Whether it is being considered as a site for operations or as a potential market, each 
international location has a rich mixture of cultural, political, legal, and economic traditions 
and processes. All these factors add to the complexity of planning and formulating strategy for 
international managers.
We begin this chapter by exploring important factors that managers consider when analyz-
ing their companies’ strengths and weaknesses. We examine the different international strate-
gies and the corporate-, business-, and department-level strategies that companies implement. 
Next, we address the centralization versus decentralization decision and the issues of coordi-
nation and flexibility—key issues behind the selection of organizational structure. Finally, we 
explore the different types of organizational structures that companies use to coordinate their 
international activities.
Company Analysis
The process of formulating a strategy permits managers to step back from day-to-day activi-
ties and get a fresh perspective on the current and future direction of the company and its 
industry. As shown in Figure 11.1, we regard strategy formulation as a three-stage process. 
Stages 1 and 2 involve company analysis and are discussed here. Stage 3 entails the actual 
selecting and formulating of strategies and is presented in the next major section titled 
“Strategy Formulation.”
Company Mission and Goals
Most companies have a general purpose for why they exist, which they express in a mission 
statement—a written statement of why a company exists and what it plans to accomplish. For 
example, one company might set out to supply the highest level of service in a market segment—
a clearly identifiable group of potential buyers. Another might strive to be the lowest-cost sup-
plier in its segment worldwide. The mission statement often guides decisions such as which 
industries to enter or exit and how to compete in chosen segments.
TyPEs Of MissiOn sTATEMEnTs Mission statements often spell out how a company’s 
operations affect its stakeholders—all parties, ranging from suppliers and employees to 
stockholders and consumers, who are affected by a company’s activities. Some companies place 
corporate brands center stage and place the mission of creating well-liked brands above all else. 
The mission statements of other businesses focus on other issues, including superior shareholder 
returns, profitability, market share, and corporate social responsibility. Still other companies 
make their mission to be the interests of consumers. For example, the mission statement of

global eye-care company Bausch & Lomb (www.bausch.com) focuses on the customer and 
reads as follows:
Bausch & Lomb is the eye health company, dedicated to perfecting vision and enhancing 
life for consumers around the world®.2
The mission statement of an international business depends on (among other things) the 
type of business it is in, the stakeholders it is trying most to satisfy, and the aspect of business 
most important to achieving its goals. Yet companies must be sensitive to the needs of its differ-
ent stakeholders in different nations. A company might need to balance the needs of stockhold-
ers for financial returns in the home nation, the needs of buyers for good value in a consumer 
market, and the needs of the public at large where it has a production facility.
Managers must also define the objectives they wish to achieve in the global marketplace. 
Objectives at the highest level in a company tend to be stated in the most general terms. An 
example of this type of objective is the following:
To be the largest global company in each industry in which we compete.
Objectives of individual business units in an organization tend to be more specific. They 
are normally stated in more concrete terms and sometimes even contain numerical targets. For 
example, such a mission statement could be stated as follows:
To mass-produce a zero-pollution-emissions automobile by 2020.
Objectives usually become even more precise at the level of individual departments and 
almost always contain numerical targets of performance. For example, the following could be 
the objective of a marketing and sales department:
To increase global market share by 5 percent in each of the next three years.
Core Competency and Value-Creation
Before managers formulate effective strategies, they must analyze the company, its industry (or 
industries), and the national business environments in which it is involved. They should also 
examine industries and countries being targeted for potential future entry. In this section we ad-
dress the company and its industries. We examine the business environment in the next section.

UniqUE ABiLiTiEs Of COMPAniEs Although large multinational companies are often involved 
in multiple industries, most perform one activity (or a few activities) better than any competitor 
does. A core competency is a special ability of a company that competitors find extremely 
difficult or impossible to equal. It is not a skill; individuals possess skills. For example, an 
architect’s ability to design an office building in the Victorian style is a skill. A core competency 
refers to multiple skills that are coordinated to form a single technological outcome.
Although skills can be learned through on-the-job training and personal experience, core 
competencies develop over longer periods of time and are difficult to teach. At one point, Canon 
of Japan (www.canon.com) purchased expertise in optic technology but only later succeeded in 
developing a variety of products based on optic technology—including cameras, copiers, and 
semiconductor lithographic equipment. Likewise, Sony (www.sony.com) for decades relied on 
its core competency in miniaturizing electronic components in order to fortify its global lead-
ership position in consumer electronics. These companies possessed unique abilities to create 
superior products through development of their core competencies.
How do managers actually go about analyzing and identifying their firms’ unique abili-
ties? Let’s explore a tool commonly used by managers to analyze their companies—value-chain 
analysis.
VALUE-ChAin AnALysis Managers must select strategies consistent with their company’s 
particular strengths and the market conditions the firm faces. Managers should also select 
company strategies based on what the company does that customers find valuable. This is why 
managers conduct a value-chain analysis—the process of dividing a company’s activities into 
primary and support activities and identifying those that create value for customers.3
As we see in Figure 11.2, value-chain analysis divides a company’s activities into primary 
activities and support activities that are central to creating customer value. Primary activities 
include inbound and outbound logistics, production (goods and services), marketing and sales, and 
customer service. Primary activities involve the creation of the product, its marketing and delivery 
to buyers, and its after-sales support and service. Support activities include business infrastructure, 
human resource management, technology development, and procurement (sourcing). Each of these 
activities provides the inputs and infrastructure required by the primary activities.
Each primary and support activity is a source of strength or weakness for a company. 
Managers determine whether each activity enhances or detracts from customer value, and they 
incorporate this knowledge into the strategy-formulation process. Analysis of primary and sup-
port activities often involves finding activities in which improvements can be made with large 
benefits.
Primary Activities When analyzing primary activities, managers often look for areas in which 
the company can increase the value provided to its customers. For example, managers might 
examine production processes and discover new, more-efficient manufacturing methods in order 
to reduce production costs and improve quality. Customer satisfaction might be increased by

improving logistics management to shorten the time it takes to get a product to the buyer or by 
providing better customer service.
Companies might also lower costs by introducing greater automation into the production 
process. Computer maker Acer (www.acer.com) applied a fast-food production model to per-
sonal computer manufacturing. Rather than manufacture complete computers in Asia and ship 
them around the world, Acer builds components at plants scattered throughout the world. Those 
components are then shipped to assembly plants, where computers are built according to cus-
tomer specifications. Acer adopted this approach because there was no longer any value added 
in simply assembling computers. By altering its production and logistics processes, Acer devel-
oped a business model that created value for customers.
support Activities Support activities assist companies in performing their primary activities. 
For example, the actions of any company’s employees are crucial to its success. Production, 
logistics, marketing, sales, and customer service all benefit when employees are qualified 
and well trained. International companies can often improve the quality of their products 
by investing in worker training and management development. In turn, ensuring quality can 
increase the efficiency of a firm’s manufacturing, marketing and sales, and customer service 
activities. Effective procurement (or sourcing) can locate low-cost, high-quality raw materials 
or intermediate products and ensure on-time delivery to production facilities. Finally, a 
sophisticated infrastructure not only improves internal communication but also supports 
organizational culture and each primary activity.
The in-depth analysis of a company that is inherent in the strategy-formulation process 
helps managers to discover their company’s unique core competency and abilities and to identify 
the activities that create customer value. For a checklist of issues companies should consider in 
a self-analysis of whether it is ready to go global, see this chapter’s Manager’s Briefcase, titled 
“Ask Questions before Going Global.”
A company cannot identify its unique abilities in a vacuum, separate from the environment 
in which it operates. The external business environment consists of all the elements outside a 
company that can affect its performance, such as cultural, political, legal, and economic forces; 
workers’ unions; consumers; and financial institutions. Let’s explore several of these environ-
mental forces that affect strategy formulation.

language, religious beliefs, customs, traditions, and climate complicate strategy formulation. 
Language differences can increase the cost of operations and administration. Manufacturing 
It seems everywhere a business turns for advice these days it hears 
the mantra, “Go global.” But a company needs a solid grasp of 
its capabilities and its product if it is going to be successful in 
global markets. Here is a brief checklist of issues for a business to 
consider:
• Are You Ready? Do you or your key personnel speak other 
languages? Have you or they lived in other cultures for ex-
tended periods? How long has your company been in busi-
ness? What markets might need what your company sells? 
Can your business withstand the rough seas of global trade? 
What specific sales numbers are forecasted? Can you map 
your global business journey?
• Is Your Product Ready? Can your business capitalize on its 
strengths? Will you need to modify your product or your mar-
keting approach? Will modifying the product or its market-
ing weaken your offering? Does your product satisfy all local 
safety standards and other regulations? Can your product 
stand up to the competition and to the scrutiny of customers?
• Is Each Department Ready? Is your company’s infrastructure 
capable of going global? Does each department (logistics, 
operations, marketing, sales, service, human resources, col-
lections, etc.) have the resources to handle its international 
responsibilities? What is your company’s financial strategy for 
international expansion? Can domestic sales support an initial 
period of money-losing international operations? Is everyone 
in the company committed to the international effort?
• Is Your Strategy Ready? Will your company’s international 
effort conflict with or complement your overall business strat-
egy? Will your company’s foreignness be a hindrance, or can 
it be exploited profitably? Is your business capable of sustain-
ing a lengthy international endeavor? How will your company 
break into long-established family networks and business 
relationships?

processes must sometimes be adapted to the supply of local workers and to local customs, 
traditions, and practices. Marketing activities sometimes can result in costly mistakes if they do 
not incorporate cultural differences. For example, a company once decided to sell its laundry 
detergent in Japan but did not adjust the size of the box in which it was sold. The company 
spent millions of dollars developing a detailed marketing campaign and was shocked when 
it experienced disappointing sales. It turned out that the company should have packaged the 
detergent in smaller containers for the Japanese market. Japanese shoppers prefer smaller 
quantities because they tend to walk home from the store and have smaller storage areas in tight 
living quarters.
Differences in political and legal systems also complicate international strategies. Legal and 
political processes often differ in target countries to such an extent that firms must hire outside 
consultants to teach them about the local system. Such knowledge is important to international 
companies because the approval of the host government is almost always necessary for making 
direct investments. Companies need to know which ministry or department has the authority to 
grant approval for a big business deal—a process that can become extremely cumbersome. For 
example, non-Chinese companies in China must often get approval to conduct business from 
several separate agencies. The process is further complicated by the tendency of local govern-
ment officials to interpret laws differently than do bureaucrats in Beijing (the nation’s capital).
Different national economic systems further complicate strategy formulation. Negative 
attitudes of local people toward the impact of direct investment can generate political unrest. 
Economic philosophy affects the tax rates that governments impose. Whereas socialist economic 
systems normally levy high taxes on business profits, free-market economies tend to levy lower 
taxes. The need to work in more than one currency also complicates international strategy. To 
minimize losses from currency fluctuations, companies must develop strategies to deal with 
exchange-rate risk.
Finally, apart from complicating strategy, the national business environment can affect the 
location in which a company chooses to perform an activity. For example, a nation that spends 
a high portion of its GDP on research and development (R&D) attracts high-tech industries and 
high-wage jobs and, as a result, prospers. By contrast, countries that spend relatively little in the 
way of R&D tend to have lower levels of prosperity.

 3. Value-chain analysis involves separating a company’s activities into what two categories of

Strategy Formulation
As we have seen, the strengths and special capabilities of an international company, along with 
the environmental forces it faces, strongly influence its strategy. Let’s examine this third stage in 
the planning and strategy-formulation process.
Two international strategies
Companies engaged in international business activities can approach the market using either a 
multinational or a global strategy. It is important to note that these two strategies do not include 
companies that export. Exporters do not have foreign direct investments in other national mar-
kets and should instead devise an appropriate export strategy (see Chapter 13). Let’s now exam-
ine what it means for a company to follow a multinational or a global strategy.
MULTinATiOnAL sTrATEGy Some international companies choose to follow a multinational 
(multidomestic) strategy—a strategy of adapting products and their marketing strategies in 
each national market to suit local preferences. In other words, a multinational strategy is just

what its name implies—a separate strategy for each of the multiple nations in which a company 
markets its products. To implement a multinational strategy, companies often establish largely 
independent, self-contained units (or subsidiaries) in each national market. Each subsidiary 
typically undertakes its own product research and development, production, and marketing. In 
many ways, each unit functions largely as an independent company. Multinational strategies are 
often appropriate for companies in industries in which buyer preferences do not converge across 
national borders, such as certain food products and some print media.
The main benefit of a multinational strategy is that it allows companies to monitor buyer 
preferences closely in each local market and to respond quickly and effectively to emerging 
buyer preferences. Companies hope that customers will perceive a tailored product as delivering 
greater value than do competitors’ products. A multinational strategy, then, should allow a com-
pany to charge higher prices and/or gain market share.
The main drawback of a multinational strategy is that companies cannot exploit scale 
economies in product development, manufacturing, or marketing. The multinational strategy 
typically increases the cost structure for international companies and forces them to charge 
higher prices to recover such costs. As such, a multinational strategy is usually poorly suited to 
industries in which price competitiveness is a key success factor. The high degree of indepen-
dence with which each unit operates also may reduce opportunities to share knowledge among 
units within a company.
GLOBAL sTrATEGy Other companies decide that what suits their operations is a global strategy—a 
strategy of offering the same products using the same marketing strategy in all national markets. 
Companies that follow a global strategy often take advantage of scale and location economies 
by producing entire inventories of products or components in a few optimal locations. They also 
tend to perform product research and development in one or a few locations and typically design 
promotional campaigns and advertising strategies at headquarters. So-called global products are 
most common in industries characterized by price competition and, therefore, pressure to contain 
costs. They include certain electronic components, a wide variety of industrial goods such as steel, 
and some consumer goods such as paper and writing instruments.
The main benefit of a global strategy is cost savings due to product and marketing standard-
ization. These cost savings can then be passed on to consumers to help the company gain market 
share in its market segment. A global strategy also allows managers to share lessons learned in 
one market with managers at other locations.
The main problem with a global strategy is it can cause a company to overlook important 
differences in buyer preferences from one market to another. A global strategy does not allow a 
company to modify its products except for the most superficial features, such as the color of paint 
applied to a finished product or a small add-on feature. This can present a competitor with an 
opportunity to step in and satisfy any unmet needs of local buyers, thereby creating a niche market.
In addition to deciding whether the company will follow a multinational or a global 
 strategy, managers must formulate strategies for the corporation, each business unit, and each 
department. Let’s look closely at the three different levels of company strategy: corporate-, busi-
ness-, and department-level strategies (see Figure 11.3).
Corporate-Level strategies
Companies involved in more than one line of business must first formulate a corporate-level 
strategy. This means, in part, identifying the national markets and industries in which the com-
pany will operate. It also involves developing overall objectives for the company’s different 
business units and specifying the role that each unit will play in reaching those objectives. The 
four key approaches to corporate strategy are growth, retrenchment, stability, and combination.
GrOwTh sTrATEGy A growth strategy is designed to increase the scale or scope of a 
corporation’s operations. Scale refers to the size of a corporation’s activities, scope to the kinds 
of activities it performs. Yardsticks commonly used to measure growth include geographic 
coverage, number of business units, market share, sales revenue, and number of employees. 
Organic growth refers to a corporate strategy of relying on internally generated growth. For 
example, management at 3M (www.3m.com) strongly encourages entrepreneurial activity, often 
spinning off business units to nurture the best ideas and carry them to completion.

part 5 • InternatIonal BuSIneSS ManageMent
Other methods of growth include mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic 
alliances (see Chapter 13). Companies use these tactics when they do not wish to invest in devel-
oping certain skills internally or when other companies already do what managers are trying to 
achieve. Common partners in implementing these strategies include competitors, suppliers, and 
buyers. Corporations typically join forces with competitors to reduce competition, expand prod-
uct lines, or expand geographically. A common motivation for joining forces with suppliers is to 
increase control over the quality, cost, and timing of inputs.
rETrEnChMEnT sTrATEGy The exact opposite of a growth strategy is a retrenchment 
strategy—a strategy designed to reduce the scale or scope of a corporation’s businesses. 
Corporations often cut back the scale of their operations when economic conditions worsen or 
competition increases. They may do so by closing factories with unused capacity and by laying 
off workers. Corporations can also reduce the scale of their operations by laying off managers 
and salespeople in national markets that are not generating adequate sales revenue. Corporations 
reduce the scope of their activities by selling unprofitable business units or those that are no 
longer directly related to their overall aims. Weaker competitors often resort to retrenchment 
when national business environments grow more competitive.
sTABiLiTy sTrATEGy A stability strategy is designed to guard against change. Corporations often 
use a stability strategy when trying to avoid either growth or retrenchment. Such corporations have 
typically met their stated objectives or are satisfied with what they have already accomplished. They 
believe that their strengths are being fully exploited and their weaknesses fully protected against. 
They also see the business environment as posing neither profitable opportunities nor threats. They 
have no interest in expanding sales, increasing profits, increasing market share, or expanding the 
customer base; at present, they want simply to maintain their current positions.
COMBinATiOn sTrATEGy The purpose of a combination strategy is to mix growth, 
retrenchment, and stability strategies across a corporation’s business units. For example, a 
corporation can invest in units that show promise, retrench in those for which less exposure is 
desired, and stabilize others. In fact, corporate combination strategies are quite common because 
international corporations rarely follow identical strategies in each of their business units.
Business-Level strategies
In addition to stipulating the overall corporate strategy, managers must also formulate separate 
business-level strategies for each business unit. For some companies, this means creating just 
one strategy. This is the case when the business-level strategy and the corporate-level strategy

are one and the same because the corporation is involved in just one line of business. For other 
companies, this can mean creating dozens of strategies.
The key to developing an effective business-level strategy is deciding on a general com-
petitive strategy in the marketplace. Each business unit must decide whether to sell the lowest-
priced product in an industry or to integrate special attributes into its products. A business unit 
can use one of three generic business-level strategies for competing in its industry—low-cost 
leadership, differentiation, or focus.4 These strategies are used by practically all firms in all mar-
kets worldwide. Let’s explore each of these strategies in detail.
LOw-COsT LEAdErshiP sTrATEGy A strategy in which a company exploits economies of 
scale to have the lowest cost structure of any competitor in its industry is called a low-cost 
leadership strategy. Companies that pursue the low-cost leadership position also try to contain 
administrative costs and the costs of their various primary activities, including marketing, 
advertising, and distribution. We saw in this chapter’s opening company profile how Ryanair 
engages in aggressive cost cutting in order to be Europe’s leading low-cost airline. Although 
cutting costs is the mantra for firms that pursue a low-cost leadership position, other important 
competitive factors such as product quality and customer service cannot be ignored. Factors 
underlying the low-cost leadership position (efficient production in large quantities) help guard 
against attack by competitors because of the large upfront cost of getting started. The strategy 
typically requires a company to have a large market share because achieving low-cost leadership 
tends to rely on large-scale production to contain costs. One negative aspect of the low-cost 
leadership strategy is low customer loyalty—all else being equal, buyers will purchase from any 
low-cost leader.
A low-cost leadership strategy works best with mass-marketed products aimed at price-
sensitive buyers. This strategy is often well suited to companies with standardized products and 
marketing promotions. Two global companies vying for the low-cost leadership position in their 
respective industries include Casio (www.casio.com) in sports watches and Texas Instruments 
(www.ti.com) in calculators and other electronic devices.
diffErEnTiATiOn sTrATEGy A differentiation strategy is one in which a company designs 
its products to be perceived as unique by buyers throughout its industry. The perception of 
uniqueness can allow a company to charge a higher price and enjoy greater customer loyalty 
than it could as a low-cost leader. But a perception of exclusivity, or meeting the needs of a small 
group of buyers, tends to force a company into a lower market-share position. A company using

By analyzing its industry and 
assets, a company based 
in an emerging market can 
determine if its competitive 
edge is germane to the local 
market, or if it is transferable 
to other markets. Chinese

efficiency.

this strategy must develop a loyal customer base to offset its smaller market share and higher 
costs of producing and marketing a unique product.
One way products can be differentiated is by improving their reputation for quality. 
Ceramic tableware for everyday use is found at department stores in almost every country. But 
Japanese producer Noritake differentiates the ceramic tableware it makes (www.noritake.com) 
from common tableware by emphasizing its superior quality. The perception of higher quality 
allows manufacturers to charge higher prices for their products worldwide.
Other products are differentiated by distinctive brand images. Armani (www.armani.com) 
and DKNY (www.dkny.com), for example, are relatively pricey global clothiers appealing to a 
young, fashionable clientele. Each is continually introducing new textures and colors that are at 
once stylish and functional. Another example is Italian carmaker Alfa Romeo (www.alfaromeo.
com), which does not compete in the fiercely competitive mass-consumer segment of the global 
automobile industry. If it were to do so, it would have to be price-competitive and offer a wider 
selection of cars. Instead, Alfa Romeo offers a high-quality product with a brand image that 
rewards the Alfa Romeo owner with status and prestige.
Another differentiating factor is product design—the sum of the features by which a prod-
uct looks and functions according to customer requirements. Special features differentiate both 
goods and services in the minds of consumers who value those features. Manufacturers can also 
combine several differentiation factors in formulating their strategies. For example, the designs 
of Casio (www.casio.com) and other makers of mass-market sports watches stress functionality. 
The sports watches of TAG Heuer (www.tagheuer.com) of Switzerland, on the other hand, offer 
class and style in addition to performance.
fOCUs sTrATEGy A focus strategy is one in which a company focuses on serving the needs 
of a narrowly defined market segment by being the low-cost leader, by differentiating its 
product, or both. Increasing competition often means more products distinguished by price 
or differentiated by quality, design, and so forth. In turn, a greater product range leads to the 
continuous refinement of market segments. Today, many industries consist of large numbers of 
market segments and even smaller subsegments. For example, some firms try to serve the needs 
of one ethnic or racial group, whereas others, often entrepreneurs and small businesses, focus on 
a single geographic area.
Johnson & Johnson (J&J; www.jnj.com) is commonly thought of as being a single, large 
consumer-products company. In fact, it is a conglomerate of more than 250 operating companies 
that market an enormous variety of products to a wide array of market segments. Many indi-
vidual J&J companies try to dominate their segments by producing specialty goods and services. 
In so doing, they focus on narrow segments by using either low-cost leadership or differentiation 
techniques.5
A focus strategy often means designing products and promotions aimed at consumers who 
are either dissatisfied with existing choices or who want something distinctive. Consider the 
highly fragmented gourmet coffee market. One extremely unusual brand of coffee called Luwak 
sells for up to $300 per pound! Apparently, luwaks (weasels on the Indonesian island of Java) 
eat coffee berries containing coffee beans. The beans “naturally ferment” as they pass through 
the luwaks and are later recovered. The beans are then washed, roasted, and sold around the 
world as a specialty coffee.6

department-Level strategies
Achieving corporate- and business-level objectives depends on effective departmental strate-
gies that focus on the specific activities that transform resources into products. Formulation 
of department-level strategies brings us back to where we began our analysis of a company’s 

 
Chapter 11 • InternatIonal Strategy and organIzatIon   313
capabilities that support its strategy: to the primary and support activities that create value for 
customers. After managers analyze these activities, they must develop strategies that exploit 
their firm’s value-creating strengths.
PriMAry And sUPPOrT ACTiViTiEs Each department is instrumental in creating customer 
value through lower costs or differentiated products. This is especially true of departments 
that conduct primary activities. Manufacturing strategies are obviously important in cutting 
the production costs of both standardized and differentiated products. They are also crucial 
to improving product quality. Effective marketing strategies allow companies to promote the 
differences in their products. A strong sales force and good customer service contribute to 
favorable images among consumers or industrial buyers and generate loyal customers of both 
kinds. Efficient logistics in bringing raw materials and components into the factory and getting 
the finished product out the factory door can result in substantial cost savings.
Support activities also create customer value. For example, R&D identifies market seg-
ments with unsatisfied needs and designs products to meet them. Human resource managers can 
improve efficiency and cut costs by hiring well-trained employees and conducting worker train-
ing and management development programs. Procurement tasks provide operations with quality 
resources at a reasonable cost. Accounting and finance (elements of a firm’s infrastructure) must 
develop efficient information systems to assist managers in making decisions and maintaining 
financial control, thus having an impact on costs and quality in general.
There are important elements that drive the decisions of world-class companies with regard 
to strategy formulation. For example, the important production issues to consider are the number 
and dispersion of production facilities and whether to standardize production processes for all 
markets. The important marketing issue is whether to standardize either the physical features of 
products or their marketing strategies across markets. We present the strategic considerations of 
production and marketing activities in later chapters.

Issues of Organizational Structure
Organizational structure is the way in which a company divides its activities among separate 
units and coordinates activities among those units. If a company’s organizational structure is ap-
propriate for its strategic plans, it will be more effective in working toward its goals. In this sec-
tion, we explore several important issues related to organizational structures and will examine 
several alternative forms of organization.
Centralization versus decentralization
A vital issue for top managers is determining the degree to which decision making in the orga-
nization will be centralized or decentralized. Centralized decision making concentrates decision 
making at a high organizational level in one location, such as at headquarters. Decentralized 
decision making disperses decisions to lower organizational levels, such as to international 
subsidiaries.
Should managers at the parent company be actively involved in the decisions made by 
international subsidiaries? Or should managers intervene relatively little, perhaps, and only get 
involved in the most crucial decisions? Some decisions, of course, must be decentralized. If top 
managers involve themselves in the day-to-day decisions of every subsidiary, they are likely to 
be overwhelmed. For example, managers cannot get directly involved in every hiring decision 
or assignment of people to specific tasks at each facility. On the other hand, overall corporate 
strategy cannot be delegated to subsidiary managers because only top management is likely to 
have the appropriate perspective needed to formulate corporate strategy.

part 5 • InternatIonal BuSIneSS ManageMent
In our discussion of centralization versus decentralization of decision making, it is impor-
tant to remember two points:
 1. Companies rarely centralize or decentralize all decision making. Rather, they seek an ap-
proach that will result in the greatest efficiency and effectiveness.
 2. International companies may centralize decision making in certain geographic markets 
while decentralizing it in others. Numerous factors influence this decision, including the 
need for product modification and the abilities of managers at each location.
With these points in mind, let’s take a look at some specific factors that determine whether 
centralized or decentralized decision making is most appropriate.
whEn TO CEnTrALizE Centralized decision making helps coordinate the operations of 
international subsidiaries. This is important for companies that operate in multiple lines of 
business or in many international markets. It is also important when one subsidiary’s output is 
another’s input. In such situations, coordinating operations from a single, high-level vantage 
point is more efficient. Purchasing is often centralized if all subsidiaries use the same inputs in 
production. For example, a company that manufactures steel filing cabinets and desks will need a 
great deal of sheet steel. A central purchasing department will get a better bulk price on sheet steel 
than would subsidiaries negotiating their own agreements. Each subsidiary would then benefit by 
purchasing sheet steel from the company’s central purchasing department at a lower cost than it 
would pay in the open market.
Some companies maintain strong central control over financial resources by channel-
ing all subsidiary profits back to the parent for redistribution to subsidiaries based on their 
needs. This practice reduces the likelihood that certain subsidiaries will undertake invest-
ment projects when more promising projects at other locations go without funding. Other 
companies centrally design policies, procedures, and standards to encourage a single global 
organizational culture. This policy makes it more likely that all subsidiaries will enforce 
company rules uniformly. The policy also helps when companies transfer managers from 
one location to another because uniform policies can smooth transitions for managers and 
subordinates alike.
whEn TO dECEnTrALizE Decentralized decision making is beneficial when fast-changing 
national business environments put a premium on local responsiveness. Decentralized decisions 
can result in products that are better suited to the needs and preferences of local buyers because 
subsidiary managers are in closer contact with the local business environment. Local managers 
are more likely to perceive environmental changes that managers at headquarters might not 
notice. By contrast, central managers may not perceive such changes or would likely get a 
secondhand account of local events. Delayed response and misinterpreted events could then 
result in lost orders, stalled production, and weakened competitiveness.
Participative Management and Accountability Decentralization can also help foster 
participative management practices. The morale of employees is likely to be higher if subsidiary 
managers and subordinates are involved in decision making. Subsidiary managers and workers 
can grow more dedicated to the organization when they are involved in decisions related to 
production, promotion, distribution, and pricing strategies.
Decentralization also can increase personal accountability for business decisions. When 
local managers are rewarded (or punished) for their decisions, they are likely to invest more 
effort in making and executing them. Conversely, if local managers must do nothing but imple-
ment policies dictated from above, they can attribute poor performance to decisions that were 
ill-suited to the local environment. When managers are held accountable for decision making 
and implementation, they typically delve more deeply into research and consider all available 
options. The results are often better decisions and improved performance.
Coordination and flexibility
When designing the organizational structure, managers seek answers to certain key questions: 
What is the most efficient method of linking divisions to each other? Who should coordinate the 
activities of different divisions in order to achieve overall strategies? How should information be 
processed and delivered to managers when it is required? What sorts of monitoring mechanisms 

 
Chapter 11 • InternatIonal Strategy and organIzatIon   315
and reward structures should be established? How should the company introduce corrective 
measures, and whose responsibility should it be to execute them? To answer these types of ques-
tions, we must look at the issues of coordination and flexibility.
sTrUCTUrE And COOrdinATiOn As we have seen, some companies have a presence in 
several or more national business environments while some firms manufacture and market 
products practically everywhere. Others operate primarily in one country and export to, or 
import from, other markets. Each type of company must design an appropriate organizational 
structure. Each needs a structure that clearly defines areas of responsibility and chains of 
command—the lines of authority that run from top management to individual employees and 
that specify internal reporting relationships. Finally, every firm needs a structure that brings 
together areas that require close cooperation. For example, to avoid product designs that make 
manufacturing more difficult and costly than necessary, most firms ensure that R&D and 
manufacturing remain in close contact.
sTrUCTUrE And fLExiBiLiTy Organizational structure is not permanent but is often modified to 
suit changes both within a company and in its external environment. Because companies usually 
base organizational structures on strategies, changes in strategy usually require adjustments in 
structure. Similarly, because changes in national business environments can force changes in 
strategy, they too will influence company structure. It is especially important to monitor closely 
the conditions in countries characterized by rapidly shifting cultural, political, and economic 
environments. Let’s now explore four organizational structures that have been developed to 
improve the responsiveness and effectiveness of companies conducting international business 
activities.

 3. What is a benefit of decentralized decision making in an organization?
Types Of Organizational Structure
There are many different ways in which a company can organize itself to carry out its international 
business activities. But four organizational structures tend to be most common for the vast majority 
of international companies: division structure, area structure, product structure, and matrix structure.
international division structure
An international division structure separates domestic from international business activities 
by creating a separate international division with its own manager (see Figure 11.4). In turn, 
the international division is typically divided into units corresponding to the countries in which 
a company is active—say, Brazil, China, and France. Within each country, a general manager 
controls the manufacture and marketing of the firm’s products. Each country unit typically car-
ries out all of its own activities with its own departments, such as marketing and sales, finance, 
and production.
Because the international division structure concentrates international expertise in one 
division, divisional managers become specialists in a wide variety of activities such as foreign 
exchange, export documentation, and host government relations. By consigning international 
activities to a single division, a firm can reduce costs, increase efficiency, and prevent interna-
tional activities from disrupting domestic operations. These are important criteria for firms new 
to international business and whose international operations account for a small percentage of 
their total business.
An international division structure can, however, create two problems for companies. First, 
international managers must often rely on home-country managers for the financial resources 
and technical know-how that give the company its international competitive edge. Poor coor-
dination between managers can hurt the performance not only of the international division but 
chains of command
Lines of authority that run from 
top management to individual 
employees and that specify

also of the entire company. Second, the general manager of the international division typically 
is responsible for operations in all countries. Although this policy facilitates coordination across 
countries, it reduces the authority of each country manager. Rivalries and poor cooperation 
between the general manager and country managers can be damaging to the company’s overall 
performance.
international Area structure
An international area structure organizes a company’s entire global operations into countries 
or geographic regions (see Figure 11.5). The greater the number of countries in which a com-
pany operates, the greater the likelihood it will organize into regions—say, Asia, Europe, and the 
Americas—instead of countries. Typically, a general manager is assigned to each country or re-
gion. Under this structure, each geographic division operates as a self-contained unit, with most 
decision making decentralized in the hands of the country or regional managers. Each unit has 
its own set of departments—purchasing, production, marketing and sales, R&D, and accounting. 
Each unit also tends to handle much of its own strategic planning. Management at the parent-
company headquarters makes decisions regarding overall corporate strategy and coordinates the 
activities of various units.
The international area structure is best suited to companies that treat each national or 
regional market as unique. It is particularly useful when there are vast cultural, political, or

economic differences between nations or regions. When they enjoy a great deal of control over 
activities in their own environments, general managers become experts on the unique needs of 
their buyers. On the other hand, because units act independently, allocated resources may over-
lap, and cross-fertilization of knowledge from one unit to another may be less than desirable.
Global Product structure
A global product structure divides worldwide operations according to a company’s product 
areas. Figure 11.6 shows how a simplistic and fictional transportation company might be divided 
into planes, trains, and automobiles divisions. A computer company might be separated into 
divisions of Internet and Communications, Software Development, and New Technologies, for 
example. Each product division is then divided into domestic and international units. Each func-
tion—R&D, marketing, and so forth—is thus duplicated in both the domestic and international 
units of each product division.
The global product structure is suitable for companies that offer diverse sets of products or 
services because it overcomes some coordination problems of the international division struc-
ture. Because the primary focus is on the product, activities must be coordinated among a prod-
uct division’s domestic and international managers so they do not conflict.
Global Matrix structure
A global matrix structure splits the chain of command between product and area divisions 
(see Figure 11.7). Each manager reports to two bosses: the president of the product division and 
the president of the geographic area. A main goal of the matrix structure is to bring together 
geographic area managers and product area managers in joint decision making. In fact, bringing 
together specialists from different parts of the organization creates a sort of team organization. 
The popularity of the matrix structure has grown among companies trying to increase local re-
sponsiveness, reduce costs, and coordinate worldwide operations.
The matrix structure resolves some of the shortcomings of other organizational structures, 
especially by improving communication among divisions and increasing the efficiency of highly 
specialized employees. At its best, the matrix structure can increase coordination while simulta-
neously improving agility and local responsiveness.
However, the global matrix structure suffers from two major shortcomings. First, the matrix 
form can be quite cumbersome. Numerous meetings are required simply to coordinate the 
actions of the various division heads, let alone the activities within divisions. In turn, the need 
for complex coordination tends to make decision making time consuming and slows the reaction 
time of the organization. Second, individual responsibility and accountability can become foggy 
in the matrix organization structure. Because responsibility is shared, managers can attribute 
poor performance to the actions of the other manager. Moreover, the source of problems in the 
matrix structure can be hard to detect and corrective action difficult to take.

There are other ways international companies can improve responsiveness and effectiveness. 
An increasingly popular method among international companies is the implementation of work 
teams to accomplish goals and solve problems. Let’s explore in detail the use of work teams.
work Teams
Globalization is forcing companies to respond more quickly to changes in the business envi-
ronment. The formation of teams can be highly useful in improving responsiveness by cutting 
across functional boundaries—such as that between production and marketing—that slow deci-
sion making in an organization. Although a matrix organization accomplishes this by establish-
ing cross-functional cooperation, companies do not always want to change their entire organiza-
tional structure in order to reap the benefits that cross-functional cooperation provides. In such 
cases, companies can implement several different types of teams without changing the overall 
company structure.
Work teams are assigned the tasks of coordinating their efforts to arrive at solutions 
and implementing corrective action. Today, international companies are turning to work 
teams on an unprecedented scale to increase direct contact between different operating units. 
Companies are even forming teams to design and implement their competitive strategies. Let’s 
take a look at several different types of teams—self-managed teams, cross-functional teams, 
and global teams.
sELf-MAnAGEd TEAMs A self-managed team is one in which the employees from a single 
department take on the responsibilities of their former supervisors. When used in production, 
such teams often reorganize the methods and flow of production processes. Because they 
are “self-managed,” they reduce the need for managers to watch over their every activity. 
The benefits of self-managed teams typically include increased productivity, product quality, 
customer satisfaction, employee morale, and company loyalty. In fact, the most common self-
managed teams in many manufacturing companies are quality-improvement teams, which help 
reduce waste in the production process and, therefore, lower costs.
The global trend toward “downsizing” internal operations to make them more flexible and 
productive has increased the popularity of teams because they reduce the need for direct super-
vision. Companies around the world now employ self-managed teams in international opera-
tions. Yet, research indicates that cultural differences can influence resistance to the concept

Chapter 11 • InternatIonal Strategy and organIzatIon   319
of self-management and the practice of using teams. Among other things, experts suggest that 
international managers follow some basic guidelines:7
• Use selection tests to identify the employees most likely to perform well in a team 
environment.
• Adapt the self-managed work-team concept to the national culture of each subsidiary.
• Adapt the process of integrating self-managed work teams to the national culture of each 
subsidiary.
• Train local managers at the parent company and allow them to introduce teams at a time 
they feel is most appropriate.
Similarly, the cultural differences discussed in Chapter 2 are important to managers who 
design teams in international operations. For example, certain cultures are more collectivist in 
nature. Some cultures harbor greater respect for differences in people’s status. In some cultures, 
people believe the future is largely beyond their personal control. And some cultures display a 
so-called work-to-live mentality. Researchers say that in these cases conventional management 
should retain fairly tight authority over teams. But teams are likely to be productive if given 
greater autonomy in a culture where people are very hardworking.8
CrOss-fUnCTiOnAL TEAMs A cross-functional team is one composed of employees who 
work at similar levels in different functional departments. These teams work to develop changes 
in operations and are well suited to projects that require coordination across functions, such as 
reducing the time needed to get a product from the idea stage to the marketplace. International 
companies also use cross-functional teams to improve quality by having employees from 
purchasing, manufacturing, and distribution (among other functions) work together to address 
specific quality issues. For the same reason, cross-functional teams can help break down barriers 
between departments and reorganize operations around processes rather than by functional 
departments.
GLOBAL TEAMs Finally, large international corporations are creating so-called global teams—
groups of top managers from both headquarters and international subsidiaries who meet to 
develop solutions to company-wide problems. For example, Nortel Networks (www.nortel.com) 
of Canada created a global team of top executives from Britain, Canada, France, and the United 
States that traveled to Asia, Europe, and North America looking for ways to improve product-
development practices.
Depending on the issue at hand, team members can be drawn from a single business unit or 
assembled from several different units. Whereas some teams are disbanded after resolving spe-
cific issues, others move on to new problems. The performance of global teams can be impaired 
by matters such as large distances between team members, lengthy travel times to meetings, and 
the inconvenience of working across time zones. Companies can sometimes overcome these dif-
ficulties, although doing so can be rather costly.

A Final Word
Managers have the important and complicated task of formulating international strategies at 
the corporation, business unit, and individual department levels. Managers often analyze their 
companies’ operations by viewing them as a chain of activities that create customer value

(value-chain analysis). It is through this process that managers can identify and implement 
strategies suited to their companies’ unique capabilities. The strategies that managers select then 
determine the firm’s organizational structure. National business environments also affect manag-
ers’ strategy and structure decisions, including whether to alter their products (standardization 
versus adaptation), where to locate facilities (centralized versus decentralized production), and 
what type of decision making to implement (centralized versus decentralized decision making).
The role of managers in formulating strategies and creating the overall organizational struc-
ture cannot be overstated. The strategies they choose determine the market segments in which 
their firms will compete and whether their firms will pursue low-cost leadership in their industry 
or will differentiate their products and charge a higher price. These decisions are crucial to all 
later activities of firms that are going international. They also influence how a company (1) enters 
international markets, (2) employs its human resources, and (3) manages its day-to-day produc-
tion, marketing, and other operations.

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Explain the company analysis techniques that precede strategy selection.
• Prior to strategy formulation managers must first undertake a careful analysis to iden-
tify a clear company mission and a well-defined set of objectives they want to achieve.
• Managers can identify company abilities that create customer value by using value-
chain analysis, which divides a company’s activities into primary activities and support 
activities that are central to creating value for customers.
• Managers must also analyze the cultural, political, legal, and economic environments 
for factors that can complicate strategy formulation.
 LO2. Describe the various strategies that companies use to reach their goals.
• A multinational strategy is best when adapting products and marketing strategies to 
national markets and a global strategy is best when offering the same products using 
the same marketing strategy in all markets.
• Corporate-level strategies include: (1) growth—increase scale or scope of opera-
tions; (2) retrenchment—reduce the scale or scope of businesses; (3) stability—guard 
against change; and (4) combination—mix growth, retrenchment, and stability 
 strategies across businesses.
• Business-level strategies include: (1) low-cost leadership—exploit economies of 
scale to have the lowest cost structure; (2) differentiation—design products perceived 
as unique in an industry; (3) focus—serve a narrow market segment through low-cost 
leadership, differentiation, or both.
• Achieving objectives depends on department-level strategies that focus on the spe-
cific primary or support activities that create customer value.
 LO3. Outline the key issues behind the selection of organizational structure.
• Organizational structure is the way in which a company divides its activities among 
separate units and coordinates activities among those units.
• Centralized decision making occurs at a high level and helps coordinate operations 
of international subsidiaries. Decentralized decision making occurs at the subsidiary 
level and places a premium on local responsiveness.
• When designing structure managers must consider the degree of coordination needed 
among various groups within the firm and how much flexibility is required of the 
company’s structure.
• Organizational structure must also define areas of responsibility and chains of 
 command—lines of authority that specify internal reporting relationships.
 LO4. Describe various international organizational structures and types of work teams.
• An international division structure creates a separate division with its own manager 
for international activities.

 
Chapter 11 • InternatIonal Strategy and organIzatIon   321
• An international area structure organizes a company’s global operations into coun-
tries or geographic regions, with each division operating as a self-contained unit.
• A global product structure divides worldwide operations into product divisions, 
which are then divided into domestic and international units.
• A global matrix structure requires reporting to two bosses: the general manager of 
the product division and the general manager of the geographic area.
• Work teams coordinate their efforts to arrive at solutions and implement corrective 
action. Types of work teams are self-managed teams, cross-functional teams, and 
global teams.

companies should standardize both their products and global marketing efforts.
 11-1. Do you agree or disagree with this line of reasoning? Explain.
 11-2. Are there certain industries for which the statement might be more or less true?
 Talk About It 2
List five products that you consumed (breakfast, chewing gum, etc.) or used (Wi-Fi Internet

 11-3. What strategy does the company behind each good or service employ: low-cost, 
 differentiation, or focus?
 11-4. For each company, explain what information helped you arrive at your answer.
Ethical Challenge You are the CEO of a multinational corporation that has grown organically over the past thirty 
years. You know that your organizational structure is long overdue for a major change. The 
coordination of activities between the various units is not as good as it could be. Some of the 
parts of the organization are already centralized, such as administration; other parts, such as 
production, sales and marketing, and distribution, are largely decentralized. You want to con-
sider the options carefully and make an assessment of their implications for the corporation.
 11-5. How might centralization help to fully coordinate the operations of the organization? 
Who is likely to be affected by centralization?
 11-6. Now consider the case for increased decentralization and where this option might, in fact, 
be beneficial to the organization. Will it mean more flexibility?

IKEA’s Global Strategy
I
KEA (www.ikea.com) is a nearly $30 billion global furniture 
powerhouse based in Sweden. With more than 345 stores in 42 
countries, the company’s success reflects founder Ingvar Kamprad’s 
“social ambition” of selling a wide range of stylish, functional home 
furnishings at prices so low that the majority of people can afford 
to buy them. The story of Kamprad’s success is detailed in a book 
titled IKEA: The Entrepreneur, the Business Concept, the Culture. 
The store exteriors are painted with Sweden’s national colors, bright 
blue and yellow. Shoppers view furniture in scores of realistic set-
tings arranged throughout the cavernous showrooms.
In a departure from standard industry practice, IKEA’s furniture 
bears names such as “Ivar” and “Sten” as well as model numbers. At 
IKEA, shopping is very much a self-service activity—after brows-
ing and writing down the names of desired items in the showroom, 
shoppers pick their furniture off shelves, where they find boxes con-
taining the furniture in kit form. One of the cornerstones of IKEA’s 
strategy is having customers take their purchases home and assem-
ble the furniture themselves. The typical IKEA store also contains a 
Swedish-cuisine restaurant, a grocery store called the Swede Shop, 
a supervised play area for children, and a baby-care room.
IKEA’s approach to the furniture business enables it to rack 
up impressive growth in an industry in which overall sales are flat. 
Sourcing furniture from more than 1,500 suppliers in 50 coun-
tries helps the company maintain its low-cost position. IKEA has 
also opened stores in emerging markets, such as in Central and 
Eastern Europe. Because many consumers in those regions have 
relatively low purchasing power, the stores offer a smaller selec-
tion of goods, and some of the furniture is designed specifically 
for the cramped living styles typical in former Soviet bloc coun-
tries. Throughout Europe, IKEA benefits from the perception that 
Sweden is the source of high-quality products. In fact, one of the 
company’s key selling points is its “Swedishness.” IKEA also op-
erates in emerging markets like Russia, where its core strategy and 
anticorruption policies have been effective.
Industry observers predict that the United States will eventu-
ally be IKEA’s largest market. The company opened its first U.S. 
store in Philadelphia in 1985 and today has dozens of outlets that 
generate billions of dollars in sales annually. IKEA’s competitors 
take the company very seriously and say any industry player that 
ignores the future Walmart of home furnishings (as IKEA is some-
times called), does so at its own peril.
Some U.S. customers, however, are irked to find popular items 
sometimes out of stock. Another problem is the long lines result-
ing from the company’s no-frills approach. Although all customers 
appreciate receiving quality products at a fair price, some of them 
question whether drawbacks of the IKEA concept are worth the 
savings.
Goran Carstedt, president of IKEA North America, responds 
to such criticism by referring to the company’s mission. He notes 
that IKEA’s ability to keep prices low rests on the strategy of pro-
viding limited services. Customers return to IKEA despite having 
to make some small sacrifices because they value the company’s 
low prices, he says. To keep them coming back, IKEA is spending 
millions on advertising to get its message across. Whereas com-
mon industry practice is to rely heavily on newspaper and radio 
advertising, two-thirds of IKEA’s North American advertising 
budget is allocated for TV.
Incredibly, IKEA has also expanded into apartment building. 
The retail giant has more than 3,500 of its prefab homes through-
out Sweden, Norway, Finland, and the United Kingdom. IKEA’s 
BoKlok (meaning “smart living” in Swedish) apartments resemble 
IKEA’s modern furniture. The apartments are designed with open-
plan living spaces with high ceilings, windows on three sides, and, 
of course, pre-fitted IKEA kitchens.
Thinking Globally
 11-9. When company founder Kamprad decided to expand into 
China, he based his decision on his own intuition, not on 
market research. Looking at IKEA’s current performance 
in China, did Kamprad’s decision pay off?
 11-10. Relying on topics covered in this chapter, would you clas-
sify IKEA’s approach as one of standardization or adapta-
tion in markets around the world? Explain.

Rovio Soars Globally
ESPOO, Finland—Rovio (www.rovio.com) is the company behind the Angry Birds 
phenomena. The company began in 2003 as a developer for mobile games and has since 
expanded into an entertainment media company. Angry Birds was launched in 2009, but 
did not catch on with the global audience until 2010. Since then, 
the Angry Birds games have been downloaded over 1 billion 
times, and new synergies are being created continuously to keep 
the franchise moving forward.
Rovio’s strategy on how to go global focused on becoming 
successful in its home market of Finland and then expanding 
into similar smaller markets. The game caught on in Sweden 
and Denmark and then in the Czech Republic and Greece. This 
opened the door for entry into the lucrative English-speaking 
markets.
After gaining success in Europe, Angry Birds was featured as 
a “game of the week” by Apple in its UK App Store. Three days 
after the game being featured, Rovio released a free version of 
Angry Birds with a limited number of levels, which helped the 
game soar from 600th in popularity to first.
The global appeal of the game is its simplicity. The game 
is multilayered, which means the game has built-in difficulties 
that cater to different types of gamers, from the casual player 
who wants to complete a level and move on to the more hardcore 
player who wants to find the perfect shot to obtain the maximum 
number of points. To keep people playing, Rovio offers free up-
dates. This creates a lasting relationship with its customers.
The Angry Birds franchise continues to grow, with toys, 
clothing, and theme parks, as well as new collaborations, such 
as Angry Birds Star Wars. As you explore this chapter, consider 
the different ways a firm may analyze the market based on its 
industry.1

part 5 • international Business ManageMent
Traditionally, companies have gotten involved in international business by entering familiar, 
nearby countries first. Managers often feel rather comfortable entering nearby markets because 
of their proximity and they likely have interacted with people from those cultures in the past. For 
example, companies in Canada, Mexico, and the United States often go international by entering 
one another’s markets. Likewise, businesses in Asia often do business in one another’s markets 
before pursuing investment opportunities outside the region.
Today, companies often formulate production, marketing, and other strategies as com-
ponents of integrated plans. For example, to provide a continuous flow of timely information 
into the production process, many firms locate research and development (R&D) facilities near 
production sites abroad. Managers also find themselves analyzing locations as potential markets 
and as potential sites for operations simultaneously. When Mercedes (www.mercedes.com) in-
troduced the M-class sport utility vehicle to the U.S. market, it not only estimated the size of the 
potential market for the vehicle, but it simultaneously selected a suitable production site.
Increasing global competition means that companies must undertake high-quality research 
and analysis before selecting new markets and sites. Thus, companies are gaining a better un-
derstanding of both buyer behavior and business environments abroad. Market research is the 
 collection and analysis of information used to assist managers in making informed decisions. 
This definition applies to the assessment of potential markets and sites for operations.
Market research data on new markets helps managers design all aspects of marketing strat-
egy and understand buyer preferences and attitudes. What works in France, for example, might 
not work in Singapore. Market research also gives a snapshot of local business conditions, such 
as employment levels, wage rates, and the state of the local infrastructure. It supplies managers 
with timely and relevant information so that they can anticipate market shifts, changes in regula-
tions, and potential new competitors.
This chapter presents a systematic screening process for both markets and sites. We first 
describe important cultural, political, legal, and economic forces affecting the screening process. 
Next, we explore the specific types of information and analyses that help companies to make 
informed decisions regarding markets to enter and sites to select. We then explore the main 
sources of secondary market data and the most common methods for conducting primary market 
research firsthand.
Basic Appeal and National Factors
Two important issues concern managers during the market- and site-screening process. First, 
they want to keep search costs as low as possible. Second, they want to examine every potential 
market and every possible location. To accomplish these two goals, managers can segment the 
screening of markets and sites into the following four-step process (see Figure 12.1):
 1. Identify basic appeal.
 2. Assess the national business environment.
 3. Measure market or site potential.
 4. Select the market or site.
This screening process involves spending more time, money, and effort on the markets and 
sites that remain in the later stages of screening. Expensive feasibility studies (conducted later 
in the process) are performed on a few markets and sites that hold the greatest promise. This 
approach creates a screening process that is cost effective yet does not overlook potential loca-
tions. This section covers the first two steps in the process and the next section presents the last 
two steps in the process.
Step 1: Identify Basic Appeal
We have already seen that companies go international either to increase sales (and thus profits) 
or to access resources. The first step in identifying potential markets is to assess the basic de-
mand for a product. Similarly, the first step in selecting a site for a facility to undertake produc-
tion, R&D, or some other activity is to explore the availability of the resources required.
DeTermInIng BASIC DemAnD The first step in searching for potential markets means finding 
out whether there is a basic demand for a company’s product. Important in determining this 
market research
Collection and analysis of 
information used to assist 
managers in making informed 
decisions.

 
Chapter 12 • analyzing international opportunities  327
basic appeal is a country’s climate. For example, no company would try to market snowboards in 
Indonesia, Sri Lanka, or Central America because they receive no snowfall. The same product, 
on the other hand, is well suited for markets in the Canadian Rockies, northern Japan, and the 
Swiss Alps. Although this stage seems simple, it cannot be taken too lightly. A classic example 
is when, during its initial forays into international business, Walmart (www.walmart.com) found 
ice-fishing huts in its Puerto Rico inventory and no snowshoes at its stores in Ontario, Canada.
Certain countries also ban specific goods. Islamic countries, for instance, forbid the impor-
tation of alcoholic products, and the penalties for smuggling are stiff. Although alcohol is avail-
able on the planes of international airlines such as British Airways (www.ba.com) and KLM 
(www.klm.com), it cannot leave the airplane, and consumption cannot take place until the plane 
has left the airspace of the country operating under Islamic law.
DeTermInIng AvAILABILITy Of reSOurCeS Companies that require particular resources 
to carry out local business activities must be sure they are available. Raw materials needed for 
manufacturing either must be found in the national market or must be imported. Yet imports may 
encounter tariffs, quotas, or other government barriers. Managers must consider the additional 
costs of importing to ensure that total product cost does not rise to unacceptable levels.
The availability of labor is essential to production in any country. Many companies choose 
to relocate to countries where workers’ wages are lower than they are in the home country. This 
practice is most common among makers of labor-intensive products—those for which labor 
accounts for a large portion of total cost. Companies considering local production must deter-
mine whether there is enough labor available locally for production operations.
Companies that hope to secure financing in a market abroad must determine the availabil-
ity and cost of local capital. If local interest rates are too high, a company might be forced to 
obtain financing in its home country or in other markets in which it is active. On the other hand, 
access to low-cost financing may provide a powerful inducement to a company that is seeking 
to expand internationally. British entrepreneur Richard Branson opened several of his Virgin 
(www.virgin.com) Megastores in Japan despite its reputation as a tough market to crack. One 
reason for Branson’s initial attraction to Japan was a local cost of capital that was roughly one-
third the cost in Britain.

Markets and sites that fail to meet a company’s requirements for basic demand or resource 
availability in Step 1 are removed from further consideration.
Step 2: Assess the national Business environment
If the business environments of all countries were the same, deciding where to market or pro-
duce products would be rather straightforward. Managers could rely on data that report the 
performance of the local economy and analyze expected profits from proposed investments. But 
as we saw in earlier chapters, countries differ significantly in their cultures, politics, laws, and 
economies. International managers must work to understand these differences and to incorpo-
rate their understanding into market- and site-selection decisions. Let’s examine how domestic 
forces in the business environment actually affect the location-selection process.
CuLTurAL fOrCeS Although countries display cultural similarities, they differ in language, 
attitudes toward business, religious beliefs, traditions, customs, and countless other ways. Some 
products are sold in global markets with little or no modification. These products include industrial 
machinery such as packaging equipment, consumer products such as toothpaste and soft drinks, 
and many other types of goods and services. Yet many products must undergo extensive adaptation 
to suit local preferences, such as books, magazines, ready-to-eat meals, and others.
Cultural elements can influence what kinds of products are sold and how they are sold. 
A company must assess how the local culture in a candidate market might affect the salability of 
its product. Consider Coca-Cola’s (www.coca-cola.com) experience in China. Many Chinese take 
a traditional medicine to fight off flu and cold symptoms. As it turns out, the taste of this tradi-
tional medicine—which most people do not find appealing—is similar to that of Coke. Because 
of Coca-Cola’s global marketing policy of one taste worldwide, the company had to overcome 
the aversion to the taste of Coke among Chinese consumers. It did so by creating a marketing 
campaign that associated drinking a Coke with experiencing a piece of American culture. What 
initially looked like an unattractive market for Coke became very successful through a carefully 
tailored marketing campaign.
Cultural elements in the business environment can also affect site-selection decisions. When 
substantial product modifications are needed for cultural reasons, a company might choose to estab-
lish production facilities in the target market itself. Yet serving customers’ special needs in a target 
market must be offset against any potential loss of economies of scale due to producing in several 
locations rather than just one. Today, companies can minimize such losses through the use of flex-
ible manufacturing methods. For example, a smartphone manufacturer that produces in multiple 
locations worldwide could ensure that each of its facilities could start producing any one of its 
phones for its different markets within 24 hours.
A qualified workforce is important to a company no matter what activity it is to undertake 
at a particular site. Also, a strong work ethic among the local workforce is essential to having 
productive operations. Managers must assess whether an appropriate work ethic exists in each 
potential country for the purposes of production, service, or any other business activity. An ade-
quate level of educational attainment among the local workforce for the planned business activ-
ity is also very important. Although product-assembly operations may not require an advanced 
education, R&D, high-tech production, and certain services normally will require extensive 
higher education. If the people at a potential site do not display an appropriate work ethic or 
educational attainment, the site will be ruled out for further consideration.
POLITICAL AnD LegAL fOrCeS Political and legal forces also influence the market and site-
location decision. Important factors include government regulation, government bureaucracy, 
and political stability. Let’s take a brief look at each of these factors.
government regulation As we saw in earlier chapters, a nation’s culture, history, and current 
events cause differing attitudes toward trade and investment. Some governments take a strong 
nationalistic stance, whereas others are quite receptive to international trade and investment. 
A government’s attitude toward trade and investment is reflected in the quantity and types of 
restrictions it places on imports, exports, and investment in its country.
Government regulations can quickly eliminate a market or site from further consid-
eration. First of all, they can create investment barriers to ensure domestic control of a 
company or industry. One way in which a government can accomplish this is by imposing 

 
Chapter 12 • analyzing international opportunities  329
investment rules on matters such as business ownership—for example, forcing foreign com-
panies into joint ventures. Governments can extend investment rules to bar international 
companies entirely from competing in certain sectors of the domestic economy. The practice 
is usually defended as a matter of national security. Economic sectors commonly declared 
off-limits include TV and radio broadcasting, automobile manufacturing, aircraft manufac-
turing, energy exploration, military-equipment manufacturing, and iron and steel production. 
Such industries are protected either because they are culturally important, are engines for 
economic growth, or are essential to any potential war effort. Host governments often fear 
that losing control in these economic sectors means placing their fate in the hands of interna-
tional companies.
Second, governments can restrict international companies from freely removing profits 
earned in the nation. This policy can force a company to hold cash in the host country or to rein-
vest it in new projects there. Such policies are normally rooted in the inability of the host-country 
government to earn the foreign exchange needed to pay for badly needed imports. For instance, 
Chinese subsidiaries of multinational companies must convert the local currency (renminbi) to 
their home currency when remitting profits back to the parent company. Multinationals can sat-
isfy this stipulation only as long as the Chinese government agrees to provide it with the needed 
home-country currency.
Third, governments can impose very strict environmental regulations. In most industrial 
countries, factories that produce industrial chemicals as their main output or as byproducts must 
adhere to strict pollution standards. Regulations typically demand the installation of expensive 
pollution-control devices and close monitoring of nearby air, water, and soil quality. While 
protecting the environment, such regulations also increase short-term production costs. Many 
developing and emerging markets have far less strict environmental regulations. Regrettably, 
some companies are alleged to have moved production of toxic materials to emerging markets 
in order to take advantage of lax environmental regulations and, in turn, of lower production 
costs. Although such behavior is roundly criticized as highly unethical, it will occur less often as 
nations continue cooperating to formulate common environmental protection policies.
Finally, governments can also require that companies divulge certain information. Coca-
Cola actually left India when the government demanded that it disclose its secret Coke formula 
as a requirement for doing business there. Coca-Cola returned only after the Indian government 
dropped its demand.
government Bureaucracy A lean and smoothly operating government bureaucracy can make a 
market or site more attractive. On the other hand, a bloated and cumbersome system of obtaining 
approvals and licenses from government agencies can make it less appealing. In many developing 
countries, what should be a relatively simple matter of obtaining a license to establish a retail 
outlet often means acquiring numerous documents from several agencies. The bureaucrats in 
charge of these agencies generally are little concerned with providing businesses with high-
quality service. Managers must be prepared to deal with administrative delays and a maze of 
rules. For example, country managers for Millicom International Cellular (www.millicom.com) 
in Tanzania needed to wait 90 days to get customs clearance on the monthly import of roughly 
$1 million in cellular telephone equipment. Millicom endured this bureaucratic obstacle because 
of the local market’s potential.
Companies will endure a cumbersome bureaucracy if the opportunity is sufficient to off-
set any potential delays and expenses. Companies entering China cite the patience needed to 
navigate a maze of government regulations that often contradict one another, and they complain 
about the large number of permissions required from different agencies. The trouble stems 
from the fact that China is continually revising and developing its system of business law as its 
economy develops. But an unclear legal framework and inefficient bureaucracy are not deterring 
investment in China because the opportunities for both marketers and manufacturers are simply 
too great to ignore.
Political Stability Every nation’s business environment is affected to some degree by political 
risk. As we saw in Chapter 4, political risk is the likelihood that a society will undergo political 
changes that negatively affect local business activity. Political risk can threaten the market of 
an exporter, the production facilities of a manufacturer, or the ability of a company to remove 
profits from the country in which they were earned.

330  
part 5 • international Business ManageMent
The key element of political risk that concerns companies is unforeseen political change. 
Political risk tends to rise if a company cannot estimate the future political environment with a 
fair degree of accuracy. An event with a negative impact that is expected to occur in the future is 
not, in itself, bad for companies because the event can be planned for and necessary precautions 
taken. It is the unforeseen negative events that create political risk for companies.
Managers’ perceptions of a market’s political risk are often affected by their memories 
of past political unrest in the market. Yet managers cannot let past events blind them to future 
opportunities. International companies must try to monitor and predict political events that 
threaten operations and future profits. By investigating the political environment proactively, 
managers can focus on political risk and develop action plans for dealing with it.
But where do managers get the information to answer such questions? They may assign 
company personnel to gather information on the level of political risk in a country, or they may 
obtain it from independent agencies that specialize in providing political-risk services. The 
advice of country and regional specialists who are knowledgeable about the current political 
climate of a market can be especially helpful. Such specialists can include international bankers, 
political consultants, reporters, country-risk specialists, international relations scholars, political 
leaders, union leaders, embassy officials, and other local businesspeople currently working and 
living in the country in question.
eCOnOmIC AnD fInAnCIAL fOrCeS Managers must carefully analyze a nation’s economic 
policies before selecting it as a new market or site for operations. The poor fiscal and monetary 
policies of a nation’s central bank can cause high rates of inflation, increasing budget deficits, a 
depreciating currency, falling productivity levels, and flagging innovation. Such consequences 
typically lower investor confidence and force international companies to scale back or cancel 
proposed investments. For instance, India’s government finally reduced its restrictive trade 
and investment policies and introduced more-open policies. These new policies encouraged 
investment by multinationals in production facilities and R&D centers, especially in the 
computer software industry.
Currency and liquidity problems pose special challenges for international companies. 
Volatile currency values make it difficult for firms to predict future earnings accurately in terms 
of the home-country currency. Wildly fluctuating currency values also make it difficult to calcu-
late how much capital a company needs for a planned investment. Unpredictable changes in cur-
rency values can also make liquidating assets more difficult because the greater uncertainty will 
likely reduce liquidity in capital markets—especially in countries with relatively small capital 
markets, such as Bangladesh and Slovakia.

Chapter 12 • analyzing international opportunities  331
In addition to their home government’s resources, managers can obtain information about 
economic and financial conditions from institutions such as the World Bank, the International 
Monetary Fund, and the Asian Development Bank. Other sources of information include all 
types of business and economic publications and the many sources of free information on the 
Internet.
OTher fOrCeS Transport costs and country image also play important roles in the assessment 
of national business environments. Let’s take a brief look at each of these forces.
Cost of Transporting materials and goods The cost of transporting materials and finished 
goods affects any decision about where to locate manufacturing facilities. Some products cost 
very little to transport through the production and distribution process, whereas others cost a 
great deal. Logistics refers to management of the physical flow of products from the point of 
origin as raw materials to end users as finished products. Logistics weds production activities 
to the activities needed to deliver products to buyers. It includes all modes of transportation, 
storage, and distribution.
To realize the importance of efficient logistics, consider that global logistics is a $400 
billion industry. We often think of the United States as an efficient logistics market because 
of its extensive interstate road system and rail lines that stretch from east to west. But 
because of overcrowded highways, 2 billion people-hours are lost to gridlock each year. That 
translates into $48 billion in lost productivity. Transport companies and cargo ports strenu-
ously advertise their services precisely because of the high cost to businesses of inefficient 
logistics.
Country Image Because country image embodies every facet of a nation’s business 
environment, it is highly relevant to the selection of sites for production, R&D, or any other 
activity. For example, country image affects the location of manufacturing or assembly 
operations because products must typically be stamped with labels identifying where they were 
made or assembled—such as “Made in China” or “Assembled in Brazil.” Although such labels 
do not affect all products to the same degree, they can present important positive or negative 
images and boost or dampen sales.
Products made in relatively developed countries tend to be evaluated more positively than 
products from less-developed countries.2 This relation is due to the perception among consum-
ers that the workforces of certain nations have superior skills in making particular products. 
For example, consumer product giants Procter & Gamble (www.pg.com) and Unilever (www.
unilever.com) have manufacturing facilities in Vietnam. But Vietnamese consumers tend to shun 
these companies’ locally made Close-Up toothpaste and Tide detergent, instead seeking out iden-
tical products and brands produced in neighboring countries, such as Thailand. One Vietnamese 
shopper said that Tide from Thailand simply smells better to her. A general perception among 
Vietnamese consumers is that goods from Japan or Singapore are the best, followed by Thai 
goods. Unfortunately for Procter & Gamble and Unilever in Vietnam, many goods from other 
countries are smuggled in and sold on the black market, thereby denying the companies local 
sales revenue.
A country’s image can be positive in one product class but negative in another. For example, 
the fact that Volkswagen’s (www.volkswagen.com) new Beetle is made in Mexico for the U.S. 
market has not hurt the Beetle’s sales. But would affluent consumers buy a hand-built Rolls-
Royce (www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com) automobile if it were produced in Bolivia? Because 
Rolls-Royce buyers pay for the image of a brilliantly crafted luxury car, the Rolls-Royce image 
probably would not survive intact if the company were to produce its cars in Bolivia.
Finally, note that country image can and does change over time. For example, “Made in 
India” has traditionally been associated with low-technology products such as soccer balls and 
many types of textile products. But today, world-class computer software companies increas-
ingly rely on the software-development skills of engineers located in and around Madras and 
Bangalore in southern India.
Throughout our discussion of Step 2 of the screening process (assessing the national busi-
ness environment), we have presented many factors central to traditional business activities. To 
explore issues specific to entering international markets successfully over the Internet, see the 
Manager’s Briefcase, titled “Conducting Global e-Business.”

environment, potential customers might not be ready or able to buy a product for a variety of 
reasons. Despite the availability of resources, certain sites may be unable to supply a given

Generating sales in new geographic markets over the Internet is an 
increasingly popular method of expansion for large multinationals 
and entrepreneurs alike. Here are some issues managers should 
consider when entering new markets using the Internet.
market Access
• Infrastructure Before investing heavily in e-business, inves-
tigate whether your potential customers have easy access to 
the Internet. Determine whether their government is devel-
oping advanced digital networks.
• Content Companies must be informed about the different pol-
icies of each country through which their information travels in 
order to avoid liability. Key topics are truth in advertising, fraud 
prevention, and violent, seditious, or graphic materials.
• Standards It is not always entirely clear which country has 
the power to establish standards of operations for e-business. 
Standards might be set up as trade barriers to keep interna-
tional companies out of a domestic market.
Legal Issues
• Privacy One strength of e-business is that consumer data can 
be collected easily and used to generate sales. But consumer 
groups in some countries view the collection of such data as 
an invasion of privacy. Consumers are particularly vehement if 
they are unaware that this information is being collected and 
of how it is being used.
• Security Companies must ensure their data communications 
are safe from unauthorized access or modification. Security 
technology, such as encryption, password controls, and fire-
walls, still needs support from a global infrastructure.
• Intellectual Property International agreements govern and 
protect copyrights, databases, patents, and trademarks. Yet 
these issues will remain a global concern for e-business un-
til a widely accepted legal framework is established for the 
Internet.
financial matters
• Electronic Payments Online use of credit cards remains a 
security concern for many consumers. Global electronic pay-
ment systems such as stored-value, smart cards, and other 
systems are in various stages of development and will allevi-
ate many security issues.
• Tariffs and Taxation International policies regarding which 
party in an international e-business transaction owes taxes 
to which nation are not yet fully developed. Countries differ 
widely on how these matters should be treated.

company with the level of resources it needs. It is, therefore, crucial that management arrive at 
numerical estimates for each key success factor that contributes to a location’s potential market 
size or its suitability as a site for operations.
meASurIng mArkeT POTenTIAL As barriers to trade are reduced worldwide, companies 
are looking to increase sales in industrialized and emerging markets alike. But businesses can 
seldom create one marketing plan that will cover every market in which they sell their products. 
Nations enjoy different levels of economic development that affect what kinds of goods are 
sold, the manner in which they are sold, and their inherent features. Likewise, different levels of 
economic development require varying approaches to researching market potential. But how do 
managers estimate potential demand for particular products? Let’s look at the factors managers 
consider when analyzing industrialized markets and then examine a special tool for analyzing 
emerging markets.
Industrialized markets The information needed to estimate the market potential for a product 
in industrialized nations tends to be more readily available than for emerging markets. In fact, 
for the most-developed markets, research agencies exist for the sole purpose of supplying 
market data to companies. Euromonitor (www.euromonitor.com) is one such company with 
an extensive global reach in consumer goods. The company sells reports and does company-
specific studies for many international corporations and entrepreneurs. Some of the information 
in a typical industry analysis includes the following:
• Names, production volumes, and market shares of the largest competitors
• Volume of exports and imports of the product
• Structure of the wholesale and retail distribution networks
• Background on the market, including population figures and key social trends
• Total expenditure on the product (and similar products) in the market
• Retail sales volume and market prices of the product
• Future outlook for the market and potential opportunities
The value of such information supplied by specialist agencies is readily apparent—these 
reports provide a quick overview of the size and structure of a nation’s market for a product. 
Reports vary in their cost (depending on the market and product), but many can be had for 
around $750 to $1,500. The company also allows online purchase of reports in small segments 
for as little as $20 each. We discuss other sources for this type of market data later in this chapter.
Thus, companies that enter the market in industrialized countries often have a great deal 
of data available on that particular market. What becomes important then is the forecast for the 
growth or contraction of a potential market. One way of forecasting market demand is by deter-
mining a product’s income elasticity—the sensitivity of demand for a product relative to changes 
in income. The income-elasticity coefficient for a product is calculated by dividing a percentage 
change in the quantity of a product demanded by a percentage change in income. A coefficient 
greater than 1.0 conveys an income-elastic product, or one for which demand increases more 
relative to an increase in income. These products tend to be discretionary purchases, such as com-
puters, video games, jewelry, or expensive furniture—generally not considered essential items. 
A coefficient less than 1.0 conveys an income-inelastic product, or one for which demand increases 
less relative to an increase in income. These products are considered essential and include food, 
utilities, and beverages. To illustrate, if the income-elasticity coefficient for carbonated beverages 
is 0.7, the demand for carbonated beverages will increase 0.7 percent for every 1.0 percent increase 
in income. Conversely, if the income-elasticity coefficient for smartphones is 1.3, the demand for 
smartphones will increase 1.3 percent for every 1.0 percent increase in income.
emerging markets The biggest emerging markets are more important today than ever. Nearly 
every large company engaged in international business is either already in or is considering 
entering the big emerging markets such as China and India. With their large consumer bases 
and rapid growth rates, they whet the appetite of marketers around the world. Although these 
markets are surely experiencing speed bumps along their paths of economic development, in the 
long term they cannot be ignored.
Companies considering entering emerging markets often face special problems related to a 
lack of information. Data on market size or potential may not be available, for example, because

of undeveloped methods for collecting such data in a country. But there are ways companies can 
assess potential in emerging markets. One way is for them to rank different locations by devel-
oping a so-called market-potential indicator for each. This method, however, is only useful to 
companies considering exporting. Companies considering investing in an emerging market must 
look at other factors, which we examine next in the discussion of measuring site potential. The 
main variables commonly included in market-potential analyses are as follows:3
• Market Size This variable provides a snapshot of the size of a market at any point in time. 
It does not estimate the size of a market for a particular product but rather the size of the 
overall economy. Market-size data allows managers to rank countries from largest to small-
est, regardless of a particular product. Market size is typically estimated from a nation’s 
total population or the amount of energy it produces and consumes.
• Market Growth Rate This variable reflects the fact that, although the overall size of the 
market (economy) is important, so too is its rate of growth. It helps managers avoid mar-
kets that are large but shrinking and instead target those that are small but rapidly expand-
ing. It is generally obtained through estimates of growth in gross domestic product (GDP) 
and energy consumption.
• Market Intensity This variable estimates the wealth or buying power of a market from the ex-
penditures of both individuals and businesses. It is estimated from per capita private consump-
tion and/or per capita gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (see Chapter 4).
• Market Consumption Capacity The purpose of this variable is to estimate spending 
capacity. It is often estimated from the percentage of a market’s population that is in the 
middle class, thereby concentrating on the core of an economy’s buying power.
• Commercial Infrastructure This factor attempts to assess channels of distribution and com-
munication. Variables may include the number of telephones, TVs, fax machines, or personal 
computers per capita; the density of paved roads or number of vehicles per capita; and the popu-
lation per retail outlet. An increasingly important variable for businesses relying on the Internet 
for sales is the number of Internet hosts per capita. But because these data become outdated 
quickly, care must be taken to ensure accurate information from the most current sources.
• Economic Freedom This variable attempts to estimate the extent to which free-market 
principles predominate. It is typically a summary of government trade policies, government 
involvement in business, the enforcement of property rights, and the strength of the black 
market. A useful resource is the annual Freedom in the World report published by Freedom 
House (www.freedomhouse.org).
• Market Receptivity This variable attempts to estimate market “openness.” One way it can 
be estimated is by determining a nation’s volume of international trade as a percentage of 
GDP. If a company wants to see how receptive a market is to goods from its home country, 
it can ascertain the amount of per capita imports entering the market from the home coun-
try. Managers can also examine the growth (or decline) in these imports.
• Country Risk This variable attempts to estimate the total risk of doing business, includ-
ing political, economic, and financial risks. Some market-potential estimation techniques 
include this variable in the market-receptivity variable. This factor is typically obtained 
from one of the many services that rate the risk of different countries, such as Political Risk 
Services Group (www.prsgroup.com).
After each of these factors is analyzed, they are assigned values according to their importance to 
the demand for a particular product. Potential locations are then ranked (assigned a  market-potential 
indicator value) according to their appeal as a new market. As you may recall, we discussed several 
of these variables earlier in the book under the topics of national and international business environ-
ments. For example, economic freedom is shown in Map 3.1 (pages 114–115), country risk levels 
are shown in Map 4.2 (pages 144–145), and market receptivity (or openness) is shown in Map 5.1 
(pages 164–165). Map 12.1 (pages  336–337) captures one other variable, commercial infrastruc-
ture, by showing the number of fixed-line and mobile phone subscribers per 1,000 people in each 
nation. This variable is an important indicator of a nation’s overall economic development. Other 
variables that are also good proxies for this variable include the portion of a nation’s roads that 
are paved or the number of personal computers, fax machines, and Internet hosts it has. One key 
cautionary note, however, is that emerging markets often either lack such statistics or, in the case of 
paved roads, international comparison is difficult.

 
Chapter 12 • analyzing international opportunities  335
meASurIng SITe POTenTIAL In this step of the site-screening process, managers must 
carefully assess the quality of the locally available resources. For many companies, the most 
important of these will be human resources—both labor and management. Wages are lower in 
certain markets because labor is abundant, relatively less skilled (though perhaps well educated), 
or both. Employees may or may not be adequately trained to manufacture a given product or to 
perform certain R&D activities. If workers are not adequately trained, the site-selection process 
must consider the additional money and time needed to train them.
Training local managers also requires a substantial investment of time and money. A lack of 
qualified local managers sometimes forces companies to send managers from the home market to 
the local market. This adds to costs because home-country managers must often receive significant 
bonuses for relocating to the local market. Companies must also assess the productivity of local 
labor and managers. After all, low wages tend to reflect low productivity levels of a workforce.
Managers should also examine the local infrastructure, including roads, bridges, airports, 
seaports, and telecommunications systems, when assessing site potential. Each of these systems 
can have a major impact on the efficiency with which a company transports materials and prod-
ucts. Of chief importance to many companies today is the state of a country’s telecommunica-
tions infrastructure. Much business today is conducted through e-mail, and many businesses 
relay information electronically about matters such as sales orders, inventory levels, and produc-
tion strategies, which must be coordinated among subsidiaries in different countries. Managers, 
therefore, must examine each potential site to determine how well it is prepared for contempo-
rary communications.
Step 4: Select the market or Site
This final step in the screening process involves the most intensive efforts to assess the remain-
ing potential markets and sites—typically less than a dozen, sometimes just one or two. At this 
stage, managers normally want to visit each remaining location in order to confirm earlier ex-
pectations and to perform a competitor analysis. In the final analysis, managers normally evalu-
ate each potential location’s contribution to cash flows by undertaking a financial evaluation of a 
proposed investment. The specialized and technical nature of this analysis can be found in most 
textbooks on corporate finance.
fIeLD TrIPS The importance of top managers making a personal visit to each remaining 
potential market or site cannot be overstated. Such trips typically involve attending strings of 
meetings and engaging in tough negotiations. The trip represents an opportunity for managers 
to see firsthand what they have so far seen only on paper. It gives them an opportunity to 
experience the culture, observe in action the workforce that they might soon employ, or make 
personal contact with potential new customers and distributors. Any remaining issues tend to be 
thoroughly investigated during field trips so that the terms of any agreement are precisely known 
in the event that a particular market or site is chosen. Managers can then usually return to the 
chosen location to put the terms of the final agreement in writing.
COmPeTITOr AnALySIS Because competitor analysis was covered in detail in Chapter 11, we 
offer only a few comments here. Intensely competitive markets typically put downward pressure 
on the prices that firms can charge their customers. In addition, intensely competitive sites for 
production and R&D activities often increase the costs of doing business. Naturally, lower 
prices and higher costs due to competitive forces must be balanced against the potential benefits 
offered by each market and site under consideration. At the very least, then, competitor analysis 
should address the following issues:
• Number of competitors in each market (domestic and international)
• Market share of each competitor
• Whether each competitor’s product appeals to a small market segment or has mass appeal
• Whether each competitor focuses on high quality or low price
• Whether competitors tightly control channels of distribution
• Customer loyalty commanded by competitors
• Potential threat from substitute products
• Potential entry of new competitors into the market
• Competitors’ control of key production inputs (such as labor, capital, and raw materials)

So far, we have examined a model that many companies follow when selecting new markets 
or sites for operations. We have seen what steps companies take in the screening process, but we 
have yet to learn how they undertake such a complex task. Let’s now explore the types of situa-
tions companies encounter when conducting research in an international setting and the specific 
tools used in their research.

Secondary Market Research
When trying to target specific population segments, marketing managers require highly detailed 
information. Fortunately, companies are often spared the time, money, and effort of collecting 
firsthand data for the simple reason that it has already been gathered. Companies can consult a 
variety of sources to obtain information on a nation’s business environment and markets. The 
particular source that managers should consult depends on many factors, including the com-
pany’s industry, the national markets they are considering, and how far along they are in the 
location-screening process.
The process of obtaining information that already exists within the company or that can 
be obtained from outside sources is called secondary market research. Managers often use 
information gathered from secondary research activities to broadly estimate market demand for 
a product or to form a general impression of a nation’s business environment. Secondary data are 
relatively inexpensive because they have already been collected, analyzed, and summarized by 
another party. Let’s take a look at the main sources of secondary data that help managers make 
more-informed location-selection decisions.
International Organizations
There are excellent sources of free and inexpensive information about product demand in particu-
lar countries. For example, the International Trade Statistics Yearbook published by the United 
Nations (www.un.org) lists the export and import volumes of different products for each country. 
It also furnishes information on the value of exports and imports on an annual basis for the most 
recent five-year period. The International Trade Center (www.intracen.org), based in Geneva, 
Switzerland, also provides current import and export figures for more than 100 countries.
International development agencies, such as the World Bank (www.worldbank.org), the 
International Monetary Fund (www.imf.org), and the Asian Development Bank (www.adb.org), 
also provide valuable secondary data. For example, the World Bank publishes annual data on 
each member nation’s population and economic growth rate. Today, most secondary sources 
supply downloadable data through the Internet or through traditional printed media.
government Agencies
Commerce departments and international trade agencies of most countries typically supply 
information about import and export regulations, quality standards, and the size of various 
markets. This data is normally available directly from these departments, from agencies within 
each nation, and from the commercial attaché in each country’s embassy abroad. In fact, visiting

embassies and attending their social functions while visiting a potential location are excellent 
ways of making contact with prospective future business partners.
Granted, the attractively packaged information supplied by host nations often ignores many 
potential hazards in a nation’s commercial environment—governments typically try to present 
their countries in the best possible light. By the same token, such sources are prone to paint 
incomplete or one-sided portraits of the home market. It is important for managers to seek addi-
tional sources that take a more objective view of a potential location.
One source that takes a fairly broad view of markets is the Central Intelligence Agency’s 
World Factbook (www.cia.gov). This source can be a useful tool throughout the entire market- or 
site-screening process because of its wealth of facts on each nation’s business environment. It 
identifies each nation’s geography, climate, terrain, natural resources, land use, and important 
environmental issues in detail. It also examines each nation’s culture, system of government, and 
economic conditions, including government debt and exchange-rate conditions. It also provides 
an overview of the quality of each country’s transportation and communication systems.
The Trade Information Center (TIC; www.export.gov), operated by the U.S. Department 
of Commerce, is a first stop for many importers and exporters. The TIC details product stan-
dards in other countries and offers advice on opportunities and best prospects for U.S. com-
panies in individual markets. It also offers information on federal export-assistance programs 
that can be essential for first-time exporters. Other TIC information includes the following:
• National trade laws and other regulations
• Trade shows, trade missions, and special events
• Export counseling for specific countries
• Import tariffs and customs procedures
• The value of exports to other countries
The Chilean Trade Commission within Chile’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been particularly 
aggressive in recent years in promoting Chile to the rest of the world. ProChile (www.chileinfo.com) 
has 35 commercial offices worldwide. The organization assists in developing the export process, 
establishing international business relationships, fostering international trade, attracting investment, 
and forging strategic alliances. It offers a wealth of information on all of Chile’s key industries and 
provides business environment information such as risk ratings. It also provides details on important 
trade regulations and standards of which exporters, importers, and investors must be aware.4
Commercial offices of the states and provinces of many countries also typically have offices 
in other countries to promote trade and investment. These offices usually encourage investment

in the home market by companies from other countries and will sometimes even help com-
panies in other countries export to the home market. For example, the Lorraine Development 
Corporation in Atlanta is the investment-promotion office of the Lorraine region of France. This 
corporation helps U.S. companies evaluate location opportunities in the Lorraine region—a pop-
ular area for industrial investment. It supplies information on sites, buildings, financing options, 
and conditions in the French and European Union business environment and conducts 10 to 20 
site-selection studies per year for investors.
Finally, many governments open their research libraries to businesspeople from all coun-
tries. For example, the Japanese External Trade Organization (JETRO; www.jetro.go.jp) in 
central Tokyo has a large library full of trade data that is available to international companies 
already in Japan. In addition, the JETRO website is useful for companies screening the potential 
of the Japanese market for future business activities from any location. The organization is dedi-
cated to serving companies interested in exporting to or investing in Japan in addition to assist-
ing Japanese companies in going abroad.
Industry and Trade Associations
Companies often join associations composed of firms within their own industry or trade. In par-
ticular, companies trying to break into new markets join such associations in order to make con-
tact with others in their field. The publications of these organizations keep members informed 
about current events and help managers to keep abreast of important issues and opportunities. 
Many associations publish special volumes of import and export data for domestic markets. 
They frequently compile directories that list each member’s top executives, geographic scope, 
and contact information such as phone numbers and addresses. Today, many associations also 
maintain informative websites. Two interesting examples are the websites of the National Pasta 
Association (www.ilovepasta.org) and the National Onion Association (www.onions-usa.org).
Sometimes industry and trade associations commission specialized studies of their industries, 
the results of which are then offered to their members at subsidized prices. These types of stud-
ies typically address particularly important issues or explore new opportunities for international 
growth. The National Confectioners Association (www.candyusa.com) of the United States, 
together with the state of Washington’s Washington Apple Commission (www.bestapples.com), 
once hired a research firm to study the sweet tooth of Chinese consumers. The findings of the study 
were then made available to each organization’s members to act on as they saw fit.
Service Organizations
Many international service organizations in fields such as banking, insurance, management 
consulting, and accounting offer information to their clients on cultural, regulatory, and finan-
cial conditions in a market. For example, the accounting firm of Ernst & Young (www.ey.com) 
publishes a “Doing Business In” series for most countries. Each booklet contains information on 
a nation’s business environment, regulations regarding foreign investment, legal forms of busi-
nesses, labor force, taxes, and culture. Other companies provide specific and overall information 
on world markets. Managers can consult such organizations for specialized reports on market 
demographics, lifestyles, consumer data, buyer behavior, and advertising.
Internet
Companies engaged in international business are quickly realizing the wealth of secondary re-
search information available on the Internet and the World Wide Web. These electronic resources 
are usually user friendly and have vast amounts of information.
LEXIS-NEXIS (www.lexisnexis.com) is a leading online provider of market informa-
tion. This database of full-text news reports from around the world is updated continually. It 
also offers special services such as profiles of executives and products and information on the 
financial conditions, marketing strategies, and public relations of many international companies. 
Other popular online providers of global information include DIALOG (www.dialog.com) and 
Dow Jones (www.dowjones.com). Internet search engines such as Google (www.google.com) 
and Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) are also helpful in narrowing down the plethora of information 
available electronically.
The Internet can be especially useful in seeking information about potential production 
sites. Because field trips to the most likely candidates are expensive, online information can be 

 
Chapter 12 • analyzing international opportunities  341
enormously helpful in saving both time and money. For example, you can begin a search for infor-
mation on a particular country or region with most large online information providers. Narrowing 
your search to a more manageable list of subjects—say, culture, economic conditions, or perhaps a 
specific industry—can yield clues about sites that are promising and those that are not.
Problems with Secondary research
The great benefit of secondary data is that it spares companies the time, money, and effort of col-
lecting firsthand data for the simple reason that it has already been gathered. Yet, two problems 
with secondary data can arise when researching potential markets and sites.
AvAILABILITy Of DATA There tends to be plenty of excellent sources of secondary data in highly 
industrialized countries. This is especially true in Australia, Canada, Japan, Western Europe, the 
United States, and where government agencies and private research firms supply information. Three 
of these information suppliers are ACNielsen (www.nielsen.com), SymphonyIRI Group (www.
symphonyiri.com), and Survey Research Group (www.surveyresearchgroup.com). Table 12.1 
contains a listing of the top market research firms.
In many emerging and developing countries, however, previously gathered quality infor-
mation is hard to obtain. Even when market data is available, its reliability is questionable. For 
example, analysts sometimes charge the governments of certain emerging markets with trying 
to lure investors by overstating estimates of gross income and consumption levels. In addition to 
deliberate misrepresentation, tainted information can also result from improper local collection 
methods and analysis techniques. But research agencies in emerging and developing markets 
that specialize in gathering data for clients in industrialized countries are developing higher-
quality techniques of collection and analysis. For example, information supplier and pollster 
Gallup (www.gallup.com) is aggressively expanding its operations throughout Southeast Asia in 
response to the need among Western companies for more accurate market research.
COmPArABILITy Of DATA Data obtained from other countries must be interpreted with great 
caution. Because terms such as poverty, consumption, and literacy differ greatly from one 
country to another, such data must be accompanied by precise definitions. In the United States, 
for example, a family of four is said to be below the poverty line if its annual income is $23,850.5 
The equivalent income for a Vietnamese family of four would place it in the upper class.
The different ways in which countries measure data also affect comparability across bor-
ders. For instance, some countries state the total quantity of foreign direct investment in their 
nations in terms of its monetary value. Others specify it in terms of the number of investment 
projects implemented during the year. But a single foreign direct investment into an industrial-
ized nation can be worth many times what several or more projects are worth in a developing 
nation. To gather a complete picture of a nation’s investments, researchers will often need to 
obtain both figures. Moreover, reported statistics may not distinguish between foreign direct

investment (accompanied by managerial control) and portfolio investment (which is not accom-
panied by managerial control). Misinterpreting data because one does not know how they are 
compiled or measured can sabotage even the best marketing plans and production strategies.
QuiCk Study 3
 1. Obtaining information that already exists within or outside the company is called what?
 2. What is a possible source of secondary research data?
 3. What is a potential problem that can arise with the use of secondary research data?
Primary Market Research
Although secondary information is very useful in the early stages of the screening process, some-
times more-tailored data on a location is needed. Under such circumstances, it might be necessary 
to conduct primary market research—the process of collecting and analyzing original data and 
applying the results to current research needs. This type of information is very helpful in filling 
in the blanks left by secondary research. Yet, it is often more expensive to obtain than secondary 
research data because studies must be conducted in their entirety. Let’s explore some of the more 
common methods of primary research used by companies in the location-screening process.
Trade Shows and Trade missions
An exhibition at which members of an industry or group of industries showcase their latest 
products, study activities of rivals, and examine recent trends and opportunities is called a trade 
show. Trade shows are held on a continuing basis in virtually all markets and normally attract 
companies from around the globe. They are typically held by national or global industry trade 
associations or by government agencies. An excellent source of information about trade shows 
and exhibitions worldwide is Expo Central (www.expocentral.com).
Not surprisingly, the format and scope of trade shows differ from country to country. For 
example, because of its large domestic market, shows in the United States tend to be oriented 
toward business opportunities within the U.S. market. In line with U.S. culture, the atmosphere 
tends to be fairly informal. Conversely, because of the relatively smaller market of Germany and 
its participation in the European Union, trade shows there tend to showcase business opportuni-
ties in markets all across Europe and tend to be quite formal.
National culture plays a role in the extent to which companies take advantage of trade 
shows and other tools to become successful abroad. The entrepreneurial culture of the United 
States ensures that trade groups actively encourage small businesses to pursue international 
opportunities. To see how two small U.S. companies pursued opportunities to go international, 
read this chapter’s Culture Matters feature, titled “Is the World Your Oyster?”
A trade mission is an international trip by government officials and businesspeople that is 
organized by agencies of national or provincial governments for the purpose of exploring inter-
national business opportunities. Businesspeople who attend trade missions are typically intro-
duced both to important business contacts and to well-placed government officials.
Small and medium-sized companies often find trade missions very appealing for two rea-
sons. First, the support of government officials gives them additional clout in the target country 
as well as access to officials and executives whom they would otherwise have little opportunity 
to meet. Second, although such trips can sometimes be expensive for the smallest of businesses, 
they are generally worth the money because they almost always reap cost-effective rewards. 
Trade missions to faraway places sometimes involve visits to several countries in order to 
maximize the return for the time and money invested. For instance, a trade mission for European 
businesspeople to Latin America may include stops in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. A 
trade mission to Asia for North American or European companies might include stops in China, 
Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand.
Interviews and focus groups
Although industry data are useful to companies early in the screening process for potential markets, 
subsequent steps must assess buyers’ emotions, attitudes, and cultural beliefs. Industry data can-
not tell us how individuals feel about a company or its product. This type of buyer information is

required when deciding whether to enter a market and when developing an effective marketing plan. 
Therefore, many companies supplement the large-scale collection of country data with other types 
of research such as interviews with prospective customers. Interviews, of course, must be conducted 
carefully if they are to yield reliable and unbiased information. Respondents in some cultures might 
be unwilling to answer certain questions or may intentionally give vague or misleading answers in 
order to avoid getting too personal. For example, although individuals in the United States are re-
nowned for their willingness to divulge all sorts of information about their shopping habits and even 
their personal lives, this is very much the exception among other countries.
An unstructured but in-depth interview of a small group of individuals (8 to 12 people) by a 
moderator in order to learn the group’s attitudes about a company or its product is called a focus 
group. Moderators guide a discussion on a topic and interfere as little as possible with the free flow 
of ideas. The interview is recorded for later evaluation to identify recurring or prominent themes 
among the participants. This type of research helps marketers to uncover negative perceptions among 
buyers and to design corrective marketing strategies. Because subtle differences in verbal and body 
language could go unnoticed, focus group interviews tend to work best when moderators are natives 
of the countries in which the interview is held. Ironically, it is sometimes difficult to conduct focus 
groups in collectivist cultures (see Chapter 2) because people have a tendency to agree with others in 
the group. In such instances, it might be advisable to conduct a consumer panel—research in which 
people record in personal diaries information on their attitudes, behaviors, or purchasing habits.
Surveys
Research in which an interviewer asks current or potential buyers to answer written or verbal 
questions in order to obtain facts, opinions, or attitudes is called a survey. For example, if 
Saucony (www.saucony.com) wants to learn about consumer attitudes toward its latest women’s 
running shoe, it could ask a sample of women about their attitudes toward the shoe. Verbal 
questioning could be done in person or over the telephone, whereas written questioning could be 
done in person, through the mail, or through forms completed at Saucony’s website. The results 
would then be tabulated, analyzed, and applied to the development of a marketing plan.
The single greatest advantage of survey research is the ability to collect vast amounts of data 
in a single sweep. But as a rule, survey methods must be adapted to local markets. For example, 
survey research can be conducted by any technological means in industrialized markets, such 
as over the telephone or the Internet. But telephone interviewing would yield poor results in 
Bangladesh because only a small percentage of the general population has telephones. Also, 
although a survey at a website is an easy way to gather data, it must be remembered that even 
in some industrialized nations users still represent mostly middle- to upper-income households.

The business culture of every nation supports the international 
expansion efforts of its businesses to some degree. But what kinds 
of actions and information are useful to companies? Here are a few 
helpful pointers followed by two company examples:
• Small companies must first do lots of homework before 
jumping into the global marketplace. Going international is 
a long-term investment, and preparedness is a critical suc-
cess factor. Companies must plan on investing a good deal 
of cash. A typical small business can expect to pay anywhere 
from $10,000 to $20,000 to perform basic market research, to 
attend a trade show, and to visit one or two countries.
• Lucille Farms, Inc., of Montville, New Jersey, produces and 
markets cheese products. Alfonso Falivene, Lucille’s chief ex-
ecutive, is taking a cautious approach to going international. 
He recently joined the U.S. Dairy Export Council, which offers 
members, among other things, international trips to study 
new business opportunities and the competition. The council 
also offers its members a great deal of free information on 
international markets. Falivene says the council supplied mar-
ket information that would have cost him thousands of dollars 
to obtain on his own.
• Meter-Man, Inc., of Winnebago, Minnesota, manufactures 
agricultural measuring devices. When Meter-Man decided to 
go international, it saw trade shows as a great way to gain 
market intelligence and establish contacts. At a five-day ag-
ricultural fair in Paris, company executives held 21 meetings 
with potential customers and sealed an agreement with a 
major distributor that covers the Parisian market for Meter-
Man’s products. Meter-Man’s sales and marketing director 
was on a flight to a trade show in Barcelona, Spain, and 
struck up a conversation with the man next to him. The man 
wound up ordering $200,000 of Meter-Man’s products and is 
today a major South American distributor for the company.

Written surveys can also be hampered by other problems. Some countries’ postal services 
are unreliable to the point that parcels are delivered weeks or months after arriving at post 
offices, or they never arrive at all because they are stolen or simply lost. Naturally, written sur-
veys are impractical to conduct in countries with high rates of illiteracy, although this problem 
can perhaps be overcome by obtaining verbal responses to spoken questions.
environmental Scanning
An ongoing process of gathering, analyzing, and dispensing information for tactical or strategic 
purposes is called environmental scanning. The environmental scanning process entails obtain-
ing both factual and subjective information on the business environments in which a company is 
operating or considering entering. The continuous monitoring of events in other locations keeps 
managers aware of potential business opportunities and threats. Environmental scanning con-
tributes to making well-informed decisions and to the development of effective strategies. It also 
helps companies develop contingency plans for a particularly volatile environment.
Problems with Primary research
Market research serves essentially the same function in all nations. A market’s unique conditions and 
circumstances, however, can present difficulties that force adjustments in the way research is per-
formed. Companies need to be aware of potential obstacles so that their research results are reliable.
Marketers who conduct research in unfamiliar markets must pay attention to the ways in 
which cultural variables influence information. Perhaps the single most important variable is 
language. For example, researchers unfamiliar with the language spoken in a market being 
investigated might be forced to rely on interpreters. Interpreters might unintentionally misrep-
resent certain comments or be unable to convey the sentiment with which statements are made.
Researchers might also need to survey potential buyers through questionnaires written in 
the local language. To avoid any misstatement of questions or results, questionnaires must be 
translated into the language of the target market and the responses then translated back into the 
researcher’s language. Written expressions must be highly accurate so that results do not become 
meaningless or misleading. The potential to conduct written surveys is also affected by the illit-
eracy rates among the local population. A written survey is generally impossible to conduct 
in countries with high illiteracy rates. Researchers would probably need to choose a different 
information-gathering technique, such as personal interviews or observation of retail purchases.
Companies that have little experience in an unfamiliar market often hire local agencies to 
perform some or all of their market research. Local researchers know the cultural terrain. They 
understand which practices are acceptable and which types of questions can be asked. And they 
typically know whom to approach for certain types of information. Perhaps most importantly, 
they know how to interpret the information they gather and are likely to understand its reliabil-
ity. But a company that decides to conduct its own market research must, if necessary, adapt its 
research techniques to the local market. Many cultural elements that are taken for granted in the 
home market must be reassessed in the host business environment.

A Final Word
To keep pace with an increasingly hectic and competitive global business environment, compa-
nies should follow a systematic screening process that incorporates high-quality research meth-
ods. This chapter provides a systematic way to screen potential locations as new markets or sites 
for business operations. But these issues constitute only the first step in the process of  “going in-

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Explain the importance of examining basic appeal and national factors.
• The first step in exploring a potential new market is identifying basic product 
 demand. Without basic demand there is no market.
• This step for assessing a new site for operations involves determining availability of 
resources for production, such as raw materials, labor, and capital. Without these fac-
tors a company may not be able to conduct its business.
• The second step involves examining the local culture, political, legal, and economic 
variables. Businesses seek nations with quality government bureaucracies, political 
stability, and sound monetary policies for both markets and sites.
 LO2. Describe how companies measure and select a market or site.
• The third step is to measure the potential of each market by exploring a market’s size 
and growth rate, and may involve calculating a market-potential indicator.
• This step for examining the suitability of a site for operations entails determining the 
availability of workers, managers, raw materials, and an adequate infrastructure.
• The fourth step involves visiting each remaining market or site to make a final decision. 
At this stage managers might perform a competitor analysis or a financial evaluation.
 LO3. Identify the main sources of secondary market research data.
• Free or inexpensive information about product demand in a country can be obtained 
from international organizations, including international development agencies like 
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
• Government agencies, such as commerce departments and international trade agencies, 
have information on import–export regulations, quality standards, and market size.
• Industry and trade associations often publish reports to keep managers abreast of im-
portant issues and opportunities.
• International service organizations in fields such as banking, insurance, consulting, 
and accounting offer their clients information on a market’s cultural, regulatory, and 
financial conditions.
 LO4. Describe common methods used to conduct primary market research.
• A trade show helps members of an industry showcase their latest products, see what 
rivals are doing, and learn about recent trends and opportunities.
• A trade mission takes government officials and businesspeople on international trips 
to explore business opportunities.
• Interviews help to assess potential buyers’ emotions, attitudes, and cultural beliefs. 
A focus group is an in-depth interview designed to uncover attitudes about a company 
or its product.
• Surveys obtain potential customers’ facts, opinions, or attitudes by asking written or 
verbal questions.
• The ongoing gathering, analyzing, and dispensing of information for tactical or stra-
tegic purposes is called environmental scanning.

emerging markets. Market size and potential is actually quite hard to judge, so you need to look at 
some other way of working out their potential. Ethically, you will avoid markets that seem to have 
political or social problems as you do not wish your corporation to be tainted with accusations that 
you are prepared to operate anywhere to make a profit.
 12-5. Decisions made about markets are based on secondary data. What ethical issues does this 
present?
 12-6. Is it ethical to be focussed on issues such as economic freedom when considering a market?
 12-7. What is “country risk” and what types of factors are considered when assessing market 
potential? Is it a fair measurement?
Teaming Up
In groups of three or four, draw up a list of ten common consumer products that you may have 
purchased over the past few months. Where were they made? Did some state they were made 
somewhere or assembled somewhere? Is there anything about the location of their manufacture 
that makes the product more or less attractive to you? Were there any real surprises? Once you 
have completed your investigations, share your findings and feelings with the rest of the class.

Singapore Rises to Prominence in the World Market
S
ince becoming an independent nation in 1965, Singapore has 
been on the rise economically. Although it occupies a small 
geographical area, its busy port has aided Singapore in gaining 
economic power. The per capita GNP is one of the highest in the 
world. Major exports include electronics and chemicals, creating 
profits that allow for the purchase of raw materials that are not 
native to the country. As a result, Singapore relies heavily on a 
strategy similar to entrepôt trading, which involves importing raw 
materials and refining them into goods to be exported.
Singapore’s economy is considered to be free market, and it 
is developing at a very rapid pace. A strong educational system 
 develops a large, skilled workforce, and the business environment 
up to this point has been relatively corruption free. Government 
intervention is generally kept to a minimum, but the government has 
undertaken several measures to promote further economic growth. 
Heavy investment in the diversification of the economy—namely the 
promotion of tourism and funding of the pharmaceutical  industry—
has served the economy well. For example, the Marina Bay Sands 
Casino opened in April 2010, attracting many foreign tourists and 
providing plenty of job opportunities for Singapore citizens.
Things haven’t always been so easy for Singapore. The country 
hit an economic slump from 2000 to 2003, due to a series of events 
outside its control. Economic recession in the United States and 
the European Union had harmful effects on economic growth. The 
rebound, however, was a complete success, as Singapore posted a 
7.5 percent growth in gross domestic product in 2007. The recovery 
went smoothly due to good economic strategy, a high percentage of 
skilled workers, and copious foreign investment. The assistance of 
government-linked corporations was also important in rebounding 
from the worldwide slump.
As the busiest trading hub in Southeast Asia, Singapore occ-
upies an enviable position in the world economy. Although this 
is a position of leverage and power, Singapore is also considered 
the most business-friendly economy in the world. Other  countries’ 
desire to trade with Singapore is high and shows no signs of 
dwindling. Along with South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, 
Singapore is one of the “Four Asian Tigers,” a title that refers to 
their economic strength and acumen.
The number of wealthy residents of the country has risen at 
a rapid rate as a result of the general economic success. In 2004, 
the number of Singapore’s U.S. dollar millionaires rose by 22.4 
percent. The growth has slowed since its peak in 2004, but the 
number of affluent residents is still on the rise. Singapore has now 
overtaken Hong Kong as the country with the highest concentration 
of millionaires in the world.
The economic climate of the world is changing, as smaller 
countries are becoming more powerful financially and closing in 
on larger countries with greater economic power. Globalization is 
providing the opportunity for countries like Singapore to step to 
the forefront of the trade market. If Singapore continues to employ 
the economic strategies it has up to this point, its future financial 
success is all but guaranteed.
Thinking globally
 12-10. As the economic adviser to the president of a small, 
developing country, what lessons can you take from 
Singapore’s economic approach to apply to your own 
country? Your country also has a functional, but not overly 
busy, port. What steps would you take to encourage trade 
with foreign countries?
 12-11. Do you think that the economy of Singapore will be 
greatly affected by changes in the financial status of 
 traditional economic superpowers? Why or why not?  
If the economy is affected, will it be positive or 
negative?
 12-12. Why do you think the strategy of extended entrepôt 
 trading—importing raw materials, refining them,  
then  exporting them to foreign countries—is  
effective?
 12-13. Is it possible for a country as small as Singapore to 
 become a worldwide economic superpower? What factors 
must be considered in answering this question? In the new 
global economy, does the size of a country matter at all if 
the economic strategy is effective? Is having a busy port 
enough of an economic boost to lift a small country to 
economic prominence?

LONDON, England—Marvel Enterprises (www.marvel.com) is a global character-
based entertainment licensing company that over a span of 70 years developed a 
library of more than 5,000 characters. Shown here are some of Marvel’s most popular 
characters that arose from the fertile imagination of Stan Lee, a comic book writer, 
an editor, an actor, a producer, a publisher, and the former president and chairman of 
Marvel Comics.
Marvel initially pursued licens-
ing as a means to become more than 
just a comics and toy company, and 
it has already brought top comic-
book  characters—including Iron Man, 
Spider-Man, Blade, X-Men, and the 
Hulk—to the big screen with enor-
mous success. The films do generate 
revenue for Marvel, but their main 
function is to popularize the compa-
ny’s comic-book characters.
Driving Marvel’s earnings in recent 
years are its character-based licensing 
agreements for products such as lunch-
boxes, toys, and video games. Marvel’s 
licensing business includes a deal with 
Hasbro (www.hasbro.com) to distribute 
action figures based on Marvel charac-
ters through the year 2017. Marvel earns 
royalties on all its toys sold worldwide (except Japan) through Hasbro. And Marvel’s re-
cent sale to Disney (www.disney.com) for $4.3 billion means that its characters are sure to 
take their adventures to even more movies, theme parks, and stores worldwide.
Marvel’s 50/50 joint venture with Sony (www.sony.com) oversees all licensing and 
merchandising activities for the film Spider-Man, as well as Sony’s animated TV series 
titled Spider-Man. Marvel went solo with Iron Man, taking the film to the big screen on 
its own.
But the company is not resting easy, marveling at its past success. Marvel 
International, based in England, is developing the firm’s licensing business in strategic 
international markets. Marvel’s former CEO Allen Lipson said, “This is a major stra-
tegic initiative for the company. Marvel’s international growth is largely untapped.” As 
you read this chapter, consider why companies go international, what the market entry 
modes available to them are, and when each mode is appropriate.1

The decision of how to enter a new market abroad must take into account many factors, includ-
ing the local business environment and a company’s own core competency. An entry mode is 
the institutional arrangement by which a firm gets its products, technologies, human skills, or 
other resources into a market. Companies seeking entry into new markets for manufacturing 
and/or marketing purposes have many potential entry modes at their disposal. The specific mode 
chosen depends on many factors, including experience in a market, the amount of control man-
agers desire, and the potential size of the market. In this chapter, we explore the following three 
categories of entry modes:
 1. Exporting, importing, and countertrade
 2. Contractual entry
 3. Investment entry
Exporting, Importing, and Countertrade
The most common method of buying and selling goods internationally is exporting and importing. 
Companies often import products in order to obtain less expensive goods or those that are simply 
unavailable in the domestic market. Companies export products when the international market-
place offers opportunities to increase sales and, in turn, profits. Companies worldwide (from both 
developed and developing countries) often see the United States as a great export opportunity be-
cause of the size of the market and the strong buying power of its citizens. Figure 13.1 showcases 
the top 10 exporters to the United States in terms of the value of goods sold.
Because this chapter focuses on how companies take their goods and services to the global 
marketplace, this first section concentrates on exporting. We then explain how companies use 
countertrade when cash transactions are not possible and discuss the main export/import financ-
ing methods. Because importing is a sourcing decision for most firms, it is covered in Chapter 15.
Why Companies Export
In the global economy, companies increasingly sell goods and services to wholesalers, retailers, 
industrial buyers, and consumers in other nations. Generally speaking, there are three main rea-
sons why companies begin exporting. First, many large companies use exporting to expand total 
sales when domestic markets become saturated. A greater sales volume lets a firm spread fixed 
production costs over a greater number of manufactured products, thereby lowering the cost of 
producing each unit of output. In short, this is a way to achieve economies of scale.
Second, exporting permits companies to diversify sales. In other words, they can offset 
slow sales in one national market (perhaps due to a recession) with increased sales in another. 
Diversified sales can level off a company’s cash flow, making it easier to coordinate payments to 
creditors with receipts from customers.
Third, companies can use exporting as a low-cost, low-risk way to gain international busi-
ness experience. Owners and managers of small companies, which typically have little or no

knowledge of how to conduct business in other cultures, use exporting to gain valuable interna-
tional experience.
Developing an Export Strategy: A Four-Step Model
Companies are often drawn into exporting when customers in other countries solicit their goods. 
In this way, companies become aware of their products’ international potential and get their first 
taste of international business.
Yet, a company should not fall into the habit of simply responding to random international 
requests for its products. A more logical approach is to research and analyze international oppor-
tunities and to develop a coherent export strategy. A business with such a strategy actively pur-
sues export markets rather than sitting back and waiting for international orders to come in. Let’s 
take a look at the four steps in developing a successful export strategy.
STEp 1: IDEnTIFy A pOTEnTIAL MArkET To identify whether demand exists in a particular 
target market, a company should perform market research and interpret the results (see 
Chapter 12). Novice exporters should focus on one or only a few markets. For example, a 
first-time Brazilian exporter might not want to export simultaneously to Argentina, Britain, 
and Greece. A better strategy would likely be to focus on Argentina because of its cultural 
similarities with Brazil (despite having a different, though related, language). The company 
could then expand into more diverse markets after it gains initial international experience in 
a nearby country. The would-be exporter should also seek expert advice on the regulations 
and general process of exporting and on any special issues related to a selected target 
market.
STEp 2: MATCh nEEDS TO ABILITIES The next step is to determine whether the company 
is capable of satisfying the needs of the market. Suppose a market located in a region with 
a warm, humid climate for much of the year displays the need for home air-conditioning 
equipment. If a company recognizes this need but makes only industrial-sized air-conditioning 
equipment, it might not be able to satisfy demand with its current product. But if the company 
is able to use its smallest industrial air-conditioning unit to satisfy the needs of several homes, 
it might have a market opportunity. If there are no other options or if consumers want their own 
individual units, the company will likely need to design a smaller air-conditioning unit or rule 
out entry into that market.
STEp 3: InITIATE MEETIngS Holding meetings early in the process with potential local 
distributors, buyers, and others is a must. Initial contact focuses on building trust and developing 
a cooperative climate among all parties. The cultural differences between the parties will come 
into play already at this stage. Beyond building trust, successive meetings are designed to 
estimate the potential success of any agreement if interest is shown on both sides. At the most 
advanced stage, negotiations take place and details of agreements are finalized.
For example, a group of environmental technology companies in Arizona was searching 
for markets abroad. A delegation from Taiwan soon arrived in the Arizona desert to survey the 
group’s products. Although days were busy with company visits, formal meetings, and negotia-
tions, evenings were used for building relationships. There were outdoor barbecues, hayrides, 
line dancing, and frontier-town visits that gave the visitors a feel for local culture and history. 
To make their counterparts from Taiwan feel comfortable, nighttime schedules included visits to 
karaoke spots and Chinese restaurants where a good deal of singing took place. Follow-up meet-
ings resulted in several successful deals.
STEp 4: COMMIT rESOurCES After all the meetings, negotiations, and contract signings, it is 
time to put the company’s human, financial, and physical resources to work. First, the objectives 
of the export program must be clearly stated and should extend out at least three to five years. 
For small firms, it may be sufficient to assign one individual the responsibility for drawing up 
objectives and estimating resources. Yet, as companies expand their activities to include more 
products and/or markets, many firms discover the need for an export department or division. The 
head of this department usually has the responsibility (and authority) to formulate, implement, 
and evaluate the company’s export strategy. See Chapter 11 for a detailed discussion of 
organizational design issues to consider at this stage.

Degree of Export Involvement
Companies of all sizes engage in exporting, but not all companies become involved in exporting 
to the same extent. Some exporting companies (usually entrepreneurs and small and medium-
sized firms) perform few or none of the activities necessary to get their products into a market 
abroad. Instead, they use intermediaries that specialize in getting products from one market into 
another. Other exporting companies (usually only the largest companies) perform all of their 
export activities themselves, with an infrastructure that bridges the gap between the two markets. 
Let’s take a closer look at the two basic forms of export involvement—direct exporting and in-
direct exporting.
DIrECT ExpOrTIng Some companies become deeply involved in the export of their products. 
Direct exporting occurs when a company sells its products directly to buyers in a target market. 
Direct exporters operate in many industries, including aircraft (Boeing; www.boeing.com), 
industrial equipment (John Deere; www.deere.com), apparel (Lands’ End; www.landsend.com), 
and bottled beverages (Evian; www.evian.com). Bear in mind that “direct exporters” need not 
sell directly to end users. Rather, they take full responsibility for getting their goods into the 
target market by selling directly to local buyers and not going through intermediary companies. 
Typically, they rely on either local sales representatives or distributors.
Sales representatives A sales representative (whether an individual or an organization) 
represents only its own company’s products, not those of other companies. Sales representatives 
promote those products in many ways, such as by attending trade fairs and by making personal 
visits to local retailers and wholesalers. They do not take title to the merchandise. Rather, they 
are hired by a company and normally are compensated with a fixed salary plus commissions 
based on the value of their sales.
Distributors Alternatively, a direct exporter can sell in the target market through distributors, 
who take ownership of the merchandise when it enters their country. As owners of the products, 
distributors accept all the risks associated with generating local sales. They sell either to 
retailers and wholesalers or to end users through their own channels of distribution. Typically, 
distributors earn a profit equal to the difference between the price they pay and the price they 
receive for the exporter’s goods. Although using a distributor reduces an exporter’s risk, it also 
weakens an exporter’s control over the price buyers are charged. A distributor who charges 
very high prices can stunt the growth of an exporter’s market share. Exporters should choose, if 
possible, distributors who are willing to invest in the promotion of their products and who do not 
sell directly competing products.
InDIrECT ExpOrTIng Some companies have few resources available to commit to exporting 
activities. Others simply find exporting a daunting task because of a lack of contacts and 
experience. Fortunately, there is an option for such firms. Indirect exporting occurs when 
a company sells its products to intermediaries who then resell to buyers in a target market. 
The choice of an intermediary depends on many factors, including the ratio of the exporter’s 
international sales to its total sales, the company’s available resources, and the growth rate of the 
target market. Let’s take a closer look at several different types of intermediaries: agents, export 
management companies, and export trading companies.
Agents Individuals or organizations that represent one or more indirect exporters in a target 
market are called agents. Agents typically receive compensation in the form of commissions 
on the value of sales. Because establishing a relationship with an agent is relatively easy and 
inexpensive, it is a fairly common approach to indirect exporting. Agents should be chosen 
very carefully because terminating an agency relationship if problems arise can be costly and 
difficult. Careful selection is also essential because agents often represent several indirect 
exporters simultaneously. Agents might focus their promotional efforts on the products of the 
company paying the highest commission rather than on the company with the better products.
Export Management Companies A company that exports products on behalf of an indirect 
exporter is called an export management company (EMC). An EMC operates contractually, 
either as an agent (being paid through commissions based on the value of sales) or as a 
distributor (taking ownership of the merchandise and earning a profit from its resale).

Chapter 13 • SeleCting and Managing entry ModeS  353
An EMC will usually provide additional services on a retainer basis, charging set fees 
against funds deposited on account. Typical EMC services include gathering market informa-
tion, formulating promotional strategies, performing specific promotional duties (such as attend-
ing trade fairs), researching customer credit, making shipping arrangements, and coordinating 
export documents. It is common for an EMC to exploit contacts predominantly in one industry 
(say, agricultural goods or consumer products) or in one geographic area (such as Latin America 
or Southeast Asia). Indeed, the biggest advantage of an EMC is usually a deep understanding 
of the cultural, political, legal, and economic conditions of the target market. Its staff works 
comfortably and effectively in the cultures of both the exporting and the target nation. The aver-
age EMC tends to deploy a wide array of commercial and political contacts in order to facilitate 
business activities on behalf of its clients.
Perhaps the only disadvantage of hiring an EMC is that the breadth and depth of its service 
can potentially hinder the development of the exporter’s own international expertise. But an 
exporter and its EMC typically have such a close relationship that an exporter often considers its 
EMC as a virtual exporting division. When this is the case, exporters learn a great deal about the 
intricacies of exporting from their EMC. Then, after the EMC contract expires, it is common for 
a company to go it alone in exporting its products.
Export Trading Companies A company that provides services to indirect exporters in addition 
to activities directly related to clients’ exporting activities is called an export trading company 
(ETC). Whereas an EMC is restricted to export-related activities, an ETC assists its clients by 
providing import, export, and countertrade services; developing and expanding distribution 
channels; providing storage facilities; financing trading and investment projects; and even 
manufacturing products.
European trading nations first developed the ETC concept centuries ago. More recently, the 
Japanese have refined the concept, which they call sogo shosha. The Japanese ETC can range in size 
from small, family-run businesses to enormous conglomerates such as Mitsubishi (www.mitsubishi.
com), Mitsui (www.mitsui.com), and ITOCHU (www.itochu.co.jp). An ETC in South Korea is 
called a chaebol and includes well-known companies such as Samsung (www.samsung.com) and 
Hyundai (www.hyundaigroup.com).
Japanese and South Korean ETCs have become formidable competitors because of their enor-
mous success in gaining global market share. These Asian companies quickly came to rival the 
dominance of the largest U.S. multinational corporations, which lobbied U.S. lawmakers for assis-
tance in challenging Asian ETCs in global markets. The result was the Export Trading Company 
Act passed in 1982. Despite this effort, the ETC concept never really caught on in the United 
States. Operations of the typical ETC in the United States remain small and are dwarfed by those 
of their Asian counterparts. One reason for the lack of interest in the ETC concept in the United 
States relative to that in Asia is that governments, financial institutions, and companies have much 
closer working relationships in Asia. The formation of huge conglomerates that engage in activities 
ranging from providing financing to manufacturing to distribution is easier to accomplish there. By 
contrast, the regulatory environment in the United States is wary of such cozy business arrange-
ments, and the lines between companies and industries are more clearly drawn.
Avoiding Export and Import Blunders
It is understandably easy for companies that are new to exporting to make mistakes. First, many 
businesses fail to conduct adequate market research before exporting. In fact, many companies 
begin exporting by responding to unsolicited requests for their products. If a company enters a 
market in this manner, it should quickly devise an export strategy to manage its export activities 
effectively and not strain its resources.
Second, many companies fail to obtain adequate export advice. National and regional gov-
ernments are often willing and able to help managers and small-business owners understand and 
cope with the vast amounts of paperwork required by each country’s export and import laws. 
Naturally, more experienced exporters can be extremely helpful as well. They can help novice 
exporters avoid embarrassing mistakes by guiding them through unfamiliar cultural, political, 
and economic environments.
To better ensure that it will not make embarrassing blunders, an inexperienced exporter 
might also want to engage the services of a freight forwarder—a specialist in export-related

activities such as customs clearing, tariff schedules, and shipping and insurance fees. Freight 
forwarders also can pack shipments for export and take responsibility for getting a shipment 
from the port of export to the port of import.
Countertrade
Companies are sometimes unable to import merchandise in exchange for financial payment. 
The reason is either that the government of the importer’s nation lacks the hard currency to pay 
for imports or that it intentionally restricts the convertibility of its currency. Fortunately, there 
is a way for firms to trade by using either a small amount of hard currency or even none at all. 
Selling goods or services that are paid for, in whole or in part, with other goods or services is 
called countertrade. Although countertrade often requires an extensive network of international 
contacts, even smaller companies can take advantage of its benefits.
Nations that have long used countertrade are found mostly in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, 
and the Middle East. A lack of adequate hard currency often forced those nations to use 
 countertrade to exchange oil for passenger aircraft and military equipment. Today, because of 
insufficient hard currency, developing and emerging markets frequently rely on countertrade to 
import goods. The greater involvement of firms from industrialized nations in those markets is 
expanding the use of countertrade.
TypES OF COunTErTrADE There are several different types of countertrade: barter, 
counterpurchase, offset, switch trading, and buyback. Let’s take a brief look at each of these.
• Barter is the exchange of goods or services directly for other goods or services without 
the use of money. It is the oldest known form of countertrade.
• Counterpurchase is the sale of goods or services to a country by a company that prom-
ises to make a future purchase of a specific product from that country. This type of agree-
ment is designed to allow the country to earn back some of the currency that it paid for the 
original imports.
• Offset is an agreement that a company will offset a hard-currency sale to a nation by mak-
ing a hard-currency purchase of an unspecified product from that nation in the future. It 
differs from a counterpurchase in that this type of agreement does not specify the type of 
product that must be purchased, just the amount that will be spent. Such an arrangement 
gives a business greater freedom in fulfilling its end of a countertrade deal.
• Switch trading is countertrade whereby one company sells to another its obligation to make 
a purchase in a given country. For example, in return for market access, a firm that wants to

enter a target market might promise to buy a product for which it has no use. The company 
then sells this purchase obligation to a large trading company that makes the purchase itself 
because it has a use for the merchandise. If the trading company has no use for the merchan-
dise, it can arrange for yet another buyer who needs the product to make the purchase.
• Buyback is the export of industrial equipment in return for products produced by that 
equipment. This practice usually typifies long-term relationships between the companies 
involved.
Countertrade can provide access to markets that are otherwise off-limits because of a lack 
of hard currency. It can also cause headaches. Much countertrade involves commodity and 
agricultural products such as oil, wheat, or corn—products whose prices on world markets tend 
to fluctuate a good deal. A problem arises when the price of a bartered product falls on world 
markets between the time that a deal is arranged and the time at which one party tries to sell 
the product. Fluctuating prices generate the same type of risk encountered in currency markets. 
Managers might be able to hedge some of this risk on commodity futures markets similar to how 
they hedge against currency fluctuations in currency markets (see Chapter 9).

Export/Import Financing
International trade poses risks for both exporters and importers. Exporters run the risk of not 
receiving payment after their products are delivered. Importers fear that delivery might not oc-
cur once payment is made for a shipment. Export/import financing methods designed to reduce 
these risks include advance payment, documentary collection, letter of credit, and open account 
(see Figure 13.2). Let’s explore each of these methods.
Advance payment
Export/import financing in which an importer pays an exporter for merchandise before it is shipped 
is called advance payment. This method of payment is common when two parties are unfamiliar 
with each other, the transaction is relatively small, or the buyer is unable to obtain credit because 
of a poor credit rating at banks. Payment normally takes the form of a wire transfer of money 
from the bank account of the importer directly to that of the exporter. Although prior payment

eliminates the risk of nonpayment for exporters, it creates the complementary risk of nonshipment 
for  importers—importers might pay for goods but never receive them. Thus, advance payment is 
the most favorable method for exporters but the least favorable for importers.
Documentary Collection
Export/import financing in which a bank acts as an intermediary without accepting financial risk 
is called documentary collection. This payment method is commonly used when there is an 
ongoing business relationship between two parties. The documentary collection process can be 
broken into three main stages and nine smaller steps (see Figure 13.3).
 1. Before shipping merchandise, the exporter (with its banker’s assistance) draws up a draft 
(bill of exchange)—a document ordering the importer to pay the exporter a specified sum 
of money at a specified time. A sight draft requires the importer to pay when goods are 
delivered. A time draft extends the period of time (typically 30, 60, or 90 days) following 
delivery by which the importer must pay for the goods. (When inscribed “accepted” by an 
importer, a time draft becomes a negotiable instrument that can be traded among financial 
institutions.) This stage includes Steps 1 and 2 in Figure 13.3.
 2. Following creation of the draft, the exporter delivers the merchandise to a transportation 
company for shipment to the importer. The exporter then delivers to its banker a set of 
documents that includes the draft, a packing list of items shipped, and a bill of lading—a 
contract between the exporter and shipper that specifies merchandise destination and ship-
ping costs. The bill of lading is proof that the exporter has shipped the merchandise. An 
international ocean shipment requires an inland bill of lading to get the shipment to the 
 exporter’s border and an ocean bill of lading for water transport to the importer nation. 
An international air shipment requires an air way bill that covers the entire international 
 journey. This stage includes Steps 3 and 4 in Figure 13.3.
 3. After receiving appropriate documents from the exporter, the exporter’s bank sends the 
documents to the importer’s bank. After the importer fulfills the terms stated on the draft 
and pays its own bank, the bank issues the bill of lading (which becomes title to the 
 merchandise) to the importer. This stage includes Steps 5 through 9 in Figure 13.3.

Documentary Collection 
Process

 
Chapter 13 • SeleCting and Managing entry ModeS  357
Documentary collection reduces the importer’s risk of nonshipment because the packing list 
details the contents of the shipment and the bill of lading is proof that the merchandise has been 
shipped. The exporter’s risk of nonpayment is increased because, although the exporter retains 
title to the goods until the merchandise is accepted, the importer does not pay until all necessary 
documents have been received. Although importers have the option of refusing the draft (and, 
therefore, the merchandise), this action is unlikely. Refusing the draft—despite all terms of the 
agreement being fulfilled—would make the importer’s bank unlikely to do business with the 
importer in the future.
Letter of Credit
Export/import financing in which the importer’s bank issues a document stating that the bank 
will pay the exporter when the exporter fulfills the terms of the document is called letter of 
credit. A letter of credit is typically used when an importer’s credit rating is questionable, when 
the exporter needs a letter of credit to obtain financing, and when a market’s regulations require 
it. Before a bank issues a letter of credit, it checks on the importer’s financial condition. This 
stage includes Steps 1 and 2 in Figure 13.4.
Banks normally issue letters of credit only after an importer has deposited on account a sum 
equal in value to that of the imported merchandise. The bank is still required to pay the exporter, 
but the deposit protects the bank if the importer fails to pay for the merchandise. Banks will 
sometimes waive this requirement for their most reputable clients.
There are several types of letters of credit:
• An irrevocable letter of credit allows the bank issuing the letter to modify its terms only 
after obtaining the approval of both exporter and importer.
• A revocable letter of credit can be modified by the issuing bank without obtaining approval 
from either the exporter or the importer.
• A confirmed letter of credit is guaranteed by both the exporter’s bank in the country of ex-
port and the importer’s bank in the country of import.

Letter of Credit Process

part 5 • international BuSineSS ManageMent
After the issuance of a letter of credit, the importer’s bank informs the exporter (through 
the exporter’s bank) that a letter of credit exists and that it may now ship the merchandise. The 
exporter then delivers a set of documents (according to the terms of the letter) to its own bank. 
These documents typically include an invoice, customs forms, a packing list, and a bill of lading. 
The exporter’s bank ensures that the documents are in order and pays the exporter. This stage 
includes Steps 3 through 7 in Figure 13.4.
When the importer’s bank is satisfied that the terms of the letter have been met, it pays the 
exporter’s bank. At that point, the importer’s bank is responsible for collecting payment from the 
importer. Letters of credit are popular among traders because banks assume most of the risks. 
This stage includes Steps 8 through 11 in Figure 13.4.
The letter of credit reduces the importer’s risk of nonshipment (as compared with advance 
payment) because the importer receives proof of shipment before making payment. Although 
the exporter’s risk of nonpayment is slightly increased, it is a more secure form of payment for 
exporters because the nonpayment risk is accepted by the importer’s bank when it issues pay-
ment to the exporter’s bank.
Open Account
Export/import financing in which an exporter ships merchandise and later bills the importer 
for its value is called open account. Because some receivables may not be collected, exporters 
should reserve shipping on open account only for their most trusted customers. This payment 
method is often used when the parties are very familiar with each other or for sales between two 
subsidiaries within an international company. The exporter simply invoices the importer (as in 
many domestic transactions), stating the amount and date due. This method reduces the risk of 
nonshipment faced by the importer under the advance payment method.
By the same token, the open account method increases the risk of nonpayment for the 
exporter. Thus, open account is the least favorable for exporters but the most favorable for 
importers. For some insights on how exporters can increase the probability of getting paid for a 
shipment, see the Manager’s Briefcase feature, titled “Collecting International Debts.”

What is the point of working hard to make an international sale if 
the buyer does not pay? There are seldom easy answers when an 
exporter is stuck without payment. Here are several pointers on 
what businesses can do to reduce the likelihood of not receiving 
payment:
• Knowledge of the market you are exporting to is your first 
and best defense. Understanding its culture, the language 
spoken, and its legal system is ideal. You should also under-
stand if there is typically a payment lag for business debts 
and customary debt-collection procedures.
• Be aware of countries that commonly cause problems when 
it comes to debt collection. Regularly consult the many free 
sources of information available on the Internet to learn 
which countries are problems. Avoid doing business with 
them and seek markets elsewhere.
• Both parties clearly understanding the payment terms in your 
export sales agreement is essential to preventing later collec-
tion problems. Also, be sure the buyer knows precisely when 
payment is to be issued.
• Do not wait too long to begin collecting a past-due account. 
Exporters who delay will likely never receive payment. Begin 
with firmly worded communications via phone, fax, e-mail, 
and letter.
• Consult an international trade attorney or hire an international 
debt-collection agency if necessary. If you are encouraged to 
accept arbitration as a way to resolve the issue, do so, as this 
often poses your best chance of seeing at least partial payment.

Chapter 13 • SeleCting and Managing entry ModeS  359
Contractual Entry Modes
The products of some companies simply cannot be traded in open markets because they are 
intangible. Thus, a company cannot use importing, exporting, or countertrade to exploit oppor-
tunities in a target market. Fortunately, there are other options for this type of company. A com-
pany can use a variety of contracts—licensing, franchising, management contracts, and turnkey 
projects—to market highly specialized assets and skills in markets beyond its nations’ borders.
Licensing
Companies sometimes grant other firms the right to use an asset that is essential to the produc-
tion of a finished product. Licensing is a contractual entry mode in which a company that owns 
intangible property (the licensor) grants another firm (the licensee) the right to use that property 
for a specified period of time. Licensors typically receive royalty payments based on a percent-
age of the licensee’s sales revenue generated by the licensed property. The licensors might also 
receive a one-time fee to cover the cost of transferring the property to the licensee. Commonly 
licensed intangible property includes patents, copyrights, special formulas and designs, trade-
marks, and brand names. Thus, licensing often involves granting companies the right to use pro-
cess technologies inherent to the production of a particular good. For example, Hitachi, of Japan, 
licensed technology to be used in the recycling of plastics from Duales System Deutschland of 
Germany.
An exclusive license grants a company the exclusive rights to produce and market a prop-
erty, or products made from that property, in a specific geographic region. The region can be the 
licensee’s home country or can extend to worldwide markets. A nonexclusive license grants a 
company the right to use a property but does not grant it sole access to a market. A licensor can 
grant several or more companies the right to use a property in the same region.
Cross licensing occurs when companies use licensing agreements to exchange intangible 
property with one another. For example, Fujitsu (www.fujitsu.com) of Japan signed a five-year 
cross-licensing agreement with Texas Instruments (www.ti.com) of the United States. The agree-
ment allowed each company to use the other’s technology in the production of its own goods—
thus lowering research and development (R&D) costs. The very extensive arrangement covered all 
but a few semiconductor patents owned by each company. Because asset values are seldom exactly 
equal, cross licensing also typically involves royalty payments from one party to the other.
ADvAnTAgES OF LICEnSIng There are several advantages to using licensing as an entry mode 
into new markets. First, licensors can use licensing to finance their international expansion. 
Most licensing agreements require licensees to contribute equipment and investment financing, 
whether by building special production facilities or by using existing excess capacity. Access to 
such resources can be a great advantage to a licensor who wants to expand but lacks the capital 
and managerial resources to do so. And because it need not spend time constructing and starting 
up its own new facilities, the licensor earns revenues sooner than it would otherwise.
Second, licensing can be a less risky method of international expansion for a licensor than 
other entry modes. Whereas some markets are risky because of social or political unrest, others 
defy accurate market research for a variety of reasons. Licensing helps shield the licensor from 
the increased risk of operating its own local production facilities in markets that are unstable or 
hard to assess accurately.
Third, licensing can help reduce the likelihood that a licensor’s product will appear on the 
black market. The side streets of large cities in many emerging markets are dotted with tabletop 
vendors eager to sell bootleg versions of computer software, Hollywood films, and recordings of 
internationally popular musicians. Producers can, to some extent, foil bootleggers by licensing 
local companies to market their products at locally competitive prices. Royalties will be lower 
than the profits generated by sales at higher international prices, but lower profits are better than 
no profits at all—which is what owners get from bootleg versions of their products.
Finally, licensees can benefit by using licensing as a method of upgrading existing produc-
tion technologies. For example, manufacturers of plastics and other synthetic materials in the 
Philippines attempted to meet the high standards demanded by the local subsidiaries of Japanese 
electronics and office equipment producers. To do this, D&L Industries of the Philippines upgraded 
its manufacturing process by licensing materials technology from Nippon Pigment of Japan.

part 5 • international BuSineSS ManageMent
DISADvAnTAgES OF LICEnSIng There also are important disadvantages to using licensing. 
First, it can restrict a licensor’s future activities. Suppose a licensee is granted the exclusive 
right to use an asset but fails to produce the sort of results that a licensor expected. Because the 
license agreement is exclusive, the licensor cannot simply begin selling directly in that particular 
market in order to meet demand itself nor can it contract with another licensee. A good product 
and lucrative market, therefore, do not guarantee success for a producer entering a market 
through licensing.
Second, licensing might reduce the global consistency of the quality and marketing of a 
licensor’s product in different national markets. A licensor might find the development of a 
coherent global brand image an elusive goal if each of its national licensees can operate in any 
manner it chooses. Promoting a global image might later require considerable amounts of time 
and money in order to change the misconceptions of buyers in the various licensed markets.
Third, licensing might amount to a company “lending” strategically important property to its 
future competitors. This is an especially dangerous situation when a company licenses assets on 
which its competitive advantage is based. Licensing agreements are often made for several years 
and perhaps even a decade or more. During this time, licensees often become highly competent at 
producing and marketing the licensor’s product. When the agreement expires, the licensor might 
find that its former licensee is capable of producing and marketing a better version of its own 
product. Licensing contracts can (and should) restrict licensees from competing in the future with 
products based strictly on licensed property. But enforcement of such provisions works only for 
identical or nearly identical products, not when substantial improvements are made.
Franchising
Franchising is a contractual entry mode in which one company (the franchiser) supplies an-
other (the franchisee) with intangible property and other assistance over an extended period. 
Franchisers typically receive compensation as flat fees, royalty payments, or both. The most 
popular franchises are those with widely recognized brand names, such as Mercedes (www.
mercedes.com), McDonald’s (www.mcdonalds.com), and Starbucks (www.starbucks.com). In 
fact, the brand name or trademark of a company is normally the single most important item 
desired by the franchisee. This is why smaller companies with lesser-known brand names and 
trademarks have greater difficulty locating interested franchisees.

Chapter 13 • SeleCting and Managing entry ModeS  361
Franchising differs from licensing in several ways. First, franchising gives a company 
greater control over the sale of its product in a target market. Franchisees must often meet 
strict guidelines on product quality, day-to-day management duties, and marketing promotions. 
Second, although licensing is fairly common in manufacturing industries, franchising is primar-
ily used in service industries such as auto dealerships, entertainment, lodging, restaurants, and 
business services. Third, although licensing normally involves a one-time transfer of property, 
franchising requires ongoing assistance from the franchiser. In addition to the initial transfer of 
property, franchisers typically offer start-up capital, management training, location advice, and 
advertising assistance to their franchisees.
Companies based in the United States dominate the world of international franchising. U.S. 
companies perfected the practice of franchising in their large, homogeneous domestic market 
with low barriers to interstate trade and investment. Yet franchising is growing in the European 
Union, with the advent of a single currency and a unified set of franchise laws. Many European 
managers with comfortable early-retirement packages have discovered franchising to be an 
appealing second career.
Despite projections for robust growth, European franchise managers often misunder-
stand the franchising concept. One example is when Holiday Inn’s franchise expansion in 
Spain was moving more slowly than expected. According to the company’s development 
director in Spain, Holiday Inn found that it needed to convince local managers that Holiday 
Inn did not want to “take control” of their hotels.2 In some Eastern European countries, 
local managers do not understand why they must continue to pay royalties to brand and 
trademark owners. Franchise expansion in Eastern European markets also suffers from a 
lack of local capital, high interest rates, high taxes, bureaucratic obstacles, restrictive laws, 
and corruption.3
ADvAnTAgES OF FrAnChISIng There are several important advantages of franchising. 
First, franchisers can use franchising as a low-cost, low-risk entry mode into new markets. 
Companies following global strategies rely on consistent products and common themes in 
worldwide markets. Franchising allows them to maintain consistency by replicating the 
processes for standardized products in each target market. Many franchisers, however, will 
make small modifications in products and promotional messages when marketing specifically 
to local buyers.
Second, franchising is an entry mode that allows for rapid geographic expansion. Firms 
often gain a competitive advantage by being first in seizing a market opportunity. For example, 
Microtel Inns & Suites (www.microtelinn.com) of Atlanta, Georgia, is using franchising to 
fuel its international expansion. Microtel is boldly entering Argentina and Uruguay and eyeing 
opportunities in Brazil and Western Europe. Rooms cost around $75 per night and target busi-
ness travelers who cannot afford $200 per night.4
Finally, franchisers can benefit from the cultural knowledge and know-how of local manag-
ers. This helps lower the risk of business failure in unfamiliar markets and can create a competi-
tive advantage.
DISADvAnTAgES OF FrAnChISIng Franchising can also pose problems for both 
franchisers and franchisees. First, franchisers may find it cumbersome to manage a large 
number of franchisees in a variety of national markets. A major concern is that product 
quality and promotional messages among franchisees will not be consistent from one 
market to another. One way to ensure greater control is by establishing in each market a so-
called master franchisee, which is responsible for monitoring the operations of individual 
franchisees.
Second, franchisees can experience a loss of organizational flexibility in franchising agree-
ments. Franchise contracts can restrict their strategic and tactical options, and they may even 
be forced to promote products owned by the franchiser’s other divisions. For years PepsiCo 
(www.pepsico.com) owned the well-known restaurant chains Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and KFC. 
As part of their franchise agreements with PepsiCo, restaurant owners were required to sell 
only PepsiCo beverages to their customers. Many franchisees worldwide were displeased with 
such restrictions on their product offerings and were relieved when PepsiCo spun off the res-
taurant chains.

Management Contracts
Under the stipulations of a management contract, one company supplies another with managerial 
expertise for a specific period of time. The supplier of expertise is normally compensated with ei-
ther a lump-sum payment or a continuing fee based on sales volume. Such contracts are commonly 
found in the public utilities sectors of developed and emerging markets. Two types of knowledge 
can be transferred through management contracts—the specialized knowledge of technical manag-
ers and the business-management skills of general managers.
ADvAnTAgES 
OF 
MAnAgEMEnT 
COnTrACTS Management contracts can benefit 
organizations and countries. First, a firm can award a management contract to another company 
and thereby exploit an international business opportunity without having to place a great deal 
of its own physical assets at risk. Financial capital can then be reserved for other promising 
investment projects that would otherwise not be funded.
Second, governments can award companies management contracts to operate and upgrade 
public utilities, particularly when a nation is short of investment financing. That is why the govern-
ment of Kazakhstan contracted with a group of international companies called ABB Power Grid 
Consortium to manage its national electricity-grid system for 25 years. Under the terms of the con-
tract, the consortium paid past wages owed to workers by the government and invested more than 
$200 million during the first three years of the agreement. The Kazakhstan government had neither 
the cash flow to pay the workers nor the funds to make badly needed improvements.
Third, governments use management contracts to develop the skills of local workers and 
managers. ESB International (www.esb.ie) of Ireland signed a three-year contract not only to 
manage and operate a power plant in Ghana, but also to train local personnel in the skills needed 
to manage it at some point in the future.
DISADvAnTAgES OF MAnAgEMEnT COnTrACTS Unfortunately, management contracts 
also pose two disadvantages for suppliers of expertise. First, although management contracts 
reduce the exposure of physical assets in another country, the same is not true for the supplier’s 
personnel: Political or social turmoil can threaten managers’ lives.
Second, suppliers of expertise may end up nurturing a formidable new competitor in the 
local market. After learning how to conduct certain operations, the party that had originally 
needed assistance may be capable of competing on its own. Firms must weigh the financial 
returns from a management contract against the potential future problems caused by a newly 
launched competitor.
Turnkey projects
When one company designs, constructs, and tests a production facility for a client, the agree-
ment is called a turnkey (build–operate–transfer) project. The term turnkey project is derived 
from the understanding that the client, who normally pays a flat fee for the project, is expected 
to do nothing more than simply “turn a key” to get the facility operating. The company awarded 
a turnkey project completely prepares the facility for its client.
Similar to management contracts, turnkey projects tend to be large-scale and often involve 
government agencies. But unlike management contracts, turnkey projects transfer special 
process technologies or production-facility designs to the client. They typically involve the 
construction of power plants, airports, seaports, telecommunication systems, and petrochemi-
cal facilities that are then turned over to the client. Under a management contract, the supplier 
of a service retains the asset—the managerial expertise. For example, Telecommunications 
Consultants India constructed telecom networks in both Madagascar and Ghana—two turnkey 
projects worth a combined total of $28 million.

Chapter 13 • SeleCting and Managing entry ModeS  363
ADvAnTAgES OF TurnkEy prOjECTS Turnkey projects provide benefits to providers and 
recipients. First, turnkey projects permit firms to specialize in their core competencies and to 
exploit opportunities that they could not undertake alone. Exxon Mobil (www.exxonmobil.
com) awarded a turnkey project to PT McDermott Indonesia (www.mcdermott.com) and Toyo 
Engineering (www.toyo-eng.co.jp) of Japan to build a liquid natural gas plant on the Indonesian 
island of Sumatra. The providers are responsible for constructing an offshore production 
platform, laying a 100-kilometer underwater pipeline, and building an on-land liquid natural 
gas refinery. The $316 million project is feasible only because each company contributes unique 
expertise to the design, construction, and testing of the facilities.
Second, turnkey projects allow governments to obtain designs for infrastructure projects 
from the world’s leading companies. For instance, Turkey’s government enlisted two separate 
consortiums of international firms to build four hydroelectric dams on its Coruh River. The dams 
combine the design and technological expertise of each company in the two consortiums. The 
Turkish government also awarded a turnkey project to Ericsson (www.ericsson.com) of Sweden 
to expand the country’s mobile telecommunication system.
DISADvAnTAgES OF TurnkEy prOjECTS Among the disadvantages of turnkey projects is the 
fact that a company may be awarded a project for political reasons rather than for technological 
know-how. Because turnkey projects are often of high monetary value and awarded by government 
agencies, the process of awarding them can be highly politicized. When the selection process is not 
entirely open, companies with the best political connections often win contracts, usually at inflated 
prices—the costs of which are typically passed on to local taxpayers.
Second, like management contracts, turnkey projects can create future competitors. A newly 
created local competitor could become a major supplier in its own domestic market and perhaps 
even in other markets where the supplier operates. Therefore, companies try to avoid projects in 
which there is danger of transferring their core competencies to others.

Investment Entry Modes
Investment entry modes entail direct investment in plant and equipment in a country coupled 
with ongoing involvement in the local operation. Entry modes in this category take a company’s 
commitment in a market to a higher level. Let’s explore three common forms of investment en-
try: wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, and strategic alliances.
Wholly Owned Subsidiaries
As the term suggests, a wholly owned subsidiary is a facility entirely owned and controlled by 
a single parent company. Companies can establish a wholly owned subsidiary either by forming 
a new company and constructing entirely new facilities (such as factories, offices, and equip-
ment) or by purchasing an existing company and internalizing its facilities. Whether an interna-
tional subsidiary is purchased or newly created depends to a large extent on its proposed opera-
tions. When a parent company designs a subsidiary to manufacture the latest high-tech products, 
it typically must build new facilities. The major drawback of creation from the ground up is the 
time it takes to construct new facilities, hire and train employees, and launch production.
Conversely, finding an existing local company capable of performing marketing and sales 
will be easier because special technologies are typically not needed. By purchasing the existing 
marketing and sales operations of an existing firm in the target market, the parent can have the 
subsidiary operating relatively quickly. Buying an existing company’s operations in the target 
market is a particularly good strategy when the company to be acquired has a valuable trade-
mark, brand name, or process technology.
ADvAnTAgES OF WhOLLy OWnED SuBSIDIArIES There are two main advantages to entering 
a market using a wholly owned subsidiary. First, managers have complete control over day-to-day 
operations in the target market and access to valuable technologies, processes, and other intangible 
properties within the subsidiary. Complete control also decreases the chance that competitors will 
gain access to a company’s competitive advantage, which is particularly important if it is technology-
based. Managers also retain complete control over the subsidiary’s output and prices. Unlike licensors 
and franchisers, the parent company also receives all profits generated by the subsidiary.
Second, a wholly owned subsidiary is a good mode of entry when a company wants to 
coordinate the activities of all its national subsidiaries. Companies using global strategies view 
each of their national markets as one part of an interconnected global market. Thus, the ability 
to exercise complete control over a wholly owned subsidiary makes this entry mode attractive to 
companies that are pursuing global strategies.
DISADvAnTAgES OF WhOLLy OWnED SuBSIDIArIES Wholly owned subsidiaries also present 
two primary disadvantages. First, they can be expensive undertakings because companies must 
typically finance investments internally or raise funds in financial markets. Obtaining the 
necessary funds can be difficult for small and medium-sized companies but relatively easy for 
the largest companies.
Second, risk exposure is high because a wholly owned subsidiary requires substantial 
company resources. One source of risk is political or social uncertainty or outright instability in 
the target market. Such risks can place both physical assets and personnel in serious jeopardy. 
The sole owner of a wholly owned subsidiary also accepts the risk that buyers will reject the 
company’s product. Parent companies can reduce this risk by gaining a better understanding of 
consumers prior to entering the target market.
joint ventures
Under certain circumstances, companies prefer to share ownership of an operation rather than 
take complete ownership. A separate company that is created and jointly owned by two or more 
independent entities to achieve a common business objective is called a joint venture. Joint ven-
ture partners can be privately owned companies, government agencies, or government-owned 
companies. Each party may contribute anything valued by its partners, including managerial tal-
ent, marketing expertise, market access, production technologies, financial capital, and superior 
knowledge or techniques of research and development. For example, Suzuki Motor Corporation, 
of Japan, formed a joint venture with the government of India to manufacture a small-engine car 
specifically for the Indian market.

jOInT vEnTurE COnFIgurATIOnS As we see in Figure 13.5, there are four main joint 
venture configurations.5 Although we illustrate each of these as consisting of just two partners, 
each configuration can also apply to ventures of several or more partners.
Forward Integration joint venture Figure 13.5(a) outlines a joint venture characterized 
by forward integration. In this type of joint venture, the parties choose to invest together in 
downstream business activities—activities further along in the “value system” that are normally 
performed by others. For instance, two household appliance manufacturers opening a retail 
outlet in a developing country would be a joint venture characterized by forward integration. 
The two companies now perform activities normally performed by retailers further along in the 
product’s journey to buyers.
Backward Integration joint venture Figure 13.5(b) outlines a joint venture characterized by 
backward integration. In other words, the joint venture signals a move by each company into 
upstream business activities—activities earlier in the value system that are normally performed 
by others. Such a configuration would result if two steel manufacturers formed a joint venture to 
mine iron ore. The companies now engage in an activity that is normally performed by mining 
companies.
Buyback joint venture Figure 13.5(c) outlines a joint venture whose input is provided by, 
and whose output is absorbed by, each of its partners. A buyback joint venture is formed when 
each partner requires the same component in its production process. It might be formed when a 
production facility of a certain minimum size is needed to achieve economies of scale but neither 
partner alone enjoys enough demand to warrant building it. However, by combining resources, the 
partners can construct a facility that serves their needs while achieving savings from economies 
of scale production. For instance, this was one reason behind the $500 million joint venture 
between Chrysler (www.chrysler.com) and BMW (www.bmw.com) to build small-car engines 
in Latin America. Each party benefited from the economies of scale offered by the plant’s annual 
production capacity of 400,000 engines—a volume that neither company could absorb alone.
Multistage joint venture Figure 13.5(d) outlines a joint venture that features downstream 
integration by one partner and upstream integration by another. A multistage joint venture often 
results when one company produces a good or service required by another. For example, a 
sporting goods manufacturer might join with a sporting goods retailer to establish a distribution 
company designed to bypass inefficient local distributors in a developing country.
ADvAnTAgES OF jOInT vEnTurES Joint ventures offer several important advantages to companies 
going international. Above all, companies rely on joint ventures to reduce risk. Generally, a joint

venture exposes fewer of a partner’s assets to risk than would a wholly owned subsidiary—each 
partner risks only its own contribution. That is why a joint venture entry might be a wise choice when 
market entry requires a large investment or when there is significant political or social instability in the 
target market. Similarly, a company can use a joint venture to learn about a local business environment 
prior to launching a wholly owned subsidiary. In fact, many joint ventures are ultimately bought 
outright by one of the partners after it gains sufficient expertise in the local market.
Second, companies can use joint ventures to penetrate international markets that are other-
wise off-limits. Some governments either require nondomestic companies to share ownership 
with local companies or provide incentives for them to do so. Such requirements are most com-
mon among governments of developing countries. The goal is to improve the competitiveness of 
local companies by having them team up with and learn from international partner(s).
Third, a company can gain access to another company’s international distribution network 
through the use of a joint venture. The joint venture between Caterpillar (www.caterpillar.com) of 
the United States and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (www.mitsubishi.com) of Japan was designed 
to improve the competitiveness of each against a common rival, Komatsu (www.komatsu.com) of 
Japan. While Caterpillar gained access to Mitsubishi’s distribution system in Japan, Mitsubishi 
got access to Caterpillar’s global distribution network—helping it to compete more effectively 
internationally.
Finally, companies form international joint ventures for defensive reasons. Entering a joint 
venture with a local government or government-controlled company gives the government a 
direct stake in the venture’s success. In turn, the local government will be less likely to interfere 
if it means that the venture’s performance will suffer. This strategy can also be used to create a 
more “local” image when feelings of nationalism are running strong in a target country.
DISADvAnTAgES OF jOInT vEnTurES Among its disadvantages, joint venture ownership 
can result in conflict between partners. Conflict is perhaps most common when management is 
shared equally—that is, when each partner supplies top managers in what is commonly known 
as a “50–50 joint venture.” Because neither partner’s managers have the final say on decisions, 
managerial paralysis can result, causing problems such as delays in responding to changing market 
conditions. Conflict can also arise from disagreements over how future investments and profits are 
to be shared. Parties can reduce the likelihood of conflict and indecision by establishing unequal 
ownership, whereby one partner maintains 51 percent ownership of the voting stock and has the 
final say on decisions. A multiparty joint venture (commonly referred to as a consortium) can 
also feature unequal ownership. For example, ownership of a four-party joint venture could be 
distributed 20–20–20–40, with the 40-percent owner having the final say on decisions.
Second, loss of control over a joint venture’s operations can also result when the local 
government is a partner in the joint venture. This situation occurs most often in industries con-
sidered culturally sensitive or important to national security, such as broadcasting, infrastruc-
ture, and defense. Thus, a joint venture’s profitability could suffer because of local government 
motives based on cultural preservation or security.
Strategic Alliances
Sometimes companies who are willing to cooperate with one another do not want to go so far 
as to create a separate, jointly owned company. A relationship whereby two or more entities 
cooperate (but do not form a separate company) to achieve the strategic goals of each is called a 
strategic alliance. Similar to joint ventures, strategic alliances can be formed for relatively short 
periods or for many years, depending on the goals of the participants. Strategic alliances can be 
established between a company and its suppliers, its buyers, and even its competitors. In forming 
such alliances, sometimes each partner purchases a portion of the other’s stock. In this way, each 
company has a direct stake in its partner’s future performance. This decreases the likelihood that 
one partner will try to take advantage of the other.
ADvAnTAgES OF STrATEgIC ALLIAnCES Strategic alliances offer several important 
advantages to companies. First, companies use strategic alliances to share the cost of an 
international investment project. For example, many firms are developing new products that 
not only integrate the latest technologies but also shorten the life spans of existing products. In 
turn, the shorter life span is reducing the number of years during which a company can recoup

more entities cooperate (but do 
not form a separate company) to 
achieve the strategic goals of each.

 
Chapter 13 • SeleCting and Managing entry ModeS  367
its investment. Thus, many companies are cooperating to share the costs of developing new 
products. For example, Toshiba (www.toshiba.com) of Japan, Siemens (www.siemens.com) of 
Germany, and IBM (www.ibm.com) of the United States shared the $1 billion cost of developing 
a facility near Nagoya, Japan, to manufacture small, efficient computer memory chips.
Second, companies use strategic alliances to tap into competitors’ specific strengths. Some alli-
ances formed between Internet portals and technology companies are designed to do just that. For 
example, an Internet portal provides access to a large, global audience through its website, while the 
technology company supplies its know-how in delivering, say, music over the Internet. Meeting the 
goal of the alliance—marketing music over the Web—requires the competencies of both partners.
Finally, companies turn to strategic alliances for many of the same reasons that they turn 
to joint ventures. Some businesses use strategic alliances to gain access to a partner’s channels 
of distribution in a target market. Other firms use them to reduce exposure to the same kinds of 
risks from which joint ventures provide protection.
DISADvAnTAgES OF STrATEgIC ALLIAnCES Perhaps the most important disadvantage of a 
strategic alliance is that it can create a future local or even global competitor. For example, one 
partner might be using the alliance to test a market and prepare the launch of a wholly owned 
subsidiary. By declining to cooperate with others in the area of its core competency, a company 
can reduce the likelihood of creating a competitor that would threaten its main area of business. 
Likewise, a company can insist on contractual clauses that constrain partners from competing 
against it with certain products or in certain geographic regions. Companies are also careful to 
protect special research programs, production techniques, and marketing practices that are not 
committed to the alliance. Naturally, managers must weigh the potential for encouraging new 
competition against the benefits of international cooperation.
As in the case of joint ventures, conflict can arise and eventually undermine cooperation. 
Alliance contracts are drawn up to cover as many contingencies as possible, but communication 
and cultural differences can still arise. When serious problems crop up, dissolution of the alli-
ance may be the only option.

Strategic Factors in Selecting an Entry Mode
The choice of entry mode has many important strategic implications for a company’s future 
operations.6 Because enormous investments in time and money can go into determining an entry 
mode, the choice must be made carefully. Let’s now examine several key factors that influence a 
company’s international entry mode selection.
Selecting partners for Cooperation
Every company’s goals and strategies are influenced by both its competitive strengths and the 
challenges it faces in the marketplace. Because the goals and strategies of any two companies 
are never exactly alike, cooperation can be difficult. Moreover, ventures and alliances often last 
many years, perhaps indefinitely. Therefore, partner selection is a crucial ingredient for success.

368  
part 5 • international BuSineSS ManageMent
Every partner must be firmly committed to the goals of the venture or agreement. Many 
companies engage in cooperative forms of business, but the reasons behind each party’s par-
ticipation are never identical. Sometimes, a company stops contributing to a venture once it 
achieves its own objectives. Detailing the precise duties and contributions of each party through 
prior negotiations can go a long way toward ensuring continued cooperation.
Although the importance of locating a trustworthy partner seems obvious, partners should 
be selected cautiously. Companies can have hidden agendas. Sometimes they try to acquire 
more from cooperation than their partners realize. If a hidden agenda is discovered, trust can 
break down and virtually destroy an agreement. Trust is so important that firms naturally prefer 
to partner with firms that they have had a favorable experience with in the past. However, such 
arrangements are much easier for large multinational corporations than for small and medium-
sized companies with little international experience and few international contacts.
In an international arrangement, each party’s managers must be comfortable working with 
people of other cultures and with traveling to (even perhaps living in) other cultures. As a result, 
cooperation will go more smoothly and the transition in work life and personal life will be easier 
for managers. Each partner’s managers should also be comfortable working with, and within, 
one another’s corporate culture. For example, although some companies encourage the partici-
pation of subordinates in decision making, others do not. Such differences often reflect differ-
ences in national culture, and when managers possess cultural understanding, adjustment and 
cooperation are likely to run more smoothly.
Above all, a suitable partner must have something valuable to offer. Firms should avoid 
cooperation simply because they are approached by another company. Rather, managers must be 
certain that they are getting a fair return on their efforts. And they should evaluate the benefits 
of a potential international arrangement just as they would any other investment opportunity. 
For some key considerations in negotiating international agreements, see the Culture Matters 
feature, titled “Negotiating Market Entry.”
Cultural Environment
As we saw in Chapter 2, the dimensions of culture—values, beliefs, customs, languages, reli-
gions—can differ greatly from one nation to another. In such cases, managers can be less confi-
dent in their ability to manage operations in the host country. They can be concerned about the 
potential not only for communication problems but also for interpersonal difficulties. As a result, 
managers may avoid investment entry modes in favor of exporting or a contractual mode. On 
Global business managers negotiate the terms of many deals. A 
cooperative atmosphere between potential partners depends on 
both parties viewing contract negotiations as a success. Managers 
should be aware of the negotiation process and the roles played 
by culture and other influential factors:
• Stage 1: Preparation Negotiators must have a clear vision 
of what the company wants to achieve. Negotiation will vary 
depending on whether the proposed business arrangement is 
a one-time deal or just the first phase of a lengthy partnership.
• Stage 2: Opening Positions Discussions begin as each side 
states its opening position, which is each side’s most favor-
able terms. Positions might emerge gradually to leave nego-
tiators room to maneuver.
• Stage 3: Hard Bargaining The relative power of each party 
is key in the outcome of negotiations. Direct conflict is likely 
at this stage, and culture plays a role. For example, Chinese 
negotiators will likely try to avoid conflict and may call off 
talks if conflict erupts.
• Stage 4: Agreement and Follow-Up Negotiations reaching 
this stage are a success. Whereas Western negotiators view 
signing contracts as the end of negotiations, most Asian ne-
gotiators see contracts as the start of a flexible relationship.
Two key elements influence international business negotiations:
• Cultural Elements Negotiating styles differ from culture to 
culture. Successful negotiations in Asian cultures mean pro-
tecting the other party from losing face (being embarrassed or 
shamed) and meeting the other party halfway. Yet, negotiators 
in Western cultures typically hope to gain many concessions 
with little concern for embarrassing the other party.
• Political and Legal Elements Negotiators may have political 
motives. A rigid public position might be taken to show the 
company or government officials back home that they are 
working in the company’s or nation’s interest. Also, consumer 
groups and labor unions might lobby government officials to 
ensure that a proposed agreement benefits them.
Culture Matters    Negotiating Market Entry

 
Chapter 13 • SeleCting and Managing entry ModeS  369
the other hand, cultural similarity encourages confidence and thus the likelihood of investment. 
Likewise, the importance of cultural differences diminishes when managers are knowledgeable 
about the culture of the target market.
political and Legal Environments
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, political instability in a target market increases the risk ex-
posure of investments. Significant political differences and levels of instability cause companies 
to avoid large investments and to favor entry modes that shelter assets.
A target market’s legal system also influences the choice of entry mode. Certain import 
regulations, such as high tariffs or low quota limits, can encourage investment. A company that 
produces locally avoids tariffs that increase product cost; it also does not have to worry about 
making it into the market below the quota (if there is one). But low tariffs and high quota limits 
discourage market entry by means of investment. Also, governments may enact laws that ban 
certain types of investment outright. For many years, China had banned wholly owned subsidiar-
ies by non-Chinese companies and required that joint ventures be formed with local partners. 
Finally, if a market is lax in enforcing copyright and patent laws, a company may prefer to use 
investment entry to maintain control over its assets and marketing.
Market Size
The size of a potential market also influences the choice of entry mode. For example, rising 
incomes in a market encourage investment entry modes because investment allows a firm to 
prepare for expanding market demand and to increase its understanding of the target market. 
High domestic demand in China is attracting investment in joint ventures, strategic alliances, 
and wholly owned subsidiaries. On the other hand, if investors believe that a market is likely to 
remain relatively small, better options might include exporting or contractual entry.
production and Shipping Costs
By helping to control total costs, low-cost production and shipping can give a company an 
advantage. Accordingly, setting up production in a market is desirable when the total cost 
of production there is lower than in the home market. Low-cost local production might also 
encourage contractual entry through licensing or franchising. If production costs are suf-
ficiently low, the international production site might even begin supplying other markets, 
including the home country. An additional potential benefit of local production might be 
that managers could observe buyer behavior and modify products to better suit the needs 
of the local market. Lower production costs at home make it more appealing to export to 
international markets.
Companies that produce goods with high shipping costs naturally prefer local production. 
Contractual and investment entry modes are viable options in this case. Alternatively, exporting 
is feasible when products have relatively lower shipping costs. Finally, because they are subject 
to less price competition, products for which there are fewer substitutes or those that are discre-
tionary items can more easily absorb higher shipping and production costs. In this case, export-
ing is a likely selection.
International Experience
Most companies enter the international marketplace through exporting. As companies gain 
international experience, they tend to select entry modes that require deeper involvement. 
But this means businesses must accept greater risk in return for greater control over op-
erations and strategy. Eventually, they may explore the advantages of licensing, franchis-
ing, management contracts, and turnkey projects. After businesses become comfortable in a 
particular market, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and wholly owned subsidiaries become 
viable options.
This evolutionary path of accepting greater risk and control with experience does not hold 
for every company. Whereas some firms remain fixed at one point, others skip several entry 
modes altogether. Advances in technology and transportation are allowing small companies to 
leapfrog several stages at once. These relationships also vary for each company depending on its 
product and the characteristics of home and target markets.

A Final Word
This chapter explained important factors in selecting entry modes and key aspects in their man-
agement. We studied the circumstances under which each entry mode is most appropriate and 
the advantages and disadvantages that each provides. The choice of which entry mode(s) to use 
in entering international markets matches a company’s international strategy. Some companies 
will want to use entry modes that give them tight control over international activities because 
they are pursuing a global strategy. Meanwhile, other companies might not require an entry 
mode with central control because they are pursuing a multinational strategy. The entry mode 
must also align well with an organization’s structure.

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Describe how companies use exporting, importing, and countertrade.
• Exporting can be a low-cost, low-risk way for a company to expand sales, diversify 
sales, or gain international experience.
• A successful export strategy involves (1) identifying a potential market, (2) matching 
needs to abilities, (3) initiating meetings, and (4) committing resources.
• Direct exporting is when a company sells its products directly to buyers in a target 
market. Indirect exporting occurs when a company sells its products to intermediar-
ies who then resell to buyers in a target market.
• Countertrade is selling goods or services that are paid for with other goods or ser-
vices; it can take the form of (1) barter, (2) counterpurchase, (3) offset, (4) switch 
trading, and (5) buyback.
 LO2. Explain the various methods of export/import financing.
• With advance payment an importer pays an exporter for merchandise before it is 
shipped.
• Documentary collection calls for a bank to act as an intermediary without accepting 
financial risk.
• Under a letter of credit, the importer’s bank issues a document stating that the bank 
will pay the exporter when the exporter fulfills the terms of the document.
• Under open account, an exporter ships merchandise and later bills the importer for its 
value.
 LO3. Describe the different types of contractual entry modes.
• Licensing is when a company that owns intangible property (the licensor) grants an-
other firm (the licensee) the right to use that property for a specified period of time.
• Franchising occurs when one company (the franchiser) supplies another (the franchi-
see) with intangible property and other assistance over an extended period.
• A management contract is when one company supplies another with managerial 
expertise for a specific period of time. It can transfer two types of knowledge—the 
specialized knowledge of technical managers and the business-management skills of 
general managers.
• A turnkey (build–operate–transfer) project is when one company designs, constructs, 
and tests a production facility for a client.

 
Chapter 13 • SeleCting and Managing entry ModeS  371
 LO4. Describe the various kinds of investment entry modes.
• A wholly owned subsidiary is entirely owned and controlled by a single company.
• A separate company created and jointly owned by two or more independent entities 
to achieve a common business objective is called a joint venture.
• Joint ventures can involve forward integration (investing in downstream activities), 
backward integration (investing in upstream activities), a buyback joint venture (input 
is provided by and output is absorbed by each partner), and a multistage joint venture 
(downstream integration by one partner and upstream integration by another).
• A strategic alliance is a relationship in which two or more entities cooperate (but do 
not form a separate company).
 LO5. Outline key strategic factors in selecting an entry mode.
• The need for trust and valuable inputs makes careful partner selection crucial to success.
• Managers less confident in their abilities in unfamiliar cultures may avoid investment 
entry modes in favor of exporting or a contractual mode.
• Political differences and instability can cause companies to favor entry modes that 
limit investment and protect assets.
• Producing locally is desirable when total production cost in a market is lower than at 
home and when shipping costs are high.
• Companies tend to first go abroad by exporting and to later select entry modes that 
require deeper involvement.

Ethical Challenge
You are the sales director for a manufacturer in your country and have just received a rather 
large order from a new customer in a new country. Normally, this would be great news, but it 
has filled you with dread. The last time you received an order from this country things went 
really badly. You offered the normal 90 days for payment and at some point the goods (and the 
customer) disappeared after the goods left the port. Although the insurance paid out part of the 
loss, it cost the business US$250,000. It nearly cost you your job. You feel that you might be 
being unfair to this new customer, but your inclination is to demand advance payment in order 
to protect your business and job.
 13-5. What is advance payment and is it usual for it to take place when the two parties have not 
traded with one another before?
 13-6. Why might the buyer be concerned about this arrangement and uncertain as to whether to 
proceed?
 13-7. Suggest how you could protect your company and at the same time not penalize the 
customer.
Teaming Up
This project is designed to introduce you to the complexity of presentations and to help 
 develop your presentation skills.
Background: In groups of three or four choose a type of business, either product- or service-
related, that is common in your own country. You need to choose one that is not usually 
 associated with franchising. Remember that franchising is all about creating a model business 
opportunity that can be replicated and run successfully in another geographical area. In many 
cases, the brand name is very important and part of the attraction to the franchise opportunity. 
Consider how you would describe the type of business, the advantages of using the brand 
name and the way of business, and how it might work in another country. Remember that 
beyond selling a basic package of materials, perhaps products, you are selling an intangible 
product to potential franchisees. You can choose a manufacturing- or a service-based business 
to franchise and you should also be clear about the ongoing support and the kind of payment 
you would expect from a franchisee.
Activity: Break into teams of three or four persons. Give yourselves an hour to frame the 
franchise opportunity and to create some visuals to support your presentation. Once you are 
ready you should then present your franchise opportunity to the rest of the class. What is 
their reaction to the presentation and opportunity; do they think it would work in an overseas 
location? Groups should take it in turns to present their franchise choice and at the end of the 
presentations, the class should vote to indicate which of the presentations was most effective 
and would work best.

Game: Competing in Africa’s Playing Fields
G
ame is one of South Africa’s largest retail stores. It consists of 
93 large-format stores and thinks of itself as a driven  discount 
cash retailer of consumer goods and general merchandise, electri-
cal appliances, and non-perishable items for home, leisure, and 
business use. As a discount cash retailer, Game has a high-volume, 
low-margin operating model that depends on making a high volume 
of sales at a lower price as well as on a sound and consistent promo-
tional strategy.
Game started expanding into Africa in the early 1990s when it 
realized that its South African market would mature quickly and 
that there was little space for investment in the already over-traded 
market. Recognizing the retail market potential of the neighboring 
Southern African countries, Game started investing in Africa by 
opening its first store in Botswana in 1993.
It was only when the company decided to invest further afield, 
specifically in Uganda (2004), Nigeria (2005), Tanzania (2006), 
and Ghana (2007), that the reality of Africa kicked in. The opening 
of the Nigeria store was known to be a bit of a disaster after the 
first container of stock was held up for nine months at the local 
customs office because of Game’s refusal to submit to bribery.
By 2010, Game had a presence in 11 African countries and 
was planning to expand its footprint in Africa in another six coun-
tries over the next five years.
Game had found that it could not simply cut and paste its 
South African business model into other African contexts. The 
company therefore had a separate business plan and business 
model for every country. For example, whereas in South Africa 
every store stocked 12,000 active products, some remote African 
stores such as Game Kampala had only 8,000. This was because 
the logistics of supplying the full range of products was prohibi-
tive and Game realized that the market was satisfied with a slightly 
more limited choice.
Game also had to make a “fundamental mind shift” to think 
smaller when doing business in Africa. Shopping centers were 
an unknown concept in most African countries, so Game opted 
for stand-alone stores in most instances, and in some countries 
it developed its own small shopping centers, consisting of one or 
two anchor shops and a few other outlets. Still, securing financing 
from the local banks proved to be trying, as the bank officials did 
not understand the concept of a shopping mall, having only had to 
finance ventures like roads and bridges in the past.
Regarding the supply chain to the African countries, until 
about three or four years before, all distribution of stock had 
been managed centrally from South Africa. Game’s experience 
in Nigeria changed this. While it was never part of the original 
procurement model, Game decided it was best to turn to local 
suppliers in Nigeria because restrictions on certain imported prod-
ucts meant that even one restricted product could hold a whole 
container back. In other countries, however, Game imported up 
to 90 percent of its stock from South Africa without any major 
difficulties.
Logistical challenges were the order of the day for Game in 
Africa. A large portion of its goods had to be transported by road, 
but getting those goods to certain countries meant that in some 
cases truck drivers had to cross five different borders. The drivers 
therefore had to build up good relations with the various border 
officials to speed up the process, particularly because Game in-
centivized the drivers with bonuses if they were able to deliver the 
goods on time.
By 2010, it had become evident that despite the risks, it was 
indeed very profitable for the company to invest in Africa. Game 
stores in Africa generated far higher profit and return on invest-
ment than their South African counterparts. To date, Game has 
been fortunate not to have had serious competition from interna-
tional players, although the company did face some competition 
from the other South African-based supermarket retailer, Shoprite 
Holdings, as well as the informal market.
However, Game expected a complete change in the African 
business landscape and foresaw that more and more international 
businesses would start realizing the investment potential of Africa. 
The company was fairly convinced that big multinational players 
such as Wal-Mart and Carrefour, which had previously shied away 
from investing in Africa, would form partnerships with existing 
investors in Africa rather than risk going alone.

It’s a Cross-Cultural McWorld!
Singapore, Southeast Asia—In 1979, McDonald’s opened its first outlet in Singapore; 
it sold a record number of hamburgers for any store on its opening day. To cater to its 
Muslim customers, McDonald’s first Singaporean outlet began to serve halal meals that 
ensured that food and beverages were fit for Muslim consumption (e.g., free from pork, 
alcohol, and other restrictions). In fact, in Singapore, Malaysia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, and Syria, 
McDonald’s serves exclusively halal 
meals. Additionally, in Australia, out 
of 700 outlets, only three offer halal 
meals, reflecting how low demand is.
In other countries, McDonald’s has 
to serve different customs. In Israel, for 
instance, McDonald’s is kosher, or fit 
for Jewish consumption, as the meats 
are prepared according to Jewish dietary 
laws and no dairy products are served. 
Furthermore, in 1996, McDonald’s 
opened its first non-beef outlet in India 
because cows are considered sacred by 
Hindus; even the cheese is free from 
rennet, an enzyme obtained from the 
stomach of a calf. Consequently, the 
“Maharaja Mac” was created, using 
mutton patties, and was later replaced 
by the Chicken Maharaja Mac (since chicken is preferred). For vegetarians, there is the 
“McAloo Tikki Burger,” and to respect the sizeable Muslim community in India, pork 
is not offered. But pork and bacon are available in Asian countries such as Thailand 
(e.g., the “Samurai Pork Burger” and “Black Pepper Pork Supreme”), Japan (“McPork 
Burger”), and Hong Kong (“Double Pork Burger” and “Shogun Burger”).
McDonald’s has successfully localized its menu by adapting to the specific dietary 
requirements of different countries. As you read this chapter, notice the different ways 
in which products are modified and marketed in your country and around the world.1

So far throughout this book we have seen that globalization affects industries and products in 
different ways and to varying degrees. Some companies can take advantage of globalization’s ef-
fects and create a single product that is marketed identically around the world. As we saw in this 
chapter’s opening company profile, Red Bull markets an identical energy drink in the same man-
ner in more than 160 countries. The products of other firms, however, require physical changes 
to suit the tastes of consumers abroad. Products of still other companies need different market-
ing campaigns to reflect the unique circumstances of local markets.
Companies that cannot sell the same product abroad as at home must create new products, 
modify promotional campaigns, or adjust their marketing strategies in some other way. Yet, how 
do managers decide when their marketing strategies can remain the same or if they need modifi-
cation? This dilemma is referred to as the standardization-versus-adaptation decision.
In a well-known article, U.S. researcher Theodore Levitt argued that companies should mar-
ket the same products in the same way in all countries because the world is becoming standard-
ized and homogeneous.2 Technology, claimed Levitt, was causing people’s needs and preferences 
to converge throughout the world. He urged companies to reduce production and marketing costs 
by standardizing both the physical features of their products and their strategies for marketing 
them. But standardization is just one of a number of strategies with which firms successfully go 
international and it may not always be the most appropriate strategy. A company may be better off 
adapting its strategy to the local market.
Consumers in different national markets often demand products that reflect their unique 
tastes and preferences. Cultural, political, legal, and economic characteristics have a great deal 
to do with the preferences of both consumers and industrial buyers. Recall from Chapter 2 that 
a culture’s aesthetics involves, among other things, preferences for certain colors. Ohio-based 
Rubbermaid (www.rubbermaid.com) considers aesthetics when it markets its household goods 
internationally. The company offers its products in an assortment of materials (from plastics to 
metal), colors (from white and neutral tones to bright reds and blues), and features (from no lids 
and open tops to lids that seal tightly) depending, in part, on the market in question.
Certain products do appeal to practically all cultures. Although it is not a traditional Asian 
drink, red wine is sweeping across Asia. Driving demand are medical studies reporting the health 
benefits of red wine and the fact that red is considered good luck in many Asian cultures. Many 
Asians now choose red wine at restaurants because of its image as the beverage of choice for 
the sophisticated and successful. Today in Beijing, fashionable young people also give red wine 
as a housewarming present instead of the traditional favorites of their parents and grandparents.
With this brief introduction, let’s now take an in-depth look at issues that are relevant to in-
ternational marketing strategy. In this chapter we describe how marketing internationally differs 
in terms of how companies create their product strategies, promote and advertise a product, de-
cide on a pricing strategy, and design distribution channels. Throughout the chapter, we  examine 
how globalization on one hand and national differences on the other influence international 
marketing activities.
Developing Product Strategies
Marketing activities that span time zones and cultures can test the most seasoned marketing 
managers. When a company decides to “go international,” managers have many options at their 
disposal when it comes to standardizing or adapting their products. Let’s examine some of the 
factors that influence the standardize-versus-adapt decision as well as several other international 
product strategy issues.
Laws and Regulations
Companies must often adapt their products to satisfy laws and regulations in a target market. 
People’s tastes also vary across markets, and taste in chocolate is no exception to the rule. A so-
called Chocolate War has erupted in the European Union (EU) as it tries to standardize member 
countries’ product content regulations. On one side stand the so-called cocoa purists, including 
Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Greece. Opposite 
stand Britain, Denmark, Portugal, Austria, Finland, and Sweden—nations who permit manu-
facturers to add vegetable fats to chocolate products. The purists argue not only that European 

 
Chapter 14 • Developing anD Marketing proDuCts   377
advertising should be restricted to using the word chocolate for 100-percent cocoa products but 
also that the term milk chocolate be outlawed altogether. They want nonpure products labeled 
something like “chocolate with milk and noncocoa vegetable fats.”
The fact that many developing countries have fewer consumer protection laws creates an 
ethical issue for some companies. Ironically, lower levels of education and less buying experi-
ence mean that consumers in developing countries are more likely to need protection. However, 
many governments impose fewer regulations in order to hold down production costs and con-
sumer prices. Unfortunately, this can be an invitation for international distributors to withhold 
full information about products and their potential dangers.
Cultural Differences
Companies also adapt their products to suit local buyers’ product preferences, which are rooted 
in culture. Häagen-Dazs (www.haagendazs.com) is an international company that prides itself on 
its ability to identify the taste preferences of consumers in target markets. It then modifies its base 
product with just the right flavor to make a product that satisfies consumers’ needs. Following 
years of trial and error developing secret formulas and conducting taste tests, Häagen-Dazs finally 
launched its green-tea flavor ice cream throughout Japan. The taste is that of macha tea—an elite 
strain of green tea that has been used in elaborate Japanese ceremonies for centuries. Green-tea 
ice cream was an instant hit and one day may even surpass Häagen-Dazs’ perennial flavor cham-
pion in Japan—vanilla.
Not all companies need to modify their product to the culture; instead, they may need to 
identify a different cultural need that it satisfies. Altoids (www.altoids.com), for example, is 
a British product that has been used for 200 years to soothe upset stomachs. But the company 
identified a different use for its product in the United States. Because of its strong flavor, Altoids 
is sold in the U.S. market as a breath mint and has pushed aside weaker-flavored candies.
Brand and Product Names
Several issues related to a company’s brand name are important concerns for the day-to-day ac-
tivities of international managers. A brand name is the name of one or more items in a product 
line that identifies the source or character of the items. When we see a product labeled with a 
particular brand name, we assign to that product a certain value based on our past experiences 
with that brand. That is why a brand name is central to a product’s personality and the image 
that it presents to buyers. It informs buyers about a product’s source and protects both customer 
and producer from copycat products. Brand names help consumers to select, recommend, or 
reject products. They also function as legal property that owners can protect from trespass by 
competitors.
Indeed, a strong brand can become a company’s most valuable asset and primary source of 
competitive advantage. A consistent worldwide brand image is increasingly important as more 
consumers and businesspeople travel internationally than ever before. An inconsistent brand 
name can confuse existing and potential customers. Although companies normally keep their 
brand names consistent across markets, they can create new product names or modify existing 
ones to suit local preferences.
Companies also need to review the image of their brand from time to time and update it if 
it seems old-fashioned. One classic example is that of Lipton (www.lipton.com). The company 
wanted people to think of Lipton tea as an alternative to colas and other soft drinks. Since the 
1890s, Lipton had as its mascot Sir Thomas J. Lipton, the tea maker’s founder. But in a major over-
haul of the brand, all references to Mr. Lipton were removed because he gave the product a dated 
image—young people thought of Lipton tea as a drink for their parents’ generation. To breathe 
new life into the brand, Lipton booted the founder in favor of “Tom,” a sassy young Briton.
SeLeCTiNg iNTeRNATiONAL BRAND AND PRODuCT NAmeS Whether they are standardized 
or adapted locally, products in international markets need carefully selected names. All company 
and product brand names (like all nouns) are made up of morphemes—semantic elements, or 
language building blocks, such as the van in advantage. NameLab (www.namelab.com) is an 
identity-consulting firm that uses more than 6,000 morphemes to develop new product names. 
NameLab points out that because most Western languages stem from the same linguistic source—
Indo-European—companies can create brand names having similar meanings in these nations.

Accu, for example, connotes accuracy in both Western and Japanese cultures. Thus Honda (www.
honda.com) named its upscale car division Acura. Other names that are constructed to have similar 
connotations in many languages or to embody no cultural bias include Compaq (www.compaq.com), 
Kodak (www.kodak.com), and Sony (www.sony.co.jp).3 After they choose a name, companies can 
survey local native speakers about their reactions to it. These techniques help companies reduce the 
likelihood of committing potential marketing blunders.
Brand names seldom offend people in international markets, but product names can be 
highly offensive if they are not carefully researched and selected. Clarks Shoes (www.clarks.
com), a British shoe company, once gave a name to a line of shoes that was offensive to the 
Hindu religious community in Britain. Consequently, the company issued a statement in the 
British press apologizing for naming some of its products with the names of the Hindu Gods 
Vishnu and Krishna and for offending the British Hindu community. In the future, Clarks Shoes 
promised to carry out more extensive marketing research before naming its products.
Other times, product names must be changed, not because they are offensive, but because they 
mislead consumers. Consider the problem faced by the British beverage and chocolate producer 
Cadbury Schweppes (www.cadburyschweppes.com). When Swiss chocolate manufacturers sued 
on the grounds that the public was being misled into thinking that Cadbury’s Swiss Chalet bar was 
genuine Swiss chocolate, the company was forced to withdraw the product from the marketplace. 
A British court confirmed that the name and packaging of the product—the “Swiss” part of the 
name and the image of a snow-capped Swiss Alp—were likely to mislead consumers.
National image
The value customers obtain from a product is heavily influenced by the image of the country in 
which it is designed, manufactured, or assembled. We consider the influence of a country’s name 
when thinking of Italian shoes, German luxury cars, and Japanese electronics. This image can 
be positive for some products but negative for others. For example, the best Russian caviar and 
vodkas have reputations of quality around the world. But how do you feel about Russian auto-
mobiles or computers? Attaching “Russia” to certain products is beneficial, whereas attaching it 
to others could be detrimental.
Because it affects buyers’ perceptions of quality and reliability, national image is an impor-
tant element of product policy. Yet national image can and does change slowly over long periods 
of time. Decades ago, Japanese products were considered to be of poor quality and rather unreli-
able. A national effort toward quality improvement and the installation of quality-control proce-
dures by companies has earned Japan a national image for precision and quality products. Once 
vehicles for budget-conscious consumers, Japanese cars now include some of the finest-built 
luxury automobiles in the world.
A brand name is central to a 
product’s personality and to 
how buyers perceive it. The 
brands of all types of global 
companies blend into the 
urban surroundings in almost 
every nation. shown here a 
young man rides a moped for

A strong brand is essential for 
a global company whether its 
industry is fast food, delivery 
services, mobile phones, 
financial services, or computer 
software. What are some 
of the reasons why having 
a global brand image is so 
important today?

Likewise, years ago Taiwan was known for basic, no-frills items such as toys and industrial 
products of all sorts. But today, many of Taiwan’s industries possess a reputation for innova-
tion—designing products that reflect decades of investing in people’s research and engineer-
ing skills. One company that benefited from an intense devotion to research and development 
(R&D) is Taiwanese bicycle manufacturer Giant (www.giant-bicycles.com). The company 
began in Taichung, Taiwan, nearly three decades ago producing bikes under the brand names 
of other companies. But when the company began to manufacture under its own brand name, it 
carved itself a solid niche in the mountain bike market. Giant’s innovation in using lightweight 
materials and creating groundbreaking designs even earned it sponsorship of Spain’s world-
champion racing team. Today, high-tech products—and even those not traditionally thought of 
as high tech (such as bikes)—stamped “Made in Taiwan” command respect in global markets.

Counterfeit goods and Black markets
In Chapter 3 we discussed how companies are trying to protect their intellectual property and 
trademarks from counterfeit goods. Recall that counterfeit goods are imitation products passed 
off as legitimate trademarks, patents, or copyrighted works—products that normally enjoy legal 
protection. Because developing nations often are weakest in enforcing such legal protections, they 
normally have the most active counterfeiting markets. Countries that top the list for the portion of 
their markets comprised of counterfeits include China, India, Russia, Thailand, and Turkey.
Counterfeiting is common among highly visible brand-name consumer goods, including 
watches, perfumes, clothing, movies, music, and computer software. Counterfeit products are 
typically sold to consumers on what is called the black market—a marketplace of underground 
transactions that typically appears because a product is either illegal (such as counterfeits) or 
tightly regulated. Tabletop vendors working the back streets of the world’s largest cities repre-
sent the retail side of the black market. For example, in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, you can 
buy one CD-ROM that contains 50 software applications for $10; buying all the official versions 
of these products would cost about $5,000. In Estonia’s Kadaka flea market, you can find the 
full Microsoft Office (www.microsoft.com) software bundle for around $18—about one-fiftieth 
of its official selling price. Increasingly, engineered industrial components such as aircraft parts, 
medicines, and other pharmaceutical products are also becoming targets of counterfeiters.
Counterfeit goods can damage buyers’ image of a brand when the counterfeits are of infe-
rior quality—which is nearly always the case. Buyers who purchase an item bearing a com-
pany’s brand name expect a certain level of craftsmanship and, therefore, satisfaction. But when 
the product fails to deliver on the expectations, the buyers are dissatisfied, and the company’s 
reputation is tarnished. Japanese motorcycle manufacturers recently saw their sales in China fall 
sharply, because people were buying near-replicas of their products at discounts of up to 40 per-
cent of the originals. But the counterfeiting problem is more serious today because the Chinese 
producers are now exporting their cycles to other Asian nations. Yamaha (www.yamaha-motor.
com), Japan’s second-largest motorcycle producer, is considering legal action against one 
Chinese company. Yamaha officials say that the Chinese company’s products resemble its own 
models right down to the Yamaha name stamped on the side.
Shortened Product Life Cycles
Companies traditionally managed to extend a product’s life by introducing it into different mar-
kets consecutively. They did this by introducing products in industrialized countries and only 
later marketing them in developing and emerging markets. Thus, while a product’s sales are 
declining in one market, they might be growing in another.

Advances in telecommunications, however, have alerted consumers around the world to 
the latest product introductions. Consequently, consumers in developing and emerging markets 
also demand the latest products and are not happy with receiving what is yesterday’s fad in the 
highly developed nations. Also, the rapid pace with which technological innovation occurs today 
is shortening the life cycles of products. The actions of international companies themselves actu-
ally helped to create this situation. Companies are undertaking new-product development at an 
increasingly rapid pace and are thus shortening the life cycles of their products.

Creating Promotional Strategies
Promotion mix comprises a company’s efforts to reach distribution channels and target customers 
through communications, such as personal selling, advertising, public relations, and direct market-
ing. (For more on distribution channels, see “Designing Distribution Strategies” on pages 386–388.) 
Not surprisingly, promotional activities often receive the greatest attention among marketers be-
cause many people, even professionals, tend to equate marketing with promotion. After we examine 
two general promotional strategies, we discuss the complications that can arise in international 
advertising and communications.
Push and Pull Strategies
There are two general promotional strategies that companies can use to get their marketing mes-
sage across to buyers. Companies can rely completely on just one of these strategies or use them 
in combination. A promotional strategy designed to create buyer demand that will encourage 
distribution channel members to stock a company’s product is called a pull strategy. In other 
words, buyer demand is generated in order to “pull” products through distribution channels to 
end users. Creating consumer demand through direct marketing techniques is a common ex-
ample of a pull strategy. For example, when Procter & Gamble (www.pg.com) encountered dis-
tribution difficulties when trying to introduce Rejoice hair-care products into Asia, the company 
opted to generate grassroots consumer demand. The company hired a fleet of trucks to drive 
through village squares and hand out free trial packages to potential end users.
By contrast, a push strategy is a promotional strategy designed to pressure distribution 
channel members to carry a product and promote it to final users. Manufacturers of products 
commonly sold through department and grocery stores often use a push strategy. For example, 
manufacturer’s sales representatives are constantly calling on Walmart (www.walmart.com) to 
encourage it to stock the manufacturer’s product and give it good visibility. Push strategies are 
also used for office products, including computers and office furniture. A company’s interna-
tional sales force is the key to successfully implementing a push strategy abroad. For insights 
into how companies can better manage their salespeople in other cultures, see the Manager’s 
Briefcase, titled “Managing an International Sales Force.”
Whether the push or pull strategy is most appropriate in a given marketing environment 
depends on several factors:
• Distribution System. Implementing a push strategy can be difficult when distribution 
channel members (such as distributors) wield a great deal of power relative to that of pro-
ducers. It can also be ineffective when distribution channels are lengthy: The more levels of 
intermediaries that there are, the more distribution channel members there are who must be 
convinced to carry a product. In such cases, it might be easier to create buyer demand using 
a pull strategy than to persuade distributors to stock a particular product.
• Access to Mass Media. Developing and emerging markets typically have fewer available 
forms of mass media for use in implementing a pull strategy. Accordingly, it is difficult to

increase consumer awareness of a product and to generate product demand. Many consum-
ers in these markets cannot afford cable or satellite TV, or perhaps even glossy magazines. 
In such cases, advertisers might turn to billboards and radio. At other times, gaining wide 
exposure can be difficult because existing media have only local, as opposed to national, 
reach. For example, Indonesia did not launch its first nationwide TV station until 1994. Yet 
in other situations, advertising certain products on certain media is unlawful. For example, 
companies that enter Canada or the United States cannot use TV or radio to advertise 
 tobacco products.
• Type of Product. A pull strategy is most appropriate when buyers display a great deal of 
brand loyalty toward one particular brand name. In other words, brand-loyal buyers know 
what brand of a product they want before they go shopping. On the other hand, push strate-
gies tend to be appropriate for inexpensive consumer goods characterized by buyers who 
are not brand loyal. Low brand loyalty means that a buyer will go shopping for a product 
not knowing which brand is best, and simply will buy one of those carried by the retailer 
or wholesaler. A push strategy is also suited to industrial products because potential buyers 
usually need to be informed about a product’s special features and benefits.
international Advertising
International advertising differs a great deal from advertising in domestic markets. Managers 
must rely on their knowledge of a market to decide whether an ad is suitable for the company’s 
international promotional efforts. Cultural similarities can mean that ads need only slight modi-
fication for different nations, whereas cultural differences may mean that entirely new ads must 
be created.
Coca-Cola’s (www.cocacola.com) classic experience in creating an ad to appeal to the 
people of China illustrates the problems that can arise when developing specialized ads. Coca-
Cola’s desire to create a Coke ad that looked authentically Chinese drew a commercial crew to 
Harbin, a city in northeast China. But during the journey to Harbin the bus carrying the crew that 
Today, companies reap a greater portion of their revenues from 
international sales. How can you become a better global manager 
of your company’s international sales force? Here are some helpful 
hints on improving the effectiveness of your company’s representa-
tives abroad:
• Know the Sales Scene Your company should conduct re-
search before hiring and managing an international sales 
force, then should formulate a targeted sales strategy and 
empower your sales force to meet their performance tar-
gets. The amount of compensation, as well as the way in 
which it is delivered, varies from country to country. For 
example, in the United States a greater portion of salary is 
based on commission than it is in Europe. Know the salary 
structure and incentive plans of salespeople with similar 
jobs at local companies.
• Research the Customer Do not assume that customers 
abroad have the same needs and preferences as customers 
at home. Investigate what potential buyers want and how 
much they are willing to pay. When ECA International (a 
market information provider) tried to expand into Asia, it was 
unsuccessful time and again. The company learned through 
its sales force that potential customers wanted to buy re-
search piece by piece rather than buy a membership in the 
company. ECA was able to sell its memberships in Asia after 
it adapted its methods to suit local buyers.
• Work with the Culture John Wada, sales and marketing 
director for cross-cultural management company IOR, ex-
plained that motivating salespeople mean setting attainable 
goals within the context of the local culture. Your company 
should seek answers to a host of questions: Do people in the 
local culture feel differently about work teams and competi-
tion than your sales force at home? How about schedules 
and deadlines? Are you moving into a culture where “time 
is of the essence” or one where time is less important? Your 
company and its local sales force must understand what is 
expected of one another.
• Learn from Your Representatives If your salespeople 
 believe they are pushing products that bear no relationship 
to the local market, their performance will suffer. “I’d do a 
great job,” so the story goes, “but the product just won’t 
sell here.” Salespeople may begin focusing on critiquing 
products rather than selling them. Involve your sales reps in 
the R&D process so that they have a better sense of what is 
 going on with the product. Perhaps bring your sales force 
to the home office to learn about your business so they 
 understand their vital link in your company’s chain of business 
activities. Finally, top managers should visit the local office to 
better comprehend the needs of local customers.

had to trudge around in knee-deep snow first to get a field of frozen red pinwheels to spin and 
then to reorient the whole set so that the wind (which was blowing in an unfavorable direction) 
could spin the pinwheels. But it appears that Coke’s efforts at creating an ad depicting people 
celebrating Chinese New Year in the traditional manner in a picturesque village paid off, as local 
viewers said the ad touched them emotionally. The localized ads exemplify Coke’s “think local, 
act local” mantra, which was pioneered by Chairman Douglas Daft as part of an effort to remake 
Coke into the nimble marketer it once was.4
Let’s now explore some of the factors involved in the decision of whether to standardize or 
adapt advertisements.
STANDARDiziNg OR ADAPTiNg ADveRTiSemeNTS The vast majority of advertising that 
occurs in any one nation is produced solely for that domestic audience. But companies that 
advertise in multiple markets must determine the aspects of the advertising campaign that can 
be standardized across markets and those that cannot. Companies that do market their products 
across national boundaries try to contain costs by standardizing as many aspects of their 
campaigns as possible. However, companies seldom standardize all aspects of their international 
promotions for a variety of reasons, including differences in culture and laws.
Firms that standardize advertising often control campaigns from the home office. This 
policy helps them to project consistent brand images and promotional messages across all mar-
kets—the aim of a global strategy (see Chapter 11). Companies can achieve consistency by stan-
dardizing their basic promotional message, creative concepts, graphics, and information content. 
After a company decides to pursue a global marketing strategy, it naturally tries to get the most 
for its advertising expenditure.
One way companies can reach a global audience is to sponsor global sporting events, such 
as the Olympics, World Cup Soccer, and Formula One automobile racing. These types of events 
receive heavy media coverage and are often telecast simultaneously in multiple nations. Even 
posting banners around the venues of such events can boost recognition of a company’s brand 
name by exposing it to perhaps millions of viewers around the world. Viewers in 102 countries 
see the banners of companies that sponsor Formula One automobile racing.

CASe: The eLuSive euRO-CONSumeR The continuing integration of nations belonging to 
the European Union is causing many marketers to dream of a day when they can standardize 
their advertising to appeal to a so-called Euro-consumer. But the Euro-consumer remains a rare, 
mythical creature that eludes even the world’s most clever advertisers.
Some well-known international advertising agencies have tried a pan-European advertising 
approach only to fail because of national differences. Consider the experience of the acclaimed 
Leo Burnett Company (www.leoburnett.com) when it took on the goal of creating a single 
European campaign for United Distillers’ Johnnie Walker (www.johnniewalker.com) whiskey. 
It took many painful tests and revisions before the ad could be rolled out. In the original ad, 
the tag line read “The Water of Life” and showed a man attending “the running of the bulls” in 
Pamplona, Spain. After narrowly escaping being trampled by the bull, the man celebrates with a 
glass of Johnnie Walker Red Label. But in many countries, the Pamplona setting raised hackles 
because people said, “The Spanish don’t know anything about making good whiskey.” Tests of 
the ad in Germany showed it would not work because to Germans it seemed simply reckless—
not a widely admired trait there. Jenny Vaughn, worldwide brand director for Johnnie Walker, 
explained that in Germany a bull run was out of the question because a goldfish can’t even be 
shown in a fish bowl on German television. The tagline “Water of Life” was baffling or sent 
the wrong message in many languages so the line was changed to “Taste Life.” Then a voice-
over in the ad was incorrectly translated in one language as “when your life flashes in front of 
you, make sure it’s worth watching.” In every market, either the words didn’t make sense or the 
meaning was lost. In Italy, the line was totally discarded. In Germany, attempts at translation 
proved so maddening that the line was replaced with “Live every day as if it were your last.”
Europe’s many languages certainly create thorny translation issues for marketers. Thus, the 
most successful pan-European ads are those that contain a great deal of visuals, have few written 
or spoken words, and focus on the product and consumer. One such ad is that for TAG Heuer 
(www.tagheuer.com) watches, which positions the company’s product as competitive and a win-
ner. In the ad, a swimmer is shown racing a shark and a hurdler is shown leaping an oversize 
razor blade. The highly visual ad gets across the company’s message that it is a winner.
Blending Product and Promotional Strategies
When companies extend their marketing efforts internationally, they develop communication 
strategies that blend product and promotional strategies.5 A company’s communication strategy 
for a particular market takes into account the nature of the product being marketed and the pro-
motion mix to market it. After we discuss the marketing communication process, we examine 
five product/promotional methods companies use and the appropriate situation for each.
COmmuNiCATiNg PROmOTiONAL meSSAgeS The process of sending promotional messages 
about products to target markets is called marketing communication. Communicating the 
benefits of a product can be more difficult in international business than in domestic business 
for several reasons. Marketing internationally usually means translating promotional messages 
from one language into another. Marketers must be knowledgeable of the many cultural nuances 
that can affect how buyers interpret a promotional message. A nation’s laws that govern the 
promotion of products in another country can also force changes in marketing communication.
Marketing communication is typically considered a circular process, as shown in 
Figure 14.1. The company with an idea it wishes to communicate is the source of the commu-
nication. The idea is encoded (translated into images, words, and symbols) into a promotional 
message that the  company is trying to get across. The promotional message is then sent to the 
audience (potential buyers) through various media. Media commonly used by companies to 
communicate their promotional messages include radio, TV, newspapers, magazines, billboards, 
and direct mailings. After the audience receives the message, they decode the message and inter-
pret its meaning. Information in the form of feedback (purchase or nonpurchase) then flows back 
to the source of the message. The decoding process by the audience can be disrupted by the pres-
ence of noise—anything that disrupts the audience’s ability to receive and interpret the promo-
tional message. By ignoring important cultural nuances, companies can inadvertently increase 
the potential for noise that can cloud the audience’s understanding of their promotional message. 
For example, language barriers between the company and potential buyers can create noise if a 
company’s promotional message is translated incorrectly into the local language.

PRODuCT/COmmuNiCATiONS exTeNSiON (DuAL exTeNSiON) This method extends the 
same home-market product and marketing promotion into target markets. Under certain 
conditions, it can be the simplest and most profitable strategy. For example, because of 
a common language and other cultural similarities, companies based in English-speaking 
Canadian provinces can sell the same product with packaging and advertising in the U.S. 
market—provided the product is not required by the U.S. government to carry any special 
statements or warnings. The Canadian companies contain costs by developing a single product 
and one promotional campaign for both markets. Yet it is important for Canadian companies 
not to ignore any subtle cultural differences that could cause confusion in interpreting the 
promotional message.
As the information age continues to knit the world more tightly together, this dual extension 
method will probably grow more popular. Today, consumers in seemingly remote parts of the 
world are rapidly becoming aware of the latest worldwide fads and fashions. But this strategy 
appears to be better suited for certain groups of buyers, including brand-conscious teenagers, 
business executives, and wealthy individuals. The strategy also tends to be better suited for com-
panies that use a global strategy with their products, such as upscale personal items with global 
brand names—examples include Rolex (www.rolex.com) watches, Hermes (www.hermes.
com) scarves and ties, and Chanel (www.chanel.com) perfumes. It can also be appropriate for 
global brands that have mass appeal and that cut across all age groups and social classes—such 
as Canon (www.canon.com), Mars (www.mars.com), and Samsung (www.samsung.com). The 
strategy also is useful to companies that are the low-cost leaders in their industries: One product 
and one promotional message keep costs down.
PRODuCT exTeNSiON/COmmuNiCATiONS ADAPTATiON Under this method, a company 
extends the same product into target markets but alters its promotion. Communications require 
adaptation because the product satisfies a different need, serves a different function, or appeals 
to a different type of buyer. Companies can adjust their marketing communication to inform 
potential buyers that the product either satisfies their needs or serves a distinct function. This 
approach helps companies contain costs because the good itself requires no alteration. Altering 
communications can be expensive, however, especially when cultural differences among 
target markets are significant. Filming altered ads with local actors and on location can add 
significantly to promotional costs.
One company that changes its promotional message for international markets is the Japanese 
retailer Muji (www.muji.net). Muji offers a wide variety of goods, including writing materials, 
clothing, and home furnishings inspired by a central theme rooted in centuries of Japanese 
culture—the simplicity of everyday life. Muji’s philosophy is one of selling unbranded quality 
goods, and reflects the company’s goal of producing functional Japanese minimalist products 
for the masses. Its target market in Japan is the average school-aged child and young adult. But 
Muji’s European stores use a different promotional message. Muji’s European customers tend

to be older and see themselves as sophisticated and stylish buyers of the company’s products. In 
Europe, Muji’s promotional message focuses on the respectability of its brand name—clearly 
different from its message in Japan. Also, the company’s European customers are not simply 
buying a product (as do its Japanese customers); they are buying into the traditional Japanese 
concept of simplicity.6
Low economic development can require that communications be adapted to suit local con-
ditions. In developing countries (such as rural parts of India and China), TV and radio coverage 
are limited, and development of the Web is years behind that of developed nations. Marketers 
in those countries must use alternative techniques, including door-to-door personal selling and 
regional product shows or fairs.
On the other hand, companies in Europe and North America and certain Asian countries can 
rely on a modern telecommunications system to reach millions of consumers through TV, radio, 
and the World Wide Web. In these markets it is common for companies to adapt their websites to 
each national market. To read about how a business can tailor a website to suit local culture, see 
this chapter’s Culture Matters feature, titled “Localizing Websites.”
PRODuCT ADAPTATiON/COmmuNiCATiONS exTeNSiON Using this method, a company 
adapts its product to the requirements of the international market while retaining the product’s 
original marketing communication. There are many reasons why companies need to adapt their 
products. One might be to meet legal requirements in the local market. Moreover, governments 
can require that firms use a certain amount of local materials, labor, or some other resource 
in their local production process. If the exact same materials or components are not available 
locally, the result can be a modified product.
This method can be costly because appropriately modifying a product to suit the needs of 
local buyers often means the company must invest in production facilities in the local market. If 
each national market requires its own production facility, cost savings provided by economies of 
scale in production can be elusive. Still, a company can implement this strategy successfully if it 
sells a differentiated product for which it can charge a higher price to offset the greater produc-
tion costs.
PRODuCT/COmmuNiCATiONS ADAPTATiON (DuAL ADAPTATiON) This method adapts both 
the product and its marketing communication to suit the target market. The product itself is 
adapted to match the needs or preferences of local buyers. The promotional message is adapted 
to explain how the product meets those needs and preferences. Because both production and 
When going global with an Internet presence, the best strategy 
may be to localize as much as possible. Online customers often 
want an experience that corresponds to their cultural context off-
line. Here are a few tips for perfecting an online presence:
• Choosing Colors A black-and-white website is fine for many 
countries, but in Asia visitors may think you are inviting them 
to a funeral. In Japan and across Europe, websites in pastel 
color schemes often work best.
• Selecting Numbers Many Chinese-speaking cultures con-
sider the number 4 unlucky, although 8 and 9 symbolize pros-
perity. Be careful that your web address and phone numbers 
do not send the wrong signal.
• Watching the Clock If marketing to countries that use the 
24-hour clock, adjust times stated on the site so it reads, 
“Call between 9:00 and 17:00,” instead of “Call between 
9 a.m. and 5 p.m.”
• Avoiding Slang English in Britain is different from that in 
the United States, Spanish in Spain is different from that 
in Mexico, and French in France is different from that in 
Quebec. Avoid slang to lessen the potential negative impact 
of such differences.
• Waving the Flag Using national flags as symbols for buttons 
that access different language versions of your site should be 
done carefully. Mexican visitors to your site may be put off by 
a Spanish flag to signify the site’s Spanish-language version, 
for example.
• Doing the Math Provide conversions into local currencies 
for buyer convenience. For online ordering, be sure your site 
calculates any shipping costs, tax rates, tariffs, and so on. 
Also allow enough blanks on the order form to accommodate 
longer international addresses.
• Getting Feedback Finally, talk with customers to learn what 
they want to accomplish on your website. Then, thoroughly 
test the site to ensure that it functions properly.

marketing efforts must be altered, this strategy can be expensive; therefore, it is not very 
common. It can be implemented successfully, however, if a sufficiently large and profitable 
market segment exists.
PRODuCT iNveNTiON This method requires that an entirely new product be developed for 
the target market. Product invention is often necessary when many important differences exist 
between the home and target markets. One reason for product invention is that local buyers 
cannot afford a company’s current product because of low purchasing power. For example, 
Honda (www.honda.com) developed a car called the City for budget-conscious buyers in 
Southeast Asia and Europe.
Product inventions can also arise because of a lack of adequate infrastructure needed to 
operate certain products. One day, London inventor Trevor Baylis was watching a TV documen-
tary on the difficulty of educating Africans about AIDS because much of the continent did not 
have the electricity infrastructure or batteries to operate radios. Baylis set to work and developed 
the Freeplay windup radio—30 seconds of cranking keeps it going for 40 minutes. Baylis and 
several South African businessmen then formed a company called Bay-Gen Power Corporation 
in Cape Town, South Africa. The radio was first sold only to relief agencies working in develop-
ing nations. But due mostly to word of mouth, it is now popular worldwide among hikers, envi-
ronmentalists, and even hip shoppers looking for eco-friendly appliances.

Designing Distribution Strategies
Planning, implementing, and controlling the physical flow of a product from its point of origin to 
its point of consumption is called distribution. The physical path that a product follows on its way 
to customers is called a distribution channel. Companies along this channel that work together in 
delivering products to customers are called channel members or intermediaries. Bear in mind that 
manufacturers of goods are not the only producers who need distribution channels. Service provid-
ers, such as consulting companies, health-care organizations, and news services, also need distribu-
tion (or delivery) systems to reach their customers. In the business of delivering news services over 
the World Wide Web, channel members involved in getting news from the newsroom to the reader 
can include, among others, Internet service providers and search engine suppliers.
Companies develop their international distribution strategies based on two related deci-
sions: (1) how to get goods into a country and (2) how to distribute goods within a country. We 
presented the different ways companies get their products into countries in Chapter 13. Here we 
focus on distribution strategies within countries.
Designing Distribution Channels
Managers consider two overriding concerns when establishing channels of distribution: (1) the 
amount of market exposure a product needs and (2) the cost of distributing a product. Let’s take 
a look at each of these concerns.
DegRee OF exPOSuRe In promoting its product to the greatest number of potential customers, 
a marketer must determine the amount of exposure needed. An exclusive channel is one in 
which a manufacturer grants the right to sell its product to only one or a limited number of 
resellers. An exclusive channel gives producers a great deal of control over the sale of their 
product by wholesalers and retailers. It also helps a producer to constrain distributors from 
selling competing brands. In this way, an exclusive channel creates a barrier that makes it

Chapter 14 • Developing anD Marketing proDuCts   387
difficult or impossible for outsiders to penetrate the channel. For example, in most countries 
new-car dealerships reflect exclusive distribution—normally, Mitsubishi dealerships cannot sell 
Toyotas, and General Motors dealers cannot sell Fords.
When a producer wants its product to be made available through as many distribution out-
lets as possible, it prefers to use an intensive channel—one in which a producer grants the right 
to sell its product to many resellers. An intensive channel provides buyers with location conve-
nience because of the large number of outlets through which a product is sold. It does not create 
strong barriers to channel entry for other producers, however. Nor does it provide much control 
over reseller decisions, such as what competing brands to sell.
Large companies whose products are sold through grocery stores and department stores 
typically take an intensive channel approach to distribution. The obstacle for small companies 
that choose an intensive channel approach is gaining shelf space—especially companies with 
lesser-known brands. The increasing global trend toward retailers developing their own private-
label brands (brands created by retailers themselves) exacerbates this problem. In such cases, 
retailers tend to give their own brands prime shelf space and give lesser-known brands poorer 
shelf locations that are up high or near the floor.
ChANNeL LeNgTh AND COST Channel length refers to the number of intermediaries between 
the producer and the buyer. In a zero-level channel—which is also called direct marketing—
producers sell directly to final buyers. A one-level channel places only one intermediary 
between the producer and the buyer. Two intermediaries make up a two-level channel, and 
so forth. In general, the greater the number of intermediaries in a channel, the more costly it 
becomes. This happens because each additional member adds a charge for its services onto the 
product’s total cost. This is an important consideration for companies that sell price-sensitive 
consumer products, such as candy, food, and small household items, which usually compete on 
the basis of price. As we saw in Chapter 11, companies that sell highly differentiated products 
can charge higher prices because of their products’ distinctiveness; therefore, they have fewer 
problems using a channel of several levels.
influence of Product Characteristics
The value of a product relative to its weight and volume is called its value density. Value density 
is an important variable in formulating distribution strategies. As a rule, the lower a product’s 
value density, the more localized the distribution system. Most commodities, including cement, 
iron ore, and crude oil, have low value-density ratios—they’re heavy but not particularly “valu-
able” if gauged in, say, shipping weight per cubic meter. Relative to their values, the cost of 
transporting these goods is high. Consequently, such products are processed or integrated into 
the manufacturing process at points close to their original locations. Products with high value-
density ratios include emeralds, semiconductors, and premium perfumes. Because the cost of 
transporting these products is small relative to their value, they can be processed or manufac-
tured in the optimal location and then shipped to market. Because Johnson & Johnson’s (www.
jnj.com) Vistakon contact lenses have high value density, the company produces and inventories 
its products in one U.S. location and serves the world market from there.
When products need to be modified for local markets, companies can design their distribu-
tion systems accordingly. Caterpillar (www.cat.com) redesigned its distribution system so that it 
doubles as the final component in the company’s production system. Each national market car-
ries a range of optional product components for Caterpillar’s lift trucks. The company ships par-
tially completed lift trucks, along with optional parts, to distribution warehouses in each target 
market. After a buyer decides what options it desires, final assembly takes place. Caterpillar’s 
distribution warehouses now extend the company’s assembly line—allowing the company to 
maintain or improve service at little cost.
Special Distribution Problems
A nation’s distribution system develops over time and reflects its unique cultural, political, legal, and 
economic traditions. Although each nation’s distribution system has its own unique pros and cons, it 
is the negative aspects of distribution that pose the greatest threat to the business activities of inter-
national companies. In some countries, risks arise mostly from the potential for theft and property

damage. In others, it is simply the lack of understanding that creates uncertainty and risk. Let’s take 
a look at two special problems that can affect a company’s international distribution activities.
LACk OF mARkeT uNDeRSTANDiNg Companies can experience a great deal of frustration and 
financial loss simply by not fully understanding the local market in which they operate. In one 
now-classic case, Amway Asia Pacific Ltd., the Asian arm of U.S.-based Amway (www.amway.
com), learned the hard way about the pitfalls of overestimating the knowledge of distributors in 
emerging markets. The company has a worldwide policy of giving distributors a full refund on its 
soaps and cosmetics if the distributor’s customers are dissatisfied—even if the returned containers 
are empty. But the policy had some bizarre results shortly after Amway entered China. Word of 
the guarantee spread quickly. Some distributors repackaged the products in other containers, sold 
them, and took the original containers back to Amway for a refund. Others scoured garbage bins, 
gathering bags full of discarded bottles. In Shanghai, returns were beginning to total $100,000 a 
day. Amway’s Shanghai chief Percy Chin admitted that the firm’s policy was, perhaps, too lax. 
Amway soon changed its refund policy to allow a refund only for bottles at least half full.7
TheFT AND CORRuPTiON A high incidence of theft and corruption can present obstacles to 
distribution. The distribution system in Russia reflects its roughly 75-year experiment with 
communism. When Acer Computers (www.acer.com) decided to sell its computers in Russia, it 
built production facilities in Russia’s stable neighbor, Finland, because the company was leery of 
investing directly in Russia. Acer also considered it too risky to navigate Russia’s archaic distribution 
system on its own. In three years’ time, a highway that serves as a main route to get goods overland 
from Finland to Russia saw 50 Finnish truckers hijacked, 2 drivers killed, and another 2 go missing. 
Acer solved its distribution problem by selling its computers to Russian distributors outside its 
factory in Finland. The Russian distributors, who understood how to negotiate their way through 
Russia’s distribution system, would then deal with any distribution problems in Russia.8

Developing Pricing Strategies
The pricing strategy that a company adopts must match its overall international strategy. The prod-
uct of a company that is the low-cost leader in its industry usually cannot be sold at a premium 
price because it likely has few special features and stresses functionality rather than uniqueness. 
On the other hand, a company that follows a differentiation strategy usually can charge a premium 
price for its product because buyers value the product’s uniqueness. Let’s now examine two pricing 
policies (worldwide pricing and dual pricing) that companies use in international markets and then 
explore the important factors that influence managers’ pricing decisions.
Worldwide Pricing
A pricing policy in which one selling price is established for all international markets is called 
worldwide pricing. In practice, a worldwide pricing policy is very difficult to achieve. First, 
production costs differ from one nation to another. Keeping production costs the same is not 
possible for a company that has production bases within each market it serves. As a result, sell-
ing prices often reflect these different costs of production.
Second, a company that produces in just one location (to maintain an equivalent cost of produc-
tion for every product) cannot guarantee that selling prices will be the same in every target market. 
The cost of exporting to certain markets will likely be higher than the cost of exporting to other 
markets. In addition, distribution costs differ across markets. Where distribution is efficient, selling 
prices might well be lower than in locations where distribution systems are archaic and inefficient.
Third, the purchasing power of local buyers must be taken into account. Managers might 
decide to lower the sales price in a market so that buyers can afford the product and the company 
can gain market share.

is established for all international 
markets.

 
Chapter 14 • Developing anD Marketing proDuCts   389
Finally, fluctuating currency values also must be taken into account. When the value of the 
currency in a country where production takes place rises against a target market’s currency, the 
product will become more expensive in the target market.
Dual Pricing
Because of the problems associated with worldwide pricing, another pricing policy is often 
used in international markets. A pricing policy in which a product has a different selling price 
in export markets than it has in the home market is called dual pricing. When a product has a 
higher selling price in the target market than it does in the home market (or the country where 
production takes place), it is called price escalation. It is commonly the result of the reasons just 
discussed—exporting costs and currency fluctuations.
But sometimes a product’s export price is lower than the price in the home market. Under 
what circumstances does this occur? Some companies determine that domestic market sales are 
intended to cover all product costs (such as expenses related to R&D, administration, and over-
head). They then require exports to cover only the additional costs associated with exporting and 
selling in a target market (such as tariffs). In this sense, exports are considered a sort of “bonus.”
To apply dual pricing successfully in international marketing, a company must be able to 
keep its domestic buyers and international buyers separate. Buyers in one market might cancel 
orders if they discover that they are paying a higher price than are buyers in another market. If 
a company cannot keep its buyers separate when using dual pricing, buyers could potentially 
undermine the policy through arbitrage—buying products where they are sold at lower prices 
and reselling them where they command higher prices. As is often the case, however, the higher 
selling price of a product in an export market often reflects the additional costs of transportation 
to the local market and any trade barriers of the target market, such as tariffs. For arbitrageurs to 
be successful, the profits they earn must be enough to outweigh these additional costs.
Factors That Affect Pricing Decisions
Many factors have an important influence on managers’ pricing decisions. We devote the fol-
lowing discussion to four of the most important—transfer prices, arm’s length pricing, price 
controls, and dumping.
TRANSFeR PRiCeS Prices charged for goods or services transferred among a company and its 
subsidiaries are called transfer prices. It is common for parent companies and their subsidiaries 
to buy from one another. For example, the parent company often licenses technologies to its 
subsidiaries in return for royalties or licensing fees. Subsidiaries prefer this route to buying on 
the open market because they typically receive lower prices. Parent companies then buy finished 
products from subsidiaries at the stated transfer price.
At one time, companies enjoyed a great deal of freedom in setting their transfer prices. 
Subsidiaries in countries with high corporate tax rates would reduce their tax burdens by charg-
ing a low price for their output to other subsidiaries. The subsidiary lowered the taxes that the 
parent company must pay by reducing its profits in the high-tax country. Likewise, subsidiaries 
in countries with low tax rates would charge relatively high prices for their output.
Transfer prices followed a similar pattern based on the tariffs of different nations. 
Subsidiaries in countries that charged relatively high tariffs were charged lower prices to lower 
the cost of the goods in the local market. This pattern of transfer prices helped large corporations 
with many subsidiaries to manage their global tax burden better and to become more price-
competitive in certain markets.
ARm’S LeNgTh PRiCiNg Increased regulation of transfer-pricing practices today is causing 
reduced freedom in manipulating transfer prices. Many governments now regulate internal company 
pricing practices by assigning products approximate transfer prices based on their free-market price. 
Therefore, most international transfers between subsidiaries now occur at a so-called arm’s length 
price—the free-market price that unrelated parties charge one another for a specific product.
Another factor that is increasing the use of arm’s length pricing is pressure on companies to 
be good corporate citizens in each of their target markets. Developing and emerging markets are 
hurt most by lost revenue when international companies manipulate prices to reduce tariffs and 
corporate taxes. They depend on the revenue for building things such as schools, hospitals, and 
infrastructure, including telecommunications systems and shipping ports. These items in turn

ness environment. Indeed, some international companies have even developed codes of conduct 
specifying that transfer prices will follow the principle of arm’s length pricing.
PRiCe CONTROLS Pricing strategies must also consider the potential for government price 
controls—upper or lower limits placed on the prices of products sold within a country. Upper-
limit price controls are designed to provide price stability in an inflationary economy (one in 
which prices are rising). Companies that want to raise prices in a price-controlled economy 
must often apply to government authorities to request permission to do so. Companies with 
good contacts in the government of the target market might be more likely to get a price-control 
exemption. Those unable to obtain an exemption will typically try to lessen the impact of upper-
limit price controls by reducing production costs.
By contrast, lower-limit price controls prohibit the lowering of prices below a certain level. 
Governments sometimes impose lower-limit price controls to help local companies compete 
against the less expensive imports of international companies. Other times, lower-limit price 
controls are designed to ward off price wars that could eliminate the competition and thereby 
give one company a monopoly in the domestic market.
DumPiNg We detailed the practice of dumping in Chapter 6 when discussing government 
involvement in international trade. Recall that dumping occurs when the price of a good is lower 
in export markets than it is in the domestic market. Accusations of dumping are often made 
against competitors from other countries when inexpensive imports flood a nation’s domestic 
market. Although charges of dumping normally result from deliberate efforts to undercut the 
prices of competitors in the domestic market, changes in exchange rates can cause unintentional 
dumping. When a country’s government charges another nation’s producers of dumping a good 
on its market, antidumping tariffs are typically imposed. Such tariffs are designed to punish 
producers in the offending nation by increasing the price of their products to a fairer level.

A Final Word
Despite the academic debate over globalization and the extent to which companies should 
standardize their international marketing activities, many companies continue to adapt to local 
conditions. Sometimes this takes the form of only slightly modifying promotional campaigns; 
at other times it can require the creation of an entirely new product. The causes of alterations 
in promotional aspects of marketing strategy can be cultural, such as language differences. 
They can also be legal, such as requirements to produce locally so as to help ease local unem-
ployment or to spur local industry around the production facility. Other companies are able to 
reap the rewards of standardization and centralized production that can result from the ability 
to sell one product worldwide. In the next chapter, we take an in-depth look at the factors that 
influence the development of production strategies and the types of decisions managers must 
make along the way.

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Describe the factors to consider in developing international product strategies.
• Companies may standardize products in certain categories, but adapt to unique tastes 
and preferences in others for reasons of culture and regulations.
• Companies may keep their brand names consistent across all markets but create new 
product names or modify existing ones to suit local preferences.
• The image of the nation in which a company designs, manufactures, or assembles a 
product can influence buyer perception of quality and reliability.
• Counterfeit goods of inferior quality damage buyers’ image of a brand. Shortened 
product life cycles affect decisions of when to market internationally.
 LO2. Outline the international promotional strategies and methods available to firms.
• A pull strategy creates buyer demand that encourages channel members to stock a prod-
uct, whereas a push strategy pressures channel members to carry and promote a product.
• Product/communications extension (dual extension): same product and promotion 
abroad.
• Product extension/communications adaptation: same product but altered promotion 
abroad.
• Product adaptation/communications extension: adapted product but original promo-
tion abroad.
• Product/communications adaptation (dual adaptation): adapted product and promo-
tion abroad.
• Product invention: entirely new product and new promotion abroad.
 LO3. Explain the factors to consider when designing international distribution strategies.
• An exclusive channel grants the right to sell a product to one or a limited number of 
resellers. This strategy gives wholesalers and retailers significant control over sales.
• An intensive channel grants the right to sell a product to many resellers, which offers 
less control over reseller decisions.
• Channel length refers to the number of intermediaries between the producer and the 
buyer. Longer channels generally mean higher distribution costs, which may not be 
appropriate for price-sensitive products.
• Special distribution problems that generate uncertainty and risk for successful prod-
uct distribution are a lack of market understanding and the potential for theft and 
corruption.
 LO4. Describe the two main international pricing strategies and factors to consider.
• Worldwide pricing is the strategy of using one selling price for all international mar-
kets and is difficult to achieve in practice.
• Dual pricing means having a different selling price in export markets than in the 
home market.
• Exporting costs and currency fluctuations can cause price escalation, which raises a 
product’s selling price abroad relative to the home market or where it is produced.
• A product’s transfer price, arm’s length price, and price controls can all raise or 
lower its price in international markets.

 Talk About It 1
So far in this book we’ve seen many product markets where global convergence is taking 
place. But we’ve also seen many product markets that are resisting homogenization and are 
retaining their national distinctiveness.
 14-1. Thinking of a product that is moving toward convergence, how will convergence influ-
ence the marketing manager’s job?
 14-2. Thinking of a product that is resisting convergence, what is the cause of the resistance?
 Talk About It 2
Critics of the tobacco industry allege that in developing markets cigarette manufacturers cre-
ate special tobacco blends that contain additives to give an extra “kick.” If true, such practices 
put the “standardization-versus-adaptation” issue in an unusual perspective.
 14-3. If tobacco companies adapt their products in this way, do you think this practice is ethical?
 14-4. Can you think of companies in other industries that change the contents of their products 
to appeal to buyers?
Ethical Challenge Challenges are just another opportunity, or so they say. As the sole distributor in your region 
for a very well-known and successful branded consumer product, you are facing certainly a 
challenge right now, but where’s the opportunity? Sales are great because demand is high due 
to the saturation advertising. The problem is that you are out of stock. It pains you every day 
to turn away dozens of customers. The prospect of new stock is some weeks into the future. 
Meantime, your employees have little to do, your store is virtually empty and cash flow is dry-
ing up. Then, a contact in the same business offers you a solution. He can provide you with the 
stock you need. Sure it has foreign packaging, but you cannot ask him about that. The price is 
great too.
 14-5. They are probably counterfeit or parallel imports. Could they damage your longer term 
business?
 14-6. Is it wise to buy the counterfeits? 
 14-7. Why are some countries far more likely to have a thriving counterfeit market than 
 others? Suggest some likely countries with a major problem.
Teaming Up
In groups of three or four, think about brands that are available around the world. You may have 
travelled and noticed whether brands are cheaper, more expensive, or roughly the same price. Think 
about those brands and consider the following questions and share your answers with the class.
 14-8. What is worldwide pricing? Did you find any examples of these (they are often found in 
retail chains)?
 14-9. What is dual pricing and did you come up with any examples of these? What are the 
 different types?
 14-10. What is and how are transfer prices used by multinational business organizations?

Psychology of Global Marketing
I
t’s no secret that marketers use a good dose of psychology in both 
designing and implementing their promotional campaigns—or at 
least it should not be. But some people, including Gary Rushkin of 
Washington, DC–based Commercial Alert (www.commercialalert 
.org), argue that parents are being duped. He says that parents 
do not realize the sophisticated techniques that marketers can 
use to entice demand. Rushkin’s organization was behind a letter 
signed by 60 U.S. psychologists that was sent to the American 
Psychological Association (www.apa.org) that complained of ad-
vertising methods aimed at children.
What was the cause of their fury? Apparently, it was an article 
by Dr. James McNeal appearing in Marketing Tools magazine that 
described what is called a projective completion test. Suppose a 
children’s TV program is a hit and boys are buying the company’s 
toy that is tied to the program but girls aren’t. To find out why, a 
company assembles a group of girls. They are given a picture of a 
boy and girl watching the program in which the boy is asking the 
girl, “Why do you like watching this program?” The girls’ answers 
help provide clues to how the company can modify its market-
ing strategy to appeal to girls. Dr. McNeal says the method is 
common sense and sound science. Critics argue the opposite and 
say that insights into human psychology should be used for heal-
ing and not for advertising to kids. The American Psychological 
Association admits that there are currently no guidelines for psy-
chologists working in advertising.
Advertising executives are not just busy creating TV ads. Over 
a recent one-year period, the number of children’s websites with 
no advertising dropped from 10 percent down to 2 percent. In what 
forms do the promotions appear? One tool is games. Roughly 55 
percent of all children and teens’ websites feature games. Ellen 
Neuborne told her six-year-old that he could choose a candy at 
the supermarket checkout. With a pack of Sweet Tarts in hand, he 
broke into a little song-and-dance about the sweets. When asked 
if that was from the TV commercial he said that it was from the 
Sweet Tarts Internet game. With the use of such games, companies 
get to spend an extended period of time with kids—far more than 
they get from a TV ad.
Another tool is e-mail. The U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Act 
forbids companies from using e-mail to sell to kids under age 13 
without parental permission. But companies get around the prob-
lem by having kids e-mail each other. For example, children can 
go to the website (www.sesameworkshop.org) and e-mail a greet-
ing card to a friend that features a Sesame Street character. And 
then there are the chat rooms. Brian Rubash is manager for techni-
cal marketing at Tiger electronics (www.tigertoys.com), a division 
of toy-maker Hasbro (www.hasbro.com). He says that he regularly 
signed on to a newsgroup he found on Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) 
to offer product news and to answer questions about the i-Cybie 
robotic dog the company was launching.
European nations have some of the strictest regulations cov-
ering marketing to children. However, nations belonging to the 
European Union (EU) have widely varying rules. For example, 
Greece bans all TV ads for war toys and bans ads for all other toys 
between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. The Dutch-speaking part of Belgium 
bans TV advertising within five minutes of the start and end of 
children’s programs. Sweden bans all ads aimed at children under 
age 12. This means that when kids in Sweden watch the Pokémon 
cartoon series, they do not hear the closing jingle “Gotta catch’em 
all” that plays elsewhere.
But the problem for the Swedes (and others with more restric-
tive bans) is that they can only enforce their laws on programs origi-
nating from within the country. They have no power of enforcement 
over programs broadcast from other nations or from satellite trans-
missions. That is why the Swedes are pushing for a common restric-
tive policy toward advertising aimed at children. Although an out-
right ban like Sweden’s is unlikely, partial bans such as that in place 
in Belgium could be implemented. To forestall stricter EU–wide 
legislation, advertisers could initiate voluntary limits themselves.
Yet, marketers defend their actions. Advertising executive 
Geoffrey Roche of Toronto, Canada, dismissed the idea that psy-
chologists have the power to alter consumers’ minds to any large 
extent, especially not one that is harmful. Dr. Curtis Haugtvedt, 
president of the Society for Consumer Psychology, says that al-
though evidence of the negative aspects of advertising does exist, 
ads can also benefit kids. Haugtvedt also stresses the role of paren-
tal guidance in helping kids to become responsible consumers and 
to not allow them to make such decisions independently.
Thinking globally
 14-13. If you were Stephan Loerke, of the World Federation of 
Advertisers, how would you argue for the EU to not enact 
more strict advertising laws?
 14-14. Do you personally agree with the case you made above?
 14-15. Thinking of a specific product sold in industrialized na-
tions, do you think it could create wants more than it satis-
fies needs if it were marketed in a developing country?

Toyota Races Ahead
KOLIN, Czech Republic—Toyota Motor Corporation (www.toyota-global.com) 
controls around 12 percent of the world car market. Toyota is the ninth-largest company 
in the world, with annual sales of around $256 billion and 339,000 employees.
Toyota has spread its activities across the globe by operating 52 production facilities 
in 27 countries and selling in more than 160 countries. It has 19 design and research and 
development (R&D) centers worldwide 
in countries as dissimilar as Australia, 
Belgium, Japan, Thailand, and the 
United States. Toyota also owns Lexus 
(luxury automobiles), Hino (commer-
cial vehicles), and Daihatsu (compact 
cars).
Shown here, a worker attaches the 
bumper onto a Toyota hybrid at a fac-
tory in Kanegasaki. Most of Toyota’s 
worldwide production operations are 
wholly owned factories, but some 
are cooperative ventures. For exam-
ple, Toyota has a joint venture with 
Peugeot-Citroën in the Czech Republic 
called TPCA that produces 300,000 
cars a year. Production at TPCA is 
devoted equally to each of the three 
cars made there—the Toyota Aygo, the 
Peugeot 107, and the Citroën C1.
Naturally, Toyota undertakes a 
great deal of planning for production 
capacity, where to locate facilities, the 
technology used in production, and the layout of facilities.
As you can imagine, building an automobile plant requires a great deal of money. 
For part of its funding, Toyota looks to capital markets in Japan and abroad. To access 
investors in the U.S. capital markets as a non–U.S. company, however, Toyota must is-
sue what are called American Depository Receipts (ADRs). These ADRs are certificates 
that trade in the United States and that represent a specific number of shares of Toyota’s 
stock. Of course, Toyota also finances its activities with profits earned on vehicle sales. 
As you read this chapter, consider how companies structure their global production 
 facilities and how they finance all of their business activities.1

Whether an international company’s production activity involves manufacturing a product or 
providing a service, it must acquire many resources before beginning operations. Where will 
it get the raw materials or components it needs to perform its production activities? How much 
production capacity is needed? Will the company construct or buy new facilities? How large 
must its service centers be? Where will it get the financial capital it needs? The answers to these 
questions are complex and interrelated.
This chapter begins by examining important issues to consider when formulating interna-
tional production strategies. The topics covered include decisions about whether to centralize 
or decentralize production and whether production will be standardized or adapted to national 
markets. In the process, we draw linkages to earlier discussions, including overall corporate 
strategy and marketing strategy. We then describe how companies acquire the resources they 
need to accomplish their production goals. We explain how firms acquire fixed (or tangible) as-
sets, including production facilities, offices, equipment, and materials. We also consider several 
key production concerns, such as international logistics and total quality management. We then 
explain important factors influencing managers’ decisions about whether to expand or reduce 
operations abroad. We close by taking a brief look at how companies finance their international 
production operations and other activities.
Production Strategy
Production operations are important to achieving a company’s strategy. Careful planning of all 
aspects of production helps companies cut costs (to become low-cost leaders) or design new 
products and product features necessary for a differentiation strategy. Among the important 
strategic issues that managers must consider are planning for production capacity, the location of 
facilities, production processes to be used, and the layout of facilities.
Capacity Planning
The process of assessing a company’s ability to produce enough output to satisfy market demand 
is called capacity planning. Companies must estimate global demand for their products as ac-
curately as possible. If the capacity being used is greater than the expected market demand, a 
company may need to scale back production by perhaps reducing the number of employees or 
work shifts at some facilities. Yet, countries have different laws regulating the ability of employ-
ers to eliminate jobs. So, depending on the country, a firm may or may not need to give advance 
notice of layoffs or plant closings. On the other hand, if market demand is growing, managers 
must determine in which facilities to expand production or whether additional facilities are 
needed to expand capacity. Rather than miss out on potential sales, a company might contract 
with other producers to meet the excess demand until new facilities are up and running.
Capacity planning is also extremely important for service companies. For example, a hotel 
chain moving into a new geographic market must estimate the number of rooms that its facilities 
should contain. It must also determine whether a facility will be used for conventions and the 
like and the number of meeting rooms it must build. Videoconferencing facilities might be added 
if local firms require them to keep in touch with geographically dispersed operations.
Facilities Location Planning
Selecting the location for production facilities is called facilities location planning. Companies 
often have many potential locations around the world from which to choose a site for produc-
tion, R&D, or some other activity. Aspects of the business environment that are important to 
facilities location planning include the cost and availability of labor and management, raw 
materials, component parts, and energy. Other key factors include political stability, the extent 
of regulation and bureaucracy, economic development, and the local culture, including beliefs 
about work and important traditions.
Reducing production costs by taking advantage of lower wages in another country is often 
essential to keeping a company’s products competitively priced. This is especially important 
when the cost of labor contributes greatly to total production costs. But the lower wages of a 
nation’s workforce must be balanced against its potentially lower productivity. Worker produc-
tivity tends to be lower in most developing nations and some emerging markets as compared 
with developed nations.

Chapter 15 • Managing international operations  397
Although most service companies must locate near their customers, they must still consider 
a wide variety of customers’ needs when locating facilities. Are convenience and being located 
in a high-traffic area important to customers? Such a location is clearly important for some com-
panies, including restaurants, banks, and cinemas. For other service businesses, such as consult-
ing companies or public utilities, a convenient location is less important.
Supply issues are also important in location planning. For any one mode of transportation, 
the greater the distance between production facilities and target markets the longer it takes for 
customers to receive shipments. In turn, companies must compensate for delays by maintaining 
larger inventories in target markets—adding to storage and insurance costs. Shipping costs are 
also greater when production occurs away from target markets. Transportation costs are one of 
the driving forces behind the globalization of the steel industry. Shipping costs for steel can run 
$40 to $50 per ton—a significant amount when steel sells for $400 to $500 per ton. By building 
steel mills in countries where their customers are located, steel producers significantly reduce 
their transportation costs.
Automobile makers from Japan and Germany invested in production facilities inside the 
United States for some of the reasons just identified. For example, Toyota (www.toyota.com) 
and other Japanese automobile companies manufacture cars in the United States to offset the 
risks from currency fluctuations, to defuse political concerns about the United States’ trade defi-
cit with Japan, and to be closer to customers. BMW (www.bmw.com) of Germany assembles 
automobiles in the United States for similar reasons. For one, the past strength of Germany’s 
currency made German products more expensive on world markets. Another reason is that 
Germany is home to the world’s highest paid workers—the average hourly income is approxi-
mately $32. Finally, German companies were attracted by the lower cost of land and conces-
sions, including tax breaks offered by state governments eager to attract industry.
LOCATiOn ECOnOmiEs Selecting highly favorable locations often allows a company to achieve 
location economies—economic benefits derived from locating production activities in optimal 
locations. Location economies result from the right mix of the kinds of elements previously 
described. To take advantage of location economies, companies either undertake business activities 
themselves in a particular location or obtain products and services from other companies located 
there. Location economies involve almost any business activity that companies in a particular 
location perform very well, such as R&D or providing advertising services.
The following examples illustrate the extent to which service and manufacturing compa-
nies exploit location economies. One company designed its precision ice hockey equipment in 
location economies

Companies do an enormous 
amount of planning for 
operations when undertaking 
international business. As 
business grows increasingly 
global, supply chains grow 
longer and more complex.

Sweden, obtained financing from Canada, assembled it in Cleveland and Denmark, and marketed 
it in North America and Europe. This equipment incorporated alloys whose molecular structure 
was researched and patented in Delaware and fabricated in Japan. Airplane manufacturer Boeing 
(www.boeing.com) designed aircraft in the state of Washington and Japan,  assembled it in Seattle 
with tail cones made in Canada, special tail sections made in China and Italy, and engines made 
in Great Britain. As a final example, one company’s advertising campaign was conceived in Great 
Britain, filmed in Canada, dubbed in Great Britain, and edited in New York.2
The key fact to remember is that each production activity generates more value in a par-
ticular location than it could generate elsewhere. Productivity is a very important (although not 
the only) factor in determining the value that a location adds to a certain economic activity. Two 
resources—labor and capital—heavily influence the productivity of a location.
Granted, to take advantage of location economies, managers might need to familiarize 
themselves with vastly different customs and traditions. Political and legal differences can force 
firms to retain outside consultants or to train corporate lawyers in local traditions. Language dif-
ferences might mean translating important documents on an ongoing basis. For these reasons, 
companies sometimes hire other companies in a location to perform an activity for them.
CEnTrALizATiOn VErsus DECEnTrALizATiOn An important consideration for production 
managers is whether to centralize or decentralize production facilities. Centralized production 
refers to the concentration of production facilities in one location. With decentralized production, 
facilities are spread over several locations and could even mean having one facility for each 
national business environment in which the company markets its products—a common policy 
for companies that follow a multinational strategy. Companies often centralize production 
facilities in pursuit of low-cost strategies and to take advantage of economies of scale—a typical 
policy for companies that follow a global strategy. By producing large quantities of identical 
products in one location, the companies cut costs by reducing the per-unit cost of production.
Transportation costs and the physical landscape also affect the centralization-versus- 
decentralization decision. Because they usually sell undifferentiated products in all their 
 markets, low-cost competitors generally do not need to locate near their markets in order to stay 
on top of changes in buyer preferences. That is why low-cost producers often choose locations 
with the lowest combined production and transportation costs. But even these firms must bal-
ance the cost of getting inputs into the production process and the cost of getting products to 
markets. Key factors in the physical environment that affect the transport of goods are the avail-
ability of seaports, airports, or other transportation hubs.
Conversely, companies that sell differentiated products may find decentralized production 
the better option. By locating separate facilities near different markets, they remain in close con-
tact with customers and can respond quickly to changing buyer preferences. Closer contact with 
customers also helps firms develop a deeper understanding of buyer behavior in local cultures.
When close cooperation between R&D and manufacturing is essential for effective differen-
tiation, both activities are usually conducted in the same place. Yet, new technologies are giving 
companies more freedom to separate these activities. Today’s rapid speed of communications 
allows a subsidiary and its home office to be large distances from each other.
Process Planning
Deciding on the process that a company will use to create its product is called process planning. 
The particular process to be used is typically determined by a firm’s business-level strategy. For 
example, low-cost strategies normally require large-scale production because producers want 
the cost savings generated by economies of scale. A company that mass-produces snowboards 
for average skiers will typically use a highly automated production process that integrates 
advanced computer technology. Differentiation strategies, however, demand that producers 
provide extra value by offering customers something unique, such as superior quality, added fea-
tures, or special brand images. Companies that handcraft snowboards for professionals will rely 
not on automated production but on skilled craftspeople. The company will design and produce 
each snowboard to suit the habits and special needs of each individual snowboarder. For such a 
company, service is a major component of the production process.
Availability and cost of labor in the local market is crucial to process planning. If labor in 
the host country is relatively cheap, an international company will likely opt for less technology

company will use to create its 
product.

 
Chapter 15 • Managing international operations  399
and for more labor-intensive methods in the production process—depending on its particular 
product and strategy. But again, the availability of labor and the level of wages in the local mar-
ket must be balanced against the productivity of the local workforce.
sTAnDArDizATiOn VErsus ADAPTATiOn Another important issue in production strategy 
is deciding whether the production process will be standardized for all markets or adapted to 
manufacture products modified for different markets. For example, low-cost leadership often 
dictates automated, standardized production in large batches. Large production batches reduce 
the cost of producing each unit, thus offsetting the higher initial investment in automation. And 
production costs are reduced further as employees improve performance by repeating their 
activities and learning new procedures that would, for example, help minimize errors and waste.
But differentiation often demands decentralized facilities designed to improve local respon-
siveness. Because decentralized production facilities produce for one national market or for a 
regional market, they tend to be smaller. This tends to eliminate the potential to take advantage 
of economies of scale and therefore increases per-unit production costs. Similarly, the smaller 
market share that a differentiation strategy targets normally requires relatively smaller-scale 
production. Differentiating a product by incorporating certain features desired by customers 
requires more costly manufacturing processes. R&D costs also tend to be higher for products 
with special product designs, styles, and features.
Facilities Layout Planning
Deciding the spatial arrangement of production processes within production facilities is called 
facilities layout planning. Consider the fact that in Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, the sup-
ply of land is limited and its cost is high. Companies that locate in these markets must use the 
available space wisely by designing compact facilities. Conversely, in countries such as Canada, 
China, and the United States, an abundance of space reduces the cost of building facilities in 
many locations. Because land is cheaper, companies have more flexibility in designing facilities.
More importantly, facility layout depends on the type of production process a company 
uses, which in turn depends on a company’s business-level strategy. For instance, rather than 
producing mass quantities of computers to be stored in inventory, Compaq (www.compaq.
com) competes by manufacturing computers as it receives orders from individual customers. 
To implement this business strategy, Compaq executives decided to replace mass-assembly 
lines with three-person work cells. In production trials at a plant in Scotland, output increased 
23  percent as compared with the previous best assembly line. In addition, output per square foot 
went up 16 percent—a significant increase in the efficiency within the facility.

Acquiring Physical Resources
Before an international company begins operations, it must acquire a number of physical re-
sources. For example, managers must answer questions that include, Will the company make or 
buy the components it needs in the production process? What will be the sources of any required 
raw materials? Will the company acquire facilities and production equipment or build its own? 
In this section, we present the main elements that managers need to consider when answering 
these types of questions.
make-or-Buy Decision
The typical manufacturing company requires a wide range of inputs into its production process. 
These inputs typically enter the production line either as raw materials that require processing or 
as components needing only assembly. Bear in mind, too, that a component may require minor 
adjustments or other minor processing before it goes into production. Deciding whether to make

a component or to buy it from another company is called the make-or-buy decision. Each op-
tion has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.
rEAsOns TO mAkE Vertical integration is the process by which a company extends its 
control over additional stages of production—either inputs or outputs. When a company decides 
to make a product rather than buy it, it engages in “upstream” activities (production activities 
that come before a company’s current business operations). For example, an automobile 
manufacturer that decides to manufacture its own window glass is engaging in a new upstream 
activity.
Lower Costs Above all, companies make products rather than buy them in order to reduce 
total costs. Generally speaking, the manufacturer’s profit is the difference between the 
product’s selling price and its production cost. When a company buys a product, it rewards the 
manufacturer by contributing to the latter’s profit margin. Yet, a company often undertakes in-
house production when it can manufacture a product for less than it must pay another business 
to produce it. Thus, in-house production allows a company to lower its own production costs.
For example, a computer motherboard is the physical foundation of a personal computer 
to which the microprocessor, memory chips, and other components are attached. This critical 
component accounts for about 40 percent of a personal computer’s total cost. Compaq discov-
ered that it could produce motherboards itself for $25 less than its Asian suppliers and save two 
weeks’ shipping time in the process.
Small companies are less likely than large ones to make rather than buy, especially when a 
product requires a large financial investment in equipment and facilities. But this rule of thumb 
might not necessarily hold if the company possesses a proprietary technology or some other 
competitive advantage that is not easily copied.
Greater Control Companies that depend on others for key ingredients or components give 
up a degree of control. Making rather than buying can give managers greater control over raw 
materials, product design, and the production process itself—all of which are important factors 
in product quality. In turn, quality control is especially important when customers are highly 
sensitive to even slight declines in quality or company reputation.
In addition, persuading an outside supplier to make significant modifications to quality 
or features can be difficult. This is especially true if modifications entail investment in costly 
equipment or if they promise to be time-consuming. If just one buyer requests costly product

adaptations or if there is reason to suspect that a buyer will eventually take its business else-
where, a supplier may be reluctant to undertake a costly investment. Unless that buyer purchases 
in large volumes, the cost of the modifications may be too great for the supplier to absorb. In 
such a case, the buyer simply may be unable to obtain the product it wants without manufactur-
ing it in-house. Thus, companies maintain greater control over product design and product fea-
tures if they manufacture components themselves.
Finally, making a product can be a good idea when buying from a supplier means provid-
ing the supplier with a firm’s key technology. Through licensing agreements (see Chapter 13), 
companies often provide suppliers in low-wage countries with the technologies needed to make 
their products. But if a company’s competitive advantage depends on that technology, the licen-
sor could inadvertently be creating a future competitor. When controlling a key technology is 
paramount, it is often better to manufacture in-house.
rEAsOns TO Buy The practice of buying from another company a good or service that is 
part of a company’s value-added activities is called outsourcing. Outsourcing results from 
continuous specialization and technological advancement. For each successive specialization of 
its operations process, a manufacturer requires greater skill and knowledge than it did before. By 
outsourcing, a company can reduce the degree to which it is vertically integrated and the overall 
amount of specialized skills and knowledge that it must possess.
Outsourcing has become extremely popular in the business of computer manufacturing. 
Component makers—including Intel (www.intel.com) in microprocessors, Seagate (www.seagate.
com) in hard drives, U.S. Robotics (www.usr.com) in modems, and Mitsumi (www.mitsumi.com) 
in DVD drives—supply big and small manufacturers worldwide. Computer companies buy compo-
nents from these manufacturers, assemble them in their own facilities, and sell completed  systems 
to consumers and businesses. A related practice in the computer industry is known as “stealth manu-
facturing,” which calls for outsourcing the actual assembly of the computers themselves, plus the 
job of shipping them to distributors and other intermediaries.
A new and interesting type of outsourcing seems to be increasingly popular. The online forum 
called InnoCentive (www.innocentive.com) connects companies and institutions seeking solutions 
to difficult problems using a global network of more than 145,000 creative thinkers. These engi-
neers, scientists, inventors, and businesspeople with expertise in life sciences, engineering, chem-
istry, math, computer science, and entrepreneurship compete to solve some of the world’s toughest 
problems in return for significant financial awards. InnoCentive is open to anyone, is available in 
seven languages, and pays cash awards that range from as little as $2,000 to as much as $1 million.3
Many companies buy when buying is the lower-cost option. When a firm cannot integrate 
vertically by manufacturing a product for less than a supplier can, it will typically outsource. 
Let’s explore some other reasons why companies prefer to buy rather than make.
Lower Risk In earlier chapters, we described many types of risks faced by companies that 
construct and staff facilities in other countries. For example, recall that political risk is quite high 
in certain markets. Social unrest or open conflict can threaten physical facilities, equipment, and 
employee safety.
One way a company can eliminate the exposure of assets to political risk in other countries 
is simply by refusing to invest in plants and equipment abroad. It can instead purchase products 
from international suppliers. This policy also eliminates the need to purchase expensive insur-
ance coverage that is needed when a company undertakes production in an unstable country. 
Yet, this policy will not completely shield the buyer from all potential disruptions—political 
instability can cause delays in the timely receipt of needed parts. Indeed, even under normal cir-
cumstances, the longer delivery times involved in international outsourcing can increase the risk 
that the buyer will not meet its own production schedule.
Greater Flexibility Maintaining sufficient flexibility to respond to market conditions is increasingly 
important for companies everywhere. Making an in-house product that requires large investments 
in equipment and buildings often reduces flexibility. By contrast, companies that source products 
from one or more outside suppliers gain flexibility. In fact, added flexibility is the key factor in a 
fundamental change in attitude toward outsourcing, which many managers now regard as a full-
fledged strategy for change rather than a limited tactical tool for solving immediate problems.
Maintaining flexibility is important when the national business environments of suppliers 
are volatile. Buying from several suppliers, or establishing production facilities in more than one

country, allows a company to outsource products from one location if instability erupts in another. 
The same is true during periods of great volatility in exchange rates. Exchange-rate movements 
can increase or decrease the cost of importing a product from a given country. By buying from 
multiple suppliers located in several countries, a company can maintain the flexibility needed to 
change sources and reduce the risk associated with sudden swings in exchange rates.
Companies also maintain operational flexibility simply by not having to invest in produc-
tion facilities. Unencumbered by investment in costly production equipment and facilities, a firm 
can alter its product line very quickly. This capability is especially important for products with 
small production runs or those with highly uncertain potential. Furthermore, a company can 
obtain financial flexibility if its capital is not locked up in plants and equipment. It can then use 
excess financial capital to pursue other domestic or international opportunities. Outsourcing can 
also free a company from having to invest in R&D and then to earn a return on that investment.
market Power Companies can gain a great deal of power in their relationships with suppliers 
simply by becoming important customers. In fact, sometimes a supplier can become a sort 
of hostage to one particular customer. This situation occurs when a supplier becomes heavily 
dependent on a company that it serves with nearly all of its production capacity. If the main 
buyer suddenly begins outsourcing elsewhere, the supplier will have few other customers 
to whom it can turn. This situation gives the buyer significant control in dictating quality 
improvements, forcing cost reductions, and making special modifications.
Barriers to Buying For various reasons, companies sometimes face obstacles when buying 
products from international suppliers. First, the government of the buyer’s country may impose 
import tariffs designed to improve the nation’s balance of trade. Tariffs can add anywhere from 
15 to 50 percent to the cost of a component that a manufacturer needs from abroad.
Second, the services provided by intermediaries increase the cost of buying abroad. 
Obtaining letters of credit, arranging physical transportation, and obtaining insurance all add 
to the final cost that a manufacturer pays for a product supplied from abroad. Although these 
expenses are currently lower than they have ever been, they can significantly increase total prod-
uct cost. If high enough, they can negate any advantage of buying from an international supplier.

raw materials
Decisions about the selection and acquisition of raw materials are important to many different 
types of manufacturers. The twin issues of quantity and quality drive many of these decisions. 
First, some industries and companies rely almost exclusively on the quantity of locally available 
raw materials. This is most true for companies involved in mining, forestry, and fishing. There 
must be an adequate supply of iron ore, oil, lumber, or fish to justify the large financial invest-
ment required to build processing facilities.
Second, the quality of raw material has a huge influence on the quality of a company’s end 
product. For instance, food-processing companies must examine the quality of the locally grown 
fruit, vegetables, grains, and any other ingredients. Beverage companies must assess the quality 
of the local water supply. Some markets may require large financial investments to build water-
purifying facilities. Elsewhere (such as much of the Middle East), the only local water source 
may be seawater that must be desalinized.
Fixed Assets
Most companies must acquire fixed (tangible) assets—such as production facilities, inventory 
warehouses, retail outlets, and production and office equipment—in the host country. Many 
companies have the option of either (1) acquiring or modifying existing factories or (2) building 
fixed (tangible) assets
company assets such as 
production facilities, inventory 
warehouses, retail outlets, and 
production and office equipment.

 
Chapter 15 • Managing international operations  403
entirely new facilities—called a greenfield investment. Considering either option involves many 
individuals within the company. For example, production managers must verify that an existing 
facility (or an empty lot) is large enough and will suit the company’s facility layout needs. Site-
acquisition experts and legal staff must guarantee that the proposed business activity abides by 
local laws. Public relations staff must work with community leaders to ensure that the company 
does not jeopardize the rights, values, and customs of the local population.
Finally, managers must make sure that the local infrastructure can support the firm’s pro-
posed on-site business operations. Also, factory and office equipment is likely to be available 
locally in most newly industrialized and developed markets, but not in developing markets. 
Thus, managers must assess both the cost in tariffs that will be imposed on imported equipment 
and the cost in time and effort that will be required to import it.

Key Production Concerns
In Chapter 11, we presented how the number and location of manufacturing facilities can affect 
company strategy and organizational structure. At this point, there remain just several issues to 
discuss related to manufacturing operations. In this section, we first examine how companies 
maximize quality and minimize shipping and inventory costs. Then we take a brief look at the 
important reinvestment-versus-divestment decision.
Quality improvement Efforts
Companies strive toward quality improvement for two reasons: costs and customer value. First, 
quality products help keep production costs low because they reduce waste in valuable inputs, 
reduce the cost of retrieving defective products from buyers, and reduce the disposal costs that 
result from defective products. Second, some minimum level of acceptable quality is an aspect 
of nearly every product today. Even companies that produce low-cost products try to maintain or 
improve quality, as long as it does not erode their position in what is typically a price-competitive 
market or market segment. A company that succeeds in combining a low-cost position with a 
high-quality product can gain a tremendous competitive advantage in its market.
Improving quality is also important for a company that provides services—whether as its 
only product or in conjunction with the goods it manufactures and markets. Managing quality in 
services is complicated by the fact that a service is created and consumed at the same time. For 
this reason, the human interaction between the employee who delivers the service and the buyer 
is important to service quality. Still, activities that must be conducted prior to the actual delivery 
of a service are also important. For example, it is important that a restaurant be clean and have 
on hand the ingredients it needs to prepare the meals on its menu. Likewise, a bank can provide 
high-quality service only if employees arrive for work on time and interact professionally with 
customers.
Let’s take a brief look at two movements that inspire the drive toward quality: total quality 
management and International Standards Organization (ISO) 9000 certification.
TOTAL QuALiTy mAnAGEmEnT Company-wide commitment to meet or exceed customer 
expectations through continuous quality improvement efforts and processes is called total 
quality management (TQM). TQM also places a great deal of responsibility on each individual 
to be focused on the quality of his or her own output—regardless of whether the employee’s 
activities are based in the factory, in administration, or in management.
By continuously improving the quality of its products, a company can differentiate itself 
from rivals and attract loyal customers. The TQM philosophy initially took hold in Japan, where 
electronics and automobile firms applied TQM techniques to reduce costs and thereby gain 
significant market share around the world through price competitiveness and a reputation for 
total quality management 
(TQM)

to meet or exceed customer 
expectations through continuous

processes.

part 5 • international Business ManageMents
quality. It was not until U.S. and European companies lost a great deal of market share to their 
Japanese rivals that they embraced TQM principles.
isO 9000 The ISO 9000 is an international certification that companies get when they meet 
the highest quality standards in their industries. Firms in the European Union are leading the 
way in quality certification. But both European and non-European companies alike are working 
toward certification in order to ensure access to the European marketplace. To become certified, 
companies must demonstrate the reliability and soundness of all business processes that affect 
the quality of their products. Many companies also seek ISO 9000 certification because of the 
message of quality that certification sends to prospective customers. For information on how 
companies can blend TQM principles and the drive toward ISO 9000 certification, see the 
Manager’s Briefcase, titled “World-Class Standards.”
shipping and inventory Costs
Shipping costs can have a dramatic effect on the cost of getting materials and components to the 
location of production facilities. When the cost of getting inputs into the production process is 
a large portion of the product’s total cost, producers tend to locate close to the source of those 
inputs. Shipping costs are affected by many elements of a nation’s business environment, such as 
its general level of economic development, including the condition of seaports, airports, roads, 
and rail networks.
It used to be that producers would buy vast quantities of materials or components and 
store them in large warehouses until they were needed in the production process. Storing great 
amounts of inventory for production, however, is costly in terms of insuring them against dam-
age or theft and the rent or purchase price of the warehouse needed to store them.
Because companies have far better uses for the money tied up in such inventory, they devel-
oped better inventory management techniques. A production technique in which inventory is 
kept to a minimum and inputs to the production process arrive exactly when they are needed (or 
just in time) is called just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing. Although the technique was originally 
just-in-time (JIT) 
manufacturing
Production technique in which 
inventory is kept to a minimum 
and inputs to the production 
process arrive exactly when they 
are needed.
In today’s competitive environment, many companies are applying 
TQM principles. For companies doing business internationally, ISO 
9000 certification is becoming increasingly important. But the ISO 
9000 standards do not specify how a company should develop its 
quality processes. Rather, ISO requires each company to define 
and document its own quality processes and show evidence of 
implementing them. The following is a framework describing how 
TQM and ISO 9000 principles can be linked to enhance a com-
pany’s capability for delivering quality products or services.
The main principles of TQM include the following:
• Delight the Customer Companies must strive to be the best 
at what customers consider most important. This can change 
over time, so business owners must be in close touch with 
customers.
• Use People-Based Management Systems, standards, and 
technology cannot, in and of themselves, guarantee qual-
ity. The key is to provide employees with the knowledge of 
what to do and how to do it and to provide feedback on 
performance.
• Provide Continuous Improvement TQM is not a short-
term quick fix but is a continual process. Achieving major 
breakthroughs is less important than smaller, incremental 
improvements.
• Create Management by Fact Quality management and 
improvement requires that managers clearly understand how 
consumers perceive the performance of a company’s goods 
and services. Rather than trusting “gut feelings,” obtain fac-
tual information, and share it with employees.
Companies can link these TQM principles to ISO 9000 standards 
in three ways:
• Process Definition The existing business process must be 
defined. Once defined, it must be satisfying to key stakehold-
ers, and it must “delight the customer.”
• Process Improvement To achieve positive results, everyone 
within the organization should use the defined process prop-
erly; otherwise, a company may need to adjust its policies.
• Process Management Management and employees must 
possess factual knowledge about process details in order to 
manage them properly.

developed in Japan, it quickly spread throughout manufacturing operations worldwide. JIT 
manufacturing drastically reduces the costs associated with large inventories. It also helps 
reduce wasteful expenses because defective materials and components are spotted quickly dur-
ing production. Under traditional systems, defective materials or components were sometimes 
discovered only after being built into finished products.
reinvestment versus Divestment
Companies maintain the current level of operations when no new opportunities are foreseen. 
Yet, changing conditions in the competitive global marketplace often force managers to choose 
between reinvesting in operations and divesting them.
Companies often reinvest profits in markets that require long payback periods as long as 
the long-term outlook is good. This is often the case in developing countries and large emerg-
ing markets. For example, corruption, red tape, distribution problems, and a vague legal system 
present challenges for non-Chinese companies. But because long-term returns on their invest-
ments are expected, Western companies reinvest heavily in China despite what are sometimes 
uncertain short-term profits. Most of these companies invest in production facilities to take 
advantage of a low-cost labor pool and low-cost energy.4
Companies scale back their international operations when it becomes apparent that making 
operations profitable will take longer than expected. Again, China serves as a good example. Some 
companies were lured to China by the possibilities for growth offered by 1.2 billion consumers; 
however, some had to scale back ambitions that had been based on overly optimistic marketing plans.
Companies usually decide to reinvest when a market is experiencing rapid growth. 
Reinvestment can mean either expanding in the market itself or expanding in a location that 
serves the growing market. Investing in expanding markets is often an attractive option because 
potential new customers usually have not yet become loyal to the products of any one company 
or brand. It can be easier and less costly to attract customers in such markets than it is to gain a 
share of markets that are stagnant or contracting.
Yet, problems in the political, social, or economic sphere can force a company either to reduce 
or to eliminate operations altogether. Such problems are usually intertwined with one another. For 
example, in recent years some Western companies pulled their personnel out of Indonesia because 
of intense social unrest stemming directly from a combination of political problems (discontent with 
the nation’s political leadership), economic difficulties, and terrorist attacks.
Finally, companies invest in the operations that offer the best return on their investments. 
That policy often means reducing or divesting operations in some markets, even though they 
may be profitable, in order to invest in more profitable opportunities elsewhere.

Financing Business Operations
Companies need financial resources to pay for a variety of operating expenses and new projects. 
They must buy raw materials and component products for manufacturing and assembly activi-
ties. At certain times, they need large sums of capital, whether for expanding production capac-
ity or entering new geographic markets. But companies also need financing to pay for all sorts of 
activities in addition to those related to production. They must pay for training and development 
programs and compensate workers and managers. Businesses must pay advertising agencies for 
helping the company promote its goods and services. They must also make periodic interest pay-
ments to lenders and perhaps reward stockholders with dividends.

406  
part 5 • international Business ManageMents
But all companies have a limited supply of resources at their disposal to invest in current 
operations or new endeavors. So where do companies obtain needed funds? Generally speaking, 
organizations obtain financial resources through one of three sources:
 1. Borrowing (debt)
 2. Issuing equity (stock ownership)
 3. Internal funding
Borrowing
International companies (like domestic companies) try to get the lowest interest rates possible on 
borrowed funds. However, this objective is more complex on a global scale. Difficulties include 
exchange-rate risk, restrictions on currency convertibility, and restrictions on the international 
flow of capital.
Borrowing locally can be advantageous, especially when the value of the local currency has 
fallen against that of the home country. Suppose a Japanese company borrows from U.S. banks 
for investment in the United States. Let’s say that one year later the U.S. dollar has fallen against 
the Japanese yen—in other words, fewer yen are now needed to buy one dollar. In that case, the 
Japanese company can repay the loan with fewer yen than would have been required if the value 
of the dollar had not fallen.
But companies are not always able to borrow funds locally. Often they are forced to seek 
international sources of capital. This is sometimes the case when a subsidiary is new to the mar-
ket and has not yet built a reputation with local lenders. In such cases, a parent firm can help a 
subsidiary acquire financing through a so-called back-to-back loan—a loan in which a parent 
company deposits money with a host-country bank, which then lends the money to a subsidiary 
located in the host country.
For example, suppose that a Mexican company forms a new subsidiary in the United States 
but that this subsidiary cannot obtain a U.S. bank loan. The Mexican parent company can deposit 
Mexican pesos in the branch of a U.S. bank in Mexico (see Figure 15.1). The U.S. bank’s home 
office then lends dollars to the subsidiary in the United States. The amount of money lent in 
 dollars will be equivalent to the amount of pesos on deposit with the U.S. bank’s Mexican branch. 
When the U.S. subsidiary repays the loan in full, the parent company withdraws its deposit (plus 
any interest earned) from the U.S. bank’s Mexican branch.
issuing Equity
Recall from Chapter 9 that the international equity market consists of all stocks bought and 
sold outside the home country of the issuing company. Companies issue such stock primarily 
to access pools of investors with funds that are unavailable domestically. Yet, getting shares 
listed on another country’s stock exchange can be a complex process. For one thing, complying 
with all the rules and regulations governing the operation of a particular stock exchange costs 
a great deal of time and money. Only large companies, therefore, tend to list shares on multiple 
exchanges.
issuinG AmEriCAn DEPOsiTOry rECEiPTs To maximize international exposure (and to 
access funds), non–U.S. companies often list themselves on U.S. stock exchanges. Non–U.S. 
companies can list shares directly in the United States by issuing American Depository 
Receipts (ADRs)—certificates that trade in the United States and that represent a specific 
number of shares in a non–U.S. company. Large U.S. banks, such as Citibank (www.citibank.
com), issue ADRs that then trade on the New York Stock Exchange (www.nyse.com), the 
computerized National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system (www.
nasdaq.com), and the over-the-counter (OTC) market. As we saw in the company profile at 
the start of this chapter, Japan-based Toyota (www.toyota.co.jp) accesses U.S. investors by 
issuing ADRs.
International companies also make use of Global Depository Receipts (GDRs). These are 
similar in principle to ADRs but are listed and traded in London and Luxembourg. Companies 
from India aggressively issue GDRs to circumvent stringent listing requirements in their home 
market.5

Advantages of ADrs Companies gain several important advantages through ADRs. First, 
investors who buy ADRs pay no currency-conversion fees. By contrast, if a U.S. investor 
were to purchase the shares of a non–U.S. company on another country’s stock exchange, he 
or she would incur the expense of converting currencies. Avoiding such expenses, plus the 
added convenience of paying in dollars, encourages U.S. investors to buy ADRs. Second, 
there are no minimum purchase requirements for ADRs, as there sometimes are for shares of 
a company’s stock.
Third, companies offer ADRs in the United States to appeal to mutual funds. Investment 
laws in the United States limit the amount of money that a mutual fund can invest in the 
shares of companies not registered on U.S. exchanges. U.S. mutual fund managers were 
forced to sell shares of German software producer SAP (www.sap.com) when they appreci-
ated in price. Some fund managers pleaded with SAP America to get ADRs, so SAP com-
plied. Listing ADRs in the United States also allowed the company to reward employees 
with discounted shares of company stock—something that it could not have done otherwise 
because companies are barred from awarding shares in unregistered companies to employees 
in the United States.6
VEnTurE CAPiTAL Another source of equity financing for entrepreneurial start-ups and small 
businesses is venture capital—financing obtained from investors who believe that the borrower 
will experience rapid growth and who receive equity (part ownership) in return. Those who 
supply the venture with the capital it needs are called venture capitalists. Although there is often 
substantial risk associated with new, rapidly expanding enterprises, venture capitalists invest in 
them because they can also generate very large returns on investment.
Venture capitalists with deep pockets now have a global reach. Nevertheless, many small 
companies around the world confront real obstacles when trying to obtaining financing. 
Entrepreneurs in the United States, however, tend to have a relatively easier time financing 
activities and expansion because of a culture that values entrepreneurship. The culture of the 
United States is individual-oriented and rewards individual business risk-taking with financial 
rewards. For some key strategies that entrepreneurs use to find international investors, see the 
Culture Matters feature, titled “Financing Business from Abroad.”

EmErGinG sTOCk mArkETs Naturally, companies from countries with emerging stock 
markets face certain problems. First, emerging stock markets commonly experience extreme 
volatility. An important contributing factor is that investments into emerging stock markets 
are often so-called hot money—money that can be quickly withdrawn in times of crisis. By 
contrast, patient money—foreign direct investment in factories, equipment, and land—cannot 
be pulled out as readily. Large and sudden sell-offs of equity are signs of market volatility that 
characterize many emerging stock markets. Such large sell-offs occur because of uncertainty 
regarding the nation’s future economic growth.
Second, companies that issue equity on their countries’ emerging stock markets are often 
plagued by poor market regulation. This can allow large local companies to wield a great deal of 
influence over their domestic stock markets. As long as powerful domestic shareholders domi-
nate such exchanges, international investors will likely hesitate to enter. The root of the problem 
often lies in regulation that favors insiders over international investors.
internal Funding
Ongoing international business activities and new investments can also be financed internally, 
whether with funds supplied by the parent company or by its international subsidiaries.
inTErnAL EQuiTy, DEBT, AnD FEEs Spin-off companies and new subsidiaries typically 
require a period of time before they become financially independent. During this period, they 
often obtain internal financing from parent companies.
Many international subsidiaries obtain financial capital by issuing equity, which as a rule 
is not publicly traded. In fact, equity is often purchased solely by the parent company, which 
obviously enjoys great influence over the subsidiary’s decisions. If the subsidiary performs 
well, the parent earns a return from the appreciating share price that reflects the increased val-
uation of the company. If the subsidiary decides to pay stock dividends, the parent company 
can also earn a return in this way. Parent companies commonly lend money to international 
subsidiaries during the start-up phase and when subsidiaries undertake large new investments. 
Conversely, subsidiaries with excess cash often lend money to parent or sister companies that 
need capital.
rEVEnuE FrOm OPErATiOns Money earned from the sale of goods and services is 
called revenue. This source of capital is the lifeblood of international companies and their 
subsidiaries. If a company is to succeed in the long term, it must at some point generate 
revenue
Money earned from the sale of 
goods and services.
Small-business financing is becoming more global as national 
economies become interwoven and as technology eases commu-
nication. To simply gain a position in the relatively safe U.S. market, 
for example, an international investor may accept a lower rate of 
return. Here are some tips from entrepreneurs who found interna-
tional capital for their companies:
• Business School International Programs Instructors of inter-
national business courses often have contacts in both educa-
tion and industry abroad. To break into this network, perhaps 
visit your local college and take an executive education 
course or join a program in which you can work closely with 
entrepreneurial advisers.
• Your Country’s Commerce Department Ask about poten-
tial international markets to which your product might be 
appealing. Developing, emerging, and highly developed 
countries all have needs in practically every economic 
sector. Your nation’s commerce department can help in your 
preliminary scouting of opportunities, as can your country’s 
embassies.
• Leverage Your Contacts Tap the professionals with whom 
you work—especially attorneys and accountants with interna-
tional ties. Long before you start pursuing overseas investors, 
consider asking a respected executive with international ex-
perience to serve on your board of directors.
• Industry Events in Other Countries Do this to increase your 
contacts and exposure. Your specific trade association should 
be able to provide you with a schedule of shows taking place 
in other countries.
• Hire an Intermediary to Find Capital These types of inter-
mediaries can help locate funding from international venture-
capital firms, banks, and other lending institutions. They also 
can help expanding businesses get capital from financial 
institutions in other parts of the world.
Culture matters    Financing Business from Abroad

 
Chapter 15 • Managing international operations  409
sufficient internal revenue to sustain day-to-day operations. At that point, outside financing 
is required only to expand operations or to survive lean periods—say, during seasonal sales 
fluctuations.
As we saw in earlier chapters, international companies and their subsidiaries also internally 
generate revenues through so-called transfer prices—prices charged for goods or services trans-
ferred among a company and its subsidiaries. Companies set subsidiaries’ transfer prices high or 
low, according to their own goals. For instance, often companies pursue transfer pricing aggres-
sively when they wish to minimize taxes in a high-taxation country. Transfer pricing can be used 
if there are no national restrictions on the use of foreign exchange or on the repatriation of prof-
its to home countries. Figure 15.2 summarizes the internal sources of capital for international 
companies and their subsidiaries.
Capital structure
The capital structure of a company is the mix of equity, debt, and internally generated funds 
that it uses to finance its activities. Firms try to strike the right balance among financing methods 
to minimize risk and the cost of capital.
Debt requires periodic interest payments to creditors such as banks and bondholders. If the 
company defaults on interest payments, creditors can take the company to court to force it to 
pay—even forcing it into bankruptcy. On the other hand, in the case of equity, only holders of 
certain types of preferred stock (which companies issue sparingly) can force bankruptcy because 
of default. As a rule, then, companies do not want to carry too much debt in relation to equity 
that can increase their risk of insolvency. Debt still appeals to companies in many countries, 
however, because interest payments can be deducted from taxable earnings—thus lowering the 
amount of taxes the firm must pay.
The basic principles of capital structure do not vary from domestic to international companies. 
But research indicates that multinational firms have lower ratios of debt to equity than domestic 
firms. Why is this so? Some observers cite increased political risk, exchange-rate risk, and the 
number of opportunities available to multinational companies as possible explanations for the 
difference. Others suggest that the debt-versus-equity option depends on a company’s national cul-
ture. But this suggestion has come under fire because companies from all cultures want to reduce 
their cost of capital. Moreover, many large international companies generate revenue from a large 
number of countries. How does one determine the “national culture” of these companies?
National restrictions can influence the choice of capital structure. These restrictions include 
limits on the international flows of capital, the cost of local financing versus the cost of interna-
tional financing, access to international financial markets, and controls imposed on the exchange 
of currencies. The choice of capital structure for each of a company’s international subsidiaries—
and, therefore, its own capital structure—is a highly complex decision.

A Final Word
Whether an international company’s production activity involves manufacturing a product or 
providing a service, it must acquire many resources before beginning operations. It needs to 
resolve issues such as where it will get raw materials or components, how much production ca-
pacity it needs, whether to construct or buy new facilities, what the size of its service centers will 
be, and where it will get financing. The answers to these questions are complex and interrelated.
This chapter discussed important issues to consider when formulating international produc-
tion strategies, including planning for production capacity, the location of facilities, production 
processes to be used, and the layout of facilities. We also discussed the decision that companies 
face of whether to centralize or decentralize production and whether production will be stan-
dardized or adapted to national markets. In the process, we saw how production issues are linked 
to earlier discussions of overall corporate strategy and marketing strategy. We closed the chapter 
with a discussion of how companies finance their international production operations and other 
activities.

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Describe the elements to consider when formulating production strategies.
• Capacity planning helps a company to produce enough output to satisfy market 
demand.
• Facilities location planning is at its best when production is placed in an optimal 
location so that it achieves location economies. Also essential here is whether to cen-
tralize or decentralize production.
• Deciding how a company will create its product is called process planning. It is usu-
ally determined by whether a firm uses a low-cost or differentiation strategy, which is 
related to the standardization versus adaptation issue.
• Deciding the spatial arrangement of production processes within facilities, called facili-
ties layout planning, depends on the type of production process a company employs.
 LO2. Outline the issues to consider when acquiring physical resources.
• The make-or-buy decision is a choice for or against greater vertical integration—the 
process of extending control over additional stages of production.
• A firm that chooses to make a particular product or component often does so to take 
advantage of lower costs or to achieve greater control.
• Outsourcing can provide greater flexibility while reducing exposure to exchange-rate 
fluctuations and other risks.
• Key issues facing firms producing locally are the quantity and quality of locally 
available raw materials.
• Companies can either (1) acquire or modify existing factories or (2) build entirely 
new facilities.
 LO3. Identify the key production matters that concern managers.
• Total quality management (TQM) is a company-wide commitment to meet or exceed 
customer expectations through continuous quality improvement efforts and processes.

 
Chapter 15 • Managing international operations  411
• International Standards Organization (ISO) 9000 certification is awarded to firms 
that meet the highest quality standards in their industries.
• Just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing is a technique in which inventory and its cost are 
minimized and inputs to the production process arrive exactly when needed.
• Companies often reinvest in operations when a market is expected to provide a large 
return or when a market is growing rapidly.
• Companies often divest when (1) profitability is delayed; (2) problems arise in the 
political, social, or economic sphere; or (3) other, more profitable opportunities arise.
 LO4. Explain the potential ways to finance business operations.
• In back-to-back loans, parent firms loan money to subsidiaries by depositing money 
in host-country banks.
• Foreign companies can access the U.S. capital market by issuing American 
Depository Receipts (ADRs)—certificates that trade in the United States and that rep-
resent a specific number of shares in a non–U.S. company.
• Venture capital is a source of equity for entrepreneurial start-ups and small 
businesses.
• Parent companies and their subsidiaries can obtain internal funding through (1) a swap-
ping of debt or equity and (2) charging one another royalties and licensing fees.
• Revenue from ongoing operations can help finance company expansion.

Ethical Challenge
You are the CEO of a manufacturing company. You manufacture all the parts needed to make 
a small range of products, but you have lacked investment over the past few years. A new 
contract from a major retailer offers you the opportunity to expand your output, but your pro-
duction manager tells you that the equipment will not be able to cope. In short, you need to 
invest at least half the amount that the whole contract is worth with the retailer. Essentially, 
this would mean your factory would be working for eighteen months just to pay for the new 
machinery. There is another clear and more straightforward alternative. You could buy all of 
the parts from a number of overseas suppliers and convert the factory into an assembly plant 
for a fraction of the cost.
 15-5. Suggest two good reasons why you should still manufacture.
 15-6. What are the implications of taking the outsourcing route instead of manufacturing?
 15-7. Why is outsourcing abroad considered a lower risk option compared to running a manu-

Toyota’s Strategy for Production Efficiency
T
oyota Motor Corporation (www.toyota-global.com) com-
monly appears in most rankings of the world’s most respected 
companies. One reason for Toyota’s strong showing in such rank-
ings is that the company always seems to maintain profitability in 
the face of economic downturns and slack demand. Another rea-
son is that leaders in a wide range of industries have high regard 
for Toyota’s management and production practices.
Toyota first began producing cars in 1937. In the mid-1950s, 
a machinist named Taiichi Ohno began developing a new concept 
of automobile production. Today, the approach known as the 
Toyota Production System (TPS) has been intensely studied and 
widely copied throughout the automobile industry. Ohno, who is 
addressed by fellow employees as sensei (“teacher and master”), 
followed the lead of the family that founded Toyota (spelled 
Toyoda) by exhibiting high regard for company employees. Ohno 
also believed that mass production of automobiles was obsolete 
and that a flexible production system that produced cars according 
to specific customer requests would be superior.
It was at Toyota that the well-known just-in-time approach to 
inventory management was developed and perfected. Implementing 
just-in-time required kanban, a simple system of colored paper 
cards that accompanied the parts as they progressed down the as-
sembly line. Kanban eliminates inventory buildup by quickly tell-
ing the production personnel which parts are being used and which 
are not. The third pillar of the TPS was quality circles, groups of 
workers who discussed ways to improve the work process and 
make better cars. Finally, the entire system was based on jidoka, 
which literally means “automation.” As used at Toyota, however, 
the word expresses management’s faith in the worker as a human 
being and a thinker.
A simple example illustrates the benefits of Toyota’s system. 
Toyota dealerships found that customers kept returning their vehi-
cles with leaking radiator hoses. When a team of workers at the U.S. 
plant where the vehicle was made was asked to help find a solution, 
they found the problem was the clamp on the radiator hose. In as-
sembly, the clamp is put over the hose, a pin on the side is pulled 
out, and the hose is secured. But sometimes the operator would 
forget to pull out the pin. The hose would remain loose and would 
leak. So the team installed a device next to the line that contains a 
funnel and electric eye. If a pin is not tossed into the funnel (passing 
the electric eye) every 60 seconds, the device senses that the opera-
tor must have forgotten to pull the pin and stops the line. As a result, 
a warranty problem at the dealerships was eliminated, customer dis-
satisfaction was reduced, and productivity was increased.
Nearly 50 years after the groundwork for the TPS was first 
laid, the results speak for themselves. Toyota’s superior approach 
to manufacturing has been estimated to yield a cost advantage 
of $600 to $700 per car due to more efficient production, plus 
another $300 savings per car because fewer defects mean less war-
ranty repair work. Ohno’s belief in flexible production can also be 
seen in the fact that Toyota’s Sienna minivan is produced on the 
same assembly line in Georgetown, Kentucky, as the company’s 
Camry models. The Sienna and Camry share the same basic chas-
sis and 50 percent of their parts. Out of 300 different stations on 
the assembly line, Sienna models require different parts at only 
26 stations. Toyota expects to build one Sienna for every three 
Camrys that come off the assembly line.
Thinking Globally
 15-13. Chrysler engineers helped Toyota develop its Sienna 
minivan. In return, Toyota provided input on automobile 
production techniques to Chrysler. Why do you think 
Chrysler was willing to share its minivan know-how with 
a key competitor?
 15-14. Considering financial, marketing, and human resource 
management issues, what other benefits do you think 
Toyota obtains from its production system?

Leaping Cultures
HO CHI MIN CITY, Vietnam—Intel (www.intel.com) created the world’s first 
microprocessor in 1971. Today, annual revenue is $53 billion, around 75 percent of which 
is earned outside the United States. Intel is the world’s largest maker of computer chips 
and is a leading manufacturer of computer, networking, and communications products. 
Shown here, Intel employees pose for a photo at the grand opening of Intel’s assembly 
and test facilities at Saigon Hi-Tech 
Park in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
With nearly 108,000 employees 
worldwide, Intel must deal with many 
issues when managing people. The 
company must answer some impor-
tant questions when selecting people 
to manage each local facility in 62 
countries. Can a qualified manager 
be found locally? If so, what salary 
should Intel pay the local manager? Or 
will a manager need to be sent from 
the United States or from a facility in 
another nation? If so, what should Intel 
pay that individual? Intel’s compensa-
tion and benefits packages vary greatly 
from one country to another because 
of different practices around the world.
There is also the issue of culture. 
Although the depth of cultural knowl-
edge required of various employees differs, Intel wants all its employees to be cultur-
ally astute. Its culture-specific training courses teach employees how business differs 
across cultures. Intel says its training is designed to develop employees’ knowledge, 
awareness, and skills to ensure their effectiveness and productivity. It is also supposed 
to help employees identify strategies for successfully doing business in other countries 
and with people from other countries.
From tech-support reps working long distance with customers abroad to globetrot-
ting executives, many Intel employees regularly rely on their cross-cultural communi-
cation skills. As you read this chapter, consider all the human resource issues that arise 
when international companies manage their employees around the world.1

Perhaps the most important resource of any successful business is the people who comprise it. 
If a company gives its human resource management practices the importance they deserve, it 
can have a profound impact on performance. Highly trained and productive employees who are 
proficient in their duties allow a company to achieve its business goals both domestically and 
internationally. Human resource management (HRM) is the process of staffing a company 
and ensuring that employees are as productive as possible. It requires managers to be effective in 
recruiting, selecting, training, developing, evaluating, and compensating employees and in form-
ing good relationships with them.
International HRM differs considerably from HRM in a domestic setting because of differ-
ences in national business environments. There are concerns over the employment of expatriates— 
citizens of one country who are living and working in another. Companies must deal with many is-
sues when they have expatriate employees on job assignments that could last several years. Some of 
these issues are related to the inconvenience and stress of living in an unfamiliar culture. In the com-
pany profile at the start of this chapter, we saw how Intel enrolls its employees in culture- specific 
training courses to prepare them for doing business internationally.
Training and development programs must often be tailored to local practices. Some coun-
tries, such as Germany and Japan, have extensive vocational-training schools that turn out 
graduates ready to perform their jobs proficiently. Finding well-qualified nonmanagerial work-
ers in those markets is relatively easy. By contrast, developing a production facility in many 
emerging markets requires far more basic training of workers. For example, workers in China 
work hard and tend to be well educated. But because China lacks an advanced vocational train-
ing system like those in Germany and Japan, Chinese workers tend to require more intensive 
on-the-job training. Recruitment and selection practices must also be adapted to the host nation’s 
hiring laws. Hiring practices regarding nondiscrimination among job candidates must be care-
fully monitored so that the company does not violate such laws. And companies that go abroad 
to lower labor expenses must adjust pay scales and advancement criteria to suit local customs.
Because culture is so important to international business, we studied culture early 
(Chapter 2) and returned repeatedly to the topic throughout this book. Culture is also central 
to this final chapter’s discussion of how international companies manage their employees. We 
begin by discussing the different types of human resource staffing policies that international 
companies use. Then, we learn about the important factors that affect recruitment and selection 
practices internationally. We explore the many different types of training and development pro-
grams companies can use to improve the effectiveness of their employees. We also examine the 
compensation policies of international companies. We close the chapter with a discussion of the 
importance of labor–management relations around the world.
International Staffing Policies
The customary means by which a company staffs its offices is called its staffing policy. Staffing 
policy is greatly influenced by the extent of a firm’s international involvement. There are three 
main approaches to the staffing of international business operations: ethnocentric, polycentric, 
and geocentric. Although we discuss each of these approaches as being distinct from one an-
other, companies often blend different aspects of each staffing policy in practice. The result is an 
almost infinite variety of international staffing policies among international companies.
Ethnocentric Staffing
In ethnocentric staffing, individuals from the home country manage operations abroad. This 
policy tends to appeal to companies that want to maintain tight control over decision making 
in branch offices abroad. Accordingly, those companies try to formulate policies designed to 
work in every country in which they operate. But note that firms generally pursue this policy in 
their international operations for top managerial posts—implementing it at lower levels is often 
impractical.
AdvAnTAgES Of EThnOCEnTriC STAffing Firms pursue this policy for several reasons. 
First, locally qualified people are not always available. In developing and newly industrialized 
countries, there is often a shortage of qualified personnel that creates a highly competitive local 
labor market.

Chapter 16 • hiring and Managing eMployees    417
Second, companies use ethnocentric staffing to re-create local operations in the image of 
home-country operations. Especially if they have climbed the corporate ladder in the home 
office, expatriate managers tend to infuse branch offices with the corporate culture. This policy 
is important for companies that need a strong set of shared values among the people in each 
international office—such as firms implementing global strategies. For example, Mihir Doshi 
was born in Bombay, but his family moved to the United States in 1978. Doshi graduated 
from New York University and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1988. In 1995 he became 
executive director of Morgan Stanley’s (www.morganstanley.com) operations in India. He says 
that although he is very American, in India he can adapt to being Indian. Meanwhile, Morgan 
Stanley gets somebody who can instill the company culture in India.2
By the same token, a system of shared values is important when a company’s international 
units are highly interdependent. For instance, fashioning branch operations in the image of 
home-office operations can also ease the transfer of special know-how. This advantage is partic-
ularly valuable when that know-how is rooted in the expertise and experience of home-country 
managers.
Finally, some companies feel that managers sent from the home country will look out for 
the company’s interests more earnestly than will host-country natives. Japanese companies 
are notorious for their reluctance to place non-Japanese managers at the helm of international 
offices. And when they do appoint a foreigner, they often place a Japanese manager in the office 
to monitor important decisions and report back to the home office. Companies that operate in 
highly nationalistic markets and those worried about industrial espionage also typically find an 
ethnocentric approach appealing.
diSAdvAnTAgES Of EThnOCEnTriC STAffing Despite its advantages, ethnocentric staffing 
has its negative aspects. First, relocating managers from the home country is expensive. The 
bonuses that managers often receive for relocating plus relocation expenses for entire families 
can increase the cost of a manager several times over. Likewise, the pressure of cultural 
differences and long periods away from relatives and friends can contribute to the failure of 
managers on international assignments.
Second, an ethnocentric policy can create barriers for the host-country office. The pres-
ence of home-country managers in the host country might encourage a “foreign” image of the 
business. Lower-level employees might feel that managers do not really understand their needs 
because they come from another culture. Occasionally they are right: Expatriate managers 
sometimes fail to integrate themselves into the local culture. And if they fail to overcome cul-
tural barriers, they typically fail to understand the needs of their local employees and those of 
their local customers.
sending an expatriate 
manager to another country 
to run things can send the 
wrong message to local 
employees. eBay (www.ebay.
com) hired Mr. Muralikrishnan, 
shown here, to be its country 
manager in india. eBay is

Polycentric Staffing
In polycentric staffing, individuals from the host country manage operations abroad. 
Companies can implement a polycentric approach for top- and mid-level managers, for 
lower-level staff, or for nonmanagerial workers. It is well suited to companies who want to 
give national units a degree of autonomy in decision making. This policy does not mean that 
host-country managers are left to run operations in any way they see fit. Large international 
companies usually conduct extensive training programs in which host-country managers visit 
home offices for extended periods. This exposes them to the company’s culture and specific 
business practices. Small and medium-sized companies can find this policy expensive, but be-
ing able to depend on local managers who fully understand what is expected of them can far 
outweigh any costs.
AdvAnTAgES And diSAdvAnTAgES Of POLyCEnTriC STAffing Polycentric staffing 
places managerial responsibility in the hands of people who are intimately familiar with the 
local business environment. Managers with deep cultural understanding of the local market 
can be an enormous advantage. They are familiar with local business practices and can read the 
subtle cues of both verbal and nonverbal language. They need not overcome any cultural barriers 
created by an image of being an outsider, and they tend to have a better feel for the needs of 
employees, customers, and suppliers.
Another important advantage of polycentric staffing is elimination of the high cost of relo-
cating expatriate managers and families. This benefit can be extremely helpful for small and 
medium-sized businesses that cannot afford the expenses associated with expatriate employees.
The major drawback of polycentric staffing is the potential for losing control of the host-
country operation. When a company employs natives of each country to manage local opera-
tions, it runs the risk of becoming a collection of discrete national businesses. This situation 
might not be a problem when a firm’s strategy calls for treating each national market differ-
ently. It is not a good policy, however, for companies that are following global strategies. If 
these companies lack integration, knowledge sharing, and a common image, performance will 
surely suffer.
geocentric Staffing
In geocentric staffing, the best-qualified individuals, regardless of nationality, manage opera-
tions abroad. The local operation may choose managers from the host country, from the home 
country, or from a third country. The choice depends on the operation’s specific needs. This 
policy is typically reserved for top-level managers.
AdvAnTAgES And diSAdvAnTAgES Of gEOCEnTriC STAffing Geocentric staffing 
helps a company develop global managers who can adjust easily to any business 
environment—particularly to cultural differences. This advantage is especially useful for 
global companies trying to break down nationalistic barriers, whether between managers 
in a single office or between different offices. One hope of companies using this policy is 
that a global perspective among its managers will help them seize opportunities that may 
otherwise be overlooked.
The downside of geocentric staffing is the expense. Understandably, top managers who are 
capable both of fitting into different cultures and being effective at their jobs are highly prized 
among international companies. The combination of high demand for their skills and their short 
supply inflates their salaries. Moreover, there is the expense of relocating managers and their 
families—sometimes every year or two.

Recruiting and Selecting Human Resources
Naturally, companies try to recruit and select qualified managers and nonmanagerial workers 
who are well suited to their tasks and responsibilities. But how does a company know the num-
ber of managers and workers it needs? How does it recruit the best available individuals? How 
does it select from the pool of available candidates? In this section, we explore some answers to 
these and other important questions about recruiting and selecting employees.
human resource Planning
Recruiting and selecting managers and workers requires human resource (HR) planning—the 
process of forecasting a company’s human resource needs and its supply. The first phase of HR 
planning involves taking an inventory of a company’s current human resources—that is, collect-
ing data on every employee, including educational background, special job skills, previous jobs, 
language skills, and experience living abroad.
The second phase of HR planning is estimating the company’s future HR needs. For 
example, consider a firm that plans to sell its products directly to buyers in a new market abroad. 
Will it create a new operation abroad and staff it with managers from the home office, or will it 
train local managers? Will it hire its own local sales force, or will it hire a distributor? Likewise, 
manufacturing or assembling products in an international market requires factory workers. A 
company must decide whether to hire these people itself or to subcontract production to other 
producers—thus eliminating the need for it to hire the workers. For additional issues that com-
panies should consider when staffing internationally, see the Manager’s Briefcase feature, titled 
“Growing Global.”
As we noted in previous chapters, this decision frequently raises ethical questions. The 
general public is becoming increasingly well informed about the fact that global companies 
make extensive use of subcontractors in low-wage nations. Of particular concern is the question 
of whether subcontractors are taking advantage of “sweatshop” labor. But publicity generated 
by allegations of workplace abuse caused many firms to establish codes of conduct, and they 
stepped up efforts to ensure compliance. For example, Apple (www.apple.com) sent a team of 
investigators to China to look into charges of sweatshop-like conditions at a company manufac-
turing Apple’s iPod. The company that Apple investigated was a division of the world’s largest 
contract electronics manufacturer, Hon Hai Precision Industry.3

Going global successfully requires experience and business acu-
men. It can also strain a company’s resources of time, money, and 
people. Here is some advice on human resource issues to consider 
when expanding internationally:
• Don’t Rely Solely on Home-Country Expatriates Sending 
employees from the home country to manage host-country 
operations is not always best, according to Joseph Monti, 
a partner at Grant Thornton (www.grantthornton.com). 
Although they know the company and its products, home-
country employees often lack experience and contacts in 
the local culture. Monti says a better strategy may be to hire 
a local general manager and bring support staff in from the 
United States as needed.
• Contacts Do Not Guarantee Contracts Relationships are 
more important than contracts, says Virginia Kamsky, CEO of 
Kamsky Associates, Inc. (www.kamsky.com). But she cautions 
that companies should not assume that business will flow in 
just because they hire a government official’s son. Kamsky 
says that companies will do better to hire people with the 
right attitude and excellent people skills.
• Treat Your Employees Abroad as You Want to Be 
Treated People are pretty much the same everywhere in the 
world, says Jeff Dzuira, director of international sales at Ferris 
Manufacturing (www.polymem.com). Treating employees 
fairly and respecting the local culture demonstrates honesty 
and builds goodwill. This will create a bond of trust that can 
grow into profitable relationships.
• Employ the Web in Your Search One of the largest employ-
ment websites is Monster (www.monster.com). It has branches in 
22 countries and literally millions of résumés and is larger than 
ever since its merger with HotJobs. Employers can also post  
job announcements on the website at Overseas Jobs (www. 
overseasjobs.com). Of course, there are many more websites 
out there, and undertaking an aggressive job search or recruit-
ment drive on the Internet is becoming increasingly common.

Another example on this topic involves Levi Strauss (www.levistrauss.com). When apparel 
contractors in Bangladesh admitted that they hired children, Levi Strauss demanded that they 
comply with local regulations. Unfortunately, it turned out that many of the underage workers 
were their families’ sole sources of support. So Levi’s struck a deal: Contractors agreed to con-
tinue paying wages to the youngsters while they went to school, and then they would be rehired 
when they reached age 14. Levi’s paid for them to attend school until they came of age.
In the third phase of HR planning, managers develop a plan for recruiting and selecting people 
to fill vacant and anticipated new positions, both managerial and nonmanagerial. Sometimes, a 
firm must also make plans for reducing its workforce—a process called decruitment—when cur-
rent HR levels are greater than anticipated needs. Planning for decruitment normally occurs when 
a company decides to discontinue manufacturing or selling in a market. Unfortunately, the decision 
by global companies to shift the location of manufacturing from one country to another can also 
result in lost jobs. Let’s now take a closer look at the recruitment and selection processes.
recruiting human resources
The process of identifying and attracting a qualified pool of applicants for vacant positions is 
called recruitment. Companies can recruit internally from among their current employees or 
look to external sources.
CurrEnT EMPLOyEES Finding an international manager among current employees is easiest 
for a large company with an abundance of internal managers. Likely candidates within the 
company are managers who were involved in previous stages of an international project—say, 
in identifying the new production site or potential market. It is likely that these individuals have 
already made important contacts inside the host country and that they have already been exposed 
to its culture.
rECEnT COLLEgE grAduATES Companies also recruit from among recent college graduates 
who have come from other countries to attend college in the firm’s home country. This is a 
particularly common practice among companies in the United States. Over a one-year period, 
these new hires receive general and specialized training and then are given positions in their 
native countries. As a rule, they learn about the organization’s culture and the way in which it 
conducts business. Most important, perhaps, is their familiarity with the culture of the target 
market, including its customs, traditions, and language.
LOCAL MAnAgEriAL TALEnT Companies can also recruit local managerial talent. Hiring 
local managers is common when cultural understanding is a key job requirement. Hiring 
local managers with government contacts can speed the process of getting approvals for local 
operations. In some cases, governments force companies to recruit local managers so that they 
can develop their own internal pools of managerial talent. Governments sometimes also restrict 
the number of international managers that can work in the host country.
nOnMAnAgEriAL WOrkErS Companies typically recruit locally for nonmanagerial positions 
because there is often little need for highly specialized skills or training. However, a specialist from 
the home country is typically brought in to train people chosen for more demanding positions.
Firms also turn to the local labor market when governments restrict the number of people 
allowed into the host country for work purposes. Such efforts are usually designed to reduce 
unemployment among the local population. On the other hand, countries sometimes permit the 
importation of nonmanagerial workers. Kuwait, a wealthy oil-producing country in the Middle 
East, has brought in large numbers of nonmanagerial workers for its blue-collar and technical 
jobs. Many of these workers come from Egypt, India, Lebanon, Pakistan, and the Philippines in 
search of jobs or higher wages.
Selecting human resources
The process of screening and hiring the best-qualified applicants with the greatest performance 
potential is called selection. The process for international assignments includes measuring a per-
son’s ability to bridge cultural differences. Expatriate managers must be able to adapt to a new 
way of life in the host country. Conversely, native host-country managers must be able to work 
effectively with superiors who have different cultural backgrounds.

In the case of expatriate managers, cultural differences between home country and host 
country are important factors in their potential success. Culturally sensitive managers increase 
the likelihood that a company will achieve its international business goals. Recruiters can assess 
cultural sensitivity by asking candidates questions about their receptiveness to new ways of 
doing things and questions about racial and ethnic issues. They can also use global aptitude tests 
to assess an employee’s readiness for an international assignment.
It is also important to examine the cultural sensitivity of each family member who will be 
going to the host country. The ability of a family member (particularly a spouse) to adapt to a 
new culture can be a key factor in the success or failure of an expatriate manager.

Culture Shock
Successful international managers typically do not mind, and often enjoy, living and working outside 
their native lands. In extreme cases, they might even be required to relocate every year or so. These 
individuals are capable of adapting quickly to local conditions and business practices. Such manag-
ers are becoming increasingly valuable with the emergence of markets in Asia, Central and Eastern 
Europe, and Latin America. They are also helping to create a global pool of managers who are ready 
and willing to go practically anywhere on short notice. The size of this pool, however, remains lim-
ited because of the difficulties that many people experience in relocating to unfamiliar cultures.
Living in another culture can be a stressful experience. Selecting managers comfortable travel-
ing to and living in unfamiliar cultures, therefore, is an extremely important factor when recruiting 
for international posts. Set down in the midst of new cultures, many expatriates experience culture 
shock—a psychological process affecting people living abroad that is characterized by homesick-
ness, irritability, confusion, aggravation, and depression. In other words, they have trouble adjusting 
to the new environment in which they find themselves. Expatriate failure—the early return by an 
employee from an international assignment because of inadequate job performance—often results 
from cultural stress. The higher cost of expatriate failure is convincing many companies to invest 
in cultural-training programs for employees sent abroad. For a detailed look at the culture-shock 
process and how to reduce its effects, see the Culture Matters feature, titled “A Shocking Ordeal.”
reverse Culture Shock
Ironically, expatriates who successfully adapt to new cultures often undergo an experience called 
reverse culture shock—the psychological process of readapting to one’s home culture. Because 
values and behavior that once seemed natural now seem strange, reverse culture shock may be 
even more disturbing than culture shock. Returning managers often find that either no position or 
merely a “standby” position awaits them in the home office. Companies often do not know how to 
take full advantage of the cross-cultural abilities developed by managers who have spent several 
potentially valuable years abroad. It is not uncommon for expatriates to leave their companies 
within a year of returning home because of difficulties blending back into the company culture.
Moreover, spouses and children often have difficulty leaving the adopted culture and return-
ing home. For many Japanese employees and their families, reentry into Japanese culture after a 
work assignment in the United States can be particularly difficult. The fast pace of business and 
social life in the United States, plus the relatively high degree of freedom and independence for 
women, contrasts with life in Japan. Returning Japanese expatriates can find it difficult to adjust 
back to life in Japan after years of living in the United States.
dEALing WiTh rEvErSE CuLTurE ShOCk The effects of reverse culture shock can be 
reduced. Home-culture reorientation programs and career-counseling sessions for returning 
managers and their families can be highly effective. For example, the employer might bring the 
entire family home for a short stay several weeks before the official return. This kind of trip 
allows returnees to prepare for at least some of the reverse culture shock that may await them.

Good career development programs can help companies retain valuable managers. Ideally, 
the career development plan is worked out before the employee goes abroad and is revised 
before his or her return. Some companies work with employees before they go abroad to plan 
career paths of up to 20 years within the company. Mentors who have previously gone abroad 
and had to adjust on returning home can also be assigned to returning managers. The mentor 
becomes a confidant with whom the expatriate manager can discuss particular problems related 
to work, family, and readjusting to the home culture.

Training and Development
After a company recruits and selects its managers and other employees, it normally identifies 
the skills and knowledge that employees have and those that they need in order to perform their 
duties. Employees who lack the necessary skills or knowledge can then be directed into specific 
training or development programs.
Culture shock typically occurs during stays of a few months or 
longer in an unfamiliar culture. It begins on arrival and normally 
occurs in four stages (although not all people go through every 
stage):
• Stage I: The “honeymoon” typically lasts from a few days 
to a few weeks. New arrivals are fascinated by local sights, 
pleasant hospitality, and interesting habits. They are thrilled 
about their opportunity and are optimistic about prospects 
for success. Yet this sense of security is often false because, 
so far, interactions with locals are similar to those of a 
tourist.
• Stage II: This stage lasts from a few weeks to a few 
months; in fact, some people never move on to Stage 3. 
Unpredictable quirks of the culture become annoying and 
even maddening. Visitors begin mocking the locals and 
regarding the ways of their native cultures as superior. 
Relationships with spouses and children suffer, and depres-
sion, perhaps even despair, sets in.
• Stage III: Emotions hit bottom and recovery begins. 
Cynical remarks cease as visitors begin to learn more 
about the local culture, interact more with locals, and form 
friendships.
• Stage IV: Visitors not only better understand local cus-
toms and behavior but actually appreciate many of them. 
They now treat differences as “unique” solutions to familiar 
problems in different cultural contexts. Reaching this stage 
is a sign that the expatriate has adapted well and that 
 success in his or her international assignment is  
likely.
Here are some steps that prospective expatriates can take to reduce 
the burden of culture shock during an international assignment:
• Undergo extensive psychological assessment to ensure that 
both you and your family members are emotionally able to 
handle the assignment.
• Obtain knowledge of the local culture (especially its lan-
guage) and critically examine your own cultural biases before 
leaving home.
• If possible, visit the assigned country, mingling with local 
people and getting a feel for your future assignment. Ask 
about local educational, financial, and health-care services.
• After you are inside a culture, meet with others—both  natives 
and expatriates—to discuss your negative and positive 
experiences.
• Most important: Relax, be adventurous, take a worldly 
 perspective, and keep your sense of humor.

Approximately 300,000 U.S. citizens live outside the United States on international assign-
ments, in addition to hundreds of thousands more who travel abroad on business for stays of up 
to several weeks. Some of the many costs of relocating an employee for a long-term international 
assignment include moving expenses and ongoing costs for things such as housing, education, and 
cost-of-living adjustments. That is why many companies realize the need for in-depth training and 
development programs if they are to get the maximum productivity from managers posted abroad.
As companies increasingly reach out to the world to obtain services, they are turning to online 
training (eTraining) programs that teach skills immediately relevant to employees’ jobs. These 
programs include administrative training, human resources training, compliance training, and 
training in frontline issues such as the consumer benefits of a new product. The appeal of eTraining 
to international companies is its consistency: eTraining delivers a consistent message in the same 
way to an infinite number of employees. By contrast, employees receiving other types of training 
in diverse settings worldwide can go away with many different perceptions or biases. Workplace 
eTraining is not perfect: It can be difficult to engage people online and to teach soft skills, such as 
appropriate facial expressions and tone of voice. But its ability to flexibly train large groups cost-
effectively makes it a viable alternative to traditional training methods.4
Methods of Cultural Training
Ideally, everyone involved in business should be culturally literate and prepared to go anywhere 
in the world at a moment’s notice. Realistically, many employees and many companies do not 
need or cannot afford to be entirely literate in another culture. The extent of a company’s inter-
national involvement demands a corresponding level of cultural knowledge from its employees. 
Companies whose activities are highly international need employees with language fluency and 
in-depth experience in other countries. Meanwhile, small companies or those new to interna-
tional business can begin with some basic cultural training. As a company increases its interna-
tional involvement and cross-cultural contact, employees’ cultural knowledge must keep pace.
As we see in Figure 16.1, companies use many methods to prepare managers for an interna-
tional assignment. These methods tend to reflect a manager’s level of international involvement. 
The goal is to create informed, open-minded, flexible managers with a level of cultural training 
appropriate to the duties required of them.
EnvirOnMEnTAL BriEfingS And CuLTurAL OriEnTATiOnS Environmental (area) 
briefings constitute the most basic level of training—often the starting point for studying other 
cultures. Briefings include information on local housing, health care, transportation, schools,

and climate. Such knowledge is normally obtained from books, films, and lectures. Cultural 
orientations offer insight into social, political, legal, and economic institutions. Their purpose is 
to add depth and substance to environmental briefings.
CuLTurAL ASSiMiLATiOn And SEnSiTiviTy TrAining Cultural assimilation teaches the 
culture’s values, attitudes, manners, and customs. So-called guerrilla linguistics, which involves 
learning some phrases in the local language, is often used at this stage. It also typically includes 
role-play exercises: The trainee responds to a specific situation and is evaluated by a team of 
judges. This method is often used when someone is given little notice of a short stay abroad and 
wishes to take a crash course in social and business etiquette and communication. Sensitivity 
training teaches people to be considerate and understanding of other people’s feelings and 
emotions. It gets the trainee “under the skin” of the local people.
LAnguAgE TrAining The need for more thorough cultural preparedness brings us to intensive 
language training. This level of training entails more than memorizing phrases for ordering 
dinner or asking directions. It gets a trainee “into the mind” of local people. The trainee learns 
more about why local people behave as they do. This is perhaps the most critical part of cultural 
training for long-term assignments.
A survey of top executives found that foreign-language skills topped the list of skills needed 
to maintain a competitive edge. According to the survey, 31 percent of male employees and 
27 percent of female employees lacked foreign-language skills. To remedy this situation, many 
companies either employ outside agencies that specialize in language training, or they develop 
their own programs. Employees at 3M Corporation (www.3m.com) developed a third way. They 
created an all-volunteer “Language Society” composed of current and retired employees and 
family members. About 1,000 people are members, and the group offers classes in 17 languages 
taught by 70 volunteer employee teachers. The society meets 45 minutes per week and charges 
a nominal $5 membership fee. Officials at 3M say that the society nicely complements the com-
pany’s formal language education program.5
fiELd ExPEriEnCE Field experience means visiting the culture, walking the streets of its cities 
and villages, and becoming absorbed by it for a short time. The trainee gets to enjoy some of the 
unique cultural traits and to feel some of the stresses inherent in living in the culture.
Finally, remember that spouses and children also need cultural training. Training for them is 
a good investment because the alternatives—an international “commuter marriage” or an expa-
triate failure—are both psychologically and financially expensive options.
Compiling a Cultural Profile
Cultural profiles can be quite helpful in deciding whether to accept an international assignment. 
The following are some excellent sources for constructing a cultural profile:
• CultureGrams Published by ProQuest, this guide can be found in the reference section of 
many libraries. Frequent updates make CultureGrams (www.culturegrams.com) a timely 
source of information. Individual sections profile each culture’s background and its people, 
customs, courtesies, and society. A section titled “For the Traveler” covers details such as 
required entry visas and vaccinations.
• Country Studies Area Handbooks This series explains how politics, economics, society, 
and national security issues are related to one another and are shaped by culture in more 
than 70 countries. Handbooks tend to be politically oriented because they are designed for 
U.S. military personnel. The Country Studies Area Handbooks are available on the Web at 
the Library of Congress website (http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cshome.html).
• Background Notes These notes contain much relevant factual information on human 
rights and related issues in various countries. Yet because they are published by the U.S. 
Department of State (www.state.gov), they take a U.S. political perspective.
Information can also be obtained by contacting the embassies of other countries in your 
home nation. People with firsthand knowledge and specific books and films are also good sources 
of information. After you are inside a country, you’ll find your home country’s embassy a good 
source of further cultural advice. Embassies maintain networks of home-nation professionals who 
work in the local culture, some with many years of experience on which you can draw.

 
Chapter 16 • hiring and Managing eMployees    425
nonmanagerial Worker Training
Nonmanagerial workers also have training and development needs. This is especially true in 
some developing and newly industrialized countries where people have not even completed 
primary school. Even if the workforce is fairly well educated, workers may lack experience 
working in industry. In such cases, companies that do business abroad can train local workers 
in how to work on an assembly line or to cultivate business leads to make sales. The need for 
such basic-skills training continues to grow as companies increasingly explore opportunities in 
emerging markets.
In many countries, national governments cooperate with businesses to train nonmanagerial 
workers. Japan and Germany lead the world in vocational training and apprenticeship programs 
for nonmanagerial workers. Students who are unable or unwilling to enter college can enter pro-
grams paid for by the government and private industry. They undergo extensive practical train-
ing that exposes them to the cutting-edge technologies used by the country’s leading companies. 
For example, Germany’s Mittelstand is a network of three million small and medium-sized com-
panies that account for about two-thirds of the country’s jobs. Mittelstand companies provide 80 
percent of Germany’s apprenticeships. Although they typically employ fewer than 100 people, 
many Mittelstand companies are export powerhouses.

Employee Compensation
Essential to good international HRM is a fair and effective compensation (reward) system. Such 
a system is designed to attract and retain the best and brightest employees and to reward them 
for their performance. Because a country’s compensation practices are rooted in its culture and 
legal and economic systems, determining compensation can be complicated. For example, base 
pay accounts for nearly all employee compensation in some countries. In others, bonuses and 
fringe benefits account for more than half of a person’s compensation.
Managerial Employees
Naturally, compensation packages for managers differ from company to company and from 
country to country. Good packages are fairly complicated to design, for several reasons. 
Consider the effect of cost of living, which includes factors such as the cost of groceries, dining 
out, clothing, housing, schooling, health care, transportation, and utilities. Quite simply, it costs 
more to live in some countries than in others. Moreover, within a given country, the cost of liv-
ing typically varies from large cities to rural towns and villages. Most companies add a certain 
amount to an expatriate manager’s pay to cover greater cost-of-living expenses. On the other 
hand, managers who are relocating to lower cost-of-living countries are typically paid the same 
amount that they were receiving at the home office—otherwise, they would be financially penal-
ized for accepting an international job assignment.
Companies must cover other costs incurred by expatriate managers even when the cost of liv-
ing abroad is lower than at home. One important concern for relocating managers is the quality of 
local education. In many cases, children cannot immediately enter local classes because they do 
not speak the local language. In such instances, most companies pay for private-school education.
BOnuS And TAx inCEnTivES Companies commonly offer managers inducements to accept 
international postings. The most common is a financial bonus. This bonus can be in the form 
of a one-time payment or an add-on to regular pay—generally 15 to 20 percent. Bonuses for 
managers who are asked to go into a particularly unstable country or one with a very low 
standard of living often receive hardship pay.
Managers can also be attracted by another income-related factor. For example, the U.S. gov-
ernment permits citizens working abroad to exclude $95,100 of “foreign-earned income” from 
their taxable income in the United States—even if it was earned in a country with no income tax. 

426  
part 5 • international Business ManageMents
But earnings over that amount are subject to income tax, as are employee benefits such as free 
housing.6
CuLTurAL And SOCiAL COnTriBuTOrS TO COST Culture also plays an important role in 
the compensation of expatriate managers. Some nations offer more paid holidays than others. 
Many offer free medical care to everyone living and working there. Granted, the quality of 
locally available medical care is not always good. Many companies, therefore, have plans to take 
seriously ill expatriates and family members home or to nearby countries where medical care is 
equal to that available in the home country.
Companies that hire managers in the local market might encounter additional costs engen-
dered by social attitudes. For instance, in some countries employers are expected to provide free 
or subsidized housing. In others, the government obliges employers to provide paid maternity 
leaves of up to one-and-a-half years. Government-mandated maternity leaves vary significantly 
across European countries. Although not all such costs need to be absorbed by companies, they 
do tend to raise a country’s cost of doing business.
Managers recruited from within the host country generally receive the same pay as man-
agers who work for local companies. Yet they often receive perks not offered by local firms. 
And some managers are required to visit the home office at least several times per year. If time 
allows, many managers will make these into short vacations by taking along their families and 
adding a few extra days onto the length of the trip.
nonmanagerial Workers
Two main factors influence the wages of nonmanagerial workers. First, their compensation is 
strongly influenced by increased cross-border business investment. Employers can  relocate 
fairly easily to nations where wages are lower. In the home country, meanwhile, workers 
must often accept lower wages when an employer gives them a choice of accepting the 
 reduction or watching their jobs move abroad. This situation is causing a trend toward greater 
equality in workers’ pay around the world. This equalizing effect encourages economic 
 development and improvement in workers’ lives in some nations at the expense of workers in 
other nations.
The freedom with which an employer can relocate differs from country to country, however. 
Although firms in some countries are allowed to move with little notice, in others they are highly 
restricted. Some countries force companies to compensate workers who lose their jobs because 
of relocation. This policy is common in European countries that have erected extensive social 
safety nets for unemployed workers.
Second, the greater mobility of labor today affects wages. Although labor laws in Europe 
are still more stringent than in the United States, the countries of the European Union (EU) 
are abolishing the requirement that workers from one EU nation must obtain visas to work in 
another. If workers in Spain cannot find work at home or if they feel that their current pay is 
inadequate, they are free to move to another EU country where unemployment is lower (say, 
Great Britain). A problem that plagues some European countries today is that they seem to be

Labor–Management Relations
The positive or negative condition of relations between a company’s management and its work-
ers (labor) is referred to as labor–management relations. Cooperative relations between labor 
and management can give a firm a tremendous competitive advantage. When management and 
workers realize they depend on one another, the company is often better prepared to meet its 
goals and to surmount unexpected obstacles that may crop up. Giving workers a greater stake 
in the company—say, through profit-sharing plans—is one way to increase morale and generate 
commitment to improved quality and customer service.
Because relations between laborers and managers are human relations, they are rooted in cul-
ture and are often affected by political movements in a market. Large international companies tend 
to make high-level labor decisions at the home office because it gives them greater control over their 
network of production operations around the world—yet lower-level decisions are often left to man-
agers in each country. In effect, this policy places decisions that have a direct impact on workers’ 
lives in the hands of experts in the local market. Such decisions might include the number of annual 
paid holidays, the length of maternity leave, and the provision of day-care facilities. Localizing such 
management decisions tends to contribute to better labor–management relations because managers 
familiar with local practices are better equipped to handle matters that affect workers personally.
importance of Labor unions
The strength of labor unions in a country where a company has operations is important to its 
performance and can even affect the selection of a location. Developing and emerging markets 
in Asia are a popular location for international companies. Some Asian governments appeal to 
international companies to locate facilities in their nations by promising to keep labor unions 
in check. But companies also find developed nations attractive if, for whatever reason, a co-
operative atmosphere exists between company management and labor unions. In some Asian 
countries, especially Japan, a cultural emphasis on harmony and balanced interests discourages 
confrontation between labor and management.
Ireland became a favorite location for a toehold in the European Union (EU). The main 
attractions are productive labor, lower wages, and a reduced likelihood of disruptive strikes. 
Labor unions are not as strong there as they are on the continent, particularly in France and 
Germany. Nevertheless, Germany has not been immune to the trend of falling union mem-
bership. Union membership has dropped off in Germany over the past decade from about

12 million to about 8 million workers. The main reason for the decline is the lack of inter-
est in union membership in the former East German territories. In addition, labor unions 
comprise only about 9 percent of the labor force in the United States today, compared with 
36 percent 50 years ago.
Despite declines in union membership, labor in Germany exercises a good deal of power 
over management decisions. In fact, under a plan called codetermination, German workers 
enjoy a direct say in the strategies and policies of their employers. This plan allows labor 
representatives to participate in high-level company meetings by actually voting on proposed 
actions.
inTErnATiOnAL LABOr MOvEMEnTS The global activities of unions are making progress 
in areas such as improving the treatment of workers and reducing incidents involving child 
labor. But the efforts of separate national unions to increase their cooperation are somewhat less 
successful. Although unions in one nation might want to support their counterparts in another 
country, generating grassroots support is difficult for two reasons. First, events taking place in 
another country are difficult for many people to comprehend. Distance and cultural difference 
make it hard for people to understand others who live and work elsewhere.
Second, whether they realize it or not, workers in different countries sometimes compete 
against one another. For example, today firms can relocate internationally rather easily. Thus, 
labor unions in one country might offer concessions to attract the jobs that will be created by a 
new production facility. In this way, unions in different nations can wind up competing against 
one another. Some observers argue that this phenomenon creates downward pressure on both 
wages and union power worldwide.

A Final Word
This chapter concludes our survey of international business. We studied how firms, ranging 
from small and medium-sized businesses to large global companies, hire and manage their 
most important resource—their employees. We covered a great deal of territory in our tour of 
international business. We hope we piqued your interest in the global marketplace and in the 
activities of all types of international companies. Yet our learning does not end here. Each of 
us will continue to be exposed to international business in our daily lives—whether as con-
sumers or as current or future business managers. We will continue to expand our knowledge 
of other national cultures, the international business environment, and how companies manage 
their international operations. We wish you well on your continued journey through this fasci-
nating and dynamic subject!

Chapter Summary
 LO1. Explain the three types of staffing policies that companies use.
• Ethnocentric staffing is when a firm staffs its operations outside the home country 
with home-country nationals. It can give a company tight control over subsidiary de-
cision making.

 
Chapter 16 • hiring and Managing eMployees    429
• Polycentric staffing is when a company staffs its operations with host-country 
 natives. It can give subsidiaries some autonomy in decision making.
• Geocentric staffing is when a company staffs its operations with the best- qualified 
individuals, regardless of nationality. It is typically reserved for top-level 
managers.
 LO2. Describe the key human resource recruitment and selection issues.
• Large companies often recruit international managers from within the ranks of exist-
ing employees, but smaller companies may need to hire outside managers.
• International students who have graduated from colleges abroad can be hired, trained 
locally, and posted in their home countries.
• Local managerial talent may be recruited in the host country to hire people with an 
understanding of the local culture and political system. This is often required when a 
company engages extensively in manufacturing or marketing abroad.
• Culture shock is the psychological process affecting people living abroad and is 
characterized by homesickness, irritability, confusion, aggravation, and depression. 
Reverse culture shock is the psychological process of readapting to one’s home 
culture.
 LO3. Summarize the main training and development programs that firms use.
• Cultural training can reduce the effects of culture shock and reverse culture shock.
• Environmental briefings and cultural orientations provide insight on local housing, 
health care, and political, economic, and social institutions.
• Cultural assimilation and sensitivity training explain the local values, attitudes, and 
customs, and help one to understand local feelings and emotions.
• Language training provides specific, practical skills that teach employees to commu-
nicate in the local language.
• Field experience involves a visit to the culture to begin growing accustomed to it.
 LO4. Explain how companies compensate managers and workers.
• An effective compensation policy takes into account local cultures, laws, and prac-
tices. Key issues include base pay, bonuses, and fringe benefits.
• Managerial compensation packages may need adjustment to reflect the local cost of 
living and, perhaps, the cost of education.
• Bonus payments or hardship pay may be needed to entice managers to accept interna-
tional assignments.
• Nonmanagerial compensation levels can be influenced by prevailing wage rates in 
the local market, and by wages in other countries as well.
 LO5. Describe the importance of labor–management relations.
• Labor–management relations are the positive or negative condition of relations be-
tween company management and its workers.
• Good labor–management relations can help a company meet its goals and surmount 
unexpected obstacles.
• Labor–management relations are rooted in culture and are often affected by political 
movements in the local market.
• The strength of labor unions where a company operates can affect its performance 
and can affect site-selection decisions.

Culture shock is the psychological difficulties experienced when living in an unfamiliar cul-
ture, and is characterized by homesickness, irritability, confusion, aggravation, and depression.
 16-3. If you have ever experienced culture shock, in which country did it occur?
 16-4. What did you do to overcome the shock or lessen its effects? Explain.
Ethical Challenge You have been appointed to run a manufacturing plant in an overseas location by your com-
pany. The building is a shell and you have time to carefully consider your hiring options. 
Having done this before, your natural inclination is to bring in experienced managers from 
countries you know and trust. In the past, you hired only locals and it was a disaster as you did 
not understand the culture, customs, and ways of working. This time it is your intention to put 
someone you can trust between them and you. You may encounter some resistance from HR if 
you go ahead with this plan.
 16-5. It would seem that ethnocentric staffing is your preferred way forward. Is ethnocentric 
staffing justifiable on ethical grounds?
 16-6. Your approach was polycentric the previous time. Why might this approach not work in 
all instances?
Teaming Up
In groups of three or four, put yourselves in the role of the HR department of a global business 
setting up for the first time in a new overseas location. The business has a fundamental under-
standing of the location; they have been working with distributors and stockists there for some 
years. Now they want to have a permanent presence there and need carefully considered advice.
 16-7. What are your thoughts about hiring local managerial talent?
 16-8. What about existing employees? Where should we look internally to find potential mana-
gerial talent that could operate well overseas?
 16-9. Perhaps you should recruit directly out of university. Is that a good idea?

BP: Challenges in Global Staffing
F
inding, recruiting, training, and fulfilling human resource re-
quirements are big challenges for companies that operate 
globally. British Petroleum (BP), the 100-year-old leading oil 
and gas company and the world’s third-largest energy company, 
is constantly involved in hiring and managing employees with an 
extensive range of expertise and capabilities all around the world. 
Operating in more than 80 countries, BP implements various staff-
ing policies to ensure that its operations continue to run smoothly. 
As discussed below, BP also needs to keep a watchful eye over 
staff turnover!
In July 2010, BP sued six former members of its energy team 
in Singapore over what BP claimed was a misuse of confidential 
information. The information was said to favor BP’s regional rival 
in Singapore, Shenzhen Brightoil Group, helping it gain a strategic 
advantage over BP in the Asian market. After the unusual resigna-
tion of six employees with no solid explanation, BP began to in-
vestigate the circumstances of the resignations and discovered that 
they had acted wrongfully by compiling a list of grievances based 
on old e-mails and text messages.
The six people sued by BP were Quek Chin Thean, formerly 
global head of residues trading; Simon Cheong, legal manager; 
Paul John Bradshaw, head of operations eastern hemisphere; John 
Foo, trading manager; Clarence Chang, regional marine sales 
manager; and Laura Kuan, executive assistant. It was claimed that 
they targeted and recruited BP staff to join Shenzhen Brightoil 
Group. Quek Chin Thean, who was a well-respected manager in 
BP’s trade section, had been hired locally by BP in 1992 and was 
accused of recruiting three U.S.-based colleagues to Shenzhen 
Brightoil Group. John Foo, Paul John Bradshaw, and Laura Kuan 
were also suspected of making unauthorized downloads from BP’s 
computer networks.
BP also believed that the employees took advantage of the 
information to which they had access by sharing BP’s commercial 
strategies and trading confidential information with the ultimate 
aim of setting up a Singapore-based oil-trading firm. According to 
BP, the unauthorized disclosure of such information would greatly 
damage the security of BP’s strategies. BP also argued that its 
customers were being diverted to Shenzhen Brightoil, which was 
considered a deliberate act of sabotage. Furthermore, BP insisted 
that the six employees directly helped Shenzhen Brightoil Group 
while they were still employed by BP, contradicting the terms of 
their employment contracts.
The six denied all accusations against them in August 2010. 
The case was extremely important for BP as its Singapore office 
works in the Asian oil-trading hub, which has a very competi-
tive job market. BP has many rivals in the region including large 
corporations such as Mercuria Energy Ltd., Noble Group Ltd., 
Standard Chartered Ltd., Citigroup Inc., Societe Generale SA, and 
Trafigura Beheer BV, which are hiring coal, oil, and natural gas 
traders in Asia amid rising demand in the region for energy. BP 
argued that it lost the opportunity to address any human-resource 
issues and stem the loss of its staff as a result of the sudden and 
mass resignations of many of its valuable employees.
Thinking globally
 16-12. What advantages did BP expect in hiring local managers 
in an emerging market like Southeast Asia?
 16-13. What challenges did BP face by hiring local people in its 
office in Singapore?
 16-14. Suppose a company decides that it has made a mistake by 
hiring local personnel in a key Asian country. What are 
some potential problems that it will face if it decides to 
install or reinstate expatriate managers in these positions?
