Dedication
From Michael: To my family, whose sacrifi ce enabled me to write this book, 
and to the hundreds of salespeople over the years who freely shared their 
successes and failures in selling to multicultural customers. I trust that you 
and those who follow in your footsteps will benefi t from the information con-
tained herein.
From Ralph: To the many salespeople, companies, and organizations I have 
mentored and coached who have actually had the sticktoitism to put into 
practice the lessons they have learned . . . and succeeded because of it.
Acknowledgments
Although we wrote the book, several other talented individuals contributed 
to its conception, development, and perfection. We give special thanks to 
the following contributors, who collaborated with us on the development of 
chapters in their areas of expertise:
Bill Imada, president of iW Group (www.iwgroupinc.com)
Howard Buford, president and CEO of Prime Access Inc. (www.prime
access.net)
Virgil Scott, former CEO of Anderson Communications (www.AnderCom.com). 
Mr. Scott was twice honored for excellence in business by the Graduate School 
of Business at the University of Virginia. He passed away in 2008.
Jeff Yang, vice president and consumer strategist for Iconoculture (www.icon
oculture.com)

James Wong, vice president of marketing for e21 Corporation
Deb McLean, vice president of marketing and business development for 
Carolina Postal Credit Union (www.cpcuonline.com)
Dr. Andrew Erlich of Erlich Transcultural Consultants in Woodland Hills, 
California (www.etcethnic.com)
Thanks also go to acquisitions editor Lindsay Lefevere, who chose us to author 
this book and guided us through the tough part of getting started. Georgette 
Beatty, our project editor, deserves a loud cheer for acting as a very patient 
collaborator and gifted editor — shuffl ing chapters back and forth, shepherd-
ing the text and fi gures through production, making sure any technical issues 
were properly resolved, and serving as the unoffi cial quality control manager. 
Vicki Adang, our copy editor, earns an editor of the year award for ferreting 
out our typos, misspellings, grammatical errors, and other language faux pas, 
in addition to assisting Georgette as reader advocate — asking the questions 
we should have asked ourselves. We also tip our hats to the composition crew 
for doing such an outstanding job of transforming a loose collection of text and 
illustrations into such an attractive bound book.
We also owe special thanks to our technical editor, Lee Merritts, senior part-
ner with Encore Associates Inc. (www.encoreassociates.com), for pointing 
out technical errors in the manuscript, helping guide its content, and offering 
his own tips, tricks, and insights from the world of cross-cultural sales.

Introduction
T
he multicultural marketplace is on the rise and about to explode. 
According to the Selig Center for Economic Growth, total purchases 
by Hispanics, Blacks, Asians, and Native Americans in the United States 
already exceed $2 trillion annually. That figure is bigger than the economies 
of all but the nine largest countries in the world and is expected to rise to 
$3 trillion by 2011.
These groups and others could become your customers if you demonstrate 
a sensitivity to their cultures and meet their unique needs. Unfortunately, 
without special knowledge, training, and practice, the average American 
salesperson is ill-prepared to take advantage of the opportunity. In fact, 
simply by sticking to their traditional sales pitches, many salespeople are 
destined to offend multicultural customers without ever realizing it. All they 
know is that the customer left all of a sudden without buying anything.
As any experienced salesperson knows, selling isn’t about pushing products 
or services onto unsuspecting people who don’t want them. Successful sell-
ing is based on building trusting relationships with customers so you can 
understand their wants and needs and then show them how you can accom-
modate them. The challenge is that people from cultures other than yours 
don’t always develop relationships in the same way as you do, and they may 
not want the same products and services as your traditional clientele.
Cross-cultural selling is nothing more than adjusting your sales practices, 
presentation, and products to meet the unique needs of multicultural cus-
tomers. Although it may sound simple, you must be constantly aware of 
how culture affects your interactions so you can continuously adapt to your 
buyers. In Cross-Cultural Selling For Dummies, we show you how.
About This Book
You may be missing out on incredible sales opportunities and not even real-
ize it. As a salesperson, this should concern you, at least a little. After all, if 
you miss these opportunities, they become easy pickings for your competi-
tion. This book can help you boost your sales by broadening your appeal and 
reaching out to customers of races and cultures that differ from yours.

2
Cross-Cultural Selling For Dummies 
This book’s goal is to transform you from a one-dimensional salesperson into 
a multidimensional sales professional — someone who’s better equipped to 
deal with diversity in the marketplace. Although we encourage you to read 
this book from cover to cover to maximize the return on your investment, 
Cross-Cultural Selling For Dummies facilitates a skip-and-dip approach. It pres-
ents the information in bite-size pieces, so you can skip to the chapter or sec-
tion that meets your current needs, master the concepts there, and then skip 
to another section or set the book aside for later reference.
As soon as you begin to implement some of our suggestions, you can expect 
to see positive changes in the way your multicultural customers shop and 
buy from you. For every step you take to accommodate them, they take a 
step closer to becoming lifelong customers and referring friends and family 
to you.
Conventions Used in This Book
Compared to other selling programs and books, Cross-Cultural Selling For 
Dummies is anything but conventional, but we do use some conventions to 
call your attention to certain items. For example:
 
 Italics highlight new, somewhat technical terms, such as ethnic store, and 
emphasize words when we’re driving home a point.
 
 Boldface text indicates key words in bulleted lists and steps to follow in 
numbered lists.
 
 Monofont highlights Web site, blog, and e-mail addresses.
In addition, even though three authors contributed to the writing of this 
book, when you see “we,” that’s Michael and Ralph talking. When Ralph or 
Michael is telling a personal story, we’ll clearly identify who’s talking. Joe’s 
more of the silent partner in this project — the wordsmith, the guy responsi-
ble for keeping you engaged and entertained and teaming up with the editors 
to make sure everything is explained clearly and thoroughly.
We use several special terms throughout the book, too. Here they are, com-
plete with our definitions for them:
 
 Multicultural: Having more than one cultural background. A multicultural 
marketplace includes people from different cultures. A multicultural cus-
tomer, on the other hand, is someone who either has parents from two 
different cultures or was raised in one culture and is adapting to life in 
another culture — for example, an Asian who now lives in America.

3
 Introduction
 
 Cross-cultural: Dealing with people from cultures that differ from your 
own. Cross-cultural selling is a skill that anyone can develop to market 
and sell more effectively to consumers from other cultures.
 
 Diversity: The presence of a wide range of variation. Although diver-
sity can refer to any differences, including gender, age, race, ethnicity, 
socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and physical ability, we focus solely on 
cultural differences in this book.
 
 People of color: Yes, all people have some color, but we’re talking about 
anyone who isn’t Caucasian, including Hispanic Americans, African 
Americans, Asian Americans, Middle Eastern Americans, and Native 
Americans. This term can apply to new immigrants as well as longtime 
Americans who still feel influence from another culture.
 
 Minority: A group whose population is smaller than the predominant 
population in the area. Please don’t let the term get under your skin — 
to us, it’s just a number thing.
We wrestled with terminology in labeling the racial/ethnic majority of 
the United States. The Census Bureau refers to this group as White (non-
Hispanic). Throughout the book, we refer to members of this group as 
Caucasians, Anglo Americans, and Whites. None of these terms is completely 
accurate — few people on the planet are really “white,” few American citizens 
are literally Caucasian, and “Anglo” implies England — but these are the most 
common terms currently in use.
Finally, we use the term Hispanic interchangeably with Latino and the term 
African American interchangeably with Black, because different people in 
these groups may prefer one term or the other or neither. The only way to 
know what any customer you’re working with wants to be called is to ask.
What You’re Not to Read
Feel free to skip any sections you feel as though you’ve already mastered. If, 
for example, you’re already well aware of how potentially lucrative it can be 
to sell to other cultures, you can safely skip Chapter 2 and immediately start 
discovering ways to tap that potential. If you want to dive right in and start 
developing cross-cultural selling skills, you can jump right to Chapter 4. Of 
course, you can always come back to the earlier chapters later.
You can also safely skip anything you see in a gray-shaded box. We stuck it 
in a box for the same reason that most people stick stuff in boxes — to get it 
out of the way so you wouldn’t trip over it. However, you may find the stories 
and brief asides uproariously funny and perhaps even mildly informative (or 
vice versa).

Cross-Cultural Selling For Dummies 
Foolish Assumptions
The biggest assumption we make in this book is that you’ve already had 
some basic training on the fine art of selling; you’re a salesperson, service 
provider, customer service representative, or business owner who’s suc-
ceeded in your own market but hasn’t attracted a significant number of 
diverse clientele. Specifically, we assume you already know the basics, which 
are covered in Selling For Dummies (Wiley) by Tom Hopkins. Hopkins gets 
you up to speed in a hurry on the art of selling, the need to know your 
products and your customers, and how to sell effectively throughout the 
seven-step selling cycle. If you’re looking to take your sales career to the next 
level, check out Ralph’s Advanced Selling For Dummies (Wiley).
Another foolish assumption we make is that you’re open-minded. Clients 
from other cultures can seem to do some pretty silly and perhaps rather 
annoying things. From their perspective, however, you may do some pretty 
silly and rather annoying things yourself. The key to becoming a natural at 
cross-cultural selling is to be open to the fact that people from other cultures 
have different beliefs and behaviors. Diversity is what makes our world such 
an interesting and astounding place in which to live.
We also assume that you’re committed to practicing what you discover in 
this book. Practice makes you comfortable dealing with clients from different 
backgrounds, and your clients will feel comfortable buying from you.
How This Book Is Organized
We wrote this book so you could use it in either of two ways. You can pick 
up the book and flip to any chapter for a quick, stand-alone minicourse on 
a specific cross-cultural selling topic, or you can read the book from cover 
to cover. To help you navigate, we took the book’s 18 chapters and divvied 
them up into five parts plus an appendix.
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural 
Mind-Set
In this part, we reveal the incredible untapped potential of the multicultural 
marketplace, test your cross-cultural sales aptitude, explain the challenges of 
dealing with a more diverse clientele, and assist you in your early stages of 
developing cross-cultural competency.

 Introduction
Part II: Multicultural Marketing 
and Beyond
Sales and marketing people often think they can generate multicultural 
sales simply by adding a little diversity to their marketing and advertising 
campaigns. Depending on the market they target, they may add Hispanics, 
African Americans, Asians, or others into the mix to broaden an ad’s appeal. 
Although this is certainly one component of multicultural marketing, you 
really need a more comprehensive program.
This part shows you how to revamp your marketing materials to give them a 
global appeal, introduce other aspects of multiculturalism throughout your 
company, give your establishment a multicultural makeover, and bring in 
new products that appeal to your target market. By the end of Part II, you 
won’t just look multicultural friendly, you’ll be multicultural friendly.
Part III: A Crash Course 
in Cross-Cultural Sales
In this part, we provide you with a crash course in cross-cultural sales, 
showing you how to meet and greet customers, build mutual trust and 
respect, adjust your sales presentation, tune in to signals that indicate a 
readiness to buy, close the sale, and effectively negotiate with people who 
were born and raised to haggle.
Part IV: Taking Your Game 
to the Next Level
In this part, we offer suggestions on how to enhance customer service, 
generate more word-of-mouth referrals, and start building a more diverse 
sales team to serve the multicultural market more effectively. You also find 
out how to become an integral part of a diverse sales team. If you’re not a 
person of color, you discover the advantages of being part of such a group.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies title comes complete with a Part of Tens — two or more 
chapters that each contain ten strategies, tips, tricks, or other important 
items to keep in mind. In Cross-Cultural Selling For Dummies, the Part of Tens 
busts ten myths about multicultural customers and reveals ten common 
stereotypes that people from other cultures often have about Americans.

Cross-Cultural Selling For Dummies 
As an added bonus, this book includes an appendix, in which we offer some 
insider information on differences you can expect in specific cultures. The 
appendix also includes a cross-cultural holiday calendar, so you won’t miss a 
holiday sale opportunity ever again.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we’ve sprinkled icons in the margins to cue you in on 
different types of information that call out for your attention. Here are the 
icons you’ll see and a brief description of each.
 
We want you to remember everything you read in this book, but if you can’t 
quite do that, then remember the important points we flag with this icon.

Where to Go from Here
If you’re not convinced that investing effort in pursuing multicultural custom-
ers is worth the trouble, check out Chapter 2. If you’re already convinced, 
but are unsure of just how much you’ll need to change, check out Chapter 3, 
where we provide a brief quiz to assess your knowledge and skills.
Chapter 4 is a required course. Think of it as Cross-Cultural Selling 101. Here, 
you master all the basics on which you can build your future success.
Chapters 5 and 8–13 contain most of the practical advice you need to market 
and sell to multicultural customers, but if you skip Chapters 6 and 7, come 
back to them later when you have time. They show you how to put a compre-
hensive program in place so an individual salesperson or an entire company 
can realize the full potential of the new global marketplace.
As for the remaining chapters, they all contain practical information that can 
take your business to the next level. Even though we don’t consider them 
part of the core curriculum, you’ll be missing out if you choose not to dig 
through them for some additional gems.

f you cater only to clients who look like you, act like you, and buy like 
you, you’re essentially saying no to dessert, because you’re passing up 
a chance at savoring a slice of a $2 trillion pie. That’s how much money 
minority consumers in the United States spend each year on products and 
services, and that figure is rising.
Like most salespeople and business owners, you may skip dessert, but you 
certainly don’t want to miss an opportunity to expand your sales into new 
markets. Unfortunately, you may be limiting your income potential and not 
even know it by sending messages to the multicultural marketplace that 
essentially tell consumers to stay away. This kind of miscommunication is 
common when people from different backgrounds meet. You need to make 
only a few adjustments to overcome the cultural barriers, but those tweaks 
can make all the difference in the world.
This chapter gives you an overview of what it takes to attract customers from 
other cultures. Here, we offer a brief primer that defines key terms and con-
cepts, and shows you how to bridge the gap and expand your appeal to the 
multicultural marketplace, whether you sell directly to consumers (B2C) or 
business-to-business (B2B).
 
When you begin to consider tapping the potential of the multicultural market-
place, lose the us-versus-them mentality. We’re all part of this marketplace, 
whether we admit it or not. As the late great statesman and hugely successful 
Wall Street investor Bernard M. Baruch once said, “We didn’t all come over on 
the same ship, but we’re all in the same boat.”

Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
Grasping the Concept and Effects 
of “Cultural Diversity”
Most people in the United States are born with an understanding of “cultural 
diversity.” After all, this country is the great melting pot or salad bowl or 
whatever metaphor you want to use to describe the unique mixture of people 
of different races, colors, and cultures who have chosen to live in the land 
of opportunity. Depending on where you grew up, you probably went to 
school with African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Middle Easterners, Native 
Americans, Poles, Irish people, Italians, or Germans. If you’ve ever visited the 
homes of people from different cultures, you probably discovered that they 
ate different foods, decorated their homes a little differently, and had their 
own unique customs.
When you’re doing business with people from different cultures, particularly 
nowadays when immigrants tend not to melt as quickly into the same pot, 
cultural diversity may take on new meanings and significance. Many of these 
groups want to retain their culture and language while still learning American 
ways and the English language.
In the following sections, we define some key terms to preface our discussion 
of cultural diversity, cover important distinctions between cultural tenden-
cies and stereotypes, point out the value of identifying cultural tendencies, 
and help you begin the process of becoming more aware and accepting of 
different cultures.
Defining a few important terms
Before jumping into discussions of cultural diversity and how it relates to the 
way you sell goods and services to people from other cultures, it’s important 
to agree upon definitions of some key terms. In the following sections, we 
explain what we mean when we say culture, diversity, cultural diversity, and 
cross-cultural selling.
Defining “culture”
Officially speaking, culture is a shared set of values, beliefs, and behaviors 
that may have little or nothing to do with ethnicity or race. In other words, 
ethnicity and race are nature, whereas culture is nurture — culture is 
learned. The United States, for example, is composed of many ethnic groups, 
yet most of us often share common values, including freedom, individualism, 
privacy, equality, time consciousness, materialism, directness, and assertive-
ness. Some people claim that a culture needs to share a language, too, but 
we’ll leave that up to opinionated politicians and pundits to debate.

11
 Chapter 1: Expanding Your Market
 
Culture can influence people’s relationships with one another, their feelings 
about money, and their attitudes toward business. Becoming sensitive to 
the values, beliefs, and behaviors of people from other cultures can help you 
adjust the way you sell to these consumers and customize your products and 
services, as needed, to meet their unique needs and wants. When you make 
the necessary changes, your multicultural customers are more likely to feel 
comfortable doing business with you.
Defining “diversity”
Diversity is just a more politically charged version of variety, both of which 
Americans generally embrace. Just walk into any grocery store or pharmacy 
and check out the variety of toothpaste. One leading toothpaste manufac-
turer alone has more than two dozen varieties of toothpaste. Colleges and 
universities make a point of promoting the diversity of their student bodies 
and professors. We even seek diversity in our cellphones, pimping them out 
with custom ringtones, skins, and dozens of add-on features.
Yet, when we find ourselves in a roomful of people, we tend to feel uncom-
fortable around those who may differ from us in some way. Studies show that 
people in a crowd naturally gravitate toward those who they perceive are 
more like themselves.
Adapting can be difficult. People are afraid they’ll have nothing in common 
to talk about or that they may say something insulting. Rather than take the 
risk, most people shy away from any sort of interaction with those to whom 
No Tupperware for Middle Easterners?!
Back in the 1970s, my (Ralph’s) second in com-
mand, Lois Maljak, was a sales manager for 
Tupperware. Her mentors advised her not to 
do parties for Middle Eastern clientele because 
Middle Easterners didn’t understand the prem-
ise of throwing a party to sell merchandise.
Well, Lois went ahead and tried it anyway. She 
had great success. Although her Middle Eastern 
clientele didn’t exactly do Tupperware parties 
like most people — a couple of hours in the 
evening and a few desserts — they certainly 
grasped the concept. In fact, they really knew 
how to throw a party. They usually held their 
parties during the day, serving full, lavish meals 
and doing much more socializing than product 
demonstrations. And the people who attended 
the parties usually placed orders because they 
were great cooks and loved the product.
Selling the Middle Eastern clients on the idea 
of selling products at parties could take a little 
more effort, but the return on that investment 
was usually well worth it — consistent book-
ings and great sales. The guests became the 
salespersons, and the salesperson became 
the trusted supplier. Some of Lois’s customers 
became a part of her sales team, which led to a 
host of success stories.

12
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
they don’t feel an affinity. Although you can gain new insights and experi-
ences from talking with someone who may be different from yourself, it’s 
often easier to avoid the person.
 
Although anyone who avoids interacting with people from other cultures loses 
out, as a salesperson or business owner, you have even more to lose in the 
form of money from lost sales opportunities.
Defining “cultural diversity”
In the previous two sections, we define culture and diversity separately. 
Bringing the two together, we arrive at cultural diversity — a group consisting 
of individuals or collections of individuals with different sets of values, beliefs, 
and behaviors. Obviously, the world is culturally diverse. Some countries 
are more culturally diverse than others; for example, most people consider 
the United States more culturally diverse than, say, Poland or Switzerland. 
Neighborhoods, schools, and businesses can also be more or less culturally 
diverse depending on the composition of their membership.
Defining “cross-cultural selling”
As a seasoned sales professional, business owner, or manager, you probably 
have a pretty good idea of what selling entails, but what’s this cross-cultural 
selling thing all about?
The term cross-cultural merely means comparing or dealing with two or more 
cultures. In this book, that means you sell to someone from another culture. 
As you know, selling is about building solid relationships with your custom-
ers and clients. With cross-cultural selling, you discover ways to increase sales 
by building better relationships with people from other cultures.
Separating cultural tendencies 
from stereotypes
Throughout this book, we use several qualifiers, including “sometimes,” 
“often,” “many,” and “some.” Honestly, we’re not trying to waffle on sensitive 
issues. We use so many qualifiers because we want to be careful not to 
cross the line from describing cultural tendencies to establishing dangerous 
stereotypes.
Many people around the world, for example, think Americans are always in 
a hurry. Most Americans would agree that many of us exhibit this tendency. 
In fact, the United States is the birthplace of fast food, microwave ovens, 
one-hour photo processing, and instant messaging (even e-mail was too slow 
for us). After all, “time is money,” as many of us like to say. Does this mean 

13
 Chapter 1: Expanding Your Market
that absolutely everyone in this country is preoccupied with time and is in 
a hurry? Absolutely not! And to say so would be to stereotype Americans. 
Stereotyping removes people’s humanity by painting everyone with the same 
broad brush.
However, cultures do exhibit certain similar characteristics, and knowing 
these tendencies can enable you to serve the needs of people from specific 
cultures more effectively. People from Japan, for example, value relationships 
perhaps even more than the products or services you’re selling. Knowing 
this tendency can improve your ability, as a salesperson, to sell to customers 
from Japan. You know upfront that you have to spend more time building a 
relationship before delivering your sales presentation.
 
Although we point out cultural tendencies that can help you customize your 
products and services, and adjust your sales presentations to people from 
different cultures, bear in mind that the only way to know what a specific 
customer believes or wants is to ask. Never stereotype any customer for any 
reason. Always treat everyone as an individual.
Flip to Chapter 4 for more about separating stereotypes from cultural 
tendencies.
Studying cultural tendencies 
to predict behavior
Although using cultural tendencies to predict behaviors may not exactly be 
politically correct, statisticians follow this practice on a regular basis. Auto 
insurance companies study patterns all the time, for example, to set insur-
ance rates. If you have a teenage son who just started driving, you know 
exactly what we mean. Even though your son may be the most highly skilled 
defensive driver in his class, he’s still going to get stuck with a higher rate, 
because male teenage drivers tend to have more accidents.
Advertisers are even more obsessed with studying trends; they spend millions 
of dollars a year segmenting their customers by age, income, gender, leisure 
activities, and hundreds of other factors. Music producers often target their 
recordings to specific ethnicities and age groups. Automobile manufacturers 
design cars and trucks for specific segments of the population. If these groups 
and others can use cultural tendencies to their benefit, so can you. Simply 
knowing that Asians tend to be more visual can improve the success of your 
sales presentation, for example. Likewise, being aware that when customers 
from haggle-friendly cultures offer you a super low price, they’re actually 
sending you a strong buying signal that can improve your chances of making 
the sale if you take the right approach with them. In Chapter 4, we show you 
ways to become more sensitive to differences in other cultures.

Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
Identifying the cultural impact 
on your business
Minority populations, including Hispanics, African Americans, Middle 
Easterners, and Asians, are expanding rapidly almost everywhere in the 
United States. Discovering a part of the country that’s not affected by the 
rapid growth of at least one of these groups is rare.
Your life has probably been affected to some degree by this shifting demo-
graphic, but the change may have been so gradual that you barely noticed. 
Perhaps a few more ethnic restaurants have appeared on the landscape 
or a few more minority-owned nail salons or dry cleaners. Maybe you 
noticed a neighborhood newspaper printed in a foreign script or heard 
unfamiliar languages or accents in your local grocery store or while taking 
public transportation.
When you begin to see more businesses from other cultures in your neigh-
borhood, this is usually a clear sign that populations of people from these 
other cultures are on the rise in your area. As a salesperson or business 
owner, you should see this as an opportunity — these new business owners 
and consumers are going to need not only products and services specific to 
their culture, but also basic goods and services.
 
Talk to your local chamber of commerce, Board of Realtors, Welcome Wagon, 
and other groups dedicated to welcoming newcomers to the community. They 
can likely clue you in on population and demographic shifts in your area. See 
Chapter 2 for more information on getting the latest demographic details.
Embracing the Global Rule
Many salespeople say that the way they relate to multicultural customers is 
to simply treat everyone “the same.” This may seem like the right approach 
on the surface, but it can actually turn out to be not such a good idea. New 
parents often say that about their children, too, until they’ve been parents 
for a few years and realize that each of their children is a unique individual 
with different needs, desires, talents, and passions.
Not only is treating everyone the same impossible, but it’s also undesir-
able. It’s tantamount to saying that if a customer came into your store with 
a Seeing Eye dog and a white cane because she was blind, you would just 
hand her a brochure to “read.” You’d never even think for a moment of doing 

15
 Chapter 1: Expanding Your Market
something like that. Instead, you would adjust your presentation to meet the 
customer’s needs by reading the brochure to her and perhaps letting her 
touch or sample the product.
 
For similar reasons, you want to adjust your presentations to meet the unique 
needs of people who are culturally different. This is the Global Rule. Everyone 
knows that the Golden Rule is to “treat others as you would like to be treated.” 
The Global Rule goes one step further: Treat others as they would like to be 
treated. When you begin to practice the Global Rule, you soon discover that 
becoming more sensitive to other peoples’ cultures doesn’t require a great 
deal of extra effort, but it does require increased awareness, training, and sen-
sitivity. Flip to Chapter 3 for details on assessing your awareness and Chapter 
4 for the scoop on increasing your awareness.
Overcoming cultural snobbery
Far too many Americans are cultural snobs, wondering why people from 
other cultures would ever think of moving here if they have no intention of 
speaking and acting like Americans. The answer is that a good percentage of 
new immigrants (35 percent according to the U.S. Census Bureau) eventually 
do become U.S. citizens.
In fact, a poll of Hispanics conducted for the Spanish-language television 
network Univision claimed that 94 percent of Hispanics believe that citizen-
ship is important. To prepare for citizenship, many attend school at night to 
learn English and American history after working 10–12 hours or more a day 
and 6 or 7 days a week.
These immigrants, especially the adults, can’t adopt a new language and an 
entirely new way of life overnight. If you studied a foreign language in high 
school or college, you’re probably well aware of how difficult it is just to 
become familiar with the basics, let alone master the nuances of the language.
It’s helpful to remember that the American culture is only about 200 years 
old, while some other cultures have been in existence for thousands of years. 
This may help explain why it can be even harder for immigrants to leave their 
culture behind when they arrive here.
 
Transitioning to a different language and an entirely new way of life can take 
a tremendous amount of time and effort, so lifelong Americans need to be 
patient. Although new immigrants may try to act like Americans, you need to 
make some adjustments while they transition to their new culture. If you’re 
willing to adapt, you have an excellent chance of winning over these custom-
ers for life. And we can show you how.

Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
Spotting Opportunities in the 
Multicultural Marketplace
The term multicultural marketplace inspires yawns among many ill-informed 
salespeople who think these niche markets represent nothing more than 
chump change. When we start to lay out the real numbers in dollars and 
cents, however, their eyes open wide, and their ears immediately perk up. 
The numbers are pretty impressive and represent tremendous opportunities 
for any business willing to invest a little effort in tapping into these markets.
In the following sections, we explore the collective purchasing power of mul-
ticultural markets and the potential upside for your business.
Measuring the purchasing power 
of other cultures
As the minority population has grown, its purchasing power (the financial means 
to purchase products and services) has also grown, but at an exponential rate. 
According to the Selig Center for Economic Growth, the combined purchasing 
power of the multicultural market has grown from $1.39 trillion in 2000 to more 
than $2 trillion in 2007 and is estimated to reach $3 trillion in 2011.
This growth has far outstripped growth in the traditional White market. The 
Selig Center estimates that Hispanic purchasing power rose 307 percent from 
1990 to 2007; Asian buying power increased 294 percent; Native Americans 
Taking cultural influences into account
I (Michael) have spoken to more than 25,000 
salespeople since 1990, and most agree that 
Middle Eastern, Hispanic, and Asian customers 
tend to want to negotiate the sales price of a 
product much more than someone who grew up 
in the United States. Does every Middle Eastern, 
Hispanic, or Asian customer insist on negotiat-
ing the sales price? Absolutely not! However, 
if these salespeople encountered someone 
from one of these cultures who wasn’t a skilled 
negotiator, they would sense that something 
was unusual.
Although new immigrants in this country may 
try to become Americanized, they may still 
have cultural influences from their ancestors 
that influence the way they feel about money 
and about buying products. For example, my 
parents (Michael) instilled in me at a very early 
age that owing money is shameful. This ancient 
Confucian principle runs counter to Americans’ 
tendency to charge every purchase from gro-
ceries to gasoline. Neither extreme is probably 
wise, but the fact is that different cultures have 
different beliefs about borrowing and saving.

17
 Chapter 1: Expanding Your Market
were able to buy 190 percent more during the same period; African American 
buying power increased by 166 percent; and White buying power rose by 
only 124 percent.
 
Given the rate of exploding growth among multicultural consumers, you can 
expect more of your income to be from customers from other cultures, and 
this trend is expected to continue far into the foreseeable future.
Identifying the potential upside 
for your business
Statistics about the increased national buying power of minorities may not 
be sufficient to convince you of the potential upside for your particular busi-
ness in your corner of the country. You can look up demographics for your 
markets on the U.S. Census Bureau’s Web site at www.census.gov, but that 
may not tell you much, either. Sure, you can pull up a fact sheet that lists 
the total population of a given area and breaks it down into different groups, 
but the information can only act as a starting point at best and may even be 
misleading. For example, a new-home builder in Dallas found that while Asian 
Indians accounted for only about 2 percent of the city’s population, they often 
comprised as much as 90 percent of the builder’s home buyers.
 
For the most accurate and inexpensive source of data about the potential mul-
ticultural market for your company, look to your own experience and gather 
information from your staff and your competitors (see Chapter 2 for additional 
information):
 
 Ask your staff how many people from other cultures check out your 
goods on a daily basis without buying anything. This gives you a pretty 
clear indication of how much of the multicultural market is slipping 
through your fingers.
 
 Probe a little further to explore possible reasons why people are shop-
ping without buying. For example, your staff may notice that people ask 
about products or services you don’t offer, or they may sense that shop-
pers don’t feel welcome — your store or personnel may not be friendly 
or helpful enough for their tastes. By identifying the causes for your cus-
tomers’ dissatisfaction, you can often begin to identify solutions.
 
 Subtly engage your competitors’ staff in a conversation to find out their 
experience in dealing with consumers from other cultures. If your com-
petitors are selling well in the multicultural marketplace, you’re doing 
something wrong. Find out what they’re doing that you’re not.
If you sell fairly expensive items, such as appliances, furniture, cars, or 
homes, and notice that multicultural customers visit repeatedly without 
making a purchase, you’re definitely missing out on excellent opportunities. 
While consumers from other cultures often have money to spend, they rarely 

18
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
have time to waste coming back to the same business. For some reason, 
they’re attracted to your business but don’t feel comfortable enough to buy 
from you. No need to panic, though — in the following section, you find out 
about the adjustments you can make to appeal to multicultural clientele.
Adapting to Changing Markets
In business, the fact that the only constant is change is almost cliché. 
Products are constantly being updated, markets fluctuate, and technology 
transforms everything almost daily. The composition of the marketplace is 
also in constant flux, becoming increasingly diverse.
The salespeople and business owners who thrive in the face of the ever-
changing markets are those who are willing and able to adapt. Instead of 
fighting change, they embrace it. As a result, they’re constantly gaining 
ground in the battle for market share.
Making your business more attractive to people from diverse cultures prob-
ably requires a lot less than you may expect. You just need to be sensitive to 
cultural differences. With a little training and practice, you’ll be well on your 
way to making the necessary adjustments. In the following sections, we intro-
duce several ways you can adapt in order to lay claim to your multicultural 
market share.
Getting a marketing makeover
Marketing and advertising professionals know exactly what is necessary to 
market effectively, because they’ve been doing it for years — studying the 
lifestyles and needs of their target markets to create a profile of the target 
consumer. The profile may indicate that the biggest opportunities are to be 
had by appealing to working-class people who live within a 10-mile radius of 
the store. It could be local middle-class people who own RVs. Or perhaps the 
target market is upper-class international travelers. Marketers and advertis-
ers carefully study the target profile to decide which products and services 
may appeal to the group and how they can most effectively present their 
products and services to those consumers.
Unfortunately, many companies fail to realize that this same approach works 
just as effectively for the multicultural marketplace. To reach multicultural 
customers, you must get to know their lifestyles and needs. Trying to appeal 
to Hispanics is not enough, for example, because of the great amount of 
diversity among the Hispanic population. Some Hispanics have lived in the 
States much longer than others. Some are more Americanized. All of this can 
have an impact on your marketing strategy.

19
 Chapter 1: Expanding Your Market
Revisit all of your marketing materials and decide what you need to do to 
make them more appealing to people from other cultures. In Chapter 5, we 
show you how to create a marketing campaign that has broad appeal. This 
includes making the following changes:
 
 Translating marketing materials into the language of your target 
consumers
 
 Removing anything that could offend the sensibilities of the cultures you 
want to attract, including cultural stereotypes
 
 Crafting ads directed at specific markets
 
 Communicating your commitment to family values
 
 Generating positive public relations in minority communities in your 
area and on the Internet
Reaching beyond marketing
Marketing can bring people through the doors or persuade them to call your 
office, but it can’t guarantee a sale. Everyone in your company needs to be 
prepared to accommodate the new customers who require assistance. If the 
customers don’t feel welcome at your place of business or feel that they’re 
not treated with sensitivity to their culture, they won’t buy from you. You 
can’t blame it on the marketing, even though many companies do just that.
 
In addition to changing your marketing, train your frontline staff to make them 
culturally competent. Make sure they know and practice the Global Rule — 
treating customers as those customers want to be treated rather than making 
assumptions (see the “Embracing the Global Rule” section earlier in this chap-
ter for more info). Studies show that people from every culture make purchas-
ing decisions based on how they’re treated.
In Chapter 6, we take you beyond multicultural marketing to show you how 
to build a comprehensive program that treats customers the way they want 
to be treated from initial contact to closing.
Tweaking your products 
and services . . . or not
Depending on what you sell, changing your marketing and packaging may 
not be enough to appeal to your multicultural clientele. You may need to 
make fundamental changes to your product line and the services you offer. 
To appeal to the increasing influx of Mexican immigrants, for example, many 

20
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
grocery stores around the United States have added a Mexican foods section. 
Likewise, pharmacies often carry selections of personal-care items that are 
more familiar to customers from various cultural backgrounds.
 
You may or may not need to change your product line or the services you 
offer, but you should certainly consider it. The best way to find out whether a 
change is in order is to be direct — survey your customers. When interacting 
with customers from other cultures, ask whether they found everything they 
were looking for. Ask whether they have any recommendations for products 
they would like to see you carry or services you could offer.
After you know what your customers want, it’s up to you to decide whether 
offering those new products and services is worth the effort. After conduct-
ing this research, the choice is up to you. See Chapter 7 for more details on 
offering in-demand products and services.
Mastering a new meet-and-greet strategy
Making a good first impression is of the utmost importance with any pro-
spective buyer, but it’s even more of a challenge when dealing with people 
from other cultures. Many cultures, for example, are simply uncomfortable 
with the standard handshake. In fact, any assumptions you make about how 
people want to be greeted may offend the other party and compromise your 
chances of making the sale.
 
In Chapter 8, we explain in great detail the do’s and don’ts of meeting and 
greeting people from other cultures, but if you’re looking for a quick tip to get 
you through the day until you can get around to reading Chapter 8, here it is: 
Wait for the customer to make the first move. If the customer reaches out to 
shake your hand, bows to you, or approaches you for a European kiss on the 
cheek, follow suit. Greeting customers as they like to be greeted is crucial for 
building positive relationships that lead to successful closings.
In Chapter 8, you also discover how the significance of eye contact varies 
around the world and what various forms of eye contact really mean. It can 
be just the opposite from what most Americans expect.
Adapting your sales presentation
As a salesperson, you’re already well aware of the fact that you have to com-
municate differently with different people. You speak one way to men and 
another way to women, one way to young customers and another to more 
mature individuals. In the same way, your presentation will be much more 
effective if you adjust it for different cultural groups. In Chapter 11, we pro-
vide details on how to adapt your sales presentation and techniques, but in 
general, you can expect to make the following adjustments:

21
 Chapter 1: Expanding Your Market
 
 Spend more time building relationships and trust (we devote Chapter 9 
to this topic).
 
 Educate consumers more on basic features and benefits of your prod-
ucts and services (don’t assume that your customers already know the 
basics).
 
 Adapt your presentation to learning styles that are more predominant in 
certain cultures.
 
 Become more family focused when dealing with clients and their children.
Many salespeople deliver a top-notch presentation but drop the ball during 
the follow-through. Because of their cultural illiteracy, they may misinterpret 
what the customer says or does as rejection, when the customer is really 
sending some strong buying signals. As a result, salespeople often fail to 
close sales with highly qualified buyers. For tips on picking up buying signals 
from multicultural clientele, check out Chapter 10. In Chapter 12, we reveal 
techniques for closing the sale.
Some people feel that working with multicultural customers requires more 
time than it’s worth. Hopefully, the people who feel this way are your com-
petitors, because you discover in Chapter 2 why being patient is well worth 
your time and effort.
Honing your negotiating skills 
for different cultures
Americans generally don’t like to haggle. We expect people to set a fair price 
for whatever they’re selling. If the price is too high, we don’t buy the product, 
we see if someone else is offering the same product for less, or we look for a 
less expensive version. We trust that healthy competition will keep prices in 
check. We shop. We don’t haggle.
Other cultures have transformed haggling into an art form. Merchants know-
ingly set prices a little high, realizing that customers are going to negotiate 
a lower price. When American salespeople meet people from these cultures, 
the salespeople quickly get flustered because the haggling never seems to 
end. In some cases, even after the customer signs off on the purchase, he still 
tries to negotiate a better deal!
 
As a salesperson who wants to sell to people from other cultures, you’d do 
well to acquire some self-defense maneuvers and become a black-belt nego-
tiator. Otherwise, you’ll see your commissions and company profits quickly 
disappear under the onslaught of constant haggling that’s common in some 
cultures. In Chapter 13, you can begin training to earn your black belt in sales 
negotiating.

22
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
Building your referral business
Referral business . . . ahhh! The dream of every salesperson on the planet is 
to have a business built exclusively on referrals. No cold calls. No advertis-
ing. Just kick back and watch the eager customers stream through your door.
Although selling to cross-cultural customers may take a bit more time and 
effort to bring customers up to speed on your products and services, you 
can expect a big payback in the form of referral business. When immigrants 
arrive in this country, they don’t know whom they can trust. They fear that 
merchants are going to take advantage of them because of their unfamiliarity 
with American products, services, and customs. So when they find a sales-
person they can trust, they’re quick to pass the word along to their friends 
and family members.
 
Not only does your superior service get you more referral business, but the 
referral customers already trust you, so you don’t need to spend as much time 
building relationships and consumer confidence. Customers arrive ready to buy.
In Chapter 15, we explore referral opportunities in greater depth and show 
you how and when to ask clients for referrals without seeming too pushy.
Building a Diversity-Friendly Business
Advertising how diversity friendly you are is useless if you don’t deliver 
diversity friendliness when your customers arrive. That would be like mar-
keting a hamburger joint as a five-star restaurant. As soon as the customers 
pulled up to the curb, they’d realize the farce and keep driving.
If you’re going to do diversity, do it right. Make sure your business and your staff 
communicate an openness to those from other cultures and a willingness to 
meet their needs. The following sections can get you started on the right track.
Modifying your store or office
Here’s a homework assignment for you: The next time you go grocery shop-
ping, jot down your grocery list as you normally do, but this time, take it to an 
ethnic grocery store and try to get everything on the list. If you are like most 
Americans, as you wander through the aisles, you probably feel the following:
 
 Unwelcome: You probably feel like you don’t belong. You are a minority. 
The owner and other shoppers are probably looking at you wondering 
what you’re doing here.

23
 Chapter 1: Expanding Your Market
 
 Confused: You don’t know where to look for the items you want because 
everything is arranged differently, the packaging is unfamiliar, and signs 
and labels may be in another language.
 
 Disappointed: The store doesn’t carry the products or brands you want. 
The selection seems limited.
Now you have an idea of how multicultural customers feel. If you don’t make 
some adjustments to your store or office to make it more culturally friendly, 
customers from other cultures are likely to feel uncomfortable when visiting 
your establishment.
 
In Chapter 7, we provide some tips and techniques you can implement to 
make your store or office more culturally friendly without turning off your tra-
ditional clientele. Simply put yourself in others’ shoes, realize what it is about 
your establishment that may make it feel foreign and intimidating, and then 
develop ways to make it more friendly, such as
 
 Adding signs in the languages that your customers speak
 
 Packaging products in a way that makes them more appealing to differ-
ent cultures
 
 Surveying customers to determine products and services they want and 
then adding these to your offerings
 
 Changing the décor to make your establishment feel more comfortable 
to other groups
Forming a multicultural sales team
Diversifying your sales force can make your business more appealing to cus-
tomers from other cultures. You don’t need to have Hispanic salespeople to 
work with Hispanic customers or Asians selling to Asians, but exhibiting an 
openness to other cultures can make everyone feel more welcome.
 
By embracing diversity not only in your customers but also when building 
your sales team, your business stands to reap several benefits:
 
 Customers from different cultures see that your business clearly values 
their culture and their people.
 
 A diverse sales staff can train one another on how to interact more effec-
tively with people from other cultures.
 
 If your sales team has multilingual salespeople, they can assist in com-
municating with customers who don’t speak English and in translating 
marketing materials.

24
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
Building and managing a multicultural sales team, including Caucasians, 
can be quite challenging. You often have to deal with different communica-
tion styles, deep-seated stereotypes, language barriers, counterproductive 
behaviors, and differences in how people view authority and make decisions. 
Although the benefits of having a multicultural sales team can be significant, 
you really need to develop the team with advanced planning and forethought 
if you want to realize those benefits. In Chapter 16, we show you how.
 
Failure to account for cultural differences when assembling a multicultural 
sales team can result in an increase in conflict, dissension, and mistrust, and a 
decrease in efficiency, productivity, and sales.
Extending diversity throughout 
your business
Your frontline staff are the greeters, receptionists, cashiers, and others who 
deal with prospective customers when they first arrive. These people are the 
face of your business. You can extend diversity to other parts of your busi-
ness as well, by hiring people from other cultures to fill other positions that 
aren’t as visible to customers and by purchasing goods and services from 
minority-owned businesses. The more you interact with a variety of people 
from other cultures, the more culturally aware you become and the more 
inroads you have into their communities.
Hiring and retaining people of color, however, is not quite the same as 
employing Anglo Americans. You have to make some fundamental changes 
in the way you recruit, hire, and manage people from other backgrounds to 
account for cultural nuances. Chapter 16 explains how to do this.
 
Everything you do to make yourself, your business, and your products more 
appealing to customers from other cultures requires time and effort. The same 
is true when it comes to finding, hiring, training, and retaining multicultural 
personnel. Most businesses that make the investment, however, discover that 
the long-term benefits far outweigh the costs.

Chapter 2
Realizing the Incredible Untapped 
Potential of the Multicultural 
Market
In This Chapter
 Gauging the purchasing power of your multicultural customers
 Recognizing the growing diversity in your markets
 Overcoming the assumption that ethnic customers shop only at ethnic stores
 Gaining a competitive edge in the multicultural marketplace
F
ar too many business owners and salespeople dismiss the multicul-
tural market for one reason or another without even trying to appeal 
to this growing marketplace opportunity. Many are completely unaware of 
the potential boost in sales and profits. Others are still in denial that the 
American economy has gone global. And still others falsely assume that 
people from other cultures prefer shopping at ethnic stores and buying from 
people who share their background.
This chapter explores the myths that surround multicultural sales opportu-
nities and shows you how you can gain an edge over competitors who are 
likely to be overlooking these opportunities themselves.
Taking the Pulse of Multicultural 
Purchasing Power with a Survey
Why bother trying to cater to the multicultural market? For the same reason 
that businesses exist in the first place: to make money (and the fact that if 
you really believe in your product, you want to introduce it to everybody). 
The multicultural market accounts for a total of $2 trillion in sales annually. 

26
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
More than 20 cents of every dollar in the United States is spent by multicul-
tural consumers, and that number is growing rapidly. Here’s how the spending 
breaks down by groups for 2007 (the last year for which statistics are available):
 
 $8,552 billion, European Americans
 
 $862 billion, Hispanic Americans
 
 $845 billion, African Americans
 
 $459 billion, Asian Americans
 
 $57 billion, Native Americans
Unless you’re selling all over the United States, these numbers aren’t likely 
to mean much to you. What you want to know is how much of every dollar 
being spent in your industry and your market is being spent by multicultural 
customers. Is it 20 cents of every dollar? More? Less?
Later in this chapter, in the section “Observing the Changing Face of Your 
Marketplace,” we encourage you to do some market research to gather spe-
cific numbers along with other data to create an accurate analysis of your 
market’s cultural makeup. One of the best, fastest, and least expensive ways 
to find out the profit potential of your multicultural marketplace, however, is 
to conduct a survey, as shown in the following sections.
Formulating general questions 
your survey should answer
Before you conduct any sort of market research, decide on the general types 
of information you want your survey to collect. You may want your survey, 
for example, to collect data that enables you to answer the following 
questions:
 
 What specific ethnic group or groups are in my service area?
 
 What sorts of products and services are they looking for or buying?
 
 Where are they currently getting the products and services they want 
or need?
 
 How do they shop for these products and services?
 
 Can I serve their needs without substantially lowering my profit margin?
 
 Are ethnic stores in the area already serving this market? If so, how will 
we be different from them?

27
 Chapter 2: Realizing the Potential of the Multicultural Market
 
As a salesperson, you probably know through firsthand experience that you 
have major groups of multicultural customers or prospects in your area, 
although you may not be aware of specifically where they’re from. One way to 
find out is simply to ask your existing customers, “Where are your ancestors 
from?” One word of caution: To avoid discriminating against anyone, it’s cru-
cial to ask every customer the same questions, not just those who appear to 
be “different” from you.
Asking questions about people’s place of origin not only provides you with 
valuable market information but also can lead to some very interesting con-
versations. Just think, by simply asking about people’s backgrounds you can 
take an around-the-world tour without losing one piece of luggage!
Opening your mind to the possibilities
To help you start to see the opportunities, here’s 
a list of businesses commonly frequented by 
multicultural customers and some of their more 
frequently requested products and services:
  Banks and credit unions: Loan and savings 
products that meet the needs of new immi-
grants, wire transfer services, and oper-
ating hours that match the community’s 
needs
  Car dealers: Vehicles with colors and 
options that appeal to ethnic consumers
  Equipment rental companies: Tents, stages, 
stoves, and equipment for ethnic weddings 
and other celebrations
  Food stores: Specialty foods that appeal to 
different cultures
  Hair salons: People who know how to cut, 
style, and care for ethnic hair
  Healthcare providers: Culturally competent 
and sensitive doctors, nurses, and staff who 
are aware that different cultures tend to 
have different health issues and concerns
  Hotels: Rooms and amenities that make 
multicultural travelers feel at home
  Insurance companies: Home, auto, and life 
protection products that meet the needs of 
multicultural clients
  New-home builders: Homes that appeal to 
the unique needs of multicultural customers
  Party supply stores: Supplies and decora-
tions for ethnic weddings and other cel-
ebrations
  Real estate companies: Agents who know 
how to find homes that appeal to different 
ethnic groups
  Restaurants: Country-specific foods (such 
as stir-fry dishes, sushi, fajitas, and vegetar-
ian dishes) and drinks (such as beers, wines, 
tapioca-flavored beverages, and more) that 
multicultural customers may want
  Tour companies: Visits to sites that people 
from other countries may be interested in 
seeing, including universities, religious 
sites, museums, and parks

Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
Developing your questionnaire
The purpose of a survey is to determine when and where customers shop 
for products or services that are the same or similar to those that you offer. 
For example, one survey of people who purchased ethnic produce in the past 
year showed that about half shopped for ethnic foods once a week, nearly 40 
percent shopped more than once a week, and only 20 percent shopped less 
frequently than once a month. This is why so many ethnic grocery stores are 
springing up around the country!
Following are some questions to get your survey started:
 
 Where do you shop for X products (or services)?
 
 How frequently do you purchase these products (or services)?
 
 How much do you typically spend on these products (or services) in a 
month?
In the following sections, we provide sample questions for several important 
survey topics, including business hours, staffing, inventory, travel time, and 
pricing. You can use the information from your survey to improve your prod-
uct or service for multicultural customers.
Business hours, staffing, inventory, and customer service
To determine your hours of operation, the proper level of staffing, the inven-
tory needed to cater to a multicultural clientele, and the level of service they 
expect, consider asking the following questions:
 
 Do you purchase these products (or services) more in the spring, 
summer, fall, or winter?
 
 What products (or services) do you wish we carried (or offered) that we 
currently do not?
 
 What one thing could we do to better serve you?
 
 Do you tend to shop more during the week or on weekends?
 
 Do you tend to shop more in the morning, afternoon, or evening?
Willingness to travel farther
 
Knowing how far prospective customers are willing to travel to obtain the 
products and services you offer can help you determine the sales potential 
that various groups represent. Most multicultural customers look for busi-
nesses that are within a 10-mile radius of their home or office, but they’ll 
travel 20 miles or more, if necessary, to find what they want. So the farther 

29
 Chapter 2: Realizing the Potential of the Multicultural Market
people are willing to travel to your business, the bigger your untapped multi-
cultural market. To gauge how far people are willing to travel, ask the follow-
ing questions:
 
 How far would you travel to obtain X products (or services)?
 
 How likely would you be to change to a different supplier if a closer one 
were available?
Willingness to pay more
Almost all customers are likely to pay a premium for products and services 
that they want but can’t obtain conveniently, although it can be tricky to get 
them to admit that they would be willing to pay more. To find out whether 
prospective customers would be willing to pay a premium for your product 
or service, consider adding the following questions to your survey:
 
 If X products (or services) were offered locally, would you be willing to 
pay a little more for them?
 
 If so, how much more?
 
A survey of ethnic food shoppers found that about half of the respondents 
would be willing to pay a premium for ethnic produce. Twenty-five percent of 
respondents said they would pay up to a 5 percent premium, with another 14 
percent saying they would pay up to 10 percent more to obtain the groceries 
they wanted. Your results are likely to vary based on the following:
 
 Income level: Obviously, the more money people earn, the more able 
they are to pay a premium to get what they want.
 
 Gender: Studies show that women are more likely to pay a premium for 
ethnic products than are men.
 
 Ethnicity: Some cultures may be more willing to pay a little extra to get 
what they want depending on locality and type of product.
Creating or buying a mailing list
So who should you survey about what products and services to provide and 
what you should charge? The easiest place to start is in your own backyard. 
Do you have a mailing list of your current customers? If not, now is a good 
time to develop one, assuming you have a fair number of customers from 
other cultures. (If you have very few or no such customers, you can purchase 
a mailing list, as explained later in this section.) Gather the following informa-
tion from your existing customers:

30
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
 Customer name
 
 Spouse or partner’s name
 
 Mailing address
 
 E-mail address
 
 Birthday
 
 Anniversary
 
 Children’s names
 
 Favorite item they buy from you
 
 Season, day of the week, and time of day they usually buy
 
 How they usually pay (cash, check, or credit card)
 
 Why they buy from you (price, selection, and so on)
 
Collect this information from all of your customers, not only your multicul-
tural customers. Otherwise, you’ll create the impression that you’re singling 
out certain individuals or groups. Provide your frontline sales staff with a 
stack of cards and have them ask customers whether they’ve filled one out 
yet. Provide an incentive to your frontline sales staff to collect completed 
cards and to your customers for taking the time to fill them out. Holding a 
contest for staff and a prize drawing for customers usually works well.
If you haven’t collected information from your customers, consider contact-
ing a mailing list broker in your area. A broker often can provide mailing lists 
that group people by ethnicity. Call and ask for their “list of lists,” which 
shows all the categories of names they maintain. Many list brokers provide 
information based on census data, which can identify people by race. Some 
can provide Hispanic surnamed households, and others may have identified 
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other specific Asian groups.
Conducting your survey
After you have your questionnaire and a mailing list, conducting your survey 
is a simple matter of stuffing envelopes, mailing out your questionnaires, and 
then entering the results into a spreadsheet or database program.
 
To increase the response rate for your questionnaire, include a self-addressed, 
stamped envelope, making it free and easy for recipients to respond. You can 
also increase your response rate by rewarding respondents with something 
like a coupon for a discount on their next purchase or entering their name into 
a drawing for an attractive prize.

 Chapter 2: Realizing the Potential of the Multicultural Market
Observing the Changing Face 
of Your Marketplace
No matter where you live, work, and sell, you’ve likely seen the face of your 
marketplace change over the past few years. Your customer base may be 
aging, or you may be experiencing an influx of customers from a younger 
generation. Perhaps a higher percentage of your customers are now women, 
or maybe you’re seeing a growing population of Hispanics.
Whatever changes are occurring, having a firm grip on trends related to pop-
ulation, economy, public opinion, family structure, and consumer behavior is 
essential for effective strategic planning. Although changes in demographics, 
economic conditions, and sociological trends can’t accurately predict the 
future, they do allow you to forecast a variety of potential developments. In 
the following sections, we show you how to evaluate changes in your market 
and begin adapting to those changes.
 
Just because you may not see a steady stream of multicultural customers flow-
ing into your store or office on a daily basis doesn’t mean they aren’t living 
and doing business in your area. Perhaps they simply steer clear of you and 
your store or office because they don’t feel comfortable doing business with 
you or you don’t offer what they want. Also, even if your market research 
shows that people of few cultures live and work in the area you serve, people 
outside of your service area may represent a substantial market. As we explain 
earlier in this chapter, many people will drive a long way to get the products 
or services they want and need from someone they trust.
Researching the cultural composition 
of your service area
Whether you’re a business owner or a salesperson, you’re well aware of the 
need to know the people who are buying your products and services — who 
they are, what they buy, how they shop, and how they prefer to pay for stuff. 
You may know, for example, that allowing people to pay with credit cards 
can boost your business.
To develop a multicultural marketing and sales strategy that’s both effective 
and profitable requires that you have a good sense of your marketplace’s 
cultural makeup. In the following sections, we reveal various ways you can 
gather the necessary data.

32
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
Getting free data from the Census Bureau
Why pay for data if you can get it for free? One of the easiest (and cheap-
est) places to obtain demographic data is the U.S. Census Bureau Web site 
at www.census.gov. With a click of a computer mouse, you can check the 
national, state, county, and even city populations of various groups, including 
Hispanics, Blacks (African Americans as well as Kenyans, Nigerians, Haitians, 
and others), Asians (people from the Far East, Southeast Asia, and the Indian 
subcontinent), Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders, and American 
Indian and native Alaskans. The Bureau also tracks the total number of immi-
grants from almost all the European and Middle Eastern countries.
Paying for professional reports
You can hire professional market research organizations to assist you in 
determining the cultural composition of your service area and its potential 
impact on your business. A custom report may cost as much as $10,000, 
depending on the amount of data you request and the level of analysis. A 
custom report can usually provide information on any area of the country 
you specify. Following are several companies that may be able to assist you 
with your research (this information was accurate at the time of writing):

You may be able to save a considerable amount of money if a market research 
company already has generated a report for your industry and geographic 
area. Shop around to try to find a company that has already done the work for 
someone else, but make sure the report isn’t more than 6 to 12 months old; 
otherwise, the data may be too dated to be of value. Simply contact any of 
the companies listed in this section and ask whether they already have a 
report for the targeted demographic in your market. You can also contact the 
trade association for your industry for recommendations of market research 
companies.
Automating your analysis with market research software
Some market research companies not only gather and deliver demographic 
data to your doorstep, but they also provide you with software that enables 
you to analyze that data in various ways (for a fee, of course). Here’s just 
some of the information and analyses such software can deliver:
 
 Demographic estimates and forecasts: Outlines characteristics of differ-
ent populations and how they’re expected to change in the future.
 
 Demographic software and mapping: Enables you to circle a street on a 
map to obtain detailed data on the people who live there.

34
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
 Custom data development: Provides any information you want in any 
format you want; you supply the data.
 
 Location analysis: Gives you any demographic information you want 
about a specific location.
 
 Trend analysis: What tendencies are developing in your service area?
 
 Market analysis: What is the current composition of your customers?
 
 Sales potential analysis: What possible opportunities exist?

Painting a portrait of your typical 
multicultural customer
The ultimate goal of market research (including the data you collect by 
conducting your own surveys, as we describe earlier in this chapter) is to 
develop an accurate customer profile. This is a detailed portrait of who your 
typical multicultural customer is: What specific culture are they from? Who 
makes the purchasing decisions in the family? Where do they live? What 
are the major income levels of these customers? What specific products 
and services do they look for?
After you’ve developed an accurate customer profile, you need to determine 
whether this market segment is large enough to be profitable and if it is, what 
you need to do to begin tapping into this market. You can accomplish this by 
answering the following questions:
 
 What is the average purchase per person?
 
 How often do they buy?
 
 Are they seasonal or regular shoppers?
 
 What’s our profit margin on this basket of goods?
 
 How does our selection of products and services compare to those who 
are already serving this market?

35
 Chapter 2: Realizing the Potential of the Multicultural Market
 
 What products could we up-sell (offer accessories or other items) to 
these customers?
 
 Where do they currently shop?
 
 Do they purchase by cash or credit?
 
 Do they buy out of necessity or choice?
 
 What aspects of the product do they value?
To answer some of these questions, simply crunch the numbers by using 
your handy-dandy spreadsheet program (or call your accountant to do it 
for you). To answer some of the more complex questions, you need to trust 
the force — use the data you collected to formulate an educated guess as 
to whether a particular group’s business is worth pursuing. One of the best 
questions to ask yourself at this point is whether you can afford not to 
pursue a particular market — are you willing to hand the business to your 
competitors?
Enlisting current clients to help 
you gain a competitive edge
Dissatisfied customers are notorious for remaining unhappy but never saying 
or doing anything to improve the situation. Just think of how many people 
you know who refuse to eat at certain restaurants because they had one bad 
experience but never said a word to their server or to management. Getting 
your customers to open up about their experience with you and how they 
think you can improve that experience is like striking gold, especially when 
you’re trying to establish yourself in the multicultural marketplace.
Studies show that Hispanics are the least likely to complain about poor 
service to the management or staff. The bad news is that they’re most likely 
to tell their friends and family not to do business with the company that 
provided it.
Talk to your multicultural patrons and ask them what you need to do to make 
them, and others like them, more comfortable. Consider doing surveys, as we 
explain in the earlier section “Taking the Pulse of Multicultural Purchasing 
Power with a Survey,” to gather additional data.
 
Encourage your frontline employees to gather information directly from cus-
tomers. If you’re using surveys, offer an incentive for each completed survey 
they collect. One company has a board full of balloons containing cash and 
gives its staff members one dart for every fully filled-in questionnaire they 
obtain. At the weekly staff meeting, they get to pop balloons for $1, $5, $10, 
$20 bills, or more. This is not only fun, exciting, and immediately rewarding, 
but it also reminds everyone to ask customers to fill out the survey.

36
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
Consider developing your own personal advisory board composed of trusted 
individuals and customers with diverse backgrounds — people who know 
your industry and the customers you’re trying to reach. This group may con-
sist of your accountant, attorney, a chamber of commerce representative, 
multicultural marketing experts, community leaders, travel agents, ethnic 
restaurant owners, and several customers from different backgrounds. Your 
advisory board can keep you abreast of developments in the local area as well 
as offer ideas for breaking into new markets.
Avoiding the temptation to lump people together
Regardless of how you collect market data, 
be careful not to make gross generalizations 
regarding certain racial or ethnic groups. Many 
of the “macro” groups, such as Hispanics, 
Blacks, and Asians, are comprised of numerous 
“micro” groups. Consider the following:
  At least six major groups call themselves 
Hispanic or Latino: Mexicans, South 
Americans, Central Americans, Cubans, 
Puerto Ricans, and Spaniards. Each is 
distinct and unique. For instance, not all 
Latinos speak the same Spanish; some 
may not even speak Spanish at all. People 
in many parts of Spain speak Catalan which 
is somewhat similar to Spanish yet distinct 
and different. In Brazil, most people speak 
Portuguese.
  At least 17 separate and distinct subcul-
tures comprise the people Americans 
call Asians, including Chinese, Japanese, 
Koreans, Filipinos, Thais, and Vietnamese. 
They don’t speak the same languages, eat 
the same foods, or share similar cultural 
practices and beliefs. In fact, a Chinese 
person may be quite insulted if you mistake 
her as being from Japan or Korea, and vice 
versa.
  Speaking of Asians, many people don’t 
consider people from India to be Asians, 
even though they live in Asia, right across 
the border from China. Furthermore, you 
never want to confuse Asian Indians with 
Pakistanis or other groups of Asians. India 
and Pakistan have had an uneasy relation-
ship for centuries. One of the reasons is 
that they have religious differences — the 
majority of Indians are Hindu, whereas 
most Pakistanis are Muslim. Another gulf 
between the two groups is language — 
Indians primarily speak Hindi, whereas 
Pakistanis generally speak Urdu.
  Blacks can be African American or people 
from Africa, Jamaica, Haiti, or any of a 
hundred other locations around the world. 
Obviously, African Americans have their 
own preferences for food, music, and 
entertainment and have little in common 
with Black immigrants, say from Kenya 
or Ethiopia. Their needs are also different 
when it comes to items such as clothing, 
cars, and other products.
To further complicate the issue, the length of 
time someone has been in the United States 
can impact their buying habits, preferences, 
and other behaviors. The more acculturated a 
person becomes, the more she tends to con-
form to mainstream consumption patterns. 
New, first-generation immigrants, for example, 
are likely to have vastly different preferences 
than their children — the second generation, 
born and raised in their new country. This can 
make a huge difference in how you may have to 
adjust to your customers’ needs.

37
 Chapter 2: Realizing the Potential of the Multicultural Market
Customizing products and services 
for the multicultural marketplace
Adjusting the way you market and sell products and services is nearly use-
less if the products and services you’re selling aren’t what your customers 
need or want. You also have to adjust your line of products and services to 
meet your target market’s demands. Following are some examples of the 
types of changes you may want to consider:
 
 Although goat meat isn’t commonly found in most American grocery 
stores, it’s a staple for many people from Africa, the former Soviet 
Union, and Yugoslavia.
 
 Ethnic families tend to be larger than Caucasian families (yes, even 
Catholic Caucasian families), so many home builders are designing 
homes with more bedrooms.
 
 Cosmetics must be formulated for unique skin colors and types. Some 
cosmetic manufacturers have departments specifically responsible for 
developing products for different cultural groups.
 
 Hair salons must be aware of differences in cutting and styling the hair 
of various ethnic groups and also must carry products that are familiar 
to these groups. Asian Indians, for example, prefer their hair to be cut 
with scissors rather than electric shears.
Ditching the cookie-cutter franchise approach
If you’re part of a franchise, the franchisor prob-
ably provided you with a template for operating 
your business. Unfortunately, although these 
business templates are usually comprehen-
sive enough for running an efficient business, 
they almost never address how to be sensitive 
to people from diverse cultures. You want to 
customize your operations to meet the special 
needs of the customers in your area.
It’s not good enough for grocery stores, for 
example, to have a Hispanic or Asian foods 
section. If this were sufficient, you wouldn’t see 
so many ethnic grocery stores springing up in 
many parts of the country. For instance, Arizona 
has more than 60 Food City stores that cater 
specifically to ethnic markets. These stores not 
only provide the foods specific groups want, but 
they also make an effort to hire employees who 
reflect their target customers, assure that their 
store layouts are comfortable for them, and 
aim promotions and sponsored events toward 
multicultural consumers.
The cookie-cutter approach to running a suc-
cessful business in the United States is becom-
ing less and less effective, particularly as the 
marketplace becomes more diverse. Do your 
research and customize your sales, marketing, 
and product line to appeal to the unique needs 
of your customers.

38
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
 Many ethnic communities are attracted to fresh produce. In areas with 
large numbers of Caribbean Island residents, you’ll find breadfruits, 
plantains, cherimoyas, and mangos. In areas with many Chinese families, 
you’ll commonly see bok choy or Chinese cabbage.
 
 Unlike many Caucasians, Latinos love to go grocery shopping. They 
spend twice the time per visit (on average) as non-Hispanic consumers. 
The same is true of Asians. A smart grocer knows this is an opportunity 
to sell more than just food items to these customers. In many ethnic gro-
cery stores, you’ll find clothing, jewelry, over-the-counter medications, 
and other nonfood-related items.
 
 More and more Caucasians are starting to shop at ethnic stores. If 
you’re a retailer who’s not offering multicultural merchandise, you could 
be missing out on a golden opportunity to expand sales into both mar-
kets. Americans of all ethnic backgrounds are becoming more sophisti-
cated in their tastes and are increasingly using international ingredients 
in their dishes and other products in their homes.
 
 Banks and insurance companies are beginning to tailor their products to 
meet the unique demands of specific ethnicities.
 
 Studies show that the most popular color for cars in Japan and Mexico 
is white. In China, buyers tend to prefer black or silver. In South Korea 
and Brazil, the most popular color for cars is silver. In addition, many 
Asians tend to feel that an automatic transmission is essential but air 
conditioning is a frill. Car dealers may want to consider these and other 
facts when stocking their inventory.
 
 Hospitals are teaching their nurses and doctors new methods for provid-
ing culturally competent healthcare.
 
Any salesperson and company can increase sales to multicultural customers 
by figuring out their preferences and accommodating them. Start collecting 
data about the preferences of multicultural customers in your industry and 
market, as we explain earlier in this chapter, and then make the adjustments 
necessary to appeal to your clientele. See Chapter 7 for more details on adapt-
ing your product or service for diverse clientele.
Realizing the Edge You Have over 
Ethnic Stores and Salespeople
When you start seeing ethnic stores popping up all over the landscape, 
it’s tempting to throw in the towel. After all, how can you possibly compete 
with businesses designed from the ground up to cater to the needs of ethnic 
consumers?

39
 Chapter 2: Realizing the Potential of the Multicultural Market
For the reasons we provide in the following sections, this type of defeatist 
thinking is wrongheaded. You can never assume that an ethnic customer 
prefers shopping at an ethnic business or buying from an ethnic salesperson. 
In fact, people from many cultures actually prefer dealing with someone who 
doesn’t share their cultural background.
Wide selection and fair 
prices trump ethnicity
The main reason that people patronize ethnic businesses is not because 
“one of their own” runs the business or works there. Multicultural customers 
patronize these businesses primarily for two reasons:
 
 Selection: The business offers the products and services the person 
wants or needs. Whether it’s a video rental or grocery store, these spe-
cialty shops cater to what their customers want.
 
 Price: Products and services are offered at a competitive price — not 
necessarily a low price, but competitive in relation to how accessible 
the product or service is. If you want a loaf of Jamaican Easter bread, for 
example, you can expect to pay more than $12 a loaf!
 
Ambience also plays a role in where customers shop. Many ethnic stores have 
a small-market feel, because that’s what customers are used to back home. 
Check out Chapter 7 for tips on how to give your store or office a friendly feel.
Customers’ craving for a wide selection is almost universal, and it gives you 
a potential edge over small ethnic stores that often offer a limited selection 
of goods. According to Hispanic American Central, for example, 84 percent of 
Hispanic women prefer to buy their groceries from traditional supermarket 
chains. Another survey of customers who regularly shop for ethnic food indi-
cated that approximately three quarters of those who purchased produce 
shopped at more than one store for their ethnic produce because of limited 
selection.
Many other establishments are known to cater to different ethnicities, including 
Russian bakeries, French laundries, kosher meat stores, and other businesses 
that make a good living in the specialty markets. If these businesses can survive 
and thrive, what specialty items could you sell to attract a wider clientele?
As a merchant who caters to a wider market than ethnic stores do, you may 
even be able to purchase in bulk and offer your products at more competitive 
prices. Sometimes simply offering everything your customers need in a single 
location makes you more competitive in terms of price. If your customers 
have to travel to three stores to do their weekly shopping, they’re wasting a 
lot of time and money.

40
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
Ethnic people don’t always 
prefer ethnic businesses
Assuming that people of a certain ethnicity prefer ethnic stores is like assum-
ing that all Czech or Slovak people love to listen to polka music. The fact is 
that ethnic businesses may have several things working against them:
 
 Limited selection, as discussed in the preceding section
 
 Poor location — out of the way or maybe not in the best part of town
 
 Limited parking
 
 Ethnic business owners who may be more likely to leak information 
about a customer’s buying habits to the community
 
Your store or office can often be more competitive than a comparable ethnic 
store in convenience, selection, price, and service. How? Here are a few ideas:
 
 Ethnic stores tend to be rather small operations and not very Internet 
savvy. To gain a competitive edge, develop a Web site where custom-
ers can get the most out of their shopping experience online or off. See 
Chapter 5 for details.
 
 Consider rewarding your customers for their loyalty. Offering discounts 
on large purchases or bonus bucks that customers can use toward pur-
chases is often enough to show your appreciation. If several of your cus-
tomers have young children, sponsoring a fair or a day at a local park or 
amusement park can be a real perk, in addition to making your clients 
feel like they’re part of the family.
 
 Finding a new customer costs almost three times as much as keeping an 
existing customer. Repeat customers also tend to buy twice as much as 
new customers, because after they have bought from you, the barriers 
to purchasing (fear and mistrust) have been lowered. In addition, repeat 
customers often lead to referral customers.
 
 How often have you received a birthday card from a salesperson or 
store? Southwest Airlines does this without fail. What would this kind of 
gesture say about you?
 
 Many ethnic people shop at establishments and buy from salespeople 
who support their community. If you donate to local charities, let your 
customers know by posting the charity’s fliers in your windows or plac-
ing “Proud sponsor of . . .” at the bottom of your local newspaper ads. 
Chapter 5 has details on how to make a name for your business in your 
community.

41
 Chapter 2: Realizing the Potential of the Multicultural Market
Ethnic customers may steer 
clear of ethnic salespeople
Salespeople often falsely assume that ethnic customers have a strong prefer-
ence for working with salespeople from their own culture. Chinese prefer 
to buy from Chinese, Polish prefer to buy from Polish, and so on. Evidence 
proves that this isn’t so. The truth is that unless a tremendous language bar-
rier exists, many customers don’t care about the cultural background of their 
salesperson. What they want is a salesperson who’s sensitive to their culture. 
Of course, as we explain in Chapter 16, having a staff member on hand from 
the culture you’re trying to serve can’t hurt; it also can help make everyone 
in your business a little more culturally competent and your customers a 
little more comfortable.
In fact, some customers may deliberately look for a salesperson who isn’t 
from their culture. They may be concerned that if they’re negotiating with 
someone from their own culture, that person may know all of their bargaining 
tricks and techniques, so they may not get the best deal. Many conclude 
that negotiating with someone who is more naïve is the best way to get a 
good deal.
Another common trait of some ethnic groups (Asians and Hispanics, for 
example) is that they tend to be very private about their financial affairs. A 
common belief in these cultures is that if you share personal financial infor-
mation with people from your own culture, they may disclose it to others in 
their community.
 
If an ethnic customer approaches you, don’t automatically assume that he 
would prefer a salesperson of his same ethnicity. Unless he seems extremely 
uncomfortable with you or his own ability to speak English, treat him like any 
other customer, but always be on the lookout for signs that his culture may 
influence the transaction. If you treat your customers with sensitivity to their 
culture, they’ll be happy to buy from you, regardless of your ethnic back-
ground. Part III gives you a crash course on the cross-cultural sales process.
Watching Your Competitors: 
Are They Adapting?
Part of your role as a salesperson or business owner is to constantly keep an 
eye on what the competition is up to. (Ideally, you want to be keeping an eye 
on them in your rearview mirror.) What products are they carrying? What 

42
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
services are they offering? What is their pricing structure? In the new global 
economy, you must also know if and how they’re adapting to multicultural 
influences in your marketplace.
In the following sections, we reveal effective strategies for using what you 
discover from the competition to improve your appeal to the multicultural 
clientele in your area.
 
Businesses similar to yours may not be your only competition. Anyone who 
competes for the same consumer dollars that you do is your competition. 
Video games, movies, television, live theater, sporting events, musical 
concerts, and amusement parks, for example, all vie for the money people 
spend on leisure activities. At first glance, they may not seem related, but a 
closer look shows they obviously are. Keep this in mind when doing your 
competitive analysis.
Using competitive intelligence (and 
avoiding industrial espionage)
 
The mere mention of competitive analysis conjures up images of corporate 
spies stealing insider information, but competitive intelligence or analysis 
differs from industrial espionage:
 
 Competitive intelligence is a legitimate way to gather publicly acces-
sible information (from Web sites, corporate publications, patent fil-
ings, annual reports, advertisements, press releases, and onsite store 
visits) to determine another company’s strengths and weaknesses and 
see what it’s planning. Large companies often have entire departments 
devoted to gathering information about competitors. You can certainly 
do the same on a smaller scale.
 
 Industrial espionage can involve electronic surveillance, theft of trade 
secrets, bribery, blackmail, and other unlawful activities.
 
 Before becoming an industry supersleuth, familiarize yourself with the 
Economic Espionage Act (www.economicespionage.com/EEA.html) 
that governs the legalities of gathering competitive intelligence.
Businesses and organizations are becoming increasingly transparent as they 
attempt to conform to disclosure laws and regulations, and market them-
selves and their products and services on the Web (via Web sites and blogs). 
Some companies even allow their employees to launch their own blogs to 
broadcast to the world what the company is doing now and planning for the 
future.

43
 Chapter 2: Realizing the Potential of the Multicultural Market
You can gather an incredible amount of useful competitive intelligence 
simply by knowing where to look:
 
 Businesses or stores: Visit your competitors’ businesses and act like a 
customer to see what ethnic products and services they may offer, their 
prices, the amount of ethnic traffic they receive, and other pertinent 
issues.
 
 Web sites and blogs: Most businesses and many salespeople have their 
own Web site or blog and often post annual reports, press releases, and 
advertisements. They may also offer an area where customers can post 
comments about the level of service received as well as reviews of the 
company’s products.
 
 Google and other Internet search tools: You can search for new devel-
opments in your industry, price ranges for products you sell, which 
products and services your competitors offer, and more. Look for
industry-specific directories, databases, archives, and search engines, 
which you can use to conduct research on companies, industries, and 
business publications.
 
 Commercial research reports: You can purchase market research that 
provides economic and competitive analysis, but always check first 
to see if comparable information is already available for free on the 
Internet. You just need to be willing to invest the time required to search 
for it.
 
 Frontline staff: Receptionists, cashiers, and other personnel who work 
directly with customers can be a tremendous source of information. 
Clients and vendors don’t feel intimidated by receptionists and often 
share information with them that they would never think of sharing 
with a salesperson or manager. Clear the route for your frontline staff 
to deliver to you any information they pick up. Tell your staff the kind 
of information you want, such as complaints, compliments, questions, 
concerns, and requests for products or services you don’t currently 
offer. Some companies have a monthly contest for the best piece of data 
provided by staff with a nice prize as a reward.
 
 Some savvy businesses deliberately keep clients and vendors waiting for 
10 to 15 minutes in the reception area just to increase the chances the 
receptionist may overhear valuable conversations.
 
 All staff: Enlist the assistance of everyone in your organization. 
Encourage them to share any competitor ads, fliers, or other marketing 
materials they come across. If they have friends or family who shop at 
stores that are similar to yours, ask them to complete a short question-
naire about why they choose one establishment over another, what 
products they buy, and so on.

44
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
 Key individuals: Develop relationships with key people who can help 
you, including community or religious leaders, top people in your local 
chamber of commerce, major suppliers, multicultural marketing experts, 
diversity consultants, journalists, and even well-connected customers. 
Building relationships with experts can keep you ahead of opportuni-
ties that may be developing for your business. Again, if they are a part 
of your advisory board (see the earlier section “Enlisting current clients 
to help you gain a competitive edge” for details), you already have this 
relationship.
 
Don’t fall victim to paralysis by analysis. Instead of spending all of your time 
gathering and analyzing your competitive intelligence, spend some time plan-
ning and then executing your plan to make your business more competitive. In 
Chapters 6 and 7, we show you how to build a strong foundation.
Staying a step ahead of the competition
Chess masters are superior players because they don’t simply think about 
their next move. They think about their opponent’s next five moves and their 
own next five or ten moves for gaining a strategic edge. In the same way, you 
must outthink your competitors. Put yourself in their shoes and ask: How are 
they going to adapt? What are they likely to do to gain market share?
Most companies start with baby steps. They may modify their marketing 
materials, add a couple of products or services, or devote a section to their 
stores that caters specifically to a certain ethnicity. These small changes 
usually fall short and can even drive prospective customers away; customers 
may view these changes as token gestures rather than a true commitment 
to them. This is why a supermarket’s ethnic foods section has little impact 
on deterring large ethnic food stores from successfully entering the same 
marketplace.
To assist you in predicting what your competitors may attempt in an effort 
to outdo you, consider the following factors that customers often deem most 
important:
 
 Price
 
 Selection
 
 Brand names in stock
 
 Delivery times
 
 Installation services
 
 Warranty (including period and what’s covered)

45
 Chapter 2: Realizing the Potential of the Multicultural Market
 
 Language capabilities of staff
 
 Credit terms available
 
 Return policy
 
 Location (convenience, parking, and multiple locations)
 
 Appropriate atmosphere
 
 Hours of operation
 
 Knowledgeable and experienced staff
 
 Personalized services
 
 Customer education
 
To stay several steps ahead of the competition, focus on as many items in 
this list as possible. If your competitors are focusing only on price and selec-
tion, while you are focusing on price, selection, hours of operation, attractive 
return policies, and personalized services, you are going to win.
 
Competing on price alone is a loser’s strategy that requires no talent, skill, 
or planning. In fact, customers are often willing to pay a premium for conve-
nience and quality customer service. You may want to use a few popular prod-
ucts and services as loss leaders in a strategy to up-sell other products, but if 
your entire business becomes a loss leader, you’ll soon go out of business or 
be so disappointed that you’ll wish you were out of business. One of the most 
effective ways to beat your competition is by adjusting your sales presenta-
tions, as we outline in Chapter 11.
Competing with ethnic businesses
 
The overall strategy for competing successfully with ethnic businesses is no 
different than the strategy for competing with nonethnic businesses: offer cus-
tomers more of what they want and need. Following are some ideas on how to 
implement this strategy to compete specifically with ethnic businesses:
 
 Increase your selection. Ethnic stores usually do a great job offering 
specialty products, but ethnic customers often prefer one-stop shop-
ping. Immigrants, in particular, are very time conscious because they 
work long hours, so they appreciate having all of their needs met at a 
single location.
 
 Offer convenient hours. You may need to stay open on nights and week-
ends when ethnic customers have time to shop. Your research can help 
you determine your potential customers’ normal work hours so you can 
plan to be open when they’re available to buy.

46
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
 Strengthen relationships. What all people often value most is relation-
ships. If you can see your customers as more than just “transactions” 
and build deeper interactions, they’re likely to be more loyal to you. Get 
to know their names, what cultures they hail from, what their unique 
needs are, and more. Everyone likes being treated like they’re special 
and not just a number.
After gathering your competitive intelligence and analyzing it, you may real-
ize that you simply can’t compete with a particular ethnic business in your 
area. In such cases, you have two options:
 
 Take what you can get. Do your best to attract as many multicultural 
customers as possible, but remain on the lookout for opportunities to 
capture more ethnic business. The business environment can change 
quickly. As long as you continue to do your homework, you remain in a 
strong position to capitalize on any changes.
 
 If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. Perhaps you can set up an arrangement 
where you refer customers to an ethnic store for items you don’t carry 
and they do the same for you. Heck, it never hurts to ask.

Chapter 3
Assessing Your Cross-Cultural 
Sales Readiness
In This Chapter
 Getting in touch with any cultural bias you may have
 Assessing your existing cross-cultural selling skill set
 Developing an international perspective
A
 large part of becoming a master of the multicultural marketplace con-
sists of becoming a master of your own thoughts and behaviors. The 
culture in which you grew up may be so deeply ingrained within you that 
you begin to think that differences in other cultures are peculiar at best and 
perhaps even wrong.
If you want to increase your sales with multicultural consumers, you have 
to unlearn some of what your own culture has taught you and replace that 
knowledge with accurate information about other cultures.
In this chapter, we attempt to increase your awareness of what your culture 
has taught you, test your multicultural aptitude, and offer suggestions about 
how to adapt to the realities you’re likely to experience in other cultures.
Analyzing Your Own Cultural Lens
Every individual has a unique cultural perspective, even if the person hap-
pens to have an identical twin. This perspective is the product of how the 
person was raised, what she was taught, what she read, and everything she 
observed and experienced. You aren’t born with a cultural perspective; 
it’s something you gain from experience, and what you have experienced 
throughout your life influences how you interact with others.

48
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
To begin your journey of adapting to meet the needs of customers from diverse 
cultures, you need to have a firm grasp of your own feelings and beliefs. This 
enables you to begin to recognize that you don’t have to be governed by your 
beliefs and behaviors if they’re innately different from those of people from 
other cultures. The differences arise primarily because of what you and others 
were taught growing up.
In the following sections, we assist you in getting in touch with the American 
cultural perspective and any cultural biases you may have. By first acknowl-
edging where you are, right now, you have a clearer idea of the challenges 
you may need to overcome.
Recognizing the American perspective
Americans, especially those who never travel to other countries or have 
the opportunity to mingle with people from other cultures, tend to have a 
somewhat limited view of the world and how people should look and act. Just 
remember the first time someone handed you a pair of chopsticks and told 
you that people in some countries use them to eat their meals. You probably 
thought it was a joke or that people who ate with chopsticks were weird. 
Were they completely unaware of the existence of forks and spoons?
You don’t see this so much in Europe and other areas of the world where 
neighboring countries are so close. France, for example, is surrounded by the 
United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, 
Andorra, and Monaco. Europeans are reminded on a daily basis that people 
from other countries and cultures not only exist but are a quick Euro Rail 
ride away. (Of course, Europe, as a whole, tends to have its own Eurocentric 
perspective, too, as the Holy Roman Empire proved.)
Having a limited world view is natural for people who are somewhat isolated 
from other cultures, regardless of whether they live in the United States, 
Canada, Europe, Asia, or anywhere else in the world. However, this limited 
view can affect the size of your paycheck when it restricts your ability to 
communicate and do business with others.
To understand how limited your world perspective may be and how it can 
negatively affect your relationships with customers from other cultures, 
think of how you would feel and react in the following situations:
 
 After many weeks of negotiations, your client signs a purchase agree-
ment. A week later, he calls to renegotiate the contract.
 
 Your customer makes an appointment to see you at noon and shows up 
two hours late, acting as if showing up at all is a big favor.

49
 Chapter 3: Assessing Your Cross-Cultural Sales Readiness
 
 A client invites you to his home to have dinner with his family. This in 
itself pushes your boundaries, but you decide to go anyway. The main 
course? Sea slugs.
 
 You are a male salesperson meeting a male client for the first time. He 
greets you by hugging you and then kissing you on both cheeks.
 
 You reach out to shake a client’s hand. She recoils, looks down, bows 
her head, and then takes a step backward.
 
 You’re sitting with your client and the client’s children. One of the chil-
dren is writing with her left hand, and the father scolds her for doing so, 
forcing her to use her right hand instead.
If the phrase, “that’s wrong” crossed your mind when reading any of these 
scenarios, you definitely have the American perspective instilled in you, at 
least to some degree. All of these practices are common in different parts of 
the world.
 
As an American, you come from a culture that’s only about 200 years old. 
Some of the people you meet come from cultures that are thousands of years 
old. If you’ve ever traveled to a foreign country, you probably found it difficult 
to adapt to that country’s ways. Just think of how much more difficult it can 
be for people from other countries to leave their culture behind when they 
come to the United States. Think of yourself as a gracious host — you want to 
make your guests feel as comfortable as possible in your home. This means 
changing the way you treat them rather than expecting them to instantly 
change their ways.
Tuning in to your own cultural biases
Almost everybody has cultural biases. In America, for example, many people 
think that football is superior to soccer, carp is an inedible fish, and you’re 
immoral if you’re late for a meeting. To become more in tune with your own 
cultural biases, offer your perspective on the following:
 
 Which religion is best?
 
 What would you never think of eating that people from other cultures 
eat regularly?
 
 How should people dress?
 
 At what age should children be allowed to drink alcohol?
 
 Should a woman and a man who aren’t married be allowed to drive 
alone together?
 
 What do you think of someone who doesn’t like to work independently 
and requires constant positive reinforcement?

50
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
 What do you think about praising colleagues in front of a group of peers?
 
 What do you think about confronting colleagues in front of a group of 
peers?
 
 Should people who have an issue with you talk directly with you about it?
 
 If people have difficulty speaking your language, do you feel that they 
are less intelligent than you are?
If you’re like most people, you have an opinion for many of the items in this 
list. You probably have a strong opinion about at least a couple of the items. 
Most Americans, for example, were incredulous when they read a story about 
an American woman in Saudi Arabia who was jailed and beaten for sitting at 
a table with a male colleague at a local coffee shop. This isn’t to say that all 
Saudis share the belief that a woman shouldn’t be alone with a man in public 
or that they approve of the treatment of this woman. But it demonstrates just 
how violent cultural clashes can be when people believe that their perspec-
tive is the correct one.
 
Be honest about how you feel and what you believe. In some cases, you may not 
want to change your cultural practices because you truly believe that another 
culture’s beliefs are wrong or dangerous. Analyzing other cultural behaviors, 
however, may lead you to believe that some differences aren’t all that impor-
tant, making you a little more tolerant of other people’s perspectives.
Testing Your Cultural Competency 
as a Salesperson
On your first visit to an optometrist, she doesn’t immediately hand you a pair 
of glasses and a bill and send you on your way. First, she gives you a vision 
exam. Perhaps you have 20/20 vision and don’t even need glasses. Maybe 
you see better out of one eye than the other. Perhaps you have myopia or an 
astigmatism. The results of her vision exam help her write the prescription 
for corrective lenses, contacts, surgery, or other treatment.
The same applies to the way salespeople view and treat people from cultures 
different from their own. Some salespeople naturally have many of the skills 
required to adapt their sales presentations and other aspects of the way they 
do business. Others require much more training and have to put more effort 
into it.
In the following sections, we test your cultural competency and lead you 
through the process of checking your answers and scoring your exam. After 
you’ve completed these steps, you’ll have a clear idea of areas you’ve already 
mastered and areas you need to work on.

Put on your thinking cap: Taking the test
 
On EthnoConnect.com, I (Michael) have several free online quizzes that can 
help you determine how much you know about dealing with customers and 
clients from other countries and cultures. If you register (by entering your 
name and e-mail address) and take a quiz online, you can have your quiz auto-
matically graded. The free quizzes include the following:
 
 Company Cultural Competency Quiz
 
 Multicultural Marketing Quiz
 
 Multicultural Negotiations Quiz
 
 American Cultural Awareness Quiz
 
 Salesperson Cultural Competence Quiz
We’ve compiled questions from several of these quizzes to develop a custom 
quiz specifically for salespeople. To determine your cultural competency as a 
salesperson, answer all 30 questions in this section. In the following sections, 
we lead you through grading and scoring your answers.
 
In the quiz, we introduce the concepts of high-context and low-context cultures. 
To answer these questions, you need to know what these terms mean. These 
terms were introduced by Edward T. Hall in his book Beyond Culture (Peter 
Smith Publisher).
 
 A high-context culture relies more on history and tradition to commu-
nicate. Individuals require fewer words because everyone in the group 
understands the context, which conveys much of the meaning. People 
from high-context cultures, such as the Japanese, Arabs, and Greeks, 
also tend to be more group oriented and focused on building and main-
taining strong relationships.
 
 In low-context cultures, individuality is highly valued and people spend 
more time explaining and providing information to bring one another up 
to speed. In low-context countries, including the United States, Germany, 
and Switzerland, individual initiative and achievements tend to carry a 
higher value than they do in high-context cultures.

Checking your answers
After you complete the quiz in the previous section, you can mark which 
questions you answered correctly and which ones you missed. Here’s the 
answer key:

58
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
1. The group that is least likely to object to receiving advertisements by 
direct mail is:
 
 B. Hispanics
 
 As a group, Hispanics are rarely targeted by direct mail organizations, 
so they tend to object the least to receiving such ads. (Flip to Chapter 5 
for details on marketing.)
 
2. What is the most appropriate greeting when first meeting a male 
multicultural customer?
 
 C. Wait for him to do what’s comfortable for him
 
 Don’t automatically stick out your hand. Wait for him to do what’s com-
fortable for his culture. (See Chapter 8 for additional strategies and tips 
on meeting and greeting customers.)
 
3. If a female customer doesn’t put her hand out to greet you, what 
should you do?
 
 D. Nod in her direction to show respect
 
 After you’ve nodded in her direction to acknowledge her presence, you 
can move on with your presentation.
 
4. How far should you stand from a multicultural customer when 
conversing?
 
 E. Whatever distance the customer sets
 
 Let the customer set the distance that’s comfortable for him. Good 
customer service dictates that you do what your customers want.
 
5. Which group would likely stand the closest when talking to a salesperson?
 
 E. Middle Easterners
 
 People from the Middle East seem to prefer the most intimate personal 
space.
 
6. When exchanging business cards with a multicultural customer, you 
should be sure to:
 
 C. Present your card with both hands
 
 Always present your card with both hands with the lettering facing the 
customer. Accept their card with your right hand, because the left hand 
is considered to be “unclean.” Asking for two cards implies you’ll likely 
lose one of them, which is an insult.
 
7. When storing a multicultural customer’s business card, you should:
 
 C. Paper clip it into your file
 
 Business cards represent the customers in many cultures. Stapling the 
card is equivalent to shooting the customer in the head with a nail gun! All 
the other actions, with the exception of the paper clip, are unacceptable.

59
 Chapter 3: Assessing Your Cross-Cultural Sales Readiness
 
8. It is acceptable to make notes about multicultural customers:
 
 C. On a separate notepad
 
 Writing on the customer’s card is equivalent to writing on his face! 
Writing on your own card disrespects it as well.
 
9. One word you’ll probably never hear from a Japanese customer is:
 
 B. “No”
 
 Japanese don’t like to be disagreeable. In fact, they have 17 different 
ways to say “no” without ever uttering the word!
 
10. Which group would most likely be attracted to a product described as 
“unique, special, one-of-a kind”?
 
 C. African Americans
 
 African Americans tend to prefer products that are customized for their 
special needs and tastes.
 
11. A product demonstration with Hispanic buyers is likely to be most 
effective by:
 
 B. Letting them try it for themselves
 
 Studies show that Hispanics tend to be more hands on than other cul-
tures, preferring to actually examine and operate products as opposed 
to hearing about their features. (Check out Chapter 11 for additional tips 
on tweaking your sales presentation to accommodate different cultures.)
 
12. A product demonstration with Asian buyers is likely to be most 
effective by:
 
 C. Showing them a diagram
 
 Studies show that Asians tend to be more visual than other cultures, 
preferring to look at pictures, charts, and graphs. This is because their 
language is built on pictures.
 
13. A product demonstration with African American buyers is likely to be 
most effective by:
 
 D. Verbally explaining its operations to them
 
 Studies show that African Americans tend to be more verbal than other 
cultures. Historically, they’ve had to rely on verbal communications to 
pass along history and other information.
 
14. If multicultural customers constantly look down during a sales presen-
tation, it probably means:
 
 D. They respect you
 
 Many cultures believe that looking others in the eye is rude and intru-
sive. So to show others respect, they avoid eye contact.

60
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
15. When a multicultural customer plans to finance a major purchase, 
what should you never ask?
 
 A. How much of a down payment do you have?
 
 Many groups, particularly Hispanics and Asians, tend not to trust banks, 
so they may keep cash hidden in and around their homes. Asking about 
the down payment may make them feel more vulnerable to home inva-
sion robberies. Instead of asking specifically about the down payment, 
it’s safest to show the customer a menu of choices, such as the cash 
down payment and monthly payments required for a 10, 20, and 30 per-
cent down payment loan. The one they show the most interest in is the 
one they can most likely afford. (For more about differences in how vari-
ous cultures think about financing, check out Chapter 11.)
 
16. When discussing financing with Hispanic buyers, you shouldn’t be 
surprised if many:
 
 E. All of the above
 
 Having no credit history, thinking perfect credit is necessary to get a 
loan, believing there’s discrimination in lending, and wanting to pay 
cash are very common beliefs, especially among newly immigrated 
Hispanics.
 
17. When discussing financing with African American buyers, you should 
never directly ask about:
 
 B. Credit life insurance
 
 Many African Americans have an aversion to life insurance because of a 
previous history of discrimination.
 
18. The group most likely to apply for a loan online is:
 
 C. African Americans
 
 Many African Americans believe that they’re less likely to be discrimi-
nated against if they apply for a loan online.
 
19. What’s the major difference between high-context and low-context 
cultures?
 
 A. High-context people want to build a relationship before they buy
 
 High-context cultures value long-term relationships, so a customer with 
this background will want to get to know the salesperson before he 
buys.
 
20. Which would be a high-context culture?
 
 D. China
 
 China and most Asian as well as many Spanish-speaking countries tend 
to be high-context.

61
 Chapter 3: Assessing Your Cross-Cultural Sales Readiness
 
21. When working with a group of high-context buyers, who is most 
crucial to the buying decision?
 
 E. They all are
 
 In high-context cultures, group decision making is common, so the 
consensus of the group is vital to closing a sale. (Chapter 10 offers addi-
tional insights on how to pick up on buying signals in various cultures.)
 
22. When talking with new immigrant buyers who show no body 
language, which would be a definite buying sign?
 
 C. Talking in their own language
 
 Smiling and laughing often indicate uneasiness or lack of understanding, 
and nodding usually means the buyers are listening but not necessar-
ily agreeing with you. Talking in their own language means they have 
moved to the emotional level of buying. It’s easy to talk about product 
specifications in a language you learned from a book, but to discuss how 
you’d feel when you owned a product or used a service usually requires 
you to speak your native language.
 
23. What does signing a contract usually mean in low-context cultures?
 
 A. The end of negotiations
 
 Signing a contract in low-context cultures usually ends negotiations. On 
the other hand, it begins negotiations in high-context cultures where 
bargaining can continue up to and beyond delivery of the product. (For 
more about negotiating with customers from other cultures, check out 
Chapter 13.)
 
24. “Nibbling” is common among high-context cultures, which usually 
means:
 
 C. Expect to give concessions after a contract is signed
 
 Nibbling is asking for additional concessions after the contract is signed.
 
25. Which gesture is most universally offensive?
 
 A. Pointing with the finger
 
 Pointing with the finger is generally the most universally offensive ges-
ture. Many cultures consider it rude or even obscene. In most cultures 
outside the United States, the entire closed hand or a head nod should 
be used to indicate a specific direction.
 
26. Salespeople from which cultural group are most likely to clash with 
African American customers:
 
 D. Asians
 
 Asians are at the opposite end of the cultural spectrum from African 
Americans. From eye contact to personal space preferences to showing 
emotions in public, they are the most different.

62
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
27. Which group is least likely to openly complain about poor service?
 
 B. Hispanics
 
 Although Hispanics are less likely than any other group to complain 
about poor service or faulty goods, they’re also more likely to tell rela-
tives and friends to avoid buying from customer-unfriendly companies.
 
28. Which group is most likely to openly display emotions during 
negotiations?
 
 E. Middle Easterners
 
 Middle Easterners tend to be very emotional and emphatic as part of 
their negotiating technique.
 
29. Which group is least likely to try to negotiate the price of your product?
 
 A. Whites
 
 European Americans come from nonnegotiating cultures where only 
large purchases are regularly bargained on.
 
30. Which thank-you gift would be least appropriate for Asians?
 
 A. Watch
 
 Watches and clocks tend to remind Asians of the “winding down of 
life,” so giving a watch would be taken to mean “I wish you were dead.” 
Probably not the sentiment you had in mind! (For additional advice on 
giving appropriate gifts, check out Chapter 15.)
How’d ya do? Scoring the test
To score your test, total your number of correct answers. You can then 
determine just how knowledgeable you are about selling to customers of 
diverse cultures:
Your score: _____
26–30: Outstanding! You’re culturally competent and probably have many 
diverse customers. Heck, you probably could’ve written this chapter.
21–25: Very good. With a few minor adjustments, you’ll be well prepared 
to take full advantage of the multicultural marketplace.
16–20: Pretty good. You can handle most situations, but could use some 
fine-tuning to obtain more multicultural sales.
12–15: Fair. You’re not about to get kicked out of a foreign country for a 
major faux pas, but you’re not ready for the United Nations, either.
< 12: Yikes! You’d better stay away from cross-cultural selling until you 
get the proper training. Keep reading.

63
 Chapter 3: Assessing Your Cross-Cultural Sales Readiness
Refocusing Your Cultural Lens
Think back to some belief you held as a child that, in the process of growing 
up, you eventually were forced to question and then dismiss. It may not just 
be your concept of Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny, but perhaps it was some-
thing you were taught in Sunday school, an unbreakable rule your parents told 
you about the opposite sex, or even some scientific fact you learned in grade 
school that was proved to be untrue by the time you reached high school.
 
What happened to make you change your mind? You obtained new informa-
tion that refuted what you previously thought. Education and experience tend 
to do this to people. The more you discover about life and about the world 
you live in, the more your belief system and perspectives are challenged and 
eventually changed.
If you scored low on the cultural competency quiz earlier in this chapter, 
your case isn’t hopeless — not by a long shot. You simply need to start 
refocusing your cultural lens, as explained in the next sections.
Giving yourself an attitude adjustment
 
Most differences between people that can be traced to cultural differences 
aren’t wrong, they’re just different. The first step in being more accepting 
of cultural differences is to purge the word “wrong” from your vocabulary. 
You’ve probably gotten a bad haircut at one time in your life and asked an 
acquaintance what she thought of it. Perhaps she said, “Well, that’s different.” 
You knew she didn’t like it, but at least she tried to be nice about it. Take the 
same approach toward cultural differences, at least until you can truly accept 
the differences you notice.
 
Here’s an exercise that can help you physically experience how difficult it may 
be for you to accept a variation to something that you have become accus-
tomed to over time:
 
1. Cross your arms as you normally would.
 
2. Make a mental note which hand is on top.
 
3. Uncross your arms and refold them with the opposite hand on top.
You probably find the new position of your crossed arms uncomfortable 
because you’re so used to doing it the “right” way. But if you had to, you 
could probably get used to folding your arms the new way. This is what 
becoming culturally competent is all about. You have to become aware of 
what you view as “normal” really is and adjust to other people’s ways of 
doing things differently.

64
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
Throughout this book, but especially in Chapter 4, we offer plenty of advice 
on how to develop cultural competency. After you know the basics, the more 
you practice, the more comfortable you become.
Building empathy and understanding
Americans have an old saying about understanding another person by “walk-
ing in his shoes.” This is exactly what you need to do to begin understanding 
how people from other cultures are likely to feel when they try to navigate 
the traditional American culture they encounter in the United States for the 
first time.
 
To walk in the shoes of someone who has a different background, perform one 
or more of the following exercises:
 
 Empathy walk: Have a friend blindfold you and then lead you around 
a familiar setting like his home or office. You’ll both learn what it’s like 
to be blind, and he’ll experience what it’s like to lead someone who is 
blind. Then reverse roles.
 
 Foreign language immersion: Go with a friend to a religious service 
that is delivered in a language you can’t understand (Chinese, Spanish, 
Russian, Greek, Korean, or some other language). For a short time, you’ll 
experience what it’s like for people who don’t speak English to try to 
understand our language.
 
 Mind trip: Take ten minutes and imagine you’re a stranger in a foreign 
country where people don’t speak English. Then list 20 things that 
would be challenges for you and how you would deal with them.

efore you can excel at selling to multicultural customers, becoming a 
student of culture is essential. It’s sort of like acquiring a new language. 
You have to brush up on the general rules and regulations that govern your 
own culture and then explore and begin to accept the similarities and differ-
ences in other cultures. Success hinges on your ability to drop your defenses, 
accept differences, and practice some customs that may be uncomfortable to 
you for the sake of putting your customers more at ease.
This chapter steps you through the process so you move as quickly as pos-
sible from point A to point B . . . or from point B to point A, depending on 
your cultural perspective.
The Six Essential Steps to 
a Multicultural Mindset
Discovering and adapting to other cultures is a lifelong process. Fortunately, 
it’s also a fairly enjoyable process, assuming you approach it with the right 
attitude and an open mind. In the following sections, we walk you through the 
six-step process:

66
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
1. Recognizing any lack of awareness
 
2. Acknowledging differences between your native culture and others
 
3. Acknowledging your need to acquire more information and knowledge 
about other cultures
 
4. Actively seeking the knowledge you need
 
5. Adapting to other people’s native cultures
 
6. Continuing to learn, adapt, and practice so your actions and behaviors 
feel more natural
 
As a citizen and longtime resident of the United States, you may have a knee-
jerk reaction to resist change. After all, this is your country. Why should you 
have to change to accommodate the differences of people from other cul-
tures? If they want to deal with you on your home turf, they should change, 
right? Wrong!
 
 First, realize that common courtesy demands that whenever someone 
visits your home, you should make accommodations to make them feel 
comfortable.
 
 Second, resisting change is counterproductive — it only makes your 
job more difficult. Change is going to occur despite your best efforts to 
resist it. (See the later section, “Embracing Change,” for more details on 
this concept.)
Step 1: Recognize any lack of awareness
Everybody starts out pretty clueless in terms of recognizing racial, ethnic, 
and cultural differences between themselves and others. When people are 
growing up, family members and friends are the only point of reference. 
Playmates are just that — kids who live in the same neighborhood and pretty 
much share the same experience of growing up. For example, I (Michael), an 
Asian American, grew up in a very White neighborhood. As a result, until I 
started going to school I thought I was White. Who knew?
Whenever I begin assisting someone in developing cultural competency, 
this is exactly the premise with which we begin: Being ethnocentric doesn’t 
necessarily imply that you’re prejudiced or discriminatory. It simply means 
that certain racial, ethnic, and cultural differences lie outside your realm of 
experience. Increasing your exposure to different cultures can begin the 
process of transformation from ethnocentric to cosmopolitan.

67
 Chapter 4: Developing Cross-Cultural Competency
Step 2: Acknowledge the existence 
of cultural differences
After becoming aware of other cultures, many salespeople choose to over-
look or dismiss any cultural differences and instead choose to deal with the 
situation by “treating everyone the same.”
Of course, this approach is ineffective at its best and counterproductive at 
its worst. Why? Because although you may be able to overlook your cultural 
differences and minimize their importance, prospective customers may be 
unable or unwilling to do the same. Their customs may be very important 
to them and so ingrained that “treating them the same” can make them very 
uneasy and perhaps even turn them away.
 
Acknowledging cultural differences and then investing the time and effort in 
adapting to those differences is crucial if you want to appeal to multicultural 
clientele. The penalty for failing to develop cultural competency is loss of busi-
ness and market share.
Step 3: Acknowledge a 
need for knowledge
According to a proverb often attributed to the Chinese or Persians:
He who knows not and knows not that he knows not is a fool . . . 
shun him.
He who knows not and knows that he knows not is a child . . . teach him.
He who knows and knows not that he knows is asleep . . . awaken him.
He who knows and knows that he knows is wise . . . follow him.
Step 3 requires that you become like a child — someone who is aware that 
you don’t know much about other cultures but are ready, able, and eager 
to discover all sorts of useful and fascinating customs. Because you’re 
reading this book, we conclude that this is the stage you’re currently at. 
Congratulations! You’re halfway through the transformation process.
 
Even if you’re not an Anglo American, you can benefit from multicultural 
training. Just because you grew up outside of White, middle-class America 
doesn’t automatically make you an expert on cultures outside your own. 
In fact, you may need training to understand how your Anglo American 
customers think and act.

68
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
The first step in the quest for new knowledge is to put your ego aside and be 
willing to seek assistance. Becoming sensitive to cultural nuances isn’t a skill 
that most people can pick up on their own.
Step 4: Actively seek knowledge
Everyone has cultural blind spots — certain beliefs and behaviors in other 
cultures that a person either doesn’t see or simply can’t comprehend. The 
tendency is to judge these beliefs and behaviors in terms of right and wrong 
instead of trying to understand them.
 
To open your mind to cultural differences, you must constantly challenge 
your own beliefs. One of the most effective ways to gain knowledge is to ask 
people about their culture, food, language, and beliefs. Trust us, they won’t be 
offended. In fact, you’ll usually find that people are more than happy to edu-
cate you about their culture. They would much rather spend some time shar-
ing their insights with you than become the victim of false assumptions. (See 
the later section, “Asking the Experts,” for additional information.)
Exploring cultural differences doesn’t have to feel like work; it can be fun, 
fascinating, and delicious, as we reveal later in this chapter. It’s usually quite 
exhilarating to discover the truth behind many cultural myths. For example, 
did you know that fortune cookies were invented in the U.S., not in China? 
Were you aware that burritos aren’t a common food in Cuba?
Of course, as a salesperson or business owner who wants to expand into the 
multicultural marketplace, you’re probably looking for more practical and 
useful facts than trivia about fortune cookies and burritos. As you explore 
different cultures, you’re going to discover information that can be very valu-
able in helping you hone the following skills:
 
 Meeting and greeting customers without offending them (see Chapter 8 
for more details on this process).
 
 Explaining the benefits of your products and services in a way that cus-
tomers appreciate (see Chapter 11).
 
 Avoiding going into panic mode and actually celebrating when custom-
ers start talking in their own language (see Chapter 10).
 
 Negotiating effectively with born-and-bred hagglers (see Chapter 13).
 
 Increasing your referral business from your multicultural clientele (see 
Chapter 15).

69
 Chapter 4: Developing Cross-Cultural Competency
 
The skills you develop in working with customers from other cultures will 
enhance your relationships with your traditional customers as well. Through 
this process, you’ll become more perceptive to the unique needs and behav-
iors of every individual you meet during the sales process.
Step 5: Adapt to other people
Knowing how to do something and being able to do it are two entirely dif-
ferent animals. You can know how to golf, for example, by watching Tiger 
Woods swing a club, but going out on a golf course and actually shooting 
under par is the real challenge.
As soon as you have an understanding of your multicultural customers’ back-
grounds, start putting it into action by practicing what you’ve discovered. 
Sure, you’re going to make some mistakes at first, but the more you practice, 
the more natural you become and the fewer mistakes you make. When people 
recognize that you’re making an effort to accommodate their cultural differ-
ences, they’re going to be very forgiving and are usually willing to meet you 
at least halfway.
 
Adapting to other people doesn’t mean forsaking your own beliefs and behav-
iors, but instead tweaking your actions to help others feel comfortable. It’s no 
different than when you have your extended family over for a party. You may 
refrain from smoking because Aunt Liz is allergic or avoid discussing politics 
with Uncle Bob because it always ends in a shouting match, but you can still 
enjoy yourself in spite of having to make these adjustments.
Step 6: Continue your education
As the old saying goes, “If you’re not making mistakes, you’re not learning 
anything.” The key to developing cultural competence is to be open-minded, 
willing to forgive your own mistakes, and dedicated to keep trying.
 
Culture is complex, so don’t expect to develop a mastery of all cultures over-
night or simply by reading this book. Even the most globally astute salespeople 
are always in the process of discovering new cultural differences they were 
unaware of and making adjustments to how they treat their customers. It’s 
truly a lifelong process. Pick up a little bit every day. By the end of the month, 
you’ll have made an incredible amount of progress, and you’ll be light-years 
ahead of your competition.

Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
Changing Your Vision to Reach 
beyond Cultural Stereotypes
You can’t judge a book by its cover, nor can you judge a person solely 
on looks or the way the person dresses, speaks, or acts. Some eccentric 
people who prefer to dress down have plenty of money to spend and really 
have their acts together, as you discover if you spend a little quality time 
with them.
Unfortunately, the human tendency to jump to conclusions can often be 
counterproductive to business. In the following sections, we explain the 
limits of stereotypes and the dangers of language elitism; we also show 
you how to expand your vision by becoming more aware of certain cultural 
tendencies.
Understanding how stereotypes 
can limit your vision
Making general observations and noting tendencies can be a useful first step 
in developing an understanding of just about anything. As children, for exam-
ple, we first discover how to identify dogs and cats and birds. Only later do 
we discover the differences between a German shepherd and a toy poodle or 
the unique personality and behaviors of the family dog. Only with experience 
do we realize that every animal is unique, although the general classifications 
still continue to help us identify and understand them.
The same is true when we become adults and begin to encounter people from 
different backgrounds. At first, we can be almost blind to the fact that every 
person in a culture is an individual. We tend to base our expectations on 
and judge individuals by our limited understanding of the group. As you may 
expect and can readily observe in the real world, this can be a dangerous 
approach to dealing with people, resulting in negative stereotypes that can 
lead to misunderstandings.
 
Throughout this book, we point out some general inclinations within certain 
groups, but we have to warn you not to get too comfortable with these clas-
sifications. They’re just a first step toward the ultimate awareness that every 
human being is unique. Stereotypes can compromise your relationships with 
customers and kill sales. Be sure to avoid the following actions:

71
 Chapter 4: Developing Cross-Cultural Competency
 
 Try not to judge people by how they’re dressed or the vehicle they 
drive. Looks can be deceiving, as we point out in the nearby sidebar 
“Just a bum?” and can result in the loss of very good customers and 
prospects. In Brazil, for example, people try to look poor on purpose, 
because people who are rich in that country often get kidnapped and 
held for ransom. To protect their safety, people there tend to avoid the 
bling.
 
 Similarly, avoid looking down on customers because of the job they cur-
rently hold. Many foreign professionals coming into the United States 
may not be able to practice their previous careers here, but it doesn’t 
mean that they’re unintelligent or lack the money to buy your product 
or service. It’s not unusual to find doctors from India, engineers from 
Pakistan, or scientists from the Philippines working as custodians, secu-
rity guards, or housekeepers when they first arrive in the United States.
Overcoming language elitism
For some reason, in the United States, a lot of people think that English should 
not only be the official language, but that it should be the only language. Native-
born citizens often assume that anyone who can’t speak English fluently is a 
little on the dumb side. Instead of trying to communicate in a manner that the 
other person can grasp, many people simply talk much more s-l-o-w-l-y and 
LOUDLY, assuming that the person just needs to hear the words a little more 
clearly to understand them. Remember that even medical doctors, attorneys, 
and professors from overseas, Mexico, or French-speaking provinces of Canada 
must learn our language starting with their ABCs.
Just a bum?
I (Michael) was working in a real estate office 
many years ago when in rode an elderly gentle-
man on a bicycle wearing a paint-spattered 
T-shirt, torn jeans, and work boots. I heard the 
agent assigned to greet visitors mutter under his 
breath, “I’ll bet this guy wants to rent a mobile 
home,” and he immediately led the man to the 
rental department.
Two hours later the man left, and a smiling 
rental manager explained to us that the gentle-
man owned several large apartment buildings, 
which he liked to fix up himself. He was looking 
to buy another 50- to 70-unit building in the area. 
The rental manager, who also happened to be 
a licensed real estate broker, gladly offered to 
assist.
The customer was a bit eccentric but obviously 
knew a thing or two about real estate investing, 
and he certainly wasn’t the bum his appear-
ance first implied.

72
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
Be careful in making assumptions about a person’s ability or inability to 
communicate with you. An immigrant who doesn’t speak English is no less 
intelligent, and perhaps even more intelligent, than your average native-
born, English-speaking American citizen. On the other hand, just because an 
immigrant speaks English doesn’t necessarily mean she understands you. 
Becoming fluent in a second language is difficult. Most people have to trans-
late English into their first language, formulate a response in their native 
tongue, and then translate it back into English. This is easier said than done 
(or perhaps easier done than said). For guidance on how to communicate 
more effectively with clients who aren’t fluent in English, turn to Chapter 11.
You may notice that people from some cultures tend to nod their heads more 
than expected when they’re talking with you. (If they’re nodding off, you may 
want to liven up your sales presentation.) As we point out in Chapter 8, in 
many cultures, people nod as others speak to show respect and demonstrate 
that they’re paying attention. Don’t necessarily take it as a sign that the 
person is agreeing with you or is willing to buy what you’re selling.
You also need to be careful about how you interpret accents. For some 
reason, Americans generally have decided that some accents are better 
than others. French is sexy. Brits sound sophisticated. Germans speak with 
authority. As for Asians, many Americans think these accents are simply 
“hard to understand.” The best approach is to do what your mother always 
told you — if you can’t think of something nice about a person’s accent, think 
nothing at all. Just accept it as something different.
Expanding your vision with 
cultural tendencies
Cultural tendencies and stereotypes are on opposite ends of the spectrum. 
While stereotypes can limit your vision (as we explain earlier in this chapter), 
an awareness of cultural tendencies expands your world, allowing you to form 
a deeper understanding of why people in certain groups tend to think and 
act the way they do. The following list describes some of the more common 
cultural tendencies you’re likely to encounter:
 
 Asians and Hispanics tend to negotiate everything all day long. They 
have a good reason for doing this, as you see in Chapter 13.
 
 Many Asians tend to believe in feng shui (many don’t, too). (This ancient 
Chinese practice involves arranging objects to maximize positive energy 
flow and achieve harmony with the environment.) Your customers’ 
belief in feng shui may influence how you lay out your store or office, 
as you see in Chapter 7, and other aspects of how you do business with 
people who subscribe to its tenets.
 
 Many Asians tend to be frugal, which is an integral part of Confucian culture.

73
 Chapter 4: Developing Cross-Cultural Competency
 
 Asian Indians or Pakistanis may want a great deal of information before 
making a decision.
 
 African Americans tend to be religious, especially the old schoolers, so 
watch your language in their presence (which is a good habit to get into 
anyway).
R-E-S-P-E-C-T: Respecting Clients 
from Other Cultures
Every consumer wants to be treated with respect, but multicultural custom-
ers may expect the opposite because of the way they’ve been treated by 
culturally unaware salespeople. As a result, they can be even more sensitive 
to how you treat them or how they perceive you’re treating them. If they walk 
into your business and they don’t feel the love, they’re very likely to quickly 
walk out.
Every day, American retail and service companies that desperately want 
and need more business unwittingly turn away potential customers simply 
because they don’t know how to foster positive relationships with their 
multicultural clientele.
 
According to the 2005 Yankelovich MONITOR Multicultural Marketing Study, 
68 percent of African Americans, compared with 46 percent of non-Hispanic 
Whites, say how a store treats customers based on race is extremely impor-
tant in deciding where to shop. All ethnic groups tend to be sensitive to their 
treatment in stores, restaurants, offices, and other public places.
The media is somewhat responsible for the current state of affairs. Stories 
about discrimination, prejudice, and profiling can make anyone who doesn’t 
look and act like an average American (whatever that is) more than a little 
jumpy and defensive. Likewise, stories that portray certain ethnic groups as 
gangsters, drug dealers, and thieves can cause retailers to be hyper-vigilant 
when upstanding multicultural citizens enter their establishment.
In the following sections, we guide you in the process of developing a sense 
of respect for all of your customers.
Grasping your own sense of respect
Everyone wants to be treated with respect, including people in countries 
outside the U.S. We may have different names for it and slightly different 
concepts of what respect really means, but everyone’s notion of it basically 

74
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
boils down to the same thing: being treated as an equal and with courtesy. Of 
course, every culture has its own subtle nuances, as the following examples 
illustrate:
 
 European Americans tend to call it honor, while African Americans refer 
to it as respect (remember Aretha Franklin’s song “Respect”?).
 
 In Asia, honor is known as face, and many there would rather die than 
lose face. In fact, ancient Samurai warriors were required to kill them-
selves if they brought disgrace to the emperor. This would restore 
honor to their families.
 
 In Latin America, honor is known as respecto. You first respect yourself 
and then your family. The Hispanic culture, however, believes that if 
you don’t respect your parents, you can’t respect yourself. This dif-
ferentiates the Latino culture from the American culture, in which we 
tend to ignore and even disrespect our elders by making jokes about 
“old-timer’s disease,” “senior moments,” and other stereotypical elderly 
ailments.
 
We tend to agree with the Latino culture’s view of respect, but we’d add that if 
you don’t understand what respect means to you, you’re going to have a much 
tougher time treating your customers with respect. Take a moment to reflect 
on how people must treat you in order for you to feel respected, and make 
this your starting point for how you treat them.
Taking a lesson in etiquette
 
The longer an immigrant family has been in the United States, the more accul-
turated (adapted to the new culture) they become, and the less likely they are 
to exhibit traditional characteristics of people from their homeland. However, 
culture is deeply ingrained in the psyche, and even after four or five genera-
tions in this country, people can still hold on to a few beliefs and other traits 
of their ancestors.
So what does this have to do with respect? And how do you go about treat-
ing customers with respect? It all starts with going beyond the Golden Rule: 
“Treat people the way you would like to be treated.” In today’s market-
place, you must follow the Global Rule: “Treat people the way they want to 
be treated.” However, this assumes that you know how others want to be 
treated.
In the appendix, we provide detailed guidelines for treating people from 
other cultures respectfully, including Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Native 
Americans, and even current Americans. We get even more detailed by 

75
 Chapter 4: Developing Cross-Cultural Competency
splitting our coverage into subgroups; for example, different rules govern 
how you treat different groups of Hispanics, including Mexicans, Puerto 
Ricans, and Cubans. The guidelines we lay out in the appendix can get you 
up to speed on steps you can take to make customers from specific cultures 
feel respected. After you know what people expect, you’re better equipped to 
show people respect.
Acquiring Cross-Cultural Skills 
with a Dash of Fun
As an entrepreneurial salesperson or business owner, you probably already 
know that work doesn’t have to feel like work. It can be fun, and we believe 
that the effort required to develop cross-cultural sales skills is perhaps the 
most fun, fascinating, and rewarding endeavor a person can ever have the 
pleasure of doing. To assist you on your voyage of discovery, we present 
several suggestions in the following sections that you can use to gain more 
insight into other cultures. We start slow with easy stuff, like eating out at 
ethic restaurants, and then proceed to more challenging activities.
Imagine this: You’re about to embark on a journey to foreign and exotic 
lands. You’ll treat your taste buds to new cuisines and your olfactory organs 
to exotic aromas; expose your ears to new music, voices, and sounds; open 
your mind to new ideas and beliefs; behold a rainbow of colors; and discover 
wonders you may never have otherwise imagined.
Dining out at ethnic restaurants
Need an excuse to eat out? Then consider doing a little cultural research 
at a local ethnic restaurant. If you live in or near a big city, you should 
have plenty of ethnic restaurants from which to choose — Chinese, Thai, 
Ethiopian, Mexican, Japanese, Cuban, Korean, Indian, Middle Eastern, African 
American soul food, or you name it. Ever since the beginning of time, food 
has bridged the gap between cultures and convinced people of the value of 
sitting down together at the same table.
 
Just be sure you choose an eatery that’s at least somewhat authentic. Dining 
out at the Super-Duper China Buffet in the local strip mall or at any of the 
many Mexican franchise restaurants is not likely to put you in touch with 
traditional foods and customs.

76
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
 
One of the easiest and most delicious ways to acquire cross-cultural skills is to 
dine at various ethnic restaurants a couple of times a month. And don’t forget 
to bring a stack of business cards with you. You never know where you’re 
going to meet your next customer.
Admittedly, you have to do a little more than stuff your face with ethnic food. 
Use your dinner date as a catalyst for discovering more about the culture and 
cuisine. Here are some ideas to get you started:
 
 Before you go to a Mexican restaurant, research the differences between 
Mexican, Spanish, Cuban, South American, Central American, and Puerto 
Rican foods. You can find plenty of information on the Web.
 
 Prior to visiting an Asian restaurant, look up foods from China, Japan, 
Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines, and research the rules 
of dinner etiquette for the different countries. Most eat with chopsticks, 
but the Chinese pick up the rice bowl and scoop food into their mouths, 
while the Japanese, being more formal, leave the bowl on the table and 
use chopsticks to bring the food to their mouths.
 
 Before heading out to an African American restaurant, research the ori-
gins of the cuisine. You may be surprised to find that soul food has roots 
in Africa as well as the southern United States.
 
 In advance of dining at an Indian or Pakistani restaurant, explore the dif-
ferences between the two cuisines. The meat selections and spices are 
quite varied.
 
Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the foods. People who own ethnic res-
taurants want you to be familiar with their culture and their foods. If they’re 
proud enough of their culture to open a restaurant, they’re probably proud 
enough to share their customs and beliefs as well.
 
When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Don’t, for example, step into a tradi-
tional Ethiopian restaurant and demand a knife and fork. Food is served on a 
platter in the center of the table, and patrons are expected to eat with their 
fingers. Don’t worry; your server will usually provide your table with an ample 
supply of hot, damp towels to wash your hands. Follow the customs of the 
land — even if that land is located in the middle of the United States.
Attending ethnic fairs and celebrations
When you can’t get away to a foreign country, the next best thing is to attend 
a local ethnic fair or celebration. Most big cities are proud to sponsor a host 
of annual cultural celebrations, including Cinco de Mayo, Chinese New Year, 
the Japanese Cherry Blossom Festival, African American History Month and 

77
 Chapter 4: Developing Cross-Cultural Competency
Kwanzaa celebrations, Asian Indian Diwali observances, Greek festivals, 
German Oktoberfest, Italian or Polish heritage celebrations, and other 
occasions.
At most of these events, you’ll surely find plenty of food stands, but check 
out the cultural exhibits as well. Watch or join in the ethnic dances, view 
the artwork, check out the culture’s history and beliefs, and talk to the 
people (ask lots of questions; see the upcoming section, “Asking the 
Experts,” for some suggestions). Mingle with the folks you meet, and make 
a few friends who can introduce you to the culture. Take a sincere interest 
in discovering more about other people, and you’ll soon find that they’re 
happy to educate you.
Visiting different houses of worship
Most people who hold deep, sincere religious beliefs are more than willing to 
share those views and their ceremonies with visitors. Although you may be 
intimidated when first visiting an unfamiliar house of worship, it’s a great way 
to meet people on their own turf. Whether it’s a rousing African American 
Baptist service or a more subdued Buddhist service, you get to experience 
cultural and language differences firsthand.
 
People can be very protective of their beliefs, so tread carefully. Just as taking 
communion in a Catholic church when you’re not a member is a big no-no, 
other traditions have their own rules that you need to be careful to honor. 
One of the best ways to prepare for an enlightening visit is to ask someone 
who’s familiar with or perhaps even already attends the house of worship to 
accompany you — perhaps a customer or colleague or a leader in the local 
community. Have the person explain the significance of the service and mean-
ings behind various ceremonies before you go; you never want to carry on a 
conversation during the service.
Visiting ethnic districts in your area
If you’re fortunate enough to live in or near a major metropolitan area, you 
probably have quick access to some of the best cultural research centers in 
the United States — ethnic districts and neighborhoods.
Probably one of the oldest and best known examples is San Francisco’s 
Chinatown. Although you can certainly find plenty of shops specially 
designed to attract tourists, Chinatown is also the place where local Chinese 
people buy their fruits, vegetables, meats, and groceries. During a brief walk 

78
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
down Grant Avenue you’ll notice many cultural differences, such as the way 
people greet each other, how close they stand to one another while shop-
ping, and the haggling with shop owners that seems to go on incessantly.
Just a few blocks away, you can visit the Italian neighborhood of North 
Beach with fresh-cooked pasta for sale, as well as round-the-clock boccie 
ball games. Not far from there is Japantown. On the other side of town, you 
can discover Russian and Irish communities. In the Fillmore District, you find 
many Black businesses and restaurants, and the Mission District is home to 
Latino food and stores.
If you sit on a bench in any ethnic district and try to notice the differences 
without being judgmental, your eyes are opened to a whole new world. Look 
closely and you’re likely to notice differences and similarities.
 
Strike up a conversation with one or more shop owners and try to get them 
talking about their customers. Chances are pretty good that they’re dealing 
with many of the same challenges that you face in your business. Ask ques-
tions about differences in how their customers shop and make purchase deci-
sions and the products and services that are in highest demand. What you 
discover should help increase your success with customers of all cultures.
Joining ethnic chambers of commerce
In most major cities, you can find chambers of commerce for different 
groups, including Black, Hispanic, Asian, Indian, or Native American business 
communities. Try searching the Internet or contact your local chamber of 
commerce to see if someone there can give you any leads. Some cities are 
home to so many different groups that they have a multiethnic chamber 
alliance or similar group that periodically brings them all together. You may 
also discover regional chambers of commerce in some areas.
After you locate an ethnic chamber in your area, get involved in its business 
and social activities. You can host an event at your store or office, which can 
provide an opportunity to promote your business as well as meet people.
 
One of the fastest ways to get recognized in any organization is to chair a 
committee or serve as an officer. This essentially sets you on stage, where 
you become highly visible to the group’s members. Find out what volunteer 
assistance is needed, and offer your time and expertise. As soon as you find 
out how they run a fund-raising auction or golf tournament, you’re likely 
to be appointed chairperson of the event. After gaining visibility in this 
position, you may consider running for office — maybe serving as a member 
of the board of directors or as secretary, treasurer, vice president, or even 

79
 Chapter 4: Developing Cross-Cultural Competency
president. Being of a different ethnic background is bound to get you noticed, 
but you have to show commitment to the group over time if you want the 
members to do business with you.
Reading ethnic newspapers 
and magazines
Do you want to know what people from other cultures are thinking, what 
grabs their interest, and how ethnic businesses are already pitching their 
products and services to this market? Then pick up a few ethnic newspapers 
and magazines and flip through them when you have some time. You may 
need some assistance from a friend or staff member who speaks the language 
to help you figure out what the headlines say, but the first thing you’re likely 
to notice is that the audience views world events very differently than do 
mainstream Americans. You can instantly gain insight to the other culture’s 
perspective.
You can usually pick up ethnic newspapers (often for free) in ethnic neigh-
borhoods or business establishments or by visiting your public library. You 
can also read many of these publications online.
 
Also, look carefully at the ads in these publications. On close examination, 
you’re likely to notice that the words in these ads convey an entirely different 
message than similar ads targeting Anglo American consumers and that the 
ads probably focus on different features of a product or service than you may 
expect. You’re likely to see that trust is often more important than low price 
and that relationships are crucial in making the sale.
Take the road less traveled
When you travel to a foreign land, get off 
the beaten path and avoid the tourist traps. 
I (Michael) once flew to New Zealand with a 
group from the United States to speak at a con-
vention. After 16 hours on the plane, we were 
tired and hungry. Unfortunately, the first place 
my travel companions wanted to go was an 
American fast-food restaurant.
Why would you travel 6,500 miles to go to an 
establishment that serves the exact same food in 
Auckland that you can get in Akron, Ohio . . . and 
is proud of it? Sample the local cuisine and ask 
the locals to teach you about the different foods.
Do your homework. Find out where the historic 
sites are located and hire a local tour guide 
to take you around. (Let the person know that 
you don’t want to simply follow the tour buses.) 
When visiting the ancient city of Pompeii, my 
traveling companions and I found an Italian uni-
versity history professor who literally wrote the 
book on this attraction, and he agreed to give 
us a special tour.

80
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
Traveling far and wide
Becoming a minority in a different country is perhaps one of the fastest 
ways to develop cultural competency. First, it enables you to empathize with 
minorities in the United States. You get to know how it feels to be the only 
one in a room with a different complexion who isn’t fluent in the language 
and who is unfamiliar with the traditions and customs of those around him.
Moreover, travel transports you to the very origins of the culture and 
immerses you in a setting where everyone around you naturally practices 
the customs and traditions of the land. Assuming you don’t isolate yourself 
with your fellow traveling companions, you quickly begin to pick up on the 
culture’s nuances after a few days.
 
Before you embark, be able to say a few basic words and phrases in the 
other country’s language. The people there will sincerely appreciate your 
efforts. Even the French, whom Americans tend to stereotype as rather cold 
and aloof, quickly warm up if you can at least say “hello” and “goodbye” in 
their language.
 
If possible, talk with anyone on the plane sitting near you who may be familiar 
with your destination. Ask him for tips on interesting places to visit and eat 
and traditional cultural events to experience. Seatmates are usually eager to 
share their experiences and insights on a long flight.
Attending an ethnic studies course
You don’t have to immerse yourself in a foreign language to broaden your 
understanding of other cultures. Plenty of colleges, universities, and community 
colleges offer ethnic studies classes. These programs generally cover the his-
tory of African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and others in the United States. 
Some of the topics these courses typically touch on include the following:
 
 History
 
 Identity issues
 
 Family values
 
 Immigration patterns
 
 Religion
 
 Ethics
 
 Art, music, and dance
 
 Beliefs and rituals
 
 Literature

81
 Chapter 4: Developing Cross-Cultural Competency
 
Ethnic studies courses can be heavy on the academic and light on the practical. 
Nonetheless, they can be interesting and helpful in understanding multicultural 
customers.
Learning another language
Learning to communicate in a foreign tongue is certainly easier said than 
done, but if you’re willing and able to invest the time and effort, it’s one of 
the best ways to discover another culture and bridge the gap with customers 
who already speak the language.
One of the most fascinating aspects of any language is the influence it has on 
the culture itself and the thinking and behaviors of its people. The German 
philosopher Heidegger wrote that humanity lives in the house of language, 
meaning that a person’s thoughts and expressions (the content of what they 
think and say) are heavily influenced by their language (the form that their 
expressions take). Consider, for example, the fact that the Chinese alphabet 
consists not of letters or an alphabet but of pictures — in fact, China is where 
the expression “A picture is worth a thousand words” originated.
Language studies can lead to other fascinating discoveries. If you take a 
course in Mandarin Chinese, for example, you’re likely to find out that 
Mandarin is spoken in mainland China and Taiwan but not in Hong Kong. 
A Spanish class is likely to give you a better understanding of the English 
language, because of the many similarities between English and Spanish 
rules of grammar.
The mere thought of picking up a new language can be overwhelming, but 
you don’t have to master a language to reap the benefits. Just becoming 
familiar with a few words and phrases is often an excellent way to demon-
strate to customers that you’re sincerely interested in them and committed 
to serving them and their community. Being able to speak and understand 
the basics of a foreign language can also make travel more enjoyable.
 
The quickest way to master a new language is through an immersion program. 
With most immersion programs, you take the course at a college or univer-
sity in a country where the language is spoken. In other words, you study 
Spanish in Spain or Mexico or another Spanish-speaking country, or you study 
Mandarin Chinese in Beijing. You usually attend the program for a week to 
several months or longer. In an immersion program, you not only speak the 
language 24 hours a day, both inside the classroom and on the streets, but 
you can also experience your host country’s food, history, sights, and culture. 
Of course, these programs aren’t cheap. Including airfare, a typical immersion 
program may cost several thousand dollars for just one week, but just think of 
all the fun you’ll have! If you consider it a working vacation, the cost isn’t that 
unreasonable.

82
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
If an immersion program doesn’t strike your fancy, consider taking an inex-
pensive foreign language class at a community college. Classes typically meet 
once or twice a week for 12 to 18 weeks, and that’s usually the only time you 
have to really practice the language. Gaining mastery can take several years, 
but if you’re committed to it and you don’t mind picking it up slowly, this is a 
definite option.
Asking the Experts
Many people are afraid of insulting others by asking them about their dif-
ferences, which may be the biggest contributor to cultural illiteracy. In 
reality, not asking ultimately offends more people, because then you end up 
approaching the person in a state of ignorance. Instead of knowing how the 
person would prefer to be greeted, for example, you have to assume, and 
assumptions can be pretty dangerous.
Just imagine how much damage you could do by making false assumptions 
about what other people wanted. Instead of asking everyone at the table 
whether they would like salt or pepper, for example, you simply start season-
ing their food for them. Or say you run up to a woman you’ve only met once 
and give her a big hug. As Americans, we’re accustomed to asking probing 
questions of people in our own culture, but when it comes to dealing with 
others whom we understand even less, we’re more reluctant to ask them 
about their needs, desires, and expectations.
Unfortunately, without a clear understanding of other cultures, people tend 
to assume the worst, such as the following:
 
 When a customer refuses to shake hands, you may assume she’s 
unfriendly or rude. She may simply be uncomfortable with this form of 
greeting, just as many longtime Americans are uncomfortable hugging 
anyone except their closest relatives.
 
 When a customer backs away, you may think she doesn’t like you. She 
may just be trying to establish a more comfortable distance.
 
 When a customer doesn’t establish eye contact, you may take it as a 
sign that the person doesn’t respect you or want to hear what you have 
to say, when it actually means the opposite.
 
 When a customer starts speaking in his native tongue to others in his 
party, you may assume you’ve lost the sale. This type of conversation is 
actually a strong sign that the person is interested.

83
 Chapter 4: Developing Cross-Cultural Competency
 
Go ahead and ask people about their food, language, cultural practices, and 
beliefs. They want you to understand them. If you don’t ask your questions, 
you have no hope of hearing your customers clearly through the cultural static. 
(Cultural static consists of unspoken thoughts and unanswered questions 
about a person’s background that clutter your mind that then interfere with 
your ability to communicate.) Here are common and important questions that 
often go unasked, creating cultural static:
 
 Where are you from?
 
 What is your ethnic heritage?
 
 What is your native language?
 
 What does the colored dot on the forehead signify?
 
 Why do you wear a turban?
 
 Why do you wear a head scarf?
 
 Why do you wear ethnic clothing in America?
 
 Why do you hand me your business card with both hands?
 
 Why won’t you look at me when I’m talking to you?
 
 Why do you have to negotiate over every little item?
 
 Why do you sign a contract and then continue to negotiate?
 
 Why don’t you do as Americans do when you’re in this country?
If you’ve ever thought any of these questions or something like them and 
didn’t ask, you unintentionally created cultural static that kept you from 
clearly hearing your customers’ wants and needs. You can’t develop cultural 
competency and trusting relationships if you don’t ask questions to satisfy 
your curiosity and listen to the rationale that gives rise to the differences 
between you and others.
 
How do you cut through cultural static? Simple. Go ahead and ask any ques-
tion that pops into your head and recognize that it probably won’t be inter-
preted as offensive. People from diverse cultures would prefer that you ask 
and get it out of the way. What you’ll discover is that ethnic people generally 
enjoy talking about their backgrounds. People from cultures outside this coun-
try know that some of their practices can seem strange to Americans, and 
they want to welcome you into their world. Once inside, you’re likely to find 
that seemingly odd behaviors actually make a great deal of sense.

84
Part I: Mastering the Multicultural Mind-Set 
Embracing Change
People tend to get set in their ways at the expense of their happiness. The 
fact is that change occurs whether or not you accept it. Resisting it simply 
saps your energy, wastes precious time, and can make you bitter.
Sure, change is disruptive, but think about it. We’d venture to guess that 
some of the biggest changes in your life led to the most happiness; for 
example, graduating high school or college, getting married, having children, 
starting a business, and changing careers can all be highly stressful and chal-
lenging, but when you look back, you see that they resulted in the greatest 
amount of personal growth and opportunity.
 
The same is true when your market becomes more diverse. If you dig in your 
heels and refuse to change because “I’ve always done it this way” or because 
“They immigrated here, so they should be the ones to change,” you’re likely to 
miss out on a golden opportunity to grow both personally and professionally. 
You may even jeopardize your survival in the new global economy.
Realize and accept the fact that change brings about uncertainty. What 
worked before isn’t necessarily going to be effective today and in the future. 
You can start small, such as just eating an ethnic food that you’ve never tried 
before, and then work your way up to greater challenges, like mastering a 
new language.
Purchasing this book was your first step in changing the way you do business 
with multicultural customers. Now you’re ready for bigger challenges.

In this part . . .
O
ne of the first things you need to do to start selling 
in the multicultural marketplace is to revamp your 
marketing materials — translate them into the target lan-
guage, if necessary, and retool them to appeal to your 
audience. In this part, we show you how.
We also show you how to maximize your appeal to other 
cultures by implementing changes throughout your com-
pany in sales, marketing, customer service, and finance; 
redesigning your office or store; and introducing new 
products and services that your target market may find 
more appealing.
Our goal in this part is to assist you in going beyond the 
point of looking multicultural to the point of being 
multicultural.

 Generating positive PR in the communities you want to serve
Y
ou may be the most culturally astute salesperson in the world, but if 
your marketing campaign is plastered exclusively with photos of white, 
middle-class Americans or worded in such a way that fails to appeal to cus-
tomers from other cultures, you may be turning away a huge segment of your 
potential market.
Marketing (and advertising) is never enough, of course. After you get folks 
from your desired market segment to call or visit, you need to persuade them 
to buy, return, and refer you to everyone they know. Getting them to call or 
visit, however, is the first item of business, and that’s all about marketing. 
(Throughout this chapter, we use the terms marketing and marketing cam-
paign as umbrella terms that cover marketing, advertising, public relations, 
and branding. Although we’re well aware of the distinctions, we prefer to use 
marketing as the general term to describe all efforts to get the word out about 
whatever you’re selling.)
In this chapter, we offer some strategies and tips to adjust your marketing 
materials in a way that makes them much more appealing to people of other 
cultures, and we help you choose the right media to reach the people who 
need to hear your message.
 
In this chapter, we focus on the nuances of adjusting your marketing and 
advertising to appeal to multicultural consumers. To brush up on the basics,

Critiquing Your Current 
Marketing Campaign
Critiquing your current marketing campaign is like trying to get advice from a 
therapist. You describe all the problems you’re having and everything you’re 
doing to deal with those problems. When you’re done, your therapist looks at 
you and asks, “And how’s that working for you?” This is exactly the question 
you should be asking about your current marketing campaign, but you can 
break it down even further:
 
 What results would indicate that my marketing campaign is having the 
desired effect on my target market?
 
 Is what I’m currently doing achieving the desired effect?
The big mistake that most companies and salespeople make is that they 
have no means of coming up with answers to these questions, or no means 
for quantifying the results. They simply roll out their latest marketing cam-
paign and then sit back in the hopes of getting a feel for how it’s working. 
They say stuff like, “Well, I feel like it’s working” or “It seems to be bringing 
in more business.” Your time and money, however, are too precious to “trust 
the force.” In the following sections, we explain how to review your current 
marketing campaign with a clear eye so you know exactly what you need to 
change.
Even the experts struggle to 
attract diverse customers
According to Advertising Age magazine, pro-
fessional marketers are hiring more specialists 
and spending more money than ever to reach 
the exploding multicultural market. However, 
the magazine points out that even the experts 
are divided over how best to attract the atten-
tion of multicultural consumers, and they’re not 
sure whether they’re getting good returns on 
their investments.
The magazine cites a survey commissioned by 
recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles that reveals 
that a great deal of confusion exists over how to 
most effectively target Hispanics, Blacks, and 
Asians. In fact, one longtime ad exec said that 
marketers don’t understand the ethnic market 
any better than they did 20 years ago. Although 
everyone seems to recognize the importance of 
multicultural marketing, getting management’s 
support for such efforts can be a monumental 
challenge.

89
 Chapter 5: Building a Marketing Campaign with Global Appeal
 
Start your multicultural marketing program by having your advisory board 
review your current advertising and public relations efforts. Obtain feedback 
about how appropriate your marketing approach is for the new customers 
you’re trying to reach. Perhaps your approach is fine as is, but don’t count 
on it; your present campaign probably wasn’t designed for multicultural audi-
ences. (See Chapter 2 for details on forming an advisory board and on painting 
a picture of your business’s typical multicultural customer.)
Tracking your results
 
You can’t gauge the effectiveness of your marketing efforts if you haven’t gath-
ered any data, because you need a baseline from which to measure success. 
Gathering data when you don’t know what you’re looking for is a little like hunt-
ing for mushrooms in the woods when you don’t know which ones are edible — 
it can be a waste of time at best and dangerous at worst. Here’s the type of data 
you need to gather to measure the success of your current campaign:
 
 How many customers call or visit your business on a daily basis?
 
 What are the ethnicities of these customers?
 
 What’s the average dollar amount each customer spends?
 
 What sorts of results are you expecting?
Answers to these questions, along with estimates of the size of your multicul-
tural market (see Chapter 2), will give you a clearer idea of just how big your 
potential market is, your share of the market, and whether the results of your 
marketing efforts are living up to your expectations.
 
You can collect data on the effectiveness of a specific marketing effort in 
several ways:
 
 Design a special coupon for each publication you advertise in. When you 
collect the coupons, you can tell which publications they came from.
 
 Ask your business telephone service provider or hire a marketing 
company to provide you with a service that tracks call-ins. Such a ser-
vice allows you to assign a special phone number to each ad. When 
a customer calls that number, the system records the number that the 
customer called, and you can track where callers are seeing your ads.
 
 Instruct your frontline staff to ask every customer how they happened 
to hear about you and tally the results.
 
 Conduct ethnic consumer focus group interviews to determine the 
impact of various components of your marketing program.

After you have gathered the necessary data, enter it into your handy-dandy 
spreadsheet program or whatever software you use to analyze market data. 
You can compare your expectations to the real numbers to get a general idea 
of whether your current marketing campaign is a roaring success, a costly 
flop, or something in between. The next section shows you how to calculate 
the actual return on your investment.
Calculating your ROI (return 
on investment)
 
Though you can get a vague sense of the return on your investment (ROI) by 
observing changes in the demographics of who shows up at your business, 
you should calculate the actual dollar amount of the return on your invest-
ment. It’s a pretty easy formula:
ROI = (Payback – Investment)/Investment × 100%
For example, if you generate $3,000 additional sales through a newspaper ad 
campaign that cost $1,000, your ROI is 200 percent:
ROI = ($3,000 – $1,000)/$1,000 × 100% = 200%
This means for every one dollar invested you received two in return, which 
is truly a sign of a worthwhile campaign, compared with the return on other 
advertising media as well as previous marketing attempts.
Generally speaking, the higher the ROI, the more successful your marketing cam-
paign. If you’re losing money or your ROI falls short of your goal, however, don’t 
scrap it entirely. Sometimes a few minor tweaks can deliver the desired results.
 
You can also assess your marketing success in terms of market share. First, do 
some general market research, as we explain in Chapter 2, to find out the per-
centage of ethnic families and consumers in your marketing area. Then answer 
this question: Based upon your company’s overall market share, are you getting 
your share of ethnic consumers? As long as your multicultural market share is 
pretty comparable to your overall market share, you’re doing fairly well.
Aiming Your Campaign 
at Your Target Market
A common mistake, even among professional marketing people, is to take a 
buckshot approach to marketing by targeting “multicultural customers.” For 
your marketing materials to have the most impact, however, you’re better off 

91
 Chapter 5: Building a Marketing Campaign with Global Appeal
aiming at a smaller target — not only an ethnic group, but a group within 
that group. This subgroup may consist of people with a different level 
of acculturation or socioeconomic status or a specific age group. (For more 
about acculturation, see “Adjusting for different cultures and levels of 
acculturation,” later in this chapter.)
 
Make an effort to connect with local ethnic organizations, including chambers 
of commerce and houses of worship, as suggested in Chapter 4. In addition 
to increasing your exposure to different cultures and customs, these estab-
lishments are good sources of information, and they may have business lists 
that you can get on for a minimal donation or fee. Supporting other ethnic 
programs and events can generate a high level of loyalty for your business and 
products.
In the following sections, we offer some guidance on how to build a more 
targeted campaign. See Chapter 2 for details on how to determine your 
business’s target market.
 
The changes to your marketing campaign need to be more than skin deep. 
Yes, you do need to revamp your ads and displays to make them more appeal-
ing to your prospective multicultural customers, but you also need to get your 
timing right, scale back your verbiage for high-context cultures, adjust for dif-
ferent levels of acculturation and cultural beliefs, avoid potentially inflamma-
tory language or stereotypes, and translate your ads into the language of your 
target market. Perhaps most important, you need to make sure you have staff 
on hand who can serve the hordes of multicultural customers that your mar-
keting efforts will draw to your business. In the following sections, we show 
you how to attend to all of these tasks.
Getting the timing right
Great salespeople, particularly those who specialize in retail sales, never 
miss seasonal opportunities, such as Christmas, or special days, such as 
Mother’s Day or Valentine’s Day. At least they think they never miss these 
opportunities. Salespeople who lack cultural competency often miss out on 
these same opportunities in the multicultural marketplace because they’re 
unaware that customers from other cultures follow a different calendar. For 
example:
 
 Mother’s Day (Día de las Madres) is observed on May 10 in Latin American 
countries, rather than on the second Sunday in May as in the U.S.
 
 In mainland China and Taiwan, Valentine’s Day is observed in July rather 
than February. Valentine’s Day is so special in Japan that the Japanese 
celebrate it on two days. On February 14, only women give gifts to their 
beaus, and on March 14 the men take their turn.

92
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
 
 On December 26, Kwanzaa, the African American celebration of traditional 
African values of family, community responsibility, commerce, and self-
improvement, is celebrated but has nothing to do with Christmas.
 
To get more in tune with differences in other cultures’ calendars, check out 
our cross-cultural holiday calendar in the appendix. Also, consult with an 
expert from the culture you’re targeting to make any further adjustments to 
your marketing calendar.
After you identify holidays and other dates of importance to your multicul-
tural clientele, do some research to find out more about these special days 
and the customs that surround them. By developing a better understanding 
of these occasions, you’re in a better position to ensure that your advertise-
ments and promotions are in line with the spirit of the holiday.
Trimming the fat: Less is more
Marketing people often are tempted to deliver as much information as possible 
about their product and its benefits, but many multicultural customers come 
from very high-context cultures where less is more. As we explain in Chapter 
3, these folks rely more on nonverbal communications, facial expressions, and 
body language to convey meaning, instead of being obvious and redundant 
with words. In low-context cultures, such as the United States and Germany, 
ads tend to be wordy and in your face. High-context cultures prefer ads that 
more subtly convey the message with graphics and implied meanings.
Take a look at the two ads shown in Figure 5-1. The low-context Oil and 
Natural Gas Industry ad (Figure 5-1a) relies almost exclusively on words as 
well as facts and figures to convey meaning and persuade. The ad includes 
a photo, but it’s so small that it’s almost invisible and really doesn’t directly 
relate to the ad copy. The high-context Citgo ad (Figure 5-1b) relies mostly on 
the picture to convey the meaning. Words are kept to a minimum. The image 
dominates the ad and is designed to stir emotions and create good feelings 
about the advertiser. Unfortunately, the multicultural kids in the picture are 
in the back and nearly invisible — almost as an afterthought.
 
The moral of the story: Say less, sell more.
Adjusting for different cultures 
and levels of acculturation
Every culture has its own “thing” or more appropriately, its own “things” — 
certain values that influence people’s behaviors, including how they shop for 
and decide to buy goods and services. But keep in mind that these cultural influ-
ences can diminish over time as future generations become more acculturated.

In the following sections, we explore some of these more influential values 
and highlight specific instances in the real world.
A sample of value-related tendencies
 
Almost all cultures on the planet have been around a lot longer than the 
American culture, so they’ve had time to develop long-standing values, such 
as these:
 
 Established cultures may prefer tried-and-true products as opposed to 
new-and-improved ones. The Latino, Asian, and Middle Eastern cultures 
have long histories and tend to appreciate longevity.
 
 African Americans have developed their own music, dance, foods, and 
other cultural basics. They want to know that you’re an integral and 
long-standing part of the community before trusting you with their 
money. Because of their history, they can be a bit mistrustful at first 
until they see that you’re committed to them and not just their money.
 
 Asian Indians and Pakistanis tend to gravitate toward products that are 
perceived to be “high class.” They’re also willing to pay for the higher 
quality and prestige these items offer.
 
 Native Americans often want to know that you’re sensitive to the 
environment as well as their community.

94
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
 
 Russians can be very frugal given the shortages many have experienced 
in the recent past in their home country. They tend to have traditional 
European tastes which are different from American preferences.
A look at family structures
According to Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy, “Happy families are all alike; 
every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” This is certainly true, but 
even happy families tend to differ across cultures. Consider the following 
examples:
 
 The average American family used to consist of a father, mother, and 
one or two children, but today it’s much smaller than in the past.
 
 Hispanic and Asian families regularly consist of a father, mother, several 
children, grandparents, and often cousins. Children tend to live at home 
longer than in traditional American families, and they may even continue 
living there with their spouse after marriage. (This practice can actually 
save you money on marketing because you can reach more people with 
the same advertisements.)
 
 African American families are predominately of two types: traditional 
family structures, much like Anglo American families, and female head of 
household families. Make sure the images in your advertisements convey 
the type of family you’re selling to. In the African American culture, god-
parents can be an integral part of the family structure to help encourage 
children and teach strong values by setting a good example. You may 
want to include them in family photos in your marketing materials.
Segmenting the market based on 
different acculturation levels
A study by Nielsen PreView divided Hispanics 
into three segments:
  Most acculturated: More than one third of 
the Hispanic population falls into this cat-
egory. They speak mostly English, and their 
buying habits are very similar to the general 
market.
  Bicultural: More than half of Hispanics in 
the U.S. are bicultural and bilingual with 
buying habits that closely resemble the 
general market. However, those habits can 
vary depending on the brand, category, 
region, and other factors.
  Least acculturated: The least acculturated 
Hispanics have buying habits that are the 
most different from the general market. 
These folks generally prefer items and 
shopping experiences like they would find 
in their homeland.

95
 Chapter 5: Building a Marketing Campaign with Global Appeal
 
Keep in mind that minority families tend to be younger and larger, which 
not only accounts for their explosive population growth, but also means 
you target them differently (as explained in “Aiming Your Campaign at Your 
Target Market”). For example, in 2005, the median age of Caucasians in the 
United States was around 40 years old, while the average ages of Hispanics, 
African Americans, and Asians were 27, 30, and 35 years old, respectively. For 
the same year, the average family size of Whites in the United States was 2.1, 
whereas the average Hispanic family contained 4.7 members.
The importance of different acculturation levels
The longer you’re in a country, the more you tend to adapt to the cultural 
habits and ways of thinking. This is what acculturation is all about, and it 
results in creating ethnic subgroups — first-, second-, and third-generation 
populations — each of which responds differently to a company’s marketing 
and advertising.
 
Your target market’s acculturation level influences how you market to them. 
First-generation immigrants, for example, are much more likely to have 
preferences and tastes of their homeland and be more comfortable seeing or 
hearing ads in their native language. Customers who’ve lived in the United 
States longer tend to have acquired more traditional American tastes and be 
more fluent in English. See Chapter 9 for more details on selling to immigrants 
of different generations.
Acculturation varies according to more than just how long a person has been 
in the States. It also depends on how different the person’s native language is 
from English, how the person was raised, her age, education level, economic 
status, type of neighborhood where the person lives, and other factors. 
Generally speaking, however, new immigrants are less likely to speak English 
fluently and are less acculturated than people who’ve been here for several 
generations. So, how long have some groups been in the U.S.? Following are 
some valuable statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau (from 2000):
 
 Nearly 70 percent of people from Asia were born outside the U.S.
 
 Forty percent of Hispanics in the U.S. were foreign born.
 
 Eight percent of Blacks were foreign born.
Accounting for cultural beliefs
Marketing professionals are so attuned to American beliefs and superstitions 
that they rarely step on consumers’ toes by mistakenly introducing offensive 
elements in their ads. You’re not likely to see the number 13 given a prominent 

96
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
position in any ad, for example. Likewise, advertisers tend to avoid the color 
red (which reminds Americans of blood) and religious symbols (which could 
turn people off).
 
When developing marketing materials to advertise to other ethnic groups, you 
still have to remain aware of colors, numbers, and symbols that can turn cus-
tomers away. They’re just different colors, numbers, and symbols, depending 
on the group. For example:
 
 Red is the color of death in Korea.
 
 White is the color of death in China and Japan, where red is considered 
good luck.
 
 Purple signifies death in Mexico.
 
 In most western cultures, red symbolizes passion, love, or danger.
 
 The number 4 for most Asians is equivalent to the number 13 in 
America.
 
 To truly understand the power of the number 4 in Asia, consider the fact 
that a Chinese tea set generally comes with five cups rather than four. 
Most Asian merchants avoid packaging products in sets of four or label-
ing them with a “4,” even on the price tag. Even a bank advertising loans 
at the low interest rate of 4.44 percent could be bad. One day I (Michael) 
got an uneasy feeling driving next to a truck that prominently featured 
the business owner’s phone number as “444-4444.” Although it may be 
memorable to most people, if your phone number contains unlucky 
digits for your customers, using an alternative contact number when 
trying to appeal to them would be wise. Many may find it easier to pass 
you by than take a chance dialing an unlucky phone number.
 
 The number 7 is unlucky in Ghana and Kenya but lucky in India and the 
Czech Republic.
 
 Dogs are considered unclean in Muslim countries. In Scotland, police 
had to issue an apology to Scottish Muslims who became upset when 
the police department included a photo of its popular 6-month-old 
German shepherd police pup on a postcard used to advertise a new 
nonemergency phone number.
 
 The number 8 for most Asians is the equivalent to the American “lucky 7.” 
Some people believe in lucky numbers so much that recently a gentle-
man in Taiwan paid $1.5 million for the personalized license plate “8888.” 
Before you scoff at that, you may want to ask yourself, “Where does 
someone get $1.5 million for a license plate?” Could it be because he 
believes in numerology?
For additional culture-specific do’s and don’ts, check out the appendix.

 Chapter 5: Building a Marketing Campaign with Global Appeal
Avoiding potentially offensive stereotypes
Want to upset your Hispanic customers? Choose as your company’s mascot a 
Chihuahua who speaks with an exaggerated Hispanic accent or a bandit who 
loves to steal tasty corn chips from unsuspecting consumers. If you’d rather 
upset the Asian community, select the right font — some English text that 
looks “Oriental.”
 
To avoid making such mistakes, consult with someone who’s mastered the 
sensitivities of your target market — preferably one or more people who 
are members of this market and understand the issues that can trigger a 
backlash. In the nearby sidebar, two multicultural experts highlight the 
importance of making comprehensive rather than merely cosmetic changes 
to your marketing program.
Repopulating your pictures
The first rule in multicultural marketing is to get some people in your photos 
who are in the same ethnic group (not sort of the same) as the people you’re 
targeting. For example, Asians can tell the difference between pictures of 
Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, or Filipinos.
Grasping the origins of superstitious numbers
Many Asians believe that the number 4 
is unlucky. Upon first hearing that, most 
Americans think it’s just a silly superstition. But 
the Chinese have a perfectly reasonable expla-
nation for their fear of the number 4. In Chinese, 
the number 4 is pronounced “sei” in Cantonese, 
whereas the word for death is also pronounced 
“sei” with a slightly different accent. They are 
similar in Mandarin as well.
Because the words for 4 and death sound so 
similar, Chinese people try to avoid the number 
4 whenever possible in phone numbers, 
addresses, and even in pricing. When you think 
about it, this belief isn’t so different from the 
American belief that the number 13 is unlucky, 
and we also avoid its use in hospitals, hotels, 
high rise buildings, and elsewhere. Different 
but not so different, eh? Because the words 
for 4 and death also sound similar in Japanese, 
they likewise try to avoid the number whenever 
possible.
Similarly, many cultures have lucky numbers. In 
China the number 8 is thought to be fortuitous 
because it’s pronounced “baat” in Cantonese, 
while the word for rich is also pronounced 
“baat” but with a different accent. Many 
Filipinos like the number 7 so much that former 
President Ferdinand Marcos used to write all 
of his laws in seven parts and would keep visi-
tors waiting for exactly seven minutes. In the 
United States, many people consider the same 
number lucky.

98
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
 
One of the easiest ways to remind people of their minority status is to shove a 
picture in their face that is completely void of anyone looking remotely similar 
to themselves. This is exactly what you don’t want to do. By including people 
of their race or culture, you give them the feeling that they belong with the 
product or service you’re selling.
 
Also keep in mind the different definitions of what constitutes a family. For the 
African American community, you may have different photos of both a male 
and female head of household and several children, along with a godparent or 
two. A Hispanic family may be comprised of a father, mother, several children, 
cousins, grandparents, uncles, and aunts. An Asian family may include several 
generations of children living at home along with their families. (See the ear-
lier section, “A look at family structures,” for additional information.)
As you’re composing or selecting the graphics for your ads, keep in mind that 
images (not just pictures of people) can also evoke strong emotions, some of 
which may be culturally influenced. Be careful to include culturally appropri-
ate images. Some images can be downright offensive to some groups, such as 
the eagle, which is the symbol of death in the Middle East, and clocks, which 
are the symbol of death in China.
Relying on specialists to make comprehensive 
marketing changes
Howard Buford, president and CEO of Prime 
Access Inc. (www.primeaccess.net), a 
company that develops multicultural market-
ing and advertising campaigns aimed at urban 
audiences, suggests that companies partner 
with experts who know how to reach their 
target audience:
 
 “One of the big mistakes that is almost 
always done by mainstream advertis-
ing agencies is to treat talking to African 
Americans as a casting issue, keeping 
everything else in the advertising the same, 
such as the dialogue, wardrobe, and the 
product benefits. Huge mistake. Not only 
can it not have a good result, but it can 
actually backfire and look phony and inau-
thentic. It ends up making that brand look 
like they don’t really understand African 
Americans. African Americans are not a 
darker version of white Americans.”
The late Virgil Scott, former CEO of Anderson 
Communications (www.AnderCom.com), 
a company that provides programs focused 
on vital health issues affecting the African 
American community, reinforces the need to 
work with specialists:
 
 “Many ad agencies are not truly multicul-
tural experts. They’ve expanded their busi-
ness because their current general market 
clients say, ‘Hey, we’ve got this Black thing 
going on. Do you guys want a shot at it?’ 
They don’t really have the history, the 
knowledge, or the savvy to really target 
Black folks because they don’t know them. 
So how do you avoid stereotypes? You 
gotta make sure you’ve got a partner who 
knows Black people and that Black people 
aren’t a project but a way of life.”
These admonitions are true for marketing to any 
specialized target audience.

99
 Chapter 5: Building a Marketing Campaign with Global Appeal
Talking the talk in the target language
One of the first and most basic steps in adjusting your marketing materi-
als for ethnic markets is to convert everything into the target language and 
create in-language ads (ads in the consumer’s native tongue). This effort 
alone shows you care. In the following sections, we assist you in gauging 
the importance of converting your materials into your customers’ native 
language and explain why you have to do more than simply change the 
words. We also give you pointers on how to hire a translator or interpreter.
 
Translating consists of converting the written words of one language to 
another; interpretation generally refers to converting the spoken word. Two 
different modes of interpretation exist:
 
 Simultaneous interpretation is where the interpreter immediately 
speaks the message in the target language while listening to it in the 
source language. This is how verbal communication takes place at the 
United Nations.
 
 Consecutive interpretation is where the interpreter says the message in 
the source language after the speaker pauses. This mode is most com-
monly used in business. Always look at your customers, even when the 
interpreter is speaking.
In other words, you translate when you write; you interpret when you speak.
The importance of switching to your customers’ language
Customers’ language preference depends a great deal on their level of accul-
turation (see the “Adjusting for different cultures and levels of acculturation” 
section earlier in this chapter). Following are general guidelines on the rela-
tive importance of translating your materials into the prospective customer’s 
target language for various ethnic groups and acculturation levels:
 
 New immigrants who are highly “Americanized” tend to watch, listen 
to, and read mostly English media. You may still need to modify your 
message, but converting it into another language is unnecessary and 
probably ill-advised if you find yourself targeting this group.
 
 Most businesses that are trying to attract Hispanics make the mistake 
of pursuing only the most acculturated groups and stick with English. 
Make sure that your most likely prospects can respond to your offers 
in the language they’re most comfortable with.
 
 South Asians can present a unique challenge to marketers. This 
market encompasses the Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan, 
and Nepalese cultures, which consist of more than 30 languages and 
more than 300 dialects. However, according to the 2000 census, about 
88 percent of these were Asian Indians.

100
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
 
 Although most South Asians are fluent in English, you can’t simply aim 
ads to this group in English. In reaching these markets, some experts 
recommend advertising that features English dialogue interspersed with 
some South Asian words — what they call “Hinglish,” a mixture of Hindi 
and English.
 
In radio and television ads, be very careful about the interpretation. It’s not 
enough to know you have a large potential Chinese customer base, because 
that language has many different dialects. Find out which dialect your pro-
spective customers use. For instance, most longtime Chinese Americans speak 
the Cantonese dialect, whereas newer immigrants are more likely to speak 
Mandarin. The only way to know which dialect is going to be most effective is 
to survey your customers; we explain in Chapter 2.
The message is more than just the words
 
Talking the talk means more than just saying the exact same thing in a differ-
ent language. It means retooling your message in a way that makes your audi-
ence more receptive to it. You must translate not only words but also culture. 
Start from scratch to craft a message that’s likely to appeal to prospective 
customers on both an informational and emotional level.
If you’re marketing homes to Asians who are inclined to follow the guidelines 
of feng shui, for example, you may want to highlight features of the home that 
comply with those guidelines. You probably wouldn’t highlight the same fea-
tures if you were selling homes to Americans for whom feng shui was not an 
issue.
A translator or interpreter who has experience with the culture can assist 
you in composing an appropriate and appealing message and avoiding any 
potentially offensive words or phrases. When you have a draft of your ad, ask 
your multicultural advisory board (see Chapter 2) to review it and provide 
feedback.
 
Make sure you know exactly which group you’re targeting. You don’t want to 
make the mistake of translating your marketing materials into Japanese for a 
Chinese market. You’re probably thinking, “Well, yeah, duh!” but this happens 
more often than you may think.
Picking a good translator or interpreter
Converting one language into another is a skill that few people in the United 
States have mastered, so finding the right person for the job is often a tre-
mendous challenge.
 
 When hiring a translator, look for someone whose first language is the 
one you don’t know — the language you need to convert to. If you’re 
converting English to Spanish, you usually want to hire a native Spanish 
speaker. Also look for someone who has experience in your industry or 

101
 Chapter 5: Building a Marketing Campaign with Global Appeal
area of need, such as legal, business, or medical; this person is going to 
have a better grasp of special words and concepts. Translators usually 
get paid by the page or even by the word.
 
 For best results, provide the translator with additional guidance, such as 
how you plan to use the translated document, how accurate the transla-
tion needs to be, how much material you have to translate, and your 
deadline.
 
 When hiring an interpreter, recognize that just being bilingual doesn’t 
qualify a person to interpret, especially if you’re in an industry that uses 
highly specialized vocabulary. If you’re selling houses or cars, most 
bilingual people can probably handle the interpretation. If you’re selling 
pharmaceuticals or computer networking equipment, however, look for 
an interpreter who has some experience in the field. Interpreters are 
compensated by the hour or the day.
If your needs are modest — you need someone to interpret very basic words 
and concepts — a child could do it, quite literally. If the customers are 
accompanied by their child who knows English, the child can assist in iden-
tifying your customers’ needs and explaining your products or services. If, 
however, you’re involved in complex transactions involving legal documents, 
such as contracts and loan papers, hire a professional.
 
The American Translators Association has a free downloadable booklet called 
“Find a Translator or Interpreter” at www.ATAnet.org.
 
Avoid hack jobs. If you’ve ever tried to assemble a bookcase or Ping-Pong 
table made in India, China, or Bulgaria, chances are pretty good that you’ve 
encountered bad translations of instructions to English. Sure, you get English 
words, but the meaning is entirely mangled. Translating your marketing 
materials like this is worse than not translating them at all.
Anticipating increased volume
Don’t invite people to a party if you don’t have enough food and refreshments 
to serve everyone. Although this may seem obvious, it’s exactly the mistake 
many businesses make when they begin marketing to ethnic communities. 
They’re ill-prepared to serve the customers whom they’re marketing to.
 
Before you launch your marketing campaign, make sure you have everything 
in place to provide quality customer service. Here are a few items to consider:
 
 Properly trained staff: If you’re going to advertise in a different language, 
have at least one person on staff who speaks that language (see Chapter 
16). Here’s a cautionary tale: A large pizza chain in Los Angeles decided to 
try to capitalize on the huge and growing Hispanic population by sending 

102
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
discount coupons to Hispanic-surnamed households. Unfortunately, the 
company had an insufficient number of Spanish-speaking employees to 
take orders. As a result, the company ended up causing more damage 
to its reputation in the Hispanic community than if it had never tried to 
reach out to it.
 
 Foreign language signs: If you have signs around your business or store 
that customers commonly read, have them translated into the target lan-
guage. (See Chapter 7 for details.)
 
 Foreign language brochures, menus, forms, and documents: Get all of 
your printed materials that you hand out or show to customers trans-
lated into the target language. This may include contracts, disclosure 
statements, and financial documents.
The Most Bang for Your Buck: Picking 
the Right Marketing Media
When marketing to prospective customers, you can have the best brochure, 
print advertising, and radio and TV ads on the planet, but if you don’t deliver 
them through media that reach your target consumer, your efforts are in 
vain. For multicultural customers, you must be even more focused in your 
efforts.
It’s like going fishing. If you want to catch a particular type of fish — bass, 
for instance — you have to get everything right; use the right bait, fish in the 
right spot at the right time of day, present your lure or bait in a way a typical 
bass is going to find appealing, and so on. If you overlook one item, you’re 
likely to fail. You can have the best bait or lure in the world, for example, but 
unless you toss it where the bass hang out, you’re not going to hook one.
 
One baffling tactic is to produce a radio, TV, or newspaper ad entirely in 
English and then tack on something at the end like “Hablamos español.” First 
of all, how would a customer even know what the ad is about if he doesn’t 
understand English? Second, it shows that you consider the customer’s 
language an afterthought. Ads must be targeted to specific groups. This is a 
common mistake for those who are new to multicultural marketing.
In the following sections, we assist you with your choice of media.
Selecting mainstream media
Whether the use of mainstream media (newspapers and television and radio 
stations) in marketing to multicultural consumers is effective can vary a great 
deal depending on whom you’re trying to reach and how you go about it. 

103
 Chapter 5: Building a Marketing Campaign with Global Appeal
Generally speaking, the coverage by these outlets is too broad to effectively 
reach ethnic customers, so the return on investment can be rather disap-
pointing (see the “Calculating your ROI (return on investment)” section 
earlier in this chapter).
However, a 2007–2008 Yankelovich multicultural marketing study (www.
Yankelovich.com) shows that some ethnic consumers are even more 
receptive to advertising than most Americans. About 60 percent of African 
Americans and Hispanics, for example, say they “enjoy looking at or listening 
to advertising” compared with only 30 percent of non-Hispanic Whites. This 
means that your ad can be up to twice as effective as expected when targeted 
to these groups. The study goes on to stress that ethnic consumers have dis-
tinct preferences and respond to different emotional triggers than Whites do.
 
Every television and radio station has a rate card that lists the number of 
people it reaches at various times of the day. Some break these numbers down 
by age, ethnicity, gender, and other characteristics. Newspapers have similar 
information about their readers. Check to see whether they’re a match for the 
audience you’re trying to reach. Certain TV and radio programs also attract 
specific groups of viewers or listeners. Don’t waste money on media that have 
little or no market penetration into the groups you’re trying to reach.
Advertising through ethnic media
The growth of ethnic media in the United States is brisk. In New York City 
alone, you can find more than 150 ethnic newspapers reaching every conceiv-
able group. These are the outlets that really penetrate ethnic markets — the 
types of newspapers where you’ll get the most bang for your buck.
As revealed in the nearby sidebar “Tapping the emotional power of ethnic 
media,” ethnic media have much higher penetration into ethnic markets. You 
want to deliver a solid punch that focuses your marketing efforts exclusively 
on your target market. Ethnic media make this possible.
 
First, find out which media your customers access for information and enter-
tainment. You can do this through your own market research, as discussed in 
Chapter 2, or by examining some of the publications that your customers are 
likely to read, as we suggest in Chapter 4.
When examining print advertising, look past mere circulation numbers 
and ask for pass-along figures — the number of people who actually read 
the paper (not the number of subscribers). The good news is that in ethnic 
households, three to five people are likely to be reading the same paper 
(a pass-along figure of three, four, or five for one subscription); this can 
significantly lower the cost of reaching customers.

104
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
Most major cities have newspapers, magazines, radio, and television stations 
that serve ethnic groups. Contact a local advertising agency that has experi-
ence reaching the ethnic community.
 
Hispanics are especially fond of television and radio. Spanish-language televi-
sion can be particularly effective in reaching Hispanic customers. Univision, 
the largest Spanish-language television network in the United States, report-
edly has a penetration rate of more than 97 percent of Latino households! 
However, national outlets, such as Univision, Telemundo, Azteca America, 
and TeleFutura, may not be appropriate for local and regional businesses. 
Check with your local media representative to see what she can do for you. 
Another source of information is the Nielsen Hispanic Television Index 
(www.nielsenmedia.com/ethnicmeasure/hispanic-american/
indexHisp.html).
Harnessing the power of the Internet
In terms of how effective the Internet is at enabling you to reach ethnic 
groups, that really depends on the group:
Tapping the emotional power of ethnic media
According to a study led by Bendixen & Asso-
ciates (www.bendixenandassociates.
com), a Miami-based public-opinion polling 
firm, ethnic media is more effective than gen-
eral-market media in reaching diverse con-
sumers. The survey showed that 84 percent of 
respondents to a telephone survey received 
news and information from ethnic media outlets. 
For instance, Spanish-language media reach 
89 percent of California Latinos; media with a 
focus on African American interests reach 79 
percent of African American Californians; and 
Asian American ethnic media reach 75 percent 
of the Asian population in the state.
According to a national poll conducted by 
interTrend, most Asian Americans preferred 
seeing in-language ads, while only 17 percent 
preferred English. In addition, the National 
Association of Realtors has done research on 
in-language advertising and found that ads in 
Spanish are much more effective in reaching 
Hispanics. They discovered Spanish-language 
commercials are 61 percent more effective at 
increasing awareness, 57 percent more effec-
tive in message comprehension, and nearly 4.5 
times more persuasive.
So why would bilingual customers rather see 
and hear advertising in their native tongue 
rather than in a language they’re trying to learn? 
Studies show that people automatically use 
their most familiar language when discussing 
emotional issues, and money can certainly be 
one of the most emotional of all subjects. They 
then switch back to English when the commu-
nication becomes less emotional.

105
 Chapter 5: Building a Marketing Campaign with Global Appeal
 
 Asians tend to use the Internet more than Caucasians.
 
 Hispanics and blacks use the Internet a little less than Caucasians.
 
 Latinos tend to provide e-mail addresses on the Internet more than the 
general U.S. population.
 
 As socioeconomic status rises, so does Internet usage.
According to Jeff Yang, vice president and consumer strategist for 
Iconoculture (www.Iconoculture.com), “Asian Americans are far more 
likely to use the Internet for product comparison than any other group. Over 
80 percent of adult Asian Americans have used the Internet on a regular 
basis, and it remains one of the most powerful media for cracking this par-
ticular nut. Beyond that, Asian Americans are also more likely to use online 
banking than any other group. So I don’t know how many credit unions have 
actually taken that step yet, but it’s become a very powerful tool to sell into 
this market.”
 
If you don’t have a Web site or blog yet, set one up as soon as possible. You 
can launch a blog in about 15 minutes. You don’t necessarily have to set up an 
eCommerce Web site where customers can place orders and make payments, 
but most people at least do some research online before they run out and buy 
stuff. So make sure you’re reaching those people if they’re your market. For 
assistance with building a Web site or blog, check out Building a Web Site For 
Dummies by David A. Crowder or Blogging For Dummies by Susannah Gardner 
and Shane Birley (both published by Wiley).
 
James Wong, vice president of marketing for e21 Corporation (www.e21mm.
com), offers several additional recommendations:
 
 Link from your home page to in-language pages for people who may not 
speak English as a first language. (This can depend on the acculturation 
level of the potential customer. We discuss acculturation in detail earlier 
in this chapter.) Make sure you use a translator who’s familiar not only 
with the language, but also with the culture and the products or services 
you’re selling, as we explain in the section “Picking a good translator or 
interpreter” earlier in this chapter.
 
 Use opt-in e-mail to stay in touch with customers. eNewsletters can be 
very effective if you have the recipients’ permission to send them.
 
 Use Internet portals to target online consumers. Some Internet portals 
have a fairly sophisticated way to slice and dice names for local busi-
nesses. (An Internet portal is simply a site that provides links to other 
Web sites or search tools to help people find what they’re looking for. 
By having your Web site or blog added to portals that people in your 
target market are likely to use, you can begin to tap into the traffic that 
flows through the portal.)

Establishing a Community Presence
Community sells, both online and off. Being a trusted member of the commu-
nity is like setting up shop in a small town, where word-of-mouth advertising 
prevails. You become the go-to guy or gal for whatever it is you’re selling. 
The only downside is that you need to earn community support, and you may 
have to work at it a long time before you see any return on your investment. 
We reveal what you need to know in the following sections.
 
Although community marketing certainly requires more time and effort and 
takes longer for you to make cultural inroads than most traditional ad cam-
paigns, it certainly can be worth the effort in the long run. At the beginning of 
any relationship, people of all cultures are going to exhibit some reluctance and 
reticence. After they get to know and trust you, however, they’re more likely to 
patronize your business and send even more referral business your way.
Only long-termers need apply: 
Committing to the community
Marketing to ethnic communities is not a one-shot or short-term effort. You 
have to make a long-term commitment and develop a lasting presence. Many 
companies, for example, seem to believe that all they have to do to appeal 
to the African American community is to take out ads during Black History 
Month. As Howard Buford of Prime Access Inc. explains, “That’s a common 
mistake. First of all, there’s too much clutter, because a lot of competitive 
companies end up doing their one advertisement during that month. You 
don’t really break through, and it doesn’t really say anything about your 
product. It just kind of says, ‘We value African American history.’ One thing 
that African Americans look for is not just an advertising campaign that runs 
for three to six months. They’re looking for a consistent, ongoing presence in 
their community that is meaningful to them.”
 
Establish partnerships with the communities you want to serve, because 
you can’t succeed unless the community and its members succeed. Your 
goal is to show them that they can’t be as successful without you. You can 
often make a long-term commitment to ethnic business and community orga-
nizations through ethnic chambers of commerce (see Chapter 4 for more on 

108
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
getting involved with these groups). You can also reach many of these groups 
through religious organizations that serve these communities (see the next 
section for details).
How do you show ethnic communities that you’re a valuable partner? 
According to Jeff Yang, a multicultural marketing consultant, you gather the 
leaders together and form a partnership. Here’s the advice that Jeff offered a 
bank client, which is applicable to any business:
“It’s becoming ever more important for the grass-roots leaders to be in 
touch with the decision makers at the local branch. Pull all the leaders 
and decision makers together: the bank managers and executives, com-
munity leaders, the heads of chambers of commerce, business leaders 
(of businesses both large and small), membership institutions that draw 
large numbers of potential customers, and so on. Then, you basically 
tell them, ‘Look, we’re treating this as a partnership. We know that we 
have a lot to offer you, but more importantly, you have a lot to offer us. 
Let’s share ways in which we can do that together.’ Now, if this is done 
properly, you have the beginnings of something that can prove extremely 
powerful.”
Getting involved in special events
Community is particularly important in high-context cultures, including 
Hispanic and Asian groups (see Chapter 3 for more on high-context cultures), 
and one of the best ways to get your foot in the door is by supporting cul-
tural fairs and community events, such as the following:
 
 Cinco de Mayo and Día de las Muertos events are common in Hispanic 
communities.
 
 Chinese New Years and the Cherry Blossom Festival are events often 
held in Chinese and Japanese communities, respectively.
 
 Indian Independence Day and Divali celebrations are celebrated in South 
Asian communities.
 
 Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Kwanzaa are opportunities to reach 
African Americans.
 
 Ethnic music festivals.
 
 Ethnic heritage celebrations.
 
 Ethnic dance troupes.
 
 Culturally specific sporting events.
 
 Fundraising events.
 
 Nonprofit efforts by ethnic groups.

109
 Chapter 5: Building a Marketing Campaign with Global Appeal
 
 Service organizations’ efforts.
 
 School events.
 
 Cultural institutions.
 
 Ethnic chambers of commerce events (see Chapter 4 for more about 
chambers of commerce).
 
 Health fairs.
 
For a comprehensive calendar of special holidays and celebrations, check out 
the appendix.
In most cases, you can offer to sponsor the event or set up and run a booth, 
but if you’re not sure how to get involved, ask. Contact the leader of the 
group that’s hosting the celebration; she’ll be glad to educate you.
 
Think outside the booth. Everyone sets up a booth, so think creatively. Ask 
the organizers about the products and services that people in their commu-
nity really need. Following are a couple of ideas that can get your creative 
juices flowing:
 
 One credit union has had great success partnering with local police 
departments in a Kid ID program that fingerprints children to help 
identify them if they are abducted or turn up missing.
 
 Healthcare tie-ins are very effective in attracting ethnic groups, par-
ticularly Hispanics and African Americans. If you’re in the healthcare 
industry, consider stationing a health information van at the event and 
providing free screenings for common conditions that particularly affect 
your target market.
 
 Consider teaming up with local ethnic restaurants to explore co-promotional 
opportunities. As we point out in Chapter 4, food is an important part of 
cultural celebrations and often serves as a bridge between cultures. The 
door to a culture’s heart is often through its stomach, so familiarize yourself 
with the unique aspects of the foods of the customers you serve.
 
Don’t dive into a community event without checking the water first. Such 
over-enthusiasm can be costly and time consuming. Here are some criteria 
to consider when choosing events:
 
 Is this event consistent with the image I want to project?
 
 Does the organizer have a track record of producing successful events?
 
 What is the organizer’s reputation in the community?
 
 How many times has this event been held?
 
 How many people usually attend?
 
 Are potential customers for my business going to attend?

110
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
 
 Is the cost worth the benefit?
 
 How will I measure the value of my investment?
 
 How long am I willing to invest in this event?
Turning face time into cash
Calculating the ROI on public relations efforts, such as renting a booth at 
an ethnic fair, can be a bit of a challenge. Bill Imada, president of iW Group 
(www.iwgroupinc.com), which specializes in marketing to Asian Americans, 
notes that many marketing directors and other executives complain that they 
give out thousands of pens or other novelties at multicultural fairs and other 
events but are unclear on what they’re getting in return (their ROI). They’re 
concerned that while such activities increase their visibility, they have no 
idea of how this translates into sales.
Imada says companies should work toward turning face time into cash. He 
suggests that company representatives give away items that people will 
stand in line for at these events. Although the items don’t need to be expen-
sive, they do need to be unique, useful, and clever. As people wait to get their 
gift, you can ask them to complete a short survey, including their contact 
information.
 
Imada suggests that you can stretch your public relations dollars by offering 
a chance to win a trip for two to Hawaii or the Bahamas. He did a campaign 
at an Asian American gathering for Bank of America and AT&T in conjunction 
with an airline. To qualify for the prize, people had to complete six questions 
about their banking, long-distance telephone service, and travel purchases. 
In this one campaign, they collected more than 16,000 completed surveys, 
which became lead-generation sheets for the bank, telephone company, and 
airline. To calculate their ROI, all these companies had to do was track the 
resulting business from these leads and use the ROI formula provided in the 
earlier section “Calculating your ROI (return on investment).”
Generating positive PR
Public relations (PR) consists of obtaining publicity for yourself or your company 
for free or for very little money. You can do this by appearing at a community 
event, such as a parade, or having the media run a news story about you.
 
While “free” always sounds good, generating positive and effective PR is very 
difficult, and the results can be even harder to predict. You must have experi-
ence, timing, and skill to get the PR machine cranking out positive messages 
about you and your organization.

111
 Chapter 5: Building a Marketing Campaign with Global Appeal
If you feel you have what it takes, here are ideas on how you can start gener-
ating your own positive PR:
 
 Contact news media in your market area and let them know you’re an 
expert on whatever product or service you’re selling. Send them a packet 
complete with your business card and résumé or curriculum vitae, along 
with a cover letter about your areas of specialty, your eagerness to speak 
with the press, and the fact that you’re available at a moment’s notice.
 
 Sponsor a community initiative. If you notice a way that you can team 
up with other businesses and organizations in your area to promote 
improvements for the multicultural community, take the lead.
 
 Do the right thing. Acting with integrity and doing good deeds pays PR 
dividends. In fact, sometimes you reap more benefits when you do the 
right thing and say nothing about it, as the nearby sidebar illustrates.
 
 Issue press releases to let the media in your area know what you’re 
doing to help the communities you serve. Make sure you word it in a 
way that sounds more like news and less like an advertisement. If you 
can submit photos along with the story for the visual media, it greatly 
increases the likelihood that the media will use it.
Partnering with nonprofits
Teaming up with groups that already have established ties with a community 
you’d like to target not only stretches your advertising dollars but can increase 
your credibility and multiply the impact of your efforts. This is why it’s smart 
to consider partnering with nonprofit and governmental organizations.
Do the right thing
Perhaps the best way to understand how to 
conduct an effective public relations campaign 
is to see how it’s been done.
When I (Michael) was chairman of the board of 
a credit union in the San Francisco Bay Area, 
thieves broke into a local high school softball 
team’s locker room and stole all of its uniforms 
and equipment for the upcoming season. We 
jumped into action and allocated $5,000 from 
our marketing budget to replace everything the 
team had lost.
The coach and school principal were so appre-
ciative that they called the local media. When 
we presented them with the check, almost 
every local radio and television station, along 
with many of the area newspapers, ran the 
story. One advertising agency estimated that 
our investment netted us more than $30,000 
worth of publicity. That’s not the reason we 
donated the funds, but the publicity we received 
was certainly a pleasant, unexpected surprise. 
So always be on the lookout for opportunities to 
turn negative news into positive outcomes for 
the people in your community.

112
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
Start by contacting the chamber of commerce in your area and ask for a list 
of nonprofit organizations. Then decide which ones would make appropri-
ate and logical partners. If a partnership makes sense, find out how you can 
assist with their efforts. One way may be to cosponsor events, such as fund-
raisers or educational seminars. These can help the community and raise the 
visibility of both organizations at the same time.
Here’s a short list of high-profile nonprofit associations you may want to 
consider working with:
 
 American Cancer Society
 
 Battered women’s shelters
 
 Boy Scouts of America
 
 Boys and Girls Clubs of America
 
 Churches
 
 DARE programs
 
 Easter Seals
 
 Girl Scouts of America
 
 Local fire departments
 
 Local police departments
 
 Parent-Teacher Associations (PTA)
 
 Schools
 
 United Way
 
 Volunteers of America
It takes more than just running an ad in a newspaper
Deb McLean, vice president of marketing and 
business development at Carolina Postal Credit 
Union (www.cpcuonline.com), says you 
must meet the leaders of the community you’re 
trying to reach:
 
 “Meet the leaders, get your introductions, 
and then make your presence known. You 
cannot just run an ad in the newspaper. 
You’ve got to get out there and be seen. . . . 
We always have a booth at a festival. We’re 
always there, and we’re always promoting 
our products and talking to people, and 
saying we can help. . . .
 
 “The two most important things are to raise 
the awareness that you’re there and com-
mitted, and then do the little extra things 
like participating with the local community 
groups or programs. Do a little something 
extra, because it reinforces that you’re 
committed to the community. This is how 
you get referrals.”

113
 Chapter 5: Building a Marketing Campaign with Global Appeal
 
Giving money and buying space in an organization’s program is great, but to 
make the most of these marketing opportunities, invest your time as well as 
your expertise.
Expanding your outreach efforts
Business owners and salespeople often ask us for ideas about how to get 
more involved in ethnic communities and demonstrate their commitment to 
these groups. They often assume that the opportunities are limited, and they 
feel (unnecessarily and quite mistakenly) that these communities are freezing 
them out. The fact is that the opportunities are almost too numerous to list. 
Here are a few:
 
 Social service organizations: Programs such as Catholic and Lutheran 
social services, Goodwill Industries, and others already provide various 
services to underserved populations. Getting involved in supporting 
English as a Second Language programs can be especially effective in 
reaching first-generation immigrants.
 
 Athletic team sponsorships: Sponsoring sports organizations with large 
numbers of ethnic players can be a good way to build relationships 
with their community and increase your visibility. Although Hispanics 
share Americans’ love for soccer and baseball, and most Japanese are 
also enamored of baseball, don’t forget that other cultures have favorite 
sports and pastimes that don’t appeal to most Americans. For example, 
people from Asian cultures value martial arts and Ping-Pong, while folks 
from India and Pakistan enjoy a good game of cricket.
 
 Law enforcement–sponsored programs: Police departments, the high-
way patrol, and other law enforcement groups may be able to assist you 
in reaching culturally diverse groups. They often have child-safety pro-
grams, drug-awareness projects, child-identification systems, and more, 
and are always in need of sponsors and volunteers.
 
 Other businesses: Travel agents, immigration attorneys, and ethnic res-
taurants that are already serving the communities you’re trying to reach 
may be looking for people just like you to provide additional products 
and services to their customers. These are often the real centers of 
influence for new immigrants.
 
To get the most out of your sponsorships and volunteer efforts, make them 
PR events. According to Howard Buford, you can increase the visibility of 
your community marketing by developing publicity around it: “Do community 
events, sponsor youth organizations and church choir groups, and then put 
PR behind it. By taking this approach, you not only reach those immediate 
audiences as a sponsor, but you let a much larger audience know you’re spon-
soring.” For more about spreading the word about activities in which you’re 
involved, see “Generating positive PR,” earlier in this chapter.

Making Yourself a Referral Magnet
Attend any marketing class at any college or university across the country, 
and you’re likely to hear the professor say something like, “The absolute 
best form of marketing is word-of-mouth advertising.” This is definitely true, 
because referrals are free and carry a great deal of weight when a friend 
or relative suggests that you buy from a specific store or salesperson. 
Concentrate your efforts first on developing referrals. If you still have some 
time, energy, and resources left, then advertise.
 
Multicultural customers are more likely than any other purchaser to give 
referrals — if you know how to earn the right to ask for them. It’s so important 
that Chapter 15 is devoted entirely to this topic.

Chapter 6
Developing a Comprehensive 
Program
In This Chapter
 Strategizing your team’s plan of attack
 Making cross-cultural sales a companywide goal
 Implementing your plan and assessing its success
O
verhauling your marketing programs, as we explain in Chapter 5, is an 
essential first step in attracting ethnic customers, but it’s not enough 
to persuade them to make a purchase, become a lifelong customer, and send 
referrals your way. To achieve these goals, you need to become an integral 
part of the ethnic community and demonstrate that you’re making a long-
term commitment (see Chapter 7). If you own or manage a company, you also 
need to make fundamental changes in staffing and the way you do business. If 
you’re an independent salesperson, you can do this all by yourself.
Throughout this chapter, we offer guidance about how to implement compa-
nywide changes that really make a difference. Transforming your company 
requires that you take the following three steps:
 
1. Develop a strategic sales plan that includes clearly defined goals and 
tools for assessing its success.
 
2. Encourage everyone in the company to contribute their efforts toward 
expanding the business into multicultural markets.
 
3. Implement your plan, assess its effectiveness, and make any adjust-
ments necessary.
 
Unless you own the business or are the acting CEO, you may not have the 
power to implement any of the changes we recommend in this chapter. Does 
that mean you can skip this chapter? No, but nice try. Do what you can from 
your current position to influence the direction your company takes. In addi-
tion, you can work with the owner or management to make your company 
more multicultural. If the top leaders aren’t behind you, it can hurt the com-
pany’s bottom line.

116
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
Drafting a Strategic Plan
Giving your business a multicultural makeover consists of much more than 
simply making a few cosmetic changes, which far too many organizations do. 
They may have their brochures translated into a different language, run mul-
tilingual ads, or start stocking a few ethnic products as token efforts.
As we explain in the following sections, you need to perform three essential 
steps to develop your comprehensive strategic plan:
 
1. Strategic analysis
 
2. Strategic direction setting
 
3. Action planning
After you’ve completed these steps and have a plan in place, you need to 
obtain support from both internal and external stakeholders. (We talk about 
gaining buy-in from management and staff in the later section “Getting Your 
Entire Company on Board.”) You can then implement your strategic plan, 
evaluate it, and fine tune it, as explained in the later section “Implementing 
and Evaluating Your Plan.”
 
General Dwight D. Eisenhower once said, “In preparing for battle I have always 
found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.” In other words, 
your strategy probably won’t go as planned, but the time and effort you invest 
in thinking about how to proceed makes you much more capable of imple-
menting the necessary changes and dealing with unexpected challenges.
What exactly is “cultural competency”?
In short, cultural competency is the chameleon-
like ability to “blend” with people who look, 
think, and act differently than most of the people 
you normally spend time with. Dr. Andrew Erlich 
of Erlich Transcultural Consultants (www.
etcethnic.com) in Woodland Hills, 
California, offers a more formal and precise 
definition:
 
 “Cultural competence means understand-
ing your own culture and how you react 
to others’ differences, improving your own 
intercultural communication, endeavoring 
to reduce your stereotypes, valuing diver-
sity and different perspectives, and being 
flexible and adaptable in dealing with cul-
tures other than your own.”
Erlich goes on to say that, “As most people travel 
through life, they begin to move down the road 
to understanding ethnic groups and cultures dif-
ferent from their own. How far down the road 
they travel depends on how hard they are will-
ing to work to change their own perceptions.”

117
 Chapter 6: Developing a Comprehensive Program
You are here: Strategic analysis
 
Before setting out on any journey, you need to figure out where you are cur-
rently to establish a point of reference. You have no clear idea of the changes 
you need to implement in your company until you first take stock of your 
company and the current environment in which it’s operating. To audit your 
current resources and the business environment, take the following steps:
 
1. Examine the changing demographics of your customer base.
 
 Which group or groups are increasing and which are decreasing? How 
will new demands for products and services affect your business? 
(In Chapter 2, we show you how to obtain this data through market 
research or by hiring a company to gather the data for you.)
 
2. Check out any strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats you 
face.
 
 What are your competitors doing or not doing to capitalize on the new 
consumers in your area? You may need to do your own field research 
to check out the competition. Visit competing businesses and act like a 
customer to determine what adjustments, if any, they’re making. Also 
visit ethnic stores for deeper insights. At the same time, honestly assess 
your company’s strengths and weaknesses in terms of serving the needs 
of your multicultural marketplace. Do you already have culturally liter-
ate staff in place whose expertise you can tap to further your efforts?
 
3. Look at what’s going on in your social, economic, political, and regula-
tory environment.
 
 When it comes to selling to diverse customers, your primary focus is 
usually on the social and economic data (see Chapter 2), but politi-
cal and regulatory factors can often come into play. To stay ahead of 
changes that may impact you, read the local section of your city’s news-
paper, watch the local television newscasts, and be an active member of 
your industry’s trade association.
 
During the analysis phase, involve everyone in your company. Let them know 
why you’re developing a multicultural sales strategy and ask for their input 
and support. For instance, you can ask your staff to do some field research of 
their own to identify products and services in high demand. You can also get 
them involved in surveying customers, as we recommend in Chapter 2. This 
gives them a sense of ownership and makes them more willing to implement 
the changes later. Stress the fact that the strategic plan is going to benefit 
them as well as their customers.

Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
Knowing where you’re going: Strategic 
direction setting
 
After you’ve spotted an opportunity, you’re ready to move on to stage two — 
setting your course. At this stage, you set goals for your multicultural sales 
strategy. To be truly effective, your goals should be S-M-A-R-T:
Specific: Exactly which products or services are you going to sell? Which 
multicultural groups are you going to attract? (The data you gather in 
Chapter 2 can help you answer these questions and others to make your 
goals specific.)
Measurable: How much more in products or services would you like to 
sell to your target group? Consider starting with the goal of achieving 
multicultural market share that’s at least equivalent to your current over-
all market share. For example, if your business currently accounts for 10 
percent of the market, shoot for achieving 10 percent of the multicultural 
market or more.
Attainable: Do you have the resources to market and sell to multicul-
tural customers? You not only need the money in your budget but also 
the expertise to accomplish your goals. If you don’t have the necessary 
expertise, don’t despair — you can hire them. In Chapter 2, we provide a 
list of companies that can assist with market research. In Chapter 5, we 
offer guidance on finding companies and individuals qualified to assist in 
marketing. And in Chapter 16, we encourage you to diversify your staff 
and show you ways to approach this task.
Realistic: Does everyone believe that your multicultural sales initiative is 
achievable? Have you been successful in opening up new markets in the 
past? If not, what’s different about this attempt that ensures its success? 
Only you and your team can determine what you consider realistic, given 
what you’ve accomplished together in the past.
Timely: Specifically when will you achieve your desired level of sales? A 
time frame enables you to measure your progress toward reaching your 
goals. As you develop your action plan, as we explain in the following sec-
tion, you determine just how timely your goal can be.
 
Involve everyone in your organization when it comes time to set goals. Their 
involvement at this stage should increase their support for the project. Clearly 
communicate your intent to attract customers from other cultures (and 
explain the benefits of doing so, as covered later in this chapter in the section 
“Getting Your Entire Company on Board”). Schedule a goal-setting meeting 
to get everyone’s buy-in. You can then hold separate meetings for strategic 
planning and scheduling and, depending on the size of your company, you can 
meet individually with each department to help the employees in those areas 
develop plans for meeting the department’s unique goals.

119
 Chapter 6: Developing a Comprehensive Program
 
After you’ve developed an overall vision and direction, break it up into a list of 
five to seven action items — mini-goals you need to achieve to meet or exceed 
your main goal. The action items provide everyone with a clearer idea of the 
“how” behind the “what” and “why.” The “who” and “where” can come later, 
as we outline in the following section.
Gearing up: Action planning
 
Your strategic direction serves as an outline for the changes you’ll be imple-
menting. The process for your multicultural initiative should be no different 
from the one you use to accomplish any other top business goal. Action plan-
ning gets down to the nitty-gritty — the details:
 
1. Assign a tactic or method by which you plan to achieve each goal 
specified in your strategic direction.
 
 If one of the goals for a grocery store is to sell more bok choy to Chinese 
customers, for example, one tactic may be to distribute fliers in Chinese 
at the local Chinese church. (For more about translating marketing 
materials, check out Chapter 5.)
 
2. Identify one or more people in charge of taking responsibility for the 
steps necessary to achieve the stated goal.
 
 Using the bok choy example, the marketing director may be responsible 
for getting the flier translated, having it printed, and obtaining permis-
sion to hand them out after a worship service. The produce manager 
would be responsible for estimating the additional bok choy that would 
be needed and ordering it. The clerks would be in charge of stocking the 
extra produce and getting signs printed in Chinese. Human Resources 
would make sure that at least one clerk who could speak the appropri-
ate dialect of Chinese was on staff during the sale. The sales manager 
would have the duty of making sure that the project is on track each 
step of the way.
 
3. To ensure that all tasks are carried out, set a specific deadline for the 
project and a timeline to keep everyone on track.
 
 Attach a deadline to every responsibility assigned in Step 2. For 
example, the marketing director may need to have fliers translated and 
printed and have permission to hand them out in two weeks. The pro-
duce manager may need to ensure that the additional bok choy is on 
hand on a certain date.
 
Consider creating a graphic model of your plan to make it easier for your staff 
to visualize and remember. For example, organize the main five or six points 
as a color pyramid. Then develop the action plans to support each step on 
the pyramid (the steps needed to achieve the ultimate objective, which is to 
increase sales and market share).

120
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
Getting Your Entire Company on Board
A house (or an organization) divided cannot stand. If one or more members 
of your organization are opposed or even lukewarm to the idea of pursuing 
ethnic customers, your efforts are going to be diluted, and your multicultural 
initiative is going to have less of an impact.
Everyone in your organization needs to offer their full, enthusiastic support. 
In the following sections, we offer some suggestions on how to motivate 
others to join your efforts, especially your frontline staff — the people who 
have the most contact with customers.
Adjusting your corporate culture
In just about every business, the corporate culture starts at the top and trick-
les down to the masses. If the boss is involved in fraudulent activity, you can 
bet that at least a few underlings are ripping off the company or defrauding 
customers. If the boss is committed to volunteerism and building strong com-
munities, everyone else is likely to follow that lead.
The same is true in terms of commitment to multiculturalism. It has to start 
at the highest levels of leadership. The people at the top of the corporate 
ladder must show a genuine interest in hiring and treating all workers with 
a sense of fairness and respect. They must demonstrate a commitment to 
learning about other cultures and accepting and accommodating differences 
among and between people.
 
The key to creating a diversity-friendly team or company is to create an atmo-
sphere in which people feel comfortable talking about their differences. If 
workers are willing to discuss their own differences as well as those of their 
customers and co-workers, you’ll be able to overcome your own multicultural 
challenges and answer your own diversity questions.
Identifying the potential impact of key 
departments on multicultural customers
Every department, every staff member, and everyone who’s even remotely 
associated with your organization can have a positive or negative impact on 
your sales to multicultural customers. As highlighted in the nearby sidebar, 
even subcontractors and vendors have the power to attract customers or 
drive them away.

121
 Chapter 6: Developing a Comprehensive Program
Some departments and personnel, however, have a greater potential impact 
on customers. Obviously, anyone in sales or marketing and your frontline 
staff, including receptionists and cashiers, have the most influence, but other 
departments and personnel can play an important role as well. In the follow-
ing sections, we highlight some key areas that demand the most focus.
 
Everyone in your business can benefit by reading this book. For the bare mini-
mum, have them read Chapter 4, which starts them on their way to developing 
cultural competency. Additional training may be required, depending on how 
closely and in what capacity they work with customers from other cultures. 
Later in this chapter, in the section “Offering a crash course in cultural compe-
tency,” we provide a list of topics your training program should cover.
Marketing
Although your marketing people may have little or no direct contact with 
customers, they’re in charge of painting the portrait that the ethnic commu-
nity uses to judge your company. So it’s critical for these folks to understand 
how your target customers influence your goals. Make sure your marketing 
people obtain the training they need to attain an acceptable level of cultural 
competency. Chapter 4 provides a good start, but your marketing personnel 
can gain additional expertise by checking out Chapter 5. Even with the best 
training, however, you may need to outsource your multicultural marketing 
to advertising agencies that specialize in your target customers.
 
If you do have to outsource your multicultural marketing, get your marketing 
staff’s buy-in. They must understand the need for a multicultural marketing 
initiative, recognize that they lack expertise in this area, and be willing to learn 
from experts. We can cite plenty of instances in which marketing staffs have 
sabotaged these kinds of efforts because they didn’t buy into the program 
before it was initiated.
Sales
Salespeople play perhaps the most significant role in attracting members of 
ethnic communities. They’re often the first people in an organization whom 
customers meet, which is why we include several chapters specifically on 
this topic primarily for salespeople (see Part III in particular). Because of their 
close contact with multicultural buyers, they must surmount language barriers, 
contractual idiosyncrasies, endless negotiating, and more. Obtaining training in 
cross-cultural selling, as provided in this book, is essential.

122
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
Cashiers
Cashiers are like the Rodney Dangerfields of the retail industry — they get 
no respect. Many businesses treat them merely as entry-level employees, 
and so that’s what they get — clock punchers who simply ring up orders, 
take money, swipe credit cards, and bag the goods. Managers who treat their 
cashiers with respect realize that they can be profit centers for the business. 
This is particularly true in respect to multicultural customers. As profit cen-
ters, cashiers can benefit your business in at least two ways:
 
 They can treat multicultural customers the way they want to be treated 
to keep them coming back.
 
 They can perform field research, recording the changing demographic, 
asking customers questions (such as whether the customer was able to 
find everything she was shopping for), and sharing the information with 
managers and other departments. (See Chapter 2 for more about asking 
important questions of customers.)
 
To tap the full potential of your cashiers, train them in cross-cultural relations 
and reward them for their efforts in collecting and providing you with valuable 
market data. See “Offering a crash course in cultural competency,” later in this 
chapter, for guidance in training your staff.
Even a vendor or subcontractor 
can affect your business
A new-home salesperson recently related a story 
about a cement truck driver for a large home 
builder who insulted prospective Asian buyers. 
He grew frustrated driving behind a group of 
obviously lost Asian home buyers who were look-
ing for the stake that marked the lot for their new 
home. He couldn’t pass them because they were 
weaving from side to side blocking his path.
When the buyers finally found their lot and 
pulled over, the frustrated truck driver yelled out 
the window, “Why don’t you go back to where 
you came from!” This had a negative impact on 
the shocked Asian buyers who decided they 
didn’t want to live in a community where people 
treated them like this.
Unbeknownst to them, the driver was a sub-
contractor and not an employee of the builder, 
yet his actions still affected the builder and the 
builder’s sales rep.
To avoid similar fiascos, communication is key. 
Let everyone, including your vendors, know 
about the importance of your multicultural cli-
entele. They need to understand that every-
thing they do that affects your bottom line also 
affects theirs, perhaps even more so if you 
were to choose another vendor as a result of 
any poor decisions they may make. On the other 
hand, if your vendors ask the right questions of 
their own customers, they have the potential of 
referring business to you.

123
 Chapter 6: Developing a Comprehensive Program
Receptionists
 
Receptionists in service organizations can be vital to closing sales to multi-
cultural customers. From the first meeting forward, customers judge your 
organization by how well it treats people. In the office of a doctor, accountant, 
attorney, travel agent, or other service provider, the first person “treating 
people” is the receptionist.
Provide your receptionist with the training required to achieve cultural com-
petency. If your receptionist can speak a few words in the language of the 
customers you’re trying to attract, this is an added bonus. If she’s fluent, so 
much the better.
Customer service
As a customer, how often have you dealt with a company’s customer service 
personnel and decided to never buy anything from that company again based 
on your negative experience? If you’re like most people, you’ve probably had 
more than one such encounter. You may have bought the best product from 
the best company and loved the salesperson, but one bad experience with 
customer service eclipsed all of your previous good feelings for the company. 
That’s how important customer service is, so provide these frontline employ-
ees with the necessary training, as explained later in this chapter, in the sec-
tion “Offering a crash course in cultural competency.”
 
One factor that can wield a strong influence over your customer service 
department’s attitude toward multicultural customers is the type of feedback 
it receives from these customers. Not all cultures have the same outlook when 
it comes to commenting on experiences with service providers. For example:
 
 Many Asians are reluctant to give a score of ten on a ten-point scale on 
satisfaction surveys because, as a collectivist culture, they may not want 
to embarrass you by making you stand out from your group. They may 
rate you only a five or six while providing a glowing review. If you want 
top scores from these folks, let them know from the start that it’s impor-
tant you receive the score you deserve and that you’ll lose face with 
your boss if you don’t. You may even joke that you “won’t be embar-
rassed” by a high score if you’ve earned it. If you want to know why this 
is necessary, turn to Chapter 14.
 
 People from some cultures, such as Hispanics, tend to be reluctant 
about expressing their complaints to customer service. Instead, they 
simply stop buying from you and tell their friends and family to avoid 
your business. Customer service personnel must be encouraged to be 
proactive in asking for honest feedback by asking open-ended ques-
tions. They should also report any unresolved issues to management for 
follow-up.
Flip to Chapter 14 for more information on tweaking your employees’ 
customer service skills.

124
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
Service/repair
Service people can have a dramatic impact on customer satisfaction as well 
as referrals that the company may receive. How they handle repairs is cru-
cial. Probably the most important aspect of satisfactory service is educating 
the customer about not only the issue at hand, but also about preventive 
maintenance that can save time and money in the future.
 
Many ethnic customers feel guilty that they aren’t able to spend enough qual-
ity time with their families. Their jobs may require them to work six or seven 
days a week for ten or more hours a day. They greatly appreciate when you 
take the time to show them how to do simple maintenance themselves to save 
time and money in the long run.
Information technology
 
IT guys and gals are known for keeping a low profile, so they’re unlikely to 
cross paths with any of your customers (ethnic or otherwise). They can, how-
ever, certainly assist you in improving customer service; for example, you may 
want to track point-of-sale (POS) information a bit differently when you start a 
multicultural sales program. This requires the support and input of your infor-
mation technology (IT) staff.
Finance
Customers from other cultures may have a completely different attitude 
toward financing than your longtime American customers; they may avoid it 
altogether. This is certainly not a problem if your customers insist on paying 
cash and have sufficient means to do so. However, if you’re selling big-ticket 
items, your financing department may play a key role in making those goods 
affordable. To accomplish this, they need to master cultural competency 
skills as well.
 
If you sell big-ticket items that can be financed, carefully explain your various 
loan programs to any customer who wants to take advantage of this option. 
This is especially true of folks who don’t speak fluent English or may not be 
familiar with American financing rules and practices. Getting a loan for the 
first time can be an intimidating and frightening experience.
Manufacturing
Delivering products on time is crucial to building trust, especially with multi-
cultural customers who may be more suspicious of you than your traditional 
clientele. To build a reputation as a reliable supplier, underpromise, overde-
liver, and make sure that manufacturing follows the same approach.
Manufacturing personnel rarely interact directly with the customer, yet 
they can have just as profound an impact on multicultural sales as frontline 
staff. They must be aware of schedules and what the sales staff promised. 
Manufacturing may need to be reminded of the importance of reporting any 
inability to meet a promised deadline to sales as soon as possible.

125
 Chapter 6: Developing a Comprehensive Program
Research and development
Research and development (R&D) departments in large companies can assist 
in identifying new opportunities in the multicultural marketplace. These folks 
must remain on the lookout for opportunities to adapt existing products or 
develop new ones to meet the needs of this new consumer. Creative compa-
nies are discovering that ethnic groups have different tastes, skin color, hair 
types, and preferences, all of which open opportunities to sell new products 
and services. We go into detail on adapting your product or service to the 
needs of multicultural customers in Chapter 7.
Human Resources
If you received diversity training back in the ’80s or ’90s, you may be a little 
reluctant to go there again. Early forms of this training were usually deliv-
ered by the HR department and typically contained a heavy dose of guilt — 
reminding attendees of all the injustices done to ethnic groups over the past 
200 years or so.
The newer cultural competency training is much different. It’s marketing and 
sales driven and views diversity as an opportunity to serve all customers 
better. Unlike “diversity training,” cultural competency training is generally 
well received by staff members, who find it valuable in helping them interact 
more comfortably with customers on a daily basis.
 
Although your Human Resources department must be willing and eventually 
able to provide cultural competency training throughout the company, the 
staff may not be qualified quite yet to provide this training. Cultural compe-
tency is a very specialized field — trainers need to know how culture can 
affect each department and provide guidance about how to become more 
accommodating to diverse clientele. This isn’t like putting on a sales or time-
management seminar. Until your in-house trainers get up to speed, you may 
need to bring in some specialists. Here are some training companies that spe-
cialize in this area:
 
 The Diversity Training Group (www.diversitydtg.com)
 
 EthnoConnect (www.EthnoConnect.com)
 
 Novations (www.novations.com)
 
 The Partnering Group (www.thepartneringgroup.com)
Convincing others of the need to change
People don’t want to be told what they already know; for example, they don’t 
want to hear that they should, out of the kindness of their hearts, be more 
accommodating to people who speak other languages or have different cul-
tural backgrounds. Browbeating reluctant staff members only results in dam-
aging morale and putting everyone on the defensive.

126
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
 
A more effective approach is to point out the potential business benefits of 
cultural competency for your company and everyone who’s a part of it — 
increased sales and profits, enhanced job security, higher customer satisfac-
tion ratings, and the potential for higher pay, as well as bonuses and improved 
benefits.
 
Just as you must sell products and services to your customers, you must sell 
the benefits of cultural competency to your personnel. The information we 
provide in Chapter 2 can help you develop an effective sales presentation.
Dealing with resistance to change
No matter how well you sell the value of cultural competency to your team, 
you’re likely to bump heads with at least a couple of people in your orga-
nization who are going to resist your efforts. These are probably the same 
people who oppose just about anything new, like relocating the water cooler. 
People’s reasons for resisting change are usually pretty much the same:
 
 It’s too risky. They either fear what could happen if they change, or they 
just prefer to stick with what’s familiar.
 
 It’s not worth it. They don’t see the potential benefit. This is when you 
really have to sell the benefits of doing things differently.
 
 They don’t get it. They have no model to follow to change their behav-
ior. This is why you must implement cultural competency from the top 
down. Following someone else’s lead is easier than going it alone.
 
 They’re afraid they’ll fail. To overcome this fear, show them that the 
road to cultural competency is paved with small adjustments, not major 
changes. Achieving small but measurable victories bolsters their confi-
dence and willingness to adjust.
 
 They’re afraid their job will get harder. Again, you need to sell the ben-
efits of cultural competency and the fact that it will make working with 
all customers easier.
 
 They’re overwhelmed. Becoming culturally competent may seem like an 
unnecessary burden being piled on top of an already full plate. However, 
people can always find time for activities they feel will benefit them — 
so sell it!
It’s always best to identify resistance to change before it derails your efforts. 
Resistance may take many forms, including active or passive, overt or covert, 
individual or organized, aggressive or timid. Recognize that change can evoke 
deep and powerful feelings and that fear is often expressed as anger. Be will-
ing to have frank discussions to let people blow off a little steam and confront 
their fears. Your entire staff must embrace the change on both a rational and 
emotional level.

127
 Chapter 6: Developing a Comprehensive Program
Offering a crash course in 
cultural competency
This book is your crash course on cross-cultural sales, but as we stress in 
this chapter, you need to make everyone in your company culturally compe-
tent to maximize results and get everyone in the company on board. An effec-
tive cultural competency training program for the entire company should, at 
a minimum, cover the following topics for all departments:
 
 Development of culture: How cultures develop and their impact on the 
workplace, including relationships with customers.
 
 How cultures think and act differently: Because of our uniquely 
American background and experiences, we think and act differently from 
those outside our own culture (see Chapter 3).
 
 The cultural lens: Americans tend to look at the world through our own 
lenses and, as a result, tend to believe that what others think and do dif-
ferently from us is wrong. Everyone on staff needs to realize that differ-
ences are merely differences. (See Chapter 3.)
 
 The cross-cultural opportunity: By becoming culturally competent, staff 
members can more effectively serve customers and boost sales and 
profits. By presenting facts and figures about the multicultural market 
potential in your area (see Chapter 2), you can get staff members to buy 
into your plan to expand into this market and contribute to the com-
pany’s success.
 
 The cross-cultural challenge: People of color tend to want different 
products and services, and they establish relationships differently. By 
developing an understanding of other cultures, staff members are less 
likely to insult or disrespect customers by mistake and are more likely 
to help the company win customers for life as well as obtain plenty of 
referral business. (See Chapter 4.)
 
 Time differences (polychronic versus monochronic cultures): How 
different people view time and the importance of being on time for 
scheduled meetings and events can seriously affect relationships and 
ultimately sales:
 
• Polychronics are group oriented and future oriented, like Hispanics, 
Asians, and Middle Easterners. They tend to view deadlines as 
suggestions rather than as impenetrable barriers, so they may not 
show up for appointments on time or provide loan documents in 
a timely fashion. They often view monochronics as aggressive and 
pushy when it comes to time.
 
• Monochronics are individualistic and present focused, like 
Americans, the Swiss, and Germans. Deadlines are hard and fast. 
They tend to view polychronics as passive, disorganized, and per-
haps even unreliable and disrespectful of their time.

128
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
 
 Competitiveness versus cooperation: Some cultures, such as Americans 
and Brits, tend to be competitive, while Hispanics and Asians are coop-
erative. Cooperative cultures usually make buying decisions as a group, 
whereas competitive cultures are more likely to make decisions as 
individuals.
 
 Individualist versus collectivist: In individualistic cultures, such as 
those in the U.S. (including African Americans), Australia, and England, 
you’re expected to look after yourself and your family. These cultures 
value directness and freely speak their minds. In collectivist cultures, 
such as Asia and Latin America, people are integrated into strong, cohe-
sive groups that protect everyone in the group in exchange for unques-
tioned loyalty. These cultures value harmony and tend to avoid direct 
confrontation. (In Chapter 11, we discuss the need to adapt your sales 
presentation to people from collectivist cultures. In Chapter 16, we dis-
cuss the challenges of managing staff members who’ve been raised with 
collectivist values.)
 
 High-context versus low-context cultures: High-context cultures, includ-
ing the Japanese, Chinese, Arabs, and Greeks, rely more on context and 
subtle cues for communications. More is implied than overtly stated, 
and words are secondary to context. Low-context cultures, including 
Americans, Scandinavians, Germans, and the Swiss, tend to be more obvi-
ous in their communications. Words are explicit and are crucial to under-
standing. (See Chapter 3 for more about high- and low-context cultures.)
 
 Meeting and greeting: People don’t all meet and greet in the same way. 
Frontline personnel must know how to properly welcome customers 
into your store or office. This important ritual sets the tone for a suc-
cessful relationship between you and the client. (See Chapter 8.)
 
 Proxemics: This is the science of personal space and affects how close 
you stand to another person while conversing. Proxemics may be cul-
turally determined. Japanese people tend to stand the farthest away, 
Americans are in the middle, and Middle Easterners usually stand the 
closest. Letting customers set their own comfort zone is key to making 
them feel comfortable. (See Chapter 8.)
 
 Physical contact: People around the world differ in the amount of physi-
cal contact they make during a sales transaction. Studies show that 
people from the U.K. touch each other least often, while those in Puerto 
Rico touch each other the most. Again, staff must adjust to the level of 
physical contact that the customer sets. (See Chapter 8.)
 
 Negotiating versus nonnegotiating cultures: One of the biggest chal-
lenges that staff must be trained to overcome is the constant negotiating 
of some cultures, including Hispanics, Asians, and Middle Easterners. 
They must understand that haggling is a way of life in many parts of the 
world, and they need to be prepared to handle it. This is so important 
that we devote all of Chapter 13 to it.

129
 Chapter 6: Developing a Comprehensive Program
 
You can approach the task of training your staff in any number of ways. 
Having everyone on your team read this book, including Chapter 4 (on devel-
oping cross-cultural competency), Chapter 8 (on greeting customers), and 
Chapter 14 (on honing customer service skills) ensures a basic level of cul-
tural competency. If you have the resources, you can also develop your own 
course based on the content in this book or hire a company that specializes in 
diversity training, as explained earlier in this chapter. If you do decide to pro-
vide your own training, make sure that your staff reads the required materials 
and that they practice the exercises in Chapter 8. However, recognize that cul-
tural competency training requires specialized skills because it can bring out 
strong emotions and deep-seated prejudices. Done incorrectly, it can cause 
more damage than good. When in doubt, call a professional.
Implementing and Evaluating Your Plan
You have a plan to give your business a multicultural makeover. Everyone’s 
on board and has received at least some basic training in cultural compe-
tency. You’re now prepared to put your plan into action.
In the following sections, we offer some guidance on how to more effectively 
implement your strategic plan and monitor it to ensure its proper and com-
plete execution. We then show you how to do a postmortem to identify areas 
that could use some work.
 
To improve the potential success of your plan, have everyone involved attend 
and participate in a planning meeting. Draft the plan and obtain feedback from 
all participants. While you’re in the process of executing the plan, make sure 
everyone remains in contact with one another. Having a communication plan 
in place is a good idea; specify the preferred mode of communication (in-
person meetings, videoconferences, e-mail, phone, instant messaging), how 
often people need to touch base, the point of contacts (people ultimately 
responsible for getting everything done on time), feedback channels, and 
any other communication issues you need to address.
Showtime! Project implementation
During the implementation phase, you and your team haven’t much more 
to say. You just wait for the director to holler “Action!” and then play your 
assigned roles and hope everything proceeds as scripted.
The only real activity the manager should have to attend to at this point 
is monitoring — making sure every task has been carried out and making 
adjustments, if possible, for whatever’s not working quite right. Using the 
example introduced in the “Gearing up: Action planning” section earlier in

the chapter, did the flier get translated into Chinese or was it translated into 
Japanese by mistake? Was it printed? Was permission obtained to distribute 
them? Were they handed out? Was the extra bok choy ordered, stocked, and 
clearly marked? Did everyone meet their deadlines?
 
Your company’s owner, CEO, or other high-level executive should be respon-
sible for issuing regular reports (weekly, monthly, or quarterly) comparing 
progress and objectives. By having communication come from the very top, 
you convey the sense that this is a top priority and ensure that everyone 
involved continues to support the initiative and remains enthusiastic. The 
organization will value what management values. For more about inspiring 
enthusiastic support companywide, see “Getting Your Entire Company on 
Board,” earlier in this chapter.
Doing a postmortem: Post-project 
evaluation
As soon as the dust clears from your latest multicultural initiative, meet as 
a group and examine the results. Was this particular project a roaring suc-
cess? If not, what went wrong? Were there any surprises? What would you do 
differently next time? Was the effort worth it? Calculate the return on your 
investment, as explained in Chapter 5, in terms of both time and money.
 
Regardless of the financial success of your collective efforts, you and your 
team should celebrate the completion of every project. Just the fact that the 
team developed and accomplished goals is cause for celebration and lays the 
groundwork for future success.
 
To avoid disappointment, which can often mislead you into thinking that 
your efforts aren’t worth it, lower your expectations, at least at first. Early 
on, you’re likely to see only a modest increase in diverse customers and not 
all that much of a bump in sales. Over time, however, ethnic traffic and pur-
chases should increase considerably, as long as you stick with your efforts. 
Upon implementing a successful multicultural marketing initiative, for exam-
ple, banks and credit unions often see an increase in only low-profit, small 
savings accounts, rather than in high-profit loans or credit cards. As a result, 
many choose to abandon their efforts. What they don’t realize is that they’re 
being tested. Multicultural customers want to see how they’re treated with 
ordinary transactions before they commit to anything larger. If your company 
ends its efforts before building solid relationships, your customers will never 
trust you enough to step up their relationship with you. Bear this in mind as 
multicultural customers begin to show interest in your business.

M
ost establishments in the United States are designed with traditional 
Americans in mind — people who were born and bred in the United 
States — with little regard for new arrivals. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. 
After all, if you travel to Mexico, you’re not likely to see many stores that 
cater specifically to American tastes. In fact, you’d probably be disappointed 
if Mexico became too Americanized.
In a way, the same holds true for stores and offices in the United States. You 
probably don’t want to transform your store or office into a replica of what 
you can find in foreign lands, but you do want everyone who enters your 
establishment to feel comfortable. You want people from other cultures to 
dig the digs and be able, without too much effort, to find the products and 
services they’re looking for.
It’s a little-known fact that how your store or office is designed and decorated 
can attract or repel customers, regardless of their culture. In this chapter, we 
show you how to make a few adjustments to your place of business (and to 
your products and services) to create a more universally appealing ambience 
and product selection.
 
The devil is in the details, and so are the dollars. When you’re trying to 
become the business of choice for the ethnic market in your area, the little 
things you do add up. Whether you own the business, manage it, or are sell-
ing products and services on behalf of it, pay attention to every last detail. 

132
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
You want to make sure that each aspect of “the customer experience” gives 
you the greatest chance of making a sale, gaining a customer for life, and 
increasing your referral business. In Chapter 16, we encourage you to take 
this one step further by diversifying your sales team as well.
Retooling Your Establishment 
from the Outside In
To get a feel for how prospective customers from other cultures may feel 
when they step out of their world and into yours, take a trip to your local 
Asian or Hispanic grocery store, as suggested in Chapter 4. Does the store 
carry the products you need? Can you locate everything easily? In all likeli-
hood, the store would need to make some adjustments to encourage you to 
shop there. After you return from your trip, you’ll better understand the need 
to make some adjustments to your store or office to attract your target cus-
tomers. The question is: What adjustments do you need to make?
As you’ve probably guessed, the adjustments depend on the customers or 
clients you’re trying to attract (see Chapter 2 for details on sizing up your 
clientele). Designing a store that’s more attractive to Hispanics and easier for 
them to navigate is going to require a much different strategy than designing 
one that’s more friendly to African Americans, Asians, Middle Easterners, or 
another group.
In the following sections, we provide specific recommendations on the types 
of adjustments you need to make to your business’s exterior, interior, and 
service hours, depending on the group or groups you’re trying to attract. 
See the later section, “Adapting Packaging and Pricing for Diverse Clientele,” 
for details on changing the appearance and pricing of products and services 
themselves.
Making a great first impression
The first impression is the most important one, and it begins with marketing 
and advertising, as discussed in Chapter 5. Your storefront design, however, 
gives you that rare second opportunity to make a good first impression.
Assuming your marketing campaign is effective, it should drive consumer 
traffic to your establishment. The next step is to make your shop’s exterior 
inviting enough to draw these same people inside. In the following sections, 
we offer some practical advice on how to choose a location and create a 
storefront design that’s more effective in drawing customers from the park-
ing lot inside. We also give you tips on how to arrange your entryway and 
floor plan so those customers don’t turn around and walk right out.

133
 Chapter 7: Building Your Diversity-Friendly Place of Business
Location, location, location
If your business location is already well established, we’re not about to rec-
ommend that you uproot your place of business and relocate to where your 
target customers live, work, and shop, but if you’re just starting out or are 
looking to expand your operations, consider location carefully. Research 
your customers’ demographics, as discussed in Chapter 2, and consider 
choosing a location where you’re likely to see a lot of foot traffic from multi-
cultural customers if you need it. When choosing a location, put yourself in 
your customers’ shoes and consider the following:
 
 Convenience: Is the site on a bus line or within walking distance of your 
customers’ neighborhood? Is it easy to drive to? Does it have sufficient 
parking?
 
 Location: Is the site located near other businesses your customers 
frequent?
 
 Space: If you’re planning a new store, does the lot have sufficient space 
to build a store and expand in the future? If you’re already established in 
a store or office, does the building have enough space for you to expand 
into if your business grows?
 
 Visibility: Does your store stand out (in a good way)? Will passersby be 
drawn to it? Will people who know the address be able to spot it easily? 
Your signage may be able to help increase your visibility; see the section 
“Amending your signage” later in this chapter.
 
 Safety: Is the neighborhood safe? Are the parking lot and streets well lit 
at night?
 
If you’re having trouble choosing an ideal location, consider using specialized 
software to analyze your options. You can purchase software that uses fac-
tors such as sales, demographics, square footage, and demand to determine 
the optimum site for a store. Such software is currently available from com-
panies including Digital Geographic Research Corporation (www.Digital
Geographic.com) and Plan Magic (www.PlanMagic.com).
 
The location for an office that provides services isn’t as crucial as the site for 
a retail outlet, because you generally don’t need high foot traffic around an 
office. If you offer services that your customers want, they’ll drive a long way 
to get to your facility. Of course, a convenient location is always best, but it 
may not be as essential for an office as it is for a store.
Adjusting your window dressing
You may think people are people, but what your window dressing communi-
cates to passersby may mislead them into believing that your retail business 
caters only to an exclusive group of customers. Just think about it: Are you 
going to shop at your local discount store dressed in a suit? If you’ve decided 
to dress down for the day, are you going to feel comfortable shopping at a 
high-class clothing store where everyone’s walking around in suits?

134
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
The same is true for multicultural customers. A Hispanic, Black, or Asian 
shopper, for example, is probably not going to feel very welcome if all of your 
posters, mannequins, and womenquins look like Caucasians. In fact, studies 
show that when people of color don’t see images that look like them in an 
ad, the ad doesn’t even register in their minds. This is true of your window 
displays, as well.
 
Manufacturers today can produce mannequins and other window-dressing 
products that realistically depict all races and ethnicities, so there’s no reason 
not to have a display window that’s representative of all the customers you 
serve. Ask your vendors whether they have posters designed for customers of 
other cultures. If you use mannequins for displays, consult the company from 
which you buy or rent your mannequins to explore your options. Also check 
with your window display provider about the options they may have.
Creating a grand entrance
When multicultural customers cross the threshold into your store or office, 
you’ve just scored a great achievement, but you have no guarantee that 
they’ll stay. It’s easy to turn around and walk out. We’re fairly certain that 
you’ve done the same yourself upon entering an establishment where you 
didn’t feel welcome.
 
After your prospective customers are inside, keep them there by making them 
feel at home. Think of your entryway as the foyer of your home. You want 
your guests to feel as though they’ve entered a sanctuary — a place that will 
ultimately help them find what they need.
 
If you’re redesigning the entryway of your store, try the following to make 
shoppers feel welcome and not overwhelmed:
 
 Clearly mark the aisles. Bookstores and groceries typically mark their 
aisles to help shoppers find what they’re looking for.
 
 Add a store map. If your store is fairly large, consider placing a map at 
the entrance that shows a bird’s-eye view of where everything is located. 
Malls, large hardware stores, and retail outlets often use maps to help 
customers navigate.
 
 If you’re targeting new immigrants, make sure your signs and maps 
are bilingual. See Chapter 5 for more about translating materials into 
another language.
If you’re redesigning your office’s entrance, make sure the physical environs 
of your lobby immediately strike your customers as an inviting and comfort-
able place to do business. Spend some time considering the effect that certain 
color schemes, artwork, photos, and furnishings are going to have on someone 

135
 Chapter 7: Building Your Diversity-Friendly Place of Business
from the culture you’re trying to appeal to. If possible, seek the assistance of 
someone from your target culture in choosing your office décor. See “Adding 
diversity-friendly décor,” later in this chapter, for additional suggestions.
 
Does your office have a waiting area? If so, subscribe to some magazines that 
your new clients may find interesting. You can take a poll or just subscribe to 
a few and look at which ones get dog-eared or “borrowed” most often. Also 
make sure the reading material is in your clients’ language. This is a small ges-
ture that speaks volumes about your care and concern for them.
Redrawing your floor plan
Have you ever stepped into the grocery store that you’ve shopped at every 
week for the past ten years only to find that everything has been rearranged? 
You probably felt confused and betrayed by the very people you’ve been 
handing your money to all these years. Here you are, ready, able, and will-
ing to buy stuff, and you can’t find anything you want! You’ve fallen victim to 
some cruel and unusual shell game.
Customers and clients from other cultures can feel the same way if they walk 
into your store only to discover that nothing is where they think it should be 
or that your office is arranged in such a way as to bring everyone in it bad luck.
Sometimes, especially with stores, your customers simply need some time to 
get acclimated. A grocer can’t inconvenience other shoppers by moving the 
dairy section to the other end of the store, for example, just to make a certain 
group of customers more comfortable. Marking the aisles and including a 
map of the store, as discussed in the preceding section, is usually sufficient.
 
An effective floor plan should directly expose customers to new merchandise 
and draw them to promotional end caps. It should also feel open and inviting 
while maximizing sales per square foot. When it doesn’t accomplish these 
goals, it’s a good sign that you need to revisit your floor plan and make some 
adjustments. Do some of your own field research to obtain ideas for modifying 
your floor plan. You can also benefit from retail space-planning software, such 
as Smart Draw (www.SmartDraw.com), or by seeking the assistance of a con-
sulting firm. Display fixture manufacturers may also provide free floor plans 
for arranging their products.
 
In an office, however, you can make clients feel downright uncomfortable with 
the furniture arrangement, particularly in the waiting room. To overcome 
some of these problems and make everyone feel happier and more energetic, 
many businesses are embracing feng shui (a philosophy and methodology for 
arranging items in a given space to increase harmony with the universe), as 
explained in the nearby “Feng what?” sidebar.

136
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
Adding diversity-friendly décor
If you retool the exterior and entryway of your establishment but don’t make 
any corresponding adjustments inside, your customers are likely to experi-
ence a disconnect when they walk through your front door for the first time. 
Feng what?
Feng shui is the ancient Chinese practice of 
arranging objects to maximize positive energy 
flow (chi) and achieve harmony with the envi-
ronment. Literally meaning “wind and water,” 
feng shui is widely practiced in the United 
States by Asians as well as non-Asians. This 
ancient art is based on placing objects in a 
room in such a way as to promote health, 
harmony, and prosperity. To understand feng 
shui and energy flow, you must understand the 
following two basic rules:
  Good luck travels in curved lines.
  Bad luck travels in straight lines.
In feng shui, a red, eight-sided device called a 
bagua is used to determine optimal placement 
of furniture and other objects in a room. Red is 
the lucky color for Chinese people, and 8 is the 
lucky number for Chinese and other Asians. A 
feng shui master uses the bagua as a map to 
determine how energy moves inside your office 
or store, and usually adheres to the following 
tenets of feng shui:
  Clutter blocks the free flow of energy in 
a room, so keep the décor simple and 
organized.
  Because clutter blocks the positive flow of 
energy, open up your floor plans.
  Bright lighting, open spaces, and light 
colors all create positive energy.
  Because bad luck travels in straight lines, 
avoid furniture, display cases, or desks with 
sharp corners.
  Avoid long, straight corridors — again, 
straight lines = bad luck.
Builders sometimes design their floor plans in 
accordance with the principles of feng shui. 
They often make sure that the stairs don’t lead 
directly to the front door so the good luck won’t 
escape every time you open it, and they avoid 
a straight sightline from the front door to the 
back, which would create negative energy.
Even businesses that we consider distinctly 
American are embracing the principles and 
practices of feng shui. According to the 
Associated Press, a McDonald’s in Hacienda 
Heights, California, is using feng shui to create 
positive energy flow for customers by replac-
ing plastic chairs with leather, bringing in live 
bamboo plants, and installing glass panels 
where water trickles down. According to the 
owner, the purpose of the décor change is 
to create a soothing setting that encourages 
diners to come back.
If you’re interested in maximizing the energy 
flow in your store or office contact a local feng 
shui master who can do a reading on your 
store or office and suggest the most favorable 
layout. You can often find these practitioners in 
your local telephone book, on the Internet, or 
through martial arts stores and Chinese herbal-
ists. For a complete guide to the art of feng shui, 
check out Feng Shui For Dummies by David 
Daniel Kennedy and Lin Yun and Feng Shui Your 
Workspace For Dummies by Holly Ziegler and 
Jennifer Lawler (both books are published by 
Wiley).

 Chapter 7: Building Your Diversity-Friendly Place of Business
To establish a smooth transition from the parking lot into your store or office 
lobby, some adjustments to the interior décor may be in order. In the follow-
ing sections, we offer some guidance.
 
Large retail stores around the world look very similar due to layout and visibil-
ity restrictions. Your walls are probably already covered with merchandise, 
making it more difficult to add diversity-friendly décor. In most cases, you’re 
limited to adjusting the signage, product displays, and the products them-
selves (we discuss these topics later in this chapter). With a bit of creativity, 
however, you can always find a way to add a touch of cultural flair.
Checking out your wall hangings
Walk the perimeter of your store or office and take note of what’s hanging on the 
walls. Are your walls packed with photos of yourself and your family, advertising 
images of Caucasians, your college diplomas and other certifications, religious 
icons, or racy calendar girls? You may be so accustomed to these displays that 
you don’t even realize that some people may find them offensive.
 
Invite a few people you know from the culture you want to appeal to into 
your store or office and ask them for a second opinion. If you have some-
one on staff or a loyal customer with the cultural background of your target 
clientele, ask the person for feedback. If you’ve established a multicultural 
advisory board, as discussed in Chapter 2, ask members for their input. Then 
replace any wall hangings that could drive customers away with something 
more attractive. Here are some suggestions:
 
 Be inclusive without being obvious. The pictures in your store or office 
shouldn’t pander to customers from other cultures, but they should 
reflect the type of customer you’d like to serve. Many cultures, for exam-
ple, value family, so photos showing you with family and friends or with 
other happy customers in the community may be more appealing than 
photos of yourself accepting awards.
 
 If you’re trying to attract new immigrants, make sure that any posters 
you hang on your walls are in their native language.
 
 Many of your distributors probably already have bilingual or foreign lan-
guage posters that speak directly to the multicultural customers you’re 
trying to attract, but they may not think to offer the materials to you. 
You have to ask.
 
 If you’re redesigning your office, work with a designer who’s sensitive to 
multicultural tastes, especially those of the customers you’re trying to 
serve. The right designer can suggest paintings, curios, and other knick-
knacks that have a subtle cultural flavor.
 
 Although decorating your walls with college diplomas and other certifica-
tions is always a good way to show that you’re qualified to serve your 
clients, consider adding some photos of your family and friends. Although 
education is important to many groups, family is often more significant to 
them and says more about your character than the school you attended.

138
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
Coloring yourself multicultural
Whether you’re redesigning your window displays or giving your entire store 
or office a makeover, remain sensitive to how people from different cultures 
interpret various colors. Colors that Americans associate with celebrations 
may represent somber occasions in other cultures.
 
In the United States, for example, white symbolizes purity and a fresh begin-
ning; brides get married in white dresses. In much of Asia, however, white 
symbolizes death; instead of getting married in white, you get buried in it. 
Unless you’re in the business of selling caskets, decorating your store or office 
with bouquets of white chrysanthemums may be a big mistake.
Here’s another example: In Mexico, purple is the color of death, so if you’re 
trying to appeal to Hispanic clients, you probably want to steer clear of the 
local florists’ lavender collection. Likewise, you may want to avoid using too 
much purple in your office decor if you’re trying to attract Japanese custom-
ers; purple is generally reserved for members of the royal family. Consult 
a culturally competent decorator about appropriate colors to use for your 
customers.
To find out more about using the right colors in your decorating scheme, 
check out Chapter 5.
Accounting for cultural numerology
Certain numbers carry a special significance in various cultures. In the United 
States, for example, many buildings skip the 13th floor, while lotteries around 
the country offer “Lucky Seven” lottery tickets. For many Asians, the number 
4 represents death, while 8 is their “lucky seven.” Remember that the 2008 
Olympics in Beijing, China, began at 8 p.m. on the eighth day of the eighth 
month, August.
Whether you’re stocking your store with products, setting prices, or arrang-
ing tables in a dining area, do the math to find out whether it adds up to trou-
ble. If you’re trying to appeal to Asians who think the number 4 is unlucky, 
for example, don’t pack products in sets of four, include the number 4 in the 
price, or even sell golf balls in packages of four. Consult your advisory board 
or others from the culture whose business you’re pursuing to identify any 
numerological superstitions.
A manager of a fast-food restaurant was trying to appeal to Asians, and she 
nearly made the mistake of installing 44 seats in the dining area, until she 
realized that the number 4 is as unlucky for Asians as the number 13 is for 
Americans. To avoid “double death,” she found room to add an extra seat to 
bring the restaurant’s total to 45.
For more about lucky and unlucky numbers in other cultures, see Chapter 5.

139
 Chapter 7: Building Your Diversity-Friendly Place of Business
Amending your signage
Signage is a fancy word that refers to all the signs you use in and around your 
business to communicate with customers. (Signage goes beyond décor in that 
it provides potentially valuable information to customers.) To ensure that your 
signs are communicating the right messages effectively, consider the following 
suggestions:
 
 Form a focus group of target customers to walk around and through 
your store or office and evaluate your signage. Make sure signs are vis-
ible, attractive, in the preferred language of the customers you want to 
attract, and are free of anything (including numbers or colors) that your 
target customers may find offensive. Even a clock with a logo behind it 
may turn customers away because of its association with death for many 
Asians.
 
 Don’t forget to include directional signs from your parking lot or garage 
to your establishment and directions within your place of business to 
restrooms, smoking and nonsmoking areas, customer service stations, 
exits, and safety zones.
 
 Place multilingual signs, as well as maps, in high traffic areas in the 
target language. (Make sure the signs are in the correct language for 
the customers you serve — for example, the Spanish spoken in Spain is 
quite a bit different from the Spanish spoken in Mexico.)
 
To reduce the cost of adding multilingual signage, place separate signs below 
your existing signs instead of having your old signs redone.
Adjusting the height of shelves
In the old days, items were shelved so they were convenient for shoppers. 
Nowadays, retailers shelve items to boost sales and profits. One of their 
strategies is to place the items they want to sell the most at the customer’s 
eye level. Multicultural customers complicate this strategy in two ways:
 
 What’s at eye level for the average American may not be at eye level for 
Hispanic, Black, or Asian shoppers.
 
 The products that average Americans are likely to buy may not be 
popular with customers from other cultures.
 
The most effective way to overcome these challenges is to make slight adjust-
ments to accommodate the “average” shopper. Raising or lowering the 
shelves by a few inches can make a big impact. Moving a few items that are 
popular with your multicultural customers from the bottom shelves up one or 
two shelves can also make a difference.

140
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
Establishing a dress code for employees
Have you ever wandered around an entire store without running into one 
staff person who could help you? A salesclerk may have been right in front of 
you, but the person was dressed in such nondescript attire that you had no 
way of distinguishing her from the patrons. Imagine how confusing this must 
be for people from outside the United States.
As a service to your customers, have your frontline employees and others with 
whom customers are likely to interact wear similar clothing so they can be 
readily identifiable as staff. The clothing need not be an obvious uniform — just 
something that helps customers spot the people who can assist them without 
guessing. Having everyone wear tan pants and a white shirt or simply a shirt 
with a logo and nametag may be sufficient.
It’s amazing how many times I (Michael) have been mistaken for an employee 
in an office supply or electronics store simply because I’m more professionally 
dressed than the employees (or perhaps customers just expect an Asian to be 
high tech). Sometimes I’ll just go along with the gag and help the customer to 
see how long I can maintain the charade. I also love to see the look on the per-
son’s face when he sees me in the checkout line right in front of him.
 
When you’re a service provider (not a retailer), you’re the product, and how 
you dress is the packaging. Wear clothing that’s appropriate to the customers 
you’re serving. In some cases, a polo shirt and khaki pants are appropriate, 
whereas in other situations, a suit may be required. Studies show that if you 
dress just a bit more formally than your customers, you convey credibility and 
authority. Just don’t overdo it.
Setting culturally friendly 
hours of operation
If you’ve been knocking yourself out to build a multicultural marketing cam-
paign and give your establishment a major makeover but still aren’t seeing 
multicultural customers streaming through your doors, perhaps it’s because 
your business is open only when these customers are at work.
 
New immigrants to America may work different hours than longtime citizens. If 
you want their business, you’d better be open when they have time to do busi-
ness. The old banker’s hours of Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
have gone the way of the horse and buggy, especially if you want to do business 
with people who generally work from early morning to late into the evening. 
Find out what hours your customers work and keep your store open during the 
hours that they’re available to shop. (You can gather this information through 

141
 Chapter 7: Building Your Diversity-Friendly Place of Business
your own observations or by including a question on a survey, as explained in 
Chapter 2.) Many businesses that cater to ethnic populations are now open on 
Saturdays and even Sundays.
 
If your products and services can be obtained outside of normal retail hours 
over the Internet, let customers know. Many are Internet savvy and often 
prefer to shop electronically from the comfort of their own homes after 
normal business hours.
Adapting Packaging and Pricing 
for Diverse Clientele
Retailers, including mom-and-pop operations and folks who list items for 
sale online, are tuned in to the sensibilities of the American consumer. They 
know how to package items and bundle products in ways to make them most 
attractive to the masses and how to set price points that are not only com-
petitive but also convey a sense of value.
Unfortunately, the same packaging and pricing models and methodologies 
don’t always have the same effect on customers from other cultures, so you 
probably need to make some adjustments. In the following sections, we pro-
vide the guidance you need.
Repackaging your goods
In the United States, packaging is almost as important (and costly) as the 
product itself, because manufacturers and retailers are well aware of the 
need to make a good first impression.
Packaging products so they’re attractive to you or your traditional custom-
ers, however, isn’t necessarily going to make them attractive to shoppers 
from other cultures. In fact, what you consider attractive, they may consider 
repulsive. In the following sections, we offer some guidance on how to pack-
age goods for various cultures. We start with color, the most important ele-
ment, followed by shape, graphics, numbers, and (finally) words.
Unfortunately, the manufacturer or supplier usually has more control (in 
many cases full control) over packaging. Contact your suppliers and ask 
whether they have different packaging options for different markets (some 
do). You may also have some control over packaging if you buy in bulk and 
package items yourself. As a last resort, you can explore obtaining your prod-
ucts from more culturally sensitive sources or import them from the country 
of origin of your customers.

142
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
 
If you’re importing products from your customers’ home country (as we 
describe later in this chapter), the packaging is very likely to follow all the 
rules we describe in the following sections, in addition to being labeled in the 
customers’ native tongue. The only adjustment you may need to make is to 
add an English translation if you’re trying to sell the product to native English 
speakers, too. (Refer to Chapter 5 for more about translations.)
Coordinating colors with cultures
Picking the right colors is a key first step in wrapping your products in the 
right packaging, because color grabs the shopper’s attention. Because we 
cover the general importance of color earlier in this chapter in the section 
“Coloring yourself multicultural,” here we provide you with a quick reference 
guide to the significance of colors for different cultures (see Table 7-1).

* Japanese customers may perceive red negatively, because in their home country red is used

because it’s associated with death.
Reshaping your containers
Although the color of your packaging is most important, shape runs a close 
second. Should you put your product in a cardboard package, a bottle, tube, 
or can? Of course, what you’re selling heavily influences the package you 
choose, so you have to find out, through market research, how certain prod-
ucts you sell are typically packaged in other countries.

 Chapter 7: Building Your Diversity-Friendly Place of Business
 
If you’re a retailer, packaging will also influence the very products you order. 
Find out from existing customers what kind of packaging they’re used to in 
their home country. When ordering toothpaste, for example, do your custom-
ers prefer it in tubes or pumps?
Being careful with pictures
 
Packaging often includes images, because we all know that “A picture is worth 
a thousand words.” But the message communicated by a picture on a package 
may be offensive to certain members of a particular culture. Here are some 
recommendations for using images and other graphics wisely if you’re design-
ing your own packaging or for ordering goods appropriately:
 
 Avoid images of scantily clad women. Yes, even on bikini packages. 
Showing models in skimpy outfits can be extremely offensive to some 
cultures such as those from the Middle East.
 
 Use fewer words when trying to appeal to high-context cultures. High-
context cultures rely more on imagery and symbols rather than words. 
Work with a graphic designer who knows how to design packaging for 
your target group. She should be familiar with the difference between 
high-context and low-context advertising as well as other cultural 
nuances. (For more about high- and low-context cultures, visit Chapter 3.)
 
 Avoid certain hot-button images and select positive images instead. As 
discussed in Chapter 5, some images that Americans don’t think twice 
about have a powerfully negative association in other cultures. Clocks 
and watches, for example, generally symbolize death throughout most 
of Asia. To many Japanese, doves symbolize death (not world peace). 
Although dogs are a popular pet in the United States, Muslims believe 
they’re unclean, so including an image of a dog on food packaging would 
probably be a bad idea — unless, of course, you’re selling dog food. 
When you choose images that your customers feel favorably toward, 
you silently reinforce your commitment to their culture.
 
• Southeast Asian Indians like to see mango leaf designs, conch 
shells, peacocks, and the lotus flower, which are positive sym-
bols. The half moon with stars, however, is specific to the Muslim 
religion and wouldn’t be viewed favorably by Hindus. Many Asian 
Indians also believe owls and cats to be unlucky.
 
• For Asians, pictures of tigers, dragons, bamboo, fish, and flowers 
are viewed positively, while snakes are generally avoided.
 
• For Native Americans, the moon, the sun, eagles, horses, and 
buffaloes are very positive, while you should avoid pictures of 
tomahawks, arrows, and feather headdresses, which tend to 
stereotype members of this group.

144
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
 
• African Americans are often drawn to religious Christian images 
such as crosses, church steeples, and African ceremonial masks, 
as well as pictures of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other famous 
black leaders. Avoid anything having to do with the Civil War and 
pictures of Confederate flags and plantations.
 
 Promote family values. Many high-context cultures value family even 
more than people in the United States do, so images of family are usually 
a plus, particularly if the images include people from the culture you’re 
trying to appeal to.
 
 Avoid stereotypes. When including images of people from other cul-
tures, avoid stereotypes. For instance, while using pictures of Mexican 
Americans when targeting that group is good, showing them wearing 
serapes or sombreros and taking a siesta beneath a tree is bad.
Keeping numbers in mind
Who would think that a baker’s dozen (13 rather than 12) would be popular in the 
United States, where high-rises often skip the 13th floor to avoid bad luck? Well, 
we guess nobody’s going to complain when they’re getting an extra doughnut.
However, items packaged in certain taboo numbers may turn away some of 
your multicultural shoppers, so you may want to avoid packaging items in 
groups of four for Asian customers or three for Filipinos. (We discuss cultural 
numerology in more detail earlier in this chapter.)
If you do happen to get a shipment of products in that are packaged in a 
taboo quantity, consider repackaging them for your multicultural clientele 
and ordering a little more carefully in the future.
Labeling your packages in the right language
When selling products to customers who speak a different native language, 
consider making your packaging bilingual. You can place a label in the other 
language right next to English label or on the sides of packages so it’s readily 
visible to the customer.
 
Have the translation done by someone who’s familiar not only with the language 
but also with the culture and the product. You may also need to convert weights 
and measures, dates, and times; legal text; safety warnings; nutritional facts; and 
regulatory wording into your target audience’s language. If you import products, 
remember to translate the label into English for customers who prefer English.

Fine-tuning your prices
If you normally have a standard markup on products or services, you may want 
to fine-tune your prices to create a more effective pricing strategy and avoid any 
numbers in your prices that send the wrong message. In the following sections, 
we guide you on developing a pricing strategy to maximize sales and profits 
and suggest ways to adjust your price points so you don’t drive multicultural 
customers away.
Exploring pricing strategies
Head out on the Web to any of the comparison shopping sites, like Froogle, 
BizRate, or MySimon, and search for one or two products that tickle your 
fancy. You’ll find retailers offering identical products for vastly different 
prices. Why? Because strategic pricing is key to earning a profit in retail. 
Following is a list of common pricing strategies:
 
 High or premium pricing: Set the price extremely high, and shoppers 
think that they’re getting the best, most exclusive, or most unique item 
on the market. You can use this approach when you have a substantial 
competitive advantage such as a well-known brand name, superior ser-
vice, or product that is scarce and in high demand.
 
 Medium or general pricing: Charge the going rate and offer superior 
service, and your customers are going to believe that you offer a bigger 
bang for their buck.
 
 Low or discount pricing: Undercut the competition by offering a lower 
price on a consistent basis. Competing with a low price alone is usually 
a loser’s strategy, unless you’re a huge discount retailer. We won’t men-
tion any names.
 
 Loss-leader pricing: Price something below cost to get shoppers into 
your store so you have an opportunity to up-sell products with bigger 
markups. Auto supply stores often offer motor oil as a loss leader, for 
example, because after they get you inside they can up-sell the oil filter, 
fuel injector cleaner, air filter, windshield wipers, and perhaps even their 
oil change service.
 
Every retailer knows that competing on price alone is usually a loser’s game, 
so use your pricing strategy as only one component of a comprehensive plan 
to appeal to your multicultural clientele:
 
 Set a price that’s acceptable to multicultural customers. Although your 
price sells your product or service, the value you add provides your profit 
margin through increased and repeat business. Value add can be anything 
from bilingual salespeople to superior customer service after the sale.

146
Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
 
 Implement changes, such as those recommended throughout this chap-
ter, that make these customers feel more comfortable shopping with 
you than with your competitors who haven’t made these adjustments. 
Building a diverse sales team, as suggested in Chapter 16, can also help.
 
 Offer the products and services that your target group(s) want and need 
(we focus on these in-demand items later in this chapter).
 
Research not only the ethnic background of your target consumers, but also 
their socioeconomic backgrounds. Many upscale customers don’t want to see 
inexpensive products on the shelf because that can imply lower quality. On 
the other hand, working-class customers may not feel comfortable in a store 
that offers only designer products. Whatever strategy you choose, remain con-
sistent; if you want to be known for offering high-end products at a premium 
price, don’t start offering a group of inexpensive products, or vice versa.
Tweaking your price points
After you have one or more pricing strategies in place, revisit the actual 
prices you’re charging for individual products and services. You may need to 
make a few minor adjustments to overcome the following:
 
 Psychological price barriers: Based on their income, certain customers 
won’t pay more than a certain amount for specific products or services. 
A price of $10 may seem unaffordable, while $9.99 sounds just fine. You 
can increase your sales by staying under psychological price points. 
For example, back in the 1970s home prices in San Francisco hovered 
in the $95,000 to $99,000 range for a long time because no one wanted 
to break the $100,000 psychological barrier. As soon as one house sold 
for $100,750, almost all homes in the area started selling for more than 
$100,000. Now, you can’t even buy a garage in San Francisco for less 
than $100,000.
 
 Superstitions: Keep those no-no numbers in mind. Because Asian cus-
tomers may interpret a price of $4.44 as an ill omen or a gesture of insen-
sitivity, you may want to reset the price to $4.88 to overcome the bad 
luck with a couple of lucky eights. (We explain cultural numerology in 
more detail earlier in this chapter.)
 
 Ask your customers about good luck and bad luck numbers they may 
have. Then try to adjust your prices up or down accordingly.
 
Test different products at different prices to see where your customers’ bar-
riers are. Don’t assume that the lowest price will result in the highest sales 
volume. For many people, styling, choice, customer service, and other factors 
can be more important than price when deciding what (and where) to buy.

147
 Chapter 7: Building Your Diversity-Friendly Place of Business
Offering In-Demand Ethnic 
Products and Services
Serving a hot dog on fine china doesn’t magically transform it into filet mignon. 
And redesigning your establishment, signage, pricing, and packaging; setting 
more convenient hours; and making a host of other changes won’t attract cus-
tomers if you continue to sell stuff they have no intention of buying.
 
Perform market research, as recommended in Chapter 2, to identify products 
and services multicultural customers want and need, and then stock up so you 
can supply them with the selection they’re looking for. You may also gather 
important insights by visiting ethnic stores, as recommended in Chapter 4.
You can often attract customers from other cultures and boost sales by offer-
ing them everything they can get from your competitors, and then some, 
all in one convenient location, so they don’t have to run around so much. 
If you’re in real estate, for example, you may want to work with a mortgage 
broker and title insurance company to give house hunters a one-stop shop 
for financing, buying, and securing title to their home. Increasing the product 
selection in a retail store can have the same positive effect.
 
Carry authentic products whenever possible, and import them if necessary. 
Ask your customers specifically which products and brands they’d like you 
to stock. All you have to do is ask; don’t assume. Be sure to ask about any 
dietary restrictions your customers may have as well. For example, even 
trace amounts of alcohol can be offensive to devout Muslims. In England, a 
major manufacturer of potato chips faced a boycott over this issue. If you 
don’t already know of suppliers that carry the products you’re looking for, 
search the Web. You can search for “supplier” followed by the brand name, or 
search for the name of the product followed by the culture, such as “Mexican,” 
“Indian,” or “Chinese.”
If your initial product line for your multicultural clientele is successful, talk to 
customers about what else they would buy that they can’t get locally. Most 
customers can tell you the brand names of the products they used to buy 
in their home countries. An online search of that name will likely reveal the 
nearest distributor. Adding these items can help you expand your product 
line and gain additional market share.
 
Always keep mainstream customers in mind. Don’t crowd out the items that 
they favor with too many ethnic products. You could start to lose both sets of 
customers because ethnic customers also need mainstream products.

Part II: Multicultural Marketing and Beyond 
Implementing a Supplier 
Diversity Program
If you sell cars for a living, are you going to buy your insurance from an agent 
who purchases cars from you or from an agent who buys her cars from your 
competitor? Of course you’re going to lean toward buying your insurance 
from someone who buys one of your cars.
The same is true of multicultural customers. If they’re buying products or 
services from you, they’re going to appreciate when you purchase from 
them — when you eat at their restaurants, buy products that you need and 
they manufacture or distribute, and use the services they sell. That’s good 
business for everyone in the community. So when you’re in the market for 
goods and services (for yourself or your company), cast a wide net to locate 
suppliers and consider buying from the people who buy from you. Any sup-
port you offer your local community is always appreciated, and word usually 
spreads quickly.
 
Many companies and organizations (including colleges and universities) have 
formal supplier-diversity programs in place to encourage the use of previ-
ously underutilized minorities and women vendors. Organizations usually set 
a target goal of purchasing around 20 to 25 percent of products and services 
from underrepresented groups. Should your business be any different?

ard sell is out. Soft sell is in. Every salesperson 
knows that you can’t sell anything until you know 
what the customer wants and needs. That means asking 
lots of good questions and establishing a relationship 
before you start pitching your products or services.
You’re probably very skilled and experienced with soft 
selling to customers from your own culture, but selling to 
people from different backgrounds can be entirely differ-
ent. What works for most customers may drive these 
other customers away.
In this part, we reveal the do’s and don’ts of cross-cultural 
selling, making you more sensitive to what works and 
what doesn’t when you’re selling to people from other cul-
tural backgrounds. Here you discover effective ways to 
meet and greet customers, build mutual trust and respect, 
tune in to signals that indicate a readiness to buy, adjust 
your sales presentation, close the sale, and then haggle (if 
necessary) over the price and terms of the transaction.

A
s the old saying goes, “You never get a second chance to make a good 
first impression.” That pretty much applies to every culture on the 
planet, but every culture has a different idea about how to create a positive 
first impression. Some cultures demand direct eye contact, while others 
find that quite discomforting. Some prefer to greet with a firm handshake, 
whereas others would prefer a mutual bow or a kiss on the cheek. Some are 
notorious “close talkers,” while people in the United States tend to back off.
This chapter can make you more aware of cultural differences in meeting and 
greeting, and shows you how to treat people the way they want to be treated 
without having to become clairvoyant.
 
Go with the flow. Don’t insist on being the lead dancer. Let your customer take 
the lead and do what’s comfortable for her, and then you can follow along. If 
you keep this in mind, you can never go wrong.
The Do’s and Don’ts of Greeting and 
Interpreting Body Language
A successful relationship with multicultural customers begins with properly 
greeting them. Unfortunately, many salespeople unintentionally offend the 
very customers they’re trying to please when first greeting them.
In the following sections, we present 11 essential cross-cultural do’s and 
don’ts that can steer you clear of trouble and significantly improve the first 
impression you make with customers or prospective customers from other 
cultures. These do’s and don’ts serve three purposes:

152
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
 They increase your sensitivity to how people of other cultures prefer to 
be greeted.
 
 They assist you in interpreting the body language of people from other 
cultures so you don’t take a gesture the wrong way.
 
 They make your greeting and interaction more natural. Each do and 
don’t is accompanied by an exercise you can practice until you’re 
comfortable with the technique.
Don’t assume you know how your 
customer wants to be greeted
Most people, regardless of cultural background, assume that everyone in the 
world wants to be greeted the same way, and in America, that usually means 
the firm handshake. Of course, that’s a risky assumption to make, given the 
fact that the most common greeting in the world is the bow, not the hand-
shake. In fact, many people around the world find the handshake downright 
offensive.
 
So what should you do? The best rule to follow is that if you don’t know what 
to do, do nothing. Never assume that you know how the person you’re meet-
ing wants to be greeted.
In the following sections, we explain how to read your customer’s signals, 
prepare yourself for unexpected greetings, and break yourself of the firm 
handshake habit.
Picking up on your customer’s signals
 
The safest course of action is to let the customer determine the greeting he’s 
most comfortable with. When you meet someone from another culture, take 
the following approach:
 
1. Greet the person verbally. (This is always a safe move.)
 
2. Hesitate a moment before extending your hand, while observing what 
the other person does.
 
3. Follow the person’s lead. If he extends his hand to shake hands, shake 
hands. If he bows, bow. If he nods, nod. If he hugs you or tries to kiss 
you on both cheeks, go with the flow.
 
If the pause becomes too uncomfortable, then greet the person as you nor-
mally greet people — the person may want to do what’s proper in your coun-
try. Most multicultural men in the United States will extend a hand. Asians 
may nod as they shake hands. Simply follow the person’s lead.

153
 Chapter 8: Mastering the Meet and Greet
Preparing yourself for the unexpected
Perhaps the worst thing that can occur when you first meet someone is 
that you hesitate to see what the other person is going to do and then are 
completely unprepared for what happens next. The other person hugs you 
or proceeds to kiss you on both cheeks, and the discomfort causes you to 
recoil. All of your efforts at following the customer’s lead are now wasted, 
and you probably just made a lousy first impression.
By knowing a few typical greetings to expect, you can avoid shock and be pre-
pared to greet the person in the manner to which he has become accustomed:
 
 Limp handshakers: Many new immigrants have probably seen people 
shaking hands on television but may have never actually performed the 
ritual. So don’t be surprised or upset if a customer gives you a soft or 
hesitant handshake. Just return the same greeting. This is often the case 
with many Asian groups who are much more comfortable bowing.
 
 Huggers: Most people in the United States can hug someone without 
feeling too uncomfortable. Just pretend you’re hugging the aunt you see 
only once every two or three years. You may find your Hispanic repeat 
customers giving you this kind of greeting.
 
 Kissers: American men are generally uncomfortable having strangers, 
especially other men, kiss them, even if it’s only on the cheeks. We rec-
ommend that you go with the flow. Let the person kiss you on the cheek, 
and expect to get kissed on the other cheek, too, although the one-cheek 
kiss is most common. Any attempt to turn away after the person kisses 
you on one cheek and is moving to the other cheek is likely to result 
in that next kiss landing right on your lips! The French are famous for 
practicing this kind of greeting, as are many Middle Easterners. Don’t be 
surprised if folks from Southern Europe, the Mediterranean, and Latin 
America also kiss your cheek. Depending on the country and the situ-
ation, the number of kisses can range from one to four and may be fol-
lowed by shaking hands or hugging, so stay on your toes.
 
 Nodders: Watch for any head movements and “reply” in kind. In many 
cultures, the proper way to greet a woman who’s accompanying a male 
customer is to nod in her direction to show respect. The woman may 
feel uncomfortable shaking hands or being greeted in other ways. We go 
into more detail about acknowledging women in the later section, “Do 
drop your hands to your sides in a woman’s presence.”
 
 Bowers: Asian people and people from many other cultures around the 
world bow as a form of greeting. This form of greeting is sometimes used 
as an alternative by some Americans who are less touchy-feely. The depth 
of the bow is often determined by the rank of the parties according to a 
complex set of rules.

154
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
Greeting Middle Easterners and Southern Asians (primarily Asian Indians and 
Pakistanis) can pose a more difficult challenge for most people in the United 
States, who tend to lump all of these cultures into one group. When meeting 
someone from a Middle Eastern or Southern Asian background, keep the fol-
lowing in mind:
 
 Immigrant men from the Middle East often shake hands with a slight 
nod or bow and then exchange kisses with other men on both cheeks. 
Traditional Muslim men may shake hands and then touch the palm of 
their right hand to their heart as a sign of friendship. Men from this 
region generally don’t shake hands with women or introduce women 
who accompany them, nor are you expected to shake hands with any 
accompanying woman. Just nod in her direction as a sign of respect, 
unless she offers her hand first.
 
 Following centuries of British rule, most Hindu Eastern Indians seem to 
have adapted quickly to Western habits. Shaking hands is normal behavior 
for both men and women. If a woman is older, a courteous, respectful nod is 
usually preferred to a handshake. Traditional Indians may greet you with a 
namaste, which is a slight bow with the hands folded prayerfully in front of 
the chest. Traditional Indian men don’t ordinarily shake hands with women. 
Unless he offers his hand, just nod to him respectfully.
 
 Pakistanis generally shake hands with strangers and hug friends. Some 
men from this country don’t shake hands with women. Because Pakistan 
is a largely Muslim nation, people greet each other with salaam, which 
is the equivalent to our “hello.” The salaam is done by bowing with the 
palm of the right hand on the forehead. Salaam means “peace.” Note 
that it’s not the same as the Indian namaste greeting.
Practicing different forms of greeting
While following a customer’s lead seems simple enough, it takes a great deal 
of practice to break yourself of the habit of automatically sticking your hand 
out. Practice following a customer’s lead with another salesperson by taking 
turns meeting each other with different forms of greeting. For example, the 
other person may do his normal welcome, and you, playing the role of a cus-
tomer, may not put your hand out at all. In this case, the other person should 
simply nod to show respect and then begin his presentation.
When it’s your turn, you welcome him as if he’s the customer, and he can 
give you a bow, namaste, salaam, or some other greeting. It’s then your job to 
simply return the same greeting and start your normal presentation.
 
Keep practicing until you get into the habit of letting the customer dictate the 
form of greeting so that you don’t automatically try to shake hands and that it 
looks and feels natural to you and the person with whom you’re practicing.

155
 Chapter 8: Mastering the Meet and Greet
Do smile
Service with a smile is always important, whether you’re greeting mainstream 
customers or people from different cultures. If you enjoy your job, want 
to keep doing it for a while, and are committed to growing success, then 
develop a smile that expresses your sincere joy to see your customer. To 
every customer you greet, your smile should say, “I’m so glad to see you!” In 
the following sections, we describe the importance of a warm smile and pro-
vide tips on smiling more at customers.
Understanding why a sincere smile goes a long way
Walking into any store or office for the first time can be a frightening experi-
ence for any customer. This is your turf, not theirs. To customers from other 
cultures, your store or office may feel like a foreign country. They’re unfamil-
iar with the products and services, where things are located, and the person 
with whom they’re dealing. They may wonder whether you can meet their 
needs or whether your company is reliable.
Add to this mix the fact that they may not be completely familiar with the 
language and culture, and you soon realize that the experience can cause a 
major case of culture shock. Treat such a customer coldly and you’re likely 
to confirm their worst fears.
 
To overcome the fear and trepidation a customer feels, always greet customers 
with a warm, sincere smile. Don’t be fake about it. Believe us, they can tell. A 
sincere smile:
 
 Reduces the customer’s fear of the unknown
 
 Builds trust
 
 Makes your customer feel good about herself
 
 Makes your customer feel good about doing business with you
Practicing a sincere smile
Have someone watch you interact with a customer and note whether you 
smile when you first meet her. Did your expression seem sincere? How did 
the customer react? How often during your presentation did you smile? 
Could you have smiled more?
If you’re not smiling when you greet the person, make a conscious effort to 
do so. Imagine yourself greeting a friend you haven’t seen in quite a while and 
have been looking forward to seeing. This, along with some practice, should 
make your smile more genuine.

156
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
Smile when talking to customers over the telephone. Put a small, standing 
table mirror next to your telephone with a note on it that says “Smile.” This 
should remind you to smile during phone conversations with customers. Call 
a few friends while smiling into the mirror and ask them how you sound. We 
bet they’ll tell you that you sound “happy,” “upbeat,” and “positive.” People 
can actually hear your smile — your voice automatically expresses the tone of 
someone who’s friendly and helpful. Many people’s first or only contact with 
you may be over the phone. Leave them with a great impression!
Do drop your hands to your sides 
in a woman’s presence
If you’re a woman, you’re probably not going to greet other women with a 
firm handshake. In today’s atmosphere of gender equality, however, men 
often offer a firm handshake to women to acknowledge the fact that they’re 
equals. If you’re a salesman, reaching out to shake the hand of a woman from 
another culture, however, could be taken as a sign of disrespect — to the 
woman as well as to any man accompanying her.
In the following sections, we reveal a technique that’s suitable for meeting 
and greeting women from any culture — dropping your hands to your sides.
 
Most of your competitors are probably offending their customers without 
even knowing it. You may want to keep the secret of dropping your hands to 
your sides in a woman’s presence (and the advantage it gives you) to yourself.
Greeting a couple properly
 
When greeting a multicultural couple, it’s even more important to follow 
their lead. Often, the man shakes hands, in which case you simply return the 
greeting. (If he doesn’t, follow our advice in the earlier section “Don’t assume 
you know how your customer wants to be greeted.”) After shaking the man’s 
hand, however, drop your hand to your side before turning to any female com-
panion. Many traditional Middle Eastern, Asian Indian, Japanese, and other 
women are uncomfortable or even forbidden to touch another person who’s 
not a family member or husband. Touching her, even if you’re a woman, can 
be offensive not only to her but to her family and spouse as well.
Ah, what to do? Simple. If you turn to her with your hand at your side and 
she doesn’t extend her hand, simply nod in her direction to acknowledge her 
presence. Then begin your normal rapport-building process (see Chapter 9).
If the man doesn’t offer his hand, just nod toward him and then turn to the 
woman with your hands to your sides. If she doesn’t put her hand out, just 
nod to her as well and proceed with your normal sales presentation.

157
 Chapter 8: Mastering the Meet and Greet
Practicing dropping your hands to your sides
To practice the technique of dropping your hands to your sides, work with 
two other people. Together they play a multicultural couple whom you’re 
meeting for the first time. Welcome them in your normal manner, letting them 
take the lead. The first person greets you however he chooses. You receive 
the greeting, return it in kind, and drop your hands to your sides before turn-
ing to the other person. If the second person greets you, return the greeting 
in kind. If she doesn’t greet you, simply nod in her direction.
This is more complex than the previous exercise because you have two cus-
tomers who may greet you differently and you must remember to drop your 
hands to your sides between the two greetings. You and your partners can 
take turns being the customers and the salesperson so you can all experience 
what it’s like to be in each position. At first this is likely to look and feel awk-
ward, but with practice it becomes more natural.
Do greet everyone in the group
Customers from some cultures are known for turning shopping trips into 
family outings. You’re likely to sell not only to couples but also to their par-
ents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, and even their children.
To successfully navigate such situations, practice the rule of dropping your 
hands to your sides that we explain in the preceding section. Turn to the 
oldest person first, see what kind of greeting you receive, and then return 
a similar greeting. Look at the person nearest the oldest person and do the 
same. Continue this process until you’ve greeted everyone.
 
If the group contains children, greet them the same way you greet the adults. 
Avoid the temptation to reach down and tousle their hair. Some cultures inter-
pret this gesture as demeaning or even life threatening (see Chapter 11 for 
more on this).
Don’t be a slouch
Americans generally pride themselves on being casual, friendly people who 
love to make everyone around them feel at ease. Salespeople may even try 
to lighten things up by taking on an informal posture — slouching or lean-
ing against a table, a counter, or a wall while speaking with clients. For many 
salespeople, this informal “posturing” has become a fine-tuned sales skill and 
a deeply ingrained habit.
Unfortunately, what works well with laid-back Americans may not fly with 
more formal cultures. Luckily, slouching is curable with a couple of handy 
exercises (see the “Practicing better posture” section).

Posturing in other cultures
In the United States, proper posture used to be important, but that was 40 to 
50 years ago. Now, posture means very little here, even in business. In other 
cultures, however, posture is still an important part of business and social 
etiquette. Asians, for example, generally believe that control of the body dem-
onstrates discipline of the mind. Slouching or leaning is taken as a sign of an 
undisciplined or possibly lazy person.
 
Some people, like the Japanese, tend to believe that someone who slouches or 
leans can’t be trusted — honest people stand or sit upright with both feet flat 
on the ground (we explain more about foot placement in the upcoming “Don’t 
cross your legs . . . you may cross your customer” section). If you just follow 
your first-grade teacher’s advice about sitting and standing up straight, you 
won’t kill any sales with your posture. See the next section for tips on breaking 
yourself of the habit of leaning when talking to customers.
Practicing better posture
 
Your posture may be so much a part of who you are that you don’t even 
realize when you’re slouching or leaning on something. Ask an associate to 
observe you as you interact with customers and provide detailed feedback 
on whether you stand straight, sit tall, slouch, or lean. Also, have them tell 
you what they feel your posture conveys to the customer. Some salespeople’s 
body language conveys confidence, while others’ subtly conveys insecurity. 
You may be surprised to discover what your posture says about you. For 
more about improving your posture and other business etiquette, check out 
Business Etiquette For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Sue Fox (Wiley).
Here’s another exercise: Have someone snap some photos of you from the 
side in different positions — sitting and standing. Is your body upright, or do 
you unconsciously slouch? Your spine should appear straight, and your head 
should look balanced on your neck. Your chin should be parallel to the floor, 
not pointing up or down.
Don’t cross your legs . . . you 
may cross your customer
You may be thinking, “Can’t cross my legs?! Are these guys serious?” Yep, we 
are. In the United States, crossing your legs at the knees or ankles or resting 
an ankle on the opposite thigh is perfectly acceptable and a whole lot more 
comfortable than sitting flat-footed. This habit, however, isn’t universally 
accepted. Rest easy: It’s a fairly easy habit to break.
 
Some doctors say that crossing your legs can irritate your hips, strain your 
back, and cause other maladies. Regardless of what it does to you physically, 
when selling to multicultural customers, crossing your legs is dangerous.

159
 Chapter 8: Mastering the Meet and Greet
Pointing your sole — the ultimate insult?
Cross your legs and observe what happens. No matter how you do it, the 
soles of your shoes are at least a tad bit more visible to those around you. If 
you rest your ankle on your opposite thigh, your sole is pointing directly at 
the person to the left or right of you.
How can anyone possibly take this as an insult? Well, the foot is the lowest 
part of the body, the sole is the lowest part of the foot, and if you’ve gone 
shoeless around your house lately, you know that your sole is the filthiest 
part of your body. When you cross your legs, you point that filthy, lowdown 
sole of yours directly at someone sitting next to or across from you.
Some people in and around the Middle East actually cross their legs as an 
intentional, overt insult to another person. In that culture, showing someone 
the bottom of your foot says you’re looking for a fight. Many people from 
India, Thailand, and elsewhere also interpret this gesture in the same way.
 
When dealing with multicultural customers, keeping both feet firmly planted 
on the ground is best — in more ways than one.
 
Don’t cross your arms, either. As a salesperson, you’re probably aware that 
crossing your arms is a big no-no whenever you’re attempting to establish 
rapport with your traditional customers. It conveys a sense of distance in 
America, as well as in most other countries, like the Philippines. In some coun-
tries, like Turkey, it’s downright rude.
Practicing keeping your feet on the ground
If you’re in the habit of crossing your legs, try to become aware of when you 
do it. When you notice yourself starting to cross your legs, stop. If you’ve 
already crossed your legs, uncross them. The more you practice, the more 
accustomed you’ll be to keeping your feet flat on the floor. Keep at it, and 
you’re likely to stop crossing your legs in about three weeks.
Do mirror your customer’s body language
Your body language often carries more meaning than your words, and it 
expresses your true intentions more honestly, so be really careful about what 
your body is saying. We cover a couple of specific body language no-no’s 
in the previous two sections — don’t slouch and don’t cross your legs (or 
arms). In the following sections, we explain the big do of body language — 
do follow your customer’s lead — and give you pointers on controlling your 
body language.

Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Recognizing differences in expressiveness
Everything in America is big, including our body language. Depending on 
the culture, this can be a good thing or a bad thing. In many cultures, overly 
expressive body language can come across as being bombastic or loud. In 
other cultures, our big gestures may seem rather small and demure com-
pared with theirs. It’s all relative.
 
Avoid the tendency to judge others by American cultural standards. Just as 
you may be louder and more demonstrative than people in some cultures, 
people in other cultures may be louder and more demonstrative than you.
The following list can help you gauge the grandiosity of your body language 
for different cultures and provide you with tips on how to rein in your body 
when necessary:
 
 In most Asian nations, people avoid overly expressive body language for 
fear that they’ll betray their inner feelings and disrupt the harmony with 
everyone and everything around them. Other cultural groups may also 
be somewhat more reserved in their hand gestures and facial expres-
sions, so observe your clients and follow their lead.
 
 Opposite of Asians, African Americans can be very demonstrative with 
their body language. In fact, they tend to display more emotion and to 
be more enthusiastic than most white Americans in their gestures and 
voice inflections. You can usually be less restrained and more demon-
strative when dealing with people from this culture but, again, mirror 
your customer’s individual behavior.
 
 Middle Easterners and some Hispanics can also be more expressive than 
European Americans. You may even think they’re angry when you see 
them carrying on a conversation among themselves.
The moral of the story: Try to be aware of the amount of body language your 
customer uses and mirror them by adjusting the amount and breadth of your 
gestures to match theirs. (For additional do’s and don’ts for specific cultures, 
check out the appendix.)
 
When dealing with multicultural customers, your safest option is to be conser-
vative in your body language. Keep your elbows at your sides to limit the size 
of your gestures, at least until you’re sure you can be more expressive without 
making your customer feel uncomfortable.
Practicing control over your body language
Have another person watch your body language and gestures as you interact 
with a customer, and ask him to provide you with detailed feedback. Have 
him note whether you mirror your customer’s body language. Do you keep 
your gestures subtle at the beginning? Are you about as expressive as they 
are without coming across as phony?

161
 Chapter 8: Mastering the Meet and Greet
 
First, work on increasing your awareness of the customer’s body language, 
including the types and size of the gestures, and then adjust yours to match. 
This takes a great deal of practice, but top salespeople have mastered the 
art of body language, and many credit their success to their ability to subtly 
mirror their customers.
Do watch your gestures
To people of some cultures, gestures that are seemingly habitual to 
Americans are obscene or insulting, so be careful. In the following sections, 
we highlight several of the most common American gestures that can get you 
into trouble and show you how to modify (and even eliminate) your gestures.
Avoiding some potentially dangerous moves
 
We don’t want to make you overly self-conscious, but you may need to stop 
using some of the gestures that come naturally to you as a result of your 
American upbringing. Here are some of the most common gestures to avoid:
 
 Pointing: In many countries, pointing with the index finger is offensive. 
In Asia, most people point by cupping the hand with the palm up and 
pointing with the whole hand. With any customer, using the entire hand 
to indicate objects or people in the distance is a pretty safe practice.
 
 Beckoning: In the United States, we commonly place the hand up and 
repeatedly curl the index finger toward our body in a “come hither” 
gesture when we want someone to come to us. In a multicultural setting, 
however, you should use your entire hand to beckon someone. In Asia, 
for example, people do this by turning the palm down and pulling the 
fingers in a “scratching” motion.
 
 The “OK” sign: In the U.S. to show that everything is alright, we generally 
put the thumb and index finger together to form a rudimentary “OK,” but 
with multicultural customers, lose this gesture for sure. In Latin America, 
the “OK” sign generally means “screw you.” In France, it means “you’re 
worthless.” In other countries, it can have negative connotations as well.
 
 The “thumbs up” sign: In America, closing the hand with the thumb 
sticking straight up on the air indicates approval. However, it roughly 
equates to “Up yours!” in places like Russia, Australia, Iran, Greece, parts 
of West Africa, and South America (with the exception of Brazil).
 
 Standing with hands on hips: In many places, including Mexico and 
the Philippines, this can be interpreted as an aggressive gesture. Unless 
you’re looking for a fight, keep your hands off your hips.
 
 Standing with hands in pockets: Although people in the United States 
commonly stand with their hands in their pockets, avoid doing so with 
multicultural customers, who may see this gesture as rude or obscene. 
This sentiment is particularly true in European countries.

162
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Practicing modifying your gestures
Have someone observe you giving your sales presentation to a customer. Ask 
the person to note any gestures you make. Then go back and ask yourself 
whether any of the gestures could possibly be offensive to other cultures. As 
you become more aware of your gestures, you’ll begin to adjust, minimize, 
and eliminate them. Making gestures is often subconscious and subtle, so it 
takes a great deal of effort and time to modify them.
 
If you do business in an office or store that has a security camera trained on you, 
use the tapes to study your gestures and see how customers react to them.
Do minimize the use of your left hand
Estimates have southpaws making up about 10 percent (30 million) of the 
U.S. population. In fact, being left-handed is so well accepted that many 
stores cater exclusively to lefties, offering everything from specialized 
kitchen utensils to computer keyboards. In other countries, however, using 
the left hand is often considered rude, gross, and even insulting.
 
In the presence of people from other cultures, you’re better off not using your 
left hand. Writing or (worse) eating with your left hand in front of people for 
whom left-handedness is taboo can make them very uncomfortable.
Understanding what happens to lefties around the world
At this point, you may be asking yourself, “What happens to lefties in coun-
tries where left-handedness isn’t permitted?” The fact is that many countries 
have no lefties — parents train left-handedness out of their children at a very 
early age.
Particularly in Asia and the Middle East, people consider the left hand 
unclean and only to be used for personal hygiene purposes. The prohibition 
against using the left hand is so strong that parents in those countries tie 
their children’s left hands behind their backs until they get out of the habit 
of using it. Although it may seem cruel to us, in many third-world countries, 
having one hand for personal hygiene and the other for everything else is 
essential to prevent the spread of certain diseases.
 
Having said that, people from other cultures do use their left hands at times, 
using both hands to pass a platter of food or to present their business cards 
(we cover business card presentation later in this chapter). What you really 
need to be careful about is eating or touching food with your left hand.

163
 Chapter 8: Mastering the Meet and Greet
Practicing the use of your right hand only
If you are left-handed, minimizing the use of your left hand in front of multi-
cultural customers can be a major challenge, so focus on the most important 
skill first — eating with your right hand. (Writing with your left hand isn’t 
considered nearly as offensive as eating with it.) To train yourself to eat with 
your right hand, whenever you sit down to a meal, sit on your left hand so 
you won’t be tempted to use it.
If you’re right-handed, be aware of those times when you unconsciously use 
your left hand, even if you’re using it merely to take a piece of bread from 
a basket or plate. To increase your awareness of using your left hand, try 
sitting on it during meals or tie the fingers of your left hand together with a 
rubber band. These restraints will make you aware of any tendencies to use 
your left hand.
Eating with your right hand is the biggie, so if you dine with customers from 
“right-leaning” countries, focus on proper dinner etiquette. If you never have 
business meals, practice performing other common tasks by using your right 
hand only, including jotting down notes and handing items to people.
Don’t touch until you’re sure
People of many cultures, especially Asians, Brits, and Germans, aren’t as 
touchy-feely as most Americans are. On the other hand, some cultures tend 
to be much more tactile, encouraging complete strangers to embrace upon 
first meeting.
In the following sections, we point out cultures that tend to be more hands-
on or hands-off, and then lead you through an exercise that can help you 
adapt more naturally to different cultural preferences.
Noting differences in other cultures
The first step in accommodating multicultural customers’ needs is to note 
the rules of engagement in these other cultures. Following are some of the 
more important hands-on, hands-off rules for various cultures:
 
 If you’re a man, never touch a Japanese, Asian Indian, or Middle Eastern 
woman, even on the arm, because this could come across as the near 
equivalent of sexual assault. Although touching a man from these cul-
tures (Japanese, Asian Indian, or Middle Eastern) may not be as serious 
an offense, it could, nonetheless, make them very uncomfortable. Even 
a female salesperson touching a woman or man from these cultures can 
cause extreme discomfort, so wait until a customer touches you before 
you reach out to touch him or her.

164
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
 Puerto Ricans have an even friendlier, effusive culture than ours, so 
touching is not only permissible but also generally welcome. Follow 
your customer’s lead to determine their comfort level. Researchers 
observed people from this country in social settings and compared them 
with other cultures. Puerto Ricans touched each other an average of 180 
times an hour, while people in Florida made physical contact only twice 
an hour. Among the British, no intentional contact was observed at all.
 
 Studies show that African American males touch each other while con-
versing more often than Caucasian males. African American women tend 
to make physical contact about twice as often as White females. If your 
customers embrace you or reach out and pat you on the back, feel free 
to return the gesture.
 
If you’re a physically affectionate person, resist the urge to touch your cus-
tomers until you’re sure they’re comfortable with it. Err on the side of being 
conservative and let your customer take the lead. For additional details on 
establishing a comfortable distance between yourself and your customer, see 
the section “Establishing a Comfortable Distance” later in this chapter.
Practicing a hands-off policy
Ask a colleague to observe you as you interact with customers (preferably 
at least one of whom is from the culture you’re trying to attract). Have your 
colleague note any time you touch the person and how the person reacts. 
This gives you an objective perspective on how hands-on you really are and 
whether customers like it. Over time, this third-person perspective can make 
you more aware of when you touch customers and their reactions to you.
Don’t expect eye contact
In most of the do’s and don’ts in this chapter, we point out how people from 
other cultures react to your actions or body language, but just as important 
is how you interpret and react to their behaviors and gestures. Eye contact 
is one of the most common areas of misunderstanding between people from 
different cultures. People in the United States often misinterpret lack of eye 
contact as a lack of honesty and respect, when people from other cultures 
mean nothing of the sort when they look down or away.
Seeing eye to eye on eye contact issues
Many groups, such as Asians, particularly the Vietnamese, Japanese, and 
Koreans, avoid direct eye contact as a sign of respect for you. They feel that 
looking someone in the eye is intrusive and rude, so they look down to honor 
you. Unfortunately, this can be extremely uncomfortable for Americans.

165
 Chapter 8: Mastering the Meet and Greet
If a customer avoids their gaze, many salespeople make the mistake of assum-
ing the person isn’t buying what they’re selling, doesn’t respect them, or isn’t 
listening. They then proceed to do everything in their power to “earn” direct 
eye contact. Lack of eye contact may bother some salespeople so much that 
they may try to catch the customer’s eye by ducking their head down, which 
is probably just about the worst thing you can do.
 
The solution to lack of eye contact is fairly simple — look down. You can also 
use this as an opportunity to show your customers product brochures, rate 
charts, or other material, because they’re looking down already.
As usual, not all cultures behave the same way. Some cultures, including 
Hispanics and people from the Middle East, value direct eye contact even 
more than most people do in the Unites States. In fact, the saying “The eyes 
are the windows to the soul” is common in the Middle East. People from 
these groups may make Americans somewhat uncomfortable with their 
intense gaze. The best advice we can give you is to just get used to it.
Practicing your response to a lack of eye contact
The next time you’re working with a customer who doesn’t give you eye con-
tact, be aware of your reaction both physically and emotionally. Does it make 
you feel uncomfortable? Do you try to catch his eye? Practice looking down 
when he looks down. Keep telling yourself that he’s showing you respect and 
paying attention in spite of his lack of eye contact.
Looking for respect
Differences in attitudes about eye contact can 
result in serious cultural clashes. In Los Angeles 
in 1992, Korean stores in African American 
neighborhoods became targets for complaints 
because many African American shoppers felt 
that store owners were being disrespectful. As 
proof, many complaints cited the lack of eye 
contact on the part of Korean shop owners.
These disgruntled shoppers were simply unaware 
that Koreans avert their eyes as a sign of respect. 
Conversely, African Americans expect very direct 
eye contact for the same reason. Is it any wonder 
that this lack of understanding about cultural 
differences led to ill feelings?
Recognize that for many cultures looking down 
is showing you respect and is the way they pay 
attention.

Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Establishing a Comfortable Distance
During the late ’70s and early ’80s, when the “Me” generation was at its 
height, getting in touch with your personal space was a big thing. In high 
schools across the United States, students were taught that every individual 
had a zone — an invisible border, which, if breached, could cause intense 
personal discomfort. At some point in your life, you’ve probably been told 
that you were “invading” someone’s personal space.
Personal space varies according to individual preferences, but the variation 
is more pronounced among cultures. In the United States, most people are 
used to shaking hands and then standing 2 to 3 feet apart. Most cultures, 
however, prefer spaces that are either much farther or closer. In the follow-
ing sections, we explain differences in personal space around the world and 
give you a few pointers on handling these differences.
Surveying cultural differences 
in personal space
People in some cultures prefer to keep generous distances between them 
when they interact. In Japan, for example, people rarely get close enough to 
shake hands — they bow and then step back. Salespeople who aren’t aware 
of this phenomenon often feel as though they’re trying to yell across the 
Grand Canyon. They become so uncomfortable that they take a step toward 
the person who just stepped back. Of course, the person who just stepped 
back now feels uncomfortable and takes another step back. In some cases, 
this dance can go on for quite some time.
Then there’s the phenomenon of the close talker. If you’ve ever been the 
victim of a close talker, you know just how uncomfortable they can make you 
feel, but up close and personal is how many cultures prefer to communicate. 
Among these are the Hispanics and Middle Easterners, who often hug you 
and then stand about 6 inches from your face. If you just had the hoagie with 
onions for lunch, you’re probably wishing you had flossed, brushed, and 
popped a mint at this point.
Any closer than a couple of feet is way too close for most Americans, so we 
naturally flee to a more comfortable distance. Of course, this is probably too far 
away for the other party, so they naturally step forward, violating our personal 
space. If this continues, your customer ends up chasing you around your store. 
Obviously, this unintended dance makes communication difficult and uneasy. 
It’s also not very effective in starting your relationship on a positive footing.

167
 Chapter 8: Mastering the Meet and Greet
You can check out a variety of cultural comfort zones in Figure 8-1; all 
distances are approximate, and personal space can vary among individuals.

Standing your ground
 
When meeting any customer, let her set the personal space she finds comfort-
able. If, after her initial greeting, she steps back or forward, stand your ground 
and accept the fact that you’re not going to be operating in your comfort zone. 
You can become more accustomed to different comfort zones, however, by 
practicing the upcoming exercise. Just don’t practice too much — we’d hate 
to see you become a close talker.
 
The rules for minding a customer’s personal space can apply just as much 
in an office. If a client gets too close for comfort, simply offer her a seat on 
the other side of your desk. However, this probably won’t deter close talkers 
who are likely to lean across the desk to close the gap. If this happens, don’t 
withdraw; just be comfortable with the personal space the customer sets. 
Likewise, if the client leans away from the desk, don’t you be the offending 
party by leaning forward. Just as when you’re standing, let customers deter-
mine the personal space that’s most comfortable for them.

168
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
For this exercise, you need a partner, preferably someone you don’t know 
that well, and definitely not your spouse or anyone else you’re intimate with.
 
1. Stand about 6 feet apart.
 
2. Have your partner start walking toward you slowly.
 
3. When you feel your partner getting uncomfortably close, ask her to 
stop.
 
4. Note the approximate distance between your feet and your partner’s 
feet. This is your comfort zone.
 
5. Ask your partner to take one more step forward encroaching on your 
personal space.
 
6. Note how uncomfortable this feels, and recognize that when you vio-
late a customer’s personal space, they feel the same discomfort.
 
7. Hold your ground while talking with your partner, resisting the urge 
to move away.
 
8. Repeat the exercise, this time setting an uncomfortably distant space 
between you and your partner. Remember to hold your ground, no 
matter how anxious your feet are to move closer.
 
Invading a customer’s personal space almost guarantees they won’t feel 
comfortable with you. Standing too far away is a lesser offense, but it still 
won’t put them in the mood to buy.
 
As you talk to various people throughout the day (other than your customers 
or anyone else you shouldn’t be messing with), note the distance they seem to 
feel comfortable conversing at, and practice letting them set that distance. If 
you want to have some fun, after you’ve determined their preferred personal 
space, subtly move forward or back as you talk, and watch their reactions. 
Enjoy the dance!
Exchanging Business Cards 
with Care and Courtesy
In the United States, people exchange business cards with about as much 
pomp and circumstance as they deal poker cards. In other parts of the world, 
however, exchanging business cards is a formal ritual with strict rules of eti-
quette. These rules cover everything from translating your card to the case 
you store them in to how you present your card and accept cards from others. 
The following sections cover all of these rules and offer an exercise that can 
help you develop the necessary skills to exchange business cards properly.

169
 Chapter 8: Mastering the Meet and Greet
Translating your card for 
multicultural customers
Some salespeople want to make customers more comfortable by having their 
contact information printed in the customer’s native language on the flip side 
of their business card. If you decide to do this, avoid potential embarrass-
ment by having someone who knows both your industry and the appropriate 
second language do the translation.
When working with a translator, be sure that you know specifically where the 
majority of your multicultural customers are from and what language they 
use. For instance, simplified Chinese is used primarily in mainland China, 
while traditional Chinese is preferred in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For more 
about translations, check out Chapter 5.
 
When adding a translation to the reverse side of your card, make sure both 
sides of the card are identical in terms of colors, logo, type size, and other 
features. If your cameo shot is on the English side, include it on the foreign 
language side, too. If the English side is printed in full color, print the flip side 
in full color, too. Any difference, even calling the special side “the back,” may 
be taken as a slight to the customer, implying that the American culture and 
English language are superior to the customer’s. Done incorrectly, your new, 
improved card can do more harm than good.
Treating your own card with respect
 
In many cultures, the business card literally represents the actual person 
giving the card. Customers from other cultures where business cards are 
highly valued expect you to treat not only their business cards with respect, 
but your own as well:
 
 Don’t staple your business card to a document, folder, invoice, 
receipt, or anything else. If you need to attach your business card to a 
folder, buy special folders that have a place to insert or paste a business 
card, or paper clip the card to the folder. (As you discover in the next 
section, your card represents you — stapling your card is like putting a 
hole through your head.)
 
 Don’t write anything on your business card. Again, because the card 
represents you, it would be the same as writing on your face. This is a 
good rule to follow in relation to the cards you receive, too.
 
 Carry your business cards in a brass card case. Avoid leather card 
cases because the cow is sacred in some cultures, such as those that 
practice the Hindu religion.

170
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Presenting and accepting cards
Although your business card itself is important, how you present it to a 
customer or prospective customer can be even more important. Although 
etiquette varies, the following rules are safe to practice regardless of culture:
 
 Act formal about it. Presenting a business card isn’t a casual activity in 
most cultures.
 
 Offer your card with both hands, with the lettering on your card 
facing the customer. If the customer bows while presenting his card, 
just do the same.
 
 Explain what your title means to the client and provide the proper 
pronunciation of your name if it happens to be a tricky name.
 
Even more important than how you present your business card is how you 
accept your customer’s card and what you do with it after accepting it. Again, 
the following strict rules are appropriate for most situations:
 
 Accept the other person’s card with your right hand only. Why? Use of 
the left hand for most activities is taboo in many cultures. See “Do mini-
mize the use of your left hand,” earlier in this chapter, for details.
 
 Spend time examining the other person’s card. Study it as if it were a 
holy book, because that can be the level of significance attached to busi-
ness cards in other cultures.
 
 Ask about the customer’s title. Their title probably indicates the per-
son’s rank and status, which can be very important to some people.
 
 If your customer has a difficult-to-pronounce name, write it down pho-
netically as he repeats it — but not on his card.
 
 Respectfully place the customer’s card on your desk or insert it into 
your card holder. If you’re a man, never put the card in your wallet and 
then place the wallet in the back pocket of your pants, because you could 
sit on the card, which would be the same as sitting on your customer. If 
you’re a woman, don’t put the card in your purse and let your purse hang 
below your waist; keep the purse tucked safely under your arm.
 
 Remember that the card represents the actual person, so don’t staple 
the card (just as you wouldn’t staple the person) or write on the card. 
To attach a card to a file or document, use a paper clip.
 
Practice exchanging business cards with colleagues. At first, you may feel awk-
ward removing your card from its case and fumbling with it to make sure the 
lettering is facing a customer as you try to present your card with both hands. 
Remembering to accept a business card only with your right hand can also be 
a challenge. However, after practicing this several times, it becomes natural, 
and others will feel it’s respectful as well.

P
rominent speaker and business columnist Terry Brock likes to talk 
about r-commerce (relationship-commerce), which fuels all other forms 
of commerce, including e-commerce. As Terry explains it, selling is all about 
building relationships and then letting the relationship generate business. By 
focusing on relationships instead of on selling products or services, you actu-
ally sell more and have more fun doing it.
R-commerce has even more force in multicultural markets, where people of 
other cultures may have even less trust in what seems to be a foreign mar-
ketplace to them. To break into these new markets, you have to work on 
building solid relationships and a positive presence with customers and their 
communities. This chapter shows you how.
Fostering Relationships in High- and 
Low-Context Cultures
A funny thing happens when you become a top-producing salesperson. You 
stop selling. You stop worrying about the numbers — about sales quotas and 
profits and the bottom line. You start talking to people. You build relation-
ships, partnerships, and business synergies.

172
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
You stop selling, but you end up earning more than you ever did when you 
were trying to sell, because you tap into the secret of selling — building long-
term relationships that are beneficial for both you and your customers. This 
is especially true for multicultural customers, particularly those who come 
from high-context cultures, as we discuss in the following sections. (See 
Chapter 3 for an introduction to high- and low-context cultures.)
 
Many salespeople ignore multicultural buyers because closing a sale with 
them can often take more effort. They tend to require more time to get to 
know you and your company, and may require more thorough explanations 
of the products and services you offer. They also may want to confer with 
others inside and outside their family before making a final decision. The fact 
that multicultural customers generally need more of a salesperson’s time and 
effort is exactly why they represent a golden opportunity for you — the com-
petition for these customers is usually light because many salespeople lack 
the patience. Invest the time upfront, and you’ll soon find that working with all 
the referral customers your original customer sends your way requires much 
less effort. For more about referrals, check out Chapter 15.
Establishing trust with 
high-context cultures
 
In places like Asia, South America, the Middle East, and Africa, decisions are 
based less on facts than on feelings — less on products and services than on 
the person selling them. Customers from high-context cultures need to feel the 
love (and trust) before they part with their hard-earned cash, so take the fol-
lowing steps toward building a trusting relationship:
 
 Be honest and genuine. Most people can spot a phony, so don’t try 
being someone you’re not.
 
 Keep your promises. Don’t say you’re going to do something unless 
you’re really going to do it.
 
 Highlight the fact that you represent a reputable company. Anything 
you can do to show that your company has a good track record can help 
convince customers that you’re trustworthy.
 
 Get involved in their community. Chapter 5 has all sorts of ideas to 
help you do this.
 
 Develop a comprehensive program to cater to multicultural customers. 
This further demonstrates your commitment to your customer. (You 
can find more details on crafting a quality program in Chapter 6.)

173
 Chapter 9: Building Rapport with Culturally Diverse Clientele
Catering to the tendencies 
of low-context cultures
In low-context cultures, relationships still matter, but the deal itself is more 
important. Americans are a perfect example, because we always seem most 
interested in the bottom line. We generally want to spend less time getting to 
know the salesperson and more time talking about the details of the purchase.
 
Low-context cultures value logic, facts, and directness. Decisions are based 
more on facts rather than on intuition. After buyers have the facts, they’re 
expected to make a decision. Most of North America and Western Europe 
comprise low-context cultures, including the United States, Switzerland, and 
Germany. This may help you better understand these countries’ no-nonsense 
attitude toward business.
Relationship building is still important in low-context cultures, but a strong 
relationship depends more on your ability to quickly assess a customer’s 
needs and then fulfill them. Here’s how to focus on the customer’s needs:
 
 Ask questions. You must know what the person needs before you can 
sell to those needs.
 
 Provide plenty of relevant information about your products and ser-
vices and how they can benefit your customer. Customers from low-
context cultures usually have a big appetite for relevant details. Your 
knowledge positions you as a trustworthy expert.
 
 Get to the point. Your customer probably doesn’t want to spend as 
much time getting to know you and your company as the product or ser-
vice they’re buying.
 
 Give the facts. Provide as many facts and figures as you can to back up 
everything you say. In low-context cultures, trust is based more on proof 
than on relationships.
Gathering referrals based on trust
Quality relationships tend to generate referrals, regardless of whether the 
relationships are with customers from high- or low-context cultures. When 
customers trust you, they’re much more likely to refer friends, family, and 
acquaintances to you.
Even so, as soon as you make a sale, ask for a referral. People who trust you 
won’t hesitate to refer others to you. This is so important that we devote 
Chapter 15 to exactly how and when to ask for referrals.

174
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
The best time to ask for a referral is when a customer thanks you or says 
something like, “I don’t know how to thank you.” That’s a perfect opening to 
tell them how they can show their thanks — by referring people to you.
Clearing Any Language Barriers
Salespeople in the United States can celebrate two bits of good news.
 
 First, English is considered the universal language of commerce, 
although that can certainly change.
 
 Second, many salespeople who can speak and write only in English are 
highly successful selling to customers from other cultures both here and 
abroad.
Even with this good news, you’re likely to encounter some uncomfortable 
sales situations because of language barriers. Even salespeople born with a 
silver tongue are likely to encounter language barriers when they’re selling to 
first- or second-generation Americans. In the following sections, we provide 
some guidance on what to do and say and what not to do and say that can 
improve the clarity of your communications.
The basics of breaking down 
a language barrier
 
The easiest way to overcome a language barrier in the absence of an inter-
preter is to use your hands, arms, legs, gestures, facial expressions, emotions, 
and demonstrations to communicate. Here are some tips for surmounting 
even the highest of hurdles:
 
 Show some emotion: Most emotions, such as excitement, joy, fear, 
frustration, and anger, are universal. Just remember that some cultures 
are more or less restrained in their expressions, so stay within your 
customers’ comfort zone. Follow the customer’s lead, as explained in 
Chapter 8. I (Ralph) like to call this mirroring the customer, but you have to 
do it naturally and subtly, so as not to appear as though you’re mimicking 
your customers.
 
 Slow down, but don’t shout: Even if a customer understands English, 
different people have different levels of fluency. You may be speaking 
or introducing new concepts so fast that everything becomes a blur 
to them. Slow down, but avoid cranking up the volume. Immigrant 
customers who don’t comprehend your words probably aren’t hearing-
impaired; they’re more likely just unfamiliar with English.

175
 Chapter 9: Building Rapport with Culturally Diverse Clientele
 
 Draw it: Some people prefer to see things as opposed to hearing about 
them, so even the most rudimentary drawing can be much more helpful 
than trying to repeat your words over and over. Also, finding a picture 
from a magazine or showing a customer a chart or graph can speak 
much more clearly than words.
 
 Show without so much tell: Some people prefer to experience a product 
for themselves. If possible, let the person try out the product or service.
 
 Ask for help: If others are around who speak your customer’s language, 
don’t be shy about asking for their assistance. People who are bilin-
gual are often willing to translate for those who aren’t, whether you’re 
in a store, office, airport, hotel, or some other location. If you have a 
bilingual member on your sales team, all the better (see Chapter 16 for 
details on diversifying your staff).
 
 Double-check your customer’s understanding: If you’re unsure whether 
your client has understood your message, try to confirm meanings by 
asking the question a different way or having her explain information 
back to you.
 
 Be patient: The key to overcoming any language barrier is to exercise 
patience. It’s not your or the customer’s fault that you can’t speak each 
other’s language.
 
 Maintain your sense of humor: Overcoming language barriers can be 
frustrating for you as well as for your customer. A smile can help break 
the tension and make communicating easier.
Faking it — not the smoothest move
I (Michael) am fifth-generation Chinese, so I 
grew up 100 percent American. Thanks to the 
California public school system, the only lan-
guage I speak, other than English, is Spanish.
When I began dating, if things went well with 
a young lady, she would invite me over to her 
house to meet her parents. Although I tried to 
prepare completely for the interrogation I knew 
would probably ensue, what really caught me by 
surprise was the very first question. Inevitably 
a Chinese father would start the conversation 
with, “What dialect do you speak?” I had for-
gotten that the Chinese language actually con-
sists of many different dialects, most of which 
are incomprehensible to the groups that speak 
other dialects.
Although I didn’t speak any Chinese, I did realize 
that if I revealed this fact to the girl’s inquisitive 
father, I probably would never see his daughter 
again. So I did what any red-blooded American 
teenager would do in my situation — I lied. I told 
him, “I speak Fukienese.” Thankfully, the father 
would usually respond, “Fukienese? We speak 
Mandarin and three dialects of Cantonese, but 
Fukienese?” Thinking quickly I just smiled and 
responded, “It’s okay. We’ll just use English!”
I felt pretty smug until one day I was introduced 
to a father who actually spoke Fukienese and 
who caught me in a lie. That day, I learned a 
very important lesson: When it comes to cul-
ture, don’t fib, because it instantly breaks all the 
trust you’ve tried so hard to build.

176
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
In with the good words, out with the bad
Certain words resonate with some cultures while other words can evoke an 
unpleasant emotional response, so choose your words carefully. A person’s 
attitude toward certain words arises from whether she is from an individual-
istic culture (one that values directness and where people freely speak their 
minds) or a collectivist culture (one that values harmony and in which people 
tend to avoid direct confrontation). (See Chapter 6 for more on the differ-
ences between these cultures.)
Individualistic cultures are no better or worse than collectivist cultures — 
they’re just different. As such, each group must be approached differently, 
and that approach includes the words you use. In the following sections, we 
provide some guidelines for choosing words that appeal to most people in 
either individualistic or collectivist cultures.
 
To tell the difference between an individualistic and a collectivist culture, 
remember this Japanese saying that pretty much sums up the collectivist phi-
losophy: “The nail that sticks up gets hammered down.”
Words that resonate with individualistic cultures
When selling to individualistic cultures including Caucasian Americans, Black 
Americans, Canadians, the British, and others, consider using words and con-
cepts they’re likely to find appealing, including the following:
 
 You, me, yourself, mine
 
 Discover, unearth, detect
 
 Special, rare, unique, one-of-a kind, custom
 
 Guaranteed, warranted
 
 New, first-time, improved
 
 Affordable, economical, inexpensive
 
 Best, superior, unsurpassed, choice
Words that resonate with collectivist cultures
When selling to people from collectivist cultures, including Hispanics, Asians, 
Middle Easterners, and others, the most appealing words celebrate the group 
rather than the individual:
 
 Family, together, belonging
 
 We, us, our, ours
 
 Learn, knowledge, wisdom, education

177
 Chapter 9: Building Rapport with Culturally Diverse Clientele
 
 Modest, harmony, cooperation, collaboration, sharing, working together, 
community, collective
 
 Guaranteed, warranted, assured
 
 Tried, proven, traditional (the equivalent of “proven” but opposite of “new”)
 
 Safety, security, protection
 
 Consensus, agreement
 
 Closeness, group, children, society, bonds, relationship
 
When presenting a product or service to customers from collectivist cultures, 
demonstrate humility. Although most of your customers want to be assured 
that you offer the best products and services, people from other cultures may 
interpret overt comparisons as you putting down your competition. This can 
cause you to lose face. Instead, just tell them what you do best.
Words to use cautiously in all cultures
 
A couple of hot-button words resonate with people of almost all cultures but 
in different ways:
 
 Money (important in all cultures but not always to the same degree or in 
the same way)
 
 Free (important in all cultures but may raise suspicions if a trusting 
relationship hasn’t been established)
 
In addition, when selling to multicultural Americans, avoid saying the words 
“honestly” and “frankly.” Unless you give them reason to think otherwise, 
they’ll assume you’re being truthful and forthright. Reminding them how frank 
and honest you are can give them cause to question your ethics. As the Queen 
in Hamlet says, “The lady doth protest too much.”
Avoiding jargon — honestly!
In sales and many specialized fields, including everything from medicine to 
mortgage lending, jargon is an occupational hazard. Professionals develop 
their own shorthand to communicate more efficiently, but to outsiders, the 
highly specialized lingo comprises an entirely new foreign language.
Imagine a real estate professional saying something like, “When you look 
at the amortization schedule for a wraparound loan, check to see if it’s an 
ARM or GPM and watch out for acceleration clauses or call options.” If you 
speak English fluently and can’t understand this, just imagine the obstacles 
it throws in the path of someone who’s new to the language. Our advice is to 
avoid using jargon and present your ideas in plain English.

Relationship Building 101
If you have built and maintained long-term relationships, you’re already 
aware that every relationship is unique because every person is unique. 
People from other cultures are even more distinctive because they grew up 
so differently from your other customers. As a result, the process you follow 
for building relationships is going to be much different than usual.
In the following sections, we spotlight some of the cultural differences that 
affect relationship building and then reveal some strategies for building solid 
relationships with customers from other cultures.
Bridging the communication gap
When you encounter a prospective client who 
doesn’t speak your language, all is not lost. With 
a little creativity, you may be able to bridge the 
communication gap and make the sale. Greg 
Kraynak, vice president of sales at Cellhire 
(www.cellhire.com), tells the story of an 
Italian gentleman who wasn’t about to let a 
language barrier get in the way of his learning 
more about what Cellhire has to offer:
 
 “At Cellhire, we provide our U.S. business 
clients who travel overseas the opportu-
nity to rent, on a short term basis, a local 
number in their destination country. Similar 
offers are available for international trav-
elers visiting the U.S. We frequently par-
ticipate in trade shows in the U.S. to make 
potential clients aware of alternatives to 
costly mobile roaming rates (and poor call 
quality) when they leave the country. This 
past summer we attended a large show in 
Orlando, Florida, that attracted visitors from 
all over the world.
 
 “While working the booth I was approached 
by an Italian gentleman, who spoke very 
little English. My Italian is no better, as 
‘pizza’ is the only Italian word I can con-
sistently pronounce correctly. I’ve been 
in situations like this before. What usually 
happens is that both parties realize they’ve 
hit a communications brick wall, deliver the 
universal hand wave that roughly means 
‘well, we tried,’ and then move on.
 
 “Not this guy. He thought he roughly under-
stood what we had to offer and was willing 
to invest some time to learn more. I hap-
pened to have a laptop on our display with 
a high-speed wireless card connected to 
the Internet. He motioned to make sure he 
had my approval to use the PC. I nodded 
yes, and he navigated us to a translation 
tool at the following Web address: free-
translation.imtranslator.
net. In a matter of minutes, we were com-
municating like old friends. He was firing 
off questions, and I was responding all in 
real time with some quick typing and a click 
of a button. Although the messages came 
through the computer, the reactions and 
the buying signs were all the same.
 
 “This software and a little persistence 
brought us a client that we otherwise would 
have missed. We all marvel at the power 
of the Internet, but I could never have mas-
tered Italian in an afternoon to close this 
sale had it not been for a wireless card and 
the electronic world of the Internet.”

179
 Chapter 9: Building Rapport with Culturally Diverse Clientele
Noting key differences
America is a country on the go. As such, the average American moves more 
than 11 times during his lifetime. We make friends easily and leave them 
behind just as quickly. We generally trust people until they give us good 
reason not to trust them. People from other cultures often have a different 
perspective on relationships:
 
 Relationships in many countries tend to be much longer and deeper 
than relationships in America. Foreigners often comment that we seem 
to have many people we call friends but whom we don’t know very 
well. In Asia and Latin America, many people count among their friends 
people they’ve known since grammar school or longer.
 
 Multicultural customers are much more likely to be repeat customers. 
They stick with the people they trust. In America, on the other hand, 
customers are often more fickle, going with whichever salesperson or 
store is currently offering the best deal.
 
 Customers from high-context cultures, such as those found in Latin 
America and Asia, want to build relationships before doing business. 
Americans tend to want to get down to business right away, which 
doesn’t lend itself to building trust with multicultural customers. People 
from high-context cultures aren’t always comfortable with people from 
low-context cultures. They tend to find Americans rather superficial 
and always in a hurry. (See “Fostering Relationships in High- and Low-
Context Cultures,” earlier in this chapter, for more details.)
 
Take the time to get to know your customers as people first and a paycheck 
second. Look for common ground upon which you can build a lasting relation-
ship. You may want to start by finding out more about your clients’ culture; 
see “Asking clients about their culture” later in this chapter. This not only 
makes your interactions more enjoyable, but lowers your marketing costs at 
the same time through increased referrals (see the earlier section, “Gathering 
referrals based on trust,” for more on this idea).
Skipping high-pressure sales tactics
The hard sell is as obsolete as the door-to-door salesman. Today’s customers 
are too savvy to fall for the line that you’re offering them a once-in-a-lifetime 
deal. Any attempt to pressure a customer into making a hasty purchase deci-
sion usually backfires, making the customer trust you even less. This is espe-
cially true when selling in the multicultural market.
When you’re building rapport and making your sales presentation, ditch the 
hard-sell approach. We discuss this more in Chapter 12.

180
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Asking the right questions
Good salespeople ask good questions and lots of them. At the beginning, find-
ing common ground to establish rapport is crucial. Common rapport-building 
questions are similar to those you ask any customer, including the following:
 
 Where are you folks from?
 
 How many people are in your family?
 
 Where do you work?
 
 What do you do for a living?
 
 Where do your kids go to school?
 
 What do you like to do for fun?
During this rapport-building stage, you may feel the urge to start asking the 
questions you usually use to identify the customer’s needs. It’s certainly okay 
to ask such questions, but try to keep the conversation light at this stage. In 
Chapter 10, we introduce you to questions for assessing the customer’s needs.
Asking clients about their culture
Americans are starting to become so politically correct that they’re 
approaching the point of being politically incorrect and perhaps even a little 
cold. Many Americans are afraid to acknowledge that other people are differ-
ent, so they avoid asking any questions that could call attention to the per-
son’s differences. As a result, they never obtain the information they need to 
practice the Global Rule: Treat others as they would like to be treated.
Asking your clients about their culture enables you to investigate cultural 
tendencies and understand them better. In addition, gathering information 
about your customers’ cultures helps you meet their needs more effectively 
and increase sales at the same time.
Breaking through cultural static
Failing to address cultural differences is like having an 800-pound gorilla in 
the room and not, at least, acknowledging its existence. Without saying a 
word, that gorilla is going to generate so much tension and distraction (also 
called cultural static) among everyone in the room that nobody is going to 
be able to have a productive conversation. You have to clear your head by 
acknowledging your cultural differences before you can ever hope to get past 
them. After all, if you can’t hear your customer, how can you meet his needs?

181
 Chapter 9: Building Rapport with Culturally Diverse Clientele
Minorities in America, including the author (Michael), know they don’t look 
like the average customer you probably deal with on a daily basis. If you 
don’t take the time to acknowledge and gather information about these other 
cultures, you’re always going to have unanswered questions that cloud your 
communications with people from these cultures. Instead of trying to meet 
your customer’s needs, you’re distracted by thoughts such as, “I wonder 
what country they’re from” or “What’s the painted dot on that Southeast 
Indian woman’s forehead all about?”
When I (Michael) was helping a Sikh Indian gentleman buy a home, I wondered 
if people of the Sikh religion wore their turbans in bed or if they took them 
off. (Don’t laugh. I’ll bet you’ve secretly wondered the same thing!) After a few 
meetings, I finally worked up the courage to ask him. He was happy to explain 
that they unwrap the 17-foot length of material every night before retiring and 
rewrap it in the morning. Only then did I realize that he’d been telling me he 
wanted to buy a townhome and not a condominium. My preoccupation with 
the turban question had prevented me from hearing this important difference.
 
Is cultural static keeping you from hearing your customers clearly? Go ahead 
and ask about their culture, language, dress, or anything else that pops into your 
head. Most people from other cultures are usually happy to answer any sincere 
question in order to banish cultural static. They not only want you to understand 
them, but they also want you to hear their wants and needs clearly.
The talking stain
During Super Bowl XLII, a laundry detergent 
manufacturer ran what would soon become 
the famous talking stain commercial. In it, a job 
candidate who has a brown stain on his shirt 
is being interviewed. The person conducting 
the interview is asking questions, but as the 
candidate is answering, the stain is talking gib-
berish that makes it totally impossible to make 
out what the job candidate is saying. (If you’re 
unfamiliar with this commercial, visit YouTube 
at www.youtube.com and search for “talk-
ing stain commercial.”)
This is exactly what occurs when salespeople 
don’t acknowledge a customer’s cultural differ-
ences. Your mind subconsciously focuses on 
those differences instead of on what the person 
is saying. As a result, you can’t tune into what 
really matters.
Imagine if you went out to lunch at an Italian 
restaurant with co-workers and you acciden-
tally smeared spaghetti sauce on your cheek 
during the meal. In an attempt to be nice about 
it, your colleagues may not say anything, but no 
matter what you say or how important it is, they 
can’t hear you. Their minds are focused on only 
one thought: “You’ve got spaghetti sauce on 
your cheek, you slob!”
If they simply acknowledge that you have spa-
ghetti sauce on your cheek, you could wipe it 
off, and that would be the end of it. Instead, by 
trying to be nice, they’ve actually done you a 
disservice. So do yourself and your multicultural 
customers a favor: If there’s something you’re 
curious about, go ahead and ask about it. Then 
everyone can focus on the matter at hand.

182
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Showing genuine interest
Most Americans have no idea how to ask another person about his cultural 
background without offending him. Some of us think it’s a compliment to tell 
someone who appears to be a new immigrant, “You speak English well,” but if 
he’s been in this country for many years or several generations, he could feel 
quite insulted.
 
So how do you ask about culture? The easiest way is to casually bring up your 
own racial or ethnic background; your customers may have their own unan-
swered questions causing static in their minds. Research your family’s back-
ground in this country and then subtly mention how long ago your ancestors 
came here. After you’ve done a bit of self-disclosure, you can then ask, “Where 
are your ancestors from?” You’ll be surprised how people open up when you 
take an interest in their heritage.
When you express a genuine interest in your customers and their heritage, 
it’s unlikely to come across as insulting. Generally, the only reason someone 
would take offense at a question about culture is if he thinks you’re ridiculing 
him. We know you would never do this, so you have nothing to worry about.
Asking everyone about their culture
 
If you’re going to ask customers about their culture, you must ask all of your 
customers — not just the ones who aren’t Caucasians. Otherwise, you make 
yourself a target for claims of discrimination. By asking everyone, you over-
come this presumption.
Top salespeople find a way to subtly bring up the subject of culture early in 
their relationships with new customers by explaining that this knowledge can 
help them serve the customer better. You’re likely to discover that asking 
questions about a person’s culture can elicit some fascinating rapport-building 
conversations, whether your customers are from England, Thailand, or Toledo.
Of course, you may need to approach the subject more gradually with your 
mainstream customers because it’s probably rare that they’re ever asked 
about their culture. If you start asking them questions about their heritage 
right off the bat, they may think you’re a little odd. Start by asking where 
they’re from. If they’re new to the area, you can ask questions leading back 
to where their parents and grandparents are from and eventually work your 
way into a discussion of culture.
Obviously, the longer your sales presentation, the easier and more natural it 
is to get into a discussion about culture. In many retail situations, you may 
never get the chance to bring up the subject, and you’ll just have to rely on 
the information in this book to help you spot cultural tendencies.

183
 Chapter 9: Building Rapport with Culturally Diverse Clientele
Identifying Differences in Generations
Generally speaking, the longer a family has lived in the states, the more accul-
turated (adapted to American culture) they are. Third-generation immigrants, 
for example, tend to be almost fully Americanized and think of themselves 
more as Americans than as hailing from a distant land.
How you deal with your multicultural clientele depends on how long the 
family has been living in this country, so it’s important to find out by asking 
about the person’s heritage and how long she’s been here.
First-generation Americans
Recent immigrants are generally going to have the most difficulty with 
American-style English and the least familiarity with American practices. 
They, more so than longtime residents who share their background, are also 
more likely to prefer products and services that are similar to those found in 
their home country. Use the tips we present throughout this chapter and this 
book to build rapport with and sell your product or service to these folks.
 
First-generation immigrants in particular may need a bit more education about 
your product or service because they may not be familiar with it. For example, 
escrow services, which are commonly used on home purchases in the United 
States, are unknown in much of the rest of the world. Although educating 
these customers is essential, you don’t want to overwhelm them by telling 
them everything you know about it. Share information with them on a need-to-
know basis.
Second-generation Americans
Second-generation Americans are the first generation to be born in the 
United States. They’re usually bilingual, speaking their parents’ native lan-
guage at home while learning English in school. They share the preferences 
of most Americans but are also heavily influenced by their parents’ country 
and customs.
Because of their split loyalties, second-generation Americans tend to present 
the biggest challenge for multicultural marketers. Are they best reached in-
language or in English? Do they prefer products and services found in their 
ancestors’ country of origin or American made?

184
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Sometimes language and product preferences depend on which country they’re 
from, where they’re currently living, and other factors. For instance, a second-
generation immigrant from England or Canada is likely to find it easier to assimi-
late to the American culture than someone from the Middle East or Asia.
The best way to build rapport with second-generation Americans is to ask 
questions, follow their lead, and take note of how acculturated they are. 
Some may act more like first-generation immigrants, whereas others may 
want to leave the old customs behind.
 
One way to determine preferences is to simply ask your customers. Another 
way is to provide items found in their home country or the equivalent prod-
ucts and services from the United States and see how they sell. By carefully 
tracking sales, you’ll quickly identify your customers’ preferences. (See 
Chapter 7 for details on offering imported ethnic products.)
Third-generation Americans
Third-generation Americans are usually very assimilated. They may know a 
few words or phrases in their grandparents’ native language, but for most of 
them, English is their preferred language, and they may behave much more 
like long-established Americans than their ethnicity implies.
 
However, recognize that they may still be influenced by their ancestral cul-
tural practices and beliefs. For example, third-generation immigrants from cul-
tures in which paying cash for everything is the norm may still be hesitant to 
finance purchases. Be alert to the cultural tendencies you’ve discovered about 
your target market so you’re better able to predict preferences and behaviors, 
but don’t make any hasty assumptions.
Fourth-generation Americans and beyond
Fourth-, fifth- and sixth-generation Americans are truly Americans in every 
sense of the word. They’re unlikely to speak the language of their ancestors 
and are likely to have very American tastes.
When building rapport with fourth-generation and longer-term Americans, you 
can usually treat them the same way you treat most of your customers, but 
always be prepared for a surprise. Culture runs very deep and can show up in 
unusual ways. One day I (Michael) got a frantic phone call from my friend Lillian 
who is a fourth-generation Chinese American. She desperately wanted to know 
which is the unlucky direction for Asians because she was about to buy a new 
home. I said to her, “If you don’t know, why do you care?” She replied, “I don’t, 
but my parents will never step foot into a house that faces the wrong way.” You 
can see that multicultural Americans can be influenced by many forces.

185
 Chapter 9: Building Rapport with Culturally Diverse Clientele
By the way, many Asians consider north to be an unlucky direction because 
that’s where they believe the devil lives. Therefore, if he sees the front of 
your house, it reminds him to send bad luck your way.
Taking Names . . . and 
Using Them Properly
Every successful salesperson knows how important it is to address custom-
ers by their preferred names. However, when you’ve grown up with Smiths 
and Howards, you may have trouble pronouncing more exotic names, espe-
cially the long ones like Athanasopoulos (Greek), Kohanamoku (Hawaiian), or 
Niratpattanasai (Thai).
Most people who have family or personal names that are difficult for 
Americans to pronounce or spell are well aware of it. They often take on an 
easier pseudonym, telling you something like, “Just call me ‘John’” or “Just 
call me ‘Mary.’” They want so much to make you feel comfortable that they’re 
willing to take a name that carries some significance in their own language and 
Americanize it for you. Return the courtesy by finding out how to properly pro-
nounce, spell, and use their real names, as explained in the following sections.
What’s in a name?
Surnames can give you a clue about where the 
customer’s ancestors came from:
  Chinese names tend to be monosyllabic — 
one syllable. The three most popular names 
in mainland China are Li, Wang, and Zhang, 
while Chan is number one in Hong Kong, 
and Chen is most populous in Taiwan.
  Japanese surnames are usually poly-
syllabic — several syllables. Japan has 
more than 100,000 different surnames, but 
the most popular are Sato, Suzuki, and 
Takahashi, respectively.
  Prevalent Vietnamese names include 
Nguyen, Tran, and Vu. About half of all 
Vietnamese have the family name Nguyen 
(pronounced new-when).
  Korean names also tend to be monosyl-
labic. The most common family names are 
Kim, Lee, and Park, and the three combined 
account for about half of all Koreans.
  Among immigrants from India, most people 
have the name Patel meaning “land 
owner.” Asian Indian surnames are usually 
based on the region from which the person 
comes. Sikh men all use Singh as a suffix to 
their names, although some with this name 
are Hindu. Sikh women all use Kaur as a 
suffix to their names.
  Among Pakistanis, the name Khan is com-
monly adopted, because it means “lord.”
  Greek names often end in –os or –ou.

Asking your clients to pronounce 
their names
How many salespeople mispronounce a customer’s name over and over 
during a transaction? Every time they do, they push a dagger into the heart 
of their relationship just a bit deeper. To get a new customer’s name correct 
right from the start, take the following steps:
 
1. Ask your customer to write his name for you on a small notepad.
 
2. Ask him to say his name.
 
3. Repeat the name and ask whether you pronounced it properly.
 
4. Write down the pronunciation of his name phonetically next to or 
below his name in your notepad. (Don’t write anything on the person’s 
business card for the reasons given in Chapter 8.)
While this process may be embarrassing for a moment, getting the custom-
er’s name right will win you a lifetime of appreciation.
 
Share the correct spelling and pronunciation of customers’ names with every-
one in the company they’re going to meet. It would be a shame to go to all the 
embarrassment of learning the correct way to say your customers’ names only 
to have someone in finance, installation, or service get it wrong. Everyone on 
staff represents the company, and if they get the name wrong, the customer 
believes that you got it wrong. Distribute an e-mail message or typed memo 
to everyone who’s likely to be in contact with the customer, and make sure it 
includes the following:
(continued)
  Hispanic surnames are often derived from 
the father’s name, occupation, area of 
origin, or physical traits, such as Martinez 
(son of Martin), Rivera (near a river), and 
Moreno (blackberry, dark complexion). The 
two most popular Hispanic surnames in the 
U.S. are Garcia and Rodriguez.
  Most Italian names really do end in vowels, 
and particularly common are names that end 
with vowels enclosing double consonants 
like “–etto” (Anthony Benedetto was the 
original name of singer Tony Bennett).
Many names from these cultures can be very 
imposing for Americans; for example, Jawahar 
Swaminathan, who, we’re sure, you’re hoping 
will just let you call him “Joe.” Don’t despair, 
these names are very simple if you just break 
them around the vowels: Ja-wa-har Swa-min-
a-than.

 The correct spelling of the person’s first and last name
 
 The phonetic pronunciation of the customer’s names
 
 An indication of which is the first name and which is the surname 
(family name), as discussed in the following section
 
 The person’s gender (which may not be so obvious from the name)
 
Staff members often complain that they feel extremely frustrated and embar-
rassed when they call a customer and don’t know how to pronounce the per-
son’s name, or whether they’re asking to speak to a man or woman. It’s up to 
you to clue them in.
Distinguishing between first 
names and surnames
In some cultures, the family name (or surname) traditionally comes first. 
In fact, in ancient China, an emperor decreed that, by law, the family name 
would be placed first to stress the importance of family. You can probably 
imagine the confusion resulting from a name like Lee Wong Kong, especially if 
you’re trying to prepare contracts or loan documents. Is he (or she?) follow-
ing the ancient tradition of putting the family name first or the modern con-
vention of putting the family name last? Chinese, Koreans, and Vietnamese 
traditionally put their surnames first.
 
Unfortunately, if you ask an intelligent person who is not from this country, 
“What’s your last name?” they’re likely to tell you the name that comes last, 
which may or may not be their surname. To get the answer you’re looking for, 
phrase the question like this: “Which is your family name?” This takes some of 
the ambiguity out of the question.
To further complicate this already confusing issue, in many cultures people 
carry two surnames. Such is the practice among Hispanics — one surname 
comes from the father and the other from the mother’s side of the family. A 
married Hispanic woman often keeps both surnames, adding her husband’s. 
In general, only one of the names is used in casual conversation, but the full 
name comes out in business and other formal settings.
 
When meeting customers from Mexico or Latin America, be prepared to deal 
with a string of names. Many people from these cultures have a couple of 
given names (what Americans call first and middle names) along with two 
surnames, such as Juan Jose Martinez Santiago. The first surname (Martinez) 
comes from the father, while the second (Santiago) comes from the mother. 
The father’s family name is generally the official surname so you’d address the 
person as Mr., Mrs., or Ms. Martinez. If you’re not sure, just ask.

188
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Using the family name first
Americans tend to be relatively informal people who are quick to address 
one another by first name. Things have become so informal, in fact, that kids 
are often encouraged to address adults and even teachers by their first name, 
something that many baby boomers could never have imagined when they 
were growing up.
 
In business, the safest option is to start off by putting your formal foot for-
ward. Address everyone as “Mr.,” Mrs.,” “Ms.,” or their title such as “Doctor” 
or “Professor,” followed by their family name. Rank and title are especially 
important to new immigrants. Always address the oldest person in a group 
first, because age is likely to be highly respected.
Here are some tips on using family names for specific cultures:
 
 A formal greeting is especially crucial for African Americans, who 
want to be respected from the very first meeting. In fact, some have 
been so concerned about this in the past that they’ve given their chil-
dren first names like King, Queen, or Duke to command respect even 
when called by the given names.
 
 First names are rarely used in Asian cultures. In fact, addressing an 
older Asian by his or her first name could be viewed as highly insulting. 
This rule is particularly true for older Asian Indian women.
 
 The Japanese are especially formal people who almost never call one 
another by their given name, even if they’ve known one another for 
decades. Instead, they call each other by the last name with the suffix 
San — a respectful, gender-neutral title roughly equivalent to Mr., Mrs., 
or Ms. Thus, “Yamamoto San” might refer to any person with the sur-
name Yamamoto.
 
 Germans are very formal people who almost never use first names 
except among friends. German men and women greet one another with 
the words guten tag and shake hands while maintaining direct eye con-
tact. The handshake is generally very firm with only one “pump.”
 
 The French are fairly formal people and rarely use their first names 
except among friends. They greet each other with the word bonjour. 
Men shake hands when greeting one another while maintaining direct 
eye contact and they greet women with light kisses on the cheeks. 
Women also greet each other with kisses on the cheeks. The French 
handshake tends to be fairly soft with many gentle “pumps.”
 
Wait until the customer asks you to call him by his first name before you get 
too familiar.

for Buying Signals

B
efore you spend a lot of time giving your sales pitch, you want to make 
sure prospects are serious and qualified to buy. Then you want to know 
when they’re ready to buy.
Unfortunately, most customers never come right out and tell you when 
they’re ready to buy. Their signals tend to be much more subtle than that. 
In fact, they may not even be aware themselves that they’re ready to buy. 
They may start arguing with you less or arguing with you even more. They 
may start treating the product as if they already own it — sitting behind the 
wheel of the car or kicking back in the sectional sofa you just showed them. 
Perhaps they look to their partner for confirmation. Sound familiar?
As a salesperson, you’re probably already pretty adept at sensing when a 
client is ready to buy something. When you’re dealing with multicultural cli-
entele, however, the buying signals can often get crossed and may even lead 
you to react in a way that blows the sale.
In this chapter, we show you how to separate the lookers from the real 
buyers and describe the most common buying signals among customers 
from other cultures. Then we suggest ways to act and respond so you have a 
better chance to seal the deal.

Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Gauging a Customer’s Initial Interest
Retail salespeople are well aware of this age-old rule: When you look at cus-
tomers and they immediately look away, they probably don’t need or want 
assistance right now.
 
Unfortunately, this antiquated rule can cause you to lose sales with your new 
customers. As you find out in Chapter 8, direct eye contact is quite uncom-
fortable for people from certain cultures, so even if customers need assis-
tance, they’re likely to look away. The only way to know for sure if they need 
help is to ask them, “What can I help you find today?” This question serves 
three purposes:
 
 It encourages the customer to speak, which can give you an opening to 
ask more questions.
 
 It has a good chance of eliciting a positive response. The customer can’t 
give you a pat answer, such as “No, thanks. I’m just looking.”
 
 If you don’t have what the person is looking for, this question gives you 
the opportunity to find out what customers expect when they enter your 
store. Stocking up on what customers are looking for is usually a good 
idea, as we explain in Chapter 7.
 
Don’t ask the old “May I help you?” because this is likely to generate the usual 
response across all cultures: “No, thanks. I’m just looking.” If your store or 
business is located in the middle of a mall, perhaps your customers are just 
looking, but this is a dangerous assumption to make. It’s safer to assume that 
your customers paid a fortune in gas and hunted around for the perfect park-
ing spaces because they’re ready to buy something today and they’re having 
trouble finding it.
Are You Serious? Determining Whether a 
Customer Is Really Motivated to Buy
Not every customer you meet is ready, willing, and able to buy. Some may be 
window-shoppers or just dreamers. Others may consist of couples who are out 
on a cheap date or showed up for the free food or the raffle you advertised in 
the weekend paper. If you have any hopes of being a top producer, you must 
weed out the serious shopper from the looky-loos so you don’t waste enor-
mous amounts of time and energy on people who have no intention of buying 
something.
 
Regardless of culture, truly motivated customers exhibit the following three 
attributes:

191
 Chapter 10: Investigating Needs and Probing for Buying Signals
 
 They need to buy. How badly do they need to buy what you’re selling? 
Keep in mind that “need” is relative. A couple who just bought lake-
front property may not really need a boat, but they think they need a 
boat, and that’s what matters. Likewise, buying a new car every year or 
owning a Rolls Royce is a necessity for some people.
 
 They’re able to buy. Can the customers afford what you’re selling or at 
least afford to finance the purchase and make the payments? We assume 
you’re in sales for the long haul, and that means doing what’s best for 
your customers. Selling them a house, a car, or a timeshare that has 
them clipping coupons at the end of the month to make ends meet is 
not what’s best for your customers. They’ll remember if you do them 
a disservice, and they’ll never buy from you again. Moreover, they’ll 
bad-mouth you to everyone they know, leading to lost business. If the 
customer can’t afford what you’re selling, refer her to a more affordable 
alternative or even a competitor.
 
 They have a deadline to make the purchase. Most serious shoppers 
have a definite deadline by which they’re going to purchase. Without 
this target date in their crosshairs, they have no reason to stop shop-
ping for a better deal. Sometimes you can create a deadline for the cus-
tomer by pointing out the benefits, for example, of making the purchase 
by the end of the tax year or the beginning of the school year.
 
If customers aren’t serious, refer them to your best competition and move 
along to the next customer who’s sending strong buying signals. Customers 
who aren’t ready to buy carry a double whammy — not only are they highly 
unlikely to buy something, but they also keep you from selling to someone 
who wants to buy what you have to offer.
Separating Wants from Needs
If price were no object, everyone would take the top-of-the-line product or 
service you offer. In reality, people can afford different price ranges, and they 
really appreciate getting maximum value for what they pay. This is where 
separating wants from needs comes in.
There’s an old saying in sales that, “Buyers are liars.” In reality, the reason 
your prospects may tell you they want your product or service and then turn 
around and purchase something totally different is because salespeople are 
often lousy listeners. Customers may think they know what they want, but 
you have to pick up on the subtle signals they use to express what they really 
need, which is often quite different from what they tell you.
This form of confusion is particularly common among new immigrant con-
sumers, because they may not be used to the dazzling array of choices we 
often have in the United States. Walk into a cellular telephone store and 

192
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
imagine yourself coming from a country where phones are still black, feature 
a rotary dial, and are attached to the wall. You can see how your customer’s 
focus can become blurred.
To assist your customers in determining what they really want (and need), you 
need to ask more than you answer, listen more than you speak, and avoid any 
temptation to make assumptions, as discussed in the following sections.
 
What’s the best method for separating wants from needs? Ask questions if 
the person comes from a culture that’s more verbal; create a list if the person 
comes from a culture that’s more visual. (See Chapter 11 for information on 
determining the learning style of a particular culture.)
Warming up with a few questions
To identify your customers’ wants and needs, ask questions, as you do with 
any customer. Start with the basics as we explain earlier in this chapter, such 
as “What can I help you with today?” or “What problem can I help you solve?” 
The customers’ answers tell you what they think they want.
As soon as you know what they want, follow up with additional questions to 
determine what they really need. To do so, begin with questions such as the 
following:
 
 Have you bought one of these before? (Don’t assume. For example, in 
2006 enough cars were available for 84 percent of all Americans, driving 
age or not, whereas China had enough cars for fewer than 2 percent of 
its people.
 
 What was your experience with it?
 
 Have you used this service previously? (Again, don’t assume, especially 
in the case of new immigrants.)
 
 What was your experience?
 
 Who in your family would use this the most? (In collectivist cultures, the 
person buying the item may not be the main decision maker.)
 
 How would she use it?
 
 What’s your deadline for making a decision?
When you begin to ask more targeted questions to assess the customer’s needs 
and lead them through the purchase decision process, ask open-ended ques-
tions to get them talking, and then follow up with close-ended questions that 
help them narrow their choices. The more specific responses to close-ended 
questions help lead them into making a commitment. In the following sections, 
we cover open-ended and close-ended (yes/no) questions in greater detail.

193
 Chapter 10: Investigating Needs and Probing for Buying Signals
 
Unless you want a lot of returns and dissatisfied customers, you must uncover 
what the customer needs, so ask questions before you start trying to sell your 
products or services.
Asking open-ended questions
Open-ended questions probe the listener for an answer by asking why, how, or 
“Tell me about . . .”. They get the customer talking and give you an opportu-
nity to gather information, qualify sales opportunities, and build trust.
 
Asking a bunch of yes/no questions (close-ended questions; see the next sec-
tion) too soon not only shuts down the conversation with customers from 
other cultures, but it can also evoke some misleading responses. In many cul-
tures, for example, customers nod incessantly during a conversation, giving 
the impression that they’re agreeing with you when, in fact, they’re simply 
signaling that they hear you and are listening.
To determine the difference between agreement and mere acknowledgment, 
be proactive by asking open-ended questions. This gently forces the lis-
tener to answer your questions with more than a “yes,” “no,” or other short 
response. Here are some examples of open-ended questions:
 
 What do you think about this model?
 
 How do you feel this compares with the other one?
 
 What else would you use this for?
 
 If we added this accessory, how would it affect your decision?
Work it!
Most of your traditional customers are likely to 
have a firm grasp of what they’re looking for 
and can easily describe it to you. Customers 
from other cultures, however, especially those 
for whom English is a second language, may 
not be familiar with the products and services 
available in the United States and may be less 
able to express what they want in words.
In short, you’re going to give your multicultural 
clientele more assistance in selecting products 
and services. One of the best ways you can 
assist customers is by helping them distinguish 
between what they need and what they want 
so they can make a well-informed purchasing 
decision. This is especially important if you’re 
selling big-ticket items and need to put together 
a package that fits your customer’s budget.
In short, you need to “work it” — work harder 
to make a sale. Rest assured, however, that 
the more customers you close, the easier each 
subsequent transaction is going to become. 
As you build a reputation as the multicultural-
friendly merchant or service provider, you can 
expect to see a growing stream of more eager 
and trusting patrons.

194
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
 If we take this away, how would it affect your decision?
 
 How do you think this works?
 
 How did you . . .?
 
 How could you . . .?
 
 How else could you do that?
 
 What’s similar about these?
 
 In what ways are these different for you?
 
 What can you tell me about your needs?
 
 Tell me about what else you need.
 
 How do you think we could . . .?
 
Make sure your open-ended questions ask about matters of opinion rather 
than facts or knowledge so you don’t put your customer on the defensive. 
Questions should be about what the person thinks or feels — questions that 
have no right or wrong answer.
 
People from some cultures, such as Filipinos and folks from other highly 
educated countries, don’t particularly like to ask or be asked questions. 
Consequently, for them to ask too many questions may make them appear 
dumb. Therefore, you should check their understanding about loans, financial 
terms, or other issues by being a proactive listener and giving them an oppor-
tunity to offer you the information you need.
Asking close-ended questions
Close-ended questions usually start with verbs, such as “are,” “will,” “is,” 
“have,” and “did.” These types of questions are often called convergent ques-
tions because they’re designed to bring a conversation gradually to a deci-
sion point. The customer can answer these questions with a “yes,” “no,” an 
amount, such as price they would pay or how soon they want it delivered, or 
a similar short answer.
Smart salespeople ask open-ended questions to obtain information and then 
follow up with close-ended questions to close the deal. After they have dis-
covered their client’s needs, they narrow the choices by asking close-ended 
questions such as:
 
 Does this make sense to you, so far?
 
 Is this the sort of thing you’re looking for?
 
 Is this the model you want?
 
 What color would you prefer?
 
 Is there anything else you need to go with this?

195
 Chapter 10: Investigating Needs and Probing for Buying Signals
 
 Will you pay cash or use a credit card?
 
 Did you want to take it with you or would you prefer having it delivered?
Listing your client’s wants and needs
To assist customers in separating wants and needs, take out a blank sheet of 
paper and draw a vertical line right down the middle. Ask your client to list in 
the left column everything she wants from the product or service you offer. 
This becomes the client’s Wants list, so encourage her to dream.
For example, say you’re working with a couple who are in the market for a 
home. Here are some of the amenities they may list:
 
 4 bedrooms
 
 3 baths
 
 Family room
 
 Formal dining room
 
 Gourmet kitchen
 
 Fireplace
 
 Swimming pool
 
 Ocean view
 
 Walking distance to a highly rated elementary school
After your clients have completed their wish list, have them review the list 
and place a checkmark next to each item they consider a necessity. You can 
put it like this: “If I could find you the perfect home (or car or flat-screen TV 
or stereo system or whatever) but it didn’t have this item, would you still buy 
it?” If the person says no, then the item gets a checkmark.
They might say, for example, that they absolutely need a three-bedroom, two-
bath home with a formal dining room, kitchen, and family room, but the fire-
place, swimming pool, and ocean view are extras they could live without. Or, 
perhaps they could upgrade a basic kitchen to a gourmet kitchen later and 
could accept a home within a 15-minute drive to a good school.
Now on the right-hand side of your paper, copy all the items that have check-
marks next to them. This becomes your Needs list, which now looks some-
thing like this:
 
 3 bedrooms
 
 2 baths

196
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
 Family room
 
 Formal dining room
 
 Serviceable kitchen
 
 Driving distance to a highly rated elementary school
 
Notice that this is a very different house than the one described in the Wants 
list. As salespeople, we tend to do too much talking and not enough listening. 
By leading your customers through this exercise, you know which products or 
services to consider right from the start.
You should go through this process whether you’re selling microwaves, 
flat-screen televisions, cars, or anything else. This exercise not only tells the 
customer that you care about her but also helps her make a better decision. 
Demonstrating this level of concern is particularly important when dealing 
with people who may not be completely familiar with your product or service 
or the English language.
 
After you’ve separated your customer’s wants from her needs, determine 
how many of her needs your product or service can meet. Obviously, the 
more needs you can meet, the more motivated your customers will be to buy 
what you’re selling. If your products and services can meet few or none of 
her needs, you may have to refer her to a different supplier and move on to 
another customer.
Avoiding the temptation to assume
As you lead your clients through the process of creating their Wants and 
Needs lists, don’t let your own preferences or assumptions influence them. 
When I (Michael) ask most real estate agents whether a swimming pool is 
a want or need, for example, almost everyone responds immediately with 
“want.” Then I ask, “What if the client has a child with disabilities whose only 
form of physical exercise is swimming? Now is the same swimming pool a 
want or a need?” Of course, now everyone says, “Need.”
 
The only way you can know whether a particular item is a want or need for a 
particular customer is to ask the right question. As noted in the preceding sec-
tion, one of the most effective questions to separate wants from needs is, “If 
this had everything you wanted except this one item, would you still buy it?” If 
the answer is, “Yes, I’d buy it,” then the item is a want. If the answer is, “No, I 
couldn’t live without that,” then it’s a need.

197
 Chapter 10: Investigating Needs and Probing for Buying Signals
Detecting Obvious Buying Signals
You can usually tell when customers are ready to make a purchase decision 
by the questions they ask and the answers they give to your inquiries. Early 
in your sales presentation, they tend to ask general questions, if they ask 
any questions at all. They’re usually too busy answering your questions at 
this stage to ask their own questions. At this point, you’re merely gathering 
information about your customers to assess their needs and figure out which 
products and services would be most suitable. (See Chapter 11 for more 
about giving your sales presentation.)
After you present your product(s) or service(s), it’s your customer’s turn to 
ask questions. If the person isn’t interested, he’s likely to ask few questions 
or begin looking for the exits. Serious buyers start asking discerning ques-
tions about your product or service or about you or your company — for 
example, whether the product is offered in different colors or whether it 
includes a warranty.
In the following sections, we reveal the types of questions customers are 
likely to ask after your sales presentation and provide strategies for fielding 
these questions without losing your composure.
Fielding questions from low- 
and high-context buyers
Multicultural customers who are interested in making a purchase usually ask 
at least a few questions, but these questions are often much different from 
the questions you’re probably accustomed to answering. If you don’t know 
what to expect, you may be taken off guard or misinterpret a customer’s 
question as a sign that they’re not really interested.
Questions generally differ depending on whether your customer has been raised 
in a low- or high-context culture (see Chapters 3 and 9 for more about these 
types of cultures). In the following sections, we point out the most common 
differences and give some examples of the questions you’re likely to encounter.
Low-context buyers
Customers from low-context cultures tend to care more about the deal than 
about you, your company, or any other peripheral matters. They’re buying a 
product or service and they want to know all about it, how much it’s going to 
cost, their options for making payments, and how and when they can expect 
delivery.

198
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
Normally, you’ll know that low-context customers, including Caucasians and 
African Americans, are ready to buy when they ask questions such as:
 
 Does this come in any other styles or colors?
 
 How much extra do you charge for . . .?
 
 For how long would I normally need your services?
 
 Is financing available?
 
 What kind of discount is available?
 
 When can we start (or take delivery)?
 
 Is a warranty or guarantee available?
 
 Can I exchange this for something else later?
High-context buyers
Before customers from high-context cultures can feel comfortable buying 
from you, they typically need to know that they can trust you and the com-
pany you represent. They’re probably going to be less concerned about 
details concerning the product and the deal itself and more concerned about 
you, your company, your family, and your commitment to their family and 
community.
 
People from high-context cultures, including Hispanics, Middle Easterners, 
and most Asians, are more likely to ask questions such as these:
 
 How long have you worked here?
 
 Do you have any children?
 
 Are you married?
 
 Who owns this store?
 
 How long has this company been in business?
 
 Have you solved problems like the one I’m currently experiencing?
 
Some of these questions may seem intrusive and overly personal, but people 
from high-context cultures want to build a relationship with you and your 
company. They’re concerned not only about this deal but also want to know 
that they can count on you in the future. They’re planning to do business with 
whomever they buy from for a long period of time. These questions tell you 
that they’re interested in getting to know you better and move ahead with a 
purchase. Notice that they are less concerned about warranties or guarantees 
because their trust in you is all the protection they need.

 Chapter 10: Investigating Needs and Probing for Buying Signals
Answering the same question 
over and over again
Multicultural customers, whether they come from low- or high-context back-
grounds, often ask the same question over and over again. Rarely is this a sign 
that they’re not paying attention or that they can’t understand what you’re 
saying. More likely, they’re testing to see whether you’re going to change your 
answer. They want to know whether you waffle or are a straight shooter.
 
You can reword your answer slightly, but remain consistent. If you change 
answers, you’ll come across as someone who can’t be trusted. You can relax 
when answering, however, because when your customers are asking the same 
question, perhaps adjusting the wording only slightly, they’re giving you a 
clear sign that they’re interested in buying whatever you’re selling.
Dealing with scary questions without 
losing your composure
Customers from diverse cultures can often ask some of the scariest ques-
tions. Real estate agents, for example, can go into shock when clients of 
different ethnicities ask a question like, “Do other people like us live here?” 
With that simple question the clients call attention to the fact that they’re 
different — a topic that the agent was probably trying to avoid at all costs. 
Even worse, agents are so afraid of violating fair housing laws that they can’t 
even think of a safe answer to give.
While all of this confusion is swirling around in the agent’s mind, he usually 
overlooks the fact that this question is a huge buying sign. Why would poten-
tial home buyers ask about the composition of the neighborhood unless 
they’re thinking about buying a home there? They want to buy. They want 
to live there. Just one little thing could perhaps get in the way — they don’t 
want to be the only family of a particular ethnicity on the block. They don’t 
want to be the targets of discrimination.
In retail settings, a multicultural customer may ask if you see many people 
from their culture or country buying your product. It’s usually asked in a 
lighthearted manner, but don’t be fooled — they’re deadly serious.
For service providers, a minority prospect may ask a hair stylist, for instance, 
if she cuts African American hair, or ask you whether you have many Asian or 
Hispanic clients. The prospective customer may even go to the trouble of sit-
ting outside your place of business to observe the ethnicities of people who 
go in and out.

200
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
When customers start asking direct and very specific questions, they’re 
sending signals that they’re ready to buy, even if the questions frighten you. 
Realize that these questions need to be answered, but you don’t have to be the 
one answering them. Point your clients to appropriate sources to answer their 
questions, such as the chamber of commerce or the reference desk at the 
local library, and then get them to make the purchase! Otherwise, you’re going 
to be so preoccupied with the questions that you’re going to forget to ask for 
the order.
Tuning In to Subtle Buying Signals
You’ve probably been trained to look for nonverbal buying signs. Increased 
enthusiasm and a less defensive posture (uncrossing arms and legs, 
increased eye contact) are usually dead giveaways that a customer is ready 
to buy. Unfortunately, customers from other cultures may exhibit few if any 
of the traditional buying signs you expect to see. Asians, for example, are 
notorious for remaining completely poker faced, even when shopping for big-
ticket items, such as cars and houses.
Fearful of appearing ignorant, many multicultural customers won’t even ask 
questions. Careful not to disturb the good energy around them, they hide their 
emotions. Even more intimidating, your customers may wander off to a quiet 
corner and start discussing the deal among themselves in their native tongue.
How can you possibly spot a buying signal when your customers don’t 
appear to be giving off any signals? The truth is that customers from every 
culture express their intent to make a purchase. It’s just that some express 
their intent more subtly than others. In the following sections, we encourage 
you to avoid drawing hasty conclusions and show you what to look for so 
you can become more sensitive to these subtle cues.
Shedding the false assumption that multi-
cultural customers are “looky-loos”
Real estate professionals have a special name for people who drop by open 
houses on Sunday afternoons with no intention of buying. We call them looky-
loos — perennial shoppers. Sometimes they want to see how the neighbors 
decorate their house, find out how much a home like theirs is selling for, or 
see what it feels like to be inside a $10 million mansion. They have no plans 
to buy or sell in the near future. They’re just killing time — theirs and yours. 
In fact, the higher the price or more unique your product or service is, the 
more looky-loos you’re likely to attract. This is why million-dollar homes are 
usually available to tour by appointment only.

201
 Chapter 10: Investigating Needs and Probing for Buying Signals
In other industries, many salespeople see customers from other cultures visit 
their place of business over and over without buying anything. For instance, 
in car sales these people are called “tire kickers.” It’s easy to jump to the 
conclusion that these customers are also looky-loos, but nothing could be 
further from the truth. Multicultural buyers don’t have time to waste window-
shopping or visiting your store or office just to pick your brain. These folks 
commonly work 60 to 80 hours a week and often feel guilty about not being 
able to spend enough time with their families. When people from diverse cul-
tures repeatedly visit without buying, it’s not only a definite buying sign but 
a warning sign as well. The warning is that if you don’t figure out how to sell 
something to them, you’re going to lose an excellent prospect.
 
If culturally diverse shoppers repeatedly visit your establishment, they want 
to do business with you. If they leave empty-handed, you’re probably not 
doing something to make them feel comfortable enough to buy, or you’re not 
offering the products or services they’re looking for (or making them easy 
enough to find).
 
Talk to your advisory board members, as explained in Chapter 2, about this 
situation and see what they suggest. You may ask a few of them to come in 
and act as customers to see why multicultural customers are shopping but not 
buying. When customers visit again and again, they’re signaling a willingness 
to buy. You must close the sale, as discussed in Chapter 12.
Giving your clients the okay to 
speak their own language
Ask any sales professional about the one thing that new immigrant customers 
do that really makes them mad, and they’ll tell you it’s when they go off in a 
corner and speak to one another in their own language. Most of us think that 
this kind of behavior is just plain rude, or we assume that our customers are 
talking about us.
Nothing could be further from the truth. What’s really occurring is that the 
customers are becoming emotionally involved in the purchase decision, and 
all salespeople know that emotions sell — people buy on emotion and justify 
with reason. Most people who speak a second language can reason in that 
language and deal with facts and figures, but when it comes to expressing 
emotion, they tend to shift to their native tongue. When discussing complex 
or emotional issues, it’s natural for a person to revert to the language that he 
grew up speaking rather than the one he learned in a class.
You may not consider wandering to a distant corner to speak in a foreign lan-
guage as being a subtle signal that your customer is ready to buy; we include 
it here because it’s a strong buying signal that most salespeople never 
pick up on. In the following sections, we provide some explanation for this 
common phenomenon and show you how to use it to your advantage.

Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Grasping the concept of code switching
Many bilingual people engage in code switching — changing between their 
native tongue and English without even being aware that they’re doing this. 
This sometimes gives rise to a third language, which is a combination of their 
mother tongue and English. People who are bilingual in Spanish and English 
often jokingly refer to their third language as Spanglish, while Hawaiians call 
theirs Pidgin. Filipinos who speak Tagalog call their combination Taglish, and 
there are others around the world.
 
Sometime bilingual people deliberately use their mastery of two languages to 
gain some privacy. Although this may seem somewhat deceptive, it’s actually 
a positive sign. Think about the kinds of issues customers may want to talk 
about in private such as, “Do you think we can afford this?” and “Do you think 
they might take less than the retail price?” The problem is that the salesper-
son won’t leave them alone, so they have to resort to speaking a language they 
know she won’t understand. Recognize that this is still a buying sign.
Providing some space
It’s important to let customers know that they’re free to speak to one another 
in their own language without offending you. As soon as your customers 
know that you’re okay with it, you and they will be able to communicate 
more openly with each other. Your customers are going to breathe a big sigh 
of relief, too — having to constantly speak in a foreign language, particularly 
English, can be very stressful.
As an added bonus, you’ll find that your customers are better able to frame 
their questions when they can figure out what they want to ask in their own 
language before translating it into your language.
 
Give customers some space when they start speaking a language you don’t 
understand by making an excuse to leave the room. This enables them to talk 
freely without worrying about offending you. Studies show that the longer cus-
tomers discuss a purchase, the more likely they are to buy it.
Dropping your defenses
Becoming defensive when customers start speaking their own language is 
perfectly natural, but it can sink your chances of closing the sale. You could 
make false assumptions that the customers aren’t interested. You may 
become a little self-conscious or standoffish without realizing it.
 
Instead of feeling suspicious or offended when customers start speaking to 
one another in their native language, celebrate the fact that your customers 
are ready to buy — this is a huge buying sign. After all, why would people talk, 
in any language, about a product or service they’re not interested in buying? 
If they were truly not interested, they’d simply leave. When your customers 
start talking among themselves in their language, be prepared to close. (Flip to 
Chapter 12 for more on closing sales with multicultural customers.)

203
 Chapter 10: Investigating Needs and Probing for Buying Signals
Dealing Effectively with Group Dynamics
People in individualistic cultures, such as the United States, tend to be lone rang-
ers when making purchase decisions. We don’t generally consult with Grandpa 
or Auntie Ann when we get ready to purchase a washer and dryer or even a car. 
The closest we come to group purchases is when a couple buys a home.
So when an entire family arrives to test-drive a car and everyone and their 
uncle seems to be involved in the purchase decision, most salespeople get a 
little shaken. They can’t begin to guess which person is the decision maker or 
to whom they should be talking.
Rarely do customers from collectivist cultures (such as those in Asia, Latin 
America, the Middle East, and India) make the final decision for a major pur-
chase alone. They usually bring along a spouse or significant other as well 
as other family members, including parents, grandparents, children, aunts, 
uncles, cousins, and even friends, for emotional and sometimes financial sup-
port. This is especially true when they’re buying big-ticket items. So when 
multicultural buyers bring a group of people, it’s a definite buying sign.
 
The general rule of thumb for these buyers is that the larger the purchase 
price, the more people who will be involved in the decision.
In the following sections, we show you what to expect so you won’t be 
thrown for a loop, and then we give you clues to look for to identify the deci-
sion maker. Finally, we remind you (yes, again) not to oversell.
Becoming comfortable with groups
Perhaps the biggest change you need to make when dealing with groups is a 
change in attitude. When you’re accustomed to selling to one or two people, 
selling to a group can be a culture shock, and if you feel unsettled, your cus-
tomers can certainly tell.
 
When multicultural customers arrive en masse, don’t jump to the conclusion 
that they’re ganging up on you. The fact that so many people have gathered 
is a great buying sign. Your customer would never have gone to the trouble of 
organizing such a field trip if she wasn’t serious about making a purchase. No 
one wants to be embarrassed in front of her peers by walking away without 
whatever it is she came for. Instead of being intimidated by a group of people, 
be thankful!

204
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
Simply being aware that group shopping trips are standard operating proce-
dure in some cultures can make you a little more comfortable with selling to 
groups. Greeting everyone in the group, as suggested in Chapter 8, is another 
way to put everyone, including yourself, at ease. You’ll then know everyone in 
the group and have an idea of how they’re all related. In the following section, 
we show you how to figure out who’s really in charge of the decision, which is 
probably your biggest concern when dealing with more than one buyer.
Identifying the decision maker
When hoards of buyers descend on you, your first question is often “Who’s 
the decision maker?” and it can be difficult to answer. You want to pitch your 
product to the person or people who are most likely responsible for giving 
the thumbs up or thumbs down. With most of your customers, you can safely 
assume that the decision maker is the person who’s going to be using the 
product or service the most or the person who’s paying for it. When you’re 
selling to a group from a collectivist culture, however, these assumptions can 
be totally wrong.
 
The best approach to discovering who’s the decision maker is based on the 
advice we offer throughout this book — stop assuming and let the customer 
give you the necessary information. To identify the decision maker, ask the 
group a closing question early in your presentation and watch how everyone 
reacts (this works in all cultures).
If you’re selling a home, for example, you can ask, “When would you like to 
move in?” If you’re selling a car, you may ask, “What color would you prefer?” 
You can ask a jewelry customer, “Would you prefer silver or platinum?” Ask 
the question and then remain silent.
Initially, everyone in the group is going to look at one another, but then all 
eyes will turn toward the decision maker to deliver the answer. The person 
everyone is looking at is your decision maker. If you can successfully sell her, 
the deal’s in the bag.

 Formulating some creative financing options
M
ediocre salespeople think that selling is a universal language in itself. 
They believe you can apply the same sales techniques and be equally 
effective no matter where you’re selling and to whom. In fact, you’ll often 
hear them boast, “I just treat everyone the same.”
Top salespeople know that this is simply not true. Just as you may need to 
adjust your approach because of a customer’s age or gender, you also have 
to adjust for cultural differences, and the more complex the relationship, the 
greater the adjustments you need to make. In this chapter, we explain why 
adapting your sales presentation is so important and then reveal several 
ways you can change your sales presentation and techniques to make your 
products, your services, and yourself more appealing to clients from other 
cultures.
 
You don’t need to scrap your entire sales presentation and start all over. You 
just have to tweak it a bit so customers with different cultural backgrounds 
can relate better to it. You also need to consider the differences in generations 
and levels of acculturation, as discussed in Chapter 9.

206
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Setting the Stage for Change
If you want more business from people from diverse cultures, you must cus-
tomize your sales presentation to meet their unique needs. You can’t take a 
system that’s been effective in selling to your established clientele, no matter 
their ethnicity, and expect to use it with other cultures — it just won’t work, 
particularly if your sales approach focuses too much on razzle-dazzle and not 
enough on the fundamentals.
In the following sections, we help you refocus your efforts on becoming a genu-
ine salesperson — one who is customer focused rather than profit oriented.
Credibility sells
Customers buy from people they trust. This is true no matter what you’re 
selling or to whom, but it’s even more important when selling to people from 
other cultures. To foster this trust, adhere to the following guidelines:
 
 You know everything there is to know about the products and 
services you’re selling. See the later section, “Establishing yourself 
as the expert,” for more on this idea.
 
 You believe in what you’re selling. Most customers can pick up on the 
subtext of a sales presentation that merely pitches a product to earn a 
buck. If you don’t believe in what you’re selling, sell something else.
 
 Your message is consistent. Any inconsistency is likely to be inter-
preted as a lie and kill the sale. Moreover, customers need to hear 
the same message not only from you, but also from everyone else in 
your company.
For more about how to become a more credible source of information, prod-
ucts, and services, skip ahead to “Boosting Your Street Cred,” later in this 
chapter.
 
American consumers in general mistrust salespeople because of the misdeeds 
performed by a few who never should have gotten into the profession. Imagine 
how much more hesitant a consumer from another country may be to make a 
purchase because of their lack of familiarity with American contracts, financ-
ing, laws, and other aspects of the sale.

207
 Chapter 11: Adapting Your Sales Presentation and Techniques
Sales awards don’t matter
Most salespeople in the United States proudly display sales awards on 
their office walls to demonstrate their success and expertise. If you want to 
build credibility with people from diverse cultures, put away the awards. 
Customers from other cultures, as well as many natural-born Americans, 
put little stock in your sales volume. They don’t care how many sales you’ve 
done; they just care about one — theirs.
 
Replace your sales awards with diplomas and certifications and photographs 
of your spouse, your children, and your friends. People from other cultures 
generally care more about your family and your education than the number of 
deals you’ve made.
Don’t sell — educate
Consumers are much more savvy these days, so gimmicks and slick sales 
pitches rarely work. Regardless of culture, customers usually need two 
things:
 
 They need to feel as though they’re working with someone they can 
trust.
 
 They need to feel as though they understand the product or service and 
the deal they’re getting themselves into. In other words, they need you 
to educate them.
Making a case for change
Salespeople often ask, “Do all sales presenta-
tions need to be customized?” Our answer is 
this: “Only if you want people to buy from you.” 
Attendees at our seminars often cite simple 
order-taking transactions, such as buying a pair 
of socks at a department store, as an example. 
“Why should a clerk care about someone’s 
culture when all they have to do is collect the 
money and make change?”
We always respond by saying, “You can buy a 
pair of socks at a drug store or at Nordstrom’s, 
but which sale has the higher profit margin and 
better rate of return?”
Yes, the less complex the transaction, the less 
you need to be culturally competent. However, 
if you want to build a long-term relationship 
and repeat business, you must provide value by 
educating your customers, and that takes time.

208
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
The secret to making a sale is no secret, especially for new immigrants. 
They’re even more likely than the general population to be unfamiliar with 
your products and services, so take them slowly through every step of the 
process. Studies show that the more knowledgeable a customer is about a 
product or service, the more they trust their salesperson.
Here’s a typical example: Many people could never hope to own a home in 
their country of origin, but in the United States, the dream of homeownership 
is well within their reach. Obtaining loan approval may not be an obstacle 
for them. What’s more likely to stand in their way is a lack of understanding 
of American construction techniques, contracts, escrows, and mortgages. 
Bring them up to speed on these concepts, and you can watch their trust and 
appreciation grow. (For more about educating your customers, check out 
“Getting up to speed on the four learning styles,” later in this chapter.)
Brushing Up on Cross-Cultural 
Communication Styles
Although language is certainly the biggest barrier to clear communication, 
other barriers exist in how people of different cultures receive and pro  cess 
information and express their thoughts. So even if your multicultural 
customers speak English, you still may need to make some adjustments 
for differences in communication styles.
In the following sections, we provide brief descriptions of the different 
communication and learning styles, show you how to overcome these 
differences, and offer a couple of exercises for honing your skills.
Sizing up the differences between direct 
and indirect communicators
You already have some no-nonsense customers — people who get right to 
the point and always speak their mind. These are your direct communicators. 
At the other extreme are customers who are so afraid of disappointing you 
that they do everything possible to avoid conflict — perhaps even giving you 
mixed signals rather than saying no. These are your indirect communicators. 
Most people fall somewhere in between — using one communication style or 
the other depending on the situation — but they tend to show a preference 
for direct or indirect communications.

209
 Chapter 11: Adapting Your Sales Presentation and Techniques
People from direct cultures tend to believe that speaking one’s mind and 
being straightforward conveys honesty and integrity, whereas those from 
indirect cultures may interpret this approach as being rude or confronta-
tional. They prefer avoiding conflict and are careful not to hurt another’s 
feelings. People from direct cultures may perceive this as being wishy-washy 
and a waste of their time.
Everyone’s different, and each situation is unique, but the following sections 
describe tendencies in various cultures that can help you adapt more quickly 
to a certain culture’s preference.
Identifying direct communication cultures
Plenty of people in the United States prefer a direct approach. You can also 
find them in England, Germany, Israel, and Scandinavia — other low-context 
cultures (see Chapter 3 for details about low- and high-context cultures). In 
these countries, you commonly hear expressions such as “Don’t beat around 
the bush,” “Get to the point,” and “First things first.” Established American 
salespeople and business owners already know how to do business with 
direct communicators because it’s the preferred style here.
 
Direct cultures rely on the literal and precise meaning of the words they use. 
They prefer explicit conversations where words convey most or all of the 
message. People with this preference prefer written communication because 
they don’t need or appreciate the subtleties of nonverbal communication. 
They tend to deal with conflict head-on and trust that further discussion 
will resolve any conflict. Direct communicators believe that the best way to 
reduce tension is to say what needs to be said now rather than later.
Identifying indirect communication cultures
High-context cultures such as those in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, 
Africa, or South Europe value a more indirect communication style. They 
combine verbal and nonverbal messages to convey meaning. Listeners need 
to read between the lines and pick up on nonverbal nuances — what we in 
the United States may refer to as “dropping a hint.”
This is not to say that Americans never engage in indirect communications. 
For instance, when a woman here asks her significant other whether he’d 
like to watch the movie Sex in the City with her for the 15th time, her partner 
would be wise to be very indirect with his answer. In business, however, a 
direct approach is almost always preferred in the U.S.
 
In high-context cultures (in which indirect communication is preferred), much 
of the meaning comes from what isn’t said. Keep reading to find out how to 
determine the meaning of nonverbal cues.

210
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Tuning in to contextual clues
When conversing with individuals from high-context cultures, be aware not 
only of the text (what they say) but also the context (how they say it, who’s 
saying it, where you are, what’s currently happening, everything that hap-
pened up to this point, and what’s likely to happen next). Be prepared to 
make the following adjustments:
 
 Listen closely to both what the person says and how she says it. Tune 
in to the feelings behind the words.
 
 Note who’s talking. The status of the person who’s talking (boss 
versus subordinate, for example) and your status can heavily influence 
the meaning and significance of the words. High-context people may 
respond differently to a manager than to a salesperson who says the 
same thing.
 
 Observe the person’s body language carefully and try to pick up on 
gestures and nonverbal signals. If a customer appears to be listening 
to you but has a frown or questioning look on her face, it may mean she 
disagrees with you or doesn’t understand what you’re saying. (Flip 
to Chapter 8 for more information on interpreting gestures and body 
language.)
 
 Become as familiar as possible with the customers’ culture. This 
allows you to be sensitive to how the physical setting, relational cues, 
or shared understandings affect meaning. (Chapter 4 provides tips on 
developing cross-cultural competency.)
 
 Look for hidden meanings in comparisons or analogies. People from 
high-context cultures often use analogies to discuss an issue without 
directly referring to the actual parties or situation. This is like a patient 
in a psychiatrist’s office who says, “I have a friend . . .” when she’s really 
talking about herself.
 
 Lean toward saying less. Less is said, more is implied in high-context 
cultures. See the section “Leveraging the power of silence,” later in this 
chapter for details.
 
 Avoid conflict. In a culture that communicates indirectly, mentioning a 
sensitive issue or directly disagreeing with another person is considered 
insensitive and insulting. Your goal is to maintain harmony with your 
customers. If your customer disagrees with you, she’ll tend to handle it 
in a way to cause the least tension and avoid embarrassment to others.
 
Become an active listener, listening with your ears, eyes, and mind. Focus not 
only on the text, but also the context, emotions, and gestures.

211
 Chapter 11: Adapting Your Sales Presentation and Techniques
Practicing how to find the meaning in what isn’t said
You probably have well-honed indirect communications skills when it comes 
to dealing with an intimate romantic partner, close family members, or best 
friends. You communicate more nonverbally than you probably realize 
because you’re so “in tune” with the other person.
The challenge is to achieve this high level of intuitive interplay with total 
strangers. You must be able to make accurate inferences from clues that your 
customers provide. This game can drive uninitiated Americans crazy.
 
To improve your indirect communications skills, practice the following 
exercise with a partner:
 
1. Write the names of famous Americans of different nationalities on small 
pieces of paper.
 
2. Tape one of the names on your partner’s forehead so you can see the 
name, but she can’t.
 
3. Have your partner tape one of the names on your forehead so your 
partner can see the name but you can’t.
 
4. Have your partner try to guess the name taped to her forehead by 
asking you a series of yes/no questions about the person, such as “Am 
I a woman?” “Am I alive today?” “Am I a politician?” and so on. (Your 
partner can keep asking questions as long as you keep answering yes. 
If she guesses incorrectly, then it’s your turn to ask a question.)
The person who successfully guesses the name on his or her own forehead 
first wins.
What you discover from this exercise is that you can deduce a great deal of 
information merely by asking questions and then following the contextual 
clues to the correct answer. This is very similar to how people in indirect 
cultures communicate on a daily basis, except they require far fewer ques-
tions because they already have a shared knowledge of many of the answers. 
It would be like starting the game knowing that all of the names will be of 
famous Black women who are alive today. This sure makes the answers 
easier to guess, but now the game isn’t as much fun.
Reading your cross-cultural customers’ nonverbal cues
If you’ve been in sales for a while, you’ve probably attended a seminar or 
read up on nonverbal communication. You’re already well aware that you 
communicate a great deal with customers nonverbally through gestures, 
body language, posture, facial expressions, and eye contact or lack thereof.

212
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
When communicating with multicultural customers, the nonverbal cues 
you’ve used for years can convey quite different meanings than you intend. 
Here are just a few of differences and similarities:
 
 When most of your American customers cross their arms during a sales 
presentation, they’re often on the defensive or disagreeing with what 
you’re saying. When multicultural buyers cross their arms, they’re usu-
ally just assuming a comfortable posture; don’t read too much into it 
unless you’re picking up some other negative vibes as well.
 
 Placing a hand over the mouth in the United States usually is a sign that 
a patron is doubtful or unsure of what they’re hearing. This is generally 
similar in other cultures.
 
 When American customers lean closer to you, they’re usually showing 
that they agree with or accept what you’re saying. Some cultures, how-
ever, are much more formal than Americans and may not close the per-
sonal space for any reason, even if they agree.
 
 When most U.S. customers laugh nervously, they’re usually avoiding 
the truth. In other cultures, nervous laughter usually indicates that the 
buyer is embarrassed or unsure about a decision; it may have nothing to 
do with being insincere.
 
 Direct eye contact is generally interpreted as a sign of honesty in the 
U.S., while averted eyes indicate lying or disinterest. In many cultures, 
however, looking away is simply a sign of respect and has nothing to do 
with whether the client is avoiding you or lying to you.
 
 Almost universally, customers’ pupils expand when they hear something 
they like and contract when they hear something they don’t like.
 
 Nodding in the United States usually conveys agreement. In many other 
cultures, however, nodding simply shows that the customer is paying 
attention.
 
 When customers in the U.S. wince uncontrollably at a proposal, this usu-
ally means they’re shocked or dismayed. As we point out in Chapter 13, 
however, flinches from new immigrants are rarely uncontrolled or unin-
tended and are an integral part of their negotiating technique.
Getting up to speed on 
the four learning styles
Every salesperson has a little teacher in them, and that includes you. You 
have to teach your customers about your products and services, of course, 
but you may also need to educate them about contracts, financing, payment 
plans, warranties, and other components of the purchase process. With 
multicultural customers, many of whom may be completely unaware of how 
things work in the United States, education becomes an even more crucial 

213
 Chapter 11: Adapting Your Sales Presentation and Techniques
aspect of making a sale and winning a customer for life. Sharing information 
builds trust and confidence in your abilities, knowledge, and motives. An 
educated customer is an appreciative customer.
To be an effective educator, recognize that not everyone learns the same way, 
and culture can affect the way people absorb information. People from some 
cultures are more adept at processing verbal descriptions and instructions, 
for example, whereas others gain a deeper understanding through visuals.
In the following sections, we introduce you to the four learning styles and 
provide guidance on how to develop a sales presentation that’s effective for 
people who favor different learning styles.
Auditory-verbal
In the United States, most sales presentations are delivered verbally — the 
salesperson talks to the customer, and the customers listens passively 
(hence the term auditory-verbal). This is fine for people who’ve been raised in 
an education system where this is the norm — typically low-context cultures, 
including the United States, Canada, and most of Western Europe. However, 
studies show that only 30 percent of all audiences favor the auditory-verbal 
learning style, which leaves 70 percent who prefer obtaining information 
through other methods.
Kinesthetic (hands-on)
Experiential education (also called kinesthetic learning) is becoming more and 
more popular in the United States and for good reason — about 30 percent of 
people learn best by doing. Customers can also be hands-on learners. They 
may not completely grasp the benefits of your product or service until they 
try it for themselves.
 
Research shows that Hispanics tend to be highly kinesthetic and visual-
nonverbal learners (see the upcoming section). According to at least one 
study, Hispanics tend to prefer hands-on learning in structured group activi-
ties and the use of drawings and illustrations over listening or reading.
Visual-verbal
Visual-verbal learners, who make up about 20 percent of the population, need 
to see everything in black and white or, preferably, in color. Instead of listen-
ing to you drone on and on about your product, they’d rather read about it 
themselves in brochures, manuals, and white papers. People in Australia are 
very visual-verbal.
Visual-nonverbal
The final 20 percent of people are visual-nonverbal learners who learn best 
when information is presented in a graphical format, such as charts, graphs, 
photos, illustrations, and videos. They love diagrams and can assemble 
almost anything by just referring to the picture on the front of the box.

214
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
Asians tend to be much more visual-nonverbal because many of the Asian 
languages are based on pictures. According to a 1991 study that focused on 
the relationship between international college students’ learning styles and 
their academic achievement, “They (Asians) tend not to perform well when 
the primary mode of instruction is verbal.” Anyone who’s sold products or 
services in Asia knows that salespeople have to change to a much more visual 
mode of presentation when selling in this part of the world.
Developing a presentation that reaches everyone
To connect with people who have different preferred modes of learning, the 
best option is to create one sales presentation that accommodates all four 
learning styles — a multimodal presentation. In my (Michael’s) sales consult-
ing work, I help salespeople integrate hands-on demonstrations into their 
standard verbal presentation, along with written explanations and graphic 
material. This way you don’t have to worry about which learning style a 
customer prefers because you have them all covered.
 
With a multimodal presentation, you may verbally describe a product as you 
show it or show pictures of it. You can provide handouts or brochures so cus-
tomers who are more visual-verbal can follow along in the text. You may also 
include a multimedia presentation complete with plenty of photos, charts, and 
even video to accommodate visual-nonverbal members of the audience. And 
for your kinesthetic learners, you can include a hands-on demonstration.
Which learning style are you?
Although we all employ a combination of learn-
ing styles, most of us tend to prefer one over the 
others. For instance:
  If you love listening to lectures or books on 
CD, you’re probably auditory-verbal.
  If you’d rather try out a product before 
hearing or reading anything about it, you’re 
likely more kinesthetic.
  If you love reading for pleasure, it’s almost 
a sure bet that you’re a visual-verbal 
learner.
  If you’re a proficient map reader, you prob-
ably prefer visual-nonverbal information.
If you would like a more complete analysis of 
your learning style, visit www.metamath.
com/lsweb/dvclearn.htm.
Problems arise when you assume that every-
one prefers and learns more effectively by 
employing the learning style that’s most effec-
tive for you. Your sales presentation is going to 
be much more effective when you realize that 
different people have different learning styles 
and you can identify which style is best for the 
customer you’re currently serving.

215
 Chapter 11: Adapting Your Sales Presentation and Techniques
As you can imagine, this makes for a much more interesting and engaging 
sales program for your customers, while keeping yourself more involved.
Leveraging the power of silence
 
When a conversation lags, most people in the United States feel the need to fill 
the empty space with idle chitchat. While Americans are generally uncomfort-
able with the silent pause, most other cultures are not. Here are a few examples:
 
 Asians in general and the Japanese in particular are especially fond of 
silence. Barging into that empty space suggests to them that you’re not 
a very deep thinker or you’re attempting to hide something from them 
with mindless chatter.
 
 Silence plays an important part in communication with Asian Indians. 
Hindus believe that wisdom and peace come from communion with 
yourself in silence, such as that which is found in meditation. Successful 
relations with clients from this culture require that you also become 
comfortable with silence.
 
 Native Americans tend to believe that talk is cheap. After years of being 
betrayed by fast-talking European explorers, settlers, and politicians, 
many believe that silence protects them from people they don’t know. 
As a result, these once trusting and open people have become defensive, 
cynical, and aloof. Today, casual talk in their community is reserved for 
more established, intimate relationships.
 
Becoming more comfortable with silence usually requires a little practice. The 
next time you’re driving alone, try turning off the radio. If you’re part of a sales 
team, schedule an occasional lunch for practicing your ability to speak less. You 
may even have a contest in which the person who talks the most has to pick up 
the tab. Who knows? You may prefer living with a little less chatter and clatter.
On the other hand, some cultures tend to be more boisterous than others. 
People from Arabic countries, for example, often exaggerate to strengthen 
and emphasize their points. Instead of stating a simple “no,” an Arab may 
declare, “I swear by God, no!” Some cultures may consider this to be taking 
God’s name in vain, but to most Arabs, this combines a strong statement 
of position with a declaration of faith. Loudness indicates strength in Arabic 
cultures, while softness conveys weakness.
Greeks also can be quite emotional in conversation, to a point where outsiders 
may perceive it to be a heated argument. For Greeks, an outward show of feel-
ings is seen as positive and implies that the participants are engaged in the dis-
cussion. The time to be concerned about Greek customers is when they’re quiet!

Pitching the benefits, not just the features
As a salesperson, you’re probably already well aware of the difference 
between features and benefits, but here’s a brief refresher just in case you 
need one:
 
 Features: The qualities inherent in a product or service. For example, a 
computer may have a 300-gigabyte hard drive and a 200-MHz processor.
 
 Benefits: Everything a product or service does to make life better for the 
customer. For example, a computer may have a hard drive large enough 
to store more than 100 hours of video and a processor designed specifi-
cally for video editing — benefits that may appeal to someone who’s 
purchasing the computer primarily to edit video recordings. However, 
this is not a benefit to someone who only uses a computer to send 
e-mails. To pitch this feature to them is a waste of time.
In other words, features are product centered, while benefits are customer 
centered. Although you can point out valuable features of a product or ser-
vice, you also want to go beyond features to demonstrate how they benefit a 
specific customer.
 
You’re not the customer, so keep your opinions to yourself to avoid prejudic-
ing your customer. Say you’re a real estate agent showing your clients a Cape 
Cod–style home that’s unusual because it has a very prominent roof. You 
don’t personally care for the style, but right now, you have no idea of how 
they feel about it. If you were to utter some disparaging comment about the 
roof, you could discourage your clients from buying the home that’s perfect 
for them. The only person who should decide what a customer buys is the 
customer, not you. After they have made their choice, then the negotiations 
can begin in earnest.
Spin a yarn, sell more effectively
In the fast-paced business environment prevalent in the United States, we 
have little time for stories and often lack the expertise in telling a good story. 
In other cultures, however, storytelling is an important tool to teach, enter-
tain, educate, preserve culture, and even instill moral values. In cross-cultural 
sales, stories can be a valuable tool in driving home a point that’s difficult to 
communicate through other means.
For example, instead of lecturing a home buyer about why she should make 
an offer on a home today, I (Michael) often tell the story of a friend who hesi-
tated in a hot real estate market, only to be priced out of the home he wanted 
by the time he finally made up his mind. He has always regretted it and still 
pays rent on the same apartment today. As a result of his reluctance, he has 
little net worth to brag about.

217
 Chapter 11: Adapting Your Sales Presentation and Techniques
 
Whether you’re in real estate or another industry, you can always tell stories 
about customers who made good or bad decisions. Use these stories to help 
illustrate your point with multicultural customers.
Ditching your humor
 
Nearly every sales book suggests using humor and even telling jokes to build 
rapport with customers. Although this is generally fine with longtime Americans, 
doing so can be a dangerous minefield when selling to newer immigrants. The 
best advice we can offer when it comes to humor is this: Don’t do it.
Using Interpreters Effectively
In Chapter 5, we discuss the importance of translating your marketing materi-
als into your customer’s language of preference. After you attract some cus-
tomers from your target market, follow up by speaking to those customers 
in a language they understand. This is particularly important as your sales 
presentation progresses.
As you focus in on the product or service and the details of the transaction, 
including financing, purchase contracts, and so on, you’re more and more 
likely to encounter a language barrier that keeps you from moving forward. 
Just because a customer speaks English doesn’t mean he necessarily under-
stands it well enough to make a major purchase. At this point, you may need 
an interpreter.
Getting laughs in a foreign land
A salesman was preparing a presentation to 
deliver to a group of prospective customers in 
Japan. Advisors warned him against trying to 
use humor, but he insisted on starting his talk 
with a joke.
As he told his joke in English, the interpreter 
translated it, and as soon as the salesman 
delivered the punch line, the audience started 
laughing.
After the program, the salesman ran up to one 
of his bilingual co-workers and said, “I told you 
my joke would be a hit here in Japan!”
To this, his counterpart replied, “What you 
don’t know is that your interpreter said, ‘Our 
respected speaker has just told an American 
joke that does not make sense in our language. 
Please laugh.’”
The moral of this story is don’t tell jokes to 
people from other cultures until you know how 
humor is received by them.

218
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
In the following sections, we show you how to locate a qualified interpreter 
and how to team up with this person for optimum results. (An interpreter 
converts spoken language, whereas a translator works with written language. 
For more about the difference between translators and interpreters and 
between simultaneous and consecutive interpretation, visit Chapter 5.)
Locating a competent interpreter
When you need an interpreter, it’s usually too late to track one down because 
you don’t want to lose the momentum you’ve built up. Having a bilingual 
person on your sales team is ideal (see Chapter 16 for tips on building a 
diverse sales team).
If you can’t arrange for a full-time staff member to perform this service, then 
do some research to find interpreters in your area. Check the phone book, 
perform an online search, contact ethnic community centers, or contact 
the language department of a nearby college or university for some leads. 
If you’re located in a major metropolitan area, you may want to contact the 
nearest consular office for your customer’s home country. They often main-
tain lists of local interpreters.
 
Perhaps the best way to find interpreters is by obtaining a referral from some-
one in your industry. This ensures that the person has some experience with 
the vocabulary you commonly use.
If you don’t have a full-time staffer or somebody on call who speaks the lan-
guage, consider enlisting the services of a telephone interpretation service. 
Most are available 24/7 and speak at least 150 languages. You usually just have 
to register, and then you pay for only what you need. Here are a couple of Web 
addresses for services you may want to check out: www.LanguageLine.com, 
www.Lle-inc.com, and www.TeleInterpreters.com.
Hiring a suitable interpreter
 
While translation can be done without the customer present, your success in 
delivering a face-to-face bilingual presentation hinges on your ability to team 
up with your interpreter, so make sure you hire the right person for the job. 
Here are some of the key qualifications to consider:
 
 The person speaks the right language. Don’t hire an interpreter who 
speaks primarily Cantonese, for example, if most of your clients speak 
Mandarin.
 
 The person speaks the right dialect. Many languages have dozens or 
even hundreds of dialects, some of which may be completely incompre-
hensible to people who speak a different dialect.

219
 Chapter 11: Adapting Your Sales Presentation and Techniques
 
 The person’s personality is similar to yours in terms of aggressiveness, 
friendliness, or shyness. This ensures that your message is delivered in 
a tone and style consistent with yours. Not to be sexist, but it’s gener-
ally best for salesmen to hire male interpreters and saleswomen to hire 
females. A gender gap can further complicate the process.
 
 You’re comfortable working with the person. Otherwise, you’re likely 
to treat the interpreter disrespectfully, which could send the wrong 
message to your customers.
 
 The person is familiar with industry-specific words and concepts. 
For example, few countries outside the United States feature title and 
escrow systems and other real estate–specific services. Important as 
they are here, such concepts require skill and patience to explain in 
English, let alone in another language. The same is true for the medical 
and legal industries, as well as others.
Be prepared to handle the language challenges you and your customers 
encounter with patience, empathy, and understanding. Whatever the cost, 
you’re likely to find that good interpreters are worth considerably more than 
what you pay them.
 
Spend some time finding the right person. A lousy interpreter can do signifi-
cant damage to your customer relations. When former President Jimmy Carter 
visited Poland in 1977, his interpreter butchered his official arrival message. 
When he said that he had left the United States early that day, the translator 
told those assembled that Carter had “abandoned” his country. When the 
religious Carter talked about Polish “desires for the future,” it was translated 
as their “lusts for the future.” As if that weren’t bad enough, the interpreter 
ended the address by saying, “The president says he is pleased to be here in 
Poland grasping your secret parts.”
 
The interpretation of American-style English is difficult. Our language is filled 
with colloquialisms, acronyms, idioms, slang, and jargon. Add to this the spe-
cial requirements of technical, industry-specific terms, and the task can be 
nearly impossible for an inexperienced interpreter. A bad job can easily lead 
to misunderstandings and even lawsuits. After you have selected a candidate 
or two, hand him a few documents and ask the person to explain them in 
English so you can tell whether he understands them well enough. If you have 
someone on your advisory board who speaks the other language, have your 
interpreter explain the documents to him in the other language.
Teaming up with an interpreter 
for optimum results
You’re an expert in sales. Your interpreter is a language expert. As an added 
bonus, your interpreter probably knows more about the other culture than 

220
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
you do, too. To be most effective, you need to work together. Selling through 
an interpreter requires much more than simply converting your meaning 
from English to another language. It means working as a unit to close the sale.
In the following sections, we show you how to effectively team up with your 
interpreter even before you sit down together with customers or clients to 
ensure that your presentation is as effective as possible.
 
When delivering your presentation through an interpreter, you’re not simply 
talking to the interpreter who talks to the customer. You’re actually establish-
ing three lines of communication: between you and the interpreter, you and 
your customer, and your customer and the interpreter. Keeping these lines of 
communication open, preventing them from crossing, and building rapport 
between and among all three participants requires planning, practice, and 
time.
Laying the groundwork
Before you and your interpreter deliver your first presentation, get to know 
one another, and work together to establish a game plan and exchange 
important information. During your initial sessions together, attend to the 
following:
 
 Explain any technical terms that are likely to come up during the pre-
sentation. An interpreter may have lived in Spain for several years and 
never had the need to use certain words that you use every day in your 
business.
 
 Ask your interpreter to explain any cultural differences in eye contact, 
personal space, or other nonverbal issues that are likely to affect your 
conversations with customers.
 
 Ask about any local customs, such as the most appropriate time for a 
meeting, the customer’s concept of time, and any other issues that could 
affect your meeting.
 
 Review your goals for the presentation, including the nature of the trans-
action and the part you want your interpreter to play.
 
 Practice speaking in short phrases and pausing from time to time so 
your interpreter can catch up. It’s a good idea to rehearse your presen-
tation together so your interpreter knows exactly what to expect and 
you can set a pace that’s comfortable for both of you.
 
 Practice a few simple signals with your interpreter so he can let you 
know when you’re speaking too quickly or slowly. Losing control of a 
conversation is easy when you’re speaking through a third party, so con-
sider adding another signal for times when you want to inject something 
into the dialogue. You may never use it, but it’s good to have something 
agreed upon just in case.

221
 Chapter 11: Adapting Your Sales Presentation and Techniques
Making accommodations for your interpreter
Interpreting is a difficult and taxing job, both mentally and physically, even 
for experienced professionals. To avoid burnout, make the following accom-
modations for your interpreter:
 
 Schedule more time for bilingual presentations. A 30-minute presen-
tation may require 45 minutes to an hour when presented through an 
interpreter. Don’t hesitate to tell customers why the meeting may be 
a long one. You may say something like, “I’m going to schedule some 
extra time for our meeting so I can be sure to communicate everything, 
answer all of your questions, and make sure we understand each other.”
 
 Pace yourself. Don’t expect to be able to deliver your presentation at 
your normal speed. Your interpreter needs time to process what you’re 
saying, interpret it, and then relate the information to your customer, 
and vice versa.
 
 Provide water. Talking can make anyone pretty thirsty.
 
 Take breaks. You may want to schedule a break every 15 to 30 min-
utes to keep your interpreter fresh. Every couple of hours, you may 
want to take a break for snacks. Ask your interpreter what he needs. 
Don’t be shy about telling the customer exactly why you need to stop 
periodically.
 
 Treat your interpreter with consideration. Clients often assume sales-
people are going to treat them the same way they treat their colleagues.
Conducting a bilingual presentation
You planned well in advance and rehearsed to the point of achieving a 
certain level of comfort with your interpreter. Now it’s showtime — time 
to present your product or service to living, breathing customers. Here are 
some tips that can make your presentation much more successful:
 
 Speak directly to your customers, not to your interpreter. Speaking to 
the interpreter may come across as being rude.
 
 Don’t try to be funny or tell jokes. Humor is often lost in translation and 
can end in disaster if not done just right. A story or subject that’s per-
fectly acceptable in our culture can easily offend people from another. 
Just as bad, it may not be funny in a different language.
 
 Use diagrams and write down any figures you discuss, as you would 
if an interpreter were not present. Direct translation of English into 
other languages is often impossible. Too many words have more than 
one meaning and may have unexpected connotations in other languages. 
Common terms in your business may have no direct equivalent in the 
target language. These visuals can help you get your point across.

222
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
As you and your interpreter do more sales presentations together, you’re 
likely to become much better at it, communicating with and through one 
another almost intuitively. Reward your interpreter well. Finding and training 
someone new can be very costly.
Boosting Your Street Cred
To be an incredible salesperson, you have to be credible. This is especially 
true when selling to customers from other cultures. For your customers to 
feel comfortable buying something from you, they need to believe you, and to 
be believable, you must be genuinely respectful, confident, truthful, reliable, 
and knowledgeable. It also helps to work for a company that has a solid track 
record and an impeccable reputation.
In the following sections, we highlight several ways you can boost your cred-
ibility with multicultural customers.
Establishing yourself as the expert
 
Every day, the Internet proves that people buy from experts, and customers 
are often willing to pay more for the privilege of buying from an authority. 
The salesperson who delivers the highest quality information in a compelling 
format makes the sale. Before you head out to the sales floor, be sure you can 
confidently answer the following basic questions:
 
 Exactly how does our product work?
 
 Who’s our main competition?
 
 How do we stack up against the competition?
 
 What’s our pricing structure?
 
 Do we offer a payment plan or discount? If so, what kind?
Projecting confidence
Credibility means exuding confidence. Before you begin your sales presenta-
tion, make sure you’re prepared and well organized. Rehearse and perhaps 
even memorize your presentation to ensure a smooth delivery. Make sure 
your presentation leads customers step by step from introduction to closing.
 
One of the fastest ways to build credibility for a service provider is to conduct 
public seminars. Being in front of an audience, providing valuable information, 
and answering questions can earn you instant credibility.

223
 Chapter 11: Adapting Your Sales Presentation and Techniques
Showing respect to adults 
and children alike
Showing respect for your customers and their culture is key, especially when 
meeting them for the first time. Let the customer take the lead in how they 
are greeted and how they establish relationships. This action alone will put 
you light-years ahead of your less-educated competition.
In Chapter 4, we discuss the importance of showing respect to your custom-
ers. In Chapters 8 and 9, we provide specific strategies for how to demon-
strate respect for your customers when you first meet them and how to build 
rapport over time.
Respect should also extend to your client’s children. This is one of the quick-
est ways to build rapport, especially with customers from other cultures.
 
Be mindful, however, that an improper gesture can upset the relationship. For 
instance:
 
 Touching the head of anyone from Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia offends 
their belief that the head is sacred, because it houses the spirit. Because 
the spirit is not strong in young children, people from these countries 
believe that touching a child’s head could make him ill, and he could die. 
This is similar to the American belief that the soul lives in the chest area 
near the heart. Who’s to say which belief is more correct?
 
 Refrain from touching the heads of African American children. This can 
be offensive because it can remind some of the slave days when masters 
would rub the heads of Black children for luck.
Listening to your customers
Although your credibility hinges on what you say and do, it’s also affected 
by your ability to ask questions and listen. Early in your presentation, spend 
less time presenting and more time asking questions and listening to answers 
so you can become more sensitive to your customers’ needs and wants. 
(Chapter 9 has the full scoop on asking the right sorts of questions to build 
rapport early on.)
 
Listening to your customers enables you to move confidently to the next 
stage: tailoring your presentation for your customer. Every customer has dif-
ferent wants and needs, so you shouldn’t deliver the same presentation to 
everyone. In the case of multicultural customers, you may need to scale back 
the amount of information in your presentation. For example, tell your pro-
spective customers only what they need to know and no more. Overwhelming 
them with too much information can result in them understanding nothing.

224
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Highlighting your company’s track record
To build credibility you’ll want to spend some time educating your customer 
about your company’s background, particularly if your company has a long 
tradition of customer commitment.
Customers from other cultures, especially collectivist cultures, often look for 
a long history of positive service to the community so they know that your 
motives are honorable and the chances of your institution going out of busi-
ness are minimal. Many also prefer doing business with family-owned busi-
nesses, so be sure to mention this if you represent a family-owned company.
 
You can increase your credibility by displaying testimonial letters from satis-
fied customers. Make sure their surnames include the cultural heritage of the 
customers you’re trying to reach.
Honesty is the best policy
 
Your company may have unbelievably great products and services, but for 
your customers to believe you, you usually need to be forthcoming about both 
the pros and the cons — the bad as well as the good. Customers are likely to 
discover the truth anyway, and it’s better they hear it earlier from you rather 
than later from someone else, such as a competitor. Customers will appreciate 
the fact that you’re not hiding anything.
Explain the entire process: purchasing, financing, delivery, after-sales ser-
vice, and warranties. The process of buying a home, for example, can be 
intimidating to any first-time buyer, regardless of culture. Although your 
sales process may not be as complex as building or buying a home, even the 
simplest transaction can be confusing, especially for someone who is new to 
the United States.
 
Provide a brief overview of the different stages of the process when it makes 
sense to do so. For example, if you’re helping clients find a home, you’ll prob-
ably want to explain the entire process upfront and then again before they 
take possession of the property. This is true for any complex purchase where 
you’ll want to provide an overview and then review financing, delivery, ser-
vice, warranties, and other issues after you close the sale or near closing.
When selling a service, you have to explain what you do and how it will benefit 
the client. People who buy services typically buy the skills, competence, and 
attention of a particular person. So you must sell them on you. Having testimo-
nial letters from satisfied clients can go a long way toward giving prospective 
customers a sense of confidence. When selling a service, it’s even more crucial 
to develop a strong, respectful relationship because you are the product.

Fielding Differences in the Financing 
of Major Purchases
Ironic, isn’t it, that people who have the least need to borrow money have the 
easiest time qualifying for loans at the lowest interest rates. This is true just about 
anywhere you go, but it if you think it’s tough to get a loan these days in the 
United States, try borrowing money in other countries. In many foreign countries, 
obtaining a loan for a major purchase, such as a home or car, is reserved for only 
the very wealthy; the average person has to pay cash for everything she buys.
First-generation arrivals to this country may not grasp just how much easier 
and common it is to borrow money to buy big-ticket items here. In America, 
we buy just about everything on credit. In fact, the statement at the bottom of 
the Statue of Liberty should say, “Give us your poor, your tired, your huddled 
masses — and we’ll give you credit.” To have any chance of selling big-ticket 
items to customers from other cultures, you need to master a few techniques 
for bringing them up to speed on how financing works in the States.
Taking your time to explain 
financing options
In the United States, we have a dizzying array of financing options. For 
instance, home loans can be fixed rate or variable, amortized or interest only, 
fully amortized or negatively amortized, owner carried or bank financed, and 
many other variations. One mortgage broker we talked to said he offers more 
than 400 different loan programs! Credit card companies and individual busi-
nesses offer even more options, including interest-free financing, layaway, 
and installment plans.
Even people born and raised here have trouble deciphering a loan applica-
tion. Just think how much more difficult this is for someone who’s been here 
only a short time and is just beginning to pick up the language. A “good faith 
estimate” could easily be mistaken by them as the cost to join a church! So 
be prepared to spend extra time explaining financing options to multicultural 
customers. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself repeating these concepts 
by using different learning styles.
Getting the lowdown on down payments
Most salespeople never suspect that the down payment for a loan can be 
a sensitive topic, but it is for many multicultural customers, especially 
Hispanics and Asians. In fact, some customers may interpret a simple 

226
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
question such as, “How much do you have for the down payment?” to be 
life threatening. Why? Because in their home countries, banks are often mis-
trusted, so even after moving to the United States, they may keep cash for a 
down payment hidden somewhere in or around their home. These customers 
may be afraid that answering questions about the down payment could make 
them more vulnerable to home invasion robberies. This is why many lenders 
have trouble obtaining personal financial information from these groups.
 
Instead of asking a common question like, “How much cash were you planning 
on paying for a down payment?”, show customers a menu of choices and then 
let the borrower choose. Show them the down payment and monthly payment 
required for a 90 percent, 80 percent, and 75 percent loan, for instance. This 
enables them to determine whether they have enough savings for the down 
payment and whether the monthly payments are affordable.
Making exceptions for a 
lack of credit history
The first credit card you apply for is always the most difficult one to get. You 
can have a couple thousand dollars sitting in your bank account, and the 
credit card company still rejects your application simply because you don’t 
have a credit history. Of course, this begs the question: If I can’t get credit, 
how can I possibly develop a credit history?
Many multicultural customers face this same Catch-22. They may come from 
a long tradition of paying for everything in cash, so they have no credit his-
tory, and this can cause them to have a much more difficult time obtaining a 
loan approval.
 
If you’re a lender dealing with customers who have a weak or nonexistent 
credit history, you may need to make some exceptions — give less weight 
to the credit history and more weight to other factors, such as income and 
trustworthiness. Some lenders use alternative credit verification factors, 
such as whether the applicant pays utility bills, cable TV bills, and doctors’ 
bills on time.
Offering creative (yet 
legitimate) financing
Some cultural beliefs can pose a real lending challenge for financial institu-
tions. One is the Muslim belief that paying interest is a sin. Obviously this 
runs counter to how items, such as homes, are financed in this country.

227
 Chapter 11: Adapting Your Sales Presentation and Techniques
With a little American ingenuity, several banks have worked out a solution to 
overcome this seemingly insurmountable hurdle. These clever banks have 
developed rent-to-own payment plans so that devout Muslims pay no interest 
but will own their homes after 20 to 30 years of “renting.” This is the exact 
same way you can rent to own a television set, but with a larger debt.
 
If you find that your customers are having trouble clearing the financing 
hurdle for a loan, consider consulting with your bank and with other finan-
cial institutions for ideas. Chances are good that larger financial institutions 
have dealt with similar challenges in other markets or you can offer your own 
financing solution.
Up-selling insurance and 
extended warranties
 
Credit life insurance is often appealing to family-oriented borrowers because 
the policy pays off a loan if the borrower dies. Of course, as explained in 
Chapter 5, any mention of death could be a big turnoff for some multicultural 
customers, so focus on the positive — the fact that the policy provides secu-
rity for the surviving spouse and family members.
If you’re selling extended warranties, clearly explain the cost and benefits 
of the program as well as what it does and doesn’t cover. Many longtime 
Americans have difficulty understanding the difference between the manu-
facturer’s warranty and the extended warranty, especially in terms of where 
one ends and the other begins; this is even more difficult for newcomers to 
understand.
 
Customers who haven’t grown up in the United States often buy extended 
warranties and then get frustrated later by a gap in coverage. This can sig-
nificantly damage your long-term relationship and your chances of obtaining 
referral business. Make sure your customers know what they’re buying or 
turning down upfront.
Knowing When to Stop Selling
As an experienced salesperson, you already know that when the customer 
decides to buy, it’s time to stop selling. Otherwise, you risk talking the cus-
tomer out of buying the product or service she’s already decided to buy. If 
you keep flapping your gums, you may inadvertently say something that kills 
the deal.

228
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
This rule is even more important when selling to customers from other cul-
tures. If you continue to push after they’ve decided to buy, you begin to look 
suspicious. Your customers begin to wonder whether something is wrong 
with what you’re offering: “Why is this salesperson being so pushy even after 
I decided to buy?” Customers, especially those from collectivist cultures, 
want to buy from a trusted friend, not be sold by a suspicious stranger.
 
The buying sign can come up at any time in the presentation, so remain atten-
tive throughout your presentation. As soon as you spot the sign, stop selling 
and start closing, even if it’s right in the middle of your presentation. This is 
the point at which haggling, the subject of Chapter 13, will probably begin in 
earnest. (We discuss obvious and subtle buying signals in Chapter 10.)
A rookie mistake: Overselling your way out of a sale
Overselling is the sign of an overly eager novice. 
The novice is so determined to sell something 
that he continues to sell even after the cus-
tomer has decided to buy.
You’ve probably been on the receiving end of 
overselling at some time in your life. You walk 
into a store knowing exactly what you want, 
just needing someone to hand you the product 
and ring it up. Instead, you encounter a sales-
person who proceeds to tell you everything 
he knows about the product and every other 
comparable product until you get so confused 
you just walk out.
The person should have listened to you when 
you were expressing a strong buying signal — 
when you asked, “Do you have this in stock?” 
But instead of taking the order, he proceeded 
to continue talking, raising all sorts of questions 
and doubts in your mind.
By picking up on buying signs, you can improve 
your timing so you know when to stop selling 
and when to start closing.

W
hen you begin to notice one or more of the buying signals we out-
line in Chapter 10, you often need to give your prospective buyers a 
gentle nudge (or a firm shove) to get them over whatever stands in their way 
of making a final purchase decision. Given the choice to buy or do nothing, 
most customers choose to go home empty-handed, because it’s easy and 
safe. However, playing it safe means they leave without purchasing what they 
want and need, and you walk away without what you want and need — a sale.
In this chapter, we show you how to lead your customers from a point of 
strong interest to the point at which they decide to make a purchase or 
walk away empty-handed. We describe various ways to identify less obvious 
customer objections and explain how to work through them to close the sale.
 
We stop short of perhaps the most frustrating stage of the closing process — 
negotiating or, as we like to call it, haggling. In many books on selling, negoti-
ating comes before closing. In this book, we give it its proper place — at the 
end of the closing process — and we devote an entire chapter (Chapter 13) 
to it. Why? Because generally speaking, Americans don’t negotiate the price 
of most products or services very often, so haggling is usually only a footnote 
in a chapter on closing. However, when dealing with multicultural customers, 
negotiating will almost certainly be the last step in the closing process, espe-
cially when those customers love to haggle.

Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Closing: It’s All about Conquering Fears
In the process of buying and selling, people can be filled with trepidation. 
Customers can experience sticker shock or buyer’s remorse; salespeople often 
live in fear that they’ll say the wrong thing, come across as pushy, experience 
rejection, or have to deal with irate customers after the sale. These concerns 
often get in the way of what would otherwise be a successful closing.
 
Fear breeds caution. Caution breeds indecision. And indecision leads to 
lost sales.
In the following sections, we show you how to conquer your customers’ fears 
and overcome your own.
Conquering your customer’s decidophobia
Why would someone scan the newspapers, surf the Internet, or flip through 
the Yellow Pages to find out where they can get what they want, and then 
look up the directions to your store or office, hop in the car, drive across 
town, and hassle with parking only to tell you, “We need to think about it?” 
The answer is: Fear. They’re afraid to make a commitment because they 
could make a mistake, and it’s safer (they think) to procrastinate.
Decidophobia — no kidding — is a bona fide phobia that has even made it 
onto The Phobia List (phobialist.com). The reason people are afraid to 
make decisions is that they dread making a wrong choice and disdain the 
painful regrets that result. As a professional salesperson, you must help 
your customers make the best choice at the moment, because indecision 
is decision and is often a counterproductive decision for both you and the 
customer.
 
The professional salesperson helps buyers realize that not purchasing today 
means they won’t have what they want or need, that their lives won’t be richer 
or fuller, and they’ll have to continue to make do with what they currently 
have or go without. If you truly want to serve your customers, help them 
come to the decision they already know they want to make by closing them. 
This begins with the process of asking questions, as explained in Chapters 9 
and 10, continues as you present products or services that meet their needs 
(check out Chapter 11), climaxes when you ask for the order (see “Asking for 
the Order and Overcoming Objections” later in this chapter), and culminates 
with successful negotiations (see Chapter 13).

231
 Chapter 12: Closing the Sale with Diverse Clients
Getting over your own closophobia
Some salespeople are afraid to close a customer — a fear we like to call 
closophobia — because they fear that the buyer will say no. Instead they 
keep talking and talking about the product or service in hopes that the pros-
pect will eventually say, “Okay, I’ll take it.” (If this approach ever works for 
you, run right out and buy a lottery ticket, because it’s about as likely to 
happen as hitting the jackpot.)
Other salespeople fail to close because they don’t want to appear pushy. 
Again, you have to help the customer come to the decision that she already 
wants to make. This isn’t pushy; it’s professional.
One of the best ways to overcome any phobia is to confront it. Force yourself 
to ask for the order, as explained later in this chapter in the section, “Asking 
for the Order and Overcoming Objections.” When you experience the ben-
efits of asking for the order and see for yourself that nothing scary happens 
when you do, the fear begins to dissipate.
 
Closing isn’t some magical trick. It’s a logical process you can use to assist 
customers in arriving at an intelligent decision that’s in their best interests.
Asking for the Order and 
Overcoming Objections
You can deliver an Oscar-winning sales presentation and still walk away 
empty-handed if you fail to do one final thing — ask. You need to ask for the 
customer’s business or ask for the order. Failing to ask for the order is like 
wooing your soul mate without ever asking for her hand in marriage, like fish-
ing without ever setting the hook, like . . . well, you can come up with your 
own metaphors.
 
As soon as you’ve determined the customer’s needs and shown him how your 
product or service meets those needs, it’s time to begin closing. Otherwise, 
he’ll leave without having his needs met. How tragic! As a salesperson, you 
would have done him a tremendous disservice.
The first time you ask your prospect for the order is the initial close, because 
in all likelihood, you’re going to have to ask again. Your prospect has two 
possible reactions to your initial close:

232
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
 Give you the order.
 
 Express an objection.
Obviously, if you get the order, you’ve accomplished your goal. Now it’s 
time to shut up, stop selling, and take the order. On the other hand, if your 
prospect objects, you still have some work ahead of you, as we explain in the 
following sections.
Overcoming the fear of objection
In the earlier section “Closing: It’s All about Conquering Fears,” we explain 
some common fears that can often undermine a closing, but we skip one there 
because it applies specifically to this first stage of the closing process — asking 
for the order.
Many salespeople fail to ask for the order because they’re afraid that the 
customer will then express his objections. Yep, this is just like the guy who 
never proposes marriage because he thinks his girlfriend is going to come up 
with 101 reasons why they shouldn’t get married.
What most salespeople don’t realize is that objections are positive signs. 
Until you get an objection, it’s very difficult to close a deal. Objections 
convey interest. If the customer objects with anger, he may be even more 
interested. After all, most purchase decisions are emotional. The more 
emotional your buyer becomes, the closer you are to inking the deal.
 
Don’t panic when a customer voices an objection. An objection to your initial 
closing attempt isn’t the end of the world. Most prospects feel they have a 
duty to raise roadblocks for the salesperson. Sometimes they just want you to 
earn your money. Relax. Now that an objection has surfaced, you just moved 
one step closer to getting the order.
Forgetting about ignoring objections
Some sales gurus recommend that you simply ignore objections and they’ll 
go away. Although that may work with some of your traditional customers, 
all we can say about attempting this maneuver with multicultural clients is 
this: Forget about it. To ignore an objection or request for information would 
be seen as extremely disrespectful in addition to breeding distrust, especially 
by multicultural buyers.
 
Take objections seriously from any buyer, regardless of culture. Customers 
want to know that you’re on their side when it comes to getting something 
that truly meets their needs and at a good price.

233
 Chapter 12: Closing the Sale with Diverse Clients
Mining “warm leads” from people who 
clearly aren’t ready to buy yet
 
If the customer clearly isn’t interested in making the purchase, try to find out 
why. If he’s just not ready, ask him when he could be ready or what conditions 
would make him ready. If the answer is never, then let him go. If he provides 
you with a target date or conditions that would make him ready in the future, 
then enter his information into your contact management system. This gives 
you a list of people to call in the future — people who’ve expressed a need, 
met you, and know you — your warm prospects.
When real estate agents knock on doors, they rarely meet anyone who is 
thinking about selling their house at that very moment. However, they do run 
into folks who will be selling in a couple of months, later in the year, or the 
following year. They know they need to contact these homeowners periodi-
cally until they’re ready to sell. These become warm leads, and they beat the 
heck out of making cold calls. You can do the same, whether you’re selling 
cars, insurance, health club memberships, or anything else.
Losing a customer by winning an argument
Objections often put salespeople on the defensive, but defensive posturing 
is almost a sure way to lose a customer. Your goal is not to defeat your pros-
pect in a debating contest. Your goal is to get the order.
The key to effectively answering any objection is to establish a common 
ground. After all, you both want the same thing — you want the customer to 
purchase your product or service according to the terms that satisfy both of 
your needs. So drop your defenses, and avoid getting into a verbal shoving 
match of “Am not,” “Are so.”
 
Debating a multicultural customer tends to make him feel dumb, which is why 
avoiding arguments is particularly important with these customers. When you 
argue, the exchange can cause you to lose face in the customer’s eyes and per-
haps make him feel as though he’s lost face as well — and ultimately under-
mine the sale, too. You certainly know more about your product or service 
than the customer does, but even if you win the debate, you lose.
Handling specific types of objections
Overcoming objections is like learning to counterpunch in the boxing ring. 
You need to be aware of the types of punches (or objections) your opponent 
may deliver — lefts, rights, jabs, hooks, undercuts, and so on. By knowing 

234
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
what’s coming, you can more effectively parry his attacks. In the following 
sections, we cover the six most common objections and offer suggestions on 
how to overcome them.
 
Any objection can be the result of not focusing on your customer’s true need. 
Review the list of wants and needs (see Chapter 10). Could you be concentrat-
ing on the wrong need?
Your customer doesn’t need your product or service
One of the most common objections that customers raise is that they don’t 
really need what you’re selling:
“We don’t need it.”
“We’re satisfied with the one we currently have.”
 
This is a put-off similar to “We’re just looking.” To deal with this, just respond, 
“Why do you say that?” This question forces the customer to move away from 
a generic answer and give you a more thoughtful response, such as, “It’s not in 
our budget.” This kind of detail gives you the opportunity to say, “Well, let me 
tell you about our fabulous financing plan. . . .”
If the customer really has no need for what you’re selling, you should have 
determined this when assessing their wants and needs. If he’s just come to 
realize that he has no need, then why is he wasting your time? Let him go.
Your customer lacks the authority to make a decision
This is the pass-the-buck excuse. The customer is afraid to make the decision 
and wants to hang the responsibility on someone else:
“My spouse won’t let me buy it.”
“I have to check with my attorney, accountant, taxidermist, whoever.”
This is a common stall tactic and tells you that the customer needs more 
information. New immigrant customers often use this tactic because they 
may not be familiar with your product or service and may not understand 
English completely. You can deal with this objection several ways:
 
 Try to determine what information the customer needs, provide it, and 
then ask again for the order.
 
 Persuade the person to buy on the condition that if the person who has 
authority says no, the customer can return it.
 
 Ask to speak to the decision maker. (Of course, this means redelivering 
your sales presentation, which is why it’s so critical to involve all the 
decision makers from the very start.) For more about selling to groups 
(two or more decision makers), turn to Chapter 10.

235
 Chapter 12: Closing the Sale with Diverse Clients
Your customer isn’t comfortable with deciding right away
Buyers, particularly multicultural customers, often try to cop out by saying 
they need some more time to think things over in the comfort and privacy of 
their own homes. They’ll say something like:
“Do you have some literature I can take home?”
“We don’t have time now.”
 
This is a good sign that you haven’t yet established enough trust for them 
to buy. To build trust, offer a guarantee. This immediately undercuts any 
grounds for the objection and reduces the fear of making the wrong decision. 
Customers can often exchange a purchase for a store credit or an upgraded 
product, making them happy and keeping their money in your business.
Your product or service isn’t a priority for your customer
Financially responsible shoppers attend to their hierarchy of needs in 
the order of those needs. Paying for food, housing, and medical care are 
usually the top priority, so when money is an issue, you’re likely to hear 
the following objections:
“We need to think about it.”
“We have to deal with other priorities first.”
Dealing effectively with these objections usually requires more digging:
 
 Your customer may be confused by too many details. Focus on his main 
reason for wanting to buy.
 
 Your customer really does have other priorities that are more important, 
in which case, you should help him identify an option that’s affordable or 
encourage him to come back when his situation has changed.
 
We believe that selling nonessential items to people who are struggling to 
make ends meet is unethical. Your mission is to do what’s best for your cli-
ents. Don’t push the sale. Take down the customer’s information and contact 
him periodically to determine whether his needs have changed.
Your presentation hasn’t persuaded your customer
Sometimes prospects are simply not persuaded by your sales presentation, 
in which case you’re likely to hear objections like the following:
“This isn’t for us.”
“We’ve tried others and they didn’t work.”
“We’ve never heard of your company/brand/so on.”

236
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
We’re sorry to have to break the bad news to you, but your sales presentation 
probably needs some work. You haven’t sold your customers on the value of 
your product or service and how it differs from the competition. It’s crucial 
with multicultural customers to empathize with their situation by using the 
“feel-felt-found” closing, which we describe later in this chapter. A more basic 
approach is to start all over knowing what you know now:
 
1. Summarize all the reasons the customer said he needed your product 
or service.
 
2. Use the notes you collected throughout the sales process to show how 
buying from you satisfies these needs.
 
3. Highlight the extra benefits your customer is going to receive with 
your company’s product or service.
If you need a refresher on cross-cultural sales presentations, see Chapter 11.
Your customer has no good reason to change
If you’re trying to persuade someone to use a different product or service or 
buy it from a different supplier, you have to account for inertia — a body’s 
natural resistance to change position. Inertia is commonly expressed in the 
following objections:
An objection isn’t rejection
An objection is only a request for more infor-
mation. Your customer may be confused and 
unclear about something you said or something 
you failed to mention. By addressing the sales 
objection, you give your prospect new and addi-
tional information. Armed with this extra data, 
your customer can develop a new and favor-
able opinion about the decision to purchase 
your product or service.
On the other hand, rejection tells you that your 
customer doesn’t want to buy. You’ll know 
rejection when you hear it in the form of the 
word “no” or when you see your customer 
walking out the door and not looking back. As 
long as the person hasn’t uttered the word 
“no” or something that sounds an awful lot like 
“no,” and as long as he hasn’t fled the prem-
ises, continue to answer objections and ask for 
the order.
When a customer says no, I (Ralph) take it to 
mean “know” — as in the customer doesn’t 
yet know enough to say yes. I then proceed to 
either provide the customer with more infor-
mation or ask additional questions to find out 
what’s preventing him from saying yes.
Even rejection can be cause to celebrate. If you 
discover that a customer is truly not interested, 
then you can focus your attention and efforts on 
someone else who is. If the person is interested 
but not ready to buy, then you have some poten-
tial future business to look forward to.

237
 Chapter 12: Closing the Sale with Diverse Clients
“But we’ve been using X (product or service) for years.”
“But we’ve been customers of X (company) for years.”
“I don’t see why we should switch.”
In short, you haven’t given your customer enough reason to put down the 
remote control, get off the couch, and do something different.
 
Answer the question, “What’s in it for them if they change?” Customers 
choose a different product, service, or supplier for either of these reasons:
 
 They’re unhappy with their current product or service. Dissatisfaction is 
a much more powerful motivator than desire.
 
 They need what the new product or service can do for them.
Mastering the trial close
After you’ve addressed your customer’s objections, you’re ready to ask for 
the order . . . yes, again. As you ask for the order time and again, change the 
wording so you don’t sound like a parrot. Here are some trial closes:
 
 “Do you want to pay cash or charge it?”
 
 “Would you like to take it home or have it delivered?”
 
 “Do you want to purchase the accessories now or would you prefer to 
buy them later?”
Notice that you don’t care what the answer is to these questions as long as the 
answer isn’t “No, I don’t want to buy.” Each question is carefully worded to 
evoke one of two answers, neither of which is “No.” By choosing either of the 
two options contained in the question, the prospect gives you the order — you 
merely need to work out the details.
 
After you deliver the trial close, remain absolutely silent. The customer must 
be the next one to speak because the pressure is now on them. Anticipate an 
uncomfortable pause while the prospect thinks about the final decision. If you 
interrupt that pause, you greatly diminish your probability of receiving the 
order. Keep in mind that selling is more about listening than it is about talking. 
If you’re constantly flapping your lips, you may be too busy to notice the signs 
that indicate your customer is ready to buy.
 
Use the assumptive close in moderation, if at all. Multicultural customers may 
find it insulting because it’s so obvious. Used in moderation, this closing tech-
nique can help your prospects narrow their choices when their choices are 
plentiful. Just don’t go overboard.

238
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
If the customer says, “Whoa, I’m not sure I want this at all,” then you know 
you need to back up and find out what his real objection is. After you 
uncover it and deal with it, you can try closing again.
Putting a Multicultural Twist on 
Road-Tested Closing Techniques
You can find plenty of books and other resources on the market to help you 
hone your closing technique. One of the best is Sales Closing For Dummies 
by the legendary Tom Hopkins (Wiley). Not all of the standard closing tech-
niques, however, are as effective with multicultural customers. Some are 
downright counterproductive. In the following sections, we reveal some 
closing techniques that are more likely to work with prospects from other 
cultures.
 
If you’ve done a thorough job at closing your customer, she should be clear 
about what she needs, including all the accessories desired. It’s time to ask 
for the order again. When dealing with longtime Americans, it’s usually just a 
matter of writing up the order. When selling to multicultural customers, how-
ever, it’s more than likely that after they’re clear on what they’re buying, you’ll 
encounter the most feared part of the sales process — negotiating. When you 
reach this point, you’re ready for Chapter 13.
The balance sheet close
When you encounter bean counters — detail-oriented customers, especially 
those with engineering, accounting, or mathematical backgrounds — be 
prepared to slice and dice with the balance sheet close. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Draw a line down the center of a blank sheet of paper.
 
2. Label the left column “Pros” and the right column “Cons.”
 
3. Ask the customer to list all of the reasons why she should go ahead 
with the purchase under the Pros heading until she’s run out of ideas.
 
4. Ask her to list all of the reasons why she shouldn’t buy now under the 
Cons heading.
 
This tactic empowers the customer and enables her to clearly see which side 
has more weight. The key to making this work is to assist customers with the 
Pros list and remain perfectly silent when it comes to the Cons. After you’ve 
completed a thorough wants and needs analysis (see Chapter 10), you can say 
things like, “Remember you wanted to buy this computer to help your kids 
with their homework, in addition to sending e-mail?”

239
 Chapter 12: Closing the Sale with Diverse Clients
If you do the closing technique properly, the Pros side always wins out by a 
mile. All you have to do now is take the order.
The been-there-done-that close
In Chapter 11, we recommend telling a story during your sales presentation 
to more effectively illustrate the benefits of your product, your service, or 
your company. Stories are an effective closing tool in cross-cultural sales, 
as well, because you can present scenarios that prospective buyers can 
envision happening to them.
For example, you could tell the story of a customer who delayed her purchase 
this way: “I had a client last month who wanted to think about her decision for 
one day. Unfortunately, when she returned, the one she wanted was sold, and 
we never got another one in. I would hate to see that happen to you.”
The bracket close
 
If your buyer is having trouble deciding whether to buy the midline model 
that you know is right for her needs and budget, show her a similar but much 
more expensive model and then one that is much less expensive (if available). 
The bracket close quickly convinces your prospect that she doesn’t need all 
the bells, whistles, and expense of the costlier product, while the cheaper one 
doesn’t meet her needs.
The calendar close
 
Multicultural customers often have to return several times before they have 
enough trust to make a major purchase, so the calendar close can be very 
effective. Here’s how it works: If you’ve tried several times to close the cus-
tomer and it’s clear she’s not ready to buy, the best you can hope for is to 
make an appointment for her to return in the future. Be sure to set a specific 
date and time as well as determine any information she would like you to 
prepare for the meeting. This keeps you in the game and gives the customer 
a deadline to work toward for making a purchase decision. It also gives you 
another warm call to make sometime in the future.
The companion close
As discussed in Chapter 10, people from collectivist cultures rely on the 
opinions of others they trust. If the primary purchaser seems to be having 
difficulty making up his mind and others are accompanying him, pick 

240
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
someone who seems to be positive about the purchase and sell her. It could 
be a spouse, friend, grandparent, or even child who can tip the scales in your 
favor. This technique is called the companion close.
 
Get the companion involved in the purchase by letting her try the product or 
read the brochure. Because this person isn’t the ultimate buyer, she has no 
financial or emotional commitment and is more likely to agree with you.
The concession close
The concession close (also referred to as the trade-off close) is sort of like nib-
bling (asking for just one more thing to be thrown in), but in this case, you’re 
doing the nibbling. It works like this: You offer the prospect something, such 
as a free accessory or service, and ask something in return or strongly imply 
that you expect something in return — usually the sale. (We cover nibbling in 
more detail in Chapter 13.)
This close is particularly effective for customers who are teetering on the 
fence and need just one more perk to get them past any reservations they 
may have. However, by asking for something in return, you’re letting them 
know very subtly that this is the best deal you’re going to offer.
 
Always save something for the end of the deal in case the customer tries to 
nibble on you. See Chapter 13 for details.
The demonstration close
As we explain in Chapter 11, some multicultural buyers tend to be more 
kinesthetic (or hands-on) than others, so letting them try your product or 
service often gets them to sell themselves. You can say something like, “You 
won’t believe how fast this cleans. Try it for yourself.” The demonstration 
close provides tangible evidence that the customer can’t argue with.
The economic close
Many new immigrants are very money conscious. They may wonder out loud 
if they can afford to buy what you’re selling, so show them the real economic 
cost of not buying. For instance, you can say something like, “This model is 
so energy efficient that within a year it will pay for itself, and after that, the 
savings go right into your pocket.”

241
 Chapter 12: Closing the Sale with Diverse Clients
The emotional close
The emotional close gets the customer to emotionally own your product or 
service. Determine whether they’re more motivated by fear of loss or satis-
faction of gain. You can usually get a sense of what motivates your custom-
ers during the questioning stage of your sales presentation, as discussed in 
Chapter 10. If it’s fear of loss, you can say something like, “How would you 
feel if someone else bought this tonight while you were thinking about it?” 
If they’re more motivated by satisfaction of gain, say something like, “If you 
owned this right now, how would you feel?”
The feel-felt-found close
Some buyers, especially new immigrants, want to know that you empathize 
with their situation. They may state an objection about a particular feature of 
the product or service, or they may mention their inability to make the pay-
ments, for example. In this case, you can draw from your own experience and 
use the feel-felt-found close. Simply say, “I know how you feel, because when 
I bought my first one I felt I couldn’t afford it either. What I found is that you 
get used to making the payments, and now I hardly notice them.”
The guarantee close
Many people are afraid to make a mistake, and this is particularly true for 
those who are less familiar with your product or service or may not be com-
pletely fluent in English. This is a good time to go over any guarantees or war-
ranties you offer. For information on explaining the terms of guarantees and 
warranties, check out Chapter 11.
The never-the-best-time close
It’s natural for anyone to put off a decision if they can. The never-the-best-time 
close shows your customer that delaying will do her no good or may even 
hurt her. Talk about what your customer stands to miss out on by not having 
it. You can say, “If you wait until next month, that’s 30 days less that you’ll 
have to enjoy it,” or “The best time to buy is when you need it, which seems 
to be now, wouldn’t you agree?”

242
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
The puppy dog close
The puppy dog close is a powerful closing technique, because hardly anyone 
can take a cute puppy home, play with it, and then want to take it back the 
next day. If you can, let the customer try your product or service for a day 
with no strings attached. If it’s as good as you probably say it is, the prospect 
is highly unlikely to get cold feet after they’ve experienced it.
 
People from some cultures are highly kinesthetic; after they get a chance to 
try your wares for a while, they’ll find it hard to let them go. See Chapter 11 for 
more about kinesthetic and other learning styles.
The quality close
The quality close emphasizes quality over other factors, especially price. 
Many cultures are thousands of years old, and they highly value longevity. 
If you know your client is value conscious, you can say, “You can see by the 
quality of the construction that this is really built to last. Although it’s priced 
a bit higher than its less-expensive competitors, you should save money 
through lower maintenance and operating costs.”
The standing-room-only close
Buyers, especially those from collectivist cultures, can be greatly influenced 
by peer pressure. If you’re selling a popular item, you can use the standing-
room-only close to hint that your customer may be left behind or seem out 
of touch by not buying your product. This scenario would sound something 
like, “You can see from our inventory sheet that we had 20 of these yester-
day, and today we only have 3 left. I would hate to think that you might come 
back tomorrow and we’d be out of these state-of-the-art phones.”
The summary close
Summarize the list of benefits that the customer stands to gain. This not only 
reminds her of the value she’s getting but that you’ve been paying attention 
to her. A real estate agent may say, “Remember that this house is only five 
short minutes’ drive to your work, two minutes from your daughter’s school, 
and ten minutes from that shopping center you like so much.”

243
 Chapter 12: Closing the Sale with Diverse Clients
The testimonial close
Buyers from collectivist cultures rely on the opinions of those they trust. Use 
other people’s words to convince your customers that you have a great prod-
uct or service. After you gather testimonials from customers, here’s what you 
can say: “I’ve received many letters from buyers explaining how happy they 
are with their car and our service department. Here are just a few.”
The treat close
Many new immigrants work very long hours and may feel guilty about spend-
ing their hard-earned money on something they consider to be a luxury. 
In this case, you can point out that they should treat themselves by saying 
something like, “I can see that you like this model, but it might be a bit more 
than you want to spend. You work really hard, and it seems to me that you 
deserve to reward yourself, don’t you think?”
Avoiding High-Pressure Sales Maneuvers
Back in days of Willy Loman (the tired main character in Arthur Miller’s play 
Death of a Salesman), the hard sell worked. Nowadays, consumers are more 
sophisticated. High-pressure tactics are much more effective at driving pros-
pects away than closing deals. This is true of your longtime U.S. residents 
and is even more true of your new-immigrant clientele. High-pressure tactics 
undermine trust — the very thing you need to establish most to sell to 
customers from other cultures.
Ditch the hard sell
People from high-context cultures don’t like high-pressure sales, so if you 
normally subscribe to the ABC’s of selling (Always Be Closing), you may need 
to change strategies. Offering special incentives only if the customer signs 
a contract or places an order today may be counterproductive. Customers 
from high-context cultures feel that friends don’t have to pressure friends 
to buy. Building trust rather than offering special deals is usually a more 
effective approach, as we discuss in Chapter 9.

244
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
Steer clear of techniques such as the ultimatum (“Buy today or forget it”) and 
take-it-or-leave-it (“Take this deal or else”). High-pressure closings such as 
these drive customers out the door never to return. High-pressure tactics are 
a sign that you’re desperate and have run out of ideas.
If you get only one shot . . .
In some sales situations, you have only one opportunity to sell a customer, 
such as timeshare sales that cater to distant visitors or artisans whose main 
trade are tourists. These potential buyers aren’t likely to return for a second 
visit, so how do you encourage them to buy today without seeming pushy?
 
If you offer a “buy today” incentive, put it into the form of a choice rather than 
a high-pressure sales tactic. In other words, a timeshare salesperson might let 
the customer know that if he buys today, the price is $12,000 for a premium 
week and after that it will be $15,000. Remind the customer that it’s like a 
department store that offers a one-week sale, and after the time has passed, 
it would be false advertising to keep offering the discounted price. It’s the 
buyer’s choice to purchase now, but to save face with other customers who 
do buy on their first visit, you must be consistent in enforcing the policy.
Avoid the “one-sit close”
One of the groups I (Michael) regularly speak to 
consists of remodeling contractors throughout 
the United States. This industry is famous for 
using what is called a one-sit close. The sales-
person sits down with the customer for the 
first time, determines his needs, calculates 
an estimate for the job, and leaves with the 
business — or not. To go back again takes 
more time and reduces your income per hour, 
so in this industry it’s either buy now or forget it. 
Although this may work with some Americans, 
it’s ineffective with high-context people who 
want to establish a relationship before they buy 
(see Chapter 3 for more about high-context cul-
tures). They want to take the time to get to know 
and trust you before they spend $50,000 or more 
of their hard-earned money on remodeling their 
home or any other major purchase.

f you grew up in the United States, you’re probably unaccustomed to hag-
gling over what you pay for a product or service. You may dicker about the 
price when buying a car or a house, but to get a good deal on other products 
and services, you don’t haggle — you shop. You skim through the sales inserts 
in the Sunday newspaper or search for the product online at a comparison 
shopping site, such as Shopzilla. Or you head to eBay or Priceline.com to name 
the price you’re willing to pay.
When you’re selling to customers from cultures where people are born to 
haggle, you may be completely blindsided at the very moment when you feel 
the deal has been sealed. You were certain that your customers were finally 
clear and in agreement about the purchase and all the terms related to it, so 
you proceeded to close by asking for the order. Now they want to quibble over 
your price?! What gives? What could they possibly be thinking?!
The fact is that this approach is the rule rather than the exception for people 
from haggle-friendly cultures. In this chapter, we level the playing field by 
showing you what to expect and revealing some negotiating strategies that can 
give you the upper hand.
 
If you have a no-haggle policy, you probably aren’t going to be very successful 
selling anything to people from haggle-friendly cultures. Accept the fact that 
the sticker price is always negotiable when you’re selling to people from these 
cultures and that you need to develop some negotiating skills of your own. This 

246
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
chapter instructs you on the basics, but you may want to consult additional 
resources, including my (Michael’s) book Black Belt Negotiating (AMACOM) 
and Negotiating For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Michael C. Donaldson (Wiley).
Separating Buyers from Bargainers
Travel the world, and you can pretty much put every culture into one of two 
camps — buyers and bargainers or, to put it another way, non-hagglers and 
hagglers. In most cases, the hagglers come from countries that are time-rich 
and money-poor — places where haggling is a survival skill. In time-poor, 
money-rich countries, haggling is much less prevalent. People have precious 
little time to waste negotiating with a salesperson to save a few bucks.
In any event, when you’re dealing with immigrants, you’re often dealing with 
hagglers. Many of these folks left their country for precisely the same reason 
they became hagglers — they were time-rich and cash-poor, so they came to 
the United States. In the following sections, we tell you which cultures simply 
shop and which cultures consider negotiating to be a way of life.
The buyers: Non-haggling countries
Ever notice the similarities between the words haggle and hassle? In 
the United States, most customers find the words nearly synonymous — 
haggling is just one big hassle. In non-haggling countries, customers can 
usually muster up the courage to bargain for a better deal on big-ticket items, 
but they rarely enjoy it, nor are they very skilled at it. Consumers in the 
States hate haggling so much that one major car manufacturer used it as a 
marketing tool, advertising a no-haggle policy, and customers snapped up 
the vehicles.
 
Non-haggling countries are usually those countries where people tend to be 
relatively cash-rich and time-poor, including the following:
 
 Canada
 
 France
 
 Germany
 
 Great Britain
 
 United States

247
 Chapter 13: Negotiating with Natural-Born Hagglers
The bargainers: Haggling countries
In 2007, the average monthly income of people employed in Russia was $550. 
People in mainland China earned just $155 per month. Workers in India 
received only $44 per month — the equivalent of 28 cents an hour if they 
worked a 40-hour week.
When you earn such a paltry salary, every penny counts, and you tend to 
be highly motivated to make your money last. In these countries, customers 
rarely pay the sticker price. In fact, they haggle over everything, even the 
price of meat and vegetables. Saving even a few dollars can make the differ-
ence between a family eating well and possibly going hungry.
For many, negotiating prowess is a survival skill that is honed on a daily 
basis. When they come to the United States, they may become more affluent 
but still may be unable to leave the haggling habit behind.
 
Countries where haggling is a way of life include the following:
 
 Most countries in Africa
 
 Most countries in Asia
 
 The Caribbean Islands
 
 Greece
Dealing with your haggling disability
If you’re the product of a no-haggle culture, 
you’re handicapped when it comes to negotiat-
ing. With no training in the art of negotiating, 
you’re stepping into the ring with some real 
prizefighters. Customers born in the United 
States or other non-haggling countries often 
feel helpless and rather powerless in most 
common bargaining situations, including buying 
a car or a house. We don’t dare walk into a 
major department store and ask for a discount 
on some very nice but overpriced outfit we 
desperately desire.
If negotiating makes you feel like little David 
going up against the behemoth Goliath armed 
only with a slingshot and a bad aim, you may 
want to enroll in a course on negotiating. While 
this chapter and other training materials may 
bring you up to speed on the basics, practicing 
your skills in a classroom setting can give you a 
more realistic experience. Think of it as the dif-
ference between looking at dance steps drawn 
on a piece of paper and actually taking dance 
lessons. Classroom experience can increase 
your confidence in situations when you must 
negotiate to make the sale. Ultimately, however, 
you must practice your skills in the real world.

 Most countries in Latin America
 
 India and Pakistan
 
 Countries that comprise the Middle East
 
 The former Soviet Union
 
 Turkey
 
 Most other countries that are less industrialized
To people from haggle-friendly cultures, haggling isn’t just about price and 
terms; haggling is about building relationships. It doesn’t matter whether 
customers are buying a throw-away plastic watch or a Rolex — through the 
process of haggling, they get to know you, your company, and your products 
and services more intimately.
Knowing What to Expect
Salespeople often become frustrated selling to born-and-bred hagglers for 
two reasons:
 
 First, these customers tend to want to negotiate everything.
 
 Second, the negotiating process can seem to go on forever — before, 
during, and even after the sale . . . sometimes even after the customer 
signs the contract! For people who were raised in a primarily non-
haggling culture, this can be maddening.
If you’re serious about selling to people from haggling cultures, however, you 
need to adjust your mind-set and be prepared to negotiate. In the following 
sections, we show you what to expect.
Everything is negotiable
In countries where people haggle, customers don’t simply haggle over price. 
They haggle over everything — price, terms, delivery fees, the cost of extended 
warranties, and just about anything else that’s related to the transaction. That’s 
how they save money and remain in tip-top condition for future negotiations.
When building a new home, for example, these folks will dicker over not 
only the price of the house, but also the upgrades, lot location, landscaping, 
financing, closing costs, service contract, and more. When negotiating the 
purchase of a new car, these same customers will bring up issues such as the 
dealer invoice, extended warranties, financing, floor mats, how much gas is in 
the tank, maintenance plans, top dollar for their trade-in, and more.

249
 Chapter 13: Negotiating with Natural-Born Hagglers
 
When selling to these skilled hagglers, be prepared for them to ask about 
special discounts or freebies, including the following (and much more!):
 
 Free delivery or shipping
 
 Free gift wrapping
 
 Extended warranty
 
 Free or discounted accessories
 
 Free upgrades
 
 Price discount if more than one is purchased
 
 Free or discounted financing
 
 Free sessions (for service providers)
 
 Free training
 
Every department in your company — not just sales — can be affected by 
some people’s propensity to negotiate. If you have a separate department that 
provides the upgrades or accessories, the customer may request that you 
include these up-sell items in the deal at little or no cost. On large purchases, 
customers may expect free financing, a lower interest rate, or reduced fees. 
After the sale, customers may expect customer service to maintain or repair 
items that were never covered under warranty or fix things that went out of 
warranty years earlier. If you sell pianos, for example, customers may ask for 
discounts to have their pianos tuned regularly. If you sell cars and have a 
service department, customers may request discounts on everything from 
tuneups or oil changes to major repairs.
 
Provide the manager of every department in your company with training in 
negotiations so you can effectively serve this market without having your 
profit margin assaulted. Have your department managers read this chapter; 
better yet, have them read the entire book.
What about death and taxes?
When I (Michael) say in my seminars that 
nearly everything in the world is negotiable, 
many of the attendees point out that death and 
taxes are nonnegotiable. Although that may be 
true to some extent, the truth is that the cost 
of healthcare and how much you pay in taxes 
are negotiable. I get a “good patient discount” 
from my doctor, for example, because I never 
miss an appointment and always pay my bills 
on time. This saves my doctor a great deal of 
time and paperwork, so he passes the savings 
on to me.
If you owe several years’ worth of income tax to 
the federal government, you can often negotiate 
a lower lump-sum payment through its Offers in 
Compromise program.

250
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
Negotiating never stops
Most people, including salespeople, have little exposure to cultures in which 
negotiating is a way of life. Because of this, salespeople often become frus-
trated with customers from these cultures. Many sales professionals com-
plain that some groups seem to haggle before, during, and even after the sale. 
What’s even more maddening is when the salesperson is absolutely sure that 
the patron can easily afford the purchase; why do they spend so much time 
being difficult when they can pay the sticker price?
 
The penchant for negotiating everything is just a cultural difference. As many 
people in the business world like to say, “It is what it is.” Accept it and plan 
for it — know exactly what you’re willing to negotiate upfront.
Fielding Low-Ball Offers and 
Requests for Discounts
Salespeople who are unaware of the nuances of selling to customers from 
haggling cultures often lose customers by misinterpreting low-ball offers and 
rejecting them outright. What would you do if you had a lot full of $40,000 
cars and a customer came up to you and said something like, “I know this car 
is $40,000, but you have so many. How about letting this one go for $20,000?” 
Most uninitiated salespeople are likely to laugh and tell the customer to 
come back when he’s serious.
With multicultural customers, this can be a huge mistake. That shockingly 
low offer is actually a buying signal. If the customer simply looked at the 
price tag and walked off the lot without saying a word, you’d know she wasn’t 
interested, but you wouldn’t know why. The customer who pitches a low-ball 
offer is interested and ready to negotiate the purchase.
In the following sections, we reveal the do’s and don’ts of fielding low offers 
and requests for discounts, and we offer strategies that can boost your sales.
 
When customers from haggling cultures make a laughably low offer, don’t take 
it personally or feel insulted — this is the ultimate sign that they’re willing 
to buy from you. Be elated knowing that you have serious prospects and are 
about to make a sale!
Don’t take the bait
If you’re new to dealing with people from bargaining cultures, you’re likely to 
think that they expect you to accept their initial offer, regardless of how low 

251
 Chapter 13: Negotiating with Natural-Born Hagglers
it is. Nothing could be further from reality. Perhaps the worst move you can 
make when a customer offers a ridiculously low price is to accept it. Perhaps 
you set the price ridiculously high, the product is overstocked, or you have 
some other reason to accept the offer. Whatever your motivation, don’t 
accept that initial offer, because it can backfire.
 
If, for whatever reason, you’re motivated to accept a ridiculous offer, it may 
immediately raise the customer’s suspicions. Why would you sell such a valu-
able product or service for such a low price? What’s wrong with it? These 
questions can cause the customer to try to back out of the deal as quickly as 
possible, no matter how good the deal may seem.
Do express shock and dismay
 
When a customer makes an unacceptably low offer, you’re likely to feel 
shocked and perhaps insulted. Many salespeople try to hide these emotions 
behind a stoic and cool demeanor. This can send the wrong signal. Your lack 
of negative response may lead your customers to believe that you’re consider-
ing their offer and set them up to be disappointed. When you later try to write 
up the purchase at full price, it may make you appear dishonest.
It may not seem intuitive, but one of the most effective ways to get low-
ballers to raise their offer is to demonstrate the pain it has caused you. 
Flinch. Grimace. Let your face and body express what you’re thinking.
If you work in a jewelry store and are showing a $2,000 ring, for example, 
and the customer asks, “Would you take $1,200?” repeat the price back in a 
horrified tone, “$1,200!” Then be absolutely silent and give the customer a 
chance to absorb the fact that their offer is unacceptable. What they’ll likely 
do next is respond, “What about $1,400?” Your flinch just bought a $200 price 
increase for nothing.
If the offer is in the ballpark, you may want to consider raising the ante one 
more time to create the illusion of precision. (See “Do use the ‘illusion of pre-
cision’,” later in this chapter for details.) If the offer is still too low, express 
your disappointment in some other way so they won’t think you’re just 
acting. You can slowly shake your head and frown without saying another 
word. Your silence puts the pressure on them to raise their offer.
 
Develop an entire repertoire of nonverbal expressions of disappointment. You 
need to mix it up so the customer will be less able to tell that you’re putting 
on an act. Here are some suggestions:
 
 Laugh and say nothing.
 
 Put your hand to your mouth as if you don’t want to say what you’re 
thinking.

252
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
 Put your hand to your head as if the low offer has given you a headache.
 
 Look the customer in the eye and shake your head from side to side.
 
 Act as if you just grabbed a live electric wire and recoil.
You can also vary your expressions of disappointment by adding verbal 
“flinches,” such as the following:
 
 Laugh and say, “Seriously, what are you really thinking?”
 
 Repeat the customer’s offer back in an incredulous voice.
 
 Act horrified and say, “You’ve got to be joking!”
 
 Pretend to be confused and respond, “You must be thinking about the 
one without the options, right?”
Keep up this process until the customer appears as though he’s going to 
leave. At this point, you know you’re getting close to his bottom line. (By the 
way, any time someone says, “This is my bottom line,” it’s almost guaranteed 
that it isn’t.)
 
Now keep quiet! For any flinch to have maximum impact, remain absolutely 
silent after you deliver it. This silence shifts the pressure to respond back to 
the customer. When the customer made the silly offer, it put pressure on you 
to respond. Your flinch followed by silence puts the ball back into his court.
 
Get comfortable with uncomfortable silences so you can use the discomfort to 
your advantage. The first person to speak loses.
Do help customers save face
Asians, Hispanics, and Middle Easterners are particularly sensitive to the 
need to save face. Saving face is important to them, and they believe it’s 
important to you, too.
When customers present an unacceptably low offer, one way to respond 
is to tell them something like, “Because we’ve sold all of these to our other 
customers at this price, to save face with them we must sell it to you for the 
same price.” This often shuts down the haggling immediately, because many 
people from collectivist cultures will accept this explanation without any 
additional need for discussion. (For more about collectivist cultures, visit 
Chapters 6 and 11.)
 
Be sure to use the phrase “save face,” because it really resonates with people 
from collectivist cultures. If they cause you to lose face with your other cus-
tomers, they, in turn, lose face. Couching your inability to discount the price 
in terms of not wanting to lose respect with other customers expresses your 
motivation in a way that customers from these cultures clearly understand. 

253
 Chapter 13: Negotiating with Natural-Born Hagglers
After all, who would want to find out that their friend or relative paid less for 
the very same item? This is especially effective when selling big-ticket items, 
when people are more likely to compare the price they paid.
 
This countering technique doesn’t work in all circumstances, and even when 
it does, there’s no guarantee it will curtail all future negotiations on other 
aspects of the transaction. It’s just one weapon you can keep in your arsenal 
when bargaining with experienced hagglers.
Do use the “illusion of precision”
Whenever you’re presenting a counteroffer to a customer, never make your 
response an even number. For instance, if the customer is considering a 
$1,000 diamond watch and offers you $800, resist the temptation to respond 
with “$900.” It sounds like you just pulled this number out of thin air and you 
could be willing to go lower.
 
Instead, use your flinch-and-grimace tactics (see the “Do express shock and 
dismay” section earlier in the chapter) to get them to come up as high as pos-
sible from their low starting number. If you must quote a figure, hesitate for 
a moment and then make it precise, such as $947. This implies that you have 
calculated your profit margin, carrying costs, rent, and alimony payments to 
come up with as low a figure as possible. It also sends a clear message that 
this is truly your bottom line.
Don’t offer to “split the difference”
One negotiating strategy that spans all cultures consists of splitting the differ-
ence, and it’s always a bad idea. Splitting the difference disappoints both the 
seller and the buyer.
Reexamine the previous section’s example in which the seller wants $1,000 
for the watch while the buyer only wants to pay $800. The logical compro-
mise is to split the difference — the seller drops the price $100, and the 
buyer agrees to pay $100 more for a sales price of $900. Unfortunately, this 
leaves both parties feeling none too happy. The buyer thinks, “Why should 
I pay $100 more just because the seller set an unreasonable markup?” The 
seller thinks, “Just to make this deal, I’m going to have to give up $100 right 
out of my profit margin?!”
A more effective way to approach situations such as these is to counter with 
an illusion of precision, as discussed in the preceding section. Say some-
thing like, “Look, I’d like to split the difference with you, but I can’t because 
our profit margins are too small on this item. Let me tell you what I can do, 
though. I’ll knock $53 off if you’ll come up to $947.” The illusion of precision 

254
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
now makes it almost impossible to split the difference between $947 and 
$1,000 ($26.50 if you try to split the difference of $53). This offer allows the 
buyer to feel good about getting a $53 discount, while making you feel good 
about adding another $47 to your bottom line. Everybody’s happy.
 
If a customer wants a discount on your product or service, ask him how much 
of a discount he wants. Your customer may ask for less than you had in mind, 
giving you a clearer idea of where the starting point really is.
Do set deadlines
 
The more time you give your customers to make a final decision, the more 
time they have to dicker over price and terms and back out of the deal. To 
encourage customers to make a final decision, set deadlines:
 
 Announce special sales, such as Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, President’s 
Day, or owner’s birthday sale. When the day ends, so does the sale.
 
 If you have a limited supply, let the customer know you could run out. 
(Don’t just pretend you have a limited supply, because if the customer 
finds out later that you lied, you’ll lose repeat business and referral 
opportunities.)
 
 Schedule several appointments with customers interested in the same 
product or service close to each other so your customers feel they 
could lose the deal to another buyer.
Don’t focus solely on money
Competing solely on price is a loser’s game. The more you drop your price, 
the lower the profit margin goes for both yourself and your competitor. You 
need to find some other way to remain competitive without destroying your 
bottom line.
The same is true when you’re negotiating with customers. Many novice 
negotiators make the mistake of focusing solely on the sales price. When 
a customer asks for a discount, they start dropping the price. This sends 
the wrong message, confirming the buyer’s suspicion that your markup 
was unrealistic.
 
When your customers ask for a discount, consider finding other ways to 
sweeten the pot. One option is to simply provide more information about the 
value of your products and services. Customers negotiate because they want 
to feel as though they’re getting more for less. Instead of dropping the price, 
give them more information that convinces them they’re getting a great deal.

255
 Chapter 13: Negotiating with Natural-Born Hagglers
You can also look for nonmonetary ways to put together a deal that’s 
valuable to the customer but inexpensive for you. Including a warranty or 
accessories may be one way to offer value without giving away the store. 
For example, say you sell musical instruments, and a customer wants a 10 
percent discount on a guitar that lists for $700 — a discount of $70. Instead of 
squabbling about the price, consider throwing in a carrying case that lists for 
$70 but costs you only $25. By not caving in on your price, you added $45 to 
your profit margin.
 
Always counter. Even if a customer’s offer seems reasonable, counter their 
offer without tipping your hand by saying something like, “You’ll have to do 
better than that.” Giving in too early in the process can trigger doubts that 
may encourage the customer to back out of the deal. They believe that there’s 
got to be something wrong if you jump at their first offer.
Recognizing and Shutting Down Nibbling
When you’re selling to customers from haggling cultures, be prepared for any 
attempts by customers to nibble you out of your profits — asking for conces-
sions after they’ve signed the contract. In the United States, a signed contract 
signals the end of negotiations. In other countries, signing the contract is 
only the beginning. In negotiating cultures, the ability to get a really good 
deal is a badge of honor. In these places, customers like to be able to brag 
that they not only got a good price, but also persuaded the other party to 
throw in something extra.
Savvy negotiators know that Americans don’t particularly like bargain-
ing. After the contract is signed, people from non-haggling cultures are so 
relieved that we may let down our guards and become vulnerable to nibbling. 
I (Michael) have seen multicultural home buyers ask for new carpets, paint-
ing, copper piping, and even a rusty old lawnmower to be thrown into the 
deal after everyone signed the contract. To hold the deal together, a seller 
may give in to the customer’s demands in an attempt to put an end to addi-
tional requests. Unfortunately, acquiescing to these requests only whets the 
appetite. She got something for nothing, so why not ask for more?
As soon as you start making concessions, nibblers ask for more, so you need 
to spot nibbling as soon as it begins and put an end to it immediately. We 
reveal how in the following sections.
Spotting nibbling as soon as it begins
The nibbling process can begin very subtly, so tread carefully. For example, a 
customer buying a plasma TV may ask you to throw in the matching base, or 
a career coaching client could ask you to evaluate her résumé for free.

256
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
When a customer starts asking for more than what you already agreed on, the 
person is nibbling.
Nipping nibbling in the bud
As soon as you give in to one concession, you embolden your customers to 
ask for even more, so you really need to nip nibbling in the bud. In the follow-
ing sections, we describe four strategies for shutting down nibblers.
Get a concession before you give a concession
The best way to stop nibbling is to always get a concession before you give 
one. Nibblers will stop nibbling as soon as they realize that every time they 
ask for more, you’ll ask for something in exchange. Here are some examples:
 
 If a plasma TV purchaser asks you to throw in the matching base, you 
can ask her to also purchase the extended warranty.
 
 If a career coaching client asks you to evaluate her résumé for free, you 
can ask her to commit to a six-month contract.
 
 If a jewelry customer wants a more expensive chain for a pendant after 
you’ve agreed on a price, ask the customer to pay cash instead of 
charging the purchase.
 
 If the nibbler asks for additional accessories, offer to sell them at a 
reduced price but above your cost.
Practice the art of “takeaways”
Another way to stop nibbling is to take away value. In the previous section’s 
jewelry example, if the buyer wants a thicker gold chain for free, offer a less 
expensive pendant with the more expensive chain for the same price. When 
you start taking away value, nibblers usually back off from their demands.
Always save something for the end
Savvy bargainers know that they have the most leverage just before they take 
delivery of their purchase, because the seller has often already spent the 
proceeds in her mind (or maybe in reality) and doesn’t want to lose the sale.
So if you always throw in a freebie to sweeten the deal — a free sample, gift 
wrapping, or something else — don’t mention it until the customer starts to 
nibble. Then say something like, “I have a special gift for my best customers, 
but the negotiating must end.” Every time they try to nibble, remind them of 
the gift they could forfeit.

257
 Chapter 13: Negotiating with Natural-Born Hagglers
Be willing to walk away
Ultimately, the strongest position in negotiating is just to walk away from a 
deal. If you don’t like how it’s going or you’re going to lose money due to nib-
bling, you can simply say, “No, thank you.” If your customer wants it badly 
enough, she’ll raise her offer or come back later with a different deal.
 
Walking away tells the customer that you believe that your product or ser-
vice has the value you’re asking for. It also sends a message that you’ve truly 
reached your bottom line.
Short-Circuiting Buyer’s Remorse
To put an official end to the negotiating process, congratulate the customer 
on making a wise purchase decision or “investment.” Review the benefits 
of the product or service to reinforce the notion that the buyers have pur-
chased the right products or services.
Congratulating your customers can often head off any buyer’s remorse they 
may feel — the sick feeling purchasers often get in their stomachs when they 
begin to think that they made a mistake.
 
We’re sure that you can come up with your own list of benefits to point out to 
customers, but one of the biggest benefits you should always mention is the 
fact that the buyer can now stop shopping and start enjoying the product or 
service he has purchased.
Practicing Your Skills
Becoming a skilled negotiator requires real-world practice. Reading about it 
isn’t enough. In the following sections, we give you some calisthenics to keep 
you in tiptop shape so you can do battle with some of the best negotiators in 
the world — your customers from haggling cultures. We also point out some 
other opportunities you can explore to hone your negotiating skills.
Doing your negotiating calisthenics
 
Whenever you’re buying a product or service for yourself, you have a golden 
opportunity to flex your negotiating muscle. This weekend, head out to a few 
garage sales in your neighborhood and practice haggling with the proprietors. 
For $20, you can haggle all day with very little risk, because the sellers are 
usually not very sophisticated negotiators. Try the following tactics:

258
Part III: A Crash Course in Cross-Cultural Sales 
 
 Start by trying to get the seller to quote you a price lower than sticker 
by saying something like, “What’ll you take to get rid of this right now?”
 
 Pitch a ridiculously low offer.
 
 Flinch when the owner counters your offer.
 
 Respond with a counter to his counter, using the illusion of precision.
 
 Try nibbling to see how the seller responds.
 
 Try walking away and coming back toward the end of the day.
 
 Congratulate the seller on what a great deal he got.
 
 Remind the seller that he doesn’t have to donate the items you bought 
to charity or haul them to the dump.
After you’ve mastered garage sales, visit flea markets in your area. Here again 
you have little to lose, but the sellers are generally more experienced at bar-
gaining. After you’ve improved your skills, visit antique or collectible shops 
where negotiating is common, but the proprietors are even more highly 
skilled negotiators.
Finally, move up to negotiating the purchase of furniture, major appliances, 
cars, and houses as these opportunities present themselves. This kind of 
disciplined practice is what it takes to become a black-belt negotiator.
Pursuing daily opportunities 
to hone your skills
Every time you sit down with a salesperson or you pull out your wallet 
to make a purchase, ask yourself, “Is this an opportunity to practice my 
negotiating skills?” If it is, seize the opportunity.
 
To remind yourself to pursue negotiating opportunities, put a yellow sticky 
note inside your wallet with one word on it: “Negotiate?”
Set a goal to negotiate at least one purchase every day. Think about what 
items you purchase on a regular basis that you should be getting a discount 
on. If you eat at the same restaurant a couple of times a month, your consis-
tent business should be rewarded with a discount or at least a free salad or 
dessert. If you go to the same sandwich shop nearly every day for lunch, you 
should certainly get a free sandwich after purchasing ten.
By practicing every day you’ll become a master negotiator with anyone, 
regardless of culture.

Taking Your Game 
to the Next Level

In this part . . .
Y
ou got game. You can meet, greet, and pitch your 
products to the multicultural marketplace and build 
strong relationships with your customers. But how effec-
tive is your postgame (postsale) follow-through?
In this part, you take your game to the next level by keep-
ing your customers happy so they’ll come back for more 
and recommend you to their friends, family, and 
neighbors.
To assist you in achieving this goal, we focus on sharpen-
ing your customer-service skills, generating word-of-
mouth advertising, and building a diverse sales team 
that’s better equipped to serve your multicultural 
clientele.

Customer-Service Skills

 Recognizing the warning signs of poor customer service
 Providing top-notch customer service
 Responding effectively to multicultural customer complaints
 Gathering feedback from your multicultural clientele
A
chieving cross-cultural selling success is like perfecting your golf 
swing — you need to work on your back swing, forward swing, and 
your follow-through. The back swing is all the marketing and advertising 
you’ve done, along with the effort you invested in giving your business a 
multicultural makeover. Your forward swing is your sales presentation and 
any post-sale negotiations required to close the deal. With an effective back 
swing and forward swing, you can establish contact with your customer and 
make a sale. It takes a great follow-through, however, to win a customer for 
life and all the referral business that comes with achieving that goal.
Cross-cultural sales and marketing isn’t just about making your products and 
services appealing to people of different cultures. For long-term success, you 
have to adjust the way you treat people after the sale. As a salesperson or 
business owner, you’re well aware of the value of superior customer service 
in retaining customers and building a strong referral base, but you may be 
unaware of exactly how to provide quality customer service to your multicul-
tural clientele. This chapter brings you up to speed.
Spotting the Signs of Poor 
Customer Service
As a seasoned salesperson or business owner, you can probably tell the dif-
ference between stores and offices where the employees and management 

262
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
pride themselves on customer service and those where the staff just doesn’t 
seem to care. In fact, you can usually tell just by watching the customers. 
Here are the most common signs that you have customer-service issues:
 
 Long delays at checkout lines.
 
 Long waits in the lobby or reception area.
 
 Frequent returns of the same product.
 
 Frequent cancellations of your appointments.
 
 Poor signage so customers must constantly ask for help or wander the 
aisles aimlessly.
 
 Salespeople who never seem to be around when needed.
 
 Employees lack knowledge . . . when they’re around.
 
 A significant proportion of customers leave without buying anything.
 
 Prospective clients walk out of your office before meeting with a sales rep.
 
 Repeated complaints about the same issues.
 
 Personnel frequently say, “That’s our policy.”
 
 Personnel often say, “That’s not my job.”
 
 Slow response to customer complaints.
 
 Patrons frequently become angry or frustrated.
Ramping Up Your Customer-Service 
Efforts
 
Stellar customer service begins with the Global Rule — treat others the way 
they want to be treated. You already know what good customer service is all 
about. The only difference is that now you must take into account cultural 
influences and differences.
After every interaction with you or one of your staff, a client has one of the 
following three reactions:
 
 Disappointment: They got less than what they expected and will tell 
others to avoid you.
 
 Satisfaction: They got what they expected.
 
 Delight: They got more than they expected and will tell others to do 
business with you.

263
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your Customer-Service Skills
You want as many customers as possible to feel so delighted that they sing 
your praises to all of their friends, relatives, and acquaintances. In the follow-
ing sections, we offer suggestions on how to reduce the number of customers 
who feel disappointed and increase the number who are delighted.
 
The most important step in making sure your customers have a positive expe-
rience is to meet and greet them in a way that makes them comfortable. Flip 
to Chapter 8 for guidance on how to master the multicultural meet-and-greet, 
and make sure all staff who deal directly with customers have mastered these 
skills, as well. This is a great start to showing prospects that you care about 
them and their culture.
Hiring and training customer-
service-minded staff
 
If you’re a business owner, hire people who have customer-friendly attitudes 
to continuously meet the ever-changing needs of your customers and con-
stantly improve customer service. Hire for attitude first, and then for aptitude, 
because changing a person’s attitude is much more difficult than providing 
them with the training they need to competently perform their job. Recruit 
people who love to solve problems and truly care about people. (See Chapter 
16 for full details on building your staff.)
Train your staff on the ABC’s of customer service: Always Be Courteous. And 
this means being knowledgeable and helpful, too. One national grocery chain 
has spent a fortune to make sure that their employees greet every customer 
who gets within 20 feet. Although this seems to go a bit overboard, it sends 
the message that they’re dedicated to being helpful.
Train your staff yourself or hire someone to train them for you. (In Chapter 6, 
we list the components of a crash course on cross-cultural training and pro-
vide a short list of companies that can provide the training for you.) Explain 
what good customer service is (and isn’t) regularly. Most important, give 
every member of your staff enough information and power to make those 
small customer-pleasing decisions so she never has to say, “I don’t know, but 
the manager will be back later.”
 
Major manufacturers are often happy to provide free seminars about how to use 
and maintain their products. Send your frontline staff to these seminars. Sure, 
this requires an investment on your part, but it benefits you in three ways:
 
 Demonstrates your commitment to quality customer service
 
 Shows that you value your staff enough to invest in their education
 
 Improves employee retention rates so you have a more experienced staff

264
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
Educate your staff about the lifetime value of a client. Remember that multi-
cultural customers in particular can be extremely loyal. If your staff focuses 
not only on one sale, but future purchases as well, your customers will 
patronize you for a lifetime and refer friends and family. For more about 
increasing your referral business, check out Chapter 15.
Focusing on relationships — not sales
Whenever a customer enters your business, pretend that the person is a 
close friend or favorite relative you want to help. This places your focus on 
serving your customer’s needs rather than your own (making a sale). Most 
people are willing to spend a little more money if you make them feel special.
This is a good approach to take with all of your customers, but it earns you 
additional benefits when you’re working with customers from collectivist 
cultures, where relationships are valued even more highly.
Educating your customers
The source of most consumer complaints is the fact that a product or service 
didn’t live up to the promise. In other words, the customer’s expectations 
were out of whack. They thought they were getting something great, and it 
turned out to be something less than outstanding. Of course, this applies to 
all of your customers, but especially to customers from other cultures who 
may not have previous experience with the type of products and services 
sold in the U.S. To avoid complaints that arise from inflated expectations, 
educate your customers from the get-go:
 
 Educate customers about how to use the product or service. If they’re 
confused about how to use a product’s features, they may simply 
assume that the product can’t do what you said it could.
 
 Show customers how to get the most out of the product or service. If 
the product has optional accessories that make it more useful or enjoy-
able, make sure the customer knows about them upfront. Manufacturers 
make accessories and service providers offer additional services for a 
reason — because these add-ons increase the benefit of their product or 
service to the customer.
See Chapter 11 for more information on showing your customers how to use 
your product or service. We explain how to field customer complaints in 
more detail later in this chapter.

265
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your Customer-Service Skills
Treating your customers with respect
Of course, you should treat all customers with respect, but this is even more 
important when dealing with multicultural clients, because they may be a 
little more sensitive than your traditional clientele. They may be more likely 
to jump to the conclusion, for example, that discrimination is the reason you 
didn’t return their call or answer their question by e-mail.
 
Return calls and e-mails promptly and answer questions as soon as you can 
find the answers. If you’re unavailable, let customers know whom they can 
contact in your absence. Check out Chapter 4 for the basics of treating multi-
cultural customers with respect.
Being helpful — even if there’s 
no immediate reward
One day I (Michael) popped into a local watch shop because the small piece 
that clipped my watchband together had broken. When I explained the prob-
lem, the proprietor said he thought he might have one lying around. He found 
it, attached it to my watchband, and charged me nothing! Where do you think 
I’ll go when I need a new watchband or even a new watch? And how many 
people do you think I’ve told this story to?
If someone walks into your store and asks you to help them find something, 
don’t just say, “It’s in Aisle 3.” Lead the customer to the item. Better yet, 
wait a moment and see if she has questions about it or any further needs. 
Remember, customers from other cultures may feel even more “lost” than 
your usual new customer, so they may need more orientation. Whatever the 
extra step may be, if you want to provide good customer service, take that 
extra step. Doing a little extra may not seem like much to you, but people 
notice when you make an extra effort and will tell others.
Showing patience
 
Patience is crucial. New immigrants especially may have difficulty expressing 
why they’re unhappy or dissatisfied. Just listening can have a calming and 
comforting effect. Dealing with multicultural customers typically takes a bit 
more time and effort than working with folks who speak English fluently and 
are familiar with your product or service. Understanding this is often enough 
to make you more patient. (In Chapter 11, we explain in more detail the impor-
tance of listening to your customers.)

266
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
Saving your customers precious time
In the United States, everything is fast — we have drive-through restaurants, 
minute rice, the 10-minute oil change, and even instant messaging. We’re an 
on-demand society that wants it all and wants it now.
 
You may think that customers from other countries would take a more relaxed 
approach to doing business, but the opposite is often true. Because many new 
immigrants work long hours, they value their time off even more. They’d much 
rather spend time with their friends and family than with a salesperson they 
barely know, so look for ways to save your customers time. Here are a few 
ideas to get you started:
 
 Streamline transactions. Keep checkout lines moving smoothly, simplify 
your paperwork, or use a team-based approach to processing complex 
transactions.
 
 Offer one-stop solutions. If you sell guitars, for example, make sure 
you have everything a budding musician needs, including a case, strap, 
stand, amplifier, cables, strings, special effects pedals, and lessons. If 
the customer needs to shop around to different stores, they’re wasting 
valuable time, and you’re missing additional sales.
 
Don’t forget that your complete solution for a customer can include warran-
ties, service plans, financing, insurance, and other options. Any of these can 
not only increase your income but also help reduce hassle, frustration, and 
cost for the customer in the future.
Preventing misunderstandings over 
warranties and service policies
Your multicultural clientele are much more likely than your traditional cus-
tomers to expect that you stand behind what you sell for the entire time they 
own your product or pay for your services, whether or not it comes with a 
warranty or service policy. If you offer a warranty or service policy, many of 
these folks won’t completely understand how these contracts work or their 
limitations. It’s natural for anyone, especially new immigrants, to assume that 
everything is covered forever.
The best time to deal with potential issues or confusion is before any issues 
or misunderstandings arise:
 
 Explain any warranties or service contracts upfront. Make sure your 
customer thoroughly understands any limitations or expiration dates by 
having them circle, initial, and date the critical information on your copy.

267
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your Customer-Service Skills
 
 Enforce warranty and service policies consistently for all customers and 
across all departments in your company. If the word gets out that one 
customer persuaded a manager to approve replacing an entire driveway 
because he found a crack, you can expect a lot of people to ask for the 
same thing. This leaves you with few options unless you want to face 
discrimination complaints.
 
 If customers try to renegotiate the warranty or service after the sale, 
stall for time and quickly review Chapter 13 on haggling.
Throwing in something extra
Whether it’s a coupon for a future discount, additional information on how to 
use the product, or a genuine smile, people love to get more than expected. 
And don’t think that a gesture has to be large to be effective. The local art 
framer that my (Michael’s) family uses attaches a package of picture hangers 
to every picture he frames. It’s a small thing, but customers really appreciate it.
Practicing what we preach
As discussed in Chapter 13, consumers in the 
United States tend to be relatively money-rich 
and time-poor, so salespeople are wise to do 
everything in their power to save their clients 
time. Each of us (the authors) does this in our 
own unique ways:
  Michael: In my multicultural sales train-
ing business, I offer clients a full array of 
services, including the option to customize 
their program, pre-interview key audience 
members, provide assessments, develop 
workbooks, offer interactive games and 
surveys, and more. I may spend a day or two 
observing salespeople on-the-job and even 
mystery shop them — posing as a customer 
and rating the salesperson on the quality of 
his interaction. These activities can help 
me diagnose and solve several problems 
for clients at one time.
  Ralph: With my team-based approach to 
selling homes, as soon as a home buyer 
decides to make an offer, I can call back to 
the office to have my transactions coordi-
nator start the paperwork. In addition, I try 
to provide my clients with everything they 
need, including financing. If a seller needs 
an electrician to do some repairs before 
placing his home on the market, you can 
bet that I’ll have the name of a high-quality 
electrician who can do the work.
  Joe: I generally have two clients — my 
coauthors and the publisher to whom we 
deliver the manuscript. I streamline the pro-
cess at both ends with the goal of making 
the process easy and hassle free for all 
parties (including myself). Every book starts 
with a very detailed outline, which func-
tions almost like a fill-in-the-blanks form. 
After that’s in place, the writing proceeds 
much more smoothly.

268
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
 
Hold off on revealing your bonus item until the very end of the transaction, as 
noted in Chapter 13, to discourage buyers from nibbling — a common practice 
in countries where customers often haggle for better deals.
Keeping your promises
Few things annoy customers more than broken promises, because they 
totally destroy customers’ faith in you. Only make promises you’ll keep — 
not just plan to keep, but will keep. Train your staff to be conservative in 
their estimates of costs, delivery dates, and other details. Underpromise and 
overdeliver.
Reliability is the key to building trust, especially when you’re trying to attract 
customers from other cultures. If you say, “Your new bedroom furniture will 
be delivered on Tuesday,” make sure it’s delivered on Tuesday. Otherwise, 
don’t say it. The same rule applies to client appointments; if you’re not sure 
you can keep the appointment, don’t make it.
 
Pad your deadlines. If you think you can deliver the goods on Tuesday, but 
you’re sure you can get them there by Friday, say Friday. If you find out later 
that you can absolutely make it by Tuesday, call your customers and let them 
know. They’ll be delighted to hear the good news!
Remaining accessible 24/7
 
Customers want to be able to reach a human being in your company when 
they have a problem after purchasing a product or service. This is especially 
true for those who may not be completely familiar with how to use products 
or services that aren’t common in their country of origin. Offer support by 
phone, e-mail, or online chat, or hire a service that can provide 24/7 support 
for you. Make sure the support you offer is available when your multicultural 
clientele needs it; remember, they may have different schedules than your tra-
ditional customers.
Fielding Multicultural 
Customer Complaints
Pleasing existing customers should be your number-one priority for several 
reasons:
 
 According to some estimates, finding a new customer costs two to three 
times more than keeping an existing one.

269
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your Customer-Service Skills
 
 Existing clients are likely to buy more products and services from you 
because they already know you and trust you.
 
 You get more referral business from existing satisfied customers than 
from new customers who don’t even know you yet.
Don’t simply chalk up a complaint to “You can’t please all people all the 
time.” Perhaps you can’t, but if you address the complaint, you may be 
able to please this one person this one time and position your business to 
reap the benefits of good customer service. Multicultural customers tend to 
become very loyal and make lots of referrals when they’re satisfied. In the 
following sections, we offer some guidance on how to change the way you 
feel about complaints and how to address them more effectively.
Treating complaints as good news
In business, what you don’t know really can hurt you, especially if you’re 
unaware that your customers are unhappy. Studies show that for every 
person who complains to management or staff, two more won’t say anything 
but will never come back. To keep more customers coming back, be ready to 
hear the complaints, identify the cause, and solve the problem.
 
Complainers give you an opportunity to re-earn their business, so encourage 
people who are dissatisfied to let you know they’re unhappy. Give every cus-
tomer a postage-paid survey card that they can complete at home and drop in 
the mail. To increase your response rates, you can offer to put their name in a 
drawing for an attractive gift like an MP3 player or gift certificate. If the results 
show that they’re satisfied and happy, so much the better! (We discuss sur-
veying customers in more detail later in this chapter.)
 
Studies show that satisfying unhappy customers makes them more loyal than 
those who never complained at all. This is why it’s worth investing time and 
money to develop an effective customer-service program.
Considering the source
Some cultures are more apt to complain than others. Most longtime Americans, 
for example, rarely express their dissatisfaction to the salesperson or customer-
service rep. People have just gotten used to poor service in this country. While 
multicultural customers may be even more hesitant to make waves, overall, 
Hispanics are the least likely to complain, although they’re more likely to tell 
their friends and family not to do business with the offending vendor.
You may need to work a little harder to obtain feedback from dissatisfied 
customers who belong to certain groups. This is especially true for those 
who are reluctant to complain. With cultures that are less likely to complain, 

270
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
focus on becoming more sensitive to the signs that customers aren’t satis-
fied and then be more proactive in asking them what you can do to help or to 
correct a problem. Instead of waiting for customers to come to you, you may 
need to approach them.
When a multicultural customer does complain, you have to take it very 
seriously because it means they’re really unhappy. It usually takes a lot for 
someone from a collectivist culture to openly express dissatisfaction.
On the other hand, some Greeks, Middle Easterners, Israelis, and others use 
complaints as a way to increase their negotiating leverage. Always examine 
the reasons for a customer’s dissatisfaction to see how much attention the 
complaint deserves.
Responding to a complaint 
in eight easy steps
Your business should have a complaint policy that includes standard operat-
ing procedures for responding to complaints. We recommend the following 
eight-step process:
 
1. Acknowledge the complaint.
 
2. Listen.
 
3. Diffuse the anger by asking your customer to unload all the issues.
 
4. Accept the blame.
 
5. Ask your customer to suggest a solution.
 
6. Suggest your own solution if necessary.
 
7. Implement the agreed-upon solution.
 
8. Follow up to ensure satisfaction.
Step 1: Acknowledge the complaint
 
Ignoring a complaint is not an option. Unhappy customers may go away, but 
they go away angry and then blow off steam by telling everyone they know 
what a rotten person they think you are. In addition, multicultural customers 
are likely to assume that your lack of empathy is a form of discrimination. This 
isn’t exactly going to make them more receptive when you finally get around 
to dealing with their problems.
When your customer expresses dissatisfaction, demonstrate the fact that you 
care by listening carefully and taking the complaint seriously. You may even 
want to repeat the complaint back to the person to show that you’ve heard 
and understand the reasons they’re unhappy.

271
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your Customer-Service Skills
Step 2: Listen
When a customer starts complaining, it’s easy to go on the defensive and 
plug your ears. Some salespeople even proceed to argue with the customer, 
which is about the worst thing you can do, especially with multicultural 
customers; arguing may cause them to lose face, which is unacceptable (see 
Chapter 4). Instead, simply listen to the complaint and note any significant 
details that may help you resolve the problem.
Step 3: Diffuse the anger by asking your 
customer to unload all the issues
What really irritates customers is when they feel that nobody’s listening. 
They have a problem that they believe you or your company, product, or 
service has caused, and they haven’t had a chance to complain about it 
yet. They call or come in with all of this anger bottled up inside them. Your 
customer may actually be experiencing physical pain from trying to control 
his emotions.
So what’s the best response? Let the customer unload on you and then ask 
for more. We know this sounds crazy, but all you have to do is listen, and 
when the customer stops, simply say something like, “Is there anything else 
you’re unhappy about?” Sometimes he says no, and you can start exploring 
resolutions to his complaint, but more often than not, he’ll come up with 
additional issues. When he finishes, ask again, “So what else are you dissatis-
fied with?” Keep asking until he runs out of things to complain about. Until 
you hit this point, don’t even think about discussing solutions.
 
Angry people, no matter the culture, often don’t want solutions — they just 
want to be heard. Only when they feel they’ve been heard will they be ready 
to listen to you.
Step 4: Accept the blame
Regardless of what or who caused the problem, accept the blame. The first 
thing customers want to hear is an apology. You can simply say, “I’m sorry.” 
If you really can’t bring yourself to take the blame, at least say something 
like, “I’m sorry this happened.”
What you do next depends on the customer’s cultural context (see Chapter 3 
for an introduction to this topic):
 
 If you make a mistake with a customer from a low-context culture, a 
simple “I’m sorry” is usually sufficient. A complaint from someone with 
this background is viewed simply as an error in the transaction.
 
 If you screw up with someone from a high-context culture, prepare to 
make a very elaborate and flowery apology. A complaint from someone 
from a high-context culture signals that a trusting relationship has been 
damaged and must now be repaired.

272
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
Step 5: Ask your customer to suggest a solution
When you’re addressing an issue raised by a multicultural customer, realize 
that you’re likely to be involved in a negotiation in every sense of the word. 
As we explain in Chapter 13, one of the first rules of negotiating is this: Never 
make the first offer.
After the customer has calmed down, ask, “So what do you suggest as a solu-
tion?” or “What can I do to make this right?” It’s possible that the customer 
may offer something quite reasonable, easy to implement, and less than 
you’re willing to offer. Sometimes all he wants is a working replacement of a 
defective item, but sometimes he wants that plus a million dollars as compen-
sation for pain and suffering. By asking for the customer’s opinion, at least 
you know what he’s thinking.
Step 6: Suggest your own solution if necessary
If the customer’s solution is reasonable, skip to Step 7. If it’s not, then pro-
pose your own remedy. Be creative. People from haggling countries may use 
a mistake or defect as a negotiating tool to get a rebate or other concessions. 
In other words, they may know full well that they’re asking for too much. 
Make a reasonable counteroffer.
 
If you’re a business owner, empower all frontline staff to resolve customer 
complaints. Consider giving each person a set budget for resolving complaints 
without having to consult with a manager so your staff can build strong rela-
tionships on their own.
As always, when explaining policies or what you’re willing to do for an upset 
new-immigrant customer, speak slowly without raising your voice. You don’t 
want to add frustration to their anger.
Step 7: Implement the agreed-upon solution
After you’ve agreed with the customer on a mutually satisfactory solution, 
you can implement it. You may want to make a written note about how you 
plan to deal with the customer’s issue so you have something concrete to 
refer back to. Let the customer know every step of the way what the progress 
is toward the problem’s resolution. If you have to order a replacement part 
or entirely new unit, inform them when it’s expected to arrive. Remember to 
underpromise and overdeliver, as we explain in the earlier section “Keeping 
your promises.” A missed deadline here could be the kiss of death for your 
relationship.
 
If a unit needs repairs, let the customer know what the technician tells you 
about the status of the job. Call even if it’s only to inform him that the problem 
hasn’t yet been isolated and you’re still working on it.

273
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your Customer-Service Skills
Step 8: Follow up to ensure satisfaction
After the solution has been fully implemented, call or e-mail the customer 
(use whatever mode of communication he prefers) to see whether things are 
still satisfactory. You’re likely to find that people from high-context cultures 
tend to prefer personal contact.
On those rare occasions when the customer is still unhappy, you can go back 
to Step 5 or just write him off. We don’t hold the belief that “the customer is 
always right.” You may decide that this customer is just too much trouble, 
but at least you tried.
Surveying Multicultural Customers to 
Understand Their Satisfaction Level
Many retail outlets, service providers, and even some individual salespeople 
conduct customer satisfaction surveys. Some of my (Michael’s) clients even 
submit their surveys to organizations like J.D. Power and Associates so they 
can benchmark themselves against others in their industry.
After you’ve done everything possible to improve customer service, survey 
all of your customers to determine what they think of the level of customer 
service you provide. To obtain accurate ratings, be aware of the following 
do’s and don’ts.
 
If you don’t adjust your survey for multicultural customers, the results will 
be of dubious value and could even be misleading. Like anyone else, these 
customers appreciate exceptional service and want, more than average, to let 
people know.
Do set the stage properly
As early in your relationship as possible, let customers know that they’ll be 
receiving a survey and it’s very important for you that they complete and 
return it. Tell them that your performance is graded by the scores and that 
you’ll lose face with your peers and your boss if you don’t get the score you 
deserve. Finally, ask them to let you know at any time if there’s anything you 
can do to improve, because you really want to receive a top rating. Let them 
know that you won’t be embarrassed by getting a high score. For additional 
details and tips on conducting effective surveys, check out Chapter 2.

274
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
Do design your survey to be 
“culture friendly”
At the top of the survey, state that your company strives to meet the needs of 
all of its customers and one of the ways to measure this is through a survey. 
Avoid phrases like “We strive to be the best,” because collectivist cultures 
may interpret this as arrogant and putting down your competition, which 
causes you to lose face.
Do use short and simple statements
We suggest that you keep your survey short and simple by using check 
boxes. You can develop specific questions for your customers by consulting 
a survey designer. List five to ten customer-service areas, and ask customers 
to rank each area on a scale of “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree.”
Retail customer-service areas can include the following:
 
 Atmosphere: For example, “As soon as I entered the store, I felt welcome.”
 
 Staff: For example, “A staff member greeted me soon after I entered the 
store.” “A clerk assisted me in finding what I was looking for.”
 
 Store layout/shelving/signage: For example, “I was able to find what I 
was looking for easily.” “I had no trouble finding the products/services I 
was shopping for.”
 
 Sales: For example, “The salesperson I spoke with answered all of my 
questions.” “The salesperson helped me in selecting the right product/
service.” “I felt comfortable talking with this salesperson.”
 
 Post-sale: For example, “The products/services I ordered were delivered 
on time or ahead of schedule.” “Questions I had about the warranty were 
answered to my satisfaction.” “The sales staff was helpful in teaching me 
how to use the product.”
 
 Returns/exchanges: For example, “I had no trouble returning/exchanging 
the products I had purchased.”
Service providers can examine such areas as:
 
 Atmosphere: For example, “As soon as I entered the office, I felt welcome.”
 
 Education: For example, “I fully understood the services to be provided 
and their costs.”

275
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your Customer-Service Skills
 
 Personal responsibility: For example, “I understand that to obtain a sat-
isfactory result I am responsible for fully participating in this service.”
 
 Post-visit: For example, “I am satisfied with the services I received.”
 
 Overall satisfaction: Example, “I am likely to recommend this service 
provider to others.”
Figure 14-1 shows a sample survey that can fit on the back of a small mail-in card.
 
At the end of your survey, include a comments section that gives customers 
an opportunity to provide feedback on issues that your survey didn’t cover. 
We discuss customer comments in more detail later in this chapter.
Don’t use a numeric scale
 
If you use a numeric scale, you’re likely to find that the surveys completed 
by multicultural clientele, especially those from collectivist cultures, contain 
highly positive comments combined with mediocre ratings (5 or 6 out of a 
possible 10). Why is there such a disconnect? In collectivist cultures, being 
outstanding isn’t necessarily a good thing. If the person were to rate you 
highly, you’d stand out and lose face. The person who completed the survey 
doesn’t want to give you a 10 and embarrass you in front of your peers.
 
If you must have a numeric total for each question, you can convert it back 
after receiving the qualitative answers. Talk to your survey designer about 
how to do this so it accurately reflects the results of the instrument; for exam-
ple, if you use a scale of Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree, you may consider 
assigning a 10 to Strongly Agree and a 0 (zero) to Strongly Disagree.
Do define your scores
Refrain from using the terms “best” or “outstanding” in a qualitative survey 
because people from collectivist cultures may have trouble relating to these 
concepts. Instead, use words like “Agree” and “Disagree.”
If you choose to use a numeric scale, let your customers know that a 5 or lower 
indicates that the service was lacking in several ways and that they should pro-
vide details about poor service in the comments section. A 7 or 8 means that 
the service was very good but not great. You can see how a qualitative scale 
avoids this problem entirely.

277
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your Customer-Service Skills
Do be consistent
 
Whatever scale you choose to use, make sure all surveys and sections of 
surveys use this same scale. Also, be consistent with terminology. We read a 
survey in which the person being evaluated was variously called “personnel,” 
“individual,” and “employee.” Inconsistencies confuse the person completing 
the survey and can reduce response rates, especially with people for whom 
English is not their native language.
Don’t use advanced terms, colloquialisms, 
acronyms, and abbreviations
Don’t assume that everyone knows the meaning of terms used in your sur-
veys. Surveys with terminology (such as “rationale” and “sufficient”) that 
only people with an advanced college degree could understand are unappeal-
ing to most consumers, particularly people who may use English as a second 
language. Target your language to a fifth-grade level, which is pretty standard 
for business communications.
Some of your customers, including those from other cultures, may not be 
familiar with colloquialisms (informal expressions) if you use them in your 
survey. For example, not everyone will understand what you mean when you 
ask whether a staff person went “above and beyond” to meet their needs. 
Write more literally than figuratively; for example, you may ask whether a 
certain employee did more than the customer expected to meet her needs.
Abbreviations and acronyms may also trip up your customers. New immi-
grants are highly unlikely to know what “N/A” means. Some surveys explain, 
“N/A means that it does not apply.” The average person would then ask if it 
should be “DNA” instead, causing even more confusion and frustration. Spell 
everything out.
Do consider written comments
Although using comments or remarks to establish a ranking may be difficult, 
you can use comments to adjust scores that don’t seem to reflect how the 
customer really feels. For example, if the person being surveyed gives you 
mediocre scores and a glowing review in the comments section, you can 
bump up the numerical score, perhaps from a 6 to an 8.

278
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
Don’t give too much weight to negative 
comments and low scores
 
Studies show that people who are disgruntled tend to vent by giving extremely 
low marks and negative comments, whereas those who are satisfied don’t 
usually feel any reason to be overly complimentary on scores or comments. 
In short, this means that you shouldn’t beat yourself up too much over low 
scores or the lack of positive reviews, but you still need to take those low 
scores and comments seriously and use them to identify areas that need 
improvement. Pay particular attention to those categories that consistently 
receive low scores.

Referrals

E
veryone knows that word-of-mouth advertising is the best way to find 
eager new customers, including multicultural customers. In fact, 70 to 80 
percent of an experienced and successful salesperson’s business is usually 
built on referrals from satisfied customers or clients. Getting referrals, how-
ever, can be tough. Clients of all cultures naturally know how to complain, 
but when it comes to rewarding quality service by giving referrals, they’re 
often clueless. They don’t think of it on their own, so you have to ask. The 
challenge is in finding the right time to ask — when the conditions are just 
right and when your customer has a sense of gratitude for the service you 
provided.
The key to earning referrals from multicultural customers is to provide top-
notch customer service (see Chapter 14). This helps you win your customers’ 
trust and sets the stage for them to entrust you with their acquaintances. 
After earning referrals, you’re likely to feel more comfortable asking for refer-
rals, and your customers are going to feel more comfortable giving them.
In this chapter, we point out the benefits of referrals, encourage you to imple-
ment a plan for generating referrals, and show you the importance of staying 
in touch and giving incentives to gain even more referrals.

280
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
Grasping the Benefits of Referrals
Like most salespeople, you’re probably already well aware of the many 
benefits of referral business, but just in case you’ve forgotten or you simply 
disregard them as a source of business you can’t rely on, the following list 
reminds you of their value:
 
 Increased trust: In Chapter 9, we explain the importance of building 
rapport with your multicultural clientele, because trust sells. When a 
customer refers a prospect to you, the new prospect already trusts you 
more than she has faith in a complete stranger.
 
 Lower resistance to buying: When dealing with prospective custom-
ers, you need to overcome their natural resistance to buying whatever 
you’re selling. With referrals, this resistance is lower for two reasons:
 
• The prospect already “knows” you through his acquaintance.
 
• The prospect’s acquaintance already made a purchase, giving the 
prospect “permission” to buy something.
 
 According to world-renowned sales trainer Tom Hopkins, author of Sales 
Prospecting For Dummies (Wiley), the closing ratio for non-referred leads 
is 10 percent versus a 60 percent close ratio with referred leads.
 
 Reduced marketing and advertising costs: With referrals, you invest 
no money or resources in marketing or advertising and no time or effort 
searching for prospects or making cold calls. Your existing custom-
ers do all the work for you. In addition, selling to referral customers 
requires less hand holding and trust building.
 
 Increased purchases: Studies show that referral customers tend to buy 
more products and services than customers you find through your own 
marketing and advertising efforts.
 
 Even more referrals: Referral customers are more likely than non-
referral customers to recommend you. They want to turn others on to 
something good.
 
Referrals are even more important in the multicultural marketplace, where 
prospects may not trust “outsiders.” The referral grants you immediate status 
as an insider, or at least opens the door so you can prove yourself.

281
 Chapter 15: Generating Word-of-Mouth Referrals
Implementing a Systematic 
Referral Strategy
Referrals don’t just happen. You have to make them happen. Develop a sys-
tematic strategy for generating referrals and then put your plan into action. 
The following sections describe an eight-step plan of attack.
1. Set a target
As with any business plan, you must set goals and measure your results to 
improve performance. Set a clear goal with a timeline for referrals, such as a 
10 percent increase in referral business over the next eight weeks. This will 
remind you to ask for referrals whenever the opportunity presents itself.
Good news travels fast . . . in multicultural circles
Getting referrals from multicultural customers 
is usually easier than getting them from your 
traditional customers because many cultures, 
especially those in less-developed countries, 
rely less on advertising and far more on word-
of-mouth recommendations. As a result, people 
from these cultures are conditioned to making 
referrals. In Saudi Arabia, for example, people 
have for centuries relied on the recommenda-
tions of friends for survival. Trust in personal 
contacts has seen them through periods of 
drought in their desert homeland since the 
dawn of time.
In the United States, multicultural customers 
often feel ignored. Even if they find products 
and services they need through advertise-
ments, they often don’t know where to look 
for businesses that know how to meet their 
unique needs and are willing to treat them with 
sensitivity to their culture. When they find one 
of these rare entities, word spreads fast.
As an example of the power of viral marketing, 
take a look at Daly City, California, just south 
of San Francisco. Thirty years ago, about 95 
percent of the homes in Daly City were owned 
by Caucasian families. As home prices started 
shooting up in San Francisco, many new immi-
grant Filipinos were priced out of the market 
and started looking for more affordable areas.
One Filipino family settled in Daly City because 
of its close proximity to San Francisco and 
because the price was right. These early set-
tlers told their friends and family, and as of this 
writing, Filipinos are now the largest group 
in Daly City, comprising nearly one third of 
the population. This is the power of personal 
endorsements.

282
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
 
In Chapter 5, we talk about the importance of setting a target prior to launch-
ing any marketing or advertising campaign and then tracking your results. The 
same applies to tracking the results of your referrals. You need to know what 
works and what doesn’t so you can do more of what works and less of what 
doesn’t. You can track your results by surveying new customers to find out 
how they heard about you or by having your frontline staff ask customers and 
tally the results, or both. Most retailers use a point-of-sale computerized track-
ing system that can be adapted to track referrals.
2. Set the stage
 
One of the best ways to overcome the feeling that asking for a referral puts 
your customer “on the spot” is to let your customer know from the beginning 
that you’re going to ask for referrals:
 
 Tell clients that you intend to satisfy them so well that they’ll want to 
refer three new clients to you after working with you. This makes it 
clear that you’re planning on taking very good care of them and that, in 
return, you expect referrals.
 
 Tell your customers that you measure your success by the number of 
referrals you get from satisfied customers.
 
 When you hand your business card to customers, give them two — one 
so they’ll remember you and a second for their friends and family who 
may need your product or service. Be sure to explain that this is the 
reason you’re giving them two cards. (Flip to Chapter 8 for the basics of 
exchanging business cards with multicultural customers.)
These tactics set up the expectation that you’re going to ask for referrals and 
get customers thinking, from the very start of your relationship, who else 
could use your product or service.
3. Earn your referrals with 
the best service possible
Referrals don’t come from the generosity of your customers — you have to 
earn them, or at least earn the right to ask for them. Give your clients extra-
special service and follow-up support to earn the right to ask for referrals. 
When they see how much effort you’re investing in helping them, they’ll feel 
obligated to return the favor. This is especially true of clients from other cul-
tures who not only want you to tell them how valuable they are, but also to 
show them. (For details on how to go the extra mile to serve your customers, 
see Chapter 14.)

283
 Chapter 15: Generating Word-of-Mouth Referrals
4. Ask and ye shall receive
Most companies just wait for customers to refer them, thinking that if they 
provide stellar customer service, this will happen automatically. Frankly, 
many people are too busy or simply forget to talk up your great product or 
service, so you must remind them to be alert to opportunities to refer you. 
By asking for a referral, you often do your multicultural customers a favor:
 
 It’s an ego boost for them to know more than their friends do about a 
product or service.
 
 They can help others with a referral. In collectivist cultures (which we 
introduce in Chapter 3), assisting others is considered an honorable duty.
 
 A referral gives your customer the opportunity to pay you back for the 
service you provided them.
 
Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Mexican customers are extremely loyal and 
may automatically refer friends and family, assuming you provide great prod-
ucts and service. Gratitude also carries value as evidence of good quality and 
worthy purpose, so be sure to acknowledge the favor of a good referral in an 
appropriate manner. Later in this chapter we show you how.
 
After you’ve gotten into the habit of asking for and getting referrals, it can 
become addictive, but asking too often can be the kiss of death. It can make 
you seem pushy and over-aggressive.
Try to get a feel for how much is too much. It’s like a kid who persists in asking 
her father to buy her an ice-cream cone on a hot day. After a while she starts to 
see impatience growing on his face, so she backs off. Later she asks again when 
the mood is right and she is much more likely to obtain the object of her desire.
5. Assist customers in identifying referrals
When customers buy stuff, they’re usually not thinking about other people 
who would benefit from the same products or services, so when you ask for 
a referral, they’re likely to say that they can’t think of anybody right now who 
could use what you’re selling. Usually, the customers aren’t lying. You asked 
if they can think of “anyone,” and the word is simply too nebulous to conjure 
up any names or faces of specific friends or family members.
 
To clear this hurdle, stimulate the customer’s imagination:
 
 Ask about people at work, at church, or whatever place you now know 
they frequent on a regular basis. After you have built relationships (as 
we explain in Chapter 9), you should know what kind of work they do, 
what they do for fun, and whatever else they do that brings them into 
contact with other people.

284
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
 
 Let your customers know the types of clients you can help. What needs 
do they have in common? This helps them identify specific people they 
can refer to you.
 
 Ask customers to look through their address books to jog their memories.
6. Work on your timing
In referrals as in sales, timing is everything. If your request is too early or too 
late, it’s likely to make you feel awkward and your customers uncomfortable. 
The right timing varies depending on the type of sale and customer. In the 
following sections, we describe the right timing for retail sales, service cli-
ents, and business-to-business transactions.
Hitting up retail customers for referrals
If you’re a retailer, you have four distinct opportunities to ask for referrals. 
Which one is best depends on timing and circumstances:
 
 When the customer says he doesn’t want to buy from you: This may 
seem like an odd time to ask for a referral, but it’s really the best time. 
Most salespeople are so busy being angry or disappointed that they fail 
to turn a lost sale into a future business opportunity. The prospect is 
vulnerable, probably feeling guilty for wasting your time. This is particu-
larly true when you’ve provided valuable information or had to go out 
of your way — such as getting the product out of the storeroom rather 
than just pulling it off the shelf. Every time you do something for the cus-
tomer, his psychic debt increases.
 
 When he says he’s not interested in buying, simply say something like, 
“I’ve really enjoyed working with you and would like to help others like 
you. Do you know anyone else who may want this kind of product or 
service who I can begin building a relationship with?” Watch just how 
powerful guilt can be.
 
 When you’ve earned the customer’s appreciation: You’ve earned the 
right to ask for a referral anytime a customer says, “Thank you.” This 
means you’ve done something to put them into your debt, and now they 
owe you a referral. All you need to do is simply say, “You’re very wel-
come! By the way, is there anyone you can think of who might also like 
to know this information?”
 
 When you’ve just closed the sale: Everything leading up to the purchase 
decision usually generates a lot of tension and misgiving, but after your 
customers make a decision, they should feel relaxed and relieved. They’re 
happy with their decision and are often in the mood to refer friends and 
family members. As you’re ringing up the purchase, running their credit 
card, or going through the contract, you have a golden opportunity to ask 
whether they know anyone else who also needs your product or service.

285
 Chapter 15: Generating Word-of-Mouth Referrals
 
 When you delivered the product as promised: Some products can be 
brought right out of the storeroom or off the shelf pretty quickly after clos-
ing the transaction, making your request for an introduction simultaneous 
with delivery.
 
 However, if some time passes between purchase and delivery, such as 
with cars, houses, boats, and custom items like high-end tennis rac-
quets, musical instruments, and other items, make delivery a special 
occasion with much fanfare and celebration. In addition to making this a 
special moment and confirming that the customer made the right deci-
sion, this is an excellent opportunity to ask for referrals.
Obtaining referrals from service clients
If you provide services to your clients (for example, as an attorney, financial 
planner, real estate agent, dentist, or doctor), you establish a more personal 
relationship with your clients. This slightly changes the right time to ask for a 
referral, but you still have four opportunities:
 
 When the client says he doesn’t need or want your services: In this 
case, the client isn’t simply saying no to a toaster or whatever you 
sell, but he’s saying no to you. Remaining in the right frame of mind to 
request a referral in the face of this kind of rejection is very difficult, 
indeed, but again, this is one of the best times to ask for a referral. Why? 
Because the person is likely to feel guilty for having wasted your time.
 
 When the client says he’s not interested in using your services, you can 
simply say something like, “I’ve really enjoyed getting to know you and 
would like to help others like you. Do you know anyone else who may 
need this kind of service?” Again, guilt is a great motivator.
 
 When the client says “thank you”: Clients often say “thank you” when 
they can think of no other way to show their appreciation. Give them a 
better way to show their appreciation by asking for a referral.
 
 When the client signs a contract: When a client finally agrees to a rela-
tionship, they almost always feel a sense of relief and commitment. This 
is a great time to ask whether they know anyone else who would appre-
ciate knowing about the same service.
 
 When the relationship ends: Service relationships always come to an 
end eventually because the client no longer needs the service or other 
factors. At this point, they should feel a bit sad about the “breakup” and 
be in the mood to give a referral.
Gathering referrals from related businesses
One often-overlooked source of referrals is other businesses that your cus-
tomers are likely to patronize. Start by making a list of people or businesses 
that sell complementary products and services. If you sell athletic shoes, for 

286
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
example, you can develop relationships with health clubs, running clubs, 
basketball teams, or foot doctors. Try to think of any type of business with 
which you share clients.
 
To remind your business associates to send referrals your way, design special 
coupons or cards that they can give to their customers. To keep tabs on who’s 
sending you the most referrals, add the name of the referring party or busi-
ness to your coupons or cards. As an added incentive, you may agree to pay 
your associates a flat fee for referrals or a percentage of the initial sale. You 
can also refer customers back to them, which is often more than enough com-
pensation for their referrals.
7. Offer incentives
We strongly recommend that you offer an incentive to both the referrer (the 
person giving the referral) and the refer-ee (the person being referred). Such an 
incentive encourages your customer to give the referral in the first place and 
encourages the prospect to follow up by calling you or visiting your business. 
Consider the following:
 
 Offer a discount to your customers for sending referrals your way. 
Perhaps you can offer a 10 percent discount off their next purchase or a 
flat fee for referrals.
 
 Offer a free trial or sample to the referred party to encourage the person 
to actually visit your store or try your product or service.
One dentist that I (Michael) saw many years ago would give anyone you 
referred a free teeth cleaning. This was nice, but there was no incentive for 
the referring party to make the referral. A dental patient can easily represent 
tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of business over a lifetime. Would it have 
hurt the dentist to give the referring party $50 credit for the referral?
 
To increase the response rate, add an expiration date to your special offer. If 
you give them forever to come in, they’ll just keep putting it off until they lose 
the card or coupon.
8. Contact referrals with care
How you approach prospects whom customers refer to you is crucial both in 
preserving your relationship with the referring customers and turning new 
prospects into customers. This is especially true when you’re dealing with 
customers from other cultures. Take the following approach:

287
 Chapter 15: Generating Word-of-Mouth Referrals
 
1. Ask for a referral, as we describe earlier in this chapter.
 
2. Ask for an introduction.
 
 Ideally, your customer calls the person he’s referring to let her know 
you’ll be contacting her. In collectivist cultures, this kind of “introduc-
tion” is essential.
 
3. Promise your customer that you’re going to contact the referred party.
 
 This promise is key, as you see in the next step.
 
4. Contact the referred party and introduce yourself.
 
 Say something like, “This is John Smith from the ABC Company. I prom-
ised your (friend, relative, co-worker, whoever) Sam Jones that I would 
call you.” This starts your relationship by fulfilling a promise, which tells 
this potential customer that she’s important.
 
Asians feel so strongly about referrals that they often offer to personally intro-
duce their friends and family to a salesperson. Hispanics treat a trusted busi-
nessperson as a member of the family. You’ll never have a deeper business 
relationship than one in which you’ve both educated a customer and been 
educated by them about their culture.
Bestowing Closing Gifts That Keep 
on Giving . . . to You, That Is
Giving customers a gift as they walk out the door with their purchase not 
only presents you with an opportunity to ask for referrals, but also provides 
your customers with a constant reminder of how well you’ve served them.
When I (Michael) worked for a guitar store, we gave customers a plastic 
guitar pick with the name of our store printed on it. It was a small gesture, 
but customers appreciated these inexpensive picks, which also reminded 
them where to shop every time they played their guitar. If you sell more 
expensive items, such as furniture, cars, or houses, give customers a gift 
when their furniture is delivered, they drive off in their car, or they receive 
the keys to their new home.
 
Over the course of our combined 70 years in sales, we’ve given every con-
ceivable closing gift imaginable, including books, CDs, refrigerator magnets, 
door knockers, cook sets, and portable barbecues. The best gifts, however, 
are those that regularly remind customers that you’re their salesperson for 
life and will work hard to earn their repeat business and any referrals they 
can send your way. A gift that doesn’t satisfy this paramount requirement 

288
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
is a waste of money. Consumables, like wine, for example, often fail the test 
because after the wine is gone and the bottle is pitched in the trash, memo-
ries of you fade along with it.
Closing gifts don’t have to be expensive. For example, an athletic shoe store 
could provide a small laminated card with tips on how to care for shoes 
along with the company’s name and phone number or Web site. For larger 
purchases, the best closing gifts come with personalized plaques and are 
appropriate to the item purchased. For example, if a customer purchased an 
expensive kitchen remodeling job, a nice utensil set could be appropriate.
When shopping for closing gifts, be aware of certain cultural sensitivities. 
The following guidelines can be useful in choosing the right gifts and avoiding 
the wrong ones for customers from certain cultures:
 
 Chinese: Avoid giving watches or clocks, which remind them of the winding 
down of life or of funerals. Green plants are a sign of health and longevity.
 
 Chinese and Japanese: Avoid giving knives, scissors, or other cutlery, 
because these items could symbolize the severing of the relationship. 
Sets of cooking utensils (no knives) are a much more appropriate gift.
 
 Asians: Avoid giving anything that comes in a four-pack to customers 
from most Asian cultures, because the number 4 is often considered bad 
luck. Packaging products in eights would be especially auspicious. Note 
that the 2008 Olympics in China officially began on August 8 at 8 p.m.
 
 Filipinos: Avoid giving anything that comes in a three-pack. Three is 
an unlucky number for people from the Philippines. In this culture, the 
number 7 tends to be lucky.
 
 Hispanics: Avoid giving Hispanics gifts that are cheap imitations of 
Latin art or culture. An appropriate inexpensive thank-you gift would 
be a laminated bilingual card with information related to your product 
or service. Hispanics love cooking, so items for the kitchen are always a 
thoughtful gift, such as a set of kitchen tools up to a top-end cookware 
set. Try to find a way to personalize the container or holder. Also, books 
about Hispanic culture are usually very much appreciated. Contact a 
local Hispanic gift store for more ideas.
 
 African Americans: A notepad or magnet with Black images or religious 
sayings along with your company information would be a thoughtful 
reminder of their experience with you. Closing gifts for larger purchases 
could include African figurines, art, and tapestries that you can find at 
many African and African American gift stores. In addition, books about 
African and African American culture are usually valued gifts. Avoid 
giving Blacks anything that would allude to slavery, such as Civil War or 
Confederacy memorabilia.

289
 Chapter 15: Generating Word-of-Mouth Referrals
 
 Middle Easterners: Small pieces of jewelry with Roman glass are highly 
valued, and fabric bookmarks are thoughtful gifts. Avoid gifts made out 
of wood because Middle Easterners don’t think it has much value. Also, 
don’t give liquor to Muslims because it violates their religion.
 
 Native Americans: Coffee mugs with Native American blessings and 
woven computer mouse pads with Native American images can be given. 
Avoid gifts that portray Native Americans as savages or uncivilized.
 
 Western Europeans: Books and crystal dishes and vases can make good 
gifts if they’re appropriate to your customers. Those that celebrate 
their heritage are especially appreciated. Inexpensive gifts may include 
American-made candy and other confections. Avoid anything cheaply 
made or imitations of quality European goods.
 
The best gifts are the most thoughtful. As you meet with customers and dis-
cover more about them and their families, an idea for the perfect gift is likely 
to appear almost magically. This gift carries more meaning because it shows 
you cared enough to listen and get to know them as individuals.
 
Never go overboard with your gift giving. Giving an obviously expensive gift 
for a relatively small purchase can make the customer suspicious and may 
even cause her to rethink her purchase. An extravagant gift for a large pur-
chase may cause a buyer to wonder just how much you made on the transac-
tion. It’s always better to be thoughtful than to be flashy with closing gifts.
Staying in Touch with Your Customers
The best resource you have for expanding your business and boosting sales 
is your current customers. They represent two sources of business — return 
buyers and referrals. Yet, after the first sale, many salespeople completely 
ignore the golden opportunities that their customers and clients represent.
 
We strongly encourage you to keep in touch with past customers. This doesn’t 
mean you constantly harass them with sales calls or requests for referrals. It 
simply means you let them know you’re thinking about them. In the process, 
you gently remind them that you still exist. You always want to be on the top 
of their minds whenever they or someone they know needs what you provide. 
Keep in touch but make sure everything is soft sell, if you choose to sell at all. 
Following are some ideas on how to keep in touch with your customers:
 
 Call them. I (Ralph) have created what I like to call my Hour of Power. I 
devote one solid hour per day (five to six days a week) placing calls to 
100 people I know, most of whom are clients. I follow two rules: (1) No 
distractions and (2) No selling.

290
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
 
 If you have information about the people you’re calling (birthdays, kids’ 
birthdays, anniversaries, and so on), you can mention those. If you’re in 
real estate, you can call and remind customers to perform certain main-
tenance tasks (in season), such as checking the filters on their furnaces. 
You can even call around the holidays to give them a special greeting 
(see the appendix for a list of holidays in other cultures).
 
 Write them. Send a card or note letting your customers know you’re 
thinking about them. If you have their birthdays, anniversaries, and 
other special dates recorded in your database, your job is much easier.
 
 Send them a token of your appreciation. Send your best customers 
a token of your appreciation — an inspirational book, flowers, candy, 
cookies, whatever you think they would enjoy. For more about gift 
giving, see the earlier section “Bestowing Closing Gifts That Keep on 
Giving . . . to You, That Is.”
 
 Send a newsletter. You can do this via e-mail or snail mail. Make sure 
it provides valuable, relevant information. If you sell running shoes, for 
example, you can provide information on the latest development in foot-
wear, nutrition for runners, upcoming races, and more. For more infor-
mation on keeping in touch via newsletters, check out Advanced Selling 
For Dummies (Wiley).
 
 Distribute an announcement. If you have information about products or 
services that your customers may find useful, let them know about it via 
your newsletter or a special announcement. Your announcement could 
relate to any of the following:
 
• Changes that affect your product or service, including recalls
 
• New accessories, services, or upgrades
 
• Related products or services
 
• Upcoming sales, discounts, or rebates
 
• Any information that would make their use of your product or 
service more enjoyable or efficient
 
Always have a valid reason to contact your customers. It really doesn’t matter 
if you have good news or bad, as long as you’re providing a valuable service. 
Although it’s obviously better if you have good news, even giving bad news 
earns the right to a referral. For instance, if you call to let them know that their 
product has been recalled, it’s still a valuable service for which they should be 
appreciative. Go ahead and ask for a referral.
 
If a multicultural customer invites you to his home for dinner, drop everything 
and go. This is one of the highest honors you can receive from a multicultural 
customer and really says that he trusts you. Establishing a personal relation-
ship with customers is one of the best ways to earn referrals.

a Diverse Sales Team
In This Chapter
 Identifying the many benefits of diversifying your staff
 Finding, screening, and interviewing cross-cultural candidates
 Keeping your multicultural staff happy and highly motivated
 Making your business more attractive to workers from other cultures
M
ost salespeople and business owners find that a team-based approach 
enables them to accomplish more in less time, and that the increase 
in sales and profits more than covers the expense of managing a team. 
Working as a team enables you to focus on what you do best and love most, 
while your fellow team members specialize in their own areas of expertise.
If a team-based approach appeals to you, consider making your team cultur-
ally diverse to really ramp up your sales. In addition to looking for people 
who have the requisite skills and experience to fill certain positions, look for 
people whose cultural backgrounds can improve your company’s ability to 
serve your multicultural marketplace.
In this chapter, we reveal the challenges and benefits of building and main-
taining a multicultural sales team and show you how to do it.
 
Hiring salespeople from diverse cultures isn’t an absolute necessity because 
minorities don’t necessarily want to be served by one of their own. Having a 
culturally diverse staff, however, can bring language and cultural skills into 
the company as well as show that your company welcomes differences. Just 
seeing people of color on your sales staff assures minorities that your estab-
lishment is probably going to understand their needs.

292
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
Deciding Whether a Cross-Cultural 
Sales Team Is Right for You
The promise of being able to do more and earn more while investing less 
time and effort is certainly an attractive proposition, but it’s not the right 
move for every organization. If you’re already having trouble drumming up 
enough business to make ends meet or you’re unable to relinquish some 
control over how you run your business, trying to build and manage a sales 
team may be catastrophic.
To assist you in determining whether a cross-cultural sales team is right for 
you, in the following sections, we define multicultural sales team, list the many 
benefits you can reap from creating a diverse sales force, and describe condi-
tions in which a team-based approach could lead to disaster.
Defining “multicultural sales team”
When most people hear the term multicultural, they immediate think minority, 
but a multicultural sales team is composed of staff with diverse backgrounds. 
To have the greatest power, it must represent a cross-section of all cultures, 
including Caucasians.
 
The challenges that Whites have selling to multicultural customers can be the 
same as for multicultural salespeople selling to Whites. Working together, the 
members of a multicultural sales team can help each other increase sales to 
customers from all cultures.
Grasping the benefits of team diversity
Hiring minorities, as you find out in the following sections, not only dem-
onstrates your commitment to the multicultural marketplace, but can also 
assist you in building a fundamentally sound business entity that’s much 
more capable of remaining competitive in the ever-evolving global market.
Projecting a diversity-friendly image
In Chapter 7, we encourage you to build a diversity-friendly business from 
the ground up so everything about your business — from your product line 
to your signage to your office décor — reinforces the message that you’re 
committed to serving your multicultural clientele. Part of that includes creat-
ing a staff that reflects your multicultural demographic.

293
 Chapter 16: Building, Managing, and Retaining a Diverse Sales Team
 
Everyone has heard the old cliché that a picture is worth a thousand words. 
When you hire minorities, you’re painting a portrait of your business that con-
veys a very subtle, yet powerful message that you welcome customers of all 
races and cultural backgrounds.
Adding new ways of thinking
People from other cultures naturally have a different perspective, and you 
can harness that difference to fuel creative sparks. Creativity experts often 
recommend expanding your mind by placing yourself in a totally new envi-
ronment. You’ve probably noticed that when you hold sales meetings off-site, 
everyone suddenly becomes much more creative. The new atmosphere chal-
lenges your old habits and ways of thinking.
One way to place yourself in a totally new environment is to create it your-
self by hiring multicultural personnel, including sales and support staff. In 
addition to creating a new environment, this also puts you in a position to be 
more open to different ideas.
Adding unique skills and talents
People from other countries and cultures have different skills, talents, and 
knowledge that can help everyone in your company become more knowl-
edgeable and productive. They know which products and services appeal 
to people from their culture and how to market those products and services 
most effectively.
Making your business more flexible
The rate of change is constantly accelerating. How successful your busi-
ness is at adapting to and capitalizing on changes in your marketplace often 
hinges on your staff’s diversity. By increasing diversity, you improve your 
chances of surviving and even thriving whenever market conditions change. 
If, for example, sales of some products to your traditional clientele begin to 
fall, staff members from other cultures may offer suggestions on how to make 
up the lost revenue by increasing sales in certain ethnic markets.
 
We often encourage salespeople to develop and implement systems to make 
their businesses run more efficiently and improve customer service. A system, 
however, can easily turn into a rut that prevents you from changing course 
when external factors demand a change. By hiring minorities and listening to 
what they have to say, you can often spot changes and opportunities earlier 
and shift direction more quickly.
Making your business more global
In today’s global economy, your organization must be able to speak other lan-
guages and understand the mind-set of people who live and work outside the 

294
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
U.S. By hiring people with different cultural backgrounds, you increase your 
pool of international resources so you’re better prepared to take advantage 
of worldwide opportunities, not just those in your own backyard.
Many businesses are unaware of global opportunities until they have staff 
members who have the skills and experience to capitalize on those oppor-
tunities. You may be surprised at the unique prospects, such as partnership 
opportunities with overseas businesses, that appear seemingly out of thin air 
when you begin diversifying your staff.
Knowing when to say no to 
a team-based approach
 
A team-based approach to selling isn’t appropriate for everyone. In some 
cases, it can be downright disastrous. If you’re not very good at delegating 
tasks and trusting team members to accomplish them, for example, you’re 
likely to see high turnover. Also, if you don’t have enough business to keep 
everyone busy (and paid), you could run into financial trouble.
Before you start building your team, make sure conditions are right:
 
 You have more business and opportunities than you have the time and 
resources to pursue.
 
 Systems and step-by-step instructions are in place that make it easier to 
train new team members.
 
 You have a system in place to welcome and integrate workers 
from other cultures into your team. See the later section, “Making 
Multicultural Employees Feel at Home,” for more information.
 
 You are able to delegate instead of acting like a control freak.
 
 You have enough cash in reserve to compensate new team members for 
at least two months so they have time to generate sufficient revenue to 
cover their costs.
By having all of these conditions in place, you significantly improve your 
chances of success.
Staffing Your Cross-Cultural Sales Team
If you thought that finding qualified applicants from your own culture was 
a challenge, you probably think it’s nearly impossible to find qualified can-
didates from other cultures. You may have no idea of how to begin your 
search, where to look for qualified candidates, or how to evaluate them.

295
 Chapter 16: Building, Managing, and Retaining a Diverse Sales Team
Fortunately, we’ve got you covered. In the following sections, we show you 
how to advertise openings, screen for qualified candidates, and then inter-
view the best of the best.
Advertising positions on your team
Perhaps the greatest challenge you’re likely to face is getting qualified can-
didates from other cultures to apply for openings. If you’re shaking the 
usual bushes, you’re going to get the usual job seekers. To find people from 
different backgrounds, you need to change where and how you advertise 
openings. In the following sections, we offer some guidance to improve your 
chances of attracting the right people.
 
Avoid advertising in the native language of applicants you’re trying to attract 
unless you have personnel in management or human resources who speak 
the language. Otherwise, you’re likely to attract applicants who falsely assume 
that you speak their language. By advertising in English and specifying that 
you’re looking for bilingual candidates, you attract candidates you can talk to.
Spreading the word
The easiest, least expensive, and most effective way to let people know about 
job openings within your company is through word-of-mouth advertising:
 
 Post a notice in your office or store. If your multicultural clientele and 
current employees like and trust you, they’ll want their friends and 
family members working for you, too.
Can’t find a willing salesperson?
Perhaps the biggest challenge you face when 
you decide to diversify your sales team is find-
ing people of other cultures who are eager to 
go into sales. Many new immigrants, like many 
people who grew up in America, have the 
American dream of securing a steady job with a 
large company. They want a steady income they 
can rely on for themselves and their families.
As a salesperson, you know that a sales career 
can be feast or famine. Your income can be 
unpredictable, but the entrepreneurial drive to 
score big sales and huge commissions keeps 
you going. You know that your income from 
sales can be much higher than what you can 
expect from a job that offers a guaranteed 
salary. Many immigrants, however, would much 
rather have a steady income they can count on 
when they first arrive here.
As new immigrants become more acculturated, 
they’re more likely to consider sales positions. 
Certainly their children and their children’s chil-
dren are just as likely as anyone else to go into 
sales as a career.

296
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
 
 Let community and church leaders know about any openings. They 
have a vested interest in helping find employment for people within their 
circle of influence and are usually the unofficial centers of influence and 
information in most multicultural communities. (See Chapter 5 for details 
on becoming involved with your multicultural clientele’s community.)
 
Transform your multicultural customers and employees into headhunters 
by offering them an incentive — perhaps a finder’s fee, points to redeem for 
prizes, free trips, or other perks. Consider tying these bonuses to the date on 
which a referral is hired. You also can offer a retention bonus to be paid after 
your new team member has been employed for six months or a year or both.
Reaching out to the multicultural workforce
In the U.S., many organizations help workers from other cultures find gainful 
employment. Use their efforts to your advantage by doing the following:
 
 Sponsor or participate in career fairs geared toward different ethnic 
groups. To find career fairs in your area, contact your local chamber of 
commerce or the local unemployment office.
 
 Develop internship programs that solicit applicants with different 
cultural backgrounds. Get started by identifying possible positions for 
interns and developing training materials for bringing them on board. 
Then contact local colleges, universities, and even high schools to find 
out if they have internship programs.
Choosing effective media
 
In Chapter 5, we point out that new immigrants may not read the same news-
papers, watch the same TV shows, or tune in to the same radio stations as 
longtime U.S. citizens. To reach this audience, you need to advertise openings 
in the media these job seekers read, watch, and listen to:
 
 Community newsletters.
 
 Church bulletins.
 
 Newspapers and other media that specifically serve the new-immigrant 
populations. (Asians seem to prefer to read newspapers for information, 
as opposed to listening to the radio or watching television.)
 
 Community-based cable television channels. (Many Hispanics watch 
Spanish-language television and listen to Spanish-language radio sta-
tions. Although they may speak English, many prefer Spanish-language 
media depending on their level of acculturation.)
 
 On your Web site, on the Web sites of media channels geared toward the 
minorities you’re trying to attract, and on job search engines including 
CareerBuilder.com, Monster.com, and Craigslist.com. (This approach is 
particularly effective if you’re seeking tech-savvy applicants.)

297
 Chapter 16: Building, Managing, and Retaining a Diverse Sales Team
Choosing the right words, images, and features
When designing your ad or notice, follow the same principles you practiced 
when broadening your marketing campaign for the multicultural marketplace 
(see Chapter 5). In particular, keep the following guidelines in mind:
 
 If your ad contains photos of people, make sure to include people from 
the culture you’re trying to attract.
 
 Avoid making emotional pitches such as “You’ll love this job!” when 
trying to attract Asian applicants, who typically consider it poor taste 
to display emotions in public and tend not to respond well to emotional 
pitches. Any attempt to use an “American” viewpoint about work for 
Asians is likely to fall on deaf ears and may well be counterproductive.
 
 To appeal to Asians, consider emphasizing the longevity, reputation, 
quality, and reliability of your company, if applicable. Boldly stating that 
your work environment is “the latest” and “cutting edge” won’t attract 
people from a 5,000-year-old culture. Some may even find it humorous.
 
 To appeal to Hispanics, think about stressing your company’s family 
atmosphere. Foster a collaborative environment where people work 
together for the good of all the employees, and then advertise the fact.
 
 To appeal to African Americans, accentuate the uniqueness of your 
products and services and even your compensation plan, if appropri-
ate. Don’t use the word “traditional” or similar words because they may 
imply adherence to past discriminatory policies.
 
 To appeal to Asian Indians, consider using Indian models in ads showing 
families. They also appreciate name brands and well-known companies.
 
 To attract Native Americans, stress how environmentally sensitive your 
organization is and any green building initiatives you have in place.
 
 When advertising an opening, include the location. Many applicants 
from other cultures prefer to work locally, and they often seek compa-
nies that are close to their homes so they can spend more time with 
their families.
 
 If you have a liberal vacation or holiday package, highlighting such fea-
tures can win you the loyalty of most immigrant groups. Many regularly 
work 14 to 16 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week. Time is at a premium 
for these folks, and they often feel guilty about not being able to spend 
more time with their families, especially the children.
 
 Avoid using words that may be considered discriminatory. Verify with 
your advertising representative that seemingly innocent words don’t 
violate antidiscrimination laws. You can’t use words that imply dis-
crimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, 
sexual preference, or physical handicap. For example, an ad should not 
say “salesman,” but rather use “sales clerk” or “salesperson.” Obviously 
anything like “Hispanics preferred” or “Asians preferred” should also be 
avoided.

298
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
 
A little personal research with members of the ethnic communities you hope 
to reach can go a long way toward developing effective marketing plans to 
reach potential employees from diverse cultures. In Chapter 2, we recommend 
assembling a multicultural advisory board for your business.
Adding incentives for language skills
Many companies offer a bonus for workers with language skills, regardless of 
their ethnic or cultural background. This can not only entice bilingual people 
to apply for work with you, but also may encourage current workers to 
improve their ability to speak your customers’ language. Consult an employ-
ment law specialist about how to establish such a program. Consider starting 
your search through the American Bar Association (www.abanet.org/
lawyerlocator/searchlawyer.html).
 
If you’re looking for salespeople with language skills, make sure they speak 
the right kind of language. Some may be able to speak “street Spanish” or 
“common Chinese,” but these may be inappropriate for business.
Screening and interviewing 
potential candidates
You probably have a system in place for screening out unqualified applicants 
and then interviewing the best of the bunch. However, the system and crite-
ria you’re using may be less effective in selecting multicultural candidates. In 
the following sections, we highlight some of the most important differences 
in the screening and interviewing processes and offer some guidance on how 
to more effectively screen and interview multicultural candidates.
Accounting for resume deflation
In the United States, padding your résumé is almost a national pastime. 
Someone who spent ten years at the local one-hour photo lab is likely to pres-
ent herself as having a decade’s worth of experience in the “film industry.” A 
janitor may claim to have five years’ experience as a “sanitary engineer.” A 
secretary applying for a management position may claim to have worked as 
the “office manager.”
 
While inflating one’s résumé in the U.S. is part of the game, many minorities 
don’t play by the same rules. In fact, Asians, in particular, are more likely to 
understate their skills and experience, because humility is expected in their 
culture. As a result, you can often make the mistake of dismissing superior 
candidates simply because they choose not to toot their own horns.
If the résumé or application looks professional and meets the education, 
skills, and experience required but doesn’t exactly dazzle you, consider set-
ting up an interview to find out more about the person.

 Chapter 16: Building, Managing, and Retaining a Diverse Sales Team
Assessing candidates fairly
In the U.S., many employers rely on the phone interview to screen out the 
worst of the applicants who appear to qualify on paper. The phone interview 
is quick and easy and allows you to reject people without having to look 
them in the eye. However, this method can often and unfairly screen out 
highly qualified multicultural applicants.
In Chapter 11 and the appendix, we highlight the fact that different cultures 
prefer different communication styles. Unless you’re hiring telemarketers, judg-
ing them solely on how well they communicate over the phone can be a mistake.
 
To obtain a fair assessment of a candidate’s skills and abilities during the 
interview, give him several opportunities to demonstrate what he knows and 
can do for you. Some applicants are likely to shine on paper (résumé or appli-
cation). Others are going to sound better over the phone. Some can be much 
more convincing in person. Here are some culture-specific differences that can 
influence your assessment:
 
 African Americans tend to be more comfortable with verbal communica-
tions and generally have an advantage in phone interviews.
 
 Hispanics often prefer to demonstrate their skills. To give them a fair 
chance, set up situations in which you can test their ability to perform 
specific tasks that the position requires.
 
 Asians are often less verbal and more comfortable showing on paper what 
they’ve accomplished and can do. Give applicants a chance to show you 
samples of their work or pictures of projects they’ve completed.
Nepotism . . . you gotta love it!
Hiring family and friends (nepotism) is a time-
honored tradition in many collectivist cultures 
(see Chapter 6 for a definition of collectivist). 
However, this practice is frowned on in the 
United States because we like to be considered 
on our individual merits, not for who we know.
Obviously you must comply with equal oppor-
tunity employment laws, but companies that 
follow legal guidelines to hire the family and 
friends of current workers find that this practice 
can increase retention. After all, why leave a 
company when it literally is like family?
Hiring relatives of minority workers can also 
increase performance through peer pressure. 
Honor plays a major role in many cultures. 
If a person works for the same company that 
employs his aunt and three of his cousins, he’s 
much more likely to show up on time, put in a 
good day’s effort, and perhaps even work a little 
harder thanks to friendly competition.

Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
Managing and Retaining Multicultural 
Employees
Employees from other cultures often have needs and expectations that differ 
from those of the traditional American workforce. They may value time 
more than money, be a little less direct in communicating their needs, and 
rely much more on their relationships with supervisors for more than job 
approval. In the following sections, we highlight some of the most common 
areas in which supervisors encounter the greatest challenges and offer some 
suggestions about how to proactively overcome any hurdles.
Accommodating a different work ethic
New immigrants are used to working long hours and even weekends just 
to survive in their home country. This work ethic becomes so ingrained 
that when they come to the United States, they have trouble adjusting to a 
40-hour work week with weekends and holidays off. This can cause friction 
with longtime residents of the U.S. who may feel that their cross-cultural co-
workers are trying to make them look like slackers.
You can’t do much, nor would you probably want to, to discourage team 
members from working hard. You and other members of your team may just 
need to deal with an extended transition period in which you all catch the 
new work ethic while your team members from other cultures become accus-
tomed to Americans’ more leisurely lifestyle.
Treating all employees equal, but different
Treating all team members fairly is important, both legally and ethically, but 
fairly doesn’t mean treating them the same. Just as you need to accommo-
date differences among customers, you need to make adjustments for differ-
ences among staff members. Some may not be completely fluent in English. 
Others may not be comfortable with American culture. By making the effort 
to accommodate differences, you express your appreciation in tangible ways, 
which can often increase job satisfaction and retention rates. What kinds of 
differences are we talking about? Here are a couple of examples:
 
 People from some cultures often expect to have a more personal rela-
tionship with their supervisor or manager. They may invite her to their 
house for dinner, parties, or even special occasions like weddings. 
Accepting these invitations and extending your own invitations can 
significantly improve loyalty to your company or business.

301
 Chapter 16: Building, Managing, and Retaining a Diverse Sales Team
 
 Hispanics often want to be personally greeted every morning and bade 
goodbye every evening as a sign of friendship and respect. Like Asians, 
they may invite co-workers and supervisors to family events.
 
Observe how team members from the same culture interact with one another 
and how they try to interact with you. If they invite you to a special occa-
sion, chances are pretty good that they’d like you to accept the invitation and 
return the favor. If you still can’t figure out how they want to be treated, ask.
Dealing with different 
communication styles
You can often observe different communication styles at work in close 
male-female relationships. Almost without exception, one of the individuals 
involved in the relationship is going to get frustrated to the point of saying 
something like, “I’m not a mind reader! You need to tell me what you want!”
Differences in communication styles among people of different cultures can 
stir up similar conflicts. The following sections introduce these differences 
and provide suggestions on how to minimize the negative effects that often 
result from them. (See the appendix for details on the specific communica-
tion styles of a wide variety of cultures.)
Direct communication
In America we’re fond of saying what we think and “telling it like it is.” Sure, 
we gossip. We talk behind one another’s backs. Some may even try to sabo-
tage another colleague’s career. As a culture, however, we tend to discour-
age these underhanded tactics and promote direct communication. When 
you have a conflict with a co-worker, you’re expected to confront the person 
and resolve the issue immediately. When people don’t speak their minds, 
we think they’re sneaky and underhanded. We may not believe we can trust 
them because we don’t know what they’re thinking.
Some African Americans may be even more direct than Anglo Americans. As 
a result, they may be perceived as blunt. The reality, however, is that they’re 
just at a different point on the direct communication continuum. They have a 
different culturally influenced communication style. Accept it as a difference, 
keeping in mind that people who have a very direct communication style may 
be just as uncomfortable around people who are less direct.
 
Direct communicators will generally say “I don’t know” only when they really 
don’t know the answer.

302
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
Indirect communication
In many cultures, including the Asian and Hispanic, people generally prefer 
to avoid conflict. They smile and bide their time, assuming that any issues 
will fade over time. Instead of confronting others, they may just send subtle 
signals that they’re upset and unhappy, expecting the offending party to take 
the hint and apologize.
 
Indirect communicators will usually say “I don’t know” when they don’t want 
to offend another person or if they can’t fulfill a request. They may even make 
up an answer to avoid disappointing a questioning co-worker.
Handling the two communication styles in one conversation
When direct and indirect communicators meet, sparks can really start to fly. 
The indirect communicator gets upset and won’t say what’s upsetting her, 
while the direct communicator thinks the person is secretive or even some-
what lacking in communication skills. If the direct communicator initiates a 
confrontation, the indirect communicator simply concludes that the person 
is rude and withdraws.
 
Overcoming these differences in communication styles requires a mutual 
understanding of the differences.
 
 Direct communicators need to realize that the indirect style uses innu-
endo and implication to avoid hurting others’ feelings.
 
 Indirect communicators need to realize that confrontation is simply an 
attempt to clear the air.
Neither style is superior — they’re just culturally influenced communication 
styles.
Confucius confusion
The Chinese philosopher and teacher Confucius 
lived over two millennia ago, but his teach-
ings continue to influence many Asian cultures. 
Much of what he taught promoted honor, integ-
rity, hard work, harmony, and respect for author-
ity. Students were expected to collaborate with 
others to achieve whatever was in the best inter-
est of the group and Chinese society as a whole.
Due to the influence of his teachings, Asians 
have gained a reputation (and somewhat of a 
stereotype) of being highly educated hard work-
ers. Although this is often the case, it’s certainly 
not true of all Asians, so be careful about those 
stereotypes — even the positive ones.

303
 Chapter 16: Building, Managing, and Retaining a Diverse Sales Team
Retooling your reward system
Your reward system is only as good as its ability to reward individuals with 
what they value most. Giving someone a big fat bonus for working overtime 
when they really treasure family time much more is hardly a motivator. We 
recommend that you get to know your employees on a personal level to gain 
insight into what each team member prizes most.
 
A great way to find out what each person values most is to have everyone 
create a reward collage. You can even use this as a team-building opportunity. 
Have everyone cut out pictures that represent what they’re working for and 
provide pieces of poster board and glue or tape for creating the collage. Some 
team members may dream of owning a new home or car. For others, photos of 
friends and family members will populate their collage.
Following are some suggestions for rewarding team members from other 
cultures:
 
 Say thank you. Simply saying “Thank you” makes people feel appreciated.
 
 Get to know them as people. Spend time talking about things other than 
work.
 
 Ask them directly how they want to be rewarded.
 
 Be accessible. Knowing you’re available when they need help can make 
them more comfortable.
 
 Celebrate success as a team instead of highlighting individual accom-
plishments. For example, you can take everyone on the team out for 
lunch, host a picnic or cookout for employees and their families, or 
schedule a team outing when the team meets its goals.
 
 Assess team member satisfaction levels on a regular basis. Don’t assume 
that just because employees don’t complain that they’re happy. Meet 
with team members individually on a regular basis and encourage them 
to provide feedback. You may even want to implement a system in 
which you survey team members regularly and allow them to provide 
anonymous feedback.
 
 Personalize team members’ gifts, instead of doling out generic awards, 
to show that you’ve been listening to your staff.
 
 Teach new skills or provide opportunities for continuing education and 
training.
 
 Share the reward with their family.
 
 Send them to conferences. Remember how much they value education.
 
 Let the team determine its own reward.
 
 Give team members time off to spend with their families. They may feel 
guilty about spending so much time at work.

304
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
 
 Let them attend meetings you can’t attend. This is generally viewed as a 
high honor.
 
 Consider donating to a charity that the employee feels strongly about.
 
 Use your best workers (rather than models) in printed and videotaped 
advertisements.
 
 Give them business cards with an appropriate title.
 
 Offer scholarships for attending job-related classes.
 
 Recognize them by showing up at their child’s soccer game, school play, 
or other event. How you treat your workers’ children says a lot about 
how you feel about your workers.
 
 Let them shadow a manager or co-worker they respect for a day.
 
 Invite their friends and family to see where they work and what they do. 
You can also get referrals to more staff members this way.
 
Be careful about distributing individual rewards, and be particularly careful 
about making a public spectacle of it. Although longtime residents of the U.S. 
tend to value having their individual accomplishments acknowledged in front 
of their peers, this often has the opposite effect on people from collectivist 
cultures. (For details about the differences between individualistic and col-
lectivist cultures, see Chapter 6.) If you have one or more team members from 
a collectivist culture, consider providing group awards rather than individual 
rewards. Singling out collectivist workers for praise may cause them to lose 
face, sometimes to such a degree that they quit.
Retaining multicultural employees
Keeping your best employees means keeping them happy, and for most people 
in the United States, this means five things: money, time off, benefits, recogni-
tion, and rewarding work. For employees from other cultures, those five things 
are still important, but a couple of other factors carry some significant weight:
 
 Employer/employee relationship: The most common reason multicul-
tural workers quit is because of the people they work for, not the job 
they’re doing. If you want to increase retention rates for multicultural 
employees, get to know them and work on building strong relationships. 
Treat them like family: Visit them outside of work; offer to help them 
move; if they have a problem, find out what you can do to help.
 
 Family: Many employees from other cultures work mainly to support 
their families, and when they’re not working, they’re enjoying time off 
with them. Learn the names of each employee’s spouse and children. 
Take the time to find out about challenges they’re having both on and 
off the job. Work is often an extension of family for these workers.

305
 Chapter 16: Building, Managing, and Retaining a Diverse Sales Team
 
Effective communication is also very important for retention. For example, 
studies indicate that the turnover rate for African Americans is 40 percent 
higher than for Whites. Being able to relate better to all workers can increase 
retention. Communication is two parts listening and one part talking — listen 
to what team members have to say and identify their needs.
Making Multicultural Employees 
Feel at Home
You’ve probably heard the line, “News travels fast.” Bad news travels even 
faster. This is particularly true in multicultural circles. If your company 
develops a reputation for being unfair or unfriendly to workers from a certain 
group, everyone in the community is going to know about it and do whatever 
they can to work somewhere else. To attract the best and the brightest, dem-
onstrate your commitment to your greatest resources — human resources.
The first and most important step is to get everyone in the company on 
board and educate them so everyone has a base level of cultural compe-
tency. We show you how to do this in Chapter 6. In addition to making your 
entire company culturally competent and diversity friendly, you need to pay 
special attention to creating a workplace that accommodates your multicul-
tural staff and makes them feel at home. We provide some guidance for how 
to do this in the following sections.
 
According to U.S. Department of Labor estimates, 85 percent of all new work-
ers entering the workforce are women or minorities. To tap the full potential 
of this talent pool, make your team and your company a more attractive place 
for them to work. Any company that demonstrates it values workers of all 
cultures and treats people fairly regardless of race, gender, or ethnicity will 
attract more culturally diverse workers.
Developing mentoring programs 
and support groups
Hiring team members from other cultures doesn’t guarantee that everyone 
on your team is going to mingle or that existing team members will welcome 
them with open arms. Have a system in place that encourages team members 
to interact, learn from one another, and provide mutual support:

306
Part IV: Taking Your Game to the Next Level 
 
 Mentoring programs: Assign a mentor to each new hire to help him 
become comfortable in his new environment. A mentor can provide the 
initial orientation and basic training and assist the new employee in 
advancing his career. In the process of mentoring a multicultural team 
member, the mentor naturally develops multicultural competency and 
skills of her own as well as takes on more of a leadership role.
 
 Support groups: Support groups can assist new hires with the transition 
into their new country and culture, offering everything from relocation 
resources to information on where and how to obtain additional assistance.
 
Do everything you can to fully integrate culturally diverse workers into your 
business. Merely bringing them on board without a system in place to blend 
them into your team can often lead to divisiveness and chaos. If you sense 
that your team is becoming cliquish, whatever system you have in place 
isn’t working. Call a team meeting and reinforce the importance of working 
together as a team to more effectively serve your customers.
Taking inventory
If you’ve done everything you believe possible to attract qualified multicul-
tural applicants and still find that they’re not exactly flocking to your busi-
ness to seek out opportunities, take inventory of what you’re doing and start 
asking yourself some tough questions:
 
 “Are we advertising openings in a way that reaches the multicultural 
communities?”
 
 “What are we doing or not doing to make multicultural people feel 
comfortable?”
 
 “Does our corporate culture demonstrate a commitment to integrating 
workers from other cultures into the business?”
 
 “How does our culture fit or not fit with what workers from various 
ethnic groups are looking for?”
 
 “Do we have a system in place to integrate multicultural workers into 
the business?”
 
 “What kind of professional track do we have for advancement?”
 
 “Is our compensation in line with the other opportunities for 
multicultural employees at the same skill level?”
 
 “Do we offer cultural sensitivity training that creates a welcoming 
atmosphere for diverse workers?”
When you have some honest answers to these questions, you have a pretty 
good idea of which areas you need to work on. Prioritize the list of improve-
ments you need to make, and get to it!

S
ome myths, such as the ancient Greek myths, are teaching tools that 
reveal important truths about the world and the times in which people 
live. Other myths, however, can seriously limit people’s perspectives and 
even blind them to truth. Such is the case with myths about customers and 
clients from other cultures. If you buy into these myths, you may miss out on 
some tremendous opportunities.
In this chapter, we bust the ten most common and thought-limiting myths 
related to people of other cultures.
Other Cultures Hold Beliefs That Are 
Completely Incomprehensible
This myth actually holds some truth, because in essence, all beliefs are 
incomprehensible — that’s why they’re beliefs. When you examine a belief in 
the light of truth and logic, you usually walk away completely baffled.
What’s important to remember is that all cultures have beliefs that some-
times transcend logic. Many people in the United States, for example, believe 
that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day. If you have a bit of Irish in you, you 
may think that four-leaf clovers bring good luck. Does it make any sense at 
all that a rabbit’s foot is a common good luck charm — especially for the 
rabbit?!

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Beliefs don’t have to make sense. Accept the fact that some beliefs may be 
illogical, and you should have no trouble coexisting with those who hold 
beliefs that are different from yours. Find out your customers’ beliefs and 
make the necessary adjustments, as discussed in Chapter 7.
Other Cultures Are Paranoid 
about Money
Ask a recent immigrant a seemingly innocent question about finances, such as 
“How much do you have for a down payment?” and he’s likely to break out in 
a cold sweat — or at least do everything to avoid giving you an honest answer. 
Because of this, many salespeople falsely assume that other cultures are overly 
secretive about money matters, perhaps to the point of being paranoid.
Paranoia, however, is an irrational fear. People from other cultures often 
have good reason to be afraid of disclosing information about their personal 
finances. Many don’t trust banks and are afraid that the word will get out 
about how much money they have stuffed in their mattress (or wherever 
they choose to hide it).
Asians, Hispanics, and other groups often become the targets of home-
invasion robberies for this very reason. With this crime, robbers break into 
a house and physically threaten the occupants until they reveal the where-
abouts of the valuables — usually the cash.
 
Remind customers from other cultures that they always have the option of 
paying cash, even for those big-ticket items. The money just might be burning 
a hole in their mattress.
People Don’t Want to Talk 
about Their Culture
In an attempt to avoid drawing undue attention to the fact that your cus-
tomer is different, you may be tempted to completely ignore the fact. As a 
result, you now have a 600-pound gorilla sitting between you and your cus-
tomer that neither of you has the courage to mention. This creates a cultural 
static that stands as a barrier to building true rapport.

311
 Chapter 17: Ten Myths about Customers from Other Cultures
As soon as you express a sincere interest in your customers’ cultural back-
grounds, they’re usually more than happy to tell you about their language, 
food, and even beliefs. You can ask customers how to say “hello” or even 
your name in their native tongue. You may be slightly embarrassed as you 
struggle with their language, but they’ll love you for it because then you’ll 
know how they feel trying to speak English.
 
Use what you discover to determine whether you should adjust your sales 
presentation (see Chapter 11) or products (see Chapter 7) based on your cus-
tomers’ culture and familiarity with your product or service.
People Prefer to Buy from Someone 
of Their Own Culture
Many salespeople don’t even try to cater to the multicultural marketplace, 
because they falsely assume that consumers from other cultures are com-
mitted to buying from people of a similar background. Unless consumers 
encounter a major language barrier, nothing could be further from the truth, 
as we explain in Chapter 2. Even then, if immigrant customers see that you’re 
sensitive to their culture, they’ll find a way to overcome this challenge — for 
example, by having a relative or friend act as an interpreter.
In fact, many cultural groups prefer to work with salespeople from outside 
their own culture for two reasons:
 
 Privacy: Someone from outside their culture is less likely to share their 
financial and personal information with others in their community.
 
 Acculturation: Many first- and second-generation immigrants seize 
any opportunity to practice their English and communication skills. 
One of the best ways for them to do this is by purchasing from longtime 
residents of the U.S.
If you’re not attracting multicultural customers or they shop without buying 
anything, you’re probably falling short in terms of supplying what they’re 
looking for, making them feel comfortable, or making your products and 
services appealing and easy to find. Don’t assume that they’re not buying 
because you happen to look a little different.
 
Assume that every customer wants to buy from you unless you get strong 
signals to the contrary.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
People Should Do As Americans Do 
When They’re in the United States
A good host accommodates his guests and never coerces them into following 
the house rules. If the guest uses her hands to eat fried chicken, for instance, 
the host may follow suit to make the guest feel more at home.
Most people know that this is the proper etiquette to follow, but when people 
from other countries become guests in the U.S., Americans often expect 
them to morph overnight into fully acculturated Americans who speak fluent 
English. The truth is that even though most of us have been born in this 
country, we’re the children of immigrants, and first-generation immigrants 
often require years or even decades of living here to learn the language and 
adjust to the customs of their new homeland.
 
Adjust your perspective and expectations. Imagine yourself moving to Egypt 
or China and having to learn an entirely new language, navigate a new land-
scape, eat new foods, and deal with people who have completely different 
beliefs and customs. You’d probably take quite a while to get up to speed. Be 
patient while the new arrivals make the necessary adjustments. Believe us, 
they’re trying. Night schools are packed with people from every corner of the 
world trying to learn English and to become citizens of this country.
People from Other Cultures Are Just 
Too Much Trouble to Bother With
 
We hear this statement far too often from retailers, service providers, and 
salespeople all around the country. Too bad for them, because if they knew 
how to meet the special needs of multicultural customers, most could signifi-
cantly increase their market share, sales, and profits. In addition, multicultural 
customers come with some added perks:
 
 They’re loyal.
 
 They’re more likely to refer friends and family to you if they’re satisfied.
 
 They expose you to different cultures, so you can gain the knowledge of 
a world traveler without getting seasick or losing one piece of luggage!
It doesn’t take much effort to adjust your practices to make multicultural cus-
tomers comfortable. Just follow some of the tips and techniques in this book 
and you’ll be well on your way.

313
 Chapter 17: Ten Myths about Customers from Other Cultures
I Can’t Afford to Customize Products or 
Services for Multicultural Customers
Actually, making your business attractive to people from other cultures is 
fairly easy (see Part II for details):
 
 Start with your brochures. Print them in the major languages of the 
customers who frequent your store or office. Be sure to get professional 
assistance with the translation, because many concepts and words in 
English don’t convert easily to other languages.
 
 Make sure your marketing, advertising, and informational materi-
als are printed in the correct language. While Chinese, Korean, and 
Japanese writing may appear similar to the untrained eye, they’re very 
different. Hire an expert who’s familiar with the language of your major 
group of multicultural customers as well as your specific industry.
 
 Hire a consultant to examine your store or office layout, packaging, 
signage, and other elements to ensure that your business accommo-
dates the customers you’re trying to attract. An expert can often show 
you simple and inexpensive techniques for adjusting to your expanded 
market.
 
Instead of wondering whether you can afford to accommodate multicultural 
customers, you should be asking, “Can I afford to ignore a large and growing 
number of potential customers?” Do the math. If a third of the people in your 
service area are of cultures different from your own and you’re unable to 
attract their dollars, you lose this business. And your loss is a potential wind-
fall for any competitors who put some effort into catering to these markets.
The Best Approach Is to Treat Everyone 
the Same, Regardless of Their Culture
Treating all customers equally requires more than simply treating them the 
same. Handing a menu to a customer with impaired vision certainly treats the 
person the same as you treat others, but it doesn’t provide that patron with 
equal access to the menu items. In the same way, greeting all customers the 
same way can be offensive to customers who’ve grown up in other cultures.
The best approach is to follow the Global Rule: Treat others as they would 
like to be treated. In Chapter 8, we provide some guidelines to follow that 
include following your customer’s lead and asking people about their culture 
and their preferences.

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
To avoid any appearance of discrimination, ask everyone who comes into your 
place of business about their cultural background. One of the best ways to do 
this is to subtly mention your own roots first.
People from Outside the United States 
Are Unreasonable When Negotiating
There are two types of countries in the world — negotiating and nonnegotiat-
ing. The United States is a nonnegotiating country where we generally pay 
the price asked by vendors without question. In most other countries around 
the world, people haggle on everything from groceries to clothing to homes. 
To expect someone from one of these places not to bargain is tantamount to 
asking her not to breathe.
The best way to deal with born-and-bred hagglers is to hone your own negoti-
ating skills. We offer several strategies and tips in Chapter 13.
Renegotiating After Signing 
a Contract Is Unethical
Contracts mean different things to different people. For most longtime resi-
dents of the U.S., the contract signals the end of negotiations. After the ink 
dries on the contract (and, in some cases, several days pass), all parties 
become legally bound by whatever’s in print.
However, for many people from high-context cultures (those that rely more 
on shared understandings to communicate; see Chapter 3), the contract 
often signals the beginning of a relationship that can evolve over time. As a 
result, the parties are obligated to help each other continually “adjust” the 
contract to their needs until it’s completed.
 
When dealing with customers from high-context cultures, let go of the notion 
that the contract is a legally binding document. We’re not telling you to give 
away the store. You can use any of the strategies we outline in Chapter 13 to 
curb the “nibbling” and make sure your needs are satisfied, as well.

Ten Common Stereotypes of 
Americans
In This Chapter
 Confronting the concept that all Americans tend to be provincial
 Toning down the idea that all Americans are loud and bombastic
 Busting the myth that all Americans are focused solely on short-term gains
 Dispelling the notion that all Americans are brusque in business
 Dealing with the assumption that because you’re an American, you’re rich
A
mericans often have misinformed ideas about other cultures, but we’re 
not the only ones guilty of stereotyping. People of other cultures, espe-
cially the people who don’t get to meet many U.S. citizens, have a distorted 
view of Americans as well. By becoming aware of how people from other 
countries and cultures may perceive you, you have a better chance of break-
ing through those misconceptions to develop stronger and more meaningful 
relationships with your clients. In this chapter, we reveal the common stereo-
types that other cultures often have about Americans and suggest ways that 
you can break those molds.
 
Before you can embrace people from diverse cultures, you must understand 
your own American culture and recognize that it impacts how others around the 
world view you. If one or more of the stereotypes in this chapter describes the 
way you do business, admit it, and then work toward overcoming that tendency.
Americans Are Ethnocentric
In the U.S., most of us are raised to believe that America is the best country 
on the planet, everybody in the U.S. should speak English, and Christianity is 
the one true religion. Although many U.S. citizens have sufficient experiences 
in other countries to support their beliefs that the U.S. is the best, many have 
never even crossed the border to Canada or Mexico. As a result, U.S. citizens, 
for the most part, tend to be a bit ethnocentric.

Patriotism is certainly understandable and even admirable, but cultural elit-
ism is counterproductive in building relationships and making sales. Strive 
toward becoming more open-minded and genuinely curious about the rest of 
the world. People from other cultures are always very appreciative when you 
ask questions regarding their culture or language. You may be surprised at 
just how much you can discover without leaving the country. Flip to Chapter 4 
for tips on developing your cross-cultural competency.
Americans Are Clueless about 
Other Countries and Cultures
Even Americans recognize that they’re poorly informed not only about other 
countries, but also about their own. Every month or so, a reporter heads 
out to the streets of Any Town, USA, to ask passersby basic questions about 
national and international history or geography, only to receive blank stares 
and inconceivably wrong answers. People from other countries see this and 
believe that everybody in the U.S. is completely clueless about what’s going 
on in the world.
To dispel this myth, demonstrate a genuine interest in your customers’ land 
of origin, language, and beliefs. This approach accomplishes three important 
goals:
 
 It shows that you’re interested in discovering more about other cultures.
 
 It shows that you care enough about your customers to take the time to 
find out more, specifically about them and their culture.
 
 The knowledge you acquire improves your ability to adapt to the multi-
cultural marketplace.
Americans Are Too Casual
Baby boomers ushered in a more casual lifestyle, this is true, but what con-
stitutes too casual is a cultural preference, and many people outside the U.S. 
believe Americans have crossed the line. We call each other by our first names, 
have casual dress days at work, and assume postures that slouch or lean.
 
To make your less casual customers and clients feel more comfortable, con-
sider making the following adjustments to the way you meet and greet custom-
ers (see Chapter 8 for additional guidance):

317
 Chapter 18: Ten Common Stereotypes of Americans
 
 Assume a more formal posture when meeting with multicultural pros-
pects and clientele — sit or stand upright with both feet firmly planted 
on the ground.
 
 Address people by their preferred title followed by their last name, 
unless they instruct you to do otherwise.
 
 Dress a bit more formally than your customers. Don’t forget that it 
wasn’t so long ago in this country that men would attend a baseball 
game wearing suits and ties, while women would wear dresses, hats, 
and gloves.
 
 If you’re having a meeting in which people are going to dress more 
casually, let your foreign customers know in advance about the dress 
code.
 
Posture can mean different things to different cultures. In Japan, for example, 
people who don’t sit upright with both feet flat on the floor may be perceived 
to have an unbalanced or untrustworthy character.
Americans Are Loud and Boisterous
WE ARE NOT! Ahhhh, denial is the first sign of guilt. Actually, people in the 
U.S. range from extremely reserved — sitting silently through a baseball 
game with legs crossed daintily at the ankles — to highly bombastic — shout-
ing crude remarks while sporting brightly painted faces and chests during a 
hockey game. Overall, however, compared to Asians and people from more 
demure cultures, Americans tend to be way over the top.
 
The key to appealing to people from other cultures is to err on the side of 
being more reserved — at least until you have a chance to observe the level of 
exuberance your customers exhibit. You can always scale up. Toning it down 
is tougher.
Americans Focus Only 
on Short-Term Gains
In countries that have been in existence for thousands of years, people often 
develop business and personal relationships that last for generations. These 
same folks often think that Americans tend to be rather shortsighted, looking 
to score a quick transaction and move on to the next deal.

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
When working with clients from other cultures, look at time spent socializing 
as time well spent. Whether you’re chatting about their country, sampling their 
cuisine, or visiting their family, you’re building relationships that can last for 
your lifetime and generations to come. In the process, your clients are trying to 
size you up to determine whether you and your company and your associates 
are the kind of people they want to do business with now and in the future. 
Although the initial process may take longer than you’re used to, keep in mind 
that this could save time and boost sales in the long run — when your clients 
and the people they refer begin the next transaction by trusting you. Check out 
Chapter 9 for the full scoop on building rapport with people of all cultures.
Americans Are Somewhat Brusque 
in Business Dealings
Americans tend to want to “Get ’er done,” “Get down to brass tacks,” and 
deal with the bottom line. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. It’s just 
a cultural thing. However, this approach to business, and to life in general, 
often leads people from other cultures to think of us as brusque in our busi-
ness dealings. Outside the United States, salespeople and clients usually 
engage in a lot more small talk and relationship building before they get 
down to business.
 
When you’re dealing with customers from cultures that have been around for 
thousands of years, constantly remind yourself of this fact. Japan, for example, 
has a 5,000-year-old culture, making a few hours or even days seem insignifi-
cant. Chill out.
Americans Are Overly Materialistic
The U.S. media do an outstanding job of stereotyping Americans as celebrity-
hungry material girls (and guys) with TV shows like Cribs, magazines like 
People and GQ, and music videos that glorify all the trappings of financial 
success. It’s no wonder that people from other countries view people from 
the United States as materialistic when we half-jokingly claim that “He who 
dies with the most toys wins.”
 
Whenever you’re dealing with people from other cultures and you focus atten-
tion on the bling, you’re unintentionally reinforcing this stereotype. One way 
to dilute it is to discuss other topics beyond satisfying their egos. Ask fewer 
questions about a person’s job, the car they drive, and the house they live 
in and more questions about the person’s family, interests, and activities. By 
introducing topics that focus on your customers as people, you’re likely to 
find that you’re building rapport much more quickly.

319
 Chapter 18: Ten Common Stereotypes of Americans
All Americans Are Rich
 
Thanks to television shows and movies shown around the world, many people 
have the mistaken impression that all Americans live in ten-bedroom man-
sions with solid gold water bowls for their dogs. As a result, you’re likely to 
encounter the following:
 
 Customers may assume during the negotiating phase that you can afford 
to present them with a much better offer. After all, because Americans 
are so filthy rich, surely you can afford to share a little of that wealth 
with your less affluent customers from other cultures.
 
 Prospective clients may expect you to pick up the tab. Whether you’re 
playing host in your own country or heading out to foreign lands, you’re 
likely to find yourself paying some pretty hefty bar bills.
 
The only way to dispel this common myth is to answer questions about your 
possessions honestly. People from other cultures frequently ask endless ques-
tions about how many houses you own or what kind of Mercedes you drive. 
Don’t try to impress them with your leased car or highly leveraged home — it 
can cost you dearly.
Americans Are Extravagant and Wasteful
Statistics alone have done a sufficient job of condemning the U.S. as a coun-
try of extravagance and waste. Although the U.S. accounts for less than 5 
percent of the global population, for example, it uses about a quarter of the 
world’s fossil fuels, burning up nearly 25 percent of the coal, 26 percent of 
the oil, and 27 percent of the world’s natural gas.
Of course, these statistics fail to account for the fact that the U.S. produces 
between a fifth and a third of the world’s food supply and has developed 
many of the technologies that other countries rely on to develop and main-
tain their own industries. Be that as it may, U.S. citizens probably could 
do a little more to improve their image in this category. Perhaps the grow-
ing green movement, a weakening dollar, and higher oil prices will make 
Americans less wasteful and work toward dispelling this myth.
 
Consider spearheading green policies for your company. Starting a recycling 
program, reducing your paper use, and cutting fuel consumption demon-
strates your commitment to being a responsible citizen of the world.

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Americans Believe That Time Is Money
People in the United States have a cultural tendency to highly value time and 
even commonly say, “Time is money.” Outside of our borders, people believe 
that Americans are always in a hurry because of this value. People of other 
cultures may view time differently and may believe instead that time is for 
building relationships.
 
If you really believe that time is money, you may rush business transactions 
without even realizing that you’re doing it. This can work against you when 
you’re doing business with customers from other cultures:
 
 Your customers may feel that you don’t care about them or about 
spending time to develop a relationship with them. As a result, they’ll 
simply look elsewhere to have their needs met.
 
 Customers may use your rush to quickly close a deal against you when 
negotiations begin.
 
When you’re dealing with customers who need to establish a relationship with 
you before making a purchase, take a more relaxed approach and allow your 
customer to set the pace. When she’s ready to talk business, she’ll introduce 
the topic.
When I (Michael) went to Japan to negotiate some business contracts, my 
colleagues and I stayed in a hotel with rooms so tiny that we could barely 
walk between the bed and the dresser. In spite of its small size, each room 
had a large price tag, so we were anxious to conclude our transaction as 
quickly as possible and fly home. However, we knew enough not to bring up 
the subject of business until our hosts did. Unfortunately for the first week 
of our stay, all we did was tour the countryside, eat sushi, drink sake, and 
sing karaoke (very badly!). It wasn’t until we were just about to leave that our 
hosts got down to business. Whether this was a demonstration of the differ-
ence in how the Japanese view time or was a negotiating ploy to put pres-
sure on us, we’ll never know; but by appearing to be relaxed even when we 
weren’t, we put ourselves in a better position to seal the deal on our terms.
See Chapter 13 for general information on negotiating with people of all 
cultures.

Appendix
Culture-Specific Insiders 
Information
I
f you need a quick reference guide for interacting with customers from 
specific cultures, you’ve arrived at the right place. Here we provide 
guidelines for meeting, greeting, and selling to customers who form the most 
prominent cultural groups in the United States. We also include a calendar 
of multicultural events and special occasions to assist you in planning your 
marketing and sales calendar.
 
In this book, we divide cultures into groups based on the size of their popula-
tion according to the latest information available from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
Immigrants from Europe vary widely in greetings, communication styles, 
negotiation tactics, and more, so if you want to serve one or several European 
immigrant groups in your service area, conduct a survey as we explain in 
Chapter 2 to find out their wants and needs, and flip to Chapter 4 for tips on 
becoming involved in their community events.
A Quick Reference for Cross-Cultural 
Etiquette
Follow the Global Rule: Treat others as they would like to be treated. In the 
following sections, we provide a quick reference guide for meeting, greeting, 
and establishing rapport with people from various cultures. We list these 
groups in order of population size in the United States.
 
These are only guidelines. How any individual wants to be treated depends 
on the level of acculturation (how adapted to American culture a person is, as 
explained in Chapter 9) and his personal preferences. The degree to which 
ethnic culture influences thinking and behavior depends upon how long the 
person has been in the U.S. (which generation), the type of community he 
comes from, his socioeconomic status, his ties to his ethnic culture via family, 
and so on. As always, assume nothing and let the customer take the lead.

Hispanics
In 2003, the Census Bureau announced that the U.S. Hispanic population had 
reached 39 million people. This marked the first time Hispanics had over-
taken Blacks to become the largest minority group in the country. In 2006, 
they numbered more than 44 million people, or around 15 percent of the 
nation’s total population.
Hispanics are a very diverse group hailing from many parts of the world, 
including Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, El Salvador, and the Dominican 
Republic. In this section, we outline some of the cultural tendencies of the 
larger groups. Unfortunately, due to page limitations, we’ve had to omit some 
of the smaller groups, including populations from most of Central America 
(7.6 percent of the total U.S. Hispanic population in 2006) and South America 
(total 5.5 percent of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2006). However, if you 
want the details, many books and Web sites focus on specific Latin American 
countries and cultures. My (Michael’s) Web site at www.EthnoConnect.com 
includes a list of resources.
Mexicans
According to the 2006 U.S. census, Mexicans are by far the largest group of all 
Hispanics in the United States at 64 percent, or more than 28 million people.
Common greeting: Shaking hands or giving a slight bow. Only shake 
hands with a Mexican woman if she extends her hand first. Men may 
greet other men with the abrazo (a hug with a few pats on the back).
Personal space: Generally closer than most Americans are comfortable 
with, at 1 to 1.5 feet.
Eye contact: Direct.
Approach to time: Relaxed; up to 30 minutes late is considered punctual. 
Mexicans may also cancel or fail to show up for meetings, so be persistent. 
You’re not expected to arrive on time for appointments or social events.
Language: Spanish is the official language, so you may want to pick up a 
few Spanish words like hola (hello), adiós (goodbye), por favor (please), 
and gracias (thank you). However, keep in mind that for many of your 
customers, their English may be better than your Spanish.
Communication: Mexicans are more likely to prefer doing business in 
person rather than over the phone or Internet. They also tend to be indi-
rect communicators, so avoid direct confrontation.
Topics for building rapport: Family and children are always welcome 
subjects. Never ask a Hispanic man, “What does your wife do for a living?” 
because this can imply that he doesn’t earn enough to support his family.
Negotiations: Negotiations can move at a snail’s pace, so be patient. 
Quick decisions are considered rash.

323
 Appendix: Culture-Specific Insiders Information
Actions to avoid: Standing with your hands on your hips connotes anger. 
Standing with your hands in your pockets is rude.
Tips for saleswomen: Men may not be used to seeing women in positions 
of power, so proceed slowly.
Puerto Ricans
According to the 2006 U.S. census, Puerto Ricans are the second largest 
group of Hispanics in the U.S. at 9 percent of the U.S. Hispanic population, or 
nearly 4 million people.
Common greeting: Shaking hands is common for both men and women. 
Men and women who are friends may kiss each other on the cheek. Older 
people are respected and usually introduced first. Be formal at first and 
don’t use customers’ first names unless invited to do so.
Personal space: Puerto Ricans tend to stand close when conversing, at 
about 1 to 1.5 feet. They often touch other people when talking, such as 
patting them on the back.
Eye contact: Direct.
Approach to time: May be 15 to 30 minutes late or more.
Language: Although Spanish is the national language, English is the 
language of business, so Puerto Ricans are usually quite comfortable 
speaking it.
Communication: Puerto Ricans are a friendly people who often smile 
while talking. They like to be very direct about issues and feelings and 
may be a bit more emphatic while doing it. Be aware that Puerto Ricans 
consider their country to be part of the U.S., so if you were to say some-
thing like “We Americans . . .” (as if they’re not Americans), your listener 
would likely be insulted.
Topics for building rapport: Sports and travel.
Negotiations: Usually begin with small talk and can end with a hard sell, 
so be prepared. Don’t offer your best deal upfront, or you’ll have few 
options when the real bargaining begins.
Actions to avoid: Sitting or standing with arms crossed or putting your 
hands on your hips, because these are considered challenging or aggres-
sive postures. Don’t inquire about families or marital status; the rate of 
divorce and single-parent families is pretty high among Puerto Ricans in 
the U.S. Don’t talk about Puerto Rico’s status as a U.S. territory because 
this is a sensitive and controversial topic.
Tips for saleswomen: Although Puerto Ricans value equality, the spirit 
of machismo is still alive and well. Puerto Rican men are used to seeing 
women in positions of power and authority, so be yourself, but remain 
aware that some men from this culture may prefer to work with salesmen.

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Cubans
According to the 2006 U.S. census, Cubans are the third largest separate 
group of Hispanics in the U.S. at 3.4 percent, or 1.5 million people.
Common greeting: Shaking hands is common for both men and women. 
Men and women who are friends may kiss on the cheek. Be formal at first 
and don’t use customers’ first names unless invited to do so.
Personal space: A bit closer than in the U.S. at 1 to 1.5 feet, and touching 
is common among friends. However, Cubans aren’t used to being touched 
by strangers, including seemingly friendly pats on the back.
Eye contact: Direct.
Approach to time: It’s not unusual for Cubans to keep people waiting for 
an hour or more for a meeting.
Language: Spanish is the official language, although English is widely 
spoken.
Communication: Fairly direct; not much different from your U.S. custom-
ers, but they may be a bit louder than Americans are used to.
Topics for building rapport: Travel and family.
Negotiations: Cubans tend to try to tire you out with slow and protracted 
bargaining.
Actions to avoid: Discussions about politics, which can be a minefield.
Tips for saleswomen: Cuba is a very macho country where women aren’t 
commonly seen in positions of power and authority. Proceed slowly and 
present yourself as representing your company rather than yourself. If 
necessary, be prepared to graciously allow a male counterpart to step in 
if you sense a great deal of uneasiness on the customer’s part.
Salvadorans
According to the 2006 U.S. census estimates, people from El Salvador are now 
the fourth largest separate group of Hispanics in the U.S. at just over 3.0 per-
cent, or almost 1.4 million people.
Common greeting: Handshakes that are a bit soft and held longer than 
Americans may be comfortable with. A Salvadoran woman may not shake 
hands, so wait for her to extend hers first. Friends of either gender may 
add a light pat on the back or a hug. Be formal at first and use customers’ 
titles, such as “doctor” or “professor,” if you know them.
Personal space: Salvadorans generally stand and sit closer than 
Americans are accustomed to at 1 to 1.5 feet.
Eye contact: Direct.
Approach to time: Relaxed; may be an hour or more late for appoint-
ments. For instance, city buses run regularly, but there’s no schedule.

325
 Appendix: Culture-Specific Insiders Information
Language: Spanish is the official language.
Communication: Very indirect. Salvadorans generally don’t say what they 
feel. They appreciate receiving information in English as well as Spanish.
Topics for building rapport: Foods and culture of El Salvador, as well as 
history, geography, and families.
Negotiations: Decisions can take a long time over several meetings. 
Salvadorans don’t like high-pressure tactics. They tend to be skilled and 
tough bargainers.
Actions to avoid: Common American gestures that may have little or 
erroneous meanings in the Salvadoran culture. For instance, don’t point 
your fingers at anyone. Avoid loud or overly boisterous conversations.
Tips for saleswomen: Women in positions of power in business are rare 
in El Salvador. It helps to tell customers from this country that you’re 
representing your company and not speaking for yourself personally.
Dominicans
According to the 2006 U.S. census, people from the Dominican Republic are 
the fifth largest separate group of Hispanics in the U.S. at 2.8 percent, or 
more than 1.2 million people.
Common greeting: Handshakes, which may be combined with slight 
touches on the arm and elbow. Just return the gesture. Women com-
monly shake hands with men and other women. Friends may share a light 
kiss on the cheek.
Personal space: Dominicans tend to stand and sit a bit closer than 
Americans are accustomed to, at 1 to 1.5 feet.
Eye contact: Direct eye contact is very important in this culture.
Approach to time: Relaxed; may be an hour or more late for appointments.
Language: Spanish is the official language, but it’s quite a bit different than 
the Spanish spoken in Mexico or Spain. Most Dominicans grow up speaking 
their own form of Spanish, commonly referred to as “Dominicanese.”
Communication: Very direct and open. Dominicans generally say what 
they feel. They appreciate receiving information in English as well as 
Spanish. They may talk a bit louder than you’re used to. Humor is greatly 
appreciated by these rather upbeat people.
Topics for building rapport: Foods and culture of the Dominican 
Republic and baseball. Many Dominicans are proud of the fact that their 
country sends so many fine players to the major leagues in the U.S.
Negotiations: Decisions can take a long time. Dominicans don’t like high-
pressure tactics. They tend to be skilled and tough bargainers.
Actions to avoid: Common American gestures that may have little or 
erroneous meanings in the Dominican culture.

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Tips for saleswomen: Machismo is practiced as a high art in the Dominican 
Republic, so when you’re dealing with male customers, present yourself as 
a representative of your company and tread carefully so as to not insult the 
male ego. If necessary, be prepared to graciously allow a male counterpart 
to step in if you sense a great deal of uneasiness on the customer’s part.
Blacks or African Americans
In 2003, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the Black population to be 36.6 
million people. For the first time, this made African Americans the second 
largest ethnic group in the country, and in 2006, they comprised 12.8 percent 
of the nation’s total population, or more than 38 million people. The Census 
Bureau defines “Black or African American” as “A person having origins in 
any of the Black racial groups of Africa.” African Americans are obviously 
very different from people who have recently emigrated from Africa.
African Americans
 
Recognize that African American consumers are not all the same. One way to 
differentiate them is by economic status such as working class, middle class, 
and upper class. Each group is unique in terms of buying habits and preferred 
products.
Common greeting: Shaking hands for both men and women is commonly 
practiced. Be formal at the beginning and never call an African American 
by his or her first name unless the person invites you to do so, because 
this could be extremely insulting. Show respect by saying something like, 
“It’s really good to meet you.”
Personal space: Closer and less formal than Anglo Americans may be 
used to at 1 to 1.5 feet, but you must establish trust before assuming 
familiarity or closeness.
Eye contact: Can be very direct, especially when speaking. May be some-
what indirect when listening.
Approach to time: Punctual.
Language: English.
Communication: African Americans tend to prefer very direct communica-
tions and “telling it like it is.” Gestures can be more enthusiastic than most 
Anglo salespeople are used to. Nonverbal communication is very important 
and can convey more meaning than in almost any other culture. Men may 
not always be comfortable talking about themselves. The African American 
culture has a long history of storytelling, so tell stories instead of lecturing.
Topics for building rapport: Anything you would normally talk to any 
other long-established American about, such as entertainment, sports, or 
education.

327
 Appendix: Culture-Specific Insiders Information
Negotiations: Older African Americans may not negotiate much, whereas 
the younger generation seems more adept at the art of haggling.
Actions to avoid: Anything that can be interpreted as questioning the 
customer’s ability to afford an item. Calling African American females 
“Miss,” which can be demeaning. Don’t ask a Black woman about her 
husband unless she brings up the subject first, because many African 
American households are headed by single women.
Tips for saleswomen: Women salespeople are generally treated with a 
great deal of respect by African American men. Black women can be very 
independent and may prefer to deal with a man.
Africans
Africans in the United States include people from Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia, 
Egypt, Somalia, South Africa, Angola, and elsewhere. Although they can 
represent a significant customer base in certain cities like the District of 
Columbia, New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Boston, Houston, 
Chicago, Dallas, and Philadelphia, in total just over a million people of African 
descent were living in the U.S. in 2006.
 
The diversity of people living in different countries across the African conti-
nent (especially the diversity in South Africa alone) is too great to provide any 
accurate general tendencies. If you have a large number of people from Africa 
in your service area, conduct a survey of their needs as described in Chapter 2.
Asians
In 2006, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the Asian population in the U.S. to be 
nearly 15 million people. This made them the third largest ethnic group in the 
country at around 5 percent of the nation’s total population. Among U.S. Asians, 
Chinese, Filipinos, and Asian Indians comprise more than half of the population. 
Although the Census Bureau’s definition of Asians is much broader, in the follow-
ing sections we just cover the main groups you’re likely to encounter.
 
Indians and Pakistanis are South Asians, so we include them in the following 
sections. Bear in mind that Indians and Pakistanis are very different in culture, 
religion, and many other ways. For instance, Indians primarily speak Hindi and 
are Hindus who don’t eat beef. Pakistanis primarily speak Urdu and are largely 
Muslims who don’t believe in eating pork or drinking alcohol.
Chinese
Chinese are currently the largest Asian group in America (at more than 3.5 mil-
lion people in 2006). They started coming to California in the late 1840s to mine 
for gold and have always looked on the United States as the land of opportunity.

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Common greeting: For Chinese men, shaking hands is common and often 
accompanied by a bow. A woman may be uncomfortable with handshakes, 
so wait to see what she does first. Chinese generally don’t like being 
touched by strangers. Business cards are exchanged with formality with 
both hands with the wording facing the customer (see Chapter 8). They 
may put last names first, so be sure to ask “Which is your family name?”
Personal space: A bit closer than in the U.S., at 1.5 to 2 feet. It’s common 
for friends of the same sex to hold hands while walking.
Eye contact: Indirect.
Approach to time: Punctual. However, people and relationships are more 
important than deadlines.
Language: Mandarin Chinese is primarily spoken in mainland China and 
Taiwan, while Cantonese is primarily spoken in Hong Kong.
Communication: Periods of silence during a sales presentation or negotia-
tions are used for contemplation; don’t interrupt with idle chit chat. As 
very indirect communicators, Chinese find “no” difficult to say. They may 
say “maybe” or “we’ll see” to save face. Forcing a Chinese customer to say 
“no” is a good way to quickly end a relationship, because they don’t like 
to be disagreeable. They also don’t express themselves very physically.
Don’t be insulted if the Chinese ask personal questions such as “How 
much money do you make?” “How many children do you have?” or “Are 
you married?” They ask these questions to show interest. Just change the 
subject if you don’t want to answer. Feel free to ask personal questions in 
return, especially about family. Show respect for older people.
Topics for building rapport: Personal interests, hobbies, children, 
Chinese food, and culture.
Negotiations: Very formal and slow. If a customer seems surprised at a 
proposal, attempt to change your request, allowing the customer to save 
face. Signing a contract begins negotiations. A contract is usually consid-
ered only a draft and is subject to change at any time.
Actions to avoid: Never use your index finger to beckon or point. Use the 
entire hand. Don’t wrap gifts in white paper, which is the symbol of death. 
Don’t touch Chinese people, even casually, unless they touch you first.
Tips for saleswomen: China is a male-dominated society. However, many 
women are in business in China, and some occupy high-ranking positions 
and important managerial jobs. One of the principles of the Chinese com-
munist system is to work toward sexual equality. By establishing a more 
indirect communication style, you should be able to avoid any problems.
Filipinos
According to the 2006 U.S. census, just over 2 million people of Filipino 
descent reside in the U.S.

 Appendix: Culture-Specific Insiders Information
Common greeting: Men and women shake hands with everyone pres-
ent at a business meeting or social occasion and when saying goodbye. 
Handshakes should be friendly and informal, but soft. Men should wait 
for women to extend their hand. Friends may greet each other by raising 
their eyebrows.
Personal space: Just a bit farther than in the United States at 2.5 to 3 feet. 
Friends will stand much closer in casual conversation.
Eye contact: Direct during the greeting and indirect after that. Strong eye 
contact between men can be interpreted as aggressive.
Approach to time: Filipinos are very relaxed about time. Meetings and 
appointments usually begin about 30 minutes to an hour late.
Language: Filipino and English are the official languages of the Philippines. 
Because English is widely used for educational, governmental, and commer-
cial purposes, Filipinos are generally very comfortable speaking English.
Communication: Filipinos are casual, fun-loving, sensitive, and hos-
pitable people. Laughter may convey pleasure or embarrassment; it’s 
commonly used to relieve tension. Communication is indirect, truth 
is diplomatically presented, and Filipinos find it difficult to say “no,” 
disagree, reject, or be confrontational. As a result, they may give an 
ambiguous or indirect answer — not to be deceptive, but rather to avoid 
confrontation. Filipinos may point by puckering their lips in the direction 
they are referring to.
Topics for building rapport: Filipino food, customs, and language.
Negotiations: Casual conversation may precede business discussions 
during meetings. Negotiations and business deals move slowly. Don’t 
allow meetings to go too long, because Filipinos love to eat, and their 
enthusiasm wanes when they’re hungry. They often have a “take it or 
leave it” attitude when it comes to price. They also may place less stress 
on the absolute selling price and more emphasis on percentages, unit 
cost, or rounded figures.
Actions to avoid: Standing with your hands on your hips means you’re 
angry. Pointing at a Filipino with your finger is disrespectful.
Tips for saleswomen: Women are generally treated similar to men in the 
Philippines and have been rulers of the country, so as long as you make 
the other adjustments described in this section, you should be safe.
Asian Indians
According to the Census Bureau, the Asian Indian population in the U.S. grew 
from around 1,678,000 in 2000 to 2,662,000 in 2006. This was a growth rate of 
59 percent, which was the highest for any Asian American group.
Common greeting: Shaking hands is common, but so is the traditional 
namaste (placing both hands prayerfully to the chest with a slight bow). 
Men generally don’t touch women when greeting them. Traditional Indian 

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
women may shake hands with American women but not usually with 
men. Men may pat other men on the back as a sign of friendship. Always 
present your business card when introduced. Use the right hand to pres-
ent your card, and accept the other person’s card with the same hand.
Personal space: A bit farther than in the U.S. at 2.5 to 3 feet.
Eye contact: Indirect, especially when speaking with people they 
consider to be superior.
Approach to time: Arriving 15 to 30 minutes late is considered punctual. 
They may not show up for appointments and expect you to reschedule.
Language: Although Hindi is the national language, most Indians are com-
fortable speaking English. It’s the most important language for national, 
political, and business communications in that country.
Communication: Indians can be very direct. When an Indian smiles and 
jerks his head backward or moves his head around in a figure eight, this 
usually means yes. It’s considered rude to discuss business before engag-
ing in small talk about the customer’s family and interests. “I will try” 
likely means “no.”
Topics for building rapport: Food, personal interests, and hobbies. Ask 
them to teach you a few words in Hindi.
Negotiations: Indians rarely make an immediate decision and typically 
demand lots of data to back up any claims you make. They often view 
bargaining as win-lose, so you must build trust before you begin or you’re 
likely to lose.
Actions to avoid: Using your left hand for eating, because it’s considered 
unclean. Don’t touch an Indian on the head, because the head is consid-
ered sacred. Pointing the sole of your foot at a customer is considered 
extremely rude, so keep both feet on the floor when seated. Don’t point 
with the index finger — use the entire hand, instead.
Tips for saleswomen: You shouldn’t shake hands with a man unless he 
extends his hand first. Men may not be used to seeing women in posi-
tions of authority, so saleswomen should present themselves as repre-
sentatives of their company. Indian men may not invite their spouses to 
business meetings or social functions.
South Koreans
Because the North Korean government doesn’t allow its citizens to leave 
the country, few North Koreans live in the United States. Therefore, the 
Census Bureau doesn’t draw a distinction between North and South Koreans. 
According to the 2006 census, about 1.5 million Koreans (primarily South 
Koreans) were living in the U.S.
Common greeting: Bowing is common in Korea, but in America many 
men will shake hands. However, to show respect when shaking hands, 
the right forearm is supported by the left hand. Korean women generally 

331
 Appendix: Culture-Specific Insiders Information
don’t shake hands but rather just nod slightly, so follow their lead. Don’t 
use first names unless invited to do so. They may put last names first, so 
be sure to ask “Which is your family name?” Don’t touch Koreans, even 
casually, unless they touch you first.
Personal space: A littler farther apart than Americans are probably 
accustomed to at 2.5 to 3 feet.
Eye contact: Very indirect after the initial greeting.
Time: Very punctual.
Language: New immigrant Koreans usually speak Hangul (Korean) and 
tend to be uncomfortable with English, so speak a little more slowly. 
Younger people are often brought on shopping trips to act as interpreters.
Communication: Koreans tend to be very indirect, and yet they are con-
sidered the most emotional of all Asian people. As opposed to the rather 
stoic Japanese and Chinese, the Koreans are more likely to wear their 
emotions on their sleeves. Because they are indirect, they tend to avoid 
saying the word “no,” so don’t ask questions to which the answer could 
be no. Instead of saying, “Can we deliver the refrigerator tomorrow?” 
phrase it as, “When do you want us to deliver the refrigerator?”
Topics for building rapport: Korean history, food, or culture.
Negotiations: Very formal and data driven. Koreans generally start with 
an unreasonable position and, if you’re firm, will compromise. They may 
continue to negotiate after a contract is signed.
Actions to avoid: Talking about politics or North Korea. Don’t say “thank 
you” when a Korean compliments you, because it’s considered a sign that 
you lack humility. Instead say, “Oh no, I was just lucky” or something that 
implies you’re not worthy of the compliment.
Tips for saleswomen: Korean men tend to be uncomfortable negotiating 
with women. To ease this discomfort, present yourself as a representa-
tive of your company and spend time establishing a relationship before 
starting your sales presentation.
Vietnamese
According to the 2006 U.S. census, the Vietnamese have a fairly large popula-
tion in the U.S., accounting for more than 1.6 million people.
Common greeting: Business cards are usually exchanged first, although 
the ritual isn’t as elaborate as with the Japanese (see the following sec-
tion). Vietnamese men generally shake hands when greeting as well as 
when saying goodbye. Shake with both hands and bow your head slightly 
to show respect. Bow to the elderly who don’t extend their hands. 
Vietnamese women are more inclined to bow their heads slightly rather 
than to shake hands. Family names usually come first, followed by middle 
name and then given name.
Personal space: A bit farther apart than in the U.S. at 2.5 to 3 feet.

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Eye contact: Very indirect after the initial greeting.
Approach to time: Punctual, but value people and relationships more 
than deadlines.
Language: Speak Vietnamese and many don’t speak English well. An 
interpreter is usually necessary, although children who were born and 
educated in the United States are usually brought on shopping trips to 
serve this function.
Communication: While generally indirect, Vietnamese can be very direct, 
almost confrontational at times. However, the Vietnamese try to avoid 
unpleasantness by not saying the word “no,” which can sometimes 
lead to misunderstandings. Yes may not mean they agree. When the 
Vietnamese say “No problem,” you can take it to mean “Yes, there is a 
problem.” In this case, double- and even triple-check all commitments. As 
with most Asians, silence during conversation is valued.
Topics for building rapport: Vietnamese food and culture.
Negotiations: Can be very slow, and decisions are often made as a group.
Actions to avoid: Gesturing with your hands or touching. Always pass an 
object by using both hands.
Tips for saleswomen: Women in Vietnam are considered caregivers and 
are highly respected. However they aren’t usually seen in positions of 
authority, so expect customers to be a little surprised when meeting a 
woman in sales. Take time to establish a relationship, and most of your 
male customers will readily accept buying from a woman.
Japanese
Given the influence that Japanese culture has had on the United States, you’d 
probably think that the U.S. has a considerable number of immigrants from 
Japan. Yet, according to the 2006 census, just over 1.2 million Japanese were 
living in the U.S. That’s still a sizeable population, but not quite as large as 
most people believe.
Common greeting: Japanese customers may exchange business cards 
even before they shake hands or bow because business cards are very 
important. They present their cards with great ceremony by using both 
hands, with the lettering facing the customer. You should accept their 
card with your right hand and treat it with respect. You should be famil-
iar with many other aspects of the business card exchange before doing 
business with Japanese people. (See Chapter 8 for more details.)
Some Japanese bow and then shake hands. The bow is a highly regarded 
greeting to show respect and is appreciated by the Japanese. A slight 
bow to show courtesy is acceptable. A handshake is appropriate upon 
meeting. The Japanese handshake is soft and accompanied by little or no 
eye contact. Women generally don’t shake hands with men. Wait to see 
what kind of greeting your customer offers you, and then do likewise.

333
 Appendix: Culture-Specific Insiders Information
First names are almost never used in Japan. Instead, they use the hon-
orific term san (pronounced sahn) following the last name which is the 
equivalent to the English “Mr.,” “Mrs.,” “Ms.,” or “Miss.”
Personal space: Much farther than in the United States at about 3 to 3.5 
feet.
Eye contact: Very indirect except when first meeting.
Approach to time: Punctual.
Language: Japanese is the national language. The Japanese tend to speak 
English slowly and deliberately, but most value an opportunity to further 
develop their mastery of English. In most cases, you can get by without 
a translator, but be sure to speak slowly and literally (avoid common 
expressions, such as “getting down to brass tacks”).
Communication: Very indirect and formal with very little body language 
or gesturing. Expect silence when the person is in thought. Nodding is 
very important. When listening to Japanese speak, you should nod to 
show you’re listening and understanding the speaker. Silence is a natural 
and expected form of nonverbal communication. Don’t feel a need to fill 
it with idle chatter. Japanese people rarely say no, but this doesn’t mean 
they agree with you. They don’t like being disagreeable and may say such 
things as “This is difficult” to mean “no.” Sucking air in quickly and loudly 
through lips and teeth expresses distress or surprise at a proposal and 
also means “no.”
Topics for building rapport: Japanese food and culture. They are 
also very interested in talking about education, especially well-known 
American universities, and of course, baseball.
Negotiations: Extremely slow and deliberate. The Japanese typically 
take their time getting to know you because they’re trying to determine 
whether you’re an honorable person with whom to do business.
Several meetings are usually required to close a sale. When the time 
comes, be content to close a deal with a handshake. Leave the signing of 
the written contract to later meetings.
Actions to avoid: Touching of any kind.
Tips for saleswomen: Japanese men may not be accustomed to seeing 
women in positions of power or authority, although this is slowly chang-
ing. Dress conservatively around Japanese people. You must establish 
credibility and a position of authority immediately.
Pakistanis
Pakistanis comprise a much smaller portion of the population than Asian 
Indians. According to the 2004 census, only about 200,000 Pakistanis were 
living in the U.S.

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Common greeting: Salaam (a Muslim greeting), which involves a soft 
handshake with the right hand followed by touching your hand to your 
forehead and then your heart. (Notice that the salaam greeting is very 
different from the Indian namaste.) A handshake is common for non-
Muslims. Muslim women generally don’t touch men or women to whom 
they’re not related by marriage or blood.
Personal space: A little closer than Americans may be comfortable with 
at 1.5 to 2 feet.
Eye contact: Direct when speaking to people of your own age or younger, 
and indirect with people who are your senior.
Approach to time: Punctual but not insistent upon it.
Language: Although Urdu is the official language, most Pakistanis, espe-
cially those who are businesspeople, speak English.
Communication: When speaking to a Pakistani older than yourself, the 
preferred style is indirect. When speaking to people of your own age or 
younger, you can be more direct.
Topics for building rapport: Pakistani culture and foods.
Negotiations: Pakistanis love to bargain as a way to get to know you. 
Build connection and trust before starting any negotiation. Written con-
tracts are important.
Actions to avoid: Any reference to “God” as in “Oh my God” or “good 
God.” Don’t cross your legs so the bottom of your foot points at the 
customer.
Tips for saleswomen: Men may not be used to seeing women in positions 
of power or authority and may prefer to negotiate with a male counter-
part. If that’s not an option, present yourself as a representative of your 
company and take some time establishing a relationship before beginning 
your sales presentation.
American Indians and Alaska Natives
As of July 1, 2006, 4.5 million people in the United States identified them-
selves as American Indian or Alaska Natives. Given the fact that Native 
Americans were here first, it’s surprising that many people in the U.S. have 
so many misconceptions about them. The majority of American Indians, for 
example, do not live on reservations.
American Indians
Approximately 116 nations represent the various populations of American 
Indians. Although great diversity exists among the different nations, here are 
some general tendencies you may notice:

335
 Appendix: Culture-Specific Insiders Information
Common greeting: A very gentle handshake.
Personal space: Greater than for Whites at 2.5 to 3 feet. Native Americans 
greatly value their personal space.
Eye contact: Very little.
Approach to time: Less punctual. American Indians tend to see time as 
an endless circle where the past, present, and future are all continuous. 
Arriving for appointments 15 to 30 minutes late isn’t unusual.
Language: English. Hundreds of nation-specific languages are also 
spoken.
Communication: Native American communication style is greatly 
affected by their values of humility, respect for elders, and harmony. As 
indirect communicators, Native Americans often exchange information 
and convey beliefs through storytelling. The most effective method of 
selling is to tell stories.
Topics for building rapport: Anything you would normally talk to any 
other long-established American about, such as entertainment, sports, 
nature, or education.
Negotiations: More collaborative and less confrontational than 
Caucasians. They want to bring about agreement through good feelings.
Actions to avoid: The words “squaw,” “redskin,” “tribe,” or “chief.” 
American Indians tend not to display much emotion, especially facial 
emotions.
Tips for saleswomen: Many of the Indian nations have a matriar-
chal structure where women are considered powerful figures, so you 
shouldn’t face any extra challenges when selling to male clientele.
Alaska Natives
 
Alaska’s indigenous people are divided into 11 distinct cultures with 20 different 
languages in addition to English. Again, great diversity exists among its peoples; 
therefore, it’s impossible to begin to even generalize cultural tendencies. If you 
find you have a large number of people who are Alaska Natives in your service 
area, conduct a survey of their needs as recommended in Chapter 2.
Native Hawaiians and other 
Pacific Islanders
Another group of people that the U.S. Census Bureau regularly tracks are 
Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders. In 2006, this group consisted 
of more than 1 million people from Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, and other Pacific 
Islands. Remember that Hawaii is part of the United States, and people from 
the islands refer to the contiguous 48 states as “The Mainland.”

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
People who are categorized as Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders 
are very diverse. Therefore trying to describe cultural tendencies among this 
diverse population is nearly impossible. Taking a survey, as suggested in 
Chapter 2, is the best way to gather information about the prospective cus-
tomers in your area.
Middle Easterners
Another group that has a significant impact on retailers and service provid-
ers in different parts of the United States are people from the Middle East — 
primarily Arabs. In the 2000 U.S. census, more than 1 million people identified 
themselves as of Arabian ancestry. People of Lebanese, Syrian, and Egyptian 
backgrounds accounted for 60 percent of the Arabian population. Another 20 
percent described themselves as Arabians. Although part of the Middle East, 
Iran is not considered an Arabian country because the majority of its inhabit-
ants speak Farsi (Persian).
The Arabian states are composed of some 22 countries. Although great diver-
sity stands between Middle Eastern cultures, here are some general tenden-
cies you may notice:
Common greeting: Salaam for Muslims — shake hands with your right 
hand and then touch your forehead and your heart with the same hand. 
Shaking hands is common for non-Muslims. Men often hug other male 
friends and kiss them on both cheeks. Women usually don’t touch men 
who aren’t their spouse or family member. They may immediately call 
you by your first name, which gives you permission to do the same.
Personal space: Much closer than most Americans are used to at 0.5 to 1 
foot. Probably the closest of any group of people on the planet, depend-
ing on which country in the Middle East your customers hail from.
Eye contact: Tends to be very direct. A saying in the Middle East is that 
“The eyes are the windows to the soul.” Customers may stare deeply into 
your eyes to try and see if you’re an honorable and trustworthy person. 
Try not to flinch!
Approach to time: Usually not very punctual and may be 30 minutes to 3 
hours late or more depending on their specific country of origin.
Language: Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, and others are spoken depending 
specifically on what country they or their ancestors are from. Those who 
emigrate to the United States are usually fairly conversant in English.
Communication: Silence is highly valued. Although Middle Eastern 
people tend to be extremely indirect, they can also be very demonstra-
tive and emotive. They may be very emotional during negotiations, but 
it’s mostly for show.

337
 Appendix: Culture-Specific Insiders Information
Topics for building rapport: Family, education, and Middle Eastern culture. 
Although most of us have been taught to be humble, in the Middle East 
bragging is often elevated to a high art. When dealing with folks from this 
culture, you can toot your own horn whenever the customer does so first.
Negotiations: Middle Eastern people can be very confrontational nego-
tiators with lots of emotion. They may even walk out, but if you’ve built 
a relationship, they’ll likely come back. A person’s word is more highly 
valued than a written contract.
Actions to avoid: Asking about a man’s wife because this is considered 
impolite unless he mentions her first. Using the left hand for gesturing or 
eating, because it’s considered unclean. Remember that Muslims are for-
bidden to drink alcohol or eat pork.
Tips for saleswomen: Although it can vary from country to country, men 
may not be comfortable doing business with women. If you sense this, 
you may want to defer to a male counterpart to do the talking while you 
put the deal together behind the scenes.
On the other hand, while Middle Eastern men may not treat American 
women with the kind of respect women are used to in the U.S., they are 
likely to trust women more than men. This is because in their home coun-
tries men cheat each other just for fun and then brag about it, but women 
don’t cheat.
Anglo Americans or Caucasians
Anglo Americans?! What could we possibly be thinking by including a section 
on Anglo Americans? Actually, we do have a purpose for our madness — 
three purposes, in fact:
 
 To acknowledge that everyone, including Caucasians, has cultural quirks.
 
 To give Anglo American salespeople a clearer understanding of the 
differences between “us” and “them.”
 
 To provide new immigrant salespeople who are reading this book with 
advice and insight on how to sell effectively to their Caucasian customers.
Hey, it’s only fair. After all, more Anglo Americans are living in the U.S. than 
the populations of all the other groups combined — more than 200 million 
Americans, according to the most recent U.S. census estimates.
Common greeting: Firm handshakes for men and women. Anglo 
Americans are very casual people who are quick to call others by their 
first (given) name.
Personal space: Anglo Americans generally stand about 2 to 2.5 feet 
apart when doing business. They may slap or pat you on the back or 
shoulder as a sign of friendliness.

338
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Eye contact: Anglo Americans consider direct eye contact to be a sign of 
respect and that you’re paying attention as they’re speaking.
Approach to time: Punctual. If you’re going to be more than ten minutes 
late, you’d better call and let the customer know.
Language: English (not the King’s English) with a great deal of slang 
thrown in.
Communication: Very direct. Most Americans generally say what they 
feel. They’re generally not comfortable with silence and usually try to fill 
any gaps in conversation with idle chitchat, such as commenting on the 
weather.
Topics for building rapport: Sports, entertainment, and food, usually in 
that order for men; and family, entertainment, and food for women.
Negotiations: Very quick and bottom-line oriented. Anglo Americans want 
to get the negotiation process over with as quickly as possible. If they sign 
a contract, it generally signals the end of all further negotiations.
Actions to avoid: Being overly formal because most Americans consider 
this to be “stuffy” and standoffish. Don’t give an expensive gift because 
it may be seen as a bribe, which is illegal. Don’t use or chew on a tooth-
pick in public. Don’t smoke in public or in any place that isn’t specifically 
marked as a smoking area.
Tips for saleswomen: Women commonly hold positions of power in busi-
ness. Men expect you to be direct and have the authority to negotiate on 
behalf of your company.
