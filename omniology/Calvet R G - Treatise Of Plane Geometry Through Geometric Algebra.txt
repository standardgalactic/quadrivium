TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
 
Ramon González Calvet 
  
 
 
The 
geometric 
algebra, 
initially discovered by Hermann 
Grassmann 
(1809-1877) 
was 
reformulated by William Kingdon 
Clifford (1845-1879) through the 
synthesis 
of 
the 
Grassmann’s 
extension 
theory 
and 
the 
quaternions of Sir William Rowan 
Hamilton (1805-1865). In this way 
the bases of the geometric algebra 
were established in the XIX 
century. Notwithstanding, due to 
the premature death of Clifford, the 
vector analysis −a remake of the 
quaternions by Josiah Willard 
Gibbs (1839-1903) and Oliver 
Heaviside (1850-1925)− became, 
after a long controversy, the 
geometric language of the XX century; the same vector analysis whose beauty attracted the 
attention of the author in a course on electromagnetism and led him -being still 
undergraduate-  to read the Hamilton’s Elements of Quaternions. Maxwell himself already 
applied the quaternions to the electromagnetic field. However the equations are not written 
so nicely as with vector analysis. In 1986 Ramon contacted Josep Manel Parra i Serra, 
teacher of theoretical physics at the Universitat de Barcelona, who acquainted him with the 
Clifford algebra. In the framework of the summer courses on geometric algebra which they 
have taught for graduates and teachers since 1994, the plan of writing some books on this 
subject appeared in a very natural manner, the first sample being the Tractat de geometria 
plana mitjançant l’àlgebra geomètrica (1996) now out of print. The good reception of the 
readers has encouraged the author to write the Treatise of plane geometry through 
geometric algebra (a very enlarged translation of the Tractat) and publish it at the Internet 
site http://campus.uab.es/~PC00018, writing it not only for mathematics students but also 
for any person interested in geometry. The plane geometry is a basic and easy step to enter 
into the Clifford-Grassmann geometric algebra, which will become the geometric language 
of the XXI century.

PROLOGUE 
 
The book I am so pleased to present represents a true innovation in the field of the 
mathematical didactics and, specifically, in the field of geometry. Based on the long 
neglected discoveries made by Grassmann, Hamilton and Clifford in the nineteenth 
century, it presents the geometry -the elementary geometry of the plane, the space, the 
spacetime- using the best algebraic tools designed specifically for this task, thus making 
the subject democratically available outside the narrow circle of individuals with the 
high visual imagination capabilities and the true mathematical insight which were 
required in the abandoned classical Euclidean tradition. The material exposed in the 
book offers a wide repertory of geometrical contents on which to base powerful, 
reasonable and up-to-date reintroductions of geometry to present-day high school 
students.  This longed-for reintroductions may (or better should) take advantage of a 
combined use of symbolic computer programs and the cross disciplinary relationships 
with the physical sciences. 
The proposed introduction of the geometric Clifford-Grassmann algebra in high 
school (or even before) follows rightly from a pedagogical principle exposed by 
William Kingdon Clifford (1845-1879) in his project of teaching geometry, in the 
University College of London, as a practical and empirical science as opposed to 
Cambridge Euclidean axiomatics: “ ... for geometry, you know, is the gate of science, 
and the gate is so low and small that one can only enter it as a little child”. Fellow of the 
Royal Society at the age of 29, Clifford also gave a set of Lectures on Geometry  to a 
Class of Ladies at South Kengsinton and was deeply concerned in developing with 
MacMillan Company a series of inexpensive “very good elementary schoolbook of 
arithmetic, geometry, animals, plants, physics ...”. Not foreign to this proposal are Felix 
Klein lectures to teachers collected in his book Elementary mathematics from an 
advanced standpoint1 and the advice of Alfred North Whitehead saying that “the hardest 
task in mathematics is the study of the elements of algebra, and yet this stage must 
precede the comparative simplicity of the differential calculus” and that “the 
postponement of difficulty mis no safe clue for the maze of educational practice” 2.  
 
Clearly enough, when the fate of pseudo-democratic educational reforms, 
disguised as a back to basic leitmotifs, has been answered by such an acute analysis by 
R. Noss and P. Dowling under the title Mathematics in the National Curriculum: The 
Empty Set?3,  the time may be ripen for a reappraisal of true pedagogical reforms based 
on a real knowledge, of substantive contents, relevant for each individual worldview 
construction. We believe that the introduction of the vital or experiential plane, space 
and space-time geometries along with its proper algebraic structures will be a 
substantial part of a successful (high) school scientific curricula. Knowing, telling, 
learning why the sign rule, or the complex numbers, or matrices are mathematical 
structures correlated to the human representation of the real world are worthy objectives 
in mass education projects. And this is possible today if we learn to stand upon the 
shoulders of giants such as Leibniz, Hamilton, Grassmann, Clifford, Einstein, 
Minkowski, etc. To this aim this book, offered and opened to suggestions to the whole 
world of concerned people, may be a modest but most valuable step towards these very 
good schoolbooks that constituted one of the cheerful Clifford's aims.

Finally, some words borrowed from Whitehead and Russell, that I am sure 
convey some of the deepest feelings, thoughts and critical concerns that Dr. Ramon 
González has had in mind while writing the book, and that fully justify a work that 
appears to be quite removed from today high school teaching, at least in Catalunya, our 
country. 
  
“Where attainable knowledge could have changed the issue, ignorance has 
the guilt of vice”2. 
“The uncritical application of the principle of necessary antecedence of 
some subjects to others has, in the hands of dull people with a turn for 
organisation, produced in education the dryness of the Sahara”2. 
“When one considers in its length and in its breadth the importance of this 
question of the education of a nation's young, the broken lives, the defeated 
hopes, the national failures, which result from the frivolous inertia with 
which it is treated, it is difficult to restrain within oneself a savage rage”2. 
“A taste for mathematics, like a taste for music, can be generated in some 
people, but not in others. ... But I think that these could be much fewer than 
bad instruction makes them seem. Pupils who have not an unusually strong 
natural bent towards mathematics are led to hate the subject by two 
shortcomings on the part of their teachers. The first is that mathematics is 
not exhibited as the basis of all our scientific knowledge, both theoretical 
and practical: the pupil is convincingly shown that what we can understand 
of the world, and what we can do with machines, we can understand and do 
in virtue of mathematics. The second defect is that the difficulties are not 
approached gradually, as they should be, and are not minimised by being 
connected with easily apprehended central principles, so that the edifice of 
mathematics is made to look like a collection of detached hovels rather than 
a single temple embodying a unitary plan. It is especially in regard to this 
second defect that Clifford's book (Common Sense of the Exact Sciences) is 
valuable.(Russell)” 4.  
 
An appreciation that Clifford himself had formulated, in his fundamental paper upon 
which the present book relies, relative to the Ausdehnungslehre of Grassmann,  
expressing “my conviction that its principles will exercise a vast influence upon the 
future of mathematical science”.

« On demande en second lieu, laquelle des deux qualités doit être préférée 
dans des élémens, de la facilité, ou de la rigour exacte. Je réponds que cette 
question suppose una chose fausse; elle suppose que la rigour exacte puisse 
exister sans la facilité & c’est le contraire; plus une déduction est 
rigoureause, plus elle est facile à entendre: car la rigueur consiste à reduire 
tout aux principes les plus simples. D’où il s’ensuit encore que la rigueur 
proprement dit entraîne nécessairement la méthode la plus naturelle & la 
plus directe. Plus les principles seront disposés dans l’ordre convenable, 
plus la déduction sera rigourease; ce n’est pas qu’absolument elle ne pût 
l’être si on suivonit une méthode plus composée, com a fait Euclide dans ses 
élémens: mais alors l’embarras de la marche feroit aisément sentir que cette 
rigueur précaire & forcée ne seroit qu’improprement telle. »5 
 
[“Secondly, one requests which of the two following qualities must be 
preferred within the elements, whether the easiness or the exact rigour. I 
answer that this question implies a falsehood; it implies that the exact rigour 
can exist without the easiness and it is the other way around; the more 
rigorous a deduction will be, the more easily it will be understood: because 
the rigour consists of reducing everything to the simplest principles. 
Whence follows that the properly called rigour implies necessarily the most 
natural and direct method. The more the principles will be arranged in the 
convenient order, the more rigorous the deduction will be; it does not mean 
that it cannot be rigorous at all if one follows a more composite method as 
Euclid made in his elements: but then the difficulty of the march will make 
us to feel that this precarious and forced rigour will only be an improper 
one.”]

PREFACE TO THE FIRST ENGLISH EDITION 
 
The first edition of the Treatise of Plane Geometry through Geometric Algebra 
is a very enlarged translation of the first Catalan edition published in 1996. The good 
reception of the book (now out of print) encouraged me to translate it to the English 
language rewriting some chapters in order to make easier the reading, enlarging the 
others and adding those devoted to the non-Euclidean geometry.  
The geometric algebra is the tool which allows to study and solve geometric 
problems through a simpler and more direct way than a purely geometric reasoning, that 
is, by means of the algebra of geometric quantities instead of synthetic geometry. In 
fact, the geometric algebra is the Clifford algebra generated by the Grassmann's outer 
product in a vector space, although for me, the geometric algebra is also the art of 
stating and solving geometric equations, which correspond to geometric problems, by 
isolating the unknown geometric quantity using the algebraic rules of the vectors 
operations (such as the associative, distributive  and permutative properties). Following 
Peano6:  
 
“The geometric Calculus differs from the Cartesian Geometry in that 
whereas the latter operates analytically with coordinates, the former 
operates directly on the geometric entities”. 
 
 Initially proposed by Leibniz7 (characteristica geometrica) with the aim of 
finding an intrinsic language of the geometry, the geometric algebra was discovered and 
developed by Grassmann8, Hamilton and Clifford during the XIX century. However, it 
did not become usual in the XX century ought to many circumstances but the vector 
analysis -a recasting of the Hamilton quaternions by Gibbs and Heaviside- was 
gradually accepted in physics. On the other hand, the geometry followed its own way 
aside from the vector analysis as Gibbs9 pointed out: 
 
“And the growth in this century of the so-called synthetic as opposed to 
analytical geometry seems due to the fact that by the ordinary analysis 
geometers could not easily express, except in a cumbersome and unnatural 
manner, the sort of relations in which they were particularly interested”

8 In 1844 a prize (45 gold ducats for 1846) was offered by the Fürstlich Jablonowski'schen 
Gessellschaft in Leipzig to whom was capable to develop the characteristica geometrica of 
Leibniz. Grassmann won this prize with the memoir Geometric Analysis, published by this 
society in 1847 with a foreword by August Ferdinand Möbius. Its contents are essentially those 
of Die Ausdehnungslehre (1844).

The work of revision of the history and the sources (see J. M. Parra10) has 
allowed us to synthesise the contributions of the different authors and completely 
rebuild the evolution of the geometric algebra, removing the conceptual mistakes which 
led to the vector analysis. This preface has not enough extension to explain all the 
history11, but one must remember something usually forgotten: during the XIX century 
several points of view over what should become the geometric algebra came into 
competition. The Gibbs' vector analysis was one of these being not the better. In fact, 
the geometric algebra is a field of knowledge where different formulations are possible 
as Peano showed: 
 
“Indeed these various methods of geometric calculus do not at all 
contradict one another. They are various parts of the same science, or rather 
various ways of presenting the same subject by several authors, each 
studying it independently of the others.   
It follows that geometric calculus, like any other method, is not a 
system of conventions but a system of truth. In the same way, the methods 
of indivisibles (Cavalieri), of infinitesimals (Leibniz) and of fluxions 
(Newton) are the same science, more or less perfected, explained under 
different forms.”12   
 
The geometric algebra owns some fundamental geometric facts which cannot be 
ignored at all and will be recognised to it, as Grassmann hoped: 
 
“For I remain completely confident that the labour which I have 
expanded on the science presented here and which has demanded a 
significant part of my life as well as the most strenuous application of my 
powers will not be lost. It is true that I am aware that the form which I have 
given the science is imperfect and must be imperfect. But I know and feel 
obliged to state (though I run the risk of seeming arrogant) that even if this 
work should again remained unused for another seventeen years or even 
longer, without entering into the actual development of science, still the 
time will come when it will be brought forth from the dust of oblivion, and 
when ideas now dormant will bring forth fruit. I know that if I also fail to 
gather around me in a position (which I have up to now desired in vain) a 
circle of scholars, whom I could fructify with these ideas, and whom I could 
stimulate to develop and enrich further these ideas, nevertheless there will 
come a time when these ideas, perhaps in a new form, will arise anew and 
will enter  into living communication with contemporary developments. For 
truth is eternal and divine, and no phase in the development of truth, 
however small may be the region encompassed, can pass on without leaving

a trace; truth remains, even though the garment in which poor mortals clothe 
it may fall to dust.”13 
 
As any other aspect of the human life, the history of the geometric algebra was 
conditioned by many fortuitous events. While Grassmann deduced the extension theory 
from philosophic concepts unintelligible for authors such as Möbius and Gibbs, 
Hamilton identified vectors and bivectors -the starting point of the great tangle of vector 
analysis- using a heavy notation14. Clifford had found the correct algebraic structure15 
which integrated the systems of Hamilton and Grassmann. However due to the 
premature death of Clifford in 1879, his opinion was not taken into account16 and a long 
epistolary war was carried out by the quaternionists (specially Tait) against the 
defenders of the vector analysis, created by Gibbs17, who did not recognise to be 
influenced by Grassmann and Hamilton: 
 
“At all events, I saw that the methods which I was using, while 
nearly those of Hamilton, were almost exactly those of Grassmann. I 
procured the two Ed. of the Ausdehnungslehre but I cannot say that I found 
them easy reading. In fact I have never had the perseverance to get through 
with either of them, and have perhaps got more ideas from his 
miscellaneous memoirs than from those works. 
I am not however conscious that Grassmann's writings exerted any 
particular influence on my Vector Analysis, although I was glad enough in 
the introductory paragraph to shelter myself behind one or two distinguished 
names [Grassmann and Clifford] in making changes of notation which I felt 
would be distasteful to quaternionists. In fact if you read that pamphlet 
carefully you will see that it all follows with the inexorable logic of algebra 
from the problem which I had set myself long before my acquaintance with 
Grassmann. 
I have no doubt that you consider, as I do, the methods of Grassmann 
to be superior to those of Hamilton. It thus seemed to me that it might [be] 
interesting to you to know how commencing with some knowledge of 
Hamilton's method and influenced simply by a desire to obtain the simplest 
algebra for the expression of the relations of Geom. Phys. etc. I was led 
essentially to Grassmann's algebra of vectors, independently of any 
influence from him or any one else.”18

Before its beginning the controversy was already superfluous19. Notwithstanding 
the epistolary war continued for twelve years.   
The vector analysis is a provisional solution20 (which spent all the XX century!) 
adopted by everybody ought to its easiness and practical notation but having many 
troubles when being applied to three-dimensional geometry and unable to be 
generalised to the Minkowski’s four-dimensional space. On the other hand, the 
geometric algebra is, by its own nature, valid in any dimension and it offers the 
necessary resources for the study and research in geometry as I show in this book. 
 
The reader will see that the theoretical explanations have been completed with 
problems in each chapter, although this splitting is somewhat fictitious because the 
problems are demonstrations of geometric facts, being one of the most interesting 
aspects of the geometric algebra and a proof of its power. The usual numeric problems, 
which our pupils like, can be easily outlined by the teacher, because the geometric 
algebra always yields an immediate expression with coordinates. 
I'm indebted to professor Josep Manel Parra for encouraging me to write this 
book, for the dialectic interchange of ideas and for the bibliographic support. In the 
framework of the summer courses on geometric algebra for teachers that we taught 
during the years 1994-1997 in the Escola d’estiu de secundària organised by the 
Col·legi Oficial de Doctors i Llicenciats en Filosofia i Lletres i en Ciències de 
Catalunya, the project of some books on this subject appeared in a natural manner. The 
first book devoted to two dimensions already lies on your hands and will probably be 
followed by other books on the algebra and geometry of the three and four dimensions. 
Finally I also acknowledge the suggestions received from some readers.

FIRST PART: THE VECTOR PLANE AND THE COMPLEX NUMBERS 
 
Points and vectors are the main elements of the plane geometry. A point is 
conceived (but not defined) as a geometric element without extension, infinitely small, 
that has position and is located at a certain place on the plane. A vector is defined as an 
oriented segment, that is, a piece of a straight line having length and direction. A vector 
has no position and can be translated anywhere. Usually it is called a free vector. If we 
place the end of a vector at a point, then its head determines another point, so that a 
vector represents the translation from the first point to the second one. 
Taking into account the distinction between points and vectors, the part of the 
book devoted to the Euclidean geometry has been divided in two parts. In the first one 
the vectors and their algebraic properties are studied, which is enough for many 
scientific and engineering branches. In the second part the points are introduced and 
then the affine geometry is studied. 
All the elements of the geometric algebra (scalars, vectors, bivectors, complex 
numbers) are denoted with lowercase Latin characters and the angles with Greek 
characters. The capital Latin characters will denote points on the plane. As you will see, 
the geometric product is not commutative, so that fractions can only be written for real 
and complex numbers. Since the geometric product is associative, the inverse of a 
certain element at the left and at the right is the same, that is, there is a unique inverse 
for each element of the algebra, which is indicated by the superscript −1. Also due to the 
associative property, all the factors in a product are written without parenthesis. In order 
to make easy the reading I have not numerated theorems, corollaries nor equations. 
When a definition is introduced, the definite element is marked with italic characters, 
which allows to direct attention and helps to find again the definition. 
 
 
1. THE VECTORS AND THEIR OPERATIONS 
 
A vector is an oriented segment, having length and direction but no position, that 
is, it can be placed anywhere without changing its orientation. The vectors can represent 
many physical magnitudes such as a force, a celerity, and also geometric magnitudes 
such as a translation. 
Two algebraic operations for vectors are defined, the addition and the product, 
that generalise the addition and product of the real numbers. 
 
 
Vector addition 
 
 The addition of two vectors u + v 
is defined as the vector going from the 
end of the vector u to the head of v when 
the head of u contacts the end of v (upper 
triangle in the figure 1.1 ). Making the 
construction for v + u, that is, placing the 
end of u at the head of v (lower triangle 
in the figure 1.1) we see that the addition 
vector is the same. Therefore, the vector 
addition has the commutative property: 
 
Figure 1.1 

2 
RAMON  GONZALEZ  CALVET 
u + v = v + u 
 
and the parallelogram rule follows: the addition of two vectors is the diagonal of the 
parallelogram formed by both vectors. 
The associative property follows from 
this definition because (u+v)+w or 
u+(v+w) is the vector closing the 
polygon formed by the three vectors as 
shown in the figure 1.2. 
 
The neutral element of the 
vector addition is the null vector, which 
has zero length. Hence the opposite 
vector of u is defined as the vector −u 
with the same orientation but opposite 
direction, which added to the initial 
vector gives the null vector: 
 
u + ( −u) = 0  
 
 
Product of a vector and a real number 
 
One defines the product of a vector and a real number (or scalar) k, as a vector 
with the same direction but with a length increased k times (figure 1.3). If the real 
number is negative, then the direction is the opposite. The geometric definition implies 
the commutative property: 
 
 k u = u k 
 
Two vectors u, v with the same 
direction are proportional because there 
is always a real number k such that v = 
k u , that is, k is the quotient of both 
vectors: 
 
 k = u −1 v = v u −1 
 
Two 
vectors 
with 
different 
directions are said to be linearly 
independent. 
 
 
 
Product of two vectors 
 
The product of two vectors will be called the geometric product in order to be 
distinguished from other vector products currently used. Nevertheless I hope that these 
other products will play a secondary role when the geometric product becomes the most 
used, a near event which this book will forward. At that time, the adjective «geometric» 
will not be necessary. 
The following properties are demanded to the geometric product of two vectors: 
Figure 1.2 
Figure 1.3 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
3 
1) To be distributive with regard to the vector addition: 
 
 u ( v + w ) = u v + u w 
 
2) The square of a vector must be equal to the square of its length. By 
definition, the length (or modulus) of a vector is a positive number and it is 
noted by | u |: 
 
 u2 = | u |2 
 
3) The mixed associative property must exist between the product of vectors 
and the product of a vector and a real number. 
 
 k ( u v ) = ( k u ) v =  k u v 
 
 k ( l u ) = ( k l ) u =  k l u 
 
 
     where k, l are real numbers and u, v vectors. Therefore, parenthesis are not 
     needed. 
 
These properties allows us to deduce the product. Let us suppose that c is the 
addition of two vectors a, b and calculate its square applying the distributive property: 
 
 
 c = a + b 
 
 
 c2 = ( a + b )2 = ( a + b ) ( a + b ) = a2 + a b + b a + b2 
 
 
We have to preserve the order of the factors because we do not know whether the 
product is commutative or not. 
If a and b are orthogonal vectors, the Pythagorean theorem applies and then: 
 
 a ⊥ b    ⇒     c2 = a2 + b2     ⇒     a b + b a = 0      ⇒        a b = − b a 
 
That is, the product of two perpendicular vectors is anticommutative. 
If a and b are proportional vectors then: 
 
a || b     ⇒     b = k a,   k  real    ⇒    a b = a k a = k a a = b a 
 
because of the commutative and mixed associative properties of the product of a vector 
and a real number. Therefore the product of two proportional vectors is commutative. If 
c is the addition of two vectors a, b with the same direction, we have: 
 
 
| c | = | a | + | b | 
 
 
c2 = a2 + b2 + 2 | a | | b | 
 
 
 a b = | a | | b |  
angle(a, b) = 0 
 
But if the vectors have opposite directions: 
 
 
| c | = | a | − | b | 

4 
RAMON  GONZALEZ  CALVET 
 
 
c2 = a2 + b2 − 2 | a | | b | 
 
 
a b = − | a | | b | 
angle(a, b) = π 
 
 
How is the product of two vectors with any directions? Due to the distributive 
property the product is resolved into one product by the proportional component b|| and 
another by the orthogonal component b⊥: 
 
 
 a b = a ( b|| + b⊥ ) = a b|| + a b⊥  
 
 
The product of one vector by the proportional component of the other is called 
the inner product (also scalar product) and noted by a point · (figure 1.4). Taking into 
account that the projection of b onto a is proportional to the cosine of the angle between 
both vectors, one finds: 
 
 
 a · b = a b|| = | a | | b | cos α  
 
 
The inner product is always a real 
number. For example, the work made by a 
force acting on a body is the inner product of 
the force and the walked space. Since the 
commutative property has been deduced for 
the product of vectors with the same 
direction, it follows also for the inner 
product: 
 
 
a · b = b · a 
 
 
The product of one vector by the orthogonal component of the other is called the 
outer product (also exterior product) and it is noted with the symbol ∧ : 
 
 
 a ∧ b = a b⊥ 
 
The outer product represents the area of the parallelogram formed by both vectors 
(figure 1.5): 
 
      a ∧ b =  a b⊥ = absin α 
 
Since the outer product is a product of 
orthogonal vectors, it is anticommutative: 
 
 
a ∧ b = − b ∧ a 
 
 
Some 
example 
of 
physical 
magnitudes which are outer products are the 
angular momentum, the torque, etc.  
When two vectors are permuted, the 
sign of the oriented angle is changed. Then the cosine remains equal while the sine 
changes the sign. Because of this, the inner product is commutative while the outer

TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
5 
product is anticommutative. Now, we can rewrite the geometric product as the sum of 
both products: 
 
a b = a · b + a ∧ b 
 
From here, the inner and outer 
products can be written using the geometric 
product:

In conclusion, the geometric product of two proportional vectors is commutative 
whereas that of two orthogonal vectors is anticommutative, just for the pure cases of 
outer and inner products. The outer, inner and geometric products of two vectors only 
depend upon the moduli of the vectors and the angle between them. When both vectors 
are rotated preserving the angle that they form, the products are also preserved (figure 
1.6).  
How is the absolute value of the product of two vectors? Since the inner and 
outer product are linearly independent and orthogonal magnitudes, the modulus of the 
geometric product must be calculated through a generalisation of the Pythagorean 
theorem: 
 
a b = a · b + a ∧ b 
⇒ 
 a b 2 = a · b2 +a ∧ b2 
 
 a b 2 =  a 2  b 2 ( cos2α + sin2α ) =  a 2  b 2 
 
That is, the modulus of the geometric product is the product of the modulus of 
each vector: 
 
 a b = a  b  
 
 
Product of three vectors: associative property 
 
It is demanded as the fourth property that the product of three vectors be 
associative: 
 
4)     u ( v w ) = ( u v ) w = u v w 
 
Hence we can remove parenthesis in multiple products and with the foregoing 
properties we can deduce how the product operates upon vectors. 
We wish to multiply a vector a by a product of two vectors b, c. We ignore the 
result of the product of three vectors with different orientations except when two 
adjacent factors are proportional. We have seen that the product of two vectors depends 
only on the angle between them. Therefore the parallelogram formed by b and c can be 
Figure 1.6 

6 
RAMON  GONZALEZ  CALVET 
rotated until b has, in the new orientation, the same direction as a. If b' and c' are the 
vectors b and c with the new orientation (figure 1.7) then: 
 
b c = b' c' 
 
a ( b c ) = a ( b'  c' ) 
 
and by the associative property: 
 
a ( b c ) = ( a b' ) c' 
 
Since a and b' have the same 
direction, a b' = ab is a real 
number and the triple product is a 
vector with the direction of c' whose 
length is increased by this amount: 
 
 a ( b c ) = ab c' 
 
It follows that the modulus of the product of three vectors is the product of their 
moduli: 
 
a b c = abc 
 
On the other hand, a can be 
firstly multiplied by b, and after this we 
can rotate the parallelogram formed by 
both vectors until b has, in the new 
orientation, the same direction as c 
(figure 1.8). Then: 
 
    ( a b ) c  =  a'' (  b'' c ) = a'' bc 
 
Although 
the 
geometric 
construction differs from the foregoing 
one, the figures clearly show that the 
triple product yields the same vector, as expected from the associative property.  
 
 
 
( a b ) c  = a'' bc = cb a'' = c b'' a'' = c ( b a ) 
  
That is, the triple product has the property: 
 
a b c = c b a 
 
which I call the permutative property: every vector can be permuted with a vector 
located two positions farther in a product, although it does not commute with the 
neighbouring vectors. The permutative property implies that any pair of vectors in a 
product separated by an odd number of vectors can be permuted. For example: 
 
 
 a b c d  = a d c b = c d a b = c b a d  
Figure 1.7 
Figure 1.8 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
7 
 
 
The permutative property is characteristic of the plane and it is also valid for the 
space whenever the three vectors are coplanar. This property is related with the fact that 
the product of complex numbers is commutative. 
 
 
 
Product of four vectors 
 
 
The product of four vectors can be deduced from the former reasoning. In order 
to multiply two pair of vectors, rotate the parallelogram formed by a and b until b' has 
the direction of c. Then the product is the parallelogram formed by a' and d but 
increased by the modulus of b and c: 
 
 
a b c d = a' b' c d = a'  b c d = b c a' d 
 
Now let us see the special case when a = c and b = d. If both vectors a, b have the same 
direction, the square of their product is a 
positive real number: 
 
 
a || b  
( a b )2  =  a2 b2 > 0 
 
If both vectors are perpendicular, we must 
rotate the parallelogram through π/2 until b' 
has the same direction as a (figure 1.9). Then 
a' and b are proportional but having opposite 
signs. Therefore, the square of a product of 
two orthogonal vectors is always negative: 
 
 
a ⊥ b  
( a b )2  =  a' b' a b = a'bab = −a2 b2 <0 
 
 
Likewise, the square of an outer product of any two vectors is also negative. 
 
 
 
Inverse and quotient of two vectors 
 
 
The inverse of a vector a is that vector whose multiplication by a gives the unity. 
Only the vectors which are proportional have a real product. Hence the inverse vector 
has the same direction and inverse modulus: 
 
 
a −1 = aa −2   
⇒ 
 
a −1 a = a a −1 = 1 
 
 
The quotient of vectors is a product for an inverse vector, which depends on the 
order of the factors because the product is not commutative: 
 
 
a −1 b ≠ b a −1 
 
 
Obviously the quotient of proportional vectors with the same direction and sense 
is equal to the quotient of their moduli. When the vectors have different directions, their 
quotient can be represented by a parallelogram, which allows to extend the concept of 
Figure 1.9 

8 
RAMON  GONZALEZ  CALVET 
vector proportionality. We say that a is proportional to c as b is to d when their moduli 
are proportional and the angle between a and c is equal to the angle between b and d1: 
 
 
a c −1 = b d −1    ⇔ 
ac−1 =bd−1 
and 
   α(a, c) = α(b, d) 
 
Then the parallelogram formed by a and b is similar to that formed by c and d, 
being α(a, c) the angle of rotation from the first to the second one. 
The inverse of a product of several vectors is the product of the inverses with the 
exchanged order, as can be easily seen from the associative property: 
 
( a b c ) −1 =  c −1 b −1 a −1 
 
 
Hierarchy of algebraic operations 
 
Like the algebra of real numbers, and in order to simplify the algebraic notation, 
I shall use the following hierarchy for the vector operations explained above: 
1) The parenthesis, whose content will be firstly operated. 
2) The power with any exponent (square, inverse, etc.). 
3) The outer and inner product, which have the same hierarchy level but must 
be operated before the geometric product. 
4) The geometric product. 
5) The addition. 
 
As an example, some algebraic expressions are given with the simplified 
expression at the left hand and its meaning using parenthesis at the right hand: 
 
a ∧ b c ∧ d = ( a ∧ b ) ( c ∧ d ) 
 
a2 b ∧ c + 3 = ( ( a2 ) ( b ∧ c ) ) + 3 
 
a + b · c d e = a + ( ( b · c ) d e ) 
 
 
Geometric algebra of the vectorial plane 
 
The set of all the vectors on the plane together with the operations of vector 
addition and product of vectors by real numbers is a two-dimensional space usually 
called the vector plane V2. The geometric product generates new elements (the complex 
numbers) not included in the vector plane. So, the geometric (or Clifford) algebra of a 
vectorial space is defined as the set of all the elements generated by products of vectors, 
for which the geometric product is an inner operation. The geometric algebra of the 
Euclidean vector plane is usually noted as Cl2,0(R) or simply as Cl2. Making a 
parallelism with probability, the sample space is the set of elemental results of a certain 
                                                            
1 William Rowan Hamilton defined the quaternions as quotients of two vectors in the way that 
similar parallelograms located at the same plane in the space represent the same quaternion 
(Elements of Quaternions, posthumously edited in 1866, Chelsea Publishers 1969, vol I, see p. 
113 and fig. 34). In the vectorial plane a quaternion is reduced to a complex number. The 
quaternions were discovered by Hamilton (October 16th, 1843) before the geometric product by 
Clifford (1878).

random experiment. From the sample space Ω, the union ∪ and intersection ∩ generate 
the Boole algebra A(Ω), which includes all the possible events. In the same manner, the 
addition and geometric product generate the geometric algebra of the vectorial space. 
Then both sample and vectorial space play similar roles as generators of the Boole and 
geometric (Clifford) algebras respectively.

2. A BASE OF VECTORS FOR THE PLANE 
 
 
 
Linear combination of two vectors 
 
 
Every vector w on the plane is always a linear combination of two independent 
vectors u and v: 
 
 
w = a u + b v  
a, b real 
 
Because of this, the plane has dimension equal to 2. In order to calculate the coefficients 
of linear combination a and b, we multiply w by u and v at both sides and subtract the 
results: 
 
 
u w = a u2 + b u v     and    w u = a u2 + b v u      ⇒     u w − w u = b ( u v − v u ) 
 
 
v w = a v u + b v2     and    w v = a u v + b v2      ⇒     w v − v w = a ( u v − v u )

The resolution of a vector as a linear combination of two independent vectors is a 
very frequent operation and also the foundation of the coordinates method. 
 
 
 
Base and components 
 
 
Any set of two independent vectors {e1 , e2} can be taken as a base of the vector 
plane. Every vector u can be written as linear combination of the base vectors: 
 
 
u = u1 e1 + u2 e2 
 
The coefficients of this linear combination u1, u2 are the components of the vector in this 
base. Then a vector will be represented as a pair of components: 
 
 
u = ( u1, u2 ) 
 
The components depend on the base, so that a change of base leads to a change of the 
components of the given vector. 
 
We must only add components to add vectors: 
 
 
v = ( v1, v2 ) 
 
 
u + v = ( u1 + v1 , u2 + v2) 
 
The expression of the geometric product with components is obtained by means of 
the distributive property: 
 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
11 
 
u v = ( u1 e1 + u2 e2 ) ( v1 e1 + v2 e2 ) = u1 v1 e1
2 + u2 v2 e2
2 + u1 v2 e1 e2+ u2 v1 e2 e1 
 
u v =  u1 v1 | e1 |2 + u2 v2 | e2 |2 +( u1 v2 + u2 v1 ) e1 · e2 + ( u1 v2 − u2 v1 ) e1 ∧ e2 
 
Hence the expression of the square of the vector modulus written in components is: 
 
 
| u |2 = u2 = u1
2 | e1 |2 + u2
2 | e2 |2 + 2 u1 u2 e1 · e2 
 
 
 
Orthonormal bases 
 
 
Any base is valid to describe vectors using 
components, although the orthonormal bases, for 
which both e1 and e2 are unitary and perpendicular 
(such as the canonical base shown in the figure 2.1), 
are the more convenient and suitable: 
 
 
e1 ⊥ e2  
e1 = e2 = 1 
 
For every orthonormal base : 
 
e1
2 =  e2
2 = 1  
   e1 e2 = − e2 e1 
 
The product e1 e2 represents a square of unity area. The square power of this product is 
equal to −1: 
 
 
( e1 e2 )2 = e1 e2 e1 e2 = − e1 e1 e2 e2 = −1 
 
For an orthonormal base, the geometric product of two vectors becomes: 
 
 
u v = u1 v1 + u2 v2 + ( u1 v2 − u2 v1 ) e1 e2 
 
Note that the first and second summands are real while the third is an area. Therefore it 
follows that they are respectively the inner and outer products: 
 
 
u · v = u1 v1 + u2 v2 
 
 
u ∧ v = ( u1 v2 − u2 v1 ) e1 e2 
 
Also, the modulus of a vector is calculated from the self inner product: 
 
 
u2 = u1
2 + u2

The values of sine and cosine determine a unique angle α in the range 0<α<2π. 
The angle between two vectors is a sensed magnitude having positive sign if it is 
counterclockwise and negative sign if it is clockwise. Thus this angle depends on the 
order of the vectors in the outer (and geometric) product. For example, let us consider the 
vectors (figure 2.2) u and v: 
 
 
u = (−2, 2 )

Also we may take the angle α( u, v ) = 4.5705...−2π = −1.7127... The angle so obtained is 
always that going from the first to the second vector, being unique within a period. 
 
Other application of the outer product is the calculus of areas. Using the 
expression with components, the area 
(considered as a positive real number) 
of the parallelogram formed by u and v 
is: 
 
    A = u ∧ v = u1 v2 − u2 v1= 14 
 
When calculating the area of 
any triangle we must only divide the 
outer product of any two sides by 2.

3. THE COMPLEX NUMBERS 
 
 
Subalgebra of the complex numbers 
 
If {e1, e2} is the canonical base of the vector plane V2, its geometric algebra is 
defined as the vector space generated by the elements {1, e1, e2, e1e2} together with the 
geometric product, so that the geometric algebra Cl2 has dimension four. The unitary area 
e1e2 is usually noted as e12. Due to the associative character of the geometric product, the 
geometric algebra is an associative algebra with identity. The complete table for the 
geometric product is the following:

This is the subalgebra of complex numbers. e12 , the imaginary unity, is usually noted as i. 
They are called complex numbers because their product is commutative like for the real 
numbers. 
 
 
 
Binomial, polar and trigonometric form of a complex number 
 
 
Every complex number z written in the binomial form is: 
 
 
z = a + b e12 
 
a, b   real 
 
where a and b are the real and imaginary components respectively. The modulus of a 
complex number is calculated in the same way as the modulus of any element of the 
geometric algebra by means of the Pythagorean theorem: 
 
 
z2 =  a + b e122 = a2 + b2 
 
 
Since every complex number can be written as a product of two vectors u and v  
forming a certain angle α: 

14 
RAMON  GONZALEZ  CALVET 
 
z = u v = u v ( cos α + e12 sin α )  
 
we may represent a complex number as 
a parallelogram with sides being the 
vectors u and v. But there are infinite 
pairs of vectors u' and v' whose product 
is the complex z provided that: 
 
uv = u'v'  and 
α = α' 
 
 
All the parallelograms having 
the same area and obliquity represent a 
given complex (they are equivalent) independently of the length and orientation of one 
side.(figure 3.1). The trigonometric and polar forms of a complex number z specifies its 
modulus zand argument α : 
 
 
z = z ( cos α + e12 sin α ) = z α 
 
 
A complex number can be written using the exponential function, but firstly we 
must prove the Euler’s identity: 
 
 
exp(α e12) = cos α + e12 sin α  
α  real 
 
The exponential of an imaginary number is 
defined in the same manner as for a real 
number:

As shown in the figure 3.2 (for n = 5), the limit 
is a power of n rotations with angle α,/n or 
equivalently a rotation of angle α. 
 
Now a complex number written in 
exponential form is: 
 
 
 
z = z exp(α e12 ) 
 
 
 
Algebraic operations with complex numbers 
 
 
Each algebraic operation is more easily calculated in a form than in another 
according to the following scheme:   
 
 
 
addition / subtraction 
↔  
binomial form 
 
 
product / quotient  
↔ 
binomial or polar form 
 
 
powers / roots  
 
↔ 
polar form

The binomial form is suitable for the addition because both real components must 
be added and also the imaginary ones, e.g.: 
 
 
z = 3 + 4 e12 
 
t = 2 − 5 e12 
 
 
z + t = 3 + 4 e12 + 2 − 5 e12  = 5 − e12 
 
If the complex numbers are written in another form, they must be converted to the 
binomial form, e.g. 
 
 
z = 23π / 4 
t = 4π / 6

In order to write the result in polar form, the modulus must be calculated:

When multiplying complex numbers in binomial form, we apply the distributive 
property taken into account that the square of the imaginary unity is −1, e.g.: 
 
 (−2 + 5 e12 ) ( 3 −4 e12 ) = −6 + 8 e12 + 15 e12 − 20 ( e12 )2 = −6 + 20 + 23 e12 = 14 + 23 e12 
 
 
The exponential of an addition of arguments (real or complex) is equal to the 
product of exponential functions of each argument. Applying this characteristic property 
to the product of complex numbers in exponential form, we have: 
 
 
z t = z exp(α e12 ) t exp( β e12 ) = z t exp[ (α + β ) e12 ] 
 
from where the product of complex numbers in polar form is obtained by multiplying 
both moduli and adding both arguments.: 

16 
RAMON  GONZALEZ  CALVET 
 
 
zα tβ = z t α + β 
 
 
One may subtract 2π to the 
resulting argument in order to keep it 
between 0 and 2π. The product of 
two complex numbers z and t is the 
geometric operation consisting in the 
rotation 
of 
the 
parallelogram 
representing 
the 
first 
complex 
number 
until 
it 
touches 
the 
parallelogram representing the second 
complex number. When they contact 
in a unitary vector v (figure 3.3), the parallelogram formed by the other two vectors is the 
product of both complex numbers:  
 
 
z = u v  
t = v w  
v2 = 1 
 
 
z t = u v v w = u w 
 
 
This geometric construction is always possible because a parallelogram can be 
lengthened or widened maintaining the area so that one side has unity length. 
 
The conjugate of a complex number (symbolised with an asterisk) is that number 
whose imaginary part has opposite sign: 
 
   z = a + b e12  
z* = a − b e12 
 
The 
geometric 
meaning 
of 
the 
conjugation is a permutation of the 
vectors whose product is the complex 
number (figure 3.4). In this case, the 
inner product is preserved while the 
outer product changes the sign. The 
product of a complex number and its 
conjugate is the square of the modulus: 
 
 
z z* = u v v u = u2 = z2 
 
 
The quotient of complex numbers is defined as the product by the inverse. The 
inverse of a complex number is equal to the conjugate divided by the square of the 
modulus:

The best way to calculate the power of a complex number with natural exponent is 
through the polar form, although for low exponents the binomial form and the Newton 
formula is often used, e.g.: 
 
 
( 2 − 3 e12 )3 = 23 − 3 · 22 e12 + 3 · 2 e12
2 − e12
3 = 8 − 12 e12 − 6 + e12 = 2 − 11 e12 
 
 
From the characteristic property of the exponential function it follows that the 
modulus of a power of a complex number is the power of its modulus, and the argument 
of this power is the argument of the complex number multiplied by the exponent: 
  
 
(
)

This is a very useful rule for large exponents, e.g.: 
  
 
( 2 + 2 e12 )1000 = ( 2 
2 π/4 )1000 = [( 2 
2  )1000]250 π = 21500
0 = 21500  
 
When the argument exceeds 2π, divide by this value and take the remainder, in order to 
have the argument within the period 0<α <2π. 
 
Since a root is the inverse operation of a power, its value is obtained by extracting 
the root of the modulus and dividing the argument by the index n. But a complex number 
of argument α may be also represented by the arguments α +2 π k. Their division by the 
index n yields n different arguments within a period, corresponding to n different roots:

Permutation of complex numbers and vectors 
 
 
The permutative property of the vectors is intimately related with the commutative 
property of the product of complex numbers. Let z and t be complex numbers and a, b, c 
and d vectors fulfilling: 
 
 
z = a b  
 
t = c d 
 
Then the following equalities are equivalent: 
 
 
z t = t z  
⇔ 
a b c d = c d a b 
 

18 
RAMON  GONZALEZ  CALVET 
 
A complex number z and a vector c do not commute, but they can be permuted by 
conjugating the complex number: 
 
 
z c = a b c = c b a = c z* 
 
 
Every real number commute with any vector. However every imaginary number 
anticommute with any vector, because the imaginary unity e12 anticommute with e1 as 
well as with e2: 
 
 
z c = − c z 
z imaginary 
 
 
 
The complex plane 
 
 
In the complex plane, the complex numbers are represented taking the real 
component as the abscissa and the imaginary component as the ordinate. The vectorial 
plane differs from the complex plane in the fact that the vectorial plane is a plane of 
absolute directions whereas the complex plane is a plane of relative directions with 
respect to the real axis, to which we may assign any direction. As explained in more detail 
in the following chapter, the unitary complex numbers are rotation operators applied to 
vectors. The following equality shows the ambivalence of the Cartesian coordinates in the 
Euclidean plane:

Due to a careless use, often the complex numbers have been improperly thought as 
vectors on the plane, furnishing the confusion between the complex and vector planes to 
our pupils. It will be argued that this has been very fruitful, but this argument cannot 
satisfy geometers, who search the fundamentals of the geometry. On the other hand, some 
physical magnitudes of a clearly vectorial kind have been taken improperly as complex 
numbers, specially in quantum mechanics. Because of this, I’m astonished when seeing 
how the inner and outer products transform in a special commutative and anti-
commutative products of complex numbers. The relation between vectors and complex 
numbers is stated in the following way: If u is a fixed unitary vector, then every vector a 
is mapped to a unique complex z fulfilling: 
 
  
a = u z  
with 
u2 = 1 
 
Also other vector b is mapped to a complex number t: 
  
 
b = u t 
 
 
The outer and inner products of the vectors a and b can be written now using the 
complex numbers z and t: 
 
 
a ∧ b = 2
1 ( a b − b a ) = 2
1  ( u z u t − u t u z ) = 2
1 u2 ( z* t − t* z ) =

1 ( a b + b a ) = 2
1 ( u z u t + u z u t ) = 2
1  ( z* t + t* z ) = zR tR + zI tI  
 
where zR, tR, zI, tI are the real and imaginary components of z and t. These products have 
been called improperly scalar and exterior products of complexes. So, I repeat again that 
complex quantities must be distinguished from vectorial quantities, and relative directions 
(complex numbers) from absolute directions (vectors). A guide for doing this is the 
reversion, under which the vectors are reversed while the complex number are not1. 
 
 
 
Complex analytic functions 
 
 
The complex numbers are a commutative algebra where we can study functions as 
for the real numbers. A function f(x) is said to be analytical if its complex derivative 
exists:

This means that the derivative measured in any direction must give the same result. If f(x) 
= a + b e12 and z = x + y e12 , the derivatives following the abscissa and ordinate directions 
must be equal:

Due to its linearity, now the derivative in any direction are also equal. A consequence of 
these conditions is the fact that the sum of both second derivatives (the Laplacian) 
vanishes, that is, both components are harmonic functions:

1 A physical example is the alternating current. The voltage V and intensity I in an electric circuit 
are continuously rotating vectors. The energy E dissipated by the circuit is the inner product of 
both vectors, E = V · I. The impedance Z of the circuit is of course a complex number (it is 
invariant under a reversion). The intensity vector can be calculated as the geometric product of the 
voltage vector multiplied by the inverse of the impedance I = V Z−1 . If we take as reference a 
continuously rotating direction, then V and I are replaced by pseudo complex numbers, but 
properly they are vectors.

The values of a harmonic function (therefore the value of f(z)) within a region are 
determined by those values at the boundary of this region. We will return to this matter

At the positive real half axis, this logarithm is not analytic because it is not continuous.  
 
Now let us see the Cauchy’s theorem: if a function is analytic in a simply

within this domain is zero. If the analytic function is ( )

simply connected domain D and z1 and z2 are two points of D, then the definite integral 
between these points has a unique value independently of the integration trajectory, 
which is equal to the difference of the values of the primitive F(z) at both points:

If f(z) is an analytic function (with a unique value) inside the region D bounded by 
the closed path C, then the Cauchy integral formula is fulfilled for a counterclockwise 
path orientation:

Obviously, the integral does not vanish because the integrand is not analytic at z0 . 
However, it is analytic at the other points of the region D, so that the integration path from 
its beginning to its end passes always through an analyticity region, and by the former 
theorem the definite integral must have a constant value, independently of the fact that 
both extremes coincide. Now we integrate following a circular path

because we can take any radius and also the limit r → 0. The consequence of this theorem 
is immediate: the values of f(z) at a closed path C determine its value at any z0 inside the 
region bounded by C. This is a characteristic property of the harmonic functions, already 
commented above.

The only assumption made in the deduction is the analyticity of f(z). So this series is 
convergent within the largest circle centred at the origin where the function is analytic 
(that is, the convergence circle touches the closest singular point). The Taylor series is 
unique for any analytic function. On the other hand, every analytic function has a Taylor 
series. 
 
Instead of the origin we can take a series centred at another point z0. In this case, 
following the same way as above, one arrives to the MacLaurin series:

The exponential has not any singular point. Then the radius of convergence is infinite. 
 
In order to find a convergent series for a function which is analytic in an annulus 
although not at its centre (for r1 <z − z0< r2 as shown in figure 3.5), we must add 
powers with negative exponents, obtaining the Lauren series:

where the path C encloses the central circle. When f(x) is not analytic at some point of this 
central circle (e.g. z0), the powers of negative exponent appear in the Laurent series. The 
coefficient a−1 is called the residue of f.  The Lauren series is the addition of a series of 
powers with negative exponent and the McLaurin series:

and is convergent only when both series are convergent, so that the annulus goes from the 
radius of convergence of the first series (r1) to the radius of convergence of the McLaurin 
series (r2). 
 
Let us review singular points, the points where an analytic function is not defined. 
An isolated singular point may be a removable singularity, an essential singularity or a 
pole. A point z0 is a removable singularity if the limit of the function at this point exists 
and, therefore, we may remove the singularity taking the limit as the value of the function 
at z0. A point z0 is a pole of a function f(z) if it is a zero of the function 1/f(z). Finally, z0 is 
an essential singularity if both limits of f(z) and 1/f(z) at z0 do not exist. 
 
The Lauren series centred at a removable singularity has not powers with negative 
exponent. The series centred at a pole has a finite number of powers with negative 
exponent, and that centred at an essential singularity has an infinite number of powers 
with negative exponent. Let us see some examples. The function sin z / z has a removable 
singularity at z = 0:

So the series has only positive exponents. 
 
The function exp(1/z) has an essential singularity at z = 0 . From the series of 
exp(z), we obtain a Lauren series with an infinite number of powers with negative 
exponent by changing z for 1/z. Also the radius of convergence is infinite:

Since the function is analytic in the entire plane, we may take the radius r as large as we 
wish. In consequence, the derivative must be null and the function constant, which is the 
proof of the theorem. 
 
A main consequence of the Liouville’s theorem is the fundamental theorem of 
algebra: any polynomial of degree n has always n zeros (not necessarily different):  
 
 
p(z) = a0 + a1 z + a2 z2 + ... + an zn = 0    ⇒    ∃  zi      i ∈{1, .., n}        p(zi) = 0 
 
where a0, a1, a2, ... an are complex coefficients. For real coefficients, the zeros are whether 
real or pairs of conjugate complex numbers. The proof is by supposing that p(z) has not 
any zero. In this case f(z) = 1/p(z) is analytic and bounded (because p(z)→ 0 for z→ ∞) 
in the whole plane. From the Liouville’s theorem f(z) and p(z) should be constant 
becoming in contradiction with the fact that p(z) is a polynomial. In conclusion p(z) has at 
least one zero. 
 
According to the division algorithm, the division of the polynomial p(z) by z − b 
decreases the degree of the quotient q(z) by a unity, and yields a complex number r as 
remainder: 
 
 
p(z) = (z − b) q(z) + r 
 
The substitution of z by b gives: 
 
 
p(b) = r 
 
That is, the remainder of the division of a polynomial by z − b is equal to its numerical 
value for z = b . On the other hand, if b is a zero zi, the remainder vanishes and we have an 
exact division: 
 
 
p(z) = (z − zi) q(z) 
 
Again q(z) has at least one zero. In each division, we find a new zero and a new factor, so 
that the polynomial completely factorises with as many zeros and factors as the degree of 
the polynomial, which ends the proof:

4. TRANSFORMATIONS OF VECTORS 
 
 
The transformations of vectors are mappings from the vector plane to itself. Those 
transformations preserving the modulus of vectors, such as rotations and reflections, are 
called isometries and those which preserve angles between vectors are said to be 
conformal. Besides rotations and reflections, the inversions and dilatations are also 
conformal transformations. 
 
 
Rotations 
 
 
A rotation through an angle α is the 
geometric operation consisting in turning a 
vector until it forms an angle α  with the 
previous orientation. The positive direction of 
angles is counterclockwise (figure 4.1). Under 
rotations the modulus of any vector is 
preserved. According to the definition of 
geometric product, the multiplication of a 
vector v by a unitary complex number with 
argument α produces a vector v' rotated 
through an angle α with regard to v. 
 
 
v' = v 1α = v ( cos α + e12 sin α ) 
 
 
This algebraic expression for rotations, when applied to a real or complex number 
instead of vector, modifies its value. However, real numbers are invariant under rotations 
and the parallelograms can be turned without changing the complex number which they 
represent. Therefore this expression for rotations, although being useful for vectors, is not 
valid for complex numbers. In order to remodel it, we factorise the unitary complex 
number into a product of two complex numbers with half argument. According to the 
permutative property, we can permute the vector and the first complex number whenever 
writing the conjugate: 
 
v' = v 1α = v 1α/2 1α/2 = 1−α/2  v 1α/2 = ( cos 2
α − e12 sin 2
α  ) v ( cos 2
α  + e12 sin 2
α ) 
 
The algebraic expression for rotations now found preserves complex numbers: 
 
 
z' = 1−α/2  z 1α/2 = z 
 
Let us calculate the rotation of the vector 4 e1 through 2π / 3 by multiplying it by the 
unitary complex with this argument:

With the expression of half angle, it is not necessary that the complex number has unity 
modulus because: 
 
 
z =z1α/2  
 
z −1 =1−α/2 z−1 
 
Then, the rotation through an angle α can be written as: 
 
 
v' = z −1 v z 
 
The composition of two successive rotations implies the product of both complex 
numbers, whose argument is the addition of the angles of both rotations.  
 
 
v'' = 1 −β / 2 v' 1β / 2 = 1 −β / 2 1 −α / 2 v 1α / 2 1β  / 2 = 1− (  α + β ) / 2 v 1 ( α + β ) / 2 
 
 
 
 
Reflections 
 
A reflection of a vector in a direction is 
the geometric transformation which preserves 
the component having this direction and 
changes the sign of the perpendicular 
component (figure 4.2). The product of 
proportional vectors is commutative and that 
of orthogonal vectors is anti-commutative. 
Because of this, the reflected vector v' may be 
obtained as the multiplication of the vector v 
by the unitary vector u of the reflection axis at 
the left and right hand sides:    
 
 
v' = u v u = u ( v|| + v⊥ ) u = u v|| u + u v⊥ u = v|| − v⊥  
with   u2 = 1 
 
where v|| and v⊥ are the components of v proportional and perpendicular to u respectively.  
 
Instead of the unitary vector u, any vector d having the axis direction can be 
introduced in the expression for reflections whenever we write its inverse at the left side 
of the vector:

Although the reflection does not change the absolute value of the angle between 
vectors, it changes its sign. Under reflections, real numbers remain invariant but the 
complex numbers become conjugate because a reflection generates a symmetric 
parallelogram (figure 4.3) and changes the sign of the imaginary part:

For example, let us calculate the reflection 
of the vector 3 e1 + 2 e2 with regard to the 
direction e1 − e2. The resulting vector will 
be: 
 
 
v' = 2
1 ( e1 − e2 ) ( 3 e1 + 2 e2 ) ( e1 − e2 ) = 2
1  ( e1 − e2 ) ( 1 − 5 e12 ) = − 2 e1 − 3 e2 
 
 
 
Inversions 
 
 
The inversion of radius r is the geometric transformation which maps every vector 
v on r2 v −1 , that is, on a vector having the same direction but with a modulus equal to r2 / 
v: 
 
 
v' = r2 v −1 
 
r real 
 
 
This operation is a generalisation of 
the inverse of a vector in the geometric 
algebra (radius r = 1). It is called inversion 
of radius r, because all the vectors with 
modulus r, whose heads lie on a 
circumference with this radius, remain 
invariant (figure 4.4). The vectors whose 
heads are placed inside the circle of radius r 
transform into vectors having the head 
outside and reciprocally. 
 
The inversion transforms complex 
numbers into proportional complex numbers with the same argument (figure 4.5): 
 
 
v' = r2 v −1 
w' = r2 w −1 
z = v w 
 
z' = v' w' = r4 v −1 w −1 = r4 v w v −2 w −2 =

Dilatations 
 
 
The 
dilatation 
is 
that 
geometric 
transformation 
which 
enlarges or shortens a vector, that is, 
it increases (or decreases) k times the 
modulus of any vector preserving its 
orientation. The dilatation is simply 
the product by a real number k 
 
 
v' = k v  
 k  real 
 
 
The most transformations of 
vectors that will be used in this book 
are combinations of these four 
elementary transformations. Many 
physical laws are invariant under some of these transformations. In geometry, from the 
vector transformations we define the transformations of points on the plane, indispensable 
for solving geometric problems.

SECOND PART: THE GEOMETRY OF THE EUCLIDEAN PLANE 
 
 
 
A complete description of the Euclidean plane needs not only directions (given by 
vectors) but also positions. Points represent locations on the plane. Then, the plane R2 is 
the set of all the points we may draw on a fictitious sheet of infinite extension.  
 
Recall that points are noted with capital Latin letters, vectors and complex 
numbers with lowercase Latin letters, and angles with Greek letters. A vector going from 
the point P to the point Q will be symbolised by PQ and the line passing through both 
points will be distinguished as PQ . 
 
 
 
Translations 
 
 
A translation v is the geometric operation which moves a point P in the direction 
and length of the vector v to give the point Q: 
 
 
+ : R2 × V2 → R2 
 
 
      (P, v) → Q = P + v 
  
Then the vector v is the oriented segment going from P to Q. The set of points together 
with vectors corresponding to translations is called the affine plane1 (R2 , V2, +). From this 
equality a vector is defined as a subtraction of two points, usually noted as PQ : 
 
 
v = Q − P = PQ 
 
The sign of addition is suitable for translations, because the composition of translations 
results in an addition of their vectors: 
 
 
Q = P + v 
R = Q + w 
 
R = ( P + v ) + w = P + ( v + w ) 
 
 
 
5. POINTS AND STRAIGHT LINES 
 
 
Coordinate systems 
 
 
Given an origin of coordinates O, 
every point P on the plane is described by the 
position vector OP traced from the origin. The 
coordinates (c1, c2) of a point are the 
components of the postion vector in the chosen 
vector base {e1, e2}: 
 
 
OP = c1 e1 + c2 e2 
 
Then every point is given by means of a pair of 
                                                 
1 The affine plane does not imply a priori an Euclidean or pseudo-Euclidean character. 
Figure 5.1 

32 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
 
coordinates: 
 
 
P = (c1, c2) 
 
For example, the position vector shown in the figure 5.1 is: 
 
 
 OP = 2 e1 + 3 e2 
 
and hence the coordinates of P are (2, 3). 
 
 A coordinate system is the set {O; e1, e2}, that is, the origin of coordinates O 
together with the base of vectors. The coordinates of a point depend on the coordinate 
system to which they belong. If the origin or any base vector is changed, the coordinates 
of a point are also modified. For example, let us calculate the coordinates of the points P 
and Q in the figure 5.2. Both coordinate systems have the same vector base but the origin 
is different: 
 
 
S = {O; e1, e2}  
S' = {O'; e1, e2}  
 
Since OP = 2 e1 + 3 e2  and  O'P = 2 e2 , 
the coordinates of the point P in the 
coordinate 
systems 
S 
and 
S' 
are 
respectively: 
 
       P = (2, 3)S = (0, 2)S' 
 
 
Analogously:  
 
  OQ = − 4 e1 + e2   and    O'Q = − 6 e1 
 
Q = (−4, 1)S = (−6, 0)S' 
 
The coordinate axes are the straight lines passing through the origin and having 
the direction of the base vectors. All the points lying on a coordinate axis have the other 
coordinate equal to zero. 
 
If a point Q is obtained from a point P by the translation v then: 
 
 
Q = P + v 
⇔ 
OQ = OP + v  
 
that is, we must add the components of the translation vector v  to the coordinates of the 
point P in order to obtain the coordinates of the point Q: 
 
 
(q1, q2) = (p1, p2 ) + (v1, v2) 
  
For example, let us apply the translation v = 3 e1 − 5 e2 to the point P = (−6, 7): 
 
 
Q = P + v = (−6, 7 ) + (3, −5) = (−3, 2) 
 
On the other hand, given two points, the translation vector having these points as 
extremes is found by subtracting their coordinates. For instance, the vector from P = (2, 5) 
Figure 5.2 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
33 
 
 
 
to  Q = (−3, 4) is: 
 
 
PQ = Q − P = (−3, 4 ) − ( 2, 5) = (−5, −1 ) = −5 e1 − e2 
 
Remember the general rule for operations between points and vectors: 
 
 
coordinates = coordinates + components 
 
 
components = coordinates − coordinates 
 
 
 
Barycentric coordinates 
 
Why is the plane described by complicated concepts such as translations and the 
coordinate system instead of using points as fundamental elements? This question was 
studied and answered by Möbius in Der Barycentrische Calculus (1827) and Grassmann 
in Die Ausdehnungslehre (1844). From the figure 5.3 it follows that: 
 
   OR = c1 e1 + c2 e2 = c1 OP + c2 OQ 
 
When writing all vectors as difference of 
points and isolating the generic point R, 
we obtain: 
 
     R = ( 1 − c1 − c2 ) O + c1 P + c2 Q 
 
That is, a coordinate system is a set of 
three non-aligned points {O, P, Q} so that 
every point on the plane is a linear 
combination of these three points with 
coefficients whose addition is equal to the unity. The coefficients (1 − c1 − c2 , c1, c2) are 
usually called barycentric coordinates, although they only differ from the usual 
coordinates in a third dependent coordinate.  
 
 
 
 
Distance between two points and area 
 
 
The distance between two points is the modulus of the vector going from one 
point to the other: 
 
 
d(P, Q) = PQ = Q − P 
 
 
The distance has the following properties: 
 
1) The distance from a point to itself is zero:  d(P, P) = PP = 0 and the reverse 
assertion: if the distance between two points is null then both points are coincident: 
  
 
d(P, Q) = 0 
⇒   PQ= 0     ⇒ 
 Q − P = 0      ⇒      P = Q 
 
 
2) The distance has the symmetrical property:  
Figure 5.3 

34 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
 
 
 
d(P, Q) = PQ = QP = d(Q, P) 
 
 
3) The distance fulfils the triangular 
inequality: the addition of the lengths of any 
two sides of a triangle is always higher than 
or equal to the length of the third side (figure 
5.4). 
 
       d(P, Q) + d(Q, R) ≥ d(P, R) 
 
that is: 
 
   PQ +QR ≥ PR = PQ +QR 
 
The proof of the triangular inequality is based on the fact that the product of the 
modulus of two vectors is always higher than or equal to the inner product: 
 
  
PQ QR ≥ PQ  · QR =PQQR cos α 
 
Adding the square of both vectors to the left and right hand sides, one has: 
 
 
PQ2 + QR2 + 2 PQQR ≥ PQ2 + QR2  + 2 PQ · QR 
 
 
(PQ + QR)2  ≥ (PQ + QR )2 
 
 
PQ + QR ≥ PQ + QR 
 
 
For any kind of coordinate system the distance is calculated through the inner 
product: 
 
 
d2(P, Q) = PQ2 = PQ · PQ 
 
 
The oriented area of a parallelogram is the outer product of both non parallel sides. 
If P, Q and R are three consecutive vertices of the parallelogram, the area is: 
 
 
A = PQ ∧ QR 
 
Then, the area of the triangle with these vertices is the half of the parallelogram area. 
 
 
A =  2
1 PQ ∧ QR 
 
 
If the coordinates are given in the system formed by three non-linear points {O, X, 
Y}: 
 
 
P = ( 1 − xP − yP ) O + xP X + yP Y 
 
 
Q = ( 1 − xQ − yQ ) O + xQ X + yQ Y

Condition of alignment of three points 
 
 
Three points P, Q, R are said to be aligned, that is, they lie on a line, if the vectors 
PQ and PR are proportional, and therefore commute. 
 
 
P, Q, R aligned  
⇔ 
PR = k PQ  
⇔ 
PQ ∧ PR = 0 ⇔   
 
 
PQ PR − PR PQ = 0 ⇔   
 PQ PR = PR PQ 
⇔ 
PR = PQ −1 PR PQ

that is, the barycentric coordinates of the three points are linearly dependent. According to 
the previous chapter, the last equality means that the vector PR remains unchanged after a 
reflection in the direction PQ. Obviously, this is only feasible when PR is proportional to 
PQ, that is, when the three points are aligned.

Cartesian coordinates 
 
 
The coordinates (x, y) of any system having an orthonormal base of vectors are 
called Cartesian coordinates from Descartes2. The horizontal coordinate x is called 
abscissa and the vertical coordinate y ordinate. In this kind of bases, the square of a vector 
is equal to the sum of the squares of both components, leading to the following formula 
for the distance between two points: 
 
P = (xP, yP) 
 
Q = (xQ, yQ)

For example, the triangle with vertices P = (2, 5), Q = (3, 2) and R = (−4, 1) have 
the following sides: 
 
 
PQ = Q − P = ( 3, 2 ) − ( 2, 5 ) = ( 1, −3) = e1 − 3 e2  
  PQ = 10  
 
 
QR = R − Q = (−4, 1 ) − ( 3, 2 ) = (−7, −1 ) = −7 e1 − e2 
  QR = 50  
 
 
RP = P − R = ( 2, 5 ) − (−4, 1 ) = ( 6, 4 ) = 6 e1 + 4 e2   PR =

Vectorial and parametric equations of a line 
 
 
The condition of alignment of three points is the starting point to deduce the 
equations of a straight line. A line is determined whether by two points or by a point and a 
direction defined by its direction vector, which is not unique because any other 
proportional vector will also be a direction vector for this line. Known the direction vector 
v and a point P on the line, the vectorial  equation gives the generic point R on the line: 
 
 
r: {v, P} 
P = (xp, yP) 
 
R = (x, y) 
 
 
PR = k v 
 
 
Separating coordinates, the parametric equation of the line is obtained: 
 
 
(x, y) = (xp, yp) + k (v1, v2) 
 
Here the position of a point on the line depends on the real parameter k, usually identified 
                                                 
2 If the x-axis is horizontal and the y-axis vertical, an orthonormal base of vectors is called 
canonical.

with the time in physics. 
 
Knowing two points P, Q on the line, a direction vector v can be obtained by 
subtraction of both points: 
 
 
r: {P, Q} 
v = Q − P 
 
In this case, the vectorial and parametric equations become: 
 
 
PR = k PQ 
⇔ 
R = P + k ( Q − P ) = P ( 1 − k ) + k Q 
 
 
The parameter k indicates in which 
proportion the point R is closer to P than to 
Q. For example, the midpoint of the 
segment PQ can be calculated with k = 1/2. 
The figure 5.5 shows where the point R is 
located on the line PQ as a function of the 
parameter k. In this way, all the points of 
the line are mapped to the real numbers 
incorporating the order relation and the 
topologic properties of this set to the line3.  
 
 
Algebraic equation and distance 
from a point to a line 
 
 
If the point R belongs to the line, the vector PR and the direction vector v are 
proportional and commute: 
 
PR v = v PR 
⇔ 
PR v − v PR = 0    ⇔ 
 
PR ∧ v = 0 
⇔ 
PR  = v −1 PR v 
 
The last equation is the algebraic equation and 
shows that the vector PR remains invariant 
under a reflection in the direction of the line. 
That is, the point R only belongs to the line 
when it coincides with the point reflected in 
this line. Separating components, the two-point 
equation of the line arises:

    3 In the book Geometria Axiomàtica (Institut d'Estudis Catalans, Barcelona, 1993), Agustí 
Reventós defines a bijection between the points of a line and the real numbers preserving the order 
relation as a simplifying axiom of the foundations of geometry. I use implicitly this axiom in this 
book.

where v = ( v1, v2 ). 
 
If the point R does not belong to the line, the reflected point R' differs from R. This 
allows to calculate the distance from R to the line as the half of the distance between R 
and R' (figure 5.6). The vector going from R to R' is equal to PR' − PR . 
 
  
d( R, r ) = 2

v −1 PR v − v PR=

In this formula, the distance from R to the 
line r is the height of the parallelogram 
formed by the direction vector and (figure 
5.7). 
 
Similar line equations can also be 
deduced using the normal (perpendicular) 
vector n. Like for the direction vector, the 
normal vector is not unique because any 
other proportional vector may also be a 
normal 
vector. 
The 
normal 
vector 
anticommutes with the direction vector of 
the line, and therefore with the vector PR, 
P being a given point and R a general point on the line: 
 
n PR = −PR n    ⇔ 
n PR + PR n = 0   ⇔    n · PR =  0     ⇔ 
PR = − n −1 PR n 
 
 
The last equation is also called the algebraic equation and shows that the vector 
PR is reversed under a reflection in the perpendicular of the line. Taking components, the 
general equation of the line is obtained: 
 
 
n1 (x − xP) + n2 (y − yP) = 0 
 
⇔ 
n1 x + n2 y + c = 0 
 
where n = (n1, n2) and c is a real constant.  
 
When the point R does not lie on the 
line, the point R' reflected of R in the 
perpendicular does not belong to the line. Let 
PR'' be the reversed of PR', or equivalently 
R'' be the symmetric point of R with regard to 
P (figure 5.8). Then, the distance from R to 
the line r is the half of the distance from R to 
R'': 
 
d( R, r ) = 2

This expression is the modulus of the projection of the vector PR upon the perpendicular 
direction. Both formulas of the distance are equivalent because the normal and direction 
vectors anticommute: 
 
 
n v = − v n  
⇔ 
n v + v n = 0 
⇔ 
n · v = 0 
 
Written with components: 
 
 
n1 v1 + n2 v2 = 0 
 
From each vector the other one is easily obtained by exchanging components and altering 
a sign: 
 
 
n = ( n1 , n2 ) = ( v2 , −v1 ) 
 
 
As an application, let us calculate the equation of the line r passing through the 
points (2, 3) and (7, 6). A direction vector is the segment having as extremes both points: 
 
 
v = (7, 6) − (2, 3) = (5, 3) 
 
and an equation for this line is:

n = (3, −5) 
 
3 (x − 2) − 5 (y − 3) = 0 
⇔ 
3 x − 5 y + 9 = 0 
 
Now, let us calculate the distance from the point R = (−2, 1) to the line r. We choose the 
point (2, 3) as the point P on the line: 
 
 
PR = R − P = (−2, 1) − (2, 3) = (−4, −2)

Slope and intercept equations of a line 
 
 
If the ordinate is written as a function of the abscissa, the equation so obtained is 
the slope-intercept equation: 
 
 
y = m x + b 
 
Note that this expression cannot describe the vertical lines whose equation is x = constant. 
The coefficient m is called the slope because it is a measure of the inclination of the line. 
For any two points P and Q on the line we have: 
 
 
yP = m xP + b 
 
 
yQ = m xQ + b 
 
Subtracting both equations: 
 
 
yQ − yP = m (xQ − xP) 
 
we see that the slope is the quotient of 
ordinate increment divided by the abscissa 
increment (figure 5.9):

This quotient is also the trigonometric tangent of the oriented angle between the line and 
the positive abscissa semiaxis. For angles larger than π/2 the slope becomes negative. 
 
b is the ordinate intercepted at the origin, the y-intercept: 
 
 
x = 0 ⇒ 
y = b 
 
If we know the slope and a point on a line, the point-slope equation may be used: 
 
 
y − yP = m (x − xP) 
 
Also, one may write for the intercept equation of a line:

where a and b are the x-intercept and y-intercept of the line with each coordinate axis. 
 
 
Polar equation of a line 
 
 
In this equation, the distance from a fixed point F to the generic point P on the line 
is a function of the angle α with regard to the perpendicular direction (figure 5.10). If d is 
the distance from F to the line, then:

This equation allows to relate easily the

Intersection of two lines and pencil of  
lines 
  
 
The calculation of the intersection 
of two lines is a very usual problem. Let us 
suppose that the first line is given by the point P and the direction vector u and the second 
one by the point Q and the direction vector v. Denoting by R the intersection point, which 
belongs to both lines, we have: 
 
 
R = P + k u = Q + l v  
⇔  
k u − l v = Q − P = PQ 
 
In order to find the coefficients k and l, the vector PQ must be resolved into a linear

The pencil of lines passing through this point is the set of lines whose equations 
are linear combinations of the equations of both given lines:

. Each line of the pencil 
determines a unique value of p, 
independently of the fact that the 
general equation for a line is not 
unique 
If the equation system has a 
unique point as solution, all the lines 
of the pencil are concurrent at this 
point. But in the case of an 
incompatible system, all the lines of 
the pencil are parallel, that is, they

intersect in a point at infinity, which gives generality to the concept of pencil of lines. 
If the common point R is known or given, then the equation of the pencil is written 
as: 
 
 
[ ( 1 − p ) n1 + p n'1 ] ( x − xR ) + [ ( 1 − p ) n2 + p n'2 ] ( y − yR ) = 0 
 
For 0<p<1, the normal and direction vectors of the p-line are respectively comprised 
between the normal and direction vectors of both given lines4. In the other case the vectors 
are out of this region (figure 5.11) 
For example, calculate the equation of the line passing through the point (3, 4) and 
the intersection of the lines 3 x + 2 y + 4 = 0 and 2 x − y + 3 = 0. The equation of the 
pencil of lines is: 
 
( 1 − p ) ( 3 x + 2 y + 4 ) + p ( 2 x − y + 3 ) = 0 
 
The line of this pencil to which the point (3, 4) belongs must fulfil: 
 
 
( 1 − p ) ( 3 ⋅ 3 + 2 ⋅ 4 + 4 ) + p ( 2 ⋅ 3 − 4 + 3 ) = 0 
 
yielding p = 21/16 and the line: 
 
 
27 x − 31 y + 43 = 0 
 
Which is the meaning of the coefficient of linear combination p? Let us write the 
pencil of lines P determined by the lines R and S as: 
 
 
P = ( 1 − p ) R + p S  
 
which implies the same relation for the normal vectors:

4 This statement requires that the angle from the direction vector to the normal vector be a positive 
right angle.

Dual coordinates 
 
 
The duality principle states that any theorem relating incidence of lines and points 
implies a dual counterpart where points and lines have been exchanged. The phrase «two 
points determine a unique line passing through these points» has the dual statement «two 
lines determine a unique point, intersection of these lines». All the geometric facts have an 
algebraic counterpart, and the duality is not an exception. With the barycentric coordinates 
every point R on the plane can be written as linear combination of three non aligned points 
O, P and Q:  
 
 
R = ( 1 − p − q ) O + p P + q Q = (p, q) 
 
where p and q are the coordinates and O the origin. 
 
These three points determine three non parallel lines A, B, and C in the following 
way: 
 
PQ
A =
 
QO
B =
 
OP
C =
  
 
Then the direction vectors vA = PQ, vB = OP, vC = QO are related by: 
 
 
0
=
+
+
C
B
A
v
v
v
 
 
 
 
Note that vB and −vC  are the base of the vectorial plane. 
Any line D on the plane can be written as linear combination of these lines: 
 
 
D = ( 1 − b − c ) A + b B + c C 
 
This means that the general equation (with point coordinates) of D is a linear combination 
of the general equations of the lines A, B and C. I call b and c the dual coordinates of the 
line D. In order to distinguish them from point coordinates, I shall write D = [b, c]. The 
choice of the equation for each line must be unambiguous and therefore the normal vector 
in the implicit equations for A, B and C will be obtained by turning the direction vector 
over π/2 counterclockwise.  
 
Let us see some special cases. If the dual coordinate b is zero we have: 
 
 
D = ( 1 − c ) A + c C 
 
which is the equation of the pencil of lines passing through the intersection of the lines A 
and C, that is, the point P. Then P = [0, c] (for every c). Analogously, c = 0 determines the 
pencil of lines passing through the intersection of the lines A and B, which is the point Q, 
and then  Q = [b, 0] (for every b). The origin of coordinates is the intersection of the lines 
B and C and then O = [b, 1 − b] (for every b). Compare the dual coordinates of these 
points: 
 
O = [b, 1−b]   
P = [0, c] 
Q = [b, 0] 
 
∀ b, c 
 
with the point coordinates of the lines A, B and C:

RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
 
A = (p, 1− p)  
B = (0, q) 
C = (p, 0) 
 
∀ p, q 
 
Let us see an example: calculate the dual Cartesian coordinates of the line 2x + 3y 
+ 4 = 0. The points of the Cartesian base are O = (0, 0), P = (1, 0) and Q = (0, 1). Then the 
lines of the Cartesian base are A: −x − y +1= 0,  B: x = 0,  C: y = 0. We must solve the 
identity: 
 
 2 x + 3 y + 4 ≡ a' ( − x − y + 1) + b' x + c' y 
 
y

∀
 
 
x ( 2 + a' − b' ) + y ( 3 + a' − c' ) + 4 − a' ≡ 0 
 
whose solution is: 
 
 
a' = 4  
b' = 6  
c' = 7

from where the dual coordinates of this line are obtained as [b, c] = [6/17, 7/17]. Let us

Then 2 x + 3 y + 4 = 0 is the line of this pencil determined by a = 4/17. 
 
On the other hand, how may we know whether three lines are concurrent and 
belong to the same pencil or not? The answer is that the determinant of the dual 
coordinates must be zero: 
 
D = ( 1 − b − c ) A + b B + c C 
 
E = ( 1 − b' − c' ) A + b' B + c' C

When it happens, we will say that the lines are linearly dependent, and we can write 
anyone of them as linear combination of the others: 
 
 
F = ( 1 − k ) D + k E 
 
 
We can express a point with an equation for dual coordinates in the same manner 
as we express a line with an equation for point coordinates. For example, the point (5, 3) 
is the intersection of the lines x = 5,  y = 3 whose dual coordinates we calculate now:

From where a = b = 3/8, c = 2/8. The dual coordinates of y = 3 are [3/8, 2/8]. The linear 
combinations of both lines are the pencil of the point (5, 3), which is described by the 
parametric equation:

That is, the dual direction vector of the point (5, 3) is [5, −6] and the dual normal vector is 
[6, 5]. In the dual plane, an algebra of dual vectors can be defined. A dual direction vector 
for a point may be obtained as the difference between the dual coordinates of two lines 
whose intersection be the point. Then, there exist dual translations of lines:

W = {dual vectors} 
 
 
 
   (A, w) → B = A + w 
 
That is, we add a fixed dual vector w to the line A in order to obtain another line B. 
 
Let us prove the following theorem: all the points whose dual direction vectors are 
proportional are aligned with the centroid of the coordinate system .  
 
The proof begins from the dual continuous equation for a point P:

This equation means that P is the intersection point of the lines with dual coordinates [b0,

each line for the point coordinates p, q (x, y if Cartesian):

Now, if we consider a set of points with the same (or proportional) dual direction vector, 
the first equation changes but the second equation remains constant (or proportional). That 
is, the first line changes but the second line remains constant. Therefore all points will be 
aligned and lying on the second line:

However in which matter do two points differ whether having or not a proportional dual 
direction vector? We cannot say that two points are aligned, because we need three points 
at least. Let us search the third point X, rewriting the foregoing equality:

Now the variation of the components of the dual vector generates the pencil of the lines B

Then, two points have a proportional dual direction vector if they are aligned with the 
point X, intersection of the lines B − A and C − A. However, note that the addition of 
coefficients of each line is zero instead of one, so that one dual coordinate of each line is

I call X the point at the dual infinity or simply the dual infinity point. The dual infinity 
point has finite coordinates and a very well defined position. Then the points with 
proportional dual vector are always aligned with the dual infinity point, and I shall say 
that they are parallel points in a dual sense, of course. In order to precise which point is X 
let us take in mind that the lines B − A and C − A are the medians of the triangle OPQ (the 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA

point base). Hence the dual infinity point is the centroid of the base triangle OPQ. With 
Cartesian coordinates O = (0, 0), P = (1, 0), Q = (0, 1) and X = (1/3, 1/3). This ends the 
proof. 
 
Summarising, we can say that two parallel points are aligned with the dual infinity 
point, which is the dual statement of the fact that two parallel lines meet at the infinity, 
that is, there is a line at the infinity, in the usual sense. This is the novelty of the projective 
geometry in comparison with the Euclidean geometry. In fact, the problem arises because 
the point coordinates take infinite values, but the line L at the infinity is a well defined line 
with finite dual coordinates [1/3, 1/3]:

This means that the line L at the infinity belongs to the pencil of the lines (A + B ) /2 and C 
. But both lines are parallel because their direction vectors are proportional:

That is, the lines (A + B ) /2 and C meet at a point located at an infinite distance from the 
origin of coordinates. Since any other parallel line meets them also at the infinity, this 
argument does not suffice. However we can understand that the line L also belongs to the 
pencil of the lines A and (B + C ) /2, which are also parallel with another direction, that is, 
they meet at another point of the infinity. Any other pencil we take has always its point of 
intersection located at the infinity. Then L only has points located at the infinity and 
because of this it is called the line at the infinity. Summarising we can say that the line at 
the infinity is the centroid of the three base lines in spite of the incompatibility of its 
equation:

Given two triangles ABC and A'B'C', let P be the intersection of the prolongation 
of the side AB with the side A'B', Q the intersection of BC with B'C', and R the intersection 
of CA with C'A'. The points P, Q and R are aligned if and only if the lines AA', BB' and 
CC' meet at the same point. 
 
Proof ⇒ 
The hypothesis states that the lines AA', BB' and CC' intersect at the same 
point O (figure 5.12): 
 
 
O = a A + ( 1 − a ) A' 
 
 
 
O = b B + ( 1 − b ) B' 
 
 
 
O = c C + ( 1 − c ) C' 
 
 
with a, b and c being real. Equating 
the first and second equations we 
obtain: 
 
a A + ( 1 − a ) A' = b B + ( 1 − b ) B' 
 
which can be rearranged as: 
 
 
a A − b B = − ( 1 − a ) A' + ( 1 − b ) B' 
 
Dividing by a − b the sum of the coefficients becomes the unity, and then the equation 
represents the intersection of the lines AB and A'B', which is the point P:

We will prove the Desargues theorem in the other direction following the 
same algebraic way but applying the duality, that is, I shall only change the words. O, A, 
B, C, P, Q and R will be now lines (figure 5.13). 
 
The hypothesis states that the 
points AA', BB' and CC' belong to the 
same line O, that is, O belongs to the 
pencil of the lines A and A', but also 
to the pencil of the lines BB' and CC':

which can be rearranged as:

Dividing by a − b the sum of the coefficients becomes the unity, and then the equation

6. ANGLES AND ELEMENTAL TRIGONOMETRY 
 
 
Here, the basic identities of the elemental trigonometry are deduced in close 
connection with basic geometric facts, a very useful point of view for our pupils. 
 
          Sum of the angles of a polygon 
 
Firstly let us see the special case 
of a triangle. For any triangle ABC the 
following identity holds: 
 
    CA AB −1 AB BC −1 BC CA −1 = 1 
 
Let α, β and γ be the exterior angles 
between the sides CA and AB, AB and 
BC, BC and CA respectively (figure 6.1). 
Applying the definition of geometric 
quotient, the modulus of all the sides are 
simplified and only the exponentials of the arguments remain:

The three angles have the same orientation, which we suppose positive, and are 
lesser than π. Hence, since the exponential is equal to the unity, the addition of the three 
angles must be equal to 2π: 
 
π

+

γ
β
α
 
 
 
The interior angles, those formed by AB and AC, BC and CA, CA and CB are 
supplementary of α, β, γ (figure 6.1). Therefore the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal 
to π:

This result is generalised to any polygon from the following identity: 
 
 
AB BC −1 BC  ... YZ −1 YZ ZA−1 ZA AB −1 = 1 
 
 
Let α, β, γ ... ω be the exterior angles formed by the sides ZA and AB, AB and BC, 
BC and CD, ..., YZ and ZA, respectively. After the simplification of the modulus of all 
vectors, we have: 
 
 
(

Let us suppose that the orientation defined by the vertices A, B, C ... Z is 
counterclockwise, although the exterior angles be not necessarily all positive1. Translating

perimeter and summing one turn:

The interior angles formed by the sides AB and ZA, BC and BA, CD and CB,... ZA and ZY 
are supplementary of α, β, γ, ... ω. Therefore the sum of the angles of a polygon is:

n being the number of sides of the polygon. The deduction for the clockwise orientation of 
the polygon is analogous with the only difference that the result is negative.  
 
 
 
Definition of trigonometric functions and fundamental identities 
 
 
Let us consider a circle with radius r (figure 6.2). The extreme of the radius is a 
point on the circumference with coordinates (x, y). The arc between the positive X 
semiaxis and this point (x, y) has an oriented length s, positive if counterclockwise and 
otherwise negative. Also, the X-axis, 
the arc of circumference and the 
radius delimit a sector with an 
oriented area A. An oriented angle 
α  is defined as the quotient of the arc 
length divided by the radius2: 
 
r
s
=
α
 
 
Since the area of the sector is 
proportional to the arc length and the 
area of the circle is 2πr, it follows 
that: 
 
  
2
2r
A
α
=
    ⇔     
2
2
r
A
=
α
 
 
The trigonometric functions3, sine, cosine and tangent of the angle α, are respectively 
defined as the ratios: 
 
r
y
=
α 
sin
 
 
r
x
=
α
cos

and the cosecant, secant and cotangent as their inverse fractions: 
 
                                                 
2 With this definition it is said that the angle is given in radians, although an angle is a quotient of 
lengths and therefore a number without dimensions. 
3 Also called circular functions due to obvious reasons, to be distinguished from the hyperbolic 
functions.

being r related with x and y by the Pythagorean theorem: 
 
 
r2 = x2 + y2  
 
Then the radius vector v is: 
 
v = x e1 + y e2 = r ( cosα  e1 + sinα  e2 )  
 
From these definitions the fundamental identities follow:

If we take the opposite angle –α  instead of α, the sign of y is changed while x and r are

The sine and tangent are odd functions while the cosine is an even function. 
 
Look at the figure 6.2: β = π/2−α is the complementary angle of α . If α is higher 
than π/2, the angle β becomes negative. On the other hand, if the angle α is negative then 
β is higher than π/2. The trigonometric ratios for β give the complementary angle 
identities:

Angle inscribed in a circle and double angle identities 
 
 
Let us draw any diameter PQ and any 
radius OA (figure 6.3) in a circle with centre O. 
Since OP is also a radius, the triangle POA is 
isosceles and the angles OPA and PAO, which 
will be denoted as α, are equal. Because the 
addition of the three angles is equal to π,  the 
angle AOP is π − 2α . The angle QOA is 
supplementary of AOP, and therefore is equal to 
2α, the double of the angle APQ. Let us draw 
from A a segment perpendicular to the diameter 
and touching it at the point N. By the definition of 
sine we have:

The first quotient is sinα for the triangle PNA. If M is the midpoint of the segment

Finally, let us draw any other segment PB (figure 6.3). The angle BPQ will be 
denoted as β. By the same arguments as above the angle BOQ is 2β. While the angle BPA 
is α + β, the angle BOA is 2α +2β : an angle inscribed in a circumference is equal to the 
half of the central angle (angle whose vertex is the centre of the circumference)  which 
intercepts the same arc of circle. Consequently, all the angles inscribed in the same circle 
and intercepting the same arc are equal independently of the position of the vertex on the 
circle. 
 
 
 
Addition of vectors and sum of trigonometric functions 
 
 
Let us consider two unitary vectors forming the angles α and β with the e1 
direction (figure 6.4):

The addition of both vectors,  u + v , is the 
diagonal of the rhombus which they form, whence 
it follows that the long diagonal is the bisector of 
the angle α − β between both vectors. The short 
diagonal cuts the long diagonal perpendicularly 
forming four right triangles. Then the modulus of 
u + v is equal to the double of the cosine of the 
half of this angle:

7. SIMILARITIES AND SINGLE RATIO 
 
Two geometric figures are similar if they have the same shape. If the orientation of both 
figures is the same, they are said to be directly similar. For example, the dials of clocks are 
directly similar. On the other hand, two figures can have the same shape but different 
orientation. Then they are said to be oppositely similar. For example our hands are oppositely 
similar. However these intuitive concepts are insufficient and the similarity must be defined 
with more precision.  
  
 
 
Direct similarity (similitude) 
 
 
If two vectors u and v on the plane 
form the same angle as the angle between the 
vectors w and t, and they have proportional 
lengths 
(figure 
7.1), 
then 
they 
are 
geometrically proportional:

that is, the geometric quotient of u and v is equal to the quotient of w and t, which is a complex 
number. This definition of a geometric quotient is also valid for vectors in the space provided 
that the four vectors lie on the same plane. In this case, the geometric quotient is a quaternion, as 
Hamilton showed.  
 
The geometric proportionality for vectors allows to define the similarity of triangles. 
Two triangles ABC and A'B'C' are said to be directly similar and their vertices and sides denoted 
with the same letters are homologous if: 
 
 
AB BC −1 = A'B' B'C' −1 
 
that is, if the geometric quotient of two sides of the first triangle is equal to the quotient of the 
homologous sides of the second triangle. Arranging the vectors of this equation one obtains the 
equality of the quotients of the homologous sides: 
  
 
AB−1 A'B' = BC −1 B'C' 
 
 
One can prove easily that the third quotient of homologous sides also coincides with the 
other quotients: 
 
 
AB−1 A'B' = BC −1 B'C' = CA−1 C'A' = r 
 
 
The similarity ratio r is defined as the quotient of every pair of homologous sides, which 
is a complex constant. The modulus of the similarity ratio is the size ratio and the argument is 
the angle of rotation of the triangle A'B'C' with respect to the triangle ABC.

The 
definition 
of 
similarity 
is 
generalised to any pair of polygons in the 
following way. Let the polygons ABC...Z and 
A'B'C'...Z' be. They are said to be directly 
similar with similarity ratio r and the sides 
denoted with the same letters to be homologous 
if: 
 
r = AB −1 A'B' = BC −1 B'C' = CD −1 C'D' = ... = YZ −1 Y'Z' = ZA −1 Z'A' 
 
 
One of these equalities depends on the others and we do not need to know whether it is 
fulfilled. Here also, the modulus of r is the size ratio of both polygons and the argument is the 
angle of rotation. The fact that the homologous exterior and interior angles are equal for directly 
similar polygons (figure 7.2) is trivial because: 
 
 
B'A' B'C'  −1 = BA BC −1 
⇒ 
angle  A'B'C'  = angle  ABC 
 
C'B' C'D' −1 = CB CD −1 
⇒ 
angle  B'C'D' = angle  BCD 
   etc. 
 
 
The direct similarity is an equivalence relation since it has the reflexive, symmetric and 
transitive properties. This means that there are classes of equivalence with directly similar 
figures. 
 
A similitude with r=1 is called a displacement, since both polygons have the same 
size and orientation. 
 
 
 
Opposite similarity 
 
 
Two triangles ABC and A'B'C' are 
oppositely similar and the sides denoted with 
the same letters are homologous if: 
 
   AB BC −1 = ( A'B' B'C' −1 )* = B'C' −1 A'B' 
 
The former equality cannot be arranged in a 
quotient of a pair of homologous sides as we 
have made before. Because of this, the 
similarity ratio cannot be defined for the 
opposite similarity but only the size ratio, 
which is the quotient of the lengths of any two 
homologous sides. An opposite similarity is always the composition of a reflection in any line 
and a direct similarity. 
 
Figure 7.2 
Figure 7.3 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA

AB BC −1 = v −1 A'B' B'C' −1 v   ⇔ 
BC −1 v −1 B'C' = AB −1 v −1 A'B'   ⇔ 
 
 
BC −1 ( v −1 B'C' v ) = AB −1 ( v −1 A'B' −1 v ) = r 
 
where r is the ratio of a direct similarity whose argument is not defined but depends on the 
direction vector v of the reflection axis. Notwithstanding, this expression allows to define the 
opposite similarity of two polygons. So two polygons ABC...Z and A'B'C'...Z' are oppositely 
similar and the sides denoted with the same letters are homologous if for any vector v the 
following equalities are fulfilled: 
 
 
 AB −1 ( v −1 A'B'  −1 v ) =  BC  −1 ( v −1 B'C' v ) = .... =  ZA −1 ( v −1 Z'A' v )  
 
that is, if after a reflection one polygon is directly similar to the other. The opposite similarity is 
not reflexive nor transitive: if a figure is oppositely similar to another, and this is oppositely 
similar to a third figure, then the first and third figures are directly similar. Then there are not 
classes of oppositely similar figures. 
 
An opposite similarity with r=1 is called a reversal, since both polygons have the 
same size both opposite orientations. 
 
  
 
The theorem of Menelaus 
 
 
For every triangle ABC (figure 7.4), 
three points D, E and F lying respectively on 
the sides BC, CA and AB or their prolongations 
are aligned if and only if: 
 
 
 AF FB −1 BD DC −1 CE EA −1 = −1 
 
Proof ⇒ Let us suppose that D, E and F are 
aligned on a crossing straight line. Let us 
denote by p, q and r the vectors with origin at 
the vertices A, B and C and going 
perpendicularly to the crossing line. Then every pair of right angle triangles having the 
hypotenuses on a common side of the triangle ABC are similar so that we have:   
 
 
BF −1 AF = q −1 p 
 
CD −1 BD = r −1 q 
 
AE −1 CE = p −1 r 
 
Multiplying the three equalities one obtains: 
 
 
 AE −1 CE CD −1 BD BF −1 AF = 1 
 
Taking the complex conjugate expression and changing the sign of BF, CD and AE, the theorem 
is proved in this direction: 
 
 
AF FB −1 BD DC −1 CE EA −1 = −1 
 
Figure 7.4 

64 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
Proof ⇐  Being F a point on the line AB, D a point on the line BC and E a point on the line CA 
we have: 
 
 
F = a A + (1 − a) B 
 
D = b B + (1 − b) C 
 
E = c C + (1 − c) A 
 
with a, b and c real. Then: 
 
 
AF = (1 − a) AB 
 
FB = a AB 
 
BD = (1 − b) BC 
 
 
   DC = b BC

The theorem of Ceva 
 
 
Given a generic triangle ABC, we draw 
three segments AD, BE and CF from each vertex 
to a point of the opposite side (figure 7.5). The 
three segments meet in a unique point if and 
only if: 
 
 
BD DC −1 CE EA −1 AF FB −1 = 1 
 
 
In order to prove the theorem, we 
Figure 7 5

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
 65 
 
 
 
enlarge the segments BE and CF to touch the line which is parallel to the side BC and passes 
through A. Let us denote the intersection points by M and N respectively. Then the triangle BDO 
is directly similar to the triangle MAO, and the triangle CDO is also directly similar to the 
triangle NAO. Therefore:  
 
 
BD DO −1 = MA AO −1  
 
 
DO DC −1 = AO AN −1 
 
The multiplication of both equalities gives: 
 
 
BD DC −1 = MA AN −1 
 
 
Analogously, the triangles MEA and CEB are similar as soon as NFA and BFC. Hence: 
 
 
CE EA −1 = BC AM −1   
AF FB −1 = AN BC −1 
  
The product of the three equalities yields: 
 
 
BD DC −1 CE EA −1 AF FB −1 = MA AN −1 BC AM −1 AN BC −1 = 1 
 
The sufficiency of this condition is proved in the following way: let O be the point of 
intersection of BE and CF, and D' the point of intersection of the line AO with the side BC. Let 
us suppose that  the former equality is fulfilled. Then: 
 
 
BD' D'C −1 = BD DC −1 
 
Since both D and D' lie on the line BC, it follows that D = D'. 
 
 
 
Homothety and single ratio 
 
 
A homothety with centre O and ratio k is the geometric transformation which dilates the 
distance from O to any point A in a factor k: 
 
 
OA' = OA k 
 
 
O is the unique invariant point of the 
homothety. If k is real number, the homothety is 
said to be simple (figure 7.6), otherwise is called 
composite. If k is a complex number, it may always 
be factorised in a product of the modulus and a 
unitary complex number: 
 
k = k z 
 with z = 1 
 
 
The modulus of k is the ratio of a simple homothety with centre O, and z indicates an 
Figure 7.6 

66 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
additional rotation with the same centre. Then, a composite homothety is equivalent to a simple 
homothety followed by a rotation. Direct similarities and homotheties are different names for 
the same transformations (exercise 7.5). Also homotheties with k=1 and displacements are 
equivalent. 
 
The single ratio of three points A, B, and C is defined as: 
 
 
( A  B  C ) = AB AC −1 
 
 
The single ratio is a real number when the three points are aligned, and a complex 
number in the other case. Under a homothety, the single ratio of any three points remains 
invariant. Let us prove this. Because any vector is dilated and rotated by a factor k, we have: 
 
 
A'B' = OB' − OA' = OB k − OA k =  AB k 
 
 
A'C' = AC  k 
     ⇒     A'C'  −1 = k −1 AC −1 
 
 
( A'  B'  C' ) = AB k k −1 AC −1 = AB AC −1 = ( A  B  C ) 
 
If the single ratio is invariant for a geometric transformation, then it transforms triangles 
into directly similar triangles and hence also polygons into similar polygons: 
 
( A  B  C ) = ( A'  B'  C' ) 
⇒    AB AC  −1 = A'B' A'C'  −1    ⇒  AC  −1 A'C' = AB −1 A'B' 
 
 
Therefore, the homothety always transforms triangles into directly similar triangles as 
shown in the figure 7.6. It follows immediately that the homothety preserves the angles between 
lines. It is the simplest case of conformal transformations, the geometric transformations which 
preserve the angles between lines. Since a line 
may also be transformed into a curve, and for 
the general case a curve into a curve, the 
conformal transformations are those which 
preserve the angle between any pair of curves, 
that is, the angle between the tangent lines to 
both curves at the intersection point. A 
transformation 
is 
directly 
or 
oppositely 
conformal whether it preserves or changes the 
sense of the angle between two curves (figure 
7.7). This condition is equivalent to the 
conservation of the single ratio of any three 
points at the limit of  accumulation:

8. PROPERTIES OF TRIANGLES 
 
 
Area of a triangle 
 
 
Since the area of a parallelogram is obtained as the outer product of two 
consecutive sides (taken as vectors, of course), the area of a triangle is the half of the outer 
product of any two of its three sides: 
 
 
aPQR = 2
1 PQ ∧ PR = 2
1 QR ∧ QP = 2
1 RP ∧ RQ  
 
 
If the vertices P, Q and R are counterclockwise oriented, the area is a positive 
imaginary number. Otherwise, the area is a 
negative imaginary number. Note that the 
fundamental concept in geometry is the 
oriented area1. The modulus of the area 
may be useful in the current life but is 
insufficient for geometry. From now on I 
shall only regard oriented areas.  
Writing the segments of the former 
equation as differences of points we arrive 
to: 
 
aPQR = 2
1 (P ∧ Q + Q ∧ R + R ∧ P ) 
 
which is a symmetric expression under cyclic permutation of the vertices. The position 
vector P goes from an arbitrary origin of coordinates to the point P. Then, P ∧ Q is the 
double of the area of the triangle OPQ. Analogously Q ∧ R is the double of the area of the 
triangle OQR and R ∧ P is the double of the area of the triangle ORP. Therefore the 
former expression is equal to (figure 8.1): 
 
aPQR = aOPQ  + aOQR  + aORP 
 
 
For the arrangement of points shown in the figure 8.1 the area of OPQ is positive, 
and the areas of OQR and ORP are negative, that is, the areas of ORQ and OPR are 
positive. Therefore, one would intuitively write, taking all the areas positive, that: 
 
 
aPQR = aOPQ  −  aORQ  −  aOPR  
 
 
When one considers oriented areas, the equalities are wholly general and 
independent of the arrangement of the points2.  
 
 
                                                 
1 The integral of a function is also the oriented area of the region enclosed by the curve and the X-
axis.   
2 About this topic, see A. M. Lopshitz, Cálculo de las áreas de figuras orientadas, Rubiños-1860 
(1994).

Medians and centroid 
 
 
The medians are the segments going from each vertex to the midpoint of the 
opposite side. Let us prove that the three medians meet in a unique point G called the 
centroid (figure 8.2). Since G is a point on the median passing through P and (Q + R)/2:

called the circumcentre, the centre of the circumscribed circle. Every point on the 
perpendicular bisector of PQ is equidistant from P and Q. Analogously every point on the 
perpendicular bisector of PR is equidistant from P and R. The intersection O of both 
perpendicular bisectors is simultaneously equidistant from P, Q and R. Therefore O also 
belongs to the perpendicular bisector of QR and the three bisectors meet at a unique point. 
Since O is equally distant from the three vertices, it is the centre of the circumscribed 
circle. Let us use this condition in order to 
calculate the equation of the circumcentre: 
 
 
OP2 = OQ2 = OR2 = d2 
 
where d is the radius of the circumscribed 
circle. Using the position vectors of each 
point we have: 
 
 
(P − O)2 = (Q − O)2 = (R − O)2 
 
The first equality yields: 
 
       P2 − 2 P · O + O2 = Q2 − 2 Q · O + O2 
 
By simplifying and arranging the terms containing O at the left hand side, we have: 
  
 
2 ( Q − P ) · O = Q2 − P2 
 
 
2 PQ · O = Q2 − P2  
 
From the second equality we find an analogous result: 
 
 
2 QR · O = R2 − Q2 
 
Now we introduce the geometric product instead of the inner product in these equations: 
  
 
PQ  O + O PQ = Q2 − P2 
 
 
QR O + O QR = R2 − Q2 
 
 
By subtraction of the second equation multiplied on the right by PQ minus the first 
equation multiplied on the left by QR, we obtain:  
 
 
PQ  QR  O − O PQ  QR = PQ  R2 − PQ  Q2 − Q2  QR + P2  QR 
 
By using the permutative property on the left hand side and simplifying the right hand 
side, we have:

PQ QR O − QR PQ O = P2 QR + Q2 RP + R2 PQ 
 
 
2 ( PQ ∧ QR ) O = P2 QR + Q2 RP  + R2 PQ 
 
Finally, the multiplication by the inverse of the outer product on the left gives: 
  
 
O = ( 2 PQ ∧ QR ) −1 ( P2 QR + Q2 RP + R2 PQ ) 
 
 
   = − ( P2 QR + Q2 RP + R2 PQ ) ( 2 PQ ∧ QR ) −1 
 
a formula able to calculate the coordinates of the circumcentre. For example, let us 
calculate the centre of the circle passing through the points: 
 
 
P = ( 2, 2 ) 
Q = ( 3, 1 ) 
R = ( 4, −2 ) 
 
 
P2 = 8  
Q2 = 10 
R2 = 20 
 
 
QR = R − Q = e1 − 3 e2       RP = P − R = − 2 e1 + 4 e2         PQ = Q − P = e1 − e2 
 
 
2 PQ ∧ QR = − 4 e12 
 
 
O = − ( 8 ( e1 − 3 e2 ) + 10 ( −2 e1 + 4 e2  ) + 20 ( e1 − e2 ) ) 4
12
e
 
 
    = − e1 − 2 e2 = ( −1, −2 ) 
 
 
In order to deduce the radius of the circle, we take the vector OP: 
 
 
OP = P − O = P + ( P2 QR + Q2 RP + R2 PQ ) ( 2 PQ ∧ QR ) −1 
 
and extract the inverse of the area as a common factor: 
  
OP = ( 2 P  PQ ∧ QR + P2 QR + Q2 RP  + R2 PQ ) ( 2 PQ ∧ QR ) −1 = 
 
    = [ 2 P ( P ∧ Q + Q ∧ R + R ∧ P ) + P2 QR + Q2 RP + R2 PQ ] ( 2 PQ ∧ QR ) −1 = 
 
    = [ P ( P Q − Q P + Q R − R Q + R P − P R ) + P2 ( R − Q ) + Q2 ( P − R ) + 
 
 
 
 
+ R2 ( Q − P ) ]  ( 2 PQ ∧ QR ) −1  
 
The simplification gives: 
 
OP = ( P Q R − P R Q + P R P − P Q P + Q2 P − Q2 R + R2 Q − R2 P ) ( 2 PQ ∧ QR ) −1 
 
 
= − (Q − P) (R − Q) (P − R) ( 2 PQ ∧ QR ) −1 = − PQ  QR  RP ( 2 PQ ∧ QR ) −1

Angle bisectors and incentre 
 
 
The three bisector lines of the angles of a 
triangle meet in a unique point called the incentre. 
Every point on the bisector of the angle with 
vertex P is equidistant from the sides PQ and PR 
(figure 8.4). Also every point on the angle 
bisector of Q is equidistant from the sides QR and 
QP. Hence its intersection I is simultaneously 
equidistant from the three sides, that is, I is unique 
and is the centre of the circle inscribed into the 
triangle. 
 
In order to calculate the equation of the 
angle bisector passing through P, we take the sum 
of the unitary vectors of both adjacent sides:

The incentre I is the intersection of the angle bisector passing through P, whose 
direction vector is u, and that passing through Q, with direction vector v: 
 
 
I = P + k u = Q + m v  
k, m real 
 
Arranging terms we find PQ as a linear combination of u and v: 
 
 
k u − m v = Q − P = PQ 
 
The coefficient k is:

Altitudes and orthocentre  
 
 
The altitude of a side is the segment perpendicular to this side (also called base) 
which passes through the opposite vertex. The three altitudes of a triangle intersect on a 
unique point called the orthocentre. Let us prove this statement calculating the 

74 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
intersection H of two altitudes. Since H belongs to the altitude passing through the vertex 
P and perpendicular to the base QR (figure 8.5), its equation is: 
 
H = P + z QR  
z imaginary 
 
because the product by an imaginary 
number turns the vector QR over π/2, that 
is, z PQ has the direction of the altitude. H 
also belongs to the altitude passing through 
Q and perpendicular to the base RP. Then 
its equation is: 
 
 
H = Q + t RP  
t   imaginary 
 
By equating both expressions: 
 
 
P + z QR = Q + t RP 
 
we arrive at a vector written as a linear combination of two vectors but with imaginary 
coefficients: 
 
 
z QR − t RP = PQ 
 
In this equation we must resolve PQ into components with directions perpendicular to the 
vectors QR and RP. The algebraic resolution follows the same way as for the case of real 
linear combination. Let us multiply on the right by RP: 
 
 
z QR RP − t RP2 = PQ RP 
 
and on the left: 
 
 
RP z QR − RP t RP = RP PQ 
 
 
The imaginary numbers anticommute with vectors: 
 
 
− z RP QR + t RP2 = RP PQ 
 
 
By adding both equalities we arrive at: 
 
 
z ( QR RP − RP QR ) = PQ RP + RP PQ

Both expressions differ from the coefficients of real linear combination in the fact 
that the numerator is an inner product. The substitution in any of the first equations gives: 
 
 
H = P + z QR = P + ( PQ RP + RP PQ ) ( QR RP − RP QR ) −1 QR = 
 
The vector QR anticommutes with the outer product, an imaginary number: 
 
 
H = P − ( PQ RP + RP PQ ) QR ( QR RP − RP QR ) −1 = 
 
Extracting the area as common factor, we obtain: 
 
 
H = [ P ( QR RP − RP QR ) − ( PQ RP + RP PQ ) QR ] ( QR RP − RP QR ) −1  
 
By using the fact that PQ = Q − P, etc., we arrive at: 
 
     H = ( P QR RP − Q RP QR − P PQ QR + R PQ QR ) ( QR RP − RP QR ) −1  
 
        = ( P2 QR + Q2 RP + R2 PQ + P QR P + Q RP Q + R PQ R ) ( QR RP − RP QR ) −1 
    
        = ( P  P · QR + Q  Q · RP + R  R · PQ ) ( QR ∧ RP ) −1   
 
This formula is invariant under cyclic permutation of the vertices. Therefore all the 
altitudes intersect on a unique point, 
the orthocentre. 
 
The equation of the orthocentre 
resembles that of the circumcentre. In 
order to see the relationship between 
both, let us draw a line passing through 
P and parallel to the opposite side QR, 
another one passing through Q and 
parallel to RP, and a third line passing 
through R and parallel to PQ (figure 
8.6). Let A be the intersection of the 
line passing through Q and that passing 
through R, B be the intersection of the 
lines passing through R and P respectively, and C be the intersection of the lines passing 
through P and Q respectively. The triangle ABC is directly similar to the triangle PQR 
with ratio −2:

Therefore the altitudes of the triangle PQR are the perpendicular bisectors of the

ABC. In order to prove with algebra this obvious geometric fact, we must only deduce 
from the former relations the following equalities and substitute them into the orthocentre

This is just the equation of the circumcentre of the triangle ABC. 
 
 
 
Euler's line 
 
 
The centroid G, the circumcentre O and the orthocentre H of a triangle are always 
aligned on the Euler's line. To prove this fact, observe that the circumcentre and 
orthocentre equations have the triangle area as a "denominator", while the centroid 
equation does not, but we can introduce it:

from where the relation between the three points G, H and O follows immediately:

Hence the centroid is located between the orthocentre and the circumcentre, and its 
distance from the orthocentre is double of its distance from the circumcentre. 
 
 
 
 
The Fermat's theorem 
 
 
The geometric algebra allows to prove through a very easy and intuitive way the 
Fermat's theorem. 
Over every side of a triangle ABC we draw an equilateral triangle (figure 8.7). Let 
T, U and S be the vertices of the 
equilateral 
triangles 
respectively 
opposite to A, B and C. Then the 
segments AT, BU and CS have the same 
length, form angles of 2π/3 and intersect 
on a unique point F, called the Fermat's 
point. Moreover, the addition of the 
three distances from any point P to each 
vertex is minimal when P is the Fermat's 
point, provided that any of the interior 
angles of the triangle ABC be higher 
than 2π/3. 
 
Firstly, we must demonstrate that 
BU is obtained from AT by means of a rotation of  2π/3, which will be represented by the 
complex number t:

sin

π

cos

t
+
=
 
 
 
AT t = (AC + CT ) t = AC t + CT t  
 
By construction, the vector AC turned over 2π/3 is the vector CU, and CT turned over 
2π/3 is BC, so: 
 
 
AT t = CU + BC = BU 
 
Analogously, one finds CB = BU t  and  AT = CS t . That is, the vectors CS, BU and AT 
have the same length and each one is obtained from each other by successive rotations of 
2π/3. 
 
Let us see that the sum of the distances from P to the three vertices A, B and C is 
minimal when P is the Fermat’s point. We must prove firstly that the vectorial sum of PA 
turned 4π/3, PB turned 2π/3 and PC is constant independently of the point P. (figure 8.8). 
That is, for any two points P and P’ it is always true that: 
 
Figure 8.7 

78 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
 
PA t2 + PB t + PC = P'A t2 + P'B t + P'C 
 
fact which is proved by arranging all the terms in one side of the equation: 
  
 
PP' ( t2 + t + 1 ) = 0 
 
This product is always zero since  t2 + t + 1 = 0. Hence, there is a unique point Q such 
that: 
 
 
PA t2 + PB t + PC = QC 
 
For any point P, the three segments form a 
broken line as that shown in figure 8.8. 
Therefore, by the triangular inequality we 
have: 
 
PA + PB + PC ≥ QC 
 
When P is the Fermat’s point F, these 
segments form a straight line. Then, the 
addition of the distances from F to the three 
vertices is minimal provided that no angle of 
the triangle be higher than 2π/3: 
 
 
FA + FB + FC = QC ≤ PA + PB + PC 
 
In the other case, someone of the vectors FA t2, FB t  or  FC has a sense opposite to the 
others, so that its length is subtracted from the others and their sum is not minimal.

9. CIRCLES 
 
 
Algebraic and Cartesian equations 
 
 
A circle with radius r and centre F is the locus of the points located at a distance r 
from F, so its equation is: 
 
d(F, P) =FP= r 
⇔ 
FP2 = r2 
 
which can be written as: 
 
(P − F)2 = r2 
⇒ 
P2 − 2 P · F + F2 − r2 = 0 
 
By introducing the coordinates of P = (x, y) and F = (a, b) one obtains the analytic 
equation of the circle: 
 
x2 + y2 − 2 a x − 2 b y + a2 + b2 − r2 = 0 
 
For example, the circle whose equation is: 
 
 
x2 + y2 + 4 x − 6 y + 9 = 0 
 
has the centre F = (−2, 3) and radius 2. 
 
There always exists a unique circle passing through any three non aligned points. 
In order to obtain this circle, one may substitute the coordinates of the points on the 
Cartesian equation of the circle, arriving at a system of three linear equations of three 
unknown quantities a, b and c:

This is the classic way to find the equation of the circle, and from here the centre of the 
circle. 
 
However, a more direct way is the calculation of the circumcentre of the triangle 
whose vertices are the three given points (see the previous chapter). Then the radius is the 
distance from the centre to any vertex. 
 
 
 
Intersections of a line with a circle 
 
 
The coordinates of the intersection of a line with a circle are usually calculated by 
substitution of the line equation into the circle equation, which leads to a second degree 
equation. Let us now follow an algebraic way. Let F be the centre of the circle with radius 
r, and R and R’ the intersections of the line passing through two given points P and Q 
(figure 9.1):

From the first equality we obtain: 
 
(R − F )2 = R2 − 2 R · F + F2 = r2 
 
The substitution of R given by the second 
equality yields: 
 
( P + k PQ )2 − 2 ( P + k PQ ) · F + F2 = r2 
 
P2 + 2 k P · PQ + k2 PQ2 − 2 P · F − 2 k PQ · F + F2 − r2 = 0 
 
By arranging the powers of k one obtains: 
 
 
k2 PQ2 + 2 k ( P · PQ  − F · PQ ) + P2 − 2 F · P + F2 − r2 = 0 
 
Taking into account that PF = F − P one finds: 
 
 
k2 PQ2 − 2 k PF · PQ + PF2 − r2 = 0 
 
This equation has solution whenever the discriminant be positive: 
 
 
4 ( PF · PQ )2 − 4 PQ2 ( PF2 − r2 ) ≥ 0 
 
Introducing the identity (PF · PQ )2 − (PF ∧ PQ )2  = PQ2 PF2 the discriminant becomes: 
 
 
 
4 (PF ∧ PQ )2 + 4 PQ2 r2 ≥ 0

Power of a point with respect to a circle 
 
 
Both intersection points R and R' have the following property: the product of the 
vectors going from a given point P to the intersections R and R' of any line passing 
through P with a given circle is constant: 
 
PR PR' = ( PF · u )2  −  r2 − (PF ∧ u )2   
 
= PF2 − r2 = PT2 
  
where T is the contact point of the tangent 
line passing through P (figure 9.2). The 
product PR PR’, which is independent of 
the direction u of the line and only 
depends on the point P, is called the 
power of the point P with respect to the 
given circle. The power of a point may be 
calculated through the substitution of its coordinates into the circle equation. If its centre 
is F = (a, b) and P = (x, y), then: 
 
FP2 − r2 = ( x − a )2 + ( y − b )2 − r2 = x2 + y2 − 2 a x − 2 b y + a2 + b2 − r2   
 
The power is equal to zero when P belongs to the circle, positive when P lies outside the 
circle, and negative when P lies inside the circle. 
 
 
 
Polar equation 
 
 
We wish to describe the distance 
from a point P to the points R and R' on the 
circle as a function of the angle α between 
the line PR and the diameter (figure 9.3). 
The vectors PR and PR' are:

Inversion with respect to a circle 
 
 
The point P' is the inverse point of P 
with respect to a circle of centre F and radius r if the vector FP’ is the inverse vector of 
FP with radius k: 
  
 
FP' = k2 FP −1  
⇔ 
 
FP  FP' = k2 
 
 
Obviously, the product of the 
vectors FP and FP' is only real and 
positive when the points P and P’ are 
aligned with the centre F and are located 
at the same side of F. The circle of centre 
F and radius k is called the inversion 
circle because its points remain invariant 
under this inversion. The inversion 
transforms points located inside the 
inversion circle into outside points and 
reciprocally. 
To 
obtain 
geometrically 
the 
inverse of an inside point P, draw firstly 
(figure 9.5) the diameter passing through P; after this draw the perpendicular to this 
diameter from P which will cut the circle in the point T; finally draw the tangent with 
contact point T. The intersection P' of this tangent with the prolongation of the diameter is 
the inverse point of P. Note that the right triangles FPT and FTP' are oppositely similar: 
 
FP FT −1 = FP' −1 FT   ⇒    FP' FP = FT2 = k2 
 
 
To obtain the inverse of an outside point, make the same construction but in the 
opposite sense. Draw the tangent to the circle passing through the point (P' in the figure 
9.5) and then draw the perpendicular to the diameter FP' passing through the contact point 
T of the tangent. The intersection P of the perpendicular with the diameter is the searched 
inverse point of P'. 
Every line not containing the centre of inversion is transformed into a circle 
passing through the centre (figure 9.6) and reciprocally. To prove this statement let us take 
Figure 9.4

which is the polar equation of a circle passing

the line; therefore, the centre O of the circle is located on FD. 
 
Let us prove that an inversion transforms a circle not passing through its centre 
into another circle also not passing through its centre. Consider a circle of centre F and 
radius r which will be transformed under an inversion of centre P and radius k. Then any 
point R on the circle is mapped into another point S according to:

PF2 − r2 = PT2 is the power of the point P with respect to the circle of centre F. 
Then we see that the distance from the centre of inversion to the centre of the circle and 
the radius of this circle changes in the ratio of the square of the radius of inversion divided 
by the power of the centre of inversion with respect to the given circle.

its transformed is constant and equal to the fourth power of the radius of inversion:

In the equation of the transformed circle the symbol m  appears instead of ± . It 
means that the sense of the arc from R to R' is opposite to the sense of the arc from S to S'. 
 
 
 
The nine-point circle 
 
The Euler’s theorem states that the midpoints of the sides of any triangle, the feet 
of the altitudes and the midpoints from each vertex to the orthocentre lie on a circle called 
the nine-point circle. 
Let any triangle PQR whose orthocentre is H be. Now we evaluate the expression:

Cyclic and circumscribed quadrilaterals 
 
 
First, let us see a statement valid for every quadrilateral: the area of a quadrilateral 
ABCD is the outer product of the diagonals AC and BD. The prove is written in one line. 
Since we can divide the quadrilateral in two triangles we have: 
 
Area = 2
1 AB ∧ BC + 2
1 AC ∧ CD 
= 2
1 (AC ∧ BC + AC ∧ CD ) 
= 2
1 AC ∧ BD 
= 2
1
ACBDsin(AC, BD) e12 
 
 
The quadrilaterals inscribed in a circle are called cyclic quadrilaterals. They fulfil 
the Ptolemy’s theorem: the product of the lengths of both diagonals is equal to the 
addition of the products of the lengths of opposite sides (figure 9.9): 
 
DA
BC
CD
AB
BD
AC
+
=
 
 
A beautiful demonstration makes use of the cross ratio and it is proposed in the first 
exercise of the next chapter. 
 
For the cyclic quadrilaterals, the sum of opposite angles is equal to π, because they 
are inscribed in the circle and intercept opposite arcs. Another interesting property is the 
Brahmagupta formula for the area. If the lengths of the sides are denoted by a, b, c and d 
and the semiperimeter by s then:

Another type of quadrilaterals are those 
where a circle can be inscribed, also called 
circumscribed 
quadrilaterals. 
For 
these 
quadrilaterals the bisectors of all the angles 
meet in the centre I of the inscribed circle, 
because it is equidistant from all the sides. 
When tracing the radii going to the tangency 
points, the quadrilateral is divided into pairs of 
opposite triangles (figure 9.10), and hence one 
deduces that the sums of the lengths of 
opposite sides are equal: 
 
 
AB+CD= x + y + z + t = y + z + t + x =BC+DA 
 
If a quadrilateral has inscribed and circumscribed circle, then we may substitute this 
condition (a + c = b + d) in the Brahmagupta formula to find: 
 
 
DA

Area
 
 
Since the sum of the angles of any quadrilateral is 2π and either of the four small 
quadrilaterals of a circumscribed quadrilateral has two right angles (figure 9.10), it 
follows that the central angles are supplementary of the vertices:

If the quadrilateral is also cyclic then the angles CBA and ADC are inscribed and intercept 
opposite arcs of the outer circle, so that the segments joining opposite tangency points are 
orthogonal:

Angle between circles 
 
 
 
Let us calculate the angle between a circle centred at O with radius r and another 
one centred at O' with radius r'. If O' − O< r + r' then they intersect. The points of 
intersection P must fulfil the equations for both circles:

The radical centre of three circles is the intersection of their radical axis. Let O, O'

the intersections of the radical axis of the first and second circles with the line OO', and 
with Y the intersection of the radical axis of the second and third circles with the line

10. CROSS RATIOS AND RELATED TRANSFORMATIONS 
 
 
Complex cross ratio 
 
 
The complex cross ratio of any four points A, B, C and D on the plane is defined 
as the quotient of the following two single ratios: 
 
( A B C D ) = ( A C D ) ( B C D ) −1 = AC AD −1 BD BC −1 
 
 
If the four points are aligned, then the cross ratio is a real number, otherwise it is a 
complex number. Denoting the angles CAD and CBD as α and β respectively, the cross 
ratio is written as:

If the four points are located in this order 
on a circle (figure 10.1), the cross ratio is a 
positive real number, because the inscribed angles 
α and β intercept the same arc CD and hence are 
equal, so:

But if one of the points C or D is located between A and B (figure 10.2), then α and β  
have distinct arcs CD with opposite orientation. Since α and β are the half of these arcs, it 
follows that α −β = π and the cross ratio is a 
negative real number:

(
 
 
 
Analogously, if the four points are aligned 
and C or D is located between A and B, the cross 
ratio is negative1. 
 
Other definitions of the cross ratio differ 
from this one given here only in the order in 
which the vectors are taken. This question is 
equivalent to study how the value of the cross ratio changes under permutations of the 
points. For four points, there are 24 possible permutations, but only six different values for 
the cross ratio. The calculations are somewhat laborious and I shall only show one case.

The reader may prove any other case as an exercise. I also indicate whether the 
permutations are even or odd, that is, whether they are obtained by an even or an odd 
number of exchanges of any two points from the initial definition ( A B C D ):

( A B C D ) = ( B A D C ) = ( C D A B ) = ( D C B A ) = r

Let us prove, for example the equalities (3): 
 
(3)     ( A C B D ) = AB AD −1 CD CB −1 = ( AC + CB ) AD −1 ( CB + BD ) CB −1 = 
 
 = AC AD −1 CB CB −1 + AC AD −1 BD CB −1 + CB AD −1 CB CB −1 + CB AD −1 BD CB −1  
 
In the last term, under the reflection in the direction CB, the complex number AD −1 BD 
becomes conjugate, that is, these vectors are exchanged: 
 
  
= AC AD −1 + AC AD −1 BD CB −1 + CB AD −1 + BD AD −1 
 
 
= ( AC + CB + BD ) AD −1 − AC AD −1 BD BC −1 = AD AD −1 − r = 1 − r 
 
Let us see that this value is the same for all the cross ratios of the case (3): 
 
( B D A C ) = BA BC −1 DC DA −1 = AB CB −1 CD AD −1 = AB AD −1 CD CB −1 
 
           = ( A C B D ) 
 
where in the third step the permutative property has been applied. Also by using this 
property one obtains: 
 
( C A D B ) = CD CB −1 AB AD −1 = CD AD −1 AB CB −1 = AB AD −1 CD CB −1 
 
       = ( A C B D ) 
 
( D B C A ) = DC DA −1 BA BC −1 = BA DA −1 DC BC −1 = AB AD −1 CD CB −1  
 
       = ( A C B D )

Harmonic characteristic and ranges 
 
 
From the cross ratio, one can find a quantity independent of the symbols of the 
points and only dependent on their locations. I call this quantity the harmonic 
characteristic -because of the obvious reasons that follow now- denoting it as [A B C D]. 
The simplest way to calculate it (but not the unique) is through the alternated addition of 
all the permutations of the cross ratio, condensed in the alternated sum of the six different 
values:  
 
( A B C D ) − ( B A C D ) − ( A C B D ) + ( C A B D ) + ( B C A D ) − ( C B A D ) =

When two points are permuted, this sum still changes the sign. The square of this 
sum is invariant under every permutation of the points, and is the suitable definition of the 
harmonic characteristic:

The first notable property of the harmonic characteristic is the fact that it vanishes for a 
harmonic range of points, that is, when the cross ratio (A B C D) takes the values 1/2, −1 
or –2 dependent on the denominations of the points. The second notable property is the 
fact that the harmonic characteristic of a degenerate range of points (two or more 
coincident points) is infinite.  
 
Perhaps, the reader believes that other harmonic characteristics may be obtained in 
many other ways, that is, by using other combinations of the permutations of the cross 
ratio. However, other attempts lead whether to the same function of r (or a linear 
dependence) or to constant values. For example, we can take the sum of all the squares, 
which is also invariant under any permutation of the points to find: 
 
     (A B C D) 2 + (B A C D)2 + (A C B D)2 + (C A B D)2 + (B C A D)2 + (C B A D)2

Other useless possibilities are the sum of all the values of the permutations of the cross 
ratio, which is identical to zero, or their product giving always a unity result.  
Four points A, B, C and D so ordered on a line are said to be a harmonic range if 
the segments AB, AC and AD are in harmonic progression, that is, the inverse vectors 
AB−1, AC −1 and AD −1 are in arithmetic progression: 
 
AB −1 − AC −1 = AC −1 − AD −1  
⇔ 
AC AD −1 BD BC −1 = 2 
 
The cross ratio of a harmonic range is 2, but if this order is altered then it can be –1 or 1/2. 
Note that this definition also includes harmonic ranges of points on a circle. On the other 
hand, all the points of a harmonic range always lie on a line or a circle. 
 
In order to construct the fourth point D  forming a harmonic range with any three 
given points A, B and C (ordered in this way on a line) one must follow these steps (figure 
10.3):  
1) Draw the line passing through A, B and C. Trace two any distinct lines R and S also 
different from ABC and passing through A. 
2) Draw any line passing through B. This 
line will cut the line R in the point P and the 
line S in the point X. 
 3) Draw the line passing through C and X. 
The intersection of this line with R will be 
denoted by Q. Draw also the line passing 
through C and P. This line intersects the 
line S in the point Y. 
4) Now trace the line passing through Y and 
Q, which will cut the line ABC in the 
searched point D, which completes the 
harmonic range. 
For a clearer displaying I have 
drawn some segments instead of lines, although the construction is completely general 
only for lines. 
 
If A, B and C are not aligned, the point D which completes the harmonic range lies 
on a circle passing through the three given points (figure 10.4). In order to determine D 
one must make an inversion (which preserves the cross ratio if this is real, as shown 
below) with centre on the circle ABC, which transforms this circle into a line. In this line 
we determine the point D’ forming  a harmonic range with A’, B’, C’ and then, by means 
of the same inversion, the point D is obtained. In the drawing method the radius and the 
exact position of the centre of inversion do not play any role whenever it lie on the circle 
ABC. Then we shall draw any line outside the circle, project A, B and C into this line, 
make the former construction and obtain D by projecting D’ upon the circle. 
 
The cross ratio becomes conjugated under circular inversion. In order to prove this 
statement, let us see firstly how the single ratio is transformed. If A', B', C' and D' are the 
transformed points of A, B, C and D under an inversion with centre O and any radius, we 
Figure 10.3

have: 
 
 
A'C' A'D' −1 = (OC' − OA' ) (OD' − OA' ) −1 = (OC −1 − OA −1) (OD −1 − OA −1) −1  
 
 
 
= OC −1 ( OA − OC ) OA −1 [ OD −1 ( OA − OD ) OA −1 ] −1  
 
 
 
= OC −1 CA OA −1 [ OD −1 DA OA −1 ] −1 = OC −1 CA OA −1 OA DA −1 OD  
 
 
 
= OC −1 AC AD −1 OD 
 
Analogously we have: 
 
B'D' B'C' −1 = OD −1 BD BC −1 OC 
 
The product of both expressions is the cross 
ratio: 
 
( A' B' C' D' ) = A'C' A'D' −1 B'D' B'C' −1  
 
= OC −1 AC AD −1 BD BC −1 OC 
 
 
= OC −1 ( A B C D ) OC = ( A B C D )* 
 
So, the cross ratio of four points on a line or a circle, which is real, is preserved, otherwise 
it becomes conjugated. 
 
Finally let us see that the single ratio is the limit of the cross ratio for one point at 
infinity:

The homography (Möbius transformation) 
 
 
The homography is defined as the geometric transformation that preserves the 
complex cross ratio of four points on the plane. In order to specify a homography one 
must gives only the images A', B' and C' of three points A, B, and C  because the fourth 
image D' is determined by the conservation of their cross ratio: 
 
 
( A' B' C' D' ) = ( A B C D ) 
 
 
A'C' A'D' −1 B'D' B'C' −1 = AC AD −1 BD BC −1 
 
Arranging vectors we write: 
 
  
A'D' −1 B'D' = A'C' −1 AC AD −1 BD BC −1 B'C' = A'C' −1 AC  BC −1 B'C' AD −1 BD 
 
After conjugation we find: 
Figure 10.4 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
97  
 
 
 
 
 
B'D' A'D' −1 = BD AD −1 B'C' BC −1 AC A'C' −1 
 
 
B'D' A'D' −1 = BD AD −1 z 
 
where     z = BC −1 B'C' A'C' −1 AC  
 
 
D'B' D'A' −1 = DB DA −1 z 
⇒ 
( D' B' A' ) = ( D B A ) z 
 
Hence the homography multiplies the single ratio by a complex number z. The modulus of 
the single ratio increases proportionally to the modulus of z and the angle BDA is 
increased in the argument of z: 
 
 
z = z exp[α e12 ] 
 
 
DA
DB
z
D'A'
D'B' =
 
 
 
angle B'D'A' = angle BDA + α 
 
Then a homography can also be determined by specifying the images A' and B' of two 
points A and B, and a complex number z. The image D' of D is calculated by isolation in 
the former equation: 
 
 
( D'A' + A'B' ) D'A' −1 = DB DA −1 z 
 
 
A'B' D'A' −1 =  DB DA −1 z − 1 
 
 
D'A' = ( z DB DA −1 − 1 ) −1 A'B' 
 
 
D' = A' + ( 1 −  z DB DA −1 ) −1 A'B' 
 
 
The homography preserves the complex cross ratio of any four points. 
Analogously to the former equality, we find for any three points P, Q, R : 
 
 
P' = A' +  ( 1 −  z PB PA −1 ) −1 A'B' 
 
 
Q' = A' +  ( 1 −  z QB QA −1 ) −1 A'B' 
 
 
R' = A' +  ( 1 −  z RB RA −1 ) −1 A'B' 
 
 
D'Q' = [ ( 1 −  z QB QA −1 ) −1  −  ( 1 −  z DB DA −1 ) −1 ] A'B' = 
 
 
       = z ( −DB DA −1  + QB QA −1 ) ( 1 − z DB DA −1 ) −1 ( 1 − z QB QA −1 ) −1 A'B' 
 
 
D'R' = z ( −DB DA −1 + RB RA −1 ) ( 1 − z DB DA −1 ) −1 ( 1 − z RB RA −1 ) −1 A'B' 
 
 
P'Q' = z ( −PB PA −1 + QB QA −1 ) ( 1 − z PB PA −1 ) −1 ( 1 − z QB QA −1 ) −1 A'B' 

98 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
 
 
P'R' = z ( −PB PA −1 + RB RA −1 ) ( 1 − z PB PA −1 ) −1 ( 1 − z RB RA −1 ) −1 A'B' 
 
In the cross ratio, many factors are simplified: 
 
 
D'Q' D'R' −1 P'R' P'Q' −1 = ( −DB DA −1 + QB QA −1 ) ( −DB DA −1 + RB RA −1 ) −1 
 
 
 
( −PB PA −1 + RB RA −1 ) ( −PB PA −1 + QB QA −1 ) −1 
 
Writing the first factor as product of factors we obtain: 
 
 −DB DA −1 + QB QA −1 = − ( DA + AB ) DA −1 + ( QA + AB ) QA −1  = 
 
 
 
= −AB DA −1 + AB QA −1 = AB DA −2 ( −DA QA2 + DA2 QA ) QA −2 = 
 
 
 
=  AB DA −2 DA ( −QA + DA ) QA QA −2  
 
 
 
= AB DA −1 QD QA −1 
 
In the same way each of the other three factors can be written as product of factors: 
 
 
−DB DA −1 + RB RA −1 = AB DA −1 RD RA −1 
 
 
−PB PA −1 + RB RA −1 = AB PA −1 RP RA −1 
 
 
−PB PA −1 + QB QA −1 = AB PA −1 QP QA −1 
 
Then the cross ratio will be: 
 
 
D'Q' D'R' −1 P'R' P'Q' −1 = ( AB DA −1 QD QA −1 ) ( RA RA −1 DA AB −1 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
( AB PA −1 RP RA −1 ) ( QA QP −1 PA AB −1 ) 
 
where the brackets are not needed but only show the factors they come from. Applying the 
permutative property and simplifying, we arrive at: 
 
 
D'Q' D'R' −1 P'R' P'Q' −1 = DQ DR −1 PR PQ −1  
 
 
This proves that the cross ratio of every set of four point is preserved under a 
homography. Four points lying on a line or a circle have a real cross ratio. Then the 
homography is a circular transformation since it transforms circles into circles in a general 
sense (taking the lines as circles with infinite radius). 
 
The product of two circular inversions is always a homography because the cross 
ratio becomes conjugate under inversion and thus it is preserved under an even number of 
inversions. Let us calculate the homography resulting from a composition of two 
inversions. Let A be any point, A' be the transformed point under a first inversion with 
centre O and radius r, and A" be the transformed point of A' under a second inversion with 
centre P and radius s, which is consequently the transformed point of A under the 
homography: 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
99  
 
 
 
 
 
OA' = r2 OA −1 PA'' = s2 PA' −1 
 
From where it follows that: 
 
 
s2 PA'' −1 = PA' = OA' − OP = r2 OA −1 − OP 
 
 
PA'' −1 = s −2 ( r2 OA −1 − OP ) 
 
 
PA'' = s2 (r2 OA −1 − OP ) −1 = s2 [( r2 −OP OA ) OA −1] −1 = s2 OA (r2 −OP OA ) −1  
 
This equation allows to determine the image A" of any point A having the centre O and P 
and the radius r and s as data. For instance, let us calculate the homography corresponding 
to: 
 
 
 O = ( 0, 0 ) 
 
 r = 2  
P = ( 3, 0 ) 
 
s = 3 
 
 
OP = 3 e1 
 
In order to specify the homography we determine the images of three points: 
  
 
A = ( 0, 2 ) 
 
B = ( 1, 1 ) 
 
C = ( 1, 0 ) 
 
 
OA = 2 e2 
 
OB = e1 + e2 
 
OC = e1 
 
 
OP OA = 6 e12  
OP OB = 3 + 3 e12

Projective cross ratio 
  
 
The projective cross ratio of four 
points A, B, C and D with respect to a 
point X is defined as the cross ratio of 
the pencil of lines XA, XB, XC and XD, 
which is the cross ratio of the 
intersection points of these lines with 
any crossing line (figure 10.5). As it will 
be shown, the projective cross ratio is 
independent of the crossing line The 
intersection points A’, B’, C’ and D’ are 
Figure 10.5 

100 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
the projections with centre X of the points A, B, C and D upon the crossing line. Due to the 
alignment of these projections, the projective cross ratio is always a real number: 
 
 
{ X, A B C D } = ( A' B' C' D' ) = A'C' A'D' −1 B'D' B'C' −1 
 
 
The projected points A', B', C' and D' are dependent on the crossing line and this 
expression is not suitable for calculations. Note that the segment A'C' is the base of the 
triangle XA'C', B'D' is the base of the triangle XB'D', etc. Since the altitudes of all these 
triangles are the distance from X to the crossing line, their bases are proportional to their 
areas, so we can write:

The area of a triangle is the half of the outer product of any two sides. For example 
for the triangle XA'C' we have: 
  
 
XA' ∧ A'C' = XA' ∧ ( A'X + XC' ) = XA' ∧ XC'

because the angles A'XC' and AXC are identical, B'XD' and BXD are also identical, etc. 
Now it is obvious that the projective cross ratio does not depend on the crossing line, but 
only on the angles between the lines of the pencil. If we introduce the modulus of XA, XB, 
etc., we find the outer products of these vectors:

Now, the arbitrary crossing line of the pencil has disappeared in the formula, which has 
become suitable for calculations with Cartesian coordinates2. When the points A, B, C and 
D are aligned, the complex and projective cross ratios have the same value independently 
of the point X, because the segments AC, BD, AD and BC have the same direction, which 
can be taken as the crossing line: 
                                                 
2 The reader will find an application of this formula for the projective cross ratio to the error 
calculus in the electronic article "Estimation of the error committed in determining the place from 
where a photograph was taken", Ramon González, Josep Homs, Jordi Solsona (1999) 
http://www.terra.es/personal/rgonzal1 (translation of the paper published in the Butlletí de la 
Societat Catalana de Matemàtiques 12 [1997]  51-71).

{X, A B C D} = ( A B C D ) 
 
If  A, B, C and D lie on a circle, the complex cross ratio is equal to the projective 
cross ratio taken from any point X on that circle. To prove this statement, make an 
inversion with centre X. Since  the circle ABCDX passes through the centre of inversion, it 
is transformed into a line, where the points A', B', C' and D' (transformed of A, B, C and D 
by the inversion) lie with the same cross ratio. Now observe that X, A and A’ are aligned, 
also X, B and B’, etc. So the projective cross ratio is equal to the complex cross ratio. 
From the arguments given above, it follows that the cross ratio of a pencil of lines 
is the quotient of the outer products of their direction (or normal) vectors independently of 
their modulus:

Instead of XA, XB, XC and XD, I shall denote by A, B, C and D the pencil of lines 
passing through X. Then the projective cross ratio {X, ABCD} is written as (ABCD). Let 
us suppose that these lines have the following dual coordinates expressed in the lines base 
{O, P, Q}: 
 
 
A = [xA , yA] 
 
B = [xB , yB] 
 
C = [xC , yC] 
 
D =[xD , yD]

where the four dual vectors are proportional. That is: the projective cross ratio of a pencil 
of lines is the cross ratio of the corresponding dual points. Obviously, by means of the 
duality principle the dual proposition must also hold: the cross ratio of four aligned points 
is equal to the projective cross ratio of the dual pencil of the corresponding lines on the 
dual plane. 
  
 
 
The points at the infinity and homogeneous coordinates 
 
 
The points at the infinity play the same role as the points with finite coordinates in 
the projective geometry. Under a projectivity they can be mapped mutually without 
special distinction. In order to avoid the algebraic inconsistencies of the infinity, the 
homogeneous coordinates are defined as proportional to the barycentric coordinates with 
a no fixed homogeneous constant. The following expressions are equivalent and represent 
the same point: 
 
 
 (x,  y) = (1 − x − y,  x,  y) = k (1 − x − y,  x,  y) 
 
Then for instance: 
 
 
(2, 3) = (−4, 2, 3 ) = (−20, 10, 15) 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
103  
 
 
 
 
A point has finite coordinates if and only if the sum of the homogeneous 
coordinates are different from zero. In this case we can normalise the coordinates 
dividing by this sum in order to obtain the barycentric coordinates, and hence the 
Cartesian coordinates by omitting the first coordinate. On the other hand, the sum of the 
homogeneous coordinates sometimes vanishes and then they cannot be normalised (the 
normalisation implies a division by zero yielding infinite values). In this case, we are 
regarding a point at the infinity, whose algebraic operations should be performed with 
the finite values of the homogeneous coordinates3. For example: 
 
 
(2, −1, −1) = (2 ∞, −∞, −∞) = (∞, ∞) 
 
This is the point at the infinity in the direction of the bisector of the first quadrant. On the 
other hand, points at the infinity are equivalent to directions and hence to vectors. For 
example: 
 
 
v = 2 O − P − Q = −OP−OQ = −2 e1 −2 e2  
 
Every vector proportional to v also represents this direction and the point at the infinity 
given above. 
 
 
 
Perspectivity and projectivity 
 
 
A perspectivity is a central projection of a range of points on a line upon another 
line. Since the cross ratio of a pencil of lines is independent of the crossing line, it follows 
from the construction (figure 10.6) that a 
perspectivity preserves the projective cross 
ratio: 
 
{O, A B C D} = {O, A' B' C' D'} 
 
The composition of two perspectivities with 
different centres also maps ranges4 of points 
to other ranges preserving their cross ratio. 
This is the most general transformation 
which preserves alignment and the projective 
cross ratio. A projectivity (also projective 
transformation) is defined as the geometric transformation which maps aligned points to 
aligned points preserving their cross ratio. A theorem of projective geometry states that 
any projectivity is expressible as the sequence of not more than three perspectivities. If the 
projectivity relates ranges on two distinct lines, two perspectivities suffice. 
                                                 
3 In fact, the calculations are equally feasible with ∞ if we understand it strictly as a number. 
Then the equality 2∞ = ∞ should be wrong. We could simplify by ∞, e.g.: (2 ∞, −∞, 1) = (2, −1, 
0) is a finite point and (2 ∞, −∞, −∞) = (2, −1, −1) a point at the infinity. 
4 A range of points is defined as a set of aligned points.  
Figure 10.6

A projectivity is determined by giving three aligned points and their corresponding 
images, which must be also aligned. On the other hand, a projectivity is determined by 
giving four points no three of which are collinear (a quadrilateral) and their non-aligned 
images (another quadrilateral). Since the projectivity preserves the alignment and the 
incidence, we must take a linear transformation of the coordinates. However, the affinity 
is already a linear transformation of coordinates but only of the independent coordinates. 
The more general linear transformation must account for all the three barycentric 
coordinates. Thus the projectivity is given by a 3×3 matrix:

The coefficients hij being given, the product of the matrices on the right hand side 
does not warrantee a set of coordinates with sum equal to 1. This means that the matrix hij 
of a perspectivity is defined except by the proportionality constant k (which depends on 
the coordinates), and the transformed point is obtained with homogeneous coordinates 
instead of barycentric ones. Nevertheless, this matrix maps collinear points to collinear 
points. This follows immediately from the matrices equalities:

This case exemplifies how points at the infinity can be mapped under a projectivity to 
points with finite coordinates and vice versa. As a comparison, the affinity always maps 
points at the infinity to points at the infinity (although it does not leave them invariant). 
That is, the affinity always maps parallel lines to parallel lines, while under a projectivity 
parallel lines can be mapped to concurrent lines and vice versa5. Parallel lines are 
concurrent in a point at the infinity, which does not play any special role in the 
projectivity. 
 
Let us see that four non collinear points (a quadrilateral) and their non collinear 
images (another quadrilateral) determine a unique projectivity. Let us suppose that the 
images of the points (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1) are (a1, a2), (b1, b2), (c1, c2) and (d1, d2) 
where no three of which are collinear. The barycentric coordinates of these points are: 
 
 
(0, 0) = (1, 0, 0) 
(1, 0) = (0, 1, 0) 
(0, 1) = (0, 0, 1) 
 
(a1, a2) = (a0, a1, a2)    with  
a0 = 1− a1 − a2  
etc. 
 
The substitution into the matrix equality produces a system of three equations with three 
unknowns k, l and m:

Since the points (0, 0), (1, 0) and (0, 1) are not collinear, the matrix is regular and the 
system has a unique solution, which proves that a projectivity is determined by the image 
of the base quadrilateral. If the vertices of the initial quadrilateral are not the base points, 
the matrix is calculated as the product of the inverse matrix of the projectivity which maps 
the base quadrilateral to the initial quadrilateral multiplied by the matrix of the projectivity 
which maps the point base to the final quadrilateral. 
 
Let us calculate the projectivity which maps the quadrilateral with vertices (1, 1)-
(2, 3)-(3, 1)-(1, 0) to the quadrilateral  (4, 1)-(6, 0)-(4, 0)-(6, 1). The projectivity which

A projectivity may be also defined in an alternative way: let ABCD be a 
quadrilateral and A'B'C'D' another quadrilateral. Then the mapping:

D = a A + b B + c C    
→ 
D' = a' A' + b' B' + c' C' 
 
is a projectivity if the coefficients a', b', c' are homogeneous linear functions of a, b, c. For 
example in the foregoing example the quadrilateral (1, 1)-(2, 3)-(3, 1)-(1, 0) is mapped to 
the quadrilateral  (4, 1)-(6, 0)-(4, 0)-(6, 1). Then we have:

Let us prove that a projectivity defined in this algebraic way leaves invariant the 
projective cross ratio (as evident by construction from perspectivities). Under a 
projectivity, four collinear points A, B, C and D are transformed into another four collinear 
points A', B', C' and D' . Their cross ratio is the quotient of differences of any coordinate 
(it is not needed that x and y are Cartesian coordinates) because these differences for x are 
proportional to the differences for y due to the alignment:

Let us suppose that the collinear points A, B, C and D lie on the line having the equation y 
= s x + t, where the constants s and t play the role of a “slope” and “ordinate intercept” 
although the x-axis and the y-axis be not orthogonal:

Now we see that a projectivity changes every single ratio due to the denominators, but the 
cross ratio is preserved because these denominators are cancelled in this case:

The projectivity as a tool for theorems demonstration 
 
 
One of the most interesting applications of the projectivity is the demonstration of 
theorems of projective nature owing to the fact that the projectivity preserves alignment 
and incidence. For example, in the figure 10.3 I have displayed without proof the method 
of construction of the fourth point which 
completes a harmonic range from the other 
three. Now let us apply to this figure a 
projectivity which maps the point A to the 
infinity. In this case the lines ABCD, R and S 
become parallel (figure 10.7) and the cross ratio 
becomes a single ratio:

By similarity of triangles one sees that B'D' =2 
B'C', so that the cross ratio is 2 and 
proves that the points A, B, C and 
D in the figure 10.3 are a harmonic 
range. 
 
Another example is the 
proof of the Pappus’ theorem: the 
lines joining points with distinct 
letters belonging to two distinct 
ranges ABC and A'B'C' intersect in 
three collinear points L, M and N 
(figure 
10.8). 
Applying 
a 
perspectivity to make both ranges 
parallel, now we see that the 
triangles ABL and A'B'L are

The linear relation between L, M and N is very useful to calculate the cross ratio 
(LMNR). In fact the coefficients of the midpoints are the relative altitudes of the point with 
respect to both parallel lines. Since this cross ratio is also the quotient of the relative 
altitudes, we have:

The single ratio is the cross ratio corresponding to O = ∞. This identity of cross ratios is 
preserved under a projectivity and it is also valid for the upper scheme on the figure 10.8

The homology 
 
 
The points A', B' are homologous of the points A and B with respect to the centre 
O and the axis of homology given by the point F and the vector v (figure 10.9) if: 
 
1) The centre O does not lie on the axis. 
   
2) Every pair of homologous points and the homology centre are aligned, that is, 
O, A and A' are aligned and also O, B and B'. 
   
3) Every pair of homologous lines AB and A'B' intersects in a point on the 
homology axis. 
 
A homology6 is determined by an axis, a 
centre O and a pair of homologous points A and 
A'. To obtain the homologous of any point B, we 
draw the line AB, whose intersection with the 
homology axis will be denoted as Z. Then we 
draw the line A'Z and the intersection with the 
line OB is the homologous point B'. By 
construction, the homology axis and the lines 
AB, A'B' and OZ are concurrent in Z. The 
projective cross ratio of this pencil of lines is 
independent of the crossing line where it is 
measured. Let G and H be the intersections of 
the homology axis with the lines OA and OB 
respectively. Then we have: 
 
 
{ Z, O A G A' } = { Z, O B H B' } 
 
                                                 
6 The word homology is used by H. Eves (A Survey of Geometry, p. 105) with a different 
meaning. He names as homology a composite homothety, that is, a single homothety followed 
by a rotation. 
Figure 10.9 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
111  
 
 
 
Since the four points of each set are collinear, their projective cross ratio is identical to 
their complex cross ratio: 
 
 
( O A G A' ) = ( O B H B' ) 
 
That is, the cross ratio of the four points O, B, H and B' is a real constant r for any point B 
and is called homology ratio. Hence we can write: 
 
( O B H B' ) = OH OB' −1 BB' BH −1 = r ≠ 1, 0 
 
This equation leads to a simpler definition of the homology: B' is the homologous point of 
B with respect a given axis and centre O (outside the axis) with ratio r if O, B and B' are 
aligned and the cross ratio ( O B H B' ) is equal to r, being H the intersection point of the 
line OB with the homology axis. Hence, a homology is determined by giving a centre O, 
an axis and the homology ratio. If the homology ratio is the unity we have two degenerate 
cases: whether B lies on O and B' is any point, or B' lies on H (on the homology axis) and 
B is any point, that is, there is not one to one mapping, a not useful transformation. Then 
we must impose a ratio distinct of the 
unity. On the other hand, a null 
homology ratio implies that BB' = 0 and 
the homology becomes the identity. 
In the special case r = 2 (when 
the points A and A′ are harmonic 
conjugates with respect O and H) the 
transformation is called a harmonic 
homology.  
 
The first limit line is defined as 
the set of points L on the plane having as 
homologous points those at infinity 
(figure 10.10): 
  
( O L H ∞ ) = OH O∞
 −1 L∞ LH −1 = r 
 
The limit of the quotient of both distances tending to the infinity is the unity: 
 
 
∞
→
=

Then:  
OH LH −1 = r  
⇒ 
LH OH −1 = r −1 
 
Because all the points H lie on the homology axis, all the points L form a line, the limit 
line. 
 
The second limit line is defined as the points that are homologous of those at 
infinity: 
 
( O ∞ H L' ) = OH OL' −1 ∞L' ∞H −1 = r 
Figure 10.10 

112 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
 
OH OL' −1 = r  
⇒ 
OL' OH −1 = r −1 
 
Therefore the distance from the second limit line to the homology axis is equal to the 
distance from the first limit line to the homology centre (figure 10.10), and both lines are 
located whether between or outside both elements according to the value of r:  
 
 
OL' = LH = r −1 OH 
 
 
Let us calculate the homologous point B' for every point B on the plane. Since H is 
a changing point on the homology axis, we write it as a function of a fixed point F also on 
the axis and its direction vector v (figure 10.9). At one time, the point H is the intersection 
of the line OB and the homology axis: 
 
 
H = O + b OB = F + k v 
 
k, b real 
 
 
b OB − k v = OF 
⇒ 
b = OF ∧ v ( OB ∧ v ) −1 
 
 
H = O + OF ∧ v ( OB ∧ v ) −1 OB 
 
Now we may calculate the segments OH and BH: 
 
 
OH = OF ∧ v ( OB ∧ v ) −1 OB 
 
 
BH = BO + OF ∧ v ( OB ∧ v ) −1 OB = [ OF ∧ v ( OB ∧ v ) −1 − 1 ] OB = 
 
 
     = ( OF ∧ v − OB ∧ v ) ( OB ∧ v ) −1 OB = BF ∧ v ( OB ∧ v ) −1 OB 
 
By substitution in the cross ratio we obtain: 
 
 
OH OB' −1 BB' BH −1 = OH BH −1 BB' OB' −1 = OF ∧ v ( BF ∧ v ) −1 BB' OB' −1 = r 
 
 
BB' OB' −1 = r v ∧ BF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 
 
and isolating OB' as a function of OB and other known data: 
 
( −OB + OB' ) OB' −1 = r v ∧ BF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 −OB OB' −1 = r v ∧ BF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 − 1 
 
 
OB' −1 = OB −1 [ 1 − r v ∧ BF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] = OB −1 ( v ∧ OF − r v ∧ BF ) ( v ∧ OF ) −1 
 
Inverting the vectors we find: 
 
 
OB' = OB v ∧ OF ( v ∧ OF − r v ∧ BF ) −1 = OB ( 1 − r v ∧ BF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ) −1 
 
This equation allows to calculate the homologous point B' of any point B using the data of 
the homology: the centre O, the ratio r, and a direction vector v and a point F of the axis. 
 
The homology preserves the projective cross ratio of any set of points. Let A', B', 
C', D' and E' be the transformed points of A, B, C, D and E under the homology. Then: 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
113  
 
 
 
 
 
{ E, A B C D } = { E', A' B' C' D' } 
 
Let us prove this statement. Being A' and E' homologous points of A and E we have:   
 
 
OA' = OA ( 1 − r v ∧ AF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ) −1 
 
 
OE' = OE ( 1 − r v ∧ EF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ) −1 
 
 
Thus the segment E'A' is: 
 
 
E'A' = OA' − OE'  
 
   E'A' = OA ( 1 − r v ∧ AF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ) −1 − OE ( 1 − r v ∧ EF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ) −1 = 
 
 
= [ OA ( 1 − r v ∧ EF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ) − OE ( 1 − r v ∧ AF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ) ]  
 
 
 
[ 1 − r v ∧ AF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 [ 1 − r v ∧ EF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 = 
 
 
= [ EA + r ( −OA v ∧ EF + OE v ∧ AF ) ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] 
 
 
 
[ 1 − r v ∧ AF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 [ 1 − r v ∧ EF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 = 
 
 
= [ EA ( 1 − r ) + r ( OA v ∧ OE − OE v ∧ OA ) ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] 
 
 
 
[ 1 − r v ∧ AF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 [ 1 − r v ∧ EF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 = 
 
 
= [ EA ( 1 − r ) + r v OA ∧ OE ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] 
 
 
 
[ 1 − r v ∧ AF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 [ 1 − r v ∧ EF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1  
 
For the other vectors analogous expressions are obtained: 
 
E'B' = [ EB ( 1− r ) + r v OB ∧ OE ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] 
 
 
 
[ 1 − r v ∧ BF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 [ 1 − r v ∧ EF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 
 
E'C' = [ EC ( 1− r ) + r v OC ∧ OE ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] 
 
 
 
[ 1 − r v ∧ CF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 [ 1 − r v ∧ EF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 
 
E'D' = [ ED ( 1− r ) + r v OD ∧ OE ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] 
 
 
 
[ 1 − r v ∧ DF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 [ 1 − r v ∧ EF ( v ∧ OF ) −1 ] −1 
 
 
Let us calculate the outer product E'A' ∧ E'C': 
 

114

E'A' ∧ E'C' = [ EA ∧ EC ( 1 − r )2 + ( EA ∧ v OC ∧ OE + v ∧ EC OA ∧ OE ) r ( 1 − r )

By substitution of the following identity, which may be proved by means of the geometric

This proves that the projective cross ratio of any four points A, B, C and D with respect to 
a centre of projection E is equal to the projective cross ratio of the homologous points A', 
B', C' and D' with respect to the homologous centre of projection E'. It means that the 
homology is a special kind of projectivity where a line is preserved, the axis of homology. 
When the centre of projection is a point H on the homology axis, H and H' are coincident 
and we find in the former equality the initial condition of the homology again: 
 
 
H = H'   
{ H, A' B' C' D' } = { H, A B C D }  
 
 
The following chapter is devoted to the conics and the Chasles’ theorem, which 
states that the locus of the points from where the projective cross ratio of any four points 
is constant is a conic passing through these four points. Since the homology preserves the 
projective cross ratio, it transform conics into conics. Hence, a conic may be drawn as the 
homologous curve of a circle. Depending on the position of this circle there are three 
cases: 
 
1) The circle does not cut the limit line L (whose homologous is the line at 
infinity). In this case the homologous curve is an ellipse, because very next points on the 
circle have also very next homologous points and therefore the homologous curve must be 
closed. 
 
2) The circle touches the limit line L. Then its homologous curve is the parabola, 
because the homologous of the contact point is a point at infinity. The symmetry axis of

the parabola has the direction of the line passing through the centre of homology and the 
contact point.  
 
3) The circle cuts the limit line L. Then the homologous curve is the hyperbola 
because the homologous points of both intersections are two points at infinity. The lines 
passing through the centre of homology and both intersection points have the direction of 
the asymptotes.

11. CONICS 
 
Conic sections 
 
 
The conic sections (or conics) are the intersections of a conic surface with any 
transversal plane (figure 11.1). The proper conics are the curves obtained with a plane not 
passing through the vertex of the cone. If the plane contains the vertex we have improper 
conics, which reduce to a pair of straight lines or a point. In general, I shall regard only 
proper conics, taking into account that the other case can be usually obtained as a limit 
case. 
 
Let us consider the two spheres inscribed in the cone which are tangent to the 
plane of the conic. The spheres touch this plane at the points F and F', the foci of the conic 
section. On the other hand, both spheres touch the cone surface at two tangency circles 
lying in planes perpendicular to the cone axis. The directrices of the conic are defined as 
the intersections of these planes with the plane of the conic. 
 
Let P be a point on the conic. Since it lies on the plane of the conic, the segment 
going from P to the focus F is tangent to the sphere. Since it belongs to the cone surface, 
the generatrix passing through P is also tangent to the sphere. PF and PS are tangent to the 
same sphere so that their lengths are equal: PF=PS. Also PF' and PS' are tangent to 
the other sphere so that their lengths are also equal: PF'=PS'. On the other hand the 
segment SS' of any directrix has constant length, what implies that the addition of 
distances from any point P on the conic to both foci is constant:

This discussion slightly changes for a plane which intercepts the upper and lower cones. 
In this case, the distances from P to the upper sphere and to the upper branch of the curve 
must be considered negative1. If the plane is parallel to a generatrix of the cone these 
distances become infinite. This unified point of view for all conics using negative or 
infinite distances when needed will be the guide of this chapter. I shall not separate 
equations but only specify cases for distinct conics. 
 
A lateral view of figure 11.1 is given in the figure 11.2. In this figure the point P 
has been drawn in both extremes of the conic (and S and S' also twice), although we must 
consider any point on the conic section. As indicated previously PF=PS. But PS 
is proportional to the distance from P to the upper plane containing S and this distance is 
also proportional to the distance from P to the directrix r (figure 11.2):

The quotient of the sines of both angles is called the eccentricity e of the conic:

Then a conic can be also defined as 
the geometric locus of the points P 
whose distance from the focus F is 
proportional to the distance from the 
directrix r (figure 11.3).

FP is called the focal radius. Let T 
be the point of the directrix closest to 
the focus (figure 11.3). Then the main 
axis of symmetry of the conic is the line 
which is perpendicular to the directrix and 
passes through the focus. Under a 
reflection with respect the main axis of 
symmetry, the conic is preserved. The 
oriented distance from any point P to the 
directrix r is expressed, using the vector 
FT, as: 
 
                                                 
1 To consider sensed distances is not a trouble but an advantage. For example, the distance from 
a point to a line can be also taken as an oriented distance, whose sign indicates the half-plane 
where the point lies.

Defined in this way, the distance from P to r is positive when P is placed on the half-plane

P lies on the other half-plane. The equation of the conic becomes:

According to the value of the eccentricity there are three types of proper conics: 
1) For 0 < e < 1, the inclination α of the plane of the conic is lower than the 
inclination δ of the cone generatrix and the denominator is always positive. 
Then the focal radius is always positive and the points P form a closed curve 
on the focal half-plane, an ellipse. 
2) For e = 1, α  = δ , the plane of the conic is parallel to a cone generatrix. Since 
the denominator vanishes for β = π, the points P form an open curve called 
parabola. Except for this value of β, the radius is always positive and the 
curve lies on the focal half-plane. 
3) For e > 1, α >δ , the plane of the conic intercepts both upper and lower cones. 
The denominator vanishes twice so that it is an open curve with two branches 
called hyperbola (figure 
11.4). The lowest positive 
angle 
that 
makes 
the 
denominator zero is the 
asymptote angle βa :

The focal radius is positive (P lies on the focal branch) for the ranges of β : 
 
0 < β < βa        and  
2π – βa < β < 2π 
 
and negative (P lies on the non focal branch) for the range: 
 
βa < β < 2π – βa 
 
A negative focal radius means that we must take the sense opposite that determined by the 
angle (figure 11.4). For example, a radius –2 with an angle 7π/6 is equivalent to a radius 2 
with an angle of π/6. So the vertex T' of the non focal branch has an angle π (not zero as it 
would appear) and a negative focal radius. 
 
 
 
Two foci and two directrices 
 
 
There are usually two spheres 
touching the cone surface and the conic 
plane, and hence there are also two foci. For 
the case of the ellipse, both tangent spheres 
are located in the same cone. For the case of 
the hyperbola, each sphere is placed in each 
cone so that each focus is placed next to 
each branch. In the case of the parabola, 
one sphere and the corresponding focus is 
placed at the infinity. For the improper 
conics, the tangent spheres have null radius 
and the foci are coincident with the vertex of 
the cone, which is the crossing point of both 
lines. 
 
As the figure 11.1 shows for a proper 
conic, both directrices r and r' are parallel, and 
both foci F and F' are located on the axis of 
symmetry of the conic. Above we have already 
seen that the addition of oriented distances 
from both foci to any point P is constant. Let 
us see the relation with the distance between 
the directrices. If P is any point on the conic 
then:

The sum of the oriented distances from any point P to any two parallel lines (the 
directrices in our case) is constant2. Then the addition of both focal radii of any point P 
                                                 
2 Note that this statement is only right for oriented distances but not for positive distances.

on the conic is the product of the eccentricity multiplied by the oriented distance between 
both directrices. P can be any point, for example Q, the extreme of the conic:

whence it follows that the addition of both focal radii is QQ' , the major diameter. 
Specifying: 
1) For the case of the ellipse (figure 11.5), both focal radii are positive and also 
the major diameter. 
2) For the case of the parabola, one directrix is the line at the infinity and one 
focus is a point at the infinity on the main axis of symmetry. Hence the major 
diameter has an infinite value. 
3) For the case of the hyperbola (figure 11.6), the focal radius of a point on the 
non focal branch is negative, its absolute value being higher than the other 
focal radius, which is positive, yielding a negative major diameter.

RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
The eccentricity is the ratio of the distance between both foci divided by the major 
diameter. For the case of ellipse, both distances are positive. For the case of the hyperbola, 
both distances are negative, so the eccentricity is always positive. When e = 0 both foci 
are coincident in the centre of a circle. Note that the circle is obtained when we cut the 
cone with a horizontal plane. In this case, the directrices are the line at the infinity. 
The vectorial equation of a conic is obtained from the polar equation and contains 
the radius vector FP. Since FP forms with FQ an angle β (figure 11.3), FP is obtained 
from the unitary vector of FQ via multiplication by the exponential with argument β and 
by the modulus of FP yielding:

On the other hand, from the directrix property, one easily finds the following 
equation for a conic: 
 
 
FP2 FT2 = e2 ( FT2 − FT · FP )2 
  
F, T and e are parameters of the conic, and P = (x, y) is the mobile point. Therefore from 
this equation we will also obtain a Cartesian equation of second degree. For example, let 
us calculate the Cartesian equation of an ellipse with eccentricity ½ and focus at the point 
(3, 4) and vertex at (4,5): 
 
 
e = 1/2  
F = ( 3, 4 ) 
 
Q = ( 4, 5 )

[ ( x − 3 )2 + ( y − 4 )2 ] 18 = 4
1 [ 18 − ( 3 (x − 3) + 3 ( y − 4 ) ) ]2 
 
After simplification: 
 
7 x2  − 2 x y + 7 y2 − 22 x − 38 y + 31 = 0 
 
 
The Chasles’ theorem 
 
 
According to this theorem3, the 
projective cross ratio of any four given 
points A, B, C and D on a conic with 
respect to a point X also on this conic is 
constant independently of the choice of

the point X (figure 11.7): 
{ X, A B C D } = { X', A B C D } 
 
To prove this theorem, let us take into 
account that the points A, B, C, D and X must 
fulfil the vectorial equation of the conic. Let 
us also suppose, without loss of generality, 
the main axis of symmetry having the 
direction e1 (this supposition simplifies the 
calculations): 
 
 
FQ = FQ e1 
 
Now on α, β, γ, δ and χ will be the angles

In the same way the other outer products are obtained. The projective cross ratio is their

since γ −α is the angle AFC, etc. Therefore, the projective cross ratio of four points A, B, 
C and D on a conic is equal to the quotient of the sines of the focal half-angles, which do 
not depend on X, but only on the positions of A, B, C and D, fact which proves the 
Chasles’ theorem. This statement is trivial for the case of the circumference, because the 
inscribed angles are the half of the central angles. However the inscribed angles on a conic 
vary with the position of the point X and they differ from the half focal angles. In spite of 
this, it is a notable result that the quotient of the sines of the inscribed angles (projective 
cross ratio) is equal to the quotient of the half focal angles. For the case of the hyperbola I 
remind you that the focal radius of a point on the non focal branch is oriented with the 
opposite sense and the focal angle is measured with respect this orientation.

Let us see now that the normal 
vector has the direction of the bisector of 
the angle between both focal radii (figure 
11.10). In order to prove this statement, let 
us consider an infinitesimal displacement 
of a point P on the conic (figure 11.11). 
The sum of the focal radii of any conic is constant, whence it follows that the addition of 
their differentials are null: 
 
 
FP + F'P = constant 
⇒ 
0 = dFP + dF'P 
 
 
The differential of the focal 
radius4 is obtained by differentiating the 
square of the focal vector: 
  
d FP2 = 2 FP · d FP = 2 FP dFP

since the differentials of the focal vectors are equal: dP = d FP = d F'P. In conclusion the 
differential vector (or the tangent vector) is orthogonal to the bisector of both focal 
vectors. The figure 11.11 clearly shows that both right triangles are opposite because they 
share the same hypotenuse d FP, and the legs dFP and dF'P have the same length. 
The reflection axis of both triangles, which is the shorter diagonal of the rhombus, is the 
bisector line of both focal vectors. 
 
In the case of the parabola (figure 11.12), the focus F' is located at the infinity and 
F'P is parallel to the main axis of symmetry. In the case of the hyperbola (figure 11.13) 
we must take into account that the radius of a point on the non focal branch is negative, so 
                                                 
4 Note that it differs from the modulus of the differential of the focal vector: dFP≠d FP.

it has the sense from P to the focus F'. The normal direction is the bisector of both 
oriented focal vectors. 
 
These geometric features are the widely known optic reflection properties of the 
conics: parallel beams reflected by a parabola are concurrent at the focus. Also the beams 
emitted by a focus of an ellipse and reflected in its perimeter are concurrent in the other 
focus.  
 
 
 
 
Central equations for the ellipse and hyperbola 
 
 
We search a polar equation to describe a conic using its centre as the origin of the 
radius. Above we have seen that the eccentricity is the ratio of the distance between both 
foci and the major diameter:

If O is the centre of the conic then it is the 
midpoint of both foci:

For the case of  the ellipse all the quantities are positive. For the case of the 
hyperbola both OF and OQ are negative with FQ positive. Let the angle QOP be 
γ (figure 11.14). Then: 
  
 
OP sin γ = FP sin α 
 
 
OP cos γ = OF + FP cos α

For the ellipse all the moduli are positive whereas for the hyperbola OP and 
OF are always negative (the centre is placed between both branches). For the parabola 
they become infinite. By substitution of the polar equation into these equalities we have:

Let R be the point P for γ =π/2. Then OR lies on the secondary axis of symmetry 
of the conic, which is perpendicular to OQ, the main axis of symmetry. ORis the minor

Taking OP and OQ as the coordinates axis and O the origin of coordinates, we have the

This equation of a conic is specific of this coordinate system and has a limited 
usefulness. If another system of coordinates is used (the general case) the equation is 
always of second degree but not so beautiful. For the ellipse both half-axis are positive 
real numbers. However for the hyperbola, the minor half-axis OQ is imaginary and 
OQ2<0 converting the sum of the squares in the former equation in a difference of real 
positive quantities.

5 G. Peano (Gli elementi di calcolo geometrico [1891] in Opere Scelte, vol. III, Edizioni Cremone, 
[Roma, 1959], p.59) gives this central equation for the ellipse as function of the angle θ. He also 
used the parametric equations of the parabola, hyperbola, cycloid, epicycloid and the spiral of 
Archimedes.  
Figure 11.15

Then θ is an angle between axial planes of the cylinder. 
The equation of the ellipse may be written using another pair of axis turned by a 
cylindrical angle χ  (figure 11.16):

Each pair of OQ' and OR' obtained in this way are conjugate central radii and 
twice them are conjugate diameters. They are intersections of the plane of the ellipse with 
two axial planes of the cylinder that form 
a right angle. From the definition it is 
obvious that: 
 
 
OQ' 2 + OR'  2 = OQ2 + OR2 
 
 
The inverse relation between the 
conjugate radii are:

Then, the central radius of any point P is: 
 
OP = ( OQ' cos χ − OR' sin χ ) cos θ  + ( OQ' sin χ + OR' cos χ ) sin θ  
 
      = OQ' cos( θ −χ ) + OR' sin( θ −χ ) 
 
Changing the sign of the cylindrical angle we obtain another point P' on the ellipse owing 
to the parity of trigonometric functions: 
 
 
OP' = OQ' cos(θ −χ ) − OR' sin(θ −χ ) = OQ' cos(χ −θ ) + OR' sin(χ −θ ) 
 
Then the chord PP' is parallel to the radius OR' (figure 11.16): 
 
 
PP' = OP' − OP =  −2 OR' sin( θ − χ ) 
 
Now, let us mention the Apollonius theorem: a diameter of a conic is formed by 
all the midpoints of the chords parallel to its conjugate diameter. To prove this statement, 
see that the central radius of the midpoint has the direction OQ':

The properties of the conjugate diameters are also applicable to the hyperbola, but 
taking into account that OR2 = (1 − e2) OQ2 < 0, that is, the minor half-axis OR is an 
imaginary number. In this case OR has the same direction than OQ:

Also it is verified that the diameter is formed by the midpoints of the chords parallels to

A complete understanding of the central equation of the hyperbola is found in the 
hyperbolic prism in a pseudo-Euclidean space. The equality OQ' 2 − OS'  2 = OQ2 − OS2 is 
the condition of hyperbolic prism of constant radius. Then the hyperbolas are planar 
section of this hyperbolic prism. 
 
 
 
Conic passing through five points

where there are five independent parameters, the substitution of the coordinates of five 
points leads to a linear system with five equation, with a hard solving. A briefer way to 
obtain the Cartesian equation of the conic passing through these points is through the 
Chasles’ theorem. Let us see an example: 
 
 
A = (1, 1) 
B = (2, 3) 
C = (1, −1) 
D = (0, 0) 
E = (−1, 3) 
 
 
EA = (2, −2) 
EB = (3, 0) 
EC = (2, −4) 
ED = (1, −3) 
 
The projective cross ratio of the four points A, B, C and D on the conic is:

If we denote by t, u and v the dual coordinates, the dual homogeneous coordinates t', u'

Now we see that this is twice the matrix of the conic equation (the matrix of a conic is 
defined except by a common factor). Let M be the matrix of the conic, X the matrix of the 
point coordinates, and U the matrix of the dual (homogeneous or normalised) coordinates. 
 
 
U = M X 
 
 
M −1 U = X 
 
 
XT = UT M −1 
 
because like M, the inverse matrix M −1 is also symmetric and does not change under

transposition. The substitution in the equation of the conic XT M X = 0 gives: 
 
UT M −1 U = 0 
 
That is, the matrix of the dual conic equation is the inverse of the matrix of the point 
conic. Every tangent line of the conic is mapped onto a point of the dual conic and vice 
versa. Let us consider for instance the ellipse:

A polarity is a correlation whose square is the identity. This means that by 
applying it twice, a point is mapped onto itself and a line is mapped onto itself. Let us 
consider the line [a, b, c]:

since [ a''  b''  c'' ]= k [ a   b   c ] where k is a homogeneous constant. Whence it follows 
that the matrix M is symmetric for a polarity. 
Under a polarity a point is mapped to its polar line. This point is also called the 
pole of the line. The polarity transforms the pole into the polar and the polar into the pole. 
In general the polar does not include the pole, except by a certain subset of points on the 
plane. The set of points belonging to their own polar line (self-conjugate points) fulfil the 
equation:

which is just the equation of its dual

every conic defines a polarity. However

depending on the eigenvalues of the matrix, there are polarities that do not have any 
associated conic.   
 
The polar of a point outside its associated conic is the line passing through the 
points of contact of the tangents drawn from the point (figure 11.18). The reason is the 
following: the polarity maps the tangent lines of the associated conic to the tangency 
points, so its intersection (the pole) must be transformed into the line passing through the 
tangency points. 
 
 
 
Reduction of the conic matrix to a diagonal form 
 
 
Since the matrix of a polarity is symmetric, we can reduce it to a diagonal form. 
Let D be the diagonal matrix and B the exchange base matrix. Then: 
 
 
M = B −1 D B

There exist three eigenvectors of the conic matrix. These eigenvectors are also 
characteristic vectors of the dual conic matrix with inverse eigenvalues: 
 
 
 M −1 = B −1 D −1 B

The eigenvectors are three points (equal for both punctual and dual planes) that I will call 
the eigenpoints of the polarity. Let X be a point on the conic given in Cartesian 
coordinates. Then: 
 
 
XT M X = XT B −1 D B X = VT D V 
 
where V = B X are the coordinates of the point in the base of eigenpoints. If we name with 
t, u, v the eigencoordinates, then the equation of the conic is simply:

The eigenpoints of a polarity do not never belong to the associated conic since they have 
the eigencoordinates (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1) and di ≠ 0. On the other hand, the conic 
only exist if the eigenvalues have different signs (one positive and two negative or one 
negative and two positive). This fact classifies the polarities in two classes: those having 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
137 
an associated conic, and those not having an associated conic. In fact, if we state a level, a 
certain value of the matrix product, there can be a conic or not. That is, there is a family of 
conics for different levels and there is a threshold value, from where the conic does not 
exist. 
 
 
 
Using a base of points on the conic 
 
 
 If instead of Cartesian coordinates we use the coordinates of a base of three points 
A, B and C lying on the conic, the coefficients on the matrix diagonal vanish. Then the 
equation of the conic is:

THIRD PART: PSEUDO-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY 
 
This part is devoted to the hyperbolic plane, where vectors and numbers have a 
pseudo Euclidean modulus, that is, a modulus of a Minkowski space. The bidimensional 
geometric algebra already includes the Euclidean and pseudo Euclidean planes. In fact, 
the geometric algebra does not make any special distinction between both kinds of 
planes. On the other hand, the plane geometric algebra can be represented by real 2×2 
matrices, which helps us to define some concepts with more precision. 
 
 
12. MATRIX REPRESENTATION AND HYPERBOLIC NUMBERS 
 
All the associative algebras with neutral elements for the addition and product 
can be represented with matrices. The representations can have different dimensions, 
but the most interesting is the minimal representation which is an isomorphism.  
 
 
Rotations and the representation of complex numbers  
 
 
We have seen that a rotation of a vector v over an angle α is written in geometric 
algebra as: 
 
 
v' = v ( cos α + e12 sin α ) 
 
Separating the components: 
 
 
v1' = v1 cos α  − v2 sin α 
 
 
v2' = v1 sin α + v2 cos α   
 
and writing them in matrix form, we have:

Now we wish to obtain also the matrix representation for vectors. Note that the 
matrix form of the rotation of a vector gives us the first row of the vector representation, 
which may be completed with a suitable second row:

The product of elements of this kind is commutative (and also associative). Because of 
this, we may talk about «numbers»: 
 
 
( a + b e1 ) ( c + d e1 ) = a c + b d + ( a d + b c ) e1

Using the Hamilton's notation of pairs of real numbers, we write: 
 
 
( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c + b d , a d + b c )

with a and k real, and u being a fixed unitary vector, is also a set of hyperbolic numbers. 
 
By defining the conjugate of a hyperbolic number as that number with the 
opposite vector component: 
 
 
( a + b e1 )* = a − b e1 
 
we see that the square of the modulus of a hyperbolic number is equal to the product of 
this number by its conjugate: 
 
 
z2 = z z* 
 
Hence the inverse of a hyperbolic number follows:

Since the modulus is the square root of the determinant, and the determinant of a matrix 
product is equal to the product of determinants, it follows that the modulus of a product 
of hyperbolic numbers is equal to the product of moduli:

multiple of the idempotent.   
 
 
 
Hyperbolic trigonometry 
 
 
Let us consider the locus of the points (hyperbolic numbers) located at a constant 
distance r from the origin (hyperbolic numbers with constant determinant equal to r2), 
which lie on the hyperbola x2 − y2 = r2 (figure 12.1). I shall call r the hyperbolic radius 

142 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
following the analogy with the circle. The extreme of the radius is a point on the 
hyperbola with coordinates (x, y). The arc between the positive X half axis and this point 
(x, y) has an oriented length s. On the other hand, the radius, the hyperbola and the X-axis 
delimit a sector with an oriented area A. The hyperbolic angle (or argument) ψ  is defined 
as the quotient of the arc length divided by the radius1: 
 
 
 
r
s

ψ
 
 
It follows from this definition that 
the oriented area A is2:

Now we search an explicit expression of the hyperbolic functions in terms of elemental 
functions such as polynomials, exponential, logarithm, etc. The differential of the arc 
length (being real) is related with the differentials of the coordinates by the pseudo

1 Note that x2 − y2 = r2 > 0  while s2 < 0. However I overcome this trouble taking in these 
definitions r and s and also the area A as real numbers but being oriented, that is, with sign. 
 
2 The formula of the sector area is obtained by an analogous argument from Archimedes: the 
total area is the addition of areas of the infinitesimal triangles with altitude equal to r and base 
equal to ds . r being constant, the area of the hyperbola sector is A = r s / 2 . Obviously the 
radius is orthogonal to each infinitesimal piece of arc of  the hyperbola. This question and the 
concept and calculus of areas are studied with more detail in the following chapter.

Hyperbolic exponential and logarithm

The product of hyperbolic numbers, like that of complex numbers, is found by the 
multiplication of the moduli and the addition of the arguments, while the division is 
obtained as the quotient of moduli and difference of arguments. The division is not 
possible when the denominator is a multiple of an idempotent (modulus zero).

The power of a hyperbolic number has modulus equal to the power of the 
modulus, and argument the addition of arguments. Here the periodicity is absent, and 
distinct arguments always correspond to distinct numbers. The roots must be viewed 
with more detail. For example, there are four square roots of 13 + 12 e1:

that is, the equation of second degree z2 −13 −12 e1 = 0 has four solutions. Recently G. 
Casanova4 has proved that n2 is the maximum number of hyperbolic solutions 
(including real values) of an algebraic equation of nth degree. In the case of the equation 
of second degree we can use the classical formula whenever we know to solve the 
square roots. For example, let us consider the equation:

Let us study the second degree equation with real coefficients using the matrix

If the number belongs to a half-sector different from the first, some of the elements on 
the diagonal is negative and there is not any even root. This shows a panorama of the 
hyperbolic algebra far from that of the complex numbers. 
 
  
Hyperbolic analytic functions

to be analytic? We wish that the derivative be well defined:

that is, this limit must be independent of the direction of ∆z. If f(z) = a + b e1 and the

Note that the exponential and logarithm fulfil these conditions and therefore they are  
hyperbolic analytic functions. More exactly, the exponential is analytic in all the plane 
while the logarithm is analytic for the sector of hyperbolic numbers with positive 
determinant.

hyperbolic partial differential equation (also called wave equation):

Now, we must state the main integral theorem for hyperbolic analytic functions: 
if a hyperbolic function is analytic in a certain domain on the hyperbolic plane, then its 
integral following a closed way C within this domain is zero. If the hyperbolic function 
is ( )

where D is the region bounded by the closed way C. Since f(z) fulfils the analyticity 
conditions everywhere within D, the integral vanishes. 
 
From here other theorems follow like for the complex analysis, e. g.: if f(z) is a 
hyperbolic analytic function in a domain D simply connected and z1 and z2 are two 
points on D then the definite integral: 
 
( )

between these points has a unique value independently of the integration path. 
Let us see an example. Consider the function f(z) = 1 / ( z − 1 ). The function is 
only defined if the inverse of z − 1 exists, which implies z − 1≠0. Of course, this 
function is not analytic at z = 1, but neither for the points: 
 
 
z − 12 = 0 ⇔ 
( x − 1)2 − y2 = 0 
⇔ 
( x + y − 1) ( x − y − 1) = 0 
 
The lines x + y = 1 and x − y = 1 break the analyticity domain into two sectors. Let us 
calculate the integral:

Analyticity and square of convergence of the power series 
 
 
A matrix function f(A) can be developed as a Taylor series of powers of the 
matrix A:

radius r of convergence of the complex series:

for 
 | z | < r 
 
which leads us to the following conditions: 
 
 
| x + y | < r 
and 
| x − y | < r 
 
Therefore, the region of convergence of a Taylor series of hyperbolic variable is a 
square centred at the origin of coordinates with vertices (r, 0)-(0, r)-(−r, 0)-(0, −r). Note 
that from both conditions we obtain:

which is a condition similar to that for complex numbers, that is, the modulus must be 
lower than the radius of convergence. However this condition is not enough to ensure 
the convergence of the series. Let us see, for example, the function f(z) = 1/(1 − z):

The radius of convergence of the complex series is r = 1, so that the square of the 
convergence of the hyperbolic series is (1, 0)-(0, 1)-(−1,0)-(0,−1). Otherwise, we have 
formerly seen that 1/(z −1) (and hence f(z) ) is not analytic at the lines x + y −1 = 0 and x 
− y − 1= 0 belonging to the boundary of the square of convergence. Now we find a 
phenomenon which also happens within the complex numbers: at some point on the 
boundary of the region of convergence of the Taylor series,  the function is not analytic. 
Another example is the Riemann’s function:

which is the positive half-sector beginning at (x, y) = (1, 0). You can see that it is an

These derivatives fulfil the analyticity condition provided that the derivatives of the real 
function at x + y and x − y exist. On the other hand, this expression is a method to get 
the analytical continuation of any real function. For example, let us construct the 
analytical continuation of f(x) = cos x :

The other consequence of this way of analytic continuation is the fact that if f(z) 
loses analyticity for the real value x0 then it is neither analytic at the lines with slope 1 
and −1 passing through (x0, 0). Since we have supposed that the function is analytic 
except for a certain real value, the former equality holds although the analyticity is lost 
at this point. But then the function cannot be analytic at (x0 + t,  − t ) nor (x0 − t,  t ) 
because:

For example, look at the function f(z) = 1/z, which is not analytic for the real value x = 
0. Then it will not be analytic at the lines y = x and y = −x. We can see it through the 
decomposition of the function:

Now we may return to the question of the convergence of the Taylor series. A 
function can be only developed in a power series in the neighbourhood of a point where 
it is analytic. The series is convergent till where the function breaks the analyticity, so 
that the lines y = x − x0 and y = −x + x0 (being x0 the real value for which f(x) is not 
analytic) are boundaries of the convergence domain. On the other hand, due to the 
symmetry of the powers of z, the convergence domain forms a square around the centre 
of development. This implies that there are not multiply connected domains. The 
Gruyère cheese picture of a complex domain is not possible within the hyperbolic 
numbers, because if the function is not analytic at a certain point, then it is not analytic 
for all the points lying on a cross which passes through this point. The hyperbolic 
domains are multiply separated, in other words, formed by disjoined rectangular regions 
without holes. 
 
 
 
About the isomorphism of Clifford algebras 
 
 
Until now, I have only used the geometric algebra generated by the Euclidean 
plane vectors (usually noted as Cl2,0(R)). This algebra already contains the hyperbolic 
numbers and hyperbolic vectors. However an isomorphic algebra Cl1,1(R) generated by 
hyperbolic vectors (time-space) is more used in relativity:

The isomorphism is:

Cl2,0(R)   ↔ Cl1,1(R)

   e01 
 
 
      e2    ↔ 
   e0 
 
 
    −e12    ↔ 
   e1 
 
A hyperbolic number has the expression z = x + y e01 and a hyperbolic vector v = v0 e0 + 
v1 e1. 
 
This description perhaps could be satisfactory for a mathematician or a physicist, 
but not for me. I think that in fact both algebras only differ in the notation but not in 
their nature, so that they are the same algebra. Moreover, they are equal to the matrix 
algebra, which is the expected algebra for a space of multiple quantities (usually said 
vectors). The plane geometric algebra is the algebra of the 2×2 real matrices5. 
 
 
Cl2,0(R) = Cl1,1(R) = M2×2(R) 
 
This distinct notation only expresses the fact that the plane geometric algebra is equally 
generated (in the Grassmann’s sense) by Euclidean vectors or hyperbolic vectors. The 
vector plane (Euclidean or hyperbolic) is the quotient space of the geometric algebra 
divided by an even subalgebra (complex or hyperbolic numbers). Just this is the matter 
of the next chapter.

In other words, their linear combinations are in the space, but the products are 
hyperbolic numbers. These elements play the same role as the Euclidean vectors with 
respect to the complex numbers. Because of this, they are called hyperbolic vectors. 
Like the hyperbolic numbers, the hyperbolic vectors have also a pseudo-Euclidean 
determinant:

As before, there is not any privileged direction in the plane. Then every subspace 
whose elements have the form: 
 
                                                            
1 Every Euclidean vector is obtained from e1 through a rotation and dilation given by the 
complex number with the same components: v1 e1 + v2 e2 = e1 (v1 + v2 e12 ) so that the complex 
and vector planes are equivalent. This statement also holds in hyperbolic geometry: every 
hyperbolic vector is obtained from e2 through a rotation and dilation given by the hyperbolic 
number with the same components: v2 e2 + v21 e21 = e2 (v2 + v21 e1 ) or in relativistic notation: v0 
e0 + v1 e1 = e0 (v0 + v1 e01 ) so that both hyperbolic planes are equivalent. That reader accustomed 
to the relativistic notation should remember the isomorphism: e0 ↔ e2 ,  e1 ↔ e21 ,  e01 ↔ e1 .

vw w + v21 e21 
 
where w is a unitary Euclidean vector perpendicular to the unitary Euclidean vector u, is 
also a subspace of hyperbolic vectors complementary of the hyperbolic numbers with 
the direction of u. 
The hyperbolic vectors have the following properties, which you may prove: 
1) The product of two hyperbolic vectors is always a hyperbolic number. This 
fact is shown by the following table, where the products of all the elements 
of the geometric algebra are summarised: 
 
× 
hyp. numbers 
hyp. vectors 
hyp. numbers 
hyp. numbers 
hyp. vectors 
hyp. vectors 
hyp. vectors 
hyp. numbers 
 
2) The conjugate of a product of two hyperbolic vectors x and y is equal to the 
product with these vectors exchanged: 
 
( x y )* = y x 
 
3) The product of three hyperbolic vectors x, y and z fulfils the permutative 
property: 
 
x y z = z y x 
 
When a hyperbolic number n and a hyperbolic vector x are exchanged, the 
hyperbolic number becomes conjugated according to the permutative 
property: 
n x = x n* 
 
4) The modulus of a product of hyperbolic vectors is equal to the product of 
moduli: 
 
w
v
w
v
=
 
 
 
This property follows immediately from the fact that the determinant of a 
product of matrices is equal to the product of determinants of each matrix.

When the last condition is fulfilled, we see both vectors being symmetric with respect to

quadrant bisectors), the vectors have null modulus and are self-orthogonal. For ratios 
differing from ±1, one vector has negative determinant and the other positive 
determinant, so that they belong to different sectors. That is, there is not any pair of 
orthogonal vectors within the same sector.

The parenthesis for π e12 indicates that this angle is added to the arctangent or not 
depending on the quadrant (Euclidean plane) or half sector (hyperbolic plane). 
Let us analyse whether these expressions are suitable. The hyperbolic cosine is 
always greater or equal to 1. It cannot describe the angle between two vectors belonging 
to opposite half sectors, which have a negative inner product. So we must keep the 
complex analytic continuation of the hyperbolic sine and cosine:

Therefore opposite hyperbolic vectors form a circular angle of π radians2. 
 
Let us consider the angle between vectors lying on different sectors. The 
modulus of one vector is real while that of the other is imaginary what implies that the 
hyperbolic sine and cosine of the angle are imaginary. Using again the complex analytic 
continuation of the hyperbolic sine and cosine we find these imaginary values:

Then, which is the angle between two orthogonal vectors? Since they have a null 
inner product while their outer product 
equals in real value the product of both 
moduli and the hyperbolic cosine is ±e12 , 
they form an angle of π e12 /2 or 3π e12 /2, 
that is, orthogonal hyperbolic vectors form a 
circular right angle:

The analytic continuations of the 
hyperbolic trigonometric functions must be 
consistent with their definitions given in the 
page 142. For example, in the lowest half 
                                                            
2 The so called “antimatter” is not really any special kind of particles, but matter with the 
energy-momentum vector (E, p) lying on the negative half sector instead of the positive one 
(usual matter). Also we may wonder whether matter having (E, p) on the imaginary sector exists 
since, from a geometric point of view, there is not any obstacle. It is known that the particle 
dynamics for c<V<∞ is completely symmetric to the dynamics for 0≤V<c, but with an 
imaginary mass. In this case, the head of the energy-momentum vector is always located on the 
hyperbola having the y-axis (p axis) as principal axis of symmetry. According to Einstein’s 
formula, for V = ∞ we have E = 0 and p = m c, that is, the particle has a null energy! The 
technical question is how can a particle trespass the light barrier?

sector, the modulus of the hyperbolic radius is imaginary. The abscissa x and ordinate y 
divided by r, the modulus of the radius vector, is also imaginary so the angle is a real 
quantity plus a right angle and the hyperbolic sine and cosine are exchanged. The values 
of the angles consistent with the analytic continuation are displayed in the figure 13.1. 
 
 
 
Congruence of segments and angles 
 
 
Two segments (vectors) are congruent (have equal length) if their determinants 
are equal, in other words, when one segment can be obtained from the other through an 
isometry. Segments having equal length always lie on the same sector. 
 
Two hyperbolic angles are said to be congruent (or equal) if they have the same 
moduli, that is, if they intercept arcs of hyperbola with the same hyperbolic length. 
 
A triangle is said to be isosceles if it has two congruent sides. In colloquial 
language we talk about “sides with equal length”, even “equal sides”. Let us see the 
isosceles triangle theorem: the angles adjacent to the base of an isosceles triangle are 
equal. The proof uses the outer product. The triangle area is the half of the outer product 
of any two sides, as proved below in the section on the area. Suppose that the sides a 
and b have the same modulus. Then:

Isometries 
 
 
In the Euclidean plane, an isometry is a geometric transformation that preserves 
the modulus of vectors and complex numbers. Now I give a more general definition: a 
geometric transformation is an isometry if it preserves the determinant of every element 
of the geometric algebra. In fact, the isometries are the inner automorphism of matrices: 
 
 
A' = B −1 A B  ⇒ 
det A' = det A 
 
When B represents a Euclidean vector, the 
isometry is a reflection in the direction of B. If 
a complex number of argument α is 
represented by B, the transformation is a 
rotation of angle 2α . 
We wish now to obtain the isometries 
for hyperbolic vectors. The hyperbolic rotation 
of a hyperbolic vector (figure 13.2) is obtained 
through the product by an exponential having 
unity determinant:

which is the Lorentz transformation3 of the relativity. When a vector is turned through a 
positive angle ψ, its extreme follows the hyperbola in the direction shown by the 
arrowheads in the figure 13.2, as is deduced from the components. So, they indicate the 
geometric positive sense of hyperbolic angles (a not trivial question). Since the points of 
intersections with the axis corresponds to ψ = 0 plus multiples of π e12 /2, the signs of 
the hyperbolic angles are determined: positive in the first and third quadrant, and 
negative in the second and fourth quadrant. 
We can also write the hyperbolic rotation as an inner automorphism of matrices 
by using the half argument identity for hyperbolic trigonometric functions:

If z = exp(e1ψ /2), then the rotation is written as: 
 
 
v' = z −1 v z 
 
Now it is not needed that z be unitary and can have any modulus. Also, we see that the 
hyperbolic rotation leaves the hyperbolic numbers invariant. 
 
Analogously to reflections in the Euclidean plane, the hyperbolic reflection of a 
hyperbolic vector v with respect to a direction given by the vector u is: 
 
v' = u −1 v u = u −1 ( v|| + v⊥) u = v|| − v⊥ 
 
because the proportional vectors commute and those which are orthogonal anticommute 
(also in the hyperbolic case, 
because the inner product is 
zero). Every pair of orthogonal 
directions (for example u|| and u⊥ 
in figure 13.3) are always seen 
by us as having symmetry with 
respect to the quadrant bisectors. 
Since 
the 
determinant 
is 
preserved, a vector and its 
reflection always belong to the 
same sector, the hyperbolic angle 
between each vector and the 
direction of reflection being 
equal with opposite sign.  
                                                            
3 The hyperbolic vector in the space-time is ct e0 + x e1 where x is the space coordinate, t the 
time and c the light celerity. The argument of the hyperbolic rotation ψ is related with the 
relative velocity V of both frames of reference through ψ = arg tgh V/c.  
Figure 13.3

Finally, note that the extremes of a vector and its transformed vector under a 
hyperbolic reflection (or any isometry) lie on an equilateral hyperbola. 
 
 
 
Theorems about angles 
    
 
 
The sum of the oriented angles of a hyperbolic triangle is minus two right 
circular angles. To prove this theorem, draw a line parallel to a side and apply  the Z-
theorem (figure 13.4): they will form 
an angle between opposite directions, 
which has the value −π e12. The minus 
sign is caused by the fact that, 
following the positive orientation of 
angles, a right angle is subtracted each 
time an asymptote is trespassed. 
 
Look at the figure 13.5 where 
an angle inscribed in an equilateral 
hyperbola is drawn. A diameter 
divides the inscribed angle into the 
angles α and β. Then we draw two 
radius from the origin to both extremes of the angle. All the radius have the same 
length, so that the upper and lowest triangle are isosceles and have two equal angles. 
Since the sum of the angles of each hyperbolic triangle is −π e12, the third angle is 
−π e12−2α  and −π e12−2β respectively. So the supplementary angles are 2α  and 2β , 
and hence the theorem follows: the 
inscribed angle on a hyperbola x2 − y2 = 
r2 is the half of the central angle 
(intercepted arc) so that it is constant 
and independent of the location of its 
vertex. 
 
For example, take the points (5, 
3) and (5, −3) as extremes of an 
inscribed angle with the vertex placed 
at the negative branch, for example at 
(−4, 0) or (−5, −3). Even you can take 
the vertex at the positive branch, e. g. at 
(4, 0). Anyway its value is log 2. Now 
calculate 
the 
central 
angle 
or 
intercepted arc (with vertex at the origin) and see that its value is log 4, twice the 
inscribed angle.  
 
 
 
Distance between points 
 
 
The distance between two points on the hyperbolic plane is defined as the

So the sum of two sides of a triangle is smaller than the third side whenever they are 
taken in the positive half sector. For example, let us apply this statement to the triangle 
with vertices A = (5, 3), B = (1, 0) and C = (10, 1). Taking the modulus of the sides 
positive, we have:

This result must be commented with more detail. Firstly, we see that the straight 
path has the highest length among the possible paths between two given points. In the 
Minkowski’s space-time this fact causes the twin paradox. Since the pseudo-Euclidean 
length of the path is the proper time for each person, the brother who followed the 
straight path -going in an inertial frame- has aged more than the brother who followed 
another path  -subjected to accelerations-. 
 
 
 
Area on the hyperbolic plane 
 
 
Now I give a general geometric definition of area valid for both Euclidean and 
hyperbolic planes. If a parallelogram has orthogonal sides, then the modulus of its area 
is equal to the product of the lengths of the orthogonal sides. In Euclidean geometry a 
parallelogram with orthogonal sides is called a rectangle. In the hyperbolic plane, two 
sides are orthogonal if their directions are seen by us as symmetric with respect to the 
direction of the quadrant bisector. So, I have preferred to avoid the word rectangle in 
this case, while the term parallelogram is still valid within this context. 

162 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
 
 
Which is the suitable algebraic expression to calculate the area of any 
parallelogram? Suppose that it is the outer product. If a and b are the sides of the 
parallelogram then:

Let us see the consistence of this expression. First at all, recall that the angle

For any parallelogram not having orthogonal sides, the area is the product of the 
base (one side) for the altitude (the projection of the other side onto the direction 
orthogonal to the base) and this product is only given by the outer product because its 
anticommutativity removes the proportional projection:

The expression for the area in Cartesian 
components is equal to that for the 
Euclidean plane. It means that we can 
calculate areas graphically in the usual way, 
fact that has allowed till now to define the 
hyperbolic trigonometric functions from the 
area scanned by the hyperbola radius in the 
Euclidean plane, in spite of not being their 
proper plane. However, as I have explained 
in the footnote at the page 142, we must 
perceive the pseudo-Euclidean nature of the 
area in the hyperbolic plane. The figure 13.6 
displays how are the radii perpendicular to the hyperbola because the bisector of the 
radius and the tangent vector is parallel to the quadrant bisector. Also it may be proved 
analytically by means of differentiation of the equation x2 − y2  = r2:

showing that the radius vector and its differential are orthogonal for the hyperbola with 
constant radius. On the other hand, observe that the triangles drawn in the figure 13.6 
are isosceles and have two equal angles approaching the right angle value at the limit of 
null area.

Diameters of the hyperbola and Apollonius’ theorem 
 
At the page 129, I postponed an interpretation of the central equation for the 
hyperbola analogous to the cylindrical angles for the ellipse because it is properly of 
pseudo-Euclidean nature. Here I develop this interpretation. 
If P is any point on a hyperbola with major and minor half-axis OQ and OS 
(figure 11.17 reproduced below) then its central equation is:

Observe in the figure 13.7 that

The Apollonius’ conjugate diameters of any hyperbola are the intersections of 
the transverse plane with a pair of orthogonal axial planes; in other words, two radii are

the same hyperbolic angle ϕ :

Our Euclidean eyes see the horizontal projections as symmetric lines with respect to the 
quadrant bisector. However, they are actually orthogonal because: 
 
 
OQ' 2 − OS' 2 = OQ2 − OS2 
 
and, therefore, can be taken as a new system of orthogonal coordinates. Even we can 
draw a new picture with the new diameters on the Cartesian axis.

The law of sines and cosines 
 
Since the modulus of the area is identical on the Euclidean and hyperbolic 
planes, a parallelogram is divided by its diagonal in two triangles of equal area. This 
statement is somewhat subtle since the Euclidean congruence of triangles is not valid in 
the hyperbolic plane. I shall return to this question later. Now we only need to know 
that the area of a hyperbolic triangle is the half of the outer product of any two sides. 
Following the perimeter of a triangle, let a, b, and c be its sides respectively 
opposite to the angles α, β and γ. Then the angles formed by the oriented sides are 
supplementary of the angles of the triangle and:

Observe that the addition of the three angles is −π e12, as expected. According to the 
definition α = BAC, β = CBA, γ = ACB, let you see the consistence with the geometric 
plot. The angle γ has positive sign as shown by the figure 13.9. The bisector of α 
parallel to the quadrant bisector divides it in two angles, one real and the other complex 
(with imaginary part π e12 /2). The algebraic addition of both angles is α.. Taking into 
account that the second has opposite orientation and must be subtracted and 
predominates over the first, the negative value of α is explained. 
 
 
 
Hyperbolic similarity 
 
 
Two triangles ABC and A'B'C' are said to be directly similar4 and their vertices 
and sides denoted with the same letters are homologous if: 
 
 
 
AB BC −1 = A'B' B'C' −1 
⇒ 
AB−1 A'B' = BC −1 B'C' 
 
 
One can prove easily that the third quotient of homologous sides also coincides 
with the other quotients: 
 
 
AB−1 A'B' = BC −1 B'C' = CA−1 C'A' = r 
 
 
The similarity ratio r is defined as the quotient of every pair of homologous 
sides, which is a hyperbolic number. The modulus of the similarity ratio is the size ratio 
and the argument is the angle of rotation of the triangle A'B'C' with respect to the 
triangle ABC.

The definition of similarity is generalised to any pair of polygons in the 
following way. The polygons ABC...Z and A'B'C'...Z' are said to be directly similar with 
similarity ratio r and the sides denoted with the same letters to be homologous if: 
 
r = AB −1 A'B' = BC −1 B'C' = CD −1 C'D' = ... = YZ −1 Y'Z' = ZA −1 Z'A' 
 
 
Here also, the modulus of r is the size ratio of both polygons and the argument is 
the angle of rotation. The fact that the homologous exterior and interior angles are equal 
for directly similar polygons is trivial because: 
 
B'A' B'C'  −1 = BA BC −1 
⇒ 
angle  A'B'C'  = angle  ABC 
 
C'B' C'D' −1 = CB CD −1 
⇒ 
angle  B'C'D' = angle  BCD    etc. 
                                                            
4 A direct similarity is also called a similitude and an opposite similarity sometimes an 
antisimilitude. 
 

168 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
 
 
 
The direct similarity is an equivalence relation since it has the reflexive, 
symmetric and transitive properties. This means that there are classes of equivalence 
with directly similar figures. 
 
A similitude with r=1 is a displacement, since both polygons have the same 
size and orientation. 
 
Two triangles ABC and A'B'C' are oppositely similar and the sides denoted with 
the same letters are homologous if: 
 
AB BC −1 = ( A'B' B'C' −1 )* = B'C' −1 A'B' 
 
where the asterisk denotes the hyperbolic conjugate. The former equality cannot be 
arranged into quotients of pairs of homologous sides as done before. Because of this, 
the similarity ratio cannot be defined for the opposite similarity but only the size ratio, 
which is the quotient of the lengths of any two homologous sides. An opposite 
similarity is always the composition of a reflection in any line and a direct similarity. 
 
 
AB BC −1 = v −1 A'B' B'C' −1 v   ⇔ 
BC −1 v −1 B'C' = AB −1 v −1 A'B' 
  ⇔ 
 
 
BC −1 ( v −1 B'C' v ) = AB −1 ( v −1 A'B' −1 v ) = r 
 
where r is the ratio of a direct similarity whose argument is not defined but depends on 
the direction vector v of the reflection axis. Notwithstanding, this expression allows to 
define the opposite similarity of two polygons. So two polygons ABC...Z and A'B'C'...Z' 
are oppositely similar and the sides denoted with the same letters are homologous if for 
any hyperbolic vector v the following equalities are fulfilled: 
 
 
 AB −1 ( v −1 A'B'  −1 v ) =  BC  −1 ( v −1 B'C' v ) = .... =  ZA −1 ( v −1 Z'A' v )  
 
that is, if after a reflection one polygon is directly similar to the other. The opposite 
similarity is not reflexive nor transitive and there are not classes of oppositely similar 
figures. 
 
An opposite similarity with r=1 is called a reversal, since both polygons have 
the same size but opposite orientations. 
 
Obviously the plot of similar figures on the hyperbolic plane breaks our 
Euclidean intuition about figures with the same form. The algebraic definition is very 
rigorous and clear, but we must change our visual illusions. So I recommend the 
exercise 13.6. 
 
This chapter is necessarily unfinished because the geometry of the hyperbolic 
plane can be developed and studied with the same extension and profundity as for the 
Euclidean plane. Then, it is obvious that many theorems should follow in the same way 
as Euclidean geometry. As a last example I will define the power of a point with respect 
to a hyperbola. 
 
 
 
Power of a point with respect to a hyperbola with constant radius  
 
 
The locus of the points placed at a fixed distance r from a given point O is an 
equilateral hyperbola centred at this point with equation:

The power of a point with respect to this 
hyperbola is the product of both oriented 
distances from P to the intersections R and R' 
of a line passing through P with the hyperbola. 
The power of a point is constant for every line 
of the pencil of lines of P. In the proof the 
inscribed angle theorem is used (figure 13.10): 
the angles S'RR' and S'SR' are equal so the 
triangles SPR' and RPS' are oppositely similar.

Exercises 
 
13.1 Let A = (2, 2), B = (1, 0) and C = (5, 3) be the vertices of a hyperbolic triangle. 
Calculate all the sides and angles and also the area. 
 
13.2 Turn the vector 2 e2 + e21 through an angle ψ = log 2. Do a reflection in the 
direction 3 e2 − e21 . Make also an inversion with radius 3. 
 
13.3 Find the direction and normal vectors of the line y = 2 x + 1 and calculate the 
perpendicular line passing through the point (3, 1).  
 
13.4 Calculate the power of the point P = (−7, 3) with respect to the hyperbola x2 − y2 = 
16 using the intersections of the lines y = 3, y = −3x −18 and that passing through the 
centre of the hyperbola y = −3x / 7. See that in all cases the power of P is equal to the 
value found by substitution in the Cartesian equation. 
 
13.5 In this chapter I have deduced the law of sines and cosines. Therefore a law of 
tangents should be expected. Find and prove it. 
 
13.6 Check that the triangle A = (0, 0), B = (5, 0) and C = (5, 3) is directly similar to the 
triangle A' = (0, 0), B' = (25, −15), C' = (16, 0). Find the similarity ratio and the rotation 
and dilation of the corresponding homothety. Draw the triangles and you will astonish.

FOURTH PART: PLANE PROJECTIONS OF TRIDIMENSIONAL SPACES 
 
The complete study of the geometric algebra of the tridimensional spaces falls 
out the scope of this book. However, due to the importance of the Earth charts and of 
the Lobachevsky’s geometry, the first one being more practical and the second one 
more theoretical, I have written this last section. In order to make the explanations 
clearer, the tridimensional geometric algebra has been reduced to the minimal concepts, 
enhancing the plane projections.  
The geometric quality of being Euclidean or pseudo-Euclidean is not the 
signature + or − of a coordinate, but the fact that two coordinates have the same or 
different signature, in other words, it is a characteristic of a plane. For instance, a plane 
with signatures + + is equivalent, from a geometric point of view, to another with − − . 
Therefore, only two kinds of three-dimensional spaces exist: the room space where all 
the planes are Euclidean (signatures + + + or − − −), and the pseudo-Euclidean space, 
which has one Euclidean plane and two orthogonal pseudo-Euclidean planes (signatures 
+ − − or + + − ). 
 
 
14. SPHERICAL GEOMETRY IN THE EUCLIDEAN SPACE 
 
 
The geometric algebra of the Euclidean space 
 
 
A vector of the Euclidean space is an oriented segment in this space with 
direction and sense, although it can represent other physical magnitudes such as forces, 
velocities, etc. The set of all the segments (geometric vectors) together with their 
addition (parallelogram rule) and the product by real numbers (dilation of vectors) has a 
structure of vector space, symbolised with V3. Every vector in V3 is of the form:

where ei are three unitary perpendicular vectors, which form the base of the space. If we 
define an associative product (geometric or Clifford product) being a generalisation of 
that defined for the plane in the first chapter of this book, we will arrive to:

In general, the square of a vector is the square of its modulus and perpendicular vectors 
anticommute whereas proportional vectors commute. 
From the base vectors one deduces that the geometric algebra generated by the 
space V3 has eight components:

The product (or quotient) of two vectors is said a quaternion1. The quaternions are the 
even subalgebra of Cl3, 0 that generalise the complex numbers to the space. Splitting a 
quaternion in the real and bivector parts, we obtain the inner (or scalar) product and the 
outer (or exterior) product respectively:

The bivectors are oriented plane surfaces and indicate the direction of planes in the 
space. Who be acquainted with the vector analysis will say that both vectors and 
bivectors are the same thing. This confusion was originated by Hamilton2 himself, and 
continued by the founders of vector analysis, Gibbs and Heaviside. However, vectors 
and bivectors are different things just as physicists have experienced and know long 
time ago. The proper vectors are called usually “polar vectors” while the pseudo-vectors 
that actually are bivectors are usually called “axial vectors”. The following magnitudes 
are vectors: of course a geometric segment, but also a velocity, an electric field, the 
momentum, etc. On the other hand, the oriented area is, of course, a bivector, but also 
the angular momentum, the angular velocity and the magnetic field. As a criterion to 
distinguish both kind of magnitudes one uses the reversal of coordinates, which changes 
the sense of vectors while leaves bivectors invariant. 
 
The product of two bivectors yields a real number plus a bivector. Both parts can 
be separated as the symmetric and antisymmetric product. The symmetric product is a 
real number and its negative value will be denoted here with the symbol • while the 
antisymmetric product is also a bivector and will be noted here with the symbol × :

Let us see what happens with the outer product of three vectors. According to 
the extension theory of Grassmann, the product u ∧ v ∧ w is the oriented volume 
generated by the surface represented by the bivector u ∧ v when it is translated 
parallelly along the segment w:  
                                                 
1 Hamilton discovered the quaternions in October 16th 1843 and defined them as quotients of 
two vectors. From this definition he deduced the properties of the product of quaternions. I 
recommend you the reading of the initial chapters of the Elements of Quaternions because of its 
pedagogic importance.   
2 This confusion is due to the fact that vectors and bivectors are dual spaces of the algebra Cl3, 0. 
However, this duality does not exist at higher dimensions, although there is also duality among 
other spaces.

Finally, let us see how is the product of three vectors u, v and w. The vector v

I take the same algebraic hierarchies as in chapter 1: all the abridged products 
must be operated before the geometric product, convention which is coherent with the 
fact that in many algebraic situations, the abridged products must be developed in sums 
of geometric products. 
  
 
 
Spherical trigonometry 
 
 
In this section the relations for the sides and angles of the spherical triangles are 
deduced. I will take for convenience the sphere having unity radius, although the 
trigonometric identities are equally valid for a sphere of any radius. 
 
Let us consider any three points A, 
B and C on the sphere with unity radius 
centred at the origin (figure 14.1). Then 
1

. The angles formed by 
each pair of sides will be denoted by α, β 
and γ, and the sides respectively opposite 
to these angles will be symbolised by a, b 
and c respectively. Then a is the arc of the 
great circle passing through the points B 
and C, that is, the angle between these 
vectors: 
 
 
C

a
∧
=
sin
 
                                                 
3 From this result it follows that u ∧ v ∧ w = (u v w − u w v + v w u − v u w + w u v − w v u) / 6 . 
In other words, the outer product is a fully antisymmetric product. However although being 
beautiful, it is not so useful for geometric algebra as the permutative property u ∧ v ∧ w = (u v w 
− w v u)/2.

Note that in this equality the sine is positive and therefore a≤π. So, the spherical 
trigonometry is deduced for strict triangles, those having a, b, c≤π.  
Also, α is the angle between the sides b and c of the triangle, that is, the angle 
between the planes passing through the origin, A and B, and the origin, A and C. Since 
the direction of a plane is given by its bivector, which can be obtained through the outer 
product, we have:

The dual spherical triangle 
 
 
The perpendicular to the plane containing each side of a spherical triangle cuts 
the spherical surface in a point. The three points A', B' and C' obtained in this geometric 
way form the dual triangle. The algebraic way to calculate them is the duality operation, 
which maps bivectors into the perpendicular vectors. The dual of any element is 
obtained as the product by the pseudoscalar unity −e123, which commutes with all the 
elements of the algebra:

Right spherical triangles and Napier’s rule 
 
 
For the case of a right angle spherical triangle, the five Bessel’s formulas are 
reduced to a simpler form, and then they may be remembered with the help of the 
Napier’s pentagon rule (figure 14.2). Draw the angles and the sides of the triangle 
following the order of the 
perimeter removing the right 
angle and writing instead of 
the legs (the sides adjacent to 
the 
right 
angle) 
the 
complementary arcs. Then 
follow the Pentagon rules: 
1) The 
cosine 
of 
every 
element is equal to the 
product of the cotangents 
of the adjacent elements. 
2) The 
cosine 
of 
every 
element is equal to the product of the sines of the nonadjacent elements. 
For example:

write the complementary of  the adjacent angles. 
 
 
 
Area of a spherical triangle 
 
 
A lune is a two-sided polygon on the sphere defined by two great circles. The 
area of a lune is proportional to the angle α 
between both great circles. For an angle π/2 
its area is π, therefore the area of a lune with 
angle α is 2α. Now let us consider in the 
sphere shown by figure 14.3 the three lunes 
having the angles α, β and γ: Then:

Properties of the projections of the spherical surface 
 
 
No chart of the spherical surface preserving the scale of distances everywhere 
exists, that is, we cannot depict any map with distances proportional to those measured 
on the sphere. The distortion is the variation of the scale and the angles. Usually there is 
a line of zero distortion, where the scale is constant. 
Since the scale of distances is never preserved for all the points, projections with 
other interesting properties have been searched in cartography. A projection is said to be 
conformal if it preserves in the map the angles between great circles on the sphere. A 
projection is said to be equivalent if it preserves the area, that is if the figures on the 
sphere are projected into figures on the map having the same area. A projection is said 
to be equidistant if the scale of distances is preserved, not everywhere but on the line 
perpendicular to the line of zero distortion, or radially outwards from a point of zero 
distortion. 
The more general concept of projection is any one-to-one mapping of any point 
(x, y, z) on the sphere into a point (u, v) on the plane, although the main types of 
projections are azimuthal, cylindrical and conic. An azimuthal projection is a standard 
projection into a plane, which may be considered touching the sphere. In the tangency 
point there is zero distortion and the bearings or azimuths from this point are correctly 
shown. A cylindrical projection is a projection into a cylindrical surface around the 
sphere that will be unrolled. A conic projection is a projection into a conical surface 
tangent to the sphere that will also be unrolled.      
 Now, I review the main and more used projections beginning with the azimuthal 
projections.  
 
 
 
The central or gnomonic projection 
 
 
Let us consider the sphere with unity radius (figure 14.4) centred at the origin. 
Any point on the sphere has the coordinates (x, y, z) fulfilling: 
 

178 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 
 
Every point on the upper 
hemisphere is projected into 
another point on the plane z = 1 
using as centre of projection the 
centre of the sphere. Let u and v 
be the Cartesian coordinates on 
the projection plane. Taking 
similar triangles the following 
relations are found:

The geodesics of the sphere are the great circles, which are the intersections with planes 
passing through its centre. These planes cut the projection plane in straight lines, which 
are the projections of the geodesics. In other words, any great circle is projected into a 
line on the projection plane. Taking as equation of the line:

The arc length between two points on this great circle is the difference of this 
primitive between both points. However it is more advantageous to write it using 
cosines instead of tangents by means of the trigonometric identity:

a trivial result because the arc length is the angle between the position vectors of both 
points, and also of the proportional vectors going to the projection plane. However, the 
interest of this result is its analogy with the result found for the hyperboloidal surface. 
From this value of the cosine, we may obtain the sine of the arc:

which is also a trivial result, since the sine of the angle is proportional to the modulus of 
the outer product. 
 
Let us see the area function. The differential of the area is easily obtained taking 
into account that it is a bivector and using the outer product of the differentials of the 
coordinates:

This result shows that the central projection is not equivalent and the distortion 
increases with the distance to the origin. 
 
Let us consider a plane passing through the centre of the sphere, which cuts its 
surface in the great circle determined by the equation system:

The sides of a spherical triangle are great circles; therefore the central projection 
of a spherical triangle is a triangle whose sides are straight lines. 
 
 
 
Stereographic projection 
 
In the stereographic projection the point of view is placed on the spherical 
surface. As before, every point (x, y, z) on the sphere with unity radius centred at the 
origin fulfils the equation: 
 
1
2
2
2
=
+
+
z
y
x
  
 
We project the spherical surface into 
the plane z = 0 locating the centre of 
projection at the pole (0, 0, −1) (figure 
14.5). 
The 
upper 
hemisphere 
is 
projected inside the circle of unity 
radius while the lowest hemisphere is 
projected outside. If u and v are the 
Cartesian coordinates on the projection 
plane, we have by similar triangles: 
 
        
1
+
= z
u
x

= z

Using the equation of the sphere one arrives to:

Now we see that this projection is not equidistant and the distortion increases with the 
distance to the origin. The factor 4 indicates that the lengths at the origin of coordinates 
on the plane are the half of the lengths on the sphere. Taking instead of the plane z = 0, 
the plane z = 1 this factor becomes 1. Then, we can state correctly the scale of the chart 
(for example, a polar chart). 
The geodesic lines (great circles) are intersection of the sphere surface with 
planes passing through the origin, which have the equation:

this radius is the hypotenuse of a right angle

on the sphere are shown in the stereographic 
projection as circles that intersect the circle x2 + 
y2 =1 in extremes of diameters (figure 14.6). 
Usually only the projection of the upper 
hemisphere is used, so that the great circles are represented as circle arcs inside the 
circle

Just this is the angle between the planes a x + b y – z = 0 and a' x + b' y – z = 0, that is, 
the angle between the two great circles represented by the projected circles. Therefore, 
the stereographic projection is a conformal projection of the spherical surface.

Now we see that this projection is not equivalent since distortion of areas increases with 
the distance from the origin (as commented above, the factor 4 becomes 1 projecting 
into the plane z =1). 
 
 
 
Orthographic projection 
 
 
The orthographic projection of the sphere is a parallel projection (the point of 
view is placed at the infinity). If we make a projection parallel to the z-axis upon the 
plane z = 0, the Cartesian coordinates on the map are identical to x, y and we have:

Note that 
θe  and 
ϕe are orthogonal vectors, since their inner product is zero. At θ = 0, 
ds depends only on dθ  and there is a pole. Then θ is the arc length from the pole to the 
given point (figure 14.7), while ϕ is the arc length over the equator (θ = π/2, sinθ = 1). 
The meridians (ϕ = constant) are geodesics, but the parallels (θ = constant) are not. 
Exceptionally, the equator is also a geodesic. 
 
In the Plate Carrée projection u = ϕ and

meridians and parallels are shown in a squared graticule. This projection is equidistant  
for any meridian whereas the distortion in the parallels increases, as well as for every 
cylindrical projection, as we separate from the equator. Let us see the area:

The ratio of the real area with respect to the represented area on the chart is equal to the 
cosine of the latitude and therefore the projection is not equivalent. 
 
 
Mercator's projection 
 
The Mercator's projection5 is defined as the cylindrical conformal projection. If 
we wish to preserve the angles between curves, we must enlarge the meridians by the 
same amount as the parallels are enlarged in a cylindrical projection, that is, by the 
factor 1/sin θ (the secant of the geographical latitude):

5 The difference between the U.T.M. (Universal Transverse Mercator) projection and the 
Mercator planisphere is not geometric but geographic: in the U.T.M. the cylinder of projection 
is tangent to a meridian instead of the equator. All the Earth has been divided in zones of 6º of 
longitude, where the cylinder of projection is tangent to the central meridian (3º, 9º, 15º ... ).

Peters’ projection 
 
The Peters’ projection is the cylindrical equivalent projection. If we wish to 
preserve area, we must shorten the meridians in the same amount as the parallels are 
enlarged in the cylindrical projection, what

which displays clearly the equivalence of the

(figure 14.8). 
 
 
 
Conic projections 
 
 
These projections are made into a cone surface tangent to the sphere (figure 
14.9). Because the cone surface unrolled is a plane circular sector, they are often used to 
display middle latitudes, while the azimuthal projections are mainly used for poles. In a 
conic projection a small circle (a parallel) is shown as a circle with zero distortion. The 
characteristic parameter of a conic projection is the constant of the cone n = cos θ0, 
being θ0 the angle of inclination of the generatrix of the cone and also the angle from 
the axis of the cone to any point of tangency with the sphere. Since the graticule of the 
conic projections is radial, to use the radius r and the angle χ  is more convenient:

14.1 We have seen the gnomonic projection of great circles being always straight lines. 
Then, why does the shadow of a gnomon of a sundial follow a hyperbola on a plane 
surface instead of a line during a day? Why does this hyperbola become a straight line 
the March 21 and September 23? 
 
14.2 Three points on the sphere are projected by means of the stereographic projection 
into a circle of unity radius with the coordinates A = (−0.5, 0.5), B = (0, −2/3) and C = 
(2/3, 0). Calculate the sides, angles and area of the triangle which they form.

with bearing New York the 11th April. Calculate the length of the shortest trajectory 
from Fastnet (Ireland) at 51º30’N 9º35’W to Sandy Hook (New York) at 40º30’N 
74ºW. From January 15th to July 15th the ships had to follow the orthodrome (great 
circle) from Fastnet to the point 42º30’N 47ºW and from this point to Sandy Hook 
passing at twenty miles from the floating lighthouse of Nantucket. Calculate the length 
of the route the Titanic should have followed. Take as an averaged radius of the Earth 
6366 km. The Titanic sank the 15th April at the position 41º46’N 50º14’W. Is this point 
on the obliged track? 
 
   
14.4 The figure 14.11 is a photograph of the Hale-Bopp comet. The orientation of the 
camera is unknown, but the W of Cassiopeia constellation appears in the photograph. 
The declination D of a star is the angular distance from the celestial equator to the star 
(measured on the great circle passing through the celestial pole and the star). The right 
ascension A is the arc of celestial equator measured eastward from the vernal equinox 
(one of the intersections of the celestial equator with the ecliptic, also called Aries 
point) to the foot of the great circle passing through the star and the pole. The right 
ascension and declination of the stars are constant while those of the comets, planets, 
the Sun and the Moon are variable. The data of Cassiopeia constellation are:

15. HYPERBOLOIDAL GEOMETRY IN THE PSEUDO-EUCLIDEAN SPACE 
(LOBACHEVSKY’S GEOMETRY) 
 
 
The geometric algebra of the pseudo-Euclidean space 
 
 
A vector of the pseudo-Euclidean space is an oriented segment in this space with 
direction and sense. The set of all segments (vectors) together with their addition 
(parallelogram rule) and the product by real numbers (dilation of vectors) has a structure 
of vector space, symbolised here with W3. Every vector in W3 is of the form:

where ei are three unitary perpendicular vectors, which constitute the base of the space.

It determines the geometric properties of the space, very different from the Euclidean 
space. Now we define an associative product (geometric or Clifford product) being a 
generalisation of those defined for the Euclidean and hyperbolic planes. Imposing the 
condition that the square of the modulus be equal to the square of the vector, we find:

I shall call the product (or quotient) of two vectors a tetranion. The tetranions are the 
even subalgebra of Cl1, 2 that generalises the complex and hyperbolic numbers to the 
pseudo-Euclidean space. Splitting a tetranion in the real and bivector parts, we obtain 
the inner (or scalar) product and the outer (or exterior) product respectively:

Here also, the bivectors are oriented plane surfaces indicating the direction of planes in 
the pseudo-Euclidean space. As before, vectors and bivectors are different things. This 
fact has been experienced also by physicists: in the Minkowski’s space, the 
electromagnetic field is a bivector while the tetrapotential is a vector. On the other hand, 
the oriented area is, of course, a bivector. As a criterion to distinguish both kind of 
magnitudes one also uses the reversal of coordinates, which changes the sense of 
vectors while leaves bivectors invariant. 
 
Two vectors are said to be orthogonal if their inner product vanishes: 
 
 
0
·
=
⇔
⊥
w
v
w
v
 
 
So the outer product is the product by the orthogonal component and the inner product 
is the product by the proportional component:

The product of two bivectors yields a tetranion. The real and bivector parts can 
be separated as the symmetric and antisymmetric product. Since:

also a bivector:

The outer product of three vectors has the same expression as for Euclidean 
geometry and this is a natural outcome of the extension theory: the product u ∧ v ∧ w is 
the oriented volume generated by the surface represented by the bivector u ∧ v when it 
is translated parallelly along the segment w:

I take the same algebraic hierarchies as in the former chapter: all the abridged 
products must be operated before the geometric product, convention adequate to the fact 
that in many algebraic situations, the abridged products must be developed in sums of 
geometric products. 
 
 
 
The hyperboloid of two sheets 
 
 
According to Hilbert (Grundlagen der Geometrie, Anhang V) the complete 
Lobachevsky’s “plane” cannot be represented by a smooth surface with constant 
curvature as proposed by Beltrami. But this 
result only concerns surfaces in the Euclidean 
space. The surface whose points are placed at a 
fixed distance from the origin in a pseudo-
Euclidean space (the two-sheeted hyperboloid) is 
the surface searched by Hilbert which realises 
the Lobachevsky’s geometry1. It is known that it 
has a characteristic distance like the radius of the 
sphere. Since all the spheres are similar, we need 
only study the unitary sphere. Likewise, all the 
hyperboloidal surfaces z2−x2−y2 = r2 are similar 
and the hyperboloid with unity radius (figure 
15.1):

where (x, y, z) are Cartesian although not Euclidean2 coordinates, suffices to study the 
whole Lobachesky’s geometry. 
                                                            
1 The reader will find a complete study of the hyperboloidal surface in Faber, Foundations of 
Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry, chap. VII. “The Weierstrass model”. 
2 For me, Cartesian coordinates are orthogonal coordinates in a flat space (with null curvature), 
independently of the Euclidean or pseudo-Euclidean nature of the space. Lines and planes 
(linear relations between Cartesian coordinates) can always be drawn in both spaces, although 
the pseudo-Euclidean orthogonality is not shown as a right angle, and the pseudo-Euclidean 
distance is not the viewed length. The incompleteness of Cartesian coordinates was already 
criticised by Leibniz in a letter to Huygens in 1679 proposing a new geometric calculus: «Car 
premierement je puis exprimer parfaitement par ce calcul toute la nature ou définition de la 
figure (ce que l’algèbre ne fait jamais, car disant que x2 + y2 aeq. a2 est l’equation du cercle, il

The fact that the hyperboloidal surface owns the Lobachevsky’s geometry will 
be evident through the different projections here reviewed. If we followed the same 
order as in the former chapter, we should firstly deal with the Lobachevskian 
trigonometry. However, the concept of arc length on the hyperboloid is much less 
intuitive than on the sphere. Therefore we must see the concept and determination of the 
arc length before studying the hyperboloidal trigonometry. 
 
 
The central projection (Beltrami disk) 
 
 
In this projection the centre of the hyperboloid is the centre of projection. Thus, 
we project every point on the upper sheet of the hyperboloid z2−x2−y2 = 1 into another 
point on the plane z = 1 taking the origin x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 as centre of projection 
(figure 15.1). Let u and v be Cartesian coordinates on the plane z =1, which touches the 
hyperboloid in the vertex. By similar triangles3:

which is the negative value of the usual metric of the Lobachevsky’s surface in the

 into the plane z = 1 we find the same metric but

Applications in Mathematical Physics). 
3 Now to consider that the legs of both right angle triangles are horizontal and vertical, and 
therefore perpendicular is enough for the deduction. Notwithstanding, in a pseudo-Euclidean 
space one must use the algebraic definition of similitude: a triangle with sides a and b is directly 
similar to a triangle with sides c and d if and only if a c −1 = b d −1. This condition implies that 
both quotients of the modulus are equal and both arguments also.

Observe that t and ds have imaginary components since a plane only cuts the two-

components, although then its modulus is −1.  
The derivative of the tangent vector with respect to the arc length is not only 
proportional but equal to the normal vector n of the hyperbola:

because the position vector of every point on the two sheet hyperboloid has unitary 
modulus. Hence the curvature κ of the hyperbola is constant and equal to 1. All the 
hyperbolas being intersections of the hyperboloid with planes passing through the origin 
and a given point on the hyperboloid have the same radius of curvature r:

Two consequences are deduced from this fact: firstly their common radius of curvature 
is perpendicular to the surface, and secondly, these hyperbolas are geodesics of the 
hyperboloid. Because all the hyperbolas lie on planes passing through the origin, their 
central projections are straight lines. In other words, every geodesic hyperbola is 
projected into a segment on the Beltrami disk. Taking as equation of the line:

4 As said before, the arc length s on the two-sheeted hyperboloid has imaginary values. I’m 
sorry by the inconvenience of that reader accustomed to take real values. However the 
coherence of all the geometric algebra force to take account of the imaginary unity e123. This 
also explains why Lobachevsky found the hyperboloidal trigonometry by choosing imaginary 
values for the sides in the spherical trigonometry.

A hyperboloidal triangle is the region of the hyperboloid bounded by three

of the arc length of the hyperbola according to the last result. On the other hand, the 
angle of a vertex of a hyperboloidal triangle is the angle between the tangent vectors of 
the hyperbolas of each side at the vertex:

Note that every pair of tangent vectors lie on a plane of Euclidean nature, a plane 
parallel to a central plane not cutting the cone of zero length. So the angles measured on 
this plane are circular. We arrive at the same conclusion by proving that the absolute 
value of the cosine (and also its square) is lesser than the unity:

Just this is the condition for the existence of the intersection point where two central

the Beltrami disk. Then the point of intersection of both planes and the hyperboloidal

It is not a surprising result, because it happens likewise for the sphere: the angle 
between two maximum circles is the angle between the central planes containing them. 
The planes passing through the origin only cut the two-sheeted hyperboloid if a2 
+ b2 >1. These planes also cut the cone of zero length z2 − x2 − y2 = 0 so they are 
hyperbolic and the angles measured on them are hyperbolic arguments. On the other 
hand, the planes with a2 + b2 <1 do not cut the hyperboloid neither the cone and have 
Euclidean nature. In the Lobachevskian trigonometry, the planes containing the sides of 
a hyperboloidal triangle are always hyperbolic, while the planes touching the 
hyperboloid and containing the angles between sides  are always Euclidean, and hence 
the angles are circular. Resuming, real modulus of a bivector (0<−a2 −b2 +1) indicates 
an Euclidean plane and imaginary modulus (0>−a2 −b2 +1) a hyperbolic plane. 
 
Now we already have all the formulas to deduce the hyperboloidal trigonometry. 
 
 
Hyperboloidal (Lobachevskian) trigonometry 
 
 
The Lobachevskian trigonometry is the study of the trigonometric relations for 
the sides and angles of geodesic triangles on two-sheeted hyperboloids in the pseudo-
Euclidean space. We will take for 
convenience the hyperboloid with 
unity 
radius

although the trigonometric identities 
are equally valid for a hyperboloid 
with any radius.  
 
Consider three points A, B and 
C on the unitary hyperboloid (figure 
15.3). Then

. The 
angles formed by each pair of sides 
will be denoted by α, β and γ, and the 
real value of the sides respectively 
opposite to these angles will be 
symbolised by a, b and c respectively. 
Then a is the real value of the arc of 
the 
geodesic 
hyperbola 
passing 
through the points B and C, that is, the hyperbolic angle between these vectors:

As said above, the planes intersecting the hyperboloid have imaginary modulus. So we 
must divide by the pseudoscalar imaginary unity, which is also the volume element. In 
this equality the hyperbolic sine is taken positive and also a. 
α is the circular angle between the sides b and c of the triangle, that is, the angle 
between the planes passing through the origin, A and B, and the origin, A and C 
respectively. Since the direction of a plane is given by its bivector, which can be 
obtained through the outer product, we have:

Stereographic projection (Poincaré disk) 
 
We project the hyperboloidal surface into the 
plane z = 0 (figure 15.4) taking as centre of 
projection the lower pole (0, 0, −1). The upper sheet 
is projected inside the circle of unity radius while the 
lower sheet is projected outside. Let u and v be the

When doing an inversion of the 
Poincaré disk centred at a point lying on 
the limit circle, another projection of the 
Lobachevsky's geometry is obtained: the 
Poincaré’s half plane. Here the geodesics 
are semicircles orthogonal to the base line 
of the half plane. Since the inversion is a 
conformal transformation, the upper half 
plane is also a conformal projection of the 
hyperboloid. The figure 15.6 displays the 
projection of a hyperboloidal triangle and 
its sides in the Poincaré’s upper half plane. 
 
 
 
Azimuthal equivalent projection 
 
 
This projection preserves the area and is similar to the azimuthal equivalent 
projection of the sphere usually used in the polar maps of the Earth. 
 
The differential of the area in the pseudo-Euclidean space is a bivector whose 
square is:

These are a set of coordinates similar to

Note that 
ψe  and 
ϕe are orthogonal vectors, since their inner product is zero. At ψ = 0, 
ds only depends on dψ , so that there is a pole. Then ψ is the arc length from the pole to 
the given point on the hyperboloid surface (figure 15.7), while ϕ is the arc length over 
the equator, the parallel determined by sinhψ = 1 and ψ = log(1+
2 ). The meridians (ϕ 
= constant) are geodesics, while the parallels (ψ = constant) including the equator are 
not geodesics because their planes do not pass through the origin of coordinates. 
 
In the cylindrical projections, the hyperboloid is projected onto a cylinder 
passing through its equator, whose axis is the z axis. The chart is the Euclidean map 
obtained unrolling the cylinder6. Using ϕ and ψ as the coordinates u and v of the chart, 
the hyperboloid surface is projected into a rectangle with 2π width and infinite height. 
The area on this chart is:

This projection is equidistant for the meridians (ϕ = constant) and for the equator (ψ = 
log(1+
2 )). 
 
 
 
Cylindrical conformal projection 
 
 
If we wish to preserve the angles between curves, we must enlarge the meridians 
by the same amount as the parallels are enlarged in a cylindrical projection, that is by a 
factor 1/sinh ψ:

The differential of arc length and area are: 
 
                                                            
6 Every plane tangent to the two-sheeted hyperboloid has Euclidean nature. So the 
Lobachevsky’s surface can be only projected onto a Euclidean chart, and the cylinder of 
projection is not hyperbolic and does not belong properly to the pseudo-Euclidean space.

which clearly displays the equivalence 
of the projection. Observe that v = 
cosh ψ means the hyperboloid is 
projected 
following 
planes 
perpendicular to the cylinder of 
projection (figure 15.8). 
 
 
 
Conic projections 
 
 
These projections are made 
into a cone surface tangent to the 
hyperboloid. Here to take the cone

 is the most natural 
choice, although as before, the cone of 
projection has Euclidean nature and does not belong properly to the pseudo-Euclidean 
space, where it should be the cone of zero length. The cone surface unrolled is a circular 
sector. In a conic projection a parallel is shown as a circle with zero distortion. The 
characteristic parameter of a conic projection is the constant of the cone n = cos θ0, 
being θ0 the Euclidean angle of inclination of the generatrix of the cone. The relation 
with the hyperbolic angle ψ0 of the parallel touching the cone (which is represented 
without distortion in the projection) and θ0 is:

On the congruence of geodesic triangles 
 
 
Two geodesic triangles on the hyperboloid having the same angles also have the 
same sides and are said to be congruent. This follows immediately from the rotations in 
the pseudo-Euclidean space, which are expressed by means of tetranions in the same 
way as quaternions are used in the rotations of Euclidean space. However, this falls out 
of the scope of this book and will not be treated. The reader must perceive, in spite of 
his Euclidean eyes7, that all the points on the hyperboloid are equivalent because the 
curvature is always the unity and the surface is always perpendicular to the radius. So 
the pole (vertex of the hyperboloid) is not any special point, and any other point may be 
chosen as a new pole provided that the new axis are obtained from the old ones through 
a rotation. 
   
 
 
Comment about the names of the non-Euclidean geometry 
 
 
Finally it is apparent that the different kinds of non-Euclidean  geometry have 
been often misnamed. The Lobachevskian surface was improperly called the 
“hyperbolic plane” in contradiction with the fact that it has constant curvature and 
therefore is not flat. Certainly, in the Lobachevsky’s geometry the hyperbolic functions 
are widely used, but in the same way as the circular functions work in the spherical 
trigonometry, as Lobachevsky himself showed. In the pseudo-Euclidean plane the 
geometry of the hyperbola is properly realised, the hyperbolic functions being also 
defined there. Thus the pseudo-Euclidean plane should be named properly the 
hyperbolic plane, while the Lobachevsky’s geometry might be alternatively called 
hyperboloidal geometry. The plane models of the Lobachevsky’s geometry (Beltrami 
disk, Poincaré disk and half plane, etc.) must be understood as plane projections of the 
hyperboloid in the pseudo-Euclidean space, which is its proper space, and then the 
Lobachevskian trigonometry may be called hyperboloidal trigonometry.  
 
On the other hand, the space-time was the first physical discovery of a pseudo-
Euclidean plane, but one no needs to appeal to relativity because, as the lector has 
viewed in this book, both signatures of the metrics (Euclidean and pseudo-Euclidean) 
are included in the plane geometric algebra and also in the algebras of higher 
dimensions. 
 
 
 
Exercises 
 
15.1. According to the Lobachevsky’s axiom of parallelism, at least two parallel lines 
pass through an exterior point of a given line. The two lines approaching a given line at 
                                                            
7 In fact, eyes are not Euclidean but a very perfect camera where images are projected on a 
spherical surface. The principles of projection are likewise applicable to the pseudo-Euclidean 
space. Our mind accustomed to the ordinary space (we learn its Euclidean properties in the first 
years of our life) deceives us when we wish perceive the pseudo-Euclidean space.

the infinity are called «parallel lines» while those not cutting and not approaching it are 
called 
«ultraparallel» 
or 
«divergent 
lines». 
Lobachevsky defined the angle of parallelism Π(s) 
as the angle which forms the line parallel to a given 
line with its perpendicular, which is a function of 
the distance s between the intersections on the 
perpendicular. Prove that Π(s) = 2 arctg(exp(−s)) 
using the stereographic projection.    
 
15.2. Find the equivalent of the Pythagorean 
theorem in the Lobachevskian geometry by taking a 
right angle triangle. 
 
15.3. A circle is defined as the curve which is the intersection of the hyperboloid with a 
plane not passing through the origin with a slope less than the unity. Show that: 
 
a) The curve obtained is an ellipse. 
 
b) The distance from a point that we call the centre to every point of this ellipse 
is constant, and may be called the radius of the circle. 
 
c) This ellipse is projected as a circle in the stereographic projection. 
 
15.4. A horocycle is the intersection of the hyperboloid and a plane with unity slope

b) By integrating  dA prove that 
the area between two lines

common “parallel” line (figure 
15.10-a) is equal to π − ϕ. 
c) Prove that the area of every 
triangle (figure 15.10-b) is equal 
to its angular defect π − α − β − 
γ . 
 
15.6 Use the azimuthal conformal projection to show that the area of a circle 
(hyperboloidal segment) with radius ψ is equal to 2 π (cosh ψ − 1). This result is 
analogous to the area of a spherical segment 2 π (1 − cos θ ).

16. SOLUTIONS OF THE PROPOSED EXERCISES 
 
 
1. The vectors and their operations 
 
1.1 Let a, b be the different sides of the parallelogram and c, d both diagonals. Then: 
 
 
c = a + b 
 
d = a − b 
 
 
c2 + d2 = ( a + b )2 + ( a − b )2 = a2 + 2 a · b + b2 + a2 − 2 a · b + b2 = 
 
 
 
= 2 a2 + 2 b2 
 
which are the sum of the squares of the four sides of the parallelogram.

1.3 Let us prove that  a ∧ b  c ∧ d = ( a ∧ b  c ) · d : 
 
      4 a ∧ b  c ∧ d = ( a b − b a ) ( c d − d c ) = a b c d − a b d c − b a c d + b a d c = 
 
 
= a b c d − d b a c − b a c d + d a b c = ( a b c − b a c ) d + d ( a b c − b a c ) = 
 
 
= 2 ( a b c − b a c ) · d = 4 ( a ∧ b  c ) · d 
 
In the same way the identity a ∧ b  c ∧ d = a · ( b  c ∧ d ) is proved. 
 
1.4 Using the identity of the previous exercise we have: 
 
 
a ∧ b  c ∧ d + a ∧ c  d ∧ b + a ∧ d  b ∧ c = 
 
 
=  a · ( b  c ∧ d ) + a · ( c  d ∧ b ) + a · ( d  b ∧ c ) = 
 
 
=  a · ( b  c ∧ d + c  d ∧ b + d  b ∧ c ) = 
 
 
= a · ( b c d − b d c + c d b − c b d + d b c − d c b ) = a · 0 = 0 
 
where the summands are simplified taking into account the permutative property. 
 
1.5 Let us denote the components proportional and perpendicular to the vector a with  || 
and ⊥. Then using the fact that orthogonal vectors anticommute and those with the same 
direction commute, we have: 

208 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
 
 a b c = a ( b|| + b⊥ ) ( c|| + c⊥ ) = ( b|| − b⊥ ) a ( c|| + c⊥ ) = ( b|| − b⊥ ) ( c|| − c⊥ ) a = 
 
 
= ( b|| c|| −  b|| c⊥  − b⊥ c|| + b⊥ c⊥ ) a = ( c|| b|| + c⊥ b|| + c|| b⊥ + c⊥ b⊥ ) a = 
 
 
= ( c|| + c⊥ ) ( b|| + b⊥ ) a = c b a 
 
1.6 Let a, b, c be the sides of a triangle and h the altitude corresponding to the base b. 
Then the altitude divides the triangle in two right triangles where the Pythagorean theorem 
may be applied:

2. A base of vectors for the plane 
 
2.1 Draw, for example, two vectors of the first quadrant and mark u1, u2, v1 and v2 on the 
Cartesian axis. Then calculate the area of the parallelogram from the areas of the 
rectangles: 
 
 
A = ( u1 + v1 ) ( u2 + v2 ) − u1 u2 − v1 v2 − 2 v1 u2 = u1 v2 − u2 v1 
 
2.2 The area of a triangle is the half of the area of the parallelogram formed by any two 
sides. Therefore: 
 
 
A = ( 3 e1 + 5 e2 ) ∧ ( −2 e1 − 3 e2 ) = ( −9 + 10 ) e12 = e12  
⇒ 
A = 1 
 
2.3  
a b c = ( a1 e1 + a2 e2 ) ( b1 e1 + b2 e2 ) ( c1 e1 + c2 e2 )  
 
 
= [ a1 b1 + a2 b2 + e12 ( a1 b2 − a2 b1 ) ] ( c1 e1 + c2 e2 ) 
 
= e1 (a1 b1 c1 + a2 b2 c1 + a1 b2 c2 − a2 b1 c2) + e2 (a1 b1 c2 + a2 b2 c2 − a1 b2 c1 + a2 b1 c1)

= ( c1 e1 + c2 e2 ) [ b1 a1 + b2 a2 + e12 ( b1 a2 −  b2 a1 ) ] =

e1 · e2 = | e1 | | e2 | cos π/3 = 1  
| e1 ∧ e2 | = | e1 | | e2 | | sin π/3 | = 3  
 
Applying the original definitions of the modulus of a vector one finds: 
 
    u2 = ( 2 e1 + 3 e2 )2 = 4 e1

2 + 12 e1 · e2 = 4 + 36 + 12 = 52     ⇒

area but the outer product e1 ∧ e2  with an area of

2.6 In order to find the components of v for the new base {u1, u2}, we must resolve the

3.2 Every complex number z can be written as product of two vectors a and b, its modulus 
being the product of the moduli of both vectors: 
 
z = a b  
⇒ 
| z | = | a | | b |  
⇒ 
 z

3.3 The equation x4 −1 = 0 is solved by extraction of the fourth roots: 
 
 
 
 
x2 = 1   ⇒ 
x1 = 1,  x2 = −1 
 
x4 = 1 
 
 
 
x2 = −1   ⇒ 
x3 = e12 ,  x4 = −e12

3.7 We suppose that the complex analytic extension f has a real part a of the form: 
 
 
a = sin x K(y)

3.12 If f(z) is analytic then the derivative at each point is unique and we can write for two 
different directions dz1 and dz2: 
 
 
df1 = dz1 f'(z)  
df2 = dz2 f'(z) 
 
According to the relationship between the complex and vectorial planes, we can multiply 
by e1 at the left in order to turn the complex differentials into vectors:

Now let us calculate the geometric product of the vector differentials: 
 
 
df1 df2 = dz1 f'(z) dz2 f’(z) = dz1 dz2 [f’(z)]* f'(z) =f'(z)
2 dz1 dz2 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA

Sincef'(z)
2 is real, both geometric products have the same argument, α(df1, df2) = α(dz1, 
dz2), and hence the transformation is conformal.  
 
 
 
4. Transformations of vectors 
 
4.1 If d is the direction vector of the reflection, the vector v' reflected of v with respect to 
this direction is given by: 
 
 
v' = d −1 v d  
 
If v'' is obtained from v' by a rotation through an angle α, and z is a unitary complex 
number with argument α /2 then: 
 
 
v'' = z −1 v' z

α

z
+
=
 
 
Joining both equations: 
 
 
v'' = z −1 d −1 v d z = c −1 v c 
 
That is, one obtains a reflection with respect another direction with vector c = d z, the 
product of the direction vector of the initial reflection and the complex number with half 
argument. 
 
4.2 Let w'' be the transformed vector of w by two consecutive reflections with respect 
different directions u and v: 
 
 
w'' = v −1 w' v = v −1 u −1 w u v  
 
Then we can write: 
 
  
w'' = z −1 w z 
 
z = u v  
z being a complex number  
 
so that it is equivalent to a rotation with an angle equal to the double of that formed by 
both direction vectors. 
 
4.3 If the product of each transformed vector v' by the initial vector v is equal to a 
complex number z2 (v' and v always form a constant angle) then: 
 
 
v v' = z2 
 
 
v' = v −1 z2 = z* v −1 z =  z −1 | z | 2 v −1 z = | z | 2 ( z −1 v z ) −1 
 
which represents an inversion with radius | z |
2 followed by a rotation with an angle equal 
to the double of the argument of z. As the algebra shows, both elemental transformations 
commute.

5. Points and straight lines 
 
5.1 If A, B, C and D are located following this order on the perimeter of the parallelogram, 
then AB=DC: 
 
AB = DC 
⇒ 
B − A = C − D  
⇒ 
D = C − B + A 
 
D = (2, −5) − (4, −3) + (2, 4) = (0, 2) 
 
The area is: 
AB ∧ BC = ( 2 e1 −7 e2 ) ∧ ( −2 e1 −2 e2 ) = −18 e12 = 18 
 
5.2 The Euler’s theorem: 
 
AD BC + BD CA + CD AB = ( D −A ) ( C −B ) + ( D −B ) ( A −C ) + ( D −C ) ( B −A )  
 
 
= C A − A C + A B − B A + B C − C B = 2 ( C ∧ A + A ∧ B + B ∧ C ) =  
 
 
= 2 ( B − A ) ∧ ( C − B ) = 2 AB ∧ BC 
 
This product only vanishes if A, B and C are collinear. On the other hand we see that the 
product is the oriented area of the triangle ABC. 
 
5.3 a) The area of the triangle ABC is the outer product of two sides: 
 
AB = B − A = (4, 4) − (2, 2) = 2 e1 + 2 e2 
 
AC = C − A = ( 4, 2) − (2, 2) = 2 e1 
 
 
AB ∧ AC = ( 2 e1 + 2 e2 ) ∧ 2 e1 = 4 e2 ∧ e1

AB2 = ( 2 e1 + 2 e2 )2 = 4 e1
2 + 4 e2
2 + 8 e1 · e2 = 4 + 16 + 16 cos π/3 = 28 
 
 
AC2 = ( 2 e1 )2 = 4  
 
 
 
BC2 = (−2 e2 )2 = 4 e2
2 = 16 
 
d( A, B ) =  AB = 
28  
d( B, C ) = BC = 4 
 
d( C, A) =  CA  = 2 
 
5.4 A side of the trapezoid is a vectorial sum of the other three sides: 
  
 
AD = AB + BC + CD 
 
AD2 = (AB +BC +CD )2 = AB2 +BC2 +CD2 +2 AB · BC + 2 AB · CD + 2 BC · CD 
 
 
= AB2 + BC2 + CD2 + 2 AB · BC − 2ABCD+ 2 BC · CD 
 
where the fact that AB and CD be vectors with the same direction and contrary sense has 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA

been taken into account. Arranging terms: 
  
 
AD2 − AB2 − BC2 − CD2 + 2 ABCD = 2 AB · BC + 2 BC · CD 
 
 
AD2 − AB2 − BC2 − CD2 + 2 ABCD = 2 BC · ( AB + CD ) 
 
 
Without loss of generality we will suppose that AB>CD: 
 
 
AB + CD = AB−CD 
 
Since the angle ABC is the supplement of the angle formed by the vectors AB and BC, we 
have: 
 
 
AD2 −AB2 −BC2 −CD2 + 2 ABCD = −2 BC ( AB−CD ) cos ABC 
 
whence we obtain the angle ABC:

5.5  
R = ( 1 − p − q ) O + p P + q Q 
⇒ 
RP = ( 1 − p − q ) OP + q QP 
 
⇒ 
RP ∧ PQ = ( 1 − p − q ) OP ∧ PQ 
 
whence it follows that: Area RPQ = ( 1 − p − q ) Area OPQ 
 
5.6 The direction vector of the straight line r is AB: 
 
AB = B − A = (5, 4) − (2, 3) = 3 e1 + e2 
AC = C − A = (1, 6) − (2, 3) = − e1 + 3 e2

because a rotation of 2π around the intersection point does not alter the lines. When the 
angle exceeds these boundaries, you may add or subtract π. 
 
5.7 a) Three points D, E, F are aligned if they are linearly dependent, that is, if the

where the barycentric coordinate system is given by the origin O and points P, Q (for 
example the Cartesian system is determined by O = (0, 0), P = (1, 0) and Q = (0, 1)). The 
transformed points D', E' and F' have the same coordinates expressed for the base O', P' 
and Q'. Then the determinant is exactly the same, so that it vanishes and the transformed 
points are aligned. Therefore any straight line is transformed into another straight line.

and consider any point R with coordinates ( x, y ): 
 
 
R = ( x, y ) = ( 1 − x − y ) O + x P + y Q  
 
 Then R', the transformed point of R, is: 
  
R' = ( 1 − x − y ) O' + x P' + y Q' = ( 1 − x − y ) ( o1 , o2 ) + x ( p1 , p2 ) + y ( q1 , q2 ) = 
 
 
= ( x ( p1 − o1 ) + y (q1 − o1 ) + o1 ,    x ( p2 − o2 ) + y ( q2 - o2 ) + o2 ) = ( x', y' ) 
 
where we see that the coordinates x' and y' of R' are linear functions of the coordinates of 
R: 
x' = x ( p1 − o1 ) + y ( q1 − o1 ) + o1 
 
y' = x ( p2 − o2 ) + y ( q2 - o2 ) + o2

An affinity does not change the coordinates x, y of A, B, C and D, but only the point base -
{O', P', Q'} instead of {O, P, Q}-. Therefore the solution of the system of equations for b

The affinity preserves the coordinates expressed in any base {D, E, F}. Then the 
transformed points form also a parallelogram: 
 
 
G' = D' − E' + F'  ⇒ D'E' = G'F' 
 
e) For any three aligned points D, E, F the single ratio r is: 
 
 
DE DF −1 = r  
⇒ 
DE = r DF 
⇒ 
E = ( 1 − r ) D + r F   
 
The ratio r is a coordinate within the straight line DF and it is not changed by the affinity: 
  
 
E' = ( 1 − r ) D' + r F'  
⇒ 
D'E' D'F'  −1 = r

where the dual coordinate system is given by the lines O, P and Q. For example, the 
Cartesian system is determined by O = [0, 0] (line −x −y +1=0), P = [1, 0] (line x = 0) and 
Q = [0, 1] (line y = 0). The transformed lines D', E' and F' have the same coordinates 
expressed for the base O', P' and Q'. Then the determinant also vanishes and the 
transformed lines are concurrent. Therefore any pencil of lines is transformed into another

where we see that the coordinates x' and y' of R' are linear functions of the coordinates of

consecutive vertices in a dual 
parallelogram (figure 16.1) then: 
 
DE = GF   ⇒   G = D − E + F 
 
Where DE is the dual vector of the intersection point of the lines D and E, and GF the 
dual vector of the intersection point of G and F. Obviously, the points EF and DG are also 
parallel because from the former equality it follows: 
 
 
EF = DG 
 
The affinity preserves the coordinates expressed in any base {D, E, F}. Then the 
transformed lines form also a dual parallelogram: 
 
G' = D' − E' + F'  ⇒ D'E' = G'F' 
 
e) For any three concurrent lines D, E, F the single dual ratio r is: 
 
 
DE DF −1 = r  
⇒ 
DE = r DF 
⇒ 
E = ( 1 − r ) D + r F   
 
The ratio r is a coordinate within the pencil of lines DF and it is not changed by the 
affinity: 
  
 
E' = ( 1 − r ) D' + r F'  
⇒ 
D'E' D'F'  −1 = r 
  
f) Let us consider four concurrent lines A, B, C and D with the following dual coordinates 
expressed in the lines base {O, P, Q}: 
 
 
A = [xA , yA] 
 
B = [xB , yB] 
 
C = [xC , yC] 
 
D = [xD , yD]

Hence it remains invariant under an affinity. Each outer product can be written as an outer

5.9 To obtain the dual coordinates of the first line, solve the identity: 
 
 
x – y – 1 ≡ a' ( – x – y + 1) + b' x + c' y 
⇒ 
a' = −1     b' = 0     c' = −2 
  
⇒

=
a
    
0
=
b

2
=
c
 
⇒ 
[0, 2/3] 
 
For the second line: 
 
x – y  + 3 ≡ a' ( – x – y + 1) + b' x + c' y 
⇒ 
a' = 3     b' = 4     c' = 2 
  
⇒

⇒ 
[4/9, 2/9] 
 
Both lines are aligned in the dual plane with the line at the infinity (whose dual 
coordinates are [1/3, 1/3]) since the determinant of the coordinates vanishes:

Therefore they are parallel (this is also trivial from the general equations). 
 
 
5.10 The point (2, 1) is the intersection of the lines x – 2 = 0 and y – 1 = 0, whose dual 
coordinates are: 
 
 
x – 2 = 0 
⇒ 
[1/5, 2/5] 
 
 
y – 1 = 0 
⇒ 
[1/2, 0] 
 
The difference of dual coordinates gives a dual direction vector for the point: 
 
 
v = [1/2, 0] – [1/5, 2/5] = [3/10, –4/10] 
 
and hence we obtain the dual continuous and general equations for the point:

x + 3 = 0 
⇒ 
[4/10, 3/10] 
 
 
y + 1 = 0 
⇒ 
[1/4, 2/4] 
 
The difference of dual coordinates gives a dual direction vector for the point: 
 
 
w = [1/4, 2/4] – [4/10, 3/10] = [–3/20, 4/20] 
 
and hence we obtain the dual continuous and general equations for the point:

Note that both dual direction vectors v and w are proportional and the points are parallel in 
a dual sense. Hence the points are aligned with the centroid (1/3, 1/3) of the coordinate 
system. 
 
 
 
6. Angles and elemental trigonometry 
 
6.1 Let a, b and c be the sides of a triangle taken anticlockwise. Then: 
 
a + b + c = 0 ⇒ 
c = − a − b 
⇒ 
c2 = ( a + b )2 = a2 + b2 + 2 a · b 
 
 
c2 = a2 + b2 + 2 a b cos(π − γ ) = a2 + b2 − 2 ab cos γ   (law of  
cosines) 
 
The area s of a triangle is the half of the outer product of any pair of sides: 
 
 
2 s = a ∧ b = b ∧ c = c ∧ a 
 
ab sin(π − γ ) e12 = bc sin(π − α) e12 = ca sin(π − β ) e12

7. Similarities and single ratio 
 
7.1 First at all draw the triangle and see that the homologous vertices are: 
  
 
P = ( 0, 0 ) 
 
P' = ( 4, 2 ) 
 
Q = ( 2, 0 ) 
 
Q' = ( 2, 0 ) 
 
R = ( 0, 1 ) 
 
R' = ( 5, 1 ) 
 
PQ = 2 e1 
 
QR = −2 e1 + e2 
 
RP = −e2 
 
P'Q' = −2 e1 + 2 e2 
Q'R' = 3 e1 + e2  
R'P' = −e1 + e2 
 
r = P'Q' PQ −1 = Q'R' QR −1 = R'P' RP −1 = −1 − e12 =

/
π

The size ratio is r = 
2  and the angle between the directions of homologous sides is 
5π/4. 
 
7.2 Let ABC be a right triangle being C the right angle. The altitude CD cutting the base 
AB in D splits ABC in two right angle triangles: ADC and BDC. In order to simplify I 
introduce the following notation: 
 
 
AB = c  
BC = a  
CA = b  
AD = x  
DB = c − x 
 
The triangles CBA and DCA are oppositely similar because the angle CAD is common and 
the other one is a right angle. Hence: 
 
 
b x −1 = ( c b −1 )* = b −1 c 
⇒ 
b2 = c x 
 
The triangles DBC and CBA are also oppositely similar, because the angle DBC is 
common and the other one is a right angle. Hence: 
 
 
a ( c − x ) −1 = ( c a −1 )* = a −1 c 
⇒ 
a2 = c ( c − x ) 
 
 
Summing both results the Pythagorean theorem is obtained: 
  
 
a2 + b2 = c ( c − x ) + c x = c2 
 
7.3 First at all we must see that the triangles ABM and BCM are oppositely similar. Firstly, 
they share the angle BMC. Secondly, the angles MBC and BAM are equal because they 
embrace the same arc BC. In fact, the limiting case of the angle BAC when A moves to B 
is the angle MBA. Finally the angle BCM is equal to the angle ABM because the sum of 
the angles of a triangle is π. The opposite similarity implies: 
 
 
MA AB −1 = BC −1 MB  
⇒ 
MA = BC −1 MB AB 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
227 
 
 
 
 
 
MB AB −1 = BC −1 MC  
⇒ 
MC −1 = AB MB −1 BC −1 
 
Multiplying both expressions we obtain: 
 
 
MA MC −1 = BC −1 MB AB2 MB −1 BC −1 = AB2 BC-2 
 
7.4 Let Q be the intersection point of the segments PA and BC. The triangle PQC is 
directly similar to the triangle PBA and oppositely similar to the triangle BQA: 
 
BA PA −1 = QC PC −1     ⇒   QC = BA PA −1 PC   ⇒   QC = BA PA
−1 PC 
 
BQ BA −1 = PA −1 PB ⇒   BQ = PA −1 PB BA    ⇒ 
BQ = PA
 −1 PB BA 
 
Summing both expressions: BC = BQ + QC = BA ( PB + PC ) PA
 −1  
 
The three sides of the triangle are equal; therefore: PA = PB + PC 
 
7.5 Let us firstly calculate the homothety ratio k, which is the quotient of homologous 
sides and the similarity ratio of both triangles: 
 
 
AB −1 A'B' = k 
 
Secondly we calculate the centre of the homothety by isolation from: 
 
 
OA' = OA k 
 
 
OA' − OA = OA ( 1 − k ) 
 
 
AA' ( 1 − k ) −1 = OA 
 
Since the segment AA' is known, this equation allows us to calculate the centre O :  
 
 
O = A − AA' ( 1 − k ) −1 = A − AA' ( 1 − AB −1 A'B' ) −1 
 
7.6 Draw the line passing through P and the centre 
of the circle. This extended diameter cuts the circle 
in the points R and R'. See that the angles R'RQ and 
QQ'R' are supplementary because they intercept 
opposite arcs of the circle. Then the angles PRQ 
and R'Q'P are equal. Therefore the triangle QRP 
and R'Q'P are oppositely similar and we have: 
 
   PR −1 PQ = PR' PQ' −1    ⇒   PQ PQ' = PR PR' 
 
Since PR and PR' are determined by P and the 
circle, the product PQ PQ' (the power of P) is constant independently of the line PQQ'. 
 
7.7 The bisector d of the angle ab divides the triangle abc in two triangles, which are

8. Properties of the triangles 
 
8.1 Let A, B and C be the vertices of the given triangle with anticlockwise position. Let S, 
T and U be the vertices of the three equilateral triangles drawn over the sides AB, BC and 
CA respectively. Let P, Q and R be the centres of the triangles ABS, BCT and CAU 
respectively. The side CU is obtained from AC through a rotation of 2π/3:

Analogously: 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
229 
 
 
 
 
 
QR = BG – CG t 
 
 
RP = CG – AG z 
 
Now  we apply a rotation of 2π/3 to PQ in order to obtain QR: 
 
 
PQ t = ( AG – BG t ) t = AG t – BG t2  
 
Since t is a third root of the unity (1 + t + t2 = 0) then: 
 
 
PQ t = AG t + BG + BG t = AG t + BG t + CG t + BG − CG t 
 
 
        = 3 GG + BG – CG t = BG – CG t = QR 
 
Through the same way we find: 
 
QR t = RP 
 
 
RP t = PQ 
 
Therefore P, Q and R form an equilateral triangle with centre in G, the centroid of the 
triangle ABC:

8.3 a) Let us calculate the area of the triangle GBC: 
 
GB ∧ BC = [ − a A + ( 1 − b ) B − c C ] ∧ BC = [ − a A + ( a + c ) B − c C ] ∧ BC = 
 
 
   = ( a AB + c CB ) ∧ BC = a AB ∧ BC 
  ⇒

The proof is analogous for the triangles GCA and GAB.  
 
b) Let us develop PG2 following the same way as in the exercise 8.2:

PG2 = [P − ( a A + b B + c C ) ]2 = P2 − 2 P · ( a A + b B + c C ) + ( a A + b B + c C )2  
 
 
= ( a + b + c ) P2 − 2 a P · A − 2 b P · B − 2 c P · C + a2 A2 + b2 B2 + c2 C 2 +

+ c ( c − 1 ) C2 + 2 a b A · B + 2 b c B · C + 2 c a C · A  
 
= a PA2 + b PB2 + c PC2 − a ( b + c ) A2 − b ( c + a ) B2 − c ( a + b ) C 2  
 
+ 2 a b A · B + 2 b c B · C + 2 c a C · A 
 
 
= a PA2 + b PB2 + c PC2 − a b ( B − A )2 − b c ( C − B )2 − c a ( A − C )2 
 
 
= a PA2 + b PB2 + c PC2 − a b AB2 − b c BC2 − c a CA2 
 
The Leibniz’s theorem is a particular case of the Apollonius’ lost theorem for a = b = c = 
1/3. 
 
8.4 Let us consider the vertices A, B, C and D ordered clockwise on the perimeter. Since 
AP is AB turned π/3, BQ is BC turned π/3, etc, we have: 
 
 
z = cos π/3 + e12 sin π/3 
 
AP = AB z 
 
BQ = BC z 
 
CR = CD z 
 
DS = DA z 
 
PR · QS = ( PA + AC + CR ) · ( QB + BD + DS ) 
 
 
= [ ( CD − AB ) z + AC ] · [ ( DA − BC ) z + BD ] 
 
 
= [ ( −AC + BD ) z + AC ] · [ ( −AC − BD ) z + BD ] = 
 
 
= [ ( −AC + BD ) z ] · [ ( −AC − BD ) z ] + [ (−AC + BD ) z ] · BD 
 
 
 
+ AC · [ ( −AC − BD ) z + BD ] 
 
 
The inner product of two vectors turned the same angle is equal to that of these 
vectors before the rotation. We use this fact for the first product. Also we must develop 
the other products in geometric products and permute vectors and the complex number z: 
PR · QS = ( −AC + BD ) · ( −AC − BD ) + ( −AC BD − BD AC − AC2 + BD2 )

Therefore AC = BD  ⇔  PR · QS = 0. The statement b) is proved through an 
analogous way.

When the vector v has the direction AB, the second summand vanishes, AC = BC 
and the triangle becomes isosceles. 
 
8.7 Let us indicate the sides of the triangle ABC with a, b and c in the following form: 
 
a = BC            b = CA         c = AB 
 
Suppose without loss of generality that P lies on the side BC and Q on the side AC . 
Hence: 
 
 
P = k B + (1 − k ) C 
 
 
Q = l A + (1 − l ) C 
 
 
CP = k CB = − k a 
 
 
CQ = l CA = l b 
 
where k and l are real and 0 < k, l < 1. Now the segment PQ is obtained: 
 
 
PQ = k a + l b 
 
Since the area of the triangle CPQ must be the half of the area of the triangle ABC, it 
follows that:

In this case the solutions only exist when a · u and b · u have different signs. However we 
can also choose the point P (or Q) lying on the another side c, what gives an analogous 
solution containing the inner product c · u . Note that if  a · u and b · u have the same sign, 
then c · u have the opposite sign because: 
 
 
a + b + c = 0  
⇒ 
c · u = − a · u − b · u 
 
what warrants there is always a solution.

There is only solution for a positive discriminant: 
 
 
1 > 8 x y 
 
The limiting curve is an equilateral hyperbola on the plane x-y. Since the triangle may be 
obtained through an affinity, the limiting curve for the triangle is also a hyperbola 
although not equilateral. 
 
If the extremes P and Q could move along the prolongations of the sides of the 
triangle without limitations, this would be the unique condition. However in this problem 
the point P must lie between C and B, and Q must lie between C and A. It means the 
additional condition:

It is easily proved that the limiting lines touch the hyperbola at the points (1/4, 1/2) 
and (1/2, 1/4). For both triangles painted with light grey there is a unique solution. In the 
region painted with dark grey there are two solutions, that is, there are two segments 
passing through the point R and dividing the triangle in two parts with equal area. By 
means of an affinity the plot in the figure 16.3 is transformed into any triangle (figure 
16.4). The affinity is a linear transformation of the coordinates, which converts the 
limiting lines into the medians of the triangle intersecting at the centroid and the 
hyperbola into another non equilateral hyperbola: 
 
 
Observe that the medians divide the triangle ABC in six triangles. If a point R lies outside 
the shadowed triangles, we can always support the extremes of the segment PQ passing

through R in another pair of sides. This means that the division of the triangle is always 
possible provided of the suitable choice of the sides. On the other hand, if we consider all 
the possibilities, the points neighbouring the centroid admit three segments.

9.3 Let us draw the circumference 
circumscribed to the triangle ABC 
(figure 16.5) and let D be any point 
on this circumference. Let P, Q and R 
be the orthogonal projections of P on 
the 
sides 
AB, 
BC 
and 
CA 
respectively. Note that the triangles 
ADP and CDR are similar because of 
DAB = π − BCD = DCR . The 
similarity of both triangles is written 
as: 
 
 
DC DA −1 = DR DP −1  
 
 
The triangles ADQ and BDR are also similar because of the equality of the inscribed 
angles CAD = CBD: 
 
 
DB DA −1 = DR DQ −1 
 
 
Since the angles RDC = PDA and RDB = QDA, the bisector of the angle BDQ is 
also bisector of the angle CDP and RDA, being its direction vector:

Let P', Q' and R' be the reflected points of P, Q and R with respect to the bisector:  
 
 
DR' = v −1 DR v 
 
Multiplying by DA we have: 
 
 
DR' DA = v −1 DR v DA = DR DA 
 
which is an expected result since the reflection of R with respect the bisector of the angle 
RDA yields always a point R' aligned with D and A. Analogously for B and C we find that 
the points D, B and Q' are aligned and also the points D, C and P': 
 
 
DQ' DB = v −1 DQ v DR DQ −1 DA = v −1 DR v DA = DR DA 
Figure 16.5 

238

DP' DC = v −1 DP v DR DP −1 DA = v −1 DR v DA = DR DA 
 
 
Now we see that the points R', Q' and P' are the transformed of A, B and C under 
an inversion with centre D: 
 
DR' DA = DQ' DB = DP' DC 
 
Since D lies on the circumference passing through A, B and C, the inversion transforms 
them into aligned points and the reflection preserves this alignment so that P, Q and R are 
aligned.

9.6 We must prove that the inversion changes the single ratio of three very close points by 
its conjugate value, because the orientation of the angles is changed. Let us consider an 
inversion with centre O and radius r and let the points A', B', C' be the transformed of A, 
B, C under this inversion. Then: 
 
 
OA' = r2 OA−1  
OB' = r2 OB −1  
OC' = r2 OC −1 
 
A'B' = OB' − OA' = r2 (OB −1 − OA −1) =  r2 OA −1 (OA − OB) OB −1

       = − r2 OA −1 AB OB −1  
 
In the same way:  
A'C' =  − r2 OA −1 AC OC  −1  
Let us calculate the single ratio of the transformed points:  
 
 
( A', B', C' ) = A'B' A'C' −1 = OA −1 AB OB −1 OC AC −1 OA = 
 
 
 
 
= OB −1 AB AC −1 OC = ( OA + AB ) −1 AB AC −1 ( OA + AC ) 
 
When B and C come near A, AB and AC tend to zero and the single ratio for the inverse 
points becomes the conjugate value of that for the initial points:

10. Cross ratios and related transformations 
 
10.1 Let ABCD be a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle. We must prove the following 
equality: 
 
 
BC AD + AB CD=BD AC  
  
which is equivalent to: 
 
 
1
=
+
AC
BD
CD
AB
AC
BD
AD
BC
 
 
Now we identify these quotients with cross ratios of four points A, B, C and D on a circle: 
 
 
( B A C D ) + ( B C A D ) = 1 
 
equality that always holds because if ( A B C D ) = r then:

When the points do not lie on a circle, the cross ratio is not the quotient of moduli 
but a complex number:

According to the triangular inequality, the modulus of the sum of two complex 
numbers is lower than or equal to the sum of both moduli:

10.2 If A, B, C and D form a harmonic range their cross ratio is 2: 
 
 
AC AD −1 BD BC −1 = 2 
 
In order to isolate D we must write BD as addition of BA and AD: 
 
 
AC AD −1 ( BA + AD ) BC −1 = 2 
 
 
AC AD −1 BA BC −1 = 2 − AC BC −1 
 
 
AD −1 = AC −1 ( 2 − AC BC −1 ) BC BA −1 = ( 2 AC −1 BC −1 ) BA −1 
 
 
AD = AB ( 1 − 2 AC −1 BC ) −1 
 
10.3 The homography preserves the cross ratio: 
 
 
A'C' A'D' −1 B'D' B'C' −1 = AC AD −1 BD BC −1 
 
which may be rewritten as: 
 
      A'C' A'D' −1 ( B'A' + A'D' ) ( B'A' + A'C' ) −1 = AC AD −1 ( BA + AD ) ( BA + AC ) −1 
 
When C and D approach to A, the vectors AC, AD, A'C' and A'D' tend to zero. So the 
single ratio of three very close points remains constant: 
 
 
A

C

and therefore the angle between tangent vectors of curves. So the homography is a 
directly conformal transformation.  
 
10.4 If F is a point on the homology axis we must prove that: 
 
 
{ F, A B C D } = { F, A' B' C' D' } 
 
 
As we have seen, a point A' homologous of A is obtained through the equation: 
 
 
OA' = OA [ 1 − r v ∧ FA ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1 
 
where O is the centre of homology, F a point on the axis, v the direction vector of the axis 
and r the homology ratio. Then the vector FA' is: 
 
 
FA' = FO + OA' = FO + OA [ 1 − r v ∧ FA ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1 
 

242 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
 
      = [ FO ( 1 − r v ∧ FA ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ) + OA ] [ 1 − r v ∧ FA ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1 
 
 
      = [ FA − r FO v ∧ FA ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] [ 1 − r v ∧ FA ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1 
 
 
Analogously: 
 
 
FB' = [ FB − r FO v ∧ FB ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] [ 1 − r v ∧ FB ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1 
 
 
FC' = [ FC − r FO v ∧ FC ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] [ 1 − r v ∧ FC ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1 
 
 
FD' = [ FD − r FO v ∧ FD ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] [ 1 − r v ∧ FD ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1 
 
The product of two outer products is a real number so that we must only pay attention to 
the order of the first loose vectors FA and FO, etc: 
 
FA' ∧ FC' = [ FA ∧ FC − r ( FA ∧ FO v ∧ FC + FO ∧ FC v ∧ FA ) ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ]  
 
 
 
[ 1 − r v ∧ FA ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1  [ 1 − r v ∧ FC ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1 
 
Using the identity of the exercise 1.4, we have: 
 
FA' ∧ FC' = [ FA ∧ FC − r FA ∧ FC v ∧ FO ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ]  
 
 
 
[ 1 − r v ∧ FA ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1  [ 1 − r v ∧ FC ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1 
 
        = FA ∧ FC ( 1 − r ) [ 1 − r v ∧ FA ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1  [ 1 − r v ∧ FC ( v ∧ FO ) −1 ] −1 
 
In the projective cross ratio all the factors except the first outer product are simplified:

10.5 a) Let us prove that the special conformal transformation is additive: 
 
 
OP' = ( OP −1 + v ) −1 ⇒ 
OP' −1  = OP −1 + v 
 
 
OP'' = ( OP' −1 + w ) −1 = ( OP −1 + v + w ) −1 
 
b)  Let us extract the factor OP from OP': 
 
 
OP' −1 = ( 1 + v OP ) OP −1 
⇒ 
OP' = OP ( 1 + v OP ) −1 
 
Then we have: 
 
 
OA' = OA ( 1 + v OA ) −1 
 
OB' = OB ( 1 + v OB ) −1 
 
 
OC' = OC ( 1 + v OC ) −1 
 
OD' = OD ( 1 + v OD ) −1 
 

 
TREATISE OF PLANE GEOMETRY THROUGH GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA 
243 
 
 
 
A'C' = OC' − OA' = OC ( 1 + v OC ) −1 − OA ( 1 + v OA ) −1 = 
 
 
= [ OC ( 1 + v OA ) − OA ( 1 + v OC ) ] ( 1 + v OC ) −1 ( 1 + v OA ) −1 
 
 
= AC ( 1 + v OC ) −1 ( 1 + v OA ) −1 
 
Analogously:  
 
 
 
B'D' = BD ( 1 + v OB ) −1 ( 1 + v OD ) −1 
 
 
A'D' = AD ( 1 + v OA ) −1 ( 1 + v OD ) −1 
 
 
B'C' = BC ( 1 + v OB ) −1 ( 1 + v OC ) −1 
 
From where it follows that the complex cross ratio is preserved and it is a special case of 
homography: 
 
 
A'C' A'D' −1 B'D' B'C' −1 = AC ( 1 + v OC ) −1 ( 1 + v OD ) AD −1  
 
 
 
 
BD ( 1 + v OD ) −1 ( 1 + v OC ) −1 BC −1 = AC AD −1 BD BC −1 
 
10.6 If the points A, B and C are invariant under a certain homography, then for any other 
point D' the following equality is fulfilled: 
 
 
( A B C D ) = ( A B C D' ) 
 
 
AC AD −1 BD BC −1 = AC AD' −1 BD' BC −1 
 
The simplification of factors yields: 
 
 
AD −1 BD = AD' −1 BD'    ⇒ 
AD −1 ( BA + AD ) = AD' −1 ( BA + AD' )   ⇒ 
 
 
⇒   AD −1 BA = AD' −1 BA 
⇒ 
AD −1 = AD' −1   ⇒ 
D = D' 
 
10.7. a) From the definition of antigraphy we have: 
 
 
A'C' A'D' −1 B'D' B'C' −1 = ( AC AD −1 BD BC −1 )* = BC −1 BD AD −1 AC 
 
If C and D approach A, then BC, BD  →  BA:

So the antigraphy is an opposite conformal transformation. 
b) The composition of two antigraphies is always a homography because twice the 
conjugation of a complex number is the identity, so that the complex cross ratio is 
preserved. 
c) The inversion conjugates the cross ratio. Consequently an odd number of inversions is 

244 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
always an antigraphy. 
d) If an antigraphy has three invariant points, then all the points lying on the 
circumference passing through these points are invariant. Let us prove this statement: if A, 
B and C are the invariant points and D belongs to the circumference passing through these 
points, then the cross ratio is real: 
 
 
( A B C D ) = ( A B C D )* = ( A B C D' ) 
 
from where D = D' as proved in the exercise 10.6. If D does not belong to this 
circumference, D' ≠ D and the cross ratio ( A B C D ) becomes conjugate. A geometric 
transformation that preserves a circumference and conjugates the cross ratio can only be 
an inversion because there is a unique point D' for each point D fulfilling this condition. 
The centre and radius of inversion are those for the circumference ABC. 
 
10.8  Consider the projectivity: 
 
 
D = a A + b B + c C    
→ 
D' = a' A' + b' B' + c' C' 
 
If A', B' and C' are the images of A, B and C then the coefficients a', b', c' must be 
proportional to a, b, c:

10.9 In the dual plane the six sides of the hexagon are six points. Since the sides AB, CD 
and EF (or their prolongations) pass through P and BC, DE and FA pass through Q, this 
means that the dual points are alternatively aligned in two dual lines P and Q. By the 
Pappus’ theorem the dual points AD, BE and CF lie on a dual line X, that is, these lines 
joining opposite vertices of the hexagon are concurrent in the point X. Moreover, as 
proved for the Pappus’ theorem the cross ratios fulfil the equalities in the left hand side: 
 
 
(BE AD FC P) = (PQ AB FE CD) 
⇔ 
{X, B A F P} = {P, Q A F C} 
  
 
(BE AD FC Q) = (PQ DE CB FA) 
⇔ 
{X, B A F Q} = {Q, P D C F} 
 
Since the cross ratio of a pencil of lines is equal to the cross ratio of the dual points, the 
equalities in the right hand side follow immediately.

OC = OQ sin γ  + OR sin γ 
 
OD = OQ cos δ  + OR sin δ

XA ∧ XC = OQ ∧ OR [ (cos γ − cos χ ) (sin α − sin χ ) − (cos α − cos χ ) (sin γ − sin χ)]

11.2 The central equation of an ellipse of centre O with semiaxis OQ and OR is: 
 
OP = OQ cos θ  + OR sin θ 
   ⇒ 
P = O ( 1 − cosθ  − sin θ ) + Q cos θ + R sin θ 
 
There is always an affinity transforming an ellipse into a circle: 
 
 
O' = (0, 0) 
 
Q' = (1, 0) 
 
R' = (0, 1) 
 
 
 
P' = O' ( 1 − cos θ − sin θ ) + Q' cos θ  + R' sin θ  = ( cos θ , sin θ ) 
 
Let us now consider any point E and a circle. A line passing through E cuts the circle in 
the points A and B; another line passing also through E but with different direction cuts 
the ellipse in the points C and D. Since the power of a point E with respect to the circle is 
constant we have: 
 

246 
RAMON GONZALEZ CALVET 
 
EA EB = EC ED 
 
EA EB −1 EB
2 = EC ED −1ED

The affinity preserves the single ratio of three aligned points: 
  
 
EA EB −1 = E'A' E'B' −1  
EC ED −1 = E'C' ED' −1  
 
 
Then:

ratio implies that the distances in each direction are enlarged by a constant ratio:

11.3 If a diameter is formed by the midpoints of the chords parallel to the conjugate 
diameter, then it is obvious that the tangent to the point where the length of the chord 
vanishes is also parallel to the conjugate diameter. This evidence may be proved by 
derivation of the central equation: 
 
 
OP = OQ cos θ  + OR sin θ

That is, OP and  dOP / dθ  (having the direction of the tangent to P) are conjugate radius. 
The area a of the parallelogram circumscribed to the ellipse is the outer product of both 
conjugate diameters, which is independent of θ : 
 
 
a = 4 (OQ cosθ  + OR sinθ ) ∧ ( −OQ sinθ  + OR cosθ ) = 4 OQ ∧ OR 
 
11.4 The area of a parallelogram formed by two conjugate diameters of the hyperbola is 
also independent of ψ: 
 
a = 4 (OQ cosh ψ  + OR sinh ψ ) ∧ ( OQ sinh ψ  + OR cosh ψ ) = 4 OQ ∧ OR 
 
11.5 Let us prove the statement for a circle. The intersections R and R' of a circumference

which is the polar line. When α is the angle TPF (figure 9.2) we havePM = PT, that

Now, by means of any projectivity (e.g. a homology) the circle is transformed into 
any conic. Since it preserves the projective cross ratio, the points M also form an aligned 
harmonic range in the conic, so the polar also passes through the touching points of the 
tangents drawn from P.

11.8 The Brianchon’s theorem is the dual of the Pascal’s theorem. In the dual plane, the 
point conic is represented by the tangential conic, the lines tangent to the point conic are 
represented by points lying on the tangential conic and the diagonals of the circumscribed

hexagon are represented by the points of intersection P, Q and R of the former exercise. 
So the algebraic deduction is the same but in the dual plane.

13.6 The first triangle has the vertices A = (0, 0), B = (5, 0), C = (5, 3) and the sides: 
 
 
AB = 5 e2  
 
BC = 3 e21  
 
CA = −5 e2 − 3 e21  
 
The second triangle has the vertices A' = (0, 0), B' = (25, −15), C' = (16, 0) and the 
sides: 
 
 
A'B' = 25 e2 − 15 e21  
B'C' = −9 e2 + 15 e21  
C'A' = −16 e2 
 
Both triangles are directly similar since: 
 
 
AB−1 A'B' = BC−1 B'C' = CA−1 C'A' = 5 − 3 e1 = r 
 
which is the similarity ratio r. The size ratio is the modulus of the similarity ratio:

14.1 The shadow of a gnomon follows a hyperbola on a plane (a quadrant) because the 
Sun describes approximately a parallel around the North pole during a day. The altitude 
of this parallel from the celestial equator is the declination, which changes slowly from 
one day to another. The March 21 and September 23 are the equinoxes when the Sun 
follows the equator. Since it is a great circle, its central projection is a straight line 
named the equinoctial line.

The negative sign indicates that the

the Titanic was shipping at the South of 
the obliged track. We can calculate the 
distance from T to the track AS taking the 
right angle triangle. By the Napier’s rule we have:

On the other hand, the right ascension A and declination D of these stars are

from the Cartesian equatorial coordinates obtained from the right ascension and

The width of the photograph is 750 pixels and the height 1166. If 750 pixels 
corresponds to 24 mm and 1166 to 36 mm, we find a focal distance of the camera equal 
to 64.6 mm and 62.3 mm respectively. However the author of the photograph indicated 
me that his camera has a focal distance of 58 mm, what implies that the original image 
was cut a 7 % in the photographic laboratory. This is a customary usage in photography, 
so we do not know the enlargement proportion of a paper copy and we must calculate 
the focal distance directly from the photograph, which is always somewhat higher than 
that calculated from the focal distance of the camera. On the other hand, the calculus of 
the focal distance is very sensitive to the errors and truncation of decimals. The best 
performance is to write a program to calculate the mean focal distance from the original 
data or to make us the paper copies without cutting the image. Known the focal 
distance, we are able to calculate the normalised coordinates u and v:

There are two solutions, but according to the statement of the problem only one 
of them is valid. Since each pair of stars gives two values of H (the position vector of 
the comet), we may distinguish the true solution because it has proper values for 
different pairs of stars. The mean value with the standard deviation so obtained is:

So I conclude that this photograph was taken the March 29 of 1997. 
 
On the other hand, I have also calculated the orientation O of the camera (of the 
line passing through the centre of the photograph):

a) The intersection of a quadric (hyperboloid) with a plane is always a conic. Since the 
curve is closed, it must be an ellipse (for horizontal planes it is a circle). 
b) We hope that the centre of the ellipse be the intersection of the plane with its 
perpendicular line passing through the origin (this occurs also in spherical geometry). 
The plane has a bivector:

The hyperboloidal radius is the arc length on the hyperboloid from any point of the 
circle to its hyperboloidal centre, which should be constant. Making the inner product of 
the position vectors of a point on the circle and its centre, we find:

The figure 16.7 shows a lateral view of a 
plane with a = 0 and equation b x + c = z. 
The  points P and P' lie on the circle. O is 
the centre of the circle on its plane and H 
is the centre on the hyperboloid. Then OH 
is the axis of the circle, which is 
perpendicular (in a pseudo-Euclidean way) 
to the circle plane, that is, their bisector has a unity slope. Note that according to a 
known property of the hyperbola, O must be the midpoint of the chord PP'. The plane 
radius is the distance PO or P'O, while the hyperboloidal radius is the arc length PH or 
P'H.

Let us search the intersection points (if they exist) with the limit circle

Then we solve the system of both equations and find that it has a unique solution:

Since they meet in a unique point and

, the horocycle projection is tangent 
to the limit circle. The centre of the horocycle is the intersection of the hyperboloid with 
its axis. However this axis has unity slope, so the intersection lies at the infinity.

This expression is applied to each asymptotic triangle surrounding the central 
triangle (figure 15.10b). Since the area of a triangle having the three vertices in the limit

This comparative diagram of the life and works of the authors of (or related with) 
the geometric algebra visualises and summarises the chronology. The XIX century may be 
properly called the century of the geometric algebra. Note the premature death of Clifford, 
which caused the delay in the development of the geometric algebra along the XX 
century.
